TO THE MOST REVE∣REND FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE BY THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBVRIE, Primate and Metropolitane of all ENGLAND, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie COVNCELL. MOst Reuerend, Dutie makes me bold, euen at my first looking and leaping out of the dungeon of Obscuritie, which hitherto had in∣closed me, to interrupt your more serious affaires, with the view of these my labours. It is not their worth, but your worthinesse that causeth this presumpti∣on. For to whom should I rather present my first-fruits, then vnto the High Priest, That hee might shake them before the Lord, to make them acceptable? Neither is any meeter to Patronise a Historie of Re∣ligion, then he, to whose Person Religion giueth, and from the same mutually receiueth, Patronage. And there∣fore I, the meanest of Leui's sonnes, doe here offer vnto your Grace, ASIA, AFRICA, and AMERICA, and that in their withered and fouler hue of passed
out-worne rites, or present Irreligious Religions; not wa∣shed with the purer streames of sacred Baptisme. EVROPE challengeth a roome in this kind by her selfe: nor would Christian Historie vouchsafe these Stran∣gers her holy companie, and therefore hath enioyned me a second Pilgrimage, and Perambulation ouer the World, to trace her footsteps, and obserue euery where her Plan∣ters, Corrupters, and Reformers. Great is this burthen of atwofold World, and requires both an Atlas and an Hercules too, to vndergoe it. The newnesse also makes it more difficult, being an enterprise neuer yet (to my knowledge) by any, in any language, at∣tempted; conioyning thus Antiquitie and Moderne hi∣story, in the obseruations of all the rarities of the World, and especially of that soule of the world, RELIGION. Yet haue I aduentured, and (I speake it not to boast, but to excuse my selfe, in so haughtie designes) this my first Voyage of Discouerie, besides mine owne poore stocke laide thereon, hath made mee indebted to seuen hundred Authors, of one or other kind, in I know not how many hundreds of their Treatises, Epistles, Relations and Histories, of diuers subiects and Languages, borrowed by my selfe; besides what (for want of the Authors them∣selues) I haue taken vpon trust, of other mens goods in their hands. Wherein had I enioyed that Academicke leisure, Or the benefits of greater Libraries, or conference with men more skilful: my Braine might haue yeelded a fairer issue, a more compleate and better-armed Minerua. But besides the want of these, the daily cares of my Fa∣mily,
the weekly dueties (in Preaching and Catechising) of my Ministerie, the grossenesse of the Aire where I liue, which (some say) makes a duller wit, I am sure, a sicklier body; maypleade excuse for me. If not, Clades Authore leuatur, The World is the weight that presseth me, and my booke shall haue this praise in the greatest dispraise, Magnis tamen excidit ausis. Howsoeuer; I shall thinke my selfe happie in your Gra∣ces Examination and Censure, if it be not Impietie in me to offer to intercept, and with interposition of these lines a while to Eclipse, your Gracious aspect and influence vnto our Church and State. And though your Grace can∣not, for more necessarie imployments, and needes not, as knowing them better alreadie, afford your Precious time to these things of baser worth: Yet if your Recrea∣tions shall vouchsafe them as Remembrancers, out of my labours to refresh yours, I shall bee more then sufficiently recompenced. Others may hence learne by that most la∣borious, though not mostlearned argument of Inducti∣on, two lessons fitting these times, the Vnnaturalnesse of FACTION and ATHEISME: That law of Na∣ture hauing written in the practise of all men (as we here in the particulars doe shew) the profession of some Reli∣gion; and in that Religion, wheresoeuer any societie of Priests or Religious persons, are, or haue beene in the World, no admittance of Paritie; the Angels in Heauen, Diuels in hell, (as the Royallest of Fathers, the Father of our Countrie hath pronounced) and all Religions on Earth, as here we shew, being equally subiect to inequali∣tie, that is, to the equitie of subordinate Order. And if I liue
to finish the rest, I hope to shew the Paganisme of Antichristian Poperie, and other Pseudo-Christian he∣resies; and the Truth of Christianitie as it is now profes∣sed and established in our Church, vnder the Great Defender of the Faith: for whose long Raigne, and your Graces prosperous seruice vnder so Religious a So∣ueraigne, I heartily pray vnto the King of Kings, and cheefe Shepheard of our Soules, IESVS CHRIST. Nouemb. 5. 1612. Your Graces in all duetie, Samuel Purchas.
TO THE READER. AND now, Reader, I come vnto thee, with whom I dare bee somewhat bolder. Being, I know not by what naturall inclination, addi∣cted to the studie of Historie, my heart would sometimes obiect a selfe-loue, in following my priuate delights in that kind. At last, I resol∣ued to turne the pleasures of my studies into studious paines, that others might againe, by delightfull studie, turne my paines into their pleasure. I here bring Religion from Paradise to the Arke, and thence follow her round about the World, and (for her sake) obserue the World it selfe, with the seuerall Countries and peoples therein; the cheife Empires and States; their priuate and publique Customes; their manifold chances and changes; also the won∣derfull and most remarkeable effects of Nature; Euents of Diuine and Hu∣mane Prouidence, Rarities of Art; and whatsoeuer I find by relations of Hi∣storians, as I passe, most worthie the writing. Religion is my more proper aime, and therefore I insist longer on the description of whatsoeuer I finde belonging thereto; declaring the Religion of the first men; the corrupting of it before, and after the Floud; the lewish obseruations; the Idols, Idolatries, Temples, Priestes, Feastes, Fastes, Opinions, Sects, Orders and Sacred Cu∣stomes of the Heathens; with the Alterations and Successions that haue therein happened, from the beginning of the World hitherto. This Worke I diuide into foure partes. This first exhibiteth, Relations and Theologicall discouerie of ASIA, AFRICA, and AMERICA: The second, when God will, shall doe the same for EVROPE: The third and fourth, in a second visitation, shall obserue such things in the same places, as I hold most remarkeable in the Christian and Ecclesiasticall Historie; and that according to the same method, which is squared in the Whole by order of Place: going still out of one Countrie into the next, in each particular part and seuerall Countrie, by the order of Time; deducing our Relations, so farre as wee haue others foot-prints to guide vs, (though not exactly naming the day and yeare, and determining questions in Chronologicall controuerfies, yet in some conuenient sort) from the Ancient times, and by degrees descen∣ding to the present. If thou demaundest what profit may bèe hereof; I an∣swere, That here Students of all sorts may find matter fitting there Studies: The naturall Philosophers may obserue the different constitution and com∣mixtion of the Elements, their diuerse working in diuerse places, the varie∣tie of heauenly influence, of the yearely seasons, of the Creatures in the
Aire, Water, Earth: They which delight in State-affaires, may obserue the varietie of States and Kingdomes, with their differing Lawes, Politics, and Customes, their Beginnings and Endings. The Diuine, besides the former, may here contemplate the workes of God, not in Creation alone, but in his Iustice and Prouidence, pursuing sinne euery were with such dreadfull plagues; both bodily, in rooting vp and pulling downe the mightiest Em∣pires; and especially in spirituall Iudgments, giuing vp so great a part of the World vnto the efficacie of Errour in strong delusions, that hauing forsaken the fountaine of liuing waters, they should digge vnto themselues these broken pittes that can hold no water; deuout in their superstitions, and superstitiuous in their deuotions; agreeing all in this, that there should bee a Religion; disagreeing from each other, and the TRVTH, in the practise thereof. Likewise our Ministers may bee incited vnto all godly labours in their function of preaching the Gospell, seeing otherwise, for outward and bodily ceremonies, the Turkes and Iewes in their manifold deuotions in their Ora∣tories euery day, and other Heathen would conuince vs of Idlenesse. And let mee haue leaue to speake it for the glorie of God, and the good of our Church; I cannot find any Priestes in all this my Pilgrimage, of whom wee haue any exact Historie, but take more bodily paines in their deuotions, than is performed by not-preaching Ministers, especially in Countrie-villages, where on the weeke daies they cannot haue occasion, or companie, for pub∣lique prayers: and therefore if they onely read the seruice then, and neuer studie for more (which I would it were not the idle practise of some) euen the Heathen shall rise vp in judgment against them. I subscribe with hand and practise to our Liturgie, but not to such Lethargie: whose darknesse is so much the more intolerable, in this Sun-shine of the Gospell, wherein wee haue a gratious King, so diligent a frequenter of Sermons; and Reuerend Bi∣shops (notwithstanding other their weightie Ecclesiasticall employments) yet diligent Preachers. The studious of Geographie may somewhat be helped in that kind: not that wee intend an exact Geographie, in mentioning euery Citie with the degrees of longitude and latitude, but yet limiting euerie Countrie in his true situation and bounds; and performing happily more then some, which take vpon them the title of Geographers, as their chiefe profession: and more then any, which I know, hath done in our language. He which admireth and almost adoreth the Capuchine Iesuite, or other Romanists for selfe-inflicted whippings, fastings, watchings, vowes of obe∣dience, pouertie, and single life, and their not sparing their limmes and liues for their wil-worships, may see, in all these, the Romanists equalled by Hea∣thens, if not out-stripped euen by the reports of the Iesuites and other their Catholiques. I. Tim. 4.8. Bodily exercise profiteth little, but Godlinesse is profitable vnto all, and hath the promise of this life and that which is to come. Here also the Reader may see most of their Popish Rites, deriued out of Chaldaean, Aegyptian, and other fountaines of Paganisme; as in the later taske we shall haue more occasion to shew. Here euerie Englishman may see cause to praise God continually for the light of his truth, communicated to vs: whereas it is (in comparison) but a small part of the world, that soundeth
the sacred name of IESVS; and of those that professe it, how infinite are the sectes and superstitions? God hath shewed his Word vnto our IACOB (THE DEFENDER OF HIS FAITH) his Statutes and his iudgments vnto this I∣srael of Great Britaine. He hath not dealt so with euery Nation, neither haue the Heathen, nor scarsely, if sarcely any other Christian Nation, so much knowledge of his iudgments. And yet how seditious are some? how prophane are other? how vnthankfull the most? That beastly Sinne of Drunkennesse, that biting Sinne of Vsurie, that Deuilish Sinne of Swaggering, ruffling in deformitie of clothes, like monstrous Chimaeras, and barking out a multi∣formitie of oathes, like hellish Cerberi, as if men could not be Gallants, vnlesse they turned Deuils: These are the payments we returne vnto the Lord, in∣stead of prayers for, and loialtie to his Maiestie; peaceablenesse and charitie to each others; modestie and sobrietie in our selues. For the forme, I haue sought in some places, with varietie of phrase, in all, with varietie of matter, to draw thee along with mee in this tedious Pil∣grimage. Some names are written diuersely, according to the differing Co∣pies which I followed, which thy discretion will easily conceiu.e I doe not in euerie question set downe my censure; sometimes, because it were more then needes; sometimes because of the difficultie. I mention Au∣thours sometimes, of meane qualitie, for the meanest haue sense to ob∣serue that which themselues see, more certainly then the contemplations and Theorie of the more learned. I would also acknowledge the labour of the meanest. I haue laboured to reduce relations to their first Authours, set∣ting their names to their allegations: the want where of hath much troubled me, whilst the most leaue out their Authors, as if their own assertion were suf∣ficient authoritie in things borrowed. I haue (to my great paines) contracted and epitomized whole volumes (and some very large) into one chapter; a thing vsuall through these relations. Where I haue found plentifull dis∣course for Religion (my chiefe aime) I am shorter in other relations; and where I haue had lesse helpes for that discouerie, I insift more on the won∣ders of Nature, and discoueries by Sea and Land, with other remarkeable accidents. These Rarities of Nature I haue sometimes suted in a differing phrase and figure of speech; not that I affect a fantasticall singularitie; but that these diuine workes might appeare in Robes, if not fitting their Maiestie, yet such as our Word-Robe did willingly without any great affectation or studie, afford: not without example of the Scripture, which vseth to bring in the mute creatures, speaking and performing, (as it were) other personall offices; nor without this effect, to make the Reader staie a while with obser∣uation and wonder; besides that varietie, of it selfe, is delightsome. If any mislike the fulnesse in some places, and the barrennesse of wordes in others; let them consider, wee handle a World, where are mountaines and vallies, fertile habitations, and sandie desarts: and others steps, whom I fol∣low, hold me sometimes in a narrower way, which elsewhere take more li∣bertie. I touch sometimes a Controuersie; both for illustration of Historie; and in season, and out of season, to shew my affection to the truth. Now if any man thinke, that it were better these rotten bones of the pas∣sed and stinking bodies of the present Superstitions were buried, then thus
raked out of their graues; besides that which hath beene said, I answere, That I haue sufficient example in the Scriptures, which were written for our learning to the ends of the World, and yet depaint vnto vs the vgly face of Ido∣latrie in so many Countries of the Heathens, with the Apoitasies, Sects, and Heresies of the Iewes, as in our first and second booke is shewed: and the Ancient Fathers also, Iustin, Tertullian, Clemens, Irenaeus, Origen, and more ful∣ly, Eusebius, Epiphanius, and Augustine, haue gone before vs in their large Catalogues of Heresies and false Opinions. And what doth more set forth the glorie of Gods grace, then in pardoning; his power, then in reforming; his justice, then in giuing men vp to such delusions? Are not these the Tro∣phees and glorious victories of THE CROSSE OF CHRIST, that hath subuerted the Temples, Oracles, Sacrifices, and Seruices of the Deuill? And maist not thou see herein, what Man is, and thou thy selfe maist be, if God leaue thee to thy selfe? Reade therefore, with praises vn∣to God, the father of thy light; and prayers, for these Hea∣thens, that GOD may bring them out of the snare of the Deuill, and that Christ may be his saluation to the ends of the World. And let me also obtaine thy prayers in this my Pilgri∣mage, to be therein directed, to the glorie of God, and good of my Coun∣trie. Euen so Lord IESVS. ({inverted ⁂})

The Catalogue of the Authors. I Haue here mustered in thy view, Courteous Reader, those Au∣thors which from mine owne sight I haue mentioned in this Worke. Some of them, I confesse, are of no great note, and some are noted for notorious counterfeits: but all are of some vse, and meet to be here placed, that they may haue their due: some of thankefulnesse for their worthie and great industrie (wherein those de∣serue a place though otherwise obscure, who by their Nauigations and Discoue∣ries, haue made the world knowne to it selfe) others, that they may be knowne to be lies and meere changelings: I was the rather induced to guie thee a Table of their names, because nothing in the Impression hath escaped more faultie then the misse-naming (besides the Where you haue not the Authors rightly placed in the Mar∣gin, you shall finde it neare the same place. Marginall misse-placing) of Authors; of which I thought good here to giue notice; the other faults being such (except a few which hast in the Presse hath caused) as the judicious Reader may easily see and amend. I acknowledge that Ramusius and M. Hakluyt, in their Bookes of Voyages, haue beene two Libraries vnto me of many Nauigations and Disco∣ueries, here mentioned. In this, and all kinds, Sacred, Prophane, Learned, Vn∣learned, Ancient, Moderne, Good, and Bad; I haue toyled my selfe to benefit thee. Some hundreds more I could haue added to this Catalogue, if I should follow others examples: but some I did not mention in my booke, as hauing no∣thing new; some for some causes I would not, and some were namelesse, and I could not: besides, such as I borrowed at the second hand; also the holy Scri∣ptures, and Apocrypha-Authors: many Dictionaries of diuers sorts, Authors of Maps, Translators, and Translations in diuers languages of the same Books, wherewith I consulted, many Manuscripts, and many Relations from friends of mine yet liuing: all which I haue made vse of, and mentioned the most in my Booke, but haue not here added, lest it might sauour of Arrogance and Ambi∣tion: and the Table is long enough without them. The letter F signifies that we haue but a fragment of the said Author: and Ps. brands him for a counterfeit. A DOct. Abbot. Abdias, ps. Christ. Adrichomi{us}. Ado Viennensis. Clement Adams. Aelianus.

THE FIRST PART OF THE RELATIONS OF THE WORLD, AND THE RELIGIONS OBSERVED IN ALL AGES AND Places discouered, from the Creation, vnto this present. THE FIRST BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of God, one in Nature, three in Persons, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. THE Poets were wont to lay the foundations and first beginnings of their poeticall Fabrikes, Homer, Virgil, Ouid, &c. with inuocation of their Gods and Muses, although those workes were sutable to such workmen, who according to their names were Makers, of those both Poems and Gods. I, as far short of their lear∣ning, as beyond them in the scope of my desires, would so farre imitate their maner, in this matter which I intend; that, although I enuie not to some their foolish claime of that Poeticall (not propheti∣call) inheritance, to make my Maker: and my matter, as in a Historie (not a Poeme) must bee made to my hands: Yet in a Historie of Religion, which hath or should haue God to be the Apoc. 1.9. Alpha and Omega, the efficient, from whom, the end to whom it proceedeth: the matter, of whom, the forme by whom and whose direction, it entreateth; I could not but make a religion to begin this discourse of Religion at him; this being the way which all men take to come to him. First therefore I beseech him that is the first and last, the eternall Father, in the name of his beloued and onely Sonne, by the light of his holy and all-seeing Spirit, to guide me in this perambulation of the World, so to take view of the Times, Places, and Customes therein, as may testifie my re∣ligious bond to him, whose I am, and whom I serue: and the seruice I owe vnto his Church, if at least this my Mite may be seruiceable to the least of the least therein:
that he as he is in him selfe the beginning and ending, Apoc.1.8. so he would bee, in some mea∣sure, of this worke the Author and finisher, that in beholding this Mappe of so in∣finitely diuersified superstitions, we may be more thankefull for, and more zealous of, that true and onely Religion, which Christ by his bloud hath procured, by his word reuealed, by his spirit sealed, and will reward eternally in the heauens. And hereto let all Christian readers say with me Amen, to him which is Apoc. 3.14. Amen, that witnesse faithfull and true, that forsaking all the by-wayes which this Labyrinth exhibiteth, we may receiue his witnesse as faithfull and true Disciples, that follow the Lambe whi∣ther soeuer he goeth, and will not heare the voice of strangers. In the next place, I hold it not vnfit briefely to expresse somewhat of Him, which indeede and throughly can neuer be expressed. For the wisest of the Prophets hath said of him and to him, that the 1.

O Al∣titudo, O the deepnesse of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God! how vn∣searchable are his iudgements, and his wayes past finding out? As for my selfe, I may most fitly borrow the words of AGVR, Prou.30.2. Surely I am more foolish than any man, and haue not the vnderstanding of a man in me: Ver.3. For I haue not learned wisedome nor attai∣ned to the knowledge of boly things. Ver.4. Yea indeede, who hath ascended vp to Heauen, and descended? Who hath gathered the Winde in his fist? Who hath bound the Waters in a garment? Who hath established all the ends of the World? What is his name, and what is his Sonnes name if thou canst tell? Tell this mysterie we cannot. And yet so farre as he hath told vs by his word and workes, we may. Of the one the next words testifie: Ver.5. Euery word of God is pure: Of the other elsewhere: Ps.19.1. The heauens declare the glo∣rie of God: Ro.1.20. and The inuisible things of him, that is his eternall power and god-head, are seen by the creation of the world, being considered in his workes. AR.14.17. God hath not (therefore) left himselfe without witnesse, who besides the testimonie of Nature, written in our hearts, hath added those of the Scripture and of the Creature, that this threefold Cord might not easily be broken, and by the mouth of two or three witnesses, we might learne plainely that he is, and in some measure what he is. That there is a God: Heauen and Earth, Angels and Deuils, Man and Beast, Reason and Sense, Greeke and Barbarian, science in the most, in the rest conscience, as a thousand witnesses, all that wee see, and which we see not, say and proclaime, that all may see, and in maner palpably feele his present deitie; in Act.17.18. whom we liue, moue, and haue our beeing. D. King lect. in Ion.4. . Hitro. ille Cice∣ro. This is a common no∣tion, and impression, sealed vp in the minde of euery man: a remnant of integritie after the fall of ADAM, a substance or blessing in the dead Elme, sparkles of fire ra∣ked vp vnder the ashes, which cannot die whiles the soule liueth. What a one he is, is not so deeply ingrauen in Nature, Nat. Doi. li.1. Nomen qua dat notitiam. whose owlish eies are dazled with the brightnesse of this light. But when heere wee might renue the question, What is his name, and what is his sonnes name? he himselfe answereth in scripture by attributing to himselfe such names, whereby wee may know him as the Creator from all creatures, as the true God from all false Gods: and so farre as is meet and necessary to our saluation. Hee then that dwelleth in light inaccessible, whom no man hath seene, nor can see 1.Io.3.2. as he is, in this our infancie, hath manifested himselfe vnto vs, 1.Co.13.12. as through a glasse darkely, that we may with MOSES haue some glauncing Exod.34.6. view of his hinder parts. These names and diuine attributes I meane not with large explications heere to ex∣presse, as not so fitting my abilitie, or purpose, & being by Dionys. de Diuinis nomin. P. Galatin. de Arcanis, l.3. Zanchius de. Nat. Dei. l.1 Bullinger. de Origine erroris, l.1. others learnedly done alrea∣dy: Yet to say a litle, where the tongues of men & Angels cannot say enough: the scrip∣ture attributeth, or he in Scripture attributeth to himselfe, names, in regard both of au∣thor & obiect diuine; sometimes (as they terme it) in the As true, wise, liuing &c. concrete; sometimes in the As truth, wisedome, life, &c. abstract; the first signifying his perfect subsistence; the other his supersubsisting perfe∣ction; those more fitted to our capacity; these to his diuinitie: who eternally & effenti∣ally is, whatsoeuer he is said to be, or in himselfe to haue. And therefore all perfections are in him but one, and this one himselfe, euery way infinite and incomprehensible, no∣thing
being in him either by participation, or as a qualitie, or as a naturall faculty, or as a mutable passion, or in such sort simply, as wee (whose vnderstandings are limited in their finite bounds, and for that cause receiuing in a finite measure, conceiuing in a finite maner) do or can comprēhend. Who can take vp the Ocean in a spoone? and yet these are both finite, and hold neerer proportion than the great Creator, and the greatest of creatures. Yet is this glimpse of this bright shining Sunne comforta∣ble through this chinke and key-hole of our bodily prison, and euen the Taste of these Delicacies, more than sweete and delectable. Some of these names are attributed to him in regard of his being, in it selfe considered, as Iehouah, Iah, Ehieh; and some in re∣gard of the persons which al haue that one being, and euery of which haue all that be∣ing, which Hock. Etclisi∣ast. Polit. li. 5. in it selfe is indiuidually one: and their seueral manners of hauing it, is that which is called their personall proprietie and incommunicable. Such a name is, Elo∣him, applied to the Father, Sonne, and Holie-Ghost, in signification mightie, in forme plurall. Some of these names are such as are communicated to Creatures also, but with this difference, that those which in the Creature are borrowed, imperfect, acciden∣tall, are in him Nature, Perfection, Substance. Some are absolutely considered as he is God blessed for euer; some relatiuely with respect vnto his Creatures. De Dco etiam vera loqui peri∣culusum. Arnob.in Psal. 91. Aug de Trin. li.1.c.3. Some againe are Negatiuely spoken, others affirmatiuely: some properly, others by a figure. But this is indeed a thornie waie, of which we may say with AVGVSTINE, Nothing is missed more dangerously, nothing sought more laboriously, nothing found more pro∣fitably. Euen the Angelicall Seraphins had their Es.6.2. sixe wings, whereof two serued to execute their prompt obedience; two couered their feet, because of mans weaknesse not able to comprehend their glory; and yet they themselues thus glorious, with two other wings couered their face, as not able to endure the brightnesse of a greater glo∣rie. Let vs then be wise, but to Rom.12.3. sobriety. Let vs go to the Lambe to vnclaspe this sea∣led booke. Col.2.3. For in him all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge are hid. Let vs so know as we may be knowne, and so Phi.3.10. comprehend as we may rather be comprehen∣ded. Let vs feare, loue, beleeue, and serue him: and then God will Ps 25.9. teach the humble his waie, and 10.7.17. They which will doe him will shall know of the doctrine. This is our way to eternall life, thus to know him, and whom he hath sent Iesus Christ: if namely we so learne Eph 4.21. Christ as the Truth is in Iesus, if we 1.Co.3.18. become fooles that we may be wise, and put∣ting off the old man be renued in the spirit of our mindes, and put on the new man which after God is shapen in righteousnes and irue holynesse. Otherwise, we 1.Co.8.2. know nothing as we ought to know, otherwise, we know nothing more, nor so much as the Diuels know. Pro.1.7. The feare of the Lord is the beginning of this wisedome. And for this cause hath he called himselfe, and proclaimed those his names, Ex.34.6. Iehoua, Iehoua, strong, mercifull and grati∣ous, slowe to anger and abundant in goodnesse and truth, &c. and the like in other places; not that we may know to know, (a foolish curiositie) but that hauing such light, wee may beleeue and walke in the light, that wee may be children of the light. Iehoua the most essentiall (and after the Iewish superstition ineffable) name of God, is not therefore only reuealed to vs that we may know him in himselfe and of himselfe to be, Heb.13.8. Yesterday, to day and the same for euer, Apoc.1.8. which is, which was, which is to come: but also as the Creator, of whom, in whom, and for whom are all things: and as the redeemler; which is known by his name Iehoua as himselfe Ex.6.3. interpreteth it, by giuing a reall be∣ing, and accomplishment to his promises. In which one name (as in others of like sig∣nification) is expressed the simplicity, Immutability, Infinitenesse, blessednesse, eternity, life, perfection and other attributes of God. When he calleth himselfe strong, therein is declared his almightie power, whether wee vnderstand it actually in producing and preseruing all things in heauen and earth; or absolutely, whereby he is able to do e∣uen those things which in his wisedome he doth not: whereby he is able to doe all things which either Quae contra∣dictionem im∣plicant sub diui∣na omnipotensia non continenur. Non pro defectis potentiae, sed quia non possunt habere rationem patibilis vel pos∣sibilis. Conuenientius dicitur, quòd eae non possunt fieri, quàm qùòd De∣us non pessit fa∣cere. Aq.1.q.25. art.3. & d. in themselues (as implying contradiction) or with him (as im∣perfections) are not impossible, both those kindes not excluding, but concluding the power of God, which because he is almightie, 2.Tim.2.12. cannot lie or denie himselfe. What should I speake of his wisedome, whereby all things are open in his sight,
both himselfe, and his creatures, past, present or to come, and that not as past or fu∣ture, but with one, eternall, perfect, certaine, immediate act of knowledge, which in regard of second causes are necessary or contingent, or in effect but meerely possible, and neuer actually subsisting. Truth is in him as a root, from whence it is first in the be∣ing; next in the vnderstanding; thirdly in the writing or saying of the creature. True he is in himselfe, in his workes ordinary, and extraordinary, and in his word reuealed by the Prophets and Apostles. What should I adde of his goodnesse, grace, loue, mercy, Iustice, and other his attributes and names not yet mentioned? as Adonai, which sig∣nifieth the Dominion of God due to him, by Creation, by purchase, by mutuall co∣uenant. Saddai, which signifieth his all-sufficience; Ehie, his eternall stabilitie; and o∣thers. Yea in one Chapter P Gal. l. 2. c.13.14.Cod. PETRVS GALATINVS rehearseth threescore and twelue names of God out of the Rabbines workes, multiplied and diuersified in ten sorts, which make in all seuen hundred and twentie names. To dilate of these at large would aske so many large Commentaries, and yet euen then should we still finde this God incomprehensible; of whom we may, in respect of our capacitie, rather say what he is not, Deus vbique est, vel magis pro∣priè est ipsam vbique. Trelcat. than what he is, whose goodnesse is not to be distinguished by qualitie, or his greatnesse discerned by quantitie, or his eternitie measured by time, or his pre∣sence bounded by place: of whom all things are to be conceiued, beyond whatsoe∣uer wee can conceiue. The Persons, Deus vnus in Trinitate, trinus in vnitate. Ar∣nob. in Psal. 145. which communicate in this Diuine Nature, are three: This is their owne witnesse of themselues; There are three which beare record in Heauen, the Fa∣ther, the Word, and the Spit it, and these three are one. This mysterie was manifested in the Mat.3. Zanch. de 3. Elohim haec fuse. baptisme of Christ, and in our baptisme in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghost. The Angels vnto this glorious Trinitie Esay.6. sing their Holy, Holy, Ho∣ly: the Scripture it selfe applying that which there may be interpreted of the Father, both to the Sonne Io. 12.41. and to the Spirit, Act. 28.25. These with other places do also signifie their personall distinction. The creation was not only the Fathers worke, but also of the other persons, as appeareth by that nowne plurall ioined to a verb sin∣gular in the first words of MOSES, and other like plurall appellations Es. 44.24 and Es.54.5.2.Sam.7.23. & many such places. The Apostles apply the couenant, worship, and works of God mentioned in the Old Testament, to the Sonne and holy Ghost in the New, neither can the one be the Sonne, or the other the spirit of God, naturally and in proper maner of speech, but they must also subsist in the same Nature with the Father, which being infinite, spirituall, immutable, can be but one, which must wholly, or not at all, be communicated. In a word, the equalitie, the names, the proprieties, the workes, the worship peculiar to God, are applied to the Sonne and Holy Ghost, equal∣ly with the Father. Which they, that list, may learne in such as especially treate of this subiect: where this mysterie of the Trinitie is auerred against all heretikes, Iewes, and Infidells: Yea by some Morn.de.ver. C.R. P Gal. I.I2. alijque plurimi. also, out of their owne authentike Authors, whether they re∣ceiue Scriptures, Rabbines, Philosophers or any other. I intend only to annoint the doore-posts of this house with this discourse, that I may make a fitter entrie thereinto, leauing the fuller handling of this mysterie to such as purposely frame their whole e∣difice with large common places heereof; which yet alway must be more certainely receiued by faith, than conceiued by reason: according to that of IVSTIN MARTYR, Vnitas in Trinitate intelligitur, & Trinitas in Vnitate noscitur: id vere quomodo fiat, nec alios scrutari velim, nec ipse mihi possum satisfacere. li. Confes. fidei. Thinke of one: a threefold light wil dazle thee; distinguish into three, & an infinite vnitie wil swallow thee. Vnus, & si dici debet, vnissimus, saith BERNARD Ber. ad Eageni. D. Abbot. pars 3. Defenc. pag.9. . Hauing thus with trembling hand written of that dreadfull mysterie of the Trinitie, of which wee may say, cum dicitur, non di∣citur; It is not told with telling, nor can be described by description; The next to be considered are the workes of God, which are either inward and immanent, or outward and transient. The inward are eternall and vnchangeable, indeed no other but him∣selfe, although accounted and called workes in regard of their effects in the World and of our conceiuing. For all the proprieties of God are infinite, as they are imma∣nent
in himselfe, yet in their transitiue and forren effectes are stinted and limited to the modell and state of the creature wherein the same effects are wrought. Such an immanent worke we conceiue and name that decree of God touching the creation of the World, Trelcat. Zanch. de Na D. l.5.c.1, 2. with his prouident disposing all and euery part thereof, according to the counsell of his owne will, and especially touching the reasonable creatures, Angels and Men, in respect of their eternall state in Saluation or Damnation. The outward workes of God are, in regard of Nature, Creation and prouidence: in regard of Grace, Redemption and Saluation, in the fulnesse of time performed by our Emanuel, God manifested in the flesh, true God and perfect man, in the vnity of one person, with∣out confusion, conuersion, or separation. 1.Io.5.20. This is very God and life eternall, Iesus Christ the Sonne of God our Lord, which was conceiued by the holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin MARY, suffered vnder PONTIVS PILATE, who was crucified, dead and buried; descended into Hell; rose againe the third day; hee ascended into Heauen; where he sitteth at the right hand of God the Father almighty, from whence he shal come to iudge the quicke and dead. And to such as are sonnes, Gal.4.6. God doth also send the Spirit of his Sonne, to renue and sanctifie them as children of the Father, members of the Sonne, temples of the Spirit, that they, euen all the elect, may be one holy Catholike Church, enioying the vnspeakeable priuiledges and heauenly preroga∣tiues of the Communion of Saints, the forgiuenesse of Sinnes, the Resurrection of the Body, and Euer lasting life. Euen so, come Lord Iesus. CHAP. II. Of the Creation of the World. THey which would without danger behold the Eclipse of the Sunne, vse not to fixe their eyes directly vpon that bright eie of the World, (although by this case darkned) but in water behold the same with more ease and lesse perill. How much fitter is it likewise for our ten∣der eyes in beholding the light of that Light, Iam.I.17. the Father of lights 1.Io.1.5. Qui scrutatur Maiestatem opprimetur à gloria. in whom is no darknesse, to diuert our eyes from that brightnesse of glory, and behold him (as wee can) in his workes? The first of which in execution was the creation of the World, plainly described by MOSES in the booke of Gene∣sis, both for the Author, matter, maner, and other circumstances; Reason it selfe thus farre subscribing, as appeareth in her schollers, (the most of the Heathens and Philo∣sophers in all ages) That this World was made by a greater than the World. In pro∣uing this, or illustrating the other, a large field of discourse might be ministred: nei∣ther do I know any thing wherein a man may more improue the reuenues of his lear∣ning, or make greater shew with a little, Ne si forte suas repetitum vene∣rit olim, Grex auium plumas, &c. decking and pruning himselfe, like AeSOPS Iay, or HORACE his chough, with borrowed feathers, than in this matter of the Creation, written of (after their maner) by so many, Iewes, Ethnikes, Heretikes, and Orthodoxe Christians. For my part it shall be sufficient to write a little, setting downe so much of the substance of this subiect, as may make more plaine way, and easier in∣troduction, into our ensuing Historie: leauing such as are more studious of this know∣ledge to those which haue purposely handled this argument, with commentaries vpon MOSES text: of which, besides many modern writers (some of which haue almost oppressed the Presse with their huge volumes) there are diuers of the Primitiue, mid∣dle, and decayed times of the Church. Gen.1.3. In the beginning (saith MOSES) God created the Heauen and the Earth. Wherein (to omit the endlesse and diuers interpretations of others, obtruding allegoricall, ana∣gogical, mystical senses on the letter) is expressed the Author of this worke to be God, Elohim; which word, as is said, is of the plurall number, insinuating the Holy Trinity, the Father as the fountaine of all goodnesse, the Sonne as the wisedome of the Father,
the Holy Ghost as the power of the Father and the Sonne concurring in this worke. The action is creating, or making of nothing, to which is required a power superna∣turall and infinite. The time was the Basil. hum.1. in principio tempo∣ris, id est simul cum tempore. Th. Aqu.1.q.46. art.3. beginning of time, when as before there had neither beene time, nor any other creature. The worke is called Heauen and Earth; which Merula & Percrius inter∣pret tiouem banc Chrysofto∣mo tribuunt. some interpret all this bodily world, here propounded in the summe, and af∣ter distinguished in parcels, according to the sixe dayes seuerall workes. Some vnder∣stand thereby the Calui.in Gen. First matter; which other Theodoret. Beda. Alcuinus, Iyra, & plerique scho∣lastici. apply only to the word Earth expoun∣ding Heauen to be that which is called Empyreum, including also the spirituall and su∣per-celestiall inhabitants. Againe, other, whome I willingly follow, Zanch.de oper. Det, pars 1. l.1.c.2. Polarus, Buca∣nus, &c. Paul. Merula. Cosogr. part.1.l.r. Peer. in Gen. interprets by Heauen the heauenly bo∣dies thē made: and after per∣fected with light and mo∣tion; by Earth the element of Earth. Iunius by Hea∣uen vnder∣stand, the out∣most circum∣ference and by Earth those things vnder it, or the mat∣ter of them. extend the word Heauen to a larger signification, therein comprehending those three Heauens, which the Scriptures mention: (one whereof is this lower, where the birds of the Hea∣uen doe flie, reaching from the Earth to the Sphere of the Moone: the second, those visible Orbes of the Planets and fixed Starres, with the first Moueable: the third cal∣led the Heauen of Heauens, the third Heauen and Paradise of God) together with all the hoast of them. By Earth they vnderstand this Globe, consisting of Sea and Land, with all the creatures therein. The first verse they hold to be a generall proposition of the Creation of all Creatures, col.1.16. visible and inuisible, perfected in Gen.2.I. Exod.20.11.Iob. 38.7. sixe dayes, as many places of Scripture testifie: which, as concerning the visible, Moses handleth after particularly, largely, and plainely, contenting himselfe with briefe mention of those inuisible creatures, both Gen. 32.1. good and Gen.3.1. bad, as occasion is offered in the fol∣lowing parts of his Historie. In the present, Pet. Martyr. in Gen. he omitteth the particular description of their Creation, least some (as Iewes and Heretikes haue done) should take occa∣sion to attribute the Creation to Angels, as assistants: or should, by the excellencie of that Nature, depainted in due colours, be carried to worshipping of Angels: a superstition which men haue embraced, towards the visible creatures, farre inferior both to Angels and themselues. Moses proceedeth therefore to the description of that first matter, and the creatures thereof framed and formed. For touching those inuisible creatures, both the Angels and their heauenly habitation, howsoeuer they are circumscribed, and haue their proper and most perfect substance, yet according to the interpretation of Diuines, Zanch. de operib pars 1. l.1.c.4. their nature differeth from that of other creatures, celestiall or terrestriall, as not being made of that first matter, whereof these consist. Let vs therefore labor rather to be like the Angels in grace, that we may be like vnto thē in glorie, than prie too curiously into their Nature (to our vnderstandings in man∣ner supernaturall) and endeuor more, in heeding the way which leadeth to that Hea∣uen of the Blessed, than busie our wits too busily in descrying or describing it. Onely thus much we may obserue thereof, that it is beyond all reach of our obseruation: in regard of substance not subiect to corruption, alteration, passion, motion: in quanti∣tie, Ioh.14.2. many dwelling places, most spacious and ample: in qualitie, a Paradise, faire, shi∣ning, delightsome, wherein no euill can be present or imminent; no good thing ab∣sent: a meere transcendent, which eye hath not seene, nor care heard, nor the heart of man can conceiue. Where the Apoc.21.3. Tabernacle of God shall be with men, and he will dwell with them, and shall be 1.Cor.15.28. all in all vnto them; where the pure in heart shall see him, and euen our bodily eyes shall behold that most glorious of creatures, the Sunne of righ∣teousnesse, and Sonne of God, Christ Iesus. Embracing these things with Hope, let vs returne to Moses his description of the sensible World; who sheweth, that that Heauen and Earth, which now we see, were in the beginning or first degree of their being, an Earth without forme, and void, a darkened depth and waters: a matter of no matter, and a forme without forme; a rude and indigested Chaos, or confusion of matters, rather to be Heb.11.3. beleeued than comprehended of vs. This is the second natu∣rall beginning. For, after the expressing of the matter, followeth that which Philoso∣phers call a second naturall Principle, Arist. Phys.l.1. Iun. praef. in Gen. Priuation, the want of that forme, of which this matter was capable, which is accidentally a naturall principle, required in regard of generation, not of constitution, here described by that part next vs, Earth, which was without forme, as is said, and void. This was the internall constitution: the exter∣nall
was, darknesse vpon the face of the Deepe. Which Deepe compriseth both the earth before mentioned, and the visible Heauens also, called a Depth, as to our capacitie in∣finite, and plyant to the Almightie hand of the Creator: called also Waters, Gibbins on Genes. not because it was perfect waters, which was yet confused, but because of a certaine re∣semblance, not onely in the vniformitie thereof, but also of that want of stabilitie, whereby it could not abide together, but as the Spirit of God moued vpon these Waters, to sustaine them; and Hier.l.trad. Hebr. Trem. & Iun. Basil.bom.2.cx Ephrem. Syro. as the Henne sitteth on her egges to cherish and quicken, as Hierome interpreteth the word, so to maintaine, and by his mightie power to bring the same into this naturall order. Here therefore is the third begin∣ning or Principle in Nature, That forme, which the Spirit of God, the third person in Trinitie (not ayre or wind, as Merc. de Fab. Mundi, & ante cum, Ter∣tull.ad Hermog. Theodoret.qu.8. in Gen. Caictan. de Angelis inter∣pretatur. some conceiue, being things which yet were not themselues formed) by that action framed it vnto, and after more particularly ef∣fected. This interpretation of the Spirit mouing vpon the Waters, agreeth with that opi∣nion which some attribute to the Stoikes, That all things are procreated and gouer∣ned by one Spirit: and Virgil most elegantly and diuinely singeth, and seemeth to paraphrase on Moses words: Virg. Aeneid. l.6. on which words Seruius commenteth, Deus est quidam diuinus spiritus, qui per 4. in∣fusus clementa, gignit vniuersa: Principio Caelum, ac Terras, camposque liquentes Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra, Spiritus intus alit: totamque infusa per artus Mens agitat molem & magno se corpore miscet: That is, Heauen first, and Earth, and Watrie plaines, Bright Moone, of Starres those twinckling traines, The Spirit inly cherisheth, Loues, moues, great bodie nourisheth; Through all infus'd this All containes. The first creatures which receiued their naturall forme, were the Elements: the first, lightest, and highest whereof is Fire, whose effect is the light, whereof it is said, that God said, Let there be Light. For howsoeuer some vnderstand this of the Vatab.in Ge. Sunne, which they will haue then to be created, Basil.bom.6. some of a qualitie diffused through that confused matter, Zanch.de op.D. part.2.l.1. & B. Pererius recen∣sel multos sau∣tores buius sent. some of a Cloud formed of the waters, which as a charriot of light with his circular motion caused day and night: to omit the more friuolous in∣terpretations of such as apply it allegorically or mystically to men or Angels, in re∣spect of the regeneration of the one, or first generation of the other; I rather follow the opinion of Iunius, Iun.in Gen. c.1. sic Damas∣cenus de Fide, l.2.c.7. Greg. Nyssen. bomtl. super Hexemeron. who applyeth this to the fierie element, whose act and quali∣tie is to enlighten; although perfectly to affirme what this Light was must be by our enlightning from him, who commaunded this Light to shine out of the darkenesse. This Light God made by his Word, not vttered in sound of syllables, nor that, which in the Ioh.1.1. Verbum Dei significat impe∣rium, decretum & voluntatem eius efficacem. Pererius in Gen. beginning was with God, and was God (and therefore could not be this Word, which now had a beginning) but by his powerfull effecting, calling things that are not as though they were, and by his calling or willing causing them to be; thereby signifying his will as plainely, and effecting it as easily, as a word is vnto a man. This Word was common to the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, each and all, by doing, vt∣tering this will or decree, the manner of doing neuerthelesse being diuers, according to the distinction of persons. Here yet is a testimonie of the Trinitie: for as by su∣staining that matter the power of God appeared, and therefore it is attributed to the Spirit; so by the order and disposition of the creatures his wisdome is manifest, which is the essentiall Word of the Father, 10.1.3. without which was made nothing that was made, which after became flesh, and dwelt among vs. Gibbins on Gen. The Trinitie decreed, the second Per∣son effected, Let there be Light, and there was Light: for by the word of the Lord were
the Heauens made. That vncreated Light commaunded this elementarie Light to be, that so the thinner and higher Element, seuered from the Aire, might by his enlight∣ning operation, effect; and the Aire, according to the nature thereof, receiue this lightsome shining: which to the Fire was an essentiall propertie, to the Aire an acci∣dentall qualitie, approued of God, as good both in it selfe, and to the future creatures. This Light did God separate from the darknesse (which indeed is nothing in nature, but the absence of Light) so disposing thereof, that Light and Darknesse should in their Hemisphere succeed each other. Whether it were so moued by the motion of the ninth Sphere, or first moueable, the highest of the moueable Heauens, and out∣most circumference, created in the beginning, as Iun.in Gen. praelec. some interprete the first words of Moses, or by any other meanes, then appointed by God, it is hard to determine. For we may not reason à facto ad fieri, from the order of their constitution, in which they now are, to the principles of their institution, whiles yet they were in making, as Simpl.arg.22. confutat. à Iunio. Simplicius, and other (Philosophers may I call them, or Atheists?) haue absurdly done, in this and other parts of the Creation. This was the first dayes worke. In the second, God said let there be a Firmament in the middest of the waters, &c. The word Rakiah, translated Firmament, signifieth Trem. & Iun. expansum, or a thing stretched out; or as some Gibbins on Gen. say, a thing made strong by stretching out, designing that vast and wide space and ayrie Region, by the extension thereof, made thinner, purer, and stronger, able to beare those waterie Clouds, which it separateth from these inferior waters, in their proper and elementarie Seat. In which sense He is said to stretch out the Hea∣uens like a Curtaine, and to lay the beames of his chambers in the waters. Psal.104.2. After the Aethereall Aether hath two parts, higher and lower; and so the Aire. Region (reaching in the hither part thereof from the middle Region of the Aire to the Moone, and from thence in the higher part to the highest Heauen) and the Aire (distinguished also into two parts, the middle, and the lower part, as the Philosophers tearme them, when they consider not the whole, as here we doe, but that part, wherein the Meteors are caused) after these two Elements, thus in the two first dayes ordered and disposed: in the third day followeth the perfecting of the two lowest Elements, the Water and Earth, which yet were confused, vntill that mightie Word of God did thus both diuorce and marrie them, compounding of them both this one Globe, now called Drie Land, and Seas. The waters which yet oppressed, and by their effusion and confusion did tyrannize, rather than orderly sub∣due, and gouerne this inferior myrie masse, were partly receiued into competent cha∣nels, and there also gathered on swelling heapes, where, though they menace a re∣turne of the old Chaos, both by their noyse and waues, yet hath Iob.38.10.11. God stablished his commaundement vpon it, and set barres and dores, and said, Hitherto shalt thou come and no further, and here shall it stay thy proud waues. Otherwise, Psal.104. 6,7. the Deepes, which then couered it as a garment, would now stand aboue the Mountaines. At his rebuke they flie, who with fetters of sand (to shew his power in weakenesse, with a miracle in na∣ture) chayneth vp this enraged Tyrant, that the creatures might haue a meet place of habitation. Thus did not onely the drie Land appeare, but by the same hand was en∣riched with Hearbes and Trees, enabled in their mortall condition, to remaine im∣mortall in their kind. And here beginneth Moses to declare the creation of com∣pound bodies; hitherto busied in the Elements. Now when the Lord had made both Plants, Trees, and Light, without the influ∣ence, yea before the being of Sunne, Moone, or Starre, he now framed those fierie Balls, and glorious Lights, whereby the Heauens are beautified, the Aire enlightned, the Seas ruled, and the Earth made fruitfull. Thus he did the fourth day, after those other things created, least some foolish Naturalist should bind his mightie hand in Natures bands, seeing these Lights now become the chiefe officers in Natures Court. That shining, before dispersed, was vnited in these bodies, whether by refraction of those former beames by these solide Globes, or by gathering that fierie substance into them, or by both, or by other meanes, I leaue to others coniectures. These be appointed to distinguish day and night, to dispose the diuers seasons of the yeare, to
exercise also a naturall influence into inferiour compounded bodies, although not in such vnlimited power as the Esai.41.22. & 44.25. Ier.10.2. Star-gazers imagine; which yet if they had, could ne∣uer be knowne of vs in such a multiplicitie of causes, and suddennesse of change, in that vnspeakeable swiftnesse of the Heauens, as appeared by Aug. de ciuit.

Nigidius Figulus his wheele, which he turned with the swiftest violence, and making a blot or marke ther∣in, as it turned made another spot in or neere the same place, as it seemed in that swiftnesse of motion to the beholders, but at the standing still of the wheele, appeared much distant. Of these lights the greatest, not in quantitie, but in operation and see∣ming, are the Sunne and Moone, the greatest lights after Macrob. Om∣nes ferè deos ad solem resert.

In the fifth day God created the Fishes and Fowles, blessing them with power of propagation. The like he performed the sixth day, in forming the Beasts both wilde and tame, and creeping things: thus furnishing the aire, water, and earth, with their proper In∣habitants. Ouid. Meta∣mor. lib. 1. Sanctius his animal mentis{que} capacius altae, Deerat adhuc, & quod dominari in caetera posset. Natus bomo est. After hee had thus prouided his cheere, hee sought him out a guest, and hauing built and furnished his house, his next care was for a fit inhabitant. Of this, Moses addeth, Furthermore God said, Let vs make man. But this will aske a longer discourse. In the meane time wee haue this testimony of Moses of the Creation of the World, whose sense if I haue missed or misted in these many words, I craue pardon. And al∣though this testimonie might suffice a Christian, Faith is the e∣uidence of things not seene. Vbi vides non est fides. which must liue by faith, and not by sight: yet to preuent cauillers, we haue other witnesses both of reason and autho∣ritie, That this World had a beginning, and that the builder and maker thereof, was God. For, doth not Nature both within and without vs, in the admirable frame of this lesse or that greater World, in the Notions of the one, and the Motions of the other, in the wise & mightie order and ordering of both, lead men vnto a higher and more excellent Nature, Natura natu∣rans. which, of his goodnes, we call GOD? When we behold the whole World, or any part of it, in the elements such agreement, in such disagreement: in the heauenly motions such constancie, in such varietie: in these compound bodies, being, liuing, sense, reason; as diuers degrees, diuersly communicated to so many formes and rankes of Creatures: Wee can no more ascribe these things to chance, than a Printers barrell of letters could by chance fall into the right composition of the Bible which he printeth, or of Homers Iliads; to vse Cic. de Nat. Deor. Tullies similitude: neither can any ascribe the Creation to the Creature, with better reason, then if by some shipwracke, being cast on a desolate Iland, and finding houses, but seeing no people therein, he could esteeme the Birds or Beasts (all the Ilanders he seeth) to be the fra∣mers of these buildings. But thou mayest thinke it eternall; Thou mayest as well thinke it to be God, Infinite, Vnchangeable, in the whole and in all the parts. Doth not the Land by seasons, the Sea by ebbing and flowing, the Aire by succeeding changes, the Heauens by motions, all measured by Time, proclaime that they had a beginning of Time? Are not Motion and Time as neere Twinnes, as Time and Eter∣nitie are implacable enemies? Nay, how canst thou force thy mind to conceiue an E∣ternitie in these things, which canst not conceiue Eternitie? which canst not but con∣ceiue some beginning, and first terme or point, from whence the motion of this wheele began? And yet how should we know this first turning of the Worlds wheele, whose hearts within vs moue, be we vnwitting or vnwilling, the beginning where∣of thou canst not know, and yet canst not but know that it had a beginning, and to∣gether with thy bodie shall haue an ending? How little a while is it, that the best

I will neere adde this saying of Vines to such vnnaturall Naturalists, as vpon slight and seeming naturall reasons, call these things into questi∣on. De veritate fidei, lib.1. c. 10.

Hence was Aristotles Eternitie, Plinies Deitie ascribed to the world, Democritus, Leucippus, and Epicurus, Atomi, the Stoikes Aeterna materia, Plato's Deus, exemplar & materia, as Hex li.1.c.I.

CHAP. III. Of Man, considered in his first state wherein he was created: and of Paradise, the place of his habitation. HItherto we haue spoken of the framing of this mightie Fabrike, the Creation of the visible World, leauing that inuisible to the spirituall Inhabitants, which there alway behold the face of the heauenly Fa∣ther, as not daring to prie too farre into such mysteries, Col 2.18. Rashly puft vp with a fleshly mind: This whereof we treate they need not, as fin∣ding all sufficience in their Al-sufficient Creator: The inferiour Creatures (which hi∣therto haue been described) know it not, but content Bernard. sup. Cunt. Serm.5. themselues with themselues, in enioying their naturall being, mouing, sense, Onely Man, in regard of his body, needeth it, and by the reasonable power of his soule can discerne and vse it. Man therefore was last created, as the end of the rest, an Epitome and Mappe of the World, a compendious little other world, consisting of a visible and inuisible Na∣ture, so resembling both the worke and the Worke-man: the lastin execution, but
first in intention, to whom all these Creatures should serue, as meanes and prouoca∣tions of his seruice to his and their Creator. Man may be considered, in regard of this life, or of that which is to come: of this life, in respect of Nature of Grace: and this Nature also sustaineth a two-fold consi∣deration, of integritie and corruption: For Eccles.7.vlt. God made man righteous, but they sought to themselues many inuentions. His first puritie in his Creation, his fall from thence by sin, his endeuour to recouer his former innocencie by future glory, either in the by-waies of superstition, which Nature (a blind guide) leadeth him into, through so many false religions; or by the true, new and liuing way, which God alone can set him, and doth conduct him in, is the subiect of our tedious taske; the first two more briefely pro∣pounded: the two last historically and largely related. In that first state, his Author and Maker was Iehouah Elohim, God in the plurality of Persons and vnitie of Essence; the Father, by the Sonne, in the power of the Spirit: whereunto, he did not only vse his powerfull word as before, saying, let there be Man, but a consultation, let vs make Man: not that he needed counsaile, but Quia ratio∣nalis creatura, quasi cum consi∣lio facta videre∣tur. Iunilius in Genes. that he in this Creature did shew his counsaile and wisdome most apparantly. The Father, as first in order, speaketh vnto the Sonne and holy Ghost, and the Sonne and holy Ghost in an vnspeakeable manner speake and decree with the Father; and Socrat. lib. 2. cap.25. the whole Trinitie consult and agree together, to make Man: which Cyril. Al. cont. Iul. lib. 1. for Mans instruction, is by Mo∣ses vttered after the manner of Men. The manner of his working was also in this Crea∣ture, singular; both in regard of his bodie, which, as a Potter his clay, he wrought and framed of the dust into this goodly shape; and of his soule, which he immediately breathed into his nosthrils. Thus hath Man cause to glorie in his Creators care, in himselfe to be humbled, ha∣uing a bodie framed not of solid earth, but of the dust (the basest and lightest part of the basest and grossest element, Psal 62.9. So vaine a thing is man) his soule of nothing, lighter then vanitie, in the infusion created, and in the Creation infused, to bee the dweller Iob 4.19. in this house of clay, and habitation of dust. Yea not a house, but a 2.Cor.5.1. taberna∣cle continually in dissolution. Such is the Maker and Matter of Man. The forme was his conformitie to God, after whose Image he was made. Christ onely is in full resem∣blance, the Col.1.15. Image of the inuisible God, Hebr.1.3. the brightnes of his glory, and the ingraued forme of his Person. Man was not this Image, but made ad imaginem, according to this Image, resembling his Author, but with imperfection, in that perfection of humane Nature. This Image of God appeared in the soule properly, secondly in the bodie (not as the Epiph hr. 71. Anthropomorphite Heretikes, and Papists pi∣cture the Tri∣nitie, the crea∣tion, &c. Popish Image-makers imagine, but) as the instrument of the soule, and lastly in the whole Person. The soule in regard of the spirituall and immortall substance, resembleth him which is a Spirit, and euerlasting: to which some adde the resemblance of the holy Trinitie, in this, that one soule hath those three essentiall faculties of Vnderstanding, Will, and Memorie, or (as others) of Vegetation, Sense, and Reason. In regard of gifts and naturall endowments, the soule in the vnderstanding part receiued a Diuine impression, and character, in that knowledge, whereby she measureth the heauens, bringeth them to the earth, lifteth vp the earth to heauen, mounteth aboue the heauens to behold the Angels, pierceth the center of the earth in darknesse to discerne the infernall regions and legions, be∣neath and aboue them all searcheth into the diuine Nature: whereby, Genes. 2. Adam was without studie the greatest Philosopher, (who at first sight knew the nature of the beasts, the originall of the Woman) and the greatest Diuine, (except the second A∣dam) that euer the earth bare. The will also, in free choice of the best things, in Ephes. 4.24. righ∣teous disposition towards man, and true holines towards God, was conformed to his will, for whose willes sake it is, and was created. The body cannot so liuely expresse the vertue of him that made it, but as it could, in that perfect constitution, ( Psal. 139.14. so feare∣fully and wonderfully made Pronaq, cum spectent anima∣lia caeter a ter∣ram, Os homini sublime dedit, &c. Ouid. ) and as the organ of the soule, whose weapon it was to righteousnes, had some shadow thereof. The whole Man in his natural Nobilitie be∣yond, & Princely dominion ouer the other Creatures (that we mention not the hope
of future blessednesse) sheweth after what Image Man was created, and to what hee should be renued. The end whereunto God made Man, is God himselfe, who hath made all things for himselfe: the subordinate end was Mans endlesse happinesse, the way whereunto is religious obedience. Moses addeth, Gen. 1.27. He created them male and female, thereby to shew, that the Wo∣man in OEconomicall respect is 1.Cor.11.7. the image and glorie of the Man, being created for the Man, and of the Man, but in relation to God, or the World, She as a Creature, was also framed after the same Image. As for that monstrous conceit of the Rabbins, that the first Man was an Hermaphrodite, it deserueth not confutation or mention. The order of the Womans creation is plainly related. God Gen. 2.21. finding not a meet help for Adam, in his sleepe tooke one of his ribs, whereof he built the Woman. This in a my∣sterie signified that deadly sleepe of the heauenly Adam on the Crosse, whose stripes were our healing, whose death was our life, and out of whose bleeding side was by Diuine dispensation framed his Spouse the Church. This may be part of the sense, or an application thereof, as Mtak de Sriot. quest. 5. some say, to this mysterie; or the signification rather of the opiclat  quid   Si diffe∣, qd in copum per ba quae reci∣tantur, de rebus qibusdam agi∣tur: quae rursum res, viceverbo rum, ad signifi∣cation acia∣rum rerum pro∣pantur. Hugo de S. Vict. to. 1. thing it selfe heere declared, then of the words, which properly and plainely set downe the Historie of a thing done, after the literall sense to be expounded. According to this sense, Moses expresseth the Creation, the making and marry∣ing of the Woman. The Maker was God, the matter a ribbe of Adam, the forme a building, the end to be a meete helpe. The Man was made of dust, the Woman of the Man, to be one flesh with the Man, and of a ribbe, to be a helpe and supporter of him in his calling, which requireth strength: neither could any bone be more easily spared, in the whole bodie, which hath not such varietie of any other kind: nor could any place more designe the Woman her due place, not of the head, that shee should not arrogate rule; not of the feet, that the husband should not reckon her as his slaue; but in a meane betweene both, and that neere the heart, in which they should (as in all Diuine and Humane Lawes else) be fastioyned. The building of this bodie of the Woman was, in regard of the Progenie, which was in that larger roome to haue the first dwelling. The soule of the Woman is to bee conceiued, Ne animū dertas externo homini; integumentum est h: sane & anima lis est: in vlami∣nus differentia est. Basil. as the soule of the man before mentioned, immediately infused and created by God, herein equall to man. Being thus made, she is married by God himselfe vnto Adam, who brought her vnto him, to shew the sacred authoritie of marriage, and of parents in marriage: A mutuall consent and gratulation followeth betweene the parties, least any should ty∣rannically abuse his fatherly power. And thus are two made one flesh in regard of one originall, equall right, mutuall consent, and bodily coniunction. And thus were this goodly couple glorious in nakednes, not so much in the ornaments of beautie, which made them to each other amiable, as of Maiestie, which made them to other crea∣tures dreadfull: the Image of God clothing that nakednesse, which in vs Apoc. 3.19. appeareth silthie, in the most costly clothing. God further blessed them both with the power of multiplication in their owne kind, and dominion ouer other kinds: and gaue them for food Gen.1.29. euery herbe bearing seed, which is vpon all the earth, and euery tree, wherein is the fruit of a tree bearing seed. He doth (as it were) set them in possession of the Crea∣tures, which by a charter of free gift he had conueyed to them, to hold of him as Lord Paramount. But least any should thinke this but a niggardly and vnequall gift, whereas since the sloud more hath been added, and that in a more vnworthinesse through mans sin: let him consider, that, since the fall, Gen 3.17. Gen.9.3. the earth is accursed, whereby many things are hurtfull to mans nature, and in those which are wholesome, there is not such varietie of kinds, such plentie in each varietie, such ease in getting our plentie, or such quality in what is gotten, in the degree of goodnes and sweetnes to the taste & nourishment. Which had they remained in this sickely and elder age of the world, we should not need to enuie Cleopatra's vanitie, or Heliogabalus his superfluity & curiositie. And had not man sinned, there should not haue needed the death of beasts to nourish his life,
which without such stay should haue beene immortall: the vse whereof was after granted, rather to supply necessitie, when the Floud had weakened the Farth, then to minister a greater abundance then before it hand: and least of all to satisfie the gree∣die and curious appetites of more then beastly men. Liberall and bountifull was Gods allowance, which yet as man abused in eating the forbidden fruit, so whether any sinfull men did transgresse by eating the flesh of beasts, as iniquitie increased, it is vncertaine. And yet it is likely, that when the earth was Gen. 6.11. filled with crueltie, as men escaped not beastly but chery, so beasts escaped not but cherly inhumanity: and men, that stay not now for commission to eate mans flesh, would then much lesse aske leaue to feede on beasts. Then did the godly Pa∣triarches liue many hundred yeeres The Fathers did not eate flesh before the floud. Orig∣in Gene. hom. i. Chrysost. hom. 27.Genes. without such foode, whereas now wee reach not to one with this helpe, that I speake not of those which by abuse heereof are as cruell to themselues, (in shortning their dayes by surfeits) as to the Creatures, ma∣king their bellies to become warrens, fish-pooles, shambles, and what not, saue what they should be? Had not man bin diuellish in sinning, he had not bin beastly in feeding, nay the beasts had abhorred that which now they practise, both against their Lord and their fellow-seruants. Es. 11.6. The Woolfe should haue dwelt with the Lambe, the Leopard should haue lien with the Kid, and the Calfe, and the Lion, and the fat beast to∣gether, and a little Childe might leade them. Eas.hex. ho. 11. lunil. in Ge. Pererius rela∣teth the opini∣ons of Bona∣uenture, Tolla∣tus, Ephrem, Isi∣dore: Also Va∣dianus, Goropi', Beroaldus in Chronico, Iunius & others haue largely hand∣led this questi∣on of paradise. And this in the time of the Floud appea∣red, when all of them kept the peace with each other, and dutifull allegeance to their Prince in that great family and little mooueable world, Neahs Arke. The place of Adams dwelling is expressed by Moses: And the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whome he had made, Gen.2.8.Maruell it is to see the confusion which sinne bringeth, which appeareth not onely in the bo∣dy, soule, diet and other prerogatiues of our first parents, but in this place also, then a place of pleasure, a Paradise and garden of delights: after, a place prohibited, and kept by the blade of a sword shaken: now the place cannot be found in earth, but is be∣come a common place in mens braines, to macerate and vexe them in the curious search hereof. Ambrose in his long Trea∣tise de Paradiso leaneth too much this way. Some doe conuert this History into an allegorie, as did the Mani∣chees, and the Originists, confuted by Methodius, as Epiphan.libr. Ancor. & contr.baeres.libr.2. Epiphanius witnesseth. Hie∣rome in 'Dan.10. saith, that seeking for shadowes in the truth, they ouer-turne the truth it selfe. Vmbras & imagines in veritate quaerentes, ipsam conantur euertere verit a∣tem, vt flumina & arbores & paradisum putent allegoriae legibiss se debere subruere. Such mysticall Mist-all and Misse-all Interpreters are our Familists in these times, by vn∣seasonable and vnreasonable allegories, raising mists ouer the Scripture-sense, which thereby they misse and cannot finde. De Gen.li 8. ca. 1.& de Ciu. Dei li.12 ca. 21. Augustine relateth three opinions, that alle∣goricall, which hee confuteth: the literali, and that which followeth both the one and the other, as himselfe doth. The Aug.de Haeres. Hermiaens and Seleucians are said to deny, that there was any such place: And the naked Adamites accounted their Church to be Pa∣radise. Others are as prodigall, and ascribe hereunto all the Earth, which was a Para∣dise, til sinne brought in a curse. Thus holdeth Wolfg. Wis∣senburg praefat. ad Dom.Nig. Gor.Bec. Becces. Ioac. Vad.de Paradiso. Likewise Hu∣go de S. Vict. reckoneth this opinion totam terram suturam Paradisum, si homo non pec∣casset: totam fa∣ctam exilium per peccatum. Annot.in.Gen. Wolfgangus Wissenburg, Goropius also, and Vadianus are of like minde, That mans exile was but the alteration of their hap∣py condition, that the fiery sword was the fiery Zone &c. A great while it went for currant, that it was a pleasant region, by a long tract of sea and land separated from our habitable world, and lifted vp to the circle of the Moone, whereby it was out of the reach of Noahs floud. This hath Histor Scho∣last. Petrus Comestor and Stratus: and many tra∣uellers in old times haue trauelled with this conceit, but brought forth a lie, as ap∣peareth by their Legends. Leg.aurea. That saint Brandon sailed thither from Ireland, is as true as that he met Indas in the way released from his paines, (as he was alway from Sa∣turday to Sunday Euensong:) or that they made fire on a fish (supposing it to be an Iland) which if he could once get his taile into his mouth, would ouerturn the world, as that Legend telleth. It should seeme the man in the Moone called him, and shew∣ed him the way to this Paradise. Others place it Eastward, in the highest top of the earth, where the foure Riuers, mentioned by Moses, haue their originall, whence they
runne, and are swallowed vp of the Earth, and after rising in diuerse places of the world, are knowne by the names of Nilus, Ganges, Tigris, Euphrates. Hugo Annot. in Genes. Hugo de S. Victore and Adrichomius Adric. Chron. are of this opinion: yea the great Cardinall Caietane Caictan.in Genes.7. and Bellarmine, Bell.de Rom. Pont.lib.3.ca.6. & de grat. pri∣mi hominis. place Henoch and Elias in earthly Paradise, yet liuing there vntil the time of Antichrist, which wood he cannot see (being in the middest of it) for trees. But the discouery of the World by Trauellers, and description thereof by Geogra∣phers, wil not suffer vs to follow them (to the want of which Art, I meane Geogra∣phie, such phantasies may bee imputed) whereby also is confuted the opinion of them, which place it vnder the Equinoctiall circle, as Durandus and Bonancntura. Phil.Melanc, & Carion. Others account so much to Paradise, as those foure Riuers doe water, euen the chiefe part of Afrike and Asia: and some confine it in streighter limits of Syria, Ara∣bia and Mesopotamia, as if Adam had beene so couetous as his Posteritie, or so la∣borious as to husband so large Countries. The salfe interpretation of those Riuers to be Nilus, Ganges &c. was the cause of this errour, the In Es.23.3. & Iere.2.1.8. Septuagint translating in stead of Sichor (which is Nilus) Gihon the name of one of these streames. Moses as it were of purpose by an exact chorography and delineation of the situ∣ation, doth meete with those errors, and with other the like, which I doe not heere relate. Neither is their opinion to be followed, which drowne all altogether in the deluge, seeing that after that time Moses wrote this. Franciscus Iunius in his readings on Genesis See also, An∣not. Trem.& Iun.in Gen.2. hath largely and learnedly handled this matter, and added a Mappe al∣so of Heden in which it stoode, and the course of the Riuers with the Countries ad∣iacent. In him the Reader may finde satisfaction. He sheweth out of Curtius, Plime, and Solinus, the miraculous fertilitie of that part of Babylonia, which Ptolomy cal∣leth Auranitis or Audanitis, easily declined from Heden, the name given by Moses, mentioned after Moses time, 2.Rag.19 12. and Es.37.12. For the foure Riuers he sheweth them out of Ptolomey, Strabo, Plinie, Dion, Mar∣cellinus &c. to be so many diuisions of Euphrates, whereof Baharsares or Neharsa∣res is Gihon, that which passeth through Babylon is, for the excellency, peculiarly cal∣led Perath or Euphrates; Nehar-malca or Basilius, Pishon; Tigris, Tigris is both the grea∣ter riuer and a smaller which runneth out of Euphrates into Tigris, which is heere meant. Chiddekel. For the fiery Sword he obserueth out of Pliny li.2.ca.106. a certaine miracle of Nature in Ba∣bylonia, where the ground is seene burning continually about the quantitie of an a∣cre. But this place will not serve to dispute this poynt. If those Rivers doe not now remaine, or have altered either channell or names, it is no new thing in so old a con∣tinuance of the world. It is more then probable, that heere in these parts Paradise was, although now deformed by the Floud, and by Time consumed and become a stage of barbarisme. Neither hath the place alone bin such a pitched field of Opinions, but the fruit al∣so which Moses expresseth to be the instrument & occasion of Adams ruine, hath set some mens teeth on edge, who tell vs what it is, as if they had lately tasted of it, a certayne signe indeede, and fruit, of that once vnlawfull tasting. Goro. Becan. Indoscythica. Goropius a man addicted to opinions, which I know not whether hee did holde more strangely, or strongly, though he enlargeth Paradise ouer the world, yet he maketh Adam an In∣dian (maruaile he placeth him not in Dutch-land, for that was his language, if Beca∣nus be to be beleeued.) About the riuer Acesines betwixt Indus and Ganges (saieth he) groweth that admirable Figge tree, which hee at large describeth out of Plinie, Theophrastus and Strabo, whose branches spreading from the body, doe bend them∣selues downewards to the earth, where they take hold, and with new rooting multi∣ply themselues, like a maze or wood. One told Car.Clus.Exo∣ticorum. Clusius that hee himselfe had beene one of eight hundred or a thousand men, which had hidden themselues vnder one of these trees, adding, that some of them were able to couer three thousand men. Strange is this tree, and Becanus is with conceit hereof ravished into the pleasures of Paradise. This tree Linschoten lib. 1.ca.58. Linschoten describeth growing about Goa, and (to bring vs out of Goropius Paradise) saith that it hath no fruit worth the eating: but a small kind like Olives, which is food only forbirds. He telleth vs c. 55. of another Indian Fig tree,
growing rather like a Reede then a Tree, a mans height, a spanne thicke, the leaves a fathome long, and three spannes broad: The Arabians and Indians suppose this to be that dismall fruit. The cause of this opinion Paludanus in his Annotations vpon Linschoten ascribeth to the pleasantnes of the smel and tast. Being cut in the middle, it hath certaine veines like a Crosse, whereon the Christians in Syria make many spe∣culations. Yea the same Author telleth of a hill in the Ile of Seilan, called Adams hill, where they shew his foot-print, to prove that he lived there: of which reade our dis∣course of that Iland, lt. 5.ca.14. Boskhier in his Ara coeli citeth out of Moses Barce∣pha, That wheat was the Tree of knowledge of good and euill; and so doe the Sa∣racens hold: so curious and vaine is blinde Reason without a guide. But I thinke I have wearied the Reader, with leading him thus vp and downe in Paradise; small fruit I confesse is in this fruit, and as little pleasure in this Paradise, but that variety happily may please some, though it be to others tedious. And for a conclusion it is, I thinke, worth the noting, that M. Cartwright an eye-witnesse, The Prea∣chers trauells. by the counsel of the Nestorian Patriark at Mosul or Niniuie visited the Ile of Eden, stil so called, and by them holden a part of Paradise, ten miles in circuit, and some∣time walled: which if it be not part of that garden-plot mentioned by Moses, yet it seemes, is part of that country somtime called Eden, in the East part whereof Paradise was planted, and not far (according to Iunius Map) from that happy vnhappy place. CHAP. IIII. Of the word Religion, and of the Religion of our first Parents before the fall. HAuing thus made way to our history of Religions, the first (and there∣fore best) Religion, is in the first place to be declared. Only somwhat may be, not vnfitly, spoken before of the word. Religion in it selfe is naturall, written in the hearts of all men, which wil (as here we shew) rather be of a false then no Religion: but the name whereby it is so called, is by birth a forreiner, by common vse made a free-denizen among vs, descen∣ded from the Romans, which by their swords made way for their words, the Authors both of the thing it selfe and of the appellation, to a great part of this Westerne world. But as the Latines have accustomed themselves to multiplicitie and varietie of Rites, so have they varied not a little about the Parents (as I may say) of this child, (as the Grecians sometimes, about Homers birth-place) some giving one etymolo∣gie and derivation of the word, and some another, that there needeth some Herald to shew the true petigree, or some Grammarian Dictator to cease the strife. Saturnal.libr.3.ca.3. Servius Sulpitius (as Macrobius citeth him) calleth that Religion, which for some holinesse is removed and separated from vs, quasi relictam à relinquendo dictam. Servius deserveth to be relinquished, and his opinion removed and separated even with an Anathema, if he would remove and separate Religion from vs, which is the life of our life, the way to our happines. The like is added of Ceremonia à carendo di∣cta, a iust name and reason of the most of the present Romish Ceremonies, whose want were their best company. Massurius Sabinus in Noc. At.libr. 4 ca 9. A. Gellius hath the like words. Religio, with Tully, is Cultus deorū, the worship of the gods, hereby distinguished from Superstition, because they were, saith he, called Superstitious, that spent whole daies in praier & sacrifices, that their children might be Superstites, survivors after them: (or rather as Lact.l.4.c.28. Qui superstitens memoriā defunctorū colunt, aut qui parentibus suis superstites celebrant imagines eorū domi, tanquā deos penates. But they which diligently vsed and perused the things pertaining to divine worship, & tanquam relegerent, were called Religious, Religiosi ex religendo tanquā ex eligendo eligentes, intelligendo intelligen∣tes.
Religiosum à superstitioso ea distinctione dis∣cernit Varr, vt à superstitioo di∣cat timeri deos, à religioso autem tantum vereri vt parentes, non vt hostes timeri. Aug. de Ciuit. lib 6.ca.6. Saint Augustine better acquainted with religion than Cicero commeth neerer to the name and nature thereof, deriuing it De Ciuit Dei libr.10.ca.4. à religendo of chusing againe. Hunc eligentes, vel potius religentes, amiseramus enim negligentes, vnde & religio dicta perhibetur: This word Religens is cited by Nigidius Figulus in Aulus Gellius; Religentem esse oportet, Religiosum nefas: Religiosus being taken in bad sense for superstitiosus. The same Fa∣ther elsewhere, in his Booke de Vera Religione In sine. acknowledgeth another originall of the word, which Lactantius béfore him had obserued, à religando, of fastning, as be∣ing the bond betweene vs and God. Vbisupra. Ad Deum tendentes, saith Augustine, & ci vnire∣ligantes animas nostras unde religio dicta creditur. Religet ergonos Religio vni ommpe∣tenti Deo. Lactantius his words are; Diximus nomen religionis à vinculo pietatis esse deductum, quòd hommem sibi Deus religaucrit & pietate constrinxerit, quia seruire nos ei vt dommo & obsequi vt patri necesseest. Melius ergo (quàm Cicero) idnomen Lucretius interpretatus est, quia dit sereligionuin nodos exolvere. And according to this ctymolo∣gie is that which Master Camden saith, Religion in old English was called Ean-fast∣nes, as the one and onely Assurance and fast Anker-hold of our soules health. Camden Rem. De vocabulo Religionis vide Suarez ae Re∣ligli 1. & Stuck∣m de sacris & sacrificijs Gentium. qui E∣tymon dat eti∣am iuum, Cultus, Ceremo¦nia, Peas, &c. Graec. Latin. Hebr.buc per∣tinentiu. This is the effect of sinne and irreligion, that the name and practise of Religion is thus diuersified, else had there bin, as one God, so one religion, and one language, wherein to giue it with iust reason, a proper name. For till men did relinquere. relin∣quish their first innocencie, and the Author of whom, and in whom they held it, they needed not religere, to make a second choice, or seek reconciliation, nor thus religere, with such paines and vexation of spirit to enquire and practise those things which might religare, binde them surer and faster vnto God: and in these respects for seue∣rall causes Religion might seeme to be deriued from all those fountains. Thus much of the word, whereby the nature of Religion is in part declared, but more fully by the description thereof. Religio est, saith 83. Quaest.q.31. Augustine, quae superioris cuiusdam naturae quaem diuinam vo∣cant, curam ceremoniamque affert. Religion is heere described generally (whether falsely or truly) professing the inward obseruation and ceremoniall outward worship of that which is esteemed a higher and diuine nature. The true Religion is the true rule and right way of serving God. Or to speake as the case now standeth with vs, Man.de vera Christ relig, .20 True re∣ligion is the right way of reconciling and reuniting man to God, that he may be saued. This true way he alone can shew vs, who is the Way and the Truth, neither can we see this same, except hee first see vs, and giue vs both eyes to see, and light also where∣by to discerne him. But to come to Adam, the subiect of our present discourse. His Religion before his fall, was not to reunite him to God, from whome he had not beene se∣parated, but to vnite him faster, and daily to knit him neerer, in the experience of that which Nature had ingrafted in him. For what else was his Religion, but a pure streame of Iusticia origi∣nalis. Originall Righteousnesse, flowing from that Image of God, where∣vnto he was created? Whereby his minde was enlightned to know the onely ve∣rie God, and his heart was engrauen, not with the letter, but the life and power of the Law, louing and prouing that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. The whole man was conformable, and endeuoured this holy practise, the bodie being pliant and flexible to the rule of the Soule, the Soule to the Spirit, the Spirit to the Father of Spirits, and God of all Flesh, which no lesse accepted of this obedience, and delighted (as the Father in his Child) in this new modell of himselfe. How happie was that blessed familiaritie with God, societie of Angels, subiection of Creatures, enuied onely of the Diuels, because this was so good, and they so wic∣ked? Nature was his Schoolemaster; or if you will rather, Gods Vsher, that taught him (without learning) all the rules of diuine Learning, of Politicall, Oeconomicall, and Morall wisdome. The whole Law was perfectly written in the fleshie Tables of his heart, besides
the especial command concerning the trees in the middest of the Garden, the one be∣ing an vniuersall and euerlasting rule of righteousnesse, the other by speciall autho∣ritie appointed, as the manifestation of Godss Diuine prerogatiue in commanding, and a triall of mans integritie in obeying. For the first part hereof, since it was so blurred in our hearts, it was renued by the voyce and finger of God on Mount Sinai, giuen then immediately by God himselfe, as God ouer all; whereas the other parts of the Law containing the Ceremoniall and Politicall ordinances, were mediately giuen by the Ministerie of Moses, as to that particular Nation. Neither know I any that make doubt of this whole Law naturally and origi∣nally communicated: saue onely that some make question of the Sabbath. How∣beit, I must confesse that I see nothing in that Commandement of the Decalogue prescribed, but is Naturall and Morall: for, both the Rest is so farre Morall, as the outward actes of Diuine worshippe cannot bee performed without suspen∣ding for a while our bodily labours: although Rest, as a figure, bee Iewish, and in it selfe, is either a fruit of wearinesse or idlenesse. And that the seuenth dayes obseruation is naturall (I meane the obseruing one day of seuen in euerie weeke) appeareth both by the first order established in Nature, when God blessed and sanctified the seuenth day; Caluia. Fagi∣ts, Pagninus, vrsinus, Hospin∣tyr, tumus, Zanch. OF. co∣lamp. Gibbins besides Per∣kins, round, Greenham, Ro∣gers and o∣thers. the streame of Interpreters, especially the later, run∣ning and ioyning in this interpretation, (the Elder being somewhat more then e∣nough busied in Allegories): by the reason in the Commandement, drawne from Gods example and sanctification in the Creation: by the obseruation of a Sab∣bath, before this promulgation of the Law, Exod. 16. and by the diuision of the dayes into weekes, The Hea∣thens by the light of Na∣ture had their weekes; as ap∣peareth by na∣ming the daies after the seuen Planets: and Saturday or Saturns day was by the Gentiles sequestred from Ciuill and Martiall af∣faires, being esteemed most fit for contem∣plation and deuotion, as saith Aretius, Probl. de Sab. both then and before by Noeh, Genes.8. 10. 12. by the ne∣cessitie of a Sabbath, as well before the Law in the dayes of the Patriarkes, as in the times of Dauid or Salomon: by the perfection of the number of seuen in the Scriptures: by the generall consent of all, that it is Morall to set apart some time to the Lord of times, and an orderly set time to the God of order, which men might generally agree on for their publike deuotions: which the Patriarkes pra∣ctised in their sacrifices and assemblies; the Heathens blindly, as other things, in their Feasts. Hereunto agreeth the iudgement of Aquinas, Secunda se∣cunde. q.122. art.4. Praeceptum de sanctificatione Sab∣bathi ponitur inter praecepta decalogi, in quantum est praeceptum morale, non in quantum est caeremoniale. The Precept of sanctifying the Sabbath, is set amongst the Precepts of the Decalogue, as it is a morall, not as ceremoniall Precept. It hath pleased him, Eccles. Pol. lib.5..70. saith M. Hooker, as of the rest, so of times to exact some parts by way of perpetuall homage, neuer to be dispensed with al nor remitted. The Morall law requiring therfore a seuenth part through∣out the age of the whole world to be that way imployed, although with vs the day be changed in regard of a new reuolution begun by our Sauiour Christ, yet the same proportion of time continueth which was before, because in reference to the benefit of Creation, and now much more of renouation thereunto added by him, which was Prince of the world to come, we are bound to account the sanctification of one day in seuen, a dutie which Gods immutable law doth, exact for euer. Thus farre Hooker. This indeed in the Sabbath was Iewish and Ceremoniall to obserue onely that last and seuenth day of the weeke, and that as a figure, and lastly with those appointed Ceremonies, and that manner of obseruation. Thus saith Aquinas Vbisupra: Habere aliquod tampus deputatum ad vacaendum dominis, cadit sub praecepto morali. Sed in quantum, &c. To haue some set time for the seruice of God is morall: but so farre this Praecept is ceremoniall, as in it is determined a speciall time, in signe of the Creation of the World. Likewise it is ce∣remoniall, according to the allegoricall signification; in as much as it was a signe of the Rest of Christ in the graue, which was the seuenth day. And likewise according to the morall signification, as it signifieth a ceasing from euery act of sin, and the Rest of the mind in God. Likewise according to the Anagogicall signification, as it prefigureth the Rest of the fruition of God, which shall be in our Countrie.
To these obseruations of Thomas we may adde that strictnesse of the obseruation, That they might not kindle a fire on the Sabbath, and such like. And howsoeuer some testimonies of the Fathers be alledged against this truth, & to proue, that the Sabbath was borne at Mount Sinai, as of Cited by Bellarmin. de imagin.l.2.c.7. and by others. Tertullian, Iustin Mariyr, Eusebius, Cyprian, Au∣gustine, which denie the Sabbatising of the Patriarchs before that time, and account it typicall. Why may we not interprete them of that Sabbath of the Iewes, which wee haue thus distinguished from the morali Sabbath, by those former notes of dif∣ference? Bronghton in his Concent alledgeth the Consent of Rabbins, as of Ram∣ban on Gen.26. and Aben Ezra vpon Exod. 20. That the Fathers obserued the Sabbath before Moses. And Moses himselfe no sooner commeth to a seuenth day, but he sheweth, that Gen.2.2,3. God rested, blessed, sanctified the same. It resteth therefore, that a time of rest from bodily labour was sanctified vnto spi∣rituall deuotions from the beginning of the world, and that a seuenth dayes rest began, not with the Mosaicall Ceremonies in the Wildernesse (as some men will haue it) but with Adam in Paradise. That which is morall (say some) is eternall, and must not giue place; I answere, That the Commaundements are eternall, but yet subordinate. There is a Mark.12.28,&31. first of all the Commandements, and there is a second like to this, like in qualitie, not in equalitie: and in euery Commaundement, the Soule of obedience (which is the obedience of the soule) taketh place of that bodie of obe∣dience which is performed by the bodie. Mercie is preferred before sacrifice, and charitie before outward worship; Act.10.9. Paul stayeth his preaching, to heale Emychus: Christ patronizeth Mark.2.25. his Disciples, plucking the eares of Corne, and affirmeth, That the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Although therefore both rest and workes of the Sabbath giue place to such duties, which the present occasion presenteth, as more weightie and necessarie to that time, yet doth it not follow, that the Sabbath is not morall, no more than the Commandement of almes is not morall, because (as Qualitas praeceptorum praefigit metam. Esi. v.g. man∣datum, non fu∣raberis, & est mandatum, omni petenti re, da. Virumque quidem magnū, quoniā trum{que}, diuinum, sed de non , maius. Non aequè displicent tena∣ces at{que} fures Bern. de praecep. & dispensat. Bernard obserueth) the prohibitiue Commaundement of stealing is of greater force, and more bindeth. And in a word, the Negatiue Precepts are of more force, and Negatiue Precepts bind at all times, & to all times: the affirmatiue bind at all times, but not to all times: and therefore negatiue are of more force. Perkins Ser. Causarum. more vniuersally bind than the affirmatiue. A man must hate his father and mother for Christs sake, and breake the Sabbaths rest for his neighbour, in cases of necessitie. And therefore such scrupulous Refert. Tho. Rogers. fancies as some obtrude vnder the name of the Sabbath, esteeming it a greater sinne to violate this holy Rest, than to commit murther, cannot be defended. Pardon this long Discourse, whereunto the longer Discourses of others haue brought me. But now mee thinkes I heare thee say, And what is all this to A∣dams integritie? Doubtlesse, Adam had his particular calling, to till the ground: his generall calling also, to serue God; which as hee was spiritually to performe in all things, so being a body, he was to haue time and place set apart for the bodily performance thereof. And what example could hee better follow then of his Lord and Creator? But some obiect, This is to slacken him running, rather then to incite and prouoke him; to bind, and not to loose him, can not be a spurre, but a bridle to his deuotion: but they should consider, that we do not tie Adam to the seuenth day onely, but to the seuenth especially, wherein to performe set, publike, and solemne worship. Neither did Daniel, that prayed thrice a day, or Dauid, in his seuen times, or Saint Paul, in his iniunction of praying continually, conceiue that the Sabbath would hinder men, and not rather further them in these workes. Neither was A∣dams state so excellent, as that he needed no helpes; which wofull experience in his fall hath taught. God gaue him power to liue, yea with an euerlasting life: & should not Adam therefore haue eaten, yea and haue had conuenient times for foode and sleepe and other naturall necessities? How much more in this perfect, yet flexible and variable condition of his soule, did hee need meanes of establishment, although euen in his outward calling he did not forget, nor was forgotten? Which outward workes, though they were not irkesome and tedious, as sinne hath made them to vs, yet did they detaine his body, and somewhat distract his mind, from that full and
entire seruice which the Sabbath might exact of him. Neither doe they shew any strong reason for their opinion, which hold the sanctification of the Sabbath, Gen. 2. to be set downe by way of anticipation, or as a preparatiue to the Iewish Sabbath, or∣dained Setbus Ca∣tris. 2453. Bur. Ormeerus, &c. 1454. 2453 yeares after. If any shall aske why the same seuenth day is not still obserued of Christians; I answère, this was figuratiue, and is abolished; but a seuenth day still remaineth. Lex naturalis est. coniunctam habens ceremonialem designationem diei (saith Iunius.) The Law is naturall, hauing adioyned thereto the ceremoniall appointment of the day. But why is this day now called the Lords day? I answere, euen therefore, because it is the Lords day, not changed by the Churches Constitution Meere, as some seeme to hold; except by the Churches authoritie they meane Christ and his Apostles: nor descended to vs by Tradition, as the Papists maintaine, seeing the Scriptures Act. 20.7.1. Cor. 16.21. Apoc. 1.10. mention the name and celebration by the constant pra∣ctise of the Apostles: yea, Christ himselfe, as he rose on that day, so did he vsually ap∣peare on that day to his Apostles before his Ascension. Christ therefore and his Apo∣stles are our authors of this change. And the Church euer since hath constantly ob∣serued it. The Fathers teach, yea the Papists themselues acknowledge this truth. So Bellarmine de Cultu Sanct. l. 3. c. 11. sayth, Ius diuintum requirebat vt vnus dies Hebdo∣made dicaretur cultni diuino: non autem conuexiebat vt seruaretur Sabbathum: staque ab Apostolis in drem Dominicum versum Congerit ibi testimonia Igna∣ty, Tertull. Clem. Orig. Athanas. Ambros. Hicron. Gregor. Leonin. Hilary. est. It was in the Primitiue Church called the Lords day, Chrys. Ser. 5. de Resurrect. the day of Bread and of Light, because of the Sacraments of the Sup∣per and Baptisme, therein administred, called Bread and Light. And how it may be ascribed to Tradition, Bell. deverbo Deinon scripto, l. 4. c. 7. Bellarmine, the great Patron of Traditions, sheweth out of Iustin Martyr, who sayth, Christus hacillis (Apostolis & Discipulis) tradaidit. Iustin in fine 2. Apolog. He there also reporteth, That they had their Ecclesiasticall Assem∣blies euery Lords day. The Rhemists, which ascribe it to Tradition in Annot. Mat. 15. acknowledge the institution thereof, in Annot. 1.Cor. 16. 2. Ignatius may be allowed Arbiter in this question of the Sabbath, who thus writeth to the Magnesians: Non Sabbatisemus, Let vs not obserue the Sabbath after the Iewish manner, as delighting in ease; For he that worketh not, let him not eat: but let euery one of vs keepe the Sab∣bath spiritually, not eating meat dressed the day before, and walking set spaces, &c. But let euery Christian celebrate the Lords day, consecrated to the Lords resurrecti∣on, as the Queene and Princesse of all dayes. Now for the particular Commaundement, which was giuen him as an especiall proofe of his obedience, in a thing otherwise not vnlawfull, it was the forbidding him to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. For in the middest of the Garden God had planted two Trees, which some call Sacraments, and were, by Gods Ordi∣nance, signes vnto him; one of life, if he obeyed; the other of death, by disobedience: Not as the Iewes thought, and Iulian scoffed, That the Tree had power to giue sharp∣nesse of wit. And although some thinke signes needlesse to so excellent a creature; yet being mutable, subiect to temptation, and each way flexible to vertue or vice, ac∣cording as he vsed his naturall power of free will, I see not why they should denie God that libertie to impose, or man that necessitie to need such monitories, and (as it were) Sacramentall instructions. For what might these Trees haue furthered him in carefulnesse, if he had considered life and death, not so much in these Trees, as in his free-will, and obeying or disobeying his Creator? These Trees, in regard of their signification, and euent, are called the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and euill; which was not euill or hurtfull in it selfe, but was a visible rule, whereby good and euill should be knowne, and that by reason of the Commaundement annexed, which he might by this Precept see to be grounded in obeying or disobeying the authoritie of the Law-giuer. An easie rule, and yet too easily broken. For when as God did hereby chalenge his owne Soue∣raignetie, by imposing so easie a fine, which might haue forbidden all but one (as con∣trariwise he allowed) and fore-signified the danger, that he might continue his good∣nesse
to man, continuing in obedience, yet did Man herein shew his contempt, in reiecting so easie a yoake, and so light a burthen. I will not reason whether these two Trees may properly be called Sacraments; of which (say some) the one was but for the bodily life, and better neuer to haue touched the other; this wee know, that in eating of this he lost both bodily and spirituall life, which the name and institution thereof fore-warned, and should haue preunted: otherwise, in eating of the other, immortalitie had beene sealed both in soule and bodie, to him and his for euer. Strange it seemeth, that he should need no monitorie signes to preuent that, which, euen with these helpes added, he did not eschew. CHAP. V. Of the fall of Man: and of Originall Sixne. HItherto we haue beheld the Creation of the World, and of our first Parents, the liuely Images of the Creator and the Creature; whome we haue somewhat leisurely viewed in a naked Maiestie, delighting themselues in the enamelled walkes of their delightfull garden. The Riuers whereof ranne to present their best offices to their new Lords, from which they were forced by the backer streames, greedie of the sight and place which they could not hold: The Trees stouped to behold them, offering their shadie mantle and varietie of fruits, as their naturall tribute: each creature in a silent gladnesse reioyced in them, and they enioyed all mutuall comforts in the Crea∣tor, the Creatures, and in themselues. A blessed payre, who enioyed all they desi∣red, whiles their desire was worth the enioying: Lords of all, and of more than all, Content; which might, in all they saw, see their Makers bountie: and beyond all they could see, might see themselues comprehended, where they could not compre∣hend: of that infinite Greatnesse and Goodnesse, which they could not but loue, reuerence, admire, and adore. This was then their Religion, to acknowledge with thankfulnesse, to be thankfull in obedience, to obey with cheerefulnesse, the Author of all this good: to the performance whereof they found no outward, no inward im∣pediment; Sicknesse, Perturbation, and Death (the deformed issue of Sinne) not yet being entred into the world. In this plight did Sathan (that old Serpent) see, disdaine, and enuie them. It was not enough for him and the diuellish crue of his damned associates, for their late re∣bellion, to be banished Heauen, but the inferiour World must bee filled with his ve∣nome, working that malice on the creatures here, which he could not there so easily wrecke on their Creator. And because Man was here Gods Deputie and Lieute∣nant, as a pettie God on the Earth, he chuseth him as the fittest subiect, in whose ru∣ine to despite his Maker. To this end he vseth not a Lion-like force, which then had beene bootlesse, but a Serpentine sleight, vsing that subtill creature as the meetest in∣strument to his Labyrinthian proiects. Whereas by inward temptation hee could not so easily preuaile, by insinuating himselfe into their mindes, he windes himselfe into this winding Beast, disposing the Serpents tongue to speake to the woman (the weaker vessell) singled from her husband, and by questioning doth first vndermine her. It is by all affirmed, that the fall was very soone af∣ter the Crea∣tion, as appea∣reth by cir∣cumstances of the narration, by Sathans malice, the womans vir∣ginitie: and many hold, it was the very day of their Creation. Bibliand. Broughtons Concent, Praeter antiquos August. Iren. Chrysust. &c. The woman (whether she had not yet experience in the nature of the crea∣tures, or did admire so strange an accident, and would satisfie her curious mind in the further tryall) entertained discourse, and was presently snared. For though shee held her to the Commaundement, yet the threatning annexed shee did somewhat mince and extenuate. What shee seemed to lessen, he feared not to annihilate, and wholly disannull, propounding not onely impunitie, but aduantage, That they should be as Gods, in the enriching of their minds with further knowledge. This he persuadeth by the equiuocating in the name of the Tree (the first equiuocation
wee read of, Io 8. 44. otherwhere plainely tearmed a lye) charging God with falsehood and malignitie. Thus he that abode not in the Truth himselfe, but was a Man-Slayer from the be∣ginning, and the father of Lying, which he no where else borrowed, but had of his owne, persuaded her by his great subtiltie first to doubt of Gods Truth in his Word (the first particular sinne that euer mans heart entertained, for the other were but oc∣casions and inducements; disobedience and vnthankfulnesse are more generall) after that she vnlawfully lusted after this new knowledge, bewitched with the pleasantnesse of the fruit to the tast and sight, she tooke & did eat, and gaue to her husband likewise. The highest power of the Soule is first intrapped, the lusting and sensible faculties fol∣low after, iustly plagued by a correspondent inward rebellion, that the sense now ru∣leth the appetite; and this the reason, in our corrupt estate, which hence proceeded. Foolish and wicked is their conceit, that measure this sinne by the fruit (a Nut or Apple) that was eaten: as Pope Iulius, That said he might be as well angtie for his Peacocke, as God (whose Vicar he was) for an Apple: Bal. de vit. Pont. Thus vnbeleefe brought foorth vnthankfulnesse; vnthankfulnesse, pride; from thence ambition, and all that rabble of contempt of Gods Truth, beleeuing the De∣uils lyes, abuse of the creatures to wanton lust, Sacrilegious vsurping that which God had reserued, scandalous prouocation of her husband, with the murther bodily and ghostly, of him, her selfe, & their whole posteritie for euer: and whereas yet they had done so little seruice to God, yet they offered almost their First fruits to the deuill, hauing Free will to haue resisted if they would. No maruell then if such a combination of so many sinnes in one, wrung from the iustice of God such a multitude of iudge∣ments on them and theirs, in the defacing that goodly and glorious Image of God; subiecting (in stead thereof) the bodie to Sicknesse, Cold, Heat, Nakednesse, Hunger, Thirst, Stripes, Wounds, Death; the Mind to Ignorance, Doubtings, Vanitie, Phan∣cies, Phrenzies; the Will to Vnstayednesse, Passions, Perturbations; the whole Man is made a slaue to Sinne within him, to the Diuell without; whence he must expect wages sutable to his worke, Death; Spirituall, Naturall, and Eternall: an infinite pu∣nishment for offending Posse si vel∣lent sed non velle vt possens. an infinite Maiestie. Thus had they put out their light in obscure darkenesse: and if they were not pre∣sently cast into vtter darknesse, it was Gods mercie (not their merit) which suspended the first & naturall death, to preuent that second and eternall. But spiritually they were euen alreadie dead in sinnes, as appeared by the accusations of their conscience; wher∣of Moses sayth, Gen. 3. 7. The eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. Conscience, before Vertues keeper, was now become Hels harbenger, thence flashing lightnings in the face of their mindes, to shew that their nakednesse did now appeare filthie in Gods sight: Lightnings indeed, which could only lighten to terrifie, not en∣lighten with instruction and comfort: Which sparke remaineth after the fire of Gods image extinct, by the mercifull prouidence of God, in some Spiritus repri∣mens, & reno∣uans. to be a bridle of Nature, least they should runne into all excesse of villanie, and not leaue a face of the world in the world, and to be to others, by disposition and working of a higher & supernaturall Light, a preparatiue to, and a preseruatiue in that Light of Life. So much the greater is their sinne, that seeke to flash out these flashings: and whereas they cannot reade the booke of Scripture, and will not read the booke of the Creature, labour to extinguish also this Light of Nature, that with feared consciences they may more freely in dark∣nesse commit the workes of darknesse. And euen this did Adam seeke, if God had not brought him out of his Owles nest. For what could a Figge-leafe hide from God? and did they thinke the innocent Trees would conspire with them to conceale Traytors? Was there any darknesse which was not Light to him? Or could Breeches and Trees couer their Soules, which receiued the first and worst Nakednesse; till which, Naked∣nesse to the bodie was a Clothing of Beautie, a Liuerie of Bountie, an Ensigne of Ma∣iestie? Such Ier. 2. 13. broken pits seeke they that forsake the Fountaine of liuing Waters. And yet when God commeth into Iudgement, and Gen. 3. 8. makes the windes to vsher him vnto his priuate Sessions in Paradise; to those shiftlesse shifts they added worse, impiously accusing God, vncharitably charging one another, to put from themselues that blame which thus claue faster to them. A medicine worse than the disease, or a
disease in stead of a medicine is hypocrisie, that will not see her owne sicknesse, and seekes rather couer, then to cure; to couer by charging others, then recouer by dis∣charging it selfe; as if equitie pretended were not iniquitie doubled. God procee∣deth to sentence, a sentence worthie of God, shewing at once his infinite iustice in the punishment of sinne, and no lesse infinite mercie, to prouide an infinite price to redeeme vs, by his infinite power bringing good out of euill, and by his manifold Wisdome taking that wise one in his craftinesse, who in the destruction of man had sought Gods dishonour. So good is it that euill should be, when this soueraigne goodnesse purposeth to effect his good will by wicked instruments, out of their darkenesse producing his owne maruellous light: as appeared in this worke of Sathan an aduersarie, intended to his despite; in and by the promised Seed, disposed to his glorie. Gen.3.14. The Serpent hath a bodily curse in his future bodily difficulties, which still continue, for his instrumentall and bodily imployment. The Vers..15. old Serpent and spirituall enemie hath a spirituall and eternall curse, the brea∣king of his head by that Seed of the woman, that should once lead Captiuitie captiue. Our parents are cursed, yet so, as their curse is turned into a blessing; all things wor∣king to the best: In sorrow shall be the womans conceptions, but recompenced with the ioy which followeth (and is as it were the midwife in their trauell) because of Iob.16.21. fruit borne into the world; and more then recompenced, in that they are 1.Tim.2.vlt. saued by bearing of children, if they continue in the fanh, and liue in holmesse with modestie. Adam is set to labour, not as before, with delight, but with paine and difficultie; the Earth also being cursed for his sake: yet by this narrow way, by this crosse-way he is guided to Heauen; the hope whereof was giuen him, before Paradise was taken from him. So true is it, that in iudgement he remembreth mercy, if we can learne to liue by faith & not by sight. This, that Moses telleth of the fall of Man, Experience doth in manner proclaime through the world, in the manifold effects thereof, which we daily see. For whereas the World was made for Man, as before is shewed, who alone, in regard of his bodily and spirituall nature, can need and vse it, no creature in the world is in his kind so im∣perfectas Man. He that was before as an earthly God, is now become an incarnate di∣uell, and for aspiring to be like his Lord, was made a seruant of his seruants; the no∣blest part in him becomming a base officer to degrade him, Reason it selfe derected at the feet of sense, to be a slaue, and a very Baud to sensuall pleasures, a very Broker for dunghill-profits. And what is this but to metamorphose man into a beast? vnlesse that some in a lower degree, liuing only to liue, suffocated with eating, drinking, sleeping, are degenerated into plants? And if he descend not lower, to become torpide and lifelesse, yet doth he participate the imperfections of those things, and that without their perfections, as if with an imperfect retrograde he would returne into his first ele∣ments. What stone so hard as mans heart is relent lesse, remorselesse to his best good? What dust more subiect to the wind, or water more flexible, then he to temptation and sinne? But those things remaine in their nature, or naturall place: Man is a fuming smoake, a passing shadow. And yet if we could stay at our Elements, it were somwhat better, but we are seruants and drudges beneath all names of basenesse, vnbowelling the earth, and our selues in the earth, for a little hardened earth, that neuer had the dig∣nitie to see, no not to be seene of the Sunne. We seeme to rule the Skie, Windes, and Seas; indeed we aduenture our liues to their mercie, and not three fingers thicknesse doth separate vs from death, that we may bring home an idle discourse, or somewhat, almost lesse then nothing, that we call a Iewell. Once, we inuert Nature, subuert o∣thers, peruert our selues, for those things which sometimes kill the bodie, and alway (except a power, with whom all things are possible, preuent) the Soule: And yet Lc.12.20 Thou foole, this night they may fetch away thy Soule; and whose then shall these things be? And whose then, and where then, shalt thou be? Thou gainest faire to lose thy selfe, to be taken with thy taking, to be thus bad to others, that thou mayest be worse to thy selfe: and when as (like an Asse) thou hast been laden all the dayes of thy life with those things, which euen in hauing thou wantedst, now to be more intolerably bur∣thened,
now to be in Hell, which will neuer be satisfied in thee, whose character was before engrauen in thy vnsatiable heart. Tell me not then of the reasonable power of our Soules, whereby we resemble God, seeing that reason may tell thee & me, that by abusing it Ignat. ad Magnes.Epist. Pins homo ru∣misma est à Deo cusum: impius, adulterinum, non à deysed di∣abolo effectum. we are like, & o.8.44. are of our father the deuill. That erected countenance to be still grouelling in, & poring on the earth; that immortal soule to mind only such things as haue not the imperfect priuiledge to be mortall; those high excellēcies to be abused to mischiefe, blaspheming, denying, forswearing God, & all for the basest of the basest creatures. Well might this deluge of corruption moue that Diog.Laer. 1.6. Cynick, in a throng of men to make search for a man, this man which is now left vs being but the ruines, the carkas of himself. But what needs all this? Why are we fallen into so long & tedious discourse of our fall? Euen because some are fallen further, beyond all sense & feeling of their fal, and beleeue not that man was euer any other creature then now they see: that if their goodnes cannot, yet their wickednes might teach them, that so perfect a world should not haue bin framed for so imperfect a wretch, now only perfect in imperfection. Our fall must teach vs to rise, our straying to returne, our degeneration a regeneration. And therfore was not that image of God wholly done out, but some remainder continued to the posteritie, to conuince thē of miserie in themselues, that so denying themselues, they might take vp their Crosse, & follow the second Adam vnto a durable happines. But how (may some aske, as Iul.Pelagian. in August. the Pelagian did) came this miserie tovs? Non peccat ille qui genuit, non peccat ille qui condidit, per quas igitur rimas inter tot praesidia innocentiae fingis peccatum ingressum. Doth it agree with diuine Iustice, that if the fathers haue ea∣ten soure grapes, the childrens teeth should be set on edge? I answere we are heires of our father, we need not seeke some secret craney, we see an open gate, Rom.5.12. by one man sinne entred into the world, and death by sinne. A little leaue let vs borrow to cleare this difficultie. Sinne is 1.Io.3.4. a transgression of the Law, or a defect of conformitie to the Law, and cannot properly be said to haue an efficient, but a defici∣ent cause, being in it owne nature and subsistence, . The Aqu.I.2.q.7I.6. Dorbel. Viguer &c Schoolemen say, in sinne are two things to be considered, the substance and the qualitie, essence and pri∣uation, the act and defect, where of that they call the materiall, this the formall part of sinne, being nothing else but a deformitie, irregularitie, and vnlawfulnesse in our natu∣rall condition and conditions, as easie to be distinguished, though not to be diuided, from the action, as lamenesse from the working hand, or iarring in an Instrument, both from the Instrument and sound. The sinner is tearmed nequam, as nequicquam, naught, as not ought. Not that sinne is simply nothing, Non negatinè sed priuatiuè Nihil, sayth Melancthon Mel.loc.Com. N. hil negatiuum est causa nilhil priuatiui: quaedam sc.inclina∣tio creaturae ad suum illud nihii, vnde primum ortum & crea∣tum est. Mor. de veritate C.R. nor is it a meere and pure priuation, but to be considered with that sub∣iect, wherein and whereof it is such a distortion and destruction:* the want of this con∣sideration draue the Manichees to their hereticall opinion of two beings and begin∣nings. Sinne was first seene in the Deuill, who voluntarily strayed from the right way, and as he abode not in the Truth himselfe, so he beguiled our first Parents, from whome, by the Conduit of Nature, it is conueyed to vs. I speake of originall sinne, which is our inheritance; for actuall sinnes are our own purchase & improuement, and yet bought with that stocke which our parents left vs. Our first parents are to be consi∣dered, not as singularpersons only, whereby they defiled themselues, but as the root of mankind, which had receiued originall righte ousnes, to keepe or to loose to them and theirs as a perpectuall inheritance. As in the Bodie Politike the Act of the Prince is re∣puted the Act of the whole; the consent of a Burgesse in Parliament bindeth the whole Citie which he representeth: and Aqu.in Ro.5. as in the naturall Bodie thé whole Bodie is lyable to the guilt of that fact which the head or hand hath committed: as a root to his braunches, a Fountaine to his streames, doth conuey the goodnesse or badnesse which it selfe hath receiued: So stands it betwixt vs and Adam our naturall Prince, the Burgesse of the World, the Head of this humane Bodie and Generation, the Root and Fountaine of our Humanitie. When he sinned, he lost to himselfe and vs that Image of God, or that part of the Image of God, which he had receiued for himselfe and vs, not the substance, nor the facuities of body or soule, but the conformitie in that
substance and faculties to the will of God, in righteousnesse and holinesse of truth. Not so much therefore are wee here to consider the ordinarie course of Nature, wherein Ezek.18.4. the soule that sinneth, it shall die: as the Ordinance of God, who appointed the first Adam the Well-spring of Nature, which he receiued incorrupted; the second of Grace; that as men, we all by generation are of the first and with the first, Eph.4.22. one old man, in whom we all sinned; of and with the second Adam we are Col.3.10. 1.Co.12. Rom.5 all one new man in the Lord, euen one Bodie, one Spirit, one Seed, one Christ, in whome, and with whome, wee, as members of that Head, obeyed the Precepts, and suffered the Curse of the Law. Persolum pri∣mam pec subtell bo∣num naturz, per alia pecat: bo∣n gratiae perso∣nales. A pe. in Rom.5. Other sinnes of Adam are not our naturall, but his personall, because he could be no longer a publike person, then while he had some what to saue or loose for vs; all being alreadie forfeited in this first Sinne. The Author then of Originall Sinne is the propagator of our Nature: his actuall sinne is originally ours, the Guilt being deriued by impatation, the Corruption by naturall generation. First, that Per∣son corrupted Nature; after, Nature infected our Persons. The matter of this originall corruption, in regard of the subiect, is All and euery man, and all and euery part of all and euery man, subiect to all sinne, that if all be not as bad as any, and the best as the worst, it must be ascribed to Gods restraining, or renewing, not vnto vnequall de∣grees in this originall staine. In regard of the obiect, the matter of it is the want of originall Rightcousnesse, and a contrario inclination to Euill, Gen.6.5. the imagmations of our hearts being onely euill continually. No grapes can grow on these thornes. The forme of this corruption is the deformitie of our corrupted Nature, not by infusion or imi∣tation, but by default of that first instrument, by which this Nature descendeth. It is the root of actuall sinnes: and whereas they, as fruits, are transient, this still remaineth, vntill Christ by his death destroyeth this death in vs. But here ariseth another difficultie; How this sinne can be deriued by Generation, seeing it is truly beleeued, that God is Heb.12.9. the Father of Spirits, the Ecc.12.7. Gen.2.7. Zac.12.1. Former of our Soules, which doth by infusion create, and by creation infuse them: corruptible elements be∣ing vnable to procreate an incorruptible substance, or generation to produce incor∣ruption. Neither standeth it with reason, that he which communicateth not the sub∣stance, should communicate the accidents; or with iustice, that an innocent Soule should necessarily be stained by involuntarie infusion into a polluted bodie. I answere hereunto, That although the Soule be not traducted (as they tearme it) and by generation conferred; yet is it coupled to the bodie in that manner and order which God had appointed for the coniunction thereof, though man had not sinned: Neither was it the Soule alone in Adam, or the bodie alone, but the Person, consisting of both, which sinned. Neither can we be partakers of Natures sinne, till we be par∣takers of Humane Nature, which is not, till the Soule and Bodie be vnited. We are not so much therefore to looke to the concupiscence and lust of the Parents in generati∣on, on, as Lib.Sent.2. Dist .1. 'Lumbard teacheth vs, but to the Person; which, Super sent. Scotus sayth, is filia Adae, & debitrix iustitiae originalis. And although the Soule be not in the Seed, yet is commu∣nicated to the Bodie (sayth Aquinas) by a dispositiue or preparatiue power of the Seed, which disposeth and prepareth the Bodie to the receiuing of the Soule, where it is receiued (after the Vnumquodq, recipitur lecun∣diun modum re∣cipientis. generall rule) according to the measure and nature of that which receiueth. The Father is then a perfect Father, not because he begetteth the Soule, but because he begetteth the Person, or at least all whatsoeuer in the Person is begotten: and though he doth not beget the substance thereof; yet, as it is such a sub∣sistence, he may be said to procreate it, because his generation worketh towards the Vnion of the Soule and Bodie; which Vnion is made by the Spirits, Animall and Vi∣tall. And Zanch. de o∣perib. D. part.3. these Spirits are procreated by the Seed, and consist of a middle nature, as it were betwixt bodily and spirituall: so that the production of the Soule, & incorpo∣rating thereof, may be counted in the middle way betweene Creation & Generation. And therefore this originall corruption did not reach to Christ Iesus, although hee were true Man, because he was the Seed of the woman, and did not descend of Adam by generation (per seminalem rationem, tanquam à principio actiuo, sayth Aquinas) but was
miraculously framed in the wombe, and of the substance of the Virgin, by the power of the Holy Ghost. Thus haue I presumed to offer my crude and rude meditations to the wiser World, about the deriuation of Originall sinne, which it selfe is the cause why we can no bet∣ter see it, as darkenesse hideth it selfe. But the whole Citie of Mankind being here∣with set on fire, it behoueth euery one to be more carefull to quench it, then ouer-cu∣riously to enquire how it came: It is sufficient, that nothing descended hereby to vs by corruption, or was made ours by imputation, which is not fully cured by Christ: who is 1.Cor.1.30. made vnto vs (both by imputation of his actiue and passiue obedience, and by reall infusion of his Spirit) Wisdome, Righteousnesse, Sanctification, and Redemption; if we haue Faith to receiue it, and Charitle to expresse it: an absolute renewer and per∣fecter of the Image of God, beyond what we had in our first Parents lost. CHAP. VI. Of the Reliques of the diuine Image after the fall, whereby naturally men addict themselues vnto some Religion: and what was the Religion of the World before the Floud. THis Sinne of our first Parents, whereby they were almost no sooner made then marr'd (being, as some suppose, formed and deformed in one day; so interpreting the Psalme, Psal.49.12. That he lodged not one night in honour, but became as the beasts that perish. Eroughton out of the Rabbines in his Concent. Perer. in G.1.6. ) This Sinne (I say) did not wholly depriue vs of the Image of God, whereunto we were created. A remainder and stumpe thereof continued, like to the stumpe of 1.Sam.S.4. Da∣gon, whose head and hands were cut off by his fall; or like the stumpe of Dan.4.12. Nabochodo∣nosers Tree, whose rootes were less in the earth, bound with a band of Iron and Brasse among the grasse of the field. So was mans head and hands fallen off before the Arke, that his wisdome remaining was foolishness with God; not sufficient to one good thought, not able either to will or to doe that which might please God. And though the stumpe remained (the substance and the faculties of Bodie and Soule) yet was this stumpe left in the earth, fast bound with Iron and Brasse, his earthly mind captiued and chayned with worldly vanities and diuellish villanies. Or to vse Lumbards comparison, Lib.2.sens. Dist.25. hee was like the man Luc.10.30. fallen among theeues, wounded and spoyled: wounded in his naturall parts, spoyled and robbed of the gifts of grace, which God by especiall grace added to his Nature, in that first beautifying of this his Image. In the state of Creation Man was made 10 Statu, potuit non peccare. 20 Non potest non peccare. 30 Premitur sed non vincitur: nondum habet posse omnize non peccare. 40 Non potest peccare. Lumb. ibid. able to commit no Sinne; in the state of Corruption he cannot but Sinne: vntill a third state of grace doe free him; not from the being, but from the raigning and imputation of Sinne, whereby he is prepared to a fourth state of glorie, wherein shall be no possibilitie of sinning, or necessitie of striuing against sinne. And howsoeuer in this corrupt state of Nature, in our Spiritu∣all actions, which meerely concerne the Kingdome of Heauen, we cannot but sinne, yet hath not God left himselfe without witnesse, euen in this darkenesse to conuince vs of sinne. Such are those notions, sowne by Natures hand in euery of our hearts; according to which euidence, Conscience as a Witnesse, Patron, or Iudge within vs, Rom.2.15. accuseth, excuseth, condemneth, or absolueth; that hereby God may be Rom.3 4. iustified, and all the world inexcusably sinnefull; and that hereby also a way might be left in Gods infinite mercie for mans recouerie. His intent was We must vn∣derstand that God. though in the begin∣ning he suffred man to fal, &c. yet vouchsafed of his goodnes so farre to vp∣hold in him both light of vnderstanding and truth of conscience, as might serue to direct him in some sort for morall and ciuill life, for the preseruation and maintenance of societie a∣mongst men. D.Abbot. Defenc.3. part.pag. 68. not to destroy vs vtterly (as iustly he might, and as it besell the rebellious Angels) but by this punishment to recall vs to subiection; not to breake vs in pieces in his wrath, but by wrath to re∣claime vs to mercie.
Thus Nature suggesteth, Reason conuinceth, and is conuinced, That there is a God: that that God hath created the World (as we before haue shewed) and that for Man: that Man, to whome all things serue, is to serue God, who hath subiected them to him. Doth not Nature teach the sonne to honour his Father, and the ser∣uant his Lord? Mal.1.6. If he then be our Father, where is his honour? if our Lord, where is his feare? Nature inferreth, Reason vrgeth this, and from that ground of Reason doth Scripture reason, the nature whereof in our nature is written. Euen by Reasons Principles wee learne, That so perfect a hand, as made all these inferiour things in such perfection, would not haue beene so imperfect in the perfectest of them all, so to haue left him in the Creation, as we now see him in Corruption. The Morn.de ver. Ch.R. Philoso∣phers saw, Man was a little World, for whome the greater was made, who himselfe was made for more then the World: and that hee, for whome so durable and sub∣stantiall a thing was made, must needes be made for another then this fraile and wretched life; that is, for the euerlasting life with him, that is the Euerlasting. And that is the foundation of all Religion. For what else is Religion, but the Schoole, wherein wee learne mans dutie towards God, and the way to be linked most strait∣ly to him? And what are all the exercises of Religion, but acknowledgements of the Godhead, of the Creation of the World, of the prouident order therein, and ordering thereof, of the Soules immortalitie, of Mans fall and imperfection, of our soueraigne and supreame good to be sought out of our selues? Of all which Nature and Reason are witnesses, not to the learned alone, whose testimonies in this kind may easily be produced, but euen to the societies of men; yea, where as neither Art, nor Industrie, nor ciuill Societie hath bound men as men together, yet the grounds of these things haue bound them as men, by the meere bond of humane Nature, to God, in some or other Religion. God, Man, and Religion, are necessarily linked, as a Father, a Sonne, and Obe∣dience, as a Lender, a Debter, and a Bond. The wit no sooner conceiueth that there is a God, but the will inferreth that he ought to be worshipped. What Phi∣losophers, or what Politicians euer taught the Easterne and Westerne Islands, disco∣uered in this last Age of the World, this necessitie of Religion? And yet (as fol∣loweth in this Historie to be shewed) they which neuer wore clothes on their bo∣dies, neuer furnished their mindes with Arts, neuer knew any Law (besides Reason growne almost lawlesse) or Magistrate, but their Fathers: which, when they saw o∣ther men, coûld not tell whether they were The Indians seeing the Spaniards mounted, thought the horse and man to be all one: they thought them also im∣mortall, and fallen from Heauen. heauenly wights, or earthly monsters, these yet wearied themselues in Superstitions; shewing it easier to put off our selues, then to put the Principles of Religion out of our selues. Yea, among all the Lessons which Nature hath taught, this is deepeliest indented: not Arts, not Policie, nay not Rayment, not Food, not Life it selfe esteemed so deere, and that naturally, to men, as their Religion. Hereof let this Historie ensuing be witnesse, which will shew the Reader, euery where, in manner, ouer the World, this naturall zeale of that which they esteeme Religion, beyond all things else esteemed most na∣turall. Some, in the guiltie conscience of their owne irreligion (as Aesops Fox, that be∣ing by casualtie depriued of his tayle, sought to persuade all Foxes to cut off theirs as vnprofitable burthens) would tell vs that which they Tibi, non sibi: interdu, non noctu. D. King. on onas. cannot tell to themselues, which they dare not tell, but as they dare, whisper, That Religion is but a conti∣nued Custome, or a wiser Policie, to hold men in awe. But where had Custome this beginning? And what is Custome, but an vniforme manner, and continuance of outward Rites? Whereas Religion it selfe is in the heart, and produceth those out∣ward ceremoniall effects thereof. In one Countrey men obserue one habite of at∣tyre, another in another: So likewise of diet: and yet is it naturall to be clothed, more naturall to eat, but naturall most of all, as is said, to obserue some kind of Re∣ligion.
The Grecians He burned their dead parents, the Indians intombed them in their owne bowels: Darius could not by great summes procure the Grecians to the Indi∣an, or these to the Grecian custome: yet was that which moued both, and began ei∣ther custome, one and the same principle of pietie and religious dutie, howsoeuer di∣uersly expressed. Yea euen the most lasciuious, cruell, beastly, and diuellish obserua∣tions, were grounded vpon one principle, That God must be serued: which seruice they measured by their owne crooked rules, euery where disagreeing, and yet mee∣ting in one center, the necessitie of Religion. As for Policie, although it is before answered; yet this may be added, That where∣as men with all threatnings, promises, punishments, rewards, can scarce establish their politicall ordinances; religion insinuateth and establisheth it selfe: yea taketh naturally such rooting, that all politicall lawes and tortures cannot plucke it vp. How many Martyrs Not only the true Religion hath had Mar∣tirs: but Iewish, Turkish, Eth∣nike, Heretical superstitions and idolatries: Haue not our eyes seene Brownists, and Papists, euery where els iar, and yet meete in the halter, whiles one pretence of re∣ligion hath moued thē to commotion, & disturbance of the State? and euen while we write these things, what madde Mar∣tyrs haue we had for Aria∣nisme and o∣ther blasphe∣mies? hath Religion; yea Superstition yeelded? but who will lay downe his life to seale some Polititians authoritie? And so farre is it that Religion should be grounded on Policie, that Policie borroweth helpe of Religion. Thus did Numa fa∣ther his Romane lawes on Aegeria, and other Law-giuers on other supposed Dei∣ties, which had been a foolish argument, and vnreasonable manner of reasoning, to perswade one obscuritie by a greater, had not Nature before taught them religious awe to God, of which they made vse to this ciuill obedience of their lawes, supposed to spring from a Diuine fountaine. Yea the falshoods and varietie of religions are e∣uidences of this Truth; seeing men will rather worship a Beast, stocke, or the basest creature, then professe no religion at all. The Diagoras, Euhemerus, Theodor. Cyren. Philosophers also that are accused of Atheisme, for the most part, did not deny religion simply, but that irreligious religion of the Greekes in idolatrous superstition, Socrates rather swearing by a dogge, or an oke, then acknowledging such Gods. It is manifest then, that the Image of God was by the Fall depraued, but not vtterly extinct; among other sparkes this also being ra∣ked vp in the ruines of our decayed Nature, some science of the God-head, some con∣science of Religion: although the true Religion can be but one, and that which God himselfe teacheth, as the onely true way to himselfe; all other religions being but strayings from him, whereby men wander in the darke, and in labyrinthes of errour: like men drowning, that get hold on euery twig, or the foolish fish that leapeth out of the frying-pan into the fire. Thus God left a sparke of that light couered vnder the ashes of it selfe, which him∣selfe vouchsafed to kindle into a flame, neuer since, neuer after to be extinguished. And although that rule of Diuine Iustice had denounced Gen.2.17. morte morieris, to die, and againe to die a first and second death; yet vnasked, yea by cauilling excuses further prouoked, he by the promised seed erected him to the hope of a first and second re∣surrection; a life of Grace first, and after of Glorie. The Sonne of God is promised to be made the seed of the Woman: the substantiall Colos.1.15. Image of the inuisible God, to be made after the Image and similitude of a Man, to reforme and transforme him againe into the former Image and similitude of God: that he, which in the Phil.2.6. forme of God thought it not robberie (for it was nature) to bee equall with God, should bee made nothing to make vs something, should not spare himselfe that he might spare vs, should become partaker of our Nature, flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone, that he might make vs 2. Pet.1.4. Epbes.5.30. partakers of the Diuine nature, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. This was that seed of the Woman, that hath broken the Serpents head, which by death hath ouercome death, and him that had the power of death. the Diuell, who submitted himselfe to a death in it selfe bitter, before men shamefull, and of God accursed, that hee might bring vs to a life peaceable, glorious, and blessed, beyond what eye hath seene, or heart can conceiue. This promise of this Seed slaine from the beginning of the world, was the seed of all true Religion, the soule of faith, the life of hope, the well-spring of charitie. True it is that all receiued not this promise alike: for a seed of the Serpent was fore-signifi∣ed also, which should bruise the heele of the Womans seed. And this in the first seed
and generation of man soone appeared: Cain and Abel were hereof liuely examples. It appeareth that God had taught Adam and Eue how they should worship him, and they faithfully instructed their children herein: These accordingly Gen. 4. 3. in processe of time brought and offered their sacrifices. As concerning sacrifices, some hold opinion (according to their owne practise) that Perer in Gen. lib 7. Potuit id Abel naturali ratione cogni∣tum habere & tacito quodam naturae instinctu adduci, &c. Nature might teach Adam this way of seruing God: as if Nature were as well able to find the way, as to know that he is out of the way, and were as wel seene in the particular manner, as in the generall necessitie of Religion. We cannot see the Sunne without the Sun, nor come to God but by God, to whom 1.Sam.15. 22. Obedience is better then sacrifice, and to harken, better then the fat of Rammes. Abel, saith the Scripture, Hebr.11.4. offered by faith, without which faith it is impossible to please God: but faith hath necessarie relation Rom.10.17. to the word of God, who otherwise will be Esay 1.14. wearie of our solemnities, and asketh, who hath required them at our hands. These sacrifices also, besides that they were acknowledgements of their thankefulnes, and reall confessions of their sin and death, due to them therfore, did lead them by the hand to Christ that Lambe of God that should take away the sins of the world, figured by these slaine beasts, confirming their faith in the promise and hope of the accomplishment: of which Nature could not once haue dreamed, which hath rather, The mystery of our redemp∣tion by Christ is meerely su∣pernaturall: the impression of some confused notions, that we haue lost the way and ought to seek it, then either light to discerne it, or wisdome to guide vs in it. Of sacrificing there were from the beginning two kinds, the one called Gifts or oblations of things without life: the other Victims (so our Rhemists haue taught vs to English the word Victimae) slaine sacrifices of birds and beasts: Againe, they were propitiatorie, consecratorie, Eucharisticall, and so forth, whose kinds and rites Mo∣ses hath in his bookes, especially in Leuiticus, so plainely declared, that I should but powre water into the sea, or light a candle to the Sun, to dilate much of them: these being the same in signification with the Leuiticall, and little (if little) differing in the manner of doing. Cain brought his offering, being an husbandman, of the fruit of the ground, Abel a shepheard, of the fattest of his sheepe: God respected ABEL and his offering, (the tree first, and then the fruit, the worker, and then the worke) which he signified either by voice, or by Hieron. Tra∣dit. Heb. in Gen. fire from heauen, according to Theodotions transla∣tion, Inflammauit super. as in the sacrifices of Aaron, Gideon, Manoah, Dauid, Salomon, Elias: or by some other meanes, both comfortable to Abel and enuied of Cain, who therefore slue him; thus in this member bruising the heele of that blessed seed, as a type of that which the head himselfe should after sustaine. Here is the first Apostasie after that first Euangelicall promise, and the first diuision of Religion, Cain being the first builder of the Aug. de ciu. Dei, lib.15.c.5. Earthly Citie, not that which he cal∣led after the name of his sonne, Gen. 4.17. Henoch, but of that spirituall citie of the wicked, the seed of the Serpent, which he founded in his brothers bloud: euen as that later Compendium thereof, which calleth herselfe Caput mundi, the head of the world (and indeed John. 17.6.9. 16. &c. the World is vsually in Scripture applied to that seed of the Serpent, as it is opposed to the seed of the Woman) was by Romulus her first founder by like example of fratricide in the murther of Remus, dedicated (as it were) to the future mysterie of iniquitie, the seat of the Beast, and of the Whore, (by whose authoritie, Christ him∣selfe was slaine) drunken after with the bloud of his Saints: and still breathing bloud and slaughter, to euery Abel that will not communicate in her spirituall whoredomes; that will not with her offer the fruits of the ground (the sacrifice of Cain) which neither came from heauen, nor can guide to heauen, being earthly, sensuall, diuellish. Cain was for this his fact conuented by that All-seeing Iustice, who both by open sentence and inward terrors accused & accursed him, continuing his life, euen for the same cause that other murtherers lose it, that he might liue an example (which then in that vnpeopled world by his death he could not haue been) to the future generati∣ons, branded Some thinke this marke to be a shaking of all the bodie, as fearing continually, Perer. also by the Lord with some sensible marke, to exempt him, and terrifie others, from that bloudie crueltie: this mercie being mixed with this iudgement, a
longer time of repentance. God before Gen.3. 17. cursed the earth for Adam, he now Gen 4. 11. cur∣sed Cain from the earth, to be a runnagate, and wanderer thereon. For how could hee that had so forsaken God, but be forsaken of the earth and of himselfe? the Vt slādo Vesta vocatm. Ouid. stable and mercifull earth, which before had opened her mouth to receiue his brothers bloud, shrinking, and (as it were) grudging to support such wicked feet, and by de∣nying him her strength, forcing him to his manifold shifts and shiftlesse remouings; wretched man alwayes bleeding his brothers bloud, not daring to looke vp to hea∣uen, fearing to looke downe to hell, the world without him threatning a miserable life, his bodie branded to contempt and shame till his death, his soule become a stage of Anguish, Feare, Horrour, and other Furies, the harbingers of hell: not able to suffer (which yet he cannot but suffer) the guilt of passed wickednesse gnawing him, the waight of present miserie pressing him, the dread of a death, and a death atten∣ding him: restlesse in himselfe, hated of the world, despairing of reliefe from God: a liuely map of the deadly and damnable state of sin and sinners, (without Christ) dead whiles they liue, mouing sepulchers, the Deuils captiues, hels heires, exiled from heauen, and vagabonds on the earth, euen on that which they call their owne land. Cain, more vexed with the punishment, then at the fault of his sinne, departed from the presence of the Lord, which is meant either of his iudiciall conuenting him, or Caluin. in Gen. Martyr. in Gen. Chrysost.hom. 20. in regard of the visible societie of the Church, cradled yet in his fathers houshold, where God did especially shew his present prouidence, protection and grace, who otherwise filleth the heauen and earth, of whom and in whom they are: from hence, as Adam before out of Paradise, so Cain was, as it were, excommunicated, expelled, and out-lawed, and dwelt in the land of Nod, which Hieron. Heb. Trad. some take to be appellatiuely spoken, as if his misery had giuen name of Mouing vnto the place where he dwelled, or roamed rather: Antiq. lib.1.cap.2. Iosephus saith, he built Naida, applying it to a proper place, which was either Eastward from Eden, or Eastward towards Eden from Canaan, where A∣dam is supposed to haue dwelt, and after with his wife to haue been buried at He∣bron. Afterward, his posteritie being multiplied (his wife, Epiphan. out of Leptogenesis calleth Shaue, F. Comest. hist. Schol. Comestor calleth her Chalmana, Pseudo-Philo in antiq. Bibl. Philo, Themech) he built a city which he called by the name of his sonne Psendo-Bero∣sus nameth the citie Oenus by Libanus. Henoch: to crosse that curse of his wandring to and fro on the earth, or to arme him against others, which his guiltie conscience caused him to feare, or to be a receptacle & store-house of those spoiles, which Iosephus saith he robbed from others by violence, when as the earth was barren to him. Philo (if we may so entitle that Author) which hath written of the antiquities of the Bible, ascri∣beth to him other cities, Mauli, Leed, Tehe, Iesca, Celet, Iebbat, adding that he liued 730. yeares. These things may be probable, although that Author be otherwise fa∣bulous, considering that men did ordinarily liue many hundred yeares in those times, and were also exceeding fruitfull, especially after that Polygamy was embraced of that family. And if that in Abrahams posterity the seed of Iacob in lesse then 300. yeares was multiplied to so 600000. men of warre. great a people, it is like that the Cainites were no Joseph. saith that Lamech had 77. chil∣dren. lesse po∣pulous, liuing in more freedome. He first (saith Iosephus) found out weights and mea∣sures, and assigned proprieties in possessions of land, before common as the aire and light, & was author to lewd persons, of a lewd and vngodly life. Probable it is that the city was called Henoch, because the curse suffered not the father to stay in a place, but to leaue a hasty inheritance to his son to finish and rule it. Iabal and Iubal and Tubal∣cain, were inuenters of Arts: the first to dwell in tents and keepe cattell; the second of musicall instruments: the third of working in mettals, and making of armour, which some thinke to be Vulcan; by the neerenesse of name and occupation. Thus let vs leaue this family multiplying in numbers, in sciences, in wickednes, sa∣uoring nothing diuine, or at least nothing but humane in their Diuinity: (therfore cal∣led the sons of men, Gen. 6.I.2.) let vs looke backe to Adam, who in this wicked fruit of his body might reade continuall lectures of repentance for the sin of his soule. A∣dam begat a child in his owne likenes, that is, not in that likenes of God wherein he was created, but like vnto himselfe both in humane nature, and naturall corruption,
his name he called Seth, of whose posterity the whole world was by Noah repeopled. Vnto Seth was borne Enosh: Then began men saith MOSES, to call vpon the name of the Lord. This some Broughton. Concent. Martyr in Gen. interpret of the beginning of idolatry, that men began to prophane the name of the Lord: some to call the name of the Lord, that is, after Rabbi Salomo, to apply the name of God to Images, Stars and men: But the more likely opinion is, that when Adam had obtained a more holy posterity, which was now multiplied in diuers families, Luther. in Genes. Tremell. Vatablus, Cal∣uin. in Genes. Perer. in Genes. lib.7. Religiō which before had bin a priuate in-mate in Adams houshold, was now brought into publike exercise. whereof Prayer hath alwaies bin accounted a principal part, & God himselfe in both Testaments calleth his house a house of prayer; the calues of the lips, & the eiaculations of the heart being the body and soule of Di∣uine worship, whereof sacrifices were in a manner but the apparell, fashioned to that infancie of the Church. Of the names of the posterity of Adam, & his hundred yeares mourning for Abel of Sheth his remouing after Adams death to a mountaine neere Paradise, and such other things, more sauouring of fabulous vanity, in the false-named Methodij Re∣ueat. Philo de Antiq. Methodius, Philo and others that follow them, I list not to write. CHAP. VII. Of the cause, and comming of the Floud. THus we haue seene in part the fulfilling of the Prophecie of the seed of the Woman, & of that other of the Serpēt, in the posterity of Cain & Seth. The family of Cain is first reckoned, and their forwardnes in hu∣mane Arts, as Luke 16. 8. the children of this world are wiser in their generation, in the things of this life which they almost only attend, then the children of light. As for the Martyr. in Gen ex Rab. Salom. Iewish dreames, that Lamech was blind, & by the direction of Tu∣balcain his son guiding his hand slew Cain, supposing it had bin a wilde beast, which, when he knew, so enraged him, that he killed his son also, they that list may follow. Moses reckoneth the Generations according to the first-borne in the posteritie of Seth, as enioying the Principality & Priesthood, that so the promised seed of the Wo∣man (after such a world of yeares comming into the world) might iustify the stablènes of Gods promises, his lineall descent from Adam with a due Chronologie being de∣clared. After Seth Enosh, Kenan, Mehalaleel, I ared, was Henoch the seuenth from Adam who walked with God whom God tooke away that he should not see death. This before the Law, & Helias in the Law, are witnesses of the resurrection; being miraculously taken from the earth into heauen, not by death, but by supernaturall changing of their bo∣dies. That he should be still in Bella. tom 1. coat 3. lib 3. c. 6. an earthly Paradise, & that he and Elias should come and preach against Antichrist, and of him be slaine, is a Popish dreame: the Scripture He 1. 5. &c. saying, that Henoch was taken away that he should not see death; of Elias that he is Luke 7. 27. Ma. 17. 12. al∣ready come in the person of IOHN Baptist: the spirit & power, or spirituall power of wal∣king with God, reforming religion and conuerting soules, being communicated to many of those Ministers which haue lien slaine in the streets of that Great citie. This his assumption is Gib. ex Rab. Aba, Racanat∣i, Targum. supposed to be visibly done, He was a Prophet, and Iude doth in his Epistle cite a testimony of his Perer lib. 7. in Gn. thin∣keth that Iude knew of this prophecie by Reuelation, and reuealed the same to the Church. which either by Perk. Refor. Cathol. tradition went frō hand to hād, as it seemeth the whole word of God was deliuered before the daies of Moses; God by visions & dreames appearing vnto the Patriarks: or els it was written & since is lost. Some hold it was penned by some Iew vnder the name of Enoch. De Ciuit. Dei lib. 15. cap. 23. Augustine thinketh that the book, entitled Enoch, was forged in his name, as other Writings vn∣der the names of Prophets & Apostles: & therfore calleth it Apocripha (as Eò quòd earū Scripturarum accuta origonon clarait patribus. In his autem A∣pocrypbis etsi in∣uenitur aliqua veritas, tamen propter multa falsa nulla est canonica authoritas. Hier. in Tit. c. . Hierome doth also) Chrysost. Hons. in Matth. 1. Chrysostome and Theophilact account Moses the first Pen-man of holy ly Scripture. Although it seeme that letters were in vse before the floud, if Antiq. lib. 1. cap. 2. Iosephus his testimony be true, who affirmeth that Adam hauing prophecied two vniuersal de∣structiōs, one by fire, another by water, his posterity erected two pillars; one of brick, another of stone, in both which they writ their inuētions of Astronomy: that of stone was reported to remain in his time. Plin. lib.7. cap.56. Pliny was of opinion that letters were eternall.
Howsoeuer, it is more then apparant, that the booke bearing Enochs name, is very fabulous, which, because the tables therein professe antiquitie (although they were later dreames) I thought it not vnfit to borrow out of Not. in Eu∣seb. Chron. pag. 244. Frag. Graec. ex lib. 1. Enoch. Scaliger somewhat of that which he hath inserted, in his notes vpon Eusebius, the Greeke copie being as the phrase testifieth, translated out of Hebrew, which had been the worke of some Iew: the antiquitie appeareth in that Tertull. de ldololat. Tertullian citeth it. And it came to passe when the sonnes of men were multiplied, there were borne to them faire daughters, and the Watch-men (so he calleth the Angels, out of Dan.4.) lusted and went astray after them: and they said One to another, This fable a∣rose of the false interpre∣tation of Moses words. Gen.6. 12. The sonnes of God, &c. Let vs chuse vs wiues of the daughters of men of the earth. And Semixas their Prince said vnto them, I feare vie you will not do this thing, and I alone shall be debter of a great sinne. And they all answered him and said: We will all sweare with an oath, and will Anathematise or Curse our selues not to al∣ter this our mind till we haue fulfilled it. and they all sware together. These came downe in the dayes of lared to the top of the hill, Hermon. And they called the hill, Hermon, because they sware and Anathematised on it. These were the names of their Rulers, Semixas, Atarcuph, Arachiel, Chabahiel, Orammame, Ramiel, Sapsich, Zakiel, Balkiel, Azalzel, Pharmaros, Samiel. &c. These tooke them wiues, and three generations were borne vnto them. The first were great Giants: The Giants begate the Naphehin, to whom were borne Eliud: And they taught them and their wiues sorceries and inchantments. Ezael taught first to make swords, and weapons for warre, and how to worke in mettals. He taught to make womens ornaments, and how to looke faire, and Iewelling. And they beguiled the Saints: and much sinne was committed on the earth. Other of them taught the vertues of Roots, Astrologie, Diuinations, &c. After these things the Giants began to eate the flesh of men, and men were diminished: and the remnant cried to heauen, because of their wickednesse, that they might come in remembrance before him. And the foure great Archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Vriel hearing it; looked downe on the earth from the holy places of heauen: and beholding much bloud shed on the earth, and all vngodlinesse and transgression committed there∣in, said one to another, That the Spirites and Soules of men complaine, saying, That yee should present our prayer to the Highest, and our destruction. And the foure Archangels entring, said to the Lord, Thou art God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, &c. Thou seest what Exael hath done, he hath taught mysteries, and reuealed to the world the things in heauen, &c. Then the Highest said, The Holy one, the Great one spake and sent Vriel to the sonne of Lamech, saying, Go to, Noe, tell him of the end approching, and a flould shall destroy the earth, &c. To Raphael, he said, Go Raphael and bind Exael hand and foot, and cast him into darknesse, and open the wildernesse in the desert of Dodoel, and there cast him, and lay vpon him sharpe stones to the day of Iudgement, &c. And to Gabriel he said, Go Gabriel to the Giants, and destroy the sons of the Watch-men from the sons of Men, set them one against another in warre and destruction. To Michael he said, Go Michael, bind Semixa and the others with him that haue mixed themselues with the daughters of Men, (vntill seuentie genera∣tions) to the hils of the earth; vntill the day of their iudgement, till the iudgement of the world be finished, and then they shall be brought into the confusion of fire, and vnto triall, and vnto the prison of the ending of the world, and whosoeuer shall bee condemned and destroyed, from hence-forth shall bee cast together with them till the finishing of their generation. &c. And the Giants which were begotten of the spirits and flesh, they shall call them euill spirits on the earth, because their dwel∣ling is on the earth. The spirits that depart out of their bodies shall be euil spirits, be∣cause they were engendred of the Watchmen and Men. But it were tedious to recite further. The antiquitie of it, and because it is not so common, and especially because Inseph. Antiq. lib. 1. Iustin. Ter∣tull. Athenag. Cyprian. La∣ctantius, Euseb. Hugo de S.Vic. Strabus, Bur∣gensis, Sulpitius Seuer. sac. hist. lib. 1. This fable of Angels, &c. the Saracens also retaine. see lib. 3. cap.5. some of the Ancients, and of the Papists haue bin misse-led by these dreames, (refused iustly by Ierome and Augustine) interpreting the sonnes of God in Moses to be spoken of Angels (as their Translation did reade it)
haue moued me to insert those tables. Notable is the diligence of the Purgatory Sca∣uengers, who in Vines notes vpon Aug. de Ciuit. Dei. lib. 15. cap. 23. haue in their Index expurgatorius, set the seale of their Office vpon a testimonie alleaged out of Eu∣sebius de Praep. Euang. lib. 5. cap. 4. as if they had been Vines owne words, to be left out in the impression. The words, because they sauour of the former error, haue I heere placed. Non ergo deos, neque bonos daemonaes Gentiles, sed perniciosos solummodo vene∣rantur. Quam rem magis Plutarchus confirmat, dicens fabulosas de dijs rationes res quasdam significare, à daemonibus antiquissimis gestas temporibus, & ca quae de giganti∣bus ac de Titanibus decantantur, daemonum fuisse operationes. Vnde mihi suspicio (saith Eusebius, but Vines is fined for it) nonnunquam incidit, ne ista illa sint, quae ante diluui∣um à gigantibus fact a diuin a Scriptura tetigit, de quibus dicitur: Cùm autem vidissent Angels Dei filias hominum, quia essent speciosae, elegerunt sibi ex illis vxores, ex quibus procreats sunt famosissimi gigantes à saeculo. Suspicabitur enim fortasse quispiam, illos & illorum spiritus esse qui ab hominibus postea dij putati sunt, pugnasque illorum, tumultus & bella esse quae fabulose de dijs conscribebantur. Lactantius lib. 2. cap. 15. saith, that when the world was multiplied, God sent Angels to keepe men from the frauds of the Di∣uell, to whom he forbad all earthly contagion. These were by the Diuell insnared with women, therefore depriued of heauen: and their progenie of a middle nature betwixt men and Angels, became vncleane spirits: so that hence grew two kinds of Daemones or diuellish spirits; the one heauenly, the other earthly, which would now seeme to be keepers, and are destroyers of men. The Angels are sometimes called Iob 1.6. and 38.7. the sonnes of God: but that name is commu∣nicated to men, who Ephes. 2.3. by Nature children of wrath, by faith in the naturall and one∣ly begotten Sonne of God, haue this prerogatiue to be the sonnes of God, and fel∣low-heires with Christ. But some of the children of the kingdome shall be cast out, because they haue rebelled against their Father that begot them, professing them∣selues to be the sonnes of God, but Iob. 8.44. doe the workes of their father the Diuell: and of these Hypocrites and Apostataes, it is said, that louing pleasure more then God, they matched themselues in Cains familie, a prouocation so mightie to euill, that strong Sampson and wise Salomon are witnesses, that Prou.7.26. the strong men are slaine by this wea∣ker sexe. This was the Serpents policie at first, Balaams policie after, Babels policie now; Sheldon in his Motiues ob∣serueth these marriages to be a great meane for propagating Poperie. and Balaams wages doe moue many still to make such linsey-woolsey mar∣riages, that the Nehem. 13.24. children speake halfe Ashdod, and whilest the father professeth one religion, the mother another, the children become Giants, to fight against all that is called God, and to make little or no profession (at least in their liues) of any religion at all. I deny not that then there were Giants also in regard of bodily stature, Gibbins in Genes. whom the Scripture calleth, because they were great and fearefull, Rephaim and Emim, of their pride Hanakim, of their strength Gibborim, of their tyrannie Nephilim, of their naughtinesse Zamzummim. Such were Og and Goltah after the floud. Yea such haue been in all ages: which (to omit other Ethnike Authors) De Ciuit. Dei. lib.15. cap. 9. Augustine affirmeth, that at Vtica he saw a mans tooth as great as an hundred of the ordinarie sise. Viues on that place, saith hee saw one as bigge as a mans fist. Nicephorus telleth of two men in the time of Theodosius, the one not so admirable for his height which was fiue cu∣bites and an hand, as the other for his smalnesse, like to a Partrich in bignesse, yet wittie and learned. Our Histories of Giral. Camb. Hector. Boct. Camden Brit. Arthur, Little Iohn, Curcy Earle of Vlster, and one in our times, 1581. seene in London, do shew some such here and there, now and then in the world, which Goropius in his Giganto machia, affirmeth of his owne sight: and euen whole families of these monstrous men are found at this day in America, both neere to Virginia, as Mappe of Virginia. Captaine Smith reporteth, and especially about the Straits of Magellan, Pigasetta. neere which he found Giants, and in the same Straits were such seene of the Oluer Noort. and Sebastian de Weert. Hollanders ten foot in height, where as yet other families were but of the ordinary greatnes. One Thomas Turner told me that neere the Riuer of Plate he saw one twelue foot high, and others whose hinder part of their head was flat, not
round. Il. Capitol. Herodianus. Authors tell of Maximinus the Romane Emperour, that he was eight foote and a finger high, whose wiues bracelets might serue him for rings, that he often in one day drunke an Amphora, which is almost six gallons of wine, and eate fortie pounds of flesh: Cordus saith sixtie; he could breake a horse legge, or strike out his teeth with a blow of his fist, &c. Which occurrents in Nature no doubt haue giuen occasion to some of further sabling: Qui de magnis maiora loquuntur. Plin. lib.7. cap.16. We reade in Pliny of one of forty six cubits, in Crete, foūd by the force of an earth-quake, breaking the hill wherein he stood, supposed to be Orion or Otus: more credible is that he tel∣leth of one Gabbora in Claudius time, nine foot and nine inches; and in Augustus time of another halfe a foot higher. Howsoeuer the bodies of these men before the Floud were composed, certaine their minds were disposed to all monstrous inhumanity which hastened their destru∣ction. This made God to repent that he made man vpon the earth, not that there was any change or repentance in him; but because a change for want of repentance hap∣pened to them. In long sufferance hee gaue them an hundred and twentie yeares space, in which Noah might bee a Preacher of righteousnesse; yea the Arke it selfe, which Noah that while was prouiding, might preach to them repentance, that their teares might haue quenched his wrath, and preuented temporall drowning, and eter∣nall burning. Adam liued till Henochs time, a witnesse and Preacher of the promise he himselfe had receiued. Henoch himselfe is made, not a verball, but a reall Preacher, whiles his sonne Methushelah, and his Nephew Lamech the father of Noah liued: that God might haue witnesses to conuert some and conuince others. But whiles the world becommeth worse and worse, ( Horat. Carm. Aetas parentum peior auis tulit Hos nequiores, mox daturos Progeniem vitiosiorem) a deluge of sinne first, and a deluge of iudgement after, drowned the world. For the circumstances of the Floud Moses hath more plainely related them, then that I should heere expresse them. Noah with his three sonnes, and their wiues, en∣tered the Arke at Gods appointment, to which by Diuine instinct resorted both birds and beasts; of the cleane seuen, and of the vncleane two in euery kind. If any maruell at this distinction of cleane and vncleane in these times, supposing that God first in the wildernesse made this partition-wall: it is answered, that God before this had appointed sacrifices of beasts, which might make the difference, for which cause also there was a seuenth of euery such creature, reserued for sacrifice after No∣ahs going out. Besides, God had now purposed to adde the flesh of beasts vnto mans diet, for which those, called by the Isaelites cleane, were most fit, and most in vse: and in that respect more of such kindes were reserued, as more necessarie for mans vse in food, cloathing, and some of them also for labour. Otherwise No creature is vncleane in it selfe, the Hoofe and Cudde being by Nature (Gods hand-maid) and not by their owne vice, such, as made this distinction. And after the Floud God made no Law of Difference vntill the time of Moses, although each countrey hath obserued their owne peculiar custome in this food, some loathing that which o∣thers esteemed daintie, not for religion, but for naturall and ciuill causes. As at this; day to the Tartars, Horse-flesh is royall sare; to the Arabians, Camels; to some Ame∣ricans, Serpents; and other flesh to others: which our appetite, more then our faith, our stomacke, more then our soule; abhorreth. Concerning the Arke, diuers doubts haue beene moued, through curiositie and vnbelesse, of some, who by diuine iustice were in a manner depriued of sense and reason, hauing before, through diuellish wickednesse, lost their conscience and Re∣ligion. Thus Orig. bom. in Genes.2. Apelles one of Marcions disciples, could not finde the Arke (af∣ter Moses dimension) to bee capable of foure Elephants in so small a quantitie; Celsus, contrarie to him (yet agreeing in a foolish impietie and impious folly) thought so great a vessell was too great for mans handy-worke. Thus, like Sampsons foxes their heads are diuers waies, but they are tied together by the tailes, agreeing in disagreeing both from Moses and themselues.
But might not reason teach Celsus, that the direction of God might teach a man in an hundred and twentie yeares space to frame so mightie a Fabrike? doth not sense and experience shew buildings not much lesse both on the sea and on the land? And what Arithmeticke or Geometrie, nay what witte or common sense, had A∣pelles in his assertion? The Arke was too little (forsooth) for so many creatures and their prouision for a yeare. We neede not seeke for shifts from helpe of the Geometricall cubite knowne to Moses in his Aegyptian learning, of three, sixe or nine foote to the cubite; as Origen and Hugo de Arca Noae, lib. 1. Hugo doe: nor of the sacred cubite, imagined twice as much as the common: nor of the larger stature and cubites of of men in those youthfull times and age of the world. The length whereof three hundred cubites, and the breadth fiftie, do make of square measure by common rules of Art, fifteene thousand cubites. Three floores or roomes were therein of that quantitie, each containing ten foote in height. As for the beastes; a floore of fif∣teene thousand cubites might yeeld fiftie cubites seuare to three hundred seuerall kindes, many more then are knowne by relation of the most Writers, Aristotle, Pliny, Gesner, &c. which scarce reckon halfe that number, and but fortie kindes or thereabouts, that would take vp any great roome. The height might yeeld commodious roomes for the fowles on perches: and all this might one roome or floore afford. Iudge then whether two other roomes, of equall bignesse, might not bee sufficient for all other necessarie employments? Besides, the roofe is not to bee thought vnproportionable, fitted for so long and tempestuous stormes, and there∣fore not vnfitted with roome for diuers necessaries. And if any accuse mee for ad∣ding this of the roofe to Moses description, I say that so it is translated by Tremel. & Iunins. some, Et in cubits longitudinens consummato eius tectum supornè, vnderstanding those words not of the window (as many doe) but of the roofe it selfe, which else is no where described, which should ouer-hang the Arke a cubite breadth, to defend it the sa∣fer from raines; as in our houses the eues and slope roofes are commodious both for roome within, and against the weather without. But if any would entertaine longer dispute about this, hee may (among others that haue handled this que∣stion) resort vnto Beccesel. An∣tiq. Antuerp. Goropius Becanus his Gigantomachia, whom in this point I would rather follow, then in many other his Becceselanicall paradoxes. Noah and his family with this their retinue being entered, the fountaines of the great deepes were opened, and the windowes of Heauen: the two store-houses of waters which God had separated in the Creation, being in a manner confoun∣ded againe, the Seas breaking their sandie barres, and breaking vp by secret vnder∣minings the priuie pores and passages in the earth: the cloudes conspiring with the waters, and renuing their first league and naturall amitie, to the confusion of Nature and the World. The heauenly lights hid their faces from beholding it, and cloathed themselues with blacke, as bewailing the worlds funerall; the aire is tur∣ned into a sea, the sea possesseth the airie region, the earth is now no earth but a mi∣rielumpe, and all that huger world is contracted into a brife Epitome, and small a∣bridgement in the Arke, euen there but a few inches distant from death. Thus doe all Rom. 8. 20. Creatures detest Sin which hath made them subiect to Vanitie; thus would the Elements wash themselues cleane from it, and the committers thereof: but the Arke preuaileth ouer the preuailing waters, a figure of the Church, the remnant of the el∣der, and Seminarie of the new World. This drowning of the world hath not beene quite drowned in the world, but besides Moses, many other writers haue mentioned it: the time thereof being referred to that which in each Nation was accounted most ancient; as among the Thebans to Ogiges; in Thessalia, to Deucalion; among the Americans (although De Fab. Mundi. Mercator thinke that the Floud drowned not those parts, because they were not yet peopled, and because the beastes there are most-what differing kinds from these in our world) the people haue retained the tradition hereof: Mnaseus among the Phoenicians, Berosus a Chaldaean, Hieronimus Aegyptius, Nicolaus of Damascus,
the Poets Greeke and Latine, adding fables to the truth (which without some ground of truth they could not haue added) all mention the Floud; howsoeuer con∣founding the lesse and later with this first and vniuersall. I might adde the testimonies of Eupolemus, Molon, Abidenus, Alexander Po∣lyhistor, out of Eusebius, Iosephus, and others. Lucian in his Dea Syria, telleth the opinion of the Hierapolitans but a little corrupted from Moses Narration: that Countrey wherein Noah liued, most likely retaining firmer memorie of this mira∣cle: so plainely doth he attribute to his Deucalion the Arke, the resort and safegard of the Lions, Bores, Serpents, and Beastes: the repairing of the World after the drowning thereof, which he ascribeth to periurie, crueltie, and other abominations of the former people. That Berosus, which we now have, is not so much as the ghost, or carkasse, and scarce a few bones of the carkasse of that famous Chaldean Author, mentioned by the Ancients, but the dreames of Annius, (no new thing in this last age) coined for the most part in his name. Some fragments of Berosus wee haue ci∣ted in other Authors that conuince this Bastard. Among others, somewhat of the Floud hath escaped drowning: his testimonie whereof, set downe in Polyhistor and Abidenus, is in Euseb. Chron. Grac. Scasig. lib 1 & de Prae∣par. lib. 9. Eusebius. Hee affirmeth that Saturne gaue warning to Sisuthrus of this deluge, and willed him to prepare a great vessell or shippe, wherein to put conuenient food, and to saue himselfe and his kin∣dred, and acquaintance, which hee builded of length fiue furlongs, of bredth two. After the retiring of the waters, he sent out a bird which returned: after a few dayes he sent her forth againe, which returned with her feet bemired: and being sent the third time, came no more: with other things to like purpose, which Polyhistor there, and Abidenus, citeth out of Berosus. Plut arch hath also written of this Doue, sent out by Dencalion. Plut. de animantium comparatione. CHAP. VIII. Of the re-peopling of the world: and of the diuision of Tongues and Nations. NOw Genes. 8.1. GOD remembred NOAH, saith Moses; not that God can forget, but that hee declared his Diuine power, whereby Noah might know hee was not forgotten. Then did the Hos. 2. 21. 22. Heauensre∣member their wonted influence in the Elements: then did the Ele∣ments remember their naturall order: GOD made awinde to passe in commission, and, as a common vmpire, to end their vnnaturall strife, forcing the waters into their ancient precincts aboue and beneath the firma∣ment. (Ambrose interpreteth this Winde of the HOLY GHOST, lib. de No. Ru∣pertus lib. 4. of the Sunne. The most, of winde, which yet naturally could not bee produced from that waterie masse, but by the extraordinary hand of God Perer. in Genes. lib. 13. .) Then did the Earth remember her first inheritance, being freed from the tyrannicall inua∣sion and vsurpation of the waters. And what could then forget or bee forgotten, when GOD remembred NOAH and all that was with him in the Arke? And in the An. Mund. 1656. the Floud. seuenth moneth, the seuenteenth day of the moneth, the Arke rested vpon the Mountaines of Ararat. This fell out in the yeare from the Creation 1656. The After the Sept. 2242. and after the most ancient copies 2262. Scalig. Septuagint, and the Fathers that followed them, reckon farre otherwise: which errour of theirs, differing from the Hebrew veritie, De Ciu. Dei. lib. 15. cap. 11. & dein. ad 13. Augustine ascribes to the first Copiers of that Translation: Iunius. Broughton. Others to their owne set purpose, that they might contend with other Nations in the challenge of Antiquitie: for that cause,
and lest the often halfing of ages should trouble the faithlesse, saith Master Broughton, they faine Cainan, betwixt Arphaxad and Selah: in which account if Luke 3. 36. Luke in his Genealogie hath followed them, it is to be ascribed to them which would cor∣rect Luke by their corrupt translation of the Septuagint, for Bza annot. Luc. 3. some copies of the Gospell haue wanted it. The place is commonly thought to be Armenia. Gt. Bec. In∣doicytbica. pag. 473. Goropius after his wont paradoxicall, holdeth it to be the hill Paropanisus, or Paropamisus, a part of the hill Taurus (vnproperly ascribed to Caucasus, which riseth betweene the Euxine and Hircan sea) supposed the highest part of the earth, called now, M.Paul.Ven Nau∣gracot. He imagined, that the place first inhabited after the Floud was Margiana, whence those Colonies passed that with Nunrod built Babylon. His reason is, because Genes. 11. 2. they went from the East to the Plaine of Shinar, whereas Armenia beareth some∣what Eastward from thence. As though that iourney had beene presently after the Floud, which was an hundred yeares after: in which space it is likely that they followed the Mountainous countries Eastward a long time, and from Assyria Adi∣abena, turned backe into that fertile Plaine, where pride, fulnesse of bread, and abundance ofidlenesse, set them on worke against GOD. I hold it not meete, that a few coniectures should counterpoise the generall consent of all ages. Iosephus saith, the place in Armenia was called Apobaterion, of this their going forth of the Arke: and alleageth Berosus testimonie, that a part of this Arke was then said to remaine in the Cordyaean (or Gordyaean) hilles, the pitch whereof some scraping away, wore the same for Amulets. And out of Nich. Damascenus, lib. 96; There is (saith hee) aboue the region of the Minyae, a great hill in Armenia, by name Baris, wherein, they say, many saued themselues in the time of the Floud, and one, brought in an Arke, there stayed (the remnants of the wood thereof continuing there long time after) which happily was hee that Moses the Iewish Law-giuer writ of. This mountaine or mountainous Region the Chaldean Paraphrast calleth Tremel. & Inn. Annot. Kar∣du; Curtius, Cordaei montes; Ptolomaeus, Gordiaei: the people are called Cardyaei or Gordyaei. In this Tract (saith Epiphan.) lib. 1. contra Haeres. there is one high mountaine called Lubar, which signifieth the descending place (Lubar in the Armenian and Egyptian language signifying the same that  before mentioned) and the word Baris before cited out of Damascenus seemeth to bee corruptly written for Lubaris. The Armenians through all ages haue (as it seemeth) reserued the memorie here∣of: and euen Cartwrights Trauels. in our dayes there standeth an Abbey of Saint Gregories Monkes neere to this hill, which was able to receiue The Persian King. Shaugh Thamas and a great part of his armie. These Monkes, if any list to beleeue them, say that there remaineth yet some part of the Arke, kept by Angels: which, if any seeke to ascend, carrie them backe as farre in the night, as they haue climbed in the day. Cartwright, an eye-witnesse, saith that this hill is alwayes couered with snow; at the foot thereof issue a thousand springs; there are adioyning three hundred Villages of the Armenians. Hee saith also that there are seene many ruinous foundations sup∣posed to bee the workes of this first people, that a long time durst not aduenture in∣to the lower countries for feare of another Floud. In Chron. Graec. Eusebij & praeparat. E∣uang. lib. 9. cap. 4. Abidenus saith, that the Ship or Arke was still in Armenia (in his time) and that the people vsed the wood thereof a∣gainst many diseases with maruellous effect. After that Noah had obtained his deliuerance, and was now gone out of the Arke; his first care was Religion: and therefore he Genes. 8. 0. built an Altar to the Lord, and tooke of euery cleane beast, and of euery cleane fowle, and offered burnt offerings vpon the Altar. And the Lord smelled a fauour of rest, and renued the ancient blessings and promises to Noah and his Posterity. The liuing creatures were also permitted to their food, and submitted to their rule, by whom they had in the Arke escaped drowning. Only the bloud was prohibited to them, as a ceremonial obseruation to instruct them
in lenity and hatred of cruelty: the politicall ordinance being annexed touching the bloud of man, against man or beast that should shed the same. This difference being Gibbins in Gènes. 9. Cic. dc inilib. 2. alledged of the life of man and beast, that the life of the beast is his bloud, the life of man is in his bloud. Not that the bloud which we see shed is the life of the beast; for that is properly, Cruor, not Sanguis, that is, the matter, whose forme was the life or vitall spirit, which being separated from the bodie, is seuered also from the forme of life. And the life of beasts hath no other forme but that which is vnited with the bloud, as the life of trees is the sappe of trees; their bloud being (as it were) their soule. But Vt sit pecn∣dum anim a qua∣litativa, hominum vero substantiua. Aquin. Sanguis vchicu∣culum animae Aristot. de Gen. animal. lib. 3. the life of man is in his bloud, hauing his seate therein, liuing when it is by death separated from the bloud; meane while the Spirites beeing the purest part of the bloud, as conduites conueying life to the bodily members, and as firme bands of a middle nature, betweene the body & soule, vniting them together; which bands and carriages being broken by effusion of bloud, the soule subsisteth a spiri∣tuall substance without the bodie, not subiect to substantiall corruption or morta∣litie. God did also make a couenant for man with the beasts of the field, infusing into the nature of all things, a dread and feare of man, whereby they feare the power, the snares, and sleights of man, and therefore flee or else submit themselues, not by that willing instinct, as to Adam in innocencie, but rather with a seruile feare. And al∣though by hunger or prouocation, or feare of their owne danger, they sometimes rebell, yet otherwise there remaines some impression of this naturall decree in them, as experience in all places hath shewed. Euen the Lion, king of forrests & sauage cre∣atures, doth not easily giue onset, but on such occasions: yea the Moores meeting with this beast, do rate and braule at him; this magnanimous beast passing by with a leering countenance, expressing a mixt passion of dread and disdaine, fearing the voyce of one, that feareth not the weapons of many, which himselfe, by the terrour of his voice, maketh the beasts to tremble. Hereunto the Lord addeth the Rainbow, a new sacrament, to seale his mercifull Couenant with the earth, not to drowne the same any more; which yet at last shall be burnt with fire, so to purge the heauens and earth of that vanity, whereto mans sin hath subiected them. And thus much do Gregor. Maz∣nios homil. 8. in Ezech. Melanc. Comest. some reade in the colours of Rabbini tres Iridis colores referunt ad tres Patriarchas: si∣cut & Christia∣in quatuor colores, ad 4.ele∣menta. Gib. the Rainbow, of a waterish and fiery mixture, as a continued signe of the double destruction of the world, the first outward as already past, the o∣ther inward as yet to come. Wel indeed may this Bowe be called the Iris Thau∣mant. filia. Child of Won∣der, both for the naturall constitution and diuine ordinance: not that there was be∣fore Alcuinum et Chrysoft. accusat Percrius huius opin. l. 14. in Gt. no such creature, but that then this vse of the creature was ordained. The refle∣ction or refraction of the Sunne-beames in a waterie cloude, the brightnes from the Sunne and from the cloud meeting together, the variety of colours proceeding from the varietie of matter; the furnish and drier part of the cloude yeelding a purplish, the watery a greenish sea-colour &c. borrowing the roundnes from the Sunne halfe eclipsed by the shadow of the Earth, are accounted the natural causes of this wonder of Nature; sometime also by reason of aboundance of matter, the same beeing doubled, one Bowe within the other, their colours placed contrarie, for that the one is the image (by reflection) of the other. Neither is it to be thought, that there was no Rainebowe before the Floud, anie more than that there was no water, bread or wine before the institution of our Christian Sacraments, which name and dignitie, not Nature, but Vse, by the appoyntment of the GOD of Nature and Grace doth giue vnto them. For not in the cloudes alone is this Bows to be seene, but as further witnesse of the maturall causes and constitution thereof, the same, effect may be shewed by concurrence of like causes in the waters and rockes where Riuers haue their falles; yea on the buildings of men: as I my selfe haue seene a perfect Rainebowe by the reflection of the Sunne-beames on a boarded wall of a Wa∣ter-mill, the boardes thereof being very wet with the fall of the water, and opposite to the Sunne. The sonnes of Noah were Sem (which because of Diuine priuiledge, from whose
loynes Christ was to come according to the flesh) is first named Ham or Cham, and Iapheth, who seemeth (as lunius & alij. Pererius contra lib. 15. in Gen. learned men gather by the Gen. 10.21. text) to be the eldest. Fa∣bulous Methodius, contrary to Moses, speaketh of an other sonne Ionithus after the Floud, whereas the Genes. 9.19. Scripture saith, That of those three all the Earth was repleni∣shed. To shew directly which Nations descended of each of these three, were a hard taske: and now after this confusion of Nations by wars, leagues, and otherwise, im∣possible. But for the first beginnings of Nations, before that Colonies were by vio∣lence of Conquerours, or by themselues, in their exceeding multiplying, voluntarily translated from one place to another, they are by Moses faithfully related, although the confusion of Languages and of peoples do make the matter hard and harsh to vs. Yet the names of Nations in the Greeke Stories doe in great part agree with the names of these first Patriarkes, as maister Broughtons Concent. Broughton hath shewed, by laying downe the names of Noahs house, which, vnvowelled, may admit sundry pronouncings, set∣ting against them such names as heathen Authors haue mentioned. Out of him, and Arias Montanus his Phaleg, and others, what I thought likeliest, I haue heere inser∣ted. Iapheth, Iapetus: Gomer, or after the Septuagint Gamer: Camaritae Cimmerij, and Cimbri. Ioseph. Ant. l. 1. Trem. & Iun. An. Iosephus saith, That the inhabitants of Galatia were of Gomer some∣time called Gomarae. Camd.Brit. Maister Camden deriueth the ancient Galls and Britans from this Gomer: the name which they giue to themselues to this day implying the same, which is Kumero, Cymro, and Kumeri, a Brittish or Welsh woman Kumeraes, and their language Kumeraeg. Magog Mas∣sagetae & Getae. Magog is supposed the father of the Scythians, before (saith Iosephus) called Ma∣goges, Ezek. 38.2. and 39.6. who after inuading those parts, left the name Magog to Hierapolis in Syria: Plin lib. 5. c. 23. Of Madai came the Medes, of Iauan the Iones or Grecians. Of Thubal the Iberians, called sometime (saith Iosephus) Thobeli. The Iberians, saith Montanus, dwelt neere to Meotis: certaine colonies of them inha∣bited Spaine, and called it Hiberia, and themselues Hiberians: whence the Spaniards haue a report, that Thubal was the first peopler of their countrey. The Cappadoci∣ans were called Meschini of Meshech, whose citie Mazaca was named of Meshech, since by Tiberius named Caesarea, where Basil was Bishop. Hence was named Mos∣chicus mons, and Moschos, and the Moscouites. From Thiras came the Thracians. The name Tros may cause men to ascribe the Troians to this beginning. Of the sonnes of Gomer, Aschenaz was Author of the nations in Asia, Pontus, and Bithynia, where was the lake and riuer Ascanius, a pro∣per name also of men in those parts: the Axine or Euxine Sea: the Ascanian Iland, and Ascania in Phrygia. Of Riphath came the Paphlagonians, sometimes called the Riphathaei, saith Iosephus: and the Riphaean hills in the North: the Amazonians were also called Aeorpatae in Herod. Melpom. The Arimphei neere to the Riphean hilles. Thogarma gaue name to the inhabitants of Armenia Minor, whose Kings, called Tygranes, and Townes Tygranokartae, witnesse it: some also attribute the Turkes or Turkeman Nation to this name and author. These peopled Asia first, and from thence by degrees these parts of Europe: Of Togarma, Africanus deriueth the Ar∣menians. Of Iauans children, Elisha founded the Aeoles, called also Aelisei of Tarshish came the Cilicians, whose mother-citie was Tarsus, Paules birth-place. Montanus thin∣keth that Tharsis was Carthage in Africa, which the Poeni after possessed: some re∣ferre the Venetians to Tharsis also. Cittim was an other part of Cilicia. The Cre∣tans (after Montanus) were called Chetim, and of others Cortini, of whom the Ita∣lian coast called Magna Graecia was inhabited, and the city Caieta, builded. Of Do∣danim came the Dorians and Rhodians. These peopled the North and West parts of the World in Asia and Europe. Chams posteritie was Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan: These possessed the South of Asia, and Africa. Of Cham is the name Chemmis in Aegipt; and Ammon
the Idol and Oracle so notorious. Cush gaue name to the Aethiopians and Arabians knowne in Scripture by that name. Mizraim, to the Aegyptians, euen at this day so called in their owne and the Arabian tongues. Put, to the Libyans, sometime cal∣led Phuthaei: the riuer Fut is mentioned by lib. 5. ca 1. Pliny not far from Atlas. The Canaa∣nites I need not mention: Moses plainely describeth them. Of the sons of Cush, Seba Author of the inhabitants of Arabia deserta, Ps. 72.10. or after Montanus Sabaea regio thurifera. Chauila is a name more forgotten, supposed to be Author of a people neere the Persian Gulfe. Sabtha Sta∣beisuper sinum Persie. & Mes∣sabathae ex ijs oriundi. Arias Montanus. Sabbesta left the name to the inha∣bitants of Arabia Faelix, where was the city Sabbatha with threescore temples there∣in. Other people of Arabia Faelix came of Raeamah, where Ptolomaeus placeth Rega∣ma: the Garamantes also in Libya. Sabitheca was Author of the Sachalitae in Arabia Faelix. Nimrod—the sonne of Cush, some thinke to be Zoroastres some Belus. Misraim begate Ludim, the inhabitants of Maraeotica praefectura in Egypt: Ana∣mim, the Cyreneans: & Lehabim, the Libyans: & Naphtuhim the Aethiopians neare to Egypt, whose towne Napata is mentioned in Ptolomey: Pathrusim the Pharusians, Casluhim, at the entrance of Egypt, Cassiotis. Montanus interpreteth Ludim the Libyans; Ghananim, the Troglodytes; Lehabim, the Cyrenaikes; Naphthuhim, Africa the lesse; Chasluhim the Saracens; Caphthorins, the Cappadocians. To Shems posterity befell the parts of Asia from Iudaea eastward. Shems sonnes were Elam, the father of the Elamites, in the higher part of Persia: Ashur, of whom came the Assyrians: Arphaxad: the Cadusians or the Chaldeans are (with little likenesse of sound) ascribed to him. Lud is holden father of the Lydians: and Aram of the Syrians, called also Aramaei; others of Aarm deriue Armenia. Arams sonnes were Vz, of whom the region Ausanitis was named Chul, of whom Cholle seemeth to haue his appellation in the Palmyrene desarts neare to Euphrates. Gether; Iosephus ascribeth to him Bactria; others that part of Syria where Gnidar stood. Atergate and Derceto that notorious Syrian goddesse; happily borrowed the name hence: Of Mash is the name Masius, part of the hill Amanus: Montanus saith, of Mes Mis', and Misia, whom Invenal calles Mesos—de grege Mesorum. Ioktan begat Elmodad, of whom the hill Emodus may seeme named: of Shalah the Sclebij and Sariphi: of Hatzarmaveth, the Sarmatians: of Iarach, the Arachosi∣ans: of Hadoram, the Orites, people of India: of Vzal or Auxal, Auzakea a citie in Scythia, and the riuer Oxus: of Diklah (after Arias Montanus) Scythia intra Ima∣um, the reason I see not in the name: of Obal or Ghobal, the Cabolites, people of Pa∣ropanisus: of Abimael, Imaus: of Sheba, the Sabae which Eustathius placeth in In∣dia, or according to Montanus, the Sacae: of Ophir, some thinke called Aurea Cher∣sonesus, where Pegu and Malacca now are: Montanus thinketh it to be Peru: Chani∣lah hath not left so plaine impression behinde. Montanus ascribeth to him India. Of Iobab, Arias Montanus coniectureth Parias in the West Indies to haue come, but with little probabilitie which I can see. And of the most before named wee haue probable coniectures, not certaine proofes, as appeareth by the difference of opi∣nions of Authors concerning them. Neither may we thinke that Moses intended so much a Geographicall Historie of all the Nations of the World, many of which were not, long after his time, planted or peopled; but of the first Fathers, who peopled the places by degrees, as they increased in multitude which were neerest that Armenian centre: and especially he relateth & dilateth of them, whom it most concerned the Israelites to know, as the Canaanites, whose bounds and nations are exactly descri∣bed. I could adde much touching the seuerall Nations descending of these three brethren, and the bounds of their habitations, in which Africanus sometime took profitable paines; and Eusebius out of him, although both be in this part lost: some∣what hath beene barbarously translated into Latine by an vnknowne Author, for the foloecismes, tedious; for the substance of history profitable to the Reader: and there∣fore by Scaliger in his edition of Eusebius communicated to the world. But the vn∣certainety Pererius, Op∣merus, and o∣ther Commē∣ters on Genes. and Chrono∣logians, haue done somwhat in this argu∣ment, which yet as in many we see much probabilitie, so very much is exceeding doubtfull of that they say. maketh me vnwilling to proceed in this argument further.
Of this vncertaintie no greater cause can be alleadged, then the diuision and con∣fusion of Tongues, the historie whereof Moses declareth. For whereas God had gi∣uen to man two Priuiledges and principall prerogatiues, whereof other creatures are no way capable, his inward Retione & oratione diffe∣runt bomines à bestijs. Reason, and abilitie to vtter the same by Speach: this be∣nefite of God in Nature was turned into a conspiracie against God and Nature. They said one to another, Genes. 1. 2, 3 Come, let vs make bricke for stone, and slime had they instead of mor∣ter. Also they said, let vs build vs a City and Tower, whose toppe may reach vnto the hea∣uen, that we may get vs a name, lest we be scattered vpon the whole earth. This was their vaine arrogance and presumption, that when their guilty consciences threatened a dissipation and scattering by diuine Iustice: they would thus harten & harden them∣selues against God and Man: in stead of thankefulnesse to God, and honouring his name, they would winne themselues a name and honour: in stead of preuenting pu∣nishment by repentance, they would in this Giant-like fighting against God pre∣uent future iudgements. But euen that, by which they intended to keepe them from scattering, was the true and first cause of their scattering. So doth God scatter the counsells of his enemies, and taketh the wise in their craftinesse. Babel or confusion is alway the attendant of Pride. Sibylla, alleaged by Ant.li. 1. ca. 4. Iosephus, testifieth of this con∣fusion of Tongues in these words. When all men before vsed one speech, they ere∣cted a high Tower, as if they would ascend to Heauen, but the Gods by tempests o∣uerthrew their Tower, and gaue to ech of them seuerall Languages, whereof the ci∣tie was named Babylon. According to that of Moses, Genes. 11. 9. Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth. From thence then did the Lord scatter them vpon all the Earth. The Atheists and Natura∣lists dreame the world to be eternall, and conceiue that all men could not be of one; because of this diuersitie of languages. If such had beene at Hierusalem, and heard the Apostles (not the expertest men in their owne vulgar) speake all Languages: they might then haue seene the like powerin a contrary effect to this of Babylon. Mans sinne caused this, Gods mercie that the one came from Babylon, the other from Ie∣rusalem, that old Ierusalem giuing a taste and earnest of that, which the new Ierusa∣lem shal once fully accomplish, when all shalbe made new, all shall become one, and God shalbe all in all. It appeereth that these Builders lost the vnderstanding of their owne speach, and were indued with other language, whereto their Vnderstandings and Tongues were framed, in stead of that former. What this former Language was, hath bin doubted, either of ignorance or of cu∣riositie and self-loue. Theodor. q. 59. in Gen. esteemeth Syrian the first language and that Hebrew began with Moses, taught him by God as a sacred language. Herodot. li. 2. Psam∣metichus K. of Egypt caused two children to be closely brought vp by a shepheard, who should at times put Goats to them to giue them suck, without euer hearing hu∣mane voice. After two yeeres they vttered the word Bec Bec, which was the voyce that they had heard of their nurses the Goates, but not so interpreted by Psammeti∣chus; for he enquiring in what language Bec was significant, and hearing that the Phrygians so called Bread, ascribed to them the prioritie of all nations and langua∣ges. Melabdim Echebar the great Relat. Regn. Mogor. loan. Orani. Mogor (as the Iesuites Epistles declare) made the like triall of thirty children, whom he caused, without hearing of man, to be brought vp, setting Guards to obserue the Nurses that they should not speake to them: pur∣posing to be of that Religion whereto they should addict themselues. But neither could they euer speake, or would he euer addict himselfe to one certaine Religion. Indoscyth. Goropini by a few Dutch Etymologies grew into conceit, & would haue the world beleeue him, that Dutch was the first language; which if it were, we English should reigne with them, as a Colony of that Dutch Citie, a streame from that fountaine, by commerce and conquests since manifoldly mixed. But his euidence is too weake, his authority too new. The Orig. in Num. 11. Hier in So∣phon.ca. 3. Chrys. in Gen, 30. Aug de Ciuit. Dei li. 16. ca. 11 &c. common and more receiued opinion, is, that the Hebrew was the first, confirmed also by vniuersalitie, antiquitie, and consent of the Christian Fathers and
learned men, grounding themselues vpon this reason, That all the names, mentioned in Scripture before the Diuision, are in that Language only significant: besides, it is not like, that Shem conspired with these Babylonians, & therfore not partaker of their pu∣nishmēt. Now it is very probable, & almost manifest, that he was See Broughton on that argu∣ment. Genebrard. Chron. Gen. 10. 21. the same which after is called Melchisedesh, King of Salem; betwixt whom & Abraham, in that familiaritie, it is not likely, that there was much dissonance in Language. He is also called the fa∣ther of all the sonnes of Heber, by a peculiar proprietie, although he had other sonnes, because the puritie of Religion & Language remained in Hebers posteritie. And why should Heber call his sonne Peleg (Diuision) but of this diuision which then happened? The Nation and Language of Israel borrow their name (Hebrew) of him. And if it had happened to himselfe, why should he, more then other, haue so named his sonne? CHAP. IX. A Geographicall Narration of the whole Earth in generall, and more particularly of ASIA. WE haue all this time beene viewing one Nation, which alone was knowne in the Earth, vntill confusion of Language caused diuision of Lands; and haue taken notice of the Heads and Authors of those Peoples and Nations, that from that time were scattered ouer the World, and after setled in their proper Habitations. Wee haue not followed the opinion of some, both of the Augustin. Hierom. Arrzobius. Epiphan. Broughton &c. Antients, and later Writers, in defining the number of Nations and Languages through the World, reckoned by them 72. For who seeth not, that Moses in that tenth of Genesis is most carefull to describe the posteritie and bounds of Canaan, which GOD had giuen to Israel, which it were ab∣surd to thinke in so small a territorie to be of so many (that is, eleuen) seuerall Langua∣ges? And how many Nations were founded after that by Abrahams posteritie (not to mention so many other Fountaines of Peoples) by the sonnes of Hagar, and Ketura, and Esau the sonne of Isaac? Neither could the World so suddenly be peopled: and of that, which then was peopled, Moses writing a Historie of and for the Church, so farre mentioneth the Affaires and Nations of the world, as it was meet for the Church (and specially that Church of the Israelites) to know, according as it was likely they should haue then, or after, more or lesse to doe with them. Excerpta bar∣baro-Latina a∣pud los. Scalig. Eusebium Africanus hath reckoned the 72 by name. But how easie were it in these dayes to set downe 72 more, of diffe∣ring Nations, both in Region and Language; and how little of the World was then knowne, shall presently be shewed. Besides, it may be a question, whether diuers of those, there mentioned, did not speake the same Language (as in Chaldaea, Syria, and Canaan) Gibbins in Gen. 11. with some diuersitie of a Dialect, a little more then in our Northerne, We∣sterne, and Southerne English: Which may appeare, both by the pilgrimages of the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, in those parts (which had needed new inter∣preters, by that rule, in euery two or three daies trauell, except themselues had beene almost miraculoussy skilful in Languages) and by the Chaldaean & Syrian Monuments & Books, which some obserue to come nigh to the Hebrew. 'D.Willet in Dan.c. 1. q. 25. reproueth Philo's opinion, That the Chalde and Hebrew was all one, because Dantel. an Hebrew, was set to learne the Chalde: or that the Syrian & Chalde, according to Mer∣cerus opinion, was the same: yet grants, that in the first times the Syrian & Chalde litle differed. Perhaps it was with these three Languages, as with the Frankes See Wolfgang. Laz. de mg∣gentium, lib. 3. Beat. Rhenanus, R. Verstegans Ant.q. Language, when they first seated thēselues in Gallia, & that which is now called The olde French and our old Eng∣lish are very like; both (in their original) Dutch. French; or the Saxon & the present English: for there were no lesse mutations and transmutations, by times & warres, in those parts thē in these. It seemeth therefore probable, that at the first diuision of Languages, they that most disagreed, did furthest separate thēselues, & they that spake either the same, or neere in likenesse to the same speech, obserued the same neighborhood of Nation, as of speech; which, the names and words of the Phenician, Syrian, Persian, Arabian, and Aegyptian Languages, testifie. The diuision of Tongues
was about a hundred yeares after the Floud, An. Mundi 1757. as Caluisius and Bun∣tingus accompt. Now that wee haue spoken of the first Authors of the principall and first Nations, let vs suruey their Lands and Inheritance, which GOD gaue vnto them, which was the habitable Earth. This Earth, together with the Waters, make one-Globe and huge Ball, resting on it selfe, supported by the Almightie hand of GOD, to the round∣nesse whereof, the high Mountaines, in comparison of the whole, can be small im∣pediments, and are but as a few motes or dust sticking to a ball. Possidonius, Erato∣sthenes, Hipparchus, Plinie, Ptolomey, and others, skilfull in Geographie, haue ende∣uoured by Art to finde out the true quantitie hereof: and although there appeare dif∣ference in their summes, yet that is imputed rather to the diuersitie of their furlongs, which some reckoned longer then others, then to their differing opinions. But ne∣uer had they so certaine intelligence of the quantitie of the Earth, as in our times, by the Nauigations of F. Magellanes Spaniards, F. Drake. T. Cauend sh. English, and Oliuer Noort. Dutch, round about the same, is giuen vs; Art and Experience consulting, and conspiring together, to perfect the Sci∣ence of Geographie. For whereas the Ancients diuided the World into three parts, Asia, Africa, and Europe, and yet neither knew the East and North parts of Asia, nor the South of Africa, nor the most Northerly parts of Europe: not onely these three are by Land and Sea farre more fully discouered, but also A. Maginus Geog. three other parts, no lesse (if not much greater) then the former, are added to them; namely, America Mexicana, and America Peruviana, and Terra Australis, or the Land lying to∣ward the South pole. As for the seuenth part, which some reckon vnder the North Pole, because we haue no relation but Mercat. Tab. Vniuersal. from a Magician, a Frier of Oxford, cal∣led Nicholas de Linna, which might with as good conscience lye to vs, as by Art∣Magicke take view of those Parts (otherwise it is not certainely knowne, whether it be ioyning to Asia, or whether it be Land or Sea) I therefore leaue it out in this diuision. Europe is diuided from Africke by the Mediterranean Sea; from Asia by the Aegean and Euxine, Maeotis, Tanais, and a line from the fountaines thereof North∣wards: on the North and West parts washed with the Ocean; which running by the straits of Gibraltar, floweth along the Coasts of Africke to the Cape of Good Hope, and thence passeth all alongst on the East side thereof into the Arabian Gulfe, where, by a Necke of Land, it is encountred: This Necke, the Mediterranean, and Ocean, doe limit the bounds of Africa: The rest of the old World is Asia. America Mexicana, or North, and the South called Peruviana, are seuered by the narrow Straits of Dariene, in other places compassed by the Sea: The South Continent is verie little knowne, and containeth the rest of the World, not bounded in the former limits. But in their particular places wee shall heare of each of them more fully. It cannot be without some great worke of God, thus in the old and decrepit Age of the World, to let it haue more perfect knowledge of it selfe; which wee hope, and pray, may be for the further enlargement of the Kingdome of CHRIST IESVS, and propagation of his Gospell. And, as in former times, in those then∣discouered Parts, the Iewes were scattered, some violently, some willingly, through Asia, Africa, and Europe, to vsher the Gospell into those Parts, and make way for that which the most of themselues reiected: who knoweth, whe∣ther in the secret dispensation of Diuine Prouidence, which is a co-worker in eue∣rie worke, able euen out of euill to bring good, the Donations of Popes, the Na∣uigations of Papists, the preaching of Friers and Iesuites may be fore-runners of a further and truer manifestation of the Gospell, to the new-found Nations? For euen alreadie it is one good steppe of an Atheist and Infidell to become a Proselyte, al∣though with some soyle: and againe, the Iesuites there cannot play the States-men, as in these parts, yea Iesuitarum Epistole. Thus did Fr. Kuier, and the rest of them. (themselues in their relations being witnesses) they rather take the Euangelicall courses of those, which here they count heretikes, & by laying open mens
sinne through the fall, and diuine iustice, onely by Christ satisfied, doe beat downe infidelitie with diligent Catechisings: although vpon that golden foundation they build afterward their owne Hay and Stubble, with their racke of Confession, and rab∣ble of Ceremonies, and (the most dangerous to new Conuerts) an exchanged Poly∣theisme in worshipping of Saints, Images, and the Host. But if God shall once shew mercie to Spaine, to make them truly Catholike, and, as a diuine Inquisitor, condemne that deuillish Inquisition to perpetuall exile, how great a window may be that means be opened vnto this new World for their conuersion and reformation? And why may not the English Expedition and Plantation in Virginia, and the Nauigations of other Protestants, helpe this way, if men respected not their owne Pride, Ambition and Couetousnesse, more then the truth and glorie of God? But he that by Fishers con∣uerted the old World, and turned the wisdome of the World into foolishnesse, sub∣dued Scepters by preaching the Crosse, yea, by suffering it in himselfe and in his members: is able of those stones to raise vp children to Abraham, and that by the mouth of Babes and Snoklings, by weakest meanes, when it pleaseth him. Let vs therefore pray the Lord of the Haruest to send forth Labourers into these wide and spa∣cious fields ripe thereunto. But to returne to our parts of the World, whence this meditation hath withdrawne me. The ancient Lege Ortelii Aevi teris descrip. & Ma∣ris pacifici. Geographers were ignorant of a great part of that threefold di∣uision: as appeareth by their owne Writings. The vse of the Loadstone, found out by Iohn Goa of Melsi, an Italian (or, as P. Bellonii obseru. l. 2. c. 16. Bellonius obserueth, by one Flanius, but Albertus Magnus was the first that writ of the nature of it) was a great and neces∣sarie helpe to further Discoueries, especially after that Henry, sonne of Iohn the first, King of Portugall, Barr. dec. 1. l. 1. Asia Osorius de Reb. Ema. l. 1. Maffus, l. I. Hist. Ind. Dam. Goes de mor. Aethiopum. Got. Arthus Hist. India. began to make voyages of discouerie vpon the Coast of Afri∣ca, and Iohn the second seconded that Enterprise, and vsed the helpe of Mathemati∣cians, Roderigo and Ioseph his Physicians, and Martin Bohemus, by whome the Astro∣labe was applyed to the Art of Nauigation, and benefit of the Mariner, before vsed onely in Astronomie. This Iohn also sent men of purpose into Arabia and Aethiopia, and other Countries of the East, to learne further knowledge thereof. From these be∣ginnings, daily encreasing, hath Nauigation (first in Portugall, and by degrees in o∣ther Europaean Nations) by the helpe of Astronomicall rules growne to her present perfection, and by it, Geographie. And if the longitude of places might as easily be found out as the latitude, which our countreyman Master Linton made Comple∣ment of the Art of Nau. promise of, wee should yet grow to better knowledge in those Sciences, and of the World by them. Moreouer, as the Expedition of Alexander, and those flourishing, Monarchies in Asia, brought some knowledge thereof to the Auncients: So the Histories of la∣ter times, but specially the great Trauels by Land of Marcus Panlus, Odoricus, Will. de Rubruquis, Ioannes de Plano Carpini, our Countreyman Mandeuile, and others, be∣fore this skill of Nauigation, haue giuen much light to the knowledge of the in-land Countries of Asia, which we are first to speake of. As for the Circles, the Aequinoctiall, which parteth the Globe in the middest, the Tropickes of Cancer and Capricorne 23. degrees and a halfe from either side of the Aequinoctiall, the Arctike and Antarctike Circles 23. degrees and a halfe from the North and South Poles, or not much differing (which are vsually set in Mappes with red or double lines, for distinction:) The Meridians, which are Circles passing ouer our heads, in what part of the World soeuer we be, and also through both the Poles: the Horizon, which diuideth the vpper halfe of the World which wee see, from the nether halfe which wee see not: the Paralels of Latitude, which the old Cosmo∣graphers make (sayth Blundeuile) but 21, from the Aequinoctiall to the North, and as many on the other side toward the South, but now the P. Merula. Moderne make them vp 39: The Climes or Climates, which are the spaces betwixt two Para∣lels: Also the tearmes of Poles, which are two, the Arctike, and the Antarctike; and the Axletree of the World (a right line imagined to passe from the one to the other, through the Centre of the Earth:) the Degrees, containing 60. myles (or
after Cornelius de Iuddis, 68095 ¼ paces, which is a greater summe then the former) into 90 of which degrees euery fourth part of the world is diuided, and amount in the whole to 360. Also the Geographicall tearmes of Littus, Fretum, Insula, Sinus, Con∣tinens, Promontorium, Isthmus, that is, Shores, Straites, Islands, Bayes, Continent, Capes, or Head-lands, Neckes of Land, and such like: All these (I say) and other things of like nature, needfull to this kinde of knowledge, the studious shall finde in those Authors which teach the Principles of Astronomie and Geographie, as Master Blundeuile, and others. My intent is not to teach Geographie, but to bestow on the studious of Geogra∣phie, a Historie of the World, so to giue him meat vnto his bones, and vse vnto his Theorie or Speculation, whereby both that skill may be confirmed, and a further and more excellent obtained. Geographie without Historie seemeth a carkasse without life and motion: Historie without Geographie moueth, but in mouing wandreth as a vagrant, without certaine habitation. And whereas Time and Place are twinnes and vnseparable companions, in the chiefe Histories to set downe the true time of chiefe Accidents, will adde much light to both; a great taske in one Countrey: but to take vp the whole World on my shoulder, which haue not the strength either of Atlas or Hercules to beare it; and in the whole to obserue the description of Places, order of Times, and the Historie of Actions and Accidents, especially Religions (olli robur & aes triplex, thrice happie hee that could happily atchieue it) I confesse beyond my abi∣litie exactly to performe; but with the wisest, I hope that the haughtinesse of the At∣tempt, in a thing so full of varietie and hardnesse, shall rather purchase pardon to my slippes, then blame for my rashnesse. And how can I but often slip, that make a per∣ambulation ouer the World, that see with others eyes, that tell of matters past so ma∣ny Ages before I had a being? Yet such is the necessity of such a Historie, either thus, or not at all. But as neere as I can, I purpose to follow the best euidence, and to pro∣pound the Truth: my fault (where it is worst) shall be rather mendacia dicere, then mentiri, and yet the Tales-man shall be set by the Tale, the Authors name annexed to his Historie, to shield me from that imputation. And first we must begin with ASIA, to which the first place is due, as being the place of the first Men, first Religion, first Cities, Empires, Arts: where the most things mentioned in Scripture, were done; the place where Paradise was seated; the Arke rested; the Law was giuen; and whence the Gospell proceeded: the Place which did beare Him in his flesh, that by his Word beareth vp all things. Asia (after A Maginus,  At∣r. Iud.  Abr. Ortel. & alij. some) is so called of Asia, the daughter of Oceanus and Thetis; which was wife to Iapetus mother of Prometheus: Others fetch this name from Asius the sonne of Manaeus; both with like certaintie and credit. It is greater then Europe and Africa: yea, the Islands thereof are larger, if they were put together, then all Europe. It is compassed with the Easterne, Indian, and Scythian, Oceans, on three parts: on the West it hath the Arabian Gulfe, that necke of Land which diuideth it from Africa, the Mediterranean, Aegean, Pontike Seas, the Lake Maeotis, Tanais, with an imagined line from thence to the Bay of S. Nicholas. Some make it yet lar∣ger, and make Nilus to diuide it from Africa, but with lesse reason. Taurus diuideth it in the middest: On the North side is that which is called Asia interior: on the South is Asia exterior. More vnequall is that diuision into Asia the greater and the lesse, this being lesse indeed, then that it should sustaine a member in that diuision. Io. Bar∣rius diuideth it into nine parts, Ortelius into fiue, Maginus into seuen, which are these: First, That part of Tartaria betwixt Muscouia, the Northerne Ocean, the Ri∣uer Ob, and the Lake Kytai, and a line thence drawne to the Caspian Sea, and that Isthmus which is betwixt that and the Pontike Sea: secondly, the great Chams Coun∣trey, from thence to the Easterne Sea, betweene the frozen Sea and the Caspian: thirdly, That which is subiect to the Turke, all from Sarmatia & Tartaria Southwards, betweene Tigris and the Mediterrannean Sea: fourthly, The Persian Kingdome, be∣tweene the Turke, Tartar, India, and the Red Sea: fifthly, India, within and beyond
Ganges, from Indus to Cantan: sixtly, The Kingdome of China: seuenthly, The Islands. These diuisions are not so exact as may be wished, because of that varietie and vncertaintie in those Kingdomes. Many things doth Asia yeeld, not elsewhere to be had; Myrrhe, Frankincense, Cinnamon, Cloues, Nutmegs, Mace, Pepper, Muske, and other like, besides the chiefest Iewels. It hath also minerals of all sorts: It nouri∣sheth Elephants, Camels, and many other Beasts, Serpents, Fowles, wild and tame, as in the ensuing discourse, in their due places, shall appeare; yet doth it not nourish such monstrous shapes of men as fabulous Antiquitie fained. It brought forth that Monster of irreligion, Mahomet; whose Sect, in diuers Sects, it fostereth with long continuance of manifold Superstitions. It hath now those great Empires of the Turk, Persian, Mogore, Cathayan, Chinois: it had sometimes the Parthian, and before that, the Persian, Median, Assyrian, Scythian: and first (as it seemeth) before them all, the Babylonian Empire vnder Nimrod, which is therefore in the next place to be spoken of. CHAP. X. Of Babylonia, the originall of Idolatrie: and the Chaldaeans Antiquities before the Floud, as BEROSVS hath reported them. COnfusion caused diuision of Nations, Regions, and Religions. Of this confusion (whereof is alreadie spoken) the Citie, and thereof this Countrey, tooke the name. Plin. l. 5. c.12. Plinie maketh it a part of Syria, which he extendeth from hence to Cilicia. Strab. l.16. Strabo addeth, as farre as the Pontike Sea. But it is vsually reckoned an entire countrey of it selfe, which Ptol. Geograe. l.5.c.20. Ptolomey doth thus bound. On the North it hath Mesopota∣mia, on the West Arabia Deserta; Susiana on the East; on the South, part of Arabia, and the Persian Gulfe. Luke (Act.7.21) maketh Babylonia a part of Mesopotamia: Pto∣lomey more strictly diuideth them: whereunto also agreeth the interpretation of the Land of Shinar, that it was the lower part of Mesopotamia, containing Chaldaea and Babylon, lying vnder the Mount Sangara. D Willet in Dan. cap.1.9.15. In this Coun∣trey was built the first Citie which wee reade of after the Floud, by the vngratefull world, moued thereunto (as some thinke) by Nimrod, the sonne of Cush, nephew of Cham. For as Cains posteritie, before the Floud, were called the Sonnes of Men, as more sauouring the things of men then of God; more industrious in humane inuenti∣ons, then religious deuotions: so by Noahs Curse it may appeare, and by the Nations that descended of him, that Cham was the first Author, after the Floud, of irreligion. Neither is it likely, that he which derided his old father, whome Age, Hobnesse, Fa∣therhood. Benefits, and thrice greatest Function of Monarchie, Priesthood, and Prophecie, should haue taught him to reuerence: That he (I say) which at once could breake all these bonds and chaynes of Nature and Humanitie, would be held with any bonds of Religion; or could haue an eye of Faith to see him which is inuisible, hauing put out his eyes of Reason and Cimlitie. Had he feared God, had he reuerenced man, had hee made but profession of these things in some hypocriticall shew, he could not so easily haue sitten downe at ease in that Chaire of Scorning, whence we reade not that euer he arose by repentance. From this Cham came Nimrod, Gen.10.9. the mightie hunter before the Lord; not of innocent beasts, but of men, compelling them to his subiection, although Noah and Sim were yet aliue, with many other Patriarchs. As for Noah, the fabling Heathen, it is like, deified him. The Berosus of fabling An∣nius, calleth him Father of the Gods, Heauen, Chaos, the Soule of the World. Ianus his double face might seeme to haue arisen hence, of Noahs experience of both Ages, before & after the Floud. The fable of Saturnes filius Coeli, cui sub∣ict virilia. Saturnes cutting off his fathers priulties might take beginning of that act, for which Cham was cursed. Sem is supposed to be that
Melchisedech King of Salem, the figure of our Lord, and the propagator of true Re∣ligion; although euen in his posteritie it failed, in which, Abrahams father, as witnes∣seth Iosh.24.2. Ioshua serued other Gods. Iaphets pietie causeth vs to persuade our selues good things of him; Cham and his posteritie we see the authors of ruine. Philo de Antiq. Method. Reuel. Philo and Me∣thodius (so are the two bookes called, but falsely) tell, That in these dayes they began to diuine by Starres, and to sacrifice their children by Fire; which Element Nimrod compelled men to worship: and that to leaue a name to posteritie, they engraued their names in the brickes wherewith Babel was builded. Abram refusing to com∣municate with them (and good cause, for The buil∣ding of Babel was An. Mund. 1757. and A∣braham was born An. 1948. he was not yet borne) was cast into their Brick-kill, and came out (long after from his mothers wombe) without harme. Nahor, Lot, and other his fellowes, nine in number, saued themselues by flight. Chronic. be∣fore the Bible. Others adde, That Arane, Abrams brother, was done to death for refusing to worship the Fire. Qui Bauium non odit, amet tua carmina Maeni. To come to truer and more certaine reports, Moses sayth, That Gen.10.9. the beginning of Nimrods Kingdome was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calne which three some in∣terprete Edessa, Nisibis, Callinisum. And whereas commonly it is translated in the next words, Out of that land came Ashur, and built Niniue. Tremellius and Iunius reade it, Out of this land he (Nimrod) went into Ashur or Assyria, and built Niniue and Re∣hoboth, Calah, and Resen. But Ar. Montanus. Melanctbon Chron. Gramay. Asia. most vsually this is vnderstood of Ashur the sonne of Sem; who disclaiming Nimrods tyrannie, built Niniue, which after became the chiefe Citie of the Assyrian Empire, to which Babylon it selfe was subiected not long after. Xenophon de Aequivocis (if his authoritie be current) saith, That the eldest of the chiefe Families were called Saturni, their fathers had to name Coelum, their wiues Rhea: and out of a pillar, erected by Semiramis to Ninus, alledgeth this inscription; My father was Iupiter Belus, my grandfather Saturnus Babylonicus, my great grandfather Satur∣nus Aethiops, who was sonne of Saturnus Aegyptius; to whome Coelus Phoenix Ogyges was father. Ogyges is interpreted Noah, therefore called Phoenix, because of his ha∣bitation (as is thought) in Phoenicia, not farre from whence, in Ierusalem, Sem raig∣ned; Saturnus Aegyptius may be the name of Cham, of whose name Aegypt is in Scripture tearmed Ps.78.51. the land of Cham. Saturnus Aethiops is Chush; Nimrod Baby∣lonicus, the father of Belus, who begat Ninus. But this cannot be altogether true. For Niniue hath greater antiquitie then Nimrods nephew (howsoeuer the Greeke Histories ascribe this to Ninus, and Babylon to his wife Semiramis) except wee say, that by them these two Cities, formerly built, were enlarged and erected to that mag∣nificence, which with the growth of the Assyrian Empire they after obtained. Chron. Gr. Edit. Scal. pag. 9. & 13. Eusebius in the first booke of his Chronicle attributeth the originall of Idolatrie to Serug the father of Nahor. Bed. Chronic. Beda sayth, In the daies of Pbaleg Temples were built, and the Princes of Nations adored for Gods. The same hath Isidore. Epiphan. can. her. l.1. in initio. Epiphanius re∣ferreth it to Serug; and addeth, That they had not grauen Images of Wood or Met∣tall, but pictures of men; and Thara, the father of Abraham, was the first Author of Images. The like hath Suidas. These times, till Abram, they called Scythismus. The reason of their Idolatrie Eusebius alledgeth: That they thus kept remembrance of their Warriors, Rulers, and such as had atchieued noblest Enterprises & worthiest Exploits in their life time. Their posteritie, ignorant of that their scope (which was, to obserue their memorials which had been authors of good things, and because they were their fore-fathers) worshipped them as heauenly Deities, and sacrificed to them. Of their God-making or Canonization this was the manner: In their sacred Bookes or Kalen∣dars they ordained, That their names should be written after their death, and a Feast should be solemnized according to the same time, saying, That their soules were gone to the Isles of the blessed, and that they were no longer condemned or burned with fire. These things lasted to the dayes of Thara; who (sayth Suidas) was an Image∣maker, & propounded his Images (made of diuers matter) as Gods to be worshipped: but Abram broke his fathers Images. From Sarueh the Author, and this Practise, Ido∣latrie passed to other Nations: Suidas addeth, specially into Greece: for they worship∣ped
Hellen, a Gyant of the posteritie of Iapheth, a partner in the building of the Tower. Not vnlike to this, we read the causes of Idolatrie in the booke of Wisedome ca. 14.14. Wisdome (sup∣posed to be written by Philo, but, because the substance is Salomons, professing and bearing his name) which of all the Apocrypha-Scripture sustaineth least exception, attaineth highest commendation: When a father mourned grieuously for his sonne that was taken away suddenly, he made an Image for him that was once dead, whom now he wor∣shippeth as a God, and ordained to his seruants Ceremonies and Sacrifices. A second cause he alledgeth, viz. the tyrannie of men, whose Images they made and honoured, that they might by all meanes flatter him that was absent as though he had been present. A third rea∣son followeth: the ambitious skill of the workman, that through the beautie of the worke the multitude being allured, tooke him for a God, which a little before was honored but as a man. The like affirmeth Polid. lib. 1. dt inuentorio. Polydore de inuentoribus, alledging Cyprian de Idolis for his author. Lactant. li. 4. ca. 28. Lactantius (as before is shewed) maketh that the Etymologie of the word Superstitio, Quia superstitem memoriam defunctorum colebant, aut quia parentibus suis superstites cele∣brabant imagines corum doms, tanquam Deos penates: either because they honored with such worship the suruiuing memorie of their dead ancestors; or because suruiuing and out-liuing their ancestors, they celebrated their Images in their houses, as household∣Gods. Such authors of new rites, and deifiers of Omnia idola ex mortuorum errore creuerūt. Hier. in Hos. 2. dead men they called Superstitious: but those which followed the publikely-receiued and auncient Deities, were called Religious, according to that verse of Virgil. Vana superstitio veterum{que} ignara deorū. But by this rule (saith Lactant.) we shall find all superstitious which worship false Gods, and them only religious, which worship the one and true GOD. The same Lib. 2. c. 14. Lactant. saith, That Noah cast off his sonne Cham for his wickednes, & expelled him. He abode in that part of the earth which now is called Arabia, called (sayth he) of his name Ca∣naan, and his posteritie Canaanites. This was the first people which was ignorant of GOD, because their founder & Prince receiued not of his father the worship of GOD. But first of all other the Aegyptians began to behold & adore the heauenly bodies: And because they were not couered with houses for the temperature of the ayre, and that Region is not subiect to Clouds, they obserued the motions and eclipses of the starres, and whiles they often viewed them more curiously, fell to worship them. After that, they inuēted the monstrous shapes of Beasts, which they worshipped. Other men scattered through the World, admiring the Elements, the Heauen, Sunne, Land, Sea, without any Images & Temples worshipped them, and sacrificed to them sub dio, till in processe of time they erected Temples and Images to their most puissant Kings, & ordain∣ed vnto them Sacrifices and Incense: so wandering from the knowledge of the true GOD, they became Gentilos. Thus farre Lactantius. And it is not vnlike that they performed this to their Kings, either Bullinger de orig. erroris li. 1. ca. 9. in flatterie, or feare of their power, or because of the benefits which they receiued from them, this being (saith Plin. l. 34. c. 4. Pliny) the most ancient kind of thankfulnesse, to reckon their benefactors among the Gods. To which accor∣deth De Nat. D. l. 2. Cicero in the examples of Hercules, Castor, Pollux, Aesculapius, Liber, Romulus. And thus the Moores deified their Kings, and the Romans their deceased Emperors. The first that is named to haue set vp Images, and worship to the dead, was Ambros. in e∣pist. ad Roman. cap. 1. Ninus, who when his father Some think, and with pro∣bable coniect∣ture, that Belus was Nimrod. Belus was dead, he made an Image to him, & gaue priuiledge of sanctuarie to all offēders that resorted to this Image: wherupon, moued with a grace∣lesse gratefulnesse, they performed thereunto diuine honours. And this example was practised after by others. And thus of Bel or Belus began this Imagerie, & for this cause (saith Lyra. in Sap. 14. Petr. Comest. Hist. c. 40. Lyra) they called their Idols Bel, Baal, Beel-zebub, according to the diuersitie of Languages. Cyril. l. 3. cont. Iulian. Cyrillus calleth him Arbelus, and saith, That before the Floud was no Idolatrie amongst men, but it had beginning after in Babylon, in which, Arbelus (next after whom raigned Ninus) was worshipped. Tertullian Tertal. de idol. out of the booke of Enoch, before mentioned, is of opinion, That Idolatrie was before the Floud. Thus to conti∣nue the memorie of mortall men, & in admiration of the immortall heauenly Lights, together with the tyrannie of Princes, & policies of the Priests, begā this worshipping of the creature, with the contempt of the Creator: which how they encreased, by the mysteries of their Philosophers, the fabling of their Poets, the ambition of Potentates,
the Superstition of the Vulgar, the gainefull Collusion of their Priests, the Cunning of Artificers, and aboue all, the Malice of the Deuils, worshipped in those Idols, their giuing Answeres and Oracles, and receiuing Sacrifices, the Oenomaus out of esiod affi th the number of Gods in the world to be 30000: which number he saith was then much encrea∣sed. Euseb. de preparat. l. 5. c. 15. Histories of all Nations are ample witnesses. And this Romane Babylon, now Tyrant of the West, is the heire of elder Babylon (sometimes Ladie of the East) in these deuotions, that then and still Babylon might be the mother of Whoredomes and all Abhominations. To which aptly agree the Paralels of Babylon and Rome in O cf. l. 2. c. 2, 3. Orosius, the Empire of the one ceasing, when the other began first to haue a being; which he further prosecuteth in many particulars. But before wee prosecute these Babylonian affaires after the Floud, it shall not be amisse to shew here the Chaldaean fables of Antiquities before the Floud, out of Berosus, a Chaldaean Priest, which liued in the time of Alexander. Polyhistor Polyhist in Eus. Chron. citeth out of Berosus his first Booke this report of himselfe; and Tatianus Tatianus apud Scalig. sayth hee was the Priest of Belus, and wrote his Chaldaean storie to Antiochus, the third after Seleucus, in three bookes. His name by Scaligers interpretation signifieth the sonne of Osee. Alorus raigned the space of tenne Sari (Sarus with them is three thousand sixe hundred yeares) Alasparus, three Sari; Amelus, thirteene Sari; Amenus, twelue; Metalarus, eighteene; Daorus, tenne; Aedorachus, eighteene; Amphis, tenne; Oti∣artes, eight; Xixnthrus eighteene: in his time, as is said before, the Floud happened. The whole space is an hundred and twentie Sari, which amounteth to foure hundred thirtie two thousand yeares. This I thought not vnfit (although incredible) to report from Berosus, both because my scope is to declare as well false as true Religions (it be∣ing not Theologicall but Historicall, or rather Historically Theologicall) and because the Ancients, Cicero, Lactantius, Augustine: haue mentioned this monstrous Computa∣tion of the Chaldaean Kalendar, which yet they racke higher to foure hundred three∣score and tenne thousand yeres. Here you haue the particulars, out of Apollodorus and Abidenus, which both borrowed them of Berosus. Fragmenta hec e  in Chron. gr. Euseb. l. I. per Scalig. Polyhistor addeth, That there came one out of the red Sea, called Oannes, and Annedotus a Monster (otherwhere like a fish, his head, feet, and hands like a man, as sayth Photius but Al. Polyhistor ascribeth two heads, one of a Fish, and the other of a man) the Image whereof was vnto his times reserued. This Monster liued without meat, and taught them the knowledge of Letters, and all Arts, buildings of Cities, foundations of Temples, enacting of Lawes, Geometrie, and Husbandrie, and all necessaries to mans life. Afterwards he returned to the Sea: and after him appeared other such monsters. Foure of them came out of the Sea, sayth Abidenus, when Daos (whom Apollodorus calleth Daorus) raigned; their names were Enedocus, Eneugamus, Enaboulus, Anementus. Pentabiblus (it seemeth) was then their chiefe Citie. That Oannes the first did write of the first beginning: That all was darkenesse and water, in which liued monstrous creatures, hauing two formes; men with two wings, and some with foure; with one bodie, two heads, one of a man, and another of a woman, with the priuities of both sexes: others with hornes and legges like Goats; some with Horse feet; some like Centaures, the former part Men, the after part Horses: Buls also headed like Men, and Dogges with foure bodies &c. with many monstrous mixtures and confusions of creatures, whose Images were kept in the Temple of Belus. Ouer all these ruled a woman, named Omorka, which signifieth the Sea, and by like signification of Letters, the Moone. Then came Belus and cut her in twaine, and made the one halfe of her Land, the other Heauen, and the creatures therein appeared. This Belus made Men & Beasts, the Sunne, Moone, & Planets: These things reporteth Berosus in his first booke; in the second he telleth of the Kings (before mentioned) which raigned till the floud. After the floud also the same Polyhistor out of him sheweth, That Sisuthrus hauing, by Saturns warning before, built an Arke (as is be∣fore said) & layd vp all monuments of Antiquitie in Sipparis, a Citie dedicated to the Sunne, & now with all his world of creatures escaped the floud, going out of the Arke did sacrifice to the Gods, & was neuer seen more. But they heard a voice out of the aire giuing thē this precept, to be religious. His wife, daughter, & shipmaster were partakers
with him of this honour. He said vnto them, the Country where they now were was Ar∣menia, and he would come againe to Babylon, and that it was ordained, that from Sipparis they should receiue letters, and communicate the same to men: which they accordingly did. For hauing sacrificed to the gods, they went to Babylon and dig∣ged out the letters, writings, or bookes, and building many Cities, and founding Temples, did againe repaire Babylon. Thus farre out of Alexander Polyhistor, a large fragment of the true Berosus. CHAP. XI. Of the City and Countrey of Babylon: their sumptuous walles, Temples and Images. LEauing these Antiquities, rotten with age, let vs come to take better view of this stately City. Herodot. l. 2. Philostrat. devita Apollon.l. I.C. 18. Plin. lib 6.c.26.& Solinus e.60. report concerning the compasse of Babylon, That the walles contained 480. furlongs, situate in a large plain, foure square, inuironed with a broad & deep ditch ful of water: Diodor.l.3.c.4. saith, That ther were but so many furlongs as are daies in the yeare, so that euery day a furlong of the wall was built, and 1300000. work∣men imployed therein. Strabo Libr.16. ascribeth to the compasse 380. furlongs: and Curtius l.5.358 (ninety furlongs thereof inhabited, the rest allotted to tylth and husbandry.) Concerning the thicknes of the walls, or the height, they also disagree. The first Au∣thors affirme the height 200, cubites, the thicknesse 50. They which say least, cut off halfe that summe. Politic.l.3.t. Wel might Aristotle esteeme it a country rather than a city: and, not without cause, was it reckoned among the wonders of the world. It had 100. brasen gates, & 250. towers. It was indeed a mother of wonders: so many miracles of Art ac∣companied the same, the works partly of Semiramis, partly of Nabuchodonosor: which I would desire the Reader to stay his hastie pace, and take notice of. Euery where I shall not, I can not, be so tedious in these kinds of relations. Diodor.lib.3. (or after the Greek l.2.c.4.) thus addeth of Semiramis; She built also a bridge of fiue furlongs. The walls were made of bricke & asphaltum, a slimy kind of pitch which that country yiel∣deth. She built two pallaces, which might serue both for ornament and defence; one in the west, which inuironed sixty furlongs; with high brick walls: within that a lesse, and within that also a lesse circuit which containeth the tower. These were wrought sumptuously with images of beasts, and therein also was game and hunting of beasts: this had 3. gates. The other in the east, on the other side the riuer, contained but 30. furlongs. In the lower country of Babylonia she made a great square lake containing 200. furlongs: the walls where of were of bricke, and that pitchy morter; the depth. thirtie fiue foot. In the midst of the Citie she erected a Temple to Iupiter Belus (saith Herodotus lib.2.) with brazen gates (now in his time remayning) foure square: each square containing two , a furlong is six hundred foot . furlongs, in the midst whereof is a solid tower of the height and thicknes of a furlong: vpon this another, & so one higher then another, eight in number. In the highest tower is a chappell, and therein a faire bed couered, and a ta∣ble of gold, without any Image. Neither, as the Chaldaean Priests affirme, doth any abide here in the night, but one woman, whom this God shal appoint. They say the God himselfe there lieth. In regard of this exceeding height, Diodorus affirmes, that the Chaldaeans did thereon make their obseruations of the Starres. Hee also addeth, that Semiramis placed in the top three golden statues: one of Iupiter forty foot long, weighing a thousand Babylonian talents; till his time remaining: an other of Ops, weighing asmuch, sitting in a golden throne, & at her feet two lions, & iust by, huge serpents of siluer, each of 30. talents: the third Image was of Inno standing, in weight 800.talents. Her right hand held the head of a serpēt, her left, a scepter of stone. To all these was common, 1 table of gold 40 foot long, in breadth 12, in weight 50 talents.
There were also two standing Cuppes of thirtie talents, and two vessells for perfume of like value: Three other vessells of gold, whereof one, dedicated to Iupiter, weigh∣ed twelue hundred Babylonian talents: (euery Babylonian talent is said to containe seuen thousand drachma Atticae, sixtie three pounds, nine ounces, and an halfe, and halfe a quarter Troy weight.) All these the Persian Kings tooke away. Without the Temple, by Herodotus testimony, was a golden Altar, and an other huge one besides, for their solemne sacrifices, the other being not to be polluted with bloud, except of sucking things. In that greater the Chaldaeans burnt yerely in their sacrifices a hundred thousand talents of Libanotus. One statue of gold twelue cubits high 'Darius, affecting, spared: but Xerxes both tooke it, and slew the priest that for∣bade him. I might heere also tell of those Pensile gardens, borne vp on arches, foure square, each square containing 4. hundred foot: filled on the roofe with earth, where∣in grew great trees and other plants. The entrance was (as it were) a hill: the arches were builded one vpon another in conuenient height, still increasing as they ascen∣ded: the highest which bare the walls were fiftie cubits high, and twelue in breadth: There were within these arches, Innes. There was also a conueyance of water to the watering therof. This garden was made long after Semiramis time by Arege Syro. Diod. a king which heerein seemed to lord it ouer the Elements and countermaund Nature, being him∣selfe the seruant of his wiues appetite, who in this lowly vally wherein Babilon stood, would faine haue some representation of her owne hilly and mountainous country of Media. This King was Nabuchodonosor, as witnesseth Beros.fragm. apud Ioseph. contra Appian. lib. 1. Berosus in Iosephus, who hauing conquered Egypt, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, inriched the Temple of Belus with the spoiles, and added a new citie to the olde, without the same. And prouiding that the enemy might not after turne the course of the riuer, and approch to the city, he compassed the inner city with three walls, and the vtter city with as many, these of brick, those also with bitumen, or pitchie slime of that countrey, adding thereunto stately gates. And neare his fathers pallace he built another more sumptuous: and this hee did in fifteene dayes. Therein he raised stone-works like vnto mountains, and plan∣ted the same with all manner of trees. Hee made also a pensile garden. Many more things (saith Iosephus) doth Berosus adde, and blameth the Greeke Writers for ascri∣bing the building of Babylon to Semiramis an Assyrian. This fragment of Berosus cited by Iosephus, doth well serue vs to cleare both the holy and prophane Historie. In the one, Daniel Dan. 4.27. induceth Nabuchodonosor walking in his royall pallace in Babel, with words answerable to his pride, Is not this great Babel that I haue builded for the house of the kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my maiestie? His words (euen in the speaking) were written in the Booke of God, and an enditement thereof framed in the highest Court; where he was adiudged presently the losse of Reason, which he had thus abused, Till hee knew that the most High bare rule ouer the kingdome of men, giuing the same to whom soeuer he will. Well might he say he had built it, in regard of this new city & pallace, with other miracles thereof: with more truth then some Expositors, which accuse him herein of a lie, for arrogating that which Se∣miramis did. And for Semiramis, profane histories generally make her the founder of this City, and among others Pseudo Beros.lib. 5. Annius his Berosus, who (contrary to this fragment of the true Berosus in Iosephus) saith, that Semiramis made Babylon of a towne, a great City, that she might be rather esteemed the builder thereof, then enlarger. Nimrod had before built the Tower, but not finished it, and did not Nec designa∣tam vrbem sun∣dauit. lib. 4. found the citie, which hee had de∣signed and set out, and Belus his sonne had Fundamenta designata Baby∣loniae, oppidi magis quamvr∣bis, crexit. erected those designed foundations ra∣ther of the towne then the city Babylon. Moses testifieth that at the first building, they were (by confusion of language) forced to cease their worke, Genesis 11.8. lea∣uing a name of their shame, instead of that renowne and name, which they had pro∣mised to themselues. It may be that Semiramis did amplifie this: and happily so did other Assyrian and Babylonian kings, as Augustine and Abydenus affirme; Hanc
quidam putant condidisse Babylon, quam quidem potuit instaurare, August. de ciuitate Dei li.18.ca.2. likewise Abydenus in Euseb. Praep.lib.9. saith, that the walles being by inun∣dation fallen, were built againe by Nabuchodonosor, and agreeth in other things with Berosus. But the Graecians are children, in comparison of antient History, and little of this matter can we affirme on their testimonie; their first Historian Herodotus liuing long after this age in the time of the Persian monarchie. Howsoeuer, Nabuchodonosor is he which (by diuine and humane testimony) there established that golden head of the Image, the seate of the Babylonian monarchie, raising it to that high top of world∣ly excellence. Yea Daniel cha.3. speaketh of one more sumptuous Image, then anie mentioned by Herodotus and Diodorus set vp by this king threescore cubits high, and six broad, enioyning a Catholike and vniuersall idolatry thereunto, which the three Saints Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused, and in a fierie triall, were found both Martyrs and Confessors. Strab.lib. 15. Strabo out of Megasthenes (whom Aunius hath set out as truly as he hath done Berosus, saue that he stutted at the name, and called him Metasthenes Anny. Metasthenes) saith of this King whom he nameth Nabocodrosor, more esteemed of the Chaldaeans then Hercu∣les, that he came in his expeditions as farre as the Pillars of Hercules (the straights of Gibraltar) and as farre as Tearcon the Aethiopian, and that he conducted an armie out of Iberia into Thracia, and Pontus. This Tearcon is he whom the Scripture cal∣leth Tirhaka, which warred against Senacherib. 2.Kings 19.9. But to returne to our pensile gardens, which Diodorus and Curtius attribute to a Syrian King (which was no other but this Conqueror of Syria, Nabuchodonosor) and both they and Strabo doe at large describe and account among the worlds wonders, as were also the bridge and the walls of the citie. And no lesse wonderfull was that Obeliske, or needle: a square stone made spire-fashion, cut by Semiramis out of the mountains of Armenia, one hundred and fiftie foot long, and foure and twentie thick, on many waines brought to the riuer, thence to Babylon, and there erected. Plinie testifieth, that the Temple of Belus still remained in his dayes: and that Belus was in∣uentor of Astronomie. This Temple was the same with the Sepulchre of Belus, which Strabo saith was rased by Xerxes: yet not so, but that Alexander would haue repaired it; but in regard that it asked so much labour and time (for onely the cleansing of the earth required tenne thousand men two moneths worke) hee was not able to finish that which he had begunne. In the Description he saith lesse then Herodotus, that it was a Pyramis or spire-worke a furlong or sixe hundred foote in height, and each of the foure squares containing as much. Arrianus Arrian de rebus gestis A∣lexand.lib.3. affirmeth that Alexander had the same of other Temples also. The Temples, saith he, which Xerxes had ouerthrowne, he commanded to be repaired, and among them the Temple of Belus, whom the Ba∣bylonians with singular Religion worship. Ar.lib.7. At his returne homewards, Belus in thankfulnesse (it seemeth) sent his Chaldaean Priests to meet him, and forbid him to enter the citie, as he loued his life, whose oracle Alexander contemning, there ended his daies. The cause why he listened not to them, is thought a mistrust that he con∣ceiued of the Chaldaeans. For whereas Xerxes, at his returne out of Greece, had ra∣sed this and all other sacred places of the Babylonians: Alexander minding the re∣paire hereof, hauing already remoued the rubbish, thought with his whole armie to atchieue this enterprise. But the reuenue which the Kings of Assyria had left for the maintenance of this Temple-sacrifices, after the ouerthrow thereof, was shared a∣mong the Chaldaeans; which they by this attempt were like to loose, and therefore were willing to want his presence. This Temple some suppose to be that Tower of Babel mentioned by Moses Gen. 11. and supposed still in part to remaine. For about seauen or eight miles from Bag∣dat, as men passe from Felugia a towne on Euphrates, whereon old Babylon stood, to this new citie on Tigris (a worke of eighteene houres, and about fortie miles space) there is seene a ruinous shape of a shapelesse heap and building, in circuit lesse then a
mile, (some say, but a quarter of a mile) about the height of the stone-worke on Pauls steeple in London: the brickes being six inches thicke, eight broad, and a foot long (as master Allen measured) with mattes of Canes laid betwixt them, yet remaining as sound, as if they had beene laid within a yeares space. Thus master Eldred, & mai∣ster Fitch, maister Cartwright also, and my friend maister Allen, by testimony of their owne eies, haue reported. But I can scarce thinke it to be that Tower or Temple, be∣cause Authors place it in the middest of old Babylon, and neare Euphrates: although I will not contend about it. Some affirme, ( Verstga Antiq. I know not with what truth) that Nim∣rods Tower was in height fiue thousand one hundred seuentie and foure paces. But it is now, as we see, come to confusion. Also there is yet beyond Tigris some ruines of a Temple, which is called the Temple of Bel, with high yron gates, as is reported. Dominicus Niger Dom Nig. Asia Com. 4. hath these words: Seleucia in processe of time hath changed her state and her site. For it was on the westerne banke of Tigris, which a Cut from Eu∣phrates slowed into; in which place are now seene the ruines thereof, where the shepheards haue erected them cottages: and on the Easterne banke haue the Barba∣rians built the City and called it Bachdad, right ouer-against the old. If this be true, vaine is the conceit of credulous Trauellers, which suppose those ruines to bee the monuments of Babylons buriall, and confound againe this later world, with the re∣ports of Babels Tower. The Bitumen or slimie pitch which they vsed in stead of morter in their building, is, as Dominicus Niger Dom Nig. Asia Com. 4. out of Trogus reporteth, common in those parts. Herodotus telleth, that eight dayes iourney from Babylon was another Citie, named IS, with a small rill of the same name, which runneth into Euphrates, carrying thither (as tri∣bute) much of this slimie matter. Niger mentioneth one place, where out of a clift or opening of the earth proceedeth such a stinke, that it killeth the birds which flie ouer it. And at this day, two daies iourney from Bagdat R.itche.Hak. Voy.to.3. at a place called Ait, is a mouth continually throwing forth boiling pitch, therefore by the Moores called Hel-mouth, which runneth into a great field alwayes full thereof: and herewith they pitch their boats. The water, as my friend maister Allen (who liued in Bagdat diuers moneths) told me, is warme & accounted medicinable, for which cause he hath drunke large∣ly thereof: the liquid pitch floateth on the toppe of the water, like clouted creame, to vse his owne phrase. The Country of Babylonia hath beene the most fruitfull in the world, Hero.lib.2. yeelding ordinarily two hundred, and in some places three hundred increase: the blades of the wheat and barly about foure fingers broad. Plinn et. hist. lib.18.ca.17. Plinie, somewhat otherwise: They cut (saith he) or mowe their corne twice, and feed it a third time in Babylonia, other∣wise it would be nothing but blade: & yet so their barrener land yeeldeth fiftie, their best an hundred increase. Tigris and Euphrates ouerflow it, but bring not fatnesse to the soile, as Nilus in Egypt, but rather cleanse that superfluous fatnesse which natu∣rally it hath. The soile is of a rosennie clay, saith master Allen, and would still retaine in likeli∣hood his antient fertilitie, if it were watered with like diligent husbandry: In dig∣ging it yeeldeth corrupt waters, sauouring of that pitchy slime. In the antient Ba∣bylon, it seemeth that in euery garden of any citizen of sort were rilles made out of the riuer. The ruines from the tower aforesaid to Bagdat (which some call Babylon) & beyond on the other side of the riuer, containe twentie two miles, yet to be seene: which happily are the ruines, not of old Babylon, so much, as of the neighbor townes here built, Seleucia, Vologesocerta, and Ctesiphon: which I rather thinke, because they reach beyond Tigris as well as on this side. To returne to the religious places in Babylon: Caelius Rhodig. lect. Antiq.lib.8.ca. 12. tells, that in the Temple of Apollo, was found a golden Chest of great antiquity, which being broken by some accident, thence issued a pestilent vapour, that infected not those alone which were present, but the neighbouring Nations, as farre as Par∣thia, Ammianus Marcellinus Ammian.l.23 hath the like Historie of the Image of Apollo Chomens
at Seleucia, which was brought to Rome, and there placed by the Priests in the tem∣ple of Apollo Palatinus: and whenas a certaine hole which the Chaldaean Wise-men had by Art stopped, through the couetousnesse of certaine souldiers breaking in thi∣ther for spoile, was broken vp, the world was thence poysoned with a contagion from Persia, as far as France. Philost. de i∣ta Apol.lib. I. cap 18. Philostratus tells of Apollonius, that he saw at Babylon such stately Palaces, as scarce agree with the state of Babylon in the time of Apollo∣nius, which was while Domician reigned: amongst other things he saw Galleries full of Greeke Images, as of Orpheus, Andromeda, &c. He came also into a Gallery, the roofe whereof was made bowing like the heauens, and couered with Saphire, so to resemble Heauen, and the Images of their Gods, made of gold, were there set. From the roofe there hanged foure birds of gold, representing the Goddesse of Reuenge, which they called the tongues of the Gods, I know not by what art or mysterie, ad∣monishing the King not to exalt himselfe. CHAP. XII. Of the Priests, Sacrifices, religious Rites, and customes of the Babylonians. THe Chaldeans (saith Dio. Sic.l. 3. cap. 8. Diodorus) were of reputation in Babylon, as the Priests in Egypt: Chaldaean, being a name sometime applied to the whole Nation; sometime appropriated to the Priests, who spent their whole time in religious seruices, and in Astrologie. Many of them by Diuination foretold things to come, as we haue shewed be∣fore in the Historie of Alexander; and the booke of Daniel witnesseth this their pro∣fession. By their auguries, or diuination by birds, by sacrifices and enchantments, they were accounted to doe good or harme to mankind. They were most expert in their sacred Rites, in the knowledge whereof they were brought vp from their child-hood; and continued in that course of learning all their liues, the childe being instructed in his fathers science. They professed the interpretation of dreames, and prodigious accidents in Nature. Their opinions were, That the world is eternal, with∣out beginning and end: the order and furniture of all was done by diuine prouidence: all heauenly things were perfected, not by chance, or of their owne accord, but by the determinate and firme decree of the Gods. By long obseruation searching the course and nature of the Starres, they foretold things to come. But the greatest Power they attributed to the fiue Planets, and especially to Saturne. They call them Mercuries, because when others are fixed, these haue their proper motion, and shew future things, as the Interpreters of the Gods, by their rising, setting, and colour. Vn∣der their course they giue the title of Gods Dij Consul∣tores. to thirtie other Starres, the one halfe, a∣boue; the other, vnder the earth, beholding all accidents. And in ten dayes one of the higher is sent to the lower, as an angell, or messenger of the Starres, and one from them to the higher: And this course they take eternally. They hold twelue principall Gods, each of which hath his peculiar moneth, and his signe in the Zodiake; by which the Sunne, and Moone, and fiue Planets, haue their motion. These Planets they esteeme to conferre much good or euill in the ge∣neration of men, and by their nature and aspect, things to come may be foreknowne. Many things they foretold to Alexander, Nicanor, Antigonus, Seleucus, and to priuate men, beyond the reach of men. They number foure and twentie constellations without the Zodiake, twelue towards the North, and as many towards the South. These Northernely are seene, which they attribute to the liuing: those Southernely are hid∣den; and present (they thinke) to the dead, whch they hold the Iudges of all. Con∣cerning the site, motion and eclipse of the Moone, they hold as the Greekes; but of the Sunnes Eclipse they haue diuers opinions, and dare not vtter their opinion there∣of, nor foretell the time. The earth they conceiued to be hollow like a boat. They rec∣koned 43000. yeares, vntill the comming of Alexander, since first they had begunne their obseruations of the Starres.
These years Xenophon de aquiuocis interpreteth of months: for so (saith he) the Chal∣deans reckoned their antiquities; in other things they kept their computation accor∣ding to the Sunne. But of their fabulous antiquities we haue heard before: where we haue also touched, that one beginning of Idolatry did arise of this curious & supersti∣tious Star-gazing, especially in the countries of Egypt, where not at all vsually; and in Chaldaea, where diuers months Eight mo∣neths toge∣ther, Master Eldred. Hak. Voy. tom 2. together they haue neither raines nor clouds. Strabo diuideth the Chaldeans into sects, Orchent, Borsippeni, & others, diuersly opinionate of the same things. Borsippa was a Citie sacred to Diana and Apollo. Some Philostat. de vita Apol.lib. 1. do call the Babylonian Priests, Magi; but because they were by this name best knowne & most esteemed among the Persians, which in that vicinity of regions had as neere neighborhood in religions, we will speake of these Magi, in our Persian relations. And it is thought that the Persian Magi came frō these Chaldeans. Mornae∣us Ph. Morn. de Verit. C.R. reckoneth among the Chaldeā opiniōs, that of Oromases, Mitris, & Ariminis, that is to say, GOD, Mind & Soule: which he applieth to the Christian doctrine of the holy Trinity. The Oracle of Apollo, pronoūced the Chaldeans & Hebrews to be only wise. The Chaldean opinion concerning iudiciall Astrologie, was not receiued of all the Chaldeans, as Strabo reporteth. And Bardesanes Syrus, the best learned of the Chaldeans (it is Euseb. testimony Euseb. de prae∣yar. Eu.l. 6.c.8. ) doth at large confute that opinion (which yet ma∣ny Wisards, carkasses of Christians, still follow) He affirmeth that in those things which a man hath common with a beast, eating, sleepe, nourishment, age, &c. a man is ordered by Nature, as the beasts are. But Man hauing also a reasonable soule, & free∣dome of wil, is not subiect to that naturall seruitude; which at large he proueth by the diuers customes of men, both in diuers, & in the same coūtries, in diet, gouernmēt, and religion: as the Reader, willing to read so worthy a discourse, may find related at large in Euseb. Alexander Polyhistor Euseb. de prae∣yar.lib.9. cap. 4. out of Eupolemus, telleth that in the tenth generation after the Floud, in Camyrine a citie of Babylonia, which other call Vr, Abram was borne, which excelled all in knowledge, & was the inuentor of Astrology among the Chaldeans. He by diuine precept went into Phaenicia, and taught the Phaenicians the course of the Sunne & Moone: & when the Armenians, warring vpon the Phaenicians, had taken his brothers son prisoner, he by a band of his seruāts recouered him, & free∣ly dismissed the captiues, which he had taken. He after liued with the Priests at Helio∣polis in Egypt, & taught them Astrology; confessing that he had receiued that Art by succession from Enoch. He addeth that Belus reigned the second in Babylon, and was called Saturne, the father of a second Belus, and Canaan; which Canaan was the father of the Phaenicians, and the Aethiopians, brother of Mizraim the Author of the E∣gyptians: with many other things not much differing from the Diuine Historie. Astronomy in all likelihood was knowne to Abraham, to whom the heauenly stars might be Remembrancers of that promise, so shall thy seed be: his country also, where it was practised, might therin further him, & the excellence of the Science in itselfe. But this Star-gazing destiny, Iudicial, Cōiectural, Genethliacal Astrology, Reason, & Ex∣perience, GOD and Man haue condemned. Vr signifieth light, which agreeth to the Fire, the Chaldean deity, Ammian.l. 23. Plutar defacie in orbe Lunae. which the Persiās & Chaldeans fained to haue receiued frō heauen, & kept euer burning; as the Vestals in Rome. They held Water and Fire to be the beginning of al things. They made a chalenge of this their fiery God, to contend with any other gods of the godlesse Heathen: an Egyptian encountred & ouercame them thus: he caused his Canopus to be made ful of holes, stopped with wax, & hollow in the middle, which he filled with water: & the Chaldeans putting their fire vnder, the waxe melting, opened a quiuer of watry arrowes, that cooled the heat of their de∣uouring god, and deuoured him. They had yet a more foolish God, euen an Alex. ab A∣lexand.l. 6. 26. Onyon which they worshipped. They obserued diuers wicked Sciences, of diuining, by Fire, Aire, Water, Earth, consulting with the dead, and with wicked spirits.—Chaldaea vo∣catis Imperat arte dijs, saith Claudian. Euery day the King Coelius l. 8.c. 1. offered a Horse, furnished, vnto the Sunne; as did also the Persians. Philostrat. saith, that it was a white Horse of the Nisaean race, sumptuously trapped, lib. 1. cap. 20. They obserued a feast in Babylon (Athenoeus Athen.lib. 14. cap.17. citeth it out of
Berosus) on the sixteenth Calends of September, which continued fiue daies; in which the Masters were subiect to their seruants, and one of them, royally attired, was car∣ried out of the house, whom they called Zoganes. Baruch cap.6. in the Epistle of Ie∣remte (Apocrypha) rippeth vp their idolatrous Rites, Idols, Processions, bearing Idols on mens shoulders, the people before and behind worshipping: their Priests collusiens to make gaines of the Idol-offerings, together with their Priests shauen heads and beards, their rent cloaths, their roaring before the Idoll: their Temples wherein they stood with scepters, axes, or other weapons in their hands, hauing candles lighted before them, with other such rites; that, in the reading, one would thinke he were telling the discourse of the mysteries of mystical Babylon in the West; so euenly they accord. The Chaldeans innocate their Be∣lus, to do: miracles also saith he, innocating a dumble I doll, to giue speech to another, which himselfe wanteth. But aboue all, one beastly rite was in vse among them. The women, saith he, Bar. 6.42. sit in the waies girded with cords of rushes, and burne straw: and if one of them be drawne away, and he with any, such as come by, she casteth her neighbour in the teeth, be∣cause shee was not so worthily reputed, nor her cord broken. Thus was their glorie their shame. Hero. Clio. Strabo. lib 16. mentioneth the same. Herodotus will yeeld vs a Commentary on this place. The Babylonians haue an abominable law (saith he) that all their women once in their life do sit at the Tem∣ple of Venus to haue familiaritie with strangers: the richer sort comming in chariots, richly furnished and attended to this vngodly purpose. Their manner of sitting is, crowned on their temples with garlands, their retiring places distinguished with cords, by which the stranger may haue accesse to which of them he liketh best. And thus do these Votaries of Venus sit, holding it religion to be irreligious, none of them euer returning home, til some guest haue cast money into her lap, whom it is not law∣full for her to refuse, but to accept of him and his price, whatsoeuer he be, and follow him aside from the Temple, where he defileth her. At the giuing of the mony he vseth these words, Tantitibi deam Mylitt am imploro: that is, at this price, or for so much, I implore vnto thee the Goddesse Mylitta (so the Assyrians call Venus) and this money is consecrated to a sacred vse. After this, with the Goddesse good leaue, she may re∣turne home, although for no great price againe (saith our Author) to be hired. By this means the fairest are quickly dispatched, the rest endure a restles & irkesome penāce, sometime a yeare, two, or three, before they can be discharged of their honesty & the law together. And hence might arise that former ambitious vpbraiding in Baruch. Among their many Idols, Bel bare the bell, not here alone, but in al the countries of Assyria, & adioyning thereto; as appeareth in the History of the Bible: where Bel or Baal is so often mentioned, as the Idol of so many nations, & the sin of the apostatical synagogue. They Ier. 19.5. Icrem. 32. 1. Reg. 18. & 16. 2. Reg. 23. & 10. Ose. 2.Es. 46. built vnto him high places: or els in stead therofvsed the roofes of their houses to his worship: they built him houses, they made him Images, erected Altars, planted groues, bended to him the knee, & kissed him in token of subiection, vsed perfume & intense, obserued to him holy daies, cut & lanced themselues in his seruice, with other extaticall fu∣ries, & religious frenzies, with ornaments of gold and iewels, inuocations and immo∣lations, yea of their owne children: he had also his peculiar Prophets & Priests. These and such like doth the Scripture mention of this Babylonian Idol, whose contagion infected the East with a Catholike Idolatry that could plead Antiquitie, Vniuersalitie, and Consent, by euidence of Scripture-historie (which later Babylon cannot do) and yet was but Catholike and generall errour. Ribera affirmeth Rib. in Hos.2. that diuers later Authors, & before them Inler 32. Theodcret, do esteeme the name Bel or Baal to be a generall name, agreeing to all the Gods of the Gentiles, according to the signification of the word, to wit, a Lord. Nic. Strar. in Iudic. It was a name generall to their Idols, whē it was put alone, but particular with some addition, as Bel-zebub, Ba∣al-zephon. And Seruius On those words of Virgil. , nicro pateram, quam Belus & omnes à Beln sol, &c. Aeneid.1. is author, that Belus the father of Dido descended of that an∣cient Belus the first King of the Assyrians, which people worshipped Saturne & Iuno, which were after worshipped in Africa, whereupon the Punikes called God, Bal, (from whence came those names Hannibal, Adherbal, and such like) whom the Assyrians in some respect call Bel, and Saturne, and the Sunne. This opinion that in Bel they
worshipped the Sunne, is followed by Tremellius and Iunius in their notes on Esaias, chap.46.1. because the Assyrians, Persians, and Babylonians, accounted the Sunne the greatest God, and worshipped the Fire as a particle thereof: To him the Iewes, with this borrowed forren Idolatrie, dedicated horses and chariots, which Iosias . King.23.11 a∣bolished, together with the Altars on the roose of Ahaz his house, and the high pla∣ces, where their God might see their deuotions. Hierome, on that place of Esay, saith, that Bel was Saturne, which Suidas confirmeth. Augustine Aug.tom.4.quaest.lib.7.16. relateth the vsuall opi∣nion (on those words, Iud.2. They serued Baal and Astaroth) that Baal in those parts was the name of Iupiter, and Astarte of Iuno, and produceth the Punike language, in which Baalsamen signifieth the LORD of Heauen; and for Astaroth (which he rea∣deth Astartibus) he saith it is in the plurall number, in regard of the multitude of Iu∣no's Images, each bearing the name of Iuno. This also is exemplified in the blessed Vir∣gin by Ribera, sometime called our Lady of Loretto, sometime our Ladie of Monte∣ferato, &c. according to the diuersitie of places, wherein they worship, not Mary the Virgin, but their owne Idols; the daughters of their whorish mother Babylon. For the Tyrians, Sydonians, Philistims, and other Syrian, and Assyrian nations, the Scripture brandeth them with this Bel or Baal-Idolatry: in hatred of which name, the Iewes called the Prince of Diuels, as the Acaronites did their principall Idols, by the name of Beelzebub. Thus the Greekes and Latines haue confounded the Assyrian and Tyrian Bel, which by Iosephus Scalig. Can.Isagog. lib 3. pag 314. Scaliger (who not vnworthily is called Od. Drayton. Polyolb. the Dictator of know∣ledge and great Prince of learnings state) are distinguished and made two: the one (saith he) is written  and the later  and reproueth Hierome for making Belus, the father of Ninus, and the Virgilian Belus to be one: In Photius (559. 3.) is mentioned, that the Phaeuicians and Syrians called Saturne ΗΛ, and Βὴλ, EL, and Bel, and Bolathes. Doctor Willet in his Comment vpon Dan. cap. 1.q.16.hath these words: The Chal∣deans had fiue Idols, three Gods, and two Goddesses. Their first God was Bel, a name contracted of Behel, which commeth of Bahal, which signifieth a Lord: to whom was built that Temple before mentioned. The second was the Sunne, which they called Rach, that is, a King; because he is chiefe among the Planets: and the Persians call him Muhra, as Iustinus Martyr saith, Dialog. in Triphon. the Priests of this Idoll were called Racrophantoe Obseruers of the Sunne. Their third God was Ne∣go, the Fire; so called of the brightnes, which was carried about among them. Their first Goddesse was Shacha, which was the Earth, worshipped also of the Romans vn∣der the names of Tellus and Opis: of the Syrians called Dorcetha. In the honor of this Goddesse they vsed to keepe a feast fiue dayes together in Babylon; during which time the Masters were vnder the dominion of their seruants. This festiuall time was called Shache, whereof Babylon was called Sheshach, of keeping this feast, I erem. 25. 27. and 51.41. Their other Goddesse was Mulitta, which was Venus, whose Priests were called Natitae, or Natophantae Polan. But the chiefest of their Idols was Bel. He also interpreteth Quaest. 16. those words Dan. 1.4. Whom they might teach the learning and tongue of the Chaldeans, of Schooles wherein youth were brought vp in goodlet∣ters, to be after employed in the State. So among the Egyptians they had the like vse, where Moses was taught the learning of the Aegyptians. Among the Israelites eight and forty Cities were appointed for the Leuites, which were as the common Schools and Vniuersities for the whole kingdome. Samuel and Elizeus had their Schooles and Colledges of Prophets: yea the rude Indians had their Gymnosophistes; and the Ro∣mans had their Colledges of Augures. Thus farre Doctor Willet of their Idols and Schooles. In the seuenteenth chapter of the second booke of Kings is mentioned Sucoth Be∣noth and Idoll of the Babylonians. Beda interpreteth it the Tabernacles of Benoth: and so the word Sucoth vsed, Amos 5.25.is by Saint Stephen, Act.7.43.interpreted. And so doth the Ra.in Gloss∣ordin. Glosse on that place of the Kings interprete; where Lyra Lyra.in 4. Reg.17. according to the signification of the words (a Tabernacle of wings) relateth out of Rab.Sal. that
this Idoll was made like to a Hen brooding her chickens: which Idols the Babyloni∣ans framed in worship of that Constellation, called by the vulgar, the Hen and chic∣kens, and of the learned, Pleiades; as others did to the Sunne, others to the Moone. Some Wolph.in a. Reg.17. apply it to the mysterie of their Idoll, (which CHRIST the Truth, truely saith of himselfe) protecting his worshippers, as a hen her chickens. In the fourteenth chapter of Daniel, as the Latines reade, is a large historie both of Bel, a dead statue, and of a liuing Dragon, which the Babylonians worshipped. The Priests of Bel were seuentie, besides their wiues and children, whose fraud and cou∣senage Daniel detected, making it manifest by their foot-steps in the ashes, which he had strewed in the Temple, that they were the deuourers of that huge portion of for∣tie sheepe, twelue measures of meale, and six great pots of wine, daily consecrated for Bels break-fast. He after slew the Dragon also; for which the Babylonians forced the King to lodge him six dayes among the Lions. But howsoeuer generally more authoritie is to be ascribed to the Apocriphall bookes, then to any humane historie, or other Ecclesiasticall Authors, as Zanchius in his Confession religiously holdeth; yet for this fragment of Daniel, it is accounted Whitak. de Scrip. quaest.1.cap.9. the worke of Thedotion a bad man, who foisted it into his translation. And not only the Reformed Churches account it as it is, but Driedo a learned Papist, Erasmus a Semi-christian (so Bellarmine calleth him) Iulius Africanus of old, and the Iewes generally, reiect it out of the Canon, as the Cardinall himselfe Bel. de verbe Dci lib. I. cap. 9. hath obserued: and he is faine to tell vs of another Daniel of the Tribe of Leui, to maintaine the credit hereof. But Hicrome in the Preface of his Com∣mentaries stileth them, Belis Draconis{que} fabulas, quas veru anteposito eo{que}. iugulante, sub∣iect, ne videretur apud imperitos magnam partem voluminū detruneasse: and alleageth Eusebius, Origen, Apollinarius, and other Ecclesiasticall Doctors, which were of his mind, and thought that they needed not to answere Porphyrie, who had hence raked some obiections against the Christians, for these things which had not authoritie of Scripture. As for Pyramus, and Thysbe, with Cyparissus and such like, I leaue them to Metamorph. 4. & 10. Ouid and the Poets. It seemeth worthie relation that fell out at Aslus, a Babylonian Citie, where a Dolphin so loued a Boy, that following too farre after their wonted spor∣tings, he stucke fast in the sands: Solinus c.18. which Alexander interpreting to be ominous, preferred the Boy to the Priesthood of Neptune. For the present Saracenicall Religion, now obserued in these parts, our third book shall largely relate thereof. Concerning other Babylonian customes: Herodotus, l.2. telleth of three families in Babylon which liued on fish. It may be the Carthusians of our Westerne Babylon are of their of-sping: for whose sparing, their fellowes may eate the more flesh, with which those of old, and these later, may not (forsooth) pollute themselues. Duint.Curt.lib.5. Curtius telleth generally that, for fleshly vices, the Babyloni∣ans were most corrupt. They prostituted their wiues and daughters to their guests for rewards. They were addicted to excessiue banketting, and drunkennesse. In the beginning of their feasts, their women were modestly attired; by degrees they strip∣ped themselues of their cloathes, beginning with the vpper-most, till nothing was left to couer their shame, or forbid their shamelessenesse. And not their Curtizans a∣lone, but their Matrons, (yea, in token of ciuilitie) did thus prostitute themselues to those flames of lusts which haue come from hell, and carrie thither. Heere was Alex∣anders manly and victorious armie made effeminate, vnfit after to haue encountred with a strong enemie. Coe'ius Rhod. lib.8. cap.11. Some ascribe the loose liues of the Babylonians, to a law of Xerxes, who to chastise them for a rebellion, enacted that they should no longer weare armes, but addict themselues to Musicke, riot, and such like.

WE haue before Chap. 10. shewed the prodigious Chronologie of the Chalde∣ans, reckoning the reignes of their Kings before the Floud, 43 2000. yeares.

Antiochus Cyzicenus 18. Philippus 2. In all 237. And from the beginning of the first Dynastie 2633. These I haue heere inserted out of Scaliger, rather to shew the continued succession of the Easterne Empire, then with any intent to perswade, that all these were Kings, and ruled the countrey of Baby∣lonia. For after Arsaces rebelled, the Parthians dispossessed the Syrian Kings of these parts: and before, the Babylonians often rebelled: as in the time of the Persi∣ans, when Zopyrus by a strange stratageme, recited by Iustin and others, restored them to Darins: but especially in the times of the Medes, whose Dynastie was much disquieted: sometime the Scythians ( Oros. lib. 1. cap. 19. saith Orosius) and sometimes the Chaldeans, and sometimes the Medes preuailing. Sometimes also (as the Scripture witnesseth) the Assyrians renewed their ancient power. Yea in the time of the Assyrian Dyna∣stie, the Chaldeans are said to warre (in the reigne of Panyas) against the Phaenici∣ans, which argueth that they were then free. The Scripture and other Histories speake of Phul, Teglath-Phalasar, Iareb, Sargon, Salman-asar, Senacherib, Asar-haddon: which were great and mightie, not onely strong enough to defend themselues against the Medes, but to inuade forren Nations, yea did translate people from one kingdome to another, and 2. Reg. 17. 24. seated the captiues of Israel in the Cities of the Medes, and sent Babylonian Colonies to Sama∣ria; which they could not do, if they had not commanded both Assyria, and Media, with Babylonia. Nabonassar rebelled, as is said, against Artycas, and began the Chaldean Dyna∣stie, from whom, for this restitution of libertie, the Chaldeans began their Astrono∣micall computations: he reigned 14. yeares, Nassyus 2. Chinzerus and Porus 5. Di∣Iulans 5. Mardokempadus 12. Called Me∣rodach. Hee sent Ambassadours to Hezekia. Arkeanos 5. Interregnum 12. Belithus 3. Aporonadicus 6. Herigebalus 1. Nesnoemondacus 4. In∣terregnum 17. Ieracdin 13. Saosducinus 9. Kiniladachus 14. Nabopellasarus 29. (In the seuenteenth yeare of his reigne, hee sent his sonne Nabuchodmoser into Sy∣ria with an armie.) Nabuchodonosor 30. Euilmerodach 6. Neregasolarus 5. Na∣bonidus 17. This was a Mede by linage (not as some say, King of the Medes) and therefore called Darius Medus, depriued by Cyrus, who after that reigned nine yeares. From the beginning of Nabonassar, to the end of Cyrus, are 217. yeares. From thence to the Asiatike Empire of the Macedonians 201. From thence to the rebellion of Arsaces the Parthian, of whom the Parthian Kings were called Arsa∣cidae 79. And the Dynastie of the Parthians continued 479. yeares: the last of them Artabanus, being slaine. These Kings, and the times of their reignes are not easie to set downe, and Onuphrius is therefore reproued of Scaliger, for vnderta∣king this taske, in which Authoritie faileth him. Of them wee shall speake in due place. The The second Persian Dy∣nastie. second Persian Dynastie continued till the Mahumetans depriued them. The first, Artaxares reigned 12. yeares, Sapores 31.

Adeser 7. moneths, Barasas 6. moneths, Baram 7. moneths, Ormizda Iezdegird 3. in all 402. The Saracens succeeded, whose names and times you may see in our Lib. 3. cap. 1. Saraceni∣call relation. After the Saracens, reigned the Tartars; and since, sometime one fa∣mily, sometime another, among the Persians, till Solyman dispossessed the Sophian of the Babylonian dominion, vnder which Turkish feruitude it groned, till our daies, in which the present Persian hath recouered it. I dare not take vpon me to bee vmpire and decider of those many altercations a∣mong
Chronologers: but haue simply followed Scaliger, whose verie name is able to shield mee from contempt, if not to yeeld mee commendation. Let others, that haue more lust and leisure, trauerse these matters at their pleasure: my intent is, most of all, the Histories of Religions: and the successions and alterations of States I haue lightly touched: But precisely to determine in what yeare of the world eue∣ry King began his reigne, and to dispute the same with all opponents, would bee somewhat tedious to the Reader: to mee (perhappes) in these varieties of opi∣nions, impossible. Leauing therefore the more studious, to the Chronolo∣gers, let vs take a little reuiew of some principall occurrents in the former Cata∣logue. Africanus beginnes the Assyrian Monarchie at Belus, and not, as the most, with Ninus. That Belus some thinke to be the same with Nimrod, whom Ninus as wee said before, consecrated. Semiramis is Coeïus R lb. 13. cap. 29. reported to bee the first, that caused Eunuches to bee made. Ninias, which succeeded, left not like monuments of his great exploits, as his Predecessours before him. Buntingus thinkes him to bee that Amraphel King of Shinar, mentioned, Genes. 14. and that Arioch King of Elasser was his sonne. How euer, it breedes much difficultie, to reconcile the ancient hi∣storie of the Babylonian and Assyrian great and long continued Empire, with the kingdomes and Kings in that Chapter by Moses mentioned. Eupolemus, as before is cited out of Eusebius, saith that those Kings were Armenians; Diodorus Tarsensis, as Percrius affirmeth, reckons them Persians, Iosephus. Assyrians: Pererius himselfe thinkes them vassals, and tributaries to the Assyrian: Genebrara suspects the Histo∣rie of the Assyrian greatnesse: and truely, not altogether vniustly, as all the Histo∣rie of: Moses and Ioshua concerning the Kings in those parts, for ought can bee ga∣thered, yeelding no subiection to Babylon. And the Sodomite and his neighbours had beene the tributaries of Chedarlaomer King of Elam, and not of Amraphel King of Shinar: vnlesse we say that violent things are not permanent, and the yoake im∣posed before by the Assyrians, was now in Ninias daies reiected: Semiramis be∣ing weakened with her Indian expedition, and Ninias by killing her, giuing occa∣sion of discontent to her followers, the men of warre, which might hereupon (contemning this effeminate King, who had suffered his mother to possesse the Scepter so long) fall to sharing for themselues, and erect pettie kingdomes. Arius (happily) restored the Empire thus decayed, if it bee true that Buntingus writeth, that hee was a great warriour, therefore called Arius and Mars, and, as the God of warre, inuocated by the Assyrians. When Tentamos reigned, Diodor. Sic. lib. 3. cap. 7. Diodor. lib. 3. testisieth, that Priamus, then besieged by Agamemnon, as vassall and tributarie to the Assyrians, sent to him for aide, who sent to his succour Memnon, with 20000. souldiers. But to descend vnto times neerer both vs and the truth, and to view the ruine of that great estate: we reade in the same Author, and in Iustin. lib. 1. Orosius lib. 2. c. 2. others, that Arbaces (whom Iustin calleth Arbactus; Orosius, Arbastus) was by Sardanapalus made captaine of the armie which was yearely sent to Nina, or Niniue, where a conspiracie was contracted betweene him and Belesus a Chaldean Priest, Captaine of the Babylo∣nians, who by his Chaldean skill in diuination, had foretold Arbaces this desti∣ned Empire, and was promised, for his share, the Babylonian principalitie. Thus the Medes, Babylonians, and Arabians, enterprising rebellion, assembled to the num∣ber of 400000. whom Sardanapalus ouerthrew in battaile twice; but being still ani∣mated by Some thinke t s Belesus to bee Dinel, whom the Ba∣bylonian King called Bele∣sh zzar. Bi h ins Concent. Belesus predictions, which (said he) the Gods by the Starres fore-signi∣fied: and by corrupting of the Bactrian armie, sent to succour the King, and adioyning themselues to the enemie, they at the third battell ouerthrew the forces of Sardanapalus, led by Salamenus his wiues brother. The King fled into Niniue, trusting to a prophecie, That the Citie should neuer bee taken till the riuer were enemie to it. After two yeares siege, by extreame raines, the riuer swelling ouerflowed part of the Citie, and cast downe twentie furlongs of the
walls. Whereupon despairing (as seeming to see GOD and Man against him) he, which before had chambered himselfe with women, and accustomed himselfe to the Distaffe, in a womans both heart and habite: now in a manly resolution (if it may not more sitly be called a Feminine Dissolution, which thus runneth from that danger which it should encounter) gathered his treasures together, and erecting a frame in his Pallace, there burnt them, himselfe, his wiues, and eunuchs together. The Ashes, vnder pretence of a Vow thereof, made to Belus, Belesus obtained of Arbaces the new Conquerour and Monarch, to carrie to Babylon. But the cousi∣nage being knowne, and Belesus condemned for the treasures, which with the ashes he had conueyed, Arbaces both gaue it, and forgaue him; adding the praesecture of the Babylonians, according to promise. Phrygio. Carion. lib. 2. Some say that Belesus, whom they call Phul Beloch, shared the Empire with him, Arbaces reigning ouer the Medes and Persians, the other ouer Niniuie and Babylonia: following heerein the forged Metasthenes, who (as Annius maketh him to say) out of the Susian Librarie pen∣ned his Historie, hauing before fabled a Catalogue out of Berosus of the auncient Kings, contrary to that which out of the fragments of the true Berosus before is de∣liuered. Sardanapalus is written (saith Euseb, Chron. per Scalig. Scaliger in his Notes vpon Eusebius) with a dou∣ble ll. Sardanapallus, a name, sitting to his effeminate life. αλλὸς and φαλλὸς signifie the same, whence are those words of Cicero 3. De Repuh. Sardanapallus ille vitijs mul∣tò quàm nomine ipso deformior. Sardanapalus built Tarsus and Anchiale (saith Eusebtus) at the same time: the one famous for the most famous Diuine that euer the Sunne saw, (except the Sunne of Righteousnesse himselfe) Paul the Apostle and Doctor of the Gentiles: The other for the Authors Monument and stony Image, Strabo lib. 14. with this Assyrian Epigramme; Sardanapalus, the sonne of Anacyndar axis, built Anchiale and Tarsus in one day: and thou O stranger, Eate, drinke, play. And Verses were annexed, which I haue thus englished. Mortall, thou knowst thy selfe: then please thine appetite With present dainties: Death can yeeld thee no delight. Loe, I am now but dust: whilome a Prince of might. What I did eate, I haue; and what my greetly minde Consum'd: how much (alas) how sweet, left I behinde? Learne this, (O man) thus liue: best wisedome thou canst finde. This his Legacie hee hath bequeathed to all Epicures, the liuing Sepulchres of themselues, breathing graues (not of so many Creatures onely better than them∣selues, which they deuoure, but) of Reason, Nature, Religion, Soule, and (if it were possible) of GOD, which all lie buried in these swine, couered with the skinnes of Men. 1. Cor. 15.32. Let vs eate and drincke, for to morrow wee shall die. Who knoweth whe∣ther Paul did not allude to this speech of the Founder of his Citie? This subuersion of the Assyrian Empire was Anno mundt 3145. after Buntingus accompt. Of the Medes see more in their proper place. The Babylonian Empire renewed by Nabonassar, continued till Cyrus, of which times wee haue little record, but in the Scripture, as neyther of those Assyrian Kings, which before had captiued Israel, and inuaded Iuda. Senacherib is famous, euen in the Ethnike history, although they had not the full truth. For thus Herodotus Herod. lib. 2. telleth, That Sanacharib King of the Arabians and Assyrians warred on Aegypt, where Sethon (before, Vulcans Priest) then reigned: who, beeing forsaken of his souldiours, betooke him to his deuotion, amiddest the which hee fell asleepe. And the god appearing, promised aide which hee performed, sending an Armie of Mice into the Armie of Sanacharib, which did eate his Souldiours quiuers, and the leathers of their shieldes, and armour, in so much, that the very next day they
all fled. In witnesse whereof, the Image of the King, made of stone, standeth in the Temple of Vulcan, holding a mouse in his hand, vttering these words; He that loo∣keth on me, let him be religious. This History the Egyptians, in vanity and ambition, had thus peruerted and arrogated to themselues. Funcius and Osiander make Nabopollasar and Nabuchodonosor to be one and the same, and diuerse Commenters vpon Daniel hold the same opinion, whom Scali∣ger and Caluisius confute at large. Nabopollasar is supposed to begin his reigne An∣no mundi 3325. which he continued nine and twenty yeres: in his Sc.canon..3. seuenteenth yere Nebuchadnezzar (so the Masorites mis-call him, saith Scaliger) or Nabuchodonosor his sonne was sent by him, to subdue the rebellious Egyptians, Iewes, and Palestini∣ans: at which time he carried away Daniel into captiuitie. Berosus apud Iosephum contra App.libr.1. Caluisius. Hee beganne his reigne Anno mundi 3354, and in the yeare 3360. destrōyed Ierusalem. In the yeare 3386. Euilmerodach his sonne succeeded him, whom Neriglessoorus, (as Scaliger Animaduers. in Eusebium pag 85. affirmeth) slew, thereby to aduance his owne sonne the nephew of Nabuchodonosor, called La∣borosoarchadus, to the Scepter; which himselfe swayed as Protector in the minoritie of his sonne. But he being dead, & his sonne more fit for a Chamber then a Throne, Nabonidus conspired against him, and slew him. This Nabonidus, saith he, is Darius Medus, and Laborosoarchadus is that Baltasar mentioned by Daniel, after Scaligers interpretation of the Prophet out of Berosus and Megasthenes. It is a world to see how the Catholikes (so they call themselues) sweate in finding out that Nabuchodonosor mentioned in Iudith 1. Pintus would make it a common name to the Babylonian Kings, as Pharao to the Egyptians: Pererius will haue two of the name; others will haue him to be Cyrus; others, Cambyses, Artaxerxes, Ochus. Once, Babel is a mother of confusion to her children, and makes them babble, while they will canonise Apocrypha-scriptures. Cyrus ended the Babylonian monarchie, and hauing wonne Babylon, and taken Darius Medus at Borsippa, he gaue him his life, and the gouernement of Carmania. An. mundi 3409. As Nabuchodonosor had by Edict proclaimed the God of Daniel, so Cyrus ended the captiuity of his people; giuing liberty to such, as would, to returne. But many Iewes abode there still, and thence sent their yeerely offerings to the tem∣ple. In the time of Artabanus the Parthian (when Caligula tyrannized at Rome) Ioseph. Antiq. lib. 1S.ca.12. Asimaeus and Anilaens, brethren of the Iewish nation, grew mightie, and haughtie withall, forgetting God and themselues, which caused the Babylonians to conspire against thē, & (after the death of the brethren with thousands of their partakers) they slew in Seleucia fiftie thousand of the Iewish Nation. Neerda and Nisibis were then much peopled by the Iewes. And thus Religion partly held the ancient course, part∣ly was mixed (according to the custome of Conquests) with the Persian, Macedoni∣an, Parthian, besides the Iewish and Syrian, vntill the Apostles preached heere the Christian veritie. About the same time, Helena and her sonne Izates King of Adiabena (which is in these parts of Assyria) became Iewish Proselytes. Seleucia was built by Seleu∣cus Nicator on a channel dig∣ged out of Eu∣phrates into Tigris. Plin.lib.6.ca.26. Seleucia built by Seleucus (as it were the marriage-Chamber of Euphrates and Tigris, which there meete and mix their waters: Nature being by mans industry forced to yeeld to the match) as Plinie saith, for that purpose, emptied Babylon of her Inhabitants, and inherited her name also, with her people. It was from Babylon ninetie miles, or, as some reade it, for∣tie, inhabited with sixe hundred thousand citizens. To spoile the spoyler, the Par∣thians built Ctesiphon three miles from thence, and failing of their purpose, Volo∣gesus built another towne by, called Vologesocerta. Yet did Babylon it selfe remaine (but not it selfe) in the time of Ammianus Marcellinus, and after. Ortelius thinketh that Bagdat was called Babylon (as Seleucia before had beene) because it stood neere to the place where Babylon had stood. For that old Babylon in Pausanias Arcad. lib.8. Pausanias time, had nothing left standing but the Temple of Bel, and the walls; sometimes, saith he, the greatest Citie that euer the Sunne saw. In Ieromes time, Hieron in Es.13. within those walls were kept beasts for the Kings game. It was after inhabited with many thousands of Iewes, and was laid euen with the ground, as
Ios. Scaliger Scal. animad∣versan Euseb. pag.126. affirmeth, in the yeare, after the Iewish accompt, foure thousand se∣uen hundred ninetie and seuen, and after the Christian, one thousand thirtie and seuen. Maister Fox hath a little Act.&Mon. ex M.S. Caricus. lengthned the date and fate thereof, shewing that Almaricus King of Ierusalem rased and ruined it, and that it was neuer after inhabi∣ted. Before that time was Bagded built by Bugliafar as I.di Bar. As.dec.1. lib.1. Barrius calleth him, or after Scal.can.Isa.lib.2.& 3. Scaliger, Abugephar Elmantzur, who beganne to reigne in the one hundred thir∣tie and sixe, and died in the one hundred fiftie and eight yeare of their Hegeira. Sca∣liger and Lidyat Em. Tem. Lydyate agree of this place (which in their Emendations of Time disagree so eagerly) that it was Seleucia, or built in the place, & of the ruines thereof: an opini∣on not improbable, as theirs is altogether which thinke the present Bagded to be the old Babylon. The story of this Bagded or Baldach, and her Chalifs, ye may reade in Lib.3.ca.2. our Saracenicall Historie. Loys le Roy. libr.8. Knolls T.H.pag.113. M Polo Ven. Haiton Armen. Authors agree, that Haalon the Tartar sacked it, about the yeare one thousand two hundred and three score. Mustratzem being then Cha∣lipha, the foure and fiftieth, and last of those Saracenicall Popes. He found a misera∣ble death, where others with miserablenesse seeke a blessed life, being shut vp and starued amidst those Treasures, whereof he had store, which Niggardise forbade him to disburse in his owne defence. There is yet a bone left of this Calipha's carkasse; or some ghost and shadow of that great and mighty body, I meane that ancient name and power of the Calipha's, which, magnificent Solyman the Turkish Emperour in his conquest 1534. would seeme to acknowledge, in accepting the royall ensignes of that new conquered state at the hands of their Calipha: a ceremony which the Soldans in Egypt and Persia v∣sed, more for forme them necessitie; this Assyrian and that Egyptian Caliph hauing but gesture and vesture, the Souldans themselues enioying both body and soule of this authority. In the yeare one thousand one hundred fiftie nine, the riuer Tigris ouerflowed Bagded, and desolated many Cities. Barrius Decad.As.li.2. affirmeth out of the Arabian and Per∣sian Tarigh, which he saith hee had seene, that Bagded was built by the counsell of an Astrologer, a Gentile named Nobach, and hath for ascendent Sagittarius, was finished in foure yeares, and cost eighteene millions of gold. These studies of Astro∣logie did there flourish. One Richardus Rich.contra Alcoran.ca.13. a Frier Preacher saith, That here was an V∣niuersitie, the Students whereof were maintained at publike charge, of which num∣ber himselfe was one. That Caliph, that founded it, for the preuenting of Sects, ba∣nished Philosophie out of these Schooles, and accounted him a bad Saracen which was a good Philosopher. The reason whereof grew from some, which, reading A∣ristotle and Plato, relinquished Mahomet. M.Po.lib.t, ca. 7. Marco Polo or Paulus the Venetian saith, that they studied here in his time, the Law of Mahomet, Necromancie, Geomancie, Physiognomy, Physicke, and Astro∣nomie: And that it was then a great Staple of the Indian Commodities. This was within few yeares after the Tartar had wonne it. Hee addeth that there were many Christians in these parts: and that in the yeare one thousand two hundred twentie and fiue, in derision of the Gospel, the Chaliph commanding by a day, that the Chri∣stians should remoue a mountaine in testimony of their faith, according to the words of CHRIST, or else to abide the perill; this was effected by a Shoomaker, and the day in remembrance thereof yeerely solemnized with fasting the Euen. The Iewes goe still to visite the Denne which is there shewed, as the place of 'Da∣niels imprisonment, with his terrible Gaolers or fellow-prisoners, as Maister Allen tolde me. A certaine Merchant, (the Discourse of whose voyage Cap. 8. Ramusius hath published) speaketh of Orpha, a towne in the way from Byr to Babylon, wherein the people foolishly suppose, that Abraham offered Isaac: at which time (say they) there sprang a fountaine which watereth their Countrey, and driueth their milles. Here was a Christian Temple called Saint Abraham, after turned into a Mahumetane Moschee, and now called Abrahams well, into which if any enter so many times
(they haue a set number) with deuotion, he is freed of anie feuer: The fishes which are many, haue taken Sanctuarie in these waters, and none dare take them, but hold them holie. Six miles from hence is a Well, holden in like sacred account, which cureth Leprosies. Nisibis, Carrae, and Vlater.ls.11. Edessa, were chiefe Cities of Mesopotamia: at Edessa reigned Ab igarus, betwixt whom and our Sauiour passed (if we may be∣leeue it) those Epistles yet extant. At Carrhae Alex.ab Alex∣and.gen.dier.lib. 4.cap.8. there was a Temple of the Moone, in which, they which sacrificed to the goddesse Luna, were subiect to the gouernement of their wiues: they which sa∣crificed to the god Lunus, were accounted their wiues Maisters. Hee saith, that the Babylonians allowed marriages of parents and children. Lib.2.cap.24 Cafe is two dayes iourny from Bagdet, Cartweight. religious for the buriall of Hali and his sonnes, Hassan and Ossain: whereunto is resort of Pilgrims from Persia, whose kings were wont here to be crow∣ned. But this city Curio Curio Sar. Eist.lib.1. calleth Cusa, assigneth it to Arabia, & saith that of this acci∣dent it was called Massadale, or the house of Ali, slain here by Muaui his cópetitor. Mesopotamia is now called Diarbeth. Maginus. The chiefe Cities in it are Orfa, of seuen miles compasse, famous, say some, for the death of Crassus. Assyrias Latio maculauit lan∣guine Cari as: saith Lucan. Caramit the mother-ci∣tie of the Countrey, of twelue miles compasse: Mosul and Merdin, of which in the next Chapter. Betweene Orpha and Caramit, was the Paradise of Aladeules, where he had a fortresse destroyed by Selim. Cartwright. This his Paradise was like to that which you shall finde in our Persian Historie. Men, by a potion brought into a sleepe, were brought into this supposed Paradise, where at their waking, they were presented with all sensuall pleasures of musicke, damosells, dainties, &c. which (hauing had some taste of an other sleepie drinke) after came againe to themselues. And then did Aladeules tell them, That he could bring whom he pleased to Paradise, the place where they had bin: And if they would commit such murders, or haughty attempts, it should be theirs. A dangerous deuise. Zelim the Turke destroyed the place. CHAP. XIIII. Of Niniue and other neighbouring Nations. WE haue hitherto spoken of Babylonia, but so, as in regard of the Em∣pire, and some other occurrents, Necessitie now and then compel∣led vs to make excursions into some other parts of Assyria, Mesopo∣tamia, &c. And I know not how, this Babylon causeth confusion in that Sea of affaires, and in regard of the diuision of the Pennes (as sometimes of Tongues) of such as haue written thereof. Hard it is to distinguish betweene the Assyrian and Babylonian Empire, one while vnited, an other while diuided, as each party could most preuaile: and no lesse hard to reconcile the Ethnike and Diuine Historie touching the same. Ptolomey Libr.6.cap.I. straitneth Assyria, on the north, with part of Armenia neere the riuer Niphates; on the west with Mesopotamia; on the south with Susiana; and Media on the east. But her large Empire hath enlarged the name of Syria, and of Assyria (which names the Greeks did not well distinguish) to many Countries in that part of Asia. The Scripture deriueth Syria from Aram, and Assyria from Ashur. Both were in their times flourishing, and mention is made from Abrahams time, both of the warres and kingdomes in those parts: yea before, from Ashur and Nimrod, as alreadie is shewed. Mesopotamia is so called, and in the Scripture Aram or Syria of the waters, be∣cause it is situate betweene Euphrates and Tigris: the Countries Babylonia, and Armenia, confining the same on the North and South. Whereas therefore wee haue in our former Babylonian relation discoursed of Assyria, extending the name after a larger reckoning: here we consider it more properly. The chiefe Citie thereof was Niniue, called in Ionas, Ion  3.3. A great and excellent Citie of three days iourny. It had (I borrow the words of our reuerend Diocesan) Doctor King on Ionas Lect.2. an an∣cient testimony long before in the Booke of Genes. 10.11. Genesis. For thus Moses writeth, That
Ashur came from the land of Shinar, and built Niniueh and Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resin. At length he singleth out Niniue from the rest, and setteth a speciall marke of preheminence vpon it, This is a great Citie: Which honour, by the iudgement of the most learned (though standing in the last place) belongeth to the first of the foure Cities, namely to Niniue. Others Annius vpon Eeros. imagined (but their coniecture is without ground) that the foure Cities were closed vp within the same walls, and made but one, of an vnusuall bignesse. Some ascribe the building of Niniue to Ninus the sonne of Belus: of whome it tooke the name, to be called either Ninus, as wee read in 'Pliny; or after the manner of the Hebrewes, Niniue: and after a few words; By the confession of all, both facred and Gentile Histories, the Citie was very spacious, hauing foure hundred and fourescore furlongs in circuit, when Babylon had fewer almost (as some report) by an hundred: and as afterwards it grew in wealth and magnificence, so (they write) it was much more enlarged. Raphael Volaterranus affirmeth, That it was eight yeares in building; and not by fewer at once then tenne thousand workemen. There was no Citie since, by the estimation of Diodorus Siculus, that had like compasse of ground, or statelinesse of walls: the height whereof was not lesse then an hundred foot; the breadth sufficiently capable to haue receiued three Carts on a rowe: and they were furnished and ador∣ned besides with fifteene hundred Turrets. Thus farre our reuerend and learned Bishop. Diodorus Diod, Sic. i. 3. c. 1. telleth out of Ctesias. That Ninus, after he had subdued the Aegyp∣tians, Phoenicians, Syrians, Cilicians, Phrygians, and others, as farre as Tanais, and the Hyrcanians, Parthians, Persians, and other their neighbours, hee built this Citie. After that, he led an Armie against the Bactrians of seuenteene hun∣dred thousand footmen, and two hundred thousand horse: in which Expedition he tooke Semiramis from her husband Menon, who therefore (impatient of loue and griefe) hanged himselfe. He had by her a sonne of his owne name, and then di∣ed, leauing the Empire to his wife. His Sepulchre was nine furlongs in height (each of which is sixe hundred feet) and tenne in breadth. The credit of this Histo∣rie I leaue to the Author, scarse seeming to agree with Moses narration of the buil∣ding of Niniue, any more then Semiramis building of Babylon. Some write, That Aelian. vat. bist. l. 7. c. 1. Semiramis abusing her husbands loue, obtained of him the swaying of the Empire for the space of fiue dayes; in which time she depriued him of his life, and succeeded in his Estate. But least the name of this Citie call vs backe againe too much to those Assy∣rian Relations, before dilated as much as concerneth our purpose; let vs see what can be said of their Religion here. Of this we finde little, but as before is shewed of the Babylonians. Nisroch was the Idoll, in whose Temple Senacherib was slaine by his owne sonnes. But what this Nisroch was, I cannot finde. Certaine it is, that hee which had vpbraided confidence in the true GOD, findes his Idoll, euen in the place and time of his Worship, his Traytor; and hee which had blasphemed the GOD of Heauen, findes Heauen and Earth, and his owne bowels, against him. Uenus Vrania Wolpb. in 2. Reg. 19. is reckoned among the Assyrian deuotions, and Adad was their chiefe God, which they interprete One, (and Macrobius, the Sunne, which, as before is said, they worshipped) and Atargatis, the Earth. Belus also was here wor∣shipped, as witnesse Dion, Eusebius and Cyrillus. Lucian Luc. in lone Tragoedo. sayth, That the Assyrians sacrificed to a Doue; the touching of which Fowle required much ceremonie for expiation: Whereto accordeth the fable, Metam. 4. that Semiramis was turned into a Doue. Concerning Adad and Atargatis, Macrobius Saturnal. l. 1. 23. sayth, That the Assyrians ascribe all power to these two. The Image of Adad shined with rayes or beames downewards,
designing the Sunnes force: That of Atargatis, with beames vpwards, as it were as∣cribing to the heauenly influence all her plentie: vnder the same Image were the shapes of Lyons, as also the Phrygians fained the mother of the Gods, that is, the Earth, to be borne on Lyons. But of this Atargatis more in the next Chapter. Ionas was sent to preach to the great Citie of Niniue, as some Gramay. As. Sigon. in Sulpit. thinke in the dayes of Sardanapalus his next predecessor. Broughton (with some other) thinketh in the daies of Pul, or Phul-Assur. Their repentance stayed that iudgement. Nahum after denoun∣ced the like iudgement, which accordingly came to passe. Phraortes King of the Medes (mentioned in the former Chapter) besieged it. His sonne Cyaxares succeeded in the Kingdome, and in this siege. After that, the Scythians inuaded Media, and held it eight and twentie yeares, according to the prophecie of Ieremie, 49. 34. and in the same Expedition obtained Niniue. But Cyaxares after preuailed against the Scythi∣ans, and Astyages his sonne ouer-turned and destroyed Niniue, that it should no more be a receptacle or encouragement to the Assyrians, to rebell against the Medes. Nahum threatneth Nab. 2. 6. opening of the gates of the Riuers, and destruction to the Temple, as Tremellins readeth it, noting thereon the casting downe of the Forts on Tigris, and amongst them the Temple of Belus there erected; out of whose notes on the first Chapter of Nahum, I inserted the former relation. Herodotus in the Historie hereof sayth, That Phraeortes there perished in the siege, with most part of his armie. Cyaxares, to reuenge his fathers death, renewed the siege, but was not able to hold his owne a∣gainst the Scythians, vntill, after eight and twentie yeares, that the Scythians had en∣ioyed the Empire of Asia (vnder pretence of feasting being entertained in a ban∣quet) the most of them, in their drunkennesse, were slaine by the Medes: and so the Scythians loosing what before they had gotten, Cyaxares recouered the Em∣pire, and destroyed Niniue. Thus was that Citie destroyed arothaeus in his Synopsi af∣firmeth, that by an Earth∣quake the lake which compas∣sed the Citie drowned it, and  fire con∣sumed the vp∣per part there∣of. whose Riches, Beau∣tie, Antiquitie, Largenesse, and Puissance, the Scripture so often mentioneth. A man may compare Ecbatana of the Medes, Babylon on Euphrates, and Niniue on Tigris, to the Triumviri at Rome: So did they both emulate and share the Ea∣sterne Empire, as each could make her selfe strongest; now Babylon, another while Niniue, and sometime Ecbatana preuailing: which is the cause of no small difficul∣tie in these Histories, M. Cartwright, an eye-witnesse, hath beheld (he sayth) the ruines of this Citie, and agreeth with Diodorus in the inequalitie of the sides: two of which contained an hundred and fiftie furlongs, the two other but fourescore and tenne on a side. Mosul is supposed to be Niniue, happily for the neerenesse, or for that (as a post∣hume issue) it hath sprung from the former. The ashes yet haue not yeelded such a Phoenix as the former was. G. Bo. Ben. part. 1. lib. 2. Mosul is in fame for Cloth of Gold and Silke, for ferti∣litie, and for the Patriarchall Sea of the Nestorian Christians, whose authoritie stret∣cheth to Cathay and India. Merdin, a Towne on the same Riuer, is also a Patriarchall Sea of the Chaldees (or Mahumetane Sect.) In Paulus Venetus his daies M. Paul. l. 1. c. 6. they were in the Prouince of Mosul, partly Mahumetans, partly Christians: and in the Moun∣taines dwelt the Curdi, that were Participles or Mungrels in Religion, professing partly Christ, partly Mahumet in practise robbers and wicked. The Christian Pa∣triarch hath Archbishops and Bishops vnder him, as the Roman Pope. The Mahume∣tans are called Aratri. Assyria (sayth Magin. Geogr. Maginus) is now called by Niger, Adrinsa; by Garara, Azemia; by Pinetus, Mosul; by Mercator, Sarh; and of Castaldus, Arzerum. It sometime contai∣ned the Prouinces, Arapachite, Adiabena, and Sittacene, now called (after some) Bo∣tan, Sarca, and Rabia. Boemus l. Boem. l. 1. telleth of a strange fashion aunciently vsed in Assyria; That the maids which were marriageble were yearely brought forth in publike, and set to sale to such as would marrie them. The money which was giuen for the fairest, was giuen to the more deformed for their portion in marriage.
The Assyrians vsed to wash themselues daily, but chiefely after carnall com∣panie. As for the Saracenicall Religion, we shall more fitly handle the same by it selfe, then tediously repeat the same things. For this therefore, and other Countries subiect to Turkish or Persian seruitude, the Reader may reade of their superstitions in their due place, when we speake of the Saracens, Turkes, and Persians. The relation of their Christian Rites belong to another Tome. But let vs come out of Assyria into Syria; the Histories of which are not a little, as is said, confounded together, and many Rites were common to them both, and to all these parts, from the Persian gulfe to Asia the lesse, as being so often subiect to one Empire, or rather still parts of that one Empire, which receiued often alterati∣ons vnder the Assyrians, Babylonians, Medes, Persians, Macedonians, Scythians, Parthians, &c. CHAP. XV. Of Syria, and the ancient Religions there: of the Syrian Goddesse; and her Rites at Hierapolis: Of the Daphnean, and other Syrian superstitions. SYRIA is called, in Scripture, Aram, of Aram the sonne of Shem, Gen. 10. 22. as before is said. And Strabo (lib. 1.) calleth the Syrians Arammaei. Hence also his Arinsi are deriued and Arami (lib. 13.) It is diuersly bounded by diuers Authors: some confounding the names of Syria and Assyria. Eustathius doth reckon these fiue parts thereof, viz. Commagena, Seleucide, Coelesyria, Phoenicia, and Iudaea. Mela extendeth it further, lib. 1. and Pliny, lib. 5. cap. 12. nameth, as part of Syria, Palaesti∣na, Iudaea, Coele, Phoenice, Damascena, Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Sophene, Com∣magene, Adiabene, Antiochia. And in this large sense doth G. Post. Bar. Syr. descrip. Broc. descrip. Ter. san. Postellius and Brocardus stretch it beyond Tigris Eastward from the Mediterranean sea, and from Armenia to Arabia. But Dom. Niger, and before him Lib. 5. c. 15. Ptolomey (whome wee especially follow) make it abutte on the North vpon Cilicia, and part of Cappadocia, by the Mount A∣manus; on the South, vpon Iudaea, and part of Arabia Petraea; on the East, vpon Ara∣bia Deserta and Euphrates; on the West, vpon the Syrian sea. This Countrey is thought to haue beene the habitation of our first parents, be∣fore the Floud, and of Noah and his sincerer familie (as wee haue said) after. Yet how soone, and how much, they degenerated in the wicked off-spring of cur∣sed Cham whose posteritie peopled a great part hereof, till they were thence by the Israelites expelled, the Scripture is sufficient record. Yea, euen from Noahs time did they deriue their Idolatrie, as appeareth by Lucian. de D a Syria. Lucians narration of the Sy∣rian Goddesse, which he partly saw with his eyes, and partly receiued of the Priests report. This Goddesse was with godlesse Rites serued and obserued at Hierapolis; which, although Strabo Lib. 16. placeth it beyond the Riuer in Mesopotamia, is by Pliny Lib. 5. c. 23. ac∣counted in Coelesyria, called also Bambyce, and, of the Syrians themselues, Ma∣gog; and by Ptolomey named among the Syrian Cities of the diuision Cirristica, in 71. 15. Longit. and 56. 15. Latit. And Lucian (who himselfe was there; for Gilh Cognat. in Annot. hee calleth himselfe an Assyrian, and was borne at Samosata in Commagena) placeth it on this side the Riuer. Plinie and Strabo (deceiued in the name) mention the worship of Atargatis (called of the Greekes Derceto) in this place: but Lucian (other-where a scoffer, here an Historian) at large describeth it, making this diffe∣rence betweene This and That, that Atargetis was halfe a fish, but the Syrian God∣desse wholly resembled a woman.
The Citie he thinketh to haue receiued the name Hierapolis (Holy Citie) of these holy things here obserued; in which respect in giueth place to none other place in Sy∣ria: hauing a stately Temple, enriched with gifts, Statues, and (as they esteemed them) Miracles. Arabia, Phoenicia, Babylonia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Assyria brought her Presents, and celebrated her solemne-Feasts. This Temple was (in the Syrians opinion) first founded by Deucalion, whose Hi∣storie you would thinke Lucian had learned of the Hebrewes, not of the Syrians, or Greekes; so liuely doth he expresse the infidelitie and crueltie of the old World; the manner of the Floud; the Arke wherein, with himselfe, his wife, and children, he sa∣ued also all other creatures that liued on the earth, which came to him by couples, by dispensation of Iupiter. Hereunto these Hierapolitans adde, That in their Territorie was made a great Clift, which swallowed vp those waters: which Clift (but then ve∣rie little) was shewed to our Author: to whome also they reported, That, in memorie hereof, Deucalion instituted that Rite, which to his time continued; that twice euery yeare, not the Priests onely, but many out of all Syria, Arabia, and beyond Euphra∣tes, went to the Sea, and from thence brought water, which they poured downe in the Temple which he had built ouer that Clift vnto Iuno; all which water was receiued into the same. Some ascribe the building of this Temple to Semiramis, in honour of her mother Derceto: others to Attes, for the worship of Rhea: which Attes was a Lydian, and was author of the superstitions of Rhea, to the Phrygians, Lydians, and Samothraci∣ans: but the opinion most probable was, that Dionysius or Bacchus was founder of it; two substantiall witnesses, besides others, affirming the same, namely two Phalli, or Priapi (huge Images of the priuie part of a man) erected at the entrie of the Temple, with an inscription, That Bacchus had consecrated them to Iuno. That auncient foundation being consumed by time, this later Temple was erected by Queene Stra∣tonice, who being in a dreame enioyned this office of Iuno, and, for neglecting the same, punished with sicknesse, vowed vpon her recouerie to performe it. The King ioyned in Commission with her, as Generall of his Armie, and ouerseer of these holy workes, a beautifull young man, named Combabus: who fearing what might happen, gelded himselfe, and closing those his dismembred members (first for their preserua∣tion embalmed) in a boxe sealed, as some great treasure, he committed to the Kings fidelitie, to be safely reserued to his vse. Which his practise saued his life accordingly, being after produced to cleare him of adulterie with Stratonice, which had been layd to his charge by his enuious accusers, and by the iealous King greedily apprehended. In memorie whereof, a brazen Statue of Combabus was set vp in this Temple, and both then (whether to solace Combabus, or by inspiration of Iuno) and yearely euer after, many in this Temple gelded themselues, and put off together the nature and habit of men, attyring themselues like women. These Man-women Priests were cal∣led Galli. The Temple was built in the middest of the Citie, compassed with a double wall; the Porch looking Northwards, almost an hundred fadome high; where stood those Priapi aforesaid, about the height of three hundred fadome: vp to one of these one ascendeth twice a yeare, and abideth in the top thereof seuen dayes. He carrieth with him a long chayne, which he letteth downe, and thereby draweth vp to him such things as he needeth. Many offer Gold, and Siluer, and Brasse, and one appointed re∣ceiueth their names, which he sheweth to him aboue, and he maketh his prayers for euery of them, sounding, while hee prayeth, a little Bell. The Temple within shi∣neth with gold, and the Roofe is wholly of this Mettall; it yeeldeth so fragrant a smell, that the Garments of those, which come thither, retame this sent long after. There is also another inner Roome or Quire, whereinto the chiefe of the Priests onely haue entrance; yet is it open without any dore. In this Sanctuarie are the Images of the Gods; Iupiter, supported with Bulls, but Iuno sitteth vpon Lyons, hol∣ding
in one hand a Scepter, and in the other a Distasfe, in some thing or other resem∣bling diuers other Goddesses, by the Aegyptians, Indians, Armenians, Babylonians, Aethiopians, and Medes, adorned with many Iewels: and among the rest she hath on her head a stone called the lampe, of the effect, yeelding light in the night season, as if all the Temple were hanged with Lampes. This statue goeth twice a yeere to the sea, for the water before mentioned: neither of the Syrians is called by any name, but onely the Image, not expressing of whom. In the temple is the image of Apollo cloathed, with a beard, (contrarie to the custome of the Greekes, and in a farre more glorious manner) giuing forth Oracles: for it moueth it selfe, which, the Priests espying, lift it vp alost (otherwise it sweateth and moueth it selfe forward neuerthelesse) and being thus supported, it turneth it selfe and them about, and leapeth from one place to another. Then doth the chiefe of the Priests, make supplication and request for all things: which if it misliketh, it goeth backwards; if it approueth, it carrieth them forwards: and without these Oracles they enterprise nothing neither priuate nor sacred: and Lucian saith hee saw it leauing the Priests (the supporters) and mouing it selfe aboue in the ayre. Here are also the statues of Atlas, Mercury, and Lucina, and without, a great brasen Altar, and many brasen images of Kings and Priests, and many others recorded in poets and histories. Among others standeth the image of Semyramis pointing to the temple with her fin∣ger, which (they say) is the signe of her repentance, who hauing giuen commaunde∣ment to the Syrians, to worship no other God but her selfe, was by plagues (sent from heauen) driuen to reuoke that former edict, and thus seemeth to acknowledge and point out another Deitie. There were also places inclosed, wherein were kept and fed; sacred Oxen, horses, Eagles, Beares, Lyons. The Priests were in number aboue 300. some for killing sacrifices: some for offe∣rings: some ministring fire to others at the altar: their garment all white: their head couered: and euery yeare was chosen a new High-priest, which alone was cloathed with purple, and a golden head-tire. A great multitude there was besides of Musici∣ans, Galli, and Propheticall women: they sacrificed twice a day, whereat they all as∣sembled. To Iupiter they vse neither song, nor instrument, in sacrifice: as they doe to Iuno. Not farre hence was a lake of 200. fadome depth, wherein were preserued sacred fishes, and in the middest thereof an altar of stone, crowned alwaies with garlands, and burning with odours. They haue a great feast which they call the going downe to the lake, when all their idols descend thither. Their greatest and most solemne feast was obserued in the spring, which they cal∣led the fire: which they solemnifed in this sort. They felled great trees, and laide them in the Churchyard (as we may terme it) and bringing thither goates, sheepe, and o∣ther beasts, they hanged them on these trees; & together with them, foules, and gar∣ments, and workes of golde and siluer, which being set in due order, they carry the images of the gods about the trees, and then set all on fire. They resort to this feast out of Syria, and the coasts adioining, & bring hither their idols with them: and great multitudes resorting to the sacrifices, the Galli, and those other sacred wights beat and wound each other. Others play on instruments, and others, rauished by diuine furie, prophecie: and then doe the Galli enter into their orders: for the furie rauisheth ma∣ny of the beholders. Whatsoeuer yong man commeth prepared to this purpose, hur∣ling off his garments, with a great voice he goeth into the middest, and drawing his sword geldeth himselfe; and runneth through the Citie, carrying in his hands, that which he would no longer carry on his bodie. And into whatsoeuer house he casteth the same, he receiueth from thence his womanish habite and attire. When any of them die, his fellowes carrying him into the Suburbes, couer him and his horse with stones, and may not enter into the Temple in 7. daies after: nor after the fight of any o∣ther carkasse in one day, but none of that family where one hath died, in 30. dayes: and then also with a shauen head. Swine they hold for vncleane beasts. And the Doue they esteeme so sacred, that if one touch one against his will, he is that day vncleane.
This causeth Doues in those parts to multiply exceedingly: neither doe they touch fishes: This because of Derceto, halfe a woman, halfe a fish: that, for Semiramis vvhich vvas metamorphosed into a Doue. Euseb de praep. l. 8. c. 5. Many are the ceremonies also to be performed of the religious Pilgrims, or Vo∣taries that visite this holy Citie: for before hee setteth forth, hee cuts off the hayre of his head and browes, hee sacrificeth a sheepe, and spreading the fleece on the ground, hee kneeleth downe on it, and layeth vpon his head the head and feete of the beast, and prayeth to be accepted: the rest he spendeth in the banquet. Then doth hee crowne himselfe, and his fellow pilgrims, and after sets forward on his pilgrimage, vsing for his drinke and washing colde vvater, and sleepeth alway on the ground till his returne home. In this Citie vvere appoin∣ted publique Hostes, for diuers Cities diuers, called Doctors, because they ex∣pounded these mysteries: They haue also one manner of sacrificing, to hurle downe the beastes destinied herevnto, from the toppe of the porch, which die of the fall. They haue a like rite to put their Children in a Sacke, and carry them downe, branded first on the necke or palme of the hand: and hence it was that all the Assyrians were branded. The young men also consecrated their hayre from their Natiuitie, vvhich being cut in the Temple, vvas there preserued in some boxe of golde or siluer, with the inscription of the owners name thereon. And this did I (saith Lucian) in my youth: and my hayre and name remaine in the Temple still. Of Atergatis see more in the chapter of Phoenicca. Suetonius tels of Nero, that hee contemned all Religions but this of the Sy∣rian Goddesse: of vvhich also hee grewe weary, and defiled her with Vrine. After which he obserued a little Needle, supposed to haue a power of fore-signifying dan∣ger: and because soone after he had it, hee found out a conspiracie intended against him, he sacrificed thereto three times a day. Plutarch De conso' at. ad Ap. calleth the Syriane an effeminate Nation prone to teares: and saith, that some of them after the death of their friends haue hidden themselues in Caues, from the sight of the sunne many dayes. Rimmon the idoll of the Syrians, and his temple is mentioned, 2 King. 5. 18. But I haue litle certainty to say of him. Antiochia built by Selencus, (to whom, in honour of his memorie, in mount Cassius they obserued sacred solemnities, as to a demigod) sometimes the seate royall of the Syrian Kings, third Citie of the Roman Empire, third seate of the Chri∣stian Patriarches, and first, where that melodious name of Christian was heard: is now the Sepulchre (saith Boterus) of it selfe, or, (as Niger) a greater wildernesse, vvherein it selfe is least part of it selfe, beeing left but a small Village (saith Cartwright. ano∣ther) in the middest of it's owne walles. About fiue miles from Antiochia, was that faire and sacred Daphne, vvhich Ortelius in his Theater hath presented to the spectators, with a peculiar descripti∣on, and of vvhich the elder Authors Szomen. l. 5 18. Niceph. l. 10. c. 18. Euogr. l. 1. c. 16. Strab. l. 16. haue plentifully written. It was 10. miles about: a place euery way enuironed vvith many stately Cypresses, besides other trees, which suffered not the Sunne to kisse their mother (Earth:) vvhose lappe was according to the diuersitie of the season replenished with varietie of flowers, her breastes flowing with streames of watery nourishment. A spring there was, de∣riuing (as men supposed) her water from the Castalian Fountaines, to which aunci∣ent superstition (and therefore superstitious Antiquitie) attributed a diuining faculty with like name and force to that at Delphos. This also was furthered by the Legend of Daphne, Ov. Metam. l. 1 recorded by the Poets, beleeued (and what will not Superstition beleeue, but the truth?) by the credulous multitude: who was said to haue fled from Apollo, and here turned into a tree. But thus could not Apollo bee turned from his loue, which hee continued both to the Tree and place. This was Lettice sutable to the lips of vaine youth. Ter. in Euni∣cho. Et quia confimilem luserat (saith amorous Chaerea of Iupiter in the Comicke)
I am olim ille ludum, impendio magis, Animus gandebat mihi, &c. Ego homincio non sacerem? There needed no other lecture of sensualitie to them, then this Legend, especially in this schoole, where euery place might be a place of argument (vnder presence of reason and religion) to shut true Religion, and reason out of the place, especially with schol∣lers greedy of this conclusion. Here you might haue heard the whisking windes in a murmuring accent breathing this lustfull Oratorie: the Enamelled floore did offer her more then officious courtesie, (a soft, sweet, and inlayed bed) to lie in; the ayre with Temperature, seemed to further Intemperance: The eye of the Day, & watchmen of the Night, were prohibited by the Cypresse roose, with their vnwelcome light, to restifie those workes of darknes, which those guilty boughes couered from discouering: Once, the concurring obiects of each sense, did in silence speake and perswade to sensuall pleasure, insomuch that by a gene∣rall Decree, Temperance and Temperate men were hence exiled, and scarse would the vulgar allow him the name of a man, which here would not bee transformed into a beast, or would presume, without a Curtesan, to tread on this holy ground. Needs must they goe whom the diuell driueth: such God, such religion. Here were erected sump∣tuous buildings: the temple of Apollo Daphnaus, with a stately Image therin; the worke (as was thought) of Seleucus: also Dianas chappel & sanctuarie. Iulius Capitolinus wri∣teth that Verus a voluptuous Emperour spent his summers here, and wintered in An∣tioch. Seuerus (more truely answering his name) did to death certaine Tribunes (saith Lampridius) by whose negligence the Souldiors here were suffered to ryot. The Ora∣cles added renowne to the place, which were deluered out of these Daphnaean waters by a certaine winde or breath. Hadrian the Emperor is reported to haue hence recei∣ued the faculty of Diuining, by dipping a Cypresse lease in the Fountaine. Iulian re∣sorted hither often for that purpose. But his elder brother Gaellus, whom Constantius had called to be Casar, & after (saith Ammianus) for his outrages executed, had in the time of his abode at Antioch, remoued the bones of Babylas their Bishop & other ho∣ly Martyrs his companions in suffering, to this place, where also he built a church. Now when as Iulian in his Persian expedition had sent others to visite all the other Oracks in the Romane Empire, himselfe here consulted with Apollo, (an Apostata Emperour with an Apostata Angell) about the successe of those warres. But all his sacrifices ob∣tained no other answere, then that he could not answere, by the countermaund of a more diuine power there liuing in those dead bones. Herevpon Iulian commanded the Christians to remoue those ill neighbours: which they did (saith Theodoret,) with a so∣lemne procession, singing the Psalmes, & dancing with the heart of Danid; making this the burthen, and foote of each verse, Confounded be all they that worship grauen images: where with Iulian, enraged, persecuted the Christians. Euagrius affirmeth, that he built a temple in honour of Babylas: how truely, I know not. But the True GOD confounded both the Idol & Idolater, shortly after, calling the one to giue account of his-ill emploi∣ed stewardship; vncertaine whether by diuine or humane hand: and for the other, his temple was consumed with fire from aboue, together with the Image, one pillar wher∣of remained in Chrysostomes dayes. The Pagans attributed this fire to the Christians: and no maruell: for what did not that fire of blind Idolatry (kindled with Zeale) attri∣bute to the innocent Christians? herein testifying that it came from hell, & must to Hel againe, by that hellish Character and impression, of so great fire, and as great Darknesse. Such is Hell, & such is ignorant Zeale: a fire but no light. Apollos priest by no torments could be forced to contesse any authour thereof: & the officers of the temple affirmed it was fire from heauen, which certaine country people confirmed by their owne sight. Iulian to satisfie his rage caused some temples of the Christians to be burned. Nicopho∣rus Nic.l.16.23, & 17.14. telleth of the continuance of this Daphnaean groue, honoured with Buildings and spectacles, by Mammianus and Chosroes. Apollo's image was made of wood, couered ouer with gold. Theodosius forbade the cutting of any of those Cypresses. Orontes is a riuer which ariseth in Coelesyria, and payeth Tribute to all the three
Brethren: it visiteth Pluto's pallace, running with a long tract vnder the Earth, and then heauing vp his head, maketh his gladsome homage to Iupiter; and after his cu∣stomes paied to the Antiochians, in fine poureth himselfe into the lappe of Neptune, entring the Sea neere to Seleucia. Strab.l.16. It was called Typhon, vntill Orontes, building a bridge ouer it, caused it to be called by his name. They had heere a tale of Typhen a huge Dragon, which diuided the earth, as he went seeking to hide himselfe, and pe∣rished by the stroke of a thunderbolt. Thus did he indent a passage for this riuer. Not farre hence was a sacred Caue called Nymphoeum: also Mount Casius, and An∣ticasius, and Heraclia,: and nigh thereto the temple of Minerus. In Laodicea was this Goddesse honoured, to whome they offered Eus de lau∣dib.constantini. in yearely sacrifice in olde time a maide, after that in steede thereof a hart. I may here mention also that, which Tacitus Tacit.l.2.bist. reporteth of the Mount Carmel (as he placeth it,) betwixt Iudea and Syria, where they worshipped a God of that name with Ethnicke rites. They had not any Temple or Statue to this God, an Altar onely and Reuerence was here seene: Vespasian did in this place offer sacrifice, where Basi∣lides the Priest viewing the entrals, foretold him of his good successe. Laodicea, a citie of Syria, vsed this sacred butchery once a yeere, to offer a maiden in sacrifice: as testi∣fieth Euseb.de praep. Euang.l.4.c.8. CHAP. XVI. Of the Syrian kings, and alteration in Gouernment, and Religion, in those countries. SYria quickly grew into peoples and kingdomes, although Time hath long since deuoured both them and their memories. Of Menon the husband of Semiramis (mentioned by Diodorus) is spoken before. A∣dadezer was in Dauids time, king of Aram Zoba, which some take for Chobal in Syria, some for Sophene in Armenia, and some for the Nu∣bei: whatsoeuer they were, Dauid made them tributarie Anno mundi. 2903. Benhadad, Hazael, and others the scripture also mentioneth: but certaine suc∣cession we finde not recorded of these Syrian kings, til the time of Alexander, which conquering all from Macedonia, to India, by his inexpected death, left his huge Empire to bee shared among his chiefe followers. Seleucus, the sonne of Antio∣chus, a Macedonian, first, maister of the Elephants; then Tribune; after that Depu∣tie of the Babylonians, at last obtained the kingdome of Asia, Anno M 3638. of whome Appianus thus vvriteth: The first King of Syria after Alexander vvas Seleucus, called Nicator, because hee was of very great stature; and as a wilde bull had in a sacrifice of Alexander broken loose, he helde him with both his hands. Hee built 16. Cities, called by the name Antiochia, of his father Antiochus: and fiue Laodicea's, in memory of his mother Laodice: nine Seleucia's of his owne name: three Apamea's, and one Stratonicea, after the names of his two wiues. He prospered in his warres, tooke Babylon, subdued the Bactrians; pierced to the Indians, which had slaine Alexanders gouernours (placed amongst them) after Alexanders death. He slew Lysimachus, and seuen monethes after was circumuented and slaine of Ptolo∣mie (whose sister Lysimachus had married) being seuenty three yeeres olde. To him succeeded his sonne Antiochus, surnamed Soter. A. 3667. who had obtai∣ned Stratonice his mother in lawe, of his father (moued thereunto by his sonnes vio∣lent loue, and his Physitians subtile perswasion.) His sonne Antiochus Thees was (contrarie to his name) poisoned by his wife: whose sonnes Seleucus, Callinicus, and Antiochus succeeded: and after them Antiochus Magnus, the sonne of Callinicus, who much enlarged his Empire, adding thereto Babylonia, Egypt, and Iudea: but inua∣ding Graecia, prouoked the Romans against him, with whom hee compounded on base and meane conditions: He did yet comfort himselfe for his losse among his
friends, saying, that he was Val.Max.l.4.c.1. beholden to the Romances, that eased him of so weighty a burthen, and lessened his cares of gouernement; (for they had coped him in a cor∣ner of his kingdome beyond Taurus.) After this he was shine: exhibiting in him∣selfe a true example of the worlds falshood, that playeth with Scepters, and vieth Diademes, vsing men like Counters or Figures, in numbring and casting accounts, where the same, with a little difference of place, is a pound, shilling, or peny, one, 10. or 100. And yet as earthly happines herein comes short of heauen, that it is neuer meere and vnmixed, but hath some sowre sauce to rellish it: so falleth it as farre short of hell, that not onely hope, but the most miserable hap, hath some glumpse of com∣fort. But to come to our historie. Antiochus his sonne, surnamed Epiphanes, and after Epimanes for his furious insolence, (who began his raigne A.M.3774.) was first sent to Rome in hostage, for securitie of his fathers faith: and after that Seleucus, his brother (which sent 2.Mac.3. Heliodorus to rob the Temple at Ierusalem) had a while war∣med the throne, succeeded in the Syrian kingdome. Of him and his tyranny Daniel had long before prophecied in the interpretation of Nahuchodonosors Image, Dan.2. whose legges are interpreted to be this Syrian, and the Aegyptian kingdomes, both heauy and hard neighbours to the Church in Iudes lying betwixt them: but more especially in his visions in the 7. chapter. Dan.724. Where, after other things, he fore-telleth of the 10. hornes, Trem.Iun. in Dan. D.Downam of Antichrist. D.Willet on Dan.4.c.7. which are the eight kings aforenamed, and two Aegyptian Ptolomies, E∣uergetes, & Philopater, in their times preuailing in Syrio, and infesting Iudea. And the last shall subdue three Kings, which were Ptolomey of Aegypt, driuen out of Syria, Seleucus his brother, and Demetrius, to whom, after Seleucus, the right of the Scep∣ter belonged. His policie, and blasphemie, and tyranny, are also by Daniel plaine∣ly fore-signified, and in their euent as fully in the historie of the Maccabees related. There you may reade his wicked life, and vvretched death: Hee tooke Ierusalem Calus. Anno M. 3781, and slew 80000. people, robbed the Temple of 1800. talents, and of the holy vessels; polluted the Temple; forbade the Sacrifice; named it the Temple of lupiter Olympius; forced men by tortures from their re∣ligion; with other execrable outrages, which vvould require a iust volume to de∣scribe. As he was thus madde and raging against the true religion: so Atb.l.5.c.4. Athenaus shew∣eth his vanitie in his owne, whose pompous solemnitie at the Daphnean feast hee thus relateth. Antiochus, in emulation to Paulus Aemilius, proclaimed this solemne festiuitie in the Cities of Greece, and performed it at Daphne. First passed in or∣der 5000. men, armed after the Roman manner: next followed 5000. Mysians, and 3000. Cilicians, with crownes of gold: of Thracians, 3000. of Galatians 5000. of whom some had shieldes of siluer. 20000. Macedonians, and 5000, with shieldes of brasse: after these, 240. couples of champions which should fight in single com∣bate. There followed 1000. Pisaean horse-men, and 3000. of the Citie, the most whereof had crownes and vials of gold, others trappings of siluer: Next came the band, called Socia, nothing inferiour in pompe or number: then 1000. extraordinarie, and another thousand in the band called Agema. Lastly, the barded horses 1500. all these in purple vestures, which many had embroidred, or embossed with gold: Chariots drawne with 6. horses, ICO. & 40. drawne by foure; one drawne by Elephants atten∣ded with 36. other. The rest of the pompe is incredible and taedious: 80O. youthes with golden crownes: 1000. fat Oxen, and 300. persons to attend the sacrifices: 800. Ele∣phants teeth. There were also the Images of all the gods, & Heroes that can be recko∣ned, some gilded, some clothed with golden vestures, their fabulous histories being with great pompe annexed. After all these, the Images of 'Day, Night, Earth, Heauen, Mor∣ning, and Noone. Then came a 1000. boyes, each hauing a peece of plate of a 1000. drams: 600. with vessels of gold: 80. women were carried in chaires footed with gold, and 500. in others footed with siluer, very sumptuously attired: 200. of them out of basons of golde strewed sweet odours. These spectacles lasted 30. dayes. A thou∣sand (and sometimes 1200.) halies or dining roomes, vvere furnished for bankets,
the king himselfe affecting too officious familiarity therein, visiting the tables of the baser people. So base is the pride of Ambition, tempeting a confused distemper; ac∣cording (in a strange harmonie) the harshest discord of proude-aspiring, and deiected basenesse; where a base and seruile minde begetteth pride, and pride produceth a seruile basenesse, a changeling, which the doting world fathereth on Humilitie. Of the death of this Antiochus, the former & second books of the Machabees seeme to disagree: and, which is more strange, the second booke in the first chapter saith, he and his company were destroyed in the temple of Nanaea in Persia: and in the ninth chapter saith, that in Media, at Ecbatana, he was smitten with an vncouth disease, and a fall from his Charlot, whereof he died. Some Mel.Canus, loc.l.2.C..11 that would haue this history Cano∣nicall, apply it to two Antiochi, as Lyra and Rupertus, and after them Canus: but Bellarmine Bel de ver. L.I.C 15. seeing that they will not agree with the times of any other, but Epiphanes, proueth himselfe Epimanes, and runneth madde with loue of that Trent-mini∣on: affirming that in the temple of Nauaea he fell, but escaped as Gen 14.16. Lot when he was captiued, and after parished, as is in the after-part of the historie expressed; whereas it is there said, that they shut the doores on him, and cut him and his fellowes in pee∣ces, and made them shorter by the heads: who yet after this (forsooth) could goe into Media, and there haue a fall from his Chariot. They must haue no delicate stomackes, that vvill bee Iesuites, any thing must downe, vvhen they vvill vp, especially, if Trent or the Vatican commaund, though manifest reason and sense (that I say not, Religion) countermaund. I enuie not the red hat vvith these la∣bels. Well fare that modestie of the Authour 2.Macc. 15.39 that confesseth his vveakenesse: but Anathema to their Anathema's, that enact Conc. Tri∣dent. contradictions to bee Canonicall. I omit the successours of Antiochus, to wit, Antiochus, Dometrius, Alexander, (who tooke away the golden Image of Victoria out of the temple at Antioch, in his necessitie: iesting that Iupiter had lent him victorie, and when hee would haue added Iupiter Iustin.1..33. to his sacrilege, was chased away by the multitude, and after slaine by Grypus.) The rest with the times of their raigne are before expressed. Supra tap.12 Pompey set an end to these Seleucidan Kings: and the Romanes enioyed the countries of Syria, till the Saracens dispossessed them: whose historie you may reade l.3.c.2. in their due place. The Turkes displaced those Saracens: the Christians of the West, by warre, made those parts Christian: but were expelled againe by the Turkes, and they by the Tartars. The Mamaluke Lib.6.c.6. slaues, and their Aegyptian Soldan after, held the Syrian dominion, vntill Selim the great Turke subdued it to the Ottoman Empire, vnder which it still groneth. Of these things this our historie will acquaint you in the pro∣per reports of these Nations. Aleppo, is now chiefe Citie of Syria: but Damascus both in elder and later times hath borre the greatest name, being the head of Aram, as Es.7.8 Esay affirmeth: cal∣led of Iulian the Citie of Iupiter, and eye of the whole East, Holy and Great. It is in∣terpreted drinking bloud, by Hier Com.in Ezec.l.8. Hierom, who telleth (from the Hebrewes tradition) that in this field Kain slewe his brother: Chytr. Oilo∣mastic. Chytreus expoundeth it saccus sanguinis, Wolphij com. i.l2.Ke.16. Wolphius deriueth it of two words, signifying bloud and to spoile: which in the times of Hazael and Benhadad, and of Resin it performed: but neuer so much as when the Saracens made it the sinke of bloud and spoyle, which they executed on the Christi∣ans: and Noradine, Saladine, and the Turkes, sitting themselues and this Citie to the name, before the Aegyptian Sultans, and Ottoman Turks were Lords of it. Stephanus ascribeth the name to one Ascus a gyant, which cast Dionysius there into the riuer: Or because Damascus, the sonne of Mercurie, comming hither out of Arcadia, built it: or because Dionysins their fleyd of the skinne of Damascus, which had cut vp his Vines. The Turkes now call it, as Leunclanius and Chytreus testifie, Scham, and so is the whole region called in the Arabian Chronicle, whose extract you may finde x l.3. in our Saracenicall historie. The Armies of Dauid, Ahab, Teglath-phalasar preuailed much against it: The Ba∣bylonians
subverted it: After that the Ptolomeys repaired it: Pompey wanne it: Paul hallowed it: The Saracens (as is said) polluted it. The Christians in vaine besie∣ged it, in the yeere one thousand one hundred fortie and seuen. Ch. Adrichom. beatrum Ter∣rae sanct. Tybell. Sanst. libr.17. Herold con∣tin.6. Haalon the Tar∣tar, one thousand two hundred threescore and two, obtained it, and about one thou∣sand foure hundred Tamerlane besieged it; and as hee had done at Aleppo, filling the ditch with the bodies of captiues and slaine carkasles, cast wood and earth vp∣on them, and at last forced it and the Castle. Hee spared the Citie for the Temples sake, which had fortie Porches in the circuite, and (within) nine thousand Lampes of gold and siluer. But the Aegyptians by a wile possessing it, hee againe engirt it, and recouered it. Hee commaunded Mahomet, the Pope or Chalife, and his priests, which came to meete him, to repaire to the Temple, which they did with thirteene thousand Citizens, where he burnt them all: and for monument of his victorie, left three Towers erected of skulles of dead men. The Aegyptians regained and held it till Selim the Turke dispossessed them 1517. Now in thus many alterations of State, who doubteth of diuersitie in Religions in Syria: First, the true Religion in the time of Noab, and the first Patriarkes. Next, those superstitions of Rimmon, and the rest before related, in the Assyrian, Baby∣lonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman gouernements: After which long night, the Sunne of Righteousnesse shone vnto the Syrians, and made a more absolute Con∣quest then all the former, not by Legions and Armies, but by a handfull of Fisher∣men, (manifesting his Power in their weakenes) the Reason of Men, and Malice of Deuils, not being able to withstand their Euangelicall weapons, which 2.Cor.10.5. were mighty through GOD to cast downe holdes & bringing into captiuitie euery thought to the obedi∣ence of CHRIST, Acts 11.20. insomuch, that hence the Christianworld receiued first that name. And, how sweete would thy name remaine. O Syrian Antiochia, euen now in thy latest fates, which first wast christned with the name Christian, hadst thou not out∣liued thy Christanitie, or rather; (after the soule departed) remained the carkasse of thy selfe; which ceasing to be Christian, hast long since ceased to be, had not the Diuine hand reserued a few bones of thy carkasse to testifie this his iustice to the world! And what harmonie could haue beene more gratefull to the Gentiles eares, then thy memorie (Damascus) where the Doctor of the Gentiles was first taught himselfe, and made a Teacher of others? But in thee was the Chaire of Pe∣stilence, the Throne of Sathan, the sincke of Mahumetan impictie to the rest of the world, infecting with thy contagion, and subduing with thy force more Nati∣ons then euer Paul by preaching conuerted. Syria, first in the first and principall Priuiledges of Mankinde, embracing in her rich armes (if some bee right Suruci∣ours) the promised Possession (the Seale of a further and better Inheritance) was with the first subdewed to Saracene seruitude: vnder their Caliph, vnder the Turks, vnder the Christians from the West, vnder the Tartars from the East, vnder the Mamalukes from the South, and from the North the Ottoman, by new successi∣ons and vicissitudes of miseries and mischiefes, become a common Stage of bloud and slaughter. And in all these later changes of State, and chaunces of Warre, Religion was the life that quickened those deaths, and whetted those murthering swords: no crueltie or sacriledge against GOD, or man, so irreligious and inhumane, but Re∣ligion was pretended to be the cause, and bare the Standard to Destruction; a new Religion alway erected with a new Conquerour. The rest of which, as professing their owne peculiar rites, haue their peculiar standing in this field of our Narrations assigned them: this one (which followeth) as a confusion and gallymaufry of diuers, I thought fittest here to insert. The Drusians are accounted reliques of the Latin Armies, which here warred a∣gainst the Turkes for recouerie of the Holy Land: These Giv.Bo.Ben, are circumcised as the Turkes, they take the liberty of Christians, in drinking Wine, and the licentious∣nesse of beasts, in incestuous copulations with their owne daughters. They serue their owne Lords, and are not subiect to the Turkes. Their habitation is not farre
from Damasco. Knolles in his Turkish History saith, That the right Drusians are not circumcised, otherwise agreeing with the former report; and addeth: That they fol∣low one Isman a prophet of their owne. A friend of mine, one master Iohn Pountesse, who hath been acquainted with them, saith they are circumcised. Selim and Amu∣rath laboured to depriue them of their freedom, which was in part by Turkish policy, and their own discords, atchieued by Ebratm the Turkish Bassa Anno 1585. Onely Mon-ogli or Ebneman, a Drusian Lord, kept himselfe out of his hands, and deluded his subtile practises: And thus these Drusians. with some Arabians in the middest of the Ottoman Empire, retaine some freedome from the Turkish thral∣dome. Maginus saith, That Tyrus, now called Suri, or Sur, is an habitacle of those Dru∣sian Robbers. Some place them betweene Ioppa and Damasco: I though this the fittest place therefore for their mention, as being accounted to Syria, and neighbors to Damasco, and of this hotch-potch Religion. CHAP. XVII. Of the Theologie, and Religion of the Phoenicians. PHoenicia is the Sea coast of Syria, after Plinie, or that coast and tract bordering on the Sea from Orthosa (now Tortosa) to Pelusium. Stra∣bo lib. 16. Sachoniatho a Euseb. de praep. Euang.lib. 1.ca,6. & 7. Phoenician, supposed to haue liued before the Troian warre, wrote in his owne language, the Historie of his Nation, which Philo Biblius translated into Greeke. This Philo in the beginning of his Worke saith, That his Author, Sachoniathe, as hee was generally learned, so especially he searched out those things, which Taan∣tus, called of the Aegyptians Thoyth, of the Greekes Mercury, the first inuen∣ter of Letters, had written: hee also blamed those, that by Allegories and Tro∣pologies peruert and obscure the Historie of their Gods; affirming plainely, That the auncient Phoenicians, Aegyptians, and others adored those men for Gods, that had beene the Authors of good things to men, applying to them also the names of those Naturall Gods, the Sunne, Moone, &c. so making some Gods mortall, some immortall. According to this Taautus therefore, the first beginnings of all things were a darke disordered Chaos, and the spirit of the darke aire. Hence proceeded Moth, which wee may interpret Mire, from whence issued the seedes and gene∣ration of all creatures in the Earth and Heauen. The Sunne by his heate separating these new-formed Creatures, their conflict in the aire produced Thunder, which noyse awaked, and caused to leape out of their earth, this slimie generation; after of the Winde Colpia, and Baan (which signifieth Night) were borne men, named Age and First-borne, of whome descended in succeeding generations those Gi∣ants, that left their names to the hills where they dwelt, Cassius & Libanus, that con∣tended against their brother Vson, who first aduentured the sea in the bodies of trees burned, (in which manner the Indians, euen yet, make their canoas or boats) and he erected two Statues to the Winde and the Fier, whom he adored with the bloud of beasts. These first men after their death had Statues consecrated to them by posteritie, and yearely solemnities. To these succeeded others, inuenters of Artes, hunting, fishing, building, yron-workes, tents, and such like. To Misor, one of these, was borne Taautus, first Author of Letters. At that time was borne Elius, and Beruth his wife, which dwelt in Biblos, the Parents of Caelus, and Terra, (his wife and sister) who deified with rites and ceremonies their father Elius, being torne of wild beasts. To these were borne Saturne, Batilus, Dagon and Atlas.
But Caelus taking other wiues, there arose a great quarrell betwixt him and his former, aided herein by her sonnes: of whome Saturne the eldest, created Mercurie his Scribe, by whose Magicall Arts, and by those Weapons (first by him, and Minerua the daughter of Saturne deuised) Coelus was ouerthrowne: who, after two and thirtie yeeres warre betwixt them, was taken by his sonne, and depriued of his genitories. Saturne had issue (besides his daughters Minerua and Proserpina) Amor, Cu∣pido, Saturne, Iupiter Belus, and Apollo, of his sisters, Ascarte, Rhaea, Dione. Then also were borne Typho, Nereus, Pontus, the father of Neptune. Saturne suspecting his brother Atlas, buried him in the ground, and cast vp a high hill ouer him: where, not long after, was a Temple erected to him. Dagon was inuenter of Tillage; and therefore called Iupiter Artrius. Iupiter of the Plough. But Saturne becomming a great Con∣querour, bestowed Aegypt on Taautus or Mercury, who first made a mysterie of their Theologie, as the sonne of one Thaion first did among the Phaenicians; ap∣plying allegoricall interpretations thereof to Nature; and instituting rites to Po∣steritie. This allegoricall Theologie of Taantus was interpreted by Surmobolus and Thurro. It followeth in the Historie, That it was then a custome, in great calamities, for the Prince to appease the angry Daemon with his best beloued sonne, and thus (in the time of a perillous warre) was Leüd the sonne of Saturne, by a Nymph, na∣med Anobreth, cloathed in royall apparrell, offered on an Altar erected for that purpose. This was practised long after by the King of Moab 2. King. chap. 3. who being besieged by three Kings of Israel, Iuda, and Idumaea, sacrificed his eldest sonne: which yet some interprete of the eldest sonne of the King of Idumaea. Taautus ascribed Diuinity to the Serpent, Trem. & Ius. as being of a most fierie and spirituall nature, mouing it selfe swiftly, and in many formes, without help of feet, and a crea∣ture which reneweth her age. The Phaenicians and Egyptians followed him here∣in, they calling it a happy Spirit or GOD; these, Eneth, and framed thereto the head of a Hawke: of which in his place we haue spoken. And thus far haue we beene in∣debted to Euseb.de praep. Euang.lt. I. In the time of those warres betwixt Saturne and Caelus was borne Hercules: to whom was a Temple of great Antiquitie at Tyre. To Hercules were also celebrated games at Tyrus, euery fiue yeares, to which Iason sent three hundred drammes for a sacrifice 2. Mac. 4. 19. Hiram in Solomons time pulled downe the old Temples of Hercules and Astarte, and built new. Hee first erected a statue to Hercules, and in the Temple of Iupiter consecrated a golden Pillar. Ioseph. antiq. lt. 8. The Sydonians also worshipped Astarte in a stately and antient Temple to her builded: whom Petr.Mart.Comm.in 1.Sa.7. some interprete Luna, Ci. de Natur. deor.lib.3. So Chytraeus, & before him, Eusebius and Plxutm in Mer∣cator. some Venus, and one of her Priests, to Lu.Dea Syr. cum annotat. Gilberti Cognat. Luci∣an, Europa. It is more probable, that Astarte was Iuno: for she was worshipped of the Punickes (a Phaenician colony) by that name. Lucian saith, that hee sawe also at Biblos the Temple of Venus Byblia, wherein are celebrated the yeerely rites of Adonis, (who they say, was slaine in their Countrey) with beatings and wofull la∣mentings; after which they performe Obsequies vnto him, and the next day they affirme him to be aliue, and shaue their heads. And such women as will not be sha∣uen, must prostitute their bodies for one day vnto strangers, and the money hence accrewing, is sacred to Venus. Some affirme that this ridiculous lamentation is made, not for Adonis, but Osiris; in witnes whereof, a head made of paper once a yeere in seuen daies space commeth swimming from Egypt to Byblos, and that without any humane direction: Of which Lucian reporteth himselfe an eye-witnes. Heereby runneth the Riuer Adonis also, which once a yeere becommeth red and bloudie: which alteration of the colour of the water, is the warning to that their Mourning for Adonis, who at that time they say is wounded in Libanus: whereas that rednes ariseth indeede of the windes, which, at that time blowing violently, do with their force carrie downe alongst the streame a great quantity of that redde Earth or Mi∣nium of Libanus whereby it passeth. This constancie of the wind might yet seeme as meruailous as the other, if diuerse parts of the world did not yeelde vs instance of the like. In Libanus also was an auncient Temple dedicated to Venus by Cinyras.
Astarte or Astaroth was worshipped in the formes of sheepe, not of the Sydoni∣ans onely, but of the Philistims also. I. Sam. vlt. in whose Temple they hanged the armor of Saul. And wise Salomon was brought by doting on women to a worse do∣tage of Idolatrie 1.Reg., 11.5. with this Sydonian idoll among others. And not then first did the Israelites commit that fault, but from their first neighborhood with them, pre∣sently after the dayes of Ioshua. Iud.2.13. This Sidon, the ancient Metropolis of the Phoenici∣ans (now called Saito) in likelihood was built by Sidon, eldest sonne of Canaan, Gen. 10.15. and fell to the lot of Asher. Iof. 16. 28. whence it is called Great Sidon. It was famous Chytrays O. nomast. for the first Glasse-shops, and destroyed by Ochus the Persian. This faire mother yeelded the world a daughter farre fairer; namely, Tyrus, now called Sur, (whose glory is sufficiently blazed by the Prophets Esuy, and Ezechiel) being situ∣ate in an Iland seuen hundred paces from the shore, to which Alexander in his siege vnited it; whome it held out eight moneths (as it had done Nabuchodonosor thir∣teen yeeres, which long siege is mentioned Ezec. 26. 7.) in nothing more famous, then for helping Salomon vnder Hiram their king, Anno mundi. 2933. & d. to build the Temple a hundred fifty fiue yeres before the building of Carthage. This Hiram ( Iof.contr. Ap. libr..1. Iosephus reports it out of Dius a Phoenician Historiographer) inlarged the Citie, and compassed within the same the temple of Iupiter Olimpius, & (as he addeth out of Menander Ephesius) there∣in placed a golden Pillar: he pulled downe the old temples and built new, and dedi∣cated the temples of Hercules and Astarte. Ithobalus, Astartes priest, slew Phelles the King, and vsurped the Crowne. He was great grandfather to Pygmalion the brother of Dido, Founder of Carthage. The Phoenicians, famous for Marchandise and Marinership, sailed from the red sea round about Afrike, and returning by Hercules pillars, arriued againe in Egypt the third yeere after, reporting (that which Herodotus Her.libr.4. doubted of, and to vs makes the Storle more credible) that they sailed to the South-ward of the Sunne: They were sent by Pharao Neco. Cadmus a Phaenician was the first Author of Letters also to the Greekes. At Tyrus was the fishing for purple: not far off was Arad, a popu∣lous Towne, seated on a rocke in the sea, like Venice. Alongst the shore is Ptolemais, neere which runneth the Riuer Belaeus, and nigh to it the Sepulchte of Memnon hauing hard by it, the space of a hundred cubits, Ioseph. de bel. Iu libr.2.ra 9. Pli.5.19.&.36 26. Strabo 16. yiel∣ding a glassie sand: and how great a quantitie so euer is by ships carried thence, is supplied by the Windes, which minister new sands to be by the nature of the place changed into glasse. That would seeme strange, if this were not yet stranger, that this new glasse if it be cast vpon the brinks of this place, receiueth the former nature of sand againe. Belus and Hercules Tyrius and the Sunne, called of them Heliogabalus, were Phoe∣nician Deities. Euseb.de laudib.constant. orat.& de Prep. lib.4.ca.7. Eusebius also relateth other Phoenician abhominations, both bloudy and beastly: the one in yeerely sacrifice of the deerest pledges of Nature to Saturne: the other in that temple of Venus, built in the most secret retreit of Libanus, where Sodome (burned with fire from aboue, and drowned in a dead sea) seemed to reuiue: such was their practice of impure lusts, intemperately vsing the Naturall sex, & vnna∣turally abusing their owne: worse in this then the Sodomites, that these intended sensuality; they pretended Religion. Constantine rased these suburbs of Hell, & de∣stroyed both the customs, statues, and temple it selfe. Aug.de Ciui. Dei lib.4.ca.10. Augustine saith, That the Phoe∣nicians prostituted their daughters to Venus, before they married them. Of Mel∣canthor, Vsor, and other their gods (sometimes men) I forbeare to speake. Alexan∣der Libr.2.ca.8. ab Alexandro, affirmeth, That the priest of the Sunne in Phoenicia, was attired with a long sleeued garment, hanging downe to the feet, and a golden Crowne. We may adde to these Phoenician superstitions, their mysticall interpretation by Macrobius. He expoundeth Venus and Adonis, to signifie the Earth and the Sunne. The wild Boare which wounded Adonis, is the Winter, which for the absence of her Louer maketh the Earth to put on her mourning weedes (at whose approch she af∣ putteth on her new apparrell, saith our English Arcadian Oracle;) This was shado∣wed in a certaine Image in mount Libanus, pourtrayed in mourning habite. And to
this sense he applieth the Aegyptian rites of Osiris and Isis, and of Orus, which is A∣pollo or the Sunne, and likewise the Phrygian mysteries of Atinis, and the mother of the Gods. He saith that they abstained from swines flesh. The Philistims and all that Sea-coast, by Strabo.lib.1 Pn.li.5.ca.12. Strabo and Plinie, are reckoned to the Phoenicians. Their originall is attributed to Misraim; They had fiue principall Cities, Ascalon, Accaron, Azotus, Gath, Gaza. Of their sheepish Astarte yee heard euen now, and of their Legend of Dagon. Their superstitions the Scripture often Iud.16.23.1.Sam.5.2. mentioneth. What this Dagon was (saith Comm.Petr. Mart. in Ind.16 Martyr) is not well knowne. But by the deriuation of his name (which signifieth a fish) it seemeth he was a Sea-god. For such Sea-deities had the Greekes and Latines, as Neptune, Leucothea, Triton: aboue his belly hee was of humane shape, beneath like a fish. Such is Idolatrie, diuine it will not be, it cannot content it selfe with humane, but proueth monstrous in the vg∣ly and deformed image, exhibiting the character of the true Author of this falshood. When Cicero Cic de Natur. deor. lib.3. saith, the Syrians worshipped a fish; it may be construed of this Da∣gon. Happily (saith Martyr Petr.Mart. com.in 1.Sam.5 ) they intended Neptune, or I know not what Deuill. Tremel. an∣not.in Iud.15. 23. Drul.Quaest. beb.lib.1.q.82. Tremellius thinketh Triton. This may we see and say, when men are giuen ouer to themselues, then they become beasts, monsters, deuills: yea, worse then such, for while they worship such, they professe themselues as Clients and Votaries to bee worse and baser then their Deities. Drusius deriueth not this Dagon of Dag a fish; but of Dagan, which signifieth Wheate, whereof Eusebius saith, Dagon inuento fru∣mento & aratro vocatus est  & Philo Byblius, Dagon, : that is, is called Wheate or Bread-corne. When the Philistims had placed the captiued Arke in Dagons Temple, hee fell on his face before the Arke: But they placing him againe in his roome, with a second fall, his head and hands were cut off vpon the threshold: The stump (or as Tremellius and Vatablus reade it) Dagon, or that part of him which resembled a fish, remained. And, therefore the Priests of DAGON, and all that come into DAGONS house, tread not on the threshold of DAGON. Thus true Religion, the more opposed, the more it flourished: the prison-house of her captiuity is the throne of her Empire: blinde su∣perstition, the more it is detected, the more enraged, addeth new deuotion, to in∣crease, not caring to amend the former. Of Astaroth, we haue before shewed, why it is vsed in the plurall number, as Ribera in Hos.2. Ribera affirmeth for her many Idols, as we say our Lady of Walsingham, our Lady of Loretto, &c. The word Astar signifieth a flocke of sheepe: and it is likely, this their Iuno was in the forme of a sheepe worshipped, as Iupiter Ammon in likenesse of a Ramme. Their Dagon, it seemeth (seeming wee haue, no true being nor being of truth, in Idols) was the same which Poets Metam.lib.4. call Derceto or Dercetis, the mother of Semiramis, whose Image Lucian Luc dea syr. saith he saw in Phoenicia, not vnlike to that which is reported of the Mermaid, the vpper halfe like a woman, the other like a fish: (therefore of Plinie Plin.li.5.c.25 called Prodigiosa;) in reuerence of whom the Phoenicians were said to abstaine from fish. Authors doe also call this Idoll Atergatis: and Athen.l.8.c.6 Athenaeus reporteth, That the Country-lawe of the Syrians depriued them of fish: and that Gatis (a Syrian queene) prohibited the eating of fish Ater Gatis, that is, without Gatis, without her licence, and therefore was called Atergatis, as a forestaller of the fish to her owne delicate tooth. Mopsus, a Lydian, after drowned her in the lake of Ascalon, where this fish-deuourer was of fishes deuoured. They yet esteemed her a Goddesse, and offred vnto her fishes of gold & siluer: and the Priests all day long set before her true fishes rosted and sodden, which after themselues did eate; & it is not to be doubted but the mettall-mawes of those Ostriges could also digest the other. Diod. Siculus Diodo.Sic.li.3.ca.2. telleth, That hard by a lake, full of fish, neere vnto Ascalon was a Temple dedicated to this fish-woman: her Story followeth, That shee yeelding to the lust of a yong man, had by that copulation Semiramis, whome (now too late re∣penting of her folly, she exposed on the rockes, where she was nourished by birds: of which birds (called in their language Semiramis) shee receiued that name. The Sheepheards after espying this hospitalitie of the birds, found the childe, and presen∣ted
her to Simma the Kings sheepheard, who brought her vp as his owne daughter. The mother(not able to swallow her shame and griefe) cast her selfe into the lake to be swallowed of the water, but there by a new Metamorphosis, was turned into a fish, and hallowed for a Goddesse; and (for company) the fishes of that lake, and the Birds of that Rocke were canonized also in this deifying deuotion. In Ascalon was a Temple of Apollo: and Herod father of Antipater, Niceph.lib.1.ca.9. grandfather to Herod the Great, hence called Ascalonita, was seruant to Apollo's Priest. At Ac∣caron was worshipped Baalzebub, that is, the Lord of Flies, Pet.Mart. in 2.Reg.1. either of contempt of his idolatry, so called; or rather of the multitude of Flies, which attended the mul∣titude of his sacrifices; or for that he was their Larder-god (as the Roman Hercules) to driue away slies: or for that D.Chytr.onmast. forme of a Flie, in which he was worshipped, as Na∣zianzeno against Iulian reporteth. He was called Sminibius or Myiothes: and was their Aeseulapius or Physicke-god, as appeareth by Ahaziab 2.Reg.1.2. who sent to consult with him in his sickenesse. And perhappes for this cause the blaspheming Phari∣ses, rather applied the name of this then any other idoll to our blessed Sauior, Matt.10.25. whom they sawe indeede to performe miraculous cures, which superstition had conceiued of Baalzebub, and if any thing were done by that idoll, it could by no other cause be effected, but by the Deuill, as tending (like the popish miracles) to the confir∣mation of idolatry. What the deuil had at Beelzebubs Shrine to this end performed, blinded with rage and malice, they imputed to the miracles of CHRIST, which, in regard of the Ef∣ficient, were more excellent then could bee Satans impostures, as countermaun∣ding him and all his proiects: for the matter, were meerely supernaturall; in the Forme were acted by his will, signified by his naked word: and for the end (which is Deut.13.2. the only touch-stone for vs to trie all miracles) were to seale no other truth then was contained (for substance) in the Lawe and the Prophets, whith hee came not to de∣stroy, but to fulfill. If an Angell from heauen, yea with heauenly miracles, (if it were possible) should preach vnto vs otherwise, Paul biddeth vs to holde him accursed: and cursed be that deuill of Hell, that vnder colour of miracles (one of Antichrists ensignes, 2. Thess. 2.9.) hath taught the World to worship the Lipsij vir go Halensis &c. Lipsian Historia Lau∣retana Turselini. Lauretan, and I know not what other Ladies: not that Virgin, on Earth holy, in Heauen glo∣rious; but their idol-conceits, and idol-blockes of her. Our Lord hath taught vs plainely in Mathew, chapter 4. verse 10. to serue God onely, without sophisticall di∣stinctions. As for these Heathenish & Popish, and all those other packets of miracles, which we receiue by the Iesuites annuall relations from the East and West Indies; I esteem them with Doctor Hall (a hall of Elegance, all-Elegance) Dec. I. epi. 6. That they are either falsely reported, or falsely done, or falsely miraculous, or falsely ascribed to Hea∣uen. But I know not how (pardon it Reader) I am transported to Hale, Zichem and Loretto, from our Phoenician ports. The name of Beelzebub hath beene occasion of this parenthesis. But the power of Beelzebub (I feare) hath induced Bellarmine, to fall downe, and thus to worship, him, for his purple aduauncement. For amongst the Notes of the Church, he hath reckoned for one, this of miracles: Maiusipse mira∣culum, a greater miracle hee, that now will not beleeue without miracles that go∣spel, which at first was thereby sufficiently proued. We reade that the Matt.12.39 Iewes seeke for signes, and are therefore called, an euill and adulterons generation; and not only Matt.24.24. false Christs and false Prophets, and Antichrist himselfe, but the heathens had their Legends of miracles: as the whole course of our History will shew. Goe now and reckon a Catalogue of miracles through all Ages, euen to the time of blessed Ignatius and his Societie: and aske of vs miracles for proofe of our doctrine. Our doctrine hath alrea∣dy by the Apostles and Prophets (Pen-men of holy Scriptures) beene proued that way; and we leaue to you the stile of Mirabiliarij Miracle-mongers, which August. Tractat. in Io. 13. for like bragges of things miraculous-ly wrought by them, giueth the Donatists. With vs, Miracles must be proued by the Truth and the Church, and not they by miracles. But let vs come backe to Phoenicia.
The Phoenicians are accounted first authors of Arithmeticke and Astronomie; as also of the Art of Nauigation (Primaratem ventis credere docta Tyrus, saith Tibullus) and obserued the North-starre to that Sea-skill. The Sidonians are reputed first au∣thors of Weights and Measures. Herod. Terpsic. Herodotus affirmeth, That the Phoenicians, which came with Cadmus into Greece, taught the Graecians both other Sciences, and also Letters, which before that time they knew not. These letters after changed their sound and forme, being by the Ionikes principally learned, who called them Phoeni∣cian, and called their Skinnes or Parchments biblos (haply of Byblos in Phoenicia.) He saw the Cadmean letters engrauen in a Temple at Thebes, much like the Ionike let∣ters. Animad. in Eseb. chron. pag.103. & d. ad 113. Scaliger hath giuen vs a view of the one and the other, the auncient Ionike, then the onely Greeke letters, out of certaine old inscriptions, much resembling the present Latine letters; and the auncienter Phoenician (I may say with him, the aunci∣entest) vsed by the Canaanites and Hebrewes of old, and by the Samaritanes at this day: For those which the Iewes now vse, he affirmeth to be new, corrupted from the Syrian, and these from the Samaritan. His learned discourse thereof were worthie the reading, but here would be too prolixe. Of the Phoenician Kings here might be inserted a large Historie; but I feare tedi∣ousnesse. Their Catalogue is thus in Scaligers Can. Isagog.l.2. Canons; first Abibalus, two yeares; Hirom, the sonne of Abibalus, 38. yeares; Baleazaros, 7; Abdestartus, 9; the Nurces sonne, 12; Astartus Dalaeastri F. 12; Aserymus, 9; Pheles, 8. moneths; Ithobaal, the Priest of Astarte, 32. yeares; Badzorus, 6; Margenus, 9; Pygmalion, 47. In his time Dido fled into Lybia. A long time after this raigned another Ithobalus 19. yeares; Baal, 10; and then Iudges ruled: Ecnibalus, 2. moneths; Helbes, 10. moneths; Abba∣rus the high Priest, 11. moneths; Balator, 1. yeare; Mytgonus and Gerestratus, 6; Mer∣bal (sent from Babylon) 4; Hirom his brother, 20. Thus much out of the Phoenician Antiquities: the rest of their Historie is for substance, the same with the Syrian before handled. Ioppe P.Mela.l.1. c.11.Plin.l.5. c.13. (sayth Mela and Plinie) was built before the Floud; and Cepheus raigned there, witnesse certaine auncient Altars, there obserued religiously, and bearing titles of him and his brother Phineus. They shew monstrous bones, the Reliques of the Whale, from which Perseus freed Andromeda. Mount Casius had in it the Temple of Iupiter Casius, and Pompeyes Tombe. CHAP. XVIII. Of Palaestina, and the first inhabitants thereof, the Sodomites, Idumaeans, Moabites, Ammonites, and Canaanites, with others. PHoenicia is stretched by some (as you haue read) euen to Aegypt, all alongst that Sea-coast, and in that respect partly, and partly because they obserued some neerenesse in Religion, I haue adioyned the Phi∣listims to the Phoenicians: howbeit, others doc confine Phoenicia betwixt the Riuer Valania and Mount Carmel. Thus hath Brocard. de∣script. Terrae sanciae, Magmud Geog. Brocard written, and after him Maginius; who doe reckon vnto Palaestina, Ga∣lilaea, Samaria, Iudaea, and Idumaea, leauing out Phoenicia, bounded as aforesaid, to make a part of Syria by it selfe. Of this Region I purpose to make larger dis∣course in the next Chapter; here intending to rake out of their dust the auncient Nations which inhabited this Land, before the Israelites were Lords thereof. The Sodomites sometimes inhabited a pleasant and fertile valley, watered by Ior∣dan, which Moses compareth Gen.13.10. to the Garden of the LORD, and the Land of Aegypt, for pleasure and plentie. To the Sodomites I reckon also those other Cities partakers of the same fertilitie and vengeance, Gomorrha, Adma, Zeboim, and little Zoar, saued
at the request of Lot. Their Kings and their Warres are mentioned, Gen. 14. Their wickednesse in many places of Scripture; which Ezechiel Ez.16.49. reduceth to these foure heads, Pride, Gluttonie, Idlenesse, and Crueltie, or hard-heartednesse. Their iudgement both Moses and others, and the place it selfe doe record. Their Religion was an ir∣religion, and prophane contempt of GOD and Man. Europe (I would I could not say England) can now yeeld the like: sauing that in our subtile, and more warie age, Policie, hauing eaten vp Religion, hath with the bloud thereof died her cheekes, and would seeme more shamefast then those former Sodomites. Thus did Es.1.10. Esay speake to the Princes of Sodome (in his time) and the people of Gomorah, in respect of that their wickednesse, which suruiued them, and hath fructified vnto vs, among whome yet the LORD of Hosts (as with them) hath reserued a small remnant from this worse plague then Sodoms brimstone, a Reprobate sense. The difference be∣twixt ours and them is, that they were more open, ours more close, both in like height. but not in like weight of wickednesse; our darkenesse excelling theirs both in the sinne, and in the punishment, in as much as a greater light hath shined, which wee with-hold in vurighteousnesse. And if you will haue the maine character of diffe∣rence betwixt these and those; the one were beastly Men, the other are Deuils in the flesh. First, from a sparke of Hell Concupiscence, (guided by Sensuall Lust, attended by Pro.1.32. Ease and Prosperitie, and further inflamed and blowne by the Deuill) an vnnaturall fire, (which still beareth the name of Sodomie) was kindled, which gaue coales to a supernaturall flame, rained by the LORD in Brimstone and Fire from the LORD out of Heauen, and burning euen to Hell againe (the α and ω of wickednesse) where they suffer (sayth Iude, v.7. Iude) the vengeance of eternall fire. This 2.Pet.2.6. is written for our lear∣ning, on whom the ends of the world are come, their ashes being made an example vnto them that should after liue vngodly. Let not any obiect the Preacher here, and re∣quire the Historian, seeing that Historie builds not Castles in the ayre, but preacheth both ciuill and diuine knowledge by examples of the passed, vnto the present Ages. And why should not I preach this, which, not my calling alone, but the very place it selfe exacteth? They being dead, yet speake, and the place of their buriall is a place to our memorie, being turned into a Sea (but a Dead Sea Iordan run∣neth into the Dead Sea, and there stayeth without issue to the Ocean. ) which couereth their sinnes, that it may discouer ours; which, as astonished at their vnnaturalnesse, hath forgotten her owne nature: It drowneth the Earth, which it should haue made (as whilome it did) fertile: it stayes it selfe with wonder and indignation, and falling in a dead swowne, sinketh downe with horror, not wakened, not moued with the windes blu∣string; refusing the light of the Sunne, the lappe of the Ocean, the commerce of Strangers, or familiaritie of her owne, and (as it happeneth in deepe passions) the co∣lour goeth and commeth, changing three times euery day: it gaspes forth from her dying entrailes a stinking and noysome ayre, to the neere dwellers pestiferous, some∣times auoiding (as it were excrements) both lighter ashes, and grosse Asphaltum: The neighbour-fruits participate of this death, promising to the eye toothsome and holesome foode, performing onely smoake and ashes. And thus hath our GOD shewed himselfe a consuming fire, the LORD of anger, to whome vengeance belon∣geth; all creatures mustering themselues in his sight, and saying at his first call to execution, Loe we are here. That which I haue said of these miracles, still liuing in this Dead Sea, is confirmed by testimonie of many Ioseph.de bel. Iud.l.5.c.5. Cornel.Tacit. bi.lib.5. These two describe it at large. Also Strabo, lib.16. Plin.lib 5.c.16. besides the moderne and elder Christi∣ans. Ptoloey placeth the middest there∣of in 66.50. & 31 10. l.7.c.16. Authors. Brocard telleth of those Trees, with ashes, growing vnder Engaddi, by this Sea; and a vapour, arising out of the Sea, which blasteth the neighbour-fruits; and the Gen.14.10. slime-pits on the brinkes of this Sea, which he saw. Neither strangers nor her owne haue accesse there, where Fishes (the naturall inhabitants of the Waters) and Water-fowles (the most vsuall guests) haue no entertainement, and men or other heauie bodies cannot sinke. Vespasian proued this experiment by casting in some bound, vnskilfull of swimming, whome the waters (surfetted with swallowing her owne) spewed vp againe. The
Lake, Iosephus sayth, is fiue hundred and fourescore furlongs in length (Plinie hath an hundred myles) the breadth, betweene sixe and fiue and twentie myles, Strabo tel∣leth of thirteene Cities still, (whereof Sodome was chiefe) of threescore furlongs compasse; whereof some were consumed by fire, or swallowed by Earthquakes and sulphurous Waters, the rest forsaken: some Remainders (as bones of those carkasses) then in his time continuing. L.Vert.l.1. c.9. Vertomannus sayth, That there are the ruines of three Cities on the toppes of three Hils: and that the Earth is without water, and bar∣ren, and (a greater miracle) hath a kinde of bloudie mixture, somewhat like redde Waxe, the depth of three or foure cubites. The ruines of the Cities are there seene still. Idumaea lyeth Southward from Iudaea: it had name of Edom, the surname of Esau, sonne of Isaak. The Historie of this people, and the Horites, ioyned with them, is related by Gen.36. Moses. It was subdued by Dauid, according to the Prophecie, The elder shall serue the younger. They rebelled vnder Ioram the sonne of Iehosophat; as Isaak had also prophecied. From that time they continued bitter enemies to the people of GOD, Ios. Antiq.13. 17. till Hircanus, the sonne of Simon compelled them to accept both the Iewish Dominion and Religion: after which they were reckoned amongst the Iewes. Of the Idumaeans were the Amalekites, 1. Sam.15. destroyed by Saul. They were South from Iuda. Iob.2.11. Elphaz the Themanite, it seemeth, was of Esau his generation, and of the right Religion. The Idumaeans, Moabites, and Ammonites are by some placed in Arabia, of which I will not contend: I here mention them, as both bor∣derers and subiects to the Israelites; of which we reade much in the Scripture; lit∣tle elsewhere that maketh to our purpose. South from Amalek was Kedar, a coun∣trey abounding with flockes of Sheepe and Goats. But I may not now dwell in the Tenis of Kedar, till I come to the Ismaelites. Moabltes & Madianites. On the East side of the Lake of Sodome is that Region which the Moabites (so often in Scripture mentioned) sometime inhabited: and before them the Emims, which were Gyants, tall as the Anakims, Deut. 2. 10. The Moabites were the posteri∣tie of Lot, by incest with his daughter. Arias Mon∣tanus. Moab had on the East the Mountaines of Horeb; on the West the salt Sea, and part of Iordan; Arnon on the South, and the North border stretched from Iabbok to the Mountaines of Pisga. That part of their Countrey, betweene Iabok and Arnon, Sihon King of the Amorites had taken from them, and lost againe to the Israelites. Balac their King, fearing to loose the rest, sent for Balaam the Wizard to curse the Israelites; who yet, by Diuine power, was forced to blesse them. Yet the lustre of Balacs promises so dazeled his eyes, that Apoc.2.14. he taught Balac to put a stambling-blocks before the Israelites, and by sending a∣mongst them their women, to draw them to carnall and spirituall whoredome; so to prouoke the wrath of GODS icalousie against them. But the zeale of Phineas stayed it; and Balaam, in his returne home ward to his Countrey of Mesopotamia, was slaine by the Israelites among the Madianites, partakers with the Moabites in Balaams idolatrous proicct. These Madianites descended of Abraham, Abrahams children by Kurah were authors of the Nations called Filij orientis, the children of the East, which inhabited the parts of Arabia betweene the Moabites, Am∣monites, and the Persians & Chaldaeans, from Mesopo∣tamia to the Persian gulfe. Ar.Mont.Ch∣nn. by Ketu∣rah, and dwelt in a part of Arabia, neere to the Moabites, on the East. Some of them dwelt neere to Mount Sinai, Exod. 2. 15. and in the Desart, on the East side of the Red Sea. Their mightie Armie was mira culously destroyed by Iud.7.20. the Sword of the LORD, and Gedeon. The Moabites were subiected to Israel by Dauid, and so continued to the Kings of Samaria, till, that State being rent, they freed themselues. It seemeth they worshipped the Sunne; as the names Kirchereseth, Beth-Baalmeon, and Balacs high places doe shew, and we haue obserued before in the worship of Bel and Baal. Che∣mosh was another Idoll of theirs, to which Salomon built an high place. Pehor also, and Baal pehor, and the rest, whose Rites are now rotten, and the memorie worne out. In their rebellion against Iehoram King of Israel, he and Iehoshapat, King of Iu∣da, with the King or Vice-roy of Idumaea, went to recouer them by force. The Moabite, in despaire, offered a bloudie Sacrifice of his eldest Sonne and Heire;
or, as Tremellius readeth it, Kg3.27. The King of Edoms sonne: which caused the Israelites returne. The Ammonites and Moabites might not enter into the Congregation of GOD, vnto the tenth generation, because Deut.23.3. they met not the Israelites with bread and water in their way, when they came out of Aegypt, and for hiring Balaam against them. Ar. Montanus sayth, That the Moabites were circumcised in imitation of the Israelites, but worshipped not their God, but their owne Idols. The Ammo∣nites succee∣ded the gyants called Zam∣zummias, Deut.2.20. The Ammonites (their brethren in the euill both of Lot their father, and their owne) inhabited Northward from Moab; on the East were the hils Acrabim; on the West the Amorite; the hils Luith, Basan, &c. made it a valley. Their chiefe Citie was Rabbath, after called Philadelphia. These Ammonites had beene troublesome to the Israelites, in the times of Iud.11.5. Iephte and of 1. Sam.11. Saul. And after, Dauid in iust re∣uenge, for violating the Law of Nations, destroyed them. Moloch, or Melchon, was their Idoll, which is supposed P Mart. in 2.Reg.2. Vatab. in Leu. 18. to be Saturne, whose bloudie butcherly sacrifices are before spoken of. It was a hollow Image (sayth Lyra in Leu. 18. Lyra) of Copper, in forme of a man. In the hollow concauitie was made a fire, with which the Idoll being heated, they put a child into his armes and the Priests made such a noyse with their Timbrels, that the cries of the child might not moue the parents to compassion, but they should rather thinke the childs soule receiued of the God into rest and peace: others Aet in Act. c.7. ex P. Fag. resert l.White. adde, That this Moloch had seuen Roomes, Chambers, or Ambries therein; one for Meale; a second for Turtles; a third for Sheepe; the fourth receiued a Ramme; the fift a Calfe; the sixt an Oxe: if a man would offer sonne or daughter, the seuenth was readie for that crueltie. Some interprete Moloch and Remphan, Act. 7. to be the Sunne and Moone. There was a valley neere Ierusalem (sometimes possessed by the sonne of P. Mart. in 2. Reg.2. Chytr. Oomast. Hinnom) where the Hebrewes built a notorious high place to Moloch: it was on the East and South part of the Citie. It was also called Topheth, or Tymbrell, of that Tymbrell∣Rite which those Corybantes and bloudie Priests did vse; or else for the spaciousnesse of it. Ier.7.31,32. Icremie prophecieth, That it should be called the Valley of slaughter, be∣cause of the iudgements for the idolatrous high places in it. Vpon the pollution here∣of, by slaughter and burials, it grew so execrable, that Hell inherited the same name, called Gehenna, of this place: first, of the lownesse, being a Valley: secondly, for the Fire, which here the children, there the wicked, sustaine: thirdly, because all the filth was cast out of the Citie hither, it seemed they held some resemblance. The Ammo∣nites also were (as Montanus affirmeth) circumcised. Canaan was the sonne of Cham, Father of many Nations, as Gen. 10.15. Moses declareth, Si∣don and Heth, Iebufi, Emori, Girgashai, Hivi, Arks, Sini, Arvadi, Zemari, Hamathi; the most of which were expelled their Countrey, slaine or made Tributarie by the Israelites. Their border was from Sidon to Gaza West, and on the East side from Sodome to Lasha or Callyrrhoe. Antiq Iudaic. l 3.c.7. Arias Montanus is of opinion, That according to the number of the twelue Tribes of Israel, so were the people of Canaan: and therefore to those eleuen before rehearsed, he addeth their father Canaan, who left his name to them all; and where he liued, retained a part to himselfe, betweene the Philistims and Amorites. Of those his sonnes, Sidon, the eldest, inhabited the Sea∣coast: and Eastwards from him Heth vnto the hill Gilboa: of him came the Hittites. Iebus went further, on the right hand: Emor inhabited the mid-land Countrey West∣ward from the Iebusites. The Girgashite dwelt aboue the Hittite, next to Iordan, and the Lake Chinereth (so called, because it resembleth the forme of a Harpe) after called Gennezareth. The Hevite or Hivite inhabited betweene the Amorite and the Philistim. The Arkite possessed the rootes of Libanus. The Sinite dwelt be∣yond the Hittite, Eastward, neerer to Iordan. Arvadi enioyed the Countrey next to the Wildernesse of Cades. Zemari obtained the Hils, called of him Scmaraim. The Hamathite possessed the Countrey nigh to the Fountaines of Iordan. As for the most notable Mountaines and Cities, which each of these Families enioyed, they which will, may reade further in the same Author.
Of these and their auncient Religions and Polities wee finde little or nothing but in the Scripture, where the Lord testifieth, that for their sinnes the Land spued them out. Some of them (as some thinke) fled into Africa: where Augustime Exposit.ep.ad Rom.nchoat. sayth, That the Countrey people, inhabiting neere Hippon, called themselues in their Pu∣nicke Language Chanani. Procopius, in the fourth booke of the Vandale Warre, affirmeth, That all the Sea∣coast, in those times, from Sidon to Aegypt, was called Phoenicia: and that when Ioshua inuaded them, they left their Countrey, and fled into Aegypt, and there mul∣tiplying, pierced further into Africa; where they possessed all that Tract, vnto the Pillars of Hercules, speaking halfe Phoenician. They built the Citie Tinge or Tanger in Numidia, where were two pillars of White stone, placed neere to a great Foun∣taine, in which, in the Phoenician Tongue, was ingrauen: We are Canaanites, whome IOSHVA the Theefe chased away. Which if it were so, the name of Hercules might therefore be ascribed to those Pillars, as accounted the chiefe Phoenician Idoll. Philo Pseudo Phile. de Ant. Bib. (or the Author of those fabulous Antiquities) sayth, That the Israelites found, among the Amorites, seuen golden Images, called Nymphes, which, as Ora∣cies, directed them in their affaires, and wrought wonders: the worke of Canaan, Phut, Selath, Nebroth, Elath, Desvat, of admirable workmanship, yeelding light in the night, by vertue of certaine stones, which could not by mettall be broken, or pierced, or be consumed by fire, but must needes haue an Angell to burie them in the depth of the Sea, and there let them lye. This people was not vtterly at once destroyed, but sometime, as in the dayes of Iud. 4.2. Iabin and Sisera, conquered their Conquerours, and retained some power and name of a people, till the times of Dauid, who destroyed the Iebusites, and dwelt in the Fort of Sion, calling it after his owne name, 2.Sam.5.7. The Citie of Dauid. And in the dayes of Salomon, Pharao, King of Aegypt, tooke and burnt Gezer, and slew the Canaanites that dwelt in the Citie, and gaue it for a present to his daughter, Salomons wife. And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Iebusites, whome the children of Israel were not able to destroy, those did Salomon make tributaries vnto this day. 1. King. 9.16,20,21. The posteritie of these seruants of Salomon are mentioned Nebe.7.60. among the Israe∣lites, which returned from the Babylo∣nian Captiuitie, and accrewed into one People with them.
THE FIRST PART OF THE RELATIONS OF THE WORLD, AND THE RELIGIONS OBSERVED IN ALL AGES, AND Places discouered, from the Creation, vnto this present. THE SECOND BOOKE. CHAP. I. The Preface of this Booke: and a Description of the Region of Palestina, since called Iudaea, and now Terra Sancta. IN the former booke wee haue traced the foot-steps of Religion, following her in her wanderings from the truth, and her selfe through diuers Nations, till we came into this Land, sometime flowing with milke and hony, whose first inhabitants we last tooke view of. The Hebrewes were, by the Soueraigne Lord of all, made heires of their labours, and possessed both their place and wealth: Houses and Cities which they builded not, Vineyards which they planted not, and which is more, these were a type vnto them of the true and heauenly Countrey, which, not by their merits, but by the meere mercie of the Promiser, they should enioy. These did GOD chuse out of all the kinreds of the Earth, to make vnto himselfe Exod.19.5.6. a Kingdome of Priests, a holy Nation, and his chiefe treasure aboue all people, though all the Earth be his: He made them the keepers Rom.3.2. of his Oracles, bestow∣ing on them Rom.9 4.5. the Adoption, and the Glorie, and the Couenants, and the giuing of the Law, and the Seruice of GOD, and the Promises: of whome were the Fathers, and of whome, concerning the flesh, CHRIST came, who is GOD ouer all, blessed for euer, A∣men. These things were not onely communicated, but appropriated to them: He Psal.147.20. shewed his Word vnto Iacob, his Statutes and his Iudgements vnto Israel: He dealt not so with any Nation; neither had the Heathen knowledge of his Lawes: Hee was their Prerogatiue, and they his peculiar: In Psal.76.1.2. Iewrie was GOD knowne, his name was great in Israel: In Shalem was his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Sion. And
CHRIST himselfe ratified it, acknowledging himselfe Mat.15.24. sent to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel, Rom.15.8. a Minister of the Circumcision, and said to the Cananite woman which besought him for her daughter, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to dogges. Such, in spirituall reputation before God were all people, excluded (as vn∣cleane dogges) out of his heauenly Ierusalem, till this Ephes.2.14. &c. partition wall was taken downe, and they which had beene farre off, were made neere by the bloud of CHRIST, who abro∣gated through his flesh that hatred, and made of twaine (Iewes and Gentiles) one new man in himselfe. So that the Gentiles (the name of all the world, excepting this people) which had beene without CHRIST, and aliants from the Common-wealth of Israel, strangers from the couenants of promise, had no hope, and were without GOD in the world; were now no more strangers and forreners, but citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of GOD : built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, IESVS CHRIST himself being the chiefe corner stone. Let it not be tedious to heare of this which the An∣gels reioyced to learne, Ephes.3.9.10. a mysterie which from the beginning of the world had been hid in GOD: and vnto principalities and powers in heauenly places, was made knowne by the Church. But the word (whereby we haue fellowship in this mysterie) came out of Sion, and the preaching began at Ierusalem. This (and not Rome) by the confession of Espen∣saeus, a learned Papist, on 1. Tim.4. was Emporium fidei Christianae, & Ecclesiae mater: The mart of Christian faith, and mother of the Church. Yea it was Act 13.45. necessarie that the word of GOD should first be spoken vnto them, which they by incredulitie put from themselues, and gaue place to the Gentiles. Rom.11.22. The fall of them became the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, as a glasse wherein we may behold the boun∣tifulnesse and seueritie of GOD, and in both the deepensse of the riches of the wisedome and knowledge of GOD, whose iudgements are vnsearchable, and his wayes past finding out. I may fitly compare them to Gideons Fleece, Iud.6. which receiued the dew, when all the earth be∣sides was drie, and after, it was drie vpon the Fleece onely, when the dew couered all the ground. Sometimes they alone receiued those dewes, shewers, riuers, seas of Sauing bountie, and all the world besides was a parched wildernesse. Now Psal.107.34, 35. he turneth the fruitfull land into barrennesse, for the wickednesse of the inhabitants; but that wildernesse he turneth into pooles of water, and the drie land into water-springs. Hee hath Rom 9.24: called them his people, which were not his people, and her beloued which was not beloued; and where it was said, yee are not my people, there they are now called the children of the liuing GOD. Thus hath the Rom.11.3. shut vp all vnder vnbeleefe, that he might haue mercy vpon all, that his free election might appeare (not of workes, lest any should boast themselues but) of grace. Behold therefore, all Atheists, and wonder! The Iewes branded with iudge∣ment, wander ouer the world, the contempt of Nations, the skumme of people, the hissing, derision, and indignation of men, for refusing him whom they expect, denying him whom they challenge, hating him whose name is in life and death vnto them, the sweetest tune, and most melodious harmony, still waiting for, and glorying in that Messias, whom (vnknowne) they crucified and slew: and still pursue with the deadliest hatred in all his followers: God they please not, and are contrarie to all men. Yet such is Gods manifold wisedome in his deepest iudgements, that his enemies shall fight for him, euen against themselues: the Midianites Iud.8. shall sheath their swords, which they haue drawne out against God, in their owne bowels, and Christian Truth shall pre∣uaile, and let our Deut.32.31. enemies themselues bee iudges. Out of their premisses which they maintaine, as earnestly as thou (O Atheist) securely deridest, which they will seale with that which thou makest thy heauen, thy God; we will and do conclude, against thee and them, that, in which, with which, for which we will liue and die. Let the old Testament yeeld the Proposition in prophecie, and the new Testament will Assume in Historie, and euen be thou the iudge, if that Reason, which thou hast as a man, and peruertest as a Diuell, will not by force of their Scriptures, which they preferre before their liues, necessarily in the Conclusion demonstrate the Christian Truth. Neither (I appeale vnto our common Reason) canst thou more wonder at vs for Beleeuing, things in thy seeming incredible, absurd, and impossible, then at them (vpon such grounds which with vs they hold) not The Iew is a witnes against the Atheist, that we faine not those pro∣phecies of Christ, seeing the Iew holdes the prophecies dearer then his bloud, and yet hateth Christianitie more deadly then the A∣theist. beleeuing.
For what beleeue we but, for the maine and chiefe points of our faith, are as plain∣ly in their Euangelicall Prophets, as in our propheticall Euangelists? All the Historie of Christ, in a more Diuine way, seemeth rather told then foretold, a Historie, not a Prophecie: as is casie by conference of both to shew, and thou, if thou beest not idle, or wilfully malicious, mayest find. That then which thou seest come vpon them, a spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and eares that they should not heare; which yet haue the light of the first Scriptures (had they not a veile ouer their hearts) the same see in thy selfe, that when greater light doth offer it selfe, willingly shuttest thine eyes, as though there could be no light, because thou liuest in, and louest, thy darknes. It is the same hand that giueth vp both thee and them, 2.Thess.2. because yee will not beleeue the Truth, to be saued, to strong delusions, that yee might beleeue lies, and be damned. To me, and all Christians, let the Iewes be both reall and verball teachers of the Truth, which they let fall, and we take vp; the one in their Oracles of sacred writte, the other in their exemplary iudgement. And to them, Let (O thou LORD of all heare and grant it) let all Christians be that which Moses prophecied, Deut.32.21. a prouocation to emulation, not of enuy and hatred, which hitherto hath beene in these, amongst all the Christian enemies, the most implacable and despitefull, but of imitation, that as Rom.11. their casting away hath been the reconciling of the world, their receiuing may be life from the dead, which Paul seemeth plainly to fore-signifie. THus much being premised as a preparation to our Iewish historie, which, as of more importance then any other, deserueth more ample view: let vs in the next place suruey that countrey which their progenitors had with those priuiledges, and their posteritie (together with those priuileges) haue lost. This countrie was first The name of the Coun∣trie. called the Land of Canaan, after that the posteritie of Ca∣naan, the sonne of Cham, had possessed it. Moses and Ioshua conquered it to the po∣steritie of Iacob, of whom it was called the Land of Israel: after the diuision of the ten Tribes from the house of Dauid by Ieroboam, in the time of Rehoboam the sonne of Salomon, the name of Israel was more particularly appropriated to those ten rebel∣lious Tribes, and the other two were knowne by the name of the kingdome of Iuda. Yet Israel remained in a generall sense the name of them all, especially in the new Testament. Paul of the Tribe of Beniamine Rom.11.1. & 26. calleth himselfe an Israelite, and all Israel, saith he in that Chapter, shall bee saued. After the Babylonian Ios.Antiq. 11.5. captiuitie they were called Iewes, of the chiefe and royall Tribe, and their countrie Iudaea: It was also called Palaestina, of the Philistims, which inhabited the sea-coast. And after in the times of the Christians it was generally called the Holy-Land, Phaenicia also being vnder that name comprehended. It is situated betweene the Mediteranean sea, and the Arabian Mountaines, Ptolomie Ptol.lib.7. cap.16. calleth it Palestina Syriae, and Iudaea, abutting it on the North with Syria, on the East and South with Arabia Petraea, on the West with part of Egypt, and the sea. Adrichomius, who hath bestowed a large volume on this subiect, which he calleth the Theater of the Holy-Land, on the East confineth it with Syria and Arabia; on the South the desert Pharan, and Egypt; on the North Mount Libanus; on the West, the Sea. Maginus placeth a part of Phaenicia on the North; on the North-east Libanus; on the South, and part of the East, Arabia; on the West, part of the Mediteranean sea. It is extended from the South to the North, from the one and thirtieth degree, to the three and thirtieth, and somewhat more. Others set it downe in other words; but these and they agree for the most part, in substance. It is commonly holden to be an hundred and sixtie Italian miles in length from Dan to Bersebee, and sixtie in breadth. An exact diuision thereof into twelue shires or shares, Ioshua setteth downe at large, with their bounds and Cities, from the thirteenth Chapter of that booke, to the one and twentieth, as they were by lot and Diuine dis∣pensation allotted to the twelue Tribes, the posteritie of Iacobs twelue sonnes; onely Ephraim and Manasses, the sonnes of Ioseph, constituted two Tribes, and therefore had the double portion, descending of Iacobs eldest sonne, by Rachel his first inten∣ded wife: and Leui had no portion, but was scattered in Israel, to keepe Israel from
scattering, and to vnite them in one religion, to one God, who disposed that curse vn∣to a blessing. Ruben, Gad, and halfe the Tribe of Manasses, had their portion on the East-side of Iordan: the other halfe of Manasses, with Simeon, Iuda, Beniamin, Ephraim, Naph∣thali, Aser, Dan, Izachar, Zabulon, had their portions assigned betwixt Iordan, and the Westerne sea. They which would be fully acquainted with their seueral diuisions, may finde in Ioshua himselfe to satisfie them, and in the Commentaries which diuers haue written on that Scripture. More, Stella, Adrichomius, and Arias Montansus haue in Maps presented them to the eye. Neither in the whole world beside is there (I thinke) found any region hauing more Cities in so small a space, then this sometime had, except we beleeue that which is told of the thousands of See lib.6. cap. 2. Egypt. Some reckon Achom. Pat. in each Tribe, these, as royall Cities: in Aser. Achsaph, besides Sidon and Tytus: in Beniamin, Bethel, Gabaa, Ierusalem, Iericho: in Dan, Lachis, besides Acaron and Gath: in Ephraim, Gazer, Samaria, Saron, Taphua: in Gad, Rabba: in Isachar, A∣phec: in Iuda, Arad, Bezee, Eglon, Hebron, Lebna, Maceda, Odolla, Taphua: in Manasse, 1. Dor, Galgal, Iezrael, Mageddo, Tanac, Thersa: in Manasse, 2. Asta∣roth, Edrai, Gessur, Machati, Soba, Theman, and Damascus: in Nepthalim, Asor, Ce∣des, Emath: in Ruben, Heshbon, Madian, Petra: in Simeon Dabir, Gerara: in Zebu∣lon Ieconan, Semeron. The like Catalogue hee maketh of Episcopall Cities in this Land, while it was Christian. My purpose is not to write of all, but especially of such as are in some respect eminent. And first let me dippe my pen in Iordan. This, saith Pliny, Plin lib. 5. cap. 15. is a pleasant Riuer, and as farre as the situation of places will permit, ambitious; prodigally imparting it selfe to the inhabitants, and (as it were vnwilling) passeth to that cursed Lake Asphal∣tites, of which at last it is drunke vp, losing his laudable waters, mixed with those pe∣stilent. As soone therefore as the valleyes giue opportunitie, it spreadeth it selfe into a Lake called Genesara, sixteene miles long, and six broad, enuironed with pleasant Townes; Iulias and Hippo on the East; on the South, Tarichea; and Tiberias on the West, made hole some with his hot waters. The fountaines of this Riuer are two, cal∣led Ex sontis no∣ac atque dclius disena Iarden dtas. Ar. Mntan. Ior, and Dan, which compounding their streames, doe also compound their names, as Tame and Isis with vs bring forth (happie parents) our Tames or Thamisis. This is the beginning of the aparent streame: But the true Iu.Ed Iud.lib. 3. 18. Brocard. and first conception of it is in Phiale, one hundred and twentie furlongs from Caesarea, a fountaine of vnsearch∣able depth, which yet (like some miserable Churle) alwaies containeth the waters in it selfe, till sincking, and as it were buried in the earth, those treasures being by Na∣tures stealth conueyed vnder ground, vnto Dan or Paneas, who is liberall of that vsu∣rers wealth (for into that Phiale powre as much as you will, it neuer encreaseth or de∣creaseth) and thence it becommeth a riuer. Philip the Tetrarch of Trachonitis, by ca∣sting chaffe therein, which was paid him againe at Dan, first found out this vnder-earth passage. The Saracens call that Phiale, in this respect, Medan, that is, the waters of Dan. Before it maketh the Lake of Genezareth, it maketh another called Samacho∣nitis. This is especially filled, when the snowes on Libanus are melted, which causeth Weissenburg. & Tem. 1.C o. 12.15. Iordan then to swell, and ouer-flow his bankes, in the first moneth, yearely, (and made the miracle in Ioshuas Iosh.3. passage thorow it the more miraculous) but in Summer it is almost drien vp. It is called the waters of Meron, halfe-way betweene Caesarea Philippi, where the mariage between Ior and Dan is solemnized, and the lake of Ge∣nezareth. Elias, and after his assumption, his cloke, diuided these streames: Naamans Leprosie was heere cleansed; and a greater Leprosie then Naamans is daily cleansed in the Church by the lauer of Regeneration, first sanctified to that vse in this streame, where the holy Trinitie Mlth.3. did first yeeld it selfe in sensible apparition to the world, thereby to consecrate that Baptisme, whereby we are consecrated to this blessed Tri∣nitie, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. In which respect, Adrichom. Timberley. Pilgrimes in memo∣rie thereof, do still wash themselues in this Riuer, spotting themselues further (I feare) by this washing with some mire of superstition. I cannot blame this sacred streame, if it seeme loath, as Pliny saith, to leaue so fer∣tile
a countrey, and lingreth as long as it may in lakes by the way, not onely for that Salt sea or hellish lake, which shuteth vp his guiltlesse waues in perpetuall imprison∣ment, but also for those pleasures in the passage the fruits of the earth without exacti∣on freely yeelded, as Roses, Sage, Rue, &c. of the trees, in Oliues, Figges, Pome-gra∣nats, Dates, and Vines (which last the Mahumetan superstition doth not cherish, and the westerne Christians did so husband, that one Vine Erocard. by their art and industrie, yeel∣ded three Vintages in August, September, October.) The Grapes of Eshcol, which could lade two men with one cluster, were not so famous, as Num.13.24. Irem. 8.22. & 46.11. Gen.37.25. Trem.Ios.Antiq. 15.5. the Balme of Gilead, which the first Merchants we reade of, from that mart, vented to other parts of the world. These Balme-trees grew in the vale of Iericho, which being cut, yeelded this precious liquor; whereof, besides the admirable effects in Cures, other wonders are told by ancient and later Writers, too long heere to relate. Bellonius Bellon lib.2. cap.39. will do it for me, if any list to reade his obseruations. He is not of their mind, which thinke there is now no true Balsam in the world (these in Iudaea being perished) but thinketh in Arabia-Faelix it groweth naturally, from whence some shrubbes he saw in Cairo. But I should be too tedious if I should insist on this argument: That instance of such a world of people, in such a patch of the world, doth sufficiently declare the fertilitie, when as Dauid 1. Chron. 21. See Trmel. notes on 2.Sam.249. numbered them, 1100000. Israelites, and of Iuda, 470000. or as in 2. Sam.24.9. 500000. which drew sword; and yet Beniamin and Leui were not rec∣koned in this number: and in the dayes of Ieroboam, 2.Chron. 13. Abija King of Iuda brought into the field 400000. and Ieroboam 800000. and on this part were slaine in one bat∣tell 500000. all choice men; which Historie cannot be matched with the like in all ages and places of the world: that a Countrey, an hundred and sixtie miles long, and not aboue sixtie in breadth, should nourish at once, or lose in a battel such multitudes, not to speake of impotent persons, women and children. But this multitude by eiuill warres and inuasions of enemies decreased, till first the reliques of Israel, and after, the remnant of Iuda, were by the Assyrians, and Babylonians led captiue, and the Land enioyed her Sabbaths. For the Kingdome of Israel consisting of ten Tribes (some reckon Simeon also to Inda, because of his portion mixed with Inda's as Beniamins was adioyning thereto, to whom the Leuites 2.Chron..14. likewise, and Priests forsaking their Cities, and all the religious Israelites annexed themselues) forsooke A great part of Beniamin, and Simcon was subiect to Dauids poste∣titie. not the house of Dauid only, but the house of the Lord, and set them vp Calues (Egyptian superstitions) at Dan and Bethel, and made Priests for their Idolatrous purpose. This their rebellion and Apostacie God plagued with ciuill dissension and forren hostilitie, vntill at last the Assyrians 2.Reg.17. remo∣ued them altogether, and repeopled those parts with new Colonies. Such is the end of Religion, which hath not God for the beginning, but is grounded on humane po∣licie, a sandie foundation. Iuda could not take warning, but prouoking God by Ido∣latrous courses, at last was carried to Babel, and thence, after seuentie yeares, returned. The historie of these things, so fully related in Scripture, I should but marre in the telling. After this their returne the Land was not, as before, named after the portions of the seuerall Tribes: but was called by a generall name, Ios. Antiq. 11.5. Iudaea, and the people Iewes, be∣cause the Tribe of Iuda had before inhabited those parts, or at least the principall of them, dilating themselues further, as they increased in number and power. But more especially Iudaea was the name of one Palaestina di∣uided into 3. parts Galilee samaria Iudaea. third part of the countrie, by that name di∣stinguished from the other two, Samaria, and Galilea, which two last are sometimes referred to Phoenicia. Galilaea was the most Northerly, confining on Libanus and Antilibanus toward the North, Phoenicia Westerly, Coelesyria on the East; and Samaria, with Arabia, in∣closing her Southerly borders, Iordan parteth it in the middest. It was diuided into the higher and lower Galilee: the higher called also Galilee of the Gentiles, contai∣neth the springs of Iordan, and those Cities which Salomon gaue to Hiram. The lower was also called Galilee of Tiberias, that Citie giuing name both to the lake and regi∣on: in which Nazareth was famous, and the hill Thabor.
Samaria is seated betwixt Galilee and Iudaea much lesse then either of them. Iu∣daea is the most Southerly; betweene the Mediterranean and Dead seas, Samaria, and Idumea. Pliny maketh Galilaea a part of it, and Peraea another part, separated from the rest by Iordan. The rest he diuideth into ten Toparchies; Ierico, Emaus, Lidda, Ioppe, Acrabatena, Gophnitica, Thamnitica, Betholene, Tephene, Orine, in which was Ieru∣salem farre the fairest of the Cities of the East, not of Iudaea alone: Herodium, with a famous towne of the same name. He addeth vnto these the Region of Decapolis, so called of the number of the Townes, and the Tetrarchies; Trachonitis, Pancas, Abi∣la, Arca, Ampeloessa, Gabe. Those ten Townes of Decapolis were Caesarea, Philip∣pi, Asor, Cedes, Neptalim, Sephet, Corozain, Capharnaum, Bethsaida, Iotapata, Ti∣berias, and Bethsan, otherwise called Scythopolis, and before Nysa, where Bacchus buried his nurse. But these are parts of those former parts aboue mentioned; and so may we say of the rest, sustaining, in diuers respects, diuers diuisions, best fitting to the present polities, and little to our purpose. Those things which of old were famous in those places, are mentioned in the Scripture: Those things which since haue been more remarkable; I purpose in the next part of this Worke, of Christian Religions, to handle, and especially the rarities of Ierusalem, sometimes the holy Citie, and Citie of the great King, now a den of theeues; a habitation of Mahumetans, or rather now not at all: for this which is now, is a new Citie, called by the Founder, Aelia Capitolina, built by Aelius Adrianus, who cau∣sed the plough to passe thorow, and Salt to be sowne in the old, as testifying her eter∣nall desolation; and fulfilling Christs Prophecie to the vtmost, not leauing a stone vp∣on a stone, if Titus had not fully accomplished the same before. Arias Montanus in his Nehemias affirmeth, that Ierusalem was founded on three hilles; to wit, Sion, on which the Iebusites built their Tower; and which in Dauids time was further builded on, and called the Citie of Dauid. The second hill was Mount Moriah, which Dauid bought of Aranna, to erect thereon the Temple. The third was the higher Acra, cal∣led the Suburb. These were compassed with one wall without; and within diuided with three walles, by which the Citie of Dauid, and Moriah, and the higher Acra were diuided: In the circuit of the walles were nine gates. He that desireth further to reade, or rather to see the old Ierusalem, with her holy fabriques, let him resort to Arias Montanus his Antiquitates Iudaicae, where he both relateth, and in figures presenteth these things. It is supposed that Melchisedech built it about the yeare of the World, 2023. and called it Salem. The Iebusites after possessed it (and of them some deriue the name Ierusalem, quasi Iebussalem) till Dauid expelled them: who had before reig∣ned in Hebron (called Cariatharbe, the Citie of foure men, say some, because of A∣dam, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, both dwelling and buriall there; yet Adam, others say, was buried in Mount Caluarie, with other speculations curious and vncertaine.) He translated the highest seat both of spirituall and temporall regiment to Ierusalem, where he raigned after, three and thirtie yeares, to whom succeeded Salomon, and the rest in order. It then contained in circuit fiftie furlongs, compassed with a great ditch sixtie foot deepe, and two hundred and fiftie broad. Nabuchodonosor destroyed it, Nohemias reedified it, three and thirtie furlongs in circuit: The Macchabees, Herod, and others added to her excellence, till Titus besieged and tooke it; in which siege are said to haue perished 1100000. people; and being now a sepulchre of dead car∣kaffes, was made a spectacle of Diuine vengeance, for murthering the LORD of Life. But those strugling spirits, and small remnants of life which remained in this for∣lorne carkasse of the sometime Ierusalem, breathed a new rebellion, in the time of A∣drian and thereby breathed her last, as before is said. The Historie of this Citie the Scripture hath recorded; and where Diuine Historie endeth, Iosephus and Hegesippus (that I speake not of late Writers) haue largely supplied, especially concerning her latest fates, and, as I may terme it, in her funerall Sermon. Iustin.lib.36. Strabo lib.16. Strabo, Iustine and others haue written of this people, but not sincerely. But the fountaines are cleare enough to acquaint vs with their true originall, which commeth next to be considered.
CHAP. II. Of the Hebrew Patriarkes, and their Religion before the Law: also of their Law and Politie. THe name of Hebrewes some deriue from Abraham, as if they were called Hebraei quaesi Abrahaei. Arias Montanus Mon. de An∣tiq.lud.Canaan, vel lib.3.cap.9 telleth vs, that this name of Hebrewes was not appropriate to any family, but common to all such, as hauing passed ouer the riuer Euphrates fixed their tents, and abode betweene that riuer and the great sea. He gathereth this from the Hebrew word, which signifieth to passe ouer. Such an one first of all was Heber, seeking a life answerable to his name: whose example (saith he) Thare imitated: and after, Abram for his twofold transmigration from Chaldea, and from Haran, deserued that name, and left it to his posteritie. But Ios.Antiq.lib.1. cap.6. Iosephus, Aug.De Ciuit. Dci.l.26.c.13. Augu∣stine, and others, more fitly and truely, of Heber the fourth from Shem, the sonne of Noah, with whose family, as we haue said, continued the ancient Language of the world, called of his name, Hebrew: his sonne Peleg, or Phaleg, bearing the name of that diuision, which at the time of his birth the rest of the world in their languages sustained. This Peleg was Grand-father to Serug, whom some affirme to haue beene the first maker of Idols, which were afterwards worshipped by Nahor his sonne, and Thare his nephew, the father of Abram, who preached openly that there was but Ios.Antiq.lib.1. cap.7. one GOD, Creator and Gouernour of all things; and by this doctrine prouoking he Chaldaeans against him, warned by Oracle, departed towards Canaan. Bellarmine Bel.de Not. Eccles.l.4.c.9. so eagerly swalloweth this opinion, that he taxeth Caluine of Heresie, or attributing to Abraham the contrarie; namely, that Abraham, before GOD cal∣led him out of Vr, was an Idolater: an opinion so much more probable, then the o∣ther, as hauing better authoritie. For Ioshua Ios.24.2. obiecteth to the Israelites their fore-fa∣thers Idolatrie, and nameth Abraham amongst them. And Genebrard Genebrard. Chron. lib.1. doth so inter∣pret it; and Mazius Maz. in los.24. in his Commentaries on that place, both zealous and learned Papists: yea Lindanus Lindan. i Panop. specifieth the Idolatrie, and calleth him a worshipper of Ve∣sta. Suidas Suidas. saith, that Abraham by the obseruation of the Creatures in his studie of Astronomie, lifted vp his minde aboue the Starres, and by the glorie, and order of them, learned the knowledge of God, neuer ceasing that Diuine search, till God ap∣peared to him. Which opinion may reconcile both the former: that first he was, and after ceased to be, and Idolater, before God appeared in vision to him. Hec alledgeth philo for his Author, that at fourteene yeares Abraham reproued Thara for seducing men vnto Idolatrie (moued by his priuate lucre) with Images: and seeing the Heauen sometime cleare, sometime clowdie, he gathered, that that could not be God. The like hee concluded of the Sunne, and Moone, by their eclipses (for his father had taught him Astronomie). At last God appeared, and bad him leaue his countrey. Whereupon he tooke his fathers Images, who (as before is said) was an Image-ma∣ker, and partly broke, partly burnt them, and then departed. Suidas further thinketh him the first inuenter of Letters, of the Hebrew tongue, and of the interpretation of dreames; which I leaue to the Authors credit. But for the fault of Abraham before his calling, and other blemishes after, in him and the rest of the Patriarkes; what doe they else, but in the abounding of mans sinne, set out the superabounding grace of God? and are prositable, as learned Morton Mort. Ap.p.1. lib.1.cap.30. in answere of this cauill, hath out of one of their owne Sixtus Senens. Bib. lib 7. cap.8. obserued against them, what he had obserued out of Augu∣stine, to these foure purposes: Faith, Instruction, Feare, and Hope: the Faith of the Historie which slattereth, or concealeth the faults of none: Instruction to vertue, by seeing others faults taxed: Feare, for what shall shrubbes doe, if Cedars fall? and Hope, that we imitate their repentance, by seeing their pardon.
But to returne to our History. Many of the Ethnike histories mention him: Berosus commendeth him for his iustice, and skill in Astronomie. Nic. 'Damascenus saith, that he reigned at Damascus, & that in his time, his house continued in Damascus, & was still called by his name: Hecataeus wrote a booke of him: and Alexander Polyhistor telleth that he was borne in the tenth generation after the Floud in Camarine (or V∣rien) a Citie of Babylon. Iosephus Antiq lib. 1. cap.3. addeth, that when famine draue him into Egypt, Gen. 12. he disputed with the Priests, and most learned Egyptians, in questions of Di∣uinity; and in their diuided sects, hauing confuted one by another, he communicated to them the truth, both in this, and in Arithmetike and Astronomie, whereof before the Egyptians were ignorant. Abram (saith M. Broughton in his Concent) was borne sixtie yeares later then the common account; as appeareth See the Chronologie, chap 11. by computation of Terahs age, who died at two hundred and fiue yeares, and after his death Gen. 12.4. Abram went from Charan into Cannan, the threescore and fifteenth yeare of his owne life; and therefore was borne in the hundred and thirtieth, and not in the seuentieth yeare of his father, in the 352. yeare after the Floud; whereas the common opinion reckoneth the 292. To Abram God had giuen commandement, saying: Go from thy country, and from thy kin∣dred, and from thy fathers house into the Land which I shall shew thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, &c. His history is fully related by Moses, and his progenie also, whereof Ismael his son by Agar, and other his sons which he had by Ketura his second wife, he sent to inhabit. the East country (Arabia) in his life-time: but Isaac was made his heire, both Tempo∣rall and Spirituall: to whom Iacob succeeded in the promised blessing: who with his sons and family went downe into Egypt, where his posterity multiplied exceedingly, and were called sometime Ebrewes of their ancient pedegree; sometime Israelites, of the name Israel, giuen to Iacob by the Angell, Gen. 32. 28. Their whole historie so largely and plainly in holy Writ recorded, I feare to make Mine, by euill reciting: Those Fountaines are more open to all, then that any should need ours, or others Brook, mixed with some mirie earth (at least) in the passage: (and my intent is to be largest in relation of those things which are not in the Scriptures; touching the same briefely for order sake). Their religion, meane while, was the best amongst the best, though stained in some, as Rachel, which stale her father Labans Idols; and Iacob was forced after to reforme his family in this respect; and after in Egypt they were cor∣rupted with the Egyptian superstition, as Ezechiel in his twentieth Chapter prote∣steth against them. The manner of Diuine worship was not so straitly limited, as after, to persons and places. By reuelation and tradition they receiued the religious wor∣ship, wherein they instructed their posteritie: vntill that in their extreamest thraldome God sent Moses and Aaron to deliuer them: vnder whose conduct they passed tho∣row the sea and wildernesse to the brinkes of Iordan, receiuing in the way that Law; which as a Tutour, or Schoole-master was in that their nonage to traine them vp, vn∣till that full and ripe age; when Galath.4.4. God sent his Sonne made of a woman, made vnder the Law, that he might redeeme them that were vnder the Law, that we might receiue the a∣doption of sonnes. Of this Law, although Moses hath giuen vs an absolute relation in the Scripture, whereof he was the first pen-man (of that at least which remaineth vnto vs) yet if we shall out of him, bring them into their order, and ranke them vnder their seuerall heads, as Sigonius Car. Sigon.de rep. Hebr. and others haue done; it shall not be, I thinke, ouer-tedi∣ous to the Reader. The Law is diuided vsually, into the Morall, Ceremoniall, and Iudiciall, as parts of the same: the first deliuered on the Mount Sinai, by the dreadfull voice of the Al∣mightie GOD, and by the finger of GOD, written after in Tables of stone, called ten words, summarily abridged into two Commandements, by the Law-giuer him∣selfe; Mat.22.38. The first and great Commandement enioyning the loue of GOD, the second, of our neighbours, that GOD, who himselfe is Charitie, imposing nothing but the loue∣ly yoke of Loue and Charitie vnto his seruants. This Law is Eternall, written first in the hearts of our first parents, which being defaced, it was written againe in the stony Tables of the Law, where it was but a killing letter, till Grace and Truth by IE∣SVS
CHRIST indited and indented it in the fleshie Tables of the Gospell, as Io.13.34 CHRISTS new Commandement written in renewed hearts, and shall for euer bee then grauen in those spirituall Tables, when we that heere are 1.Cor.15.44. naturall men, shall rise againe spirituall men; and shall be the law of that holy Citie, the new Ierusalem; this be∣ing then perfected, when 1.Cor.13. Faith, and Hope, and this World shall be finished. The o∣ther parts Ceremonial and Iudicial, were (for the particulars) proper vnto that nation; the one respecting the manner of Diuine seruice, the other of Ciuill gouernment: not giuen (as the other) immediately to the Israelites by God himselfe, but communica∣ted in the Mount to Moses, that he might acquaint the people withall. This nation was diuided, as is said alreadie, into Tribes, according to the number of Iacobs sons, amongst whom Leui had no portion (but the Lord was their portion, they seruing at the Altar, & liuing of the Altar) but 48. cities with their suburbs assigned for their ha∣bitation, amongst other Tribes, that being so dispersed, they might disperse also, and preach the Law to the rest: and were reckoned Iud.17.7. to that Tribe with which they dwel∣led: and whereas others might not marry, for feare of alienation of their inheritances; into another Tribe, this of Leui either had, or tooke libertie herein, as Indg. 19. and 2.Chro. 22. Ioiada married the Kings sister; and thus Elizabeth, wife of Zachary the Priest, might be cousin to Mary the mother of our Lord. The number of twelue re∣mained yet entire, in reckoning of these Tribes, because that Ioseph had a double por∣tion, and his sonnes, Ephraim and Manasses, made two Tribes. Neither were they a∣lone reckoned Israelites, that naturally descended from some one of these twelue sons of Israel, but such also of other nations as embraced their Ceremonies and Religion, being for distinctiō sake called Proselytes. The Hebrew Ar.Montan. in Mattb.23. word which is interpreted a Proselyte, signifieth extracted, or drawne forth, because they esteemed such, drawn forth of hel: whom yet they made the childrē of hel, more then themselues, in burthening their consciences, not only with those Ceremonies whereunto the Law and their tradition tied them, but with diuers others also. The name Proselyte, as Drusius affirmeth, Drus.de 3.sect. lib.2. is either taken largely for any stranger, or strictly for a conuert to their religion. A Pro∣selyte was made with obseruation of three things, Circumcision, Baptisme or wash∣ing, and Oblation. The first was a signe of the Couenant, in which they were recei∣ued: the second, as a badge of their cleannes; (for all the Gentiles were vncleane) the third, for the attonement with God. This was while the Temple stood, and now is not in force: but whether Baptisme be still vsed, I know not. He ought to be circumcised in the presence of three. A woman Proselite was admitted by Baptisme only, and the offering of two Turtles, or two Pigeons. Serarius saith, Baptisme and circumcision are still required: the like is written by Munster in l. Praecept. Mos. cum expos.Rab. Et in Euangel. Matth. Hebr: Anot.cap.22. Munster, who addeth, that when any desireth to become a Proselite, they propound to him the hardest things of the law: with the pro∣mises of future happines: and if he continue his purpose, they circumcise him, & when he is whole, Baptise him; & then account him an Israelite. The same Author elswhere handleth the same their ceremonies more at large: he saith that they propound to him their strictest obseruations, as of the Sabbath, not eating fat, &c. with some penances, that he should not after say, had I wist; and they would seeme to be willing by these meanes, to driue them from their religion, as being corrupted by such new commers: but CHRIST affirmeth otherwise. Matth. 23. The gouernment of this state was after Moses & Ioshua managed by Iudges of di∣uers Tribes, not by election nor inheritance succeeding in that office, but by appoint∣ment of God, till they desired a King, whereas before God was their King, and by his law partly, partly by oracleruled, the State, being as some think an Aristocratie. There were besides these Iudges, Princes of each Tribe, and the heads of families: there was also a gouernmēt in each City by the Elders or Senate, exercised in the gates ther∣of. They had accordingly their Coūcels or assemblies, either of the whole nation, or of a whole Tribe, or of some one city: they had their Elders or Senators in like maner, ha∣uing authority, some for the whole nation, some Car. Sigmi.de rep. Heb.lib.6. &7. (if we follow some mens cōiectures) for their own tribe; some in their proper city. The first of these was the Sāhedrin or 70. Elders appointed by GOD, Num. 15. & continued vnto the destructiō of that natiō, &
their court was kept in the seat Royal, or mother-City of the Kingdome: to which, ap∣peale was made from the inferiour Courts in obscure & difficult cases. They had Iud∣ges also appointed, and Magistrates, hauing iurisdiction ouer a thousand, a hundred, fiftie, or ten. They had besides, their Officers in time of warre, & Officers of the Tem∣ple: which I haue but named to the Reader, who, if he desire fully to bee informed, concerning their politie, and State-affaires: Carolus Sigonius (not to mention others) in his sixt and seuenth booke. De Repub. Hebraica, will reasonably satisfie him. Yet I hold it not impertinent to mention (somewhat more largely) what Petrus Galatinus . Galat.de Acas. lib.4. cap. . &6. hath written of this Iudiciary power of the Israelites, by the ceasing wher∣of, he proueth, that the Messias is alreadie come, according to Iacobs prophecie, Gen. 49. He sheweth therefore that the Sanhedrin were the successors of those seuentie El∣ders, which were appointed assistants to Moses, Num.11.18. to whom belonged the determination of all difficulties and hardest questions of the Law; as appeareth, Den. 17 from whom was no appeale. They were called Sanhedrin, whom we may call or∣dinarie Iudges, and Mehokekim, that is, Scribes, or Law-giuers, because whatsoeuer they deliuered or writ, was receiued as a Law. Their Colledge represented that Scepter, by the holy Ghost in Iacob promised to Iuda: and therefore not only vnder the Kings and Iudges did exercise iudgements, but also when there was no King, or Iudge in Israel. Of their qualitie it is thus written in the booke Sanhedrin. They appointed none (said R.Iohanan) but men of wisdome, stature, and of goodly Apparentie. presence, and of old age, and cunning in exorcismes, and vn∣derstanding the seuentie tongues, that they might not need interpreters. Their stature and comelines, Rabbi Selomoh saith, was required, to acquire thē reuerence; & skill in enchantment, to conuince such wisards. Of their power in Sanhedrin Babilonice, is thus written: Foure kindes of Death was in their power, Stoning, Burning, killing with the Sword, & strangling. R. Akiba affirmed, that they fasted all that day in which they ad∣iudged any to death. Mony-matters were ordered by three Iudges, as were all moue∣able goods: iudgement of life by 22. of these 70. vnder which number they could not condemne any to death. But in cases of a Tribe, or Scepter, or false prophet, or high Priest, were required the whole number of seuenty and one: the like was in going to war, in adding to a city, or the reuenewes of the Temple, or in conuenting the ordina∣ry Iudges of the Tribes, To cōstitute one of this nūber they vsed imposition of hands; R.Iudas saith of fiue. A wolfe, lion, beare, leopard, & serp̄et, were to be slain by the 23. The great Colledge called Sanhedre ghedola, consisted of 71. the lesse of 23. That odde number aboue 70. was to supply the roome of Moses, which was ouer those first 70. Thus far the Talmud. Whereby Galatinus gathereth, that in the Councel that con∣demned CHRIST, there was the whole number of 71. which is true, if Herod had not before disanulled that societie. The greater Sanhedrin ordained the lesse; for those 70. ordained all the Sessīos of Iudges, which in other cities & places ruled the people: and to this Court of the 70. in Ierusalem they were all subiect. The place where they sate was called Gazith, that is, Carued, whereof this Court had the name (as the Star∣chamber with vs.) Other Courts or houses of Iudgement, they had diuers, of the 23. One of thē sate in the gate of the mountain of the Temple: another in the gate of the Court: others in euery city. And when there was a cōtrouersie, it was first brought to that city or towne, & so to the rest, if occasion required (in order) to that in the gate of the Mount, after to that in the Court-gate, & last to the Gazith consistory, in which they sate frō morning till night. But on Sabbaths & solemn daies they sate on the wal. But when Herod obtained the Scepter, he slew Hircanus and his son Antigonus, which had been King and Priest, and also all of the seed royall, and burnt the Gene∣alogies of their Kings: and further to stablish his throne in bloud, hee killed the Scribes and Doctors of the Law, and caused all the Sanhedrin to bee done to death. Because the Rabbanan (they are the words of the Talmud) had said accor∣ding to Deut.17. From among thy brethren thoushalt set a King ouer thee: he slew the Rabbanan or Masters, reseruing onely Baba, the son of Bota, whose eyes he after put out. And therefore the Sanhedrin perished: for, as is said, fiue, or at least after R. Ismael,
three were necessary to the ordination by the imposition of hands. But there were by Herods permission other Iudges instituted to be vnder the King, like the former Colledge, but had no authoritie of sentence in waightie and criminall causes: and therefore they said to Pilate, it is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death. And then for salfe sentence pronounced against CHRIST, they were expelled from the Consisto∣rie Gazith, fortie yeares before the destruction of the Temple, and afterwards, by the commandement of the Romans, were all flaine. They being expelled Gazith, held their Consistorie at Hamith, another place in Ierusalem but, saith R. Abdimi, with the place they lost their power in criminall iudgements; which might not be giuen but in Gazith. So do the Rabbines interprete the words; Deut.17.10. According to the words which they of that place shew thee, thou shalt do. Thus much out of Galatinus. The word Sanhedrin, saith Drusius, Quaest. Heb. lib 2. signifieth not the iudgements (as some mistake) but the Iudges, the seuentie Senators of the great Court at Ierusalem, called in the new Testament, Elders, Match. 16 21. Now concerning the Iewish Excommunications, the same Author Quaest.Heb.lib.1. &2. hath obser∣ued, that the Iewes had three kinds and degrees of Excommunications, Niddui, He∣rem, Samatha the first signifieth a Remouing; the second, Anathema; the third, the same which the Apostle calleth Maran-atha: By the first they are made (of which is an example, Genes.4.4) excommunicated from the Ecclesiasticall assem∣blies: and if they did not amend, they were excommunicated with a greater curse, or Anathema: and if they persisted obstinate, they did Samatize them. The word Ana∣thema is sometimes taken generally, but heere, for a particular kind. Maran-atha, signifieth the LORD commeth; and so doth Sem-atha. For by Sem, and more em∣phatically, Hassem they vsed to signifie the name, meaning that Tetragrammaton and ineffable name of God, Iehoua. It may also be compounded of Sama, after the Chaldee forme; or of Sam and mitha, which signifieth, There is death. Some Authors ascribe this to the institution of Henoch: which they gather out of Iude 14. CHAP III. Of the Religious places of the Israelites. IN the discouery of their ancient Religion, it seemeth fittest to discourse first of places, secondly of times, thirdly, of Rites, fourthly of Per∣sons consecrated to Religion. And first, of the first. Neither were the first men, Hosplnian.de Templis cap.1. nor first Hebrewes, very religious in this point of dedi∣cating places to religion; as appeareth in Histories both holy and prophane: and if for some vision, made vnto them in some places, they did for a time hallow the same with Altars, and Sacrifices: yet neither were they alway, or onely thus esteemed. But He, whose is the earth and all that therein is, did by his law appoint, as it were, a place of his residence amongst these, whom he had chosen for his owne people: and commanded them to erect a Tabernacle in the wildernesse, fitting that their peregrination. Afterward Salomon built him a house in Ierusalem: which therefore is called the holy Citie and the Citie of the great King. The Tabernacle (a moueable Temple that might bee taken asunder, and ioyned together againe) was, by Gods commandement, erected in the wildernesse, in the same manner, and of the same matter, which God had both commanded and shewed to Moses in the Mount; the matter and forme whereof, with all that thereunto appertained; the Arke, the Candlesticke, the Altar, &c. in the booke of Eoeodus are liuely declared. It was after (as we reade in the booke of Iosh.3.14. 15. Ioshua with great solem∣nitie carried miraculously thorow Iordan, by the Leuites deputed to that seruice: and, after their conquest of the Countrey, os.18.1. placed in Shilo, a Citie of Ephraim. There did Ioshua diuide the Land to her new conquerours: there were their solemne assemblies for state and religion. In the time of Helt they remoued the Arke from the Tabernacle into the armie, which they had gathered against the Philistims;
of whom the Arke was taken. The Tabernacle, in the time of Saul, was carried to Nob, and, in the time of Dauid, to Gibeon, where Salomon offered a thousand burnt offerings. The Philistims forced by Diuine iudgements, sent backe the Arke, receiued by the Bethsamites, curious to their cost, it was after placed in Kiriath-Iarim, in the house of Aminadab, next of Obed-Edam, and then by Dauid in the place, which he had fitted for the same in Ierusalem; whence it was remoued into the Temple, which Salomon had built: where it was till the time of the deportation: in which time 2.Maccb.2.5. it was hidden by Ieremie the Prophet. But that Author is beholden to the Councell of Trent for his credit, the Iewes themselues in that point, not beleeuing him; R. Samuel in lib. Sanhedrim. Hierosol. cap. Ellu hen baggol. Pet. Galatin. l.4. Genebrard. lu Chron. who affirme, that the second Temple came short of the former, by the want of the fire from heauen, of the Arke, of the Vrim and Thummim, of the succession of Prophets, and the glorie of God betweene the Cherubims. The Temple was built on Mount Moriah by Salomon, according to the I. Chron. 28. 11.12. paterne, which he had receiued of Dauid: to which worke he had gathered a greater masse of wealth, then easily we shall reade of in the Persian, Greeke, Roman, or any other Chri∣stian, Turkish, or Heathen Empire; I.Chron.22. 14. namely, 100000. talents of gold; 1000000. ta∣lents of siluer, and afterward 3000, talents of gold, and 7000. talents of siluer: to which was added, by the offerings of the Princes, 10000. talents of siluer, and more then 5000. talents of gold, besides iewels, and brasse, and iron, without weight, with Cedars and stones without number. The gold alone amounteth after the common computation of the common talent, at 6000. crownes, to sixe hundred fortie eight millions of crownes, and vpwards; the siluer to about the same summe. This beautifull frame I should deforme with my description, if (after a double narration of all the parts; forme, and contents thereof in the Historie of the Bible) I should recite the particulars. This Temple, fleeced by some, repaired by others, con∣tinued in varietie of state, till the sacking and ruine of it, together with the Citie by Nabuchodonosor. And after their returne, by the edict of Cyrus, and other the Persian Kings, it was rebuilded (but farre inferiour in glorie) in the space, as the Iewes say, Ioh. 2.20. vnto Christ, of six and fortie yeares: after others it was longer in hand, by reason of impediments from their cauilling, and malicious neighbours. This second Temple ha∣uing receiued accesse of magnificence in succession of times, was spoiled and polluted vnder Antiochus, who dedicated the same to Iupiter Olympius; but being freed and dedicated anew by Maccabaeus, it recouered great part of the former beautie; till as Ios.Antiq. lib. 12. Iosipp. debel Iud. Iosephus saith, and his abbreuiator Iosippus, it was pulled downe by Herod, and built anew. Herein both that allegation of the Iewes of sixe and fortie yeares, is against this assertion of Iosephus, and the Historie also of Hegesippus Egesip. lib. I. who reporteth that he only compassed the circuit about the Temple with a wall, and beautified the same with costly buildings, erected from the foundation the porches about the Sanctuarie, and fortified it with the castle Antonia. Chrysostome Chrysostom. in Ican. hom.22. vnderstands those words, of the Iewes, Forty and sixe yeares was this Temple a building, of the Herodian, Temple: and herein Hospinian. de Tem. cap.3. Caesar Baron. To.1. Annal. An.31. Hospinian, and the great Car∣dinall Baronius follow him: accounting exclusiuely from the eighteenth yeare of He∣rods reigne, which Functins reckoneth A. M. 3947. to the yeare 3992. in which Iohn Baptised, and CHRIST vttered these words: in all which they coniecture that somewhat was still a doing about the new building thereof, although the principall part thereof was performed and finished by Herod in eight yeares. This they gather by Iosephus his owne testimonie, that the building continued till the time of Nero, and in an other place, where he affirmeth that the East porch, which Luke cals Act.5. 12. Sa∣lomons porch, was still remaining of the ancient building, in the dayes of Nero, and elsewhere, that Herod repaired the Temple. Ies. de bells Iud.lib.1.c.16. Iosephus is therefore herein contrarie to the truth, and himselfe. Neither doe the Iewes in the Talmud speake of any third Temple: nor can the Prophecie of Hag.2.10. Haggaus bee fulfilled, that the glorie of the se∣cond Temple should exceed the glorie of the former; if CHRIST (of whose comming it is interpreted) had not by his presence, preaching, and miracles, not onely supplied the defects (before mentioned) but made it surmount the other in effects of Maiestie
and glorie. And the zeale vnto this testimonie, not the meanest which the Christian Veritie Morn. deve∣rit.Christ. Relig vrgeth against the Iewish Incredulitie and Apostasie, which is necessarily demonstrated and euinced, whiles yet they continue their vaine hopes of a Messias, so many Ages after the desolation of that Temple whereof Aggee prophecied, hath caused me to vse so many words in this matter. But to satisfie the fancies of great men, their great workes are commonly made greater: For howsoeuer it was very great in it selfe, that Herod should haue, eight yeares together, many workemen at worke (which Iosephus numbreth for some part of the time tenne thousand and a thousand Priests) yet sustaining, no doubt, some intermission after his time, either wholly, or in part, it could not be so great as to haue accomplished it wholly from the foundation, wherein Salomon spent seuen yeares: and besides, what any of the naturall Israelites performed in this worke, hee imployed an hun∣dred three and fiftie thousand and sixe hundred workemen of the Strangers or Fo∣rainers found in the Countrey. And whereas the second Temple was but halfe the height of the former, perhaps it is true, that (according to Iosephus) he perfected it to that height of an hundred and twentie cubites, whereof twentie cubites sanke downe in the setling of the foundations. It was builded by Herod of white stones fiue and twentie cubites long, eight thicke, and twelue broad. He that would fur∣ther reade the particulars, let him haue recourse to Iosephus in his fifteenth booke of Antiquities. This Temple was burned by Titus, in the sacke of the Citie, the same day that before it had beene fired by the Chaldaeans. Adrian the Emperour Dion Nicaeud in Adriano. did after destroy the Reliques thereof, that a stone was not left vpon a stone, and there, in the same place, dedicated another Temple to Iupiter, that former being ouer∣whelmed with earth. Iulian gaue leaue to the Iewes to reedifie the Temple, in des∣pight of Christian Religion, and contributed frankely thereto: but Ammianus Marcellinus Amm. Mar∣cellinus, lib. 23. , a Heathen Writer, witnesseth, That fire issued out of the Earth, Metuendi slammaruns globi prope sun∣damenta crobris assultibus erum∣pentes, secere lo∣cum exustis ali∣quoties operan∣tib, inaccessum. and burnt both worke and workemen: when as an Earthquake (which had before, sayth Sozomen. li. 5. Sozomen, killed a great many, in the very attempting of this Worke) could not deterre them from proceeding in their purpose: and Crosses, miraculously fallen on the garments of many, did both teach them to forsake their Iudaisme, and to be∣come Christians. Chrysostome Chrys. hom.3. contra Iudeos. mentioneth this, and saith, that vnder Adrian the Iewes sought to recouer their libertie, and lost their Countrey, Vnder Constantine they attempted the like, who therefore cut off their eares, and branded their bodies for rebels, as the elder of you (saith he to his Auditors) do know. And in our dayes, about twentie yeares since, Iulian the Emperour was at great expences, appointed officers, sent for worke-men from all places, thinking to frustrate CHRISTS Prophecie concerning the Temple, and to bring the Iewes to Idolatrie. But so soone as they had attempted this businesse, and bared the foundation, had drawne forth the earth, and were now readie to begin their building; a fire burst forth from the foundations, and burnt ma∣ny, which caused them to cease. And if you now go to Ierusalem, you may see the foundations naked: Hereof we all are witnesses. Neither did this happen vnder Chri∣stian Emperours, lest any should impute it to the Christians, but vnder an Ethnike, when Christianitie was persecuted. Thus much in effect, Chrysostome. Gregorie Na∣zianzen Greg. Naz. orat.1. in Iulian. also testifieth the same, affirming that the Earth (as it were taking a Vomit from the Diuine hand) spued out the stones, which yet till this day had continued therein, and dispersed them to the great damage of the neighbour buildings. Other holy places they had which the Scripture mentioneth as high places, which were high hils, or other open and loftie places, shaded for the most part with Trees: the Prophets inuey against them, and Deut.12.3. they were commanded to be destroyed, toge∣ther with the Groues: some yet were permitted, either by extraordinarie commaund for a time, as to Gedeon Ind.6.24. and to Manoab Iud.13.19. ; or because of the Tabernaclent Gibeon, or of the Arke at Ierusalem. The not reforming this toleration of high places is rec∣koned as an eclipse of Iehoshaphats and Asas glorie; which Ezekiuh and Iosiah quite remoued and polluted. These high and open places, it seemeth, were consecrated, as
fitting to the celestiall bodies; to which, and to Baal (who is interpreted the Sunne) they vsed for the most part on them to sacrifice. They had also their Houses and Tem∣ples for Baal, in Israel and Iuda; and Dan and Bethel were by Ieroboam dedicated to his Aegyptian Idolatrie: and Gilgal was a place of request in this kinde. Salomon also built Temples or Houses for his idolatrous wiues. And to reckon euery particular in this kinde were a worke endlesse: in the 2.Reg.17. & 23. and other places ynough is of them recorded. Two other Temples were erected of some reputation: one by Sanballat at Sama∣ria, on Mount Garizin, by licence obtained of Alexander the Great, whose part he followed, rebelling against Darius his true Lord. The occasion was, because Ma∣nasses, brother of Iaddi the High Priest, had married, contrarie to GODS Law, Ni∣caso Ios.Ant.l.11. daughter of Sanballat, and was forced either to leaue his Priestly Function or Heathenish bed. Whereupon Sanballat, hauing obtained licence to build that Tem∣ple aforesaid, constituted him the high Priest thereof, many other Priests for the like fault, resorting thither to him. But of these Samaritans we shall haue fitter occasion to say more when we come to handle their Sects. Ptolomaeus Philometor Ios.Ant.l.13. 6. abouesaid, graunted licence to Onias (the sonne of the high Priest Onias, whom Antiochus had slaine) who for the same cause had here shrowded himselfe, to build a Temple, induced herevnto by a false interpretation of the prophecie of Esay, Esay 19.19 at Leontopolis, in the shire, as I may terme it, or nomus of Heliopolis: hauing Priests and Leuites ministring therein, and other things answe∣ring in some sort to that of Ierusalem. When the Temple of Ierusalem was burnt by Titus, this Temple was shut vp also of Lupus, the Deputy, three hundred and thirtie yeares after it had been builded: and after by his successour Paulinus vtterly dispoi∣led both of the wealth and the religion. The Citie was called of Onias, Onion. Ios.l.7.c.30. de Bel.Iud. It had a Tower and an Altar like that of Ierusalem, but in steade of a candlesticke, a lampe of golde hanging on a chaine of golde, enriched by the king with large re∣uenues. Synagogues the Iewes had many, both in Ierusalem where are said to haue been foure hundred and fourescore, and in all cities of Iudea, and among the Gentiles where the Iewes were dispersed. When they first began to be builded, is vncertaine. Cornelius Betramus thinketh, That the eight and fortie Cities of the Leuites had their fit places for Assemblies, whence Synagogues had beginning. Car.Sig.l.2.c.8 Sigonius coniectu∣reth, That their Babylonian exile ministred occasion to them to helpe themselues with these Houses of Prayer and Instruction. The word Synagogue Erastus de excommunicat. Thesis. is taken both for the Assemblies, whether in this place, or out of it, and for the Place it selfe; ha∣uing a ciuill as well as a religious vse. And these Synagogues they haue in the places of their dispersion vnto this day. The order they obserued in their Synagogues was this: they disputed and preached sitting; Ambrosin.1.Cor.14. the Elders sat in Chaires which were set in order, of which CHRIST sayth, They loue the chiefe Seats in Synagogues: those of meaner sort sate in Seates, and the meanest of all on the floore vpon Mats. The Synagogue was gouerned by the Scribes, and the chiefe of them called Archisynagogus, resembling the High Priest and the inferior Priests in the Temple. Besides these Temples and Houses consecrated to GOD, Ambition, the Ape of Deuotion, founded some of other nature. Herod the Great erected a sumptuous Tem∣ple and Citie in the honour of Caesar, which sometime had beene called Stratonis tur∣ris. and after Caesarea. The Temple of Caesar, was conspicuous to them which sayled farre off in the Sea, and there in were two Statues, one of Rome, the other of Caesar. The sumptuousnesse of Herods ambition in this Citie, Temple, Theater, and Amphi∣theater, &c. Iosephus amply describeth. Ant.l.15.13 He built another Temple at Pahiuni, the fountaine of Iordan, in honour of Caesar; and least this should stirre vp the peoples hearts against him to see him thus deuoutly prophane and prophanely deuout, he re∣mitted to them the third part of the tributes. Hee consecrated Gaines, after the like Heathenish solemnitie, in honour of Caesar. to be celebrated euery fift yeare at Caesarea. He built also the Pythian Temple at Rhodes of his owne cost. He gaue yearely
reuenue to the Olympian Games, for maintenance of the Sacrifices and solemnitie thereof: Quis in rapacitate auarior? Quis in largitione effusior? He robbed his owne to enrich (or rather vainely to lauish out on) others. He spared not the sepulchres of the dead. For the Sepulchre of Dauid had lent before to Hyrcanus three thousand talents of siluer; which filled him with hope of the like spoyle: and entring it with his choice friends, he found no money but precious clothes; and whiles he in a couetous curio∣sitie searched further, he lost two of his companie, by flame (as fame went) breaking out vpon them. Hereupon he left the place, and, in recompence, in the entrie of the Sepulchre, built a monument of white Marble. He built also Ios.de Bell. Iud.l.1.c.16. Sebaste in the Region of Samaria, wherein he erected a Temple, and dedicated a Court of three furlongs and a halfe of ground before it, to Caesar. Thus Caesar was made a God by him, who would not allow CHRIST a place among men, but, that he might kill him, spared not the infants of Bethleem, no not his owne sonne amongst the rest, as this his GOD iested of him Macrob. Sa∣turn.l.2. , saying, That he had rather be He∣rods Hogge then his Sonne. For his Iewish deuotion prohibited him to deale with Swine, but not Religion, not Reason, not Nature could protect those innocents from slaughter. CHAP. IIII. Of the Iewish Computation of Time, and of their Festiuall daies. THe day amongst the Iewes was (as amongst vs) Naturall and Artifici∣all: this from Sunne-rising to Sunne-setting, to which is opposed Night, the time of the Sunnes absence from our Hemisphere: that comprehended both these, called of the Greekes  contai∣ning one whole reuolution of the Sunnes motion to the same point of the Horizon or Meridian, in 24. houres. This Plin.l.2.c.77. Fabrit.Paduani Catena temp.an.28. Scal.de Emend. Temp.l.1. Naturall day the Ba∣bylonians began at the rising of the Sunne, the Athenians at the setting, the Vmbri∣ans (as the Astrologians) at Noone, the Aegyptians and Roman Priests at Midnight, The Iewes agreed in their reckoning with the Athenians, as did the Galls in Caes.Com.l.6. Caesars time, reporting Pluto to be the Author of their Nation: and some reliques hereof is in our naming of time by a seuen-night and a fortnight; although otherwise we rec∣kon the day betweene two midnights. The most naturall computation of this natu∣rall day is to follow that order of Nature, wherein darknesse had the prioritie of time, Gen.1.5. and the euening and the morning were made one day, or the first day: which (sayth Hos∣pinian Hospinian de fest.Ethnic.l.1.1. ) the Italian and Bohemian Clockes doe yet obserue. The day was not diui∣ded of the first Hebrewes (before the Babylonian Captiuitie) into houres, but was di∣stinguished by Vigiliae, or Watches, of which they had foure; the first began at eue∣ning, the second at midnight, the third in the morning, the fourth at noone. Neither is there any Hebrew word signifying an houre; although some interprete the degrees of the Dyall of Ahaz Esa.38.8. to be houres; some (as Tremellius) halfe houres. Afterwards it was diuided into houres, 12. in the night, and as many in the day; not equall as ours, but longer or shorter, according to so many equall portions of the day or night: so that with them the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, houre was answerable with our houres of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, if we consider them in the Aequinoctiall, o∣therwise they differed from our equall houres more or lesse, according to the vnequall lengthning or shortning of the dayes, but so, that an easie capacitie may conceiue the proportion. These houres sometimes they reduced into foure, the first containing the 1, 2, 3, or with vs the 7, 8, 9, houres: the second the 4, 5, 6, or after our reckoning 10, 11, 12, of the clocke, and so forwards. This was the Ecclesiasticall Computation, ac∣cording to the times of Prayers and Sacrifices, imitated still in the Church of Rome in their Canonicall houres. Thus is Marke reconciled to himselfe and the other Euan∣gelists, Mark.15.25. & 33. in relating the time of CHRISTS Passion, the first calling it the third houre
when they crucified him, or led him to be crucified, whereas Iohn sayth, That it was about Ioh.19. the sixt houre when Pilate deliuered him. Thus may the parable of the Labo∣rers in the Vineyard be vnderstood, Matth. 20. and other places of Scripture. The night also was diuided into foure Watches, each containing three houres, accor∣dingly. Seuen dayes were a Septimana, res omnibus quidem Orientis populis ab vltima vsque Antiquitate vsi∣tata: nobis autē Europaeis vix tandē ost Chri∣stian smum re∣ceptae. Scal. de Emend. T.l.1. weeke, whereof the seuenth was called the Sabbath; others had no peculiar name, but were called the first day of the weeke, or the first day of (or after) the Sabbath, and so of the rest. Their moneths, as with vs and the Grecians, tooke their name of the Moone, and with them also their measure, reckoning the order of their dayes according to the age of the Moone, and by courses they contained, one 30. dayes, the next 29, and therefore were constrained euerie second or third yeare to intercale, or adde, as in a Leape-yeare, one moneth of 22. dayes, and in euerie fourth yeare of 23. dayes. This they called Vcadar, that is, And-Adar, or Adar doubled. Veadar, because it followed the 12. moneth Adar, for the supply of 10. dayes, 21. houres, and 204. scruples, which the 12. moneths of the Moone came short of the yeare of the Sunne. And this they were forced to doe for the obseruation of the Passeouer, and their other Feasts. Ar. Montanus in his Daniel, or 9 booke of Iewish Anti∣quities saith, That the aun∣cient yeare had twelue moneths, as appeareth by the historie of Noah: but those moneths had no proper names, but of their order, the first, second, third moneth, &c. Those names which after they were knowne by, were Chal∣dean. Before their Babylonian thraldome, foure onely of these moneths were knowne by proper names; the first cal∣led Ethauim, the second Bul, the seuenth, which after was made the first, Abib; the eight Zif: but afterwards the rest receiued names, which had beene before distinguished onely by order, and the former names also were altered; that being reckoned the first moneth of the yeare, in which befell the 15. day of the Moone after the Aequinoctiall Vernall, and their names follow, Nisan, Iar, Sivan, Thamuz, Ab, Elul, Thischri, Mar∣cheschvan, Cisleu, Tebeth, Schebath, Adar. The Hebrew yeare, before Moses, began H spinian, Ar. Montanus in his Daniel, and others, begin the world in Autumne; but our English Church and Ioseph Scalliger suppose the world was cre∣ated in the E∣quinoctial ver∣nall. And of this opinion is R Iehosua, Basil, Ambrose, Hie∣rome, Augustine, Bed , Isidorus, Damascen, and other later Di∣uines & Astro∣nomers, whose reasons Hospi∣nian laboureth to confute, & adhuc sub Iudice his est. at the new Moone next after the Autum∣nall Aequinoctiall, that being supposed by some to be the time wherein the World was first created, euerie Plant and Tree hauing the fruit and seed ripe: and this recko∣ning of the yeare, in ciuile affaires, is obserued of the Iewes vnto this day: and from hence they began their Iubilee and seuenth Sabbaticall yeare, least otherwise they should haue lost two yeares profits, not reaping the fruit of the old yeare, nor sowing in the next. Their Ecclesiasticall or festiuall yeare began at the Spring, as wee haue said asore, by the commaundement of GOD, at and in remembrance of their depar∣ture out of Aegypt at the same time, Exod. 12. as with vs wee haue an Ecclesiasticall yeare moueable, according to the fall of Easter, differing from the Ciuill beginning at our Lady, as with others at Christmasse or New-yeares day. Ios.Scal.de Emend, Temp.lib.4. Scaliger thus obserueth concerning the Iewish yeare. The Iewes (sayth he) vse a double reckoning of their yeare; one after the course of the Moone, the other after the Tekupha's or course of the Sunne. Tekupha Tekupha is the fourth part of a yeare. aunciently was that moment in which the passed yeare ended, and the following began. But the later Iewes diuided the yeare of the Sunne into foure equall parts, each whereof consisted of 91. dayes, 7. houres ½. And they diuide the said yeare into 12. equall parts, each containing dayes 30. houres, 10. 30. They begin at the fifteenth of Aprill, moued by the authoritie of R. Samuel an ancient Criticke, who ascribed the first Tekupha to that moneth which be∣fore they began in Autumne: the reason was, because at that time Moses led the Israe∣lites out of Aegypt. The moderne Iewes are so superstitious in the obseruation of their Tekupha's, that they esteeme it danger of life to alter their reckoning of them. They also attribute to each of them his proper element, as to the Tekupha Tamuz (the Summer Solstice) the Fire; and he which should drinke or eat in the moment of that Tekupha, they thinke should be taken with a burning feauer. Tekupha Nisan is on the fifteenth of Aprill, Tekupha Tamuz on the fifteenth of Iuly, Tekupha Tisrs on the foureteenth of October, Tekupha Tebeth on the foureteenth of Ianuarie. In times pas∣sed they obserued superstitiously the beginnings of euerie moneth, thinking, that then the Sunne entred into that Signe which was attributed to that moneth. Now they on∣ly obserue the foure Tropicall signes. Such is their folly, as though now the entrance of Aries were not more then fiue and thirtie dayes before the Tekupha of Moses. But
their leaden braines know not what Tekupha is, nor why, nor when it was instituted. So much Scaliger. If the new Moone happened after noone, then the moueth and their New-Moone Feast began the next day, and the yeare likewise, which began at the New Moone. Although, in regard of vse, some dayes were more holy then other, yet had euery day appointed Sacrifices Exod.29.38. Num.28. Leu.23. morning and euening. Their Feasts were either weekely, of which was the Sabbath; or monethly, euerie New Moone; or yearely, of which were the Easter or Passeouer, Pentecost or Whitson∣tide, the Feast of Tabernacles: These were chiefe, to which were added the Feast of Trumpets, of Expiation, and (as some accompt) of the Great Congregation At the end of the Feast of Tabernac. . To these we may reckon the seuenth yeares Sabbath, and the yeare of Iubilee. These Feasts GOD had prescribed to them, commaunding, that in those three principall Feasts e∣uerie male (as the Iewes interpreted it, that were cleane, and sound, and from twentie yeares of their age to fiftie) should appeare there where the Tabernacle or Temple was, with their offerings, as one great Parish. Deut. 16. hereby to retaine an vnitie in diuine worship, and a greater solemnitie, with encrease of ioy and charitie; being bet∣ter confirmed in that Truth, which they here saw to be the same which at home they had learned, and also better strengthened against the errors of the Heathen and idolatrous Feasts of Deuils. To these were after added vpon occasions, by the Church of the Iewes, their foure Fasts, in memorie of their calamities receiued from the Chaldaeans, their Feast of Lotts, of Dedication, and others, as shall follow in their order. They began to celebrate their Feasts at Euen: so Moses is commaunded, Leu.23.32. From Euen to Euen shall ye celebrate your Sabbath: imitated in the Christian Euensongs on holy Euens: yet the Christian Sabbath is by some supposed to begin in the morning, because CHRIST did rise at that time. CHAP. V. Of the Festiuall dayes instituted by GOD in the Law. AS they were enioyned to offer a Lambe in the morning, and another in the euening euery day, with other Prayers, Prayses, and Rites: so had the Sabbath a double honour in that kinde, and was wholly se∣questred and sanctified to religious duties. Which howsoeuer it was ceremoniall, in regard of that seuenth day designed, of the Rites therein prescribed, of that rigid and strait obseruation exacted, of the particular workes prohibited, and of the deadly penaltie annexed, yet are we to thinke, that the eternall LORD, who hath all times in his hand, had, before this, se∣lected some Time proper to his Seruice, which in the abrogation of ceremonies See lib.1.c.4. Le∣gall, is in Morall and Christian dutie to be obserued to the end of the World: euen as from the beginning of the World he had sanctified the seuenth day to himselfe, and in the Morall Law (giuen not by Moses to the Iewes, but by GOD himselfe, as to all creatures) is the remembrance of that sanctification vrged. Friuolous are their rea∣sons who would renew the Iewish Sabbath amongst Christians, tying and tyring vs in a more then Iewish seruitude, to obserue both the last and first dayes of the weeke, as some haue preached, and of the Aethiopian Churches is practised. Neither can I subscribe to those, who are so farre from paying two, that they acknowledge not the debt of one vpon diuine right, but onely in Ecclesiasticall courtesie, and in regard of the Churches meere constitution; and haue thereupon obtruded on many other dayes as religious respects or more, then on this (which yet the Apostles entitled in name and practise the LORDS day) with the same spirit whereby they haue equalled traditions to the holy Scriptures.
Thus Cardinall Tolet Tolet. In∣struct. lib.4. c.24,25. allowes on the LORDS day Iourneying, Hunting, Wor∣king, Buying, Selling, Fayres, Fencing, and other priuate and publike workes, by him mentioned: and sayth, a man is tied to sanctifie the Sabbath, but not to sanctifie it well: (a new kinde of distinction) the one is in hearing Masse, and ceasing from seruile workes; the well-doing it, in spirituall contemplations &c. Another Bellarm. de cultu sanct.l.3.c.10. Cardinall is as fast as he is loose, affirming, That other holy-dayes also binde the conscience, euen in cases void of contempt and scandale, as being truly more holy then other dayes, and a part of diuine worship, and not onely in respect of Order and Politie. But to returne to our Iewish Sabbath. Plutarch thought, that the Sabbath was deriued of Σαβὰζειν which signifieth, to keepe Reuell-rout, as was vsed in their Bacchanals of  which is interpreted Bacchus, or the sonne of Bacchus, as Coelius Rhodiginus Coel.Rhodig. Lect.Antiq.l.4.c.15. sheweth out of Amphitheus and Mnaseas; who is therefore of opinion, That Plutarch thought the Iewes on their Sabbaths worshipped Bac∣chus, because they did vse on that day to drinke somewhat more largely (a Sab∣batising too much by too many Christians imitated, which celebrate the same ra∣ther as a day of Bacchus, then the LORDS day. Apoc.1.10. ) Bacchus his Priests were called Sabbi, Plutarch. Sympos.lib 4. of this their reuelling and misse-rule. Such wide coniectures wee finde in others, whereas the Hebrewes call it Sabbath, of  which signifieth to rest, be∣cause of their vacation to diuine Offices, and not for idlenesse, or worse employ∣ments. And for this cause all the festiuall Solemnities in the Scripture E.20.12. are styled with this generall title and appellation, as times of rest from their wonted bodily seruices. Likewise their seuenth yeare was Sabbathicall Leuit.25. 2. , because of the rest from the labours of Tyllage. In those feasts also, which consisted of many dayes solem∣nitie, the first and last were Sabbaths Leuit.23. , in regard of the strictnesse of those dayes rest. Luke Luk.6.1. hath an obscure place, which hath much troubled Interpreters with the difficultie thereof,  our English reades it, The second Sabbath after the first. Isid.in Thom. Catena. I sidore sayth it was so called of the Pascha and Azyma comming together. Chrysostome thinkes (as Sigonius cites him) it was when the Car.Sigon.de Rep.Heb. l.3.c.13. New Moone fell on the Sabbath, and made a double Festiuall. Sigonius, when they kept their Passeouer in the second moneth. Stella in Luc. c.6. Stella takes it for Manipulus Frugum, alledging Iosephus his Author. Ambros. in Luc. Ambrose, for the Sabbath next after the first day of the Easter Solemnitie. Hospin. de fest. Iudeor.c.3. Hospinian, for the Octaues or last day of the same: Maldonat. in Matth.12. Maldonatus, for the Feast day of Pentecost, which was the second of the chiefe Feasts: But Ioseph Scaliger Scaliger.Can. Isag. l.3. sayth, That the second day of the Feast was called (being the sixteenth day of the moneth, called Ma∣nipulus Frugum) and the Sabbaths which fell betwixt that and Pentecost receiued their denomination in order from the same; Secundo-primum, secundo-secundum, &c. And hence doth Luke call that first Sabbath which fell after that  or second day of the Feast, . Of this wee shall haue occasion to say more when wee come to the Samaritans. Infra, cap.9. The name Sabbath is also taken for the Luc.18.12, bis in Sabbat. whole weeke. But I list not to stand on the diuers significations of the word. Ios. de Bell. Iud.l.7. c.24. Inter Arcas & Raphanaeas. Plin. l.31.c.2. in Iudaea. Iosephus and Plinie tell of a Riuer in Syria, in the Kingdome of Agrippa, called Sabbaticus, which on other dayes ranne full and swift, on the Sabbath rested from his course. Petrus Galatinus P. Galat. de Arcan.l.11.c.9. alledgeth the ceasing of this Sabbaticall streame for an argument of the abrogation of the Iewish Sabbath. The Iewes were superstitiously strict in the obseruation of their Sabbath: Ptolo∣mey without resistance captiuating their Citie and themselues by this aduantage, as did Pompey afterwards. And in the dayes of Matathias, father of Iudas Macca∣beus, a thousand were murthered without resistance, till that by him they were bet∣ter aduised: which appeared by the Pharisees, that cauilled at the plucking and rubbing of a few eares of Corne, by the hungrie Disciples, and at their Master for healing on that day, though by his word: Which their superstition, the Iew that fell into a Priuie at Maidenburg, 1270, on his Sabbath, and another at Tewskburie, 1220, (and were, the one by the Bishop of the Place, the other by the Earle of
Glocester constrained to abide the Christian Sabbath, whence on their owne they would not be freed) testified to the world by a stinking penance, and the later leauing also his stinking superstitious soule behinde to seale his deuotion. They added of their owne, fasting that day till Noone, their Sabbath dayes iourney, which was (saith S. Ie∣rome) In vita Iose∣phi. by the institution of Barachibas, Simcon and Hellis, (Rabbines) not aboue 2000. paces Dras. saith 2000, Cubites, his authors are the Chaldee paraphrast. Iarius. Throphil. Occumenius giueth the reason, because the Arke and Tabernacle did so farre goe before the people. or two miles. Thus did this holy ordinance, which God had instituted for the refreshing of their bodies, the instruction of their soules, and as a type of aeternall hap∣pinesse, vanish into a smoakie superstition amongst them. The sacrifices and accusto∣med rites of the Sabbath are mentioned. Num.28.&Leuit.23.& 24. Where we may reade, that the dayly burnt-offering, and meate-offering, and drinke-offering, were doubled on the Sabbath, and the shew-bread renewed, &c. The sanctification of dayes and times being a Hooker l.5. Ecclesiast.Polit. token of that thankefulnes and a part of that publike honour which we owe vnto God, he did not onely enioyne, by way of perpetuall homage, the sanctification of one day in seuen, which Gods immutable Lawe doth exact for euer, but did require also some other part of time with as strict exaction, but for lesse continuance; besides accepting that which being left arbitra∣rie to the Church, was by it consecrated voluntarily vnto like religious vses. Of the first of these (the Sabbath) we haue spoken: of the Mosaicall Feasts, the New∣Moones are next to be considered. The institution hereof we reade, Num.28. and the solemne sacrifice therein appointed: so to glorifie God, the Author of time and light, which the darkened conceipts of the heathens ascribed to the planets and bo∣dies coelestiall, calling the monethes by their names. Besides their sacrifices they banquetted on this day, as appeareth by 1.Sam.20.5. Dauid and Saul: Where the day after was festiuall also, either so to spend the surplusage of the former dayes sumptuous sacri∣fice, or for a farther pretext of religion and zeale, as Martyr P. Mart in 1.Sam. hath noted. Sigonius Sigon.de Rep: Heb.l.3.c.4. maketh these New-moone dayes to be profestos, that is such wherein they might la∣bour, the sacrificing times excepted: but those couetous penny-fathers seeme of an other minde. When Amos 8.5. (say they) will the New-moone bee gone that we may sell corne, and the Sabbath that wee may sellwheate: and Es. I. the Sabbaths and New-moones are reckoned together. Their Passeouer, called of them Poesach, so called of the Angels passingouer the Israe∣lites in the common destruction of the Aegyptian first born. For Poesach, the Grecians vse Pascha; of  to suffer, fitly in regard of the body of that shadow CHRIST himselfe, who 1.Cor.5.7. was our Paschall Lambe, in his suffering sacrificed for vs. The institution of this Feast is set down Exo. 12. as Hospiniax hath noted in the yeere after the creation of the world. 2447. Scaliger & Caluisius account 2453. Lydiat 2509. others otherwise. after the floud 791. after the promise made to Abram, 430. it was celebrated from the fifteenth to the one and twenty day of the moneth Abib or Nison, those two daies being more especially sanctified with a holy Conuocation and abstinence from worke, except the dressing of their meat: the other being obserued with vnleauened bread: and the fourteenth day being the Parascene, or preparation in the euening of which fourteenth day, as some men hold opiniō, after sun set in the twi-light, others in the fourth howre, or fourth part of the day, as containing three houres space, before the going downe of the Ios.de Bel.7.17. saith à nona vsque ad vndecimam hostias coedun. sun, the Paschal Lambe was slaine, about which time (the ninth houre) Christ, the true Pascha, yeelded vp the ghost. From which ninth hower the Iewes began their Vespera or Euening: and therefore it vvas inioyned them inter duas Vesperas, to kill the Passeouer. This Lambe or Kidde was chosen a male of a yeere olde, the tenth day of the moone, which they kept till the fourteenth day tied (after their traditions) to the foote of some bench or forme, so to minister occasion to their children, of questioning a∣bout it, to themselues of preparation and meditation, and to espie in this meane while, if any default were in the Lambe. It vvas first a priuate sacrifice to be perfor∣med in euery house, after in that place ouely where the Tabernacle or Temple was, they there dispersed by companies, according to Iosephus, not fewer then ten, somtime twenty, in a company; with Christ there were thirtie: and of these sacrifices and com∣panies in time of Cestins, were numbred 256500. so that reckoning the least num∣ber
there were ten times so many, besides those that by diseases or other manifold lets were not partakers thereof: and in regard of this Feast beeing assembled thither through Gods iust iudgement, their whole huge multitudes were couped or caged together in the walles of this Citie to destruction, vnder Titus. The bloud of the Lambe they were to receiue in a vessell, and to sprinkle the same with a bunch of Hysope on the doore postes, and to eate it in the night, which was the beginning of the fifteenth day, roast with fire, with sowre hearbes, and vn∣leauened bread, both the head, feete, and purtenance; girded, shod, with staues in their hands, in hast, standing, burning whatsoeuer was left of the same. There are that Hovinian. thinke, that after the eating the sacramentall Lambe, standing, they had other proui∣sion which they eat sitting, Lipsius. or after their manner of lying at table, in remembrance of their libertie, as appeareth by Iohns leaning on his breast, and Iudas his soppe at Christs Supper. They were in the euen of the fourteenth day to purge their houses of leauen, and that throughout the land, where the Lambe might not bee eaten. All the Israelites were enioyned this duty: and they which by occasion of iourneying or vn∣cleannesse could not now celebrate the Passeouer, were to obserue it the next mo∣neth. Num.9.. The day after, or second day of this Paschall Feast, they were to bring to the Priest a Gomer of the first-fruits of their corne, and a Lambe, with other duties for a burnt offering to the Lord: before which time they might not eate of the new yeares fruits, which at that time in those countries began to ripen, and so to acknowledge God the giuer thereof. Philo.Iud de vita.Mos.l.3. Philo saith, that each priuate man, which otherwise brought in his sacrifice to the Priest, sacrificed or slew this sacrifice with his owne hands: and elsewhere In decalog. he affirmeth the same. Eleazarus, Hospin. de fe∣stis. Iud.c.3. Maldonat. in Mat.26. or as other say the Synedrium, ordained 350. yeares before the birth of Christ, that the Passeouer should not bee solemnized on the second, fourth, or sixt day of the weeke: and therefore when it fell on the sixt day, which we call Friday, it was deferred to the seuenth, at the time of Christs Pas∣sion, and hee with his Disciples eate it the night before, according to the law of God. This Eleazarus ordained, that the Feast of Lots should not bee celebrated on the second, fourth, or seuenth: Or Pentecost on the third, fift, or seuenth: Or that of the Tabernacles on the first, fourth and sixt: Or the Fast of Expiation, on the first, third, or sixt: Or their New-yeares day, on the first, fourth, and sixt, which decree is extant in the booke of Gamaliel, Paules Mr. which they did superstitiously, to auoide two Sabbaths (in so strict a rest) together, and carrying boughes on the Sabbath, if that feast fell thereon, and on other such reasonlesse reasons, After this sixteenth day of the moneth, or second day of vnleauened bread, in which first of all sickle was thrust into the haruest, to offer the first fruits thereof vnto God, were numbred seuen intire weekes, and the next day which was the fiftieth, (accoun∣ting inclusiuely) was celebrated the Feast of Pentecost, receiuing his name of that rec∣koning of fifty: and Schefuoth, that is, of weekes, because of this reckoning of seuen weekes, it is called also the Feast of the haruest of the first fruits: Exod.23.16. the rites thereof are prescribed. Leu. 23. The institution was in respect of the lawe then giuen on Mount Sinai, and a type of that Euangelicall law, which Christ, hauing ascended vp on high, did write not in Tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart, when (at the same Act. 2.4. time) he gaue the holy Ghost to his Disciples, as a remembrance also of the author of their haruest-fruits and euery good gift. As the seuenth day in the weeke, so the seuenth moneth in the yeare, was in a great part festiuall: fittest for that purpose, as the fruits of the Earth being now inned. The first day of this moneth vvas, besides the ordinarie Kalendes or Festiuall New-moone, the Feast of Trumpets, in respect of that rite then obserued of soun∣ding Trumpets, being their New-yeares day, after the ciuill account: the institution is read Leu. 23. and Num. 29. Whether, as some of the Rabbines vvill haue it, for Isaacs deliuerance, that in remembrance of that Ramme, these Rams-horne trumpets should be sounded, or in regard of their warres, or in respect of that spirituall warre∣fare which continueth our whole life, or that this was so festiuall a moneth,
or the beginning of their yeare for ciuill accounts, and for the Sabbaticall and Iubilec∣yeares or for some other cause, let the wiser reader iudge. On the tenth day of this moneth was the Feast or Fast of Reconciliation or Expiation, a day of publike penance, fasting & afflicting themselues, described in Leu.16. through∣out the chapter, and chap. 23. wherein is liuely in that type shewed the office of IE∣SVS CHRIST, the eternall high Priest, who hath alone wrought our atonement, entered into the Holy place of heauen, and laide our finnes on the scape-Goate, bea∣ring them, and satisfying for them in his owne person on the Crosse, and by the sprink∣ling of his bloud sanctified vs for euer to GOD his Father. Paul. Heb.9. doth vnsold the mysterie of this dayes rites, wherein onely, the High Priest alone might enter into the holy place, and himselfe alone performe the other offices of Expiation. The Iewes thought, that this fasting & afflicting themselues was in respect of their Idolatry with the golden Calfe, and therefore it seemed, that in Theodorets Theodoret qu. 32.in Leuit. time they did not afflict themselues, but sported rather in obscene and profane manner. The sacrifices are set downe. Num.29.8.9.10.11. The next Feast was that of Tabernacles; in remembrance that howsoeuer they now dwelleu in strong Cities, goodly houses, &c yet their fathers liued in tents in the wildernes, where God by a cloud in the day time, and fire in the night, protected that people. It is expressed Leu. 23. Num.29 Deut.16. It was obserued from the fifteenth to the one and twentith, the first and last of them being (as at the Passeouer) more solemnely feastiuall, with abstinence from labour, and a generall Conuocation. They were the first day to take boughes & branches of trees, and to make therwith boothes, and to dwell in boothes seuen dayes. This was neglected from the time of Iosuah, till the dayes of Nehemiah, Nebem.8. when hee and Ezra solemnized this Feast seuen daies vvith boothes on their house-tops, and in their Courts and streets, with lectures euery day out of the Lawe, and solemne assembly on the eight day. The Hebrewes report that they made them bundles of that matter, which they carried, euery day of the seuen, vp & down in the morning before they might eate, wherevpon it was called the Feast of Palmes or Willowes. The seuenth day saith Paulus Fagius, Fag.in cap. Leu.23. they compassed the Al∣tar with these boughes seuen times, in remembrance of the fall of Iericho. Andrew Osiander, And Osiand. Annot. Harmon. Euan.l.3.c.36. affi meth that they vsed this carrying about boughes euery day, especially the seuenth, in which they obserued a kinde of procession or Letany singing, Ana Iehoua Hosanna ana Iehoua hatz elicha-na: first reckoning vp a great number of the names of God, then of his attributes: thirdly, of the things which they wish to be saued, then of themselues and other things interlacing euery particular of these with singing Ho∣sanna, like their Ora pro nobis in the Popish Letany. Then they alter it in another form, Pray redeeme the Vine of thy planting, Hosanna, &c. then in another, As thou sauedst the strong, in Egypt, when thou went'st out for their deliuerance, so Hosanna, &c. Then in a longer forme of prayers, with this foote of the song Hosanna: and lastly all rings Hosanna, Hosanna: and herevpon the later Iewes called this Feast Hosanna, as also those bundles of boughes: and although that the later Iewes haue now added much, 21 moth. 9. the Iewes of Italy differing from them of Germany, yet in Christs time the acclama∣tions of Hosanna, when he came riding on an Asse into Ierusalem, testifie some such obseruation then amongst them. The sacrifices of euery day are designed Num. 29. The first day, thirteene bullockes, the second, twelue, and euery day one lesse to the seuenth: in all 70 (as the Rabbines interpret it) according to the number of the 70. languages of the Nations, which shall be subdued to the Messias; and 98. Lambes, in respect of so many curses in the lawe, against the transgressing Israelites. The eight day was the Feast which they called Haaziph, Iob.7.37. Num, 29.35. and Azaereth, that is Colle∣ction, called also the great day of the Feast, in the two and twentith day of this mo∣neth Tisri. In this they were to Contribute to the continuall sacrifices, and publike thanksgiuing was made for the fruits of the Earth, and the first fruits of the later fruits were offered. Ieroboam Hospin.de fest. c.7. in an irreligious policie remoued the Feast of Tabernacles from the seuenth moneth to the eight, from Tisri to Marchesuan.
The seuenth yeare was appointed a Sabbaticall yeare wherein they were neither to so we nor to reape, but to leaue that which should voluntarily grow in their fieldes and yards to the poore, and secondly should not, exact debt of their brethren of the same Nation, but remit it. Deut. 15. Exod.23. Leu. 25. and the obseruation here of is expressed in the time of Nehemiah Nehem.10.31. After seuen times seuen yeares which make fortie nine, they were to reckon Iobel or yeare of Iubilee. Leu. 25. beginning on the day of Reconcilation: Wherein seruants were freed, debts remitted, possessions, that had beene alienated, returned, the lawe allowing no further sales, proclaimed with sound of a Trumpet of a Rammes-horne, and therefore called Iobel, which signifieth a Ramme, or Rammes-horne. Touching this yeare of Iubilee is much controuersie. The auncient Authors ac∣count it the fiftieth yeare. Scaliger Ios.Scal. Ani∣mad.in Euseb. pag.1. refuseth their authoritie herein. Many moderne writers hold the same opinion, as Hospin. de Temp. & de Fest. Iud. Hospinian, Melan. Chron. l.. Melancthon, Fabritius Fab. Pad. Ca∣tenatemp.annul. 40. Paduanus, &c. Caluis.Isagge c.23. Caluisius at large disputed this question against Crentzhemins and Bucholcerus, by diuers arguments proouing that the Iubilee was but fortie nine yeares complete, and that the fiftieth yeare was the first onwards of another Iubilee or Sabbath of yeares: Yet is this space reckoned by fiftie, as Ouid calles the Olympiad, quinquennis Olym∣pias; Aristophanes, Aristoph. in Pluto. & Ausonius Ansonius de ludis. affirming the like: and yet the Olympiade is but foure yeares complete, and reckoned from the fifth to the fift exclusiuely. Other∣wise they should haue had two Sabbaticall yeares togither, namely the forty ninth being the seuenth yeare, and the next which was the fiftieth yeare. As for the later writers, they might be deceiued by following the streame, and beguiled by the Po∣pish Iubilee, which Boniface the eight, before called Benedictus, (and yet neither vvas good sayer nor dooer) instituted, Anno 1300. to be obserued euery hundreth yeare: and Clement the sixt abridged to the fiftieth: as Auentinus, Trithemius, Cranizius, and other haue written. Whether they were heathenish in imitating the Ludi secula∣res, or Iewish in following the legall Iubilee: Certaine it is, Rome thereby becomes a rich mart, where the Apec. 18.11. Marchants of the Earth resort from all places of the Earth to buy heauen: and Babylon V.16. the great Citie is cloathed in fine linnen and purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearles, with the games of her wares giuing in exchange V.13. the soules of men washed from their sinnes; A thing more preci∣ous to CHRIST then his most precious bloud. But his pretended Vicars haue learned to effect it (the filling of their purse) with greater ease: deuout Pilgrims from all parts, visiting Saint Peters staires, whence they goe truely Saint Peters heires, Act.3.6. Sil∣uer and gold haue I none, and yet finde their pardons too cheape to be good. But to returne to our Pilgrimage, and to obsserue the obseruation of the Iewish Iubilee; This Feast was partly ciuill in regard of the poore, of the inheritances, of the Israe∣litish Families, specially that of the Messias, and of the computation of times, as a∣mongst the Greekes by Olympiads, and amongst the Romanes by Lustra and Indicti∣ons: partly also it was mysticall in regard of the Gospell of CHRIST, preaching li∣bertie and peace to the Conscience, the acceptable yeare of the Lord. And thus much of those Feasts which God himselfe instituted to this Nation: which how the Iewes of later times haue corrupted, and doe now superstitiously ob∣serue, instituting others also of their owne deuisings, shall bee handled in due place. Wee are next to speake of those Feasts, which vpon occasions they imposed vpon themselues before the comming of CHRIST: to which we will adde a briefe Ka∣lendar of all their Fasts and Feasts.
CHAP. VI. Of the Feasts and Fasts, which the Iewes instituted to themselues: with a Kalendar of their feasts and fasts through the yeare as they are now obserued. THE Prophet Zacharie, in his 7. and 8. Chapters mentioneth certaine fasting dayes which the Iewes by Ecclesiasticall Iniunction obserued. One in the tenth day of the tenth moneth, because that on that day Ie∣rusalem began to be besieged. 2. Reg. 24. A second fast was obser∣ued on the ninth day of the fourth moneth, in remembrance that then the Chaldeans entred the Citie. A third fast they held on the ninth day of the fift moneth in respect of the Citie and Temple burned on that day, First by Nabuchodonosor: Secondly by Titus, on the same day: which the Iewes doe yet obserue with strict penance, going barefoote and sit∣ting on the ground, reading some sad historie of the Bible, and the Lamentations of Ieremie, three times ouer. Their fourth fast they celebrated on the third day of the seuenth moneth, in re∣membrance of Godoliah slaine by Ismael, Ier.41.42. 2.Reg.vlt. To these are reckoned the fast of Ester, in the thirteenth day of Adar, their twelfth moneth; and on the seuenteenth day of the fourth moneth, in the remembrance of the Tables of the Lawe broken by Moses: the institution whereof seemeth to bee late, seeing the scripture doth not mention it. In this moneth the Aegyptians kept the feast or fast of their O∣firis, lamenting for him, which seemeth to be the same that is mentioned. Ezech. 8 Where women are said to mourne for Tamuz, whom Plutarch calleth Amuz, and from thence deriueth Iupiters title of Ammon. Of him was this fourth moneth called Tamuz. On the Ester.9.21. fourteenth and fifteenth dayes of Adar, they kept the feast of Phurim, or lots instituted in remembrance of that deliuerance from Haman; by the authoritie of Ioachim the high Priest, as Funccius relateth out of Philo. Anno M. 3463. Caluis.3477. Antonius Margarita a christned Iew, reporteth that on these dayes the Iewes read the historie of Ester, and so often as Haman is mentioned, they smite on their seates with their fistes and hammers, otherwise spending the time of this feast in Bacchanall riots and excesse. They had the feast also of wood-carrying called  mentioned by Ioseph.de bells Iud.l.2.c.17. Iosephus, in which the custome was for euery one to carry wood to the Temple to maintaine the fire of the Altar. The Feast of Dedication, otherwise called the Feast of Lights, and the institution thereof is largely described. Mac.4. in remembrance of the restitution of diuine wor∣ship and sacrifice in the Temple, which had been by Antiochus polluted, and sacred to Iupiter Olympius, all the seruices appointed by the law being abolished. By Iudas Ma∣cabeus, the Temple and Altar, and other holy instruments, were dedicated the same day three yeares after their first pollution, called therfore the Feast of Lights, as I thinke saith Ios.Ant.12.c.2. Iosephus, because so vnexpected a light shone forth vnto them. But Franciscus Iunius, in his Annotations vpon the Syrian translation of the tenth of Iohn, where this Feast is mentioned, alledgeth out of the Talmud an other cause as followeth. When on the 25 day of Cislen they entered into the Temple, they found not pure oyle, except in one little vessell, which contained sufficient for the lampes but one day, of vvhich oyle they lighted the lampes in order, which lasted eight daies, till they prested out of the Oliues cleane Oyle. And therefore the Wise-men of that time decreed, that yearely those eight dayes beginning at the 25. of Cisten should be dayes of ioy, and that euery one in the doores of their houses euery euening during those eight daies should light lampes, for declaration of that miracle, wherein they must not fast nor lament. Likewise I.Mac.13.is ordained festiuall the 23. day of Iar, for the expiation of the Tower of Ierusalem by Simon Mac.
Sigonius reckoneth also the feast of Iephta, in the end of the yeare, which yet is not like to haue continued in succeeding ages: and of the fire that wee haue mentioned in 2.Mac.1. and the Feast of Iudith, for killing Holofernes: and on the fourteenth day of Adar, for the victory against Nicanor, Ios.l. 12. Their later feasts I shall men∣tion, and declare their seuerall ceremonies, when wee come to speake of their later times, and of the present Iewish superstition. In the meane time I thinke it not amisse to set downe here out of Scaliger, a view or Kalendar of their monethes, with the feasts and fasts, as they are obserued therein at this day.Ios.Scal.Can.Isag.l.1.c.6.

CHAP. VII. Of the ancient Oblations, Gifts, and Sacrifices of the Iewes: and of their Priests, and persons Ecclesiasticall, and Religious. ALthough Moses doth handle this matter of their Rites and Sacrifices, and is herein seconded and interpreted by the succeeding Prophets, so fully, that it may seeme a powring of water into the Sea, to speake needlesly, or by our Discourse, to obscure, rather than illustrate, that which is so largely and plainely there expressed; yet because of that subiect which we haue in hand, I cannot altogether be silent (at least of the kinds and heads) referring the desirous Reader for his more perfect satisfacti∣on in particulars, to those cleerer propheticall fountaines. Their rites for time and place we haue already described: The next intended part of this Iewish relation shal be of their Oblations, which were either Gifts or Sacrifices. Their sacrifices were such oblations, wherein the thing offered was in whole or part consumed in diuine wor∣ship, for the most part by fire or shedding of bloud. These were of eight Car.Sigon.de Republ. Heb.l.4. sorts. Burnt-offerings, Meate-offerings, Peace-offerings, Sinne-offerings, Trespasse-offerings. the offerings of Consecration. Cleansing and Expiation. Philo de Sa∣crif. Philo reduceth them to three: Burnt, Peace and Sinne-offerings, according to the three causes of sacrificing; The worship of God the obtaining of good things, and freedome from euill. The Burnt-offerings were by fire consumed, the rites and manner here of is expres∣sed, Leuitic. 1. the fire was to be perpetuall on the Altar, being that which GOD miraculously sent from heauen to consume Aarons sacrifice; for neglecting which, and vsing other, his two sonnes Nadab and Abihu were stricken by a reuenging fire from GOD. The Meate offering was made of fine flower, without hony or leuen, and with oyle and incense on the altar, or frying panne, or ouen, or caldron, accor∣ding to the rites prescribed, Leuit. 2. partly sacred to the LORD by fire, the rest to be the Priests. The Peace-offerings are with their proper ceremonies enioyned Leu. 3. and 7; the fat and kidneys were to be burned on the Altar (the fat and bloud be∣ing vniuersally forbidden them for food) the breast and right shoulder was the Priests: the rest to the sacrificer, to bee eaten the first, or at furthest on the second day: or else on the third to be burnt with fire. The offering for sinnes of ignorance for the Priest, Prince, people or priuate man, is set downe Leu. 4. and 6. The Sinne-offe∣ring in case of contempt, where the sinne is committed against GOD & man willing∣ly, with the due maner therof is expressed, Leu. 6. To these were adioyned Prayers & praises, with musicall voices, and instruments, cymballs, violes, harpes, and trum∣pets resounding For he is good, for his mercy endureth for euer. The sixt kind of sacri∣fices was proper to the Priests at their consecration, recorded Le 6. 20. The seuenth mentioned sacrifice is of purification or cleansing, as of a woman after child-birth, Le. 12. or of a Leper 13. 14. or for vncleane issues of men and women, cha. 15. The eight is the sacrifice of Expiation or Reconciliation, on that festiuall or fasting day before spoken of, Le. 16. Hereunto may we adde the lights and the daily offring of incense, morning and euening, Exod. 20 on a golden altar, whereunto the Priests onely had accesse, with such perfume onely as is there prescribed. The Gifts, which we haue reckoned a second sort of Oblations, that were not as the former in whole, or in part consumed in their offering, but preserued whole and sound, were giuen, either according to the Law, or by Vow, or of free will. The Law prescribed First-fruits & Tithes, and the personall halfe-shekel The first-fruits of Man, of beasts, and of the fruits of the earth, the Lawe exacteth, Exod. 22. 23. and are as∣signed to the Priests, Num. 5 and 18. which, of men and vncleane beasts, were to be redeemed, of others to be sacrificed. Of Tithes. when we consider the assignement of them to the Tribe of Leui, we must so farre acknowledge them Leuiticall and Ce∣remoniall. But some, considering the paying of them to a Priest, so soon as we reade
of a Priest, 14 Gen.20 in Scripture, and that by the father of the faithfull (which the Apostle vr∣geth against Leuiticall Ceremonies, in that Leui himselfe in Abraham paied them) and his nephew Iacob vowed the payment thereof so soone as GOD should giue him whereof to pay Tithes; and that (the first times of the Christian Church ex∣cepted, wherein there was no such setled order for things of this and like nature) Tithes were paid to the Church, vntil the Arch-enemy of GOD and his Church, in his Antichristian supremacie robbed the Ministers of that due, which in GODS right they before held, impropriating the liuing of the Altar to them that liued not at the Altar but yet ordinarily leauing them to the Church (as they then accounted the Church): cannot so easily subscribe to that opinion perhaps more common then true, which disanull diuine right of the non-paying Tithes, as being then a Iewish and Leuiticall ceremonie. But I leaue the Reader to discusse this matter further, with Master Carlcton in his Treatise of that Argument; whose reasons, if they want weight in any mans iudgement, yet let the same consider an other supply, not at all fauoring of Iudaisme: namely, that M. Dowam. Tithes are due to Christian Ministers by Vow: Christian Common-weales, and Counsells hauing consecrated them to GOD and his Church: neither is it now time after the Vowes to inquire, and without Diuine dispensation to alter it, without satisfaction sufficient. But leauing this sore too ten∣der to be touched, and yet little touching and mouing some consciences pretended tender; let vs view the Tythes, as they then were, Iewish. In Leu. 27.30. is a decla∣ration of the Lords right, All Tythes are the Lords; and an assignation of the same, Numb. 18.21. Behold, I haue giuen the children of LFVI all the tenth &c S. Hicron.super Ezech. Hie∣rome reckons foure sorts of Tithes: first, that which the people paied to the Leuites: secondly, that which the Leuites hence paied to the Priests Num. 18.26. : Thirdly, that which they reserued for expence in their solemne feasts when they went to the Tabernacle or Temple Deut. 14.22. . The fourth was a third yeeres Tenth, which was then layd vp for the Leuite, and the poore amongst them Deut. 14.28. . The practise hereof Nehemiah restored in the reformation of Religion, Neha.10. when the First-fruits and Tenths were brought to the treasury or chambers of the house of GOD. Besides First-fruits and Tithes, they payed to the treasurie personall offerings, as Exod. 10.12. euery man payed halfe a shekel, which the Hebrews interpreted to be perpetuall for the maintenance of the Sacrifices; others temporary, then onely put in practise. As for that collection 2. Reg.12. made by Ioas for the repayring of the Temple, and that after by Nehem.ca.10. the circumstances shew much difference. This treasury, in regard of this Poll-money, grew very rich, as appeared in Is. Int. 14. 12. Crassus robbing the same of tenne thousand talents at one time, besides a great beame of gold, which Eleazarus the Treasurer, vpon Cressus his oath, (afterwards violated neuerthelesse) to redeeme the rest deliuered to him, weighing three hundred minae, euery mina being two pounds, two ounces, and a quarter Troy. Tully Cic.Pro Mu∣rena. and other Authors mention these Oblations of the Iewes to their treasury yearely. These Gifts and Offerings the Lawe exacted: they performed many other also, either of their Free-will or of Vow, otherwise little differing from the former, Leuit∣vltim. Many other Ceremonies of their meates, garments, fastings, trumpets, and in other cases, I hope I shall haue leaue to omit in this place, and remit him that would further know of them to the Scripture it selfe: hauing pointed out the principall. But by this is apparant, which Doctor Downam Downams Sermon of the Dignitie, &c. hath obserued, that all these be∣ing deliuered them in the Lords treasury, without their labour or cost, together with their 48. cities assigned them, amounted to a farre greater proportion for the main∣tenance of that small Tribe, then all the Bishoprickes, Benefices, Colledge-lands, or whatsoeuer other Ecclesiasticall indowments and profits in this land, although the prophane Ammonites or hypocriticall Cloysterers had neuer conspired to shaue off our 2.Sam.10. beards, and our garments by the buttocks, not leauing to D.Smith ser. Black-smith. couer our nakednes, or their shame: And yet how sicke is Ahab for Naboths vineyard? And would GOD we had no Iezabels to play the (too cunning) Physicians in this disease. Let me haue a little leaue to say no more then others (for the substance) in Bookes and Sermons
haue said already: although those Bellies to whom wee speake, haue no eares. The first stroke which wounded vs, and causeth vs still to halt, was from Rome, the mo∣ther of abhominations and rohoredomes. Here, as in the suburbs of Hell, were founded the Churches ruines: our Bulles of Bashan, (Abbey-lubbers, and Cloysterers) with the leaden hornes of those Roman Bulles haue pushed downe our Churches, (our Chauncells at least) and made them to fall into those Apoc. 18 2. Cages of vncleane Birds, the Popish Monasteries. Of nine thousand two hundred eighty and foure parishes in England, Camden Bri∣tan. Edit. vlt. after M. Camdens account, three thousand eight hundred fortie fiue were (it is properly termed) impropriated. And who knoweth whether those Appropria∣tions did not supplant these Supplanters, and dispropriate them of that which in a iuster proprietie was giuen them in their first foundations, for that three-fold main∣tenance of themseluaes, of learning, and of the poore: yea happily yet (if we obserue the course of Diuine Iustice) we may see many, whose former inheritances haue by the additions of these, as of a contagious garment, beene infected, and haue either died, or bin sicke at the least, of this plague. How fitly and fully doe those wordes of Ha∣bacuk Hab.2.9, 10, 11, 12. agree to the houses founded for religion, by this and like irreligion peruerted, and at last subuerted Vbi supra. They coueted an euill couetousnesse to their houses, they consulted shame to their owne houses, by destroying many people, and sinned against their owne soules. The stone hath cried out of the wall, and the beame out of the timber hath answered it, Woe vnto him that buildeth a towne with bloud, and erecteth a Citie by iniquite. Thus we see, the stones haue cried out of their walls indeede, and by their demolished heapes may receiue Labans name, Iegar sahadutha, the Gen.31.47. heape of witnesse, their ruines remaining testimonies of GODS iudgements. A violent streame (saith maister Camden Vbisupra. ) breaking through all obstacles, hath rushed out vpon the Ecclesiasticke state of this Land, and ouerwhelmed, to the Worlds wonder, and Englands griefe, the greatest part of the English Clergie, with their most beautifull buildings; and those riches which the Christian piety of the English had from the time of their first Christianity consecrated to GOD, were (as it were) in a moment dispersed, and (if I may so say) profaned. Let none traduce me as a troubler of Israel, and a traducer of our Law and State, which haue thus both changed & setled these things. I inueigh against Absoloms con∣spiracie, and Achitophels deuises, which were the troublers of Israel, and so disturbed the iust heart of righteous Dauid, that on the sodain hee a little forgat the exact rule: and commanded, Thon 2.Sam.19.29 and Ziba diuide the Lands. So (if loosers may haue leaue to speake) our Parliament (perhaps with some extasie of ioy, for remouing the sinks and stinckes of superstition) had in those busie times but negligent consideration of Mephibosheths right: and our Vicar-Mephibosheths, the Clergie then, did not much vrge it, yea we would still say of these our halting Zibaees, Let them take all, rather then wee should want our Lord and his Gospel, to come home to vs in peace. And in peace, let them rest which were Authors of this peace to vs; and let vs pray that a worse generation of vipers doe not arise, and that the Ioel 1.4. Canker-worme eate not what the Grashopper hath left, and the Caterpiller the residue of the Canker worme. I meane those Latron-patrons, and Patron-latrons, whereof these extend to the vtmost whatsoe∣uer might, and whatsoeuer colour of right, in Exemptions, Customes, Let me haue the like liberty to inueigh a∣gainst vices here, as Espen∣saeus was allow∣ed among the Papists, who speaking of the Romish proceedings, saith, Sedis A∣postolice summ iura, hoc est sum∣mae, inioriae, pri∣uilegia hoc est abusus, consue∣tudines, hoc est, corruptelae: I speake only a∣gainst abusers of law & right. Priuiled∣ges and prauileges, whereby euery Iohn-a-Stile shall intercept the Churches due, or by a weightier fee, force a composition, or wrangle out some broken Title, or break the necke of the Case with a Prohibition: the other hauing a trust committed, ma∣keth himselfe a bawd, and selleth his Church (which cost no meaner price then the bloud of CHRIST) for money. Oh Christ, ouerthrow the Tables of these Mony∣changers, and with some whippe driue them, scourge them out of thy Temple, which supplant thy plantations, and hinder the gaining of Soules for gaine. With∣stand these Balaams, which for Balaks blessing, care not what curse they bring vp∣on Israel, which present for presents, and scrape to maintaine their carnall liuing, out of our spirituall Liuings; to bestow on their Hawkes, their Hounds, their!
But whither hath this passion, or zeale (Truth I am sure) transported mee? True∣ly, the fixed Starres in our Westminster firmament (and may not I so call it, where is such a Starre-chamber, shining with the bright beames of Iustice?) I admire, and almost adore in silence: onely those wandering planets, which selfe-guiltinesse accuseth, doe I here accuse. And for these, and all the Churches enemies, Let GOD arise, and his ene∣mies, (or their enmitie) bee scattered, that there be no more such t.Reg.21. Ahabs, as I mentioned, which hauing more then enough, seeme to haue nothing, as long as Naboth hath something which they can long for: and that there bee no Nehem.13. Eliashibs, which shall prouide Tobias the Ammonite a Chamber in the house of the LORD: that neyther any abuse the profession of Lawe, directly; nor the possession of Patro∣nage, indirectly; (for abuses onely I taxe) so to discouer our Churches naked∣nesse, that euerie Cham (the prophane Atheist, and superstitious Papist) may espie and deride the same, wherein themselues are the most guiltie amongest vs; although none are more readie to 1. Sam.1.20. tell it in Gath, or publish it in the streetes of Ash∣kelon, that the daughters of Babylon may triumph. After that wee haue spoken of the Times, Places, and Rites sacred to GOD, order requireth next to speake of those Persons, whose office and function it was to procure and mannage those Diuine and Religious affaires. And first, amongest the first Hebrewes, wee finde no Priest named before Abrahams time, in which Melchizedech was interpreted by the most, to be Shem the sonne of Noah. Fa∣ther both of this and other Nations: and Maister Broughton hath written a whole Booke in confirmation heereof. The heads of Families then exercised the Priestlie office of teaching, praying, and sacrificing in their owne housholds, as we reade of Gen. 18.19. Abraham, Isaac, Genes.37. and Gen.49. Iacob. After that, the first borne of all the Tribes of Israel were consecrated to this businesse, when as GOD had destroyed the first-borne of Aegypt, Exod.13.2.& 15. and these offered Sacrifices Exod.24.5. vntill that the Leuites were chosen in their roome; Num.3.41. GOD turning that propheticall curse of Iacob, of Gen.49.7. scat∣tering them in Israel, into a blessing, for the instructing of the Israelites. The cause of this their consecration was, because they, Exod.32.29. in a zeale of GODS glorie, had sanctified their hands to this ministerie in the bloud of the neerest of their idola∣trous kinred, that had sinned in adoring the golden Calfe. Now in the third of Numbers, where the first-borne of the Israelites, and the Leuites are numbred, appeareth a difficultie, which most of the Interpreters which I haue read of that place, haue neglected: namely, that of the Israelitish first∣borne there were found, from a moneth-old vpward, two and twentie thousand, two hundred seuentie and three, and of the Leuites, but two and twentie thousand; so that therefore there must be fiue shekels a peece payed for the redemption of e∣uery of those two hundred seuentie and three in surplusage more then the Leuites; whereas yet in the parcells of the Leuiticall accompt, are found more of the Leuites then of the Israelites, as appeareth; the family of the Gershonites containing seuen thousand and fiue hundred, the Kohathites, eight thousand six hundred, and the family of Merari, sixe thousand and two hundred, which being added together, amount to two and twentie thousand and three hundred; and therefore are se∣uen and twentie more then the Israelites. To this Lyra in Num. Diony Carthus. Iun. addeth al∣so in the number of Priests. Lyrae, Dionysius Carthusianus, and Iunius (for the most are wholy silent) answere, that those three hundred ouer and aboue the two and twenty thousand were first-borne themselues, and therefore in right of the former challenge of the first-borne, were the LORDS already. And if it seeme as much wonder, (which Authors obserue not) that of two and twen∣tie thousand were but three hundred first-borne; But one of 74. That their exploit of executing their kinred for idolatrie (before mentioned) in which sinne, the first-borne, as Priests, were likeliest to haue followed Aaron, a chiefe man of their Tribe, might answere for me. And that cruell Edict Exod.9. of Pharao, and their miraculous fruitful∣nesse, may make it lesse strange, that both in these Leuites there were so few first∣borne,
and in the other Israelites also, with whom amongst 603550. men from twen∣ty yeres old vpwards, there were (though reckoning but from a month old, as is said) but 22273. which is little more then one of seuen and twenty, besides that inequa∣litie of the persons numbred. This excursion vpon this occasion, wherein I haue found diuerse Interpretets mute, will (I hope) finde pardon with the Reader, who happily himselfe may finde some better resolution. To returne to our Historie; GOD had before appointed Aaron to be high Priest, and his sonnes Exod.28. to be Priests, to whom the Leuites were assigned after (as wee haue said) as assistants in inferiour offices of the Tabernacle. Aaron, from whom is rec∣koned the succession of the high Priests in the same office, had appointed to him eight holy garments, a breast-plate, an ephod, a robe, a broidred coat, a miter, a girdle, a plate of golde, and linnen breeches. Also his sonnes had appointed to them coates, and bonets, and girdles, and breeches: which their attire is described at large, Exo. 28. Iosephus writeth of the Stones there mentioned, That that on the Priests right shoulder shined forth very bright, when GOD was pleased with their Sacrifices, as did also those twelue in the breast-plate, when in the time of warre GOD would assist them, which ceased miraculously to shine two hundred yeeres before his time; or as the Talmudists say, from the building of the second Temple. The consecration of the Priests, and rites thereof are mentioned, Exod. 29. The conditions required in the high Priest, as that he should not haue the bodily defects of blindnes, lamenes, maimednes, &c. nor should vncouer his head, and many other such like, are expressed, Leu. 21. His Leuit.244. office was daily to light the Lights at the eue∣ning, and to burne incense at morning and euening, and once euery Sabbath to set the Shew-bread before the LORD to sacrifice, and once a yere to make recon∣ciliation in the holy place, &c. This office they executed till the Captiuitie, after which they ruled also in the Common-wealth, and the family of the Maccabees ob∣tained temporall and spirituall iurisdiction, being both Priests and Kings. But the state being vsurped by others, they also appoynted high Priests at their pleasures: and thus were Annas and Caiphas high Priests, although Caiphas alone admi∣nistred the office, which was abrogated to Annas, the name onely remaining: and thus Iosephus saith, that Anna was most happie, who had himselfe beene high Priest, and seene all his sonnes in that office, whereas in the institution, and before the Cap∣tiuitie, this office continued ordinarily with their liues: which after they enioyed longer or shorter, at pleasure of the Conquerour. Next vnto the high Priest, were the Priests lineally descended from Eleazar and Ithamar the sonnes of Aaron, as in number many, so in their priestly rayments, consecration, condition, and office, much differing from the sormer, as appeareth; for their garments, Leuitic. 28. their consecration 29. their conditions required in them, Leu. 10. and 21. and their office in some things, as preaching, praying, sacrifi∣cing, not much vnlike to the former, but in degree, sometime assisting him in these things, sometime alone, and in some things, nothing participating, as in Moses plainly may be seene. These priestly families, being of the house of Eleazar sixteen, and of Ithamar eight, which Dauid by lot distributed into foure and twenty orders, according to the number of the heads of families, those foure and twenty men, chiefe of those orders, being to the high Priest, as Aarons sonnes were vnto him in their ministery, 1. Chronic. 24. and tooke turnes by course, in perfourming of the same as Luke sheweth Lu.1.5. in the example of Zachary. Iosephus Ioseph. in App. & in vita. testifieth the same, and af∣firmeth, That in each of these rankes were more then fiue thousand men in his time: and in the historie of his life, saith, that himselfe was of the first of these orders, betwixt which was no small difference, and the heads of these were called also Chiefe Priests Ez.8.Mar.14 Actes 4. in the old and new Testament. The Leuites had the next place in the legall ministery: all that descended of Leui, except the family of Aaron, being thus called: and Num. 3. according to the des∣cent of the three sonnes of Leui had their Offices assigned them, which so continued till the daies of Dauid. He distributed them according to their families vnto their
seuerall functions, twentie foure thousand to the seruice of the Temple: six thousand to be Iudges and Rulers, foure thousand Porters, and foure thousand which praised the LORD vpon instruments. These were diuided vnder their Heads or Princi∣palls according to their 1.Chr. 23.24, families. The Leuiticall Musicians, with their Offices and Orders are reckoned. 1. Chron. 25. and 2. Chron. 7. These in stead of the silken stole, which they ware, obtained in the dayes of Agrippa, to weare a linnen one, like the Priests. The Porters are in the 26. of 1. Chron. described according to their families, orders and offices. They kept, in their courses, the doores and treasures of the Tem∣ple: to keep the same cleane, and to keep that which was vncleane out of the same: and these all are mustered in their offices 2. Chron. 35. The Gibeonites, called after Nethanims, were at hand vnto the Leuites in the meanest offices about the Tabernacle and Temple, Ios. 9.21. and 1. Chro. 9. assigned hereunto first by Ioshu.1, after by Dauid and the Princes, for the seruice of the Le∣uites to cut wood, and draw water, for the house of GOD, Ezra 8. Besides these Ecclesiasticall persons in the ordinarie ministerie of the temple, were other, which may no lesse be counted holy: either in regard of Vow, as the See the in∣stitution of them, Num.6.2 Nazarites for a time: Sampson is an especiall example hereof, and Iames the Iust, brother of our LORD: or else they were Prophets by extraordinary calling, as Samuel, Esay, Ieremy, and o∣thers: to whome GOD manifested his will by dreames, visions, and reuelations; whose ordinary habite seemes to be a rugged hairie garment, by the example of 2.Reg1.8. Isu.20.2. E∣lijah, and the false Zach.13.4. Prophets, and of Mat.3.4. Iohn Baptist afterward. And thus much of those persons, which according to the Law were sacred to GOD: it followeth that we should obserue their superstitious deuoting of themselues, according to their owne deuises and traditions, vnto a supposed seruice of GOD. In a more strict ma∣ner then ordinary, or some-way in opinion and practise differing both from the law, and the rest of the Iewish people. Of this kinde were many Sects, whereof wee are next to speake. CHAP. VIII. Of the diuers Sects, Opinions, and Alterations of Religion, a∣mongst the Hebrews. IN this matter of Alterations, and altercations amongest them about Questions and practise of Religion, we are in the first place to obserue their often apostacies Philastrius reckoning therein their idolatries, numb eth 28. Iewith sects: and as Scaliger obserueth, and the Scripture will bcare i, might by that rule haue rec∣koned many other. from the truth of the Lawe to the idolatrous superstitions of the neighbouring Nations: as the Reliques of their Aegyptian idolatry in the golden Calfe Exo. 32. their often murmu∣rings in the desart, the presumption of Nadab and Abihu, and after of Aaron and Miriam, the conspiracie of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Balaams stumbling-blocke, to couple them in idolatrous seruice to Baal-Peor, the idoll of the Moabites: And after their possession of the Land, when Ioshua and the Elders were dead, they serued Iud.2.12,13. the gods of the people that were round about them, as Baal and Ashtaroth: of the idoles and their rites is before spoken. And although Gideon cut downe the groue, and destroyed the altar of Baal, Iud.6.27. yet he made an Ephod of the eare∣rings of the prey, and put it in Ophrah his Citie, and all Israel went a whoring there after it Iud.8.27,33. : and after his death, made Baal-berith their god. They serued also the GODS of Aram, Zidon, Moab, Ammon, Iud.10.6. and the Philistims: Michah lud.17 &18. an Ephramite made an house of gods, an Ephod, and Teraphim, and consecrated one of his sonnes to be his Priest; and after set a Leuite, Ionathan, in his roome, the occasion of a∣postacie to a great part of the Tribe of Dan, all the while the house of GOD was in Shiloh: besides the corruption of state and religion by the Beniamites Iud.19. and by 1.Sam.2.12. Hophni and Phinehas the sonnes of Eli.
But after the reformation of Religion by Samuel, Dauid, and Salomon, (who yet became after an idolatour) befell their greatest Apostasie, to wit, of the tenne Tribes; from GOD, their King, and Religion, by the ouer-wise policie of Ieroboam, which corrupted and subuerted both it and himselfe. He (least those reuolted Israelites should, by frequenting GODS appointed worship at Ierusalem, recknowledge their former and truer LORD) consecrated two Aegyptian Calues at Bethel and Dan 1.King.12. , and made an House of High Places, and Priestes of the lowest of the people. Iudah also made them, in the same times, High Places, Images, and Groues, on euerie high Hill, and vnder euerie greene Tree. Yet had the Kingdome of Iudah their entercourses of corruption and reformation, according as they had good or bad Kings; but in Israel, the Commonwealth and Church receiued, by that sinne of Ieroboam, an vncurable wound and irrecouerable losse, vntill that, in GODS iust punishment, they were carried away by the Assyrian Kings into Assyria, and into Hala, Habor, and the Cities of the Medes, as 2. King. 17. appeareth, where is recorded a summarie collection of these and other their idolatries. Of these exiled Israelites (if wee beleeue the reports and coniectures of diuerse Authors) are des∣cended those Tartarians, which since ouer-ran, with their Conquests, a greater part of Asia and Europe, then euer any other Nation, before or since: of which their Originall and Exploits, wee shall in fitter place further discourse. The other Kingdome of Iudah, although it receiued sometime some breathing and refresh∣ing vnder her more vertuous and religious Kings, yet for the most part, groaning vnder Tyrannie and Idolatrie, was at last a prey to the Babylonians: from which seruitude being freed by the Persian Monarches, vnder varieties of aduerse and prosperous fortunes, it was afterwards rent and tome by the Macedonians, be∣ing made a common Stage for the Armes and Armies of the successors of Pto∣lomey in Aegypt, and Seleucus in Asia; remaining meede vnto the Conquerour, and receiuing no small impressions and wounds in Soule as well as Bodie, in Re∣ligion as in Politie. But being after deliuered from Macedonian thraldome by the Familie of the Macchabees, the Gouernment, Ecclesiasticall and Temporall, be∣came theirs, but the mindes of this Iewish people was in those Times diuided in diuersitie of Sects and Opinions, of which the Euangelicall and other Histories make mention. The opinions of the Iewes may bee reduced Halls Phari∣saisme and Christianitie. Synagoga Iu∣daic. cap.2. into these two generall Heads: the one were such as contented themselues with the Law of GOD, and were called Karraim, or Koraim, of which sort there are diuerse at this day in Constantinople, and other-where: The other Rabbinists, Supererogatorie (as Master Hall calls them) and Popish Iewes, called Hasidim, professing a more strict Holinesse then the Law required: Yet at first these both pleased them∣selues, and did not, by opposition of Science, displease each other, and disagree∣ing in opinion, they yet in affection agreed. But when these voluntarie Serui∣ces began to be drawne into Canons, and of arbitrarie became necessarie, they were rent into sundrie Sects. Of these and their originall let vs heare Scaliger speake. There were Ios. Scal. Elench. Triber. Nich. Serrar. c.22. He calls these two sects cap.2. Karraim, of Kara, which signifieth the Scripture: and Rabbanm, which were the Wise-men,  after called Phari∣sees. (sayth hee) before the times of Hasmonaei, two kindes of Dog∣matists, men holding differing opinions, among the Iewes: the one onely accep∣ting the written Law; the other Tradition, or the addition to the Law. Of the former kinde arose the Karraim, of whome came the Sadducees; of the later, the Pharisees. These Pharisees were the issue of the Hasidees. The Hasidees were a Corporation, Guild, or Fraternitie, which voluntarily ad∣dicted themselues to the Offices of the Law, I. Macchabees, Chap. 2. verse 42. Iunius tran∣slateth it As∣chidaei, & sayth, they were such as for religion were scattered and dispersed about forfeare of the King. Their originall was from the times of Ezrah, or Esdras, Haggai and Za∣charie, the Prophets, being authors of this Order. These, in regard of their in∣stitution, were called Holy, Hasidim; and in regard of their Combination, Hasi∣daei.
And besides that which the Law enioyned (which is iust debt) they superero∣gated, and of their owne free accord disbursed vpon the Temple and Sacrifices. They professed not onely to liue according to the Prescript of the Law, but if a∣ny thing could by interpretations and consequences be drawne thence, they held themselues bound to satisfie it, and when they had done all, to seeme to haue done nothing, but accounted themselues vnprofitable seruants notwithstanding. Euery one paid a tribute to the reparations of the Temple, from the times of Es∣dras and Nehemias. Neh.10.32. The Hasidaeans added further (of their owne free-will) to the Sanctuarie, Walles, and Porches, neuer (almost) going from the Temple, which they seemed to hold peculiar to themselues, and by which they vsed to sweare, By this Habitacle, or, By this House: Which the Pharisees, their posteritie, also did Mat.23.16. & 29. , as likewise they learned of them to build the Sepulchres of the Prophets. They were therefore called Hasidim, either because their Colledge was instituted of the Pro∣phets; or of their holy and religious workes, and the sacred buildings by them ei∣ther repaired or reared from the foundations. And therefore, when wicked Alci∣mus had killed threescore men of this Corporation or Guild, the people thought their death was prophecied in the Ps.79.2. Psalme, such reputation was there of their holinesse. These Hasidaei were not in proper sense a Sect, but a Fraternitie, which euerie day assembled in the Temple, and offered in daily Sacrifice a Lambe, which was cal∣led the Sinne-offering of the Hasidim. One day was excepted, the eleuenth of Tisri, in which that Sacrifice was omitted. They offered not themselues (for they were not Priests) but the Priests in their name. Abraham Zachuth Abr.Zachuth lib.Iohasm. sayth, That Baba, the sonne of Bnta. daily of his owne accord offered a Ramme for a Sinne-offering, ex∣cept one day, which was the day after the Expiation: And this was called the Sacri∣fice of the Saints for Sinne: And he sware, By this Habitacle, that is, the Temple. Of this kinde, or much like thereto, Scaliger Scal.ibid. cap.24. thinketh the Rechabites were, which Ie∣remia ler.35.19. mentioneth, whose immediate father hee accounteth Ionadab, (not him which liued 2.Reg.10.15. in the dayes of Iebu, but another of that name) and that their austere order began but a little before it ended (namely, in the same Prophets time) quickly ending, because of the Captiuitie. After the Captiuitie, those sonnes of Io∣nadab, renewing their former obseruations, were called Hasidaei, which went not from the Temple, and obserued the orders aboue-mentioned: so Scaliger interpre∣ted Ieremies Prophecie, that Ionadab should not want one to stand before the LORD, that is, to minister and attend holy duties in the Temple, like to Anna the Prophe∣tesse Luk.2.37. . This (sayth he) is the true beginning of the Hasidaei, which abstained from wine, as did also the Priests, as long as they ministred in the Temple. Thus much Scaliger. Drusius Drus.de 3 ser.l.1.c.11. proueth, That diuers of the Pharisees and Essees also were of these Hasi∣daei, whereby it appeareth, that it was rather a Brotherhood, as Scaliger calleth it, then a Sect. He sheweth their Rites and Discipline, out of Iuchasin. or Iohasin Ab.Zac. They spent nine houres of the day in prayer. They beleeued that a man might sinne in thought, and therefore they had care thereof; their will was not without the will of Heauen, that is, of GOD. Tenne things were peculiar to them: Not to lift vp their eyes a∣boue tenne cubits: secondly, Not to goe bare-headed: thirdly, To stablish three re∣fections: fourthly, To dispose their hearts to prayer: fifthly, Not to looke on either side: sixtly, To goe about, that they might not be troublesome to any companie: seuenthly, Not to eat at the Tables of great men: eightly, If they had angred any man, quickly to appease him: ninthly, To haue a pleasant voice, and to descend to the interpretation of the Law: tenthly, To accustome themselues to their Threads and Phylacteries. Rab (one of this Fraternitie) did not lift vp his eyes aboue foure cubits. Tenne or twentie daies before their death they were diseased with the Collicke, and so all cleare and cleane they departed into the other life.
To returne vnto Scaliger. touching the originall of Sects, and to leaue those Hasi∣daean obseruants. As long (sayth he) as Supere rogation onely was vsed, there was no Sect in the people of GOD: but when the Precepts thereof were brought into Canons, and committed to writing, then arose many doubts, disputations, altercati∣ons, growing and succeeding daily, from whence sprang two Sects, differing in opi∣nion; the one admitting onely the Law, the other embracing the interpretations and expositions of their Rabbines. The former, in processe of time, was diuided in∣to two. For at first the Karram were onely such as obserued the Law and the Pro∣phets, till the times of Sadok and Boethi or Baithi, who first doubted of the punish∣ment of sinnes, and rewards of good workes, from whome sprang the Haeresie of the Sadducees. The Karraim were not, before this, diuided in Sect from the Hasi∣dim, but onely in those voluntarie Functions and Supereogations, wherein the Law, by Iniunction, ruled the former, and these, as is said, supererogated. But when Canons and Iniunctions began to be written, then of these Hasidim arose Dogma∣tists, which called themselues Perushim, Holy, and Separated both from the other Hasidim, and from the Vulgar; making a necessitie of that obseruation, which be∣fore was voluntarie. This sort was againe diuided into those which retayned the name Perushim, or Pharisees; and the Essens: both receiuing from their Authors the Rules and Precepts of their Sect. After this, the Pharisees were diuided into any kindes: The Iewes reckon seuen. The Essens also were diuided first into Cloysterers, or Collegians, which liued in a common Societie; and Eremites, or So∣litraric persons; and those former into such as married; and others which remained continent. Now let vs consider of these more particularly; and first of the Pharisees. Drusius Drusius de 3.Sectis, li.2. deriueth the name from the Syrian, as most of the names in the New Testament are, and not from the Hebrew; for then it should it not be Pharisees, but Pharusees: as after the Hebrew, it should rather be Masias, then Messias. The Etimologie some fetch from Phares, which signifieth Diuision, as Epiphanius, and Origen, with others Ambros. in Luc. l.3. Damascen. de haeres. Suidas. : against which, Drusius excepteth, because in Phares the last letter is Tsaddi, here it is Schin. Others Fr. Forerius, Es.1.10. Forsic∣rus lexic. deriue it from Parash, signifying to explaine, because, they did all things openly, to be seene of men: it is not likely: or Hypocrisie loues her workes should be seene, but not her humour (then should it not be hypocrisie;) shee would not be seene in her affection to be seene: and this name, in this sense, would haue beene to their infamie, and not to their reputation, which they most aymed at. A third deriuation of this name is from another signi∣fication of the same Verbe, to expound. But to expound the Law, was more pro∣per to the Scribes; and some of the Pharisees were not Expositors. Howbeit, the most probable opinion is, that they were so called of Separation; because they were, or would seeme to be, separated from others: first, in cleanenesse of life; se∣condly, in dignitie; thirdly, in regard of the exquisitenesse of those Obseruations, whereto they were separated; fourthly, in their habite, wherein they were (as our Monkes) distinguished from the people; yea, they did abhorre the garments of the people. Their opinions are gathered by Iosephus Ioseph.de An∣tiq.l.18.de bell.Iud.l.2. , and others, out of whome Drusius. They attributed (sayth Iosephus) all things to Fate. Abraham Zacuth interpre∣teth their opinion thus, They beleeue that GOD knoweth and disposeth all things, and the Starres helpe; yet so, as free-will is left in the hand of man. And if a man by his free-will chuseth the good, GOD will helpe him in his good way. They say, That there is no Hearbe in the Earth which hath not his proper Planet in Heauen. They ascribed immortalitie to the Soule, holding, that iudgement passed on it vn∣der the Earth; and that if it had done euill, it was adiudged to perpetuall prisons: if well, it had easie returne vnto life by a transmigration Thus Christ was, after this opinion, called Elias, or one of the Prophets. , or going into another bo∣die. So Zacuth: The good Soules take delight of their good workes; the bad des∣cend, and ascend not. They beleeued that there were both Deuils and good Angels.
They conceiued, that he which kept the most of the Commaundements, although he transgresse in some, is iust before GOD: against which opinion Burgens. Ad∣dit.1.in epist.Ia.2.10. Burgensis thinketh, that Iames alledged that saying in his Epistle, He that faileth in one, is guiltie of all. He citeth Rab. Moses for this Pharisaicall opinion, That GOD iudgeth according to the pluralitie or paucitie (to vse his owne words) of merits or demerits. Like stuffe haue I read in S. Francis Legend, of the ballance wherein mens deedes are weighed, and the Deuill lost his prey by the weight of a Chalice, which one had giuen to the Saint; which heauie mettall caused the Scale wherein his good deedes were put (be∣fore too light) to weigh heauiest. They (the auncienter Pharisees) confesse the Resur∣rection of the flesh. Hereof are three opinions Drus. l.2. c. 14. : one, That all, good and bad, shall rise againe; another, That the iust only shall rise; a third, That the iust, and part of the wic∣ked, shall rise. They call their Traditions the Law giuen by Word, and the vnwritten Law, which they equall to the written, deriuing both from Moses, as more fully elsewhere shall be said. These Traditions they called , as both Epiphanius and Hieronynius witnesse: the Teachers thereof , or Wise-men; and when they Lectured, they were wont to say, , i. The Wise-men teach Traditions. Of these Traditions were, concerning the Sabbath, That they might iourney from their place two thousand cubites; (Hierome Hierom. ep. ad Alg. accounteth feet, Origen Orig. , l.4.c.2. Elnes) That none might carrie any burthen that day; but they interpreted, if one carried on one shoulder, it was a burthen; if on both, it was none; if his shooes had nayles, they were a burthen, otherwise not. Concerning Fasting, the Pharisee boasteth, Luk. 18. 12. I fast twice in the weeke: which they obserued (sayth Theophilact Theoph. in Luc.18. ) on the second and fifth day, Mundayes and Thursdayes. Happily out Wednesdayes and Fridayes succeeded in this Penance, that we might not seeme to be behind them in dutie, howsoeuer woe disagree with them in their time. And yet Mercorus sayth, The Iewes fasted the fourth day, Wednesday, because they held that vnluckie, in which children are taken with the Squinancie. Further, the Pharisees eat not vnwashed, , Mark 7. 3. Except they wash with the fist, as Beza translateth. Scaliger Scalig.Elench. Ser.cap.7. expoun∣deth it, not by washing one fist in the other, but composing the fingers into such a frame, that all their ends meet on the toppe of the thumbe, which for want of ano∣ther name is called πυγμὴ, a Fist, although it be not properly so. In this forme they hold vp their hands in washing, that the water may slide downe to the elbow, and thence fall to the ground, as the Iewes vse to this day. They washed Mar.7.4. when they came from Market, because sinners and vncleane persons were there, whose touch might pollute them. They washed also Cups and Brasen Vessels and Beds not cham∣ber-beds to lye on (Drusius Drus lib.2. vbi supra. expoundeth) but dining-beds, which they vsed instead of Tables. They would not Luc.7.3. Es.65.5. eat with Publicanes or Sinners, yea they accounted themselues polluted with their touch. Their Hypocrisie in prayer CHRIST mentioneth, that it was long, and open in the streetes &c. It was thrice in the day, at the third, sixt, and ninth houre: Their wordes submisse and softly, as of Hannah, 1. Sam. 1. and toward the Temple. They tythed all, Luk. 18. Matth. 23. euen the smallest matters. For Tythes (sayth Aquita) are the Hedge of thy Riches. And another Prouerbe (learne it) Tythe, that thou mayest be rich. Epiphanius Epiph.haer.16. addeth, they payed First fruits, thirtieths, and fiftieths, Sacrifices, and Vowes. Their Phylacteries or Seruatories, Defensiues (so the word signifieth) in Hebrew Totaphoth Of these read the 15. chapter fol∣lowing. , they vsed as Preseruatiues, or Remembrancers of the Law, and ware them larger then other men. Hierome calls them Pittaciola, resembling to them here∣in some simple superstitious women, wearing little Gospels, and the wood of the Crosse, and such like, of zeale not according to knowledge, strayning a Gnat, and swallowing a Cammell. This superstition, then complained of by Hierome, yet remai∣neth (sayth Scaliger Scal. Elench. c.8. ) among Christians, and Mahumetanes, which weare about them the Gospell of S. Iohn. CHRIST condemneth not the Rite, but their ambition,
for dilating, not for wearing them, to which all the Iewes were bound, and all the Iewes and Samaritans obserued. They vsed the like ambition in their Fringes or twi∣sted Tassels, which the Iewes call Zizis, and vse them still, as after shall appeare. Their oathes were, By Ierusalem, the Temple, the Heauen, Earth, their Head, by the Law. Fagius Fag.annot. ad Onk.ap.Dr. obserueth, That the Iewes, in swearing, lay their hand on the booke of the Law, at this day. Other oathes are little esteemed. Hence it seemeth came our corporall Oathes on a Booke. The Iewes (sayth Capito Capit.in Hos. ) thinke it no oath, if one forsweare by Heauen or Earth, vnlesse he say by him which dwelleth there, &c. And none is subiect to that Curse, in which the Name of GOD is not added. That of Corban pertaineth to this place, mentioned Matth. 15:5. & Mark. 7.11. which some interprete, as if a Iew should say to his parents, That he had alreadie de∣dicated all that to GOD (to whome vowes are to be performed) wherewith hee might haue helped them. Doctor Rainolds Rain.& Hart c.7.d.4. sayth, That the Iewes, as they were prone to vngodly vowes, so this was an vsuall vow amongst them, and they would bind it with an oath, That such or such a man should haue no profit by them. The oath which they herein vsed as most solemne, was, By the Gift: for so they were in∣structed, Matth.23. That if any sware by the Altar, it was nothing, but if By the Gift, he was a debtor. The Pharisees therefore taught, if any had said to his father, By the Gift thou shalt haue no profit by me, then he might in no case doe them any good, against the Commaundement, Honour thy Father, &c. The Iewes vsed to bind their vowes with a Curse, as they which vowed Act.23.14. Paules death, vsing yet to suppresse the Curse it selfe, as, Heb.3.11. if they shall enter into my rest: So these, By the Gift, if thou haue any profit by me, meant they should haue none. Thus the Talmud (sayth he) the booke of their Canon Law, and Schoole-Diuinitie, sayth, That a man is bound to ho∣nour his father, vnlesse he vow the contrarie. Masius Mas.in Ios. ap. Dr. explaineth it thus, That they did consecrate by saying Corban all, wherewith they should haue benefited their parents: as if they had said, Let it be Anathema, or deuoted, whatsoeuer it be, with which I may profit thee. And therefore those Rabbines, vnder pretext of Religion, allowed not to spend on his parents that which hee had thus vowed to GOD. Scaliger Scal. Elench. c.9. thus interpreteth the place, as if a sonne being by his parents ad∣monished of his dutie, should put them off with this exception, vnlesse that which I haue offered for thee, free me of this burthen. But let the more curious read it in himselfe. The Pharisees were esteemed pitifull; the Sadducees more cruell. N. yra. in Mat.16. They were much addicted to Astrologie, and the Mathematikes: whose names of the Planets E∣piphanius Epip. hr.16. rehearseth, as also of the twelue Signes. There were Drus. de 3. see.l.2.c.22. seuen sorts of the Pharisees, which the Talmud reckoneth: first, Sichemita, which measure pietie by honour and profit, as the Sichemites, which for the marriage of Dina endured Circumcision: secondly, Nacphi, which lifted not his feet from the ground: the third Kisai, Draw-bloud, which smiteth his head to the wall, to cause the bloud to come; and also shutteth his eyes, that he behold not a woman: the fourth, that standeth on his perfection, called Mahchobathi: What is my sinne? as if there wanted nothing to his righteousnesse: the fifth, Medu∣chia, which goe lowly and stouping: the sixt, the Pharisee of Loue, which obeyeth the Law for loue of vertue or reward: the seuenth, the Pharisee of Feare, which is holden in obedience by feare of punishment. This they call Iobs Pharisee, the former Abrahams. Epiphanius Epip. hr.16. describeth their strict obseruations. Some (sayth hee) prescribed to themselues tenne yeares, or eight or foure yeares continence. Some lay on plankes, which were only nine ynches broad, that when they slept, they might fall to the paue∣ment, so to be awakened againe to prayer, and keepe themselues waking. Others put stones vnder them for the same end, by pricking to awake them: others lay on thornes for that purpose. Scaliger Scal.El.c.13. reproueth Epiphanius for affirming, that the Pharisees ware
womans attyre, as not agreeing to their austeritie, which despised all beds, beat them∣selues against wals, and put thornes in the fringes of their garments, to pricke them: he thinketh him deceiued by some Iewes report; and addeth, that the moderne Iewes haue little or no knowledge of those auncient Pharisees, but as they learne it of the Christians, or of Pseudo-Gorionides (so he calleth the Hebrew Booke, ascribed to Io∣seph ben Gorion, whome Drusius esteemeth, and Scaliger proueth to be, a coun∣terfeit.) Wee may here also insert the Scal.Elench. c.10. manner of the Iewish Schoole or Academie, with their promotion therein to the degree of a Doctor: which whosoeuer affected, was first a Disciple and being prostrate at the feet of the Doctor, heard him teaching: for the Disciple did reade, being layd on the Floore or Pauement, and the Doctor inter∣preted what he read. All the time which he learned on this manner, was called his Minoritie. and the Scholler was called Katan, à Minor. Thus Paule sayth hee Act.22.3. was brought vp at the feet of Gamaliel. All this while he was called by the name of his father, his owne name not added; which, after laying on of hands, was annexed to his Title: as Ben Bethira before laying on of hands; after, Rabbi Iosua Ben Bethira, &c. For by laying on of hands he was promoted to his Mastership; which was done with a set forme of words, whereof R. Iuda, the sonne of Baba, was Author. But although he had now receiued the Degree, he was not presently intituled Master, but Chaber. as  with the Greekes, Speusippus  Platonis, that is, such a Scholler as is able to teach. This word Chaber therefore is not put alone, but hath alway his Relatiue adioyned, as R. Ismael Chaber of R. Eleazar. And whiles hee was so called, hee neuer sate whiles his Master sate, but prostrate on the pauement: And when they were both Masters, the younger stood, while the elder sate and taught: as in the Primitiue Church the younger Bishop called the elder Papa. Such was the reuerence to their Rabbines. CHRIST at twelue yeares was otherwise ho∣noured amongst them: but this was extraordinarie. The Pharisees in a selfe-conceit and singularitie called all but themselues, in a dis∣gracefull scorne, Ar.Mont. in Euang.Mat.23. Other men: so said he, Luk. 18. I am not as other men: whereas they accounted themselues maisters of others, on whome also they bound heauie bur∣thens, in their Rules and Cases, the breach whereof they iudged Sinne in the people, but yet held not themselues bound thereto. For example, Euery Israelite ought eue∣rie day, by their Rule, to say ouer the tenne Commaundements, and that in the first Watch, which might not be deferred, for danger of sinne; and yet amongst themselues they esteemed it lawfull at any houre of the night. But vpon the Proselytes they im∣posed more then on the other Israelites, all which they were bound to (in their cen∣sure) vnderpaine of Hell-fire; and therefore CHRIST sayd, They made them two∣fold more the children of Hell then themselues; for they freed themselues from many of those impositions they layd on the consciences of others. And these Proselytes they lesse trusted, and therefore burthened them with more obseruations. After wee haue spoken of the Pharisees, which loued the first roomes (which they haue here obtained) it followeth to speake next of the Sadducees Sadducees. , who in the New Testament are often mentioned. Beda in Act.5. Beda giueth an vniust interpretation of their name, saying the Sadducees are interpreted Iust. Epiphanius Epiph.hr.14. also fetcheth their name from Sadec, which signifieth Iustice. Lyra Lyra in Act. 5. alledgeth a reason, because they were seuere and rigorous in iudgement, they gaue this name of Iust (not iustly) to themselues. Burgensis Burgens.ibid. otherwise; as of Arrius were the Arrians, so of one Sadoch (sayth he) are the Sadducees called, who was the first inuentor of their Heresie. The Pharisees were esteemed more iust then they, as appeareth Luk. 18. 9. They counted themselues iust, and despised others; Summum ius, summa iniuria. Their rigorous iu∣stice was vniust rigour. This Drus de 3. Sec.l.3.c.3. Sadoc, or rather Saduc, liued vnder Antigonus Sochaens, who succeeded to Simeon the Iust: His fellow-scholler was Baithos, of whome came the Baithosaeans. So sayth Abraham ben Dauid in his Historicall Cabball: Antigonus said, Bee yee not as seruants, which minister to their Prince on condition
to receiue reward. Sadoc and Baithos asked him of this thing, and hee answered that they should not put confidence in the reward of this life, but in the world to come. But they denied his words, and said, Wee neuer heard any thing of the world to come; for they had beene his disciples: and they dissented from him, and went to the Sanctuarie of Mount Garizin, where the princes were. They vpbraided the Pharisees with their Traditions, saying; The Tra∣dition is in the hand of the Pharisees, to vexe themselues in this world, whereas in the world to come they haue no reward. Antigonus his words are in the Treatise Aboth. Be ye not seruants which minister to a Prince, to receiue of him reward: but be ye as seruants which minister to their Prince, with this condition, that they receiue no reward, and let the feare of God be vpon you. Baithos had a diuers family fro Sadoc, otherwise held the same opinions, as Hellel and Sammai among the Pharisees; so these were two chiefe Masters of the Sadducaean Schooles. The Baithusaeans ministered to Baithos in vessels of siluer and gold. These Sadducees were called Minim or Minaei, that is, Heretikes. They are called Karraim, because they would seeme Textuall, and Scripture-men, disallowing Traditions, Scal.Elen. Tribaer.cap.2. of Kara, which signifieth the Scripture: which was called Kara or Cara, of Cara to reade, saith Drusius, Drus. quast. lib.1.q.44. because of the diligence, which ought to be vsed in reading the Scrip∣tures, whereunto men should designe (after the Iewish precepts) the third part of their life. Abraham Zachuth calles them Epicures. The Scriptures they interpreted after their owne sense, nor regarded they the words of the Wise men; that is, the Pharisees. They were of the ancient Caraeans, or Karraim, but not of those which now are so ter∣med; which as Zachuth confesseth, confesse the Resurrection, and Reward. Scaliger Scal. quosup. affirmeth, by the testimonie of Philip Frederike a Christian Iew, who had great fami∣liaritie with these Karraim at Constantinople, and had beene often present at their Synagogue, that they differ nothing from the other Iewes, but in reiecting Traditi∣ons, and are farre more honest and faithfull then the Rabbanim, of whom they are no lesse hated for their integritie, then for reiecting Tradition. Concerning the Karraim now remaining, it is reported that the other Iewes, and they, will not speake one to another: so inexpiable hatred do the other Iewes con∣ceiue against them. And Postellus saith, G. Postel. Al∣phab.12. ling. ap. Dr. There are three principall Sects of the Iewes in the Easterne parts; Thalmudists; Caraim, which reiect those Glosses. They are rich, but so hated of the rest, that a great part of their virgins remaine vnmarried: And if (saith the common Iew) it should so happen that a Caraim and a Christian should fall together into the water, with like possibilitie of sauing either, he would make a bridge of the Caraim to saue the Christian. The third sort is the Samaritan, of which after∣ward. Buxdorf. Buxdorf.Syna∣gog.Iud.cap.2. saith, that there are of these Caraim also in Poland; and Leo Leo.Africa. menti∣ons some places in Barbary, where this sort of Iewes doth inhabit; as you may here∣after reade in our sixth Booke, and the eleuenth Chapter. First, their difference from the Pharisees was about the future reward, which being denied, they by consequence of that error fell into the rest, to deny the Resurrection: the subsistence spirituall, &c. They couped vp GOD in Heauen, without all behol∣ding of euill. They denied Fate, which the Pharisees held. They denied Spirit altoge∣ther, saith Lira, Lyra in Act.23. for they held GOD to be corporeall: the soule to die with the bo∣die: Angels and Diuels they denied: Good and euill they ascribed to a mans free-wil Ioseph de Bel. Iud.lib.2.7. . They were inhospitall and cruell: and as cruelly, hated of the people. They are char∣ged (the Diuell may be slandered) to deny all Scripture but Moses Reade this Argument handled by Scaliger. Elenc. cap.16. : But first in Scrip∣ture, this opinion of theirs is not mentioned: and Iosephus affirmeth, that they recei∣ued the Scriptures, and reiected Tradition. Neither would the Zealous people of the Iewes, haue endured them in the Temple, if they had denied their Prophets, for feare of whom, they durst not professe otherwise of Iohn Baptist, although hee had left no monument of miracle, or Scripture. Drusius Drus. de 3. ct.li.3.cap.10. would reconcile this opinion of the Fa∣thers, which say they denied all but Moses; and the other, saying, that some of the Sadducees liued in Iudaea, others in Samaria. These later happily, with the Samaritans, denied all saue Moses. Amongst these were the Apostata's, which liued in Sichem, men∣tioned by Iosephus Antiq. lib. 11. cap. 8. and Ecclesiasticus 50. 27. Iunius thinketh
that they fell from the Iewish religion with Manasses, in the time of Nehemias. The Sect of the Sadducees was diminished, if not worne out, after the destruction of the Temple, till in the yeare 4523. or after Scalig. 4515. and A D. 755. one Anan and Saul his sonne renewed that Doctrine, because he had not receiued his expected promotion to the degree of Gaon Gaon was a degree, as a Doctor with vs, created by imposition of hands, 8 c. . Hee wrote bookes against the other Iewes. The like did one Carcasuas But of these Sadducees too much. Of the Essexs. Essees or Hessees, followeth in the next place. Their name Scaliger Scalig. Elenc. cap 26. deri∣ueth of a to be written Hessees not Essees. word which signifieth Rest, or quietnes and silence: both which well agreed to their institution. He disproueth that opinion of Eusebius, & others, that therein fol∣lowed him, which thought these Iewish Heretikes were Christian Monks and Catho∣likes. Such Catholikes, let Baronius Baron. Annal. tom.I. and Bellarmine l de Mon. lib.2. cap.5. boast of, as the authors of their Monkes, for so they would haue them; which you may beleeue as well as before the Floud, Enosh; and after, Elias, Iohn Baptist, the Nazarites & Rechabites, were Monkish Votaries, as the Cardinall would haue you. As for these Essees, he makes no small a∣doe against the Centuries, Cent. I. lib.2. cap.3. for vnderstanding Philo of Iewish, and not of Christian Monkes. But the loue to Monkery hath dazeled the eyes of men too much: and euen their historie (which followeth) will conuince that opinion of falsehood. Besides, Christianitie should haue small credit of such associates. Indeed the later Monkes are much like them in superstition and Idolatrie, though farre behind in other things. But hee that will see this Argument disputed, let him reade Scaliger his Confutation of Serarius the Iesuite. He sheweth also that the Ossens, Sampsaeans, Messalians, and di∣uers heresies amongst the Christians, sprang from these Essees: that the Egyptian Essees, of which Philo speaketh, out of whom Eusebius first collected that conceit, and that Philo himselfe had no skill in the Hebrew, but knew only the Greeke tongue: that Pau∣lus the Eremite in Thebais, was the first Author of Monasticall liuing. But now to come to our historie of these men. These Essees, Hessees, or Essens, are placed by Pliny on the West of the Dead-sea Plin.l.5.c.17. , a people solitarie, & in the whole world most admirable, without women, without mo∣ney, and a nation eternall in which none is borne, the wearinesse of others fortunes be∣ing the cause of their fruitfull multiplying. Philo in that Booke which he intituled, that all good men are free, saith that there were of them aboue soure thousand, called Essaei, quasi , that is, Holy, not sacrificing other creatures, but their mindes, vnto GOD. Some of them are Husband-men, some Artificers, for necessitie, not for abundance: They make no weapons of warre, nor meddle with Merchandize. They haue no ser∣uants, but are all both free, and mutually seruants to each other. They liue perpetually chast, sweare not at all, nor lie: esteeming GOD the Giuer of all good, and Author of no euill: Their societie is such, that one garment, one house, one food, one treasurie, one getting, one spending, one life, is in common to them all; carefully prouiding for their sicke, and holding the elder men in place of parents. Iosephus, who himselfe liued among them, doth more largely describe them. Ioseph.de bel. Iud.lib.2. cap.7. Hee reporteth that they were by Nation Iewes, auoiding pleasures and riches as Sinnes; ac∣counting continence and contentednes great vertues. They marrie not, but instruct the children of others, respecting them as their kindred, in their manners: not denying the lawfulnesse of marriage, but the honestie of women. Hee which becommeth one of their fraternitie, must make his goods common. Oyle and neatnesse they shunne, yet weare alwaies a white garment. They haue Officers for their common prouision. They haue no one certaine Citie, but in each, many of them haue their houses: to strangers of their owne Sect, they communicate their goods, and acquaintance; and therefore carrie nothing with them in their iorneyes, but weapons for feare of theeues: and in euery Citie haue of the same Colledge an especiall Officer which prouideth for stran∣gers. The children vnder tuition of Masters are alike prouided for; nor do they change their raiment till the old be worne: They neither buy nor sell, but mutually communi∣cate. Deuout they are in the seruice of GOD. For before the Sunne riseth, they speake of no prophane or wordly matter, but celebrate certaine Prayers, as The Essees were worship∣pers of the Sunne: hence came the  and Sampsai. praying him to rise. Then by their Officers are each appointed to their workes, till the fifth houre, at
which time they assemble together, and, being girded with linnen garments, wash themselues in cold water. Then do they go into their dining roome, as into a Temple, where no man of another Sect may be admitted; and there staying with silence, the Pantler sets them bread in order, and the Cooke one vessell of broth. The Priest giueth thankes, as after dinner also. Then laying aside those their holy garments, they plie their worke till the euening; and then suppe in like manner. There is neuer crying or tumult, they speake in order, and obserue euen without the house a venerable silence. In other things they are subiect to their Ouersoer, but at their owne choice may helpe and shew mercie to others. To their kindred they cannot giue without licence. What they say, is certaine: but an oath they hate no lesse thē periury. They studie the writings of the Ancient, thence collecting such things as may benefit the manners of the mind, or health of the bodie. They which are studious of their Sect, must a yeares space en∣dure triall, and then after that probation of their continencie, must be probationers yet two yeeres longer, and then vpon allowance of their manners are assumed into their fellowship; making first deepe proteestation of religion towards God, and iustice to∣wards men, to keepe faith to all, but especially to Princes, and if they shall come to rule ouer others, not to abuse their power, not to exceed others in habit, not to steale, not to keepe any thing secret from them of their owne Sect, or communicate it to an∣other, although vpon perill of life: not to deuise new doctrines: to keepe the bookes of their owne opinions, and the names of the Angels. Offenders they put from their fellowship: and he which is thus excommunicate, may not receiue food offered of any other, but, eating grasse and herbes, is consumed with famine, except they in compas∣sion receiue him againe, in extremitie. They giue no sentence of iudgement, being fewer then an hundred. If ten sit together, one speakes not without consent of the rest. They may not spit in the middest, or on the right-hand. They will not so much as purge Nature on the Sabbath They go not to stoole on the Sabbath, because of that instrument which they coud not vse to digge and couer their ex∣crement, with∣out Sabbath∣breaking. Sca∣liger. , and on other dayes do it very closely, for offending the Diuine light, and couer it with an instrument in the earth, and that in the most secret places; and are washed after. They are of foure rankes, according to the time of their profession; and the yonger sott of these are so far inferiour to the rest, that if one of these do touch them, he wash∣eth himselfe, as if he had touched a stranger. They liue long: feare not death: nor by any tortures of the Romans, could be compelled to transgresse their lawes; but derided their tormentors rather: beleeuing to receiue their soules againe presently, holding the bodies to be corruptible, and the prisons of the immortall soules: which if they haue been good, haue a pleasant place assigned them beyond the Ocean, but the euill to be in tempestuous stormie places of punishments. Some of these Essens also forertell things to come. And another sort is of thē which allow of marriage, but make a three∣yeares triall first of the women, and if by a constant purgation they appeare fit for child-bearing, they wed them, not for pleasure, but procreation: and therefore after conception do not accompany with them. These women when they wash, haue their sacred linnen garments also, as the men. Thus farre Iosephus: who in his Ios.Antiq lib.18.cap.2. Antiq addeth to these, their opinions of GODS prouidence ruling all things: and that they thinke their Ceremonies more holy then those of the Temple, and therefore send thither their gifts, but do not there sacrifice, but by themselues following the same course of life, which the Plisti Scaliger rea∣deth not Plisti, but Polstae; cal∣led also Ctisae, Scythian Ne∣mades. do amongst the Dacians. Some of these Essenes liued solitary, like to Hermits, as is said before. Happily that Banus was of this sort, to whom Iosephus In vita Ioseph. resorted for imitation. He liued in the wil∣dernesse, cloathing and feeding himselfe with such things as the trees and plants of their owne accord yeelded him, and with often cold washings in the night and day, cooling the heat of lust. With him Iosephus abode three yeares. The Gaulonites or Galilaeans, Galilaeans. had their Ioseph. de An∣tiq. lib. 18.cap. 1. de Bello Iud.lib. 2. cap.7. beginning of Iudas (elsewhere he calleth him Simon) a Galilaean, whose doctrine was, That, Onely GOD was to be accounted their LORD and Prince: in other things they agreed with the Pharisees: but for their libertie they would rather endure any the most exquisite tortures, together with their kindred and friends, then call any mortall man their LORD. Thoudas happily, mentio∣ned,
Act. 5. and that Egyptian, Act. 21. were of this rebellious and traiterous Sect, and those Sicarij which wore short weapons vnder their garments, therewith mur∣thering men in assemblies. That Egyptian Ioseph. de Bel.lib.2.cap.21. Iosephus calls a false Prophet, who vnder pretence of Religion, and name of a Prophet, assembled almost thirtie thousand men to Mount Oliuet: he was defeated by Foelix the Gouernour. Such were their Zelotae in the siege of Ierusalem, vnder the mantle of Religion, all of them harbouring and cloking Treason and villany. The Scribes Scribes. are not a Sect, but a function: of which were two sorts, and, , the one expounders of the Law, the other publike No∣taries or Actuaries, Recorders, Secretaries. Epiphanius maketh difference betwixt the Scribes that were , Teachers of the Law, and the , or Lawyers, which prescribed formes of Law, Law-cases, and taught Ciuill actions. But these are often taken one for the other. Ezra is called a Scribe, whose Pulpit is mentioned, Ne∣hem. 8. and Moses D. Rainolds and Hat. Chaire was the seat of the Scribes; that is, they taught the Law of Moses, which they vsed to do sitting: as CHRIST also did, Mat. 5. 2. Their expositions, Epiphanius Epiph. Haer.15. saith were of foure sorts, one in the name of Moses; the second in the name of their Rabbine Akiba (he is said to haue liued an hundred and twentie yeares, and to be Standard-bearer to Barchozba) the third in Andan or Annan; the fourth after the Assamonaei. But little is to be said of these Scribes, more then what is before said of the Pharisees, this being not a differing Sect, but an Office or Ministe∣rie, whereof the Pharisees also were capable, and are for false teaching blamed by our SAVIOVR, together with the Scribes. The Scribes are said in their expositions D. Hall, Pha∣ris. & Christian. to haue been more textuall, the Pharisees more in their Glosses and Traditions: the Scribes had chiefe reputation for learning, the Pharisees for holines, taking more paines (saith our English Iosephus) to go to hel. The Scribes professed both disputation and obseruation of many things, saith Arias Montanus Ar. Mont. in Euang. Mat. 15. , but not so exact as the Pharisees. For the Pharisees, though not so lear∣ned as the other, thought themselues more holy then them, because they obserued not only those things, which in the common opinion were thought meet, but those things which were least, which the people obserued not, which others had added. This they were ambitious of, as of some great perfection. For there was a threefold state of men, The Doctors, Pharisees, and People of the Land. The prouerb was The people of the Land are the foot-stoole of the Pharisees. The people were tied to obserue the precepts mētio∣ned, or by necessity of consequence drawne out of the Bible. The Pharisees (as is said) added their Traditions. The Scribes manner Ar. Mont.in Marc.1.22. of teaching was cold and weake, consi∣sting in certaine arguments, which rather afflicted, then affected the minds of the hea∣rers; in certain niceties, & scrupulous questions, sometimes inextricable. And therfore the people heard Christ, as speaking with authority, and not as the Scribes. But to let passe these School-mē, & those Canonists let vs come to their other sects & sort of professiōs. The Hemerobaptists Hemero∣baptists. are nūbred by Epiphanius Epiph.her.17. among the Iewish heresies, which, saith he, in other things differ not from the Scribes and Pharisees; but in their doctrine of the resurrection & in infidelity are like to the Sadducees: And euery day in al times of the year they are baptised or washed, whēce they haue their name. But this custome of daily washing, saith Scaliger, Scal. Elench.cap. 31. was cōmon to al the ancient Iewes, which would seeme better thē their fellowes, & not only obserued of the Pharisees, Essees, & Hemerobap∣tists (if such a sect may be added). At this time in Palestina many do it, not once, but often in the day. The Mahumetans obserue it. The Priests whē they kept their courses in the Temple, abstained from wine, and eat not of the Tithes before they had washed their whole body. The Pharisees and Essees composed themselues to this sanctity: the greater part of the Pharisees, and all the Essees abstained from wine, & both vsed daily washings, especially before they ate. And as many heretikes professing thēselues Chri∣stians, retained many things of Iudaisme; so these Hemerobaptists learned them this daily washing. It seemeth by him, that, these were Christiā rather thē Iewish heretikes. And so were the Nazaraeans Nazarae∣ans. also, which some reckon among the Iewish sects, who embraced the Gospell of CHRIST, but would not relinquish their Iudaisme; vnlesse
we say with Hierome, that whiles they would be both Iewes and Christians, they were neither Iewes nor Christians. These Nazaraeans, or Nazoraeans, Scaliger affirmeth, were meere Karraim, Scripture-Iewes, but because of their obstinacie in the Law, the first Councell of the Apostles determined against them. As for the Nazarites of the old Te∣stament, Moses describeth them and their obseruations: Not to cut their haire, not to drinke wine and strong drinke, &c. Such was Sampson. But these could be no Sect, hol∣ding in euery thing the same doctrine with the Iewes, and only, for a time, were bound by vow to these rites. But for those Nazaraeans, Epiphanius Ep ph her.18. maketh them a Iewish Sect, not without cause, if such were their opinions, as he describeth them. Their dwel∣ling was beyond Iordan in Gilead and Bashan, as the fame goeth (saith he) by Nation Iewes: and by obseruing many things like to the Iewes. Herein they differed: They did not eat any thing which had life: they offered not sacrifice: for they counted it vnlaw∣full to sacrifice, or to eat flesh. They disallowed the fiue Bookes of Moses: they indeed confessed Moses, and the Fathers by him mentioned, and that he had receiued the law, not this yet, which is written, but another. Next to these doth Haeres. 19 Epiphanius place the Ossens Ossens. , dwelling in Ituraea, Moab, and be∣yond the Salt or Dead sea: to these one Elxai in the time of Traian ioyned himselfe: he had a brother named Iexai. Scaliger (here and euery where acute) saith Scal.Elenc.cap.27. that the Essens and Ossens are the same name, as being writtē with the self-same Hebrew letters, diffe∣ring only in pronuntiation, as the Abyssines pronounce Osrael, Chrostos. for Israel. Chri∣stus. And the Arabian Elxai, and his brother Iexai, were not proper names, but the ap∣pellation of the Sect it selfe; as he proueth. But they agreed not so well in profession, as in name, with the Essens, for they were but an issue of those ancient Essens, holding some things of theirs, others of their owne: as concerning the worship of Angels, reproued by the Apostle, Col. 2. 21. in which the Essens and Ossens agreed, & other things there men∣tioned, Touch not, taste not, handle not: and in worshipping of the Sunne, whereof they were called Sampsaeans, or Sunners, Sun-men, as Epiphanius interpreteth that name. Those things wherein they differed, were brought in by that Innouator, who (of this his Sect) was called Elxai. He was, saith Epiphanius, a Iew, he ordained, Salt, and Water & Earth, and Bread, and Heauen, and the Skie & the Winde, to be sworne by in Diuine worship. And sometime he prescribed other seuen witnesses; Heauen, and Water, and Spirits, and the holy Angels of prayer, and Oile, and Salt, and Earth. He hated continencie, and enioyned mariage of necessity. Many imaginations he hath, as receiued by reuelation. He teacheth hypocri∣sie, as in time of persecution to worship Idols; so as they keepe their cōscience free: and if they confesse any thing with their mouth, but not in their heart. Thus ancient is that Changeling, Aequiuocation. He bringeth his author, one Phineas of the stocke of the ancienter Phineas, the son of Eleazar, who had worshipped Diana in Babylon, to saue his life. His followers esteeme him a secret vertue or power. Vntill the time of Constan∣time, Marthus and Marthana (two women of his stock) remained in succession of his honor, and were worshipped in that country for gods, because they were of his seed. Marthus died a while since, but Marthana still liueth: Their spittle, and other excre∣ments of their body, those Heretikes esteemed, and reserued for reliques to the cure of diseases, which yet preuailed nothing. He mentioneth CHRIST, but it is vncertaine whether he meaneth our LORD IESVS. He forbids praying to the East-ward, and bids turne towards Ierusalem from al parts. He detesteth sacrifices, as neuer offered by the Fathers: he denieth the eating of flesh among the Iewes, and the Altar, and Fire, as contrary to GOD, but water is fitting. He describeth CHRIST after his measure, foure and twentie Schaeni in length, that is fourescore and sixteene miles, & the fourth part thereof in breadth, to wit, six Schaeni, or foure and twenty miles; besides the thick∣nes, and other fables. He acknowledgeth a HOLY GHOST, but of the female sexe, like to CHRIST, standing like a statue aboue the clowds, and in the midst of two moun∣taines. He bids none should seek, the interpretatiō, but only say those things in praier: (words which he had taken out of the Hebrew tongue, as in part we haue found). His prayer is this, Scaliger thinketh they are three senten∣ces, and not a prayer. Abar, anid moib nochile daasim an daasim nochile moib anid abar selam. Thus Epiphanius relateth it, and thus construeth, I cannot say expoundeth (although
they, like our deuout Catholikes, needed no exposition) Let the humility passe from my fathers, of their condemnation, & conculcation, and labour; the conculcation in condemnati∣on by my fathers, from the humility passed in the Apostleship of perfection. Thus was Elxai with his followers opinionate: otherwise Iewish. Epiphanius speaketh of his sect else∣where often, as when he mentioneth the Ebionites Epiph her. 53. , and the Sampsaeans: This booke both the Ossees and Nazoraeans, and Ebionltes vsed. The Sampsaeans Sampsaeans. had another booke (they said) of his brothers. They acknowledge one GOD, and worship him, vsing certaine washings. Some of them abstaine from liuing creatures, and they wil die for Elxai his posterity; which they had in such honor, that if they went abroad, the people would gather vp the dust of their feet for cures, & their spittle, & vsed thē for amulets & preseruatiues. They admit neither the Apostles, nor Prophets: they worship Water, esteeming it as a god, belieuing that life is frō thēce. Scaliger also affirmeth, that the Massalians Massalians. (which word Epiphanius interpreteth Such as pray, according to the opinion and practise of those Heretikes) were Scal.ele. c.28. first a Iewish sect, and a slip of the Essees, and after by marriages with some false Chri∣stiās, made such a galli-maufrey, as after when we come to speak of the Pseudochristiā sects shall (GOD willing) be related: for of Iewish they became Christian Heretikes. The Herodians Herodians. were Iewes, Epiph.haer.20. otherwise agreeing with the rest; but they thought Herod to be the Messias, moued by Iacobs prophecie falsely interpreted, That the Scep∣ter should not depart from Iuda till Shilo came. When as therefore they saw Herod a stran∣ger to possesse the kingdome, they interpreted as aforesaid. Some make question whe∣ther this was the name of a sect, or of Herods souldiers. Drusius Dus.de 3. see.lib.1.cap.3. obserueth out of a Commenter vpon Persius, Sat. 5. Herodis venere dies, &c. these words, Herod raigned among the Iewes in the parts of Syria, in the daies of Augustus. The Herodians therfore ob∣serue the birth-day of Herod, as also the Sabbaths: in the which day they set lampes burning, and crowned with violets in the windowes. Arias Montanus Ar.Mont in Fuang.Malth.22.16. thinketh that the Herodi∣ans were polititians, that little respected religion. They thought the Common-wealth should be established, and that could not stand without Princes, nor could Princes nourish themselues or theirs without money, and therefore propounded that question to our Sauiour touching Caesars tribute. Others thinke they made hotchpotch of Iu∣daisme and Gentilisme, as Herod had done: in which it is like his succesiors succeeded him. This coniecture is mentioned by Beza, Beza Annot. in Mat.22. who yet rather thinketh that the Herodi∣ans were Herods courtiers, moued thereto by the Syrian translation, which hath de∣beth Hiraudis, Herods domesticals. Thus thinketh Iunius In. in An∣not. Syc. Tran. of them also, who saith that when the Pharisees could not intrap him in the Law, they sent their disciples to que∣stion him of Tribute, hauing before agreed (which vsually they did not) with the He∣rodians to stand by (vnknowne) as witnesses, if he had answered any thing, whereat Caesar might haue been offended. And this seemeth most likely: for after Herods death, how could they hold him for Messias? Another sect amongst these of the Circumcisiō, Eusebius Euseb.hist. Eccles l.4. c. 21. out of Hegesippus nameth the Masbothoaei Masbothaei. or Masbotheani; for Thebulis (saith Hegesippus) was of their number, which arose out of seuen sects in the Iewish people: Which sects had their begin∣ning Symon, of whom the Symonians: and Cleobius, of whom the Cleobians; Dositheus, of whom the Dositheans; and Gortheus, of whom the Gortheans; and Masbotheus, of whom the Masbotheans. And from the same fountaines issued the Menandrians, Mar∣cionists, Carpocratians, Valentinians, Basilidians, and Saturnilians. And a little after, There were diuers sects amongst the Israelites; Essees, Galileans, Hemerobaptists, Mas∣botheans; Samaritans, Sadducees, Pharisees. The word Masbothaet, Scaliger Scalig. Elenc. cap.3. saith, signifieth Sabbatists, or Sabbatarians, be∣cause they professed to haue learned the obseruation of the Sabbath from CHRIST, and therein differed from the other Iewes. He there nameth (and little else haue we but their names, euen the name also of the wicked shall rot) diuers other sects; if they may beare that name: as the Genites Genites. or Genists; which stood vpon their stocke and kindred: the Merissaeans Merissaeans. or Merists, which were (as the name importeth) sprinklers of their holy-water: the Hellenians Hellenians. , of Hellenius: the Cleobians Cleobians. and Theobulians Theobuli∣ans. wee can but mention. Of the
Tubiens Tubiens. as little, saue that they are said to be a Colledge or fellowship: and lesse of Ganaei. Ganaei, and such like, if there be any other names that remaine as the rotten bones of the consumed carkasses of heresies and heretikes: and either are vnknowne, or degene∣rated into some or other sect of pseudo-christians, which require another taske. The Coelicolae Coelicolae. were Iewes, Scal elench. triber. Serar. c.31. but corruptly embracing, Christianitie, for they were Massalians, which had their houses or places of prayer abroad in the open ayre, of whom Iunenal is vnderstood, Nil praeter nubes & coeli lumen adorant. So Scaliger rea∣deth, not numen: & Petronius, Iudaeus licet & porcinum nomen adoret, Et coeli summas ad∣uocet auriculas. These also were an oft-spring of the Essees: and from these proceeded the Massalians. They being baptised, reuolted to their former Iudaisme, and bearing the name of Christians, retained the rites of those Coelicolae, or Heauen-worshippers. The Cannaei. Cannoei were a deuout Societie & order, giuen to holines of life, and obseruati∣on of the Lawe: of whom was Simon Kannaeus, Mat. 10. called Zelotes, the inter∣pretation of the former as Beza. Annot. in Mat.10. Beza, Scal. El.c.1. and Scaliger shew. Suidas calleth them obseruants of the Lawe, whom Ananus shut in the Temple. Their  or Mourners Mourners. were such as lamented with continual fasting, praying, and weeping, the destruction of their Citie, See.cap.10. Temple and Nation: as else-where is said. CHAP. IX. Of the Samaritans. IT remaineth to speake of the Samaritane Sects. Samaria was the Citie royall of the ten Tribes, after that Omri (who, as other his predecessors, had raigned before at Tirzah) had bought the mountaine Shomron 1.Reg.16.24. of one Shemer, for two Talents of siluer, and built thereon this Citie, which hee called after the name of Shemor, Lord of the Mountaine. In vaine therefore is it to seeke the name of the Samaritans from the signification of the Epiph.haer.9. chytr.Onomast. word (which is keeping) seeing they were so called of the place, and the place of this their ancient Lord. It remained the chiefe seate of the kingdome as long as the same indured, and namely till the dayes of Hosheae their last King, in whose time 2.Reg.17. Salmanasar the Assyrian carried the Israelites thence. Esarhaddon the son of Se∣nacherib, otherwise called Osnappar (thus saith Hezra: Ezr.4.2.10. and therefore Epiphanius was deceiued in ascribing this act to Nabuchodonosor in the time of the captiuitie fortie yeeres before the returne) sent to inhabite that region, Colonies from Babel, and from Cuthan, and from Aua, and from Hannah, and from Sepharuaim. Babel is knowne: Cutha and Aua Tremel.annot. in Reg. 2.17. Iosephus thin∣keth Cutha to be Persian. are esteemed parts of the desert of Arabia, the other of Syria and Me∣sopotamia. It seemeth that most of them were of Cutha, because all of them after pas∣sed into that name, and were of the Iewes called Cuthaei, as witnesseth Iosephus. Ioseph.Antiq. l.9.14. & l.11.4 These heathens serued not the LORD, and therefore the LORD sent Lyons a∣mong them which slew them: Wherefore they sent to the King of Assyria, who sent thither one of the captiued Priests of Israel to teach them how to worship GOD (Epi∣ohanius, calleth his name Esdras. The He∣brewes cal him Dosthai, as Dru∣sius citeth. Se∣nacherib sent to Samaria R. Dosthai, the son of Iannai to teach them the Lawe. Drus.l.3. de sec.c.4. Ter∣tullion cals him Dositheus and so doth Hierom, fathering the Samaritan sect on him. ) He dwelt at Bethel: and as some conceiue, taught rather that idolatrous worship, whereof Bethel had before been the Beth-auen, where Ieroboam had placed his golden Calfe, then the true worship of the True Iehonah. Howsoeuer, euery Nation (saith the Text) made them Gods, & put them in the houses of the high places, which the Samaritans had made. The men of Babel made Succoth Benoth: and the men of Cutha made Nergal, and the men of Hamath, Ashima: and the A∣vims, Nibhaz, and Tartak: & the Sepharusaims burnt their children in the fire to A∣drammelech, and Anammelech their gods. Thus they feared the LORD, and ser∣ued their gods after the manner of the Nations, and so continued: a mungrell re∣ligion begotten of a bastard or haereticall Iudaisme, and wilde paganisme. What those gods vvere, it is vncertaine, and interpreters agree not. Of Succoth Be∣noth is spoken L.1 c.13. already: Wolphius interpreteth Wolph. in 2. Reg.17. Nergal a wilde hen, Ashima a goate, Nibhaz a Dogge, Tartak an Asse, Adramelech a Mule, Anaemelech a Horse: thus (saith he) the Hebrewes expound them: and he supposeth these creatures vvere
among them Canonized and sacred: as the Persians are said to worship a Cocke; the Proembari of Africa, a Dogge: other people, other creatures. Thus their Religion continued till after the returne of the Iewes from captiuitie, to whom they would haue beene officious helpers in building of the Temple: which being refused they became their enemies, and hindred the building a long time. Ezra.4. But the Temple being built, and religion established among the Iewes, and their state flourishing, Sanballat gaue Ios.Antiq.11.7. his daughter Nicaso to Manasses, the brother of Iaddus the High Priest, in the time of Darius the last Persian Monarch. This Nehemia mentioneth, but deigneth not to name him, affirming that he chased him from him, of which some Wolph. in Nehem. descant whether it were by exile, or excommunication, or some other punishment. R. Salomo interpre∣teth it of exile, Pelican of excommunication. Drusius Drus.de 3.sec. l.3.c.2. hath a discourse out of a Iewish Author, which relateth the forme of that first Anathema and iudiciall curse, (not vnmeete heere to be mentioned) denounced a∣gainst the Samaritans for hindring the worke of the Temple. Zorobabel and Ioshna (saith he) gathered all the Congregation into the Temple of the LORD, and brought three hundred Priests, and three hundred Trumpets, and three hundred bookes of the lawe, and as many children, and sounded. And the Leuites singing and playing on in∣struments cursed with all kinds of Anathema's the Chutheans, in the secret of the name Tetragrammaton, and in Writing written vpon tables: and with the Anathema of the house of the higher iudgement, and the Anathema of the house of the lower iudge∣ment, that none of Israel should eate the bread of the Chuthean (wherevpon it is said he which eateth a Samaritans bread, be as he that eateth swines flesh) and that a Chuthe∣an should not be a Proselyte in Israel, nor should haue part in the Resurrection of the dead. This they writ, and sealed, and sent vnto all Israel which were in Babylonia, which heaped vpon them Anathema vpon Anathema. That, concerning their becom∣ming proselytes, Drusius doubteth whether it may not bee translated, that a stranger Chuthaean should not abide in Israel: which is more likely. The other had been more im∣pious: their zeale to make proselytes of all Nations is knowne. To returne to Manasses, Iosephus saith that the high Priest and the Elders put him from the Altar, who therefore went to Sanballat his father in lawe, and told him that he loued his daughter well, but would not for her loose his Priesthood. Sanballat re∣plied, that if he would retaine his daughter, he would not onely maintaine him in his Priesthood, but procure him a high Priests place, and make him Prince of all his pro∣vince: and would build a Temple like to that of Ierusalem in mount Garizin, which looketh ouer Samaria, higher then the other hils, & that with the consent of K.Darius. Hereupon Manasses abode with him, and many Priests and Israelites being intangled with like mariages reuolted to him, and were maintained by Sanballat. But now Alex∣ander preuailing against Darius, Sanballat (whose Religion was Policie) rebelled, and tooke part with Alexander, and in reward thereof obtained leaue to build his Temple, whereof Manasses enioyed to him and his successors the pontificall dignitie. Then was the Circumcision diuided, some (as said the Samaritan woman) ub.4.20. worshipping in this mountaine, others at Ierusalem. The Zeale which the Samaritans had to their Temple appeared Ios Antiq.l.13.c.6. in the time of Ptolomens Philometor, when at Alexandria Sabbaeus and Theodosius, with their Samaritans, contended with Andronicus and the Iewes, these challenging to Ierusalem, those to Garizin, the lawfull honour of a Temple, both par∣ties swearing by GOD and the King, to bring proofe of their assertion out of the law; and beseeching the King to doe him to death that should not make his part good: and thereupon the Samaritans failing in proofe, were adiudged to punishment. The Samaritans in the prosperitie of the Iewes professed themselues their kinsmen & allies: in aduersitie disclaimed them, & their GOD also, as appeareth Antiq.l.12.c.7. in their Epi∣stle to Antiochus that figure of Antichrist & persecutor of the Iewish religion, in which they call themselues Sidonians dwelling in Sichem, and say, that moued by ancient su∣perstition they had embraced the Feast of the Sabbath, and building a Temple of a namelesse Deity had offered therein solemne sacrifices: whereas therefore their origi∣nall was Sidonian and not Iewish; pleased him to enact that their Temple might beare
name of Iupiter Graecanicus, and they might liue after the Greekish rites. These things Antiochus easily granted. Hircanus by force tooks both Sichem and Garizin. Two hundred yeares after the foundation of this Temple, as testifieth Iosephus, Ant.l.13 c.17. hapned this desolation thereof. The zeale yet continued as appeareth by many testimonies of Scripture. The Iewes medled not with the Samaritanes, which made the Io.4.9. woman wonder that CHRIST asked drinke of a Samaritane. Another time the Samaritans would not receiue him because his Luk 9.52 behauiour was as though he would goe to Ierusalem, for which fact of theirs the sons of thunder would haue brought lightning frō heauen vpon them. And the Iewish despite could not obiect worse in their most venemous slander, then, Iob.8.42. Thou art a Samaritane. This Ierusalem-iourney through the Samaritans countrey caused bloudy warres and slaughter betwixt the Galileans Ios.Antiq.l.20.5. & them, in the time of Cumanus, to the destruction of many. And before that in the daies of Pilat, a cousning Prophet abused their zeale, bid∣ding them to assemble in mount Garizin Antiq.l.18.c.. with promise there to shew them the sacred vessels, which, said he, Moses had there hidden. Wherevpon they seditiously assembling, & besiedging Trabatha, Pilat came vpon them with his forces, & cut them in peeces. Their opinions (besides those aforesaid) were, Epiphan. har. 9. that onely the fiue bookes of Mo∣ses were Canonicall Scripture, the rest they receiued not. They acknowledge not the Resurrection, nor the Trinitie: and in zeale of one GOD, abandon all idolatries, which it seemeth was receiued of them after the building of the Temple, and mixture with the Apostata Iewes; the Scripture testifying otherwise of their former deuotions. They wash themselues with Vrine, when they come from any stranger, being (for sooth) pol∣luted. And if they haue touched one of another Nation, they diue themselues, garments and all, in water. Such a profanation is the touch of one of another faith. They haue a dead corps in abhomination presently. The Samaritan Drs.de3.sect.l.2. if he meeteth a Iew, Christian, or Mahumetan, he saith vnto them, Touch me not. Scaliger, out of the Arabian Geographer, scal.de Em. Tm.l.7. telleth of an Iland still inhabi∣ted with these Samaritans, in the red Sea, which appeareth by their custome, when any comes on shore, forbidding to touch them. This arrogant superstition remaineth with them. The Samaritan Chronicle is cited by Eusebius Chron. graec. l., 1. Scal.Annot.in Eus. Chron & in Isag.Can. Scaliger saith he had a copy of their Chronicle translated out of Hebrew into Arabian: it differeth somwhat from the Hebrew account. The Iewes confound the Samaritans and Sadduces, as if they were but one Sect. The difference hath appeared, for the Sadduces accept all the Bible; the Samaritans, Moses onely. The Sadduces denied the soules immortalitie and reward. The Samaritans in their Chronicle acknowledge both a place of reward, & pu∣nishment after this life. But whether they beleeue the Resurrection or no, he doubteth. The Sadduces deny spirits, Angels, Diuels; the Samaritans confesse them. The Samari∣tans also vse still those ancient Letters called Phenician, which the Hebrewes vsed be∣fore the captiuitie, which who so lisleth to view, let him see their Characters, and Sca∣ligers large notes thereon in his Annotations vpon Eusebius Chronicle. The Samaritans were diuided also into diuers sects, as Epiphan. Epiph.hare.13 rehearseth: one whereof were called Dositbeans. Dositheans: if it be lawfull to reckon them Samaritans, which acknowledged (as Epiphan. acknowledgeth of them) the Resurrection of the Dead. They abstaine from such things as haue life: some of them from Mariage after they haue beene before maried, and some continue in Virginitie. They obserue Circumci∣sion and the Sabbath: and they touch no man, but hold euery man in abhomination. Report goeth also of their fasting and exercises. They had name of Dosithens: who being a Iew, and hauing well profited in their law, but not receiuing promotion sutable to his ambition, reuolted to the Samaritans, and hatched this sect amongst them. And when afterwards in a singularitie he had gone a∣side into a Caue, and there mewed vp himselfe, and persisted in hypocrisie & fasting, he there died (as the fame goeth) through his wilfull want of bread and water. After a few daies, some resorting to him found his dead body crawling with wormes, and compas∣sed with flies. § Of this name Dositheus there were diuers. Drus.de 3.sec.l.3.6. Two of them liued af∣ter
the comming of CHRIST. One a lew, sonne of R. Iannai, the other a Samaritan which endeuoured to perswade his countreymen that hee was the CHRIST which Moses had prophecied of, as Orig.cont.Cels.l 2. Origen reporteth, and saith: of him are the Dositheans named. Another is mentioned in Iohasin.Ab. zach. Iohasin, who liued in the time of CHRIST, the dis∣ciple of Sammai. And before these was another Dosthai, the sonne also of Iannai, of whom it is said in Lib.Ilmedenu Ilmedenu, that Senacherib sent R. Dostha to Samaria to teach the Samaritans the lawe. This seemeth to be he, whom before out of Epiphanius wee haue called Esdras, the first founder of the Samaritan heresie. And so Tertullian Ter.prescrip. aduers.aer.lc1. saith of him; Dosubeus the Samaritan, was the first that reiected the Prophets, as not hauing spoken by the HOLY GHOST. The like testimonie Hierom giueth of him. His colleague and companion is said to be one Sebua, the supposed Author of the Sebvaeans. In Ilmedenn Ap.Drus.pag.260. he is called Sebaia: or Sebuia. Orig.de prin∣cip.4.c.2. Dositheus also taught, that how and in what position of body he was in the Sabbath morning, in the same he ought to continue all that day, without change of gesture or place: that if he did sit, he should sit in the same place all day long, and so of lying or other habite of body. The Authour of this Dosithean sect, (properly so called) liued, as Scaliger Scal. Elench. Serarij.tribaer.15. thinketh, about or at the destruction of the Tem∣ple, and could not be that first Dustai or Dosthaei. The Sebuaeans Sebuaeans. you haue heard, in Drufius opinion, haue their name of Sebuia, the companion of Dosthai, sent by Senacherib, or rather by Esarhaddon: which if it be so, it seemeth this sect is auncient, haply nothing differing from the other Samaritans. E∣piphanius maketh a difference, Epiph.haer.11. but the cause he alledgeth, was the Iewes refusall of their helpe at Ierusalem, which was common to all the Samaritans. The difference he alledgeth is the transposing of their solemnities (for that quarrell betwixt them and the Iewes) from the Iewish times, so that they kept their Passeouer in August (which they made the beginning of their yeare) Pentecost in Autumne, and that of Tabernacles, when the Iewes kept their Passeouer: neither might they sacrifice in Garizin, obseruing such differing solemnities. Scaliger Scal.Canon. Isagog.l.3. pag.218.219. (whom I shame not thus of∣ten to name, in relation of these things too intricate for mine owne, or for common wits to finde) both in his Treatise against Serarius, cap.1. & 21. and in his Canons Isagog. l.3. dissenteth from Epiphanius: saying, that they dissented not from the other Samaritans, but that the name was a common name, which the Iewes ascribed to the Samaritans: It signifieth  Weekers: which name they gaue them because that euery weeke betweene the Passeouer and Pentecost, they obserued that day of the weeke, in which the computation of the fifty dayes began, with as great solemnitie as the feast of Pentecost it selfe. This day, from which the reckoning began, was called the second, because it was the next day after the Azyma or Feast-day. But the Samaritans reckoned the second after the Sabbath, and so in all that space of fiftie dayes, kept the first day of the weeke, that is, Sunday, holy. Thus they kept seuen Pentecosts in a yeare. And perhaps (hee but coniectureth) as they had these imagi∣narie Pentecostes, so they might at other times of the yeare haue such imaginarie solemnities of other Feasts. From that word  the second day, and next to the Feast of vnleauened bread, the Sabbaths, saith Scaliger in the same place, were cal∣led in order, the first  the second Sabbath after that day, and so the rest: and thus he expoundeth those words of Luke c.6.v.1. se∣cundo-primum Sabbatum, that is the first Sabbath after that  or first day of the fif∣tie which began to be reckoned the next day after Easter till Pentecost. A place hither∣to very obscure. Epiphanius doth number for Samaritane sects, The Essens, Esseni. of which is before shewed that they were Iewes, and otherwise heretical and idolatrous in respect of their morning-deuotions to the Sunne, for which it seemeth they might not, (cer∣taine they did not) communicate with other Iewes in the Temple and sacrifices. These pertaine not to this place; as not Samaritanes. A fourth Samaritane sect he accounteth the Gortheni, Gortheni. or Gortbaieni. which differed from the rest, at least from the Sebuians, in keeping their solemnities, Paschall, Pentecost, and of Tabernacles at the Iewish times, and obserued but one day holy: as likewise the fasting day.
CHAP. X. The miserable destruction and dispersion of the Iewes from the time of the desolation of their Citie and Temple to this day. THE Curse threatned vnto this superstitious and rebellious Nation, Deut.28.28. Madnesse, blindnesse, astonishment of heart, to grope at noone dayes as the blinds gropeth in darknesse, to bee a wonder, aprouer be, and a common talke among all people, among which they should be scattered from one end of the world to the other, is this day fulfilled in our eyes, both in respect of their Politie and Religion, Gods iust iudgement sealing that their owne imprecation Mat.27.25. his bloud be on vs, & on our children, and pursuing them in all places of their dispersion through the reuolutions of so many ages. Odious are they, not to the Christians alone, but to the heathen people that know not GOD: P. Galat.l 4. c.28. Bidalph.letter. nor will the Turke receiue a Iew in∣to the felowship of their Mahumetane superstition, except he hath passed first from his Iudaisme through the pargation of a Christian profession, vnto that their no leste ridi∣culous and miserable deuotion. 1.Thes.2.15. GOD they please not (saith Paul) and are contrary vn∣to all men. This their wretchednes although it seemed to begin, when Herode a stran∣ger seased their state, yet was that infinitely more then recompenced, when their Mes∣siah, so long before prophesied and expected, came among his owne, but his owne re∣ceiued him not: yea, they crucified the Lord of glory. But euen then also did not the long-suffering GOD reiect them, CHRIST prayed for them, the Apostles preached to them remission of this and all their sinnes, till that (as Paul chargeth them) they Act.13.46. putting these things from, and iudging themselues vnworthy of eternall life, GOD remooued this golden candlesticke from amongst them to the Gentiles, and let out his Vineyard to other husbandmen. Famine, sword, and pestilence at once assailed them. (And what shall not assaile what will not preuaile against the enemies of GOD?) Ie∣rusalem, sometimes the glory of Earth, the type of heauen, the citie of the great king, and mother citie of the Iewish kingdome, from this incomparable height, receiued as irre∣couerable a fall, besieged and sacked by Titus, and yet more violently tortured with inward convulsions and ciuil gripes, then by outward disease, or forraine hostilitie. Io∣sephus and Iosippus Ioseph. de Bel∣lo.Iud & Anti∣quit. Iosippus Hebr. both Englithed haue handled the same at large, both which can acquaint the Eng∣lish Reader with the particulars. Besides many thousands by Vespasian and the Romans slaine in other places of Iudea, Ierusalem the holy Citie was made a prison, slaughter∣house, and graue of her owne people. First had diuine mercy Euseb.bist. Eccles.l.3.c.5. by Oracle remoued the Christians to Pella out of the danger, that without any impediment the floud-gates of vengeance might be set wide open for Desolations black guard to enter. Here might you see the strong walles shaking and falling, with the pushes of the iron ramme; there the Romans bathing their swords in Iewish entrailes: here the seditious Captaines dis∣agreeing in mutuall quarrels, written in bloud; there agreeing in robbing and burning the Citie, and in slaughter of the citizens: here hunger painted with pale colours in the ghastly countenances of the starued inhabitants; there, died in red with the bloud of their dearest children, which the tyranny of famine forceth to re-enter into the tende∣rest-hearted mothers wombe, sometime the place of Conception, now of buriall: Eue∣ry where the eye is entertained with differing spectacles of diuersified Deaths', the Eare with cries of the insulting Souldiour, of the famished children, of men and wo∣men, euen now feeling the tormenting or murthering hand of the seditious: the sent re∣ceiueth infectious plague and Contagion from those humane bodies, with inhuma∣nitie butchered, whom no humanitie buried: the taste is left a meere and idle faculty, saue that it alway tasleth the more distastefull poison of not-tasting and emptinesse: what then did they feele, or what did they not feele? where all senses seemed to bee reserued that they might haue sense of punishment? vvhere all outward, inward, publike, priuate, bodily, ghostly plagues were so ready executioners of the Diuine sentence. The continuall sacrifice first ceased for want of Priests of the last course, to vvhom in order it had descended; after for want of a Temple before
polluted with Ethnicke sacrifices, and murthers of the Priests and Souldiors, and lastly ruined, the sacred vessels thereof being carried to Rome for ornaments of the Temple of Peace which Vepasian had there Ios. de Bel.Iud. l.7.c. 14. erected. Eleuen hundred thousands are numbred of them which perished in this destruction: The remnant that escaped the Romane sword, for the most part, perished after in wars, or killed themselues, or were reserued either for solemnitie of triumph, or (if they were vnder seuenteene yeares of age) sold vnto perpetuall slauery. Iosep.de Bell. Ind.l. 7.c.17. 97000, of these Iewish slaues were numbred: Galatinus P. Galat de Atcan.l. 4 c. 21. accounteth 200000. And that the hand of GOD might be the more manifest, they which at their Passeouer-feast had crucified the sonne of GOD, are at the same time gathered togither in Ierusalem, as to a common prison∣house of that whole Nation: and they, which had bought CHRIST of the Traitour Iudas for thirty peeces of siluer, were sold thirty of them for one peece. Galatinus tels of two false prophets, whom, comming in their owne name, they receiued for their Mes∣sias, hauing before refused IESVS that came in his fathers name: both these were called Ben-or Barchosba, that is, the sonne of lying. Sanhedrin. lib.s. Helech. R Muse ben. Maimon. The one, not long after the passion of CHRIST, (if the Iewes be not the sonnes of lying which write it) the other in the time of Adrian, Rabbi Akiba, (famous for his wisedome, for his 24000. Disciples, and for his long life) receiued both in their succeeding ages: and interpreted to the first, that place of Hag. 2. 7 8. Haggai, I wilshake the heauens, &c. But afterward they slew him as the Talmud witnesseth, which also affirmeth Tractat. Meg∣hila. that Titus enioyned the Iewes which he suffered to remaine, that from thence they should no more obserue Sabbaths, nor abstaine from menstrous women. Fortie eight yeares after the destruction of Ierusalem the Iewes made the Citie Bit∣ter Bethoron. to be their chiefe Citie, and rebelled by the perswasion of Bencochab (so he cal∣led himselfe) that is the sonne of the Starre. Of him did R. Akiba (which had been ar∣mour-bearer to the former) interpret Talmud. Iero∣sol.l. Taanith. that prophecie of Balaam, Num. 23. There shal arise a Starre of Iacob. Adrian then Emperour besieged them in Bitter, (where if you beleeue the Iewish Tract. Bee∣ressith rabb. fables) were 80000 which sounded Trumpets, euery one of them Captaines of many bands, which helped Barcosba, (so they called him after) that is, the sonne of lying, who had 200000, souldiours, which to testifie their loue and valour had cut off euery man a finger from his hand. After three yeares and sixe monethes the Citie was taken, and Lib.Echa. rabbethi. this their Messias slaine, together with such multitudes that the bloud reached to the horses mouthes, and carried downe great streames vvith the streame thereof, running to the Sea foure miles from Bitter. And Adrian had a Vine∣yard eighteene miles square, which he hedged with those slaine carkasses, as high as a man can reach (a reacher I thinke.) There were two Riuers Lib.Masse∣abeth Gitlin. in the region of Ieri∣co, and the third part of them by estimation of the Wise-men was the bloud of the slaine: and seuen yeares together did the people of the Gentiles satten and harten their Vines, onely with the bloud of the Iewes. Adrian slewe also at Alexandria in Egypt, 700000. Iewes. Dion Niceus Dion. Nicaei Adrianus. (a more credible Author) affirmeth that Adrian sent Senerus against the Iewes, who in regard of their multiudes would not try it with their ioynt forces in set battell, but taking his occasions and best opportunitie, proceeded more slowly and more surely: tooke fiftie of their fortified Castles, rased nine hundred and fourescore of their best townes, slew at sundry times 580000. of their men, besides innumerable mul∣tudes, which perished of famine, sicknesse, and fire, these gleanings being greater then the other haruest. Salomons sepulchre by falling downe had fore-signified this their downefall: and Hyaena's and Wolues prodigiously entering their cities, seemed to howle their Funerall obsequies. All Iudaea was left almost desolate. Euseb. bist. Eccles.l.4.c. 6. Niceph.l. 3.24. Caes.Baron.anal. Eusebius out of Ariston Pellaeus addeth, that Adrian prohibited the Iewes by an Edict to come neere to Ierusalem, or once from any high place to looke towards the same, or the region ad∣ioining. We haue already shewed how he destroyed this Citie, and built a new (the present Ierusalem) called of his owne name Aelia. He made swine ouer the gates of this new Citie, which images were most faithfull porters to prohibite the Iewes (faith∣fully superstitious in their faithlesse superstitions) to enter. And as he had erected a tem∣ple
to Iupiter, in, or neere the place where the Temple had stood, so (to afflict the Chri∣stians also) he built another Temple of Iupiter in Golgatha, and of Venus at Bethleem, which continued till the time of Constantine. The Christian Iewes gained by this losse: for when as they might not come to Ierusalem, they afterwards relinquished their wonted Iewish ceremonies. This was the end of Barchosba. And such is the end of all which fight against God and their Soueraigne, their arrowes which they shoote against the clouds fall downe vpon themselues: he proues a falling Starre, which be∣ing but a groser elementarie exhalation, is eleuated by his owne aspiring course (not to the firmament, but) to some higher region of the ayre, where it shineth with the fire which burnes it, and moueth with some short glaunce, till with selfe-ruine it retur∣neth (whence it had beginning) to the Earth. Thus haue we seene the Iewes banished their countrey (about the yeare 135.) a∣greeing to which their miserable Estate was that order of men, mentioned by Ios.Scal.Llenc. triher.Ser.c.13. Scali∣ger called  Mourners, Heraclitus his heires, which spent their time in wee∣ping, and intended nothing but Lamentation for the Desolation of their Sanctuarie. These haue beene among the Iewes (saith he) euer since this destruction, and vvere once a yeere, on the ninth day of the moneth Ab, allowed entrance into Ierusa∣lem by Adrians Edict,. And it is written in an auncient Iournall of Burdeaux, Itinerarium Burdegal. that not farre from the Images there is a stone boared through, to which the Iewes come yearely, and annoint it, lamenting grieuously, and renting their garments, and then depart. Beniamin Beniamin. (an Hebrew Author) relateth of these Mourners that they giue Tithes of all which they possesse to the Wise-men, alway sitting in the Schoole, and to the humbled Israelites and deuout persons which lament Sion, and bewaile Ierusa∣lem. These dwell in Caues, or in ruined houses, fasting all the dayes of their life, ex∣cept on the Sabbaths and Festiualls, beseeching mercie continually at the hands of GOD, touching the banishment and deportation of Israel. And so let them mourne which refuse Luc.2.11. the glad tidings of great ioy to all people, that vntovs is borne IESVS a Sauiour, which is CHRIST the LORD. But yet what rockie heart can but mourne with them, and for them, thus made spectacles to the world of bodily & spirituall misery, which both in these times men∣tioned, and (before) in the time of Traian, and in all ages since, hath pursued them in all places of their habitation, if that name may be giuen to this world-wandring and vagabond-people? In the time of Traian, Euseb.li.4.c.2 Adrians predecessour, the Iewes had rebelled in Egypt, and Cyrene, where they committed much outrage and mischiefe, vnder one Luke their captaine, against whom the Emperor sent Martius Turbo, who destroyed many thousands of them; and fearing that the Iewes in Mesopotamia would doe the like, commanded Lucius Quietus to destroy them vtterly; in recom∣pence of which seruice, executed to his minde, hee made him President of Iudaea. Dion Dion.N.Tra∣iaus. saith, That the Captaine of the Iewes was named Andrew, and that they slue many Greekes and Romans, did eate their flesh, girt themselues with their guttes, were imbrewed with their bloud, and clothed with their skinnes; many they sawed asunder, from the crowne downewards, many they cast to the beasts, and many were found to kill one an other with mutuall combats, so that two hundred and twenty thousand persons perished by this vnspeakeable cruelty. In Egypt and Cy∣prus, vnder their Captaine Artemion they destroyed two hundred and fortie thou∣sand. They were subdewed by Traians Captaines, specially by Lucius: and it was made a capitall crime for a Iew (although forced by tempest) to set foote in Cyprus. Africa was repeopled (where they had destroyed) with new Colonies. No maruel if the Romans (thus prouoked) both in the time of Traian & Hadrian destroied so ma∣ny thousands of them. Iulian afterwards gaue them leaue to returne into their coun∣trey, and rebuild their Temple, more for hatred of the Christians, then for loue to their Nation: whose wickednesse and answerable successe herein is plainly detected and detested by Gregorie Nazianzene, Greg.Naz.Orat.4.cont.Iuliaen. and other Fathers, as Cap.3. we before haue re∣lated. To adde further of their bodily confusions and illusions of their bewitched minds:
Nicephorus mentioneth a Pseudo-Moyses of the Iews in the parts of Arabia destroy∣ed by the forces of the Empire, together with his Complices in a like rebellion. So∣crates Socr.li.7.c.37 describeth a further madnesse of theirs (for true is that saying of Saint Paeul. That they which will not beleeue the Truth, are giuen ouer to strong delusions to be∣leeue lies.) In the Ile of Creete was Anno 434. a false prophet, that affirmed himselfe to be Moyses, which led the Israelites through the red Sea, and to bee sent from heauen to those Iewes to conduct them through the red Sea, into the continent of the Ho∣lie Land. This hee perswaded them for the space of a whole yeere, going from ci∣tie to citie: and at last induced them to leaue their riches to them that would take them, and to follow him: at a day appointed hee went afore them vnto a Promon∣torie of the Sea, and there biddes them leape in; which many obeying, perished in the waues, and many more had perished, had not some Christian Merchants and Fishers beene at land, which saued some, and forbade the rest to follow. The Iews seeking to be reuenged of this counterfeit Moses. could no where finde him: and therefore thought him to be some Deuill in humane shape, which sought their de∣struction, and thereupon, many of them became Christians. Of their miseries sustained in all places of their abode, all histories gaue mention. And yet their superstition is more lamentable then their dispersion, as also their per∣tinacie and stubbornenesse in their superstition. And certainely mee thinkes, that euen to him that will walke by sight, and not by faith, not obliging his credite to meere authoritie, as the case standeth betwixt vs and the Scriptures, but will bee drawne by the cords of Reason onely and Sense, euen to such a one mee thinkes this Historie of the Iewes may be a visible demonstration of the truth of Christian Religion: not onely because the truth of the prophecies of Genesis 49. Iaacob, of Deut.28. Moses, of Esa.6. Esay, and other the Prophets is fulfilled in them; and because GODS iustice still exacteth the punishment of the betraying and murthering that Iust one; but especi∣ally in this, that the bitterest enemies, cruellest persecutors, and wilfullest haters that euer were of the Christian truth, are dispersed into so many parts of the world, as wit∣nesses of the same truth; holding and maintaining to death the Scriptures of Moses and the Prophets; then which, euen Reason being iudge (as is said before) we will not desire sounder and fuller proofes of our profession. Neither is our Gospel where∣in we differ from them, any other then the fulfilling of their Lawe: and CHRIST came not to destroy the Lawe, but to fulfill the same. In him the Promises, in him the Figures, in him the righteousnesse of the Lawe, righteousnes in doctrine, righ∣teousnesse in practise, righteousnesse of doing, righteousnesse of suffering, to satis∣fie the debt, to merite the inheritance, are the witnesses, that in him they are all, yea and Amen, haue receiued their perfect being and accomplishment. But .Cor. 3.15. the veile is ouer their hearts; eyes they haue and see not, eares and heare not: They holde out to vs the light of the Scripture, themselues walking in darkenesse, and reserued to darkenesse; like to a Lampe, Lanthorne, or Candlesticke, communicating light to others, whereof themselues are not capable, nor can make any vse. But to returne, to consider further of their dispersions. Wee haue shewed how they were vtterly cast out of their Countrey: and Italie, and the Empire was filled with Iewish slaues. Nor was this their first dispersion: but as the Aslyrians had car∣ried away the other tenne Tribes, whose of-spring, as is thought, about the yeare of our Lord God, one thousand two hundred, founded that mightie Empire of Ca∣thay; so the Babylonians carried away the two Tribes remaining, which might haue returned vnder the Persian Monarchie; but many remained in those Countries till the dissolution of that Iewish state, and after. They had a famous Vniuersitie at Babylon, which indured till the yeere of CHRIST one thousand three hundred (so writeth Boterus. G. Botero Ben., Terza part.libr. 2. ) At which time they fleeing the persecutions of the Arabians dispersed themselues into India, where many are found at this day. These, through continuall conuersing with the Gentiles and Christians, haue small knowledge of the Lawe, and lesse would haue but for other Iewes, that resort thither out of Ae∣gypt. Before that time also, if wee beleeue the Aethiopian Historie, twelue thou∣sand
Damian a Goes. Ludonic. Car. Iewes (of each Tribe a thousand) went with the Queene of Saba's sonne, which they say she had by Salomon, into that countrey, and there remaine their po∣steritie to this day. Thus is Asia and Afrike fraught with them, but Europe much more. Adrian Boter. Ibid. banished fiue hundred thousand into Spaine, where they multi∣plied infinitely, and founded an Vniuersitie at Corduba, about the yeare of our Lord one thousand: and at Toledo was a Schoole of twelue thousand Iewes, about the yeare of our Lord, one thousand two hundred thirtie and sixe, as writeth Rab. Mosche Mik. apud Ruxd. ca.1. Rabbi Mosche Mikkotzi: from hence it seemeth they swarmed into England and France. Their miseries heere in our Land indured, are by our Authors mentioned Fox Act and Monuments. Historie of well &c. in the dayes especially of king Richard the first, and King Iahn; and the whole Land gaue a fift part of their goods to King Edward the first to banish them, Ann. one thousand two hundred ninetie and one. Out of France they were thrice banished by three Philips although in Auinion there still remaine some of them. Being expelled France, they sought habitation in Germany, where Conradus the Emperour admitted them into the countrey of Sue∣uia: and thence they flowed into other parts, into Bohemia (in the citie of Prage, are about fifteen thousand of them) and into Austria, and into Hungaria, whence, for the crucifying of a childe, they were banished by King Mathias: as at Trent for the like fact, and poysoning of Wells, they sustained much trouble in Germanie: and many passed to Venice; many also went from thence into Russia (where the people cannot abide to heare them named) and Poland, where Cassimere the Great for loue of an Hebrew Lasse, gaue them many priuiledges. They liue dispersed in the townes and villages, occupied in handicrafts, and husbandry. They haue great Synagogues in Cracouia, Leopolis, and at Trochi, a towne of Lituania: and Maister Barkeley a Merchant of London, who hath spent many yeeres in Liuonia, Polonia, and other of those colde countries, told me, That the Iewes farme the Custome of the Kings, and at Samaiden in Curland one of these Iewish Customers beat out the braines of a Polonish Merchant, for deferring to open his packe: but in regard of the peo∣ples hatred, prouision is made, vnder great penalties, for their securitie; and yet many Iewes were there executed by occasion of a murren, procured (as was suspe∣cted) by Iewish exorcismes intending a plague to the men, and not a murren to the beasts, if their working had sorted: but the Iewes said it was but a pretence to de∣priue them of their riches. They heere in Poland print what Bookes they list. They were cast out of Spaine by Ferdinand and Isabella, in the yere, one thousand foure hundred ninetie and two. It is thought Ioannes Reu∣clinus Cabal.l.1 saith 420000. persons. Ghachami. , that there went out of Spaine a hundred and twentie thousand families of them (besides Moores) and out of their kingdomes of Naples and Sicill. Hence they passed An∣no Domini one thousand fiue hundred thirtie nine, into Tuscane, and the Popes Do∣minions, whence they were banished by Paul the fourth, and Pius the fift; and re∣ceiued againe by Pius 4, and Sistus the fift; Rome and Venice hauing great store of them. This is the Popes holinesse: hee that would not willingly indure a Prote∣stant in the world; besides the Stews vnder his Holinesse nose, can indure the Grae∣cians: yea and these Iewes, Rome it selfe hauing tenne thousand, or, Relat. of Rel. West. after others reckoning, twentie thousand of them priuiledged, with their fine Synagogues, Li∣turgies and publike Sermons; and to straine vp their Vsurie to eighteen in the hun∣dred: hauing also in some places (it may be in all) a peculiar magistrate to decide controuersies between Christians and them, with particular direction to fauor them in their trade. Dulcis odor lucriex requalibet The beastly trade of Curtisans and cruel trade of Iewes is suffered for gaine, these paying a yearely rent for the heads they weare, besides other meanes to racke and wracke them in their purses at pleasure, they being vsed as the spunge-like Friers, to sucke from the meanest, to be squeezed of the greatest; insomuch that the Pope, besides their certaine tribute, doth some∣times (as is said) impose on them a Subsidie for tenne thousand crownes extraordi∣narie for some seruice of State. So well is the rule of Paul obserued by this Bishop, not to be a louer of filthie lucre. Out of Spaine they went into Barbarie and diuers other Countries, and some into
Portugal: where Iohn the second made them pay eight crownes for a poll, and yet limited them a short time of departure. Emanuel his successor did the like 1497. ex∣cept they would become Christians, for which hee assayed diuers meanes. But not preuailing, he caused their children, vnder the age of foure and twenty yeares, to be baptised; some rather hurling their children into pits, some killing themselues: ma∣ny for feare were baptised; some went into Italie and abode in Ferrara, Mantua, Ve∣netia, in the name of Maranes, and haue a Synagogue at Pisa. But the greatest part of them went into the East to Constantinople and Salonichi, in which two Cities there are about a hundred and sixtie thousand of them. There are of them in all the chiefe Cities of traffike in the Turkish Empire. Theatrum vrbim Ad. Ro. Tyberias is wholly inhabited with Iewes, which City Zelim gaue to Gratiola a Iewish matron. In Ierusalem there are about a hundred houses of them. There abide not many, because of a superstiti∣ous opinion, That before the Messias shall come, a great fire from heauen will con∣sume that Citie and Country, to purge it of the abhomination committed there by profane Nations. At Zante they are so hated, that from Mawndy Thurseday vntill Saturday noone, they dare not come abroad: for the people, in a foolish zeale, would stone them: and some refuse to eate of their meate or bread. The Turkes in their reproach vse such a kinde of imprecation; If this be not true, would GOD I might die a Iew. The old Testament is read of them in these parts in the Hebrew Let.Bidulp. , but their Cakamins and Cohens, that is, their Wise-men and Priests preach in Spanish. Only at Salonichi (anciently Thessalonica) in Macedonia, and at Safetta in the Ho∣lie Land, (two Vniuersities) they speake Hebrew. They will rather in blasphemie testifie their hatred of CHRIST, then be able to dispute. CHAP. XI. A Chronologie of the Iewish Historie from the beginning of the world, briefly collected. THe Floud happened (as Moses reckoneth the parcells in the Ages of the Patriarchs) in the yeare of the world 1656, 1656. which are thus ac∣counted. Adam at the 130 yere begat Seth. Seth at 105 begat Enos. Enos at 90 Kainan. He at 70 Mahalaleel, who at 65 begat Iared. Ia∣red being 162 yeares old begat Henoch, who at 65 begat Methuse∣lah: and he at 187 begat Lamech, who in his 182 yeare begat Noah: in the six hun∣dreth yeare of whose life the Floud came. The second age of the world is reckoned from the Floud to Abraham: whose birth was after the Floud 292 yeares: Sem two yeres after the Floud begat Arphac∣sad. He at 35 yeres Selah, who in his thirtieth yeare begat Heber. Heber at 34 Peleg, who being thirty yeres old begat Regu, and he at 32 Serug, in whose thirtieth yeere Nahor was borne, who at 29 begat Terah, who at 70 yeares begat Abram. Thus Scaliger; Calnisius, Buntingus, Arias Mont. Genebrard, Pererius, Adrichomius, Op∣meerus, &c But Iunius, Bronghton, Lydyat, Codomannus &c. adde 60 yeares more. For Moses saith, Gen. 11. 32. That Terah died in Charan, aged 205 yeres, and then Abram (as it is in the next chapter) was 75 yeres old; so that Terah, when Abram was borne, was 130 yeres old. Whereas therefore he is said at 70 yeres to beget Abram, Nabor, and Haran; it is to be vnderstood, that he then began to beget: Ano mundi 008. Abram borne. Abram being na∣med first for diuine priuiledge, not because he was eldest. The like phrase is vsed Gen. 5. 32. Noah being fiue hundred yeres old, begat Shem. Ham, and Iaphet: and yet nei∣ther were they all borne at once, nor was Shem the eldest; let the Reader chuse whe∣ther of these opinions he best liketh. In the 75 yeere Abram went out of Charan, hauing receiued the promise: from whence, to the departure of the Israelites out of Aegypt, are numbred 430 yeares. Rather herein we are to follow Pauls interpretation of Moses, then Genebrards, who Gal. 3. 17. accounts those 130 yeres mentioned by Moses, Exo. 12. 40. from the pre∣mise
made to Abraham, and not from the time that Iacob went downe with his fami∣lie into Egypt. So that the departure out of Egypt, after Scaligers computation, and some others, Perkins, Adrichomius &c. hapned in the yere of the world 2453; where∣to if we adde those sixtie yeres of Terahs life before mentioned, it amounteth to 2513. And so Broughton reckoneth. Iunius and Lydyat account 2509. The difference seemes to arise from hence, that one accounteth from Abrams departing out of Vr of the Chaldees; the other from his departure from Haran after his fathers death about fiue yeres after. But it were an endlesse work to reconcile Chronologers in their different computations. Some reckon the 25, Ios.Scaliger annot.in Euseb. Scaliger the 15 of Aprill, the day of their depar∣ture. And then the Hebrews beganne their yere at the Spring Aequinoctiall, which before they beganne in Autumne. From this departure, to the building of Salomons Temple, Ios.Scaliger De Em.T.libr.5. 2933. Lydyat, 2988. Scaliger reckneth 480. yeeres, whose first foundations (he saith) were laid the 29 of Maie, being Wednesday; Anno Mundi 2933, and of the Great Iulian Period (which differeth 764 yeares from the yeare of the world) 3697. In this computation of 480 yeares betwixt the de∣parture and foundation of the Temple, many Chronologers agree, Arias Montanus, Adrichomius, Broughton, Perkins. Lydyat, &c. although some dissent much. The summe ariseth of these parcells. Moses died fortie yeres after their deliuerance. Io∣shua ruled seuenteene; Otbonicl forty; Ehud foure score; Gedeon forty; Abimelech three; Thola twenty three; Iaer twenty two; Iephte six; Ibsan seuen; Elam ten; Abdon eight; Sampson twentie; Heli forty; Samuel and Saul forty; Dauid forty; Salomon in the fourth yere and second month began to build his Temple, after which he raigned thir∣tie seuen yeares. An.M.3360. From thence to the destruction of the Temple vnder Zedekids are accounted 427. This agrees with Ezek.4.5. Lydy.3417. Ezekiels account, reckning a day for a yere, 390 daies of yeres after the apostacie of Israel frō God, the rebellion against the house of Dauid in the begin∣ning of Rehoboams reigne, by the means of Ieroboam; to which if we adde 37 yeares which Salomon reigned, after the foundation of the Temple, the summe is 427. The same appeareth thus; Roboam reigned 17 yeres; Abiam three; Asa 41; Ichoshaphat 25; Iehoram eight; Ahaziah one; Athaliah six; Ioash forty; Amazia 29; Azaria or Vzzia 52. Betwixt Amazia and Azaria the kingdome was ruled eleuen yeres by the states, as some gather out of 2. Reg 15. 1. (others reckon it not.) Iotham 16. Abaz sixteene, Ezekiah 29. Manasses 55. Amon 2. Iosias 31. Iehoahaz three months; Eltakim or Iehc∣iakim eleuen yeeres; Iehoiachin 3 months; Zedekiah or Mattaniah eleuen yeres. The little difference from the former number may be ascribed to the current and vnfini∣shed yeres of some of their reignes. From this time of Sedekias ruine, some begin the reckoning of the seuentie yeeres captiuity; in which time others comprehend all Sedekias reigne, and account the re∣turne vnder Cyrus to be fifty nine yeres after this desolation; and from thence 108. to the Edict of Darius Nothus; from which time are numbred 259 to the Dedication of Iudas Maccabeus; and from thence 162 yeres to the birth of CHRIST. So Scal, de Em. libr.7. Scaliger. It were a worke irksome to my selfe, and tedious to the Reader, to recite the varia∣ble opinions of Chronologers, or to trauerse their arguments about these points. To recite here their high Priests and later Kings, with the time of their pontificali∣tie and reigne, out of Arias Montan. I holde not vnfit. First Iesus returned with Zorobabel, & built the Temple, whose time of priesthood, after Scaliger, Iunius, and those that reckon vpon the Edict of Darius Nothus, must needes be very long They which list to see the varietie of opi∣nions of Iew∣ish, Greek, La∣tine, old and new Chrono∣logers, may see Genebr.chron. lib1.in fine. Likewise, see our 4. Booke chap, 4. . To leaue that therefore, his son Ioacim Ioseph.Antiq. & Car.Sigo.de republ.bebr.lib.5. haue set downe the ca∣talogue of hie Priests, from the first to the last. succeeded in the priesthood 28. yeares, besides twenty yeares, with his father. Eliasib held the priesthood 41 yeres; Ioiada 25; Iona∣than 24; Ieddoa 27. till the time of Alexander; Onias 27, after Philo; but Eusebius saith 23; Simon Iustus 13; Eleazar twentie; Manasses twenty seuen; Onias thirtie nine. Afterwards the Syrian Kings appointed high Priests: of whom, Iason was Priest 3 yeares; Menelaus twelue yeres; in whose seuenth yere, Iudas Maccab. began to ad∣minister the common-wealth. Ionathas brother of Iudas ruled eighteen yeres; Simon his brother was both Priest & Captaine eight yeares; Ioannes Hircanus his sonne 31.
Aristobulus, son of Hircanus, first after the captiuitie called himselfe King, & reig∣ned one yere; Ioannes Alexander his brother 27: after him, his wife Alexandra nine; Hircanus her son, three months; Aristobulus his brother, three yeres. Ierusalem was ta∣ken of Pompey and Hircanus recouered the Priesthood, which he held 22 yeares; An∣tigonus by aid of the Parthians possessed Iudaea fiue yeres; and in his second yeere He∣rod was proclaimed King by the Romans, who tooke the citie the fift yeare of Anti∣gonus, and reigned foure and thirtie. Scaliger ascribeth Can.Isagog.l.2 to Herods kingdome the number after Eusebius account, rec∣koning from the birth of Abram 1977; he died 2016. Archelaus his sonne was made, by Augustus, Tetrarch of Ierusalem 2016, and was banished 2025. Agricola was made King by Caligula 2053. Agrippa his sonne, by Clandius 2060, and died 2116, thirtie yeares after the destruction of the Temple. The Dynasty of the Herodians lasted 139 yeares. Thus Scaliger. He attributeth the natiuity of CHRIST to the 3948 yere of the world. Heere we must leaue the Chronologers contending of the yeare of the world, in which this blessed Natiuitie hapned; some adding many more yeares, some not al∣lowing so many. It is certaine by the Scripture, that he was borne in the 41 or 42 of Augustus; baptized in the fift of Tiberius, then beginning to be about thirty yeres of age: in the 33 yeare he was crucified. In the 72 as Baronius, and 71 yere of CHRIST, as Buntingus, & Liuely account, Ierusalem was destroyed by Titus, in the second of Vespasian. Ar. Mont. reckoneth this the yere of the world 3989, and saith, that the Hebrews reckon it the 3841, which must needes be false. The fault ariseth from the false computation of the Persian & Graecian monarchies Ios.Antiq.lib. 0.18. . Iosephus counteth from the time of Herod, to the destruction of the Temple. 28 high Priests, and 107 yeeres. Af∣ter Scaliger in his Can. Isag. li. 3. this yere 1612 is the 1614 of CHRIST, of the world 5561, after the Iewish account of Hillel 5372, of the Armenians 1061, of the Iulian Period 6325, of the Hegira 1021; Anno 4. Olymp. 597. CHAP. XII. Of the Iewish Talmud, and the Composition and Aestimation therof: also of the Iew∣ish learned men, their succession, their Scriptures, and the translations of them. RAbbi Mosche Mikkotzi, R. Mos. in Se∣pher.mitzuos gadol. in a Worke of his, set forth anno 1236, as Buxdorfius citeth him, Synag.Iudaic. Buxd. latine reddit.ab Herm. Germberg. c.1. saith, That the Written Lawe which GOD gaue to Moses, and Moses to the Israelites, is obscure & hard, because it speaketh some things contradictory (which he seeketh to prooue by some places Exod. 12. 15. Deut. 16 3.& Leuit.23. 6 Ex. 19. 11. & Exod. 20. 22. &c. mis-interpreted) & because it is imperfect, and contai∣neth not all things meet to be knowne. For who shall teach vs (saith he) the notes of Birds and Beasts? (a Franciscan might answer him Legend of Saint Francis, where hee is said to preach to the beasts and speake to the Swallowes &c. out of the Legend of S. Francis, the Patron of this Order) who shal teach them the propriety & nature of points, and accents, and of letters? also, what fat might be eaten, what not? &c. Many such things are defectiue in the Law, and therefore there is need of some other Expo∣sition of the written Law, whence these things might be learned. This Exposition (for∣sooth) must be their Talmud, the generation of which viper, touched before, we will here more fully declare. They say, that Moses on mount Sinai was not with God 40 daies and 40 nights, to keepe geese. And God could haue written those Tables of the Law in an houre, & sent him away with them; so to haue preuented that Idolatrie with the golden Calfe. But God brought Moses into a Schoole, Pircke seu capita R.Eliczer ca.40. & there gaue him the Law in writing, first, and then in all that long time expounded the same, shewing the cause, manner, measure, foundation, and intention thereof in the true sense. This vnwritten and Verball Law did Moses R.Aben Eora R.Salom.I , & alij in Deut. 4 14. teach Ioshua; he, the Elders; from these it was deriued to the Prophets. After Zachary and Malachy, the last of these, it came to the great Sanhedrin: and af∣ter them, by Tradition, from father to sonne. And R.Bechai Ex∣od.34. Rabbi Bechai saith, That Moses learned the Lawe written, in the day time;
and this Traditionall Law by night: for then hee could not see to write. Rabbi Mosche Mikkotzi sheweth the cause why GOD would deliuer the same by mouth onely, and not in writing, lest (I wisse) the Gentiles should peruert this, as they did the o∣ther which was written. And in the day of Iudgement, when GOD shall demand who are the Israelites, the Gentiles shall make challenge, because of the Law written, but the Iewes onely shall be accepted, as hauing this Simani, this verball exposition. GOD also (say they) gaue them Chachamim, Wisemen, authors of diuers ordinan∣ces amongst them, as to blesse GOD at the Sunne-rising, and Sunne-setting; and of Schooles where children should be taught the Law of Moses in euerie Citie, and where the Law of Moses should be read weekely: and that the Israelites should not eate or drinke with the Gentiles, nor what they had dressed; after the example of Da∣niel Dan.1. 8. &c. But when the Temple was destroyed, and the Iewes carried away captiues, then a∣rose vp Rabbi Iuda Hannasi, who is called (for his humilitie and godlinesse) Our great Master; to whom GOD procured such fauour in the eyes of Antoninus the Empe∣rour, that he had authoritie to assemble out of all places of the Empire the most lear∣ned Iewes, to consult in this their almost desperate estate, what course to take for the preseruation of the Law amongst the people. And although this Kabala or Law, giuen by word of mouth, might not be committed to writing; yet in consideration, and commiseration of their miserie, whatsoeuer thereof was remaining in memorie, hee writ in a booke which he called Mischna, that is, a Deuteronomie , or Law reiterated, containing sixe summes, diuided into sixtie lesse parts or tractates, and these into 532. chapters. Thus farre R. Mikkotzi. In this booke were contained the Traditions and Ordinances of the Elders, accor∣ding to the prescript whereof, the Iewish Synagogue was to bee ordered: and it was receiued and approued of the Iewish Synagogue, Chron Heb. Tzemach Da∣uid in the yeare of CHRIST 219. The Talmud is (in manner) nothing but a commentary on that Misna: a worke full of diuine, natural and politicall wisdome, saith Golatinus, of the parts ther∣o see his first booke. chap.5. 10. Picus saith it was composed about the yeare 150. Others, say in the yeare 120. Io. Wolf. Section. Memorab. C. n∣tenar. 2. Some yeares after, Rabbi Iochanan, Rector of the Vniuersitie of Ierusalem for the space of eightie yeares, enlarged that booke, and called it the Talmud of Ierusalem, which for the difficultie and obscuritie thereof was not had in such estimation as the former, nor is it at this day. After him, Rabbi Asse read in the Schooles those Tra∣ctates, handling euery yeare two of them; so in the sixtie yeares of his Rector-ship, he went twice through it all; but finished in writing onely fiue and thirtie Tractates. After him in the yeare Pet. Galat. hath 436. 427. Maremar was made Rector, to whom Mar the sonne of Rabbi Asse adioyned himselfe. These perfected that which Rabbi Asse had left vnfinished. And that which they thus added was called Gemara, or the complement. Thus the Mischnatos, and Gemara made vp the whole Talmud Talmud is the same that Do∣ctrina, or disci∣pliatio. . These two spent in their labors threescore and thirteene yeres. And so in the yere of our LORD 500. the Talmud was perfected, receiued for authenticall, and called the Babylonian Talmud, according to which the Iewes, to this day, behaue themselues in cases spirituall and temporall. And this is that Law verball, or deliuered by word of mouth, which is equalled to the other, without which the written Law cannot be conceiued or vnderstood: The ioy of the heart (saith Aben Ezra Ab Ezra in Prooem. Penta∣teuch ) and refreshing of the bones; betwixt which and the written Law he can find no Sic Tridenti∣na Synodus sel. 4. dec. 1. vt dein. difference, but being deliuered to them from their Elders. In one of their bookes, Semok, vel Sephar mitzvos katon R. Isaac. printed at Cremona, 1556. is this sentence. Thinke not that the Law written is the foundation, but rather the Law Traditionall is the right foundation: and according to this Law, did GOD Exod.34.27. make couenant with the Israelites, for GOD foresaw their captiuity in time to come, and therefore lest the peo∣ple, among whom they should dwel, should write out & interpret this Law, as they did the other, GOD would not haue it written. And although in processe of time this Law be now written, yet it is not explained by the Christians, because it is hard, & requireth a sharp wit. That which is spokē of the Law, is applied to cōmend their Talmud: If you can frustrate (saith the LORD) my Couenant with the Psal.1.2. Esa.59.vlt. Ierem.33.25. day & the night, that is, according to their book Tanchuma, whē you wil no longer learne & obserue the Talmud. And in
the Tract it. Ba∣uamaziab. Talmud is thus recorded: To studie and reade in the Bible is a vertue and not a vertue, that is, a small vertue: but to learne their Mischna or Talmud-text is a ver∣tue worthie reward: and to learne by heart Gemaram (the complement of the Tal∣mud) is a vertue so great that none can be greater. Hence it is that their Rabbines are more exercised in their Talmud, then in the Bi∣ble: as on which their faith is founded more then on the other: and according to this doe they expound the Scripture. And as their Talmud is most certaine, so also is that (whatsoeuer) exposition of their Rabbines, according to the same. Thus saith Rabbi Isaac Abhuhabh, whatsoeuer our Rabbines in their Sermons and mysticall explanations haue spoken, wee are no lesse firmely to beleeue, then the Law of Moses. And if any thing therein seeme repugnant to our sense, wee must impute it to the weakeneste of our conceit, and not to their words: as for example, it is written in the Talmud, Tract. de Sab∣bal. c.2.pa.30. that a Rabbine once preached, that the time would come, when a woman should euery day bee deliuered of her burthen: according to the saying, Ie∣rem. 31. 7. Concepit statimque peperit. One not beleeuing this, the Rabbine answered that hee spake not of a common woman, but of a henne, which should euery day lay an egge. Such are their expositions, I know not, whether fitter to be heard of Heraclitus, or Democritus, more lamentable or ridiculous; and yet is it there said, that their words are the words of the liuing GOD, whereof not one shall fall to the ground; and must not be derided either in word or thought, whether ye respect the persons, or workes of their Rabbines. Therefore in a Dutch booke printed in Hebrew characters at Cra∣couia, 1597. it is written, that the Iewes are bound to say Amen, not onely to their Prayers, but to all their Sermons and Expositions, according to the Prophet Esay, Cap.26.2. Open the gates, the people commeth (schomer amunim) which keepeth righteousnesse: that is (say they) which saying Amen, beleeueth all things which the wise Rab∣bines haue written. And if any be so simple, that he cannot vnderstand, yet must hee heleeue. When two Rabbins (saith their Talmud) maintaine contrarie opinions, yet must not men contradict them, because both of them hath his Kabala or traditi∣on for the same: and this is a rule in their Rabbines, Remember rather the word of the Scribes, than of the Lawe of Moses. R. Salomon Iarchi vpon Deutero∣nomie chap. 17. verse 12. Thou shalt not decline from the word that they shall shew thee, to the right hand or to the left, hath these words; And when hee saith vnto thee of the right hand, that it is the left; and of the left hand, that it is the right a R. must be beleeued, though he say the right hand is the leit. , thou must beleeue it: how much more if hee saith, the right hand is the right hand, &c. They haue a Storie in their Talmud tract. de Sabbal. Legend for the same, That there camea Goi a Gen∣tile to Sammai, and asked him, how many Lawes they had, who answered, two, a Written and a Verball. Hee replied; The Written Lawe I acknowledge no lesse then thou: make mee therefore a Iew, and teach mee the other. Sammai refused: and hee went to Hittel, (these both liued a little before the time of CHRIST) who admitted and instructed him; after hee bade him pronounce the Letters in order, Aleph, Beth, Gimel, &c. which hee did. The next day he bade him say the same Letters backward, Gimel, Beth, Aleph. The Gentile said, Rabbi, yester∣day you taught me otherwise: And yet said Hillel you beleeue mee, and so learne of me; which you must no lesse doe in the traditionall Lawe, beleeuing all that is therein. I had almost thought in reading of this Hillel, I had beene reading the life of Ignatij vita lib.3.cap.7. Ignatius Loiola the Iesuite-founder (so like is the Storie, though the names dif∣fer) who practised himselfe, and trained vp others, Adsapientem hanc sauitam∣que stultitiam caecae, vtipse appellabat, obedientiae, saith Maffaeus in a large Dis∣course hereof: PAVLS Omnia probate was in these daies; but prudentiam non obedient is, sed imperantis esserespondit Ignatius: negabat obedient is nomine dignum haberi oportere qui legitimo superiori non cum voluntate iudicium quoque submitteret: in superior iussis
examinando esse arrogantiam. And this wise and holy folly of blind obedience is with all rigour obscured still in his followers who submit their mindes and iudgements, as well as affections, to their superiours in all things. And what more could old Hellel say to his disciples? Or doth GOD himselfe exact? Bernard, throughout his seuenth Epistle, teacheth more soundly of the Pope, and those religious Superiours; Bern.epist.7. Nec di∣co praepositorum mandata esse à subditis iudicanda, vbinibil inhere depraehenduntur diuinis contrarium institut is. Sed necessarium esse dico & prudentiam qua aduertatur, siquid ad∣uersetur, & libertatem qua ingenuè contemnatur. Hanc ego nunqu ins aemuler obedienti∣am: talem nuhi nunquam libe at modestiam, vel potius molestiam imilari. Talis siquidem obedientia omniest contempt is deterior: talis quoque modestia vltra omnem modum exten∣ditur, —O patientia, omni digna impatientia! But to leaue this question and our Ie∣suites till fitter time; the Iewish Rabbines auerre, that whosoeuer mocketh or con∣temneth their sayings, shall bee punished in hot and boyling Zoah, or excrement in hell. And thus much of their Talmud, the originall, and authoritie thereof. More modest yet were those Fathers of Trent, Self 4.dc.1. Paripietatis as∣sectu & riue∣rentia traditio∣nes vna cum libris veteris & Noui Testamen∣ti sulcipimi.s & vencramur. that would ascribe but equalitie of reue∣rence and respect to their Traditions with the Scripture, which must needes ac∣knowledge themselues beholding to them; left they complaine they follow not their Traditionaire Masters in making them fit lower: and they haue their Anathema as readie as the Rabbines their Zoah; and their Traditions, Canons, and Constitutions, must interprete as well as their Kabala. But before wee leaue their Talmud (thus highly esteemed amongst them) I thought meete also to speake more largely, both of that, and of their learned Rabbines, out of Petrus Galatinus, who thus writeth thereof. The Galat. de dr∣canis lib 1. per totum. Traditionall Law they call Tora scebeal pe, that is, the Law which is in the mouth, or deliuered by word of mouth. Rabbi Moses Aegyptius telleth the passages thereof thus: Ioshua receiuing it of Moses, deliuered it to Phineas, the sonne of Elea∣zar the Priest: Phineas, to Hels the Priest: hee, to Samuel the Prophet: Samuel to Danid: hee, to Achias the Prophet, who deliuered the same to Elias, the teacher of Elisha: Elisha or Elisaus to Ioiada the Priest: this Ioiada, to Zacharias; Zacharias to Hosea; and hee, to Amos; Amos, to Esay; of whom Micheas receiued it, and of him Ioel; Nahum from him; and from him againe, Habacuck, who taught it Se∣phanie, the instructer of Ieremie, of whom Baruch the Scribe learned it: Baruch taught it Ezya. Vntill this time the Iewes had none other but the written Scrip∣ture. Now for their Scriptures: they call the same Arabaa Veesrim (that is, the foure and twentie) of the D. Whitak.de script qst. c.6. Sheweth that the Iewes ac∣coūted so ma∣ny bookes of the Bible, as they had let∣ters, in the Al∣phabet, to wit, two and twen∣tie, he alled∣geth authors of this number two and twen∣tie, and the conceit there∣of Gregor.Naz. Hilary, Cyrillus. Hierosol Epiph. Hieron. Isidorus, Niceph. Leenti∣us, &c. The reason of this difference, E∣piph. hares.8. sheweth, that some of the bookes were double, and therefore him∣selfe numbreth seuen & twen∣tie, or rather, saith he, two and twentie, according as more or fewer were thus rec∣koned coge∣ther. And in lib.de Mens. & pond. he hath the same. Ruth is, saith he, rec∣koned with the booke of lud∣ges, Nehemia with Ezra, and Samuel, Kings & Chronicles, are not diui∣ded. number of the bookes after their computation, all which they re∣duce to foure parts. The first of which they call Tora, the Law, or Humas, the Pen∣tateuch or fiue bookes: and call euery booke after the first words in the beginning thereof. The second part hath foure bookes; Ioshua, Iudges, Samuel, and Kings. The third part comprehendeth foure other, which they call the last Prophets; Esay, Iere∣mie, Ezekiel, and the booke of the twleue smaller Prophets. The fourth part is called Chetuuim, and hath eleuen bookes, Paralipomenon or Chronicles: the Psalmes; the Prouerbs; Iob; Ruth; Ecclesiastes; Lamentations; Canticles; Ester; Daniel; Ezra, which they make one with Nehemia, Ecclesiasticus, Iudith, and Tobias, and the first booke of Maccabees they haue, but reckon not among the foure and twentie. The third and fourth bookes of Ezra I haue not seen in Hebrew; but some of them say, that they are lately foundat Constantinople: But the second of Maccabees, and the booke of Philo (called the Wisdome of Salomon) I neuer saw but in Greeke, nor those additions to Daniel. But after the Babylonian captiuitie, Ezra writing out the Law, which had beene burned in the destruction of the Citie, other wise-men writte out the Exposition of the Law, left, if another destruction should happen, the same might perish. And from that time, all the Wise-men, which are called the men of the Great Synagogue, in their teaching the Law, deliuered the same both in word, and writing, vntill the Talmud was written. These mens authority hath the next place to the Prophets. And are in this order
mentioned in their Talmud. Ezra deliuered the same to Simon the Priest called Iad∣dus, who was honored of Alexander. This Simon deliuered this explanation to An∣tigonus; Antigonus to Iosephus the sonne of Iohn, and to Iosephus the sonne of Iohezer: They to Nitaeus Arbulensis, and Ioshua the sonne of Peratria, whose auditour the Iewes falsely affirme that IESVS, our blessed SAVIOVR, was, which liued an hundred and ten yeares after. Those two deliuered the same to Iuda the sonne of Ti∣baeus, and Simon the sonne of Sata: These to Samaia and Abatalion: and they to Hil∣lel and Samaeus. Hiliel flourished an hundred yeares before the destruction of the se∣cond Temple; and had eightie schollers or disciples, all of excellent wit and learning. Thirtie of them, for their excellence, had the Diuinitie descending vpon them as Mo∣ses: and other thirtie obtained, that the Sunne should stand still for them, as Ioshua: The rest were accounted meane. Of these, the greatest was Ionathas son of Vziel, the least Iohn the sonne of Zachaeus, which yet knew the Scripture and Talmud, and all things else to the examples of Foxes, and Narrations of Diuels. Hillel and Samaeus deliuered this explanation to this Iohn, and to Simeon the Iust, sonne of the said Hillel, who after Luke2.28. receiued CHRIST in his armes, and prophecied of him in the Temple. Rabbi Moses proceedeth, and saith that Simeon taught Gama∣liel, Pauls Master; and Gamaliel instructed his sonne Rabban Simeon, who was slaine of Hadrian the Emperour, after hee had taught his sonne Iudas, whom the Iewes for his learning and holinesse call Rabbenu Haccados, (that is, our holy Master) of which honorable name there had beene another in the time of the Roman Con∣suls. These for the most part, besides almost infinite others of their hearers, haue left many things written of the explanation of the Law; of which the Talmud was compacted. Of the Authentike Authors of the Iewes before CHRISTS time, Galatinus fur∣ther addeth the threescore and twelue Interpreters, who are said by Ptolomies direction to be separated in threescore and twelue cels, or seuerall roomes; and each interpreting by himselfe, did all agree in words, order, and time of their translation, exactly. Calendar. Iud. apud Ios. Scalig. see cap.6. But howsoeuer Iosephus, writing in Greeke, boasteth of this translation, yet the Iewes (I know not whether of enuy at the effect thereof among the Christians) keepe the eight day of Tebeth fasting, for griefe of that Greeke translation. Iesus Sirach mentioneth his Grand-father and other writers. And an hundred and sixty yeares before CHRIST flourished Aristobulus, a Iew, and Peripatetike Philosopher: who by Ptolomoeus Philo∣metors perswasion writ Commentaries on Moses, and spake many things of the Messi∣as: as did also Rabbi Iodam, and R. Ibba not long after: and after them, R. Simeon ben lohai. After these, Rabbenu Haccados writ a booke called Gale-razeya, that is, the re∣uealer of secrets, very diuinely vttering many things of CHRIST. The like did Rabbi Nahumias sonne of Haccana, both expounding the Prophets, and affirming that the Messias was to come within fiftie yeares; and writ an Epistle therof to his sonne, of whom he hoped that he should liue to see him. About the same time (two and fortie yeares before CHRIST) Ionathas the sonne of Vziel, and scholler (as I said) of Hil∣lel, translated all the old Testament into Chaldee, and expounded the same so, that it might seeme rather a Glosse and exposition, then interpretation. This the Hebrewes call Targum, that is, the Translation, which hath with them no lesse credit then the text it selfe, and thereby expound all hard places of the text. They tell therefore, that at that time wherein he laboured this worke, if a Flie or such creature did flie ouer him or his paper, presently, without any harme to the paper, it was consumed with fire from Heauen. And although his translation of the Pentateuch be most rare, yet I once saw it: for that which is most common was the worke of Ankelos a Proselyte, whom the Hebrewes affirme to be the sonne of Titus the Emperour, who also turned all the Bible into Chaldee, and is of no lesse reputation with the Iewes, then the for∣mer, and is also called Targum. After the Times of CHRIST, Philo and Iosephus are famous: and after the resurrection of CHRIST, the Iewes were of three sorts; some true beleeuers, others ab∣solute denyers, the third would haue the Christian Religion and the Iewish Ceremo∣nies
to be conioyned in equall obseruation; against which third sort the first Councel, Act. 15. was summoned. The moderne Iewes insist principally on the literall sense of Scripture; the Elder sought out a spirituall and mysticall sense, accounting this a great matter, the literall, but small, like to a candle, with the light whereof, the other (as a hidden pearle) is found. The Talmudists followed the allegoricall sense; the Cabalists, the Anago∣gicall. As concerning this Cabala, in old times they communicated not that skill to any, but to such as were aged and learned; and therefore nothing thereof, or verie little, is found written of the Ancient, except of Rabbi Simeon Ben Iobai. But the Doctors of the later Iewes, lest that learning should perish, haue left somewhat thereof in wri∣ting, but so obscurely, that few know it, and they which doe, account it a great secret. Amongst the Christians, Iohannes Picus began first to suspect, and spie it, as afarre off. After, Paulus Israelita, Augustus, Instinianus, Capnio, Aegidius Viterbiensis writ thereof. Thus much out of Galatinus his first booke, De Arcanis: Gal. de Ar∣canis. Mor. de verita∣te C. R. out of whom, and out of Philip. Mornaeus, they which please, may borrow arguments to conuince the Iewish incredulitie, and stubbornenes, and to confound them by their owne testimo∣nies, both from these elder Writers aboue mentioned, and also from the later, both compiled in their Talmud. So great is the Truth, and so mightily it preuaileth, that it extorteth not onely her owne weapons, vsurped and stolne by her enemies: but their owne also, wherewith they come armed against the Truth, and retorteth them on theselues; as Dauid serued the Philistims: 1. Sam.17.51. Who cut off Goliahs bead, with Goliahs sword: as 1. Chro. 11.23. Benaiah (one of his Worthies) slew an Aegyptian, a man of great stature, fiue cubites long, and in the Aegyptians hand was a speare, like a Weauers beame; and he went downe to him with a staffe, and plucked the speare out of the Aegyptians hand, and slew him with his owne speare. Thus did Q. Curt.l.9. Dioxippus the Champion (if forrenners delight any) deale with Horratus the Macedonian in a set combate: and thus hath our D. Morton. Apolog-catho∣lica, &c. Worthie and Champion come often into the field against the Popish Giants, armed inwardly with Truth, outwardly with Arguments, wrested (without wresting) from his ene∣mies. Hee, in his Latine, and English workes, hath obserued the two-fold rule of Policie; Diuide and Rule, against the Papists: Vnite and Rule, for the Protestants: Which Brerely would haue brought into the like briers. But those his troopes are shewed not to bee men, but apes; like those that held Alexanders armie in suspence: and like Semsramis Elephants, which were but stuffed oxe-hides, kill-cow-frayes. But Macte virtute esto (worthie Deane) Euen so goe on still, and fight the Lords battels: that thy Sparta (so happily vndertaken) still adorne, and shew the confusion of Babels bab∣blers, Diuide that societie, which now in their last age haue hissed with their forked, venemous Tongues; feared and enuied at home, for their arrogance, no lesse then hated abroad, for their heresies and treasons. Let Saint Iohns, Let England, and the whole Church still sing the ten thousands, that thou doest thus slay with their owne weapons; and let the Apostoticall Truth escape, whiles her apostaticall enemies, the Pharisees and Sadducees, are set toge∣ther by the eares. A happie and Diuine stratageme, which (not to detract from others iust prayses, in this or other parts of the battell) had beene singled, and singularly managed by thy prowesse, which speakest (more iustly then hee which vsed those words) to these Babylonians, 2. Reg. 18.27. in their owne language, that they may eate their owne dung, and drinke their owne pisse together. Doctor White also, in (that Lactea via, his Milke-white) Pag.342. Way to the true Church, chalengeth in all points of Poperie both authoritie of Scriptures, Fathers, and later Romanists, to produce the same against the Trent-Councell, and the Ie∣suites. But how hath that fatall and deadly name of Babel transported mee? Truely the likenesse of these Traditionaries, Cabalists, Talmud Ba∣bylonica. muddie Talmudists, and Legendaries
(as will appeare to an easie obseruer and comparer of this ensuing Historie to their practise) which haue beene mustered from the Easterne and Westerne Both Bellar∣mine and Baro∣nis approue, and proue Rome to be Babylon. Babel, and the like manner of their confusion, hath almost made mee forget the Historie and my selfe, but neuer a whit the Truth. And this will be further manifested in the next Chapter, where their account of their Talmud, and in the rest of this booke, where their superstitious deuotion is related. As for those testimonies of the Iewes against themselues, besides the Scriptures (which (in regard of the true sense) the veile ouer their hearts will not suffer them to reade, but it is a sealed booke vnto them, and they haue left the riches thereof vnto vs, as 2.Reg.7.7. the Aramites left their tents, with their horses and treasure, to the pined Israe∣lites) Their other Authors are so plaine and plentifull in the mysteries of our Religion, as I know not whether it cause greater pleasure to reade their writings, or astonishment and wonder at the Nation; so stricken with madnesse, and with blindnesse, and with astonishment of heart, since they haue shut their eyes against the Sunne of righteous∣nesse; on whom that threatened plague is come, Deut.28.29. Thou shalt groape at noone-dayes, as the blind doth groape in darkenesse. For out of their Talmud-Authors is plainly deliue∣red the mysterie of the Trinitie, the Incarnation of the SONNE of GOD, his two Natures, his Birth of a Virgine, his Spirituall Kingdome, the time of his comming, the truth of his Prophecies, and power of his Miracles; the Redemption of Mankind, by his Death, his Crucifying, Descent, Resurrection and Ascension: and that their Nation was to bee reiected, the old Law to cease, a New to succeed, &c. All which as they agree vnto that sweete and blessed Name, and Person of IESVS (which name, and that of EMANVEL, is also found in their writings) so do they argue the seueritie of GODS Iudgements, when men will not beleeue the Truth, that by the efficacie of errour, they shall haue eyes and see not, eares and heare not (neither ours nor their owne) as Paul, and CHRIST himselfe often told them. But those parti∣culars, as rather appertaining to disputation, then historie, (and therefore too much impertinent to our purpose) the desirous Readers may at large finde in Morney and Ga∣latinus, not to mention Iud. Viu. de V. C. F. Seb. Munster. de side Christ. & Ind. Censura. others. The witnesse of Iosephus, being one, whose name we often vse in this Historie, may iustly chalenge me, if I should omit him, especially seeing he liued in the very dayes of the Apostles, who, as he witnesseth of Iohn Baptist, and of many other things men∣tioned in the Gospell, fully agreeing therewith: so concerning our LORD and SA∣VIOVR, hath this testimonie. Ios.Antiq.18.cap.4. In the time of Tiberius, there was one IESVS, a wise Man (if at least-wise he was to be called a man) who was a worker of great Miracles, and a Teacher of such as loue the Truth; and had many followers, as well of Iewes as of Gentiles. This was CHRIST. Neuerthelesse being accused vnto Pilate, by the Chiefe of the Iewes, he was crucified. But yet for all that, those which had loued Him from the beginning, ceased not to continue still. For he shewed himselfe aliue vnto them three dayes af∣ter his Death, as the Prophets had foretold of him, both this and diuers other things. And euen vnto this day doe those continue still, which after his name are called Christians. Thus much Iosephus. Thus did the Truth force him to confesse, whose Historie of the destruction of his Nation, what is it but as a Commentarie on IESVS Prophecie thereof, and their fearefull imprecation, Matth.27.25. His bloud bee vpon vs and our children shewing that the wrath of GOD was come vpon them to the vt∣most? From Mount Oliuet, where IESVS was first apprechended, and where last those blessed feete touched the earth, (as if Mercie had there left a print of Iustice) was Ierusalem besieged, and at their Feast of Passeouer, (when they had crucified CHRIST) they were couped vp, as it were, assembled by Diuine Iustice from all quar∣ters to destruction, together with that their Citie, where they had slaine the LORD. But of this before. It will not be vnsauourie to the Reader, obseruing herein Diuine vengeance, to relate as vnsauourie a tale as euer was deuised, which their Talmud tel∣leth
in derogation of CHRISTS Miracles, in which I know not whether to call them Beasts or Deuils, so witlesse, and withall so wicked is their blasphemie. For sooth in Salomons Temple there was (say they) a certaine stone of verie rare vertue, wherein Salomon, by his singular wisedome, had engrauen the verie true name of GOD, which it was lawfull for euerie man to reade, but not to conne by heart, nor to write out. And at the Temple dore were two Lyons tyed at two chaynes, which rored ter∣ribly, that the feare thereof made him to forget the name that had committed the same to memorie, and him to burst asunder in the middest, that had put it in writing. But IESVS, the sonne of Marie, say they, regarding neither the Curse annexed to the Prohibition, nor the roaring of the Lyons, writ it out in a Bill, and went his way with it ioyfully. And least he might be taken with the thing about him, he had a lit∣tle opened the skinne of his legge, and put it in there, and afterward wrought his mi∣racles by the vertue of that name. I should be almost as absurd as they, if I should dispute against it, seeing in this, and most of their braine-sicke dreames, the very re∣citation is sufficient refutation. But before wee shake hands with the learned Writers of the Iewes, it is not vn∣meet, in my opinion, here to meet with some questions which some haue moued, concerning them and their dealing in and with the Scriptures. For since that the Councell of Trent hath decreed, in the yeare 1546, both the diuine authoritie of Scriptures Canonicall, to the Apocrypha-bookes, which the Iewes receiue not, nor euer did; and hath made the vulgar Translation Ses.4. In publicis lecti∣onibus, disputationibus, praedica∣tionibus, aut ex∣positionibus, pro∣cuthentica ha∣beatur: & quòd ecm nemo reij∣cere quouis prae∣textu and eat vel praesumat. Authenticall in publike Lectures, Disputations, Preachings, and Expositions, that none, vnder any pretence whatso∣euer, shall presume to reiect it: it is wonder to see how eagerly (that I say not im∣pudently) diuers of them haue sought to slander the originall Text, and haue bla∣med, as Authors thereof, in the New Testament, Heretikes, and in the Old, Iewes; couering their malice to vs with pretence of the malice of Heretikes and Iewes, and forgetting the true Rule, That it is a shame to belie the Deuill. Thus haue Lib.2.cap.13. Canus and Pintus, and Gregorius de Valentia, Sacroboscus, and others, traduced the Iewes in this behalfe; themselues refuted by their owne (which yet by conse∣quent ouerthrow that former Decree) Sixtus Senensis, Ribera, Cardinall Bellar∣mine himselfe, Andradius, Arias Montanus, Isaac Levita, &c. Besides, of ours many, and especially our owne learned Countreymen, Whitaker, Reynolds, Mor∣ton, &c. Bellar.de ver. Dei.lib.2.cap.1. Bellarmine hath both taught vs the vanitie of their opinion, that hold, That the Scriptures were all lost in the Babylonian Captiuitie, and were by Ezra renew∣ed miraculously (who is rather Ezra.4.14. commended for his industrie in interpreting and ob∣seruing them, and for ordering and compacting them in one volume, then for such needlesse reuelation to finde that which was neuer lost: an Author rather, as Hier. Prolog. Galeat. Hierome hath obserued, of the present Hebrew Letters, then of their auncient Scriptures) and hath also proued the absurditie of their conceit, that imagine the Hebrew Fountaines corrupted. First, by Bel.ibid.c.2. the Arguments of Origen and Hierome, That such corruption must haue been either before or after CHRIST: if that; CHRIST would haue re∣proued and not commended their Scriptures to their search: if this; how commeth it, that the testimonies, cited by him and his Apostles, are found now in Moses and the Prophets, as they were then cited? Secondly, out of Angustine, That it is not likely they would put out both their eyes (in depriuing their Scriptures of truth) that they might put out one of ours: nor was it possible that such a generall conspiracie could be made. Thirdly, from their more then reuerent estimation of their Scriptures, for which they would die, if it were possible, a hundred deaths, and euen still (as Isaac an∣swereth B. Lindan his Scholer) they proclaime a Fast to expiate, if by some accident that Book but fals to the ground. Fourthly, some places in the Hebrew are more strōg against the Iewes then our Translations are, and the Prophecies, which make most a∣gainst them, remaine there vncorrupted. And lastly, the prouidence of GOD would neuer herein faile his Church, but hath left them, with their bookes, to be dispersed through the world, to beare witnesse to that Truth which they hate and persecute.
These are Bellarmines Arguments; which, because they are the Truth, are also ours: and therefore we haue beene bold with the Reader to insert them. As for that Emen∣dation or Correction of the Scribes, which Galatinus mentioneth, wherein they haue corrupted the Text, he proueth it to be a late dreame of the Talmud, and answereth the Arguments of his fellowes, herein not so Catholike as himselfe. Now although this may seeme more then enough to conuince that folly, yet it shall not be impertinent to adde out of Arias Montanus somewhat touching the same, because it openeth another mysterie touching the Hebrew Learning, and the Masóreth. Refert Re∣nldus ex praef. Bibl. part.6. Antuerp. When the Iewes (sayth he) returned into their Countrey after the Cap∣tiuitie threescore and tenne yeares in Babylon, it befell them partly by occasion of their long troubles, which did distract their mindes, partly by corruption of their na∣tiue Tongue, which was growne out of kinde, first into the Chaldee, and afterward into the Syriake, that they neither knew nor pronounced so well the wordes of the Scripture, written (as the manner was) without vowels. Whereby it came to passe, that in the writing of them there crept in some fault, either through iniurie of the Times, or by reason of troubles which fell vpon the People, or by negligence of some Scriucners. But this inconuenience was met withall afterward by most lear∣ned men, such as Esdras was, and afterward Gamaliel, Ioseus, Eleazar, and other of great name, who prouided by common trauell, with great care and in dustrie, that the Text of Scripture, and the true reading thereof, should be preserued most found and vncorrupt. And from these men, or from their instruction, being receiued and polished by their Scholers in the Ages following, there came, as wee iudge, that most profitable Treasure, which is called Masóreth, that is to say, a Deliuerie, or Traditionall, because it doth deliuer abundantly and faithfully all the diuers Rea∣dings that euer were of the Hebrew Bibles. Wherein there appeareth an euident token of the prouidence of GOD, for the preseruation of the sacred Bookes of Scrip∣ture whole and sound, that the Masóreth hath beene kept till our time these many hundred yeares, with such care and diligence, that in sundrie Copies of it, which haue beene written, no difference was euer found. And it hath beene added in all the written Bibles that are in Europe, Africke, or Asia, each of them agreeing throughly therein with other, euen as it is printed in the Venice Bibles, to the great wonder of them, who read it. Thus farre Montanus: and by this Masóreth, their obiection of Caari and Caaru, in the two and twentieth Psalme, is answered, in that certaine readings haue the later and truer, as the Masóreth testifieth. Gram. Heb. . Marti∣nus affirmeth, That these Masorites inuented the prickes wherewith the Hebrew is now read, to supply the lacke of vowels, herein vsing religious care, least by inuenting new Letters to that purpose, they should haue changed that auncient forme of writing, and somewhat impaired the maiestie thereof. They tell, that when a cer∣taine Rabbine had read Zacár for Zécer, he was slaine of his Scholer Ioah, for vio∣lating Scripture. Gene. Chron 4. Genebrard denying their opinion, that make Ezra or Esdras Author of these He∣brew prickes and accents, sayth, That they were inuented after the times of Honorius the Emperour, in the yeare, after the Temple was destroyed, 436, which is (sayth he) from CHRIST 476, in Tyberias, a Citie of Galilee; the chiefe Authors were Aa∣ron Aseries, and Iames, sonnes of Niphthali, whose dissenting one from the other caused a diuision among the Iewes, the Westerne Iewes following the former, the Ea∣sterne, which dwelt in Babylonia, the later. The Syriake Tongue some hold to haue sprung from the corruption of the Chaldee and Hebrew mixt. The Editions and Translations of the Scriptures, out of the Hebrew into the Greeke, are Bell q.sup. cap.5. reckoned nine, besides that which Cle∣ment Alexandrinus. Strom. lib. 1. sayth, was before the time of Alexander, where∣of Plato and the Philosophers borrowed not a little. The first (alreadie mentioned) of the Seuentie. The second of Aquila, first a Gentile, after a Christian, and now last a Iew, in the time of Adrian. The third of Theodotion, a Marcionist, vnder Com∣modus. The fourth of Symmachus, first a Samaritane, and after that a Iew.
Of the fift and sixt are not knowne the Authors. Of all these Origen compounded his Hexapla. The seuenth was the correction rather then a translation. The eight was of Lucian, Priest and Martyr. The ninth of Hesychius. But the most famous and auncient, which the Spirit of GOD hath by often allegations, in some measure, confirmed, is that of the Seuentie. As for that conceit of the Cells, which Iustine Paraen. ad Gen. sayth were threescore and tenne, in which they were diuided, and which Epiph. de Pon. Epiphanius placeth by couples, and numbreth sixe and thirtie Cells, in which, by miracle, these thus diuided did all agree, in words and sense, Hier. praefat. in Pentateuch. Bellar.l.2.c.6. de verbe Dci. Hierome derideth the same as a Fable, because neither Aristaeus, which then liued, nor Iosephus, doc euer mention it. Now whereas Iosephus mentioneth on∣ly the Law translated by them; Iustinus, Irenaeus, Clemens, Eusebius, write, That they translated all. And although Aristaens name but the Law, yet who knoweth not, that by this generall name they sometime comprehended all the Scripture, as in the New Testament is seene; as 1. Cor. 14. 21. and Ioh. 10. 34. &c.. CHAP. XIII. Of the Moderne Iewes Creed, or the Articles of their Faith, with their interpretation of the same. STay Es. 29.9. your selues and wonder (sayth the LORD, of this people) they are blind, and make blind: they are drunken, but not with Wine: they stagger, but not by strong drinke &c. And after, because of their Hypo∣crisies, And their feare toward me is taught by the Precept of Vers.14. Men: Therefore behold, I will againe doe a maruellous worke in this People; euen a maruellous worke and a wonder: for the wisedome of their wise men shall perish, and the vnderstanding of their prudent men shall be hid. This day is this Scripture (as it hath beene many Ages heretofore) fulfilled in our eyes: as it hath ap∣peared by our former declaration of their Talmud, and further followeth, in rehear∣sing the thirteene Articles of their Creed, thus briefely expressed in their daily Prayer-bookes. 1. I Beleeue with a true and perfect faith, that GOD is the Creator, Gouernor, and Preseruer of all Creatures, and that he hath wrought all thinges, wor∣keth hitherto, and shall worke for euer. 2. I beleeue with a perfect faith, that GOD the Creator is one, and that such an Vnitie as is in him can be found in none other, who alone hath beene OVR GOD, is yet, and for euer shall continue OVR GOD. 3. I beleeue with a perfect faith, that GOD the Creator is not bodily, nor in∣dued with bodily proprieties, and that no bodily essence can be compared to him. 4. I beleeue that GOD the Creator is the first and last, and that nothing was before him, that he shall abide the last for euer. 5. I beleeue that he alone is to be adored, and that none else may be worshipped. 6. I beleeue that all, what soeuer the Prophets haue taught and spoken, is sincere truth. 7. I beleeue that the Doctrine and Prophecie of MOSES was true; that he was the Father and chiefe of wise men, that liued then, or before his time; or should be in times to come after. 8. I beleeue that all the Law, as it is this day in our handes, was so deliuered by GOD himselfe to MOSES.
9. I beleeue that the same Law is neuer to be changed, nor any other to bee gi∣uen vs of GOD. 10. I beleeue that he knoweth and understandeth all the workes and thoughts of men, as it is written in the Prophet, Hee hath fashioned their hearts together Ps.33.15. considering all their workes. 11. I beleeue that GOD will recompence to all men their workes: to all, I say, which keepe his Commandements, and will punish all transgressers whomsoeuer. 12. I beleeue that the MESSI AS is yet to come, and although he doe long dif∣ferre his comming, yet will I hope, that he will come, waiting for him euery day, till he doth come. 13. I beleeue with a perfect faith, that there shall be an awakening of the dead, at that time which shall seeme fit to GOD the Creator: the name of which GOD the Creator be much blessed and celebrated for euer-more. AMEN. This is the Iewish Faith, in which with much vexation, doubting, and lamentation, they die; vpon which, their Religion hath beene alway founded: but it was first put in writing, and brought into this order by R. Mosche bar Maimon, who died in the yeare after their reckoning 4964, Anno Dom. 1104. and strait charge was giuen, That the Iewes thenceforth for euer confessing it in this order, should, according to the same, liue and die. This their Creed, howsoeuer Charitie may construe much of it to a bet∣ter sense, yet according to their vnderstanding doth it principally aime at the subuer∣sion of Christian Religion; as appeareth in a more strait examination, after their sense of the 2,3,4, and 5, the 7,8,9,10,11,12. Articles: all which make against the person or the office of the sonne of GOD, as they vnderstand them; denying his Godhead, and disannulling his office, affirming, as a Iew shamed not to professe and vtter vnto M. Buxdorfius, That it needed not that any should satisfie for them, for euerie Foxe must yeeld his owne skinne and haires to the flayer. And the Iewish Faith, sayth R. Ioseph Albu, is founded vpon three foundations: vpon the vnitie of the diuine es∣sence; vpon the Law of Moses, and vpon the eternall reward of good works, and pu∣nishment of euill, contemning the Passion of CHRIST, Es.53.5.6 by whose stripes we are healed, and on whom GOD hath layed the iniquities of vs all. It is written also in their Tract. San∣hedrin, c. 11. Talmud, that all the Israelites haue their portion in the world to come, not all alike, but he shall haue a greater part that hath done more good workes, and the wicked and impenitent shall be punished twelue moneths in Hell or Purgatorie, after which time they also (and some sooner, if they haue beene lesse sinners) shall haue their part, but a lesse then the former: but to them which denie GOD (which become Christians) their fore-skinne groweth againe, and as vncircumcised eternally are punished in Hell. And the sonne of a deceased Iew is bound to say, for the space of one yeare, See Cap.19. a prayer called Kaddisch, thereby to redeeme him from Purgatorie; in which respect the father dieth with ioy. A good woman may doe the like for her husband. But R. Bechai (who excludeth all other Nations from their part in the Re∣surrection, preferring the Iewes in a foure-fold priuiledge, viz. the Land of Canaan, the Law, the Prophets, and the Resurrection) reciteth out of the great Tract.de nouo anno, c.1. Talmud, That three forts of men shall rise againe at the day of Iudgement: one, of the best Is∣raelites; a second sort of the wicked and worst; the third of a meane, who haue done as much good as euill. The good shall presently goe into life eternall; the wicked shall be cast into Hell, as in the twelfth of Daniel, and shall be for euer in torments of bodie and soule. The third and meaner sort of sinners shall be tormented for twelue moneths space for their sinnes in Hell; at the end of which time their bodies shall be consumed, and the wind shall scatter their ashes vnder the soles of the feet of the iust, &c. And as worthily doe they proue it out of the Zach.13.8. Prophet: And in that day two parts shall be cut off, and die, and the third shall be left therein: and I will bring that third part through the fire, and will fine them as Siluer is fined, and will trie them as Gold is
tried. And in another place, 1.Sam.2.6. The LORD killeth and maketh aliue, bringeth downe to Hell, and raiseth vp; Iust as fitly applied, as 1. Cor.3. and such like places by our Pur∣gatorie-Spirits. R. Dauid Kimchi vpon the first Psalme, and Es. 26. commenteth, That the wicked shall not rise, but in the day of death their soule shall die together with their bodie. And Aben Ezra in his exposition of Dan. 12. writeth out of Rab∣bi Higgaon, That many shall rise, and many not rise, but suffer euerlasting reproach; and expoundeth it thus, That the good Iewes which die in exile, shall rise againe when the Messias shall come, and shall liue as long as the Patriarchs before the floud: and then they shall make merrie with the great fish Leuiathan, and the great bird Ziz, and the great Oxe Behemos See cap. 20. ; of which we shall speake after. When this is done, they shall die, and at the last day shall be raysed vp againe, and shall possesse eternall life, where shall be no eating nor drinking, but glorie &c. Iacob Gen 47.30. desired to be buried in Canaan, not in Aegypt, for three causes (sayth R. Salomon Iarchi) because hee fore∣saw, That of the Exo. 8.17. dust of Aegypt should be made Lice: Secondly, because the Isra∣elites which die out of Canaan shall not rise againe without much paine of their rol∣ling through the deepe and hidden vaults of the earth: Thirdly, least the Aegyptians should make an Idoll of him. For the better vnderstanding hereof, let vs heare what is said out of the booke Tanchum (an Exposition of the Pentateuch) concerning this subiect. The Patriarchs (sayth hee) desired to be buried in Canaan, because they which are there buried shall first rise in the time of the Messias. And R. Hananiah sayth, That they which die out of Canaan, must endure two deaths: and the same ap∣peareth Ier. 20. where it is said, Pashur should goe into Babel, and should there die, and there be buried. What (quoth R. Simon) shall them all the iust perish, which die out of Canaan? No, but GOD will make them Mechillos, that is, deepe Clifts and Caues vnder the earth, by which they may passe into the Land of Promise; whither when they are come, GOD, shall inspire into them the breath of life, that they may rise againe, as it is written Ezec.37.12. , I will open your Graues, and cause yon to come out of your Sepulchres, &c. The like is written in their Targum, or Chaldaean interpretation of the Canticles: When they dead shall rise, Mount Oluiet shall eleaue asunder, and the Israelites which haue beene dead shall come out of the same, and they which haue died in strange Lands, comming thither by holes vnder the earth, shall come forth. And for his cause I my self (sayth our Author) haue heard the Iewes say. That sometimes some of the wealthiest and deuoutest amongst them goe into the Land of Canaan, that their bodies may there sleepe, and so be freed from this mi∣serable passage vnder so many deepe Seas and rough Mountaines. Now to come from their Faith to their workes: Their wise Rabbines persuade the fillie people, That they are the onely elect people of GOD, who easily can keepe, not the Decalogue, or tenne Commaundements alone, but the whole Law of Moses. They diuide the whole Law into sixe hundred and thirteene Commaundements, and them againe into Precepts and Prohibitions: Of the commaunding Precepts they number two hundred fortie and eight; iust so many as (according to the Rabbines Anatomie) a man hath members in his bodie. Of the prohibiting Commandements they reckon three hundred threescore and fiue, as many as are dayes in the yeare, Brandsp or (as in the booke Brandspiegel) veines in a mans bodie. Therefore if euery member of a man doe cuerie day performe one of the Precepts and omit one of the things prohi∣bited, the whole Law of Moses shall be euerie yeare, and so for euer, fulfilled. Their wise Rabbines say further, That the men onely are to obserue those sixe hundred and thirteene Commaundements, the women are onely subiect to the Prohibitions; yea, of those prohibitorie Mandates, onely to threescore and foure are they obliged by some, and to sixe and thirtie of the former; and this because of their other household∣businesse, and subiection to their imperious husbands. Some of their deepely-wise Rabbines adde to those sixe hundred and thirteene, seuen other Commaundements, making vp the number of sixe hundred and twentie; iust so many as are words in the Décalogue, and as arise of the word Keter signifying a Crowne: for were it not for the Law, GOD would not haue created the World; and for the obseruation thereof
it yet subsisteth. And they which keepe all the Commaundements, doe set a Crowne on the head of GOD, and he vpon the head of those which crowne him, shall set se∣uen Crownes, and make them to inherite seuen Chambers in Paradise, and will keepe them from the seuen infernall dungeons, because they haue obtained the seuen Hea∣uens and the seuen Earths. Their Wise-men affirme, that euerie veine of the bodie of a man doth prouoke him to omit that which is forbidden, and he which doth omit such their vaine veine∣warning, hath no good veine in him: euerie of his members also doe prouoke him to performe those inssorie inuentions. But as vaine should I be as they, if I should not make some end, where they can finde none. Wee would now from these generalities proceed to the particulars of their superstitions, tracing them herein from their birth to their graues, Religion being, in the pretence of their Law, the square of all their (otherwise ciuill) actions; at least to speake of their Superstitions in the same. But first, seeing Sebestian Munster hath written a whole booke, both in Hebrew and La∣tine, of those sixe hundred and thirteene Precepts, taken out of Moses, with the Ex∣positions of their Rabbines, I thought good to cull out some, which seeme most re∣markable and strange, to entertaine our Reader. Out of Negatiue Precepts expounded by the Rabbines in P MVNSTER. Praec.Mos. cum exp. Rab. THou shalt haue ne strange Gods in my sight. Exod. 20. The Name of GOD is forbidden to be communicated to any creature. Thou shalt not violate Leuit.22.32. mine holy name. The Rabbines say, If any doe against an affirmatiue Precept, and repent, his sinne is forgiuen him: But he which transgresseth a Negatiue Precept, is not cleansed by repentance, but it remaineth to the day of Expiation (which is the day of their solemne Fast and Reconciliation.) But hee which committeth a sinne, whereby he deserueth Death, or Excommunication, is not then purged, but must abide thereunto the diuine chastisements: and hee which viola∣teth the Name of GOD, cannot be absolued from that sinne but by death. Thou shalt not Leuit 19.17. hate thr brother in thy heart. He which is wronged by another, should not hate him, and hold his peace, but reproue him openly; and if he repent, he ought not to be cruell to him: But if any be often reproued, and will not amend, it is lawfull to hate him. This CHRIST Ma.5.43. consuteth. No Excd.34.14. Idoll is to be adored. If a man haue a thorne in his foot, hee may not bow before an Image to pull it out: and if money fall out of his hand, hee may not there, before an Image, stoope to take it vp, least he might seeme to adore it, but hee must sit downe on the ground to doe it. And if the water of a Fountaine be caused to passe through the mouth of an Image, he may not drinke thereat, least hee should seeme to kisie the Image. An Exod.20.23. Image may not be made, viz. the Image of a Man in Siluer or Gold, if it be embossed or set out, but if it be stamped in mettall (in manner of a Seale) it is lawfull. But of Beasts, Birds, Trees, and Flowers, those prominent Images (which are made standing out) are lawfull. Otherwise of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres. No Deut.7. commoditie is to be raysed from Idols. If a Tree be planted neere an Image, one may not sit vnder the shadow thereof, nor passe vnder it, if there be any other way: and if he must passe, it must be running. Things imployed to Idolatrie may be vsed of vs, if the Gentiles haue first prophaned them. It is not lawfull to fell them Waxe or Frankincense, especially at their Candlemasse Feast; nor bookes to vse in their Seruice. Our women may not performe a Midwiues office to them, nor nurse their children. Thou shalt Exod.20.10. doe no worke on the seuenth day. Nothing that belongeth to the getting of Food or Rayment. It is vnlawfull to walke on the grasse, least thou pull it
vp with thy feet; or to hang any thing on the bough of a Tree, least it breake; or to eate an Apple, plucked on the Sabbath, especially if the tayle or woodden sub∣stance, whereby it groweth, be on it; or to mount on a Horse, least he be galled; or to goe into water, least thou wipe thy clothes: which holdeth also, if they bee moistened with Wine or Oyle (but not in a woman that giueth sucke) who may wipe her clothes, for the more puritie of her prayers. The stopple of a Vessell, if it be of Hempe or Flaxe, may not be thrust in, though it runne, especially if any o∣ther Vessell be vnder. To mixe Mustard-seed with Wine or Water; to lay an Ap∣ple to the fire to rost; to wash the bodie, chiefely, with hote water; to sweat; to wash the hands; to doe any thing in priuate, which may not bee publikely done: (but some say, it is lawfull priuately to rubbe off the durt with his nayles from his clothes, which publikely he may not:) To reade by a Light, except two reade to∣gether: To set sayle: (but if thou enter three dayes before, it is not necessarie to goe forth on the Sabbath) to be carried in a Waggon, though a Gentile driue it: if fire happen on the Sabbath, to carrie any thing out, but thy foode, rayment, and necessaries for that day, and that wherein the holy Booke lyeth: to put to pa∣sture Horses or Asses, coupled together: to receiue any good by the Light, or Fire, which a Gentile hath made for the Iew; (otherwise, if hee did it for himselfe:) To play on any Instrument; to make a bedde; to Number, Measure, Iudge, or Marrie, least they should write any thing: To reade at home when others are at the Synagogues: To speake of Buying and Selling (which it seemeth they obserue not:) To visite Field or Garden: To Runne, Leape, or tell Tales, &c. All these on the Sabbath day are vnlawfull. For dangerous diseases it is lawfull to violate the Sabbath: Such are the three first dayes after a womans trauell, &c. But of this, see Cap.17. also the obseruation of their Sabbath. It is not lawfull to walke out of the Citie, but their limitted space: but within the Citie, as farre as they will, though it be as bigge as Niniue. It is forbidden Leuit.22. to hurt the Seed-members of Man or Beast. Nei∣ther Males nor Females may bee gelded or spayed: and yet wee may vse such beasts. It is punishable to know, kisse, or embrace one which is forbidden by the Law. Leuit. 18. Therefore our Masters haue forbidden to smile on such, or vse a∣ny meanes or tokens of Lust. Likewise they haue forbidden men to know their wiues in the day time, vnlesse it be in the darke, or vnder some Couering. The same is forbidden to a drunken man, and to him which hateth his wife, least they get wicked children betweene them. Also, to follow a woman in the streets, but either to goe before, or beside, her. And hee which is not married, may not put his hand beneath his Nauell, nor touch his Flesh, when hee maketh water. The fat may not be eaten. The fat of the Heart may: but not that which is one the Inwards and Reines, and Stomacke, and Guts, and Bladder: the rest may be eaten. If thy brother Leuit.25.39. be poore, thou mayest not abuse him; to wit, to base Offices, as to vntie the shooe, or to carrie Vessels to the Bath. Thou mayest Deut.23.19. not lend to an Israelite on Vsurie nor borrow on Vsurie. Nor be a witnesse or suretie in cases of Vsurie; nor receiue any thing besides the principall, especially on any Couenant going before. He that by constraint doth any thing worthie of death (although he violate the Name of GOD) ought not to be slaine. Wicked Exod.23.1. men are not competent witnesses. He is accounted wicked which transgresseth any Precept, for which he is worthie to be beaten. A Theefe and a Rob∣ber is not sufficient to be a witnesse, after he hath made restitution: Nor an Vsurer, nor a Publican, nor he which is enriched by play, nor children, till they haue beards, except he be twentie yeares old.
The Deut.17.17. King ought not to multiplie Wiues. Our Masters say, That the King may haue eighteene wiues. If any of the seuen (Canaanitish) Nations shall come in the hands of a Iew, he ought to slay him. The father or the husband may disannull the vowes of their children or wiues. And the Wise-men may release the vowes of those which repent of their vow. A sonne of thirteene yeares and a day, and a daughter of twelue and a day (if they be out of their parents tuition) haue power to vow. There are fiftie defects which make a Man or Beast vncapable of sacred Functions; to be either Sacrificer, or Sacrifice: fiue in the eares, three in the eye∣lids, eight in the eyes, three in the nose, sixe in the mouth, twelue in the Seed∣vessels, sixe in the hands and feet, and in the bodie foure, &c. Besides, there are fourescore and tenne defects in a Man, which are not in a Beast. No defect, vnlesse it be outward, maketh a man vnfit. Out of their Affirmatiue PRECEPTS. Praec.Mos∣cum Exp. Rab. EVerie one Deut.11.19. ought to teach his sonne the Law: Likewise his nephew; and Wise-men, their Disciples: and he which is not taught it of his Fa∣ther, must learne it as he can. He which teacheth another the written Law, may re∣ceiue a reward; but not for teaching the Traditionall. Rise before thine Leu.19.32. Elder: that is (sayth R. Iosi) a Wiseman, although young in yeares. To him thou must arise, when he is foure cubits distant; and when he is passed by, thou mayest sit downe againe. The sinner must turne from his Num.5.7. sinne vnto GOD. And being returned, he must say, I beseech thee, O LORD, I haue sinned and done wickedly before thy face: so and so haue I done, and behold it repenteth me of my wickednesse, I am confounded for my workes, I will doe so no more. And thus ought all to say, which offer sacrifices for sinne; and they, which are condemned to death for their crimes, if they will that death doe away their offences: But he which hath sinned against his neighbour, ought to make restitution, & aske pardon; otherwise his sinne is not remitted. And if his neigh∣bour will not pardon him, let him bring three other to entreat for him: if he then graunt not, he is to be accounted cruell. If the offended partie be dead before, let the offendor bring tenne men to his graue, and say before them, I haue sinned against GOD and thus man, and let restitution be made to his heires. Prayer Deut.11.1. must be vsed euery day. Therefore they of the great Synagogue, Ezra, Zerubabel, and the rest, ordained eighteene blessings, and other prayers, to be said with euerie Sacrifice. They ordained these Rites of Prayer; the eyes cast downe to the ground; the feet set together; the hands on the heart, in feare and trembling, as a seruant speaketh to his Master: a place where is no dung, especially of an Asse and a Henne: a window in the roome, which looketh toward Ierusalem, turning his bodie that way. He which is blind, let him direct his heart to his Father, which is in Heauen. The Sentence, Heare Israel, &c. and another Sentence is Deut.6.9. to be written on the posts of the House. He which hath his Phylacteries on his head and armes, and his knots on his garment, and his Schedule on his dore, is so fenced, that hee cannot easily sinne. Euery Israelite is bound to write for himselfe a Booke of the Deut.31.12. Law. Sanctifie the Sabbath, i. Remember those things on the Sabbath which make to the honour and holinesse of that day. And wee are persuaded, that Sa∣than and the Deuils, on the Sabbath, flye vnto darke Mountaines, abhorring
the holinesse of the day: and after it is past, returne to hurt the children of men. He which is twentie yeares old, and marrieth not, breaketh the Precept of In∣creasing and Multiplying: except it be for contemplation and studie of the Law. But if he feele in himselfe Iezer, Lust, to preuaile, he must marrie, least he fall into trans∣gression. If a man refuse to marrie the wife of his brother deceased without issue, he must, by the sentence of the Iudges, pull off his shooe, which must not bee made of Linnen, but of the Hide of a cleane Beast; and the woman, whiles she is yet fasting, (for then it is most truly spittle) shall spit in his face, saying, So let it be done to him which will not build his brothers house. He which will eate the flesh of Beast or Birds, must kill them after the due man∣ner. Nor may any be allowed to be a Butcher, except he know our Rites. When the Iudges dissent in any case, Exod.13. the greater part is to be followed. When Sentence is past, Execution must follow the same day: and the Crier must goe be∣fore, proclaiming the Crime and Penaltie, with circumstances of Time, Place, and Witnesses. If any can say any thing for his innocencie, he may cause him to be carri∣ed backe to the Iudges: if he be led againe to death, he must haue two Wise-men by to heare his words, that if they see cause, he may be carried backe to the Iudges. If he yet be found guiltie, he must be led to the place of execution, and there slaine by two Witnesses. But before his death, let them exhort him to say, Let my death be vnto me for the remission of all my sinnes. After this Confession let them giue him a cup of Wine, with a graine of Frankincense, to drinke, that he may be depriued of the vse of reason, and made drunke, and so slaine. Honour thy Father and Mother. R. Simeon sayth, That the Scripture more esteemeth the honour of Parents then of GOD: for wee are bidden honour GOD with our substance; but for thy Parents, if thou hast nothing, thou oughtest to labour in the Mill to succour them. At this time we can sanctifie nothing, because we haue no Temple. I might adde diuers other things of like moment, which (to auoid prolixitie) I omit: and for the same cause I let passe many things which I might hither bring out of the same Author S. Munster. Euang. Matth. cum Annotat. in his notes vpon Matthew, by him set forth in Hebrew and Latine; where he both relateth and refuteth diuers of the Iewish vanities; especi∣ally their blasphemous cauils against CHRIST. Such is that their foolerie (by him Annotat. in Matth. 15. recited) in Matth. 15. Annotat. about their scrupulous niceties in their Festiuals: They may not then take Fish; Geese and Hennes they may: When one maketh fire, and setteth on the Pot, he must order the stickes so vnder it, that it may not resemble a Building. No more then shall bee spent that day, may then be made readie. No Cheese may then be made, nor hearbes cut. Heat water to wash thy feet; not so for thy whole bodie. Touch not (much lesse mayest thou eat) an egge layd on a festiuall day: yea, if it be doubtfull whe∣ther it were then layd, and if it be mixt with others, all are prohibited. But hee which killeth a Henne, and findes Egges in the bellie, may eate them. According to the number of the three Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, they expect a third Temple, after those two alreadie perished; In Matth. 22. interpreting the Scriptures: Of the first, Hee heard mee from his holy Hill: Of the second, ISAAC went to meditate in the Field: Of the third, The glorie of this last House shall be greater then of the first, &c. Fit Iewish handling of the Scriptures. But I haue beene so plentifull of their barrennesse, that I feare to ouer-lade, or ouer-loath, the Reader. Munster Munsteri, tractatus Heb. & Lat. contrae Iudaeos. hath likewise written seuerall small Treatises of the Faith of the Christians, and of the Faith of the Iewes, and of the Iewish Cauils against our Re∣ligion, and of diuers fabulous fictions which they haue deuised in disgrace there∣of: they, that will, may in them further see their blindnesse. For what greater blindnesse then to thinke, that their Messias was borne that day the Temple was
destroyed, and to remaine at Rome till that time, when he shall say to the Pope, Let my People goe, as Moses, borne so long before, at last said to Pharaoh? That hee shall be annointed by Elias? That he shall destroy Rome? That Elias shall re-vnite the Soule to the Bodie in the Resurrection, which shall be of all the iust, but not of all the wicked; not in the same bodie, but another created like to the former? which Re∣surrection shall be effected by Messiahs prayer: That the Temple at Ierusalem shall be the very middle of the world? That in the Messiahs daies Wheat shall grow with∣out renewing by Seed, as the Vine? But of these and the like more then enough in this Booke following. CHAP. XIIII. Of the Iewish Ceremonies about the birth of a Child: of their Circumcision, Purification, and Redemption of the first-borne, and Education of their Children. WHen a Iewish woman Buxdorf. Syn. lud. c.2. is great with child, and neere her time, her chamber is furnished with necessaries; and then some holy and de∣uout man (if any such may be had) with chalke maketh a circular line round in the chamber vpon all the walls, and writeth on the dore, and within, and without on euery wall, and about the bed in Hebrew Letters, Adam. Chaua, Chuts Lilis, i. Adam, Eue away hence Lilis. Hereby they signifie their desire, that if the woman shall be deliuered of a sonne, GOD may one day giue him a wife like to Eue, and not to Lilis: if it be a daughter, that shee may once proue to her husband a helper like Eue, and not a shrew, like Lilis. This word Lilis is Isa.34.14. read in the Prophet, interpreted a Skrich-owle: but the Iewes seeme to meane by it a deuilish Spectrum, in womans shape, that vseth to slay or carrie away children, which are on the eight day to be circumcised. Thus is it read in Ben Sira, of the Iewish Edition: When GOD had made Adam, and saw it was not good for him to be alone, he made him a woman of the Earth, like vnto him, and called her Lilis. These disagreed for superioritie, not suffering Lucan.l.b.1. , Caesar vè priorem. Pompeinsvè paerem: Lilis (made of the same mould) would not be vnderling, and Adam would not en∣dure her his equall. Lilis seeing no hope of agreement, vttered that sacred word IEHOVA, with the Cabalisticall interpretation thereof, and presently did flye into the Ayre. Adam plaining his case, GOD sent three Angels after her, viz. Senoi, Sen∣senoi, Sanmangeleph either to bring her backe, or denounce vnto her, That a hundred of her children should die in a day. These ouertooke her ouer the troublesome Sea (where one day the Aegyptians should be drowned) and did their message to her: shee refusing to obey, they threatened her drowning: but shee besought them to let her alone, because she was created to vexe and kill children on the eight day, if they were men; if women children, on the twentieth day. They neuerthelesse forcing her to goe, Lilis sware to them, That, whensoeuer shee should finde the name or figure of those Angels written or painted on Schedule, Parchment, or any thing, shee would doe infants no harme, and that shee would not refuse that punishment, to loose a hundred children in a day. And accordingly a hundred of her children, or young Deuils, died in a day. And for this cause doe they write these names on a Scroll of Parchment, and hang them on their infants neckes. Thus farre Ben Sira. In their Chambers alwayes is found such a Picture; and the names of the Angels of Health (this office they ascribe to them) are written ouer the chamber dore. In their Booke Brandsp. Brandspregel, printed at Cracouia, 1597, is shewed the authoritie of this Historie, collected by their Wise-men out of those wordes; Gen.1.27. Male and female created he them compared with the forming of Eue of a Ribbe in the next Chapter, saying, That Lilis the former was diuorced from Adam for her pride, which she con∣ceiued,
because she was made of earth, as well as he; and GOD gaue him another, Flesh of his flesh. When this Iewesse is in trauell, shee must not send for a Christian Midwife, except no Iewish can be gotten: and then the Iewish women must be very thicke about her for feare of negligence or iniurie. And if she be happily deliuered of a sonne, there is exceeding ioy through all the house, and the father presently makes festiuall pro∣uision against the Circumcision on the eight day. In the meane time tenne persons are inuited, neither more nor fewer, which are all past thirteene yeares of age. The night after her deliuerie, seuen of the inuited parties, and some others sometimes, meete at the Child-house, and make there great cheere and sport all night, Dicing, Drinking, Fabling, so to solace the mother, that shee should not gricue too much for the childs Circumcision. The Circumciser is called Mohel, who must be a Iew, and a Man, and well exercised in that Facultie: and he that will performe this office, at the beginning giueth money to some poore Iew, to be admitted hereunto in his children, that after his better experience he may be vsed of the richer. And this Mo∣hel may thence-forwards be knowne by his thumbes, on which heë weareth the nayles long and In arctam a∣cuminatos ∣gues. Buxd. sharpe, and narrow-pointed. The circumcising Instrument is of Stone, Glasse, Iron, or any matter that will cut: commonly sharpe kniues like Ra∣sors, amongst the rich Iewes closed in Siluer, and set with stones. Before the infant be circumcised, he must be washed and wrapped in clouts, that in the time of the Circum∣cision he may lye cleane: for otherwise they might vse no prayers ouer him. And if in the time of Circumcision (for paine) he defileth himselfe, the Mohel must suspend his praying, till he be washed and layed cleane againe. This is performed commonly in the morning, while the child is fasting, to preuent much fluxe of bloud. In the morning therefore of the eight day all things are made readie. First are two Seates placed, or one so framed, that two may sit in the same apart, adorned costly with Carpets, and that either in the Synagogue, or some priuate Parlour: if it bee in the Synagogue, then the Seat is placed neere the Holy Arke, or Chest, where the Booke of the Law is kept. Then comes the Suretie or Godfather for the child, and placeth himselfe at the said Seat, and neere him the Mohel, or Circumciser. O∣ther Iewes follow them, one of which cryeth with a loud voice, That they should bring presently whatsoeuer is needfull for this businesse. Then come other children, whereof one bringeth a great Torch, in which are lighted twelue Waxe-Candles, to represent the twelue Tribes of Israel: after him two other boyes, carrying cups full of Red wine. After them another carrieth the circumcising knife: another brings a dish with sand; a∣nother brings another dish with oyle; in which are cleane and fine clouts, which after the Mohel applieth to the wounds of the child. These stand in a Ring about the Mohel, the better to marke and learne: and these their offices are bought with mony by those children. Some come thither also with Spices, Cloues, Cinnamon, strong Wine to re∣fresh, if any happen to swowne. These being thus assembled, the Godfather sitteth downe vpon one of those two Seats: right against him the Mohel placeth himselfe, and sings the Exod.15.1. Song of the Israelites, and other. Then the women bring the child to the dore, all the Congregation presently rising vp. The Godfather goeth to the dore, taketh the child, sitteth downe on his Seat, and crieth out, Baruch habba.i. Blessed be he that commeth; in their Cabalisticall sence, habba being applied either to the eight day, which is the day of Circumcision, or to the comming of Elias, whom they call the Angell of the Couenant (so they interprete Mal.3.1. the Prophet) and say, that Elias commeth with the infant, and sits downe on that other emptie Seat. For when the Israelites were prohibited Circumcision, and Elias complained thus, 1. Reg.19.10. The children of Israel haue for∣saken thy Couenant. i. Circumcision, GOD promised him, That from thence-forwards he should be present at Circumcision, to see it rightly performed. And whē they make readie that Seat for Elias, then they are bound in set words to say, This Seat is for the Prophet Elias: otherwise (as an vnbidden guest) he commeth not. This Seat remai∣neth for him three whole dayes together.
Then when the Godfather holdeth the child in his lappe, the Mohel takes him out of his clouts, and layeth hold on his member, and holding the fore-skinne, puts backe the top thereof, and rubbeth the fore-skinne, so to make it haue the lesse sense of paine. Then he taketh from the boy the circumcising-knife, and sayth with a lowd voice; Blessed be thou, O GOD our LORD, King of the World, which hast sanctified vs with thy Commaundements, and giuen vs the Couenant of Circumcision: and whiles he thus speaketh, cuts off the fore-part of the skinne, that the head of the yard may be seene, and presently hurleth it into the Sand-dish, and restoreth his knife to the boy againe: taketh from another a cup of Red wine, and drinketh his mouth full, which he presently spirteth out on the infant, and there with washeth away the bloud; and if he see the child begin to faint, he spitteth out some thereof on his face. Pre∣sently he taketh the member of the child in his mouth, and sucketh out the bloud, to make it stay from bleeding the sooner, and spitteth out that bloud so sucked into the other cup full of Wine, or into the dish of Sand. This hee doth at least thrice. After the bloud is stayed, the Mohel with his sharpe-pointed thinne nayles rendeth the skinne of the yard, and putteth it backe so farre, that the head thereof is bare. He is more painefull to the infant, with this rending of the remaining skinne, which action is called Priah, then with the former. This being done, he layeth the clouts (dipped in oyle aforesaid) to the wound, and bindeth them three or foure times a∣bout; and then wrappeth vp the infant againe in his clouts. Then sayth the father of the child; Blessed be thou, O GOD our LORD, King of the World, which hast sancti∣fied vs in thy Commaundements, and hast commaunded vs to succeed into the Couenant of our Father Abraham. To which all the Congregation answereth, As this infant hath happily succeeded into the Couenant of our Father Abraham; so happily shall hee succeed into the possession of the Law of Moses, into Marriage also, and other good workes. Then doth the Mohel wash his bloudie mouth and his hands. The Godfather riseth with him, and standeth ouer-against him; who taking the other cup of Wine, sayth a cer∣taine prayer, and prayeth also ouer the infant, saying; O our GOD, GOD of our Fathers, strengthen and keepe this infant to his Father and Mother, and make that his name, in the people of Israel may be named (here he first nameth the Childe, calling him Isaac) Isaac, which was the sonne of Abraham. Let his Father reioyce in him that hath come out of his loynes; let his mother reioyce in the fruit of her wombe, as it is writ∣ten, Pr. 23.25. Make glad thy Father and Mother, and her that bare thee to reioyce. And GOD sayth by his Prophet, Ezech. 16.6. I passed by thee, and saw thee troden in thy bloud, and I said vnto thee, in thy bloud thou shalt liue, yea I said vnto thee, in thy bloud thou shalt liue. Here the Mohel puts his finger into the other cup of Wine, wherein hee had set the bloud, and moisteneth the childs lippes three times with that Wine, hoping, that according to the former sentence of the Prophet, he shall liue longer in the bloud of his Circumcision, then otherwise he should. Dauid also sayth, Ps. 105.8. He is mindfull of his maruellous acts which he hath done, and of his wonders, and the iudgements of his mouth, &c. Then he continueth his Prayer for the present assemblie, and that GOD would giue long life to the father and mother of the boy, and blesse the child. This done, he offers the blessed Cup to all the young men, and bids them drinke. Then with the child (who is thus made a Iew) they returne to the fathers house, and re∣store him to his mothers armes. This last prayer hee makes neere the Arke, and some of the deuouter Iewes, before and after Circumcision, take the Child, and lay him vpon Elias pillow, that Elias may touch him. Glos. Talmud. The skinne cast into the sand, is in memorie of that promise, Gen. 32.12. I will make thy seed as the sand of the Sea; and of Balams saying, Num. 23.10. Who can number the dust of Iacob, i. his posteritie, whose fore-skinne is cast in the Sand or Dust, and because the Curse Gen. 3.14. on the Serpent is thus fulfilled, Dust thou shalt eat, i. this skinne in the dust: thus to their enemie the Ser∣pent fulfilling also that Precept, Prou. 25.21. If thine enemie bunger, feed him. And by this means the Serpent can no more seduce this man. If a child be sicke on the eight day, they deferre Circumcision till his recouerie: if
he die before the eight day, he is circumcised at the graue without any prayers: but a signe is erected in memorie of him, that GOD may haue mercie vpon him, and raise him at the day of the resurrection. In some places al the people stand, except the God∣father, because it is written, All the people stood in the Couenant. But to pursue the rest of their niceties, grounded vpon such interpretations, would be endlesse. We will fol∣low the child home, if you be not already weary, and see what rout is there kept. Ten must be the number (you haue heard) of the inuited guests, and one or two of these learned Rabbins, who must make a long praier and sermon at the table, although others meane while are more busied in tossing the cuppes of wine. I was once present (saith Cap.2.pag.94. Buxdorflus) at one of their Circumcision-feasts, and one of their Rabbins prea∣ched on Prou. 3. 18. Wisdome is a tree of life; but more woodden or ridiculous stuffe I neuer heard in all my life. This feast they obserue by example of Abraham, who Gen.21.3. made a great seast when the child was weaned: their kabal peruerts it, when he was circumcised. The Circumciser abideth some tune with the mother, lest the bloud should again issue from the child. The mother keepeth within, six weeks, whether it be a male or female: all which time her husband must not so much as touch her, or eate meate in the same dish with her. If a female child be borne, there is small solemnitie; only at sixe weekes age, some yong wenches stand about the cradle, and lift it vp with the child in it, and name it; she which stands at the head, being God-mother: and after this they iunket together. When the forty dayes are accomplished, before the wife may accompany or haue a∣ny fellowship with her husband, she must be purified in cold water, and put on white and cleane garments. Their washing is with great scrupulosity, in a common watering or in priuate cesternes, or fountaines; which must be so deepe, that they must stand vp to the necke in water: and if it be muddy in the bottome, they must haue a square stone to stand on, that their whole feet may stand in cleare water, and that the water may passe betwixt their toes: for the least part not couered with water, would frustrate the whole action: and for this cause they lay aside al their haire-laces, neck-laces, rings: they diue vnder the water, so that no part may be free from the same. Some Iewesse must stand by for witnesse hereof, which is twelue yeares old and a day at least. The redee∣ming of the first-borne. They redeeme their first-borne in this sort; when the child is one and thirtie dayes old, his father sendeth for the Priest with other friends, and sets the child on a table be∣fore him; adding so much mony, or monies-worth as amoūteth to two florens of gold, or two dolars and a halfe: my wife (saith he) hath brought me forth my first-borne, and the Law bids me giue him to thee. Dost thou then giue me him? saith the Priest: he an∣swereth, yea. The Priest asketh the mother, if she euer before had a child, or abortion? if she answere No: then the Priest asketh the father, Whether the child or the money be dearer to him? he answereth, the child: then doth the Priest take the money and lay it on the head of the Infant, saying: This is a first begotten child, which GOD comman∣ded should be redeemed, and now, saith he to the child, thou art in my power, but thy parents desire to redeeme thee; now this money shall be giuen to the Priest for thy redemption: and if I haue redeemed thee, as is right, thou shalt be redeemed: if not, yet thou being redeemed according to the Law and custome of the Iewes, shalt grow vp to the feare of GOD, to marriage and good workes, Amen. If the father die, be∣fore the child be one and thirtie dayes old, the mother hangeth a scroll about his neck, wherein is written, This is the first-borne, and not redeemed: and this child when he commeth of age must redeeme himselfe. The Iewish Chachamim, or wise-men, haue left no part of life vnprouided of their su∣perstitious care: as we haue seene concerning the birth and circumcision of their chil∣dren, with the purification of the mother, and redemption of the first-borne. To proceed with them: they enioyne the mother, while she giueth sucke, to eate holesome food of easie digestion, that the Infant may suck good milke; so that the heart and stomack be not stopped, but may come so much more easily to obtaine wisedome and vertue. For God hath great care of children, and hath therefore giuen a woman two breasts, and placed them next her heart; yea in the dangerous persecutiō vnder Pharaoh, Exo. 1.
he In the booke Medrasch. caused the earth to open it selfe, and receiue their male children, and created there∣in two stones, from one of which the Infant sucked milke, & from the other hony, till they were growne, and might go to their parents: yea, and if you beleeue their Gemara (can you chuse?) a poore Iew hauing buried his wife, and not able to hire a nurse for his child, had his owne breast; miraculously filled with milke, and became nurse himselfe. Yea, Mardochaeus (saith their Medrasch) sucked the breasts of Hester, and for this cause did she, after her exaltation, so preferre him. The conclusion is, if she giue grosse food to her Infants, she shall be cast into hell. She must not go naked breasted, nor too long fasting in a morning, nor carrie her Infants, or suffer them to goe or be naked, lest Psal.121.6. the Sunne hurt them, if it be in the day, or the Moone in the night: and that they may soone learne that the earth is filled with the maiestie of diuine glorie: and for this cause must they beware, that they neuer go bare-headed: for this were a signe of impuden∣cie, and ill disposition. And as religiously they must prouide, that they be alway girded with a girdle: for the girdle distinguisheth betwixt the heart and the priuities; and in his morning prayer he saith, Blessed be thou. O GOD, which girdest Israel with the gir∣dle of strength: which, if he should not haue a girdle on, would be in vaine. Their mo∣thers therefore sow their girdles to their coats: with great care they auoid going bare∣foot, especially in Ianuary and February. When they can speake, they are taught sentences out of Scripture, and to salute their parents with good-morrow, good-Sabbath, &c. and after seuen yeares they adde the name of GOD, GOD giue you good-morrow, &c. but they must not name the name of GOD but in a pure place. These teach them the names of things in the vulgar, and some Hebrew names among, that so they may not commonly be vnderstood: for pure Hebrew they cannot speake, except their most learned Rabbines only. Their chil∣dren must not conuerse with children of Christians, and their parents make all things in Christians odious to them, that they may season them from their child-hood with hatred of them. When they are seuen yeares old they learne to write and reade: and when they can reade, they learne to construe the text of Moses in their vulgar tongue. When the mother carrieth him first to the schoole to the Rabbi, she maketh him cakes seasoned with hony and sugar, and as this cake, so (saith she) let the Law be sweete to thy heart. Speake not vaine trifling words in the schoole, but only the words of GOD. For if they so doe, then the glorious Maiestie of GOD dwelleth in them, and deligh∣teth it selfe with the aire of their breath. For their breathing is yet holy, not yet pollu∣ted with sin: neither is hee Filius man∣daorum. bar-mitzuah, bound to obey the Commandements, till he be thirteene yeares old. When he is ten yeares old, and hath now some smattering in Moses he proceedeth to learne the Talmud: at thirteene yeares, his father calleth ten Iewes, and testifieth in their presence, that this his sonne is now of iust age, and hath been brought vp in their manners and customes, their daily manner of praying and blessing, and hee will not further stand charged with the sinnes of his sonne, who is now bar-mitzuah, and must himselfe beare this burthen. Then in their presence he thanketh GOD, that he hath discharged him from the punishment of his sonne, desiring, that his sonne by diuine grace may bee long safe, and endeuour to good workes. At the fifteenth yeare of their life, they are com∣pelled to learne their Gemara, or the complement of their Talmud, disputations and subtile decisions about the text of their Talmud. And in these they spend the greatest part of their liues, seldome reading any of the Prophets, & some not in the whole space of a long life reading one Prophet through, and therefore know so little of the Mes∣sias. At eighteene yeares their male children marrie, according to their Talmud-consti∣tution, and sometimes sooner, to auoid fornication. Their maidens may marrie, when they are twelue yeares old and a day. At twentie yeares they may traffike, buy, sell, and circumuent all they can: for their neighbour in the Law, is (in their sence) such a Iew as you haue heard described.
CHAP. XV. Of their Morning Prayer, with their Fringes, Philacteries, and other Ceremonies thereof. THe good-wife is to waken her husband, & the parents to awaken their children, when after thirteene yeares they are subiect to the Iewish Precepts: before their Pentecost, they rise before it is light, and after, the nights being shorter, when it is now day. They are to awaken the day, not to tarry till it awaken them. For their Morning-praier must be made whiles the Sunne is rising, and not later: for then is the time of hearing, as they interpret Lament. 2.19. And he which is deuout ought at that time to be sad for Ierusalem, and to pray euery morning for the reedifying of the Temple, and Citie: if in the night-time any sheddeth teares for their long captiuitie, GOD will heare his prayer, for then the Starres and Planets mourne with him: and if hee suffer the teares to trickle downe his cheeks, GOD will arise and gather them into his bot∣tle, and if any decree be by their enemies enacted against them, with those teares hee wil blot out the same. Witnes Dauid, Psal.56.9. Put my teares in thy bottle, are they not in thy book? And if any rub his forehead with his teares, it is good to blot out certaine sins that are there written. In the beginning of the night, GOD causeth all the gates of heauen to be shut, and the Angels stay at them in silence, and sendeth euill spirits into the world, which hurt all they meet: but after midnight, they are commanded to open the same. This command and call is heard of the cockes, and therefore they clap their wings and crow, to awaken men: and then the euill spirits lose their power of hurting: and in this respect the Wise-men haue ordained them a thanksgiuing to be said at cock-crowing. Blessed art thou O GOD, LORD of the whole world, who hast giuen vnderstanding to the cocke. They must not rise vp in their beds naked, nor put on their shirts sitting, but put their heads and armes into the same as they lie, lest the walles and beames should see their nakednes. It is a brag of Rabbi Iose, that, in all his life, he had not herein faulted. But to goe or stand naked in the chamber, were more then piacular: and much more, to make water standing naked before his bed, although it be night. He must not put on his garments wrong: nor his left shooe before the right, and yet he must put off the left-foot shooe first, When he is clothed, with his head inclined to the earth, and a de∣uout minde (in remembrance of the destruction of the Temple) hee goeth out of the chamber, with his head, feet, and all couered, because of the holy Schechinam (Diuine glorie) ouer his head. Then he goeth to stoole in some priuie place; for so hath Amos commanded, Amos 4..2. Prepare thy selfe (O Israel) to meet thy GOD: and Dauid; Psal.103.1. All that is within me praise his holy name: that is, all within the body emptie and cleane: For else must not GOD be named; and therefore his garments must not be spotted and fouled. To restraine nature too long, were a sin, & would cause the soule to stinke: and (sauing your reuerēce) he must wipe with the left hand, for with the right he writeth the name of GOD, and the Angels. And in this place and busines he must take heed, he think not of God or his Word; much lesse name him, for God will shorren the dayes of such a one. R. Sira told his schollers, that the cause of his long life was, that in an impure place he neuer thought of the Word, nor named the name of God. Besides, he must turne his face, and not his hinder-parts toward the Temple of Ierusalem. He ought not to touch his body with vnwashen hands, in regard of the euill spirits which rest thereon til they be washed, and if hee should touch his eyes he would bee blinde, his eares deafe, his nose dropping, his mouth stinking, his hand scabbed with these vnwashed, and there∣fore venemous hands: and when he washeth he must powre water three times on his right hand, and as oft on the left, before one hand may touch the other: he must not be sparing in his water, for store of water, store of wealth: after the hands, the mouth & face must be washed, because they were created after the Image of GOD: and how should
the name of GOD be vttered out of a foule mouth? he must wash ouer a basen, not o∣uer the ground: he must drie his face very well, for feare of wheales and wrinckles: and that with a cleane towell, not with his shirt, for this would make them blockish and forgetfull. After all this followeth his Brachah, or blessing, Blessed be thou, O God, our God, King of the whole world, who hast commanded vs to wash our hands. Their hands they must alwaies wash on these occasions: in the morning; at their returne from the stoole; from bathing; when they haue cut their nailes; haue scratched their naked bodie; haue pulled off their shooes with their hāds; haue touched a dead body; haue gone amongst the dead; haue cōpanied with their wiues, or haue killed a louse, If he respect washing after these, if he be learned, he shal forget his learning; if vnlearned, he shal lose his sēse. They Of the Iewes Arba-canphos, and Zizis. haue a foure-cornered garment, which some put on with the rest, when they rise; others then, when they will pray. The foure-cornered parts thereof are made of linnen or silke, tied together with two winding-bands, of such length that they may draw through their head betwixt them, so that those two quadrangular peeces may hang down, one on his breast, the other on his back. In euery of these 4. corners hang∣eth a labell, made of white woollen threds, by a little knot, downwards to the ground, and the same is foure, or eight, or twelue fingers broad. These labels they call Zizis. Those which are deuout weare this garment euery day, vnder a long outward coat, in such sort that those labels may appeare out a little, so that they may alwaies see them, as monitories of the Commandements of God. When they put them on, they praise God that hath commanded them to weare these Zizis. He (say they) that keepeth duly this Num.15.38. Fringes and Philacteries. precept of Zizis, doth as much as if he kept the whole Law: for there are in all fiue knots, compared to the fiue bookes of Moses: eight threds added to them, make thir∣teene. And the word Zizis, maketh six hundred, all together amounting to six hundred and thirteene, the number (as you haue heard) of Gods Commādements. They ascribe the continencie of Ioseph in Potiphars house; and of Boaz, when Ruth slept by him, to these Zizis. May it please your patience, a story out of the Talmud. One Rab. Iochanan saw a box full of iewels, which one of his scholers, Bar-Emorai purposed to steale, but was forbidden by a voice soūding out of the aire, let it alone Bar-Emorai, for it belong∣eth to R.Chaninas wife, which in the other world, shall put into the same violet wooll, to make thred for Zizis, that of them, the iust men there may haue their fringed gar∣ments sowed. Once, he which weareth this garment without intermission, is fortified against the Diuell, and all euill spirits. Besides this memorable Vestiment, they weare a certaine knot neere their nose, out of Deut. 6.8. they shall be frontlets between thine eies. Of their Te∣phillim. They make it thus. They take a little black foure-square calfe-skin, which they fold eight times, that it may haue foure dou∣ble folds and distinct breadths. They put into these, distinct Scriptures, the same being foure-fold of parchment. These Scriptures are taken The four∣teene first ver∣ses in Exod.13. and 4.5.6.7.8.9 of Deut.6.Pagn. out of Exod.13. & Deut. 6. Then take they haires out of a cow or calues taile, & wash them cleane, & binde them about those writings of Scripture, so that any one may see, that they are good by the ends of them appearing out of the skin. This skin they sow with cleane and fine strings, taken out of calues or kines bodies, or made of buls sinewes, or if such strings cannot be had, with strings of calue-skin-parchment. Then do they sow a long & black thong to that thick hide or skin, and knit a knot about it. This peece of worke they call Tephillims, to put them in mind of often prayer: and tie it so about their heads, that the thicke knot, wherein the Scriptures are, may hang betwixt the eyes. After this, they take another foure-cornered skin, which they fold as the former, & write certaine verses out of Exo∣dus in parchment, and put it into a little hollowed skin, and sow it vpon the thicke fol∣ded skin; to which they adde a long thong, & call it the Tephillim of the hand. This they tie to the bare skin, aboue the elbow of the left arme; that so that which is written may be ouer against the hart, which may hereby be the more enflamed to praier. That long string is so fastned that it cōmeth to the fore-part of the hand, thus fulfilling that com∣mandent, Deut.6.6.8. The words which I command thee this day, shall be on thine heart, and thou shalt tie them for a signe in thy hand. They tie on first this Tephillim of the hand, and then that of the head, & make their brachah or prayer, saying, Blessed be thou, O God, our Lord, who
hast sanctified vs in thy cōmandements, & hast commanded vs to put on Tephillim; looking while he speaketh, diligently on the knot on his forehead. In folding, sowing, knitting, and tying them, they very subtilly frame the name of GOD Schaddai: Other their ma∣nifold Ceremonies about these Tephillim, I willingly omit. Their sanctitie is such, that he which weareth them must be pure within and without: and if he lets them fall on the ground, all that shal see them so lying, must fast with him one whole day: they must not be hāged vp bare, but in a bag; nor may they be left in a chamber, where a man and his wife lie together, except in triple chest or bag. A man must not sleepe while he hath them on, nor may he breake winde; and if he haue list to the stoole, he must lay them foure ells from the place of his easement, or lay them against his heart in a double bag. Their women seruants, and sicke folkes are free from wearing them. It is sufficient for women to say Amen to their prayers. And all this Moses learned in Mount Sinai. We haue been tedious in furnishing our Iew to his Mattins; at Sun-rising is their houre, as you haue heard: but their Rabbins haue inlarged and lengthened that time to about nine of the clock. Where many of the Iewes liue together, they resort at a set houre to their Synagogue. Thither they must go cheerefully: before their Synagogue they haue an iron fastened, to make cleane their shooes, according to Salomons coun∣sell, Eccles.4.17. Keepe thy foot when thou goest into the house of GOD. Hee that hath Pantofles, must put them off, as it is written, Exod.3.5. For the place where thou standest is holy ground. At the entrance in at the doore, he pronounceth some things out of Dauids Psalmes: they must enter with feare and trembling, considering whose presence it is; and for a while suspend their praying for the better attention. And euery Iew must cast in a half∣peny at least into the Treasury, as it is written; I will see thy face in righteousnes, that is, in alines, as they interpret it. In this attention they bow themselues towards the Arke, in which is the Booke of the Law, and say, Num.24 5. How faire are thy tents, O Iacob? and thy dwellings O Israel? And Psal.5.7. I will enter into thy house in the multitude of thy mercie, I will bow downe in thy holy Temple in thy feare. And, Psal.26.8. O LORD I haue loued the habitation of thy house, and the place of the tabernacle of thy glory: and diuers other verses out of the Psal. After these things they begin to pray, as is contained in their Common-praier-booke: and because these prayers are very many, therefore they run them ouer: he that cannot reade, must attend, & say Amen, to all their prayers. These praiers are in Hebrew rimes. Their first prayer is, The LORD of the World, which raigned before any thing was crea∣ted, at that time, when according to his will they were created, was called KING, and then when all shall be brought againe into nothing, shall remaine KING, to whom shall be giuen feare and honor. He alway hath beene, is, and shall remaine in his bewtie for euer. He is One, and besides him there is none other, which may be compa∣red or associated to him, without beginning and end; with him is rule and strength. He is my GOD and my deliuerer which liueth. He is my Rocke in my need, and time of my trouble, my Banner, my Refuge, my Hereditary portion, in that day, when I implore his helpe. Into his hands. I commend my spirit. Whether I wake or sleepe, he is with me, therefore I will not be afraid. This done, they say then their hundredth Grounded on Deut.10.12. Now Israel what doth God require of thee? they reade not Mah Schoel, but Meah schoel, he requireth an hundred. benedictions one after another, which are short, and twice a day repeated. First for the washing of their hands, that if he then forgot it, he might now in the Congregation recite it. Then for the creation of man, and for that he was made full of holes, wherof, if one should be stopped he should die: then, a confession of the resurrection: then for vnderstanding, giuen to the cocke (as you haue heard) to discerne day and night asunder, and with his crowing to awa∣ken them; and in order, Blessed, &c. That he hath made me an Israelite or Iew. Blessed, &c. That he hath not made me a seruant. Blessed, &c. That he hath not made me a wo∣man (The women heere say, that hee hath made me according to his will) Blessed, &c. That exalteth the lowly. Blessed, &c. That maketh the blinde to see; which they should say at their first wakening. Blessed, &c. That raiseth the crooked; at his rising. Blessed, &c. That clotheth the naked; at his apparelling. Blessed, &c. That raiseth vp them that fall. Blessed, &c. That bringeth the prisoners out of prison. Blessed, &c. That stretcheth the world vpon the waters; when he setteth his feet on the ground. Blessed, &c. That pre∣pareth
& ordereth the goings of man; when he goeth out of his chamber. Blessed &c. That hath created all things necessary to life; when he puts on his shooes. Blessed, &c. That girdeth Israel with strength; his girdle. Blessed. &c. That crowneth Israel with cō∣lines; when he puts on his hat. Blessed, &c. That giueth strength to the weary. Blessed be thou GOD our LORD, KING of the World, who takest sleepe from mine eyes, & slumber from mine eye-lids. Then adde they two prayers to be preserued against sins, euill spi∣rits, and men, and all euill After this, humbling themselues before GOD, they confesse their sins, & againe comfort themselues in the couenant made to Abraham, We are thy people, and the children of thy couenant, &c. O happy we! how good is our portion? how sweet is our lot? how faire is our heritage? Oh happy we, who euery morning and e∣uening may say, Heare Israel, The Lord our Lord is one God. Gather vs that hope in thee from the foure ends of all the earth, that all the inhabitants of the earth may know that thou art our GOD, &c. Our FATHER which art in heauen, be mercifull vnto vs for thy names sake, which is called vpon vs: and confirme in vs that which is written, Zephan.3.20. At that time will I bring you, and gather you, and make you for a name and praise among all the people of the earth, when I shall turne your captiuities, saith the Lord. Then follow two short praiers for the Law giuen them. And then they go onto the Sacrifices, which, because they cānot execute in actiō out of the Temple, they redeeme with words, reading the precepts cōcerning Sacrifices, according to their times, com∣forting themselues with the saying of Hose, Hos.14.3. We will sacrifice the calues of our lips. Then repeate they a history of sacrifice, & a prayer of the vse of the Law, & how many waies it may be expounded. This done, they (with a still voice that none can heare) pray for the reedifying of the Temple, in these words; Let thy will be before thy face, O God our Lord, Lord of our Fathers, that the holy house of thy Temple may be restored to our daies, & grant vs thy will in thy Law. After, rising with great ioy and clamor, they sing a prayer of praise in hope hereof: & sitting downe againe, they reade a long praier, ga∣thered here & there out of the Psalmes: & some whole Psalmes, & part of 1. Chron. 30. and lastly, the last words of Obadia Ohad.vers.21. The Sauiours shall ascend into mount Sion, to iudge the mount of Esau, and the kingdome shall be the Lords. Which they speake in hope of the destruction of the Christians, whom they call Edomites, and of their owne restitution. (In some of their close writings, which they will not suffer to come into the hands of Christians, they say that the soule of Edom entred into the body of CHRIST, & that both he and we are no better then Esau.) They proceed Munster, prae∣cept.Mos.cum expos. Rab. singing, And GOD shall be king ouer all the earth: in that day GOD shall be one, & his name one, as it is written in thy Law, O GOD, Heare Israel, GOD our GOD is one GOD: And these words in their next prayer they repeat, resounding that last word Echad. One, by the halfe or whole houre together, looking vp to heauen: & when they come to the last letter therof, Daleth, d, they all turne their heads to the foure corners and windes of the world, signifying that God is King of the whole world: hauing in the word echad many superstitious subtilties; that the letter Daleth in regard of his place in the Alphabet, signifieth 4. and the word echad 245. whereunto adding hael elohechem emes, God your Lord is true, they make vp the number of 348. and so many members there are in mans body: for euery member, a prayer secures them all. And this verse thrice recited, secureth against the ill spirit. They They may not say it with∣in foure cubits of a graue; nor in sight of an vnclean place, where dung or vrine is, except they be hard∣ned and dried vp, or else co∣uered. They must not stirre their eyes or fingers: It is a preseruatiue a∣gainst Diuels. Munster. esteeme it a holy prayer, by which, miracles may be wrought, and therefore vse it morning and euening. They haue another prayer called Schmoneesre, that is, eigh∣teen, because it containeth so many thankesgiuings, which they say twice a day, & the chiefe chanter of the Synagogue singeth it twice by himself. They think by this praier to obtaine remission of their sins. They must pray it standing so, that one foot must not stand more on the ground then the other, like the Angel, Ezek.1.7. and their foot was aright foot. When they come to those words in it, holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts; they leape vp three times aloft. And he (say their Chachamim) which speaketh a word during this praier, shal haue burning coales giuē him to eat after his death. These 18. thāksgiuings are for the 18. bones in the chine or back-bone, which must in saying hereof be bēded. After this followeth a prayer against the Iewes reuolted to Christianity, and against all Christians, saying; These which are blotted out (that is, reuolters) shall haue no more
hope and all vnbeleeuers shall perish in the twinckling of an eye, and all, thine ene∣mies which hate thee O GOD shall be destroyed, and the proud and presumptuous kingdome shall quickly bee rooted out, broken, laide euen with the ground, and at last shall vtterly perish, and thou shalt make them presently in our dayes obedi∣ent to vs. Blessed art thou GOD which breakest and subduest them which are re∣bellious. They call the Turkish Empire the kingdome of Ismael; the Romane, Edo∣miticall, proud, &c. After this followeth a prayer for the good sort, for proselytes, reedifying of the Temple, for sending the Messias, and restauration of their kingdome. In the end they pray GOD to keepe them in peace, and when they come to these words, hee that maketh peace aboue, shall make peace ouer all Israel, Amen  they goe backe three paces, bowe themselues downewards, bend their head on the right hand, then on the left (if some Christian be there with an image, they must not bowe out lift vp their heart) This they doe for honours sake, not to turne their hinder parts on the Arke: and thus they goe (like crabbes) out of the Synagogue, vsing certaine prayers; not running, but with a flow pace, least they should seeme glad, that their mattins were done. Other their niceties in praying, as laying the right-hand on the left ouer the heart; not spetting not breaking winde vp or downe; not (interrupted by a King) to cease prayer; to shake his body this way and that way; not to touch his naked body; and to say Amen, with all his heart: for they that say Amen, are worthy to say it in the world to come. And therefore Dauid endeth a Psalme with Amen, Amen: signifying, that one is to be said heere, and the other in the other world. Psal.72.19. CHAP. XVI. Of their ceremonies at home, after their returne, at their meales and otherwise: and of their Euening Prayer. THus haue we seene the Iewish Mattins, which they chaunt (saith ano∣ther) Rela. of Re∣lig.in the West. in a strange wilde hallowing tune, imitating sometimes trumpets and one ecchoing to the other, and winding vp by degrees from a soft and silent whispering, to the highest and loudest Notes, that their voi∣ces will beare, with much varietie of gesture: kneeling they vse none, no more then doe the Graecians: they burne Lampes: but for shew of Deuotion or Eleuation of spirit, that yet in Iewes could I neuer diseerne: for they are reuerend in their Synagogues, as Grammar boyes are at schoole, when their Maister is absent. In summe, their holinesse is the very outward worke it selfe, beeing a braine-lesse head, and a soulelesse-bodie. Meane-while, the good wife at home, a∣gainst her husbands returne, sweepeth the house, that nothing may disturbe his holy cogitations, and layeth him a booke on the Table, either the Pentateuch of Moses, or a booke of manners, to reade therein the space of an hower before hee goeth out of the house about his businesse. This study is required of euery deuout Iewe, either in his owne house, or else in their schoole or Synagogue, And beeing thus come home, they lap vp their Tephillim in a Chest, first that of the head, then that of the hand. They account it healthfull also to eate somewhat in the morning before they goe to worke: for whereas there are threescore and three diseases of the gall, a bit of bread, or draught of Wine can cure them all. About eleuen of clocke his wife hath prepared his dinner, pure meates, purely dressed: but if she haue pullen or cattell, she must first feede them. For it is said, Deut.11.13 I will giue grasse in thy field for thy cattell, and thou shalt eate and bee satisfied: you see, the Cattell are first mentioned. And to keepe such Domesticall cattell, is good in respect of the disastrous motions of the pla∣nets, vvhich must some way sort to effect. But if they bee studious of almes and good vvorkes, then Saphyra Rabba the great Chauncellor (some Angell) according to his office, registreth the same, and commendeth them vnto GOD saying, Turne away
that planetaire misfortune from such a one, for he hath done these and these good workes. And then doth it befall some wicked man, or else some of the Cattell. Before they come to the Table they must make triall againe in the priuy what they can doe: for it is written, Lcu.26.10. Thou shalt carry out the olde, because of the new. Especially let there bee cleane water, wherein the houshould must first wash, then the wife, and lastly the good man, who presently without touching or speaking ought else might more pure∣ly giue thankes. He (saith R. Iose in the Talmud. tract.sotah.c.1. Talmud) that eateth with vnwashen hands, is, as hee that lieth with an Harlot, for it is written. Prou.6.26. For the strange woman a man com∣meth to a morsell of bread. They must wash before meate and after, so strictly, that they may not keepe on a Ring on their finger, for feare of some vncleannesse remaining vn∣der it. I had rather (saith R. Akiba) die for thirst, then neglect this washing tradition of the Elders: when he had onely so much water brought him into prison, as might serue him but to one vse of washing or drinking, at his owne choise. On the Table cleanely spread, must be set a whole loafe well baked, and the salt, and then the housholder or the chiefest Rabbi at Table taketh the loafe into his hands, and in the cleanest and best baked part therof, maketh a cut into it, and then setting it down and spreading his hands on it, saith Blessed art thou LORD GOD, King of the world, who bringest bread out of the earth: and then breaketh off that peece of bread which he had cut before, and dipping it into the Salt or broth, eateth it, without speaking a word (for if he speake hee must say ouer his grace againe:) After this, he taketh the Loafe, and cutteth for the rest. Then hee taketh a cup of Wine (if they haue any) with both hands, and with the right hand holdes it vp a handfull higher then the table, and loc∣king stedfastly on the cup saith, Blessed &c. who hast made the fruit of the Vine. Ouer water they pronounce no blessing: and if there be not three at least at the Table, each man must blesse for himselfe: if three or more, the rest say, Amen. Salt is religiously set on in remembrance of the sacrifices. If when they cut, they should cut off the peece of bread, it would offend GOD. Both hands they spread ouer the Loafe in memory of the ten Commandements, which GOD hath published concerning Wheate, of which bread is made. The bread must be had in speciall honour, no vessell supported with it, or set vpon it: and a Robin-good-fellow, or the spirit of the buttery among the Iewes. spirit called Nabel giueth attendance, as depu∣ted to obserue such as (through negligence) tread it vnder foote, and to bring them in∣to pouertie: and another man (dogged by this spirit, which sought to bring him to pouertie) eating victuals one day on the Grasse in the field, the spirit hoped to effect his purpose: but this deuout Iewe, after he had eaten, pared away the grasse, and threw it with the crummes scattered into it, into the Sea for the fishes, and presently heard a voice, saying, woe is mee foole, who haue attended to punish this man, and cannot haue occasion. They dreame that Elias and euery mans proper Angell attendeth at Table, to heare what is said, if they talke of the Lawe: otherwise an ill Angell com∣meth and causeth bralles and diseases: and in respect of these spirituall attendants, they cast not their bones beside or behinde them. They are curious not to eate flesh and fish together: but first flesh, and then scoure their teeth from the flesh, and eate a bit of bread, and drinke a draught of drinke, before they eate the fish. They must not vse the same knife to meates made of milke, which they vsed in eating flesh. Milke must not stand on the Table with flesh, nor touch it. Besides the 23. Psalme set before them in the meale time, they testifie their de∣uotion by multitudes of new graces or thanksgiuings, if any better Wine or dainties be set before them, yea besides the particulars of their cates, euen for euery good sent, as of Oyle, Roses, Spices, &c. and are of opinion, that to vse any thing without thanksgi∣uing is to vsurpe & Steale it. Let this be spoken to the shame of many profane Esaus with vs, that will rather sell Gods blessings for their meate, then seeke them to their meate: al∣though in them the paiment of these by tale, & not by weight is no better then a bead∣superstition. They make a religion of leauing some leauings of their bread on the table: but to leaue a knife there were dangerous, euer since that a Iewe once in the rehearsing that part of their grace after meate, which concerneth the reedifying of Ierusalem in a deepe agonie tooke his knife so left, and thrust into his heart. This their grace is
long containing a commemoration of the benefits vouchsafed their forefathers, and a prayer for regranting the same: to send Elias, and the Messias: and that they may not be brought to beg or borrow of the Christians: and for his blessing vpon all of that house, &c. Wherevnto is answered with a loude voice, Amen: and they say to them∣selues: Psal.39.10.11. Feare the LORD ye his Saints, for they that feare him haue no want: the Lyons lacke and suffer hunger, but they which seeke the LORD shall want nothing that is good: and while this is said, there must not a crum me left in their mouthes. The prayers must be in that place where they haue eaten: or else they shall loose the benefit of buriall: and a certaine deuout Iew in the field, remembring that hee had forgotten his grace, returned backe to the house, and there performing his duty, had miraculously sent vnto him a doue of golde. In Cities where are Synagogues, about fiue in the afternoone their Scholae uls∣tor among the Iewes, is as our Sexten. Clearke (or some such officer) goeth about and with knocking at their doores giues them notice of euen∣ing prayer. Thither being come, they sit downe and saie this prayer (of the first word, called Aschre.) Psal 8 44. & 144.15. & 145.5. Blessed are they which dwell in thy house praising thee continually, Selah. Blessed are the people that are thus, blessed are the people whose GOD is the LORD. I will magnifie thee O GOD my King, &c. all that 145. Psalme throughout: he which saith this Psalme thrice a day shall haue his portion in eternall life. Then the chiefe Chorister or Chaunter, singeth halfe their prayer called Kaddesch: and then all say those eigh∣teene praises mentioned in Morning Prayer. Then goeth their Chorister out of his pulpit, and kneeleth downe vpon the steps before the Arke, and falleth downe with his face on his left hand (all the people doing likewise) saying, O mercifull and gracious GOD, I haue sinned in thy sight, but thou art full of mercy: be mercifull vnto me, and receiue my prayer proceeding from an humble heart. Reproue me not O LORD in thy wrath, nor correct me in thine anger, and so proceedeth through that whole sixt Psalme: his countenance couered and inclined to the ground. This is done in imitation Iosh.7.6. of Io∣shua. Then the Praecentor or chiefe Chorister, againe rising vp saith, And we know not what to doe, but that we direct our eyes vnto thee. And then they say vp the other halfe of their Kaddesch: and so endeth their euensong. Now should they goe home, and after supper returne to performe their Night deuo∣tions: but because a full belly would rather be at rest, and might easily forget this dutie, after some pause and stay, they proceede before they go to their other taskes and in that time of pausing betweene their vespers & nocturnes, if there be any strife betweene any, and reconciliation cannot be made, then he which cannot reconcile his neighbour, go∣eth to the common prayer-booke, and shutting it, knocketh thereon with his hand, saying ani kelao, I conclude the businesse; as if hee should say, I conclude praying till mine Aduersarie be reconciled to me: vntill which thing be effected they may not pray further: and so sometimes their prayers are intermitted then and diuers daies together, if one party will be stubborne. These prayers are for substance much like the former: as against the Christians, and for their owne restitution by their Messias. They depart out of the Synagogue with repetition of those sentences mentioned in the former Chapter. At supper they behaue themselues as at dinner. Going to bed they put off the left shooe before the right: their shirt they put off, when they are couered in their beds for feare of the walles beholding their nakednes. He that maketh water naked in his cham∣ber, shall be a poore man: and the prayer Deut.6.4. Heare Israel, must bee his last words on his bed, and sleeping on the same, as in Psal.4.5. speake in your heart on your bed, and be si∣lent: Selah. If he cannot by and by sleepe, he must repeat it till he can: and so his sleepe shall proue good to him. The bed must be pure: for how else should they thinke on the name of GOD? And it must bee so placed, that they must lye with their heads to the South, their feete toward the North, for by this meanes they shall be fruitfull in male children. They haue also their Chamber-Morals, instructing of duties betwixt the man and wife, vnmeete for sober and chaste eares. Tis time for our pen to sleepe with them, and end this Chapter.
CHAP. XVII. Their weekely obseruation of Times. Viz. Their Mundayes and Thursdayes, and Sabbath. HItherto haue wee heard of their prayers euery day obserued. They haue also their times designed to the reading of the Lawe. In the Tract.Babba Kama.c.7. Talmud is reported, that Ezra in the Babylonian captiuitie was Author vnto the lewes of ten Commandements. First, that on the Sabbath; Second∣ly on Munday and Thursday, with singular solemnitie, some part of the Lawe should be reade: Thirdly, that Thursday should be Court or law-day for deciding controuersies: Fourthly, that it should be a day of washing, sweeping, and cleansing in honour of the Sabbath: Fiftly, that men should then eate Leekes: the sixt, seuenth, eight and ninth are of womens baking, clothing, combing, bartering: the last is of cleansing after vncleane issues. Their learned men confirme this institution of Ezra, by authoritie of Scripture, Exod.15.22. They went three daies in the desert and found no wa∣ters. By waters they vnderstand the Lawe. For so it is said Esay 55.1. Come ye to the wa∣ters: that is, to the Lawe: and therefore they ought not to let three dayes passe without some solemne reading of the Lawe. Munday, and Thursday are chosen to be the daies, because on Thursday Moses went the second time into the Mount, and returned with the two Tables on the Munday. This their deuotion is as auncient, as that Pharisee Luke 18. I fast twice in the weeke; that The deuou∣ter Iewes fast euery Munday and Thursday. which the most deuout amongst them doe to this day obserue. These two daies are generally halfe holy-daies. Assembling early in their Synagogues, besides their or∣dinarie prayers they annexe many other. Among others they vse one Prayer called Vehurachum, of miraculous effect, as appeared in Vespasians time, who commit∣ting three ships full of Iewes, without Oare or Mariner to the wide Seas, which ari∣ued in three seuerall regions, Louanda, Arlado, Burdeli, (worke for Geographers) Those which arriued in this last Port, by tyrannicall Edict of the King, were to bee tried whether they vvere true Iewes, as Hananias, Misael, and Azarias made proofe of their Religion. Wherevpon three daies being required (as they said Na∣bucadnezar had granted them) vvherein to betake themselues to fasting and praier: in this time of respite three deuoute Iewes, Ioseph, Beniamin, and Samuel, inuented each of them a prayer which they ioined into one, and continued in praying, the same three daies, at the end whereof they cast themselues into the fire, and there continued till it was consumed. Hence arose this ordinance, euery Munday & Thursday to vse the same prayer, which is this; And hee is mercifull, and pardoning finne doth not destroy the sinner. Hee often turneth his anger from vs, and doth not kindle all his wrath. Thou, O my GOD, suffer me not to want thy mercy: let thy gentlenesse and truth keepe me alwaies. Help vs O GOD, our GOD, and gather vs from the Gentiles &c. for their Restitution as in other their prayers and destruction of their enemies, the Christians. After this they prostrate themselues on their faces (as before) with many other orisons to the like effect. Their solemne ceremonie of the Lawe-lecture followeth, In The manner of the Lawe∣Lectur. all their Syna∣gogues, they haue the fiue bookes of Moses written in great letters, on parch∣ments of Calues-skinnes sowed together in length, which at both endes are fastned to peeces of wood, by vvhich the booke may be lifted and carried. This booke is kept in an Arke or Chest set in some wall of the Synagogue. Before the doore of the Arke is a hanging of Tapestrie, more or lesse precious according to the quali∣tie of their Feasts, and for the most part vvrought vvith bird-worke. The booke is wrapped in a linnen cloth, wrought with Hebrew words: without that, is hanged about some other cloth of Linnen, Silke, Veluet or golde, to which is fastened a plate of siluer by a chaine of gold, vpon which is written, the crowne of the Lawe or holinesse of the LORD. Then goeth one about crying vvho will buy The folding of the wood of Life. Gelilab etz chaijm. This is an office whereby they are authorised to handle those peeces of wood
and to open the booke of the Lawe. He which giueth most for it, hath it: the money is reserued for the poore. The peeces of wood are called etz chaijm, tree of life, accor∣ding to Prou.3.18. Salomon. Wisedome is a tree of Life to them that lay hold thereon. When the Pracentor. chiefe chanter hath taken out the booke, and goeth with it into the pulpit, they all sing out of Num. 10.35. Arise O LORD, & let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee: and out of Esay 2.3. Many people shall goe and say, come, let vs ascend to the mount of the LORD, to the house of the GOD of Iacob, and he shall teach vs his wayes, and we will walke in his pathes. for the Law shall go out of Sion, and the word of the LORD from Ierusalem. When this Praecentor layeth the booke on his arme, he saith, Psal.34.4. Magnifie the LORD with me, and let vs exalt his name together: to which all the people answere, Exalt yee the LORD our GOD Psal.99.9. , and bowe before his footestoole for it is holy: Exalt ye the LORD our GOD and bowe to the mountaine of his holinesse, for Ichouah our GOD is holy: There, vpon a Table couered with silke he layeth downe the booke: and he which hath bought the office, taketh from it the clothes, wherein it is wrapped. Then these two call some one of the Congregation by his owne and his fathers name, who commeth forth and kisseth the booke, not on the bare parchment (for that were a sinne) but on the clothes which couer it: and taking it by those peeces of wood, saith aloude, Praise the LORD &c. Blessed bee thou O LORD, vvho hast chosen vs before any other people, and giuen vs thy Lawe. Blessed be thou O GOD the Lawe-giuer. Then the Praecentor readeth a Chapter out of the booke: and then hee which was called forth, with like kissing and blessing returneth. Then another is called forth and doth likewise. After him another, who had neede be of strong armes: for he lifteth vp and carrieth this booke, that all may see it, all cry∣ing, This is the Lawe which Moses gaue to the Israelites. This office is called Hagba∣a, and is sold as the former. The women meane-while contend amongst them∣selues in this Synagogue by some lattice to haue a sight of the Lawe. For the women haue a Synagogue apart seuered with lattices, so, besides their pretence of modestie, to fulfill the saying of Zacharie, Zach.12.2. The familie of Dauid shall mourne apart, and their wiues apart &c. If he which carrieth the booke should stumble or fall, it were Ominous and should portend much euill. These two officers fould vp the booke as before: and then come all & kisse the same: and then is it carried to his place with singing. After this they end their prayers as at other times: saying, LORD leade me in thy righteousnes, because of mine enemies, direct thy way before me: and, The LORD keep my going out & comming in from henceforth for euer. Which they also say when they goe forth on a iourney or to worke. They prepare themselues to the obseruation of their Sabbath, by diligent proui∣sion on the Friday before night of the best meates well dressed; especially the women prouide them good Cakes. They honour the Sabbath with three bankets: first, on the Friday night when their Sabbath beginneth, another on the Sabbath day at noone: the third before sun-set. Exod.16.25. Eat ye it to day, to day is the Sabbath of the LORD, to day ye shal not finde it (Manna) in the field: doe you not see to day thrice mentioned, & therefore by Mo∣ses own ordaining, that manna must so often be eaten on the Sabbath? The richest Iewes & most learned Rabbines, disdaine not some or other office, as chopping of herbes, kin∣dling the fire or somewhat toward this preparation. The table remaineth couered all that night & day. They wash, and if need be, shaue their heads on the Friday, and very reli∣giously cut their nailes, beginning with the fourth finger of the left hand, and next with the second, then with the fift, thence to the third, and last to the thumme, still leaping ouer one: In the right hand they begin with the second finger, & after proceed to the fourth and so forth. These parings if they treade vnder foote, it is a great sin: but he which bu∣rieth them is a iust man, or which burneth them. Now must they also whet their kniues and put on their Sabbath-holy-day-raiment to salute Malchah the Queene: so they terme the Sabbath. The Clarke goeth about and giueth warning of the Sabbath: and when the sun is now readie to set, the women light their Sabbath-Lampes in their dining roomes, and stretching out their hands toward it, say ouer a blessing: If they cannot see the sunne, they take warning by the hens flying to roost.
The cause why the women now and at other feasts light the lampes, is Magistrally determined by the Orach. chaym.cap.2. Rabbines, because that Eue caused her husband to sinne, yea with a cudgell belaboured him, and compelled him to eate, which they gather out of his words, Gen.3.12. the woman gaue mee of the Tree, (to wit a sound rib-rosting) and I did eate. Now after they had eaten, the sunne, which before shined, as it shall doe in the other life, diminished his light, And for dimming that light, shee lightens this. And for three causes (you shall beleeue their Talmud Desab.c.21. ) women die in trauell; for forgetting their dough wherewith to make Cakes with Oyle, Exod 25. for neglecting their termes; and not lighting the Sabbath lampes: which their Cabalists gather out of the threeletters of the name of Eue, or Chauah. These lights are two or more, according to the condition of the roome. They begin their Sabbath thus soone, and end it also later, then the iust time, in com∣miseration of the purgatory-soules, which begin and end with them this Sabbaths-rest, being the whole weeke besides tormented in that fire. Iudas himselfe, in honour of the Christian Sabbath, from Saturday Euensong obtained like priuiledge: witnesse S. Bran∣don in the legend (can you refuse him?) who found him cooling himselfe in the Sea, sit∣ting vpon a stone which he had sometime remoued out of a place, where it was neede∣lesse, into the high-way. (So meritorious euen in Iudas is any the least good worke.) Like to this is the story of Turnus, and R.Akiba in the Ta'mud. Tract.sanbed.c.7. There did Iudas acquaint Brandon with this Sunday-refreshing of the hellish prisoners and desired his holy company to scarre away the diuels, when they should after Sunday euensong come to fetch him againe, which for that time Brandon granted, & performed. The Iewes will not quite empty any place of water, that on the Sabbath these fierie soules may finde where to coole them. Two Angels attend them home from the Syna∣gogue, one good, and the other euill, which if they finde all things well, that is, Iewish∣ly prepared for the Sabbaths honour, the good Angell saith it shall be so the next Sab∣bath, and the euill Angell (will he, nill he) answereth, Amen. If otherwise, the good Angell is forced to say Amen to the euill Angels denunciation of the contrarie. They feast it with much ceremonie, pronouncing their blessing on the wine: with looking on the lampe to repaire that fiftieth part of their eye-sight, which they say in the weeke time ordinarily is wasted: they couer the bread meane while, that it should not see the shame thereof, in that the Wine is blessed, for the Sabbaths vse, before it. This good cheere on the Sabbath is of such consequence, that for this cause in their De Sab.c.16. Talmud is reported, that a Butcher in Cyprus, which still reserued his best meates for the Sabbath, grew by diuine reward so rich, that his table and all his table, furniture were of Golde. You may receiue with like credit the Legend of Ioseph following, vvho buying continually the best Fish, to honour the Sabbath with it, found in the belly of one of these Sabbath-fishes a hat-band of Pearles, worth no lesse then a Kingdome. The table remaineth spread till the next night. The Lampes must not be put out, nor the light thereof applied to the killing of fleas, to reading or writing, &c. The good man must honour that night with more kindnes to his wife, then on other nights: therefore eate they Leekes before: therefore they marry on the Sabbath: and the children, then conceiued, must needes be wise & fortunate. If a Iew trauell, and on Fri∣day euening be further from his home, then a Sabbath-dayes-iourney, he must there abide, be it in the middest of a Wood or Wildernesse, till the Sabbath be past. They sleepe longer on the Sabbath morning; so with their greater pleasure to honor it. They then vse more prayers in their Synagogues: and reade seuen Lectures of the Law. They now also reade the Prophets. They stay here till noone and no longer, least by longer fa∣sting and praying they should breake the Propheticall commandement, Esay 58.13 Thou shalt call my Sabbath a delight. After dinner also they reade in their Lawe: For Minhagim. Pag.13. on a time, The Sabbath and the Lawe put vp their complaints to GOD for want of a com∣panion and learner, and the Israelites were giuen as a companion to the Sabbath, and on the Sabbath a learner of the Lawe. But for all this they talke not more busily all the weeke through of Vsuries, buying and selling, then on their Sabbath. Their Euen∣song they haue soone done, that they might returne, and while the day yet lasteth, make an end of their third banquet, by which they are secured against hell and against
Gog and Magog: They conclude it with blessings and singings, till it be late, to pro∣long the returne of the soules into Hell: for presently after they haue ended, there is proclamation through Hell, to recall them to their dungeons. In these Songs they call vpon Elias to come; so iustly are they deluded, who scoffingly imputed vnto Matth.27.47. CHRIST the calling of Elias. But their Elias being busie, (as he sometime said of Ahabs Baal) and not comming, then they request him to come the next Sabbath. But he (it seemeth) is loath to leaue his place vnder the tree of life in Paradise; where hee standeth (say they) enrolling their good workes in the keeping of the Sabbath. When this their deuotion is done, the women in haste runne to drawe water, because the Fountaine of Miriam Num. 20. flowing into the Sea of Tiberias, doth from thence emptie it selfe in the end of the Sabbath into all Fountaines, and is very medicina∣ble. After this doe the Iewes make a diuision betweene the Sabbath and the new weeke. The Housholder lighteth a great Candle, called the Candle of Distinction: at whose light hee vieweth his walls, This holie wine they sprinkle about their houses & themselues, as effectuall a∣gainst diseases and deuills. blesseth a cuppe of Wine, and a little siluer boxe full of sweete spices, powreth a little of the Wine on the ground, and applieth the box to euery ones nose to smell to, thus to remedie the stinke which is caused at the new opening of hell for the returne of the souls: or else to keep them from swowning at the departure of one of their soules. For they are of opinion, that themselues haue a superfluous sabbatharie soule, which on that day is plentifully sent in to them, to in∣large their heart, and to expell care and sorrow. Antonius Margarita affirmeth, that they dreame of three soules in each man, besides the sabbatharie soule, two of which leaue him in his sleepe, one mounting to Heauen, where in learneth things to come; the other called brutish, contemplating sinne and vanitie. The viewing of their nailes at the candle, is in remembrance of Adams nakednesse, all sauing where the nailes couered his fingers and toes ends. The Wine they powre on the ground, to refresh Corah and his complices vnder the ground. For their Sabbath-workes they are determined Rabbinically: a horse may haue a halter, or a bridle to leade, but not a saddle to lade him: and he that leadeth him, must not let it hang so loose, that it may seeme he rather carrieth it, then leadeth the horse: A henne may not weare her hose sowed about her leg, but this marke must on friday be taken off. And if any cattell fall into a pit, yet may they not help it out on the Sab∣bath: so spitefully haue their Talmudicall Rabbines endeuoured to make (where they could not finde) a falshood in the Math.12.11 words of CHRIST, testifying the contrarie. But from the beginning it was not thus. The Iew may not milke his cattell, not eate of the milke when hee hath procured a Christian to milke them, except hee first buy it, but at his owne price. A Tayler may not weare a needle sticking on his garment. The lame may vse a staffe: the blinde may not. Clogges or Pattens to keepe them out of the durt they may not burden themselues with. It is lawful to carrie a plaister on their sores, but if it fall off, they may not lay it on againe: Nor may they bind vp a wound anew; nor carrie money in their purses or garments: nor rubbe their durty shooes a∣gainst the ground, though they may wipe it off against a wall: nor wipe their hands, fouled with durt, on a towell, but with a cowes or horse-taile they may do it. If a flea bite, he may remoue, but not kill it: a lowse he may. But their doctors disagree in this lowsie question: for R. Eliezer saith, One may as well kill a Camell. Hee must take heede of leauing more corne to foules that day then they shall eate, if it bee in an open place, lest it may there grow, and he be said to sowe corne on the Sabbath. To whistle a tune with his mouth, or play it on an instrument, is vnlawfull: as also to knock with the ring or hammer of a doore, and therefore the Clarke knockes with his hand when hee calleth them to the Synagogue. To knocke on a Table to still a childe; to draw a Letter in dust or ashes, or a moistned Table, is vnlawfull; in the aire not so. Of these Sabbath-labours they haue nine and thirtie chiefe Articles: whereto the smal∣ler (as these) are referred, with much ridiculous nicetie, as the first article is of tilling ground, wherein is reserued digging, filling vp ditches, &c. and to this, going ouer a fallow, rubbing his durty shooe on the ground &c. Tis time this ditch be now filled, and we proceede further.
CHAP. XVIII. The Iewish Passeouer, as they now obserue it, and other their Feasts and Fasts. OF the Iewish Feasts, as they were celebrated before the comming of CHRIST, wee haue already spoken. In these dayes they blindely and stubbornely persist in like Obseruation of times, though with some variation of ceremonie. Their Talmud reckoneth foure New-yeeres dayes, besides the former in March and September, whereof we haue spoken; the first of August beginneth their yeere of breeding cattell, accompting from thence their time of tything. In Ianuarie, the first, or as R. Hillel would haue it, the fifteenth beganne their new yeere for trees, in reckoning the time of lawfulnesse to eate, or tythe their fruit. The Their order of celebrating the Passeouer at this day. richer Iewes prepare thirtie dayes before for their Passe-ouer, (dentem, non mentem) good wheate for their vnleauened cakes. The Sabbath before the Passe∣uer is solemne and sacred, wherein they haue a Sermon concerning the Paschall Lambe. Two or three dayes before the Passeouer, they scowre their houshold im∣plements, of wood and mettall, with much curiositie and varietie of rites. For hee that in this Feast vseth an impure vessell, is as hee that hath laine by an vncleane woman. The night before the Feast, the goodman of the house with a waxe can∣dle, a dish and wing, beginneth his search for leauened bread; and with other men or boyes to help him, after their Amen to his blessing, with waxe candles in their hands, they leaue not a mouse-hole vnsearched, and hide that bread which they meane to eate that night, left they should finde that, and be forced to burne it. That which they finde, they curiously couer, left some mouse, by carrying it, should make them hauenew worke: and for this cause suppe also in a corner, with great care that nothing fall to the ground. When he hath ended his search, Whatsoeuer leauen (saith he) is vnder mine hands, which I haue not seene, let it be tossed to and fro, like the dust of the earth. In the morning they make their vnleauened cakes, of meale growned three dayes at least. The kneading trough must be lined with linnen, lest some of the leaue∣ned meale should cleaue thereto. The goodman himselfe must drawe the liquor that it is kneaded with, and that at Sun setting. The cakes are made with as much scruple, round, and pricked full of holes in a cold place &c. to keep them from leaueuing. They eate little, and the first-borne nothing, till night, that then they may haue the better Paschall-stomacke: at the Euensong they obserue much-what the same ceremonies, as at the Sabbath. They make at home the fairest shew of their plate and riches, and seate themselues on Chaires (as it were) of State, and account now of themselues as great Lords, triumphing ouer their late Aegyptian seruitude; at their returne from the Synagogue, they haue a dish with three cakes set before them, representing the high Priest, the Tribe of Leui, and the people of Israel: an other dish hath in it a loine of lambe or kidde, with a hard egge: an other containeth a gallimawfrey of apples, nuts, figges, almonds, &c. dressed with wine in bricke-fashion (with cinnamon strewd on it, in remembrance of the Aegyptian fornace. They haue also a sallet of herbs, and a sawcer of vineger set on the Table. Then sit they downe, and euery one (to the child in the cradle) hath his cup filled with wine. And here with a carowse after a bles∣sing begins the feast, with a scrupulous vse of these things mentioned: then followeth. The supper it selfe, with much riot till midnight, with such cheere as they haue, with diuers ceremonies, cursing their enemies, calling for Elias, praying for the reedifying of the Temple; vsing many, Diuine Attributes, as Mercifull God, great God, bountifull God, high God, faire God, sweet God, mightie God, and God of th∣Iewes now build thy Temple shortly, very soone, very soone, in our dayes, very soone, very soone. Now build, now build, now build, now build, now build thy Temple quickely; Strong God, lining God, &c. ouer and ouer with such battologies. This night they thinke themselues secure against men and Deuills; they leaue their doores
open all night to entertaine Elias; and one to their solace playeth Elias in a white lin∣nen garment. Each man drinketh foure Cuppes full of the blessed wine, in regard of foure deliuerances, which the Rabbins find in Exodus, 6. V. 6, 7. The ceremonies of Moses they are not tied to (forsooth) because they are not in Canaan. In the morning they visite the Synagogue with their Sabbath-rites. They bring two Bookes out of the Arke, and call forth fiue men (and if this feast be on the Sab∣bath, seuen) to reade out of the same. Nice are their determinations what workes they may doe on this day, and what not: they may dresse no more meate then is this day eaten. If they beate spice, the morter must lie side-wise, for distinctions sake of the day, &c. fasting and weeping must be auoided; if any farse a henne, the needle must be threeded the day before, and the threed must be burned, not bitten, or broken asun∣der. In such trifles, the Schoole of Schammai licenceth to eate the same day an egge laid on a festiuall day. Hillel denies it, and betwixt them they haue set the Rabbines by the cares, in this & such profane questions. Their Euensong hath a short dispatch: and then the next day they Abundans cauela non n∣cet. reiterate the same ceremonies, and that for certainty, be∣cause they doubt of the first day of the moneth, and therefore obserue two. The foure dayes following are halfe-holy-dayes. Some works may be done in them, and not some, and what they doe (to make a difference) must be done otherwise, as wri∣ting crooked &c. and that which cannot without losse be deferred, may now be done. The seuenth day they obserue in more complcate holinesse, and the eight too, for the reason before alleadged, to be more secure of the true day. After the feast ended, they satisfie with fasting their feasting-riots, and that on two mundaies and one thurs∣day: vnto the three and thirtieth day after, they are sadde and heauie, in remembrance of R. Akhiba, of whose disciples foure and twentie thousand died in that space, and were buried by women in the night: and therefore after Sunne set, all this while the women lay aside their worke: on the three and thirtie day the men bathe them and shaue their beards, and are merry, because then his disciples ceased dying. From the second night of their Pesach they number to their Pentecost Pentecost. fifty daies inclusiuely: and say, Blessed be thou, &c. which hast commaunded vs to number the daies before haruest, of which this is the first or second, &c. they number the same standing, praying withall for the restitution of Ierusalem. They let not bloud on the euen of the Pentecost, because of a supposed winde Tabbach, which should haue slaine all the Israelites, if they had refused next day to accept of the Lawes. They keep it two daies, for the former doubt. They take the Booke twice out of the Arke, and reade thereout the precepts concerning this Feasts sacrifices, now that they can∣not performe the things. In remembrance of receiuing the Law, they strew the paue∣ment of their houses, streets, and Synagogues with grasse. They eate meates made of milke & cakes. One cake they make seuen times folded in thicknes, in remembrance of the seuen heauens, by which GOD descended to Mount Sinai. Now they must haue good cheere, because at this time the King married his daughter, that is, the Law vnto them. The Tabernacles. Feast of Tabernacles is obserued eight daies: the two first, and two The last day they may kin∣dle fire from another, not strike fire with stone or met∣tall, nor quēch it, although to saue their goodes: nor blow it with bellowes, but with a reede they may: with many trifling obseruatiōs els mentioned by Munst. Praecept. Mos. cum ex∣pos. Rab. last more solemnely: the middle foure are halfe holie. They mutter ouer their praiers with such haste, that he is the perfectest who speaketh most with a breath. They make them Ta∣bernacles with boughs of 4 kindes of trees (more scrupulous then the Law) in which they suppe, but doe not lodge. The Precentor in the Synagogue taketh a bundle of boughs, & blesseth and shaketh them; for it is written, Psal.96.12. The trees shall clap their hands, and moueth them 3 times to the East, and as often to the West, and to the N. and S and then vp and downe like a Fencer, & then shaketh them againe, as hauing now put the deuill to flight. Then one taketh out the Booke, and laieth it on the Pulpit, which they all with their boughs compasse seuen times a day, during the Feast; in hope of like destruction to the Christians as befell Iericho, and then renew their shaking of their boughs. The seuenth day is most solemne: then they produce seuen Books, and in euery of their seuen compassings lay vp one again. This night they know their for∣tunes by the Moone: for stretching out their armes, if they see not the shadow of their
head by Moone-light, they must die that yeare; If a finger wanteth, hee looseth a friend; if the shadow yeeld him not a hand, he looseth a son; the want of the left hand portendeth losse of a daughter; If no shadow, no life shall abide with him, for it is written: Num.14.9. Their shadow departed from them. Some Iewes goe yerely into Spaine, to prouide pome-citrons and other necessaries, for the furnishing this feast: which they sell in Germany, and other places to the Iewes at excessiue prices. They keepe their Tabernacles in all weathers, except a very vehement storme driue them with a hea∣uie countenance into their houses. Their wiues and seruants are not so strictly tied hereto. The New Moon∣day. new Moons are at this day but halfe festiuall to the Iewes, accounting them∣selues free to worke, or not, in them; but the women keepe it intirely festiuall, be∣cause they denied their Eare-rings to the molten Calfe, which after they bestow∣ed willingly on their Tabernacle. The deuouter Iewes fast the day before. Their Mattins is with more prayers, their dinner with more checre then on other dayes: and a great part of the day after they sit at Cardes, or telling of Tales. That day when the Moone is eclipsed, they fast. When they may first see the new Moone, they assemble, and the chiefe Rabbi pronounceth a long prayer, the rest saying af∣ter him. The Iewes beleeuing that GOD created the world, in September or Tisri, con∣ceit also, that at the reuolution of the same time yearely, hee sitteth in iudgement, and out of the books taketh reckoning of euerie mans life, and pronounceth sentence accordingly. That New-yeares day. day which their great Sanhedrin ordained the New-yeeres festi∣uall, GOD receiuing thereof intelligence by his Angels, sent thither to know the same, causeth the same day a Senate of Angells to be assembled, as it is written, Da∣niel 12. All things prouided in the solemnest manner, the three Bookes are opened; one, of the most wicked, who are presently registred into the Booke of Death: the se∣cond, of the iust, who are inrolled into the Booke of Life: and the third, of the meane sort, whose iudgement is demurred vntill the day of Reconciliation, (the tenth of Tisri,) that if in the meane time they seriously repent them so, that their good may exceed their euill, then are they entred into the Booke of life; if otherwise, they are recorded in the Blacke Bill of Death. Their Scripture is produced by R. A∣ben. Psalme 69.28 Let them be blotted out of the Booke of the Liuing, and not be written with the iust. Blotting points you to the Booke of Death: Liuing, that of Life; and not writing with the iust, is the third Booke of Indifferents. All the workes which a man hath done through the yeare, are this day examined: The good workes are put in one balance, the bad in the other (what helpe a siluer Chalice or such heauy mettall could afford in this case, you may finde by experience in Saint Francis Legend, who, when the badde deedes of a great man, lately dead, out-weighed the good, at a dead lift caft in a siluer Chalice, which the dead partie had sometime bestowed on Franciscan de∣uotion, and weighed vp the other side, and so the Deuills lost their prey:) GOD (say they) pronounceth sentence of punishment or reward, sometime in this life to be executed, sometime in the other. In respect hereof, their Rabbines ordaine the moneth before to be spent in penance, and morning and euening to sound a Trum∣pet of a Rammes horne, as an Aue Mary-Bell, to warne them of this Iudgement, that they may thinke of their sinnes; and besides to befoole the Deuill, that with this of∣ten sounding being perplexed, hee may not know when this New-yeares day shall be, to come into the Court to giue euidence against them. The day before they rise sooner in the morning, to mutter ouer their prayers for remission: and when they haue done in the Synagogue, they goe to the graues in the Church-yard, testifying, that if GOD doe not pardon them, they are like to the dead, and praying, that for the good workes of the Saints (the iust Iewes there buried) hee will pittie them, and there they giue large almes. Afternoone, they shaue, adorne, and bathe themselues, that they may be pure the next day; (for some Angells, soiled with impuritie heere below, are faine to purge themselues in the fiery brooke Dinor, before they can praise GOD; how much more they?) and in the Water they make Confession
of their sinnes; the Confession containeth two and twentie wordes, the number of their Alphabet; and at the pronouncing of euerie word, giue a knocke on their breast; and then diue wholly vnder water. The Feast it selfe they beginne with a Cuppe of Wine, and New-yeere Salutations: and on their Table haue a Rammes head, in remembrance of Gen.22.18. That Ramme which was offered in Isaacs stead: and for this cause are their Trumpets of Rammes horne: Fish they eate, to signifie the multi∣plication of their good workes: they eate sweete fruits of all sorts, and make them∣selues merrie, as assured of forgiuenesse of their sinnes: and after meate, all of all sortes, resort to some bridge, to hurle their sinnes into the water: as it is written, Mich.7.19 Hee shall cast all our sinnes into the bottome of the Sea. And if they there espie anie Fish, they leape for ioy, these seruing to them as the Scape-goate, to carrie away their sinnes. At night they renew their cheere, and end this Feast. From this day to the tenth day Reconcilia∣tion. , is a time of Penance or Lent, wherein they fast and pray for the cause aforesaid; and that if they haue beene written in the Booke of Death, yet GOD seeing their good workes, may repent, and write them in the Life-Booke. Hospinian ex Lombard. Thrice a day verie early they confesse three houres before day, and sur∣cease suites at Lawe, &c. And on the ninth day verie earely they resort to the Syna∣gogue; and at their returne, euerie male taketh a Cocke, and euerie female a Henne; if shee bee with childe, both: and the Housholder, saying out of the hundred and fift Psalme, verses 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and out of Iob chapter 23. vers. 23, 24, 25. swingeth the Cocke three times about his head, euerie time saying, This Cocke shall make an exchange for mee: hee shall die for mee: and I shall goe into life with all the people of Israel, Amen. Hee doth it three times, for himselfe, for his children, for the strangers that are with him. Then hee killeth him, and cutteth his throat, and hur∣leth him with all his force to the ground, and roasteth him: signifying that he him∣selfe deserueth death, the sword, stoning, and fire: the inwards they hurle on the toppe of the house, that the Crowes may, with it, carrie away their sinnes. A white Cocke for this purpose is principall; a redde Cocke they vse not, for they are full of sinne themselues by Esaias authoritie, Esa.1.18. If your sinnes were redde as scarlet &c. Ant. Margar. An∣tonius Margarita saith, That this propitiatorie creature should be an Ape, as most like to a man; but they vse a Cocke for the names sake: a man in Hebrew is Geh∣ber, which is the Talmudicall or Babylonish name of a Cocke. Thus those that with a Rammes horne beguiled the Deuill, and with a Cocke beguiled GOD, iustly beguiled themselues, who refuse that Sacrifice of CHRIST, in whose stripes they might bee healed. After the performance of this Cocke-sacrifice, they goe to the buriall-place, vsing like ceremonies there, as on New-yeeres euen: and after noone, bathe them like∣wise. After Euensong, hee which hath offended others, askes them forgiuenesse, which if hee obtaine not at first, then the offender taketh with him three other, and asketh the second and third time: if all this bee in vaine, hee taketh tenne others and reneweth his suite; if hee obtaine, it is well; if not, GOD will holde him ex∣cused, and the other partie shall bee guiltie; if the partie offended bee dead, the offender, with tenne other goeth to the graue, and there confesseth his faults. They confesse one to an other also, and that in a secret place of their Synagogue, where each receiueth mutually at his fellowes hand with a leather belt nine and thirtie blowes: at each blow the partie beaten beateth himselfe on the breast, and saith one word of his Confession, taken out of the seuentie and eight Psalm and eight and thirtith Yet he being mercifull &c. verse, being in the Hebrew fifteene words, which hee thrice repeateth: then the striker lieth downe and receiueth like penance at the hands of the former, you may iudge with what rigour. This done, they runne home, and make merrie with the Cockes and Hennes before mentioned, supping largely, because of the next dayes fast. Their supper must bee ended before Sunne set: for then beginneth their fast. They put on their cleanest rayment, and ouer the same, a great and large shirt downe to the shooes, to testifie their puritie. They resort to their Synagogues
with waxe candles (in Germanie they haue for euerie man one) and then light them. The women also light Candles at home, as on the Sabbath. It is ominous, if the Candles burne not cleerely. They spread the floore with Carpets, for soyling their purest clothes. Their humiliations at this Feast are fiue: first, foure and twentie, or seuen and twentie houres fast, whereunto children are subiect: the males after twelue yeares, the females after eleuen. Their fiue humiliations at the Feast of Reconciliatiō. Secondly, they weare no shooes. Thirdly, they must not annoint them. Fourthly, nor bathe them, no not put a finger into the water. Fistly, nor company with, no not touch their wiues. Before they beginne praiers, thirteene of the principall Rabbies, walking in the Temple, giue licence to all, both good and bad, to pray. And the Praecentor or Reader fetcheth the Booke out of the Arke, and openeth it, singing a long prayer, beginning all compacts, vowes, and oathes, &c. insinuating, that all the vowes, promises, oathes, and couenants which euerie Iew had that yeare broken, be disanulled and pardoned: and that, because now all haue power to pray and praise GOD. They continue singing till late in the night. Some remaine all night in the Synagogue: yea the deuouter some stand vpright singing and praying without intermission all that feast, the space of seuen and twentie houres in the same place. Those that departed the Synagogue, returne in the morning before day, and there stay all that day. Often they prostrate themselues with their face coue∣red, at euery word of their Confessions knocking their breast. When it beginneth to be night, the Priest draweth his Talles (a large cloth made of haires) before his eies, and pronounceth the blessing, Numb. 6. holding his hand towards the people, who meane-while couer their faces with their hands: for they may not looke on the Priests hand, because the Spirite of God resteth thereon. Then hee singeth a prayer se∣uen times together, sometimes higher, sometimes lower with his voyce: because that God now ascendeth from: them into the seuenth Heauen: and they with their sweete melodie bring him on the way. Then they make a long and shrill sound with their Rammes-horne-trumpet: and there followeth presently a voyce from Heauen, Goecate thy bread with ioy and gladnesse &c. After this they returne home, some carrying home their Lights, to distinguish the holie Times (as you haue heard) from the prophane: some leaue them in the Synagogue all the yeere, at certayne times lighting them. Some Saint-Iewes prouide to haue a waxe-light con∣tinually burning all the yeere long in the Synagogue. In their returne they wish to each other a good yeere. For the Bookes, before mentioned, are now closed; nor may they expect any alteration. They suppe largely, and betimes the next mor∣ning returne to the Synagogue, lest Sathan should complaine at so soone a cooling of their zeale. But the Deuill may be quiet; for when the Lawe was giuen, Pirke.ca.46. Sam∣mael the euill spirite complained, that hee had power ouer all people, but the Israe∣lites: God answered, That hee should haue power ouer them, if on the Recon∣ciliation-day hee found anie sinne in them: But hee finding them pure, said, That this his people were like the Angells, liuing in vnitie, without eating or drinking. The Iewes haue a ceremonie to giue the Deuill gifts on this day, either not to hinder them: or else, because Exod.23.8 Gifts blinde the wise. The Iewes diuide the Law into two and fiftie parts, and reading euerie Sabbath one, the last falleth on the next day after the Feast of Tabernacles, about the three and twentieth day of September. In this The Feast of the Lawe fini∣shed, day they leape, daunce, and make much ioy. They assemble in their Synagogue, and take all the Bookes of the Lawe out of the Arke (leauing in it meane-while, that it be not left emptie, a burning light) they reade the first Lecture and the last thereof, and leape about the Arke with the Bookes; and they hurle peares, nuttes, and such fruits among the youth, which in their scrambling sometimes fall together by the eares, and marre the sport. On this day they sell their Synagogue-offices, the Clarke making proclamation: who will giue most at the third time, obtaineth first the office of lighting the Lights all the yeare, then that of prouiding the Wine, which they vse to beginne the Feasts with,
in respect of the poore, which haue no wine to hallow at home. Thirdly, Is set to sale the office Geldab, of foulding vp, & vnfolding the Law. Fourthly, Hagbohah, of lifting vp the Law, and carrying it in Procession. Fifthly, The office Etz-chaim, of tou∣ching those turned peeces of wood, whereto the Law is fastened: which the young men are forward to buy, in hope of holinesse and longer life. Sixthly, Acheron; to be called forth last on the festiuall dayes, to reade somewhat of the Law. Seuenthly, Schetria, to be deputed or substituted inplace of the negligent officer, &c. The mo∣ney, hence arising, is for the vse of the poore, and reparations of their Synagogue: but in these sale-offices, wealth hath more honor then worthinesle. Their Feast of Dedication, we cannot say much more of, then that which alreadie hath beene said: much nicenesse herein is obserued, about the lights where with they solemnize this darknesse, which I willingly omit: these lights they vse in their houses all the space of these eight daies burning. Their Hospinianus cx M. Lombard. Feast of Lots they keepe with all riot two dayes, as with some at Shroue∣tide: the men disguising themselues in womens habite; the women in mens: they quaffe and drinke (it is saith Rabbi Isaac, Tirna, a good worke) till they find no diffe∣rence betweene Arur Haman and Baruch Mordecai: curjed be Haman, Blessed bee Mordecai; vociferations that day obserued. They Hospin. obserue festiuall the Equinoctials and Solstices; and a certaine Rogation day: they vse the Fasts before mentioned out of Zach. 7. with other superstitions. Some of them Syn. Iud. Ruxdorf. Fast also, as is said, on Mondayes and Thursdayes; and some on the tenth of March for the death of Miriam: at whose departure, a certaine fountaine dried vp, and the people were left without water: but in this month the most Rabbins will not allow fasting, because of their deliuerance therein out of Egypt. Some fast for the death of Samuel, Aprill 28. and for the taking of the Arke, Aprill 10. and at other times for other Prophets. Some fast on the new-moones euen: some, when they haue had an infortunate dreame; and all that day in which their father died, through their whole life. Their fasting is an abstinence from all eating and drinking till night. But of these Fasts and other their solemnities, is said before in the abstract of their Kalender, taken out of Ioseph Scaliger. CHAP. XIX. Of their Ceremonies and opinions concerning the Dead. IF we should lead you thorow their Kitchin, and there shew you their two sorts of vessels and implements; one for flesh, the other for whit∣meats and fish: as likewise they haue two kniues, for the same pur∣pose, and (if it were possible) would haue two mouthes; (that which they can) they make much cleansing betweene: and if these vessels should be mingled, they must be broken, if they be of earth; washed, if of wood; and purged by fire, if of iron: with other their cookery-rites and ceremo∣nies. If I should thence lead you to the Shambles, and acquaint you with the curious qualifications of a Iewish Butcher: Of which argument they haue a booke to instruct them: in more difficult questions, they consult with the learned Rabbi; whose li∣cence the Butcher must haue for his slaughtering, before a Iew may eate of his meate. If in these cases, and in other quiddities of marriages, of diuorces, of marrying the wife of the deceased brother, of womens vncleannes, of their prouision for the poore, of the penalties inflicted on offenders, &c. I should tire the Reader, to whom I feare I haue already bin ouer tedious. But in this matter of Religiō, of whom is it fitter to pro∣tract discourse, then of them, whom the old world yeelded the only example of Truth, and the present age, a principal example of falshood & superstitiō? Let it not grieue the
Reader, to performe the last office of humanitie to our Iew, and as hee hath seene his birth, his Synagogue-Rites, and home-superstitions, so to visite him on his death-bed and helpe lay him in his graue: and examine his hope of the resurrection, and of their Messias, and we will end our pilgrimage in this Holy Land. When Ceremonies about the sick. a man lieth sicke, the Rabbines visite him; and if he be rich, order is taken for his will, and then they exhort him to perseuere constantly in their faith. They aske him if hee beleeue that the Messias is yet to come. Hee maketh his confession on his bedde, saying; I confesse before thee my GOD and LORD, GOD of my pa∣rents, LORD of all Creatures, that my health and death is in thy hand, I pray thee grant mee recouerie of my former health, and heare my prayer, as thou diddest heare Hezekiah in his sicknesse. And if the time of my death bee come, then grant that death may bee my remission of all my sinne, which of ignorance or knowledge I haue committed, euer since I was a man: grant that I may haue my part in Paradise, and the world to come, which is reserued for the iust: grant that I may know the way of euerlasting life, fill mee with the ioy of thy excellent countenance by thy right hand for euer. Blessed be thou O GOD which hearest my prayer. Thus they which refuse the merits of CHRISTS death, ascribe remission of sinnes to their owne. When hee And about the dead in the house. giueth vp the ghost, all the standers by rend their garments, but in a certaine place of the same, where they doe no great harme, about a hand-breadth. They lament the dead seuen dayes. They present∣ly after his death powre out all the water in the house into the streete: they co∣uer his face that it may no more bee seene: they bowe his thumbe in his hand, fra∣ming a resemblance of the Hebrew name Schaddai: his other fingers are stretched out, to testifie a forsaking of the world: they wash him with hot water, and ha∣uing annointed his head with wine and the yolke of an egge mixed together, they put on him a white vestment, which hee vsed to weare on the Feast of Recon∣ciliation. When they carrie him out of the house, they hurle after him a broken sherd, signifying, that with him all heauinesse should be expelled and broken. When they are come to the place At the graue. of buriall, they say, Blessed be GOD, which hath for∣med you with Iudgement and Iustice, hath created, fed, sustained, and at last hath de∣prmed you of life (speaking to the dead.) He knoweth the number of you all, and will quicken you againe in his time. Blessed be GOD, which doth to die, and maketh a∣liue. Then with some other Ceremonie they commit the corps to ground, his kins∣men putting in the first earth. When After the buriall. they returne, they throw grasse ouer their heads, signifying their hope of the Resurrection. In the Porch of the Synagogue, GOD Esay 25.8. shall destroy death for euer (say they) and wipe away all teares from their eyes, and will take away their reproach from all the earth, for the LORD hath spo∣ken it. Then enter they into the Synagogue, and leape vp and downe, and change their Seates seuen times, and there say ouer their Purgatorie prayer Kaddisch. The mourners goe bare-foot seuen dayes, and eat not Flesh, nor drinke Wine, ex∣cept on the Sabbaths and Festiuals. They bathe not in three and thirtie dayes af∣ter, cut not their nayles, make a pitifull howling, &c. The first night the mourner eateth nothing of his owne, but meat sent him from his friends. The child mour∣neth for his father a yeare. The sonne, eleuen monethes, sayeth ouer his Kad∣disch, for meane sinners are freed sooner: but the wicked stay the whole twelue moneths: and therefore to persist the twelfth moneth in his prayer, should bee to acknowledge his father a wicked man. And for this effect hereof, Rabbi Akib∣ha met once in the way a man, with an Asse-like burthen of stickes, which vpon examination confessed, That he was a Purgatorie-ghost carrying, to burne him∣selfe, such bundles euery day. Rabbi Akibha enquired if he had a sonne or wife, and where; and finding out his sonne, taught him this prayer, which was so ef∣fectuall, that in a dreame this Ghost returned to the Rabbi with thankes, for his deliuerance, and said he was now in Gan Eden, or Paradise. Rabbi Akibha signified this to the Iewish Synagogues, with iniunction to teach their children this prayer.
Thus poore Purgatorie with Iewes and Romists is preached by walking ghosts. They haue a light burning for the dead seuen daies. They powre the water out of doores, be∣cause the Angell of Death washeth his sword (lately vsed) in water, and enuenometh it. This his sword he holdeth in his hand at the beds head, hauing on the end thereof three drops of gall: The sicke man spying this Deadly angell, openeth his mouth with feare, and then those drops fall in, of which one killeth him, the second maketh him pale; the third rotteth, and putrifieth. CHAP. XX. The Iewes faith and hope touching their Messias. THe Iewes generally beleeue, hope, and pray for a Messias; but such a one, whose kingdome shall be of this world, and who shall (to vse the Apostles .1.6. phrase, who were also, euen after CHRISTS death and resurrection, partakers of this dreame) restore the Kingdome to Israel. And because the Scripture speaketh somewhat of the poore, contemp∣tible, and deiected state, of the promised Messias, sometimes of the pu∣issance, renowne, and glory of his kingdome: they therefore frame to their conceits, two Messiahs, one poore and simple, but a mighty warriour, whom they call Messias Ben-Ioseph: the other, Messias Ben-Dauid; after the other in time, but before him in glo∣ry, & the true Messias: howsoeuer euen this also be in their opinions but a meere man, and one which shall marry and leaue behind him a remaining and raigning posteritie. The ancient Iewes looked for this Messias to be sent them about this time, when IESVS came in the flesh: as that Prophecie which is fathered on Elias testifieth, to wit, that the world should be 2000. yeares Tohu, emptie and without Law, 2000. vn∣der the Law, 2000. vnder the Messias: and accordingly CHRIST IESVS came into the world about the yeare after the Creation, 3963. The Iewes reckon 202. years fewer in all their computations, then the Christians. Vpon this occasion, and in regard of the generall expectation of the Messias, about that time rose so many Sects & espe∣cially that rebellion of Ben-Cochab, before spoken of, to whom R. Akibha (famous for his 24000. disciples) gaue testimony, and called him Messias the King. But this Ben∣cochab, the sonne of the Starre, Numb. 23. was by Adrian (as you haue seene) besie∣ged, taken, and executed, and was called after Ben-Cozabh, the sonne of lying. They therefore, when as they found no Messias, said, that the time was deferred, because of their sins: and after renounced Anathema to him, that should set downe the time of his comming. And being conuinced in their consciences, that the . Prophecies of this time were already past and accomplished, they affirmed in their writings, that he was then borne, but did not yet reueale himselfe, because of their sinnes. R. Salomon Iarchi wri∣teth, that the ancient Iewes thought he was borne on that day in which Ierusalem was last destroyed; but vncertaine where he hath lien hidde. Some say that he abideth in Paradise tied by the haire of a womans head: so interpreting that of the Canticles. The haire of thy head is as purple, The King is tied in the rafters; by rafters meaning Para∣dise. The Talmudists write, that he lay at the gates of Rome among the Lazars and Leapers, according to Esay 53. Before he commeth, they write, that ten notable miracles shall happen to warne them thereof. First, GOD shall raise vp three Kings, which shall make profession of the true Faith, but shall indeed betray it, and seduce men, and cause them to deny GOD. The louers of the Truth shall flee and hide themselues in caues, and holes of the earth, and these Tyrants shall pursue and slay them. Then shall there be no King in Israel (as it is Hosh.3.4. written) no Pastors, no holy men. The heauens shall be shut vp, the people shall be made few: for these Tyrants, (which yet by diuine dispensation shall raigne but three moneths) shall impose ten times as much, as was before exacted, and they which haue not to pay shall lose their heads. And from the ends of the earth, shall
come men, blacke and loathsome; the dread of whose countenance shall kill men: for they shall haue two heads and seuen eyes, sparkling like fire. The second Miracle shall be a great heate of the Sunne, causing Feuers, Pestilences, and other diseases, so that the Gentiles shall digge themselues graues, and there lie and wish for death. But the Israelites shall haue this heate to be as a wholesome medi∣cine to them: so interpreting the Malac.4.2. Prophet. GOD shall make a bloudie dew fall on the earth, of which the people, and the wic∣ked of the Israelites shall drinke, thinking it to be good water, and shall die: it shall not hurt Dan.12.3. the inst, who shall shine, &c. Fourthly, GOD shall make a wholesome dew to fall, whereof the indifferent mea∣ner sinners, sicke of the former dew, shall drinke and liue, Hos.14.6. Fifthly, The Ioel2.31. Sunne shall be darkened thirtie daies, and then receiue againe his light, whereby many shall embrace Iudaisme. Sixthly, GOD, shall permit the Edomites (or Romans) to rule ouer all the world: but one especially at Rome shal raigne nine moneths ouer all the world, wasting large countries, laying heauy tributes vpon the Israelites. Then shall the Israelites haue no helper (as saith Esai. 49.16.) But after nine moneths GOD shall send Messias Ben-Io∣seph. of the children of Ioseph, whose name shall be Nehemias, the sonne of Husiel. He shall come with the race of Ephraim, Manasse, Beniamin and Gad, and the Israelites hearing of it, shall flocke to him, as Ieremie sheweth, Ierem.5.14. Conuert ye to the LORD yerobel∣lious children, I will take yee, one of a Citie, and two of a Tribe, &c. This Messias shall o∣uerthrow the Edomites, and slay their King, and destroying the Empire, shall carrie to Ierusalem holy vessells, reserued in the house of Aelian for a treasure. The King of E∣gypt also shall make peace with the Israelites, and shall kill the men about Ierusalem, Damascus, and Ascalon; the fame whereof shall affright all the inhabitants of the earth. Seuenthly, There is at Rome a marble image of a virgin, not made by mans hand, to which shall resort all the wicked of the world, and shall incestuously conuerse there∣with. Hence shall GOD frame an Infant in the same, which shall with breach of the marble come forth. This shall be named Armillus the wicked, the same which the Christians call Antichrist, of ten elles quantitie of breadth and length; a span-breadth betweene his eyes, which shall be red and deepe in his head; his haire yellow, the soles of his feet greene, deformed with two heads. Hee shall professe himselfe the Romane Messias and GOD, and shall be accepted of them. He shall bid them bring him the law which he hath giuen them, which they shall bring with their prayer-booke: he shall cause them to beleeue in him; and shall send embassadors to Nehemias the sonne of Husiel, and to the people of Israel, commanding them also to bring him their Law, and to acknowledge him for GOD. Then shall Nehemias goe vnto Armillus with three hundred thousand Ephramites, carrying with him the Booke of the Law; and when he comes at him, he shall reade out of the same this sentence, I am the LORD thy GOD, thou shalt haue none other gods in my sight. Armillus shall reply, that there is no such sentence in their Law, and therefore they should acknowledge him for GOD, as well as the Gentiles. Then shall Nehemias ouerthrow two hundred thousand of Ar∣millus his armie; whereat Armillus shall be so wrathfull, that he shall assemble all his forces into a deepe valley, and there shall destroy (with many other Israelites) this Ne∣hemias. But the Angels shall take and hide him, that Armillus may not know of his death, lest he should not leaue one of Israel liuing. All Nations shall then expell the Is∣raelites, and such affliction shall befall them, as neuer since the beginning of the world. At this time shall the Angell Michael come forth, and separate the wicked from Israel, as writeth Cap.12.vers.1. Daniel. They which remaine shall flee into the desert, and for fiue and for∣tie daiesspace, liue with grasse, and leaues, and herbes; but all the wicked Israelites shall die. Armillus shall after subdue Egypt, and shall turne thence against Ierusalem, and seeke againe to waste it. These things after their manner they fable out of the ele∣uenth and twelfth of Daniel. The eighth Miracle is the arising of Michael, who three times shall winde his great horne Es.27.13. and Zach. 9. 14. At the first sound, the true Messias Ben-Dauid, and
Elias the Prophet, shall shew themselues to those deuout Israelites in the deserts of Iu∣da, who shall then gather courage: and all the Iewes in the world shall heare this sound, and shall confesse GODS deliuerance, and all that haue beene led captiue in∣to Assyria, shall assemble together. The same horne shall strike feare and diseases into the Christians, and other people. Now shall the Iewes make great iorneyes towards Ierusalem, and together with Elias and Messias shall come thither with ioy. Armillus hearing this, in his proud furie shall re-assemble his Christians against the Messias and Ierusalem. But GOD not suffering his people to fall out of one trouble into another, shall say to the Messias, Come place thy selfe at my right hand; and to the israelites, Be still, and waite for the great succour of the LORD this day. And then shall GOD raine fire and brimstone from heauen, as Ezekiel Ezec.38.22. reporteth, wherewith Armillus and his armie shall die, and Obad.18. the house of Iacob shall bee as fire, and the house of Ioseph as a flame, and the house of Esau (the Idumaean Atheists which destroyed GODS house) as stubble. At the second sound, or blast of this horne of Michael, the graues at Ierusalem shall open, and the dead arise, and Messias Ben-Dauid with Elias, shall reuoke into life that Messias Ben-Ioseph: and the Israelites shall send Messias Ben-Dauid into all countries of the Iewes dispersion, to cause them to come to Ierusalem; and the Nations with whom they are, shall bring them in their chariots, and on their shoulders. The last Miracle, is the third time of Michaels winding his horne, when GOD shall bring forth all the Iewes, which are by the riuers Gosan, Lachbach, Chabor, and in the Cities of Iuda, and they without number or measure, shall with their infants en∣ter into the Paradise of Moses; and the ground before them and behind them shall be meere fire, which shall leaue no sustenance to the Christians. And when the ten Tribes shall depart out of the Nations, then the pillar of the cloud of Diuine glorie shall compasse them, and GOD shall goe before them, and shall open to them the foun∣taines flowing from the tree of life, Esah49.10. Against these ten miraculous signes, fore-shewing Messias his comming, the most being full of troubles, they haue ten consolations. First, The certaintie of Messias com∣ming. Secondly, That he shall gather them from all places of the dispersion, Ierem. 31.8. but the lame there mentioned shall be so cured, that Esay 35.. they shall leape as Harts, &c. Thirdly, GOD will raise vp the dead. Fourthly, GOD will erect a third Temple, ac∣cording to the figure of that in Ezekiel 41. Fifthly, That the Israelites shall then raigne ouer all the earth, Esay 60. 12. yea all the world shall be subiect to the Law, Soph.3.9. Sixthly, God will destroy all their enemies, Ezech.25.14. Seuenthly, God will take from them all diseases, Esay 33.24. Eightly, God will prolong their liues, that they shall liue as long as an Oke, Esay 65.22. and as in the times from Adam to Noe. Ninth∣ly, They shall see God face to face, Esai. 40.5. and they shall all prophecie, Ioel 2.28. Tenth∣ly, God shall take away from them all euill concupiscence, and inclination to euill, Ezech.36.26. Thus farre out of the booke Abhkas Rochel. Their cheere in these daies shall be the greatest beasts, birds, and fishes, which God euer created; and no other wine then what grew in Paradise, and was kept in Adams celler till that time: the great Oxe Behemoth mentioned in Iob 40.10. Iob, and Psal, 50.10. All the beasts of the wood are mine, and the beasts feeding on a thousand hills, that is, Behemoth which euery day feedeth on a thousand hilles. But left this deuouring beast should consume all the hilles in the world, they tell you that he is a stalled Oxe, still abiding in the same place, and what he eateth in the day, groweth againe in the night. The huge Whale Leuiathan, or as they pronounce it, Lipiasan, must honor also this Feast: of this they write in the Baua Basra; cap.5. Talmud; that to preuent filling the world with these huge monsters, God gelded the male Leuiathan, and the female is slaine, and preserued in pickle, for the iust, to be eaten in the times of the Messias, Esay 27. The male Behe∣moth was gelded also, and the female was stored vp for this feast. Elias Leuita repor∣teth of a huge huge bird, also called Barinchne, to be rosted at this feast; of which the Bechoros cap. vlt. Talmud saith, that an egge, sometime falling out of her nest, did ouerthrow and
breake downe three hundred tall cedars; with which fall the egge, being broken, ouer∣flowed and carried away sixtie Villages. We will haue the whetstone before we part. R. Barchonnah saw a Frogge as bigge as Akra, a Village of sixtie housholds: then came a huger Serpent and swallowed that huge Frogge. Lastly, the hugest hugest Crow that euer the Rabbin saw, slew and deuoured these both; and flying away, sate on a tree, which tree sure could not be lesse then the three hundred cedars before men∣tioned, if this crow were but as bigge as that egge. R. Papa answereth, that he would neuer haue beleeued it, but that he saw it (I hope they will pardon vs if wee be of the same mind). Rabbi Kimchi on the fiftieth Psalme auerreth out of Rabbi Iehudah, that Ziz is a bird so great, that with spreading abroad his wings, hee hideth the Sunne, and darkeneth all the world. And (to leape backe into the Talmud) a certaine Rabbi sai∣ling on the sea, saw a bird in Like the fish in the Legend of Saint Bran∣don, who if he could bring his taile to his mouth, would ouerturne the world Leg. aur. the middle of the sea, so high, that the water reached but to her knees; whereupon he wished his companions there to wash, because it was so shallow: Doe it not (saith a voice from heauen) for it is seuen yeares space since a hat∣chet by chance falling out of a mans hand in this place, and alwaies descending, is not yet come at the bottome. I perceiue by your incredulous smiles, you will scarce be∣leeue Cholm. cap.3. that a Lion in the wood Ela, roared so dernely, that all the women in Rome, (foure hundred miles from thence) for verie horrour proued abortiue: and when hee came an hundred miles neerer, his terrible noise shooke the teeth out of all the Ro∣mans heads; and the Emperour himselfe, that caused the Rabbi to obtaine of GOD by his prayers to make this triall of the Lion, fell downe from his throne halfe dead; and with much importunitie requested his helpe, to cause him retire to his denne. But this roaring hath almost marred our feast. Our wine you haue heard of, fetched out of Adams celler, Esay 27. 2. 3. and Psal. 75.9. Before the feast, Messias will cause these prettie creatures, Behemoth and Le∣uiathan Iob 40.15. Psal.104.26. to play together, and make them sport: but when they haue wearied them∣selues in the fight, Messias with his sword shall kill them both, Esay 27.1. Then fol∣loweth the feast, and afterwards his marriage: Psal.45.10. Kings daughters shall be among thine ho∣norable women: at thy right hand standeth the Queene in the gold of Ophir: amongst the Messias his excellent women (Rabbi Kimchi expoundeth) shall be Kings daughters, for euerie King shall repute it his owne glorie to bestow a daughter on the Mes∣sias: but the true Queene shall be one of the fairest Israelites daughters, and shall continually conuerse with him, whereas the others must come onely at call. Hee shall thus beget children, which shall raigne after him Esay 53. 10. when hee is dead. Now the state of the Iewes in his time shall bee such, that the Christians shall free∣ly build them houses, and Cities, and till their grounds, and bestow on them their goods: yea Princes shall serue them: and they shall walke in faire garments, Esai. 60. 10. 11. 12. and Esai. 61. 5. 6. The aire also shall bee new and holesome, Esay 65. 17. by the benefit whereof they shall abide sound, and liue long, and in their age bee as fresh as if they were yong, Psalme 92. 14. 15. The wheate once sowen shall alway grow vp of it selfe, no otherwise then the Vines, Hosea 14.8. And if any shall desire any raine for his field, or garden, or one herbe by it selfe, hee shall haue it, Zachar. 10. 11. Then shall bee peace among men and beasts, Hosea 2. 19. Esay 11. 7. if there arise any warre among the Gentiles, the Messias shall accord them, Esay 2.4. They shall liue in great felicitie, full of the knowledge and praise of GOD. The earth shall be full hereof, &c. Thus haue wee heard the infancie of the Church in the time of her nonage, and of those Hebrew Patriarches: wee haue seene also their present Infancie in these Iewish fables, the iust reward of Iohn3.13. Louing darkenesse, rather then light. And so with our prayers to GOD, at last to take that Veile of Moses from their hearts, that there may bee One proper Shepheard, and one sheepefold, and that meane while wee may learne preciously to esteeme, and reuerently to make vse of that light we haue; warned
by the spectacle of Diuine Iustice in them, through so many eyes blinded in so palpa∣ble fooleries; wee will now leaue them and this Holy Land, and seeke further what aduentures wee shall light on in the next neighbouring Nations; hoping and crauing for pardon of such prolixitie in this part of our discourse, fittest, of all the other in this part of our worke, to be considered. CHAP. XXI. Of the hopes and hinderances of the Iewes Conuersion. WHen I had now (as I thought) brought this Iewish Relation to an end, and euen wearied the Reader with that which might much more wea∣rie the Writer: that Prophecie of Rom.11. 25.26. Paule, That all Israell shall be sa∣ued, &c. which by most Interpreters is construed of the generall con∣uersion of that Nation, after the fullnesse of the Gentiles be come in (as in the beginning of this Worke is said) caused my straying penne (readie to wander from these, so farre wandering from their holy progenitors) to vndertake this taske, also to declare, what future hopes, and what present feares and lets may be concei∣ued of their conuersion to Christianitie. The hope (though it be yet tossed vpon sur∣ges of almost-desperate Seas, yet) hath anchoram sacram, a sure anchor to relye on, and a kinde of obscure kenning of that wished-for Hauen, where it would be. For P. Mart. in Rom. c.11. Non ita perierunt ad vnum Iudei, vt nulla supersit de illorum salute spes. The destru∣ction of the Iewes (sayth Peter Martyr) is not so desperate, but that there is some hope left of their saluation. And a little after, (alluding to the Apostles mysterie) Cum enim plenitudo fuerit tam ad Christum conuersa ex Gentibus, tunc & Israelitae acce∣dent: For when there shall haue beene a full conuersion of the Gentiles vnto CHRIST, then shall the Iewes also come in. So Chrysostome; Tom.2.Hom. 12. in Marc. de verbis Dom. circa ficum. Quis subintra∣nit plenitudo Gentium, in nouissimo saluabitur omnis Israel; because the fulnesse of the Gentiles hath come in, at last all Israell shall be saued. The same hope is generally cherished by the rest of the Fathers: yet doth indeede depend more vpon Diuine goodnesse then on humane probabilitie; the stabilitie of his Truth, which hath pro∣mised (as Paule also Rom. 11. expoundeth the former Prophets) the vnchangeable∣nesse of GODS Election, the bottomelesse Sea of his Mercies, the vnsearchablenesse of his Iudgements, minister hope beyond hope. Hereunto also may bee added the common grounds, both of Reason, which they hold with vs in Nature; and of Scripture, the auncienter parts whereof, and especially the Law of Mo∣ses, they maintaine with equall acknowledgement, and (for the most part) with more forward industrie and zeale, then doe the commoner sort of Chri∣stians. But the Impedimēts of the Iewes conuersion. impediments which haue hitherto, and doe yet with-hold them from Christianitie, doe exceede in number and power. For that fore-stalled preiu∣dice of theirs, the glorie of the Temple, the Sacrifices and Legall worships past, their hopes then and still of such a Monarch to their Messias, as you haue heard of, the splendour of their renowmed Auncestors, the keeping of the Diuine Oracles, their peculiar title of beeing GODS people, haue bredde in them such a swel∣ling pride, that they naturally enuie and abhorre the verie thought thereof, that the Gentiles should in these thinges either equall or succeede them. Sooner (sayth Martin Luth.in Mic.4.1,2. Luther) then they would endure, that the Gen∣tiles (which in their dayly prayers they curse and reuise) should haue any part with them in their Messias, and bee accounted co-heires thereof, they would crucifie tenne Messiahs: yea (if it were possible) would doe to death GOD
himselfe, with all the Angels and creatures else, although they should therefore vnder∣goe a thousand Hels. Hence, in a great part, proceedeth their naturall and long continued obstinacie. And besides that preiudice, pride, and enuie, they are not a little scandalized from the Christians themselues, somewhat in regard of the mutuall differences and disa∣greements among Protestants; which, though in it selfe bad, is made much worse by the vnseasonable and vnreasonable exaggeration of their common aduersarie, the Papist: but more, in respect of those which call themselues Catholikes, and are not, but euen by these men are found to be manifest Idolaters. Religion of the West parts A scandall it is to see GODS Law neglected, and mans exacted with rigour: a greater matter, at some times to eate flesh, then the adulterous pollution of the flesh at any time: the blasphemies of Nations; these being interiections to the vulgar, and phrases of gal∣lantrie to the Princes: the forging and packing of miracles; wherein the Friers and Iewes concurre with equall diligence, the one in contriuing, the other in discouering them. A scandall are the alterations which they are forced by the Inquisitors to make in their Authors and Monuments of Antiquitie: thinking, that these deuises are our best euidences. A scandale is the vowing and praying to Angels and Saints, yea, more to the Mother of CHRIST, then to CHRIST himselfe, or to GOD, to whome alone they repute this a due Sacrifice. But the greatest scandall of all others, is the worshipping of Images. Indeed it seemed strange to me, and doth to the rest of my brethren according to the flesh (Nathanael a Iew borne, baptised in London, before the Congregation at All-hallowes Apr.1577. made this confession) euen vnto this day, in whome this blindnesse and hardnesse of heart is in part continued, through occasion giuen by them that professe the name of IESVS: and not one∣ly in vs, which are of the house of Israel, but in others, as the Turkes and Mahume∣tanes, which are of the Race of Ishmael. Wee and our Fathers and Elders say, and in our Bookes call them by no other name, but Buale abodazara, Idolatrous Ma∣sters: a thing so detestable vnto vs, as nothing more, &c. They say vnto vs often∣times, that they doe not worship them as Gods, but GOD in them: Neither are the Heathen, we say, that are round about vs, so blinded, that they thinke the stockes and stones to be GOD, but they are persuaded that GOD may be worshipped in them. And yet they goe farther: for the Christians in Spaine and Portugall haue it written in their bookes, That the Virgine Marie is the LORDS Treasure, and that she be∣stowes gifts and graces vpon her seruants: That her mercie pardoneth them, whome the iustice of her Sonne might condemne, and that our Saluation lyeth in her hands. But our Law teacheth, That GOD is All-sufficient, he giueth to whome hee listeth, He will not giue his glorie to another, &c. The Reader may (if he please) from that Iew himselfe, in his printed Confession, be further informed of that Partition-wall which separateth the Iew and Catholike. They are so much the more scandalized, when they see the Catechismes recite the Decalogne, with omission of that second Commaundement, which they thinke (as one of their greatest Rabbines contested with our Rel.West. Author) was the Ordinance of CHRIST himselfe. Yea, the Priests and Friers let passe in their conferences with them for currant, their Iewish vpbraidings, That CHRIST, a Carpenters Sonne, was an Image-maker, or at least an Author of their worshipping. As for those specu∣latiue playsters of  and , of intention instrumentall and finall in worship, of Images of the true, and Idols of the false Gods, they are (as euen now you heard) the vnsauourest dregs to the Iew in the world. The poore Ideot, among the Christians, can as little distinguish as the Pagan, and both amongst the Christians is like honour done to GODS Image, and to that of Saints, and to them both, in like forme of worship, as amongst the Pagans. They are forced to be at some Sermons, and there are well edified by their hea∣ring, when they see the Preacher direct his prayer to a Crucifixe, calling it his Lord and Sauieur. Their Transubstantiation is a monster as hideous as the former.
The meanes Ibid vsed to their conuersion are weake; especially in some places, where they haue not the New Testament in such Language as they can vnder∣stand: and the Inquisitors haue inhibited and taken from them all bookes written on that Theame, in defence of Christian Religion, or against it, alledging, they will haue no disputing in matters of Religion either way, like the Iesuites Edict at Dola, forbidding all talke of GOD, either in good sort or in bad. But of all other this is a good furtherance, that when in their Baptisme they de∣nie the Deuill and all his workes, they must renounce their right and propertie in all their goods and possessions; the shamefull couetousnesse of hypocriticall Christians hauing brought these irritamenta malorum within the compasse of the Deuils workes: presupposing (forsooth) that either the conuerted Iew, or his corrupt auncestors, haue scraped together such heapes of wealth by Vsurie, or Oppression, or some vn∣lawfull meanes or other. Therefore for the good of his soule, his bodie shall be left to begge or starue; while, with the leauing of his Iewish Superstition, he must like∣wise leaue all that he hath: and his new-receiued Religion must be a meanes to strip him of his riches, and to weane him from his well-beloued Mammon, which that Nation is naturally so farre in loue with. This alone, to the world-bewitched Iew, is such a partition-wall to keepe him from Christianitie, that he will venture soule and all, rather then thus betray himselfe, his wife and children, to extreame beggerie and want. Especially since the fairest of his preferment (to welcome him to our Religion) is to turne Frier: then which profession, nothing can be more hatefull to him, who accounteth it a course against Nature; and a breach of that Ordinance of Gen.1.28. GOD, (Crescite & multiplicamini) of multiplying the world by a holy propagation in that Heb.13.4. honourable estate of Marriage, which that 1.Tim.4.1.4. doctrine of Deuils hath made the Frier vncapable of. As for the example of Elias, and some other holy men (whome our Popish Votaries would make Patrones of their disorderly Orders;) the Iew (herein more truly-Christian then the Papist) holdeth it a course extraordinarie, and ordina∣rily preferreth holy Marriage farre before that seeming-holy Vow of Virginitie. Thus wee see what outward scandales, besides their generall preiudice a∣gainst Christianitie, doe hinder them from it: which offences, in be∣halfe of the Christians, together with that preiudice, pride, and enuie, and aboue all, that Veile which diuine Iu∣stice hath left vpon their hearts, GOD in his good time remoue, and graunt, ac∣cording to that Prophecie, That all Israel may be saued.
OF THE ARABIANS, SARACENS, TVRKES, AND OF THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF ASIA MINOR, AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS. THE THIRD BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of ARABIA, and of the auncient Religions, Rites, and Customes thereof. ARABIA is a very large Region, Maginus. lying betweene two Bayes or Gulfes of the Sea, the Persian on the East, and that which hereof is called the Arabian, on the West: On the South is the Ocean; on the North is Syria and Euphrates. Plin.l.6.28. Orosius, l.1. Plinie sets downe the Northerne Limits, the Hill Amanus, ouer∣against Cilicia and Commagena; many Colonies of them being there planted by Tigranes the Great: it thence (sayth he) declineth to our Sea and the Aegyptian shore, and to the heart of Sy∣ria to Mount Libanus. By a certaine workman∣ship of Nature it much resembleth the forme and site of Italie. Solin.36. Arabia signifieth Holy. The Na∣tions in this wide Tract of Land are many. It is the next to be spoken of in this our Discourse, according to our Geographicall method, as confining vpon Iudaea, whence we last departed. Draudius in Solin. Beros.l.4. Some deriue the name from Arabus, the sonne of Apollo and Babylonia. And the forged Berosus of Annius telleth, That Ianus pater sent one Sabus into Arabia Foelix; Arabus into Arabia Deserta; and Petreius into Petraea, all nephewes of Cham; all indeed the sonnes of Annius his braine. True it is, that Arabia is com∣monly diuided into those three parts, Petraea, Deserta, and Foelix. Of the Nations in Arabia, Plinie writeth largely, amongst the rest naming the Saracens, of which wee are anon to speake at large. But long before Plinie, the Scripture speaketh of the people of this Region (not onely those which are said to descend of Cush, the sonne
of Cham, but of many others which descended of Abraham. as Ishmael the sonne of Abraham, by Hagar; and Gen.25.2. Zimran, and Iokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak and Shuah with their posteritie, the issue of Abraham by Keturah: who, after that Seba and Sabbetha, and Rama and Sabtheca had peopled some parts of Arabia, were sent away with their portions Eastward to the East Countrey, that is, into Arabia; where it is likely they mingled their Seed and Generations with those former of the posteritie of Cham: for therefore it seemeth Moses wife, Zipporah, was called a Num.12.1. Cushite, or (as some reade) an Aethiopian, not that shee was of the Countrey Aethiopia, but a Midianite of Arabia, of Abrahams race: which Coun∣trey, because the posteritie of Cush had first inhabited, and happily had mingled themselues in marriages with them, shee is called a Cushite, which some wrong∣ly expound an Aethiopian; although Cush were also the father of the Aethiopi∣ans. This posteritie of Abraham are, in Scripture, often called the children of the East. The name Foelix, or Happie, is giuen to the Southerly parts of Arabia, for the fertilitie thereof: Arias Mon∣tan. Caleb. the name Petraea to a second part, of Petra the Seat royall, after called Arach, of Aretas an Arabian King. The Desert Arabia hath a name answerable to the nature thereof; being, in great part, without inhabitants, for the barrennesse of the soyle: as is also a great part of that which is called Petraea. This Desert Arabia is also Maginus, Plotom.l.5. called Aspera, Inferior, Cua, and of the Hebrewes Cedar. It is bounded on the East with Baby∣lonia, and part of the Persian Gulfe; on the North with Mesopotamia, neere to Euphrates; on the West, with Syria and Arabia Petraea; on the South, are the Mountaines of Arabia Foelix. Neere to them and to Euphrates it hath some Townes, and is frequented with Merchants, otherwhere partly vnpeopled, partly (Strabo therefore tearmeth it Scenitae, vel Nymades, Scenitis) fedde with such I entorys. Roming Arabians, as haue no dwelling-houses, but remoue to and fro, seeking where to finde pasture for their Beasts, and lodge in Tents. Dauid accounteth himselfe Ps.120.5. miserable for this dwelling in the Tents of Kedar or (as Tremellius reades it) Tanquam Scenita Kedareni. as the Scenites of Kedar. Thus did the Patriarchs of old, thus did the Scythians, and thus doe the Tartars and the Arabians in Asia, Africa, and Europe, at this day, roming, rouing, robbing. They Boter. relat. part.1.l.2. which dwell in Townes and Cities, obseruing a more ciuill life, are cal∣led Moores, the other Arabians, in more proper appellation. The name Moores was giuen them of the Spaniards, because out of Mauritania they inuaded Spaine, and now Adrichem. Theat.T.S. is taken vsually, not so much for the inhabitants of the Arabian Cities, as for all of the Arabian and Mahumetane Superstition. Bosra is the chiefe Citie. Arabia Petraea adioyneth on the West and North to Syria; on the East to the Desert Arabia; on the South to the Happie. Plinïe, Strabo, and Ptolomey call it Nabathaea. Some thinke, of Nebaioth, sonne of Ishmael. Tyrius calls it Arabia Se∣cunda. Now it is called by Ruscelli, Baraab; or after Ziglerus, Barra; or Bathalatha, after Castaldus. Nigh to Syria it is more plentifull, then in other parts. The scarcitie of wood and water, with the barrennesse of the Soyle in other places, shew how it is ma∣ligned of the Elements. Both in this part, and the former, they had neede goe strong and well accompanied, for feare of Robberie and Spoyle, which the Arabi∣ans attend. This part is famous vnto all Generations, not so much for the Amalekites, Midianites, and other their bordering Neighbours (of whome and their Reli∣gion somewhat is spoken Lib.1.c.vlt. before) as R.Volaterran. for the miraculous passage of the Is∣raelites through the same, and abode therein fortie yeares, in which time they receiued the Law, were fedde with Mauna; their Meat, Drinke, Clothing, Iudge∣ments, Mercies, continually yeelding miraculous euidence of GODS presence a∣mongst them.
Bellonius visited the Mount Sinai: he Obser.l.2.c.co.& d. saith, it is a mile and a halse from Horeb, and farre higher: from whose top, (which is hard stone of iron colour) may both shores of the Red Sea be seene. Some say it is called Mare Erythraeum, or red, of Ery∣thraeus a King of that name. This Sea is not therefore called Red, because either the ground, or the sand or the water thereof is Red, as Bellonius hath obserued, for none of them are Of this see more.l.6.c.vlt. so. The people thereabouts take care for no other houses then the boughes of Palme-trees, to keep them from the heate of the fun (for raine they haue but seldome:) the cattell are lesse there then in Egypt. In the ascent of Mount Sinai are steps cut out in the Rocke: they began to ascend it at breake of day, and it was after noone before they could get to the Monasterie of Maronite-Christians, which is on the top thereof. There is also a Meschit there for the Arabians and Turkes, who resort thither on pilgri∣mage as well as the Christians. There is a church also on the top of Mount Horeb, and another monastery at the foote of the hill: besides other Monasteries, wherein liue reli∣gious people, called Caloieri, obseruing the Greek rites who shew all (& more then all) the places renouned in scriptures and antiquities to Pilgrims. They eat neither flesh nor white meates. They allow foode vnto strangers such as it is, rice, wheate, beanes, and such like, which they set on the floore without a cloth, in a woodden dish, & the people com∣pose themselues to eate the same, after the Arabian manner, (which is to fit vpon their heeles touching the ground with their toes, wheras the Turks fit crosse-legged like Tai∣lors.) Arabia Foelix Maginus. Dom. Niger.com. Asiae l.6. trendeth from hence Southwards, hauing on all other parts the Sea: against which it doth abut the space of 3000. fiue hundreth & foure miles. Virgil calls it Panchaea, now Adrich. saith it is now cal∣led Mamotta. Ayaman, or Giamen. It hath store of riuers, lakes, townes, cities, cattell fruits of many forts. The chiefe Cities are Medina, Mecca, Ziden, Zebit, Aden. There is store of siluer, gold, & varietie of gemmes. There are also wilde beasts of diuers kindes. As for the Phoenix, because I (and not I alone) thinke it a Fable, as neither agreeing to reason nor likelihood, and plainely disagreeing to the History of the Creation and of Noahs Arke, in both which GOD made all Male & Female, and commanded them to increase and multiply, I thinke it not vvorthy recitall. Ludomeus Vertomannus, or Barthema (as Ramusius nameth him) tels Eud.vertom.l.1.c.7. at large his iourney through all this threefold Arabia: he trauelled from Damasco to Mecca Anno 1503. with the Carauan of Pilgrims and Marchants, beeing often by the way set vpon by Armies of those theeuish and beggerly Arabians. This iourney is of for∣tie dayes trauell, trauelling two and twenty houres, and resting two for their re∣past. After many daies they came to a Mountaine inhabited with Iewes, tenne or twelue miles in circuite, which went naked, and were of small stature about fiue or sixe spannes high, blacke of colour, circumcised, speaking with a womanish voice. And if they get a Moore in their power, they flay him aliue. They saw there certaine white∣thornes, and in the same two Turtles, which seemed to them as a miracle: for in fif∣teene daies and nights they had neither seene birds nor beasts. They giue their Ca∣mels by the way not aboue fiue barly Loaues at a meale, as bigge as a Pomegranate, and drinke once in three daies. At the ende of eight daies they staid a day or two to rest them. Their pilote directed their iourney by the compasse (in Diodorus times, they obserued the North-starre) no lesse then if it had beene at Sea. They trauelled fiue daies and nights through the sandy Sea, which is a great plaine Champaine, full of a small white sand like meale: where if, by some disaster, the winde blowe from the South they are all dead men. And although they had the winde at North, yet could they not see one another aboue ten paces off. And such as ride on Camels are inclosed with wood, with holes to receiue the aire; the Pilots going before vvith their compasse for direction. Many died there for thirst, and many with fulnesse, drin∣king too much when once they came at water. When the North windes blowe, those sands are driuen to a heape. He supposed that Mummia was made of such as the sands had surprised and buried quicke: but the truer Iul.Scaliger. Exerc.104. Mummia is made of em∣balmed bodies of men, as they vse to doe in Egypt, and other places. As for the o∣ther parts of Arabia, they which list, may by this our author, by Pliny, Niger, and others, be informed further.
To come to the disposition of the people, they are small, naked, beggerly. What they haue done in Asia, Afrike, and Europe by force of Armes vnder the name of Saracens, and pretence of Religion shall follow in the next Chapter: VVhat they still doe, if they meete with purchase, Trauellers know to their cost. The practise of Marchandise amongst some of the Arabian people, and namely the Ismaelites, the Gen.37.28. Scripture recordeth. For their auncient Religion, it is not like it could bee good, when as they had so bad an Author of their stocke, accursed Cham: the sounes of Abraham vvere better instructed: but as they were borne after the flesh, and not according to promise, so if they and some of their posteritie did a while hold the truth, (as the Historie of Iob and his friends euinceth) yet this lasted not long: but soone after Psal.76.1.&147.20. in Iewrie was GOD knowne, and he dealt not so with any other Nation. Herodotus Herodot l3. (father of the Greeke Historie) affirmeth in his Thalia, that the Arabians worshipped Dionisius, whom they named Vrotalt; and Vrania, whom they called Alilat: these alone they e∣steemed Gods. They shaue their maidens like to Dionisius, in a round forme about the temples. Suidas telleth Suid.hist. that they were excellent Archers, their Arrowes were as long as themselues: their bowes they bent not with hands, but with feete. Curio Coelius Aug. Curio hist. Sar. l.1. in his Saracenicall Historie testifieth of them, that as they descended in great part of Abrahams race by Ishmael, the sonnes of Keturah, and by Esan: so they of olde had and still reteine many rites obserued by the Hebrewes: as numbring by Tribes, and marrying onely within their owne Tribe: euery Tribe also had their owne King. (which it seemeth the Tent wandring or Scenite-Arabians obserue still) That son succeedeth not which is eldest, but he which is borne first after hee is proclaimed King or Ruler, being of Noble race on both sides. They vsed also Circumcision. For their reli∣gion in olde times; some were Christians, of which (about the times of Mahomet) there were many sects: some were Iewes; others worshipped the Sunne and Moone: others, certaine Serpents; others, some kindes of Trees; and some a Tower called Alca∣ba, which they supposed Ismael had built; and some others, some other deities. Eusebius Euseb. de lau∣dib.Constant. tels that they vsed humane sacrifices, which not onely Sardus confirmeth, saying, that they sacrificed euery yeare a childe whom they buried vnder the Altar: but Sardusl 3. c 15. Nicephorus Niceph. hist. Ec.l.18.23. also reported of one Naaman a Scenite-Arabian, a chiefetaine amongst them, who in zeale of that superstition, killed men with his owne hands, and sacrificed them on the Altars to his gods. He in the time of Mauricius, warned by a vision, be∣came a Christian, and with him an innumerable company of his, whom he offered a li∣uing vnbloudy sacrifice in baptisme vnto CHRIST. When they entred league with any, their manner was, that one standing in the mids betweene both parties did wound the hand with a sharpe stone, in the palme neere to the thummes of them both, and taking flockes of the garments of them both, annoin∣ted, with that bloud, seuen stones set in the mids of them: Meane-while inuoking Dio∣nisius and Vrania: and then this Mediator becommeth surety for the party, who there∣by esteemeth himselfe bound to obserue it. And thus did Herod l.3. they make league with Cam∣byses. To these two Arabian Gods Great Alexander vvould haue added himselfe a third (saith Arrian.l.7. Arrianus, in his life.) He made great prouision to inuade them, both be∣cause they had sent him no Embassage, and for that they worshipped onely these two deities; Heauen, for that it containeth the Sun and Starres; and Dionisius, because hee had inuaded the Indians: and therefore aequalling this his owne expedition to that of Dionisius, he would also for robbing of men, be reckoned a God. Strabo Strabo l.15. saith, that in respect of the wealthinesse of this countrey, he had thought (had not death preuented him) to haue made Arabia the imperiall seate. He affirmeth also that Sesostris the Ae∣gyptian King, passing through Arabia, in that his renowmed expedition, erected there in diuers places Egyptian temples and superstitions: that the Troglodytae which dwelt in Caues, and bordering on the Aegyptians, by some reputed Arabians, were circumci∣sed, as the Arabians and Egyptians were. The Nabathaeans worship the Sunne, burning Frankincense on an Altar vnto him. They neglect the bodies of the dead, burying euen their Kings in a dunghill. Of the other Arabians hee reporteth that they vsed incestuous copulation vvith
sister and mother. Adulterie with them is death: but that onely is Adulterie, which is out of the same kindred, otherwise all of the same bloud to vse the woman is their (in∣cestuous) honesty. When fifteene brothers (Kings sonnes) had by their continuall com∣pany tired their one and onely Sister, shee deuised a meanes to rid her selfe, or at least to ease her somewhat of that trouble. And therefore whereas the custome was, that hee which went in, left his staffe at the doore to prohibite others entrance, shee got like slaues, and alway hauing one at the doore, was disburthened of their im∣portunitie; euery one that came, thinking some other had beene there before them. But they being once altogether, one of them stole from his fellowes, and finding this staffe at the doore, accused his Sister to his Father of Adulterie, where∣of by discouerie of the Truth shee was cleared. Linschoten Linschoten. History of the Indies. telleth of the like pra∣ctise obserued by the Nairos in Cochin, leauing their Armes at the doore, when they enter to their Nairo-kinswomen which they vse likewise in common, being ne∣uer married. Their Circumcision they obserued, as Draudius in Solin. some write, at the thirteenth yeare of their age, imitating Ismael herein. Euery one abideth in his Fathers profession. The possessions and wealth are common to the whole kindred. Alexander ab Alexandro nameth Dyasares an Arabian deitie. Their Priests he saith were attired in linnen gar∣ments, with Mitres and Sandals. Sol.Polyhist. Solinus affirmeth, that they abstaine from Swines flesh: neither will that sweet aire of Arabia breath life to that sordide & stinking crea∣ture. This is in the Happy Arabia, where happinesse maketh them vnhappy: their sweets Strab.l.16. breeding bitter effects in diseasing their bodies, which they are forced to cure with the sents of brimstone and Goates beards burnt. That which others admire and almost adore for rarenesse and excellencie, is here their common sewell for their fire: D. Sic.l.3. Vulcans deuouring iawes being fed with hearbs, shrubs, trees, gummes, spices, for humane and diuine vses most esteemed. Frankinsence (saith Plin.l.12.c.14. Plinie) groweth onely in Arabia, but not in euery place thereof. About the midst of the countrey is Sabota (the chiefe Citie of the Sabaeans) in a high mountaine: eight mansions from thence is the Region of Frankincense, which is called Sabba, that is, a mysterie: looking toward the East, euery way garded and made vnpassable with Rockes. The soile is reddish, inclining to vvhite. The length of the Fankinsence-wood, is twentie sehoeni, the bredth halfe as much. (a schoenus in this account is fiue miles) Other Arabians besides (these and the Minaei) see not this tree, nor all of these, but onely some three hundred Families, vnto whom the right of these rites deuolueth by succession. Therefore are they called sacri, Holy, neither may they in the time, when they cut them, be polluted with knowledge of women or with Funerals. What manner of tree it is, Plinie saith hee knew not, nor any Romane to his knowledge. They gathered it in the spring and autumne: they cut the trees from whence it sweateth. There needes no watch to keepe them, but the innocencie of the inhabitants. When Alexander in his Youth bestowed large store of Frankincense in his deuotions, Leonides his Mr. told him, he should so doe when he had conquered the countrey where it grew: He after enioying (some part of) Arabia, sent him a ship laden with Frankinsence, and bad him serue the Gods plentifully. The Frankin∣cense, when it is gathered, is carried on Camels to Sabota by one way, out of which to goe were capitall. There they pay the tithes to a God which they call Sabis. The Priests take it by measure, not by weight. Certaine portions are allowed to them and to the Kings scribes. Plantus therefore Pl.in Poenulo & in Milite. cals Frankincense Odor Arabicus. Virgil cals it Panchaean, & Sabaean Frankincense. The manifold rites which the Heathens vsed in their holy things with this drugge, Stuckins Stuckins de sacris. sheweth at large. Here also grew the Mirth in the same woods, and among the Trogloditae. But this and Cinamon and other things which grew elsewhere as well as here, neede not much discourse. They vsed yet some religion in gathering of their Cinamon, as Ioan.Boemus. some obserue, sacrificing before they began, and after diuiding what they had gathered, with a sacred speare assigning a portion to the Sun: if the diuision be iustly made, the Sun sealeth his consent by fire, with his beames consuming the same. Thus much of their spices, and holy drugges.
Of their other riches I meane not to speake, saue of their sheepe with great tailes, some of which weigh forty pound. Leo.Africa∣nus. Leo saith he saw one at Cairo, whose taile, supported by a Cart with wheeles (for else shee could not haue carried it) weighed fourescore pound, and heard of such as weighed a hundred and thirtie pound. Gal.1.17. Paul presently after his conuersion preached the Gospell in Arabia. Panchaea and an other Iland, called Sacra, are adioined by Diod.Sic. l.6. c. 10. Diodorus to Arabia, both fertile (as he saith) of Frankinsence. In Panchaea is the Citie Panara, whose inhabitants are called the Ministers of Iupiter Triphylius, whose Temple is thence distant threescore furlongs, admirable for the Antiquitie, magnificence & nature of the place: it is two hun∣dred foote long, the bredth answerable, hauing in it large Statues, and about it the houses of the Priests. Many Fountaines there springing make a nauigable streame, cal∣led the water of the Sunne, which is medicinable to the bodie. The countrey about, for the space of two hundred surlongs, is consecrated to the Gods, and the reuenue there∣of spent in sacrifices. Beyond is a high mountaine, called the seate of Heauen, and O∣lympus Triphylins: where Coelus is said to haue instituted the rites there yeerely obser∣ved. The Priests rule all in Panchaea both in ciuill and religious cases: and liue very deliciously, attired with linnen stoales and mitres, and parti-coloured sandals. These spend their time in singing hymnes, and recounting the acts of their gods. They deriue their generation from the Cretan Iupiter. Eadem ferè Euseb.de praepa∣rat.Eu l,2. They may not goe out of their sacred limits assigned them, if they doe, it is lawfull to kill them. The Temple is enriched with gifts and offerings. The doores excell for matter and workmanship. The bed of the God is sixe cubites long, and foure broad, all of golde faire wrought. The Table stands by, no∣thing inferiour. In the mids is another bed of golde, very large, grauen with Aegyp∣tian Letters; in which are contained the gefts of Iupiter, Coelus, Diana and Apollo, written by Mercury. Thus farre Diodorus. Iustine Iustin.bift. l.39. mentioneth Hierotimus an Arabian King, which had sixe hundred children by Concubines. Some Gramay As Arab. are of opinion that the Wisemen which by the auncient conduct of a Starre came to Ierusalem, (the first fruits of the Gentiles) came out of Arabia. Scaliger Ios. Scal.Can. I sag.l.2. mentioneth a conquest aunciently made and holden by the Arabians in Chaldaea. Philostratus Philost. de vi∣ta Ap.l.1. saith, the Arabians are skilfull in au∣guries, or diuinations, because they eate of the head and heart of a Dragon. That they eate Serpents, Solinus affirmeth. Atheneus Athaeneus l.6.c.6. saith that the Arabians vsed to maime them∣selues, if their King hapned to be maimed, and that in the same member: and in Ath.l.12.c.4. ano∣ther place he citeth out of Heraclides Cumaens, the delicacies of this Arabian King, and his quiet or idle course of life, committing matters of iudgement to officers: and if any thinke himselfe wronged by them, he puls a chaine fastened to a window in the high∣est part of the Pallace: Wherevpon the King takes the matter into his hand, and whe∣ther part he findes guiltie dies for it. Plutarch de Inuid. & odio. His expences were fifteene Babylonian talents a day. The Arabians kill Mice, as a creature supposed enemie to the gods, a custome common to them with the Persians and Aethiopians. The Tertullian de veland.Virg. women couer their faces, contented to see with one eye, rather then to prostitute the whole face. They kill not Vipers, but scarre them away with Clappers from their balsame-trees saith, Pansania Baeotica. Pansanias, when they gather that commoditie, because they thinke them consecrated to those balsame-Trees, vnder which they liue and feede of that liquor, with which also they cure themselues if they are bitten by them. The Arabian tongue is now the common language of the East, especially among such as embrace the Mahumetan religion: this language in the first diuision of tongues, according to Epiph.contra Sethian. Epiphanius, was begunne in Armot, the first speaker and Author thereof.
CHAP. II. Of the Saracene Name, Nation, and proceeding in Armes. PLINY lib. 6. cap. 28. mentioneth among other Arabian Nations the Saracens: placing them neere to the Nabathaeans. Ptolomey Geograph. lib.6.c.7. likewise nameth the Scenites so called of their tents, which with themselues, their flockes, and substance they remoued vp and downe from place to place. Posteritie hath called all these Tent-wanderers (saith Scenitas Ara∣bas quos Sarace∣nos nunc appel∣lamus.A.M.l.22 Scaliger out of Ammianus Marcellinus) Sarracenes: and so doth Ptolomey in the next words call the next adioining people, seating them in the Northerly bounds of Arabia Foelix. In the same Chapter he setteth downe Saraca, the name of an Ara∣bian. Epiphanius lib. 1. saith that the Tribes of the Agarens or Ismaelites, are now called Saracens. Boterus. Curio.alij. Some later Authors haue written, that because Ishmael was the sonne of Hae∣gar a bond-woman, his nicer posteritie haue disclaimed that descent, and deriued their pedegree and name from Sara. Iosephus Scaliger, in his Annotations vpon Euse∣bius Chronicle, after that he hath cited the former testimonie of Ammianus, and of Ou∣kelos on the 37. of Genesis, addeth the authoritie of Stephanus; who affirmeth Sara∣ka to be a region of Arabia, neere the Nabathaeans, of which hee thinketh that the Saracens borrowed their name. We know (saith Scaliger) that the Arabian Nomades are so called: for Sarak in Arabian soundeth as much, that is (furaces  ) thee∣uish or robbers, such as the Cosakes, Tartars, &c. De Sara, perridiculum: To call them Saracens of Sara is ridiculous; for then either they must be called Saraei, or she Sa∣raca. Am.Mar.l.14 Marcellinus thus writeth of them; This people stretcheth from the Assyrians to the falles of Nilus: all warriours, halfe naked, in couloured iackes. None plow∣eth or planteth, but they wander vp and downe without houses or lawes; their life being alwaies in flight. Their wiues they hire and Couenant with for a time: which breede childe in one place, and bring forth in another, and neuer rest. Their foode is Venison, Milke, Hearbes, and such foules as they can take: the most, that wee haue seene, know not the vse of Wheate or Wine. Like Kites they snatch their prey, but stay nor by it, whether they winne or loose. They are such, as the Romans neede neuer wish them their friendes or their enemies. In the time of Iulian Lib.25. they made out-rodes and spoiles on the Romane prouinces, because they were denyed their wonted stipends by Iulian, who told them that he had better store of Iron then golde. This name Saracene may well befit that course of life which they embraced: for in the more Southerly parts of Arabia, they are more ciuill and rich, dwelling in Cities, and haue quicke trade, which all are wanting about Medina and Mecca, places so renowned by the life and death of Mahomet. Neither doth it seeme probable that those which were called Agarenes in the continued succession of so many ages, as appeareth 1. Chron. 5. 10. and Psal. 83.6. would after grow ashamed of that: or that Ishmael, which derided the hopes concerned of Isaac the sonne of Sara, would nourish his posteritie in the same hope, or leaue to them any honourable memorie of Sara, vvho had reiected him together vvith his mother. Yea, and their owne superstitious Legend proueth the contrarie, as shall appeare in the next Chap∣ter. This robbing and rogueing people liued in much obscuritie, vntill that dark∣nesse brought them to light, and a Religion newly stamped by Mahomet, in a secret and iust iudgement of GOD, for the contempt of the trueth, vvas by as new a kinde of preaching (viz. force of Armes) obtruded on the luke-warme vvorld. For vvhen as Mahomet, (of vvhose life solloweth a large discourse) had obserued that sicke state of the Empire affected vvith Iewish rebellion,
Persian inuasion, and Nestorian infection, besides the securitie of the Head it selfe, Heraclius then Emperour: hee thought good to take Occasion by the fore∣locke, and to strike whiles the iron was hote. First, Saracen.hist. Curio.l.1 Dreshleri.chron. Boter. Phyg Chron. Car.Chron. Sabel. Aen.8.l.7. Volaterran l.12 Chron.Arab. Politie of the Turkish Em∣pire, &c. vnder pretence of Religion ha∣uing inueagled a multitude of Disciples, hee made a commotion in Arabia: and being therefore driuen out of Mecca, many of his followers resorted to him: Of whom he appointed Captaines and leaders of the rest, Vbequar, Omar, Ozmen, A∣lifre, Talaus, Azubeirus, Zadimus, Zaedinus & Abuobeid. The Arabians (as some af∣firme) aided Heraclius in his warre against Cosdroes the Persian: and after that warre ended, the Arabians complaining for want of pay, the Treasurer answered that there was scarce sufficient for the Greeke and Romane souldiors, much lesse for that compa∣ny of dogges. Wherevpon, as long before on like occasion they had rebelled in the reigne of Iulian, so now enraged they departed into Syria, and adioined themselues vnto Mahumet, who euen then after the Persian victory had obtained (some say) of the Emperour whom he serued in those warres, to himselfe and his followers, a Region to inhabite; the Emperour so rewarding his exploites in the late warres. Mahumet with this supply assailed Mecca, which diuers times before he had in vaine attempted, and tooke it, with other peeces in Arabia, viz. Hunaim, Ietrip, Tambic, &c. He afterwards created foure Generals, whom he called the foure sharpe swords of GOD, and com∣manded them to goe into the foure parts of the world, and kill all such as would not embrace his Lawe. These foure were Ebubezer, The Arabian nam s in other languages are translated iuersly. or Vbequar, Omer, Osmen, and Ali. Ebubezer went into Palestina, but was ouerthrowne by Theodorus Begarius, Caesars Lieuetenant. About the same time died Mahumet, and this Abu-becher. Ebubezer succeeded him; although Mahumet had designed Ali his successor. Eubocara or Abubacher (for diuersly is this Ebubezer called) hauing by his might, and the assistance of Homar and Osmen, obtained to be Califa, or Amira was the name of the chiefe place or soueraintie in cases spirituall and temporall: the successor of Mahomet. Califa, ouerthrew the imperials, and soone after died. Ho∣mar the next Califa wanne Bosra the chiefe Citie of Arabia, and all the country as far as Gabata, and put Theodorus, the Emperors brother, to flight. He besieged Damascus, and hauing broken the forces that came to rescue it, obtained it: subduing also all Phoenicia. After that, turning his forces into Aegypt, Cyrus the Bishop of Alexandria stayed him with promise of 200000. peeces of golde, for yeerely Tribute. This vvas disannulled by Heraclius, and Emanuel the deputy denied the paiment: wherevpon en∣tring the second time vnder conduct of Hamrus, Aegypt was conquered. After two yeares siege, Ierusalem also was wonne. Iaidus one of his Captaines subdued Edessa, and all Mesopotamia. Afterwards placing Muauias ouer all the countries betweene Euphrates and Nilus, hee inuaded Persia: where the Persians lost both their King Hormisda, their state, religion, & name: of Persians being conuerted into Saracens. This victorious Homar made Ierusalem his royall seate, where he built a Temple to Mahu∣met: and while he was praying, was murthered by his seruant. Ozmen, Othman 4. the succeeding Caliph, sent a great Armie into Africa, vnder the leading of Hucba: who ouercomming Gregorious Patritius and destroying Carthage, subiected all that Prouince to their Empire; making Tunes the Mother-citie: but soone after translated that honour to Cairoan, which he būilt thirty sixe miles from the Sea, and a hundred from Tunnes. In the third yeare of his reigne Muauias the Deputy of Egypt with a Nauy of seuen hundred, or, as others say, of a hundred and seuenty saile, assailed Cyprus, and taking Constantia, wasted the whole Iland: and hauing wintered his Ar∣mie at Damascus, the next yeare besieged Arad in Cyprus and wonne it, and dispeopled all the Ile. Thence he inuaded the continent of Asia, and carried away many prisoners: and after, in a Sea-fight with Constans the Emperor, died the Lycian Sea with Christian bloud. He wanne Rhodes, and sold to a Iewe the brazen Colosse or pillar of the Sunne, which laded nine hundred Camels, sometime reckoned one of the worlds seuen won∣ders, made in twelue yeares space by Chares. After this he afflicted the Cyclades Ilands in the Archipelago, and then sent his Fleete against Sicilia, where they made spoile with fire and sword, till by Olympius they were chased thence. Muauias himselfe with an Armie by land entred into Cappadocia: Iaid hauing ouer-runne all the neighboring Ar∣menia, vnto the hill Caucasus. But meane while Ozmen, besieged in his house by
Ali his faction, slew himselfe, when he had liued eightie and seuen yeares, and reig∣ned twelue. The Saracens could not agree about their new Prince; Muavi and Hali.5. Ali with great armies, beeing Corriuals of that dignitie: and Ali, being treacherously murdered by Muavius meanes, in a Temple neare Cusa a citie of Arabia, was there buried, and the place is of him called Massadalle or Alli his house. Hasen ben Ali. Alhacem, the sonne of Ali and Fatima Mahumeta daughter, was by Muavia his owne hands crow∣ned, Some say he resigned, and he with Muaui are reckoned but the sixth Caliph of the Arabians. and by him soone after poysoned. Thus was Muavi sole Caliph, who graun∣ted peace to the Emperour, on condition that hee should pay him euerie dair This daily tribute was both ceased & inuerted soone after, when Abdimelech made peace with the Em∣perour, with promise to pay him the like tribute. P.Diacon. tenne pounds of golde; and a Gentleman seruant with a horse. Damascus was now made the seate Royall. Hee subdewed the sect of Ali in Persia, and after inuaded Cilicia, and sent (to aide Sapores) a band of Saracens, which afflicted Chalcedon, and sac∣ked Armaria a citie of Phrygia; and with a fleet inuaded Sicill, tooke Siracuse, and carried away with them the riches of Sicilia, and of Rome it selfe, lately fleeced by the Emperour, and heere horded. An other armie of Saracens, ouer-running the Sea coast of Africa led away eight hundred thousand prisoners. Muamad and Caise on the other side subdewed to Muaui, Lydia, and Cilicia; About these times another false prophet called Muctar, obtained Persia, and the A∣rabians were troubled. P. Diacon.in Iustin: and after, with Savus an other Saracen Generall, besieged Constantinople, from Aprill to September: and taking Cizicum, there wintred their forces, and in the Spring, re∣turned to their siege, which they continued seuen yeeres; but by diuine assistance, and force of tempest, they were chased thence. And Constantiue slew three hundred thousand Saracens, in a battell (not long after) against Susra the nephew of Muavi. and compelled the Saracens to pay a great tribute. Anno 679. Iezid reigned after the death of Muavi his father, (a better Poet then Souldier) he soone died. Neither did his suc∣cessors Marvan and Abdalan liue two yeares in the roome. Abdimelec sonne of Mar∣uan. Scal.9. & P.Diacon. in lu∣stiniano. Abdimelec was chosen Caliph, who descended from Hali, when as Abdalan of the Image of Eubocara (the Arabians call this the Maraunian race; the other Abazian) had possessed himselfe of that Title by force, whome Ciafa the kinsman of Abdimelec ouer̄threw. Ciasa af∣ter this victory entring Damascus, plucked Iazid (one of the former Caliphs) out of his graue, burned his bones, and hurled the ashes into the riuer, and cruelly persecuted all the Maraunian stocke. Hereupon Others call him AbdulMu. men. Abedramon one of that house with a great number of his friends and followers fled into Mauritania Tingitana, where he was welcomed of the Saracens there being, and first intitled himselfe Miralmumim, which signifieth The Prince of Beleeuers, and then builded Leo writeth otherwise, as in our 6. Booke shall appeere: hee saith Ma∣rocco was built in the 424 yere of their Hegira. Marocco. Abdimelec hauing other yrons in the fire, neglected this: First appeasing tumults in his owne state; then ouerthrowing the Emperour in the field: after receiuing (by treason of the Deputy) Armenia; winning that part of Persia, which yet was subiect to the Romans, and by his forces spoyling Thracia, whiles the Greekes were diuided amongst themselues. He also chased the Roman garrisons out of the coast-townes which they held in Afrike. Abdimelec be∣ing dead, Called of Leo, Qualid, & of Scal.Walid.110. Vbitus the sonne of Abedramon sncceeded, vnder whome the Saracens, besides the spoile of Galatia, conquered all Afrike betwixt Niger and the Sea, a little peece excepted at the mouth of the Straits subiect to Rodericus the King of Spaine: Mucas was made Lieutenant of the Saracen Empire in Afrike. To him Iulianus Earle of Cepta, full of indignation against his Prince, for deflouring his faire daughter Caba, about the yeare seuen hundred and twelue, offereth the conquest of Spaine, if hee would furnish him with some competent forces of his Saracens. This traitour, thus strengthened with the authority of his place (being Gouernour of the Ile Viridis and diuers places in Africa and Spaine) backed with his friends, and aided with the Saracens, ouerthrew the Gottish Empire, which had now ruled Spaine about three hundred yeeres: Rodericus loosing the field and his state, and spending the remnant of his daies with an Hermite in a solitarie desart of Lusitania. Iulianus himselfe was af∣ter slaine by the Saracens, as were the Spanish Traytours; the iust end of vniust trea∣cherie. Zulciminius the next Anno 717. Suleiman. Caliph sent Malsamas with a great power into Thrace, where hauing spoiled the Countrey, he laid siege to Curio. lib.2. Constantinople; Zulciminius
his maister assaulting it by Sea, with a nauy of three thousand shippes, in which siege he died, Anno Domini seuen hundred and nineteene. Aumar. Wolfgang. Dreschler. Chro.Omar. his successour, had no successe in this attempt, partly, through the violence of frost, causing famine and diseases in his campe, and partly, by the force of an artificiall Glasse, where with Leo the Emperour cast fire amongst the enemies fleete, and fiering euen the Seas about the shippes: that by this subtilty and force of tempest, of three thousand saile, fiue shippes onely are said to haue escaped. Iezid. Gizid, sent with supply of three hundred and three score shippes, durst not approach for feare of this fire: and the Saracens by their Caliph were reuoked, when the plague had slaine in Constantinople three hundred thousand people. When Aumar was dead, Gizid was chosen in his place; and after him Hascham sonne of Abdelmelech: who being murthered, Walid, or Euelit sonne of Iezid; in whose time the bottome of the Sea, neere the coasts of Asia minor, burned, and sent foorth smoke first, and after, heapes of stones, with which the shores of Asia, Lesbos, and Macedonia, were filled, and a new Iland P.Diac.Leo. tooke beginning of the heaping to∣gether of earth, which was annexed to the Iland called Sacra. The Saracens in Spaine erected amongst themselues many petite kingdomes, and by their diuisions made way to Pelagius, with some remainder of the Spaniards to re∣couer some of their lost countrey, who dying in the yeare seuen hundred thirtie and two, his sonne Fafila succeeded, in whose time the Saracens passed the Pyrenaean hills into France, where Theodoricus the second was then King, but Paul.Aemil.libr.2. Charles Martell ma∣ster of the Kings house ruled, as did his father in that office before, and his sonne, (both Pipins) after him. The Saracens tooke Narbone, and after Burdeaux, killing in it, man, woman, and childe, and rasing the Temples to the ground; they passed Garunna, and ouerturned Angolesme and Bloys, and came into Toures. Turon, where Eudo the Goth then King of a great part of France, in warres with Martell, for feare of the common ene∣mie, entred league, and with their ioynt forces slew three hundred and seuentie fiue thousand Saracens; and those of Nauarre slew the rest that escaped, in their returne. But when Eudo was dead, Martell tooke part of his kingdome from his sonnes Hunol∣dus, and Vaifarus, who thereupon recalled the Saracens, which vnder the leading of Atinus tooke Auenion by the treason of Mauricius then Gouernour, from whence, and out of France they were driuen Annis 735. & 737. & 738. by Martellus. The Saracens made foure inuasions into Thrace while Euelitus was Caliph, to whome succeeded Anno 74 Iezid. Gizit the third, who wasted Cyprus, and carried a∣way the people into Syria. After him and Hisan. Ices, (which two ruled not two yeares) Marvan reigned; and after, another of the same name, and the Saracens were diui∣ded. Tebid Dadac, and Zulciminius, challenged each to himselfe the soueraignety: and when all these were ouerthrowne and slaine, Asmulinus amongst the Persians rai∣sed vp the seruants to murther their maisters, and with them he ouerthrew Iblinus with one hundred thousand Saracens; and after, Marvan himselfe with three hun∣dred thousand, who fleeing into Aegypt, was there also vanquished and slaine in a Temple. This murther grew through the faction of the Abasian stocke, who conspired a∣gainst him, because he had slaine one of their kinred. Abulabas the chiefe of this con∣spiracie succeeded him, in the Ios Scal Can. Is.lib.2.& lib.3. yeare 749, and remoued the Chaliphate to that fa∣mily from the Maraunians, in the yeare of their Hegeira, 132 after the Arabian com∣putation; as we follow Scaliger herein; and he the Chronicle which Abraham Zacu∣thi gathered out of the Monuments of the Ismaelites. In the former relations, we haue principally followed Curio his Saracenicall history: though by the way we haue bor∣rowed of others also. This Abulabas being dead, Abugephar Elmantzar Ann Dom. 753. Heg.136. succeeded. Hee imprisoned the twelue sonnes of Hasin the sonne of Ali, where they perished; Hee beganne first to build the City of Bagded: he died An.Dom. 774 inthe 158 yeare. Iohn di Barros As.dec.1. lib.1 ascribeth this City to the Bugafar also, for so hee calleth him; but Curio to one Muamat long af∣ter. Scaliger Animad.in Euseb. chron. Lydyat em. tem. thinketh this to be Seleucia, a City built nigh vnto Babylon by Se∣leucus,
neare the meeting & mixing of Euphrates and Tigris; of which see our Baby∣lonian historie. Mahdi his sonne succeeded 781. 786. 808. 813. anno He. 165. after him Abarm Erreschid, Anno He. 170: and in the yeare 193. Irvin the sonne of Reschid, slaine by the faction of his brother Mamon 198. This Mamon was studious of learning and learned men: Hee made Ali King of Chorasan, and made a Lawe, That the posteritie of Ali should be cloathed in yellow silke. In his time many Bookes were turned out of Greeke in∣to Arabian; hee died in the yeare 832. Anno Dom.841. 861. 218. Mutetzam followed: and after him in the yeare 226 of the Hegira Aharan Elwathak: and next to him Methucal, who was slaine in the yeare 247 by a Turke. Muthnatzar his sonne and succeslour died in the yeare after, whom Elmustein followed; vnder him the Turkenien set vp Ach∣mad sonne of Tolon seruant of Mamon King of Aegypt and Syria, and slew the Cha∣lipha anno H. 255. anno Domini 868. After this time was the Caliphate or Popedome diuided, one sitting at Bagded, an other in Aegypt. The Aegyptian Chaliphs in our Egyptian History are expres∣sed in their due place and order. In Bagded succeeded Muhtadi. And the next yeare Mutemad, who died 892. 900. 907. 931. anno He. 279. Mutetzad his successour died 288. Muchtaphi, who slew Aharan the last of Tolons family that reigned in Aegypt, died 295. Mutetdan held the place till the yeare three hundred and twenty. The next was Elkahar, to whome succeeded in the next yeare, Ratze, and after him Muktaphe his brother, who made Toson a Turke his chiefe Captaine; of whome afterwards hee was blinded. Mustekaphe succeeded 943. anno H. three hundred fortie and two. In his dayes the family of Bawia ruled, whose sonne Meaz Eddula slew the Chaliph. Their Father had dreamed, that as hee pissed, fire ascended from his yard vp to Heauen: which the Diuiners tolde him, fignified the ensuing greatnes of his sonnes. Hee placed Matia in the Chaliphate, but ruled all things himselfe. Vnto Matia suc∣ceeded Taia, in his time Meaz Ledin Iilah was made K. of Mecca, Medina, Aliman; Egypt hee obtained before. Etzad Eddula sonne of Meaz repaired Bagded, now much decayed, and gaue his daughter in marriage to the Chalipha. This 981. 990. Etzad Ed∣dula died anno Hegirae 371. to whom Tzautzam Eddula succeeded, imprisoned by Beha Eddula, as was also Thia the Chaliph, and his house spoyled anno Hegoriae 353. Sultan Eddula Segia reigned after this Beha, and Kadar was Chalipha after Tasa. Sche∣raph Eddula raigned anno Hegirae 411. Kaim succeeded in the Papacie anno Hegirae 1020. 422. and fiue yeares after Muktadi. The 1031. Sultan being dead, and leauing a fonne of three yeares olde; his wife, the Babes mother, purchased the Sultanship of the Chali∣pha with a great summe of money. About this time flourished Ben Gazela, which made many Bookes of Physicke. Mustetaher was next Chalipha. In his time the Astrologers foretolde an exceeding 1095. deluge, not so great as in the dayes of Noah, because then (said they) were seuen Planets in Coniunction with Pisces, whereas now there were but sixe, Saturne be∣ing excluded. This made the Inhabitants of Bagded afrayd, because of the lowe si∣tuation: and caused them to stoppe the passages of the waters. The Ismaelites which of deuotion perfourmed their Pilgrimage, were most of them drowned. The Cha∣lipha for this cause arayed the Astrologer, which foretolde this, in royall apparell. Hee died 1118. anno Hegirae 512. Musteraschad succeeded, then Raschid, and in the 1135. yeare 530. Muktaphi. In his time were terrible Earthquakes, which made hauocke of all about Damasco, Aleppo, Tripolis, Antiochia, and Laodicea. Tigris ouerflo∣wed 1.60. Bagded, and desolated many other Citties. In anno Hegirae 555. succeeded Musteneged, who by his Physicians policie was strangled in the Bath, by the vio∣lence 1170. of the heate, the doore being shut. His sonne Mustetzi enioyed the roome 566. In his time the Abasian Caliphaes were receiued in Egypt, which the Pheti∣means of Ali his posteritie had before separated. Natzar succeeded 1179. 1225. anno Hegirae 575. and Taher his sonne 621. Next Mestenat∣zar
which gaue much Almes, and built many Schooles. In his dayes arose in Asia, one Baba, which professed himselfe a Prophet sent of God; who gathered an armie of the scumme of all Nations, whereby he filled Asia with bloud and slaugh∣ter, both of Christians and Israelites, vntill Glatheddin King of Gunia destroyed him. In the yeare 640, of CHRIST one thousand two hundred forty and two, suc∣ceeded Musteatzem, the foure and fiftieth Saracenicall Chalipha. The Tartar King Chita made his brother Halacho King of Irak and Mesopotamia, who besie∣ged and sacked Bagded, and slew Musteatzem. This Chalipha was starued by his commaundement in the middest of his treasures, because hee would not employ the same (through niggardise) for his owne defence. From that time there hath beene no Chaliph (saith this Arabian History) in Bagded. In him ended the Abasian line, of which had beene fiue and thirty Chaliphaes. After Mahumet or Muhammed the false prophet, the first Captaines of warre were called Emirelmumenim, that is to say, Praefecti orthodoxorum, the Captaines of the Sound-Beleeuers: and after, because, vnder cloake of Religion, they seised on the Primacie and tyranny (spirituall and temporall) they named themselues Chali∣phaes, that is, Vicars. The first Emirelmumenim was Abubecher. When by his suc∣cessors, Gouernours Such were the gouernors of Chorasan, I∣rak, Siras, Da∣masco. Ien, Mutzul, Halep, Gunia, Maha∣an: The Ara∣bian calleth them Kings: & their heirs suc∣ceeded them. were sent into Spaine and Africa, they for a time held the same as Deputies, although to their power nothing lacked but the title of a King, yet they professed to doe all in the name of the Emirelmumenim vntill afterwardes they tooke that Title also themselues, and became absolute. Whence all the pettite Kings of Spaine, and the African Potentates, were called Emire elmumenim; and the Kings of Barbary are so stilled at this day, euen as the French King is called Chri∣stianissimus, and the Spaniard Catholicus. The Legates of the Chalipha were cal∣led Naibin, which also signifieth the same that Chalipha; but this was made pecu∣liar to those Saracen Tyrants, which vsed both Swords, (to speake in the Roman language) supreame in matters Diuine and Humane. Thus obserueth Ioseph Sca∣liger Can. Isag.l.3. of these names: whereby it appeareth, that Emire elmumenim was not giuen onely to Abedramon and his successours in Africa, as is before obserued out of Curio. Thus haue wee giuen you a Chronographicall view of the auncient Chaliphaes, with their first and greatest Conquests, omitting the lesser and later; as in the yeare 807. in Sardinia and Corsica: in 826. in Creete: 843. in Sicill; and presently af∣ter in Lud.Reg.lib.8 Italy, ouerrunning Tuscan, and burning the suburbs of Rome it selfe, with the Churches of Peter and Paul 845. the next yeare in Illyria, Dalmatia; besides the taking of Ancona: in 847. chased by Pope Plat.m vita Pont. Leo from Ostia. These with other their affaires of warre, in Lucania, Calabria, Apulia, at Beneuentum, Genua, Ca∣pua, (which Cities they tooke) I passe ouer. After this great body grew lubberly and vnweldy, it fell vnder the weight of it selfe, none so much as the Saracens ouer∣throwing the Saracens, as their Cairaoan became a Pa∣pacie absolute, though schismatical as they called it: so did Marocco: the Persians were always pone to such schismes: and others, as it serued for their aduan∣tage. Sects and Diuisions make plaine. Neuerthelesse; this dis-joyning and disjoynting notwithstanding, their Religion euen still coue∣reth a great part of the World. For besides the triumphing sword of the Turke, Per∣sian, Mogore, Barbarian, and other Mahumetan Princes: such is the zeale of the superstitious Mahumetane, that in places furthest distant, this their Religion hath beene preached, which they trade together with their marchandise, euen from the Atlantike Ocean vnto the Philippinaes: It hath founded in China, it hath pierced Tartaria: and although the name of Christian extendeth it selfe into so many Sects and Professions in the Countries of Asia, Africke, and America, besides Europe (almost wholly Christian;) yet is it hard to say, whether there be not as many Dis∣ciples and Professours of this ridiculous and impious deuotion, as of all those which giue their names to CHRIST, in whatsoeuer truth or heresie. Thus hath the Field and the Church stouped to Mahumet: wee may adde more, (Saul among the Prophets:) Learning hath flourished amongst the Mahumetans, at
first so vnlearned and rude. Lud.Reg. Avicen, Averrois, Avempace, Algazel, &c. Philoso∣phers; Mesve, Rasis, and many other Physicians and Astrologers, mentioned in the Chronicles of Zacuthe; Leo, and Abilfadis Ismael. Geographers; Cairaoan, Bagded; Fez, Marocco, Corduba, &c. were Vniuersities of Saracen-students. But now Lear∣ning and Schooles are decayed and ruined: euen as at first also it was amongst them little countenanced, as appeareth by that Hagag in the 96. yeare of the Hegira, 714. who beeing Gouernour of King of Whereof Tau∣ris is chiefe ci∣ty: M. Poln lib.1.ca.9 cal∣leth it Hirach. Magin Media maior. Irak, in his sickenesse consulted with an Astro∣loger, Whether the Starres had tolde him of any Kings death that yeare: hee aun∣swered, That a King should die, but his name was Cani: Whereupon Hagag, re∣membering that at his birth his Mother had imposed that name on him: I shall die, saith he; but thou shalt goe one houre before: and presently caused his head to bee smitten off. An vnhappy Harbengership in reward of his Arte: an vnhappy Arte which can better tell others Destinies then their owne. But no maruell in Hagag, who was fleshed in bloud, that his Herodian Testament should be thus bloudy, who in his life had in that Median Prouince slaine a hundred and twenty thousand men, besides fiftie thousand men, and foure score thousand women, which perished in his imprisonments. CHAP. III. The life of Mahumet the Saracen Law-giuer. THe life of Mahumet is at large described by diuerse Authors, but no where so fully as before the Alcaron in the Italian Edition, the summe whereof, and of the other reports touching the same, is this; Ismael was the first (according to that Italian Author, others ascribe it to A∣brahara) that built the Temple at Mecca, & hauing to wife an Egypti∣an Idolatresse, had by her twelue sonnes, which (as he saith) being dispersed in Arabia, Persia, Armenia, sowed so many sorts of Religion: and Chedar his second sonne, placed in the Temple of his father (vpon a high Tower called Al∣quibla) an Idoll named Allech and Alleze, instituting certaine ceremonies: and a∣mongst the rest, the sacrificing of a Ramme, in remembrance of that Ramme which was presented to his grandfather Abram at the offering of Isaac. Of Chedar Fortalitium fi∣dei reckoneth another gene∣alogie: and the Saracen Chro∣nicle continu∣eth this, euen from Adam; not agreeing with themselues or any truth. descen∣ded Thebic, and so in order, Caab, Numhib, Almucaien, Ahlucen, Acaha, Amubasca, Amir, Celif, Nisca, Abhimaista, Aadirem, Scaad, Mudhar, Ilges, Mudicita Hudhatfa, Chinene, Anascere, Melich, Phasce, Paliff, Lunai, Cabnai, Morta, Chalef, Facien, Ab∣damanef, Abdalmutalif, Abdalla the supposed father of Mahumet: His mothers name was Hennina or Henima a Iewesse (as some l.Bo.Ben.Vo∣later.&c. write) his father was an Ethnike or Pa∣gan Idolatour. His base condition and obscurity was such, that the Turks themselues doubt whether hee were an Arabian or Persian, notwithstanding that genealogicall table. Christ.Richer. Richerius reporteth that hee was a Cyrenean by birth, and that in the time of his minority or childhood, he was by some Plagiary stolne away from his friends, and sold to the Ismaelite-merchants. Others say, that hee was abandoned both of father and mother, and (according to the cruell custome of that barbarous people) sold to strangers; From so base a beginning did this cunning impostor and seducer of the World arise, to be the scourge of Princes, and disturber of the World. Hee was comely of person, and of sharpe wit, Vid. p.202. and therefore was made ouerseer of the businesse of Abdalmutalef his Maister, or (as some say) his Grandfather: and traded for him in Soria, Egypt, and Persia, and after his death, inherited his goods: Continuing his trade of merchandise with a great man of Cotozan, he succeeded him in his bed and wealth, by the marriage of his widdow Gadisa (whom Arab.Nob.in Alcor.esut. others call A∣dega the daughter of Hulert) and that (as some suspect not vnprobably) by the help of sorceries and incantations. With this widdow, after she was become his wife; hee
liued in his wonted course of life thirteene yeres, and had by her one sonne, and three daughters. And by this meanes growne great, he aspired higher; assembling to him∣selfe a company of theeues, vnthrifts, and outlawes, which with him became volun∣taries and Aduenturers in the warres of the Emperour Heraclius against the Persians: in which he valourously behaued himselfe, and was there wounded in the visage, and Cosdroes the Persian King was ouercome. After this, Mahomet, deuising further how to satisfie his ambitious desire of soue∣raignety, met with occasion fitting those his aspiring designes. The Arabians being denyed their pay (as is sayd) raysed a mutinie, This mutiny according to others hapned many yeares after that Ma∣humet had vn∣der the cloake of Religion furthered his ambition and rebellion. and rebellion: These chose Mahu∣met to be their Captaine, who vsed them as his instruments of robbery and violence about the countreys of Mecca. But the Nobles opposing themselues against him; he, perceiuing that their power and authority would bee a perillous rubbe in his way, thought it his safest course to insinuate with them, and therefore sought by alliance to winne their better liking, taking some of their daughters to his wiues: of which he had at one time eleuen, and in all his life fifteene, besides two slaues. Heraclius at that time fauouring the heresie of the Monothelites, and neglecting the affaires of the Empire, Mahumets proiects tooke better effect. Hummar also and Mauchia caused all Soria, Iudaea and Aegypt to rebell. Sergius at that time a Ne∣storian Monke of Constantinople (thence for that heresie excommunicated) resorting to Mahumet, kindled these sparkes into a great fire, perswading him to countenance his rebellion, with the pretence of religion; the rather now that Heraclius had offen∣ded the Christians by his exactions and heresies, and the Iewes, by new cruelties, be∣cause by Magicke hee had beene warned to beware of the circumcised Nation. Thus some male contented Iewes, and some hereticall Christians being called to counsell, it was agreed, that he should professe himselfe to be chosen in this turbulent state of the world, to bring vnto the same a New Laws, appoynted heereunto by Diuine authority: to the Iewes affirming himselfe their expected Messias; to the Christians promising amiddest so many heresies Therule of Truth; to the excommunicate he∣retikes, restitution of their persons and goodes; to seruants, liberty; to subiects, im∣munitie from tribute. And thus hee caused himselfe of Sergius to bee baptized, and to bee He neither was circumci∣sed himselfe, (saith an Ara∣bian noble∣man in confu∣tation of the Alcoran) nor did command anything ther∣of in his Iawe. circumci∣sed also of Abdalla a Iew, hauing before beene a Paynime. After hee got himselfe into a caue two miles from the Towne called Garhe, continuing there two yeeres in company of Sergius and Abdalla, which acquainted him with the Christian and Iew∣ish Principles: and in the night resorted to his wife, whome hee perswaded to this vaine beleefe by Zeidinus his seruant, rewarding him therefore with freedome, and proclayming (as by an Edict from Heauen) the like liberty to all seruants of all sorts, which would follow him. This rout resorting to him, and by their numbers strength∣ning his faction, their maisters not alittle aggreeued, gaue out a rumour, that Ma∣humet was madde, and possessed of a Deuill, and that an euill end would befall him and his followers. And although they might haue gotten him into their hands, yet in regard of his nine vnckles, and some noble Families linked with him in kindred, viz. the Corassists, the Hassinists, the Benitamines, they abstained from further ri∣gour. Thus with the helpe of Sergius and Sansauino calleth him Bacira, and ad∣deth also Ni∣cholas a Priest of Rome. Baira a Iacobite, and Cillienus, in the caue, with the fauour of his two vnckles, Hanza and Alabem at Mecca, with his elder bro∣ther (that tooke his daughter Fatima) and Eubocara (a chiefe man of that place, after his father in law) he composed after his and their pleasure Constitutions and Canons, and published the same at Mecca; with protestation that the Angel Gabriel had been sent to him from God, as in old times to the prophets, to teach him these things. And in the first place commanding them to beleeue in God the Creator of heauen and earth, the cau∣ser of raines and fruits, that inflicts death on men, & after raiseth them vp to giue them either, in reward of their good works, paradise; or of their bad, hel; & such other things, neuer before heard of among these simple idolatrous inhabitants of Mecca, he grew in great estimation.
For in Persia and Arabia, before this time, some worshipped a Tree, which they called Putulangua, offering sacrifices thereto: some an Idoll, called Bliomum; and some the Sunne; and others, other idolatries; spread by the so many sonnes of Ismael: and therefore the ruder multitude, astonished with these Propheticall and Angelicall Titles, were easily bewitched. And by degrees he published his intended wicked∣nesse, not sparing outragious villanies, as Mahomet a Theefe and Murtherer. the stealing of a Camell, the murthering of a Iew sleeping vnder a Tree. Yea, he pretended not humane infirmitie, but diuine authoritie, to his most mischieuous designments. For example, being lustfully affected to An Adulte∣rer. Zameb, the daughter of Gaissi, the wife of Zaidi, he writ in his Law, That after vow or promise of marriage it was lawfull for him to enioy her, and (if he pleased) to take her to his wife. And being reprehended, that Aissa his wife A Wittall. was dishonest with Za∣phagam, the sonne of Almuthathum, the Angell (forsooth) said, she was chast. And be∣ing found, by his wiues, with Marie the wife of Macobe, the King of the Iacobites, he in another Chapiter is absolued of his oath, and free to lye with any woman, not be∣ing able to containe himselfe, notwithstanding he had sworne so to doe. And by the same authoritie he enioyned them penance, for blaming the Prophet. And willing to diuorce one of his wiues, but fearing the greatnesse of her kindred, he frameth one Chapiter, blaming him for fearing men more then God. He wanteth not his miracles also in his Legend. As he iourneyed in the heat of the day Mahomets miracles. with his Camels, a Cloud couered his head from the scorching heat of the Sunne, about the seuenteenth yeare of his age. And when he first entred the Caue, he saw the Angell Gabriel in his proper shape, with white wings on a Seat of Gold be∣twixt Heauen and Earth, who brought him his Prophecie: and going to Mecca to tell his wife; the Beasts, Trees, Stones, and Hearbes saluted him with the name of a Prophet and a Messenger of GOD; and the trunke of a Tree standing in the way, diuided it selfe for him to passe betweene, and then after closed againe. He also, to satisfie his incredulous vnckle Bugellinus, caused the Moone to descend from Heauen, and entred into his sleeue, and after parted it selfe in two, and then ascended againe. To satisfie the peoples doubtings, he caused a Bull (taught before to come at his call) to bring on his hornes a Chapiter, which he there had tied, to testifie the truth of Mahomet. But while the fame of this his Propheticall Function filled the mouthes of the vul∣gar with acclamations, it no lesse filled the hearts of the Nobles of Mecca with dis∣daine, who sought therefore to apprehend him; but he closely fled to From this slight they be∣gin the com∣putation of their Hegira. Ietrib or Me∣dina with his followers, where he liued with the name of a Prophet thirteene yeares. He depriued a certaine Carpenters poore Orphans of their patrimonie, and consecra∣ted their House into a Temple. This Citie being for most part inhabited with Iewes, they asked a signe in confirmation of his Office. He said, That he was not sent with miracles, but denuntiation of Armes here, and Hell hereafter: and those which would not receiue his new Doctrine, he expelled by force. Being absolute Lord here, hee aspired also to the Dominion of Mecca. He sent thirtie horse with Hanzeta to robbe the Merchants, trauelling thither: but being then preuented, he sent, foure yeares after, sixe hundred of his best souldiors, vnder Hngaida, to assault Mecca, but he also was discomfited: yet not desisting his enterprise, seuen yeares after he at∣chieued it, and after eleuen battailes entred and sacked the Towne, and gaue the spoyle to his souldiors: and for feare, the neighbouring-Cities submitted them∣selues. Mahomet herewith encouraged, assaulted the Persians and Aegyptians, ex∣changing with those he conquered his New Religion for their old wealth and liber∣tie, binding the Gouernours thereunto. But now being old, and through his intem∣perances weake, and diseased also with the Falling Sicknesse, he coloured his often falling with pretext of Gabriels brightnesse, and the vnsufferable splendour of his pre∣sence. He was of meane stature, large sinewes, browne colour, broad face, with a cut lippe, and had one of his fore-teeth stricken out in one Expedition, and in ano∣ther
his face wounded. He had a great head, thinne haires, long shankes, not pro∣portionable to his head. He was of few words, but deceitfull; couetous, and with∣all prodigall, (but of other mens goods) and in deeds of lust equalling himselfe to fortie other men, or (as some say) fiftie. When he was threescore & three yeares of age, in the moneth of Iuly, Anno 645. he died; of which, he liued in trade of Merchandise thirtie eight, and in the Caùe two; at Mecca tenne, in Medina thirteene. He had com∣manded, that they should not bury him; for that on the third day after he would as∣cend in body and soule into Heauen. Meane-while the earth being poysoned with the stinke of his carkasse, they buried him, not at Mecca (as some affirme) but at Medina. His Law, in his life time, sustained many alterations; Cellenus his Scribe writing what himselfe pleased: and the seuerall parcels of the same being collected by Odmen, one of his successors, this Booke was thereupon called Alcaron, that is, a Summarie, or Collection of Precepts. Thus Mahomet aduantaged himselfe with the mutinous Rebels, Fugitiues, Vnthrifts, Apostata-Iewes, and hereticall Christians in that diseased State of the Empire: the bodie whereof was afflicted on the East by the Persians, on the West by the Gothes and other Barbarians, and fretted within the owne bowels by intestine rebellions: the Soule thereof being no lesse torne and rent by the Sects and Heresies of the Arrians, Donatists, Nestorians, Pelagians, and others. He fishing in these troubled waters, set on foot his new Religion, to bring light to the Gentiles, and to mitigate to the Iewes and Christians the seueritie of the Law and Gospell. But the Mahumetanes themselues doe report otherwise, fabling of this fabler great matters, as if he had beene the Promise and Hope of Nations, and the most excellent personage of the World. They haue written a Booke of the generation of Mahomet to this effect: Legend of Mahomet, He∣manno Dalmata interprete. The Booke of the generation of Mahomet, the Messenger of GOD, (the Prayer and Saluation of GOD be vpon him) from Adam and Eue to the time when GOD brought him forth, gracious, perfect, and fit for himselfe. When as Kabachbar had learned out of the These Pro∣phets were Ab∣nabdall, Ab∣nalmutaira, A∣buzaid, Abama∣chumet, Alabez, Alfad, Abulam∣bez, Ezerigi, Ab∣namare, Kabal∣chabar (scholler of Kabelmedi) or Kabalachbar Scriptures, and by Astrologie, that his Prophet should be borne to the world, he heard, That there was a man borne in Ieseras, a Citie of Ara∣bia, hauing all such markes and tokens, as he had fore-seene by the Prophecies and his Art, viz. a spot on his forehead, a print betweene his shoulders, &c. And to sa∣tisfie his desire, he went thither to see; where finding those tokens fulfilled in young Mahomet, he thereupon expounded the darke mysterie of his farre-fetched Light, learned of his Master Kabelmedi in this manner: When Adam was newly created, as he stood vp, his braine shaked and made a noyse, as the leaues doe, which are shaken with the winde: whereat Adam wondering, GOD said vnto him, The sound which thou hast heard is the signe of the Prophets and Messengers of my Commaundements. Take heede therefore that thou commit this Seed of Light on∣ly to worthie Loynes, and to a cleane Wombe. And this A Mahume∣tan Chronicle saith, That this Light claue to the hands of God two thou∣sand yeares before Adam, worshipping him as the An∣gels; after in∣closed in the Rib of Adam, &c. Light of Mahomet that should be borne, shined from the face of Adam, as the Sunne or Moone at the full. And when hee had begotten Seth, that Light passed instantly from the face of Adam into the face of Eue, insomuch, that the birdes of the Aire, and beastes of the Earth, wondered at her beautie. Yea, the Angels euery day salu∣ted her, and brought her odours out of Paradise, till she brought forth Seth alone, hauing before, at euerie burthen, brought forth a brother and a sister. Seth inherited this light, which remained betweene heauen and earth, the Angels thereby ascending and descending vpon Seth, and crying alwaies, Retoyce thou earth, worthy of the light of Mahomet, on him be the prayer and saluation of God. Adam draw∣ing neere to his end, declared vnto him, by his Testament, the mysterie of that Light, and the Genealogie of the Prophets. Then descended Gabriel, accompanied with threescore and tenne thousand Angels, bearing euery one of them a white leafe and a penne, which signed the writing, for the continuance of the order of the Propheticall generation. Seth receiued this writing, and was clothed with a dou∣ble redde garment, shining as the Sunne, and soft as the violet-flower.
From him it passed by succession to Noe and Sem; then to Abraham, at whose birth to Lights from the East and West (meeting in the middest) lightned the whole World: and the Angels were heard singing, That it was the Light of the Prophet Mahomet, who should be borne of his Seed, whose Word should be in the vertue of GOD. This Light passed from Abraham to the face of Hagar, being with childe, and after to Ismael; and God told him, That the Soule of Mahomet, in the begin∣ning of the Creation, was mingled with his, and that his name in Heauen should be Asmet, in Earth Mahomet, in Paradise Abualtrazim. At this Sara grieued, vntill three Angels comforted her with the promise of Isaac. From Ismael it remooued to Keidar his sonne, who being indued with Sound, cou∣ragious, faire, swift, iust, a Hunter, and Archer. seuen Gifts, married Nulta of the Land of Isaac, but, being warned by an Oracle, he tooke to wife Algadira, an Arabian; and after, by diuine warning, carried the chest of this Light vnto Iacob. Then was Hamel borne to him, and receiued the same Light; in which succeeded Thebicht, Hamiessa, Adeth, Aduve, Adne, Machat, Nizar, Musar, Aliez, Madraca, Horei∣ma, Knieua, Anofra, Melic, Falhrem, Luie, Galiben, Kab, Murran, Cudai, Abdamenef, Hefim, a man by diuine testimonie free of all vncleanenesse. To him did all Kings offer their daughters in marriage, and among the rest Constantine, which he refused, and married Seline the daughter of Zeit, and had by her Abdalmutalib, whose Light caused raine in drought. To him an Elephant prostrated himselfe, and sayd with mans voice, Saluation be on you, and on the Light that shineth out of your Reiues, Dig∣nitie, Fame, Honour, and Victorie be on you: and that there should proceede from him a King, greater then all the Kings of the Earth. Another time, as he slept on the stone which was placed by Abraham in his Oratorie at Mecca, hee dreamed of a chayne reaching East and West, and to Heauen, and to the Depth, which was pre∣sently conuerted into a flourishing hearbe. Noe and Abraham presented themselues interpreters of this Dreame. Abdalla his sonne, the father of Mahomet, had a tu∣tor giuen vnto him, to defend him from his enemies, who seemed a man, but was none. Hee was preserued from the lying in wait of the Iewes, by threescore and tenne Angels, which seemed men. He wedded or Hemina, daughter of Abdemenef. Ermina, and therefore two hun∣dred women perished for his loue; some hanging, some burning themselues. When the prescribed time was come, in the moneth Dulheia, on a Friday night, God bad Ariduvan to open the gates of Paradise, that the innermost of his secret might be manifested: for it pleaseth me (sayth he) this night to transport the Light of my Prophet from the reines of Abdalla into the wombe of Ermina, and that it come into the world. This being done, as Abdalla, the Iudge and Lord of the Ara∣bians, went into the house of Prayer, he perceiued a great Light to lighten from his house vp toward Heauen, and presently died. On the twelfth day of Rab, on a Tues∣day, Mahomet was borne, circumcised, and all frolicke. And then all Idols fell and became blacke: All Kingdomes were destroyed, and not one stood vpright. Lucifer was cast into the bottome of the Sea, and in fortie dayes could not get out, and then called his fellowes, and told them, that Mahomet was borne with the power of the sword, who would take away all their power. The same also God caused to be proclai∣med in Heauen and Earth. His mother said, That she was deliuered of him without paine, and Angelicall birds came to nourish the child, and that a man clothed in white presented him with three keyes, like to Pearles, which he tooke; the key of Victorie, the key of the Lawes, and the key of Prophecie. And after came three persons with shining faces, presenting him a cauldron of Emeralds, with foure handles, which Ma∣homet accepted as a signe of his rule ouer all the world. The Birds, Clouds, Windes, Angels, contended for the nourishment of the child. But the case was determined by heauenly voice, affirming, That he should not be taken from the hands of men. An Asse, almost famished, worshipped him, and receiuing him on her backe, became Herald to this new Prophet, with mans voice proclaiming the worthi∣nesse of her Carriage. Three men carried him vp into a Mountaine: of which, one of them opened him from the Breast vnto the Nauell, and washed his
entrailes with snow: the second cleared his heart in the middest, and tooke out of it a blacke graine, saying, That it was the portion of the Deuill. The third made him whole againe. Seraphim nourished him three yeares, and Gabriel nine and twentie, who gaue vnto him, in the fortieth yeare of his age, the Law, and carried him to Heauen. This his iourney is related by Frier Richard sometimes a student in the Vni∣uersitie of Baldach, Cap. 14. and in his life See also Bellon. obseruat. lib.3.c.7. Gabriel, with threescore and tenne paire of wings, came to Mahomet, in the chamber of Aissa, his best beloued wife, and said, That GOD would haue him to visit him where he is; and brought with him the Beast Elmparac, or Alborach, of nature betweene a Mule and an Asse. This Beast told Mahomet, That he would not take him on his backe, till he had prayed to GOD for him. His steppes were as farre as one could see, so that in the twinckling of an eye he had brought Mahomet to Ie∣rusalem. Then Gabriel with his Girdle tyed the Beast to a Rocke, and La  Ma∣hometi sayth, In a shin ng ladder they went vp to Heauen, where the starres hung by golden chaynes, as big as Mount Notho by Me∣dina. carried Ma∣homet on his shoulders into Heauen; where hee knocked, and the Porter opened. Here Mahomet saw There were in the first Heauen An∣gels of the shapes of all creatures, praying for the creatures of their shapes: and a Cocke, whose feet touched one Heauen, and head the other, whose crowing mo∣ued the Cocks of the earth to doe so. In the second was Noe. This Heauen was of Gold; the third of Pearls, where∣in was Abra∣ham and the huge huge Angell of Death, with his booke and pennein hand, writing the times of mens liues: (which fatall opinion maketh them hardie) The fourth was of Emerald: here was Ioseph and the Angell of Compassi∣on weeping for the sinnes of men. The fifth of Dia∣mond, and in it Moses. The sixt of Rubie, and in it Iohn Baptist. The seuenth of Fire, and in it IESVS CHRIST. All these recommended themselues to his Prayers. troupes of Angels, and prayed twice on his knees for them: and amongst the rest, old old Father Adam, reioycing for such a sonne, and com∣mending him to his prayers. Then he brought him to the second Heauen, which was a iourney of fiue hundred yeares, and so forth on to the seuenth Heauen: Here he saw the Angelicall people, euery of which was a thousand times greater than the world, and euery of them had threescore and tenne thousand heads, and euery head threescore and tenne thousand mouthes, and euery mouth seuenteene hundred tongues, praying GOD in seuen hundred thousand Languages. And he saw one Angell weeping, and he asked the cause, who answered, That hee was Sinne. And Mahomet prayed for him. Then Gabriel commended him to another Angell, and he to another, and so forth in order, till he came before GOD and his Throne. Then GOD (whose face was couered with threescore and tenne thousand clothes of light, and from whom Mahomet stood two stones cast below) touched him with his hand, the coldnesse whereof pierced to the marrow of his backe-bone. And GOD sayd, I haue imposed on thee and on thy people Prayers. When he was returned as farre as the fourth Heauen, Moses counselled him to returne backe, to obtaine ease vnto the people, which could not beare so many prayers, which hee did oftentimes, till there remained but few. Thus returning to his Elmparac, he rode backe to his house at Mecca. All this was done in the tenth part of the night. But when he was reque∣sted to doe thus much in the peoples sight, he answered, Praysed be GOD, I am a Man, and an Apostle. The Booke Asear (sayth Bellonius) telleth further, That in this iourney Maho∣met heard a womans voice, crying, Mahomet, Mahomet, but he held his peace. Af∣terwards another called him, but he gaue no answere. Mahomet asked the Angell who they were? He answered, That the one was shee which published the Iewes Law, and if he had answered her, all his Disciples should haue beene Iewes: the o∣ther was shee which deliuered the Gospell, whome if he had answered, all his follow∣ers had beene Christians. The said Booke telleth, That GODS face was couered with threescore and tenne thousand Linnen Clothes made of Light, and that GOD gaue him a fiue∣fold priuiledge. First, That he should be the highest creature in Heauen or Earth: Secondly, the most excellent of the sonnes of Adam: Thirdly, An vniuersall Re∣deemer: Fourthly, Skilfull in all Languages: Fifthly, That the spoyles of Warres should be giuen him. Gabriel after (sayth that Booke) carried him to Hell, to see the secrets thereof, and the seuen gates thereof, &c. where (as in the place fittest for him) wee will leaue him. The Booke of the vertues of Mahomet sayth, That in glorying of his strength he would boast, that he had knowne his eleuen wiues suc∣cessiuely in one houre.
One of their Chronicles telleth of his martiall affaires. This Chronicle recko∣neth from Adam to Noe one thousand two hundred two and fortie yeares: From thence to Abraham, one thousand and fourescore: Hence to Moses, fiue hundred and fifteene: After him to Dauid, fiue hundred threescore and nine: and from this time to CHRIST, one thousand three hundred and fiftie: from whence to Ma∣homet is numbred sixe hundred and twentie; in all fiue thousand three hundred threescore and sixteene, from Adam to Mahomet. All the Prophets were in num∣ber an hundred and siventie thousand, and the Messengers of GOD three hundred and fifteene: where of Adam, Seth, Esdrik. Noe, Abraham, were Hebrewes; Huth, Schale, Ishmael, Schaib, Mahomet were Arabians. If this Historie of Mabomets life be long and tedious, I thought good, out of an Arabian Chronicle, to adde this Epitome thereof. His mother died in a iourney to Mecca, when he was foure yeares old, and his Nurse restored him to his Grand∣father Abdalmutalif. with whome he liued eight yeares. The Seraphim preserued him, but was neuer seene. After that, Gabriel was his Guardian, of whome he re∣ceiued the Law, which hee kept close three yeares, communicating it onely to some of his owne opinion, by whose helpe he became Priest and Prince of the A∣rabians and and Saracens, and about eighteene moneths after was carried into Hea∣uen, and being returned into the Earth, hee tooke Eubocara, Ali, and Zaid to be his companions in this enterprise. Hee went to Zaif, or Atharf, and preached publikely, and thence to Mecca, tenne yeares going from place to place. And of his Conuerts, he chose some for guard of his Person, who sware the obseruance of his Law, to the number of fortie, who now with Word, now with the Sword, set forward this Doctrine. After tenne yeares, Mecca was peopled onely with belee∣uers; and all Arabia was conuerted, without difficultie. Then he sent to the neigh∣bouring Kings to become of his Religion; to the King of Persia, to the Romane Emperour, to King Cinna, to the Lord of the two Seas, to the King of Aethiopia, &c. After he returned to Iehib, and on Tuesday, the twelfth of Rab, in the ele∣uenth yeare, died. His Sepulture was appointed by GOD in the House of Aisca his wife, in the Chamber where he was wont to sleepe, where, at this day, is a Temple of Bricke. His bodie was wrapped in throe white Clothes, without any pompe. His Seale was a Siluer Ring, with this inscription, MAHOMET the Messenger of GOD. He went twice on Pilgrimage, and nineteene times con∣ducted an Armie. The place of his buriall is at Medina, surnamed of him Talnabi Nabi, a Pro∣phet. , that is, of the Prophet; not (as some write) at Mecca. Neither doth his Corpes hang in the ayre by force of Load-stones, drawing vp his Iron Coffin or Chest, but lyeth buried in the ground (if any where) as Ludouicus Vertomus, by his owne view, hath obser∣ued. Of this place, and of Mecha, we shall speake more, in relating the Rites of the Pilgrims that visit them. Some relate otherwise of the death of Mahomet, as that he died at fortie yeares of age, being poysoned by one of his Disciples, called Albunor, to make tryall of his boasting Prophecie, that he would rise againe within three dayes after his death. The booke of the Policie of the Turkish Empire. This Albuner after comming to see him, found his bodie torne in pieces, and deuoured of dogges: whereupon gathering together the bones that remained, into a Coffin, he caused them to be buried. Which in my minde is not so probable as the former report.
CHAP. IIII. Of the Alcoran, or Alfurcan, containing the Mahumetane Law: the summe and contents thereof. THe Booke of Mahomets Law is called by the name of Alcoran, which signifieth a collection of Precepts; and Alfurcan, (as it is expressed and expounded in a Booke Harman. Dal. interprete. called the Exposition or Do∣ctrine of the Alcoran) because the sentences and figures thereof are seuered and distinguished. For the Word of GOD, (sayth Mahomet in that Booke) came not to me all at once, as the Law vnto Moses, the Psalmes to Dauid, and the Gospell to CHRIST. The Sentences or Chap∣ters thereof are called Azoaras, which is interpreted a Face, as wee call them Ca∣pita, Heads. The Stile The stile of it. is not in Meter, as some haue imagined: for Iosephus Sca∣liger In annotatio∣nibus in Euseb. Chron. Solum Canticum Mosis extreme Deute∣ronomie, prouer∣bia Salomonis, & totus ferè li∣ber Iob quadam rythmi necessita∣te cohibentur, qui rhythmus est instar duarum dimetriarum Iambicarum—Sed allqnande pauciorum sunt syllabarum, ali∣quando plurium &c.—Nam vt in Hebraico, Sy∣riaco, Arabico, et Abyssino idioma∣te vlla metri species concipi polsit, nemo effi∣cere possit, quia¦id natura ser∣monis non pati∣tur. . (a great Criticke, and reputed one of the greatest Linguists in the world) af∣firmeth, That that Language is not capable of metricall measures by quantities of Syllables; as neither the Hebrew, Abyssine, or Syrian. He sayth yet, That the Alco∣ran is composed in Rime, but such, as is not in any tunable proportion; but that word which maketh vp the Rime, being sometimes neerer, and sometimes farre be∣yond all harmonie, distanc from that word whereto it answereth. At the end of such Rimes are set the figures of Flowers, or some such matter: which if it bee so, the Turkish nicetie of making no likenesse of any thing in their Carpets, or other Workes, is stricter then these Alcoran-bookes themselues, and indeede is not common with them vnto other Mahometanes, who vse their libertie in this point. For the words and The phrase. phrase; no man euer writ any thing in Arabian more rudely (sayth an Arabian Christian in confutation hereof) and much better might Muzei∣lenia, Heleaifi, and Alabazbi the Aethiopian, and Calbata Ellecdi, which vpon e∣mulation composed also euerie one an Aleoran, glorie of those their Workes, con∣taining more honestie and truth. Neither hath it pleased any noble or wise man, but the rude vulgar: of which sort, the wearie labourers gladly gaue eare to his promise of Paradise, the poore delighted to heare of Gardens in Persia, and Bankrupts and Felons easily listened to securitie and libertie. The method The method. is so confused, that our Arabian Author (who liued before it was so generally embraced, & in freer times) sayth, That hee had heard euen good Saracens affirme with griefe, that it was so mixed and heaped together, that they could finde no Reason in it. Bad Rime as you haue heard, and worse Reason. Hierome Sananorola Hieron. Sauan. hath the like saying, That no man can finde herein any order: Nor could so confused and foolish a Worke pro∣ceede from any naturall or supernaturall light. It is yet craftily The subtiltie. contriued, when he hath set downe some wicked Doctrine, presently to lace and fringe it with Pre∣cepts of Fasting, Prayer, or Good manners. The Copies thereof The agree∣ment of copies were diuerse; and after Mahomets death made (if it could be) worse, at least otherwise, then he left them. For Hali had one Copie left him by Mahomet, which the Iewes corrup∣ted, adding, racing, changing at their pleasure, and promised him their assistance, if he would professe himselfe a Prophet. But Ozimen commaunded all the Bookes to be brought and deliuered into the hands of Zeidi and Abdalla, to bring all into one Booke, and, where they dissented, to reade after the Copie of Corais, and to burne all the rest. They thus composed the Alcoran, whereof they left foure Copies, which after were lost. And yet Hali, Abitalib, and Ibenmuzed then refused to deliuer vp their Bookes: Whereupon arose diuerse Readings, and afterward diuerse Schismes; which to compound, others often endeuored by like labours after, but could not throughly perfect the same.
The The truth of the matter in it. truth thereof is such in his deuisings of new, and eeking and altering the old, that it is not probable in Vines opinion, that euer he read the old and new Testament: for (saith Io.Ludonic. Viu. he) though I thinke of him exceeding badly, yet thinke I him not so madde to change and wrest the Scripture, there especially, where it made nothing against him: but he had partly heard of such things, partly was so perswaded by his fellowes, Apo∣stata-Iewes and Christians. This riming, harsh, confused, packing, worke, disagreeing each copie from other, and all from truth and honestie, hath beene The Trans∣laters. translated into La∣tine Anno 1143. once by an English man, Robertus Retmensis; and after by Ioannes Segobienfis, a Spaniard, at the Councell of Constance, and after out of Italian into Arabian published by Andrea Ariuabene. The first, and last of these, that is, Retineufis and the Italian trans∣lations are heere by vs followed. It containeth chapters, or Azoard's 124. euery of them beginning, In the name of the mercifull and pitifull GOD. The first In the Italian are 124. chapt. besides this first: and the Easterne Sara∣cens, reckon it but one, Azo. to the fifth. Bellon. lib.3. di∣uideth it into foure bookes, and 201. chap. of these are the words of Mahomet, and is called the Mother of the booke, and is as it were their Creed: the rest are all deliuered as the words of GOD; he being induced as speaker. The first is in this sense. In the name of the mercifull and pitifull GOD. Thankes be vnto GOD the LORD of the world, mercifull, pitifull, Iudge at the day of Iudgement. We pray vnto thee: we trust in thee. Leade vs into the right way, the way of them whom thou hast chosen, not of them with whom thou art angrie, and of the Infidels. Of Of God and Christ. GOD he Azo. 12. writeth further, that he is One, necessarie to all, incorporeall, which neither hath begotten, nor is begotten, nor hath any like him: the Creator, long-suf∣fering, searcher of the heart, true. That he will confound inchantments, that without his gift, none can beleeue (this his Alcoran,) that he hath no sonne, for he needeth no∣thing Az. 20. , and he which setteth a second in the place of GOD shall goe into hell, Az.31. and he hath no partaker, 32. yet in Azoar. 67. hee induceth God speaking thus: To CHRIST the SONNE of Mary wee haue giuen the Gospell, that by him men may obtaine the loue and fauour of God: and that the beleeuers amongst them (Chri∣stians) shall receiue a great reward: as also in Az.. 2. he saith, Euery one whosoeuer liueth rightly, be he Iew or Christian, or if he leaueth his owne Law, and embrace an∣other, if he worship God, and doe good, shall vndoubtedly obtaine Diuine fauour. Of the birth of CHRIST he wrireth thus, Azo. 29. We sent our Spirit to Mary (the best of all women, and the wombe vntouched, Azoar.31.) in likenesse of a man, pro∣fessing himselfe a Dluine messenger concerning a Sonne, &c. And when she in trauell plained, CHRIST came from vnder her, and said, Feare not: and when some chidde with her about the child, the child it selfe made answere, I am the Seruant and Prophet of GOD. He saith, the Iewes did not slay CHRIST, but one like him, Azo. 11. and vpbraideth them, for not receiuing him, Azo. and chap. 4. To CHRIST, the Sonne of Mary, properly communicating our owne soule, we haue giuen him strength and power more then other Prophets: yet chap.14. he excuseth that worship which is done him and his mother. Concerning Of his law, and the fol∣lowers there∣of. his Law and Alcoran, he handleth it in the second Chapter or Azoa∣ra, which beginneth thus. In the name of the mercifull and pitifull God. This booke without any false-hood or error, shewing the truth (to them which loue, feare, and worship God, and are studious of prayers and almes) and the obseruation of the lawes giuen of God from heauen to thee and other thy predecessors, and the hope of the world to come, hath manifested the true sect. For this bringeth the followers thereof to the highest, inricheth them with the highest good, as to the vnbeleeuers and erro∣neous, it menaceth truly the greatest euill to come. This he after applieth to Paradise and hell. This his Alcoran he calleth the establishing of the Law of the Israelites: and Azo. 21. he arrogateth to his booke wisdome and eloquence: and 47. he saith, Azoara 47. it was composed of the incomprehensible and wise God, euery where agreeing with it selfe, and calleth it (63) the booke of Abraham: and (69.) if it should be placed on a mountaine, that mountaine for diuine feare would be dissolued. Those which will not be conuerted, take and slay, by all meanes intrapping them: and fight against them till they be your tributaries and subiects. The fifteenth part of all the prey is due vnto
God, and his Prophet, and to your kindred and orphans, and the poore. Those that are taken in warre kill or make slaues; but pardon them if they will turne to your law, and God also will pardon them. Such good warriours shall haue full pardon. The Iewes and Christians (contrarie to that he had said before) let God confound. He hath sent his messenger with the right way and good law, that he may manifest and extoll it aboue all lawes. Of the twelue months foure are to be consecrated to fight against the enemies. Those that refuse this war-fare lose their soules. The fire of hell is hotter then the danger of warre. And although thou (Prophet) shouldest pardon the resisters of God and his messenger seuentie times, yet God will neuer pardon them. The sicke and weake, and such as haue not necessaries, are excused from this necessitie of warre: but to the good warriours God giueth Paradise, in reward of their soules and goods, whether they kill or be killed. Azo. 18.19. And in 57. Kill the vnbeleeuers whom you conquer, till you haue made great slaughter. God could take vengoance on them, but he chuseth rather to doe it by you: he shall lay deafenesse and blindnesse on the faint∣hearted. Yet in 52. and 98. as contrarie to himselfe he affirmeth, that he is sent onely to teach, not to compell and force men to beleeue: except we expound it rather, that Iewes, Christians, and all vnbeleeuers, are compelled to be tributaries, and their slaues; not forced to their religion, but instructed only; which agreeth with their pra∣ctise. From this doctrine, and that of destinie in the 50. Az. hath risen their forward∣nes to the warre, and the greatnesse of their conquests. Agreeable to this doctrine is their manner of teaching it: the Reader or Preacher (as saith Frier Richard, student a∣mongst them in the Vniuersitie of Baldach) holdeth a bare sword in his hand, or set∣teth it vp in an eminent place, to the terrour of the gain-sayers. But disputation Mahomet dis∣claimeth Di∣uine miracles, and humane disputations, prouing with the sword. and reasoning about his law he vtterly disliketh. Az.32. To such as will dispute with thee, answere that God knoweth all thy doings, which in the last day shall determine all controuersies. And 50. Nothing but euill cleaueth to the heart of such as vnwisely dispute of Diuine Precepts: but commend thou thy selfe vnto God, that knoweth all things. And chap. 4. 15. He is commanded to goe away from such. This booke is giuen to take away discord from men: miracles he disclaimeth as insufficient proofe; for though it should make plaine the mountaines, and make the dead to speake, yet they would be incredulous: But it is thy dutie only to shew them my Precepts, Aza. 23. Of the Creation. Creation he affirmeth (Azo.2.) that when God had made the world, he disposed the seuen heauens: he told the Angels he would make one like vnto himselfe in the earth: they answere, we in all things are subiect to your Maiestie, and giue praise vnto you: but he will be wicked and a shedder of bloud. Then God testifying, that he knew a thing not knowne to the Angels, taught Adam the names of things by himself, not knowne to the Angels, and therefore commanded the Angels to doe reuerence before Adam, which wicked Belzebub said he was made of fire, and therefore better then he which was made of earth. Azo.17. Belzebub refused; they obeyed. And Azo. 25. We made man of clay, and I breathed into him a portion of mine owne soule, after that I had created the diuell of Pestiferous fire; and because Belzebub refused to humble himselfe to this man (made of blacke mire) hee was damned, and when he desired respite till the resurrection, it was denied: and therefore he said he would teach all e∣uill things, that they shall not giue thee thankes, &c. Of the Angels he affirmeth (45.) that some of them haue two wings, some three, some foure: and (52.) the heauen would fall vpon men, were it not for the Angels that call vpon God. There they shall possesse rings of gold, chaines, iewels, clothed with cloth of gold; their beds shall be of gold, and this for euer. Of Paradise. Paradise he dreameth in this sort, Az. 65. He which feareth God shall re∣ceiue the two Paradises ful of all good, pleasant with streaming fountaines. There they shall lie on silken and purple carpets, and shall be accompanied with many maidens, beautifull as the Hyacinth and pearles, neuer deflowred of men or Deuils, neuer men∣struous, sitting in pleasant shades with their eyes fixed on their husbands: their eyes large, with the white of them exceeding white, and the blacke very blacke, lying on the shining greene. The Turkes Paradise a beastly carnall one. Faire yong men shall serue them with vials and other vessels, full
of the most excellent liquor, which shall neither cause-head-ach, not drunkennesse, and shall bring them the choicest fruits, and flesh of fowles. They shall there heare no silthie or displeasing word: and (Azo. 86.) In Paradise shall be administred to them in well-wrought vessels of glasse and siluer, drinke, as the sauourie ginger, out of the fountaine Zelzebil: they shall haue garments of silke and gold, chaines of filuer, bles∣sed wine, maidens likewise with prettie breasts: there tall trees of colour betweene yellow and greene. They shall haue in Paradise all pleasures, and shall enioy women with eyes faire, and as great as egges: sweet smelling riuers of milke, and hony, and fruits of all sorts. Of this Paradise, Auicenna (a Mahumetan) saith, that it concerneth the bodie, but wise Diuines more respect the minde; the felicity whereof, in coniun∣ction with truth, they farre preferre before the other of the body. Of Hell Of Hell. he fableth that it hath seuen gates; that it shall make the wicked like to fleas, that they shall be fed with the tree Ezecum, which shall burne in their bellies like fire, that they shall drinke fire; and being holden in chaines of seuentie cubits, shall be kept sure; the fire shall cast forth embers like towers or camels. They which contradict shall be punished with the fire of hell: they which feare, shall goe into Paradise; and as it were in a Of Purga∣torie. middle space betwixt the one and the other, there shall stand some other with hope and expectation of Paradise. We haue set Angels ouer hell, and haue ap∣pointed their numbers (84.) 98. There shall bee fountaines of scalding waters, and they shall eat vpon a reed, but shall not satisfie their hunger: they shall be bound in chaines, 121. He Of the Pro∣phet Maho∣met. sometime excuseth his owne basenesse, as Azo. 36. The vnbeleeuers (saith he) murmure that he is followed only of Weauers, and the raskall-rout. And 53. That the Alcoran was not committed to a man of great possessions: and they say, that it is Art∣magicke, and that I haue fained it. And in 64. The Moone was diuided, and they say it is sorcery. (The tale is told by Frier Richard thus: Mahomet pointed to the Moone with his thumbe, and middle finger, and it was diuided, the two peeces falling on the hilles of Mecha, which entring into Mahomets coat was made whole againe) He Mahomet guilty of his witchcraft, of∣ten speaketh of it: that he may not be thought such a one. sometime extolleth himselfe, blasphemously inducing CHRIST, thus saying to the Israelites; O ye Israelites, I being sent a messenger vnto you from GOD, affirme by the Testament which I haue in my hand, that a Messenger shall come after mee, whose name is Mahomet, of whom they shall say that he is a Magician. 71. His beast∣ly prerogatiue he boasteth, (43.) saying, he is the seale and last of the Prophets. To thee O Prophet, we make it lawfull to lie with all women which are giuen thee, or which thou buyest, and thy Aunts, thy kindred, and all good women which freely desire thy company, if thou be willing: and this is permitted to thee alone. Diuorse these, couple thy selfe to those at thy pleasure. And being by some other of his wiues found in bed with Mary the wife of a Iacobite Christian, he sware that he would neuer after vse her company: but after being impotent in his lusts, he ordaines a law to himselfe, Az. 76. Why doest thou, O Prophet, make that lawfull, for the loue of thy women, which GOD hath made vnlawfull? GOD full of pitie, and giuer of pardon, hath comman∣ded thee to blot out, or cancell thine oathes. Of his iourney to heauen, to receiue the Law, he speaketh. Az. 63. and 82. ming∣ling iniunctions of deuotion. 83. Thou, O Prophet, rising in the night, spend halfe the night, or a little more or lesse, in watching, and continually and deuoutly read ouer the Alcoran: be thou iust, patient, and refuse not to wash thy garments, O thou man clo∣thed in woollen. 43. Let none enter into the house of the Prophet before he call; but let him stand without the gate: let none do dishonestie within his house, let none hurt the Prophet in anything, or haue his wife after him. Some Of the Pro∣phets in Scripture. Prophets he mentioneth, not named in Scripture; and of those there named he telleth many fables. Ismael was a true Prophet, and found a good man before GOD. Ioseph nine yeares imprisoned for the Queene. Abraham ouerthrew his fathers Idols, and should haue beene burned for the same; but the fire lost his force. The mountaines and birds that praise GOD, were subiect to Dauid. Such tales as these of Abra∣ham, Salomon, &c. you shall find both in the Iewish and Popish Le∣gends, as if the Iew, Papist and Mahume∣tan, had con∣tended for the whetstone: which any one that readeth shall find. Salomon learned Magicke of A∣rot and Marot, Diuels so called: he knew the language of birds; and when he was in
the middest of his armie, consisting of diuels, men, and birds: the Lapwing brought him newes of the Queene of Saba's comming, to whom by this Lapwing he sent a letter, &c. Of this armie the Ants or Pisinires being afraid; one Ant perswaded her fel∣lowes to get them into their holes, lest they should be troden on. Moses married Pha∣raohs daughter. (37.) One Aseemel made the golden Calfe in the desert against Aa∣rons will, Pharaoh requested Hemen to build a tower, whereon to climbe to heauen, to the GOD of Moses. (50.) In the time of Noe they worshipped Idols, whom he na∣meth Huden, Schnan, Iaguta, Iannea, Nacem. The Prophet Huth was sent to the nation Haath, to teach them the worship of one GOD: and Schale to Themuth; and Schaibe to Madian; and Abraham and Lot to the Sodomites; on whom, because they were incredulous, it rained yellow and sharpe stones. (Az. 21.) Moses was sent to Pharaoh, &c. His scope of these narrations is, that he is sent likewise a Prophet, and therefore iudgement will pursue them which re∣fuse him, as it did those incredulous nations. These sauour of a Iewish helpe. He telleth also of Alexander Alexander, Mahomets fit∣test Saint to follow. Mag, that he had all knowledge: he found the Sunne, where it lay resting in a yellow fountaine, and the mountaines in which it riseth. And finding men without vse of speech, he diuided them from other men, &c. Az.28. He proueth Of the re∣surrection and last iudg∣ment. substantially that there shall be a resurrection, by the historie of the se∣uen Sleepers, which slept in a caue 360. yeares. (28. Az.) and (49.) He saith, that at the time of death, GOD taketh away the soule at an houre knowne, restoring it to some; to some, neuer: at the first found of the trumpet all shall die, except those which shall be protected by the will of GOD: at the second sound all things shall reuiue, and be iudged: and (66.) The earth shall tremble, the mountaines shall be brought to dust, and the whole company shall be diuided into three parts, before: on the right hand, which shall be blessed; those on the left hand, in their left hands shall receiue the scroll or sentence of their condemnation. And 79. In the last Iudgement the earth shall bee ouerthrowne, the heauen shall be powred forth. 8. Angels shall beare vp the throne of GOD. And (80.) The heauens shall vanish as smoake, and the earth shall be pluc∣ked as wooll. And (111.) There shall be set vp the ballance of Iudgement: they to whom shall befall a light weight, shall liue, but they which haue a heauie weight shall be cast into fire. The booke of bad workes shall be kept in the bottome of the earth; the booke of good workes in a high place. In diuers places of the, Alcoran; the better to colour his filthinesse, he hath dispersed good sentences, like roses scattered on a dung-hill, and flowers in a puddle: concer∣ning almes, prayer, tithing, iustice, &c. Others he hath of another fort establishing his owne tyranny and religion. Morals and Iudieials. Az. 26. Swines-flesh, bloud, that which dieth alone, and that which hath the necke cut off, not in GODS name, is vnlawfull, Azoar. 33. 34. Be chast euerie where, but with your owne wiues, or such as are subiect to you, and do serue you. E∣uery adulterer shall haue an hundred stripes in the presence of many. He which accu∣seth a woman of adultery, not prouing it by foure witnesses, shall haue eightie. The iealous husband accusing his wife, must sweare foure times that he chargeth her truly; and a fifth time curse himselfe, if it be otherwise. The woman must doe the like to cleare her selfe. (43.) After a woman be diuorced from one, any other may marrie her. (19.) Trust not a sonne or a brother, except he be of your owne Law. 72. On Fri∣day when they are called to prayer, they must lay all businesse apart: when prayers be ended, they may returne to their commodities. Redeeme captiues; and thy sinnes, by good workes. About Circumcision I find no iniunction in the Alcoran. In the 3. 8. and 9. Az. He permitteth all licenciousnesse with all women which they haue of their owne: but prescribeth washings after venery, and after naturall easements. Loue not your enemies: the women of another faith proue first: and if they fauour the vnbe∣leeuers, diuorce them. (70.) It is no sinne to reuenge iniuries. 52. the women must co∣uer their faces. 43. The going on Pilgrimage to Mecca. Pilgrimage, and the perpetuall abode at the Temple of Haran (that is, vnlawfull, because nothing but their holies are there lawfull) wee repute of equall merit. They which loue it not, or do it iniurie, shall sustaine grieuous euils. Abraham
founded this Temple, and blessed it, and cleansed it, for them which abode there, and for the pilgrims. He Abraham au∣thor of pilgri∣mage rites. preached one GOD without partaker, and the pilgrimage to this Temple, that on the dayes appointed they might, in naming GOD, sacrifice beasts, wherewith to feast themselues and the poore, and might fulfill their vowes, and goe in procession round about the old Temple, a worke which GOD will greatly reward. Az. 32. and 19. The vnbeleeuers are not worthy to visite the Temple Haran. And these good pilgrims are not equal to the good warriours. 38. He entred into the Tem∣ple Haran with his head shauen. Ridiculous is the confirmation of this holy Law, by such varietie of oathes, as I am almost afraid to mention, in regard of our Gull-gallants of these times, who would sometimes be at a sette in their braue and brauing phrases, if they should not haue va∣rietie of oathes and curses, to daube vp with such interiections all imperfections of speech, & make smoother way for the current of their gallantrie. His oaths But yet euen for their sakes, let vs mention a few, that they may see Mahomet had as braue a humour this way as they. He induceth GOD swearing by lesse then himselfe, as by the order of An∣gels, by the Alcoran, by the blowing windes, by the watery clouds, by the sailing ships, by the Mount Sinai, the heauen, the sea, the euening Starre, the West, his pen and lines, the guiltie soule, the diuels, by the morning, ten nights, the Passeouer, by the figges and oliues, by the dawning, and twilight, and a world more of the like: only he saith (Azoara 1000.) that he may not sweare by the earth, nor by the sonne like to the father. His last Azoara endeth thus, In the names of the mercifull and pitifull GOD: Sanctifie thy selfe, and pray continually and humbly to him which is Lord of all nations, Lord of all, God of all, that he will defend and deliuer thee from the diuell, which entereth the hearts of men, and from diuellish and peruerse men. They which eate the inheritance of orphans, euerlasting fire shall eate them. Iust dealing. Be faithfull in keeping and deliuering their goods, for God taketh knowledge of all ac∣counts. Let one sonne haue as much as two daughters. In bargaining vse no lying, slaying your owne soule. The couetous shall haue endlesse punishment: he that killeth vnwillingly, shall giue to the kindred of the partie slaine, another man; or if he can∣not do that, let him fast two months together: he which killeth wilfully shall be cast into the fire. Salute him which saluteth thee, for salutation is much pleasing to God. Courtesie. 56. The di∣uels hearing the Alcoran, shall be conuerted, and flie from their companions. Yee which are god, beleeue in God, in his Messenger, and in the booke sent from heauen. The Law. They which first beleeue, and after deny, and become incredulous, shall haue no pardon nor mercy of God, but shall goe into the fire. And (11.) We will bring infinite euill vpon him, that will not obey God and his messenger, and will be dispu∣ting. To them which Not to dis∣pute nor seeke a signe in proofe of the Law. demand that the booke may raine vpon them from heauen, thou shalt say that some asked a greater thing of Moses, that he would shew God vnto their eyes, and were therefore smitten with lightning from heauen. (12.) To the Iewes and Christians God hath giuen disagreements, till God shall determine the same at the day of iudgement. Make not your selues companions of them which deride our Law. No man receiueth the perfection of the Law, but he which beleeueth the Testa∣ment, the Gospell, and this booke sent of God. 14. They which erre will say, let God shew vs miracles. These hurt none but their owne soules, for if they should see all The fox will eate no grapes because they are sowre, and hang too high. mi∣racles done, they would dispute with thee, saying, that they could not be done but by inchantments. Thou shalt not come to them with manifest miracles; for they would refuse them, as odious things. 15. Dispute not with them which will not heare; and if they demand miracles, say, God only doth them: I know not the secrets of God, and follow nothing but that which God and the Angell hath commanded: and if Angels should speake to such, they would not beleeue. 16. God himselfe and his blessed Spi∣rit haue compounded this most true booke. 26. 44. They which say his law is new or fained, goe to the diuell. 47. He induceth some gainsayers, saying, we will not leaue worshipping our images for this iester and rimer. Yet is he alone come with the truth,
confirming all the other messengers. 55. He saith I (GOD) writ this booke with my owne hand. 56. The vnbeleeuers say I am a Magician, and haue fained it: but then I pray GOD that I may haue no part in him when he shall be our Iudge. Say not there are three Gods, but one God alone without a Sonne, to him all things are subiect. CHRIST cannot deny but that he is subiect to GOD, as well as the Angels. 12. We sent CHRIST, to whom we gaue the Gospell, which is the light and confirmation of the Testament, and the right way to him which feareth GOD, by the fulfilling of your law. All that say that CHRIST is GOD, are vnbeleeuers and liars (CHRIST himselfe hauing said, Yee children of Israel beleeue in your God and my Lord) of whom he which will be partaker, shall be cast into the fire eternall. CHRIST is but the messenger of God, before whom were many other messengers: and his mother was true, and they did eate. Good people exalt not your selues in your law, further then the truth. 3. The soule of CHRIST was cleane and blested, he cured the lea∣prous, raised the dead, taught wisdome, the Testament, and the Gospell. The vnbelee∣uing Israelites beleeued that he was a Magician. And 34. We haue giuen a good place and abounding with water to the Sonne of Mary, and to her, for hauing done such miracles in the world. Worship one God alone. Sentences. Honor thy father and mother, and doe them good. Giue them no bad word when they are old. Be subiect with al humility, and pray God to pardon them. Giue to the poore and to your kindred, but not superfluously: for they that doe superflously are of kinne to the diuell. Slay not your children for no cause. Be yee not fornicators; for that is wickednes, and a bad way. Be reuenged on murtherers. Say nothing till ye know it; for you must giue account of your saying. 26. in disputing or reasoning vse only good words. Answere in honest sort to him which asketh thee. 27. Be iust in weight and measure. 37. The diuell standeth ouer the makers of songs and lies, that is, the Poets, if they amend not, doing good. 68. If you cannot giue, be daily in prayers. Pay your tithes, following God and the Prophet. They which do not good but for vaine-glory and ostentation, shall be damned. 118. The histories which are in the old Testament, are so cited by him, as if he neuer had read them, so many dreames and lies are inserted. Before Prayer wash the face, the hands, the armes vp to the elbow, the feete vp to the ankles; and after carnall company wash in the Bath: and if water cannot be had, with dust of cleane earth. Prayer. God desireth cleannesse. 9. In prayer let them be sober, that they may know what they say. 2. God will not aske why men pray not toward the East, for the East and West is his; but will demand of the workes which they haue done, of their almes, pilgrimages, and prayers. He commandeth that they be hum∣ble in prayer, and that in prayer they turne towards Mecca. Euery one which shall pray, asking that which is good, which way soeuer he shall turne him, shall be heard of God: although the true manner of praying be toward the center of the Temple of Mecca. They which are good, make their prayers to helpe them by their patience and abstinence. God dwelleth in such men. Pray according to the vsuall custome in all places, the footman on foot, the horseman on his horse. He that giueth his owne for Gods sake, is like a graine that hath seuen eares, eue∣rie of which containeth an hundred graines. Almes. Good men lose not your almes by vain∣glorie. 4. Giue almes of the good gaines of your money, and of that which the earth produceth; but God respecteth not gifts of that which is vniustly gotten. Satan per∣swadeth you to giue nothing for feare of pouertie. To giue almes publikely is good, but to giue priuately is better: and this blotteth out sinnes. Giue specially to those which stay in one place, and are ashamed to aske. 6. God will giue Paradise to them which in time of famine and scarfitie giue liberally, and which receiue iniuries, and re∣pent of their sinnes. The Creator said, I am the onely Creator, alwaies the same, pitifull, mercifull, besides whom there is none other; whose miracles and great workes are vnto the wise the frame of heauen and earth, the intercourse of night and day, the shippes in the sea fit for the vse of men, raine for the refreshing of the earth, the composition of
all creatures, the windes, the clouds, &c. 15. inuoke and worship one GOD alone; 43. God. All the miracles of GOD cannot be written, if all the trees in the world were pens, and the sea seuen times greater, and were inke; with whom it is a small thing to raise the dead. They which are intreated to beleeue the Diuine Precepts, say, they will follow their ancestors in their sect. Tradition. What would yee follow your fathers if they were blinde or deafe? Will ye be like them in being mute, blind, and foolish? O good men, eat that good which he hath giuen you, & giue him thankes; aboue all other things calling vpō him. Meates. Abstaine from that which dieth of it selfe, from swines flesh, from bloud, and from euery other creature that is killed, and not in the name of the Creator. But in case of necessitie it is not sinne; for GOD is mercifull, and will for∣giue you this. 12. Eat not of that which is drowned, burned in the fire, and touched of a Wolfe. 16. Eat nothing which hath not before beene blessed. To the Iewes we made many things vnlawfull, because of their wickednesse. 2. Hee which shall contradict this booke, shall continually bee consumed in vnquenchable fire, and none of his workes shall helpe him. Euery one which draweth nigh to death, let him leaue of his money to his fami∣ly and kindred to distribute in almes, and they which shall change that vse, shall be iudged of the Creator, &c. Death. We enioyne vnto you (as to your predecessors) fasting in the time thereto ap∣pointed, and in a certaine number of daies, that is, in the moneth Romadan, in which, this booke (which discerneth betweene good and euill) was sent you from hea∣uen. Fasting and Pilgrimage. Euery one must obserue it, but the sicke and traueller, and let them doe the same in the remainder of the time. The rich vse of satisfie their fasting with almes; let them do both the one and the other. He permitteth you the vse of your wiues in the night, because it is hard and impossible to abstaine. But let none vse their company in the Temples. Fast all the day, and when night is come, eate and drinke as much as you please, till the morning. By the Moone is knowne the time of Pilgrimages, and of fa∣stings, whereby is knowne that you loue and feare GOD. Spend your money in the loue of GOD in Pilgrimage, not despairing. He that is impotent, and that is not ac∣companied of his wife in the pilgrimage, must fast three daies in the voyage, and seuen after his returne. To the sicke, fasting with almes is sufficient. They which purpose this pilgrimage, let them not giue their minds to any euill. Let them not be ashamed to aske necessaries. 2. Hold it for iust and good to enter the house at the doore, not at the side, or back-side thereof. 35. Salute those which ye meet, when ye enter into the house. To them that doubt of wine, of chesse, scailes, and of tables, thou shalt say that such sports, and such drinkes are a great sinne, and although they be pleasant or profi∣table yet are they hurtfull sinnes: if they say what shall we then doe, thou shalt say, The good things of God. Drinkes and Games. Perswade them to seeke the Orphanes, and succour them, as their brethren, or else God will make them so poore, that they shall not be able to helpe either themselues or others. 13. Wine, chesse, and tables are not lawfull, but the diuels inuentions, to made debate amongst men, and to keep them from doing good. Let none go on hunting in the pilgrimage month. Take not a wife of another law, nor giue your daughters to men of another law, except they before conuert to your law. Women. Let no man touch a woman in her disease, before she be well cleansed. Vse your wiues, and the women which are subiect to you, where and how you please. Women which are diuorced, may not marry till after foure moneths, hauing had three times their menstruous purgation. Let them not de∣ny their husbands their company at their pleasure. They are the heads of the women. After a third diuorce from one man, they may not marry the same man againe, except they haue in the meane time beene married to another, and be of him diuorced. Let the women nurse their children two yeares, recoiuing necessaries of the fathers. After buriall of a husband, let them stay vnmarried foure moneths, and ten daies; and not go out of the house in a yeare after. Take ye two, three, foure wiues, & finally as many
as in your minde you are content to maintaine and keepe in peace. It is vnlawfull to marrie with the mother, daughter, sister, aunt, neece, nurse, or the mother or daughter of the nurse; and take not a whore to wife. 9. Let the wiues keepe their husbands secrets, or else let them be chastised, and kept in house and bed, till they be better. 10. Let the husband seeke to liue peaceably with his wife. 31. Cast not thine eyes on other mens wiues, though they be faire, &c. Sweare not in all your affaires by GOD and his names. Swearing. They which forsweare themselues shall haue no good thing in the world to come. And 35. Sweare not rash∣ly, for GOD seeth euerything. We giuing our soule to CHRIST the Sonne of Marie, preferred him before all others, that had beene exalted by me, to speake with GOD, to power and vertue. Christ. He inserteth the prayer of the Virgins mother, when she felt her selfe with child, by Ioachim: and maketh Zacharie to be the Virgins Tutor. 5. Who (he saith) for his vn∣beleefe was dumbe three dayes. The Angels saluted Marie, saying, O thou the pu∣rest of all women and men, deuoted to GOD, Ioy vnto thee of that great Messenger, with the word of GOD, whose name is IESVS CRHIST, an excellent man, at the command of the Creator: he shall come with Diuine power, with knowledge of all learning, with the booke of the Law and Gospell; shall giue Commandements to the Israelites: shall giue life; cure diseases; shew what is to be eaten, and to be done; shall confirme the old Testament; shall make some things lawfull, which before were vnlawfull, &c. He acknowledgeth that his mother knew not man. 11. They say (the Iewes) that they killed CHRIST, the Sonne of Mary, the Messenger of God, but it was not true, but they crucified in his stead another like him; for the incomprehensi∣ble God caused him to goe vnto him. IESVS is the Spirit, and Word, and Messen∣ger of God, sent from heauen. 11. Offer violence to no man in respect of the Law, for the way of doing good and euill is open. Forcing to beleeue. 4. God gaue first the Testament, then the Gospell, and lastly the true Booke, the Alfurcan of your Law, in confirmation of those former. They which liue of vsurie shall not rise againe otherwise then the Diuels: they embrace that which God hath said is vnlawfull: but they say vsurie is as merchan∣dize. Vsurie. Yee which are good feare God, and forsake vsurie, left the anger of God, and of the Prophet, assaile you. Take onely the principall; and if he cannot pay you, stay till he can, and giue him almes; for this shall be better for you. He which repenteth him, and leaueth his sinne, obtaineth pardon, and the can∣celling of that which is past; but returning againe thereto, he shall suffer eternall fire. Repentance. In the 5. Vnto bad men is denied humane and diuine mercie, except they repent. God careth little for the conuersion of them, which, after that of Infidels they are made be∣leeuers, become worse. Such shall suffer without any remission intollerable punish∣ment. 10. God pardoneth lesse faults, but not criminall. Let no man reckon him a good friend, which is an vnbeleeuer, except it be for feare. Friendship. If betwixt you there grow discord, laying aside all stomacke, doe the will of God, and become brethren together, imitating God, who hath deliuered you from the fire, and from dangers. 6. God would not that any should doe euill to those of his owne Nation, and those which consent to your Law, but rather their profit and commoditie. Thinke not that euer Paradise shall be open vnto you, if you be not first valiant and couragious in battaile: and before you enter into battaile, prepare your selues for death: and after the death of the Prophet Mahomet, defend the orders by him gi∣uen with armes. Infidels. No man can die, but when God will, that is, when his time is come. Those which flee out of the warre, are prouoked of the Diuell; but God pardoneth them which repent. They which die in the way of God, are not truely called dead: They liue with God. Let none feare them which are gouerned of the Diuell. 7. Be patient, and you shall haue eternall life. 10. Accompany not with vnbeleeuers, nei∣ther in friendship, nor other businesse. They which goe on war-fare for God and the Prophet, shall receiue abundance in the earth, and after death the mercie of God.
They which refuse (except they be sicke or children) shall be cast into hell. Neglect not prayers in your expeditions. Some may pray, whiles others stand in armes. Pray not for them which hurt their owne soules. 18. Looke to your selues that there be no discord amongst you. Thus haue I endeuoured to bring some order out of confusion, and haue framed these heads out of that Alcoran-Chaos Magdebur∣genses in Centu∣ria 7. haue also gathered some heads of this headlesse mon∣ster, which they that will may there reade. , where is scarce either head or taile: this tale they haue and beleeue (for what will not? what shall not they beleeue, which refuse to beleeue the Truth?) that hee which readeth this booke a thousand times in his life, shall haue a woman in Paradise, whose eye-browes shall be as large as the rayne∣bow. CHAP. V. Other Mahumeticall speculations, and explanations of their Law, collected out of their owne Commentaries, of that Argument. OF such writings as haue come to our hands touching Mahomets do∣ctrine and Religion, that seemeth most fully to lay them open, which is called by F Sansou. & Bell. lib.3. some, Scala; a booke containing the exposition of the Alcoran, in forme of a Dialogue, translated into Latine by Herman∣nus Dalmata, and made the twelfth Chapter of the first booke of the Alcoran in Italian. I haue therefore presumed on the Readers patience, to those former collections out of the Alcoran it selfe to adde these ensuing, as a further explanation of their opinions. The Messenger of GOD (so beginneth that booke) was sitting amongst his fellowes (the prayer and saluation of GOD be vpon him) in his City Iesrab; and the Angell Gabriel descending on him, said, GOD salu∣teth thee, O Mahomet, &c. There come foure wise-men, Masters in Israel, to proue thee; the chiefe of whom is Abdia-ben-Salon. Mahomet therefore sent his cousin Hali to salute them; and they being come to Mahomet, after mutuall salutations, Abdia tel∣leth him, that he and his fellowes were sent by the people of the Iewes to learne the vnderstanding of some obscurer places of their law. Mahomet asketh, if he come to enquire, or to tempt. Abdia saith, to enquire. Then Mahomet giuing him full leaue, he beginneth; hauing before gathered out of the whole bodie of their Law an hun∣dred most exquisite questions. The principall dregges you shall heere haue. Abdia. Tell vs (O Mahomet) whether thou be a Prophet or a Messenger? Ma∣homet. GOD hath appointed me both a Prophet and a Messenger. Ab. Doest thou preaoh the Law of GOD, or thine owne Law? Mah. The Law of GOD: this Law is faith, and this faith is, that there are not Gods, but one God, without partaker. Ab. How many lawes of God are there? Mah. One, the law, and faith of the Prophets, which went before vs, was one; the rites were different. Ab. Shall we enter Para∣dise for faith or workes? Mah. Both are necessarie; but if a Gentile, Iew, or Christi∣an, become a Saracen, and preuent his good workes, Faith onely shall suffice: But if Gentile, Iew, or Christian, doe good workes, not in the loue of God, the fire shall consume both him and his worke. Ab. How doth the mercie of God preuent his anger? Mah. When before other creatures Adam rose vp, he sneesed and said, God be thanked: and the Angels hearing it, said The Pitie of God be vpon thee, Adam, who answered Amen: Then said the Lord, I haue receiued your prayer. Ab. What be the foure things which God wrought with his owne hands? Mah. He made Paradise, planted the tree of the trumpet, formed Adam, and did write the Tables of Mo∣ses. Ab. Who told thee this? Mah. Gabriel from the Lord of the world. Ab. In what forme? Mah. Of a man standing vpright, neuer sleeping, nor eating, nor drinking, but the praise of God. Ab. Tell me in order what is one, what is two, what three, foure, fiue, sixe, &c. to a hundreth. Mah. One is God without Sonne, par∣taker
or fellow, almightie Lord of life and death. Two, Adam and Eue. Three, Michael, Gabriel, Saraphiel, Archangels Secretaries of God. Foure, The Law of Moses, the Psalmes of Dauid, the Gospell, and Alfurcan (so called of the distincti∣on of the sentences). Fiue: The prayers which God gaue me and my people, and to none of the other Prophets. Sixe, The dayes of Creation. Seuen, Heauens. Eight, Angels which sustaine the throne of GOD. Nine, Are the miracles of Moses. Ten, Are the fasting-dayes of the Pilgrimes: three, when they goe, seuen, in their returne. Eleuen are the Starres whereof Ioseph dreamed. Twelue inoneths in the yeare; thir∣teene is the Sunne and Moone, with the eleuen Starres. Fourteene candles hang about the throne of GOD, of the length of fiue hundred yeares. Fifteene, the fifteenth day of Ramadam, in which the Alcoran came sliding from heauen. Sixteene, are the legi∣ons of the Cherubims. Seuenteene, are the names of GOD betweene the bottome of the earth and hell, which stay those flames, which els would consume the world. Eigh∣teene, Interpositions there be betweene the throne of GOD, and the aire; for else the brightnes of GOD would blinde the world. Nineteene, Be the armes or branches of Zachia, a riuer in hell, which shall make a great noise in the day of Iudgement. Twen∣ty, The day of the month Ramadam, when the Psalmes descended on Dauid The one and twentieth of Ramadam, Salomon was borne. The two and twentieth, Dauid was pardoned the sin against Vriah. The three and twentieth of Ramadam, CHRIST the Son of Mary was borne; the prayers of GOD be vpon him. The foure and twentieth, GOD spake to Moses. The fiue and twentieth, the sea was diuided. The six & twentieth, He receiued the Tables. The seuen and twentieth, Iouas was swallowed of the Whale. The eight and twentieth, Iacob recouered his sight, when Iudas brought Iosephs coat. The nine and twentieth, Was Enoch translated. The thirtieth, Moses went into mount Sinai. A. Make short worke, for thou dost all things exactly. M. Forty are the daies of Moses his fasting. Fifty thousand yeares shall the day of Iudgement continue. Sixty are the veines, which euery of the heauens haue in the earth, without which varietie there would be no knowledge amongst men. Seuenty men Moses tooke to himselfe. Eighty stripes are due to a drunken man. Ninety, The Angell said to Dauid, This my fellow hath ninety sheepe, and I but one, which he hath stollen from me. An hundred stripes are due to the adulterer. A. Well, shew vs how the earth was made, and when. M. God made man of mire: the mire, of froth: this was made of the tempests; these, of the sea: The sea, of darknes; the darknes, of light; this, of the word; the word, of the thought; the thought, of Ia∣cinth; the Iacinth, of the commandement: Let it be, and it was. A. How many Angels are set ouer men? M. Two, one on the right hand, which writeth his good deeds; an∣other on the left, which registreth his bad. These sit on mens shoulders. Their pen is their tongue, their inke is their spittle, their heart is the booke. A. What did God make after? M. The bookes wherein are written all things, past, present, and to come, in hea∣uen and earth; and the pen made of the brightest light, fiue hundred yeares long, and eightie broad, hauing eightie teeth, wherein are written all things in the world, till the day of Iudgement. The booke is made of the greatest Emerald; the words, of pearles; the couer, of pitie. God ouer-looketh the same an hundred and sixtie times in a day and night. The heauen is made of smoake, of the vapour of the sea: the greenenesse of the sea proceedeth from the mount Kaf, which is made of the Emeralds of Paradise, and compasseth the world, bearing vp the heauens. The gates of heauen are of gold, the lockes of light, the keyes of pietie. Aboue the heauens are the sea of life, aboue that the cloudie sea; then the ayrie sea, the stonie sea, the darke sea, the sea of so∣lace, the Moone, the Sunne, the name of God, Supplication, Gabriel, the parch∣ment rased, the parchment full written, all these in order one ouer another. Then, aboue all these, the threescore and ten spaces of light: then threescore and ten thou∣sand hilles, with threescore and ten thousand spaces betweene, and threescore and ten thousand troups of Angels on them, in euery troupe fiue thousand Angels alway prai∣sing the Lord of the world: aboue these the limits or bounds of Angelicall dignitie: and aboue the same the banner of glorie, and then spaces of pearles, and in their orders
one aboue another, the spaces of Grace, of Power, of Diuinitie, of dispensation, the foot-stoole, the throne, the house of the vniuerse. A. Are the Sunne and Moone faithfull or not? M. They are faithfull, and obey e∣uery command of GOD. A. Why then are they not of equall light? M. GOD crea∣ted them equall, but by this it came to passe, that the vicissitude or intercourse of day and night was vnceriaine, till Gabriel flying by the Moone, darkened her with the touch of his wing. A. How many orders are there of the Starres? M. Three, the first of those which hang by chaines from the throne of GOD, giuing light to the seuenth throne: the second chase away the diuels, when they would enter into heauen: the third in the sight of the Angels. There are seuen seas betweene vs and heauen. There are three windes: the first barren; the second tempestuous, which shall blow the fire in the day of Iudgement: the third ministreth to the earth and sea. A. Where is the Sun? M. In a hot fountaine: this, in a Serpent, which is a great space in the mount Kaf, and this Kaf is in the hand of the Angell, which holdeth the world till the day of Iudge∣ment. Abd. What is the manner of them, which beare vp the seat of GOD? Mah. Their heads are vnder the seat of GOD, their feet vnder the seuen thrones, their neckes are so large, that a bird in a thousand yeares continuall flight could not reach from the one eare to the other. They haue hornes, and their meate and drinke is the prayse and glorie of GOD. Abd. How farre is it to heauen? Mahom. Fiue hun∣dred yeares iourney to the lowest, and so from each to other. Abd. What birdes are betweene vs and heauen? Mahom. Some which touch neither heauen nor earth, ha∣uing manes like horses, haire like women, wings like birds, and lay their egges and hatch them on their tailes till the day of Iudgement. Abd. What was the forbidden tree? Mahom. Of wheate, which had seuen eares, whereof Adam plucked one wherein were fiue graines; of which, two he eate, two he gaue to Eue, and one he carried away. This graine was bigger then an egge, and being bruised, brought forth all kindes of seede. Abd. Where was Adam receiued after his expulsion from Paradise? Mahom. Adam in India, Eue in Nubia. Adam was couered with three leaues of Paradise; Eue, with her haire: They met together in Arafe. Further, as concerning Eue, shee was made of a ribbe of the left side, for o∣therwise shee had beene as strong as the man. Abd. Who dwelt in the earth before? Mahom. First the Diuels, seuen thousand yeares after them the Angels: lastly Adam, a thousand yeares after the Angels. Ab. Who beganne the Pilgrimage. Mahom. Adam. Gabriel shaued his head, and hee circumcised himselfe; and after him Abraham. Abd. To what Land spake GOD at any time? Mahom. To mount Sinai, that it should lift vp Moses to heauen: A∣bitabil and Moses are the two men, whose sepulchres are not knowne. Moses by chance found a sepulchre, which while hee measured with his bodie, the Angell of Death drew from him his soule out of his nostrills, by the smell of an apple of Pa∣radise. Ab. Where is the middle of the earth? Mahom. In Ierusalem. A. Who made the first shippe? Mahom. Noe: he receiued the keyes thereof of Gabriel, and go∣ing forth of Arabia, compassed Mecca seuen times, and likewise Ierusalem. In the meane while Mecca was receiued vp into heauen, and the mount Abikobez preser∣ued Ierusalem in her belly. A. What shall become of the children of the Infidels. M. They shall come in at the day of Iudgement, and God shall say vnto them, would ye do that thing which shall be commanded you? And hee shall command to flow forth one of the riuers of hell, and bid them leape into the same. They which obey, shal goe into Paradise. This shall be the triall of the children of the faithfull also, which are borne deafe, blinde, &c. Abd. What resteth vnder these seuen earths? Mahom. An Oxe, whose feete are on a white stone, his head in the East, his taile in the West; hee hath fortie hornes, and as many teeth; it is a thousand yeares iour∣ney from one horne to another. Vnder that stone is Zohet, a mountaine of hell, of a thousand yeares iourney. All the Insidels shall ascend vpon the same, and from the toppe shall fall into hell. Vnder that Mount is the land Werelea; vnder that, the sea Alkasem: the land
Aliolen, the Sea Zere: the Land Neama, the Sea Zegir: the Land Theris, the Land Agiba white as Milke, sweete as Muske, soft as Saffron, bright as the Moone: the Sea Alknitar; the Fish Albehbut, with his head in the East, his taile in the West: all these in order one after another. And beneath all these in like infernall order the Winde, the Mountaine, the Thunder, the Lightening, the bloudie Sea, Hell closed, the fierie Sea, the darke Sea, the Sea Po, the cloudie Sea, Prayses, Glorifications, the Throne, the Booke, the Penne, the greater name of GOD. Abd. What hath come out of Paradise into the World? Mahom. Mecca, Ies∣rab, Ierusalem: as on the contrarie, out of Hell; Vastat in Egypt, Antiochia in Syria, Ebheran in Armenia, and Elmeden of Chaldaea. Abd. What say you of Paradise? Mahom. The ground of Paradise is of gold, enameled with Emeralds, and Hiacinths, planted with euery fruitfull tree, watered with streames of milke, hony, and wine: the day is of a thousand yeares continuance, and the yeare of fortie thousand yeares. The people shall haue whatsoeuer can be desired, they shall be clothed in all colours, ex∣cept The Turkes reckon Greene the Prophets colour. blacke, which is the proper colour of Mahomet: they all shall be of the stature of Adam, in resemblance like CHRIST, neuer increasing or diminishing. As soone as they are entered, shall be set before them the liuer of the Fish Albehbut, and what∣soeuer dainties they can desire. They shall not need going to stoole any more then the childe in the wombe, but they shall sweate out all superfluities, of sent like muske. They shall eate but for delight, not for hunger. Vnlawfull meats, as Swines flesh, they shall refraine. And if you list to know why this beast is vncleane, vnderstand that IESVS on a time called forth Iaphet to tell his Disciples the historie of the Arke; Who told them, that by the weight of the ordure, the Arke leaned on the one side, whereupon Noe, consulting with GOD, was bidden bring the Elephant thither, out of whose dung, mixed with mans, came forth a Hogge, which wrooted in that mire with his snout, and by the stincke thereof was produced out of his nose a mouse, which gnawed the boords of the Arke: Noe fearing this danger, was bidden to strike the Lion on the forehead: and by the Lions breath was a Cat en∣gendred, mortall enemie to the Mouse. But to returne from this stinking tale, to refresh our selues with the like sweetes of this Paradise. Hee addeth, that there they haue the wiues that heere they had, and other concubines, whom, how, when, where∣soeuer they will. Abd. But why is wine lawfull there, and heere vnlawfull? Mahom. The An∣gels Aròt, and Marot, were sometime sent to instruct and gouerne the world, for∣bidding men wine, iniustice, and murther. But a woman hauing whereof to accuse her husband inuited them to dinner, and made them drunke. They, inflamed with a double heate of wine and lust, could not obtaine that their desire of their faire Ho∣stesse, except one would teach her the word of ascending to heauen, and the other of descending. Thus shee mounted vp to heauen. And vpon enquirie of the mat∣ter, shee was made the Morning-starre, and they put to their choice whether they would be punished in this world or in the world to come: they accepting their pu∣nishment in this, are hanged by chaines, with their heads in a pit of Babel, till the day of Iudgement. Hell, saith Mahomet there, hath the floore of Brimstone, smokie, Pitchie, with stinking flames, with deepe pits of scalding pitch, and sulphurous flames, wherein the damned are punished daily: the trees beare most loathsome fruits, which they eate. The day of Iudgement shall be in this sort. In that day GOD will command the Angell of Death to kill euerie Creature; which being done, hee shall aske him if nothing bee aliue: Adreiel the Angell of Death shall answere, Nothing but myselfe. Then goe thy wayes betwixt Paradise and Hell, and last of all kill thy selfe. Thus he, foulded in his wings, prostrate on the earth, shall strangle him∣selfe with such a bellowing noise, as would terrifie the very Angels, if they were aliue.
Thus the World shall be emptie fortie yeares. Then shall GOD hold the Heauen and Earth in his fist, and say, where are now the mightie men, the Kings and Princes of the World? Tell me (if ye be true) whose is the Kingdome, and Empire, and Power? Re∣peating these words three times, he shall rayse vp Seraphiel, and say, Take this Trum∣pet, and goe to Ierusalem, and found. This Trumpet is of fiue hundred yeares iour∣ney. At that sound all Soules shall come forth, and disperse themselues vnto their owne bodies, and their bones shall be gathered together. Fortie yeares after hee shall sound againe, and then the bones shall resume flesh and sinewes. After fortie yeares the third sound shall warne the Soules to re-possesse their bodies: and a fire from the West shall driue euery creature to Ierusalem. When they haue here swumme fortie yeares in their owne sweat, they shall, with much vexation, come to Adam, and say, Father Adam, Father Adam, Why hast thou begotten vs to these miseries and torments? Why sufferest thou vs to hang betweene hope and feare? Pray to God, that he will finish his determination of vs betweene Paradise and Hell: A∣dam shall excuse his vnworthinesse for his disobedience, and send them to Noe, Noe will post them to Abraham, Abraham to Moyses: He shall send them to IESVS CHRIST: To him they shall come and say, The Spirit, Word, and Power of God, let thy pitie moue thee to make intercession for vs. Hee shall answere them, That which you aske, you haue lost. I was indeed sent vnto you in the power of God, and word of Truth, but yee haue erred, and haue made me God; more then euer I prea∣ched to you: and haue therefore lost my benefit. But goe to the last of the Prophets, meaning him with whome thou now talkest, Abdia. Then shall they turne to him, and say; O faithfull Messenger, and friend of God, wee haue sinned, heare vs holy Prophet, our onely hope, &c. Then shall Gabriel present himselfe to helpe his friend, and they shall goe to the Throne of God. And God shall say, I know why you are come, Farre be it that I should not heare the prayer of my faithfull one. Then shall a Bridge be made ouer Hell, and on the top of the Bridge shall be set a ballance, where∣in euery mans workes shall be weighed, and those which are saued, shall passe ouer the Bridge, the other shall fall into Hell. A. How many bands of men shall there be in that day. M. An hundred and twentie; of which three onely shall be found faithfull: and euery Band or Troupe of men shall be in length the iourney of a thou∣sand yeares, in breadth fiue hundred. A. What shall become of Death? M. Hee shall be transformed into a Ramme, and they shall bring him betweene Paradise and Hell. Then shall arise much dissention betweene these two peoples, through feare of the one, and hope of the other. But the people of Paradise shall preuaile, and shall slay Death betweene Paradise and Hell. Abdia. Thou, O Mahomet, hast ouer∣come, and I beleeue, that there is but one God Almightie, and thou art his Messenger and Prophet. In this long and tedious Summarie of that longer and more tedious Dialogue, compared with the former Iewish opinions, touching their Behemoth, Leuiathan, Ziz, Ierusalem, Swines flesh, the Angell of Death, and other their superstitious opinions, it may appeare, that the Iewes were forward Mint-masters in this new-coyned Reli∣gion of Mahomet. In the beginning of this Dialogue are mentioned their fiue Prayers and their Ra∣madam, or Ramazan: Of which, that Arabian Nobleman, in confutation of the Al∣coran, writeth thus: Arab. Nob. in Confut. Alcor. He which hath fulfilled these fiue Prayers, shall be praysed in this world, and the next. They are as follow: two kneelings in the morning, af∣ter noone foure; at Vespers, or a little before Sunne-set, foure; after Sunne-set, foure; at their beginning of supper, two; and after supper, when it is darke, two; in all eigh∣teene kneelings in a day. Their Lent Of Maho∣mets Lent. , or Fast of the Moneth Ramazan, is thus: In the day time they must fast from Meate, Drinke, and Venerie, till the Sunne be downe: then is Riot permitted them, till a white thread may be discerned from a blacke. But if any bee sicke, or in iourneying, hee may pay at another time the same number of dayes.
Frier Richard Richardus confut. Alcor. reciteth among Mahomets opinions, That of threescore and thir∣teene parts of the Saracens, one onely shall be saued; and, that the Deuils shall once be saued by the Alcoran; and that they call themselues Saracens; fit companions with them in their holy things. Some Pietro Messia tradoito per F. Sanso vino, l.4. c.1. make it a Canon of Mahomets, That they should looke toward the South when they pray, that when they pray they should say, GOD is one GOD, without equall, and Mahomet his Prophet: which, Lod.Barthema saith, are the Characters of the profession of a Mahumetan, and that, by the pronouncing of those words, he was tryed whether he was an Infidell, or no. These words, saith the abouesaid Arabian (as they affirme) before the beginning of the world were written in the Throne of GOD. One saith Constantin. Porphyrogenit. de admin. Imp. cap.15. , That the Saracens adore the starre of Uenus, and in their praying cry, Alla oua cubar Euthymius calleth it : Cedrenus more fully, Alla, alla, on a Curbar, alla. , that is, GOD, and Venus. Ioannes Meursius noteth thereon, That they worshipped the Image of Venus, set on a great stone, on which they beleeue, that Abraham lay with Hagar, or else that he tied his Camell thereunto while he was sacri∣ficing Isaac. Anonymus in Saracen. Bellonius Bell. obseru. lib.3.cap.9. in his obseruations telleth out of their Bookes, That there is a Tree in Pa∣radise which shadoweth it all ouer, and spreades her boughes ouer the walls, whose leaues are of pure gold and siluer, each of them, after the Name of GOD, hauing there∣in written the name of Mahomet. And that if a Christian, at vnawares, should pro∣nounce the said prayer, Laillah &c. GOD is one GOD, and Mahomet his Prophet, he must either die or turne Turke. Such reputation haue they of this forme, which they call a Prayer, with as good reason as the Aue Marie among the Romists, wherein yet they pray not for any thing. Bellonius also saith, That they hold the Heauen to be made of Smoake, and the Firmament stablished on the horne of a Buffall, by whose stirring Earthquakes are caused: That there are seuen Paradises, with Houses, Gardens, Foun∣taines, and whatsoeuer sense accounteth delectable; where they shall enioy all delights without any sorrow, hauing Carpets, Beds, Boyes, Horses, Saddles, Garments, for cost and workmanship most curious, & readie for attendance. Those boyes richly adorned, when they haue satisfied their hunger and thirst, shall present euery Saracen a huge Pome-citron in a golden Charger, and as soone as they shall smell thereof, there shall thence proceed a comely virgin in gallant attire, which shall embrace him, and he her; and so shall they continue fiftie yeares. After which space ended, God shall shew them his face, where at they shall fall downe, not able to endure the brightnesse: but he shall say, Arise my seruants, and enioy my glorie; for hereafter yee shall neuer die, nor be grieued. Then shall they see God, and each lead his virgin into his chamber, where all pleasures shall attend them. If one of those virgins should come forth at midnight, she would lighten the world no lesse then the Sunne; and if she should spit into the Sea, all the water thereof would become sweet. Gabriel keepes the keyes of Paradise, which are in number threescore and tenne thousand, each seuen thousand miles long. But he was not able to open Paradise without inuocation of the Name of God, and Mahomet his friend. There is a Table of Adamant seuen hundred thousand daies iourney long and broad, with Seats of Gold and Siluer about it, where they shall be feasted. CHAP. VI. Of the Pilgrimage to Mecca. WE haue heard of the antiquitie of this Pilgrimage in the former chapter, deriued from Adam, who was shauen & circumcised for that purpose: & the Alcoran nameth Abraham the founder of the Temple &c. Pitie it were, that the last of the Prophets should not honour that which was first instituted by the first of men. If we will rather beleeue that Arabian before mentioned, we shall finde another originall, namely, that whereas two Nations of the Indians, called Zechian & Albarachuma, had vsed to go about their Idols naked and shauen, with great howlings, kissing the corners, and casting stones vpon an heape
which was heaped vp in honour of their Gods, and that twice euery yeare, in the Spring, and in Autumne: the Arabians had learned the same of the Indians, and practised the same at Mecca, in honour of Venus (casting stones backe betweene their legges, the parts of Venus) in the time of Mahomet. Neither did Mahomet a∣brogate this, as he did other idolatrous Rites; onely for modesties sake they were en∣ioyned to gird a piece of Linnen about their Reines. Mecca, or (as they call it) Macca, signifying an Habitation, containeth in it about sixe thousand houses, fairely built, like those of Italie: Other walls it hath not, then such as Nature hath enuironed it with, namely, with high and barren Mountaines round about. Some Pilgrimage to Mecca, M. Hak. t.2. report, That betweene the Mountaines and the Citie are plea∣sant Gardens, abundant of Figges, Grapes, Apples, Melons, and that there is store also of Flesh and Water. But it seemeth, that this is of later industrie, not of Natures in∣dulgence, if it be true. For Lod. Barthema Vertoman; l.1.c.14. , or Vertoman, being there in the yeare 1503, sayth, That the place was accursed of GOD, as not bringing forth Hearbes, Trees, Fruits, or any thing, and besides, hauing great scarcitie of water, and is serued with these things from other places. It is gouerned by a King (tributarie, then to the Soldan, now to the Turke) called the Seriffo, lineally descended from their great Seducer, by his daughter Fatma (the onely issue of this libidinous poligamous Pro∣phet) married to Hali. All of this kindred are called Emyri, that is, Lords, clothed with (or at least wearing Turbants of) greene, which colour the Mahumetans will not suffer other men to weare. The number of Pilgrimes which resort hither, is incredible. From Cairo commeth a Carovan of deuotion, some to Mammon, some to Mahomet, either for trade of Merchandise, or for Superstition, and another yearely from Damascus: besides those which come from the Indies, Aethiopia, Arabia, Persia, &c. Lud. Barthema sayth, That (at his being at Mecca) of the Carovan of Damasco, wherein he went, were fiue and thirtie thousand Camels, and about fortie thousand persons: of that of Cairo were threescore and foure thousand Camels, and now in these times about fortie thousand Camels, Mules, and Dromedaries, and fiftie thousand persons, besides the Arabian Ca∣rovan, and of other Nations. This Mart of Mecca is much impaired, since the Portugales haue intercepted the Indian commodities, which by a Carovan, from thence, were wont to be brought hithen. Let me desire the Reader to haue patience, and goe along, on this Pilgrimage, with one of these Carovans, through these Arabian Deserts to Mecca and Medina: and because that of Gairo is the chiefe, we will bestow our selues in it, and obserue what Rites they obserue before they set forth; what by the way, and at the intended places of their deuotion. Alcor.Italic. Touching the necessitie whereof; they thinke, That they which goe not once in their liues, shall, after death, goe to the Deuill. Yea, some, for deuotion, plucke out their eyes after so holy a sight. The moneth Ramazan (as you haue heard) is their Lent; falling sometime high, sometime low, being that whole moneth, during which time the Pilgrims and Mer∣chants resort to Cairo from Asia, Greece, Barbarie, &c. After their Pilgrimage to Mecca, Has Lent ended, they obserue their Easter, or Feast, called Bairam, three dayes. Twentie dayes after this Feast, the Carovan is readie to depart. Against this time, they assemble them∣selues at a place, two leagues from Cairo (called Birca) attending the comming of the Captaine. This Captaine of the Carovan, whome they call Amarilla Haggi, is re∣newed euery third yeare; and to him the Grand Signior, euery voyage, giueth eigh∣teene Purses (each containing sixe hundred twentie fiue duckats of Gold) for the be∣hoofe of the Carovan, and also to doe almes vnto needfull Pilgrims. He hath foure Chausi to serue him, and foure hundred souldiors, two hundred Spachi, mounted on Dromedaries, and as many Ianizaries, riding on Camels. The Chausi and Spachi the Captaine maintaineth at his owne charges: The Ianizaries haue their prouision from Cairo, He hath eight Pilots for guides; which Office is hereditarie.
They carrie fiue pieces of Ordinance, to terrifie the Arabians, and to triumph at Mec∣ca. The merchandise that goeth by land, payeth no custome; that which goeth by sea, payeth tenne in the hundred. At the Feast, before the Carovan setteth forth, the Captaine, with his Retinue and Officers, resort vnto the Castle of Cairo, before the Basha, which giueth vnto euery man a Garment, and that of the Captaine is wrought with gold, the others according to their degree. Moreouer, he deliuereth vnto him the Chisva Tunabi, or Garment of the Prophet; a vesture of Silke, wrought with these letters of Gold, Lailla ill alla Mahumet Resullala; that is, There are no Gods, but GOD, and Mahomet is the Messenger of GOD. After this, he deliuereth to him a Gate, wrought curiously with Gold; and a Couering of greene Veluet, made in man∣ner of a Pyramis, about nine palmes high, wrought with fine Gold, to couer the Tombe of the Prophet Mahomet, and many other Couerings besides of Gold and Silke, to adorne it. The two former are for the House of Abraham in Mecca. Then the Captaine hauing taken his leaue, departeth, accompanied with all the people of Cairo, in manner of a Procession, with singing, shouting, and a thousand Ceremonies besides, and passing the Gate Bab-Nassera, layeth vp, in a Mosquita, the said Vestures very safely. This Ceremonie is performed with such publike resort, that it is not lawfull for any man to forbid his wife the going to this Feast: for shee may, vpon such a cause, separate her selfe from her husband, and lye with another man. The Camels, which carrie the Vestures, being adorned with Cloth of Gold, and many little Bells, the multitude stroweth flowers and sweet water on them; others with fine Cloth and Towels touch the same, reseruing these for Reliques. Twentie dayes af∣ter this Feast, the Captaine, taking the Vestures out of that Mosquita, repaireth to Birca, where his Tent abideth some tenne dayes. In this time, they which meane to follow the Carovan, resort thither, and amongst them, many women, attyred with Trifles, Tassels, and Knottes, accompanied with their friends, mounted on Camels. The night before their departure, they make great feasting and triumph, with dis∣charging their Ordinance, Fire-workes, &c. shouting, till, at the breake of day, vp∣on the found of a Trumpet, they march forward on their way. From Cairo to Mecca is fortie dayes iourney, trauelling from two a clocke in the morning till the Sun ne-rising: and then hauing rested till noone, they set forward, so continuing till night:, obseruing this order, till the end of their Voyage, without change; except . Bar. with the Carovan of Damasco trauelled 22. houres of 24. at some places, where, in respect of water, they rest sometimes a day and a halfe, to refresh themselues. The Carovan is diuided into three parts: the fore-ward, the maine battaile, and the rete-ward. The fore-ward containeth about the third part of the people; and amongst these, the eight Pilots, a Chausi, and foure knaues, with Bulls sinewes, which punish offendors on the soles of their feet. In the night time they haue foure or fiue men goe before with Peeces of drie wood, which giue light: they follow the Starre, as the Mariners. Within a quarter of a myle fol∣loweth the maine Battaile, with their Ordinance, Gunners, and fifteene Archers, Spa∣chs. The chiefe Physician, with his Ointments and Medicines for the sicke, and Ca∣mels for them to ride on. Next goeth the fairest Camell that may be found in the Turkes dominion, decked with Cloth of Gold and Silke, and carrieth a little Chest, made of pure Legame, in forme of the Israelitish Arke, containing in it the Alcoran, all written with great letters of Gold, bound betweene two Tables of Massie Gold. This Chest is couered with Silke, during the voyage; but at their entring into Mecca and Medina it is couered with Cloth of Gold, adorned with Iewels. This Camell is compassed about with Arabian Singers and Musicians, singing alway, and playing vp∣on Instruments. After this follow fifteene other most faire Camels, euery one carrying one of the aboue said Vestures, being couered from top to toe with Silke. Behind these, goe the twentie Camels, which carrie the Captaines money and prouision. Af∣ter followeth the Standard of the Great Signior, accompanied with Musicians & soul∣diors, & behind these, lesse then a mile, followeth the rere-ward, the greatest part Pil∣grimes; the Merchants, for securitie, going before: for in this voyage it is needfull,
and vsuall, that the Captaine bestow Presents, Garments, and Turbants vpon the chiefe Arabians, to giue him free passage, receiuing sometimes, by pilferings, some damage notwithstanding. They passe by certaine weake Castles in the way, Agerut, Nachel, Acba, Biritem, betweene which two last is the Riuer of Ithro, and the Ponds of Midian, where Moses sate downe. At Iebhir, the first Towne subiect to the Seriffo of Mecca, they are receiued with much ioy, and well refreshed with the plentie which that place yeeldeth. They finde other filthie commodities also more then plentie, which fact (they hold) purgeth them from a multitude of sinnes, and encrea∣seth their deuotion to prosecute the voyage. The next day they goe towards Bedri∣honem, in which place groweth shrubbes, whereout issueth Baulme. Hereby they lodge one night, in memorie of a victorie here obtained against the Christians, at the earnest prayers of their Prophet, dreaming of Drummes, here still sounded by An∣gels, as they passe. The next morning, by Sunne-rising, they arriue at Bedrihonem, where euery one washeth himselfe from top to toe, couering their priuities with a cloth, and their shoulders with another white one; and they which can goe in this habite to Mecca, merite more; they which cannot, make a vow to offer a Ramme at the Mountaine of Pardons. After this washing, it is not lawfull for any man or woman to kill a Flea or Lowse with their hands or nayles, till they haue accomplished their Vowes at that Mountaine. This night they come within two myles of Mecca. The next morning they march on, and the Seriffo meeting them, resigneth his Gouernment to the Captaine, during his abode there: and the Captaine giueth him a garment of cloth of Gold, with other Iewels. After this, hauing eaten together vpon Carpets and Hides, they take with them the Gate and Garment abouesaid, and goe, attended but with few, to the Mos∣quita, and there cause the old to be pulled downe, and put the new couerture on the house of Abraham: and the old Vesture is the Eunuchs which serue in the said Mos∣quita, which sell it deere to the Pilgrimes, euery little piece being accounted a most holy Relique. And well may it be so, for (can you doubt of it?) putting the same vnder the head of a man at his death, all his sinnes must, by vertue hereof, be par∣doned. They take away the old dore, which is the Seriffo's fee, and set in place the new. Thus after some Orisons, the Captaine returneth to his pauilion, the Seriffo re∣maineth in the Citie. That you may be the better acquainted with this Mosquita, and house of Abra∣ham, you are to know, Description of the Mosqui∣ta at Mecca. that in the middest of the Citie is this great Mosquita, built (they say) in the time when their Prophet liued. It is foure-square, euery square halfe a mile, being in all the circuit two miles, in manner of a Cloyster: The Galleries round about are in manner of foure streets; these streets being separated from each other with Pillars, of Marble some, and some of Lime and Stone. In the middest of all, separate from the rest, is the house of Abraham. This Mosquita hath foure∣score and nineteene Gates and fiue Steeples, from whence the Talismans call the peo∣ple to their deuotion. And the Pilgrimes, which are not prouided of Tents, resort hi∣ther, men and women lying together; their House of Prayer becomming a denne of Theeues. Barthema sayth, That this Temple is round, like the Coliseo at Rome: That at euery entrance is a descent of tenne or twelue steppes, on both sides whereof stand Iewellers, which sell Gemmes onely. Within it is vaulted, gilded, and odori∣ferous; beyond what can be spoken: for there are foure or fiue hundred men which sell powders to preserue dead corpses, and other Sweetes. It seemeth, that since his time the Temple and House of Abraham are altered. This The house of Abraham de∣scribed. House is foure∣square, made of speckled stone, twentie paces high, and fortie in circuit. And vp∣on one side of this House, within the wall, there is a stone of a spanne long, and halfe a spanne broad, which stone (they say) fell downe from Heauen; a voice from Heauen, at the same fall, being heard, That wheresoeuer this stone fell, there should be built the House of GOD, wherein he will heare the prayers of sinners. Then was this Stone as white as Snow, but now, through the kisses of
sinners it is become so blacke as it is. The entrance into this House is small and high. There are without this House one and thirtie pillars of Brasse vpon square stones, su∣staining a thread of Copper, reaching from one to another, on which are fastened ma∣ny burning Lampes. The founder of these was Solyman. Being entred into this house through that difficult passage, there stand two pillars of Marble at the entrance: in the middest are three of Aloes-wood, couered with tyles of India, of a thousand colours, which serue to vnderprop the Terratza, or roofe. It is so darke, that they can hardly see within for want of light; nor is it without an euill smell. Without the gate fiue pa∣ces, is the Pond Zunzun; that blessed Pond which the Angell shewed to Agar for her sonne Ismael. Of their Feast Baraim is said alreadie: about sixe dayes after they be come hither to Mecca, they celebrate another Feast called Bine baraim, that is, the great Feast, which is also called, The Feast of the Ramme. In those dayes space they prepare themselues hereunto with due ceremonies. First, departing from the Carovan, gui∣ded with such as are skilfull in the way, they goe twentie or thirtie in a Companie, walking through a street, which ascendeth by little and little, till they come vnto a certaine gate, whereon is written in Marble, Babel Salema; that is, the gate of Health. And from this place is descried the great Mosquita, and twice saluted, saying, Peace to thee, Messenger of GOD. Then proceeding on their way, they finde an Arch on their right hand, whereon they ascend fiue steppes, vpon which is a great void place made of stoue: after descending other fiue steppes, and proceeding the space of a flight-shoot, they finde another Arch, like vnto the first; and this way, from the one Arch to the other, they goe and come seuen times, saying alwaies some of their pray∣ers, which they say the afflicted Hagar said, whiles she sought and found not water for her sonne. After this Ceremonie, they enter into the Mosquita; and drawing neere vnto the house of Abraham, they goe round about it other seuen times, al∣wayes saying. This is the House of GOD, and of his seruant Abraham. This done, they goe and kisse that blacke stone ahouesaid; and then goe they to the Pond Zun∣Zun, and in their apparrell, as they be, wash themselues from head to foot, saying, Tobah Allah, Tobah Allah, Pardon LORD, Pardon LORD; drinking also of that muddie vnsauourie water: and thus returne they, cleansed from all their sinnes. Euerie Pilgrime performeth these Ceremonies once at the least; the deuouter sort often. An hundred yeares since these Ceremonies were somewhat different, after Bar∣thema's Vertoman. lib.1.c.15. Relation. On the three and twentieth of May, the people (before day) com∣passed that house of Abraham seuen times, alway touching and kissing euerie cor∣ner. Tenne or twelue paces from this house was another, in manner of a Chappell, with three or foure gates, and in the middest thereof a pit of brackish water, three∣score and tenne yards deepe. Thereat stand sixe or eight men, appointed to draw water for the people; who after their seuen-fold Ceremonie come to the brinke, and say, All this be for the honour of GOD, and the piteous GOD pardon mee my sinnes. Then doe those other powre vpon them three buckets full of Water, from the top of their heads to their feet, be their garments neuer so costly. The Carovan The Pilgrims going to the Mountaine of Pardons. hauing abode at Mecca fiue dayes, the night before the euening of their Feast, the Captaine, with all his Companie, setteth forwards, toward the Mountaine of Pardons, called Iabel Arafata, distant from Mecca fifteene miles. This Mountaine, or small Hill rather, is in compasse two myles, enuironed round a∣bout with the goodliest Plaine that mans eye hath seene, and that Plaine compassed with high Mountaines. Vpon the side towards Mecca there are many pipes of cleare fresh water, wherewith the people refresh themselues and their Cattell. Adam and Eue, when they were banished Paradise, after they had beene separated fortie yeares, one in Nubia, and the other in India (as you heard before) met at this pleasant place, and here inhabited and built a little house, which they call at this day Beyt-Adam, the house of Adam.
Hither come also the same day the other Carouans of Arabia & Damasco, and all the in∣habitants for ten daies iourney round about, so that at one time here is to be seen aboue 200000. persons, and 300000, cattell. Now all this company meeting together, the night before the feast, the three Hostes cast themselues into a triangle, setting the moun∣taine in the middest, and fill heauen and earth with shouting-singing, hallowing, gun∣shot, & fire-workes all that night. The next day being then feast, in silence they attend their sacrifices and prayers onely. And in the euening, they which haue horses, mount thereon, and approch as nigh vnto the mountaine as they can: others make the best shift they can on foote; giuing euer vnto the Captaine of Cairo the chiefe place, the second to the Captaine of Damasco, & the third to the Captaine of Arabia. And being all appro∣ched, there commeth one of the Sntones mounted on a Camel well furnished, who at the other side of the mountaine ascendeth fiue steppes into a pulpit, made for that purpose, and there maketh a sermon to the people. The Contents whereof, are the benefits which GOD hath bestowèd on them, deliuerance from Idolatry, giuing them the house of Abraham, and the mountaine of pardons: adding that the mercifull GOD commanded his Secretarie Abraham, to build him an house in Mecca, wherein his successors might be heard, at which time all the mountaines in the world came toge∣ther thither with sufficiencie of stones for the building thereof, except that little lowe hill, which for pouertie could not goe to discharge this debt: for the which it became sorrowfull, and wept thirtie yeares, at the end whereof GOD in compassion said vnto it, weepe no more my daughter, comfort thy selfe: I will cause all those that goe to the house, of my seruant Abraham, that they shall not be absolued from their sinnes, vnlesse they first come to doe thee reuerence, to keepe in this place their holiest feast. And this I haue commanded to my people by the mouth of my friend & Prophet Mahomet. This said, he exhorteth them to the loue of GOD, to prayer, and Almes. The Sermouended, at the sun-setting they make three prayers: first for the Seriffo, second for the Grand Sig∣nior, the third for the People: to which prayers all with one voice, cry Amin Ia Alla A∣min Ia Alla; Be it so Lord. Barthema addeth to the Sermon the Cadi or Santones exhor∣tation to weepe for their sinnes, and knocke their breasts with inuocation of Abraham, and Isaac, to pray for the people of the Prophet; and reporteth further, that there were killed on the first day more then thirty thousand Rammes or Sheepe toward the West, and giuen to the poore; of which there were thirty or forty thousand. Thus hauing had the Santones blessing, and saluted the Mountaine of pardons they returne the way they came, in the middest of which way, is a place called Mina: and a little from thence, foure great pillars, two on each side of the way. If any passe not through the middest of these, he looseth all the merit of his Pilgrimage. And from the Mount of pardons, till they be passed these pillars, none dare looke back∣ward, for feare least his finnes which he hath lest in the mountaine, returne to him againe. Being past these Pillars euery one lighteth downe, seeking in this sandy field fiftie or threescore little stones, which they binde in an handkerchiefe and carry to that place of Mina, where they stay fiue daies, because at that time there is a Faire, free and franke of all custome. And in this place are other three Pillars not together, but set in diuers places, Monuments of those three Apparitions, which the Diuell made to Abraham, and to Barthema saith Isaac. Ismael his Sonne: for they now a daies make no mention of Isaac, as if he had neuer beene borne. They say that when as Abraham at GODS command went to offer his sonne Ismael, the diuell dehorted him from the same: but seeing his labour lost, hee went to Ismael and bid him pittie himselfe. But Ismael tooke vp stones and threw at him, saying I defend me with GOD from the Diuell the offender. These words the Pil∣grims repeate in their visitation of these pillars, hurling away the stones they had ga∣thered. From hence halfe a mile is a mountaine, whither Abraham went to sacri∣fice his sonne. In the same is a great denne, whither the pilgrims resort to make their prayers, and there is a great stone separated in the middest by the knife of Ismael (they say) at the time of this sacrifice. Barthema reporteth that here at Mecca hee sawe two Vnicornes: which I mention, because since that time I haue
not found any Author, which hath testified the like sight. They were sent to the Seriffo for a present to the Aethiopian King. The Carouan departing for Medina, as soone as they come in sight thereof (they call the place the Mountaine of health) they alight, and going vp the hill, shoute with loude voices and say, Prayer and health bee vnto thee, O Prophet of GOD, Prayer and health be vpon the Obeloued of GOD. They proceede on their iourney, and lodge that night within three miles of Medina, and the next morning are receiued with solemnitie of the Gouernour. Medina, Description of Medina. is a Citie two miles in circuite, with faire houses of Lime and stone, and a square Mosquita in the middest, lesse but more sump∣tuous then that of Mecca. This Medina, called Tal Nabi, that is, of the Prophet, in Barthema's time contained about three hundred houses, and was very barren, one garden of Dates excepted: but now they haue store of Fruits. This Temple is square, a hundred paces in length, fourescore in bredth. It hath in it an Ile made Arch-wise, sup∣ported with foure hundred Pillars, and supporting (as he saith) three thousand lampes. In one part of this Mosquita was a Librarie of fortie fiue Mahumeticall bookes. Also within the same (in a corner thereof) is a In Barthema it is said that it was a graue (fossa) vnder the earth: and there were also Had, Othman, Bubcher and Hom with the bookes of their ordinan∣ces and Sects. Tombe built vpon foure pillars vvith a Vault, exceeding in height the Mosquita; being couered with Leade, and the top all in ameld with golde, and an halfe Moone vpon the top, wrought within very Artifici∣ally with golde. Below there are round about great iron staires ascending vp to the middest of the pillars, and in the middest lieth buried the body of Mahumet (not in an iron Chest attracted by Adamant at Mecca, as some affirme.) Or to say the truth, neither here nor at Mecca can they shew this seducers body. For the Captaine of that Carouan of Damasko, in which Barthema went on this Pilgrimage, offered to the chiefe Priest of that Mosquita, three thousand Saraffi of golde, to shew him the bo∣die of the Nabi or Prophet; that (saith he) being the onely cause of my comming. The Priest answered proudly: How can those eyes, wherewith thou hast committed so much euill in the world, see him by whom God hath created heauen and earth? The Captaine replyed, True Sir, but doe me that fauour, to let mee see his body and I will presently plucke out Which some are reported to doe indeede after so holy a sight, not fur∣ther polluting their eyes. mine eyes. The Priest answered, O Sir I will tell you the truth. It is true, that our Prophet would die here to glue vs good example: for hee might haue died at Mecca, but such was his humilitie for our instruction: and present∣ly after hee was dead, he was carried by the Angels into heauen. And where (saith the Captaine) is IRSVS CHRIST the SONNE of Mary? The Priest answered, At the feete of Mahomet. In the night time by some fire-workes in the steeple, they would haue gulled the credulous people with opinion of miracle, vsing out-cries in the night, saying Mahomet would rise againe: and when the Mamalukes could see no such light shine forth of Mahomets Tombe, as they rumoured, they said it was because they were slaues and weake in the faith, and could not see heauenly sights. To returne to the discouerie of this supposed Sepulchre: Ouer the body they haue built a Tombe of speckled stone, a brace and halfe high, and ouer the same another of Legmante foure-square in maner of a pyramis. Round about the sepulchre there hangeth a Curtaine of silke: which hideth the sepulture from their sight, that stand without. Be∣yond this in the same Mosquita are other two sepulchers of Fatima & Hali. The atten∣dants on these sepulchers are fiftie Eunuches, white & Taunie, of which, three onely of the eldest and best esteemed white Eunuches, may enter within the Tombe: vvhich they doe twice a day to light the Lampes, and for other seruices. The other attend on the Mosquita and those two other sepulchers. Where euery one may goe and touch at his pleasure, and take of the earth for deuotion, as many doe. The Captaine with great pompe presenteth that Pyramidlike Vestment (whereof you haue heard) for the Tombe, the Eunuches taking away the old, and laying on the new: and after this, other vestures for the ornament of the Mosquita. And the people without deliuer vnto the Eunuches, each man somewhat to touch the Tombe therewith: which they keepe as a relique with great deuotion. Here is a stately Hospitall built by Cassachi or Rosa, the Wife of Great Soliman,
richly rented, and nourishing many poore people. A mile from the Citie are cer∣taine houses, in one of which they say Mahomet dwelt, hauing on euery side ma∣ny Date-trees, amongst which there are two growing out of one stocke exceeding high, which their Prophet forsooth graffed with his owne hands. The fruit thereof is alway sent to Constantinople for a present to the Graund-Signior, and is said to bee the blessed fruit of the Prophet. Also there is a little Mosquita vvherein three places are counted Holy. The first they affirme their Prophet made his first prayer in, after hee knew GOD. The second is that, whither hee went when he would see the house of Abraham. Where when hee sate downe to that intent, the mountaines opened from the top to the bottome, to shew him the house, and after closed againe as before. The third is the middest of the Mosquita where is a Tombe made of Lime and Stone foure-square, and full of Sand, wherein they say was buried that blessed Camell which Mahomet was alway wont to ride vpon. On the other side of the Citie are tombes of the Holy Mahumetans, Abubachar, Ottoman, Omar, which Bartemay saith were buried in the same Temple with Mahumet, and all vnder the earth. A daies iourney from Medina is a steepe mountaine, hauing no passage but one narrow path, which was made by Haly: who fleeing from the pursuing christians, and hauing no way of escape, drew out his sword, and diuided this mountaine, and so saued his life. The Captaine at his returne to When the Soldans reig∣ned in Egypt, they had a ceremonie af∣ter the Pilgri∣mage, to cut in peeces a Camell which had carried their Alcoran in great solem∣nitie to the Soldans pa∣lace: euery particle of the beast and of his furniture being estee∣med, and re∣serued as a ho∣ly relike. Cairo, is with a sumptuous Feast receiued of the Basha, and presented with a garment of cloth of golde: hee againe presenteth the Alcoran, out of the chest to the Basha to kisse, and then it is laide vp againe. By this time your pilgri∣mage hath more then wearied you. CHAP. VII. Of the successors of Mahomet, of their different Sects, and of the dispersing of that religion through the world. MAHOMET hauing with word and sword published his Alcoran (as you haue heard) his followers after his death succeeding in his place, exceeded him in tyranny. Enbocar, surnamed Abdalla, vndertooke the defence of that faithlesse faith and kingdome, and that (as his predeces∣sor had done) partly by subtletie, partly by force. For when as Mahumets Disciples had buried their new religion with their olde Mr., ex∣cept a few of his kindred, he applyed his wits to recall them; and whereas Arab. Nob. ref. Hali, Ma∣homets neerest kinsman and sonne in lawe disagreed from him, and was perswaded by the Iewes to professe himselfe a Prophet, with promise of their best aide and assis∣tance: Eubocar ( or Ebuber) reconciled him, and (as their Arabian Chronicle witnes∣seth) conuerted many Infidels, and slew the gaine-sayers. He raigned one yeere, and three monethes, and thirteene daies. The next successor Aomar (saith the same Au∣thor; Leo Leo l.8. termeth him Homar) ordained their prayers in the moneth Ramazan, and that the Alcoran should be read through, which he caused to be written out, and vni∣ted in one booke: he conquered Aegypt by Hanir his Captaine; after that Damasco, Ierusalem, Gaza, and a great part of Syria were subdued. He raigned ten yeares, and sixe monethes. Odmen.12. Hali.4 ye. Alhacen fiue monethes and twenty daies. Moaui 17. yeeres. Iezid. three  yeeres eight monethes, who said that the Prophet com∣manded not to blame, but to pray for and to obey Rulers, though wic∣ked: for ye shall haue mer∣cy, and they punishment. Odmen or Ozimen succeeded, and raigned twelue yeares: and after him Hali; and next to him his sonne Alhatem; and then Moani the great conqueror, &c. These foure Enbocar, Aomar, Ozimen, and Hali are the foure great Doctors of the Ma∣humetan lawe: and Mahomet before his death prophesied that they should succeede him, and of their worthines. But as Mahomet had pretended the name of Gabriel to the dreames of Sergius, & o∣ther Apostata's of the christians & Iewes, disagreeing both with the truth & themselues: so it was not long, that this vntempered mortar would hold together these buildings. For the Ref.Ara.Nob. Alcoran being (according to diuers copies thereof,) read diuersly, was cause of different Sects among them. Ozimen, to preuent the danger hereof, commanded
that all the copies of their lawe should be brought and deliuered into the hands of Zei∣di and Abdalla; who conferring their copies, should make one booke, and, where they dissented, should reade according to the copie of Corais. Thus these two, according to the Kings Edict, to stablish an vniformitie in the reading of the Alcoran, hauing out of all those copies framed one to be authenticall, burned all others. Yet were they decei∣ued of their hopes, partly because Hali, Abitalib, and Ibenmuzed would not bring in their bookes, of which that of Hali was the same which Mahumet had left, and was after by the Iewes altered, putting out and in at their pleasure: and partly, because that Booke, which they had thus culled out of the rest to remaine Canonicall, was lost, and of the foure copies which they had written thereof, by fire and negligence all peri∣shed. Eletragig would haue vsed the like policie after; but this many-headed serpent, which could not in the shell be killed, much lesse in his riper grouth could bee refor∣med. Those foure Doctors aforesaid, aemulous of each other, intending their owne priuate endes, sowed the seedes then, which fructifie in their venemous multiplication till this day. G. Bot Ben. Curio calleth these Sects Me∣lici, followed in Africa; Asafij, professed in A∣rabia and Sy∣ria; Arambeli, in Armenia and Persia; Buanisi, in A∣lexandria and Assyria; and all foure are followed in Cairo.l.5.1. Hali or Alli was author of the sect Imemia, which was embraced of the Persians, Indians, and of many Arabians, and the Gelbines of Africa. Ozimen or Odmen began the Sect Baanesia or Xefaia, and hath in diuers countries his followers. Homar foun∣ded the Anefia, followed of the Turkes, Syrians, and in Zahara in Afrike. Eubocar (o∣therwise called Ebuber, or Abubequer) taught the Sect Melchia, generally posses∣sing Arabia and Africa. From these foure in processe of time arose other 68. Sects Sar∣rac. 68. Sects of name, besides other pedling factions of smaller reckoning. Amongst the rest the Morabites haue beene fa∣mous; liuing for the most part as Heremites, and professing a Morall Philosophy, with principles different from the Alcoran. One of these not many yeares since, shewing the name of Mahomet in his brest (there imprinted with Aqua fortis, or some such like mat∣ter) raised vp a great number of Arabians in Afrike, and laide siege to Tripolis: where being betraied by one of his Captaines, his skinne was sent for a present to the Grand Signior. These Morabites affirme, that when Hali fought, he killed a hundred thousand Christians with one stroke of his sword, which was a hundred cubites in length. The Cobtini are a sect ridiculous. One of them shewed himselfe riding in the country of Algier, on a Reede, rained & bridled as a horse; much honoured, for that on this horse this Asse (had as he said) rid a hundred leagues in one night. I. Leo l.3. writeth, that one Elefacin had written at large of the Mahumetan Sects: of which hee reckoneth three∣score and twelue principall (which agreeth with our former number) euery one ac∣counting his owne to bee good and true, in which a man may attaine saluation. And yet Leo there addeth, that in this age there are not found aboue two. But two principall fa∣ctions Mahu∣metan, at this day. One is that of Leshari; which in all Turkie, Arabia, and Africa is embraced: the other Imamia; cur∣rant in Persia and Corosan: (of which in his proper place more.) So that by Leo's iudge∣ment all which follow the rule Leshari or Hashari are Catholike Mahumetans; although of these the same author affirmes, that in Cairo & all Egypt are foure religions different from each other, in spirituall or Ecclesiasticall ceremonies, and also in this, as concerning their ciuil & Canon lawe; all founded on the Mahumetan scripture in times past, by foure learned men, diuersly construing the generall rules to such particulars as seemed to them fitter for their followers; who disagreeing in opinion, agree in affection, and conuerse together without hatred or vpbraiding each other. As for those other sects, it seemeth that they are for the most part long since vanished: and those differences which remain, consist rather in diuersitie of rule, and order of profession, then in differing Sects and he∣resies of religion: except in some few which yet remaine, of which 1.Leo l.3. Leo thus reporteth: Fourescore yeares after Mahumet, one Elhesenibnu Abilhaseu gaue certaine rules to his disciples, contratie to the Alcoran-principles: but vvrit nothing. About a hun∣dred yeares after Elharit Ibnu Esed of Bagaded vvrit a booke vnto his Disci∣ples, condemned by the Calipha and Canonists. But about fourescore yeares af∣ter that, another great Clarke reuiued the same doctrine, and had many follo∣wers; yet hee and they were therefore condemned to death. But obtaining to haue
triall of his opinions by disputation, he ouerthrew his Aduersaries, the Mahometane Lawyers: and the Califa fauoured the said sect, and erected-Monasteries for them. Their sect continued till Malicsah of the Nation of the Turkes persecuted the same. But twenty yeares after it was againe renued, and one Elgazzuli (a learned man) writ seuen bookes, reconciling these Sectaries and the Lawyers together: which reconciliation continued till the comming of the Tartars: and Asia and Afrike was full of these refor∣mers of their Lawe. In olde time none but learned men might bee admitted professors hereof: but within these last hundreth yeares euery ignorant Idiot professeth it, saying that learning is not necessary, but What diffe∣rence herein, betweene the Mahumerane and the Sepa∣ratist? the holy spirit doth reueale to them which haue cleane hearts the knowledge of the truth. These contrarie to the Alcoran sing loue-songs and dances, with some phantasticall extasies; affirming themselues to be rauished of diuine loue. These are great Gluttons: they may not marry, but are reputed Sodomites. The same our Author writeth of some which teach, that by good workes, fasting and abstinence, a man may attaine a nature Angelicall, hauing his minde so purified that he cannot sinne, although he would. But he must first passe through fiftie degrees of dis∣cipline: And although hee sinne before he be past these fiftie degrees, yet GOD doth not impute it to him. These obserue strange and inestimable Fasts at the first: after, they liue in all pleasures of the world. Their rule was written in foure volumes by a learned and eloquent man, Essehrauar: and by Ibnul-farid another Author, in exact and most learned verse. That the spheres, elements, Planets, and starres are one GOD, and that no faith nor lawe can be erroneous, because that all men (in their mindes) intend to worship that which is to bee worshipped. And they beleeue that the knowledge of GOD is contained in one man, who is called Elcorb, elected and partaker of GOD, and in knowledge as GOD. There are other fortie men amongst them, called Elauted, that is Tronchi. dunces, because of their lesse knowledge. When the Elcorb or Elcoth dieth, his successor is chosen out of these: and into that vacant place of the forty, they chuse one out of another number of seuenty. They haue a third inferiour number of a hun∣dred threescore and fiue (their title I remember not) out of which they chuse, when any of the threescore and ten die. Their lawe or rule enioineth them to wander through the world in manner of fooles, or of great sinners, or of the vilest amongst men. And vn∣der this cloke many are most wicked men, going naked without hiding their shame, and haue to deale with women in the open and common streets like beasts. Of this base sort are many in Tunis, and farre more in Egypt, and most of all in Cairo. I my selfe (saith our author) in Cairo in the street called Bain Elcasraim, saw one of them with mine eies take a beautifull Dame comming out of the Bathe, and laide her downe in the mid∣dest of the streete, and carnally knew her, and presently when he had left the woman, all the people ranne to touch her clothes, because a holy man had touched them. And they said, that this Saint seemed to doe a sinne, but that he did it not. Her Husband knowing of it, reckoned it a rare fauour and blessing of GOD, and made solemne feasting, and gaue almes for that cause. But the Iudges which would haue punished him for the same, were like to be flaine of the rude multitude: who haue them in great reputation of san∣ctitie, and euery day giue them gifts and presents. There are another sort, that may be termed Caballists: which fast strangely, nor doe they eate the flesh of any creature, but haue certaine meates ordained and appointed for euery houre of the day and night, and certaine particular prayers, according to the daies and monethes numbring their said prayers: and vse to carry vpon them some square things, painted with Characters and numbers. They affirme that the good spi∣rits appeare, and acquaint them with the affaires of the world. An excellent Doctor, na∣med Boni, framed their rule & prayers, and how to make their squares: and it seemeth to me (who haue seene the worke) to be more Magicall then Cabalasticall. One book she∣weth their prayers & fastings: the second, their square: the third, the vertue of the foure∣score & nineteene names of GOD, which I saw in the hand of a Venetian Iew at Rome. There is another rule in these sects, called Sunach, of certaine Heremites which liue in woods, and solitarie places, feeding on nothing but hearbes & wilde fruits, and none can particularly know their life, because of this solitarines. Thus faire Leo.
Other Heremites they haue of another sort: one is mentioned by Leo, Leo lib.4. who had fiue hundred horse, a hundred thousand sheepe, two hundred beeues, and of offerings and almes betwixt foure and fiue thousand Ducates, his same great in Asia and Afrike, his disciples many, and fiue hundred people dwelling with him at his charges; to whom he enioineth not penance, nor any thing: but giueth them certaine names of GOD, and biddeth them with the same to pray vnto him so many times a day. When they haue learned this, they returne home: he hath a hundred tents for strangers, his cattell, and familie: he hath foure wiues, besides slaues, and (by them) many children sumptuously ap∣parelled. His fame is such that the King of Teleusin is afraid of him: and he payeth no∣thing to any: such veneration haue they towards him, reputing him a Saint. Leo saith he spake with him, and that this Heremite shewed him Magicke-bookes: and he thought that this his great estimation did come by false working of the true Science: so the here∣mite termed Magicke. But these Heremites we cannot so well reckon a Sect, as a religious order; of which sort there are diuers in these Mahumetan Nations, as in our ensuing discourse shall appeare. To returne therefore to the consideration of the meanes vsed to preuent the varietie of Sects among them: The Caliphs sought to remedy these inconuenien∣ces by their best policie. Io.Bot.Ben. Moaui about the yeere of our LORD 770. assembled a generall counsell of their learned men to consult about an vniformitie: but they dis∣agreeing among themselues, he chose sixe men of the most learned, and shut them vp in a house together with their Scriptures, commanding them that out of those copies disagreeing (as you haue heard) they should chuse that should seeme best. These re∣duced the doctrine of Mahomet into sixe bookes: forbidding any on paine of death to speake or write otherwise of their Lawe. But because the Arabians of subtle and piercing wit, which studied Philosophy in the Vniuersities of Bagdet, Marocco, Cordoua and other places, could not but spy and discerne the madde folly of the Lawe, so palpable to any reasonable iudgement: it Fr. Richard.c.13. vvas therefore ordained, that the Philosophy lecture should bee taken away, and in place thereof they should reade the Alcoran; prouiding, for all these students of their Lawe, their expenses out of the publike charge, and inhibiting all further study in Philosophy: insomuch that they now (saith our Author, who himselfe was a student in that Vniuersitie) re∣pute him not a good Saracen, who is addicted to that study. This Frier Richard men∣tioneth an other Prophet, named Solem, had in estimation with these Babylonians, which was after slaine by the Tartars. Hee and Cardinall Cusanus affirme, that the Sa∣racens of the East differ in their Alcoran from those of the West, making the first fiue chapters but one; and that they differ in the exposition therof, and in the same schooles or Vniuersities, one sect condemneth another. But in these times the Mahumetane professors are chiefely distinguished by the se∣uerall Nations; of which are foure principall: the Arabians, Persians, Turkes, and Tar∣tars: to which we may adde the Mogore, as a fift: whom the Iesuites (in their Epistles) report to halt from his former Mahumetisme, and to incline to Gentilisme. Of all these, the Arabians are most zealous in their superstition; the Persians most agree to reason & nature; the Tartars are more heathenish and simple; the Turkes are the free∣est and most Martiall. The Arabians account it their peculiar glory, that Mahumet was of that Nation, and that Mecca and Medina are there seated: and therefore haue laboured in the daies of their former puissance, by the Sword, since, by their traf∣fique and preaching, to spread their Mahumetisme through the world. Their first sedu∣cers had possessed Syria and Paleflina: Homar had added Aegypt, and in a short time their successors had preuailed in Asia, Afrike, and Europe, as we Sup.c.2. haue before shewed. They haue beene such in Armes: and in diligence of preaching they haue beene as forward, and so continue. Io.Bot.Ben. Seuen hundred yeares since, Perimal reigning in Malabar, they there sowed their Tares: and the more easily to take those Ethnikes in their net, they took their Daughters in marriage; a matter of much consequence, in regard of their wealth, and practised of them to this day. They were Authors of great gaine vn∣to them by their trades, and traffique for spicerie: and were suffered to inhabite, and
plant Colonies amongst them. By their meanes, Calicut, of a finall thing, became a great and rich City. And Perimal himselfe was peruerted by them to their faith: who, zealously inclined to their perswasions, resolued to end his dayes at Mecca, and put himselfe on the voyage with some ships of Pepper, and other things of price, but perished by tempest in the way. From Malabar they passed to the Maldiuae, and Zei∣lan, Somatra, Iaua, Molucca, the Philippinaes, and in the continent to Cambaia, Ben∣gala, Siam, Malucca, Ior, Pam, and the huge kingdome of China, preaching and planting their superstitions, as in the particular Histories of these Nations shall fur∣ther appeare. They are in this respect so zealous, that euen the Arabian mariners will stay behind in the Countries of the Ethnikes there to diuulge this their sect: and in the yeare 1555. one of them pierced as farre as Iapon, there to haue laied this lea∣uen: but the Portugalls in these Easterne parts, treading in the same steppes, by their trafficke and preachings haue much hindered their proceedings. The Tartars, Per∣sians & Turks, require longer and seuereall discourses in their due place; and first we wil speake of them which are first in this ranke, the greatest of all Mahumetane States, the Turkes. They reckon madde men very holy and Saints: and therefore Vertomannus fained himselfe mad, so escaping the furious zeale of the Moores, and his streight imprison∣ment. But this and many other their superstitions wee shall finde in the Turke, and therefore forbeare now to report them. Damsco, sometime (as is said) was their Patriarchall Sea, and continued famous for the Mahumetane superstition long after. It is reported, That in the time of Ta∣merlane, the magnificence of their Temple was most admirable: hauing forty great Porches in the circuit thereof: and within, nine thousand Lampes hanging from the roofe, all of gold and siluer. Hee spared the City at first for the Temple, and after de∣stroyed both it and them, as Libr.1.cap.15. we haue before related. CHAP. VIII. Of the Turkish Nation: their originall, and proceedings. ALthough some may thinke that I haue beene so tedious in the relation of the Mahumetan opinions and superstitions, that, to speake any thing more, would seeme but as pouring water into a full Sea: Yet, because there is in this World nothing certaine, but vncertainty, it being diuine prerogatiue to be Yesterday, today, the same for euer: and that this Saracenicall Religion hath sustained her chaunces and changes according to the diuersity of times and places, where it is and hath beene pro∣fessed: so do I hold it fit, as wee haue seene the foundation, to behold also the frames and fabriques thereon builded, and from that fountaine (or sincke-hole rather) of su∣perstition, to leade you along the gutters and streames thence deriued. And because the Turkes are preeminent in all those things which this profession accounteth emi∣nent, it is meetest to giue them the first place here, which else where take it and af∣ter we haue set downe a briefe History of that Nation, and the proceedings of their state, to describe their theory and opinions, and then their practise and rites of Reli∣gion. But before we come to the discouery of their religion, it is not amisse to search the beginning and increase of this Nation. The name of Turkes signifieth (saith Chitraus) Sheepheards, or Heard-men: and such it seemeth was their auncient profession, as of the rest of the Scithians vnto this day. Nicephorus Lir.18.ca.30 speaketh of the Turkes, and placeth them about Bactria: their chiefe City he calleth Taugast, which is supposed to be the work of Alexander. Their Religion he saith at that time was to worship the Fire, Ayre, Water and Earth, which they adore, and sing Hymnes to. They acknowledge GOD the maker of Heauen
and Earth, to whom they sacrifice, horse, kine, and sheepe: they haue Priests which diuine of things to come. The Prince of Taugast, they called the Sonne of GOD: They worship Images. The Prince spendeth the night with seuen hundred women. The Tartars haue now possessed the same Countrey; but long before, the same rites: as you may reade in our History of them. To deriue them (as some doc) from Troians and Iews, is some what farre Turci quasi Teucri, Richer. de reb. Turc. & Mart. Barletues de Scodrensi ex∣pug lib.1.men∣tion this opi∣nion, & Andr. a lacuna. fetched: nor is there much likelihood, that they should receiue their name of Turca Lonicer chr.Turc. to.1.l.b.1, a Persian City: the name is auncient, and applied by Pom.Mela.li.1.c.vlt.lin.lib.6  7. Mela and Pliny to a Nation of the Scythians, & their originall is accounted Scythi∣an by the Laon. Chal∣condyl.lib.1.lo. Bapt.Egnstius. Nic. Euboic. Sa∣gun. Ep. Knolls, &c. most & best Authors. There are which bring a long genealogie from No∣abs Arke, vnto the Ottoman family: heerein disagreeing, while some will haue Ma∣gog, others Tubal the Author of their Nation. Leunclavius Io.Leunel. hist. Musulm. reciteth and refuteth the same. He writeth the name Iurki, alleadging Herodotus for his Author: and citeth many Authors to proue that they descended of the Vnni or Vngri, which were cal∣led Turkes, of which there were two sorts, one westerly in Pannonia, an other ea∣sterly neare Persia, called by the Persians Magores, hee concludeth that the Vnnior Iurchi came from Iuchra or Iuchria (whence the name Iuchri might easily be deffe∣cted to Iurchi) beyond Tanais; and first after they had forsaken their owne Coun∣try, setled themselues neare Maeotis, from whence they passed to Chazaria, and some went westward to Pannonia, some eastward to Armenia, and thence into Persia. Many probable Arguments might bee brought, to proue that they descended of the Scythians, whose wandering shepheardly life, both the name and their pra∣ctise (in old times, and in some places still) expresseth. The first Expedition and mili∣tary employment which I haue read of the Turkes, was P.Bizar.hist.Pers.libr.5. vnder Varamus a rebelli∣ous Persian, aboue a thousand yeares since, when Cosroes was King of Persia, and Mauritius the Roman Emperour: at what time many of them were slaine, and many taken, which confessed, that famine had forced them to those warres, for which cause they marked themselues with a blacke Crosse; a ceremony which they said they had learned of the Christians, thinking thereby to expell hunger. This hungry Nation hath since beene a greedy and insatiate deuourer of Nations. Another expedition of theirs (which some reckon the first) Knol.Turc.hist. was in the yere 755, or after an other account, 844; at which time, passing through the Georgian Country, then called Iberia, they first seised on a part of the greater Armenia, which their Posterity holdeth at this day, called of them Turcomania. In this wide and spacious Country they romed vp and down, without certaine habitation, a long time with their families and heards of cattell, like the ancient Scithian Nomades, and the Tartars, and the same Turco∣man Nation at this day. When as the Saracens Empire grew now vnweldy, through her owne greatnesse, and the Soldans, which were wont to conquer for the Chaliph, began now to share with him in his large Dominion: Mohomet (then Sultan or Soldan of Persia) was for this cause hardly beset with the Chaliph of Babylon; assailed also on the other side by the Indians. He sought to strengthen himselfe against these enemies with the new friendship of these Turks, of whom he obtayned for his ayde three thousand hardy souldiors, Hist.Musulm.libr.1. Theodor Gaza de orig. Turcar. epist. Io.Bapt. Egnat.de orig. Turc. vnder the conduct of Togra Mucalet the sonne of Mikeil a valiant Cap∣taine, and chiefe of the Selzuccian tribe or family, whom the Greeks commonly call Tangrolipia, and some Selduc, or Sade. By the help of this Tangrolipix, Mahomet the Persian Sultan ouercame Pisasiris the Chaliph. The Turks, after this warre, desi∣ring leaue to passe ouer the riuer Araxis to their Country-men, were both denied, and threatned, if they againe should seeke to depart. Whereupon they withdrew them∣selues into the Desart of Carauonitis; liuing there, and thence making roads into the Countreys adioyning. Mahumet sent against them twenty thousand men, which by a sodayne surprize in the night, Tangrolipix defeated, and furnished himselfe with their spoyles. And now durst Tangrolipix shew his face in the field, where his army was increased by the resort of lawlesse persons, seeking after spoyle. Mahomet on the other side, impatient of his losse, put out the eyes of the Captaines, which had the lea∣ding of the army, and threatned to attire the souldiors, that had fled, in womens ap∣parel:
and raysing an other great army, set forward against Tangrolipix, who was now fifty thousand strong, and was presently made stronger by those threatned soul∣diours, who fled from their Lord vnto him. They met at Ispahan (a City of Persia) and there Mahomet falling with his horse, brake his necke: vpon which mischance both armies comming to agreement, by common consent, proclaymed Tangrolipix Tangrolipix, first Sultan a∣mongest the Turkes, An.Do. 1030. some cal him Tangrolipix and some Tan∣groipix. Sultan in his stead; and so made him King of Persia, and the Dominion thereunto pertaining, which was done Anno 1030. Tangrolipix opened the passages of Araxis to the rest of his Country-men, whome he exalted to the highest places of command, so bridling the Persians, and he and his receiuing in their new Conquests the yoke of the Mahometan Religion. Ambiti∣on inciting him to further exploits, he warred also vpon Pisasiris the Chaliph: and af∣ter diuers ouerthrowes, slew him, and seised on his state. Hee sent Cutlu-Muses his kinsman against the Arabians, by whom he was discomfited: whereat aggrieued, he went against them himselfe, but with like successe. He sent Asan his brothers sonne to inuade Media, who in that enterprise was slaine: he sent againe Habraime Alim his brother with an army of an hundred thousand men, who tooke prisoner Liparites Gouernour of Iberia, (who came to aide the Emperours Lieutenant in Media) whom Tangrolipix frankely set free, and sent his embassadour to the Emperour, proudly de∣maunding him to become his subiect. Such happes, and such hopes had Tangrolipix, the first Turke that euer was honou∣red with a Diadem. His sonne Knolls Tur∣kish historie. and successour Axan tooke Diogenes the Emperour of Constantinople prisoner in the field: But Cutlu-Muses with his cousin Melech (who in his Fathers dayes had fled into Arabia) rebelling, and taking armes against him; as Axan was ready to ioyne battell with them, the Caliph (who retayned the highest place still in their superstition, although dispoyled of his Temporalties) setting aside all his pontificall formality, whereby he was bound not to go out of his owne house, thrust himselfe betweene these armies: and with the reuerence of his place & person, together with his perswasions, moued them to desist, and to stand to his arbitrement: which was, that Axan the Sultan should stil enioy his dominions entirely: And that Cutlu-Muses, and his sonnes aided by him, should inuade the Constantinopolitan Em∣pire, and should be absolute and onely Lords of whatsoeuer they could gaine thereof. There was neuer any thing to that impiety more commodious, nor to our Religion more dangerous. For by this meanes Cutlu-Muses with his sonnes in a short time conquered all Media, with a great part of Armenia, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Bi∣thynia; which their designes were much furthered by treasons and dissensions in the Greek Empire. Axan the Sultan also gaue to his kinsmen Ducat and Melech, the go∣uernment of Aleppo, and Damasco, with the adioyning parts of Syria, by that means to incroach vpon the Aegyptian Caliph, which accordingly they in a short time did. But these their haughty attempts were stayed, and being now in the flower, were cut shorter by that fortunate Expedition The memo∣rable Expedi∣tió of the chri∣stian Princes in to the Holy Land. Historia helli sacri G. Tyrij, and many o∣thers write at large of these warres. of the Christian Princes of the West, a∣greed vpon at the Councell of Claremont, and performed by Gualter Sensauier; Peter the Heremite, first and principall mouer hereof; Godfrey Duke of Lorraine, with his two brethren Eustace and Baldwin, of the honourable house of Buillon; Hugh surna∣med the Great, brother to Philip the French King; Raimond and Robert Earles of Flanders; Robert of Normandy sonne to William the Conquerour; Stephan de Va∣lois Earle of Chartiers; Ademar the Popes Legate; Bohemund Prince of Tarentum, and others, conducting, as the most receiued opinion is, three hundred thousand soul∣diors, in defence of the Christian faith against the Turkes and Saracens, which both ouerthrew the Turkes in the lesser Asia, and recouered also the holy Land. The prin∣cipality; or (as some stile it) the Kingdome of Antioch was giuen by common con∣sent to Bohemnnd Prince of Tarentum; the Kingdome of Ierusalem, to Robert: who (hearing of his Fathers death) refused it in hope of England; and Godfrey of Buillon was saluted King. The Turkes and Saracens seeking to recouer that which they had lost, lost also themselues: a hundred thousand of them being slaine in one battell: the like successe
had the Turkes after against Conrade, the Emperor at Meander: leauing for trophees and triumphall arches to the Christians, huge heapes, or hilles rather, of their bones. Hereunto helped the dissentions among the Turkes, & diuisions of their state among diuers brethren. The Egyptians also payd tribute to the Christians: which Dargan the Sultan detaining, he was by Almericus the king of Ierusalem ouerthrowne in battell. Noradine the Turke, king of Damasco, sent thither also Saracon to aid Sanar the Sul∣tan (before expulsed) to recouer his state from this Dargan: but he hauing won cer∣taine townes, kept them to himselfe, so that Sanar betook him to the patronage of Al∣mericus, who ouerthrew Saracon in battell, and after besieged and tooke Alexandria, and Pelusium, seeking also to conquer Egypt to himselfe; but indeede (as the euent proued) so subuerted his owne state. For Sanar sought help of Saracon, and for feare of both their forces, Almericus left Egypt. Saracon, moued with ambition, treache∣rously slew the Sultan, and by the Chaliph was appointed Sultan, the first of the Turks that euer enioyed the same, to whom Saladine his nephew succeeded. He (not respe∣cting the maiesty of the Chaliph, as the Sultans before had done) strucke out his brains with his horse-mans mace, and rooted out all his posterity; the better to assure him∣selfe and his Turkish successors in the possession of that kingdom, vnder whom it con∣tinued to the time of the Mamalukes. Noradin also the Turke being dead, the nobili∣tie disdaining the gouernment of Melechsala his son (yet but a youth) betrayed Damasco be∣trayed to Sala∣dine. that state vnto Saladine. And thus did he hem in the kingdome of Ierusalem on both sides: & not long after, Aleppo was betraied vnchristianly into his hands by a traitor, which gouerned the same for the Christians: Neither was it long, before he had (through discord and treason amongst the Christians) obtained Ierusalem lost againe An∣no, 1187. Ierusalem it selfe, anno 1187. and after Ascalon, and Antioch also: Neither could the Christians of the West euer re∣couer the possession of that kingdome; the cause continuing the same, which before had lost it, viz. dissention and treachery, as the examples of Richard and Edward (first of those names) Kings of this land do shew. About 1202. yeares after Christ, the Tartars (of whom in their due place) hauing conquerd East, West, North, and South, among others ouerthrew that Togrian king∣dome of the Turkes in Persia, 170. yeares before founded by Tangrolipix. The Turkes which remained (driuen to seek shelter from this violent storme) fled out of Persia in∣to Asia the lesse: where Cutlu-Muses his successors (their country-men) inioyed some part of the country. And there many of them ariuing vnder the conduct of Aladin the sonne of Kei Husreu, descended also of the Selzuccian family in Persia, taking the op∣portunity offred by the discord of the Latines with the Greeks, & the Greeks among themselues, seised vpon Cilicia, with the countries thereabout; and there first at Se∣bastia, and afterward at Iconium, erected their new kingdome, bearing the name of the Aladin Hist.Musul. man. Leunclauij libr.1. Kings or Sultans. The same Tartars vnder the conduct of Haalon, sent by Mango the great Cham, hauing conquered and starued the Chaliph of Babylon (as is said before) ouerthrew the Turkish kingdome of Damasco, and rased Anno Dom.12.0. Aleppo; the other arme of this faire & far-spreading tree being surprized by the Mamaluke slaues, who after Haalons de∣parture recouered Syria & Palestina, and were again with great slaughter dispossessed of the same by Cassanes Haiton.Ar∣men. a Tartarian prince, who repaired Ierusalem, and gaue it to the christians of Armenia, & other the Easterne countries. But Cassanes retiring into Persia to pacifie new broils, the Sultan recouered the same; the Christians of the Westnegle∣cting the iust defence therof, specially through the pride and contention of Boniface the Pope (contrary to his name) filling a great part of Europe with faction & quarrels. The Turkes in Asia paid tribute to the Tartar Cham, till (succession in the bloud of Aladin failing) this kingdome was diuersly rent, euery one catching so much as his might could bestow on his ambition. The greatest of these sharers was Knolles Tur∣kish history. one Cara∣man Alusirius, who took vnto himselfe the city Iconium, with all the country of Cili∣cia, & some part of the frontires of Lycaonia, Pamphylia, Caria, and the greater Phry∣gia, as far as Philadelphia; all which was after of him called Caramania. Next neigh∣bor and sharer to him was Saruchan: of whom Ionia Maritima is called Saruchan-ili.
The greatest part of Lydia, with som part of the greater Mysia, Troas, & Phrygia fel to Carasius, called of him Carasi-ila some part of Pontus, & the country of Paphlagonia fel to the sons of Omer, which coūtry is called Bolli. These all were of the Selzuccian fami∣ly. But the foundation of farre higher fortunes were then laied much lower by diuine prouidence, exalting Ottoman of the Oguzian tribe or family, who then held one only poore Lordship, called Suguta in Bythinia, not far from Olympus, giuen before to his father Erthogrul in meed of good seruice: which he increasing by winning somewhat from the weaker Christians his neighbors, afterwards erected into a kingdome which hath deuoured so great a part of the world, as is this day subiect to the Turkish great∣nes. When as the Tartars chased (as is said) the Turkes out of their Persian kingdom, which Tangrolipix had there established, one Solyman a Turke (of the Ogusian Tribe) raigned in Machan Leunc.histor.

He left be∣hinde him foure sonnes Sencur-Teken, Iundogdis, Ertogrul the father of Ottoman, and Dunder. The two eldest returned into Persia. The two yongest staied, and with them 400. Families, with their tents and carts, their moueable houses. And insinuating into the Sultan Aladins good liking, by sute & desert, this Ertogrul was rewarded, as ye haue heard, being made Lord of Suguta, and Warden of those Marches: and liued there in security, till he was of great yeres, and had seene much alteration in that state. He died anno 1289. hauing liued ninety three yeres. And him succeeded by common consent, as L. ouer the Ogusian Turkes, his sonne Ottoman, saluted therefore by the name of Osman Beg or Lord Osman. He first Laon. Chal∣condyles libr.1. Abraham Za∣cuthi hath writ∣ten a Chroni∣cle of these Turkes, toge∣ther with the Saracens trans∣lated by Ios. Scalig.Can. Isag.libr.2. got into his subiection a great part of the Castles and Forts of the greater Phrygia; equally protecting his subiects both Chri∣stians and Turkes: he conquered Nice, the name whereof is reuerend for the first ge∣nerall Councell of Christendome; and Aladin the second, Sultan of Iconium sent vn∣to him a faire ensigne, a Sword & Robe, with ample charters, that whatsoeuer he tooke from the christians, should be his own: and that publike praiers should be said in their temples for his death, which was of him humbly accepted, and such praiers made by one Dursu, whom he had appointed Bishop and Iudge of Carachisar, anno 1300. Ne∣apolis was made his seat royall. He fished so well in the troubled streame of the Greek Empire, that he subdued the most part of Phrygia, Mysia, and Bythinia: and Prusa af∣ter a long siege was yeelded vnto his sonne Orchanes, and made the royall seate of the Ottoman-kings, where Ottoman himselfe was buried 1228. His son Orchanes succee∣ded: Aladin his brother contenting himselfe with a priuate life, who after built two Mahumetan churches, and another at Prusa. Orchanes also erected in Nice a sumptu∣ous temple, appointing a preacher to preach to the people euery friday, and two faire Abbies: in the one of which, he with his his owne hands serued the strangers & poore the first dinner. He was the first that builded Abbies among the Turks, folowed herein by most of his successors. He got Nicomedia, and the townes adioyning. He also wan all Charasia, and at his returne built a Church and Abbey at Prusa, placing therein re∣ligious men, sought out with all diligence. His sonne Solyman first of the Turkes that possessed any foot in Europe, crossed the Hellespont, and wan the castle Zemeenic, & after that Maditus, receptacles for the Turkes, which came ouer in multitudes; he transporting Christians into Asia, to dwell in their roome. And after, An.Do.1358. he wan Galli∣poli, spoiling the country, & winning from the Greeks who were negligent in preuen∣ting or remedying this danger. But Solyman dying with a fall, his old father Orchanes liued not two months after; a prince very zealous in his superstition, who besides buil∣ding diuers churches, abbies, colledges, & cells, allowed pensions to all such as could in the church say the Booke of Mahomets law by heart, and competent maintenance to the Iudges, that they should not sell iustice. Amurath which succeeded, exceeded him in this blinde zeale. He kept in awe the Turkish Princes in Asia, and wan many Townes and Castles in Thracia: and amongst
others, Adrianople the seate royall of the Turkish Kingdome, vntill Constantinople was after subdued. This was done 1362. He ordained, that euery fift captiue of the Christians aboue fifteene yeares old, should be taken vp for the Turkish King, which were distributed among the Turkish husbandmen in Asia, to learne the Turkish lan∣guage, religion, and manners; and after two or three yeares, choice was made of the better sort, to attend vpon the Princes person, and for his warres, called Ianizars, that is, new souldiors: which Order after grew to great account, and is yet a princi∣pall pillar of the Turkish greatnes. He ouerthrew Aladin the Caramanian King, which made the other Princes of the Selzuccian family to submit themselues vnto him. And busying himselfe in his new Conquests in Europe, after a great victory obtayned a∣against Lazarus, Despot of Seruia, as hee viewed the slaine carkasses, was slaine of a wounded and halfe dead souldior: who, comming staggering, as it were to begge his life, stabbed this great Conquerour, with a dagger hidden vnder his garments.

He conquered Euboea and Illyricum, in the yeare 1474. ouerthrew the Persians; and in the last act of his bloudy life he tooke (by Ach∣metes his captaine) Otranto or Hydruntum in Italie, with no small terrour to all Italy. He was surnamed Great, and is said to haue conquered two hundred Cities, twelue Kingdomes, and two Empires: which he left to Baiazet his sonne, An. 1481. His bro∣ther Zemes was forced to flee into Italy, where a great summe of mony 40000 Du∣cats yearely. was yearely allowed the Pope to keep him for his own security, and for loue of his brother, whom Alexander the bishop is reported Guicciard. bist.

He had some wars against the Mamalukes, some against the Christi∣ans, more vnnaturall against his brother, but most most vnnaturall and monstrous a∣gainst his sonne Selym. His conquests were in Cilicia, Caramania, and Peloponnesus. Selim, not content to haue thrust his father out of the Throne, aspired to a further effect of aspiring ambition, depriuing him of life, from whome himselfe had receiued it. To this end he corrupted a Iew, Baiazets Physician (whom Knolles calles Hamon; but Menavino Ii.5.ca.22. relates all this at large Menavino an eye-witnes, nameth him Vstarabi) who with the powlder of bea∣ten Diamonds poisoned him: and for reward, when he claimed Selims promise, had his head stricken off in the tyrants presence. So much did hee hate the traitour, whose treason he so much loued. The body of Baiazet was embalmed and interred at Con∣stantinople, in a beautifull Sepulchre neare to the Meschit which himself had built, and Priests were appoynted, which should euery day pray for his Soule. Two of his Pa∣ges did Selim put to death for wearing blacke and mourning apparell for their Masters
death: and three others (whereof Menavino was one) hardly, by entreatie of Selims daughters, and some Bassacs, escaped. This Viper, that spared not his father, proceeded with bloudie hands to make an end of the rest of his Ottoman-kindred, beginning with fiue sonnes of his brethren, and adding the remnant, as he could bring them into his power. And hauing thus founded his Throne in bloudie cruelties of his owne at home, no maruell if abroad his proceedings were no lesse cruell and bloudie towards his enemies. Of whom, the first which offered himselfe (after his domesticall warres appeased) was Ismael the Sophi Henricus Pe∣nia de gestis sophi cont. Turc. ; who with thirtie thousand Persian horsemen gaue battaile to Selym (not∣withstanding his three hundred thousand Turkes) where was fought in Armenia, neere Coy, a terrible and mortall battaile betwixt them, and the Turkes at last (very hardly) preuailing, by helpe of their great Ordinance: but so little cause had they to reioyce of their victorie, that this is reckoned among the dismall and disastrous dayes, tearmed by the Turkes, the onely day of Doome. The next Anno Domi 1515. yeare he en∣tred againe into the Persian Confines, and there tooke Ciamassum, ouerthrew Ala∣deules the Mountaine-King, who raigned in Taurus and Antitaurus, and slew him. But his most fortunate attempts were against Campson Gaurus, the Aegyptian Sol∣dan, and his forces of Mamalukes, whome by his multitudes (notwithstanding their fame and valour, not inferiour to any souldiors of the World) he ouercame; the Soldan himselfe being left dead in the place, August 7. 1516. Neither had Tomumbeius, his successor, any better successe, but succeeded as well in his fortune, as to his Scepter, who by treason of his owne, and power of his ene∣mie, lost both his life and Kingdome; all Aegypt and Syria thereby accrewing to the Ottoman. Selym from thenceforth purposing to turne his forces from the Sunne∣rising against the Christians in the West, came to his owne Sunne-set, the period of his raigne and life: a miserable disease (as an angrie Pursuivant) exacting and re∣demaunding his bloudie cruell spirit, an implacable officer of that most implacable Tyrant to Tyrants, and Prince of Princes, Death, who at last conquered this Con∣queror; or rather (if his Licèt ossa ia∣cent, animus bella qurit. Phi. Lonicer. to.1.lib.1. Epitaph written on his Tombe say true) conueyed him hence to seeke new Conquests. His disease was a Canker in the backe (eating out a passage for his Viperous soule) which made him rotte while he liued, and become a stinking burthen to himselfe and others. He died in September, 1520, hauing before bequeathed bloudshed and desolation to the Christians, and ordained Soly∣man, his sonne and heire, executor of that his hellish Testament: And further, to excite him thereunto, had left him the liuely counterfeit of himselfe, with sundrie bloudie Precepts annexed: His title therein written, was, Sultan Selym Othoman, King of Kings, Lord of all Lords, Prince of all Princes, Sonne and Nephew of GOD. We may adde, Heire apparant to the Deuill, that breathed his last in bloud, resembling him that was Iob.8.44. a Murtherer from the beginning. CHAP. IX. A Continuation of the Turkish Warres and Affaires: together with the succession of the Great Turkes, till this present yeare 1612. SOlyman, surnamed the Magnificent, succeeded his father Selym in place, and surmouned him exceedingly in exploites. Belgrade, (which ominous name did presage happinesse vnto him in his Warres and Proceedings) was the beginning of his Conquests, woon by the Turkes August 29, 1521. See the Hi∣storie at large in Hakl.to.2. & Iacob.Fontanus Brugensis. Rhodes receiueth him on Christmas day 1522, but withall exileth both Cheere, Christmas, and Christians. He inuadeth Mart.Fumee Hist of Hung. lib. 1. Melchior Soiterus de bell Paice. Hungarie, and in the field discomfiteth and killeth Lewes,
and slayeth or captiueth two hundred thousand Hungarians in that Expedition, 1526. He entreth Hungarie the second time, 1529, and (after some butcheries therein) mar∣cheth to Vienna in Austria, where he left fourescore thousand of his Turkes, and then with shame and anger returned. In the yeare 1532 he returneth with an Armie of fiue hundred thousand men; to whome Charles the fifth opposed himselfe and the Christian forces, in greater numbers then hath in many ages beene seene, mustering in his Armie at Vienna two hundred and threescore thousand men, whereof fourescore and tenne thousand footmen, and thirtie thousand horsemen were old souldiors, to whom Solyman did not, or durst not, bid battaile. Poore Hungarie rues it meane while, whether he gets or looseth in Austria, being made his through-fare as he went and came. After this he trieth his successe against the Persian, where he taketh Tauris and Babylon, with the Countries of Assyria and Media, Anno 1534. each of which had sometimes beene Ladie of the World. At incredible costs he prepared a Fleet in the Red Sea, 1537, and taking Aden and Zibyth, two pettie Kingdomes in Arabia, by his forces Dam.a Goes Diensis oppug∣natio. besieged Dium, a Castle of the Portugals in the East Indies, but without his wished successe. For the Portugals still retaine their Indian Seas and Trassique, and not onely freed that their Castle from Turkish bondage, but had meanes to fortifie it bet∣ter, by the Ordinance which the Turkes, in their hastie flight, had left behind. A more dangerous plot did Solyman, meane-while, contriue against Christendome Turkish Hi∣storie, Kn. , preparing his forces to inuade Italie, and to that end was come to Aulona, an Hauen in Macedo∣nia, with two hundred thousand souldiors, where Barbarussa and Lutzis Bassa, his great Admirall, met him with his Fleet, to transport his Armie. But Solyman first employed these Sea-Forces on the coast of Italie, and tooke Castrum: his horsemen (which he had sent ouer in great Palendars) carried away the People, Cattell, and Substance, betwixt Brundusium and Tarentum, fortie myles space; all the Countrey of Otranto terrified with feare of a greater tempest. But the Venetians turned it from the rest of Italie vpon themselues (notwithstanding their league) by vnseasonable exacting of that Sea∣courtesie, the vailing of the bonnets or top-sayles of some Turkish Gallies vnto them, as Lords of that Sea: for which neglect, some of them were sunke. Auria Andrew D'O∣ree, a famous Sea-Captaine. also, the Emperours Admirall, had surprised some of the Turkes stragling Fleet, and after held cruell fight with twelue great Gallies full of Ianizaries and choisemen, whome he o∣uerthrew and tooke. But the Ianizaries that were left, cast their scimitars ouer-boord, least such choice weapons should come to the Christians hands. Solyman conuerting his forces against the Venetians, for the indignities mentioned, had almost failen into the hands of the Mountaine-Theeues, which liued in the Acroceraunian Hills: who in a strange resolution had conspired to kill him in his Tent, and had almost (to the wonder of the world) in a night, by vnknowne wayes, suddenly effected it, had not the cracking of a bough discouered their Captaine, who in a Tree was taking view of the Campe, how to bring to passe his desperate designes. This their Captaine, (by name Damianus) was, after confession hereof, torne in pieces, and those wilde Mountainers (liuing on Robberte, without Law or Religion) were, like wilde beasts, hunted to destruction. The Turkes inuaded Corsu, whence they carried sixteene thousand of the Islan∣ders captiues. They likewise, in their returne, committed great spoyle in Zante and Cythera, sacked Aegina, Paros, and other Islands in the Archipelago; bringing Naxos vnder Tribute. Barbarussa sacked Botrotus, a Venetian Citie: The like did Vstrif to Obroatium, and the Castle of Nadin. Nauplium also, and Epidaurus were besieged. But Ferdinand (who had intituled himselfe King of Hungatie, after Lewis his death) receiued a greater disgrace in Hungarie by the Turkish forces, then befell the Venetians in all their losses; Cazzianer (the Generall of the Christians) shame∣fully fleeing, and betraying his associates to the Turkish crueltie. The next yeare, 1538, Barbarussa chaseth the Christian Fleet, in which the Emperours, Venetians, and the Popes forces were ioyned.
In the yeare 1541 Solyman againe inuadeth Hungarie, professing himselfe protector of the young King, which Iohn late King of Hungarie (who had held long warres with Ferdinand about that Title) had left behind him his heire and successor. But vnder co∣lour of protection, he maketh himselfe Lord of Buda, the chiefe Citie, turning the Ca∣thedrall Church into a Meschit; and maketh Hungarie a Turkish Prouince, bestow∣ing Transyluania, and what he pleased, on the Orphan. Two yeares after he re-en∣treth Hungarie, and taketh Strigoninm: turning the Christian Temples into Mahu∣metane; sacrificing there for his victorie, as he had done at Buda. He entred also into loan. Mar∣tini Stellep. ad frat. Alba Regalis, (where the Hungarian Kings lye entombed) another chiefe Citie of that Kingdome, and slew the Magistrates. I speake not all this while of the spacious Countries in Africa, which, from the Riuer Mulvia, he added to his Dominions: the Kingdomes of Algier, Tremisen, Tunes, Tripoli, &c. being annexed to his Turkish So∣ueraignetie. Howbeit, Tunes, by aide of Charles the Emperour, somewhat recouered her selfe, but breathed out againe her last gaspe of libertie, in the dayes of Selym his sonne. And thus was Solyman as vnnaturall to, his children, as Selim was to his father Ba∣iazet. Solyman victorious and happie, otherwhere victorious and vn∣happie, when he was forced to darreine battaile against his owne bowels, and hauing murthered Mustapha his eldest sonne (the hopefullest branch in Turkish estimation that euer grew out of the Ottoman stocke) he warred against Baiazet, another of his sonnes; whome, with foure of his children, he procured to be done to death in Persia. And after much domesticall trouble, in his seuenth Expedition into Hungarie (his fleet in the siege of Malta being before, with great disgrace, repulsed) he died at the siege of Zigeth the fourth of September, 1566. Selym, the onely sonne which the bloudie father had left aliue, succeeded in the Throne, not in the prowesse and valour of his father. Neither hath any Turkish Sultan, since his dayes, led their forces in person, but committed it to their Deputies and Ge∣nerals; except once, when Mahomet the third had almost lost his Armie and himselfe. Yet did this Selym, by his Bassaes, make himselfe Lord of Of the warres of Cy∣prus, see the realtions of Nestor Marti∣ningo in Hakl.tom.2. part. 1. Cyprus, and also of the Kingdome of Tunis. But this sweet meat was sourely sawced by his exceeding losse in the Sea-fight betwixt Haly Bassa, Admirall of the Turkes Our graci∣ous Soueraign King Iames hath written a Poeme of this battell. , and Don Iohn of Au∣stria, Generall of the Fleet, set forth by the Pope, Spaniard, and Venetian, 1571: wherein an hundred threescore and one Gallies were taken, fortie sunke or burnt, and of Galliots, and other small Vessels, were taken about threescore. The Turkish Admirall was then slaine. Wittily did a Turke descant vpon this losse of the Turkes, and their gaine of Cyprus, comparing this to the shauing of a mans beard, which would grow againe: that, to the losse of an arme, which, once cut off, cannot be re∣newed. Lastly, Tunes came in, and Selym went out of this Turkish Soueraigntie both in manner together, 1574. Amurath, his heire, began his Empire with the slaughter of his fiue brethren. Michael ab isselt, Com. Anno 1575. The mother of Solyman (one of that number) slew her selfe with a dagger, for anguish of that losse. He, in viewing a new Gallie by the breach of a Peece, hardly escaped death, thirtie of his companie being slaine. And because the Plague was exceeding hote, he by deuotion sought to appease diuine anger: and therefore prohibited all vse of So∣domie, Blasphemie, and Polygamie, and himselfe put out fiue hundred women out of his Seraile. In a priuate habit he visited the Markets, and hanged vp the hoorders of Corne. He by the Tartars inuaded Polonia: And, Henry of Fraunce secretly leauing that Kingdome of Polonia, he wrote vnto them to chuse Stephen Battor for their king; in which letters he called himselfe, GOD of the Earth, Gouernour of the whole World. Messenger of GOD, and faithfull seruant of the great Prophet: which wrought so much with the Nobilitie, that either they would not or durst not doe otherwise, howsoeuer Maximilian had beene before by many of them chosen. Tamas Minadi's Historie of the warres betwixt the Turks and Persians, tran∣slated by Abra∣ham Martwell in nine books, relaleth these thinges at large. the Persian (at the same time dying) bequeathed his Crowne to Ismael his sonne, whom Aidere, his brother, seekes to depriue, but is therefore himselfe depriued of that ambitious head which he sought to adorne with the Crowne; & Ismael adding the slaughter of 8. his yonger brethren, ascendeth the throne, which, together with his life, he lost, by like vnnatural trecherie of Periaconcona his sister, the 24 of Nouēb. 1577.
Mahomet his brother succeeded in this troublesome State, which Amurath the Turke (in these troubled waters) thought fit time for himselfe to fish for. Hereunto also hel∣ped the hatred and ciuill broyles in Persia, for the head of Periaoncona, presented to Mahomet, with the haire disheuelled on a launce, and for other vncouth and bloudie spectacles; Sahamal and Levent Ogli (two Georgian Lords) seeking also innouati∣ons. Amurath therefore, in the yeare 1578, sent Mustapha Bassa, which had lately con∣quered Cyprus, with an Armie of 110000, into Persia: who, in the first battaile he had with them, slew fiue thousand, and tooke three thousand Persians: and to strike that Nation with terror, commanded a bulwarke to be framed of those heads: but by an exceeding tempest, which lasted foure dayes together (whereby the Heauens see∣med to melt themselues in teares for the Persians losse, and with Lightenings to shew that indignation against the Turkes, which in their thundering Dialect they aloud vt∣tered) there grew such horror to their mindes from aboue, and such sicknesse to their bodies, from those putrified carkasses beneath, that Mustapha was forced to remoue, missing fortie thousand of his first musters. After he had fortified the Armenian castle of Teflis, his Armie being driuen to shifts for lacke of victuals, tenne thousand of his foragers were slaine by the Persians, who were recompenced with like slaughter by Mustapha, that came vpon them whiles they were busie about the spoyle, and spoy∣led the spoylers. In passing ouer the Riuer Canac, he lost fourescore thousand Turkes, which the Riuer seemed to take for Custome (as it had many of the Persians in the late conflict) whereof his violent current was a greedie and cruell exactor. Mustapha erected a Fortresse in Eres, and tooke Sumachia, chiefe Citie of Siruan (Derbent offe∣ring her selfe to the Turke) and then returned into Natolia. But Emir Hamse Mirise, the Persian Prince, recouered, after his departure, both Eres and Sumachia, slew and captiued the Tartars, thirtie thousand of whome were newly come to the Turkes aide. He rased Sumachia euen with the ground. The next yeare Mustapha fortified Chars in three and twentie dayes, wherein they were hindered with Snowes on the fiue and twentieth of August, although it standeth in fortie foure Degrees. Anno 1580, Sinan Bassa was chosen Generall for the Persian Warre; who, as he departed from Teflis, lost seuen thousand of his people, besides such as the Georgians and Persians, together with the spoyle, carried away. This was earnest, the rest was but sportfull shewes of Warre, in trayning his souldiors; after which he returned. In 1583, Ferat Bassa was sent Generall: but little was done, till Osman Bassa, a new Generall, 1585, tooke Tau∣ris, the auncient Ecbatana (as Minadoi is of opinion.) But the Persian Prince, carri∣ed with indignation, reuenged this losse on the Turkes with his owne hands, slaying Caraet Bassa, Generall in the place of Osman, then sicke, and gaue his head (as opima spolia) to one of his followers; and afterwards at Sancazan slew twentie thousand Turkes. Osman died of sicknesse; and the Persian Prince (the morning-starre of that Easterne State) was soone after murthered. In that dismall yeare 1588, Ferat tooke Genge: fifteene thousand houses, seuen Temples, and fiue and twentie great Innes were burned in Constantinople, the tumultuous Ianizaries not suffering the fire to be quenched. An Impost was leuied of the subiects, to satisfie the pay due to the souldi∣ors for the Persian Warre, which raised these stirres. Yea, the Priests dissuaded the peo∣ple from those new payments, and persuaded them to maintaine their auncient Liber∣ties, shut vp their Meschits, intermitted their Orisons: and the Great Tvrke was forced to call in his Mandats, and deliuer the authors of that counsell (whereof the Beglerbeg of Grecia was one) to the Ianizaries furie, who made Tennis-balls of their heads. In 1592, Wihitz, chiefe Citie of Croatia, was yeelded to the Turke. The next yeare Siseg was besieged, but relieued by the Christians, who slew eighteene thousand Turks, and tooke their Tents; yet was it soone after taken by the renewed forces of the Turkes. Sinan tooke Vesprinium in Hungarie and Palotta, but their losse was farre greater then their gaines; which continuing, and a broile of the Ianizaries added thereto, brought To this A∣murath was M. Harebora her Maiesties Em∣bassado: and after M.Barton: of which, see Hak.to.2. part. 1. There also, pag.293. you may reade of the Turks offi∣cers, reuenues, payments, for∣ces, &c. Also the Letters of the Great Turke to the Queene, and of the Sultan∣esse, and of Sinan Bassa, & many other things worthie obseruation. That Trade into Turkie, then begun, still continu∣eth, renewed by the Kings Maiestie that now is. Amurath into melancholie and sicknesse, whereof he died, Ianuarie 18. 1595. Tran∣syluania, Valachia, and Moldauia hauing before reuolted from him to Sigismund, who was entitled their Prince.
Mahomet his sonne succeeded; who inuiting his nineteene brethren to a Feast, sent them to learne his fathers death in the other world, accompanied thither with tenne of Amuraths women, from whome issue was feared, which with drowning them he pre∣uented. Much adoe he had with his Ianizaries at home, much losse in his dominions abroad, for which cause he sent for Ferat Bassa out of Hungarie, and strangled him, and sent Sinan his emulous corriuall, in his roome, whome the Transyluanian Prince ouerthrew in battaile, and after chased him ouer a Bridge, which he made a myle in length for his Armie to passe ouer Danubius, with great losse of his people. His Bridge the fire and water diuided betwixt them; and the conceit of this ill successe (as was thought) procured his death soone after. In the yeare 1597, Mahomet in his owne person enterprised these warres, and not farre from Agria, on the sixe and twentieth of October, fought a cruell battaile with the Christians, wherein (had not Couetousnesse, rightly called the root of all euill, hindered) had beene atchieued the most glorious victorie against those Barbarians, that euer Christendome was blessed with. Mahomet Mahomets Armie was re∣ported to be 600000 sayth M. Wrag. apud Hakl. to.2. himselfe for feare, seeing his Ordinance (an hundred fourescore and tenne great Peeces) taken, and his men slaine in multitudes, fled with Ibrahim Bassa towards Agria, shedding teares by the way, which he wiped off his blubbered face with a piece of greene Silke, supposed to be a piece of Mahomets garment, carri∣ed with him as a holy Relique. But whiles the Christians were now halfe Conque∣rors, by greedie turning to the spoyle, their victorie was wholly lost, and twentie thou∣sand of them slaine, who had slaine threescore thousand Turkes. Not long after, the Bassa of Buda was taken, and the Bassa of Bosna, with some thousands of Turks slaine, An. 1599. Yet did not all his losses in the West by the Christians vexe the Great Sul∣tan so much, as a rebellion The long and dange∣rous rebellion in Turkey by Cusahin, the Scrivano, &c. See Knol. Tur∣kish Historie. raised in the East, which many yeares continued. Cusahin Bassa of Caramania rose in armes against his Master, and hauing now done great mat∣ters, his souldiors, before false to their Prince, became now also false to him: he fleeing, was after taken and tortured to death. His rebellion out-liued him, and was maintai∣ned by one, called the Scriuano*, who ouerthrew Mehemet Bassa in the field, and the second time, in the yeare 1601, ouerthrew him with his armie of fiftie thousand, and fo∣raged all the Countrey almost as farre as Aleppo, proclaiming himselfe the defendor of the Mahumetane faith, and soone after gaue the Bassa a third ouerthrow. The Turkes Embassadour, sent into Persia to demaund the Sophi's sonne in hostage, for assurance of the peace betweene those two Monarchs, was for his proud message put to the Ba∣stinado, and grieuously threatened, sent backe to the Grand Signior. The Scrivano's proceedings were much furthered by the dissentions betweene the Ianizaries of Alep∣po and Damasco: but death stayed him, not his rebellion, which a younger brother of his prosecuted, against whome Hassan Bassa was sent, but lost himselfe and his Armie. The Rebels besieged Angole, and forced them to giue two hundred thousand duckats to buy their peace. Meane while the Ianizaries, after their insolent maner, in a mutinie forced Mahomet to commit the Capi-Aga, one of his greatest officers, & some others, to whome the successe of these Rebels was imputed, to their cruell execution. The Re∣bels sacked Burze, one of the chiefe Cities, the Turkes Store-house for his warres, and Treasurie for his reuenues; and the great Sbangh of Persia had taken Corberie also from the Turks. The Gouernor of Babylon inclined now also to the rebels. Mahomet, not able with force to preuaile, by faire meanes sought to winne them, and gaue them their demaunds, making Zelalic, one of their Chiefetaines, Bassa of Bosna. Whereupon his men of warre entred into a resolution, to depriue him of the State, and to inuest therewith Mahomet his eldest sonne: about which an Astrologian being consulted, promised all happie successe: (vnhappie foole, that knew not his owne approching ru∣ine, which Mahomet executed on him, together with young Mahomet the Prince, and fiftie other conspirators.) He set forth a fleet of Gallies against the King of Fesse; which, hauing encountred with a tempest, was forced with great losse to retire to their former Port. The chiefe Rebell making shew he would come into Europe, as Zellalie had done, Mahomet sent certaine Gallies to receiue him, but he receiued them, and possessing himselfe of the Gallies, slew the men, and mocked the Sultan. Hassan, a great Bassa, ioyned himselfe
also vnto them, about such time as Tauris Tauris reco∣vered by the Persians. was againe recouered by the Persian. All these disasters draue Mahomet to his deuotions for refuge, accounting these crosses to be inflicted for his sinnes, and therefore appointed publike Prayers in all the Mosques of his dominion, and sent two Priests bare-headed and bare-footed to Mecca, on pil∣grimage, to pray for him. But that Mahomet either had no eares to heare this, or else was so farre entreated, as to be better acquainted with this great Sultan in the place of his eternall residence, whither (about the yeare 1593) Mahomet the Turke Of the dispo∣sition of this Mahomet, his cruelties, for∣ces power, go∣vernment &c. see Soranzo his Ottomannus. was by death soone after sent. His sonne Achmat succeeded; for his eldest was strangled in his sight. He was buried in a faire Chappell by himselfe, for that purpose built about fiftie foot square, with foure Turrets or Steeples: in the middest is his Sepulchre, in a great Coffin of white Marble: his Turbant at his head, two exceeding great candles of White Waxe, standing (but neuer burning) the one at his head, the other at his feet. The Floore is couered with Mats, and faire Carpets on them. Round about are like Tombes for his wiues and children, but not so great and faire. Diuers such Chappels there are neere to the Temple of Sophia as of his father Amurath, with his 45. children, entombed about him, and of the other great Sultans, two Selims, Solyman, Ba∣iazet, Mahomet, each hauing a faire Hospitall for the reliefe of the poore adioyning. Some of the great Bassaes imitate the same. No other Turkes are buried in the Cities, but in the fields, with stones layd ouer, or set vpright, fashioned with some resemblance of the head, which beareth ensigne of his dignitie, and whether it be a man or woman, with letters engrauen further to testifie the same. Achmat Achmat the present Sul∣tan. set a sure guard about his brother, and to preuent the insolencie of the Ianizaries & souldiors, distributed amongst them two millions and a halfe, and being 15. yeares old, was crowned Emperour. He is said in behauior and resemblance much to resemble Mahomet the Great, first Conqueror of Constantinople. At the same time the warres in Transyluania had procured such famine, that roots, herbes, leaues of trees were their food: yea, a mother is said to haue brought back into her wombe (by vnna∣turall meanes satisfying Nature) her sixe children: two men to eat their mother: others to cut downe malefactors from the gallowes, and eat them. Horses, Dogges, Cats, and such like were rarities to the poore, and dainties beyond their reach. And if this State can be made worse, theeues by robberies, & souldiors by continuall spoyles, in taking away their goods, adde to their miseries. Cicala Bassa is sent against the Asian Rebels, and receiueth an ouerthrow: the second time he reneweth his forces, with renewing his fortunes, namely, the losse of 30000 of his men. The Persian recouered the country of Sirvan, and the Citie of Arusta, with the countrey thereabouts, and all that from the daies of Solyman had beene taken from them, except two or three places. Hassan Bassa is sent against the Christians in Hungarie, assisted with the Tartars, alwayes readie to helpe the Turkes, both because they are linked in marriages, like in conditions, and that huge Empire, for want of heire males of the Ottomans, is entailed to the Tartar Cham: pay and spoile are no small motiues also to fetch them into these Expeditions. Cicala Bassa is sent against the Persians, but defeated with all his power by the Persian, who also tooke Bagdat from the Turke. In Hungarie they doe more with their money, to maintaine rebellions, then with open force. In the yere 1605 a tumult arose among the Ianizaries in Constantinople, & 500 shops & ware-houses, with 200 Iewes, and other persons to whom they belonged, were burnt: the Ianizaries enriched thēselues with the spoile. Hungarie is at once vexed with foraine & ciuill warres: the mutinous Christians doing more harme thē the Turkes, and the people flee into Polonia, or the Mountains, for refuge. The rebels take great Towns, yea they spoile Stiria & Austria. The German name growes odious to the Hungarian. Botscay, chiefe of the rebels, is assisted by the Turks, & called Prince of Transyluania, all Hungarie in maner following his ensignes. But the rebels in Asia and the Persian exploits detained the Turks from making vse of these occasions, else likely to haue swallowed Hungarie and Austria both: yet Pesth was before taken by them, & now Strigonium. Cicala Bassa is againe ouerthrowne by the Persian, & with 300 flieth to Adena. The Bassa of Trebezond is sent to succor him, but is discomfited, & almost all his army slain. Achmat enraged, causeth Cicala Bassa's house at Cōstantinople, full of wealth & treasure, to be rifled. Adena is yeelded to the Persian. The Bassa's of Damasco & Aleppo had before falne out, & takē arms, Damasco
had ouerthrowne Aleppo in the field, besieged him, and forced him to composition. Civill warres betweene the Bassa's of A∣leppo and Da∣masco. Now againe, Aleppo ouerthroweth him, & the Bassas of Tripolis and Gazara his com∣panions, with their armie of threescore thousand men; tooke Tripolis, the Basla wher∣of he againe ouerthrew, and added to his garlands Damasco the treasurie of the Turks reuenue, & chiefe City of Syria. The Beglerbeg of Natolia sent his Liefe-tenant with a great armie against him, but to their owne ruine. He intercepted a ship laden with the tributes of Egypt. The Persian sent him, in token of loue, a present worth fifty thousand crownes. Achmat is hereby forced to peace with the Christians, and to recal his forces out of Hungary for this employment. An. 1606. The Emperour yeeldeth satisfaction to the discontents in Hungary, with free vse of Religion to all, and Transyluania to re∣maine to Botscay and his heires male for euer. A fire at Constantinople kindled in a Iewes house by the Tartars, burnt many houses & Iewes, and foure millions of goods. Achmat in great magnificence went to his Moschee, to render thanks to Mahomet for a peace concluded with the Emperour. He now looketh Eastward with his power, and An. 1607. sent the Visier Bassa with an hundred and thirty thousand against the rebels, who preuaileth more by discreete appeasing of them, then by force. The Basla of Alep∣po three times withstood his whole forces; the fourth time fleeth towards Persia with his treasure. Aleppo is left to be taken, and the Garrison put to the sword: But the Bas∣sa himself obtained pardon, with restitution of his goods taken from him in Syria. An∣other fire arose at Constantinople, and consumed two millions of goods. The Duke of Florence doth much harme to the Turkes by the sea, 1608. The rebels make new com∣motions in Asia. Matthias the Arch-Duke standeth out with his forces against the Emperour, and commeth with his armie toward Prage, obtaineth the crowne and roy∣alties of Hungarie by composition, comes King to Vienna; but the Protestants refuse to sweare alleageance, till free vse of Religion in Austria by King Matthias was gran∣ted. He was crowned at Presburg. Sultan Achmet is now An. 1612. foure and twentie yeares old: of good stature, strong and actiue more then any of his Court. He hath three thousand concubines and virgins for his lust: his eldest son is about seuen yeares old: he is much delighted with pleasures of the field, for which in Graecia and Natolia he hath forty thousand Falco∣ners, his Hnnts-men are not much fewer. And whereas their religion binds them once euery day to practise some manuall trade, as his father did making of arrowes: this Sul∣tan euery morning after his deuotions, maketh horne-rings, which they weare on their thumbes for the better drawing of their bowes. Eight thousand persons are alway re∣sident in his Palace. His officers The cheefe officers of the Turks and his other instru∣ments of pri∣vate and pub∣lique service. are the Capi, Aga, by whom he speaks to such as haue suites to him; Treasurer of the houshold, Cup-bearer, Steward, Ouerseer of his women, and principal Gardner. These six are in great place: he hath Mutes (persons borne deaf and dumbe) which attend him; he hath fifteene hundred gelded men, from whom their priuities are wholly cut, and they make water through short quills of siluer, which to that end they weare on their Turbants. His Visier Bassas, or Priuy-counsellors, where∣of there are nine at Constantinople, and were wont to be much fewer, are now thirty. The rest of thē are in their charges or Beglerbegs places abroad. They sit euery Satur∣day, Sunday, Munday, and Tuesday, in the Diuano or Counsel-hall. The Aga is Captain of the Ianizaries. The Chiauses are his Pursiuants. The Spahi his guard of horse-men. The Ianizaries are his best foot-men, who in their child-hood are taken from their pa∣rents, & brought vp in all hardnes, and in the rules of their religion. Then are they put to schooles, where vnder most seuere masters they are taught the vse of diuers wea∣pons, & such as proue fit are enrolled for Ianizaries. Of whom in al are forty thousand, and about sixteene thousand with their Aga, attend the Grand Seignior his person at Constantinople, where they are employed as Constables, Clerkes of the Market, war∣ders of the gates, Sergeants for arrests, to guard Embassadors, & other offices. He hath also in pay others called Topegi, six thousand, which are gunners; and twelue thousand Gebegi, which haue charge of the powder and shot in the armies. He hath Seminaries for the training vp of those yonglings, the one sort of which are called Ieheoglani, whereof are fiue thousand, which neuer goe out of the Seraglio in sixteene or twentie yeares, neuer see any but their officers, where they are trained vp to future seruice. The Gemoglani (who are also tithed children of the Christians) are brought vp
with some more liberty, and to base offices of husbandry and such like, and may also proue Ianizaries. Of these are twentie thousand. The Ianizaries and tithed children, with his Timariots, are the maine pillars of his Empire. His Timariots, which hold land in Fee to maintaine so many horse-men in his seruice, are in Europe two hundred fifty seuen thousand; in Asia and Africa, foure hundred sixtie two thousand. Beglerbeg signi∣fieth LORD of LORDS; of which were wont to be two; one in Europe; another in Asia: but by Soliman encreased, that though Romania & Natolia haue still the chiefe titles, yet in Europe are foure others; in Asia before these Persian warres, nine and twentie, in Africa foure, in all nine and thirty, which are as Vice-royes and haue their Begs or Sanzackes vnder them. His Admirals place is as great by sea. And thus much of Tur∣kish affaires, the summe of the large worke of M. Knolles, whom I principally follow. CHAP. X. Of the Opinions holden by the Turkes in their Religion. HOw the Turkes from so small beginnings haue aspired to this their pre∣sent greatnes you haue seene; bought indeede at a deare price, with their temporall dominions accepting of a spirituall bondage, becomming the Lords of many countries, and withall made subiect to those many Mahumetan superstitions. The occasion & chiefe cause of sects in the Saracenicall deuotions ye haue heard in the fourth and seuenth Chapters: to which we may adde here out of Obser.l.3.c.4. Bellonius. He saith, that besides the Alco∣ran they haue another booke called Zuna, that is, the Way, or Law, or Councel of Ma∣homet, written after his death by his disciples. But the readings therof being diuers and corrupt, the Caliph assembled a generall Councell of their Alphachi, or learned men at Damasco, wherein six Commissioners were appointed, namely, Muszlin, Bochari, Bu∣borayra, Annecey, Atermindi, and Dent, to view and examine these bookes, each of which composed a booke, and those six books were called Zuna; the other copies be∣ing two hundred Camels-lading, were drowned in the riuer; those six only made au∣thenticall, esteemed of equall authoritie among the Turks, with the Alcoran, and after by one of their Diuines contracted into an Epitome; which booke was called the booke of flowers. But this Zuna being not Vna (one as the Truth is) but full of con∣trarietie, hence haue arisen sects amongst them; the Turkes differing from other Ma∣humetan nations, and diuided also amongst themselues. Anthony Menau.lib.1.Andr.Arvi.G.Biddulph. Menauinus (who liued a long time in the Turkish Court) saith that the booke of their Law is called Musaph or Curaam, which Georgionitz reckoneth ano∣the booke; not the Alcoran, but perhaps some Glosse, orsome Extract thereof in Ara∣bian, which they hold vnlawfull to translate into the vulgar. They haue it in such reue∣rence, that they will not touch it, except they be washed from top to toe: and it is read in their Churches by one with a loud voice; the people giuing deuout attendāce with∣out any noise: nor may the Reader hold it beneath his girdle-stedde; and after he hath read it, he kisseth it, and toucheth his eyes with it, and with great solemnitie it is carri∣ed into the due place. Out of this booke are deriued eight principall commandements of their Law. The first is, GOD is a great GOD, and one only GOD, and Mahomet is the Prophet of GOD: this article of the Vnitie (they thinke) maketh against vs, who beleeue a Trinity of Persons: in detestation wherof, they often reiterate these words, hu, hu, hu, that is, he, he, he, is only GOD, who is worthy to be praised for their limbs, health, &c. & for that he hath prouided sustenance for euery one forty yeares before his birth. The second Commandement is, Obey thy parents, and doe nothing to displease them in word or deed: they much feare the curses of thier parents. 3. Doe vnto others, as thou wouldest be done vnto. 4. That they repaire to the Meschit or Church at the times appointed: of which after. 5. To fast one month of the yeare, called Remezan or Ramadan. 6. that they giue almes to the poore liberally and freely. 7. To marry at con∣uenient age, that they may multiply the sect of Mahomet. 8. Not to kill. Of these com∣mandements is handled at large in Menauine, and in the booke Policie of the Turkish Empire. Biddulph. of the Policie of the Turkish Empire, and in others.
Their times of prayer, according to the fourth Precept, are beme say that the rks n we to re∣sort to their o∣r but three   day, and P i ay soure, omitting that in the night. Bbeq. . they measure the time of prayer by houre-glas∣ses of water. in the morning, called Salanamazzi, before Sunne rising: the second at noone, called Vlenamazzi. (On the Friday they pray sixe times, resorting to their Church two houres before noone) the third, about three houres before Sunne set, called Inchindinamazzi. The fourth at Sunne set, Ascannamazzi. The fifth, two houres within night, before they goe to sleepe. They which meane to goe to prayer, goe first to the house of office, and there purge their bodie: they wash their priuie parts; & then going thence, wash their hands, their mouth, their nose, their countenance, and their wrists, each of them three times, and after their eares and neckes, saying a certaine Psalme, and then wash their feet to the mid-legge, saying another Psalme: and after all this, with a graue pace, walke to Church; without these washings they hold their prayers vnprofitable. Septemcastren∣sis saith, that for this cause of washing, they cut their nailes, and all their haire; except on their heads and beards (which yet they combe, and bestow curious paines about, that the water may haue free passage to all parts) yea for this cause hee thinketh they obserue Circumcision, that nothing be left couered and vnwashed. They haue three kinds of washings: the first of all the bodie, no part being left free, called Zeoagg∣meg, which is necessarie after any pollution. The second is called Tachriat, of the pri∣uities and hinder parts after stoole, vrine, or breaking of winde. The third, Aptan, or Abdas, in the instruments of the fiue senses, beginning at the hands, from thence the wrists to the elbow; then the mouth and nosthrills; then all the face with the eyes; then the eares, and from thence to the feet, which hee washeth as high as the ankles. This is not necessarie before euery prayer, except some vncleannesse happen, but may serue for all day. Their Almes, enioyned in the sixth Commandement, are publike or priuate. Their publike almes is a sacrifice or offering of some beast once euery yeare. For whereas of old they should haue giuen a certaine pension of money to the poore, namely, two in the hundreth: Mahomet vpon their complaint eased this heauie burthen, and conuer∣ted it into this sacrifice. This beast must be cut in peeces, and giuen to the poore: nei∣ther must they themselues eate of it, yet may each man eate of his neighbours offering, and this sacrifice ought to be of the fairest and best, Horse, Veale, or Mutton. The place for this sacrifice is called Canaara: where are many Butchers, which, cutting the throat thereof, say; In the name of him which hath made heauen and earth, and all things else; this sacrifice bee to his honor and worshippe, and let his infinite bountie accept the same. They vse the like vpon occasion of vowes, if any of their house be sicke. As for their priuate almes, they hold it necessarie: hauing a vaine con∣ceit, that it freeth them from all imminent miserie, which (they say) together with the almes, turneth from them to the poore man; whence it commeth that the poore are so full of diseases. But for all this charitable Precept, many poore people die amongst them for want of reliefe: and Biddulph. if the poore pay not their head money to the King year∣ly, they are beaten, and their women and children sold to pay it. Mariage ought to be sought (they say) for procreation, not for lust. Menavino. They which liue vnmarried (after fit time, which is about fiue and twentie yeares of age) are not iust, nor please GOD. Their Law enioyneth them to performe their marriage-ceremo∣nies, with prayers, and prayses, and modest shamefastnesse; and they ought to learne each other to reade, if either partie be ignorant. But their marriage is now farre dege∣nerate from that ancient simplicitie: The Turks can marry and vnmarry thē∣selues at their pleasure. For if a man like a yong woman, he buyeth her of her father, and then enrolleth her in the Cadies booke; the marriage following with all Bacchanall solemnities. The father giueth only some peeces of houshold with her, carried openly by particulars through the streets. When he disliketh any of his wiues, he selleth them, or giueth them to his men-slaues. They sit not at table with their hus∣bands, but waite and serue them; and then they dine by themselues, admitting no man or mankind with them aboue twelue yeares old. And they neuer go abroad with∣out leaue, except to the Bath, and on Thursday to weepe at the graues of the dead: Septemcas. bequ. Epist. They rise to their husbands, and stand while they are in presence; and besides them, come in no company of men, nor do they speake with a man, or in any part of their
bodie are seene of any man; because they thinke sight, especially where beautie or comelinesse is, cannot be without sinne. Onely the brother may bee permitted to see the sister, but not the husbands brother. For this cause that sexe is not suffered to buy and sell, but is closely mewed, saue that their law alloweth them to frequent the pub∣like Bathes. The wife and concubine differ in the right to a dowrie, which the later wanteth: but the wife must cause the other to be her husbands fellow, when he com∣mandeth, without gain-saying, except on their Sabbath, or Friday night, which is the wiues peculiar. Yet are the Turks giuen in both sexes to vnnaturall lust (in these times) euen the women in publike Bathes, sometimes are so enflamed in that filthinesse, as is intollerable. Busbequius tells of one woman, which falling in loue with a yong maid, and no way else preuailing, clothed her selfe in mans apparell, and hiring a house neere, procured the fathers good-will to haue that his daughter in marriage; which being so∣lemnised betweene them, and the truth discouered (which the blacke mantle of night could not couer from Hymenaeus) complaint was made, and the Gouernour quenched the hot flames of this new bridegrome, causing her to be drowned for that offence. If the man abuse the wife to vnnaturall lust, she may haue her remedie by diuorce, if she accuse her husband; which modestie forbids to bee done in words, and therefore shee puts off her shooe, and by inuerting the same, accuseth her husbands peruerse∣nesse. Murther (prohibited in their eight Commandement) they hold vnpardonable, if it be done wilfully. Often will the Turkes brawle, but neuer in priuate quarels strike one another, for feare of this law, and the seueritie of the Magistrate. And if one be found dead in a street or house, the master of the house, or the parish, must find out the mur∣therer; otherwise he hmselfe shall be accused of it, and the whole Contado shall be fi∣ned, and likewise in case of robbery. Menauinus reckoneth also seuen mortall sinnes; Pride, Auarice, Lecherie, Wrath, Enuie, Sloth, and Gluttonie. The first, they say, cast Lucifer out of heauen. The second is the roote of many other sinnes. The third is most rise amongst them, and that in the most filthie and vnnaturall kind of Sodomie; their law to the contrarie notwithstan∣ding. The fourth maketh a man a beast. The fifth shutteth men out of Paradise, and so forth of the rest. Wine Drinking of Greeke Wine is too sweete a sinne for the Turks to for∣beare. is also forbidden them; but yet they will be drunke with it, if they can get their fill of it. And Mahomet the third (Anno 1601) imputing di∣uers insolencies of the Ianizaries to their excessiue drinking of wine (by the Mufti's perswasion) commanded on paine of death, all such in Constantinople and Pera, as had wine, to bring it out and staue it (except Embassadors only) so that the streetes ranne therewith. One drinking A. Gis. Busb. epist.1. wine with Busbequius, made great clamors; being asked the cause, he said he did it to warne his soule to flee into some corner of the bodie, or else be quite gone, lest it should be polluted with that sinne. Yet in their Fast or Lent, they abstaine very religiously. Villamont. If it be proued against a Priest, that he hath drunke wine but once, he shall neuer be beleeued as a witnesse after it. Swines flesh is prohibited too; in abstaining from which they are more obedient; it being vtterly abhorred. The Turkes The Turkes are no fashion∣mongers. generally hate (saith Septemcastrensis) that lightnesle in apparell, speech, gesture, &c. vsed of the Christians, whom for this cause they call Apes and Goats. Likewise they are not sumptuous in their priuate buildings. They goe to the warre, as it were to a wedding, esteeming them blessed which are therein slaine. The wiues and women-seruants agree in one house, without iealousie and grudging, they are in their habite and behauiour modest: and, where he himselfe dwelt, the father in law had not seene the face of his daughter in law, liuing in the same house with him, in twentie yeares space; so religiously doe they veile themselues. On Friday they pray more deuoutly, but (as the Alcoran also permitteth) they ab∣staine not from all labour. He saw the grand Signor himselfe goe to their Church, and likewise to the Bath, attended only with two youthes; none vsing any acclamation to him. And in the Church he prayed on the pauement couered with a carpet, like to the rest, without any throne or ensigne of royaltie. And he obserued the like modestie in his other behauiour.
The Turkes are so zealous in their superstition, that they will rather lose their life then religion: as among other examples in Scanderbegs time at Dibra, many Turkes chose rather to die Turkes, then to liue Christians; yea some, as it is reported, rather to kill themselues, then to leaue their superstition: and in the yeare 1568. the Persian Embassador was shot at, and one of his followers hurt by a Turke, who being appre∣hended, confessed that he did it because he was an Heretike, and sent from an Here∣tike: for which fact he was drawne at an horse-tayle thorow the Citie, and then had his right hand cut off, and after his head. They hate the Persians, as Rustan Bassa told Busbequius, more then they doe the Christians: like as the Traditionary Iew doth the Textuarie, and the Papist the Protestant. Busbeq.epist.3. Images they haue in such detestation, that (besides the scratching out the eyes of those in the Musaique worke of Saint Sophies Temple) when Salomon ouerthrew King Lewis of Hungary, he carried away three Images of cunning worke in brasse, repre∣senting Heroules with his Club, Apollo with his Harpe, Diana with her Bow and Qui∣uer, and placed them in the tilt-yard at Constantinople: but by the perswasion of the Mufti, they were molten into great ordnance. They haue no Scutchions or blazing of annes: nay, they vse no seales in their letters or other writings, which seeme to them to sauour of superstition, or superfluitie. When they conquer any Citie, they turne the Temples into Mosques, and sacrifice there. Thus did Solyman Knolli. at Buda, and Amurath sacrificed sixe hundred captiues to his fathers ghost. They are moderate in their priuate buildings, and detest Septemcast. the Christians for their ex∣cesse and superfluous expences that way: What (say they) doe those Pagans thinke they shall liue euer? they often lodge (saith Voyag. du vil∣lamont. l.3.c.6. Villamont) at the signe of the Moone; and the like moderation they vse in diet and apparell. They haue a brasse-pot, and their other meane houshold implements with them in the warres, which they vse in peace. Rea∣die money is their surest riches, because the Grand Signior is their surest heire. They haue the rising of the Sunne in great reuerence; and especially the appearing of the new Moone: as Knol. pa.421: when Mahomet the great besieged Scodra, the new Moone beginning to shew herselfe, the Mahumetan Priests, going about the armie, gaue the souldiers warning thereof, as their manner is, by singing of a song in manner of a Pro∣cession; whereunto the whole armie answered with a short respond, and at the same time bowing themselues to the ground, saluted the Moone with great superstition. They may Sepst. haue twelue lawfull wiues, and as many concubines as they will (some say, but foure wiues.) The children of the one are equally legitimate as well as the o∣ther, and inherit alike: yet few of them keepe two wiues together in one house: but in seuerall places where they haue dealings, they haue seuerall wiues, which they di∣uorce at pleasure. They referre all things, that fall out well, vnto GOD, be they neuer so vngratiously begunne; measuring things by the successe. They tell many things of Antichrist (whom they call Leunclau. saith Degnal. Tethschel) and of the resurrection, and of the last Iudgement, of hell, and Purgatorie: And that Mahomet after Iudgement shall deliuer all of all religions from thence. They haue no knowledge of liberall Arts, of cases of conscience, of Originall sin, or of actuall, further then the outward act. Their respects to reliques appeareth by Mahomet Knol. the third, 1597. who in the discomfiture of his armie fled towards Agria, shedding some teares as he went, and wiping his eyes with a peece of Mahomets garment, which he carried about him as a relique. The Turkes may neither eate, drinke, nor make water, standing. In their aduersitie they seeke with earnest prayers to their Prophets; and publike supplications are sometimes decreed. At Knol. pa.1136. the taking of Alba Regalis, 1601. the Bas∣sa of Buda (then prisoner at Vienna) hearing of it, abstained from meet with his two seruants a whole day, prostrate vpon his face, praying vnto his Prophet Mahomet,
who he said had beene angrle all that yeare with the Turkes. They Busbeq. endure punish∣ments inflicted by the Magistrate with great patience, thinking they shall escape all torment in those parts in the world to come: they therefore reward the whipper, and esteeme the whip (which I enuy not to them) sacred. They are (but contrary to the Alcoran) addicted to sorceries and dreames: their Priests write them letters or spells, to keepe them from danger and harme of shot, &c. called Septemcast. Haymayly. They will write any thing for money, as letters of free∣dome for seruants to runne away from their Masters, and such like. They make a shew of holinesse, but are closely wicked, ignorant of their owne law (to couer which, they answere in darke sentences) and the people much more. Nothing is sinne, to count of, but that which endamageth ciuill societie. They esteeme for good workes, Their good workes. the buildings and endowings of Hospitals, ma∣king bridges and high-wayes, digging of pits, and welles, and conueying waters to high-wayes and Cities, building Bathes, and founding of Churches, and such like publike workes. Rostan M. Harborn. Bassa left his wife, the daughter of Soliman, at his death fif∣teene millions of gold, and she had of yearely reuenue halfe a million: she, amongst o∣ther her workes, attempted one most famous, which was a conduit to conuey water, for the vse of the Pilgrims betwixt Cairo and Mecca, fortie dayes iourney; and for the same intent procured the Sultan Selym her brother, to write to the Venetians for a li∣cence to extract out of Italy an hundred thousand pound of steele, onely to make Chissels, Hammers, and Mattockes, for the cutting of certaine rockes, by which this water must passe. Their Their oathes and vowes oathes (especially of their Emperours) are of many cuttes, and varietie of fashion. And for vowes; in necessities and dangers; they will promise vnto GOD the sacrifices of beasts in some holy places, not vpon Altars, but Andr. Art∣uabene. hauing flaide off the skinne, they giue it with the head, feete, and fourth part of the flesh to the Priest; another part to the poore; the third to the neighbours; the fourth is for the guests. They are so addicted to the opinion of Fate, that GOD is esteemed to blesse what∣soeuer hath successe, as namely, Selims murthering his father; and to detest what wan∣teth good euent, whatsoeuer ground it had. They feare not the Plague, accounting e∣uery mans time limited by fate, and therefore will wipe their faces with the cloathes of such as haue died thereof. They hold Munster Cos. lib.4. Bush.ep.3.& 4. it alike acceptable to GOD, to offer almes to beasts, and to bestow it on men, when it is offered for the loue of GOD. Some there are, which will redeeme birds, imprisoned in their cages or coupes, and hauing paid their price, let them flie. Others (for the loue of GOD) cast bread into the water to feed the fishes, esteeming it a worke greatly meritorious; but dogges are accounted vncleane, in stead whereof they delight in cats, following (they say) their Prophet Mahomet, who falling asleepe at table, and awaking to goe to his deuotions, rather cut off his sleeue, whereon hee found his cat fast asleepe, then he would disturbe her sleeping. They say Moses was the first great Prophet, to whom was giuen the booke Tefrit, that is, the Law, and they which obserued it in those times were saued. But when men grew corrupt, GOD gaue Dauid the booke Czabur, or the Psalter: and when this pre∣uailed not, IESVS was sent with the booke Ingil, or the Gospell, wherby in that time men were saued. Lastly, Mahomet receiued his Alcoran, and all the former were disa∣nulled. This Law and Law-giuer is so sacred to them, that in all their prayers, euen from their mothers breasts, they obserue this forme: La illah, illelah Mahemmet irre∣sullellah tanre rirpeghamber hace: That is, there is no GOD but one, and Mahomet his Prophet: one Creator, and more Prophets. This they sucke in with their milke, and in their first learning to speak lispe out this deuotion. The infants go with the rest to their Mosquees or Meschits; but are not tied to other ceremonies, sauing washing, till they are circumcised. Euery man Ant. Menau. hath (in their opinion) from his birth to his death two Angels attending him; the one at his right hand, the other at his left. At foure or fiue
yeare olde they send him to the schoole to learne the Soranz cal the Turkish law-book Mus∣chaph, which, saith he, is cal∣led of the Ara∣bians Alcoran, euen as we for excellencie terme the scrip∣ture; and the Hebrewes, K∣ra: besides the Alcoran they had their other bookes of de∣uotion, as Zu∣na, and haply this Curaam, collected out of the Alcoran. Curaam, and the first words which their Masters teach them are to this sense; GOD is one, and is not contained in any place, but is through all, and hath neither father nor mother nor chil∣dren, eateth not, nor drinketh, nor sleepeth, and nothing is like to him. The two Angels beforesaid, are called Chiramim and Chiraetibin, which write the good or euill that men doe against the day of iudgement. The Turkes Magini Geogr. abhorre blasphe∣mie not onely against GOD and Mahumet, but also against CHRIST and the Virgin MARY, and other Saints: and they punish blasphemers of whatsoeuer Sect: they account it a sinne for a man to build a house which shall last longer then a mans life: and therefore howsoeuer they are sumptuous and magnificent in their publique buildings, yet are there priuate dwellings very homely, and ill con∣triued. They eate much Opium, thinking it maketh them couragious in the warres. They Voyages du Villamoat.l 30 c 6. haue a remedie for paine in the head or elsewhere, to burne the part affected with the touch-boxe (which they alway carry with them,) or with some linnen cloth whereby they haue many markes on their foreheads and temples, witnesses of their needelesse and heedlesse respect to Physitians. As the Scripture containeth some prophecies . Brightman et sere omnes qui in Apoc. com∣ment. ediderunt. of the arising and proceedings of the Turkish Nation, the rod of GOD, whereby hee scourgeth his Christian peo∣ple; so haue they also prophecies amongst themselues of their end and ruine, when GOD in his mercie to Christians shall execute iustice vpon the Turkes, and cast the rodde into the fire, wherewith hee had chastised his Children. Such an one is that which Georgiovitz Bart.Georg. Italice, & Latine apud Lonic cru to.1.l.3. & An∣glicè.ap.Fox. Act. & Mon. to. 1. in fine. translateth and expoundeth: and such is that which Hist. Musul. l.15. Leuncla∣ius hath transcribed out of their Booke called Messabili, wherein is written that Con∣stantinople shall be twice taken before Degnall Lain, that is, the Cursed Antichrist, shall come; once by the Sword, another time by the force of the prayers of the sonnes of Isahac. Lain Phil Caiera∣rius Medit. Hist. Cent.3.c.10. is an Epithete which they giue to Degnal, signifying wic∣ked or mischeeuous. Of this Degnal the Turkes Fable, that before his comming, shall Mechdi enioy the Empire. This Mechdi they say Hist Musul.l.16. was descended of their pro∣phet Mahumot, and walketh inuisible: one day hee shall come into light, and raigne for a time: and after him shall Dagnal their Anti-prophet, or Antichrist come. A certaine Deruise offered to assault and murther Baiazet the Great Turke, prosessing himselfe to be that Mechdi, and was slaine by one of the Bassa's. As for the bloudy practises which each Emperour vseth in murthering his bre∣thren to secure him in his throne, in rooting out of the Nobilitie of the countreys which they conquer, in rasing the walles and fortresses of the cities, least they should bee receptacles for conspiracie, in translating people from one countrey to another, in turning the countreyes into Timars, or erecting fees and tenures of land to holde in seruice of the Turke in his warres; whereby without any charge to him he maintaineth more horsemen in continuall pay and readinesse then all the Princes Christian: also of their Court, Seraile, manner of gouernement by Vezier Bassas Beglerbegs, Siniacks, &c. Of the Turkish Nauies reuenues & other things: (not concer∣ning their Religion, but their policie) I hold it not sutable to our scope and argu∣ment. Others in diuers languages haue done it in set treatises and discourses. I there∣fore (leauing these things to Laz. Soranz Ottoman. Knoll. Tur. Hist.&c. others) from this relation of their opinions, will come to the publike exercise and practise of their Religion.
CHAP. XI. Of the religious places amongst the Turkes: their Meschits, Hospitalls and Monasteries: with their Liturgie and Circumcision. THE places The policie of the Turkish Empire. of most religion to the Turkes abroad are those which Mahumet himselfe polluted with his irreligion: as Mecca, Medi∣na, &c. The places of most religion amongst themselues are their Mosches, or Meschits: that is, their Temples and houses of prayer, (whereof they haue many in all Turkie) and next therevnto their Hospitals for the reliefe of the poore, impotent, and pilgrims. Nei∣ther are the Turkes sparing in these or the like (seeming) charitable expences. For vvhen a Turke falleth sicke, and thinketh hee shall thereof die, he sends for his friends and kinsfolkes, and in their presence maketh his Testament: the greatest Legacies whereof are bequeathed to publike vses, which they thinke will be meritorious to their soules. Such are the making and repairing of Bridges, Causeyes, Conduits to conuay wa∣ter to their Hospitals or Temples. Some also giue to the Redemption of Captiues. Many of their women (the deuouter sexe, whether in Religion or superstition) be∣queath money to be distributed amongst such souldiours as haue slaine any certaine number of Christians: a deede in their conceite very religious. These are the wils and deeds of the inferiour sort. But the Emperours, and great Bassa's, appoint Legacies to expresse a greater magnificence with their deuotion, as the building of Temples and Hospitals. Their Temples or Meschites are for the most part foure square, not much vnlike to our Churches, but larger in length then bredth. The Temple of Saint Sophie in Con∣stantinople is of all other in the Turkes Dominion the most admirable, built long since by Iustinian, and (by Mahumet the conquerour) peruerted to this Mahumetan vse aboue nine hundred yeares after. Of this Temple they write, Pet. Gyllius: Topographia Constantinop.l.2.c.3. that it was first built by Constantius, sonne of Constantine the Great, with a roofe of Timber: and burnt by the Arians in the time of Great Theodosius, who againe repaired it. So∣zomenus Sozom.l.8.c.22. saith, that in the broiles which happened not long after in the raigne of Arcadins and Honorius about Chrysostome, the Church was fired, his enemies a∣scribing it to his partakers, and they againe to his Aduersaries. It is reported that Theodosius Iunior rebuilt it. But in the time of Iustinian, Procopins Procop.de Ae∣disicijs Iustiniani l.1. testifieth, that base and wicked men burnt it againe, which Iustinian built a-new in such sump∣tuous and magnificent fort, that in regard of his change it might haue beene wi∣shed that it had perished long before. His chiefe workemen vvere Anthemius, and Isidorus, vvho raised it into a most goodly frame, which might amaze the beholders, and seeme incredible to the hearers. Both he and Euagrius Euag.Hist. Ec. elesiast.l.4.c.30. recite the particulars. The length was two hundred and threescore feete: the bredth one hundred and fifteene: the height a hundred and fourescore. Zonaras, Agathias, and Georgius Cedrinus tell of the harmes it receiued by Earth-quakes, whiles Iu∣stinian liued, which yet hee repaired, as did Basilius and Andronicus after him. Nicephorus iceph. Ec.hist.l.9.c.9. saith, that Constantine raised the Temple of Peace (which before was but small) to that large and stately greatnesse, which in his daies it retained: and his sonne Constantius finished the Temple of Sophia so neere it, that they seemed to haue but one wall. It was Niceph.l.17.c.10. founded by Constantine his Father: and was burnt in a se∣dition of the people, in the raigne of Iustinian, in which rebellion thirtie thousand of the people were slain, & partly to pacifie the wrath of God (saith he) for so great a slaughter, he built this temple. Frō the side of the temple he tooke Suidas in Verbo Eopla. foure hundred twenty & seuen
pillars on an image of heathen Gods, and of twelue signes of the Zodiake: and foure∣score Statues of Christian Emperours, which hee distributed in the Citie. But more then enough of the auncient structure thereof. As it is at this day, diuers haue described it: but of them all most diligently, Petrus P.Gyl.Topog. Consi.l.2.4. Menanino. Policie of the T.E.Bellonius and others. Gillius. The walles and roofes thereof are of Bricke, the inner part lined with Marble most excellent, & of diuers sorts, the roofe is set with stones, and peeces of glasse gilded: Nature and Arte conspiring to breede the beholders both pleasure and wonder. It is so composed, and the Pillars and Arches so placed, that the middle ile within (considered by it selfe) seemes like the forme of an Egge, long and round: but the whole fabricke both within and without, yeeldeth to the curious obseruer a square forme. All the inner part hath Arches, (in the top open to receiue light) which are sustained with Marble Pillars of diuers colours, and there are, saith Bellonius, (if one may say it) as many doores in that Temple, as are daies in the yeare. It is farre more admirable then the Romane Pantheon: The worke of that being grosse, solid, and easie for a workeman to conceiue, But this Sophian Temple is more subtle to the view of the eye and minde. It hath two rowes of Pillars each ouer other, those vp∣per ones supporting the hemisphere loouer or steeple, which is wrought all vvith Musaike worke, garnished with golde and azure. The Doores or Gates are couered with fine Latten of Corinth: one of which (they imagine) was made of the wood of Noahs Arke. And therefore there are in it three places left vncouered for the deuouter people to kisse, for the pardon of their sinnes. It had sometimes aboue three hun∣dred thousand ducats of yearely reuenue. The Turkes, when they turkeised it, threw downe the Altars, turned the bels into great ordinance, and either tooke away the images, or put out their eies, for (say they) GOD, and not walles and pictures, is to be adored. Nicolas N.N. Pere∣grination.l.2.c.10. Nicolay saith that it had in compasse more then a mile, within which were comprehended the houses of Canons and Priests: of the most part of the Cloister (because it was neere the Seraile) they Bellon. made a stable for horses; as Constantines palace for Elephants; and a Temple (neere the Tilt-yard, or Hippodromus) for wilde beastes, which are tied to the seuerall pillars thereof, Lions, Beares, Wolues, wilde Asses, Ounces, &c. No Christian may enter into this Meschit, but hee may put his bodie in at the doores and view it. There haue been at once, in the time of Ba∣iazet, numbred three hundred and threescore thousand Turkes assembled for deuo∣tion at an Easter-solemnitie. It had in Iustinians time porches or Galleries on both sides, one of vvhich it seemeth fell by some earthquake. The innumerable windowes and vnspeakeable ornaments of the Temple would easily detaine our pen as a willing prisoner in the relation thereof. But besides the auncient, P. Gillius, Menauinus, Bellonius, Nicolay, and many others haue done it alreadie: neither will my Pilgrimage suffer mee to stay long in one place, which am to visite so ma∣ny, both heere and elsewhere in the vvorld. Let vs proceede therefore to their o∣ther temples. Mahumet the conquerour N.Nicolay. built one in like fashion without any figures, which hath about a hundred houses couered with Lead for their Doctors and Priests, and for all strangers and pilgrims of any Nation or religion, where they may refresh themselues, their seruants, and horses for three daies, with meate and lodging at free cost. There are also without the precinct of the Mosche a hundred and fifty other Tenements for the poore of the Citie, which haue there an asper a day, and as much bread as they neede: but they account that kinde of life so vnhappy, that oftentimes those Tene∣ments stand empty: but the money which should this way bee bestowed is sent to the Hospitals of the diseased. There are also fiue other Meschits, in former resembling the former, but not so great nor so rich. The rest Pol. of the T.E. of the Meschits are of diuers sorts, some high, some lowe, of seuerall fashions. The Turrets, vpon which their Priestes call the people to prayers, are of a great height made in manner of watch-towers; their greater Churches hauing two, the lesser one of them. Vpon the tops is set an halfe Moone or Crescent: which is the Turkes ensigne, as the Crosse is vsuall to the Christians. Within their Temples they haue no kinde of ornaments, but are walles,
with Arabian Letters (some in golde) written thereon, saue onely their bookes, and Lampes burning with Oile in great abundance, and clothes of Tapestry, on the which being spread ouer Mattes vpon the pauement, they prostrate themselues in prayer time. Their Hospitals they call Imarets: of these there are great vse, because they want Innes in the Turkish dominions. They found them for the reliefe of the poore, and of Trauellers, where they haue foode allowed them (differing according to the vse of the place) and lodging places, without beds. They are open for the most part to all men of all religions. The chiefe Hospitals in Turkie, are in Constantinople: two of which Mahomet and Baiazet his sonne founded. Both these haue about fiue & twen∣tie round Turrets couered with Lead; one of which, being in the middest of the other, is larger and greater then the rest, and vnder are lodgings for the Priests: On one side are beds for Pilgrims and Trauellers, on the other for Lepers. Thrice a day may any man resort thither into a certaine place for meate. There are maintained fourteene Do∣ctors of their lawe. Some say that the reuenues of Mahomets Hospitall amounteth to a hundred and fiftie thousand ducats, and the other as much or more. Each of which hath a little Chappell adioining, in which the founders are buried: who were at this grear charge, that the Priests and such as are there refreshed should pray for their soules and say, Alla Rehfmetileson: that is, GOD haue mercy on them. Selim finished that which Baiazet his father had begunne to build. But his sonne Soliman erected one farre surpassing the former. Orchanes was the first of these Ottoman Princes which founded Monasteries. Mahumet the first finished Knoll. Tur∣kish Hist. the great Temple at Hadria∣nople, the seate Royall of the Turkes in Europe before Constantinople vvas wonne. Hee built also, besides a palace, another Temple with a most sumptuous Abbey, and a publike schoole adioining, endowing the same with great reuenues. Hee also gaue great summes of money to bee distributed yearely at Mecca and Medi∣na, for the reliefe of poore Pilgrims. Whosoeuer will reade of the Temples, Hospitals, Col∣ledges, &c. founded by their Kings, let him reade Le∣unclau. at the end of the life of euery Sul∣tan, in the end of his seuerall bookes, where he relateth them at large. Hist Musulman. l.18. Soliman erected, in memoriall of Mahu∣met his eldest sonne, a stately Toombe, a sumptuous Church, a Monasterie and Colledge, with other things for the health of his soule. Hee vvas buried himselfe in a Chappell which hee had in his life time built most stately with a Colledge and Hospitall, and his wife Roxolana and some of his murthered children lying intom∣bed by him: his Scimatar also hanging by him, in token that hee died in warres, which honour they graunt not otherwise to their Princes. The reuenues of the countrey about Sigeth in Hungarie (lately wonne from the Christians) vvere gi∣uen to the maintenance of those houses vvhich his deuotion had founded. Nei∣ther is it lawfull for them to conuert any Lands to such sacred vses, except they haue first vvith their owne sword vvonne them from the enemies of their re∣ligion; the most acceptable seruice to their Prophet. And therefore Selym the se∣cond, sonne and successour of Soliman, intending to build a magnificent Temple, and munificent Colledge, Monasterie and Almes-house at Hadrianople, vvhere hee intended his Sepulcher, brake his league with the Venetians and wanne Cy∣prus from them, that thence hee might endow the same with maintenance. But it were tedious to insist further in declaring their expences, vvhich deuotion in all Turkie hath procured: their Emperours and Bassa's esteeming nothing of more ho∣nour in the vvorld, or merite for heauen. Let vs come to their Church-rites and ce∣remonies. The Temples in Turkie are (as hath beene said) innumerable, both pub∣like, and priuate of meaner buildings: on vvhich is a Tower, as with vs a Sceeple, wherevpon the And.Ariuab. Muetden or Thalisman ascendeth, and it being open with pil∣lars or foure vvindowes, first he goeth to that on the East side, and calleth the people to prayer with a loude voice, Ioannes Thesaurarius Reg Fran. stopping his eares with his hands, crying; There is no God but one, and Mahumet his messenger: come to make prayer for remission of your sinnes, and know that there is no stronger then the God of Mah. his messenger. This hee saith in order on euery side of the steeple. If there be in the Citie many Moschees, the Cathedrall beginneth, and then all the other parishion all follow. This they doe fiue
times a day, and on Friday their Sabbath sixe times. First at sunne rising with foure This bending or bowing they call Eret, which is a dou∣bled bowing with prostra∣ting himselfe: their prayer they call Czala∣mat, which they make sitting after euery Er∣et, with a salu∣tation on the right hand and on the left, and the impression or signe of peace which is done with brin∣ging both hāds ouer the face. bendings to the earth, and twice praying. The second about noone with ten bow∣ings, and fiue prayings: the third at afternoone before sunne-set, with eight in∣clinations and foure prayings. The fourth, with fiue bendings and three prayings a∣bout sun-set. The fift longer then the rest with fifteene bowings & eight prayings. Eue∣rie Busurman is bound to resort to these their Liturgies at his parishionall Meschite, except he haue some lawfull impediment: and if not at all of them, yet at least at one to be well washed, for which purpose they haue innumerable Bathes in Turkie stately built: nor may any enter into the Temple, especially in the morning, but first well wa∣shed in the Bathe as is said before,: and if hee keepeth him cleane the rest of the day, that washing will serue: but Septem castr. if he haue committed any carnall sinne, or bee any way soiled, or haue eaten any vncleane thing, then in some secret place hee washeth his hands and armes to the elbow, his hinder parts Menauino saith that after the secret wash∣ing of thier se∣crets, &c. They come forth & wash their hands, face, & the rest, each three times, obseruing ae∣qually that vn∣equal number, and saying the Psalme Eleache Motteob assr, and after an∣other, Li illaphi Circison. and priuities, and this sufficeth with∣out going to Bathe, except hee be otherwise polluted. For defect herein they haue in∣quisitions, and appointed penalties; respect or pardon being giuen to none that faile, especially on Friday, and in their Lent: such a one is carried about the towne with a boord fastened to his necke, all be-hanged with Foxe-tailes, besides a penaltie according to his state in mony: and he that will not thus order himselfe, shall not be al∣lowed their buriall rites. After they are thus vvashed, they put off their shooes in imitation of Moses, and then enter into the Meschitta, where the floore is co∣uered with Mattes or Carpets, nor is any other thing seene but white walles, and great store of burning Lampes, and in golden Arabian letters those Laillah, ille∣lah Mahomet ir∣resullalah tanre bir pagāber bach. words before mentioned. There is a Pulpit on which the Choza or Focqui ascendeth, and the first thing hee doth is to stretch out his hands at large, and then ioining them togither hee kneeleth and kisseth the ground: then hee lifteth vp his head, and stopping his eares vvith his hands, standing a good space as it were Quasi in aftratto in ora∣tione. distracted or rauished in his prayers: after, lifting vp his hands, hee againe kisseth the ground so many times as the houre of prayer according to that former rule requireth: and then lifting vp himselfe againe, hee stretcheth out his hands againe, so standing about a quarter of an houre, and againe kneeling with his mouth to the ground, so continueth mouing it euerie way about a Pater-noster while, and then lifting vp his head, & setting his hands to his eares, falls to his praying another quarter of an houre, and then licenseth the people to de∣part. There is no noise heard Their deuo∣tion, silence, honestie, & or∣der is such saith Septēcast. that I cannot but admire, com∣paring it with the contrarie in the churches of Christians. as if there had beene nothing within. Menauino thus describeth their rites. After their mysticall washing (as before) they goe with a sober pace to the Meschit (not like one which runneth away) and if he happen to breake winde by the way, his former vvashing is vnsufficient and he must returne to renew it. Being assembled in the Meschit, they all turne their fa∣ces They pray towards Mec∣ca, as the Iewe, towards Ieru∣salem. Southwards, and the Meizin or Muerden, (Clarke, Soxten, Priest, Bell-ringer, or Bell rather) standeth vp and readeth that Psalme which before hee had cried to them in the steeple, and euery one standeth vp holding his hands fastened to his waste, and bow their heads to their feete with great reuerence and without stirring. Then a∣riseth another Priest of another order called Imam and readeth a Psalme aloude, the Meizin as his Clarke answering, which being ended they fall on the ground and say Saban alla, Saban alla, Saban alla, that is GOD haue mercie on vs most vvretched sinners, abiding prostrate till the Priest Imam singeth againe his Psalme, and then they rise. And this they doe foure or fiue times according to the order of their ser∣uice. After this they all kneele and prostrate themselues on the ground, the Meizin obseruing a long ceremonie, in which with a loude voice hee prayeth GOD to in∣spire the Christians, Iewes, Greekes, and generally all Infidels to returne to their Lawe. This being said, euery man lifteth his hand to heauen trying aloude, Amin, Amin: and then they touch their eves, or wipe them with their hands, (which is, as crossing among the Papists, a blessing themselues) bringing their hands ouer their face they depart. In the English Treatise of the Turkish policie these things are related with some other ceremonies: as that they say together with the Priest the first azoara:
or Chapter of the Alcoran, &c. Bartholomeus Bar. Georgie∣vitz. Georgionitz saith that only the chiefe sort are bound to assemble to the daily deuotions which they obserue fiue times a day; o∣thers which cannot spare the times are not tied. Nobili & gli ociosi. On their Sabbaths it is otherwise. The women enter not their Mesquitas but on Fridaies at nine a clocke, or at Easter, and then they are in a Gallery or Terasse apart, where they may see and not bee seene, and this is not common to all, but the wiues and mothers of the chiefe of the place. And as we haue said of the Priest, so it is to be vnderstood that all the men and women there doe the same without sailing in any point. They suffer not a Christian to enter therein: and yet will they enter into the churches of the Christians to heare the church-musicke. The women abide in their Churches from nine of the clocke to midnight, continually praying with certaine motions and strange cryes, continuing so long in this act, that they fall vpon the ground as in a swowne through wearinesse: and if any feele her selfe at that time to bee with childe, the Turkes hold that they are conceiued by the holy GHOST, and presently vowe that childe to GOD, and call such Nefecs Ogli, that is, sonnes of the holy GHOST. And on Friday at nine of the clocke the Priest vseth to preach to the people: and these their discourses last about two houres. That which is said is not very manifest, yet they say that he preacheth the Miracles of Mahomet, some∣time exalting their faith, sometime commending obedience, and sometime rehearsing fabulous tales to terrifie the bad, as that such mens soules are carried of certaine Ca∣mels, there being about sixe thousand flying about in the aire for this purpose, into the Sepulchers of wicked Christians, and that the good Christians are put in their empty Sepulchers, inueighing against the blasphemers of Mahumet, CHRIST, & the Saints, exhorting to almes, rehearsing their commandements of the lawe. And if they preach scandalous doctrine, the Mufti and the Cadilescher depriue them, and correct them as heretikes. Yea some of them, for preferring CHRIST before Mahomet, are put to death: Of which one Ibraim Schec a Priest of Constantinople, (reported to haue wrought miracles amongst the Turkes in the daies of Soliman) was stoned to death, his head cut off, and his body burned, and of his Disciples some were beheaded, others thrust into the Gallies, for preferring CHRIST, and denying Mahomet. And were it not for the terrour of the sword there would bee more innouations of religion: and some haue perswaded the Grand Signior not to suffer the Alcoran to be so common to be read and interpreted of euery one; guilty of the absurdities therein contained. But to returne. After this preaching ended, two yong Clarkes goe vp to him and sing cer∣taine prayers, which ended, the Priest againe beginneth to sing with the people in a base voice, with wrigling euery way for the space of halfe an houre, saying nothing but La illah, ilellah, that is, there is but one GOD. And these ceremonies are done only on their Lenten Fridaies. Their Lent is one Moone or moneth in the yeare, which, if this yeare it be Iuly, the next it shall be August, and so in order: that in twelue yeares they haue fasted all times of the yeare, making no other difference of meates then at other times, but eating onely in the night. They prepare Knoll. Tur. Hist. p.777. themselues by diminishing their fare (not as the Christians at Shrof-tide) that they may the better endure it: for on the day, in which they fast, they will not so much as taste a cup of water, or wash their mouthes therewith, till the Starres appeare: And eight or ten daies after it beginneth, some Officers ride about the towne crying, Such a day beginneth the Fast, prepare yee, prepare yee; and when it is begun, the Cadi and Subassi, if they finde any shops open, or any bodie eating in the day, set him on an Asse backwards, with the taile in his hand, as Adulterers are punished. Neither will they suffer Iewes or Christians to scandallse their Turkes this way. And when their Lent is neere the end, they goe all to the Bathes & plucke off all their haires, but of the head and beard, with an ointment for that purpose: they colour their nailes red with an enduring colour called Chua, with which they die also the nailes and feete of their horses; and the women their hands, feet, and priuie parts. This they doe in honour of their solemnitie, which lasteth three daies with great feasting in which nothing else but meates and drinkes may be sold. They goe to the Sepulchres of the dead there to eate, full of gladnes, and salute each o∣ther, saying Baatam glutizong, that is, GOD giue you a good Feast: and if they
meet with a Iew or a Christian, woe vnto them. The Turkes keep This second Easter is called Chuccihairam. an other Easter, e∣specially in Mecca, more solemne to the Tartars, Moores, and Arabians then to the Turkes, except the pilgrims, which resort thither. The Turkes say they are Circumcisiō. circumci∣sed, because they are the sons of Ismael, and because they may be cleane when they go to their Temples, no filth lying hid vnder the skinne. At seuen or eight yeares of age, or later, this ceremony is performed. The first thing they do, is, to inuite many thither, both Turkes, Iewes, and Christians, besides the friends and kinred; to make the grea∣ter gaine, euery one giuing somwhat according to his abilitie. When the day is come, they which are inuited mount on horse-backe, for else it is No solemni∣ty without horses. no solemnity, and go to the house of the child, who being mounted on a faire horse richly clothed with a great Tullipant on his head, is carried to Church with a long speare borne before him, ha∣uing a torch on the toppe worth a crowne, more or lesse, according to the state of the party, adorned with Roses and Garlands, which with the speare is left a gift to the Church, the fees of the Priest: all the way they found on instruments: after the sonne followeth the father, the kinred, and the rest of the friends, that sometimes there are a hundred horse; at Church they alight and accompany the childe to the Priest, which waiteth for them. Here one of the friends sitteth downe, and on his lappe the childe is set: presently another pulleth off his shooes, another holdeth his hands, and others his feet, and many hold him in talke with words, and these are the gossips. The Priest seeing all things ready, taketh the end of the skinne of his yard, and draweth it out, and nippeth it with siluer pinsers, so to mortifie it, and cut it off with lesse paine: then making him beleeue hee will deferre it till the next day, hee riseth, the other holding him fast: and after, as if hee had forgot somewhat to bee done about it, with sizzers, which he holdeth closely in his hand, sodainly cutteth it off, and another layeth there∣on a certaine powlder to ease the paine, and in fiue and twenty dayes they looke to the curing of it, laying on it salt and marmalade of quinces, and thence forwards he is called a Musulman. But his name is not then giuen him, but at his birth, and that according to their quality. After the childe is loosed, who to shew himselfe of courage, smileth, and lifting vp his greatest finger saith those former words of their profession, and is againe moun∣ted, and all the company, after a little prayer and offring at the church, with like pomp conueigh him home, where is great feasting prouision; some feast it three dayes toge∣ther. Amurath circumcised his sonne Mahomet at sixteene yeares old. Vnto which so∣lemnity many christian Princes were solemnely inuited, who sent thither their ambas∣sadors with presents, who had there their scaffolds prepared for them, and furnished according to their states. The solemnity lasted fortie dayes, and forty nights, in the great market place of Constantinople. And to end these Knol pag.57 solemnities, Mahomet the Prince was circumcised, not publikely, but in his fathers chamber, by Mechmet one of the inferior Bassaes, sometime the Emperour Solymans Barber. And it is done of o∣ther Turkes also most commonly in the fathers house, not in the Church. The women-children about the same age among other women without other so∣lemnitie say ouer those words, La illah, &c. Georgiöüitz. & likewise the Iews; but the Christian re∣negadoes are carried about the streets of the cities, with much solemnity, and many gifts giuen them, besides freedome from tribute: many blinded by couetousnesse of∣fer themselues to this circumcision. But if any for blasphemy against Mahomet, or iniury to a Turke bee by force circumcised, they haue no such gifts: which punish∣ment the Cadilescher (by the testimony of two accusing Turkes) inflicteth. And therefore to preuent the same, the Christians obtaine the grand Seigniours safe-con∣duct, that in cases of conscience they may not be iudged of any, except they were accused at the Court before the foure Bassaes, and the Cadilefcher of Constantinople, and that by the witnesse of Priests only which had not in twelue yeares drunke wine.
CHAP. XII. Of the Sepulchres, Funerall-rites, and opinions touching the dead, among the Turkes. NOw, if you be wearie of viewing their Temples, and their prayers and other ceremonies seeme tedious, I haue thought fit to present you with another sight, and to conclude with (that which is the conclu∣sion of all flesh) a discourse of their Funeralls. When Menauino lib.2. 19. Policie of the Turkish Empire. a Turke is sicke and like to die, his friends visit him, and putting him in minde of his sinnes, aduise him with a penitent heart to bewaile them. Then doe certaine of their Priests, or one of his kinsmen, reade some Psalmes and Prayers. And if the pangs of death do still continue, they bring him the Alcoran, or Curaam where∣in is one Legend called Thebara Echelezi, which they reade seuen times: and if hee shall die of that sickenesse, they thinke he will die before they haue thrice read it: and if they see breath still remaine, they reade another Psalme called Iasinnel Curanil He∣cin, to the end that the Deuill cause no impediment to his soule. When hee is dead, they lay him forth in the middes of the house vpon carpets, and place him on his right side, with his face toward the South. Then do assemble certaine Priests to bury him, bwho bring with them a string of beades (such as the Papists vse in mumbling and numbering their deuotions) being a thousand of them, of lignum aloes, and therewith compasse the body, and then say to euery one Subahan Alla, that is, God haue mer∣cie on him, and turne it about foure or fiue times. If it be a wo∣man which is dead, the wo∣men take this care and pains about it, to lay her forth, &c. After this, their Priests (which are twenty or more) carry the corps into the garden, and lay it on a Table two handes∣breadth from the ground, taking away his shirt, and, couering his shame with a new cloth made of fine bombast, with warme water and sope, wash him from top to toe: then doe they take two sheets of bombast, in which they wrap the corps, wetting the same with rose-water, perfumes, and odoriferous things, and laying him on the beere, couer him quite ouer with his best garments, placing his turbant at the head thereof, all bedecked with floures. Then do the Priests beginne their deuotions, and some of the company take vp the beere, carrying the same with the head forwards to the Meschit: the kinsmen follow, and the women remaine at home weeping, and make ready to eate for the Priests. When they come to the Church, they set him downe without doores, and goe and make an end of their seruice. After that, they carry him forth of the City to the buriall place: (for it is not lawfull to bury in their Cities) some prouide their Sepulchres in their life time, some haue them made after by their friends, either in their Gardens, or some solitary place: They haue also common bu∣riall places, as are our Churchyards, wherein are many tombes of marble, bricke, or other matter, according to the qualitie of the person. If the deceased were a man of high condition, his horses are led with his corps, and his toomb is adorned with many Epitaphs. And if he were a great Commander, those horses are sadled the contrary way, and richly furnished, having certain things hanged at their noses which cause them to neigh, as it were lamenting the losse of their Mai∣ster. They carry also the truncheons of their Launces with their Standards and En∣signes, trailing along the ground. There are planted also about their Sepulchres vio∣lets and other pleasant floures. The common sort haue their toombes of marble engrauen with letters. When they are come to the place, with those sheetes they let it into the graue, couering him on euery side with Georgiouitz lib.2. saith, that they make o∣uer the graue the sorm of an Altar, left the beasts should go ouer it, and defile it. They also often re∣paire thither with tears, and set on the mo∣nument flesh, bread, wheate, egs, milke, &c. which is done for the dead mans soule in almes to the poore, or to the birds, or ants, which they also ac∣count an act of mercy, no lesse meritori∣ous then the other. boordes, only on the face they lay a little earth, and there leaue him, and returne home, where they finde store of cheate, and there make a prayer for his soule. The Priests haue fiue aspers a peece giuen them for their paines. And if the party be poore, they gather money, to pay the Priests, and to discharge the funeralls. They weare blackes eight dayes in token of mourning: and those that are
of great account, three dayes: at which time the friends of the dead assemble, and v∣sing some words of mutuall consolation, from thenceforth resume their wonted ha∣bite. Howbeit their kindred, specially of the female sex, often repaire to the graues to lament there. Bellonius in his Obseruat. Bellon.li 3.ca.5. obserueth, that they sowe not the sheet at the head nor at the feet. The reason is, their dreame of certaine Angells, sent in commis∣sion presently after the burial, to examin the deceased party, into whom they say God hath then put a new spirit. These Angels Menavino calls Nechir and Remonchir, who come with dreadfull countenances and burning firebrands, & examine him of his life, which if they find wicked, they scourge him with fierie whips, if good, they become goodly Angels, and comfort him. Bellonius alittle otherwise telleth, that those Angels (which he calleth Guanequir and Mongir) come, the one with an yron hammer, the other with a hooke, which set the corps vpon his knees, and put a new soule into it; and then aske if he haue belieued Mahumet & obserued his precepts, if he haue done good workes, kept their Lent, paid his Tithes, giuen almes. Of which, if hee can giue good account, they depart from him, and two other Angells come in their places, white as snowe, and one of them puts his armes in stead of a pillow vnder his head, the other sits at his feet, and defends him vntill the day of Iudgement. But if he satisfie not the demands of those blacke Angels, he with the yron mallet strikes him at one blow therewith nine fadome vnder the ground: and neither of them ceaseth, the one with his hammer, the other with his hooke, to torment the deceased party vntill the day of Iudgement. For this cause the Turks write vpon their dead carkasses the name Croco, and make their Sepulchres hollow, that they may haue roome to kneele, and some lay boards ouer, that no earth fall in. The feare here of makes them in their morning pray∣er to say; Lord GOD from the questioning of the two Angells, the torment of the graue, and the euill iourney, deliuer mee, Amin. Yea, hence are the prayers which the Turks, men and women, say at the graues of the dead, for deliuery from these Angels. Concerning the day of Iudgement, they Menauino li.2.20, 21,22,23. holde that there is an Angell standing in Heauen named Israphil, holding alway a Trumpet in his hand prepared against God commaund to found the consummation of the World. For at the sound thereof, all men and Angells shall die, for so they find it written in their The Turkish Curaam doth not agree in al things with the Alcaran. as appeareth by comparing the text of the one & quotations of the other. Curaam, which booke is of high authoritie with them, and is sometimes called the Alcoran, though it seeme rather to bee taken out thereof then to be the Text it selfe. The Turkish Doctours would dissent from that opinion of the Angells mortality, if this Booke would giue them leaue: for to contradict the authority thereof is punished with fire, or else their tongues are pulled out of their heads. They hold, that after this dismall sound shal be a great Earthquake, which shall tumble mountaines and rockes from their places, and grinde them to meale. After this, GOD wil returne to make a new the light, and the Angels as before, and will cause to fall a pleasant raine called Rehemet sui, that is, the raine of mercy: and so shall the earth remaine fortie dayes, although those dayes shall be of a larger size then these. Many also hold, that from thencefoorth there shall be no darkenes of the night, as now, but that it shall be most cleare, neyther shall there need any more sleep for the sustentation of our bodies. After forty daies God will command Israphil to sound his Trumpet the second time, at which sound all the dead The resurre∣ction. shalbe raised againe by the will of God, the dead e∣uen from Abel to the end of the world, throughout all the earth, hearing the sound thereof, and rising in maner as they were buried. Amongst them shall be seene diuers faces and countenances, some shining as the Sunne, many like the Moone, many as the Starres. Others shalbe obscure and darke, and others with hogges faces, with swolne tongues. Then shall euery one cry, Nessi Nessi, that is, Woe is me wretch who haue suffred my selfe to be ouercome with my filthy lusts. The Angels shall with their fin∣gers point at the faces which shine, which are they that haue wrought good workes, and shall shew them to one another. The wicked shall haue enuy thereat. They say, that those with faces like hogs, are such as haue bin vsurers: and those with the swolne tongues, liers and blasphemers. There shall be others troden vnder foot, to wit, the prowd persons of this world. God, say they, wil then demand account of the kings,
princes, emperors, and tyrants, which vse oppression and violence. The Iudge∣ment. Then shall God diuide this raysed company into seuenty parts, all which shall be examined, presenting their sins before their eies, & all that they haue in this world done well or ill: whereto he shal need no testimony; euery member bearing witnes against it selfe of the deeds, yea and very thoughts. There shalbe also Michael the Angell holding in his hand the ballance of diuine Iustice, and shal weigh soules, & distinguish the good from the bad. There shalbe Moses with his Standard, vnder which shall all the obseruers of his lawe be assembled. Neare to him shalbe Iesus Christ the son of the virgin Mary with an o∣ther great Standard, and all his Christians, the obseruers of his faith. On the other side shalbe Mahomet with his standard and faithfull Mahumetans: they which haue done good shalbe all gathered vnder the said standards, where they shal haue a pleasant sha∣dow; the rest shalbe extremely scorched by the heate of the Sunne, according to the measure of their sins. Thus shall both parts abide, till God shal pronounce his eternal sentence. When that doome is pronounced, the Angels shall stand diuided in squa∣drons, all alike adorned, the Seraphins on one side, the Cherubins on the other: of the which, one part shall sound instruments of diuers sorts, & the other shal sing hymnes: and many shall stand at the gates of Paradise singing & gratulating the blessed soules which haue obserued the diuine Precepts; Christians, Iewes, Turkes, and Moores, be∣ing all of equal beauty & beatitude, if they haue done wel. Paradise. But sinners shalbe knowne asunder. They affirme also, that God wil giue those soules of Paradise a large space in heauen for their euerlasting habitation, goodly and shining. They shal also haue Ba∣rachi, Sunne beames, on which they may ride and take their view round about Para∣dise, of the pretious delights therein. There shal they haue pleasant fruits, & if they eat one apple, two shall grow in the roome; and to quench their thirst, they shall haue ri∣uers cleare as Cristall, sweet as sugar, by drinking of which their sight and vnderstand∣ing shal increase, in such sort, that they shal see from one Pole to the other. The meats which they eate, shall consume by a subtile kind of sweat. Further they say, they shall haue their women called Vri, that is, shining, which shall euery day be virgins, with which they shall continue for euer. Neither shall there be any danger of old age; the men alway being of thirty yeares old, the women of fifteene or twenty. Those three Standard-bearers shalbe the principall, each of them hauing a peculiar part of Paradise assigned him for his dominion. Those which for their bad deeds shalbe condemned to hell, Hell. shalbe all knowen by proper names, which they shall beare in their forheads: and they shall beare the num∣ber and greatnesse of their sins on their shoulders. Thus shall they be led betweene two mountaines where Hell is situate, at the mouth whereof is a most venomous ser∣pent: and from one mountaine to an other is a bridge thirty miles long, which is so made, that they ascend on the first part, the other part is plaine, the last descendeth. This bridge (say they) is made of thinne yron and sharpe: (they call it Serat Cuplissi, that is, the bridge of Iustice.) Vpon this shall passe the sinners with the heauy weight of their sinnes vpon their shoulders: and they which haue not beene altogether euill shall not fall into Hell, but into Purgatory: but the other shall sodainely be plunged into the bottome of hel, where they shall burne, more or lesse, according to the quan∣titie of the fire of their sins, which they haue carried out of this world: and after the burning they turne to be refreshed, and presently againe to the fire. In the middes of Hell they say is a tree full of fruit, euery apple being like to the head of a Deuill, which groweth greene in the middes of all those flames, called Zoaccum Agacci, or the tree of Bitternes, and the soules that shall eate thereof, thinking to refresh themselues, shall so finde them, and by them and their paines in Hell, they shall grow madde. And the Deuills shall binde them with chaines of fire, and shall dragge them vp & downe through Hell. Those soules which sometime shall name God in their ayde, they say, after many yeares, shall goe into Paradise; and none shall remaine in Hell, but such Bell.Obseru.libr.3.cap.6. Resurrection of Rammes. as despaire of their saluation and Gods mercy. Thus farre Menavino. To this agree∣eth Bellonius, and addeth, that in the day of Iudgement, they beleeue a resurrecti∣on of the birds and beasts: and that the Rammes which they kill at their Easter, shall
goe into Paradise: and therefore, though one should serue, they kill many. For the Booke of Zuna saith, that those Rammes shall pray for their Sacrificers in the day of Iudgement. It telleth that the Stars are hanged in the aire by golden chains, to watch lest the deuills should learne the secrets of Paradise, and reueale them to Sooth-sayers. Also, that the Ramme which Abraham offered in stead of his sonne, was a black one, which had beene nourished fortie yeares in Paradise, that Mah. shall be turned at the end of the world into a Ramme; and the Turkes into Fleas, whom he shall carry stic∣king to him, out of Hell into Paradise, and there shake them off, where they shall a∣gaine receiue the formes of Turkes: That hee shall wash them with the water of that Fountaine in Paradise, to purge the blackenesse which they got by the scorching of Hell, from whence he will deliuer all good Turkes. CHAP. XIII. Of the Religious Votaries amongst the Turks, and of their Saints. TO proceed vnto the differences of opinion amongst the Turks: Septem∣castrensis (who liued very many yeares amongst them) saith, that al∣though they consent against CHRIST, yet doe they much dissent among themselues, wresting the Alcoran to their purposes, and scarce∣ly one of a hundreth agreeing with his fellow about Mahomet and their Lawe. And besides their differences in Ceremonies, there are, saith he, foure sects differing in maine grounds of Religion: which would not be ap∣peased without bloud, if they feared not the higher power, and were not thereby kept in awe. One of these sects is that of the Priests, holding, that none can be saued, but by the Lawe of Mahomet. The second of their religious Dermschler, reputed the successors of the Saints, the friends of God and Mahomet, who are of opinion, that the Lawe profiteth nothing, but the grace of God: and these ground their opinions on miraculous illusions, of which hee reporteth one in the time of Amurath the se∣cond, who examining this contention betwixt these Seculars and Regulars, and be∣ing purposed to giue sentence in the behalfe of the Priests, and against the religious, one of these Dermschler Visions and Apparitions among the Turkes aswell as among the Papists. appearing to him in a vision, (others also ground Faith on Visions) and deliuering him out of a great danger, altered his minde: for going to the stoole in the night, the boords gaue way, and he fell in, staying on a crosse tim∣ber, where this religious man in their wonted habite appeared to him, and bid him now vse the help of his Priests for his deliuerance. This after so affected the King, that himselfe became a religious man till the necessity of State-affaires compelled him to resume his gouernment. (He that listeth may compare with this Dunstans deuises for his Regulars:) The third he calleth Czofilar speculatiue men, which Sect is founded on Tradition, holding that they are saued by Merit, without Law or Grace. These are very earnest in prayers, neuer ceasing; and meeting in the night, and sitting in a Cir∣cle they begin to say, Layla illalach, with shaking their heads till they fall down sense∣lesse: these three sorts are manifest to the people, and as it were of equall esteeme with them: The fourth are called Horife that is, Heretikes, holding, that euery man is saued in his owne Lawe, and all Lawes to be alike good to the obseruers: these are burned if they be taken. Strange it is, that hee reporteth of the miraculous workes of some of them, that they may seeme (as hee saith) incarnate Deuilles: Some going naked, with their priuities onely hidden, and some of these are impassible, besides the violence of Winter and Summer, induring, like stones, the branding with fire or wounding with sword: Some seldome eate or drinke, and some, not at all: others, but from hand to mouth; some are perpetually silent, hauing no conuersation with men, of which hee saith he sawe one: and some haue their supernaturall traunces or rauishments: Some dwell amongest men, some by themselues apart, and some in wildernes: Some keep
hospitality in Cities, atleast to harbour men, if they haue not foode for them: some carrying about water in leather bagges, giuing it to all, and demanding nothing for the same, except any voluntarily gratifie them. Some inhabite at the Sepulchres of the Saints, keeping the same, and liuing on the vowes and offerings of the people, not obseruing the washings and ceremonies of the Lawe. As concerning those Wa∣ter-carriers, Nichalas Nicholay saith, that hee hath seene in a morning at Constanti∣nople fifty of those Sacquas (so he calleth them) in a company, all furnished with their scrippes of leather full of Cisterne or Fountaine-water hanging on their side, with Cuppes of fine Corinthian latten guilded and damaskined, bearing in the same hand a Looking-Glasse, which they hold before the eyes of them whome they giue to drinke, admonishing them to thinke on Death: and if any giue them any thing, they out of a Violl cast on their faces sweet smelling water. He telleth of some that would seeme to liue a solitary life amongst beasts, but indeed liue in shoppes in most popular Cities, the walles whereof are couered with skinnes of diuers beasts, and vpon the hornes thereof they hang tallow candles. In the middest of this their sacred shoppe standeth a stoole couered with a greene cloth, and vpon the same a great lat∣ten candlesticke, without any candle. Moreouer, they haue painted a Cimiterre hung in the middest, in memory of Haly, who forsooth with his sword cut the rocks in sunder: and they breed vp with them, beasts, as bulles, beares, harts, rauens, ea∣gles; so that in stead of their liuing with beasts, beasts liue with them. And if suffici∣ent be not brought to their shoppes, they with one of these beasts in their hand goe a∣bout the streetes begging. In the army of the Turkes that assaulted Malta in the yeare 1565. were Knol.p.794. thirteene thousand of a certaine kinde of men amongst the Turkes, which liue of the reuenues of the Church, who had at Constantinople Turkish Decij. vowed their liues for their superstition. Antonie Pagifetta Knol.pag.834 reporteth, that as the Emperors Ambassadors were conueyed from the presence of the great Turke to their lodging, by the Ianizaries and their Aga, there were amongst them certaine religious men called Haagi which vse to follow the Ianizaries, who continually turning about, and in their going, singing, or ra∣ther howling certaine Psalmes or Prayers for the great Sultans welfare, made them wonder that they fell not downe for giddinesse. But amongst all their orders of Religion, Nicholas Nicholai, M.N.l.3.c.15 & Christoph. Ri∣cherius. and before him Me∣navina, reckon foure which are most common amongst them, the Giamailer, the Ca∣lender, the Dervisi, and the Torlachi. The Giamailer are for the most part, faire yong men, of rich houses, which giue themselues to trauell through diuerse Regions, at other mens charges, vnder colour of Religion: carrying with them none other apparrell then a little Cassocke of Pur∣ple colour, girt with a girdle of silke and golde: vpon the ends whereof-hang cer∣taine cimballs of siluer mixt with some other cleare-sounding mettall, and they doe ordinarily weare sixe or seuen of these about their girdles, and vnder their knees. Instead of a cloake they are couered with the skinne of a Lion or Leopard, beeing whole and in his naturall haire, which they make fast vpon their breast, by the two former legges. All the rest of their bodies are bare: sauing that they weare-great Rings on their eares, and a kinde of sandalls on their feete, their haire groweth long like wo∣mens, disheueled ouer their shoulders. They beare in one of their hands a Booke, written in the Persian language, full of amorous Sonnets. And thus with their voy∣ces and cimbals, they make pleasant musicke, especially if they meet some faire strip∣ling, whom they set in the middest of them, and incompasse with their morice-mu∣sicke. These are the Pilgrimes of loue; and vnder pretext of Religion do draw vnto them the hearts of women and yonglings, and are called the men of the Religion of loue; vnto which order of Religion youth is prone more then enough. The partakers of their musicke ordinarily impart to them of their coine. The Calender Nic.Nic.16. is of a contrary profession to the former glorying of abstinence and chastitie. They haue for their dwelling certaine little Churches, which they call
Techie, ouer the gates whereof they doe write these or like words, Coedanormas, dil ersin cusciunge al, cachecciur: that is, they which will enter into their religion, must doe workes liketheirs, and remaine in their virginitie. These Calenders are clothed with a little short coat without sleeues, after the fashion of a haire-cloth, made of wooll and horse-haire, and do not let their haire grow long, but cut the same, & couer their heads with felt-hats, like the Priests of, Graecia, about which hang certaine strings, about the breadth of an hand, made of horse-haire: in their eares, and about their necks and armes they weare great rings of iron. They pierce the skin vnder their priuy member, thrusting thorow the same a ring of an indifferent bignes & weight, to bar them from venerie, if they were thereunto otherwise willing. They also goe reading of certaine songs, made by one of their Order, called Nerzimi, the first Saint and Martyr, after their reckoning, of their religion, who for certaine words spoken against the law of Mahomet, was in Azamia flaide quicke. Menauino Lib.2.cap.10. saith, he had read some of his writtings agreeing with the Christian faith in many points. Some Policy of the Turkish Em∣pire. say, he was mar∣tyred for confessing CHRIST. The Deruis goe bare-headed, and cause their head and beard to be cut with a rasor, and all the hairie parts of their bodie: and burne also their temples with a hot iron, or an old peece of cloth burnt; hauing their eares pierced, wherein they do weare certain great rings of Iasper. All their cloaths are two sheepes or goats skins, the haire thereof being dried in the Sun, one before, and the other behind, embracing the body in forme of a girdle, otherwise naked, Winter and Summer. They dwell without the Cities in Suburbs and Villages. Thus vnder the colour of Religion they roame vp and downe, and make no conscience to rob, kill, and murther, if they find themselues the stronger (with a small hatchet which they beare vnder their girdle) all men of whatsoeuer law ornation. They are fornicators, and most detestable in that most detestable sinne of Sodomie. For shew of holinesle they eate of a certaine herbe This seemes to be the same hearbe which Menauixo cal∣leth Asseral. called Matslach, the violent operation whereof maketh them to become madde, so as through a certaine furie, they with a certaine knife or rasor, doe cut their neckes, stomackes and thighes, vntill they be full of most horrible wounds; which to heale, they lay vpon them a cer∣taine hearbe, letting it lie vpon their hurt, vntill it be altogether consumed into ashes, suffering in the meane time extreame paine with maruellous patience. Thus doe they imitate their Prophet Mahomet, who, through abstinence in his denne, fell into such a furie (say they) that he would haue throwne himselfe from the toppe of it. And there∣fore fooles and madde men are in great reuerence: yea they account such for Saints: and if such madde men strike or robbe them, they take it in good part, and say they shall haue good lucke after it. They erect stately monuments ouer such madde mens graues, as at Aleppo, Biddulph ep. Fooles are e∣steemed belo∣ued of God: if such be Chri∣stians they cir∣cumcise them by force, and esteeme them Saints saying. God hath made him a foole, thus to bee saued by their meanes. one Sheh Bonbac (who being madde, went alwaies naked) being dead, they built an house ouer his graue, where to this day (saith our Author) there are lampes burning day and night, and many of these Daruises there maintained, to looke to his sepulchre, and to receiue the offerings of such as come, as many doe euerie weeke out of Aleppo. If any be sicke or in danger, they vow to offer money or other things to Sheh Boubac if they recouer. The same account they make of one Sheh Mahammet a madde man, yet liuing in Aleppo, going naked with a spitte on his shoulder. Men and women will come and kisse his hand, or some other part of his bodie, and aske him counsell, for they hold that madde mens soules are in heauen-talking with GOD, and that he reuealeth secrets to them. And euen the Bassaes themselues will kisse and consult with this Oracle. Hard I deeme it to say whether is the madde man. In a late victo∣rie against the Christians, they affirme that this Sheh Mahammet was seene in the field many thousand miles distant, fighting against their enemies, whom by his helpe they ouercame. But to returne to our Daruises, this our Author saith, that oftentimes great Bassaes, in displeasure with the Emperour, will retire themselues into this Order, as the Hospi∣tall and Sanctuarie of their diseased and dangerous state. Their witnesse is of better account then any other mans, although he were an Emir, or of the kindred of Maho∣met. They liue of almes, as the other Religious doe, which they begge in the name
of Haly. They haue Nic Nichol. in Natolia a sepulchre of a Saint called by them Scidibattal, who (say they) conquered the most part of Turkie, and about the place of the sepulchre is an habitation & Couent, where, aboue fiue hundred of these Deruises dwell: and there once in the yeare they keepe a generall assembly, in which their Superiour (whom they call That is, the Father of fa∣thers. Assambaba) is present and President; their Counsell or Chapter consisting (saith Menauinus) of aboue eight thousand of their Order. One of these Deruislars Knolles p.463. drawing neere vnto Baiazet the second, as if he would haue receiued an almes of him, desperatly assailed him with a short Scimitar, which he closely hid vnder his hypocriticall habit. But Baiazet by the starting of his horse (afraid of this hobgoblin) auoided the dead∣ly blow, but not vnwounded: neither had he so escaped, had not Ishender Bassa with his horse-mans Mace presently strucke downe the desperate villaine, as he was redou∣bling his blow, who was forthwith rent in peeces by the souldiers. Baiazet thereupon proscribed all them of that superstitious Order, and banished them out of his empire. The like (as Septem castrensis saith) they had attempted against Mahomet his father in his youth, while Amurath was yet liuing. And in our dayes Mehemet or Muhemet, the great Visier Bassa, who swayed almost wholly and only that mightie Empire (as appeareth in the historie of that State) in the dayes of Solyman, Selym, and Amurath, and as Master Harborne relateth, was esteemed to possesse two and twentie millions of gold, was not assaulted only, but murthered by one of these Deruislers. For where∣as it is a custome of the great men, that at ordinary houres all their Chaplaines, or Priests, assemble themselues in the Diuano, there together mumbling their superstiti∣ons: and this Deruisler Knol.Turk. Hist p950. ordinarily thither admitted, vpon an old grudge, for that Me∣hemet had before depriued him of a souldiers place and pension, when the Visier sate there to giue publike audience, sitting right against him, after his Mumpsimus finished, the Visier reaching vnto him his wonted almes, he with a dagger closely before pro∣uided, stabbes him into the breast, and was therefore of Mehemets slaues with exqui∣sit torments done to death. In their great Counsell before mentioned, there are yong men clothed in white, which tell the most memorable obseruations in their trauailes, which they present to the Assambaba in writing, subscribed with their names. On the Friday they vse after prayer and eating, the herbe Asseral is an herbe, that maketh men merry, as if they were drunkon. Asseral, to reade the same with daunces, and after their daunce (which is about a huge fire, made of as much wood as an hundred beasts can carrie) they cut the skinne of their armes, legges, or breasts, en∣grauing some figure thereon, whereto they after apply ashes and vrine: In the doing hereof they vtter this speech: This I cut for the loue of such a woman. Vpon the last day of their feast, they take leaue of their Gouernour, and depart in troupes like souldi∣ers with banners and drummes; and so returne to their owne Monasteries. The Torlaquis by other called Durmislurs, cloath themselues with sheepes and goats skins, like vnto the Deruis: aboue the same they wrap about them in maner of a cloake the skin of a great Beare, with the haire, made fast vpon their stomacke with the legs: vpon their heads they weare a white bonnet of felt folded with smal plaits, hauing the rest of their bodies altogether naked. They also burne their Temples as the former. A beastly generation. For they know not, nor will learne to reade, write, or doe any ciuill profitable act, but liue idly vpon almes, roaguing thorow the Countrey alone, and in troupes thorow the deserts, robbing such as they meet handsomely apparelled, cau∣sing them to goe as they doe, naked. They professe palmistry and fortune-telling, the people feeing and feeding them for such vanities. And sometimes they cary with them an old man, whom they worship as a God: lodging themselues neere the best house of the towne where they come. And there this new numen, and old impostor, faining him∣selfe rauished in spirit, pronounceth graue words and spirituall commandments; at sun∣dry times lifting vp his eyes to heauen, and after turning to those his disciples, willeth them to carry him from thence, for some eminent iudgement there to be executed, as is reuealed to him. They then pray him to auert that danger by his prayer, which he accordingly doth: which the people (deluded by their hypocrisies) reward with large beneuolence, at which they after amongst themselues do merrily scoffe. They eate also of the herbe Maslatz, and sleepe vpon the ground naked of cloathes and shame, and commit also abominable Sodomitrie. And thus much of their
misorderly orders of an irreligious Religion. He that will reade more at large of them, let him reade the booke of the Policie of the Turkish Empire, which out of Menauino discourseth more largely of these things, and other the Turkish rites. Septemcastrensis Cap.15. telleth of certaine Saints of exceeding estimation for holinesse, whose sepulchres are much frequented of deuout Votaries: as that of Sedichasi (which signifieth a holy conquerour) in the confines of Caramania. Another is called Hat∣sehipettesch that is, the Pilgrims helpe. Another Assich is the Goddesse of loue with the Georgiouz. Ascik passa who helpeth in loue-mat∣ters, and for children, in barrennesse. Another, Van passa, for concord: and Scheych passa, in trouble and affliction: and Goi or Muschin or Rartschin passa, inuoked for their cattle: and Chidir elles for trauellers, to whom he sometime appeareth as a tra∣ueller; and any one that hath extraordinarily liued, is imputed a Saint after his death. They haue many whose names I remember not (saith he) in like reuerence with them, as are the Apostles with vs. When they would seeke for things lost, they goe to one Saint; when they are robbed, they go to another; and for the knowledge of things secret, they repaire to a third. They haue their Martyrs, and Miracles, and Reliques. Thus they tell of certaine religious men condemned wrongfully, for suspicion oftrea∣son, to the fire; which they entred without harme (as Dan.3 27. those three companions of Da∣niel) and their shooes were hanged vp for a monument. Their Nephes ogli that is, soules or persons begotten of the holy Spirit (such is their fancie) without seede of man, they hold in such reputation, that they account themselues happie, which can doe them any good, yea that can touch them: and if their haires be laid vpon any, they say that their sicknesses are cured. In this reputation of sanctity they haue a certaine old woman, which hauing a dog with her (in her pilgrimage to Mecca) ready to die for thirst, made water in her hand, and gaue it to the dogge: which charitable act was so highly accepted, that a voice was presently heard from heauen, saying, This day thou shalt be in Paradise. And at the same time she was caught vp bodie and soule into heauen: and hereupon are they li∣berall to their dogges. If this crosse an opinion, which some Saracens hold, that wo∣men come not to Paradise, no maruell, seeing falsehood is commonly contrary both to the Truth, and it selfe. He that would reade the miraculous tales which they tell of their Saints, may haue recourse to that namelesse Author, which of his countrey is cal∣led, and heere often cited by the name, Septemcastrensis: who telleth Septemcast cap.18. of his Master and his Mistris their deuotion and vowes to Goi and Mirtschin, for preseruation of their cattell, sometimes miraculous (so readie is the Diuell with his sauing destruction, and destroying preseruation) yea he saith, that the Diuell doth turne himselfe amongst them into an Angell of light, with such effectuallillusions, that there are seene, or (at least) beleeued amongst them, the dead raised to life, diseases of all sorts cured, secrets of the hearts disclosed; treasures, long before hidden in the ground, reuealed: and besides, such oftentation, and shew of dissembled holinesse, that they may seeme not to come short of the Fathers and Apostles in that behalfe: if bodily exercise were the triall of sanctitie. Busbequius Busbequius epist.1. tels, that they haue like conceit of one Chederles, amongst them, as some superstitious persons haue of Saint George and the Turkes affirme to be the same: The Deruis haue a great Temple dedicated in his honor at Theke Thioi, not farre from A∣mafia, the chiefe Citie of Cappadocia. The Countrey and both Legends agree, for the killing of the Dragon, deliuering the Virgin, &c. They say that he trauelled many coū∣tries, and at last came to a riuer, the waters wherofyeelded immortality to the drinker, and now cannot be seene. Chederles hereby freed from death, rides about euery where on his horse (which thence also dranke in immortality) & delighteth in battels, taking part with the best cause: & to make vp the tale, they say he was one of the cōpanions of Alexander Alexander Mug. was also one of their Saints. the Great; they affirme, that Alexand was Salomons chiefe captaine, & Iob his high steward. In that Moschee or Temple at Theke Thioi is a fountaine of water, which they say, sprang vp of the staling of Chederles horse. Like stories haue they of his horse-keeper, & nephew, whose sepulchers they shew, where deuout pilgrims obtaine many blessings. They shew for reliques the peeces of the shooes which Chederles his
horse brake in that Dragon-fight, and vse the same in drinke against agues and head∣aches. These places are full of Dragons and Vipers. Sultan Murat Chan, Leuncla.hist.Musul.lib.14. or Amurath the second in a battaile against the Christians, vsed this prayer, O righteous GOD, giue vs strength and victorie, O Muhamet, O Mustapha the top of glory, by abundance of miracles, by the abundance of Gaib-erenlers, which are friends to the Musulmans, and walke inuisible, by the abundance of the Cheders, grant vs victory. In the time Leuncla.hist.Musul.lib.4. of Vr∣chan, or Orchanes the sonne of Ottoman, they say these Gaib-erenlers appeared on white horses in a battel against the Christians, & slew them. These (they say) are friends to the Islams, that is, Catholike, or right-beleeuing Musulmans, and are diuine prote∣ctors of the Imania or Mahumetan law. Such tales you may reade in the Spanish relati∣ons of the West Indies, as at the battell of Tauasco, Historie of the West In∣dies.Lop. de Gom. where a strange horse-man dis∣comfited the Indians, &c. And our inuocation of GOD and Saint George, is rather Tur∣kish, then truly Christian: For GOD alone Psal.144.2. is our strength, which teacheth our hands to fight, and our fingers to battell: and Psal.73.25. whom haue I in heauen but thee, and I haue desired none earth with thee? As for George and Chederles I know them both alike in matter of In∣uocation, saue that it is worse to abuse to impietie a Christian name then a Turkish: and King Edward the third seemed to inuoke Edward as much as George, Ha Saint Ed∣ward, ha Saint George (saith Thomas Walsingham). But that of George is rather an Em∣bleme of euery Christian, as not onely the heroique Muse of our Spenser Spensers Red∣crosse Knight in the Fa.Q. in Poe∣ticall fiction: but the Diuiner of great Diuines Rainold.de Rom Eccl. Idolo∣lat.lib.1.cap.5. in their iudiciall censure haue mani∣fested. It seemeth that the Chederles, and Gaib-erenlers are diuers: and perhaps that Martiall nation in conquest of the Christians of those parts, would soone recon∣cile themselues to that martiall Saint, and drinke in those further deuotions which his horse pissed. Such Emblemes were those of Christopher, Catherine, George, which the Papists inuocate as Saints; an error proceeding from those pictures (as it seemeth) in Churches, according to that of the Prophets, Ierem.10.8. The stocke is a doctrine of vanitie, and Habac.2.18. the Image a teacher of lies. The ruder posteritie in that mist of Antichrist, and smoake from the bottomlesse pit not being able to discerne an Emblem and History asunder, haue made S. George the Mars Bap.Man: Fast.lab.a. of the Christians, quem nostra iuuentus Pro Mauorte colit. Bellarmine Rel.de Eccles. Tri.lib.1.20. strugleth much, rather then he will lose his Saint, and yet confesseth the History Apocryphal. Baronius Baron,. in . Rm.A.23. his fellow Cardinal, but beyond in truth, acknow∣ledgeth it an image of a symbole, rather then of a history, which I acobus de Voragine without good authority, in his Golden Legend maketh historicall. He saith the Virgin representeth some Prouince, which imploreth the Martyrs help against the Diuell. But Hypcriue Hyp. derat. stud. I .lib.3.cap.7. and Vallauicentius Posseuini interprete it more fitly to signifie the Church assaulted by the Diuel, protected by the Christian Magistrate: in which respect our De∣fender of the Faith may iustly betermed the Patron of that renowned Order, which hath now learned their George to be symbolicall, not a Cappadocian, & as Princes of Gods husbandry. which gaue name to S. George, to fight against the Dragon, and the beast with hornes like the Lambe, but speaking like the Dragon. As for the Popish George, Baronius also hath another originall from the Arrians, worshipped of them for a Martyr. 1.Cor.3. But if any would be further acquainted with this Knightly Saint, let him resort to Do∣ctor Rainolds his larger Historie. CHAP. XIIII. Of their Priests, and Hierarchie. AFter the discourse of their Regulars (which in estimatlō of deuotiō haue with the Turks, & therefore in this history, the first place) their Secular Priests follow to be considered. These are of differing degrees, which Menauino Lib.2.cap.3. thus reckoneth: first the Cadilescher, vnder which the Mof∣ti or Mufti; the third the Cadi, and after these (in subordinate orders) the Modecis, Antippi, Imam, Meizini, and besides these the Sophi, A certaine Ragusian, Edit. Alcora∣ni Latin. in an Oration before Maximilian the Emperour doth not much disagree: but for Cadilescher, he calleth the first Pescherchadi, whereof (he saith) there
are two, one in Romania, the other in Natolia, chiefe Iudges of the armie, hauing power to reuerse the sentence of the Emperour, if it be against the law of Mahomet. A second Magistrate (saith he) is called Muchti, the chiefe interpreter of the law, from whose sentence is no appeale. Nic. Nicolai Peregrinati. on. lib.3.c.14. saith the same of their two Cadileschers, and that they are chosen out of their most learned Doctors of their law, and alway follow the Court, and with the consent of the Bassas, constitute and depose the Cadi; hauing for their annuall stipend seuen thousand or eight thousand ducats, besides their ordinarie gaines. They haue ten Secretaries kept at the Grand Seigniors charge, and two Moolorbassis, which are bu∣sied about the horses: they haue also two hundred or three hūdred slaues. They vse few words, but such as are of their law and religiō altogether, with very much shew of gra∣uity. Arinabene Alcoran.Ital. (in his preamble to the Italian Alcoran) maketh Cadilescher Kadileskicri ab Arabibus Ca∣siaskeri dcti, Iu∣dices sunt supre∣mi, &C. L. Soranz. Otto. to be a generall name to all their orders of Priests. Others do place the Mufti in the highest place, and the Cadilescher in the second ranke: and perhaps others gaue the Cadileseher the first place, because their life was more in action and gouernment, as attending on the Court, & on the wars: but the Mufti being highest Interpreter of their law (though without gouernment) must indeed haue preeminēce. And so Menauino Lib.2.cap.4. seemeth to af∣firme, who, though hee placeth the Cadilescher first, yet saith, that Quando per caso s' appella à sue sententie, si recorre al Mophti when happily ap∣peale is made from his sentence, they haue recourse to the Mophti. And this opinion is now generall and most current, which ascribeth to the Mufti the chiefe place. Master Harborn, sometime Embassabor into Turkie for Englands Queen (the worlds wonder, our Westerne Hesperus, that shined so far ouer and beyond all Christendome, into the East; but my words are too base to vsher in that renowned name) ELIZA∣BETH, thus Lib.Manu∣script. reporteth. The Turkes do hold for head and chiefe of their religion the Mufti (the choice of whom is made by the Great Turke himselfe) such a one as is knowne to be wise and learned, and chiefely of a good life. His authoritie is so estee∣med, that the Emperour will neuer alter a determination made by him. He intermed∣leth in all matters as best him liketh, whether they be ciuill or criminal, yea, or of State. And yet he hath no power to command; but it is in each mans free liberty, when there happeneth any doubt of importance, to make in some few words, by writing, a decla∣ration of his matter in forme of a question: to whom the said Mufti, in a writing like∣wise (called Zetfa) giueth a briefe answere containing his iudgement thereon. This Zetfa, brought to the Iudge, is the rule of his sentence; prouided, that the declarati∣on, made before to the Mufti, contained no vntruth. Also the Grand Seignior, to shew that he is religious and iust, doth serue himselfe of the authoritie of this Mufti, in affaires of warre and peace demanding his iudgement (in manner aforesaid;) by this course, the subiects being inclined to more forward obedience. But yet the Mufti will commonly slatter him, and leane to that part, to which he seeth him incline: as in the time of Selim the second, the Mufti hauing discouered the Emperours intent to warre vpon Cyprus, approued the same in his Zetpha. But after, vpon great offers made to Mehemet the Visier to breake that resolution, the Mufti, by him wonne to fauour the matter, affirmed still, that the warre against Cyprus was good and iust, but that his Maiestie had a greater obligation in conscience, which he was bound to take in hand, namely, to procure the reuolt of the Moores in Spaine, there oppressed by the Christ∣ians, wherein he was so bold with the Emperour, as to tell him to his face, that if he did neglect the cause of those Mahumetans, he might be thereunto by his subiects com∣pelled. Concerning the Mufti, and other steppes of their Hierarchie, Master Knol. p.1302. Knolles wri∣teth, That the Turkes haue certaine Colledges called Medressae, at Constantinople, Andrinople, Bursia, and other places, in which they liue, and studie their prophane Diuinitie and Law, and haue among them nine seuerall steps or degrees vnto the high∣est dignitie. The first is called Softi, which are yong studēts. The 2.are Calfi, who are readers vnto the first. The 3.Hogi, writers of books (for they wil suffer no printing) The 4. are Naipi, or yong Doctors, which may supply the place of Iugdes, in their absence. The 5. Caddi.
Iudges of their law, and Iustices to punish offenders; of which there is one at least in euery Citie through the Turkish dominion: and are knowne from other men by their huge Turbants, two yards in compasse. The sixth are Muderisi, which ouersee the Caddies doings, and are as Suffragans to their Bishops; who are the seuenth sort, and are called Mulli, which place and displace Church-men at their pleasure. The eighth, Cadilescari, who are but two great and principall Iudges or Cardinals, the one of Grae∣cia, the other of Natolia: and these two sit euery day in the Diuano among the Bassas and are in great reputation. The ninth is the Muftee, who is among the Turkes, as the Pope among the Roman Catholikes. When the Bassas punish any offence against their law, they send to him. He may not abase himselfe to sit in the Diuano, neither when he comes into the presence of the Grand Seignior, will he vouchsafe to kisse his hand, or to giue any more reuerence, then he receiueth. The great Sultan ariseth to honor him, when he comes vnto him, and then they both sit downe face to face, and so talke and conferre together. No man can ascend to this place, but by the dignities aforesaid. Mahomet Pag.1161. the third, forced by a tumult of the Ianizaries to present himselfe vnto them, came accompanied with the Mufti, and some few others of the reuerend Do∣ctors of their law, who were by the Sultan commanded to sit downe, whiles the great Baslas abode standing. Such respect is had to these men. Thus much Knolles. In the booke Cap.24. of the Policie of the Turkish Empire, it is said, that the Mufti's authoritie is like to that of the Iewish high Priest, or Roman Pope. I rather esteeme it like to that of the twelue Patriarkes, as binding not all Mahumetans, but the Turkes only: whereas the one had, the other challengeth a subiection of all, which professe their religion. That Author also affirmeth, that whensoeuer the Mufti goeth abroad forth of his owne house (which he vseth to doe very seldome) his vse and custome is, first to goe and visite the Emperour: who as soone as he seeth him comming to salute him, and to doe him reuerence, presently ariseth out of his seat, and embracing him with great kindnesse, entertaineth him very friendly and louingly, causing him to sit downe by him, and giuing him the honor of the place. His authority, saith L. Soranzo. part.2.cap.61. Soranzo, is so great, that none will openly contradict the Mufties sentence: but yet if the Emperour be setled in a resolution, the Mufti with feare or flattery inclines vnto him. Next to the Mufti is the Cadile scher, Cadilescher. who being also chosen by the Emperour, may be compared to those, whom the Christians cal Patriarches, or else to the Primates and Metropolitans of a Kingdome. Of these there are now in this encreased greatnesse of the Turkish Empire, three: whereas it seemeth that they had in the time of Baiazet but one, and long after (as before is said) but two. To one of these is assigned Europe, namely, so much thereof as is subiect to the Turke, for his Prouince: To the second, Natolia or Turkie: to the third, Syria and Egypt, with the parts adioyning. There were but two Cadileschers, till Selim wanne Syria and Egypt, and erected a third. But Magin. So∣ranzo saith, that this third of Cairo is not rightly called Cadilescher, but should rather be called the great Cadi. Out of all which Prouinces, whatsoeuer causes come to be determined, by appeale or otherwise, they are brought to be decided before the Ca∣dilescher of the same Prouince whence they arise: notwithstanding that the abode of each of them be continually, or for the most part, at Constantinople, or elsewhere, wheresoeuer the Emperour holdeth his Court. The honor done to them, is little lesse then to the Mufti, for that their authoritie is ouer Priest and people, temporall and spi∣rituall: they are also learned in their law, aged and experienced. Of the Muderisi and Mulli, I can say no more then I haue done. Next to these are the Cadi, Cadi. which are sent abroad and dispersed into euery City and Towne of the Turkish Empire: which besides their Andr.Ariu. Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction (as I may terme it) in forcing men to their religious obseruations, are as it were, Iusticers and gouernours of the places. So neere glued are the Offices and Officers, the religion and politie of the Turkes. There are other which are not sent forth, which are called Choza, that is, Elders. These, with the Talismans, haue the ordering of their parishio∣nall
Churches: the Thalisman calling the people to Prayer, and the Choza executing the Seruice and Preaching; and in absence, each supplying others office. Menavino Modecis. more distinctly, and in other names, numbreth those Church-officers. The Modecis is a Gouernour of an Hospitall, receiuing & disposing the rents, with the other customes thereof. Their Schoole-degrees are before spoken of, out of Knolles. Some Policie of the Turkish Empire. Antippi. adde to these former, these other Priests, of baser condition. The Antippi are certaine Priests which vpon Friday (called of them Glumaagun, and is obserued as their Sabbath, be∣cause Mahomet was borne on that day) and on other their fasting & feasting-dayes, after they haue vsed diuerse Ceremonies in a certaine place in the middest of the Tem∣ple, about thirtie steppes high, from thence reade vnto the people something concer∣ning the life of Mahomet. After which, two little boyes stand vp and sing certaine Prayers: Which being ended, the Priest and all the people sing a Psalme with a low voice, and then for halfe an houre together they crie Illah illelah, i. there is but one GOD. After all this, one of those Antippi, out of that high place, sheweth forth vnto the people a Launce and Scimitar, with exhortation to vse their swords and launces in defence of their Religion. Of the Imam and Meizin Imam. Meizin. Sophi. is elsewhere shewed, that the one calls the people to the Mosche or Meschit, the other there celebrateth publike orisons. The Sophi also are certaine Clerkes or Priests, imployed in the singing of Psalmes and Hymnes, after their manner, in their Churches at the times of publike Prayers. All these inferior orders of Priests are chosen by the people, and haue a certaine sti∣pend allowed them by the Emperour, which yet is so small, that many of them are dri∣uen to vse either writing of Bookes, or Handicrafts and Trades for their liuing, and are clothed like lay-men. They haue Bar. Geor∣gieviz. no great learning, it is sufficient if they can reade the Alcoran; which being written in Arabian, they are as loth to haue translated into the vulgar, as the Papists are to haue the Scripture. He which can interprete, and make some Exposition of the Text, is of profound learning. Yet are they reuerenced: and if a Turke doe strike or offer outrage to them, he looseth his hand; and if he be a Christi∣an, his life; being sure to be burned. Some say, that now of late some of them are more studious of Astronomie and other Arts. As for those superiour rankes, no doubt may be made of their high account. The Cadelescher is clothed in Chamlet, Satten, Silke, Damaske, or Veluet of seemely colour, as Russet, or Tawnio, and of Purple-coloured Cloth with long sleeues. Their Tulipan on their head is of maruellous greatnes, sharpe in the middest, of Purple or Russet colour, deeper and thicker then others; their beards great. They ride on Geldings, with Purple foot-cloths fringed; and when they goe on foot, they goe slowly, representing a stately and sacred grauitie. There is another order of sacred persons, which yet are neither regular nor secular, by any vow or ordination, but had in that account for their birth, being supposed to descend of the line of Mahumet. The Turks and Tartarians call them Seiti or Sithi, the Moores Seriffi. These weare greene Tulipans, which colour none else may weare, and that onely on their head. Some Christians, ignorant hereof, haue had their apparrell cut from their backes, for wearing somewhat greene about them. These they call He∣mir. They enioy many priuiledges, especially in giuing testimonie, wherein one of these is as much as two other, which they abuse to iniurie and wrong. The most of them are Moores, which goe tenne or fifteene in a companie, with a banner on a staffe, hauing a Moone on the top; and that which is giuen for GODS sake, they sit and eate in the street, where also they make their prayers, and are poorely clad. Like to these (in pri∣uiledge and prauiledge) are the Chagi or Fagi, which liue on almes like Friers. They attend on the publike Prayers, on the holy Reliques, on the Corpses and Funerals of the dead, and to prey on the liuing by false oathes.
CHAP. XV. Of the Regions and Religions of ASIA MINOR, since called Natolia and Turkie. NExt after the Turkish Religion thus related, it seemeth fittest to dis∣course of the auncient names and limits of Regions, and of the for∣mer Heathenish Religions of that part of the Turkish Dominion, which among Authors Haiton. Maginus. Francisco Tha∣mara, & alij. hath since, in a singular eminencie, obtained the name of Turkie. And if it seeme strange, that the Turkish Reli∣gion (a newer vpstart) be declared before those former of the Pagans, the matter we had in hand hath thus altered our method, that after wee had described the deformed dis-ioynted lineaments of the Mother, an Arabian Saracen, her more mis-shapen Daughter, this Turkish Mopsa, might attend her hard at her heeles. As for the Region, we haue followed the Turkish forces hither: and now that wee haue glutted our selues with the view of their later affaires of State and Religion, let vs cast our eyes about vs, and obserue the Countrie it selfe, which because of her long and entire subiection to this Nation, is styled by their Turcia, & Turcia Maior. name. The Greekes Mel. & Peu∣cer. lib.5. The Greekes called this, A∣sia simply, as being best knowne to them. called it Natolia, , because it was the Easterne part of that Empire, as they cal∣led Thracia, the Countrie about Constantinople (which was named N  P  ) Ro∣mania. This Natolia, or Anatolia, is of others called Asia Minor: and yet Asia, in most proper and strict accompt, is peculiarly applyed to one Region in this great Chersonesus, or Peninsula, containing besides, Pontus, Bithynia, Lycia, Galatia, Pamphilia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Armenia Minor. It was bounded on the East with Euphrates (now Frat); on the South, with the Mediterranean Sea: on the West, with the Archipelago: on the North, with the Blacke Sea, stretching in length from 51. to 72. degrees of Longitude, and in breadth from 36 ½. to 45. This Countrey hath beene aunciently renowmed for Armes and Arts: now the This part of Asia hath been exceedingly subiect to Earhquakes: in the time of Tiberius twelue Cities were by them pro∣strate in one night, Nig. . graue of the carkasses, or some ruinous bones rather and stonie Reliques of the carkasses of more then foure thousand Places and Cities, sometimes inhabited. Many changes hath it sustained by the Aegyptian, Persian, Macedonian, Roman, Tartarian, and Tur∣kish generall Conquests, besides such exploits as Croesus and Mithridates of olde, and the Westerne Christians of later times, haue therein atchieued. Let the studi∣ous of these things search them in their proper Authors: our taske is Religion, whose ouer-worne, and almost out-worne steppes, with much curious hunting in many Hi∣stories, we haue thus weakely traced. Of the Turkes we haue alreadie spoken, and we leaue the Christians (for why should we mixe Light with Darknesse?) to their proper place. For euen yet, besides the Armenians, there remaine many Christians of the Greeke Church in Cappadocia, and other parts of this Region. Next vnto those parts of Syria before deliuered, are situate in this lesser Asia, Cili∣cia, Armenia Minor, and Cappadocia. Cappadocia, called also Leucosyria, and now Amasia, stretcheth foure hundred and fiftie myles along the Euxine Sea, bounded on the West with Paphlagonia, Galatia, and part of Pamphylia; on the South, with Ci∣l icia; on the East, with the Hills Antitaurus and Moschius, and part of Euphrates. Here runneth Halys, the end of Croesus Empire both in the site and fate thereof; the doubtfull Oracle here giuing him a certaine ouerthrow. For when he consulted with the same touching his Expedition against Cyrus, he receiued answere, That passing Halys, he should ouer-turne a great State; which he interpreting actiuely of his At∣tempts against Cyrus, verified it passiuely in himselfe. And here, besides other streames, slideth Thermodon, sometime made famous by the bordering Amazones. Of which Manly foeminine people, auncient Authors disagree: Theophrastus deriuing them from the Sauromatoe; Salust fetching them from Tanais; P. Diaconus describing
them in Germanie; Trogus and Iustine reporting them Scythians; Diodorus cros∣sing the Seas to finde them in Lybia, and thence also, in a further search, passing in∣to an Island in the Atlantike Ocean; Ptolomey and Curtius placing them neerer the Caspian Sea; Strabo Strab l.11. doubting whether there euer had beene such a people, or no. Some haue found them out anew in the new world, Riuer of Amazones. naming that huge Ri∣uer of them. Goropius confidently auoucheth them to be the wiues and sonnes of the Sarmatians or Cimbrians: who, together with their husbands, inuaded Asia. And this he proueth by Dutch Etymologies and other coniectures. Which, if it be true, sheweth, that their Religion was the same with the Scythian. They Gram. ex Statio. are said to haue worshipped Mars, of whome they faine themselues to be descended. Religi∣on it were to speake of their Religion, of whose being we haue no better certainetie. Strabo Strab.l.12. writeth, That in the places ascribed to the Amazones, Apollo was exceeding∣ly worshipped. In Cappadocia was seated the Citie Comana, wherein was a Temple of Bellona, and a great multitude of such as were there inspired and rauished by deuillish illusion, and of sacred seruants. It was inhabited by the people called Cataones, who being subiect to a King, did neuerthelesse obey the Priest that was, in great part, Lord of the Temple, and of the sacred seruants, whose number (when Strabo was there) a∣mounted to sixe thousand and vpwards of men and women. The Priest receiued the reuenue of the Region next adioyning to the Temple, and was in honour next to the King in Cappadocia, and commonly of the same kindred. These idolatrous Rites are supposed to haue beene brought hither out of Taurica Scythia by Orestes and his sister Iphigenia, where humane sacrifices were offered to Diana. Here, at the solemne Feasts of Bellona, those sacred seruants, before-mentioned, called Comani, wounded each other in an extaticall furie; bloudie Rites sitting Bellona's solemnities. Solinus. Argaeus, whose hoarie head was couered continually with Snow, was reputed a religious Hill, and Habitation of some God. Strabo Strab.l.12. reporteth of the Temple of Apollo Catanius, in Dastacum; and of another of Iupiter in Morimena, which had three thousand of those sacred seruants or religi∣ous Votaries, which as an inferior Order were at the commaund of the Priest, who re∣ceiued of his Temples reuenue fifteene Talents, and was reputed in the next ranke of honour to the Priest of Comana. Not farre hence is Castabala, where was the Temple of Diana Persica Strab.l.12. Coel.26.6.33. , where the sacred or deuoted women were reported to goe bare-footed on burning coales with∣out harme. It is reported Vadiani epit. , That if a Snake did bite a Cappadocian, the mans bloud was poyson to the Snake, and killed him. Many excellent Worthies hath this Region yeelded to the world. Mazaca (after∣wards of Claudius called Caesarea) was the Episcopall Seat of Great Basill: Cucusum, the Receptacle of exiled Chrysostome: Amasia (now a Prouinciall Citie of the Tur∣kish Beglerbegs) sometime the Countrey of Strabo, to whome these our Relations are so much indebted: Nissa and Nazianzum, of which, the two Gregories receiued their surnames. But that humane and diuine learning is now trampled vnder the bar∣barous foot of the Ottoman-horse. Here is Trapezonde also, whilome bearing the prowd name of an Empire. Licaonia, the chiefe Citie whereof is Iconium, celebrated in holy Writ, (and a long time the Royall Seat of the first Turkes in Asia, and since of Caramania, now Conia, or Cogne, inhabited with Greekes, Turkes, Iewes, Arabi∣ans, and Armenians) is of Ptolomey adioyned to Cappadocia. And so is Diopolis, cal∣led before Cabira, since Augusta, which Ortelius placeth in the lesser Armenia: a Re∣gion which hath on the South Cilicia; on the East, Euphrates; on the West, Cap∣padocia. In Diopolis was the Temple of the Moone had in great veneration, much like, in the Rites thereof, to that before mentioned of Comana: which although it bare Comana Cap∣padociae, & Pon∣tica, Strab.l.12. the surname of Cappadocia, yet Ptolomey placeth it in this Armenia; and Comana Pon∣tica, in Cappadocia, of the same name and superstitious deuotion to the same God∣desse. Thence haue they taken the patterne of their Temple, of their Rites, Ceremo∣nies,
Diuinations, respect to their Priests. And twice a yeare, in the Feastes, which were called, The Goddesse her going out, the Priest ware a Diademe. He was second to none, but the King: which Priesthood was holden of some of Strabo's progenitors. Pompey bestowed the Priesthood of this Temple vpon Archelaus, and added to the Temples Reuenue two Schoeni. that is, threescore surlongs of ground, commaunding the inhabitants to yeeld him obedience. He had also power ouer the sacred seruants, which were no lesse then sixe thousand. Lycomedes after enioyed that Prelacie, with foure Schoeni of land added thereto: Caesar remoued him, placing in his roome Ditcutus, the sonne of Adiatorix, whome (with his wife and children) he had led in triumph, purposing to slay his elder sonne, together with him. But when the younger persuaded the souldiers, that he was the elder, and both contended which should die, Ditcutus was of his parents counselled to yeeld to the younger, and to remaine aliue, to be a stay to their familie. Which pietie Caesar hearing of, grieuing for the death of the other, he thus rewarded. At the Feasts aforesaid is great recourse of men and women hither. Many Pilgrims resort to dis∣charge their vowes. Great store of women is there, which for the most part are deuo∣ted; this Citie being as a little Corinth. For many went to Corinth, in respect of the multitude of Harlots prostituted or consecrated to Venus. Zela, another Citie, hath in it the Temple of Anais, much reuerenced of the Ar∣menians; wherein the Rites are solemnized with greatest Sanctimonie, and Oathes taken of greatest consequence. The sacred Seruants and Priestly Honours are as the former. The Kings did sometime esteeme Zela, not as a Citie, but as a Temple of the Persian Gods; and the Priest had supreame power of all things, who with a great multitude of those sacred Seruants inhabited the same. The Romans encreased their Reuenues. In Cappadocia the Persian Religion was much vsed: but of the Persian Rites see more lib.4. in our Tractat of Persia. The The infa∣mous leudnes of the Cappado∣cians. leudnesse of the Cappadocians grew into a Prouerbe; if any were enormiously wicked, he was therefore called a Cappadocian. Galatia, or Gallograecia, so called of the Galli, 300000 Galli. which vnder the conduct of Bren∣nus (sayth Suidas) assembled an Armie of three hundred thousand, and seeking ad∣uentures in foraine parts, diuided themselues: some inuading Greece, others Thrace and Asia, where they setled themselues betweene Bithynia and Cappadocia. On the South it is confined with Pamphiiia, and on the North is washed with the Euxine Sea the space of two hundred and fiftie myles. Sinope, the mother and nursing-Citie of Mithridates is here seated: one of the last Cities of Asia that subiected it selfe to Turkish bondage, in the dayes of Mahomet the second. Of the Galatae were three Tribes, Trogini, Tolistobogi. and Tectosages; all which Goropius deriueth from the Cimmerij. At Tavium, which was inhabited with the Trogini, was a brazen Statue of Iupiter: and his Temple was a priuiledged Sanctuarie. The Tolistobogi had for their chiefe Mart Pisinus, wherein was a great Temple of the Mother of the Gods, whome they called Andigista, had in great veneration; whose Priests had sometime beene mightie. This Temple was magnificently builded of the Attalian Kings, with the Porches also of white stone. And the Romanes, by depriuing the same of the Goddesses Statue (which they sent for to Rome, as they did that of Aesculapius out of Epidaurus) added much reputation of Religion thereunto. The Hill Dindyma ouer∣looketh the Citie, of which she was named Dindymena, as of Cybelus (which Ortelius supposeth to be the same) Cybele. Of the Galatians, Deiotarus was King: but more fame hath befallen them by Paules Epistle to them. Plutarch Plut. Serino & dsptatio materia. tells a Historie of a Galatian woman, named Camma, worthie our re∣citall. She was faire and noble (the daughter of Diana's Priest) and richly married to Sinatus the Terrarch. But Sinorix, a man richer and mightier then he, became his vniust corriuall, and because he durst not attempt violence to her, her husband li∣uing, he slew him. Camma solaced her selfe as she could, cloystering her selfe in Diae∣na's Temple, and admitting none of her mightie suiters. But when Sinorix had also moued that suit, she seemed not vnwilling: and when he came to desire her marri∣age,
she went forth to meete him, and with gentle entertainement brought him into the Temple vnto the Altar, where she dranke to him in a cup of poysoned liquor, and hauing taken off almost halfe, she reached him the rest: which after shee saw he had drunke, she called vpon her husbands name alowd, saying; Hitherto haue I liued sorrowfull without thee, waiting this day, now welcome me vnto thee: For I haue reuenged they slaughter on the most wicked amongst men, and haue beene compani∣on and partner with thee in life, with him in death. And thus died they both. The like manly womanhood (if a Christian might commend that, which none but a Chri∣stian can discommend) Valerius Val. Max. l.6. c.1. Maximus sheweth of Ghiomara her Countrey∣woman, wife of Ortyagon, a great man amongst the Tectosages: who, in the warres of Manilius the Consull, being taken prisoner, was committed to the custodie of a Tribune, who forced her to his pleasure. After that agreement was made for her ran∣some, and the money brought to the place appointed, whiles the Tribune was busie a∣bout the receit thereof, she caused her Gallograecians to cut off his head, which shee carried to her husband, in satisfaction of her wrong. At the Funerals of the Galatians Alex. ab A∣lexandro; genial: dierum, l.3.c.7. they obserued this custome, to write letters and hurle them into that latest and fatall fire, supposing that their deceased friends should reade them in the other world. At their Sacrifices Gen. dier.l.4.c.17. they vsed not an Aruspex, or Divinour, which gazed in the Entrailes, but a Philosopher, without whome they thought no Sacrifice acceptable to their Gods. The Devill certaine was the God to whome their humane Sacrifices were acceptable, which in devillish inhumanitie they offered at their bloudie Altars Ibid.l.6.c.26. , when they diuined of things to come, which they did by his falling, by the dismembring and flowing forth of his bloud. Athenus. Athenaus out of Philarchus telleth of one Ariannes, a rich Galatian, which feasted the whole Nation a whole yeare together, with Sacrifices of Bulls, Swine, Sheepe, and other prouision, made readie in great Cauldrons, prouided of purpose for this enter∣tainement, that he made them in spacious Boothes, which he had therefore built. Pausanias sayth, That the Pesinuntian Galatians abstained from Swines flesh. The Legend of Agdistis and Atte, which hee there addeth, is too filthie to relate. At Strabo, l.12. Tavium was a brazen Image of Iupiter, and his Temple was a priuiledged San∣ctuarie. Betweene D.Niger.Asiae Com.1.Maginus the mouth of Pontus, the Thracian Bosphorus, and part of Propontis on the West, and Galatia on the East, part of the Euxine Sea on the North, and Asia (properly so called) on the South, is situate the prouince called by the double name Pontic gentes à Pontico cogno∣minatae mari, L.Flor.l.3.c.5. of Pontus and Bythinia. They were sometimes two Prouinces, diuided by the Riuer Sangarius: now they are called Bursia by Giraua; by Castaldus, Becsangial. The most famous Cities therein are, or rather haue beene, Nice, famous sometime for Neptunes Temple, but more for the first generall Councel therein celebrated: Nicomedia, some∣times the seate of Emperours, now ruinous: Apamia, and Prusa or Bursa nigh to the mount Olympus, where the first Ottomans had their seat royall, and all of that race, ex∣cept the great Turkes themselues, are still buried: Chalcedon, built seuenteene yeares before Byzantium; and therefore the builders accounted blinde, which neglected that better seate. Here was a famous Councell of six hundred and thirty Bishops. Of their anent Kings others haue related: but one cannot passe this our Historie with∣out obseruation, and that is Mithridates Gramaye Pontica. Iustin.l.37. L.Florus. T.Liuij Epitom. , the sixt King of that name: who loosing his father in the eleuenth yeare of his age, by his tutors was trecherously assailed, but escaped, and by vse of that antidote, which of him still beareth the name Mithridate, out-liued their poysoning conspiracie. He liued indeede to the death of thousands, which either his crueltie or his warres consumed. Foure yeares together (to auoide their Treasons) he liued in the Fields and Woods, vnder a shew of hunting; both pre∣uenting their designes, and inuring himselfe to hardnesse. He spake two and twentie Languages, being Lord of so many Nations. He held warres with the Romans sixe and fortie yeares, whome those renowmed Captaines, Sylla, Lucullus, Pompey, did so conquer, as he alway rose againe with great lustre, and with greater terrour: and at last died not by his enemies commaund, but voluntarily in his old age, and his owne
Kingdome, neuer made to attend the Romane Triumphs; Sylla's felicitie, Lucullus prowesse, and Pompeyes greatnesse notwithstanding. His aspiring thoughts had gree∣dily swallowed the Soueraigntie both of Asia and Europe. He caused, in one night, all the Romanes in his Dominions to be slaine: in which massacre perished a hundred and fiftie thousand, as some haue numbred. But it cannot be conceiued (sayth P.Oros.l.6.c.2. Oro∣sius) how many there were, or how great was the griefe both of the doers and suffe∣rers, when euery one must betray his innocent guests and friends, or hazard his owne life; no Law of Hospitalite, no Religion of Sanctuarie, or reuerence of Images being sufficient protection. And no maruell, if he spared not his enemies, when Cap.5. he slew Exipodras and Homochares his sonnes; and after the poysonings and voluntarie death of Monyma his wife, Statira and Roxane, his daughters. His sonne Pharnaces (like to tast of the same cup) wonne to his part his fathers Armie, sent against him, with which he pursued his father so hotely, that he, hauing denounced a heauie curse vpon him, en∣tred amongst his Wiues, Concubines, and Daughters, and gaue them poyson, pled∣ging them in the same liquor; which his bodie, accustomed to his Antidotes, easily ouercame, and therefore was faine to entreat another to open a bloudie passage for that his cruell soule. A man (sayth Orosius) of all men most superstitious, alway ha∣uing with him Philosophers and men expert in all Arts, now threescore and foure∣teene yeares old. The Religion in Pontus was little differing from the Greekes. We reade of the Sacrifices of this King to Ceres, and to Iupiter Bellipotens, in which the King brought the first wood to the fire. He powred also thereon Honey, Milke, Wine, Oyle, and after made a Feast. In honour of Neptune they drowned Charriots, drawne with foure white Horses, with which (it seemed) they would haue him ease himselfe in his Sea-voyages. Ortel. in Parerg.Dom. Nig.Asiae an.1. At the mouth of Pontus was the Temple of Iupiter Ia∣sus, called Panopeum: and nigh thereto, a Promontorie sacred to Diana, sometime an Island, ioyned to the Continent by an Earthquake. Hereabouts was the Caue Ache∣rusium, whose bottomelesse bottome was thought to reach to Hell. I may in the next place set downe Paphlagonia, which, as it fareth with such as haue mightie neighbours, can scarcely finde her proper limits. Some Maginus. Gramay. Strab.l.12. Epitom in Strab. reckon it to Galatia, before described; and sometimes Pontus hath shared it: and either the force of Armes, or bountie of Emperours, hath assigned it at other times to Phrygia, Cilicia, or other parts. The bounds thereof are thus deliuered: Pontus confineth on the North; on the East, the Riuer Halys; on the South, Phrygia and Galatia; on the West, Bithynia. Of the people hereof, called Heneti, some Maginus. deriue the Veneti of Ita∣lie. They now call it Roni. It had the name Paphlagonia of Paphlagon, the sonne of Phineus. The Mount Olgasys is very high, and in the same are many Paphlagonian Temples. Sandaracurgium is another Mountaine, made hollow by the Mettall-mi∣ners, which were wont to be slaues redeemed from capitall Sentence, who here ex∣changed that speedie death for a more lingering one. So deadly is the Alpha and O∣mega, the beginning and ending, of this Idoll of the World: which the Spaniards haue verified in the West, by the destruction of another world. The Heptacometae and Mossynoeci inhabited about these parts; Coel. Rhod. l.18 c.30. a people of that beastly disposition, that they performed the most secret worke of Nature in publike view. These are not so much notorious for being worse then beasts, as their neigh∣bours, the Tibareni, for surpassing in iustice other men. They would not warre on their enemie, but would faithfully before relate vnto him the Time, Place, and Houre of their fight; whereas the Mosynoeci vsed to assault strangers that trauelled by them very trecherously. They haue also a venomous kinde of Honey growing out of their Trees, with which they beguiled and slew three troupes of Pompey. The Tibareni ob∣serued one strange fashion, that when the woman was deliuered of a child, her hus∣band lay in, and kept his chamber, the women officiously attending him.
CHAP. XVI. Of Asia propriè dicta: now called Sarcum. THIS Region (in this strict sense) being a particular prouince of the lesser Asia, Ptol. l.5, c.2, Maginus. Ortelius in Parergo. is bounded on the West with part of Propontis, and Hellespont, the Aegean, Icarian and Myrtoan seas: on the South, with the Rhodian sea, Lycia, and Pamphilia: on the East, with Galatia; on the North with Pontus and Bythinia, and part of Propontis. In which space are con∣tained Phrygia, Caria, and both Mysia's, Aeolis, Ionia, Doris, Lydia. Some Vadians. circumcise from hence both Phrygia, and Mysia, alledging the authoritie of Act.16.6. S. Luke. But in the Apocalypse c. 1. these parts are also added. and 1. Pet. 1. 1. Phrygia is diuided into the greater, which lyeth Eastward: and the lesse, called also Hellespontiaca & Troas, & of some Epictetus. The greater Phrygia hath not many cities. Here stood Midaium, the royall seate of Mydas, and Apamia the Phrygian Metropolis, Plin.l.5.c.9. Phrygia is called of the riuer Phryx, which diuideth it frō Caria. Herodotus telleth Herodot.l.2. that the Phrygians were accounted the most ancient of all people: for the trial wherof, Psam∣metichus King of Egipt had shut vp, without societie of any humane creature, two chil∣dren, causing only Goates to be admitted to suckle them, who after long time pronoun∣ced bee which they had learned of the Goates: but because that (with the Phrygians) signified bread, therefore they accounted the Phrygians first authors of mankinde. Be∣fore Deucalions floud, Nannacus Suida. is reported to raigne there, and foreseeing the same to haue assembled his people into the Temple, with supplications and prayers. Hence grew the prouerbe to say; A thing was from Nannacus, which was exceeding old. Ma∣ny antiquities are told of their Gods: whose Theologie thus is recited Eusde praep l.2.4. by Eusebius. The Phrygians tell, that Meon was the most ancient King of Phrygia, the father of Cybele, who inuented the pipe called Syrinx, and was named the Mountaine-mother, beloued of Marsyas. But when as Attis had raised her belly, her father slaying him and his fellowes, she, enraged with madnesse, ran vp and downe the countrey. Marsyas romed with her, who after, being ouercome in a Musicall contention of Apollo, was flaied quicke. After these things did Apollo loue Cybele, with whom she wandered to the Hyperboreans: and by his command the body of Attis was buried, and Cybele obtained diuine honours. Hence it is, that euen to this day the Phrygians bewaile the yong mans death. In Pes∣sinus a Citie of Phrygia (after reckoned to Galatia) they erected a Temple to Attis, and Cybele. After the death of Hyperion, the children of Coelus parted the kingdom amongst them, the most famous of which were Atlas and Saturne: to the first of which befell the parts adioining to the Ocean. He had great skill in Astronomie. Of his seuen daughters were procreated many of the Gods and Heroes: and of Maia the eldest, and Iupiter, was Mercury begotten. Saturne the sonne of Atlas being couetous and wicked, mar∣ried Cybele his Sister, and had by her Iupiter. They tell of another Iupiter, brother of Coelus, and King of Crete, (but there and here they are so entangled with Fables, that the least inquirie hath most ease and no lesse certaintie.) This Cretan held the Empire of the world, and had ten sonnes, whom they call Curetes: his Sepulchre they shew to this day. Saturne (the brother of Atlas) raigned in Italy and Sicilia, till Iupiter his sonne dis∣possessed him, who proued a seuere Prince to the wicked, and bountifull to the good. Thus much Eusebius of the Phrygian diuinitie out of their owne Legends, the mysteries whereof he after vnfoldeth. Other tales they had, as, that Minerua killed there a fire-breathing beast; of Philemon and Baucis: and such like, mentioned by the Poets Mae∣ander making warres with the Pessinuntians vowed for sacrifice whatsoeuer he rst met after he returned with conquest, which he performed on Archelaus his sonne, o∣uercomming, Gramay. saith one, pietie with pietie. Impious is that pietie which destroyeth hu∣manitie, and diuelish cruelty both in the idoll and idolater: as appeared also in the e∣uent, (if our story be true) the father rewarding such pietie with greater impietie on himselfe, and casting himselfe into the riuer, left his name therevnto. The like is told of the riuers Sagaris and Scamander. Hercules, when hee went with the Argonautes to
Colchos, came on shore on Phrygia to amend his oare, and being thirstie sent his swee∣ting Hylas to the riuer for water, who falling therein was drowned, wherevpon he (leauing his companions) wondered in the woods, bemoning his Hylas. About these times Tantalus A mirrour for Misers. liued in these parts, a man besides other vices excee∣dingly couetous, not sparing the Temples of the Gods. Hence arose the Fable that hee was punished in Hell with perpetuall hunger and thirst, whiles pleasant waters, & dainty fruits did offer themselues to his mouth, but when he would haue tasted them, fled from him. So indeed doth Mammon torment his followers, making them to want as well that which they haue, as that which they haue not, the medicine being the increaser of the disease, as when fire is quenched with Oile: like Gardners Asses laden with good hearbes, a burthen to them, foode for others, themselues glad to feede on Thistles. And how many Tantali doe we daily see induring a hunger and thirst in the middest of their abundance? a monstrous and vnnaturall sicknes, to hunger after that which they haue, yet cannot, yet will not feede on; a dropsie-thirst, saue that they dare not drinke that, which they haue and thirst for. Vnworthy of that life, which he sacrificeth to that, which neuer had the dignitie to be mortall: vnworthy that body, which he pineth with plen∣tie; or that soule, which he damneth for a fancy of hauing; or that nature of man which he confineth to the Galleys, to the Mines, in the seruice of a peece of earth; vnworthy of the name of christian, whose CHRIST was, to one of his Indus. Mat. 26.15. forefathers, worth thirty pence, but now this will sell him for three halfe pence, for a peece of bread, yea, like Ae∣sops dog, for the shadow of a peece of bread; vnworthy of any thing, saue that his coue∣tise, to be his tempter, his tormentor, his fury, his diuell: Once, pitty it is, that he priseth a halter so deare, else would he rid the world of a burthen, & himself of his worthlesse life. But whether hath Tantalus carried me? Take heed (reader) he do not carry thee further, or thou him, beyond words: They say he would haue sacrificed his son Pephilops, had not diuine power releeued him: thou art like to finde him Tantalus still. What the Poets tell of Ganymedes euery one knowes; of Niobe famous for her sonnes and daughters, which she lost all in one day: of Mydas (another Tantalus) whose couetousnes became a new Alchymie The Fable was that Mydas hauing his wish granted, wish∣ed all that he touched might become golde: & so his meate was golde and starued him. to turne all into Golde. And how doth this two-fould Alchymie gull the world? the one making with vaine hopes a rich estate become poore, the other with full haps making all Gold but the man; onely the Romane La Noue dis∣course. Alchimist is Maister of that Art, which the former professe, that turnes so easily a little Lead into so much good gold: onely the wise man, wise in the later, to bee Maister of himselfe and his wealth, not a slaue to passion or pelfe. And yet Mydas in a publike calamitie, (happening by an Earthquake, which swallowed vp houses) warned by an Oracle, to cast into those gaping iawes of the Earth that which was most precious: hurled therein much treasure (what could he thinke more precious: and how much more easily would ma∣ny a Mydas haue hurled in himselfe?) But the Earth not yet satisfied would not close vp her mouth, till his sonne Anchurus, (esteeming man to bee most precious) leaped in, and the reconciled Element receiued an Altar in witnesse of his haughtie courage. There were many Phrygian Kings named Mydas. The Phrygians sacrificed to the Riuers Maeander and Marsias: they placed their Priests after death vpon stone, ten cubits high. They Stobaeus. did not sweare, or force others to an oath: they were much addicted to diuination by Birds. Macrobius Macrob.l.I.21. applyeth their tales of Cybele, and Attis to the Sunne. Silenus is reckoned among the Phry∣gian deities: whom Goropij, Bec∣ces. Goropius fetcheth out of Scythia, and maketh him Mydas his Maister in Geography and Philosophy: The diligent attendance of the Scholler was occasion to that Fable of his long eares: the learning of the Maister gaue him diuine honours. In Phrygia on the Riuers Sangarius stood Gordie (or as Arrianus Ar.l.2. calleth it, Gordion) of which he reporteth that when Alexander came thither, hee had a great desire to see the tower, in which was the place of Gordius & Midas, that he might behold the shafts or became of Gordius his cart, & the indissoluble knot fastned therto. For great was the fame therof amongst the next adioining people: that Gordius was one of the auncient inha∣bitants of Phrygia, hauing a little place of ground, and two yokes of Oxen, the
one he vsed to the plough, the other to the waine or Cart. And while hee was one day at plough, an Eagle sate vpon the yoke, and there continued till euening. Gordius, asto∣nished at so ominous a token, went to the Telmissean sooth-sayers (for to the Telmis∣sean both men and women this diuining science seemed haereditary) and there met with a Virgin, whom he acquainted with this accident: she counselled him to returne thither and to sacrifice to Iupiter the King, for the augury was good. Gordius entreated her com∣pany with him, that she might instruct him how to sacrifice, which shee granted vnto him, and afterwards her selfe also in Marriage. These had betwixt them Midas, a pro∣per stripling. Now, a sedition happening among the Phrygians, they consulted with the oracle, which answered that a Cart should bring them a King, that should end that sedi∣tion. And whiles they were musing on this answere, Midas came riding in his Cart (with his parents) into the throng, and was by the Phrygians forthwith acknowledged King. The Carre, in memory hereof, was hāged vp to Iupiter in the tower (or temple of Iupiter, Qu. Curt.l.3. so Cursius calleth it) with thanks for that Eagle (Iupiters Bird) sent before to fore-signifie thus much to his Father. The knot fastned vnto it, was of the barke of the Comell or dogge-tree, wouen with such Arte that a man could neither finde beginning nor ende thereof. Bruted it was amongst the Phrygians, that he which could vntie it should be Lord of all Asia. Alexander turning it to and fro, and with vaine curiositie sear∣ching how to loosen it, at last with his Sword chopped it in sunder least he should o∣therwise leaue some scruple in the hearts of his Souldiours. Thus farre Arrianus. In the Lesser Phrygia, (of a Hill therein, called Idaea; of a Riuer, Xanthe, of the Kings, Troas, Dardania, &C.) stood that eye of Asia, and starre of the East, called Ili∣um or Troy. Of which, all that I can say will but obscure the renowne and glory, which all heathen Antiquitie haue by an vniuersall consent of poesie, and historie, giuen to it. And what Greeke or Latine Author hath not mentioned her ruines, and done exequies to her funerall? Dardanus is named her founder, after whom, and his succeeding sonne Ericthonius, Tros ruled, who erected the Temple of Pallas, and reedified the Citie, lea∣uing thereto his name. To him succeeded Ilus, and after him his sonne Laomedon, whom Neptune and Apollo helped in repairing the Citie: which Hercules sacked, and Priamus restored, but to a greater losse, by the Graecians ten yeers siege, and one nights spoile. Dares, Daret. Dictys Homer. E∣ipid. Virg. Ouid. Horat. S∣neca. Silius. Sta∣tius. Claud. &c. and Dictys, supposed historians of those times, besides Homer, and the Greekes and Latines his followers, haue more then enough related the particu∣lars. Hesione, Sister to Priamus, was by Hercules giuen to Telamon for first entring the walles. Her did Priam demaund in vaine by Antenor, and Aeneas his ambassadours. Parts, otherwise called Alexander, one of the fiftie children of Priamus and Hecuba, was sent in the same businesse, and returned with Helena the wife of Menelaus a La∣cedemonian Prince: who consulting with the other Graecian Lords for her recouerie, first Diomedes and Vlisses were sent to intreat; after, a thousand saile of ships, to force her restitution: which after a tedious warre, with much losse on the one side, and vtter ruine on the other, was effected. The league of the Greekes was made by Calchas, who diuiding a bore in two parts, caused the Princes with their swords drawne and besprinkled with bloud to passe betweene, swearing destruction to Priamus and the Troians. The like rites of solemne Couenant wee reade obserued by God Gen.15.15. himselfe: and by the Ierem.34.1. Iewes. The religion of Phrygia and Troy, and all these Graecian parts of Asia were little, (if little) differing from the Greeke superstitions: of which in our Europe-discoueries we are to relate. Therefore adiourning a larger discourse till then, we are a little to mention here their deuotions. In Troy were the Temples of Iupiter Hercens, at whose Altar Pri∣am was slaine; of Iupiter Fulminator, of Iuno, Apollo, Minerua, Mercurie, Neptune; To Neptune they, which sailed, did sacrifice a blacke bull, and oxen, whose hinder parts were burnt, the inwards they tasted; Rams and Hogges were sacrificed also to him. To Mercurie clouen tongues hurled into the fire; To Venus, on the hill Ida; To Scamander, to the Nymphs, in Caues. To the dead also they sacrificed blacke sheepe, ouer a ditch or hole in the ground, with wine, water, & flower, thinking that the soules drank the bloud. They had whole flocks sacred to the Gods, vntouched by men. They obserued Auguries,
Thunders, dreames, Oracles of Apollo and other superstitions. But the most famous of all, their fatall Palladium, (a Name giuen to all images which superstition beleeued not made with hands) was said to haue fallen from heauen at Pessinus, or (as Apollodo∣rus witnesseth) at Ilium, at the prayer of Ilus when he built it. Some Nat Com:.4.c.5. say Asius a Phi∣losopher made it by Magicall Arte: that it moued vp and downe, holding in the right hand a iauelin; in the left, a Distaffe. It was three cubits long. Apollo's Ora∣cle fore-warned, that that Citie should neuer be taken, in whose walles it was kept. They hid it therefore in a more secret part of the Tower, that it should not bee publikely knowne, making many other like it to deceiue all suture deceiuers. A woman∣Priest attended the holy things in honour thereof, keeping fire continually burning. It was vnlawfull with common hands or eyes to touch or see it. And therefore when Ilus saued it from flames, the Temple being on fire, hee was for his blinde zeale punished with blindnes; of which, soone after be recouered by diuine indulgence: Ulisses stole it from them. And thus perished that famous Phrygian Citie, if that may be said to pe∣rish which still continueth, farre farre more famous by Homers pen, then Priams Scep∣ter or Hectors valour. The ruines thereof are as yet very apparant (according to Bellonius, P.Bel.l.2.c.6. an eye-witnes, his report) the wailes of the citie yet standing, the remnants of her decayed buildings still with a kinde of maiestie entertaining the beholder: the walles of large circuite, of great spongie blacke and hard stones, cut foure square. There are yet to be seene the rui∣nous monuments of the Turrets on the walls. They spent foure houres sometime on horse, and sometime on foote, in compassing the walles. Great Marble Tombes of an∣tient workmanship are seene without the wals made Chest-fashion: and their couers yet whole. There are also extant the ruinous shapes of two great Towers; one in the top of the hill, (On the bending vvhereof the towne stood) the other in the bottome: and of another in the middle. Many great Cisterns made to receiue raine-water are yet whole. There are the ruines also of Churches built there, by the sometimes inhabiting Christians. The soile about it is dry and barren: the rivers (so much chaunted) Xanthus and Simois are small rilles, in Summer quite drie. This Ilium (whose sepulchre onely Bellonius hath seene) is not in that place vvhere old Ilium stood, but thirty furlongs Eastward, if Strabo Lib.13. be receiued, yea it changed the place and situation often, and here at last abode by warning of the Oracle, vvhich also hath now had his Fates as well as Ilium. A small towne was this later Ilium, hauing in it the Temple of Pallas, which Alexander in his time graced, inriching the Temple with offerings, and the place with name of a Citie, with building and immunitie. After his victory ouer the Persians, he sent them a fauourable Epistle, with promise to build them a sumptuous Temple, and there to institute sacred games, which Lysimachus after his death in great part performed, peopling it from the neighbour Cities. The Romans al∣so planted there a Colony, when as Lysimachus afore had walled it, and built the Tem∣ple. Fimbria, in the warres against Mithridates, hauing treacherously slaine the Con∣sul Valerius Flaccus, and seeking to enter, vpon deniall assailed, it and in the eleuenth day entred by force; glorying that he had done as much in eleuen daies, as Agamemnon with a thousand saile of Greekes, had done in ten yeare; Not so much, replied an Ilian, for Hector was not here to defend the Citie. Caesar, aemulous of Alexanders attempts, and deriuing his pedegree from Iulus, confirmed their former liberty, adding a new re∣gion to their territory. Achilles among the later Ilians enioyed a Temple and a Toombe: Patroclus also and Antiochus had their Tombes: to them all and to Aiax did the Ilians sacrifice; an honour denied to Hercules for sacking their Citie: an vniust quarrell, if this yet may bee a iust excuse of their partiall superstition. Thymbra is a field hard by, through which slideth Thymbraeus, disemboking it selfe into Scamander there, where standeth the Temple of Thymbraean Apollo. Arrianus Lib.I. reporteth, that Alexander sacrificed to Protefilans, (erecting Al∣tars on his graue) vvho vvas the first of the Graecians that in the Troian warre set foote in Asia; as hee had before in the Straites of Hellespont offered a
Bull to Neptune and the Sea-Nimphes, powring a golden. Viall into the Sea: and in the places from vvhence hee set saile, and vvhere hee arriued, hee set vp Altars to Iupiter Descensor, to Pallas, and to Hercules. And being come to Ilion hee sacrificed to Troian Pallas, and fastening the armes, which hee vsed, in her Temple, (a rite which the Philistims I. Sam.31.10. obserued in Saul their enemie, and Dauid I. Sam.21.9. with the armour of Goliah) hee tooke thence the armour sacred to the Gooddesse; monu∣ments till that day of the Troian warre, afterward the weapons Argyraspide. of his gard. He Curt.l.2. ap∣peased also Priamus his Ghost, performing his exequies at the Altar of Iupiter Hercius, so to reconcile him to Neoptolemus his house. Of which hee, by his mother, descended. He crowned Achilles his Tombe: calling him O fortunate youngman whose virtue sound So braue a Trumpe thy noble acts to sound. Spenser Ruines of Time: happy, who had Homer to blaze abroad his praises to the world, in which he was greater, then Great Alexander. Not farre hence is the Citie and Hauen Priapus, so called of the beastly God: like to Orthanes and Conisalus and Tychon, drunken Gods of the Athenians. This God or di∣uell (of more iniquitie, then antiquitie) was not knowne of Hesiod. This Region was called, Adrastia Strab.l.13. of King Adrastus, who first built a temple of Nemesis calling is Adra∣stia. In the country adioining was an Oracle of Apollo Actaus, & Diana: whose oratory being demolished, the stones were carried to Parium, where was built an Altar, famous for fairenesse and greatnes. Of this Adrastia was a temple at Cyzicus. This Cyzicus was a Citie of Mysia minor; (for there is another Mysia called Maior, according to Ptolomeys Pto l.5.c.2. diuision:(the former is called Olympica, the later by Galen Gal desan.tu∣enda l.5. Ortel. Thesaur. , Hellespontica: there is another Mysia in Europe, which Volateran distinguisheth cal∣ling it Maesia. Some ascribe this Cyzicus to Bithynia. Wee list not to vmpire betwixt Geographers, but to relate our Historie, Appian in Mithridatico. Gramay. which telleth that this Citie was renowned for Antiquitie, giuen by Iupiter in Dowrie to Proserpina; whom therefore the inha∣bitants worship. The greatnesse, beauty, lawes, and other excellencies of Cyzicus let others shew you: their Temple I cannot but stay to view with wonder, Xiphilinus ex Dine apud Gram. Plin.l.36.c.15. whose pil∣lars are measured foure cubites thicke, fiftie high, each of one stone: in which, the whole building was of polished stone, and euery stone was ioined to his fellow with a thread Filum aure∣um. or line of golde: the image of Iupiter was of Iuory, crowned with a marble Apollo. Such was the beauty of the worke, and costlinesse of the matter, that the Earth whether with loue seeking to embrace it, or with iust hatred for the idolatrous curiositie, swallowed vp both it and the Citie in an Earthquake. The like befell to Philadelphia, another Mysian Citie (one of the seuen Churches Apoc.3.7. ro which Iohn writ:) and to Magnesia Pius 2. Asia. in the same Region. Neere to Cyzicus was the hill Dyndima: and thereon Cybeles Temple built by the Argonautes: who had also vsed a certaine stone for an anchor, vvhich they fixed sure at Cyzicus with Lead, because it had often plaid the sugitiue, Plin.l.36.c.15. called therefore the fugitiue Stone. The Cyzican towers yeelded a seuen fold Eccho. The Mysians for their great deuotion were called Smoke-climers, a fit name for all superstitious. They had in honour the Polianus.l.6.ap. Gra. Nymph Brythia: vnder colour of religion the Pa∣rians cousened the Lampsacens of a great part of their territory. Of this Citie was Pri∣apus aforesaid, a man monstrous in lusts, admirable in his plentifull issue; hated of the men (howsoeuer of the women beloued) and by them exiled to a wilde life in the field, till a greeuous disease, sent amongst them, caused them, by warning of the Do∣donaean Oracle to recall him; Fit seruitour for such a God. Hence the tale of his huge Genitalles, and of his Garden-deitie. Offering to rauish a Virgin at the time of her Wedding, hee was scared by the braying of an Asse, a creature for this cause consecrated to his sacrifices. Lettice most sutable to such lips. A little hence standeth Abydus; (and ouer against the same on Europe side, Se∣stus) chaunted by the Poets, the gard of the Hellespont, one of the keyes (saith Bel∣lonius) of the Turkish Empire; the Castles beeing for that purpose well furnished, the Straites not aboue seuen furlongs ouer. Here did Xerxes ioine Asia to Europe by a bridge, professing warres not against the Greekes alone, but against the ele∣ments. To Mount Athos Herodot.l.7. did this Mount Atheos write his menacing Letters. To the Hellespont he commanded three hundred stripes to be giuen, and fetters to be cast,
in with: reuiling speeches for the breach of his new made bridge, which the vvinde (disdaining the stopping of his passage, and infringing his libertie) had by tempest bro∣ken. In Mysia Strab.l.13. was that famous Pine-tree, foure and twenty foote in compasse, and growing intire threescore and ten foote from the roote, was diuided into three armes aequally distant, which after gathered themselues close into one top, two hundred foote high, and fifteene cubits. Apollo Cillaus had a Temple dedicated to him at Cilla; another was erected at Chrysa to Apollo Smynthius: and twenty furlongs thence, an other to Diana Astirina, another (with a sacred Caue) at Andira, to the mother of the Gods: this Caue reached vnder the Earth to Palea, a hundred and thirty furlongs. Attalus reigned in these parts, who furnished the Librarie of Pergamus Pergamus. with two hundred thousand Volumes, for the writing whereof those parchment-skinnes were inuented, therefore called to this day Pergamenae. Of this name Attalus were three of their Kings; the last of which made the Romanes his heires. Here was that cruell Edict of Mithridates published, to murther the Romanes, whereby many, dri∣uen to seeke helpe of Aesculapius in his Temple at Pergamus, found him either vn∣mercifull, or vnskilfull to cure them, although his Physicke-shop was in this Citie. Here were inuented (by King Attalus) Tapestrie hangings, called Aulaea of aula his hall which was hanged therewith. Here was also a yearely spectacle of the Cock-fight. The Mysian Priests abstained from flesh and Marriage. They sacrificed a Horse, whose inward parts were eaten before their vowes. Southwards from hence along the Sea-coast, trendeth Aeolis: whereunto adioi∣neth Lydia, called Ortel. Thes. aunciently Asia, and the inhabitans, Asiones. It was called Mae∣onia of Manes their first King, who begate Cotys, and he, Attys and Asius, of whome (some say) Asia taketh name. Cambletes Athex.l.10.c.1 Ex Xantho Lydo. a Lydian King was so addicted to gourman∣dise, that in the night hee did teare and eate his Wife, and finding her hand (in the morning) in his mouth, the thing being noised abroad, hee killed himselfe. The same Author telleth Lib.12.c.4. of King Andramytes, that hee made women Eunuches for his attendance: that the Lydians were so effeminate, that they might not endure the Sunne to looke vpon them, for which cause they had their shady bowers: that in a place, therefore called Impure, they forced women and Maidens to their lust, which Omphale (who had endured this violence, comming after to be their Queene) reuenged by as vniust iustice. For assembling all the seruants or slaues, shee shut vp among them their Masters Daughters, permitting them to their pleasures. She was Daugh∣ter of Iardanus of the posteritie of Attys, who set Hercules his taske to spin amongst her Maides. Her husband Tmolus defloured Arriphe in Dianas Temple. Of him hap∣ly was named the Hill Tmolus, which yeelded golden sands to the Riuer Pactolus. Halyattis Herodot.l.1. was after a long succession the Lydian King, father to Cresus, whose Sepulcher was an admirable monument, being at the bottome, stone; elsewhere, earth: built by men and women, slaues, and hired persons. It is sixe furlongs in com∣pesse, and two hundred foote, and a thousand and three hundred foote broad. All the Daughters of the Lydians prostitute themselues, and thereby get their liuing and dow∣rie. These were the first inuenters of coyning money: the first hucsters and pedlers: the first players at Dice, Balles, Chesse, in the time of Attys the first; driuen to this shift by famine, which when they knewe not otherwise to redresse, they deuised these games, passing the time of euery second day with these pastimes, then beguiling their emptie bellies, and (according to their ominous inuention) now not so much the companions, as the harbengers and forerunners of empti∣nesse, although some contrarie to their first originall vse them to ease their ful∣nesse. Thus did the Lydians liue (if Herodotus bee beleeued) two and twentie yeares, eating and playing by course, till they vvere faine to diminish their mul∣titudes by sending Colonies vnder Tyrrhenus vnto that part of Italy, Silius l.4. which of him receiued that name. Here on the winding streames of Meander (or nigh thereto) was situate Magne∣sia
(not that by Hermus) whose Inhabitants worshipped the Dindymene Mother of the Gods. But the olde Citie and Temple perishing, and a new builded, the Tem∣ple was named of Diana Leucophryna, exceeding that of Ephesus in workemanship, but exceeded in greatnesse and multitude of oblations. And yet this was the greatest in Asia except the Ephesian and Dindymene. Of Tralles a neighbouring Citie was Metrodorus the Priest of Iupiter Laryssaeus. In the way from thence Strabo lib. 14. to Nyssa, is a vil∣lage of the Nyssaens named Acharaca. There is the Plutonium (compassed with a groue) and the Temple of Pluto and Iuno, and the Caue Charonium, admirable to the view, ouerhanging the Groue, which it threatneth seeming to deuoure it. They say that sicke men which are deuoted to those Gods, goe thither, and in a street neere the Caue, stay with such as are expert in those mysteries, who sleeping for them, in∣quire the course to cure them, by dreames. These inuoking diuine remedies many times leade them into the Caue, where abiding many dayes with fastings and sweat∣ings, they sometimes intend to their owne dreames, by the Counsells of the Priests. To others this place is pestilent and inaccessible. Here are yearely festiualles solemni∣zed, and then most of all are these deuotions practised. Youths and striplings naked and annoynted, draw or leade a Bull into the same Caue with great speed, who falls anone dead. Thirty furlongs beyond Nyssa is a festiuall place solemnely frequented by the neighbouring Inhabitants, which is said to haue a Caue dedicated to the same Gods, and reaching to Acharaca. After Omphale, Hercules posterity, which he had by her, raigned; carrying for their royall Ensigne that Battle-axe, which Hercules had taken from Hippolita the Amazon. Candaules weary of the burthen, gaue it to one of his Courtiers to beare, interpreted an ominous presage of that which happened. He thinking it not enough happinesse to enioy the beauties of his wife, vnlesse some other eyes were witnesses of his posses∣sion, placed Gyges his friend where he might see vnseene (happily the occasion of that CicOff.3. tale of Gyges Ring, wherewith he went inuisible) to take view of his wiues naked∣nesse. But being perceiued by her at his departure, shee put him soone after to his choice, whether he would enioy what he had seene, and the kingdome for dowrie, without other ioynture then Candaules bloud, or would there himselfe be slaine. Ea∣sieto iudge his choice, by which Hercules his race failed. Of him descended Croesus, whose History is knowne. Him did Cyrus ouerthrow, Herodot.li.1. and had set him on a pile of wood to burne him, who then cried Solon, Solon, Solon: which Cyrus not vnderstan∣ding, caused him to be asked, why hee so called. Hee answered, That sometimes drunken with wealth and pleasure, he thought himselfe happy, but then was taught by Solon, not to iudge any happy till his end; which lesson he now learned to his cost: To his good indeed; For Cyrus for this pardoned his life, now the second time saued: which a little before a souldior in taking the City had bereaued, had not naturall affe∣ction in his sonne (before this time dumbe) violently inforced Nature to loosen the instruments, of speach and proclaime, It is the King. Thus had the Oracle prophe∣cied, that the day would be dismall and disastrous to the father, when the son should speake (whereto hee had before in vaine sought helpe of GOD and men) and could speake freely all his life after. And this was all that Croesus by his sumptuous Croesus had bin exceeding liberall to. A∣pollo, who de∣luded his Vo∣tarie with rid∣dles, as in our Persian relati∣on you may reade. presents, and superstitious deuotion could get of Apollo, which had foretold him, that he him∣selfe had no power to auert or alter, not to speake of his enigmaticall answers, snares, not instructions, nocuments, not documents vnto him.
CHAP. XVII. Of Ionia and other Countries in that Chersonesus. IOnia is situate on the Icarian Sea, ouer-against the Iland Chios. The Inhabitants are accounted Athenian Colonies (whereas Athens may rather seeme to be Ionian) deducing their name from Coelius Rhod. lib.7.10. Sard.lib.3. Ion the sonne of Creusa and Xuthus. But more probable is Ar.Montan. Fr. Iunius &c. their opinion which deriue them from Iavan, as is Lib.I.ca.8 before obserued by vs. Of the Ioni∣ans in Asia, were reckoned tenne principall Cities in the continent, Miletus, Myus, Priene, Ephesus, Colophon. Lebedus, Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea, Erythraea, besides Chios and Samos in the Ilands, to which they imparted their names. The Ionians had their common Sacrifices and Ceremonies at the Promontorie of Mycale, generally by all the Ionians dedicated to Neptune Heliconius, erecting there vnto him a Temple: the place was called Panionium, and the feast in which those sa∣crifices were offered, Panionia. To those twelue Cities Strabo Strabo lib.14. mentioning the foun∣ders of them, addeth also Smyrna, and saith that they were called to the Panionian solemnities by the Ephesians, who were sometime called Smyrnaeans of Smyrna the Amazon, who is named the Founder of Ephesus. Against those Smyrnaeans the Sar∣dians warred; and would on no condition raise their siege, except the Smyrnaean ma∣trons were permitted to their lusts. Gramay. The Maid-seruant of one Philarchus amongest them deuised, that those of her condition might in their Mistresses habite be sent, to saue their Maisters beds, which was accomplished. As for Ephesus, the place was designed by Oracle for the building thereof, which warned them there to build, where a Fish and a Bore should shew them. It hapned, that as certaine Fishermen at the sacred fountaine Hypeleus were broyling their fish, one of them leaped with the coales into an heape of strawe, which thereby was fired; and a Bore which lay couered therein, leaping out, ranne from thence as farre as Tra∣chea, and there fell downe dead of a wound which they gaue him, grunting out his last gasp where Pallas after was honored with a Temple. Greater then Pallas and her swinish deuotion was that Act.19.27,28 Great Diana of the Ephesians, (so proclaimed in the mad∣nesse of their zeale) and that Image which came downe from Iupiter, which all Asia and the world worshipped. This Image (as Plinse Pli.li.19.c.40. writeth) was thought by some to be of Ebonie, but Mutianus thrice consull, writ, That it was of the Vine, neuer changed in seuen alterations or restitutions, which the Temple receiued. It had ma∣ny holes filled with Spikenard, the moisture whereof might fill and close vp the rifts. The doores of the Temple were of Cypresse, Solinus c.49. which after foure hundred yeares were as fresh as if they had beene new. The roofe of the Temple was Cedar. The Image, which superstition supposed came from Iupiter, was made (saith the same Mutianus) by one Canetia. The Temple (reputed one of the worlds seuen wonders) was first the building of the Amazons, as Solinus affirmeth. Pausanias l. 7 But Pausaniask reproueth Pinda∣rus, for affirming that the Amazons had built it, when they made their Expedition against Theseus and the Athenians: For at that time (saith he) the women going from Thermodon, sacrificed to the Ephesian Diana in their way, as they had done before in the times of Hercules and of Bacchus. Not the Amazons therefore, but one Croesus of that Countrey, and Ephesus (supposed the sonne of the riuer Cayster) founded it. Of him the City also receiued her name. About the Temple dwelt both diuers other suppliants, and women of the Amazonian race. These were spared by Androclus the sonne of Codrus, who here planted his Athenian Colony, and chased out the Le∣leges, which before were the Inhabitants; who being slaine in this Expedition, his se∣pulchre remained in Pausanias his time, on which was set a man armed. Xerxes when he burned all other Temples in Asia, spared this, vncertaine whether for admiration or
deuotion; most certaine, a bootlesse clemencie. For Herostratus Euc.an.de morte peregrini. , to lengthen the memorie of his name with detestation of his wickednesse, fired this Temple on that day in which Alexander was borne at Pella. Diana forsooth, (who in her Midwife-Mysterie is called also Iuno Lucina) in her officious care to helpe Olympias in her tra∣uell, was then absent. It was after restored to a greater excellencie by Dinocrates, or (as Strabo tearmes him) Chermocrates, who was also the Architect of Alexandria. Some N Perot. Cornucopiae. Munst.Cosm.l.5 Plm.li. 16.ca.40 affirme, That two hundred and twentie yeares were spent, in building this Temple, by all Asia: Plinie sayth, foure hundred. It was built on a Marish, because of Earthquakes (which are said to be more common in Asia then other parts) being founded on Coles, the second foundation Woo'l. There were therein an hundred twentie seuen Pillars, the workes of so many Kings, threescore foot in height, and sixe and thirtie of them very curiously wrought. The Temple was foure hundred twentie fiue foot long, two hundred and twentie broad; of the Ephesians holden in such veneration, that when Croesus had begirt them with a streight siege, Herodot.lib.1 they de∣uoted their City to their Goddesse, tying the wall thereof with a rope to the Temple. It was enriched and adorned with gifts beyond value. It was full of the works of Pra∣xiteles and Thraso. The Priests were Eunuches Strabo lib.14 called Megalobyzi, greatly honoured, and had with them sacred Virgins. Some Gramay.Ionic. call these or else another order of Diana's Priests, Estia∣tores and Essenae, that is, Good fellowes (after the appellation of this bad Age) which by yearely courses had a peculiar diet assigned them, and came in no priuate house. All the Ionians resorted to Ephesus, Thucid.lib.3. at Diana's festiuall, which with daunces and o∣ther pompe they solemnized, with their wiues and children, as they had done before at Delos: The Temple had priuiledge of Sanctuarie, which Alexander extended to a furlong, Mithridates to a flight-shot, Antonius added part of the City: But Augustus disanulled the same, that it should no longer be a harbour for villaines. This the Ro∣mans finde (saith a Roman Pope relating this History) among whom are so many san∣ctuaries, as Cardinalls houses, in which theeues and ruffians haue patronage, which make the citie (otherwise quiet and noble) a denne of theeues. Pius secundut Asia, A lake named Selinusius, and another which floweth into it, were Diana's patrimony, which by some Kings be∣ing taken from her, were after by the Romans restored. And when the Publicans had seised the profits, Artemidorus was sent in Ambassage to Rome, where hee recouered them to Diana, for which cause they dedicated to him a golden Image in the Temple. In the middes of the lake was the Kings Chappell, accounted the worke of Agamem∣non. Alexander Arrian.lib. 1 not onely restored the Ephesians to their City, which for his sake they had lost, and changed the gouernement into a popular state, but bestowed also the tributes, which before they had payed to the Persians, vpon Diana, and caused them to be slaine which had robbed the Temple, and had ouerthrowne the Image of Philip his father therein, and such of them as had taken Sanctuary in the Temple hee caused to be fetched out and stoned. While he stayed at Ephesus, hee sacrificed to Diana with very solemne pompe, all his army being arranged in battell aray. The Ephesians were obseruers of curious Arts, which not only Luke mentioneth Acts 19.19 , but the prouerb also confirmeth Suidas. , Ephesiaeliterae: so they called the spelles, whereby they made themselues in wrestling, and other conflicts, inuincible. Memorable is the history of an Ephesian maide, Caelius lect∣antiq. li. 8.c.13. who, when Brennus inuaded Asia, promised him her loue, (which he much desired) and withall, to betray the city to him, if he would giue her all the Iewels and attire of the women: which the souldiers were commaunded to doe, who heaped their gold so fast vpon the Damosell, according to their commaund, that she was therewith couered and slaine. The Afiarchae, which Luke nameth Acts 19. Beza Beza annoat. saith were certaine Priests, whose office it was, to set forth publike playes and games in honour of their Gods; as also were the Syriarchae. The Ephesians, Athenaeus lib. 12.9 as all the other Ionians, were much addicted to nicenesse and sumptuousnesse of attire, for which, and other their delicacies, they grew into a prouerb. The Ionians had other places and temples amongst them famous for deuotion, and antiquitie, such as no where else are to be seene, as the Temple and Oracle of Apollo at
Gemini Pausan. A∣chaica.liv.7. Myus had a small arme of the Sea, whose waters by the meanes of Meander failing, the soile brought forth an innumerable multitude of fleas, which forced the Inhabitants to forsake their City, and with bagge and baggage to depart to Miletus. And in my time (saith Pausanias) nothing remained of Myus, in Myus, but Bacchus Temple. The like befell to the Atarmita neare to Pergamus. The Persians burnt the Temple of Pallas at Phocea, and an other of Iuno in Samos, the remaines whereof are worthy admiration: the Erythraean Temple of Hercules, and of Pallas at Prienae; that for the antiquitie, this for the Image. The Image of Hercules is said to be brought in a ship which came (without mans help) to the Cape, where the Chians & Erythrae∣ans laboured each to bring the same to their owne Citty. But one Phormio a Fisher∣man of Erythraea was warned in a dreams, to make a rope of the haire cut off from the heads of the Erythraean Matrons, by which their husbands should draw the same in∣to their towne. The women would not yeeld; but certaine Thracian women which had obtained their freedome, graunted their haire to this purpose, to whom therefore this priuiledge was graunted, to enter into Hercules Temple, a thing denied to all o∣ther the Dames of Erythraea. The rope still remaineth: and the Fisherman which be∣fore was blinde, recouered his sight. In this Towne also is Mineruaes Temple, and therein a huge Image of wood, sitting on a throne, holding with both hands a distasse. There are the Graces, and Houres, formed of white Marble. At Smyrna was the Tem∣ple of Aesculapius: and, nigh to the springs of their riuer Meles, a caue, in which they say Homer composed his Poems. Thus much Pausanias. The Ionian Scaliger in Euseb. chron. animad. letters were more resembling the Latine, then the present Greeke are, and were then common, as in our first Booke is shewed in our Phoenician relations. At Miletus, a madde phrensie had once possessed their Virgins, whereby it came to passe, that they in great multitudes hanged themselues. Neither cause appeared, nor remedy: Needs must they go whom the Deuill driues. Whom Polyaen.lib.3. stratagem. neither the sweetnes of life, bitternesse of death, teares, intreaties, offers, custodie of friends could moue, Modesty detained from proceeding in this immodest butchery: and which is more to be wondered at, a Posthume modesty, which could not be borne, till they were dead. For a Law was made, That the naked bodies of such as thus had strangled themselues, should be drawne through the streetes: which contumely, though it were but a Gnat to those Camels, which with the halter they swallowed, yet strained they at it, and it could it not be digested, but stayed their fury. Before the Troian war, was Hercules fa∣mous at Miletus. The Ionians were subiect to the Assyrians: after that to the Egypti∣ans: next to the Lydians, Persians, & the other Empires, which successiuely followed. From Ephesus to Colophon are seuenty furlongs. This town grew into a Prouerb; Colophonem addere Eras.Ad. for through their excellency in horsemanship they vsually made the victory (other∣wise doubtfull) to be certaine on that side which intertained them. Before Colophon was the groue of Apollo Clarius. And here died Calchas that famous wizard for griefe, that when vpon his demaund Mopsus had certainly answered how many pigges were in the belly of a Sow, by him propounded: Calchas could not doe the like, when Mop∣sus asked of the number of figges growing on a figge-tree thereby. Not farre from hence is Erythrae the towne of one of the Sybyls, which liued in the time of Alexander, of which name also there were others in other places and times, renowned for their prophecyings. Beyond Clazomenae is the Temple of Apollo, and Smyrna famous in those blind times, for the temple and statue of Homer, since for the Prelacie of Polycarpus, whom our LORD himselfe so highly commendeth. Apocal.2.9 Neleus builded Miletus (who also erected the Altar at Possidium) The Milesian Oracle was sacred to Apollo Didymaeus amongst the Branchidae, who betrayed the treasures of their God to Xerxes the burner of their temple; and therfore for feare of punishment follo∣wed him after in his flight. Afterwards the Milesians builded a Temple, which for the exceeding greatnes remained without roofe, compassed with dwelling-houses, and a groue, adorned sumptuously with gifts of ancient workmanship. Here was the legend framed of Branchus and Apollo, whom they called Vlios, and Artemis, of healing. Neare vnto the temple of Neptune at Possidium was Heraeum, an old Temple & Ora∣tory,
after conuerted into a storehouse, but then also retaining diuers chappels full of old workes, as was also a Court-yard without, from whence when Antonius had taken three colosses (the worke of Miro) standing on one basis, Augustus placed there again, Pallas and Hercules but translated Iupiter to the Capitoll, and built him a Chappell. Solmissus is not farre hence, where the Curetes or Priests of Iupiter dulled the eares of Iuno with the sound of weapons whiles Latona was deliuered. Here were many tem∣ples, some old, some new. The Dict, hist. Curetes or Corybantes, for so they were also termed, were a shauen order of Priests, who, rauished with a sacred fury, plaied vpon cimballs, and danced, shaking their heads to and fro, drawing others into the same rage of su∣perstition. These first beganne their deuotions at Ida, a hill of Phrygia, and after sai∣led into Creet, and here with their furious sounds they deliuered Iupiter from Saturnes: gullet (who had before couenanted with Titan to kill all his male children) while hee could not by meanes of their noyse heare Iupiters crying. Diodorus Siculus writeth, That Corybantus was the sonne of Iason and Cybele, and with Dardanus brought into Phrygia the rites of the mother of the gods, and called his disciples in that sect Cory∣bantes. Natalis Comes Nat. Co. libr. 9, cap.7. trauerseth many opinions about their originall and rites; their daunces were in armour. The region of the Dorians was almost rounded with the Sea: Heerin was Gnidus a Cittie of name for the marble Image of Venus: and Halycarnassus, the Countrey of Herodotus and Dionysius famous Historians, and of Mausolus, whose Sepulchre, ere∣cted by Artemifia his wife and sister, was accounted one of the worldes seuen won∣ders. In the Suburbs of Stomalymne was the Temple of Aesculapius of great reputation, and riches. In it was Antigonus of Apelles workemanship: there was also Venus na∣ked, after dedicated to Caesar at Rome, as the mother of that generation, by Augustus. Neare to Eargolia was a Temple of Diana. Mylasa another City of Caria had ma∣ny publique buildings and faire Temples; among the rest, two of Iupiter (surnamed Osogo) in the one; and in the other, Labrandenus, of Labranda a village, a little off, which had an auncient Temple of Iupiter Militaris much frequented. The way lead∣ing thither was called Sacred, paued sixtie furlongs, through which their Procession passed in pompous solemnity. The noblest of the citizens were ordained Priests, which function dured with their liues. There is a third Temple of Iupiter Carius common to all the Carians, of which also the Lydians and Mysians are partakers. Strabo reporteth Libr. 24. of two Temples at Strato∣nica; one at Lagina, sacred to Hecate, where were celebrated yeerely solemnities; the other neere the City of Iupiter Chrysaorcus common to all the Carians, whither they resort to sacrifice, and to consult of common affaires: which their assembly is called Chrysaorean. Lydia, called also Maeonia, was a rich Country, whose mother-Citie was Sardis, the royall seatof Croesus, washed by golden Pactolus, where idlenesse was a speciall fault, and punished by the Lawe. Fiue miles from this City is a lake called Colous, where is the temple of Diana Coloena very religiously accounted of, wherein, on their festiuals, Apes were reported to daunce. The region, called Burned, stretcheth it selfe heere a∣bout the space of fiue hundred furlongs, mountainous, stony and blacke, as if it were of some burning, wanting trees altogether (Vines excepted) which yeeld a very plea∣sant wine. Here was an other Plutonium at Hierapolis ouer-against Laodicea. It was a hole in the brow of a hill, so framed, that it might receiue the body of a man, of great depth. Below it was a squared trench of halfe an acre compasse so cloudie and darke, that the ground could scarcely be seene. The aire is not hurtfull to them which approach: but within it is deadly. Strabo Aelian. libr.4. Strabo lib.13 put in Sparrowes, which presently died. But the gelded Priests called Galli might approach to the mouthe and looke in, and diue in as long as they could hold their breath, without harme, but not without fignes of working passions, whether of diuine inspiration or reluctation of the naturall forces. No lesse maruellous then the dampe of the ayre, is the hardning quality of the waters; which being hote, doe harden themselues into a kinde of stone. As strange is that which is reported of the water of the lake Tatta, that if a rope be drawn tho∣row it, or a bird toucheth it with her wings they are ker∣ned with salt. Warner mentioneth
the like in Hungary, and Acosta, in Peru. Those Galli heere mentioned were Priests of Cybele, so called of Gallus a riuer in Phrygia, Wern.de aquis Hungariae. the waters whereof, temperatly drunken, did exceedingly temper the braine, and take away madnes; but being sucked in large∣ly, caused madnes. These Priests drinking hereof vnto madnesse, in that furie gelded themselues. And as their beginning, so was their proceeding also in madnesse, in the execution of their rites, shaking and wheeling their heads like madde men. Volate∣ran Volat. l.10. out of Polyhistor reporteth, that one Gallus the companion of Attys (both gel∣ded) imposed this name on the riuer, before called Teria. Of Cybele and Attys we haue spoken before: I adde, that after some, this Attys was a Phrygian youth, which when he would not listen to Rhea in her amorous suits, gelded himselfe; so consecrating his priesthood vnto Rhea or Cybele: others Nat. Com. libr.9.cap. 5. affirme that shee preferred him to that Of∣fice, first hauing vowed perpetuall chastitie, and breaking his Vow, was punished with madnesse, in which Macr. Sat.li. 1.cap. 21. calles him Attinis, and applieth this as the tale of Ve∣us and Adonis, to the Sunne & Earth in the Winter. Cybele is drawne with lions, which signifieth the influence of the heauens. Attinis they purtrayed with his rodde, the marke of his power, and a pipe, noting the Windes caused by the Sunne. Their mour∣ning ended on the eight Ca∣lends of A∣prill: the first day, in which the Sunne ma∣keth the day longer then the night, they solemnised the feast called Hilaria. See li.1.c. 7 de Phaen. he dismembred himselfe, and would also haue killed him∣selfe, but that by the compassionate Goddesse he was turned into a Pine-tree. That the Fable! this the History! that these gelded Priests wore also long womanish attire, plaied on tymbrelles and cornets, sacrificed to their Goddesse the ninth day of the Moone; at which time they set the Image of the Goddesse on an asse, and went about the villages and streets begging, with the sound of their sacred tymbrell, corne, bread, drinke, and all necessaries, in honour of their Goddesse: as they did also in the Tem∣ples, begging mony in her name, with some musicall instruments; and were therefore called Matragyrtae. Thus did the Priests of Corona also begge for the maintenance of their Goddesse, with promises of good fortune to their liberall contributors. Lucian in his Asinus relateth the like knaueries of the Priests of Dea Syria. But it is high time to leaue this (properly called) Asia, and to visite Lycia, washed by the Sea two hundred miles, wherein the mount Taurus ariseth, hence stretching it selfe Eastward, vnder diuers appellations, vnto the Indian Sea. They were gouerned by common Counsell of three and twenty Cities, till the Romans subdued them. Here was Cragus a hill with eight Promontories, & a Citie of the same name, from whence arose the Fables of Chymaera. At the foot of the hill stoode Pinara, wherein was wor∣shipped Pandarus: and a little thence the Temple of Latona; and not farre off, Patara, the worke of Patarus, beautified with a hauen, and many Temples and the Oracles of Apollo. The hil Telmessus was here famous for Soothsayings; and the Inhabitants are ac∣counted the first interpreters of Dreames. Here was Chimaera a hill said to burne in the night. Pamphylia beareth Eastwards from Lycia, & now together with Cilicia of the Turks is called Caramania. Herein was Perga, neare whereunto on a high place stood the temple of Diana Pergaea, where were obserued yerely Festiualls. Sida had also in it the temple of Pallas. There remaine of this Chersonessus, Dom. Niger. Armenia minor, and Cilicia. Armenia minor, called also Prima, is diuided from the Greater, or Turcomania by Eu∣phrates on the East: it hath on the West Cappadocia; on the South Cilicia, and part of Syria; on the North the Pontike nations. It was sometimes reckoned a part of Cap∣padocia, till the Armenians by their inuasions and colonies altered the name: As for their rites I finde litle difference, but they either resemble the Cappadocians, or their Armenian auncestors. Cilicia abutteth on the Easterne borders of Pamphilia, and was diuided into Tra∣chea, and Campestris; now hath in it few people, many great Mesquitaes, and well furnished: the chiefe Citie is Hamsa Strabo lib.14. sometime called Tarsus, famous for the studies of learning, heerein (saith Strabo) surmounting both Athens and Alexandria; but most most famous for yeelding him to the world, then whom the whole world hath not happily yeelded any more excellent that was meerely a man, that great Doctour of Nations, who filled these Countries and all Regions, from Ierusalem euen to Il∣lyricum (now full of barbarisme) by preaching, and still filleth the world by his wri∣tings, with that truth which he learned, not of man, nor at Tarsus the greatest Schoole of humanitie, nor at Ierusalem the most frequented for Diuinitie, but of the Spirit of truth himselfe: who both was at first from Heauen conuerted, and after in the third Heauen confirmed in the same.
Strabo mentioneth the Temple and Oracle of Diana Sarpedonia in Cilicia; where being inspired, they gaue answeres: The Temple of Iupiter also at Olbus, the worke of Aiax. From Anchiale, a Cilician Citie, Alexander passed to Solos, where he sa∣crificed with prayses to Aesculapius for recouerie from a strong Feuer, gotten before in the waters of Cidnus, and celebrated Gymnicall and Musicall Ar.lib. 2. Games. The Co∣rycian and Triphonian Dennes or Caues were held in much veneration among the Cilicians, where they sacrificed with certain Rites: They had their diuination by Birds and Gramay. Oracles. Vnto these things which haue beene said of the Temples, Priests, and Rites, obser∣ued in Asia, thus much may be added out of Sardus L.3.c.15. , of their Sacrifices. The Phry∣gians sacrificed Swines bloud. This did the Galli, Priests of Cybele, and this did the Bedlem Votaries, to recouer of their madnesse. The Colophonians offered a dogge to Enodia, which is Hecate, as did also the Carians to Mars. The Phaselites in Pam∣philia sacrificed fishes to Caber, the sonne of Vulcan; and the Lydians, Eeles to Nep∣tune. The Cappadocian Kings in their Sacrifices to Iupiter Stratioticus, or Militaris, on a high Hill, built a great fire, the King and others bringing wood thereto: and af∣ter that another lesser, which the King sprinkled with Milke and Honey, and after fired it, entertaining those which were present with good cheere. Peucer Peucerus de Divinatione. tells of diuinations vsed in some parts of Lycia: betwixt Myra and Phellus there was a fountaine full of fishes, by whose forme, nature, motion, and feeding the inhabitants vsed diuination. The same Lycians, in the groue of Apollo, not farre from the Sea, had a drie ditch, called Dina, in which the Diuiner put in fishes, and tenne gob∣bets of rosted flesh, fastened on spits, with certaine prayers: after which, the drie ditch became full of water and fishes of all kindes and formes, by which the Priests obserued their Praedictions. And not farre from hence, at Myrae in Lycia, was the fountaine of Apollo Curius, where the fishes being three times called with a Pipe, assembled them∣selues, and if they deuoured the meats giuen them, it was interpreted a good bode and happie presage: if they strucke away the same with their tailes, it was direfull and dreadfull. At Hierapolis in Lycia, the fishes in the Lake of Venus being called by the Temple-keepers, presented themselues, enduring to be scratched, gilled, and mens hands to be put in their mouths. They diuined by lots sixe moneths of the yeare toge∣ther, at Patara in Lycia, in Apollo's Temple. But Saturne hath swallowed his owne children; and Time, which brought forth these, both Gods and Religions, hath also consumed them, not leauing any such memoriall of them as might satisfie any curious searcher: yet in relation of the Greekish Rites (from which these, for the most part, haue not much swarued) you may expect a more full and ample Discourse. It is now time at last to rest our wearie limbes: enough and more hath the Pilgrim told you of the Arabian Deserts, of the Monster Mahomet, and his Vicars the Calipha's Calipha signfi∣eth Vicar. Scal. (euen in this title they will paralell Rome) of their Rapines answerable to their Sarak, Thee∣vish.Scasiger. Brightman de∣nies that deri∣vation, appro∣veth, I thinke, a worse, of Sara. name: of their Viperous off-spring the Turkes, and of the elder inhabitants of that Asian Tract. Let me here a little breath me, before I ascend the Ar∣menian Hils.
OF THE ARMENIANS, MEDES, PERSIANS, PAR∣THIANS, SCYTHIANS, TARTA∣RIANS, CHINOIS, AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS. THE FOVRTH BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of ARMENIA MAIOR, and GEORGIA: and the neighbouring Nations. HItherto wee haue proceeded slowly in the discouerie of a part of Asia; sometime the store, sometimes the want, of conuenient matter, detaining our penne: In the one, Time, the consumer of things, causing much time and paines to be spent in curi∣ous search, that we might produce some light out of darknesse: In the other, store of Stories, and va∣rietie of varying Authors hath dimmed our weaker eyes with too much light, vncertaine, in so many Tracts and Tractats, where to begin, and when to end. Now at last are wee passed Euphrates, into a Countrey that often exalteth it selfe, as though it would pierce the Skies, and as often receiueth the due punishment of ambitious pride, being cast downe into so many lowly valleyes and deiected bottomes. The World, which after the Floud was repeopled from hence, still carrieth in the seuerall Ages, Pla∣ces. Peoples, and Men thereof, the resemblance of this her Cradle, now vp, now down, in all varietie and vicissitude of chaunce and change, constant in vnconstancie, trea∣ding this Armenian Measure with vnequall paces, ouer Hils and Dales, like it selfe onely in vnlikenesse. Here Noes Arke setled, and here must our Shippe hoyse sayle. Armenia hath a part of Cappadocia & Euphrates on the West; Mesopotamia on the South; on the North part, Colchis, Iberia, Albania; on the East, the Caspian Sea, and Media. Part of this greater Armenia is now called Turcomania, the other part is con∣tained in Georgia. Ptolomey Ptol.l.5.c.13. reckoneth in it principall Mountaines, the Moschici, Paryarges, or Patiedri, Vdacespes, Antitaurus, Abos, and the Iun.in Annos. Gen.8. Gordaei, which the Chaldaean Paraphrast calleth Kardu, and Q. Curtius, Cordaei; Berosus, Cordyaei.
On these Hils the Arke rested, whereof we haue spoken in the first booke. Haithonus, or Antonius. Armenius. Hai∣thon (if we beleeue him of his owne Countrey, where he was of royall linage) cal∣leth this Mountaine Arath, little differing from the Scripture-appellation Ararat, and addeth, That although, in regard of abundance of Snow, alway possessing the toppe thereof, none be able to goe vp thither, yet there alway appeareth in the toppe a cer∣taine blacke thing, which the vulgar people esteeme to be the Arke. Armenia (as Strabo Lib. 11. affirmeth) receiued the name of one of Iasons Compa∣nions, which followed him in his Nauigation out of Harmenia, a Citie of Thessa∣lie, betweene Pherae and Larissa. The wealth of this Region appeared, when Ptolo∣mey appointed Tigranes to bring in to the Romanes sixe thousand Talents of Siluer, he added voluntarily, beyond that summe, to euery souldior in the Campe fiftie drammes of Siluer, to euery Centurion a thousand, to euery Deputie of a Countrey, and Chiliarche, a Talent. Their Religion must at first be that which Noah and his Familie professed; after by time corrupted. Here ( Pseudo Bero∣sus, lib.3. sayth our Berosus) Noah instructed his posteritie in di∣uine and humane Sciences, and committed many naturall secrets vnto writing, which the Scythian Armenians commend to their Priests onely; none else being suffered to see, or reade, or teach them. He left also Rituall Bookes, or Ceremoniall, of the which he was tearmed Saga, i. Priest, or Bishop. He taught them also Astronomie, and the distinction of yeares and moneths: For which, they esteemed him partaker of diuine Nature, and surnamed him Olybama and Arsa, that is, the Heauen and the Sunne, and dedicated to him many Cities; some (sayth he) remaining at this day, which beare these names. And when he went from thence to gouerne Cytim, which now (as he affirmeth) they call Italie, the Armenians were much affected to him, and after his death accounted him the Soule of the heauenly bodies, and bestowed on him diuine honours. Thus Armenia, where he began, and Italie, where he ended, doe worship him, and ascribe to him Names, Heauen, Sunne, Chaos, the Seede of the World, the Father of the greater and lesse Gods, the Soule of the World, mouing Heauen, and the Crea∣tures, and Man; the God of Peace, Iustice, Holinesse, putting away hurtfull things, and preseruing good. And for this cause both Nations signifie him in their writings with the course of the Sunne, and motion of the Moone, and a Scepter of Domini∣on, persecuting and chasing away the wicked from among the societie of men, and with the chastitie of the bodie, and sanctimonie of the minde, the two keyes of Re∣ligion and Happinesse. They called also The wife of Noah. Tidea, the mother of all, after her death, Aretia, that is, the Earth, and Esta, i. the Fire, because she had beene Queene of the Holy Rites, and had taught maidens to keepe the holy euerlasting fire from euer go∣ing out. Noah, before he went out of Armenia, had taught men Husbandrie, more ai∣ming at Religion and Manners then Wealth and Dainties, which prouoke to vnlaw∣full things, and had lately procured the wrath of GOD. And first of all men hee found out and planted Vines, and was therefore called Ianus, which to the Aramae∣ans soundeth as much as the author of Wine. Thus farre Berosus, lib. 3. and in the fourth booke he addeth, That Nymbrot (the first Saturne of Babylon) with his sonne Iupiter Belus, stole away those Rituall or Ceremoniall bookes of Iupiter Sagus, and came with his people into the Land Sennaar, where he appointed a Citie, and layed the foundation of a great Tower a hundred one and thirtie yeares after the Floud; but neither finished this, nor founded the other. Olde Ianus when he went hence, left Scytha, with his mother Araxa, and some inhabitants, to people Armenia, being the first King thereof; Sabatius Saga being consecrated High Priest, from Armenia vnto the Bactrians: all which space (sayth hee) in our Age is called Scythia Saga. In his fifth booke hee reporteth, That Iupiter Belus, possessed with ambition of subduing the whole World, closely endeauoured to make (or take) away Sabatius Saga, who, being not able otherwise to escape his trecherie, sledde away secretly. But Ninus, the sonne of Belus, pursuing his fathers intent
against Sabatius who substituted his sonne Barzanes in his place, and fled into Sar∣matia, and after from thence into Italie, to his father Ianus. Barzanes was subdued by Ninus. But to come to an Author of better credit, Strab. l. 11. Strabo sayth, The Armeni∣ans and Medes haue in veneration all the Temples of the Persians, but the Armenians especially esteeme the Temples of Tanais an Armenion Goddesse. Some tearme her Anaitts. Tanais as erecting them in other places, so in Acilesina. They dedicate vnto them men-seruants and women-seruants: the most noble of that Nation there (dedicating shall I say? or) prostituting their daughters: where after long prostitution with their Goddesse, they are giuen in marriage; none resusing such matches. How much can the shadow, how little can the substance of Religion persuade men to? The Image of Tanais, or Anaitis, was set vp in her Temple, all of solide Gold; and when as Antonius warred against the Parthians, this Temple was robbed. The fame Coel.Rbdig. l. 18. c.29. went, That he which first had layed sacrilegious hands on the spoyles, was smitten blinde, and so diseased, that he died thereof. But when Augustus, being entertained of an auncient warrior at Bononia, asked him of the truth of this report, he answered, Thou now, O Emperour, drinkest that bloud; for I am the man, and whatsoeuer I haue, came by that bootie. This Goddesse is sup∣posed to be the same with Diana. A Region of Armenia bare the same name, A∣naitis. How bloudie Rites the Armenians sometimes vsed, appeareth Gramaye Armen. by the Historie of the Riuer Araxes, before called Halmus, borrowing this later name of a King there raigning; to whome, in warres betwixt him and the Persians, the Oracle prescribed the sacrifice of his two faire daughters. Pietie forbad what pietie commaunded; and whiles the King would be an Vmpire betweene Nature and the Oracle (which is the vsuall euent in arbitrements) he satisfied neither. That the Oracle might be fulfilled, he sacrificed two of noble birth, of notable beautie: That Nature might not be wron∣ged, he wronged Iustice (the true touch-stone of true pietie) he spared his owne, and offered the daughters of Miesalcus but so he lost both his daughters by Miesalcus reuenging sword, and himselfe in this Riuer by himselfe drowned. Bacchus loued Al∣phoesibaea, an Armenian Damsell, and while Tygris, then (if you beleeue the Storie) called Sollax, was too coole a mediator betweene the two hot louers, he swamme o∣uer on a Tygers backe. Hence the fable of his Metamorphosis into a Tygre: hence that name left to the Riuer. Armenia was subdued to the Persians by Cyrus: One part thereof payed to the Persians twentie thousand Colts for yearely tribute. Valer. Max: l.9. c.11. Sariaster, sonne to Tigranes the Armenian King, conspired against his father: the conspirators sealed their bloudie faith with a bloudie ceremonie; they let themselues bloud in the right hands, and then dranke it. Wonder, that in such a trecherie (as immediately be∣fore the same Author affirmeth of Muhridates his sonne) that any man would helpe, or that he durst importune the Gods: no wonder, that so bloudie a seale was annexed to such euidence. The Temple of Baris (mentioned by Strabo) may happily be some Monument of Noahs descent, by corruption of the word Lubar as before said, Antiq.lib. . cap.5. Iosephus out of Nicolaus Damascenus calling it Baris with losse of the first syllable. Iuvenal accuseth the Armenians of Sooth-saying, and Fortune-telling, by viewing the inwards of Pigeons, Whelpes, and Children. His words are in Sat. 6. Spondet amatorem tenerum vel divitis orbi Testamentum ingens, calidae pulmone columbae Tractato, Armenius vel Commagenus Aruspex Pector a pulmonum rimabitur, exta catelli Interdum & pueri: That is, A tender Louer, or rich Legacie, Of child-lesse Rich man, for your destinie, Th'Armenian Wizard in hot Lungs doth spie Of Pigeons: Or of Whelpes the inwards handling, Or sometimes (bloudie search) of children, mangling.
The Mountaines Pins 2. of Armenia pay tribute vnto many Seas: Phasis and Lycus vnto the Pontike Sea; Cyrus and Araxes vnto the Caspian; Euphrates and Tigris vnto the Red or Persian Sea: These two last are famous for their yearely ouerflowings, the former of them arising amidst three other Seas, yet by the incroaching violence of the beetle-browed Hils enforced to a farre longer, more intricate, and tedious way, before he can repose his wearied waues: the other, for his swiftnesse, bearing the name of Tygris, which with the Medes signifieth an Arrow. Solinus, cap. 40. sayth, That it passeth through the Lake Arethusa, neither mingling waters nor fishes, quite of another colour from the Lake: It diueth vnder Taurus, and bringeth with it much drosse on the other side of the Mountaine, and is againe hidden, and againe restored, and at last carrieth Euphrates into the Sea. The Armenians, besides their naturall Lords, haue beene subiect to the Persians; after that, to the Macedonians, and againe to the Persian; after, to Antiochus Captaines: then, to the Romanes and Parthi∣ans, tossed betwixt the Grecians and Saracens, subdued after successiuely to the Tar∣tarians, Persians, and Turkes. Of these present Armenians M. Cartwright reporteth, Preachers Trauels. That they are a people very industrious in all kinde of labour: their women very skil∣full and actiue in shooting and managing any sort of weapon, like the antient Ama∣zons. Their families are great, the father and all his posteritie dwelling together vnder one Roofe, hauing their substance in common: and when the father dieth, the eldest sonne doth gouerne the rest; all submitting themselues vnder his Regiment: after his death, not his sonne, but the next brother succeedeth, and so after all the brethren are dead, to the eldest sonne. In diet and clothing they are all alike. Of their two Patri∣arkes, and their Christian profession, we are to speake in fitter place. The Turcomanians (later inhabitants) are as other the Scythians or Tartarians, (from whence they are deriued) theeuish, wandering vp and downe in Tents without certaine habitations, like as the Curdi also their Southerly neighbours, their cattell and their robberies being their greatest wealth. Of their Religion (except of such as after their manner be Christians, which we must deferre till a fitter time) we can finde little to say, more then is said alreadie in our Turkish Historie. This we may here deplore of the vnhappie site of Armenia, which though it repeopled the world, yet is it least be∣holding to her viperous off-spring, a mappe of the worlds miseries, through so many ages. For being hemmed alway with mightie neighbors on both sides, it selfe is made the bloudie Lists of their ambitious encounters, alway loosing whosoeuer wonne, al∣way the gauntlet of the Chalenger, the Crowne of the Conqueror. This (to let passe elder times) the Romanes and Parthians, Greeke Emperors and Saracens, Turkes and Tartarians, Turkes and Mamalukes, Turkes and Persians, do more then enough proue. Ptolomey placeth to the North of Armenia, Colchis, washed by the Pontike Sea; Alba∣nia by the Caspian; and betwixt these two Iberia, now (together with some part of Armenia) called Georgia, either for the honour of their Patron S. George, or haply be∣cause they descended of those Georgi, which Plinie Lib.6. c. 13. nameth among the Caspian in∣habitants. Strabo Strab.l.11. recordeth foure kindes of people in this Iberia: of the first sort are chosen two Kings, the one precedent in age and nobilitie, the other a leader in Warre, and Law-giuer in Peace: The second sort, are the Priests: The third, Husbandmen and Souldiors: The fourth, the vulgar seruile people. These haue all things common by Families, but he is Ruler which is eldest; a thing obserued of the Armenian Christians (as before is said) euen at this day. Constantinus Porphyrogenitus Const.de ad∣ministrando im∣perio ad Roma∣num F. c 45. the Emperour wri∣teth, That the Iberians boast and glorie of their descent from the wife of Vriah, which Dauid defiled, and of the children gotten betweene them. Thus would they seeme to be of kinne to Dauid and the Virgin Marie: and for that cause they marrie in their owne kindred. They came (they say) from Ierusalem, being warned by Vision to depart thence, and seated themselues in these parts. There departed from Ierusalem Dauid and his brother Spandiates, who obtained (say they) such a fauour from GOD, that no member of his could be wounded in warre, except his heart, which he there∣fore diligently armed; whereby he became dreadfull to the Persians, whome he sub∣dued, and placed the Iberians in these their habitations. In the time of Heraclius
they aided him against the Persians, which after that became an easie prey to the Sara∣cens. Of the Roman conquests and exploits Dion Cassus lib. 37. & 49. Agathias lib.4. ornandes de reb. Get. in Armenia, Colchis, Iberia, Albania, I list not heare to relate. Albania Ruterus. Caelius Rodigmus lect. Antiquarum. lib. 18. cap. 27. Pius secundus, Asia. (now Zuiria) lieth North and East betwixt Iberia and the sea, of which Strabo affirmeth that they need not the sea, who make no better vse of the land: for they bestow not the least labour in husbandry, and yet the Earth voluntarily and libe∣rally yeeldeth her store: and where it is once sowen, it may twice or thrice be reaped. The men were so simple, that they neither had vse of money, nor did they nūber aboue an hundred; ignorant of weights, measures, warre, ciuility, husbandrie: there were in vse amongst them sixe and twentie languages. They had Sansouinus and Pius Secun∣dus, report of such Spiders in Italy, in Cala∣bria, called Tarantulae Spiders which would pro∣cure death vnto men smiling, and some also which did men to die weeping. They worshipped the Sunne, Iupiter, and the Moone, whose Temple was neere to Iberia. The Priest, which ruled it, was next in honor to the King: hee performeth the holy rites, ruleth the Holy Region which is large and full of people: of the sacred ser∣uants, many, being inspired, doe diuine or prophecie. He which is most rauished with the spirit, wandereth alone thorow the woods: him the Priest taketh, and bindeth with a sacred chaine, allowing him sumptuous nourishment the space of a yeare, and after bringeth him to be slaine with other sacrifices to the Goddesse. The rites are thus. One which is skilfull of this businesse, holding that sacred speare where with they vse to slay the man, stepping forth, thrusteth it into his heart: in his falling they obserue certaine tokens of diuination: then doe they bring out the bodie into some place, where they all goe ouer it. The Albanians honored old-age in all men, death in none, accounting it vnlawfull to mention a dead man; with whom they also buried his wealth. Plin.li 7. c.2. Pliny out of Isigonus affirmeth, that a people called Albani (not these I thinke, if any) were hoary haired from their childhood, and saw as well by night as by day. Mengrelia (sometime Colchis) adioyneth to the Euxine sea, in which country Stra∣bo mentioneth the Temple of Leucothea, builded by Phryxus: where was also an Ora∣cle, and where a Ramme night not be slaine. This Temple was sometimes very rich, but spoiled by Pharnax, and after of Mithridates. This countrie the Poets haue made famous by the fables of Phryxus, and Iason. Phrixus the sonne of Athamas Prince of Thebes, and of Nephele, with his sister Helle fled from their cruell stepdam Ino, vpon the backe of a golden Ramme, from which Helle falling into the water gaue name thereto, of her called Hellespont: Phrixus comming safe into Colchis, sacrificed to Iupiter, and hanged vp the fleece of his Ramme in the groue of Mars. which custome was yearely practised of his posteritie. Iason after by command of Pelias (seeking by a barbarous enemie, or a dangerous nauigation to destroy him) with fourescore and nineteene other companions in the ship, called Argo, fetched this fleece from hence by the helpe of Medea: and the ship and the Ramme filled heauen with new constel∣lations. That fable Diod. Sic.li.4. Nat.Com.lib.6. lussin.l.b.42. Strabo lib.11. had ground of historie, howsoeuer by fictions obscured. For the riuers heere in Colchis are reported to carrie gold downe with their streames and sands, which the people take with boords bored full of holes, and with fleeces of wooll. Spaine hath of late yeelded many such Argonauts, with longer voiages, seeking the golden Indian Fleece, which their Indian conquest may make the ensigne of their Order more fitly, then their Burgundian inheritance. Herodotus Lib. 2. is of opinion that Sesostris left some of his armie heere at the riuer Pha∣sis, perswaded hereunto by the agreement of the Colchians and Egyptians in the same ceremonie of Circumcision, and in the like workes of hempe, Vadianus citeth out of Valerius Flaccus the like testimony. Pliny in his sixth booke, and fifth chapter, repor∣teth of Dioscurias a Citie of Colchis, whilome so famous, that Timosthenes affirmeth that three hundred nations of differing languages liued in it, and afterwards the Ro∣man affaires were there managed by an hundred & thirtie Interpreters, Annal.lib. 6. Cornelius Ta∣citus saith that they accounted it vnlawfull to offer a Ramme in sacrifice, because of Phryus his Ramme, vncertaine, whether it were a beast, or the ensigne of his shippe. They report themselues the issue of the Thessalonians. The present Mengrelians are rude and barbarous, defending themselues from the
Turkes by their rough Hills and ragged pouertie: so inhumane that they sell their owne children to the Turkes. I reade not of any other religion at this day amongst them but Christian, such as it is. Some adde these also to the Georgians. Quadus. The wiues of diuers of these people reported to be exercised in armes and martiall feates, happily gaue occasion to that fable or historie of the Amazons. Busbequius Aug. Busbcq. epist.3. saith, that Colchos is a very fertile countrey, but the people idle and carelesse: they plant their Vines at the foote of great Trees, which marriage pro∣ueth very fruitfull, the husbands armes being kindly embraced, and plentifully laden. They haue no money, but in stead of buying and selling they vse exchange. If they haue any of the more precious mettals, they are cōsecrated to the vse of their Temples, whence the King can borrow them vnder pretence of publike good. The King hath all his tributes paid in the fruits of the earth, whereby his Pallace becommeth a pub∣like store-house to all commers. When Merchants come, they giue him a present, and he feasteth them: the more wine any man drinketh, the more welcome he is. They are much giuen to belly-cheere, dauncing, and loose sonnets of loue and daliance. They much caroll the name of Rowland or Orlando, which name it seemeth passed to them with the Christian armies which conquered the holy Land. No maruell if Ceres and Bacchus lead in Venus betwixt them, which so ruleth in these parts, that the husband bringing home a guest, commends him to his wife and sister, with charge to yeeld him content and delight, esteeming it a credit that their wiues can please and be accepta∣ble. Their Virgins become Mothers very soone; most of them at ten yeares old can bring witnesses in their armes (little bigger then a great frogge, which yet after grow tall and square men) to proue that there is neuer a maid the lesse for them. Swearing they hold an excellent qualitie, and to be a fashion-monger in oathes, glorious: to steale cunningly winnes great reputation, as of another Mercury; and they which can∣not doe it, are holden dullards and blockes. When they goe into a Church, they giue meane respect to the other Images: Saint George is so worshipped, that his horses hoofes are kissed of them. Dadianus the King of Colchos or Mingrelia, came a suiter to Solyman. while Busbequius was there. Betwixt them and the Iberians, their neighbors, is much discord. And thus much of their present condition. Haithon Haiton.cap.7. the Armenian, extending the confines of Georgia to the great sea, saith: In this kingdome is a thing monstrous and wonderfull, which I would not haue spo∣ken nor beleeued, had I not seene it with mine owne eyes. In these parts there is a Pro∣uince called Hamsem, containing in circuit three dayes iourney, and so farre is it co∣uered with an obscure darkenesse, that none can see any thing, nor dare any enter into it. The inhabitants thereabouts affirme, that they haue often heard the voice of men howling, cockes crowing, neighing of horses; and by the passage of a riuer, it appea∣reth to haue signes of habitation. This is reported by the Armenian histories to haue come to passe by the hand of GOD, so deliuering his Christian seruants (by Sauoreus a Persian Idolater, Lord of this place appointed to die) and so punishing with outward darkenesse the inward former blindnesse and rage of those persecuting Idolaters. Thus Haithonus or Antonius á Churchi (for so Ortelius nameth him) but this darknesse see∣meth more ancient, and to haue beene the cause of that prouerbe Tull. in Aca∣dein cimmerij qbus aspectum susiue Deus a∣lquis siue Na∣tura ademit fiue eius quem inco∣lunt loci situs. Cimmeriaete∣nibrae. The Georgians (girt in with two mightie aduersaries, the Persian, and the Turke) haue endured much grieuance from them both: and, in the late warres, especially from the Turke, Io Bol.Ben. who hath taken and fortified many of their principall places of impor∣tance, Gori, Clisca, Lori, Tomanis, Teflis, the chiefe citie of Georgia, vnto which from Derbent there yet remaine the foundation of a high and thicke wall built by A∣lexander. Ortelius esteemeth Derbent to bee Cancasiae portae, which Pliny Plin.l.6.c.11. calleth a mightie worke of nature, &c. Westward from hence is entrance into the Circassian countrey, extending it selfe on Meotis fiue hundred miles, and within land two hun∣dred. Christians they are in profession: from hence the Soldans of Egypt had their slaues, of which were raised their Mamalukes. Their chiefe Cities are Locoppa and Cromuco: at the mouth of Tanais, the Turke hath fortified Asaph. They liue in great
part on robberies. In old time in this tract was Phanagoria, and therein the Temple of Venus surnamed Apaturia, Strabo lib. 11. because, that when the Giants assaulted her, she implored the aide of Hercules, who slew them all one after another. Cimmerium a towne at these straits, gaue name thereunto of Cimmerius Bosphorus. But little can be said of these in particular, more then generally may be said of the Scythians, to whom they are reckoned. Georgius Interianus Apud Rhamus. hath written a tractate of these Zychi, or Circassi, called of themselues Adiga; expressing their vnchristian christianitie, and barbarous manner of liuing; which I hold fittest in our discouery of the diuers professions of Christian Re∣ligion to relate. Some G. Bot.Ben.Abr.Hart. M. Paul. Ramus. adde vnto Armenia in their moderne Mappes and Discoueries, besides the Turcomani, a people that came thither out of Tartaria, the Curdi, both still retaining the Tartarian and Arabian manner of life in tents without Cities, Townes, or houses. Their religion halteth betwixt diuers religions of the Turkes, Persians, and Christians of the Iacobite and Nestorian Sects. In heart, they are neither fast to GOD nor man; dissembling with the Persian and Turke, whose subiects they haue successiuely beene, and better skilled in robbery, murther, and faithlesse treacherie (their daily practise) then mysteries of faith and religion. They are also Lords of Bitlis, and some other Ci∣ties and holds in those parts. They are supposed to be a remnant of the ancient Parthi∣ans, and neuer goe abroad without their armes, bowes, arrowes, scimitars, and buck∣lers, euen when Age seemeth to haue fastened one foot in the graue. They adore Cartwrights Trauels. and worship the Diuell, that he may not hurt them, nor their cattell: they are cruell to all sorts of Christians: their countrie is therefore called Terra Diaboli. One of their Townes is named Manuscute, a mile from which is an Hospitall dedicated to Saint Iohn Baptist, much frequented as well by Turkes, as Christians, whom superstition hath perswaded, that whosoeuer will bestow, kidde, sheepe, or money, to releeue the poore of that place, shall both prosper in his iourney, and obtaine the forgiuenesse of his sinnes. CHAP. II. Of the Medes. ARmenia extending it selfe (if Iustine Lib.42. haue measured rightly) eleuen hundred miles, on the East encountreth Media, in which lieth our next perambulation. It receiued the name of Madai, the sonne of Ia∣phet, not of Medus the sonne of Medea and Iason. It is limited Strabo lib.11. on the North, with the Caspian sea; on the South, with Persia; on the East, with Parthia. Ecbatana, the chiefe Citie built (as Pliny Plin.l.6.c.14. affir∣meth) by Seleucus (indeed farre more ancient, and by him happily reedified) is distant from the Caspian Straits twentie miles. These Straits are a narrow way made by hand thorow the hilles, scarce wide enough for a cart to passe, eight miles in length, the rockes manifesting their indignation at this interruption, by obscure frownes, and salt Sol.cap.50. teares continually streaming from them, which I know not by what sudden hor∣ror, are presently congealed into ice; also all the Summer time with armies of Serpents keeping the passages. Well may this be the house of Enuy: so fitly doth that fable of the Poet Ouid. Meta∣mor.lib.2. agree with the nature of this place. —Domus est imis on vallibus huius, Abdita, sole carens, non vlli pernia vento, Tristis, & ignaui plenissima frigoris, & quae Igne vacet semper, caligine semper abundet. —videt intus edentem Vipereas carnes, vitiorum alimenta suorum, INVIDIAM.—
Of Ecbatana we reade in the Historie of lud.1. Iudith that Arpachshad built the walles of hewen stones, seuenty cubits high, and fiftie cubits broad, &c. Herodotus Lib.1. affirmeth, that after the Assyrians had raigned in Asia fiue hundred and twentie yeares, the Medes rebelled, and chose Deioces to be their King, and at his command builded him this roi∣all Citie, and a Pallace of great beautie (the timber whereof was Cedar, ioyned with plates of siluer and gold; it was seuen furlongs in compasse) his successours are there reckoned, Phraortes, Cyoxares, Astiages, Iustine Iuslin.lib.1. reporteth that Arbactus or Arbaces, Liefetenant of the Medes vnder Sardanapalus, rebelled against him for his effeminate life, and translated the Empire from the Assyrians, with whom it had continued thir∣teene hundred yeares, to the Medes. Diodorus Siculus Diodorus Sic. lib.3.cap.7. Melan.Chro.l.2. addeth in this conspiracie, vn∣to this Arbaces the Mede, Belesus, whom some call Phul Beloch the Babylonian, who shared the State betwixt them; the Babylonian possessing Babylonia and Assyria; and Arbaces, Media and Persia. Of this more is See li.l.c.13. said before. In the time of Ninus, Farnus (saith Diodorus Sic.lib.3.1. Diodorus) was King of Media, who, encoun∣tring with Ninus in battell, was there taken, with his wife and seuen sonnes: all which the bloudie Conquerour commanded to be crucified. And thus remained Media hand-maid to the Assyrians, till the time of Sardanapalus; but not without some dis∣quiet. For in Semiramis time the Medes rebelled, and destroyed Niniue. But Semira∣mis inuaded their countrey with a mightie armie: and comming to the hill Bagistanus, sacred to Iupiter, there pitched her tents; and Diodorus lib.3.cap.5. in the plaine fields made a garden, con∣taining twelue furlongs. Beyond the garden she cut a rocke seuenteene furlongs high, grauing therein her owne Image, and an hundred others, bringing her gifts. Some Stuckius de sacris Gentium. tell this otherwise, that she pourtrayed her owne Image in that huge quantitie, and appointed an hundred Priests continually to attend the same with offerings and diuine worships. At Chaona a Citie of Media, she espying another huge rocke in the plaine, caused another garden to be made in the middest thereof, with sumptuous houses of pleasure therein, whence shee might behold all her armie, and there gaue her selfe a long space to rest and voluptuousnes, making choice of the likeliest Gallants in her Campe for her bed-fellowes, all whom she after did to death. Thence to Ecbatana she made the way shorter, and more passeable, casting downe hilles and exalting the valleyes into a plaine, still bearing her name. At Ecbatana Ecbatana was built be∣fore Deioces, yea before Se∣miramis time. she built a Pallace, and brought water thither from the hill Orontes, by a laborious and costly chanell. And thus did she not only subdue the rebellious Medes, but made a conquest of Nature in ostentation of her puissance. The same Diodorus Sic.lib.4.cap.3. Author telleth, that multitudes of Sparrowes, which eat vp their seedes, forced the inhabitants to leaue their soile; as did Mice cause some parts of Italy, and Frogges (rained out of the clouds) the Attariota, and (as we haue Lib.3.cap.15. obserued) the Fleas chased away the inhabitants of Myus. How great is the Creator, that of the smallest of his creatures can muster armies to the conquest of them which swell in conceit of their owne greatnesse? We like Giants by our wicked∣nesse defie the Heauens, and defile the Earth, saying (by our workes) Iob 21.1. Who is the Al∣mightie, that we should serue him? when as yet this LORD of Hosts need not tame vs with legions of Angels (one could destroy Senacheribs host) nor set the Heauens in their courses to fight his battailes (as against the Cananites) nor arraunge the Ele∣ments with an ouer-whelming Chaos to confound vs, by a Sodomiticall fire, or airy pestilence, or deluge of waters, or deuouring of the earth: nor needs he Lions to chal∣lenge apart of this glorie to their strength and prowesse: Frogges, and Lice, and Flies shall be Pharaohs chalengers, conquerours, iaylers: And how many nations in Afri∣ca haue the insulting triumphing Grassehoppers exiled from their natiue dwellings? Proud man, well may the basest of thy basest seruants thus make thee to see thy base∣nesse; and by rebelling against thee, argue thy rebellions against their and thy Creator. Et queenon pro∣sunt singula mul∣ta iuuant. Et quod non pos∣sunt singula, multa nocent. But that we be not too farre transported with this not vniust passion; let vs returne to our Prouince of Media; which Arbaces Reade lib.x.cap.13. deliuered from Assyrian seruitude, and subiected it together with the Easterne Empire to himselfe, vnder whose posteritie it continued three hundred and two and twentie yeares. Astyagas, the last, was by
Cyrus, his Nephew, conquering according to two dreames, which had fore-signified this vnto him. In the first he dreamed, that he saw so much vrine streaming from his daughter Mandane (his only childe) that all Asia was drowned therewith: in the o∣ther, a Vine grew from her, which shadowed all Asia. His Magi Herodot.l..Val.Max. &c. told him, that here∣by was foretold his nephewes greatnesse, with the losse of his kingdome. To preuent this, he wedded his daughter to Cambyses a Persian: and when she was deliuered of a childe, he committed it to Harpagus (one of his trusty Counsellers) to be made away. He fearing reuēge from the daughter, if she should after succeed her father, deliuereth the Infant to Mitradates the Kings Heard-man, commanding him in Astyages name, to expose it on the mountaine. He returning home, found his wife newly deliuered of a dead childe, which, by her entreatie, was laid forth in stead thereof. Her name was Spaco, which in the Median language signifieth a Bitch: whence the fable grew, that Cyrus being so exposed, was nourished by a Bitch. This Infant growing vp, and called by the Heard-mans name, after ten yeares was knowne by this occasion. lustin.lib.1. A company of boyes playing together, chose this stripling for their King, who vsed his childish royalty with more then childish discipline. For he ordained diuers officers, some of them to be his guard, some builders, messengers, &c. as he thought fit. A∣mongst whom was a sonne of one Artembares, a man of great estimation, who for neglecting his office, was by this yong kingling seuerely chastised. Hee complained thereof to his father, and the father brought the childe to the King, accusing the indig∣nitie of the fact, that his Heard-mans sonne should deale so malapertly and cruelly, shewing his beaten shoulders to Astyages. The Heard-man and his supposed sonne was sent for, that Artembares might be satisfied: where the yong King gaue so good account of that his fact, that Astyages much amazed, tooke the Heard-man aside, and with busie enquiry learned of him all the truth of this matter: wherewith enraged a∣gainst Harpagus, who ought himselfe to haue done that dismall execution, but dissem∣bling the same, he told him that he would doe sacrifice for the childes safety, and bad him send his childe to beare Cyrus company, inuiting him also to suppe with him, where he feasted him with the flesh of his owne sonne, whose head, fingers, and toes were set before him at the last seruice. Harpagus bare it as patiently as he could, till fit∣ter occasion of reuenge offered it selfe, which thus fell out. The Magi told Astyages that in this childish kingdome of Cyrus, the danger of his dreame was alreadie passed, and that he needed not feare any further danger. Wherefore he was sent into Persia to his parents. After he was now a man, Harpagus, hauing secretly sollicited the Medes to rebellion against their cruell Soueraigne, acquainted Cyrus with his proiect, to that end enclosing a letter in a Hares belly, which he sent to Cyrus by one of his hunts∣men: which was with such industrie and successe prosecuted, that Astyages lost his Scepter, and Cyrus translated the Empire to the Persians. For Harpagus being made Generall of the armie of the Medes, reuolted to Cyrus with all such as he had made ac∣quainted with his treason. And when the Medes after rebelled in the time of Darius, they were forced againe to subiection. The Magi were by Astyages command cruci∣fied: and he himselfe re-enforcing his power, and bidding battell to Cyrus the second time, was taken aliue, and by his nephew set ouer the Hyrcans. The Magi had large and fertill possessions (thus reporteth Ammian. Marcel. lib.23. Ammianus) assigned them in Media. Their Science called Magia, is by Plato termed Machagistia, which mysticall word signifieth the purest worship of the Gods: to which Science Zoroastres of Bactria in old times added many things out of the mysteries of the Chaldees. But because the Persians had from hence their Empire and this religion, by whose armes they were made knowne to the world: there shall bee fitter place to speake of these Magi, when we treate of the Persian Rites. In this Region was made the oyle Medi∣cum, wherein their arrowes were steeped, which being shot out of a looser bow (for a swifter shot extinguished it) did burne the flesh in which it did sticke, and if water were applied to it, the fire thereof encreased. Nor could any remedie cure the same, but hurling dust thereon. It was composed of Naphta. The Medes made league with this ceremonie. Boem. lib.2.Francisco Tha∣mara.lib.2. They wounded the souldiers of each partie, either licked others bloud.
The North parts of Media were barren, and therefore they liued on Apples, dried and stamped together: of roasted Almons they made bread, and wine of the roots of herbs. This and Venison was their food. In one plaine Pius secundus Asia. of Media were pastured fiftie thou∣sand Mares, belonging to the King: the hearbe whereon they principally fed, is still called Medica. The race of horses, called Nisaei, were heere bred, and hence disper∣sed all ouer the East. Among Alex.ab Alex. lib 4. c.23. the Medes, none might be King by the law of the countrey, except hee were in stature and strength eminent. All the Medes (saith Bardesanes Bar. apud Eu∣seb. deparat. Euang l.6.c.8. a famous Chal∣daean) nourish dogges with great care, to which they cast men readie to die (whiles they are yet breathing) to be deuoured of them. The Medes Plutarch de orb. Lun. Gramaye. Curtius l.b.3. worshipped the fire, with barbarous honors done thereto. Their Kings held such Maiestie, that none might laugh or spit before them: They were sel∣dome seene of their people: They had alway Musitians attending them. Their wiues and children accompanied them in their battailes. The name of the Medes remained famous after the Persian conquest, as appeareth by the stile which the Scripture Dan 6.8. Ester.1.8. giueth them: the law of the Medes and Persians which was vnchangeable, the King himselfe not hauing power to reuoke his sentence. As for the Catalogue of the Kings which succeeded Arbaces, vntill the time of A∣styages, and the times of their raigne, we haue before shewed it out of Scaliger, Scalig. Can. Isag. in our first booke, Chap. 13. True it is, that all agree not in that account. Reinerus R. Renec. Syniag. de fa∣mil. &c.to.1. Reinecci∣us leaue out diuers of them, and numbreth the yeares of the Median Dynastie but 261. whereas our former account hath 322. But I had rather referrre the Reader to that Ca∣talogue, then trouble him with new out of this or other Authors. Media hath beene Maginus The∣saur.Geog. diuided into Media Maior, and Airopatia: the former con∣taineth Tauris, supposed by Ortelius to be the forenamed Eebatana (yet now wanting walls altogether) containing in circuit sixteene miles, and of people two hundred thousand; subdued to the Turke 1585. and before by Selim and Soliman. Sultania I.B.B. fa∣mous for the fairest Moschee in the East. Casbin, to which the Persian hath remoued the royall seat from Tauris. The lake of Van three hundred miles long, and an hun∣dred and fiftie broad (after Strabo Strab.li.11. , Manlianus Lacus) of salt water the greatest next to Meotis. Gyllius Pet.Gyllius in Ortelij 1 hes. affirmeth, that eight great riuers runne into it, without any appa∣rentissue to the sea. Atropatia is now called Seruan; the chiefe Citie is Sumachia, or Shamaki, in which the Sophi not long since Hak.A.len∣kinson. built a Turret of flint and free-stone, and in a ranke of flints therein did set the heads of the Nobilitie and Gentrie of the countrey, for a terrour to the rest: the quarrell was pretended for religion, intended for soueraignetie. Their ancient Religion Plut.de facie in orb. Lun. differed not much from the Persian, and such also is it still. Their Strabo lib 11. Kings had many wiues, which custome extended after to the Villages and mountaines, in so much that they might not haue lesse then seuen. The women Coel.l.18.c.29. also esteemed it a credit to haue many husbands, & a miserable calamitie to haue lesse then fiue. Cyrus subdued them to the Persians, Alexander to the Macedons. What should we speake of the Parthians? who made Ecbatana their seat royal in the summer time: and of the Saracens, Tartars, Persians & Turks, who haue successiuely vexed these coūtries. Not farre from Shamaki, saith Master Ienkinson Hak. Voyag. tom.1. , was an old castle, called Gulli∣stone (now beaten downe by the Sophi) and not farre from thence a Nunry of sump∣tuous building, wherein was buried a Kings daughter, named Ameleck Chauna: who slew her selfe with a knife, for that her father would haue forced her (shee professing chastitie) to haue married a Tartar King: vpon which occasion the maidens euery yere resort thither to mourne her death. There is also a high hill called Quiquifs; vpon the top whereof (they Asabulous report of the Medes. say) dwel∣leth a Giant named Arneoste, hauing on his head two great hornes, and eares and eyes like a Horse, and a taile like a Cow, who kept a passage thereby, till one Haucoir Hamshe (a holy man) bound him with his woman Lamisache and his sonne After; who is therefore had in Saint-like reputation. Obdolowcan King of this countrey vnder the Sophie, besides gratious entertainment
granted vnto Master Anthonie Ienkinson for our English Merchants great priuiledges, Anno 1563. Gilan, also anciently Gelae, is reckoned to Media. Into these Cities of Media the 2. Reg. 17.6. Israelites were transported, together with their religion by Salmanesar the Assyrian: GOD in his manifold wisdome so punishing their sinnes, and withall dispersing some sparkes of diuine truth. CHAP. III. Of The Parthians, and Hyrcanians. PArthia is placed by Pliny Lib.6.25. in the rootes of the hilles: hauing on the East, the Arians; on the West, the Medes; on the South, Carmania; on the North, Hyrcania, rounded with deserts. He affirmeth that the kingdomes of the Parthians were eighteene. Eleuen of them neere to the Caspian sea; and the other seuen neere the red sea. The word Par∣thian signifieth with the Scythians an exile. Their chiefe Citie was He∣catompylos, now (as some Maginus. affirme) Hispaham, for the excellencie thereof called of the Persians, Halfe the World. These Scythian exiles in the times of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, and Macedonians, were an obscure people, the prey of euery Con∣querour, which after seemed to diuide the world with the Romans. Their speech was mixt of the Median and Scythian: their armies consisted most part of seruants, which they held in great respect, instructing them in feats of armes. In an armie of fiftie thou∣sand, wherewith they encountred Antony, there were onely 800. free-men. The par∣thians Iustin.41. had no vse of gold or siluer, but in their armor. They had many wiues, whereof they were so iealous, that they forbad them the sight of other men. They performed all busines priuate and publike on horse-backe; this being the distinction of free-men from seruants. Their burial was in the bellies of birds, or dogs. Their naked bones were after couered with earth: they were exceedingly superstitious in the worshippe of their gods: a stout, vnquiet, seditious, vnfaithfull people. Arsaces, first a famous theefe, af∣ter, the founder of that kingdome, left no lesse memorie of himselfe amongst the Par∣thians, then Cyrus among the Persians, or Alexander among the Macedonians. The day wherein he ouerthrew Seleucus, was solemnely obserued euery yeare amongst them, as the beginning of their liberty. Of him they called all their Kings Arsaces, as the Roman Emperours are named Caesars. They Am.Mar.lib.23. called themselues the brethren of the Sunne and Moone, which are in those places worshipped. This Arsaces was worship∣ped after his death. They were no lesse bloudy to their brethren, when they came to the Crowne, then the Ottomans are at this day. Phrahartes Iustin.lib.42. slew thirty of his brethren, and before them, his father, and after, his sonne, rather then he would endure a possibility of a Competitor. About Vadianus. Sec fol.5. 228. yeres after CHRIST, Artabanus the last Persian King be∣ing slaine by Artaxeres or Artaxares the Persian, the Empire returned to the Persi∣ans, who were thereof depriued by the Saracens; and they againe by the Tartars: and now for the greatest part vnder the Sophi: they had their cuppe-quarrels, striuing who should draw deepest: which custome we need not goe into Parthia to seeke. Strabo mentioneth among the Parthians a Colledge or Senate of Magi and Wise-men. Their ancient religious Rites I find not particularly related. The Parthian affaires are thus by some Iustin.lib.41. Dion Cassius lib.4 . Pius secundus Asia. Gramaye Par∣thica; P.Biz: rus Rerum Per∣sicaram.lib.30. related. After Alexanders death, none of the Macedonians vouchsafing so meane a Prouince, Stragonor a forreiner obtained it: after which the Macedonians, contending in ciuill quarrels for the Soueraignety, Parthia wauered in vncertaintie, till in the time of Soleucus the nephew of Antiochus, Theodotus, Deputie of Cachia, entituled himselfe King: so giuing example of rebelli∣on to the Easterne Nations, which Arsaces among the Parthians easily followed. He combining himself with Theodotus, and after his death, with his sonne strengthened himself in his new erected gouernement of two Cities. But Seleucus taking armes
against him, was by him ouerthrowne in battell: which day first gaue light to the Par∣thian greatnesse, not vnworthily obserued therefore of their posteritie with solemni∣ty. For Seleucus being by more important affaires called home, the Parthians had leasure to establish their hopes. Athenaeus reporteth that Arsaces tooke him priso∣ner, and after gentle vsage he sent him home. After this first, came a second Arsaces, who encountered with Antiochus the sonne of Seleucus, comming against him with an armie of an hundred thousand foot-men, and twentie thousand horse. The issue was, they parted friends in mutuall league. Priapatius or Pampatius was their third King, to whom Phraates his sonne succee∣ded; and next, his brother Mithradates, who subdued the Medes and Helimaeans, enlarging the Parthian Empire, from Mount Caucasus to Euphrates. He tooke De∣metriu. King of Syria prisoner: and died in his old age. His sonne Phraates was the fourth: on whom Antiochus warred, and the Parthian opposed against him his bro∣ther Demetrius, till then detained prisoner. But whiles he warred against the Scy∣thians, by treason of his owne subiects he was slaine; and Artabanus his vncle placed in his roome. He also soone after died of a wound receiued in the field: and his sonne Mithridates succeeded, whom the Parthian Senate expelled and deposed. But o∣thers reckon betweene Artabanus and Mithridates, Pacorus, and his sonne Phraates. So vncertaine is the Parthian Historie; for which cause also Reade lib.1.cap.13. Scaliger blameth Onu∣phrius for being too peremptory in such vncertainties. Next in order is reckoned Orodes or Herodes, who besieged his said brother Mithri∣dates in Babylon, and tooke both it and him, and caused him to be slaine in his sight, Against him Crassus the Roman Consul (moued with couetousnes, L.Florus lib.3. cap.11. hatefull to GOD and man, saith Florus) led the Roman Legions to winne the Parthian gold: And by the way, Ioseph. Antiq.lib.14.cap.12. passing thorow Iudaea, spoiled the sacred Treasury which Pompey spared, amounting to two thousand talents, and robbed the Temple of eight thousand ta∣lents besides. He also carried away a beame of solid gold, weighing three hundred Minae (euery Minae is two pound and a halfe Roman) deliuered vnto him by Eleazarus the Treasurer, vpon condition to take nothing else. But Crassus violated the oath which he had giuen to Eleazarus, and carried all he liked. Many dismall Stadius in Floru. presages prohibited Crassus this expedition, as the curses of the Tribune, whom Dion, Plutarch, and Appian, call Ateius Capito. Those curses were denounced with inuocation of some vnknowne gods. Also the Roman ensignes were drowned, with sudden tem∣pests in Euphrates: and when Plutarch. Crassus. Liny epitome lib.106. Eutropij lib.6.Dion Cas.lib.40. Sim. Maioli dies Canic. Colloq.16. he had sacrificed to Venus, his sonne stumbled and fell, and Crassus with him. He reiected the Legates of the Parthian, alledging the for∣mer league with Pompey. Thus posting to his destruction, one Mazaras (as Florus calls him; or as Plutarch, Ariamnes; Dion, and Appianus, name him Augarus) encoun∣tred him, not with armes, but with artes and wiles, professing great hostilitie to the Parthians. Crassus following his aduice, led his armie into by-wayes and deserts, till being brought into the Parthian snares, his new guide forsooke him, and the coue∣tous Consul with his sonne were slaine, and eleuen Roman Legions taken or left in the place. His head and periured right hand were sent by Surinas the Parthian Gene∣rall (who was said to haue then in the field with him twelue hundred Concubines, and a thousand Camels laden with his owne furniture) vnto King Orodes: who contume∣liously, (if contumely and merit can ioyne societie) vsed the same, powring into his iawes, sometimes greedie of that metall, molten gold. Orodes enuying Surinas the glorie of this victorie, slew him, and committed the remnants of that warre to be pur∣sued by his sonne Pacorus, adioyning to him in that exploite Osaces. In the ciuill warres they tooke part with Pompey against Caesar. Pacorus being receiued into so∣cietie of the kingdome with his father, inuaded Iudaea, and placing Antigonus in the kingdome, captiued Hircanus. But whiles he aspired to greater hopes, hee lost him∣selfe and his armie, in which were twentie thousand horse-men, in a battell with Ven∣tidius; who by a wily Stratageme, counterfeiting flight and feare, and suffering the Parthians to come vp to their tents, that they had now no space for their arrowes, ef∣fected this ouerthrow.
Pacorus his head reduced the Cities of Syria to the Roman subiection, without further war. This newes made his father madde, who before boasting of the conquest of Asia by Pacorus, now in many dayes did neither speake nor eate: but when hee once did open his mouth, all his speech was Pacorus, who still seemed present vnto him. In this extaticall moode, Phraates, one of his thirtie soones, which he had by so many Concubines, slew him, and after them his brethren, as before is said, with a sonne also of his owne. This cruelty caused many Parthians to betake themselues to voluntarie exile, among which Monaeses prouoked Flor.l.4.c.10. Dion lib.49. Antonius to warre vpon this Tyrant. He did so, but with badde successe, of sixteene Legions scarce bringing the third part backe againe. Phraates, impotent and vncapable of so glorious aduentures, grew into such insolencies, that the people exiled him, and placed Tiridates in his roome; who was soone after displaced by the Scythians, and Phraates restored to his place. Tiridates fled to Augustus (then warring in Spaine) for refuge and aide, carry∣ing with him the sonne of Phraates, whom Caesar sent backe againe to his father without any price, maintaining neither partie against the other, but allowing liberall prouision to Tiridates. But after this, Suetonius in vita Augusti, cap.21. Augustus going into the East, the Parthian, fearing ill measure, re-deliuered all the Roman captiues, and ensignes, and gaue hostages also, his two sonnes, with their wiues and children, and resigned Armenia to the Romans. Phraatax his sonne slew him, with greatest iniustice repaying that which was most iust, and due to his former paricide. This Phraatax, vsing incestuous acquaintance with his mother Thermusa (an Italian, whom Augustus had bestowed on Phraates, and by whose helpe he was slaine) was killed in an vprore, leauing his sonne Orodes his successor. He also in a conspiracie was killed: and Vonon Sueton. in vita Tiberij, cap.49. substituted, whom the Parthians not long en∣during, forced to seeke helpe of the Romans, where he was perfidiously slaine. Artabanus obtained the Empire, Mat. Burgk∣lehner. thes.hist. lib.6. tom.1. from whence he was after chased by Vitellius, who placed Tiridates in the throne, which he had scarce warmed, when Artabanus re∣couered it, and after left to his sonne Bardanes; the Arsacian stocke being now dis∣possessed. This Bardanes Cornel. Tacit. Annal. lib.11. whiles he mindeth warres against the Romans is killed of his owne. Gotarzes his brother succeded to the Scepter: which he held, notwithstanding the decree of the Roman Senate for Meherdates the son of Vonon, whom he tooke and cut off his eares: Vonones was his successor, a little while, and presently after Vologaeses, his sonne. The next was Artabanus, and after him Pacorus; and in the next place Cos∣droes his brother: against whom Traian warred with good successe, who extended the Roman Empire to the Indians. But Adrian renued league with the Parthian. Partha∣naspates succeeded: and soone after Vologaeses, who left heire his sonne of the same name, depriued by his brother Art abanus. He being vniustly dealt with by the Romans trechery, draue them to sue for peace: which, after that Antonius Herodiani Macrinus. the author of the breach was dead, was easily obtained by Macrinus his successor. But Artaxares a Per∣sian preuailed better, in a third battell ouerthrowing him, and reducing the kingdome after such a world of yeares to the Persian name. Some reckon this 472. yeares from Arsaces, and 228. after CHRIST. Scaliger Ios. Scal. Ca∣non. Isagog. li.2. reckoneth the time of the Parthian Dynastie 479. yeares. The number of their Kings after this computation is 29. They which list to see further of their warres of the Romans, may reade the Roman Au∣thors which haue written the same: the summe whereof is heere presented to your view. Cornelius Tacitus Cor. Tac.l.12. telles a merry tale (for I thinke these tragedies haue wearied you) and pertinent to our purpose, of a good-fellow-like Hercules, whom the Par∣thians worshipped. This kind-hearted god warneth his Priests in a dreame, that neere to his Temple they should set horses ready furnished for hunting, which they doe, la∣ding them with quiuers full of arrowes. These after much running vp and downe the forrest, returne home at night blowing and breathlesse, their quiuers being emptied. And Hercules (no nigard of his venison) acquainteth the Priests at night by another vision with all his disport, what woods he hath raunged, and the places of his game. They searching the places, find the slaine beasts.
Better fellowship certaine had their Hercules then their Kings, when they inuited any to their feasts. For the King Albenaeus lib.4.cap.14. had his table alone and loftie, the guests sit below on the ground, and, like dogges, feed on that which the King casteth to them. And many times vpon occasion of the Kings displeasure, they are haled thence & scourged, & yet they then, prostrate on the ground, adore their striker. They Herodiani Macrinus worshipped the Sunne at his arising. Bardesanes Eusebius de praepar Euang.lib 6. cap.8. in Eusebius, saith of them, that to kill his wife, or sonne, or daughter, or brother, or sister (yet vnmarried) was not prohibited by the law to any Parthian, nor any way subiect to punishment. The Parthian Sucton. Cali∣gula.5. ensigne was a Dragon; the royall ensigne a bow: their stile was, King of Kings; they ware a double crowne. They had an oyntment made of a certaine composition, which no priuate man might vse. Nor might any else drinke of the waters of Choaspes and Eulaeus. None might come to the King without a present. The Magi were in great authoritie with them. Their Rites were mixt of the Persian and Scythian. Nothing was more seuerely punished then adultery. A seruant might not be made free, nor might be suffered (except in the warres) to ride, or a free-man to goe on foot. Their fight was more dangerous in fly∣ing, then in standing or giuing the onset. Terga Scneca in Oc∣dipo. conuer simetuenda Parthi. The Parthians flight doth most affright. They account Am. Marcel.lib.23. them the most happy which are slaine in battell. They which die a naturall death are vpbraided with cowardise. Their fight Lucan Eucanus. describeth: Pugna levis, bellum{que} fugax, turmoe{que} fugaces, Et melior cessisse loco, quàm pellcre, miles: Illita terr a dolis, nec Martem cominùs vnquam Ausa pati virtus, sed longè tendere nerves. That is, Light skirmish, fleeing warre, and scattred bands, And better soldiours when they runne away, Then to beate off an enemy that stands. Their crafty caltrops on the ground they lay: Nor dares their courage come to right-downe blowes, But fighteth further off most trusting to their bowes. Many Cities amongst them, and two thousand Villages are said Pius secundu Gramaye Parth. to haue beene o∣uerwhelmed with Earth-quakes. They are said to be of spare diet, to eat no flesh, but that which they take in hunting: to feed with their swords girt to them, to eat Locusts: to be false liers and perfidious: to haue store of wiues and strumpets. Their countrey is now called Arach; in it is made great quantitie of silkes. Hyrcania (now called Straua or Diargument) hath on the West, Media; on the East, Margiana; on the South, Parthia; on the North, the sea, which hereof is called the Hyrcane, otherwise Caspian. Famous it hath beene, and is, for store of woods and Tygers. There are also other wild beasts. Here in the Citie Nabarca was an Oracle, which gaue answeres by dreames. Some riuers in this countrey haue so steepe a fall into the sea, that vnder the waters the people resort to sacrifice or banquet; the streame shooting violently ouer their heads without wetting them. Iouins writeth, That the aire is vnwholesome by reason of the fennes. Straua the chiefe Citie aboundeth in traffike for Silke. The Ilands be∣fore it in the sea, were no lesse refuge to the inhabitants in the Tamberlane-tempest, then to the Italians, in the time of Attila, those places where now Venice standeth. Their Religion, as their State, both in times past and present, hath followed the Persi∣an: of whom we are next to speake. It is Strabo lib.11. reported of the Tappyri, inhabiting neere to Hyrcania, That their custome was to bestow their wiues on other men, when they had borne them two or three chil∣dren: so did Caeto his wife Martia, on Hortensius: and such, saith Vertomannus, is the
custome at this day of the Indians in Calechut, to exchange wiues in token of friend∣shippe. They had wine in such estimation, that they annointed their bodies Caelius Rhod. lib.18. cap.28. therewith. The Caspij shut vp their parents, after they are come to the age of seuentie yeares, and there in respect of pietie (what more could the impious doe?) starue them to death. Some say, That after that age they place them in some desert, and a farre off obserue the euent. If the fowles seize on them with their talents, and teare them out of their cof∣fius, they account it a great happinesse: not so, if dogs or wilde beasts prey thereon. But if nothing meddle therewith, it is accounted a miserable and lamentable case. The Der∣bices account all faults (though neuer so small) worthy of the vtmost punishment. The Earth was their Goddesse: to their holies they admitted nothing female, nor to their tables. They killed such as were aboue seuentie yeares old, calling to that bloudie banquet their neighbours, esteeming such miserable, as by disease were intercepted and taken away. Old womens flesh they eate not, but strangled, and then buried them: they likewise buried such as died before that age. CHAP. IIII. Of Persia, and the Persian affaires, vntill the Mahumetan conquest. PErsia, if we take it strictly, is thus bounded by Ptolomey Lib.6.cap.4. : It hath on the North, Media; on the East, Carmania; on the West, Susiana; on the South, part of the Persian Gulfe. But this name is sometimes stret∣ched as farre, as that wide and spacious kingdome; all that Empire being often called in Authors, Persia, and differing in the bounds and limits, according to the enlarging or contracting of that Monarchie. It is supposed, that the Persians descended of Elam, the sonne of Gen.10. 22. Shem; whose name remained vnto a Region called Elymais, mentioned by Ptol.lib.6.c.3. Ptolomey, placed in the North parts of Media. Pliny mentioneth Plin.l.6.c.28. the Elamstae, on the South, next to the sea, which name Hierome Hieron. in s. 13.Xenophon. in his daies gaue to one of that Nation, frater quidam Elamí∣ta, &c. Xenophon also nameth the Tribe of the Elamites. Moses telleth of the reigne and power of Chedorlaomer King of Elam, Genes.14. in that morning of the world extended to the borders of Canaan. Herodotus Herodot. lib.7. reporteth, that they were called of the Greekes Cephenes; of the neighbouring nations, Artaei. Suidas Suidas in verb. Magog. affirmeth that they were cal∣led of the inhabitants Magog, and Magusaei. Other names are by Ortelius Ortelij Theat. & Thesaurus. added, Chorsori, Achaemenij, Panchaia &c. It was called Persia of Perseus the sonne of Da∣nae, or of Perses the sonne of Andromeda; or (as others) of Perses the sonne of Me∣dea. From the time of Chedorlaomer, whom Abram with his houshold-army ouer∣threw, vntill the time of Cyrus, little mention is made of them: he freed them from the Median seruitude, and erected first that mightie Persian Monarchie. Bizarus P. Bizar. Hi∣storia rerum Persicarum. Christ. Pezel. medific. historic. pars 1. (which hath written twelue bookes of the Persian affaires) supposeth that in that time of their subiection to the Assyrians and Medes, they had Gouernours, and lawes, of their owne: onely owing a tributarie subiection to the other, as their supreme Lords. This he collecteth out of Xenophon. Cyrus was by name foretold by Esay Es.44.28. , and the re∣building of Ierusalem, and the Temple, by his authoritie, before that Babylonian Mo∣narchie was erected which destroyed them. GOD after reuealed to Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel by dreames, this Persian both rising and fall. And by dreames did hee make way vnto the effecting of his decree; as appeareth in Herodotus, Iustine and o∣thers. For Astyages Herodot.lib.1.Iustin. lib.1. dreaming that he saw a vine growing out of the wombe of his daughter Mandane, which couered all Asia (interpreted by his Wizards, of the sub∣uersion of his kingdome by his daughters future issue) married her as before is said, to Cambvses a Persian, descended of the stocke of Perseus sonne of Iupiter, and Danae, and the sonne of Achaemenes, Of this fami∣ly and other of the Persians, see Reineccius tom.1. that so in that remote region, meanes might faile vnto
any aspiring designes. The Chaldaeans report, as Alphaeus recordeth out of Megasthe∣nes, that Nabuchodonosor The Papists to vphold the credit of lu∣dith, make an∣other Nabucho∣doniso, which sent sorth Ho∣lofernes, &c. and say that he was called As∣suerus, and Ar∣taxeries Prilcus, the same which Daniel cals Da∣rius Medas. Sixt. Senc. Bi∣blioth.sa.l.1. hauing conquered all Libya, and Asia, as far as Armenia, at his returne, rauished with diuine fury, cried out, That a Persian Mule should come, and subdue the Babylonians. This agrees somewhat both with the dreame, and the mad∣nesse recorded of that King by Daniel, Chap. 2. and 4. The Oracle of Delphos made like answere to Craesus. That the Lydians should then flee, when a Mule should gouern the Medes. He was termed a Mule, Christ. Pezel. Mellif. histor. pars.1. because of his more noble parentage by the mo∣ther, then the father, and their diuersitie of Nation. Strabo Strab. lib.15. thinkes he was called Cyrus of a Riuer in Persia, being before called Agradatus. Plutarch.in vita Artaxerxis. Plutarch saith, he was cal∣led Cyrus of the Sunne, which with the Persians hath that name. Polyoenus Polyoenus lib.8.trat. calleth his wife Nitet is, daughter of Aprias King of Egypt. Suidas saith it was Bardane, and that she was daughter of Cyaxares, otherwise called Darius Medus. He conquered the Median Empire first; and after added two others, the A.M.3402. Lydian and 3409.Caluis. Babylonian. Craesus the Lydian consulting with the Oracle about the successe of his warre, receiued answere. , that is, Craesus passing Hale, great state shall make to fall. This he interpreted of the ouerthrow of Cyrus, but proued it in himselfe; Craesus his sonne had beene mute, till (now seeing the sword of the enemy readie to giue the fa∣tall stroke vnto his father) violence of sudden passion brake open those barres and stoppes which Nature had set before, as impediments to his speech, and by his first most fortunate-infortunate language, cried to the bloudie souldiers to spare his Great were the treasures which Cyrus gate in his warres; but his expenses in his daily diet (en∣grauen in a piller, which Alexander cau∣sed to be ra∣sed) seeme in∣credible: the particulars whereof, see in Polyn.lib.4. and Opmeerus pag.105. fa∣ther. After his many great exploits, he warred vpon Thamyris the Scythian Queene, where he lost his life. I know not how, Diuine Prouidence seemeth to haue set those Scythian stints to the Persian proceedings: those great Monarches, both in the elder, and our later world, euer finding those Northerne windes crossing, and in some dis∣mall successe prohibiting their ambition that way. Ctesias (as Photius Ctesias ap. Photum, ed. inter hist.Persscriptrs. hath collected out of his eleuenth booke) telleth somewhat o∣therwise of Cyrus; as that Astyages, whom he calleth Astygas, was not of any kinne to him, but being conquered by him, was first imprisoned, and after enlarged, and kind∣ly entreated: likewise that his daughter Amytis (her husband Spytama being slaine) was married to Cyrus: that Craesus being taken, was first by magicall illusions deliue∣red from the executioners, and after by tempest of thunder, with many other things of like vnlikenesse to the current of Authors, Cyrus was of so firme memory, that he could call all the souldiers (some say but all that had any place of command) by their proper names. He ordained, that his souldiers should in the first ioyning with the enemie sing certaine Hymnes to Castor and Pollux, that by this means they should not be surprised with sudden feare. He gaue leaue to the Iewes to returne and re-people their country, & to rebuild the Temple. Scaliger Cal∣uisius. Alij A.M.3421. A. M. 3419. Cambyss his sonne succeeded, who tooke, and after slew, Psammenitus King of E∣gypt. And when he would haue added Aethiopia Herodot.lib.3. to his new conquests, with the spoiles of the Temple of Ammon, for which purposes he sent two armies; the one was almost consumed with famine, the beasts and prouisions failing, and that barren desert denying grasse; the remainder by consuming one another, were (a strange remedie) preserued from consumption, euery tenth man being by lot tithed to the shambles, and more returning in their fellowes mawes, then on their owne legges. The other armie was quite buried in the sands. At his returne finding the Egyptians solemnizing the feast of their Idoll Apis, he slew the same (it was a Bull which they worshipped): and after dreaming that Smerdis reigned, he sent, and slew his brother which was so cal∣led, in vaine seeking to frustrate this presage, which was fulfilled in another of that name. He fell in loue with his sister; and asking whether it were lawfull for him to marry her, the Iudges (whose authoritie with the Persians lasted with their liues) an∣swered, that they had no such law, but they had another that the King of Persia might doe what him liked; whereupon he married her. His crueltie appeared, in that Prexaspis presuming to admonish him of his too much inclination to drunkennesse,
he answered, he should see proofe of the contrarie, and presently sending for Prexaspis his sonne, with an arrow shot him to the heart: the father not daring but to commend his steadie hand & art in shooting. He died of his owne sword, which falling out of his scabberd as he mounted his horse, killed him, not fearing in this countrey of Syria any such disaduenture, because the Oracle of Latona Bizar, i.1. in Aegypt had told him he should die at Ecbatana; which he vnderstood of Media, and was fulfilled at another Ecbatana (more obscure) in Syria. He caused a Iudge, which had beene corrupted with money, to be flayed, and made of his skinne a couering for the Tribunall. Polyaenus tels, That against the Aegyptians he vsed this stratageme, to set their Gods (Dogges, Cattes, Sheepe, &c.) in the fore-front of his battaile. He neither deserued nor obtained that ho∣nourable funerall which Cyrus had, who was buried at Pasargadae, a Tower shadowed with Trees, hauing in the vpper part a Chappell furnished with a Bedde of Gold, a Ta∣ble, Cuppes, and Vessels of the same mettall, with store of Garments and Furniture, set with Iewels. Certaine Magi were appointed to attend it, with daily allowance of a Sheepe, and once a moneth a Horse for Sacrifice. His Epitaph was, O man, I am Cyrus, King of Asia. Founder of the Persian Empire; therefore enuie me not a Sepulchre. Alexander opened the same in hope of Gold, but found nothing, sauing a rotten Shield, a Sword, and two Scythian Bowes: he crowned it with Gold, and couering it with his owne apparrell, departed. These things Strab.l.15. Arrian.l.6. Curtius, l.9. Strabe, Arrianus, and Curtius report. Next to Cambyses 3428. succeeded, for a small time, one Smerdis, which was slaine as an Vsurper, by the seuen Princes; and Darius 3429. , the sonne of Hystaspes, succeeded, desig∣ned to that greatnesse by the first neighing of his Horse. For when no male issue royall was left, these Princes agreed, That meeting in a place appointed, he whose Horse first neighed, should be acknowledged Emperour. Darius his Horse-keeper, the night be∣fore, had suffered his Horse there to vse his bruitish lust with a Mate; which the place presently causing him to remember, he there (by his lustfull neighing) aduaunced his Master to the Scepter. Darius for his couetousnesse (first exacting tribute) was called a Marchant, Cambyses a Lord, Cyrus a Father of his people. Babylon rebelled, and was 3436. recouered by the costly stratageme of Zopyrus Iustin.l.. Plutarch. in Apophibeg. , who cut off his nose and eares, and fleeing in that deformed plight to the Babylonians, accused Darius of that cruel∣tie. They beleeuing, entertained him, and knowing his Nobilitie and Prowesse, com∣mitted their Citie to his fidelitie, which he vpon the next opportunitie betrayed to his Master. Darius warred against the Scythians, but vnfortunately. His Armie was of 700000 men. After Darius his death Xerxes 3466.Scal. Animad.in useb.pag.101. raigned (whome Scaliger proueth to be Assucrus, the husband of Esther.) He made League with the Carthaginians, warred vpon the Grecians with an Armie (as Herodotus Herodot l.7. numbreth) of 1700000 footmen, 80000 horsemen, 20000 Chariot-men: Others say, That there were 2317000 foot∣men in Land-forces, besides 1208 shippes. Before the Armie was drawne the sacred Chariot of Iupiter, by eight white horses; no mortall man might ascend the Seat. He offered to Minerua at Troy 1000 Oxen. He, taking view of his huge Armie, wept, in thinking, that of al that number in 100 yeres none would be aliue. At the passing of the Hellespontike straits, he (besides other deuotions performed) at the Sunne-rising tooke a golden Viall full of sacred liquor, & cast the same into the Sea, with a golden Bowle and a Persian Sword; vncertaine whether in honour of the Sunne, or in satisfaction to the angrie Hellespont, which a little before, in more then madde arrogance, he had cau∣sed to be whipped, and hurled fetters therein, with many menacing threats. He wrote letters with like threatnings to Mount Athos, and accordingly pierced his bowels, and made way by force through that high and huge Mountaine. This Expedition was in the yeare of the World 3470. Leonides, with his Spartans, enlarged his glorie at the Thermopylaean straits Xerxes sent first 15000, after 20000, and lastly 50000 choice men a∣gainst them which all had the worse: till a traitor taught Xerxes another way where to passe & come vpon their backes: and then Leonides in the night entered the Persian campe & slew 20000 with his 500 men which were killed be∣ing weary with killing. , or narrow passage, which a long time, with a handfull of men, hindred the Persians from passing. Mardonius was slaine, & Xerxes fled out of Greece, after he had taken Athens, and lost great part of his Armie, which in two yeares space receiued fiue ouerthrowes, at Thermopylae, at Artemisium, at Salamis, at Plataeae, at My∣cale. Xerxos being slaine of Artabauus his kinsman, A. M. 3485. Artaxerxes succeeded.
Among other the mad parts of Xerxes, it is reported, That hee fell in loue with a Aelian. Var. Hist.l.1. Plane Tree in Lydia, which he adorned with chaines and costly furniture, and ap∣pointed a Guardian thereto. Artaxerxes writ to Hystanes, Gouernour of Hellespon∣tus, That he should giue Hippocrates Cous (who then liued, and whose writings still re∣maine the Physicians Oracles) as much Gold and other things as he would, and send him vnto him. In his time the Aegyptians rebelled, and created Inarus their King, to whome the Athenians sent three hundred Gallies for defence; but by Artabazus and Megabyzu they were subdued. To him Ismenias the Theban was embassador: who loth to pollute the Grecian freedome with that Persian custome of adoration (a thing for the shew of Religion therein, as some interprete, no lesse hated of Mordecay, Esth.3.) and not suffered otherwise to doe his Embassage, let fall his Ring when hee was brought into the Kings presence, and falling downe, tooke it vp at the Kings feet, satisfying both the Persian and his owne by this Aelian. Var. Hist. l.1. subtletie. Artaxerxes died An. M. 3525. After this Artaxerxes, surnamed Long-hand, another Xerxes succeeded and raigned a small time, as did also Sogdianus, or Ogdianus, whome Darius Nothus slew, and pos∣sessed the Throne. In the time of this King was the Peloponnesian Warre, which Thu∣cydides hath related. Artaxerxes Mnemon his sonne succeeded An. M. 3545. He slew his brother Cyrus, and enioyed the Scepter 43. yeares. After his death succeeded O∣chus, and raigned three and twentie yeares. Next to him was Arses, or Arsames; and last of all Darius, whome Alexander ouerthrew the second time at Arbela, An. M. 3619, and conquered that Persian Monarchie to the Macedonians. Of the Macedoni∣an successors of Alexander (so much as concerneth this place) is before handled in our Syrian relation. They were depriued of these parts by Arsaces, of whome and all his Parthian followers, euen now yee haue read in the Chapter of Parthia. Concerning these Persian Kings, Chronologers (after their wont) differ not a little: Master Liuely his Chronologie of the Persian Monarchie. Liuely hath taken great paines in this Argument; besides the painefull labours of Scaliger, Iunius and many others, both Rabbines, and Greeks, and Latines, in whose streams Elephants may swimme, and the greatest Students may find enough to busie their studious braines: for me, it is sufficient to tast, or at least to enter so farre as a Lambe may safely wade, without perill of drowning, The Hebrews, through ig∣norance of the Olympiades, and humane Authors (where they are destitute of their owne) are most absurd, some Aben Ezra. reckoning but foure Persian Kings in all, till Alexan∣ders time: some Rab. Moses. account fiue: and some R. Sadiah. & Abr. Dauison. three. Against these, Pererius and Tem∣porarius Temporar. l 3. most sharpely (and not vnworthily) inueigh, as also against their Seder O'am Rabba, Sede Olam Zo.a, Historiall Ca∣bala Chroni∣cles, which ascribe to the Persians, from the first yeare of Darius the Mede, but two and fifty yeares. Iosephus better seene in Ethnike Authors dissenteth from them. As for Metasthenes of Annius, wee haue before shewed him to bee counterfeit, and the rest of his brethren, to be either the bastards of Annius, or Changelings, which he hath nursed, and would father vpon those Authors, whose names they beare. Viues I.V ues, in pro.l18.de c.u.

Gorop. Becce∣san. Goropius bestowes much paines in the vncasing of them; and learned men Aercator. Ios Scalger, Vola∣terranus, Pere∣rius, Temporari∣us &c. doe now generally distast them. Iosephus Ioseph.contra Ap.. cites Megasthenes in quarte Indicorum, the fourth Booke of his Indian Historie; from whence Petrus Comestor alledgeth the same testimonie, with deprauing the word Indicorum, and making it Iu∣diciorum. Annius addes, not onely the corrupting of the name Metasthenes for Me∣gasthenes, but a Historie vnder his Metasthenes Annij. name, de Iudicio Temporum & Annalium Persice∣rum, wherein no maruell if he proceede in the Storie as he began in the title. Beroal∣dus Beroaldi Chron.li.3. in the Persian Chronologie faineth diuerse names to the Persian Kings; as As∣suerus, Artaxerxes, Darius Assyrius, Artaxerxes Pius. Lively, and other moderne Writers out of the Greeke Olympiads and Histories, haue giuen truer accompt of the Persian Times and Gouernment, beginning with the fiue and fiftieth Olympiad, and continuing the same to the third yeare of the hundred and twelfth.
Scaliger and Calvisius (as you haue seene before) doe a little differ from this ac∣compt of M. Lively. which he liuely proueth by conference of other Histories, both Humane and Ecclesiasticall, Clemens, Eusebius, Herodotus, Diodorus, Polybius, Xeno∣phon, Thucidides, Diouysius Halicarnasseus, Livie and others. As much adoe is made about the beginning and ending of Daniels weekes, and the time of the building and finishing the second Temple, both which are much illustrated by the right knowledge of the Persian Chronologie. Iunius Iun.

Con∣cent. Elie Reusneri Isag. hist.l.2. , Reusnerus, and others haue writ∣ten; it were too tedious here to relate. Artaxerxes (others call him, perhaps more truly, Artaxares) recouered the Persian Name and Empire fiue hundred thirtie eight yeares, as Bizarus. Lib. 4. reckoneth, after Alexander the Great had extinguished them, and in the yeare of our LORD, 230. Others say it was in the yere of CHRIST 233, and in the yeare of the World 4182, and 563 after Alexanders Conquest: others otherwise. The catalogue of Of this later Persian Dynastie see Aga∣thias, Bizarus, Pezelius, and Lampadius in Mellisicio Hist. part.2.& 3.Cearenus & Z∣naras, An.li.3.&c. the Persian Kings in that their second Dynastie, you may reade before, Lib. 1. c. 13. Artaxares being a man of haughtie spirit, fought three battailes with Artabanus the Parthian, and at the third time depriued him of Life and Scepter together. He pro∣ceeded to subdue the neighbouring Barbarians; and passing ouer Tigris, disturbed the Romane Prouince of Mesopotamia, deuouring in hope, and threatening in tearmes all those Asian Prouinces, sometimes subiect to the Persians, before the Macedonian de∣luge. Alexander Seuerus (sonne of Mammea) the Emperour writ to him, to stay his course: But Pikes, not Pennes, were like to preuaile with Artaxares, who brought into the Field seuen hundred Elephants and eighteene hundred Charriots, and many thou∣sands of horsemen, but with much bloudshed was forced to leaue the honour of the day to the Romans. Herodianus seemeth to write harder fortunes of the Romanes in this warre. But Lampridius, Eutropins, Orosius. and Zosimus write, That Senerus obtai∣ned the victorie, and tooke Ctesiphon and Babylon, and subdued also Arabia. Aga∣thias Agathias, l.2. affirmeth, That Artaxares was called Magus. Valerianus was ouerthrowne by Sapores, the successor of Artaxares, in Mesopota∣mia, and there taken, and was made a foot-stoole for Sapores, on whose necke he vsed to tread, when he tooke horse; and at last was flayed aliue, and sprinkled with Salt. Zosimus sayth, That he was trecherously taken at a meeting for conference: and Tre∣bellius Pollio ascribeth it to the treason of his guide. This cruell Tyrant afflicted the Ro∣man Prouinces, to Cilicia and Cappadocia, filling with dead bodies the broken spaces betweene the Hils feeding (as it were) those deformed gaping iawes with cruell ban∣quets of mans flesh. Oaenatus Palmirinus brought some light to the Romans in this darkened and dreadfull Eclipse of their Sunne, and recouered the Romane territories. His wife Zenobia after his death, like another Semiramis, proued a fortunate Generall and Warrior against the Persians, and also against the Romans, from whome she with∣held Syria, till Valerius Aurehanus carried her to Rome, being by vnexpected accident surprised. As for Valerianus, it was the iust iudgement of GOD for his cruell perse∣cution of the Christians, whome he had at first fauoured, till one of the Aegyptian Priests had persuaded him to this and other wickednesse, as humane sacrifices, and such like, Euseb. l. 7. e. . He was taken of Sapores, An. Dom. 260. after Calvisius computati∣on. Buntingus hath two yeares lesse. In the time of Probus the Persians sued for peace, and obtained it; he procuring such peace in the East (sayth Vopiseus) that a rebellious Mouse was not heard to peepe. Carus his successor warred against the Persians, and hauing entred their Countrey as farre as Ctesiphon, was slaine with a Thunderbolt (no Romane Emperour, by I know not what secret destinie, from the time of Crassus, passing those parts, without vnfor∣tunate successe.) This was Av. Dom. 283. Diecletian sent Galerius against Narses the Persian, sonne to Varranes, or Varaara∣nes,
the second: (for after Sapores, Hormisda his sonne had raigned a yeare; Varranes the first, three yeres; Varranes the second, sixteene; and a third of that name only foure moneths, as Agathias reckoneth.) But not farre from Carrhae (fatall to the Romanes) Galerius Caesar lost Oros.& Pom:.Laetus, A.D.296 almost all his Armie, and therefore found homely welcome at his returne, Diocletian suffering him to lacquey (in his Purple Robes) some myles after his chariot. Indignation supplying his former defects, he recouered his credit with the o∣uerthrow of the Persians; Narses fled, leauing his wiues, sisters, & children to the Con∣querour. A League was made, with returne of Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria to the Romanes. Misdates the Persian began his raigne An. Dom. 301. To him An. 309. succeeded his sonne Sapores, and raigned (which I thinke was neuer read of any) longer then he liued in view of the world, beginning his raigne before his birth, which he continued three∣score and tenne yeares. For Misdates Agathias, l.4. dying without issue male, and leauing his wife great with child, the Princes consulted with the Magi, whether this future birth would be a male; which they affirmed, obseruing their predictions by a Mare, then readie to foale, and the Princes set on the Crowne, or Royall Ensigne, on the mothers belly, ac∣knowledging him for their King. This Sapores, in a letter to Constantius the Emperor, insituled himselfe King of Kings, partaker of the starres, brother of the Sunne and Moone: he demaunded all that had before belonged to the Persians, to be restored. Betwixt them grew a bloudie warre, as Ammianus relateth. Sapores tooke Singara & Bezabde, An Dom.359. but was repelled into Persia by Constantius. Iulian his successor seeking to sub due the Persian, lost himselfe. The best part of himselfe he had lost before in A∣postasie, which plucked this destruction vpon him, A. 362. It is vncertaine whether di∣uine or humane hand executed this iustice on him. Iovinian was presently saluted Em∣peror, but forced to agree on dishonourable conditions with the Persians, leauing the Rabdicens, Carduens, Rhesens, Zalens, & Nisibis to the Persian dominion. And a little after, in the raigne of Valens, the league was broken by Sapores, who wonne Ctesiphon: Valens intending this warre, was by the Gothes ouerthrowne & burnt aliue, before he could effect any thing, An. 377. When Theodosius raigned, the peace was renewed. After Sapores succeeded Artaxerxes; and after him Sapores, his sonne, both which raigned nine yeares. Then followed Varanes Cermasat eleuen yeres, to whō succeeded A.400.Bunt. Isdigertos, who held peace with the Romans. Procopius writes, That Arcadius the Em∣peror on his death-bed, An. 407. ordained in his last Will, this Isdigertes the Tutor and Protector to his sonne and heire Theodosius, which he faithfully performed. Agathias also acknowledgeth it a currant report. Niceph.Callist.lib.14.cap.18. Maruthas was in credit with this King. He was a Christian Bishop, and by his praiers had cured him of a grieuous sicknesse, which the Magi with their Fierie superstition, and all their labour, could not effect. The Magi conspiring against Maruthas, watched opportunitie, that when the King should come (after the Persian wont) to worship the Fire, a man (whome they had hidden before within the earth for that purpose) cried aloud, That the King should goe forth, as be∣ing accounted of their God impious, who so loued a Christian Bishop. Hereupon the King bethought him of sending him away. But Maruthas suspecting the knauerie, counselled the King to cause the earth to be digged vp; for the Fire, sayth he, cannot speake. The King going into the Chappell or Sanctuarie, & hearing this voice againe, followed Maruthas his counsell, and found out their packing, & punished the authors, allowing Maruthas to build a Church, wheresoeuer he pleased, in Persia. And whiles the Magi yet added to their trecheries, he not onely punished their persons, but distasted their Religion, and purposed to become a Christian, but by death was preuented, which happened An. 421. Varanes, or Vararanes his sonne, followed not his steppes, but both brake league with the Romanes, and persecuted the Christians. Narses his Generall, with his forces, were defeated, Azamaea wasted, Nisibis besieged by the Im∣perials: The Saracens, which aided the Persian, stricken with a strange furie & amaze∣ment, drowned themselues in Euphrates. It is said, a hundred thousand men perished. Theodosius then Emperor knew these things by Palladius Socrat.Hist.Eccles.l.7.c.19. , who in three daies did ride from Constantinople hither, and backe againe in as many, vsing to flee in this manner
to any the remotest parts of the Empire, with such admirable, and almost miraculous expedition, with his celeritie making that spacious Empire seeme but narrow & strait. Varaaranes sent an Armie of those expert souldiors which were among them, for their excellencie called Immortall. but the Roman swords soone proued them mortall. Thus succeeded that warre which he had begun for despight to the Christian Religion and Profession. He was forced to seeke peace, and ended or mitigated his persecution. To him succeeded, An 441. another Izdigerdes, who raigned seuenteene yeres; and after him Perozes, who raigned foure and twentie yeares: after him, his brother Obalas (Bt∣zarus calls him Bleses) ruled foure yeares. Cabades his successor renewed the Warres with the Romans: and no maruell, for he was cruell to his owne people, and warred euen against Nature: for he ordained (as some report) That women should be com∣mon, any wedlock-bands notwithstanding. Whereupon his Nobles conspired against him, depriued and imprisoned him. Blases was enthronized (Scaliger hath Zamaspes) who foure yeares after resigned the State vnto Cabades againe, who hauing before raigned eleuen yeares, added thereto thirtie more. Nicephorus Niceph.Callist: lib.16.c.36. Cedrcnus.Zonar.An.l.3. tells, That he became friend to the Christians, & permitted free libertie of that Religion vpon this occasion. Betweene Persia and India was a Castle, called Tzundadaer, wherein Cabades had heard, that much money and iewels were kept. Cabades vsed all meanes to obtaine it, but in vaine; so strongly was it (as the Storie saith) garded with Deuils. He therefore vsed all the Persian Exorcismes to dispossesse them; and when they preuailed not, he sought to effect it by the Iewes, but with the former successe. At last he made vse of the Christians, who expelled the spirits, and deliuered the Castle vnto him. It is reported, that he slew Zeliobes, King of the Hunnes, for playing on both hands, and comming to helpe him in his warres against the Romans, hauing before sworne to assist the Emperour. About these times were the Maniehees Manes, first author of this Heresie, was flayed aliue, and cast to the dogs. Niceph.lib.6.cap.22. destroyed in Persia, for corrupting his sonne Phatuarsa with their infectious leauen. He therefore slew their chiefe Prelate Indagarus, and many thousand Manichees, all in one day, hauing assem∣bled them with a wile, professing, that he would make that his sonne King. He assem∣bled also the chiefe of the Magi, Glonazes; and Boazanes a Christian Bishop, for the greater solemnitie, with like deuotion as Iehu sacrificed to Baal, with the presence and assistance of Iehonadab, 2. King.10. Calvisius saith, this was done An.Dom. 523. Caba∣des died An. 531. His sonne Cosroes the Great succeeded and raigned eight and fortie yeares. He a∣bout the thirteenth yeare of Iustinians Empire, An. 539. inuaded the Romane domini∣ons, tooke Surus, burnt Berraea, destroyed Antiochia, and with lesse successe besieged Edessa. Agathias preferreth this Cosroes for his great exploits before Cyrus and Xerxes. Yet was his end ignoble, and vnworthie his high spirit. For Mauritius, in the time of Tiberius, entred into the Persian dominions, and burnt some villages neere to the place where Cosroes then was for his recreation, and saw this burning spectacle: wherewith Indignation and Griefe mustering greater multitudes of fearefull, vnquiet, enraged thoughts in his heart, then Mauritius had souldiors in his Armie, vnable to beare such vnwonted sights of hostile flames in his Countries, and such vnwonted fights of in∣ward perturbations, euen greatnesse of spirit made way to Pusillanimitie, and being weakened with colluctation of contrarie passions, a Feauer, taking that occasion and aduantage, apprehends him, and soone after kils him. Some say, his sonne Ormisda raigned seuen yeares with his father. He succeeded and raigned eight yeares; against him Mauritius performed worthie attempts, which made way vnto him for the Romane Empire. And then also he had good successe a∣gainst the Persians, by the valor of Philippicus his Generall: insomuch, that the Persians moued with these & other discontents, by incitement of Varamus, deposed Ormisda, killed his wife and sonne before his eies; which hauing remained to performe vnto him that their last, vncouth, vnnaturall seruice, were presently after put out, and himselfe imprisoned. That Varamus had, a little before, beene sent as Generall against the Romane Armie: which his seruice being found vnseruiceable, and the Romanes preuailing, he was not onely depriued of his place, but, to his further disgrace,
was, by the Kings commaundement, clothed in womans attyre: which indignities he repayed not in words alone (in his letters stiling Ormisda, The Daughter of Chosroes) but with those vnnaturall and disloyall practises: which hee continued also against Cosroes, sonne and heire of Ormisda, forcing him to flee to Mauritius the Emperour for succour. The Turkes are Bizari hist Pers.l.5. said to helpe Varamus in his rebellion; the first warres which we read of atchieued by that Nation: but both he and they receiued discomfiture by Narses the Romane Generall, and sixe thousand were taken and slaine. The Turkes being asked why they helped Varamus answered, That they were forced thereto by famine: they were also marked with a blacke Crosse, which (they said) they learned of the Christians, thereby to expell hunger. Cosroes thus recouered the Kingdome by aide of the Empire. Nicephorus De Chosroe & Mauritio lege Niceph.l.17. & 18. witnesseth, That he was deepely seene in the Chaldaean mysleries, and being by a Romane Gouernour reproued for some excesse, in those times when he so much needed their helpe; he answered, That the times did aduantage him to those reproofes: but know (saith he) that calamities shall also befall the Romanes, and the Babylonian Nation shall rule them three weekes of yeares. After that, in the fifth weeke, the Romanes shall subdue the Persians: Which being come to passe, a day shall come that shall haue no night, and the expected end of the Empire shall be at hand; in which time Corruption shall bee abolished, and men shall liue according to Diuine Ordinance. This, either false or vncertaine Prophecie (according to that Deepenesse of Sathan) he vttered, but what effect answerable hath followed, I know not. This Cosroes raigned nine and thirtie yeares. Hee held peace with the Romanes whiles Mauritius liued; but when Phocas cruelly and treacherously had slaine him, a world of euils at once assaulted the Empire. The Germanes, Gaules, Italians, Hunnes, and Persians, by their Armies afflicted the publike State; and the Roman Bishop then began to aspire to an vniuersall Soueraignetie, which that Murtherer first entitled him vnto. That Armie which was yet redde with the bloud of Mauritius, by the Per∣sians sword was punished, and died in their owne bloud: who hauing ouerthrowne the Romanes in two battailes, possessed Mesopotamia, Syria, Aegypt, Palaestina, and Phoenicia. He entred Ierusalem, slew and captiued many Christians Bizari, l.6. , and carried thence the Crosse. Against the Iberians, Armenians, Cappadocians, Galatians, Paph∣lagonians, euen vnto Chalcedon, hee preuailed. Thus did GOD punish that Mur∣therer, and besides (to pay him in his owne coyne) Priscus, Heraclon, and Hera∣clius conspired against this Conspirer, and murthered the Murtherer, and hauing cut off his Priuities, and his Head, hurled him into the Sea, and destroyed his Issue. Heraclius succeeded, who repressed Cosroes, vnto whose power Carthage, with A∣frica, was now also subiected, which he had inuaded, conducting his Armies through Aegypt. Heraclius sends an Embassage to him, which receiued this answere, That he would neuer lay downe Armes till the Crucified GOD were abolished, and the Persian Mithra worshipped. This encouraged Heraclius, seeing now CHRIST himselfe was a partie; vnder whose banners hee could not but finde happie euents of Warre. Cosroes had slaine in Palaestina fourescore and tenne thousand Christians, and the Iewes also had brought many of them to the slaughter. Heraclius encountred with Ostanes, and slew thirtie thousand Persians. By a stratageme he wonne Sarbatus, a great Commaunder, to his part. In another battaile he had lost the Field, but Thun∣ders and terrible Tempests were sent (as Succenturiatae Copiae) to assist the souldiors of their Lord, and vshered destruction to the Persian Campe, whiles the Romanes killed them, being both blinded with Lightnings, and amazed with inward terrours and outward Tempests. He had before chased Cosroes, and taken Thebarma (a Per∣sian Citie) wherein was a Temple of the Fire, which by fire he consumed. And in the yeare 626, Cosroes now at his wits end, or rather quite beyond them, appointed Me∣darses his sonne to be his successor and heire apparant: wherewith Siroes, his elder
sonne, being discontent; conspired to betray his father and brother to Heraclins: and sonne after caused them both to be slaine at Ctesiphon. Peace was concluded with the Romans, & their prouinces restored. Only Arabia was by Mahumet holden, as a Semina∣ry of a greater mischiefe, vnder which the world with griefe & amazement still groneth. Siroes Adeser, Barazas, & Baram the daughter of Cosroes, in their order of succession in that disordered & turbulent estate, had scarse two yeares allowed to them all: to whom succeeded Ormizda, Iezdegird, who about the yeare sixe hundred threescore and two, was ouerthrowne and slaine by the Saracens: and that Persian kingdome (then weake∣ned by ciuill dissentions) was subdued to Saracenicall seruitude; and that second Persi∣an Dynastie (continued as Scaliger Io.Scalig.Can, Isag. reckoneth in eight and twenty successions, the space of foure hundred and two yeares) had an ende. From thence vnto this time their religion is Saracenicall: their state gouerned, by the Califas, Io, Lampadius Mellific. Hist. part 3. and our third booke sheweth the order in succession of them. and such commanders or Sultans as they placed ouer them, till their Sultans warring with the Califa for soue∣raintie, procured aide from the Turkes: who dispossessed them of their kingdome pre∣sently after they had disburthened them of their enemies: The Turkes were displa∣ced and chased away by the Tartars. Of these both Saracens and Turkes you haue the history in the former booke, and therefore needelesse here to be related: Of the Tartars shall follow in their order. Of those ancient Persian Kings this doth Sardus relate. Sardus l.2.c.. The Persian Kings birth-day, is by all Asia obserued solemne, festiuall to th'immortall Gods: Eunuches haue charge of his body, that he may grow strait and faire: at seuen yeares he is taught to manage horses: at fourteene hee is committed to the Kings masters; the most excellent which can be chosen among the Persians, for wisedome, iustice, temperance, fortitude. These teach him Magike, instituted of Zoroastres, containing Religion of the Gods: and the Kings I awes; to embrace the truth, to bridle his affections; not to bee afraide of any thing. When he taketh possession of the kingdome, hee releaseth the tributes, and in the Temple of the Pasagordan Geddesse he putteth on the garment of Cyrus, whose se∣pulchre is in the towne. He eateth dry Figges, Turpentine, drinketh soure milke, and af∣ter that, water out of Eubaeus, and Choaspes, riuers of Media, Chalybonian Wine out of Syria, Wheate of Assos in Troas; his head annointed with Myrrhe, and couered with a turbant. To sit in his throne (which was of gold sustained of foure pillars beset with ie∣wels) was death to any: at his table sate onely his Mother & wife: and Artaxerxes ad∣mitted his brethren. In the winter hee liued at Susae: in Summer, at Ecbatana: in Au∣tumne, at Persepolis: in the spring, at Babylon. The nobles attend at the gates ready at the Kings command. There stood a Triuet of iron, to which they which are out of his fa∣uour resort expecting their sentence: For he pardoneth none, till hee hath them in his power. When he sleepeth, he is attended by three hundred women dancing by a lampe: at his beds feete are three thousand talents of gold, at the head fiue thousand, ouer the same a Vine of gold, with the clusters of Iewels. In the morning he is wakned with these words: Arise, thinke of those things which Mesoromasdes would haue thee, that is, Zoroastres. He sacrificeth for the Persians, and giueth to each man gifts, because Cyrus had done so at his returne out of Media: and hee receiueth presents from them: in his slore-houses he keepeth of the waters of Nilus, and Ister, as the Lord of all lands. Fire is carried before him. They which meete him, close their hands behinde their backe, and adore him: for which cause some report that the Persians (as also the Aethiopians, Meroites, Indians, Assyrians) hold their Kings in place of Gods. Which diuine adorati∣on Iust. li.6. Conon denied to the King, and Mordeeai to Agag. Est. 3. but in Daniels time they vsurped further: Dan. 6. that none should aske any petition of God, or man, besides. Bart. Keckerman de Monarchia Per∣sarum. Keckerman, as he was admirable in Philosophie, so he was like himselfe in his Aphorismes and Disputations of the Persian Monarchy. Wherein he propoundeth and proueth, that their King was to be well featured & of personable presence without bo∣dily deformitie or defect: learned in their sciences; free from punishment of lawes: they had their delectable gardens which they called Paradises: accustoming thē selues to hun∣ting, and to solemne feasts, especially on their birth-daies, when no suter might be deni∣ed his request. For conseruation of his Maiesly, he was seldome seene: the King sware
by Mithres which is the Sun: was inaugurated at Palargidae (as the later haue vsed at Cafe.) Many other things of excellent note the desirous Reader may there finde. Hero∣dotus sheweth, that the Persians exercised their children to running long races, to en∣dure all hardships of heate, cold, showres, & such like. He Stobaeus ser.42. which was punished with the whip by the Kings command, was to giue thankes to the King for that his remembrance of him. There were officers appointed among the Persians, to see that none were idle: they punished seuerely Xen. . lib.1. Ingratitude, they hated lying, regarded Hospitalitie & courtesie. The lawes did not onely award punishments to the guilty, but rewards also to the well∣deseruing. Whiles the King was drinking, Athen.l. 12. there were women which did sing, one be∣ginning, and the rest following. The Kings vsed to be present in person in their warres. They were very deuout in their religion, offering daily (the Magi being present) a thou∣sand sacrifices, amongst which were Kine, Asles, Harts. But I hold you too long in this discourse. How the Sophian Family, which now ruleth, came to the kingdome, shall after in due place be declared, when we haue first acquainted you with their Ancient superstitions. CHAP. V. Of the Persian Magi, and of their ancient Religion, Rites, and Customes. THE name of Magi is sometimes applied (say some) to all the Persians, Boskhieri Ara Coeli. or else to the particular Nation amongst them: sometime signifyeth the most excellent in Philosophie, and knowledge of Nature, or in sanctity and holines of life. Thus Suidas Suidas in v. Magus. calleth the Persian Magi, Philoso∣phi, and Philothet, studious of knowledge, of Nature, and of God. Sometimes it signified such as we now call Magicians, practisers of wicked Artes. Among the Persians this name was auncient and honourable, saith Peucerus de diuina.c.de Magia. Peucerus, applied onely to the priests, which liued in high reputation for dignitie and authority, being also Philosophers, as the Chaldreans were. To these was committed the custody of Religion, of ancient Monuments, of later Histories, of publike Records, and the explanation of the Persian wisedome, whose account appeareth in the former chapter, whereafter Cambyses death, one of them is reported to succeed in the Throne, Now whereas the Ethnikes had a tradition of two Genij, Brutus was terrified with such a spectrum: the like they tell of Marius and many o∣thers. which attend euery man, one good; the other euill; proceeding (to likelihood) from diuine truth, concerning good and euill Angels, which are either ministring spirits for mans good, or tempters vnto euill: Curious men hence tooke occasion to deuise new Artes, which were called and ; by the one calling vpon the good Daemon or Genius; by the other, on the euill: which euill One could easily turne himselfe into an Angell of light, to delude blinde people, being indeede (as in our White and Blacke witches at this day) vvorse when an Angell, then when a Deuill. Hereof were diuers kindes; Ne Necromancie, which inuocated the spirits of the dead: Of which smoakie Soote, the Heathens Diuine Po∣ets, and our poeticall Diuines in the tales of Hell and Purgatorie, striue who shall haue the blackest tincture. They had also their Lecanomancie, which was obserued in a Ba∣son of water, wherein certaine plates of golde and siluer were put with Iewels, mar∣ked with their iugling Characters, and thence after pronuntiation of their words were ausweres whispered; Cum multis alijs; de uibus Peuce∣rus, & Reginald. Scot. in Detect. Mag. Gastromancie procured answere by pictures, or representations in glasse-vessels of water, after the due rites. Catoptromancie receiued those resem∣blances in cleare glasses: Crystallomancie, in Crystall; Dactyliomancie was a diuina∣tion with Rings (which perhaps Gyges vied) consecrated by certaine positions of the heauens and diuelish enchantments. Onymancie with Oile and Soote daubed on the Naile of an vndefiled child, and held vp against the Sunne: Hydromancy with water: Acromancie with ayre. But what should I adde the many more names of this Artlesse Art, vnworthy the naming? Tibi nomina mille, Mille nocendi artes; Infinitely diuersi∣fied are these blind by-waies of darknes and mischiefe. Leaue wee them in their mazes, circles, Iabyrinths of Errour: and let vs take
view of the Persian Magi, from whence Plinie Plin.l.30.c.1. deriueth the first originalls of Ma∣gicall Vanities; which are (saith hee) compounded of three Arts, that exercise most imperious power ouer the mindes of men; Physicke, and that offering her selfe more sublimate and pure, in the sacred name and rites of Religion, beautified also with the addition of Mathematicall Sciences; (a threefold cord not easily broken, like a three-headed Cerberus, or tripple crowned Prelate, holding the world in feare or loue thereof.) Zoroastres (who liued as Endoxus testifieth sixe thousand yeares before Pla∣to) first inuented it in Persia. Hermippus affirmeth, that Agonax taught him. A∣pusorus and Zaratus among the Medes, Marmaridius the Babylonian, Hippo∣cus the Arabian, and Zarmocenidas the Assyrian, haue beene famous for their practise and writings of this Art. Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, Plato, sailed farre to learne it, vndertaking long exiles, rather then pilgrimages or peregrinations, to that ende. Hee impiously addeth Moses and Iochabell (it may be hee meaneth Ioshua) to this impious number. The Scripture tells of Iannes, and Iambres, and Simon Magus famous in this infamie. It is like that in the Persian Magi concurred both a certaine stocke or kindred, which were all so called (as is said) and the Philo∣sophicall inquisition of Nature, and the Priestly function, and also some either im∣plicite or explicite societie with Deuils. The same they were, at least in profession and reputation, that the Philosophers vvith the Greekes, their Priests in Egypt, Gymnosophistes in India, Chaldaeans in Babylon, Druydes in Gallia, and in this our lsle, the Italian Aruspices, and other religious persons (the Treasurers of their Theologie and Philosophie) in other places. As for those Magi mentioned in the Mat. 2.1. Baskbier Ara Coeli. Gospell, some suppose them to come from Aethiopia; some from Arabia; some from Mesopotamia; some from Chaldaea; and some from Persia; and some from diuers of these Regious. Whencesoeuer they came, they had a brighter Starre to guide them with diuiner light, then those Magicall brands of hellish fire could yeeld. Plato Plato Alci∣biad. commends this Magia, and calls it Machagistia, and saith that the Kings of Persia learned it, as a knowledge of diuine mysteries, wherein by the worlds common∣wealth, they were instructed to gouerne their owne. Others, as they were led by differing affection, doe as much discommend them. And truely (as in the Chaldae∣an and Aegyptian Priests) their searching out the mysteries of Nature can not but de∣serue commendation, but their abusing this naturall Philosophie to vnnaturall con∣spiracie with diuels, cannot but bee detested of those which are not themselues de∣tested of God. And either from this deuilish conspiracie, or ouer-curious vanity, did arise their predictions of future euents: in which respect the Ethnikes had them in high reputation. Ammianus Marcellinus, Am. Marcel. lin.l. 23. saith that Zoroastres added much to this Art from the Chaldaean mysteries, and Hystaspes, the father of Darms, from the Brachmanes, which he in his Indian trauels had found in a woodie solitarinesse, and learned of them the motions of the Scarres, and pure rites of sacrifices: which he taught the Magi, and they, together with the skil of diuination, deliuered to their posteritie by tradition: and that progeny is alway consecrated to diuine seruices, and keepe continually burning certaine fire which first came from heauen; a small portion where∣of was wont to bee carried before the Kings of Asia. There were but a few of them at the first: and it was vnlawfull to touch the sacrifice, or approach to the Altar, be∣fore the Magus with a certaine set speech had powred on his sacred preparatiue liquors. Afterwards beeing increased in number, they grew into an entire Nation, and inhabited vnwalled townes, beeing gouerned by their owne lawes, and honoured for religion. That which hee telleth of the Chaldaean, and Indian originall of their Science, Proueth it to bee such as vsed vnlawfull prognosticatings, which the Scripture af∣firmeth of the Chaldaeans, and Philostratus Philostratus de vita Apollony. of the Indians, whose Historie of Apollonius (a Pythagorean) sheweth, that hee was not little infected vvith this va∣nitie, trauelling as Pythagoras had done to learne the same in forreine Regi∣ons. And although some commend one sort of Magia, as being their Theologie and
Philosophie, yet seeing their Philosophie was corrupted with curiositie, and their Theologie with superstitious Idolatrie, it could not bee free from some kinde of im∣plicite forcerie, as the examples of those Apollonius, Hosthanes, Cha∣vondas, Demo∣critus, & Pytha∣gorici & Pla∣tonici. which were most eminent herein, doe shew. Such an one Pases was, who by enchantments would make shewes and resem∣blances of sumptuous feasts, with many attendants: and had a Magicall Suidas hence came the Prouerbe. or enchanted halfe-penny, which would returne to him againe, when he had bought any thing ther∣with. The Magi had one chiefe amongst them in their Societie, called by Sozomene, Sozom.l.2.c.9 Priu∣ceps magorum. Cicero Cicero de diuinat.l.1. affirmeth that none might be Kings in Persia, before they had learned the discipline of the Magi; neither was it any more lawfull for euery one to be a Magus, then to be a King: Such was their estimation in Persia. Strabo Strabo l. 15. Nam Magus ex matre & gnato gignatur oportet (saith Catullus) Sivera eft Per∣sarum impiare∣ligio. tells that they vsed carnall company with their mothers: and when they are dead are cast forth vnburied, to bee a prey to the Birds. The Ostanoe, and Astrampsychi are by Suidas reckoned successours of the Magi. One Gramay Per sica. Sect of them liued onely on meale and Hearbes. Pausanias Pausan.l 6. reporteth that in Lydia, in the Cities Hierocesarea, and Hypaepo, hee saw Temples hauing Persian surnames, and in euery of those Tem∣ples, Chappell and Altar, whereon was Ashes not like in colour to the ordinarie sort. The Magus entering into the roome, layeth drie wood on the Altar, after that hee hath set his mitre on his head, and then at the name of a certaine God, singeth barbarous hymnes (which the Greekes vnderstand not) out of the booke: which being done, the heape is fired, and the flame breakes forth. Diogenes Laer∣tius Diog.Lart.de vit.Philos.l.1. relateth, that these Magi spent their time in the seruice of their Gods, offe∣ring vnto them prayers and sacrifices, as if none but they might be heard: they disputed of the substance and generation of the Gods, whom they reckoned to be the Fire, Water, and Earth. They reprehended Images, especially such as made a differing sexe of Male, and Female, among the Gods. They discoursed of iustice. To burne their dead bodies, they held it impious: but to lie with their owne mothers, or daughters, they accounted lawfull. They practised diuinations, and fore-tellings, affirming that the Gods appeared to them, that the ayre was full of formes or shapes, which subtilly and as it were by euaporation, infuse themselues into the eyes. They forbade out∣ward ornaments, and the vse of Golde. Their garments were white, the ground their bed, Hearbs, Cheese, and bread their foode. Aristotle saith, that they helde two beginnings, a good spirit and an euill, calling the one Iupiter and Oromasdes: the other Pluto and Arimanius (Empedocles Empedocles. translated this plant into Philosophie, and long af∣ter, Manes father of the Mani∣chees. Manes a Persian herelike into diuinitie.) Theopompus addeth these opinions of theirs; That men should againe be restored to life, & become immortall, and that all things consisted by their prayers; Hecateus, that the Gods were begotten: Clearchus, that the Gynmosophista descended from the Magi. Thus farre Diogenes. Plutarch Plut. de Osir. & Is. in his Treatise de Osir. and Isid. citeth, approueth and applyeth the opini∣on of the Magi vnto many others, which they conceiued touching their two begin∣nings, Arimanius and Orimazes: For whereas they saw such a mixture of euill in euerie good (which made Solomon to brand them all with the title of vanity) they gathering that good could not be either cause or effect of euil, found out this remedy worse thē the disease, to hold two Authors of all things, calling Orimazes a God; and Arimanius, the fountaine of euill, a diuell; the one cause of light: the other of darknes. Betwixt these two they placed Mithres as Mediator or Intercessor. Zoroastres was author of this opi∣nion. To the first of these was praise and vowes offered: to the later mournefull deuoti∣ons. For, rubbing a certaine hearbe called Omomi, they call on Dis Pater & Orcus, then they wash it with the bloud of slain Wolfe, & carry it into a shadowy place, where they powre it out. They assigne plants partly to the good, partly to the bad God: as they doe also quick creatures; the earthly creatures to the good, the watery to the bad, and therefore esteeme him happy that hath killed most of them. Oromazes, say they, be∣gotten of pure light, and Arimanius the child of darknes, warre one against another. The first created sixe Gods, Beneuolence, Truth, Politie, Wisedome, Riches, Honest de∣light: the later as many contrary. When Oromazes had thrice enlarged himselfe, hee
was as farre beyond the sunne, as the sunne is from the earth, and formed the starres: Of which, one he fixed as a Gardiau and watchman, the dog-starre: hee made other foure and twenty Gods, which he closed in an Egge. Arimanius did as much, but his foure and twenty brake their shell. And so became good things and euill mingled. But a fatall time shall come, when Arimanius the Author of plague and samine shall perish, and then shall bee one societie of all mankinde in happinesse, vsing but one language. Theopompus saith, according to their opinion, that one of these Gods shall raigne three thousand yeares, the other being discomfited; and other three thousand they shall fight and labour to destroy one another: at last Dis Pater shall be destroied, and men shall be happy. This opinion of the Magi, the Chaldeans haue applied to their Astronomie; in the seuen Planets, making two good, two bad, three indifferent: The Graecians, to their Iupiter, Dis Pater & Harmonia: Empedocles to his Friendship and Discord: Aristotle to his Forma & Priuatio. Pythagoras to his One and Two: Plato to his Idem and Alterum: Manes to his deuilish haeresie, as before is said. Onely Persians, saith Gramay Asia Gramay, were chosen into their number. The name Magi, is among Authors applyed also to the Chaldaeans, which in Babylon professed the same arts and superstitions; the disciples (saith Luciani Necrom. Lucian) of Zoroastres, of whose cunning in charmes you may reade in his Necromantia, a pleasant discourse: Mithrobarzanes a Chaldaean Magus. and Menippus, whom he washeth nine and twenty daies in Euphra∣tes by the Moone, and in the morning sets him against the rising Sunne, with long charmes: after that spitting three times in his face, he brings him backe againe not once looking aside. Their meate was Acornes, their drinke Milke, Mulse, and the water of Choaspi, their lodging on the wide field on the grasse. After all this hee brought him about midnight to Tygris, where washing him, he purifieth him with a Torch, and the hearbe squilla, and other things, &c. which howsoeuer Lucian suteth to his scoffing, yet I haue inserted, as somewhat expressing their superstitions obserued in charming and diuinations. Leauing these Magi, let vs take view of the Persian religious rites which Herodotus. Lib.1. Herodotus thus describeth. The Persians neither erect Images, nor Altars, nor Temples, and im∣pute it to madnesse in such as doe: therefore as I thinke, because they are not of the Greekes opinion, that the Gods haue arisen from men. Their custome is, ascending vp the highest hilles to offer sacrifices to Iupiter, calling the whole circle of heauen Iupi∣ter. They sacrifice to the Sunne, and Moone, and Earth, to the Fire, and Water, and Windes: to these onely haue they accustomed to sacrifice from the beginning. They sacrifice also to Vrania, which they haue learned of the Assyrians, and Ara∣bians. The Assyrians call Venus, Mylitta; the Arabians, Alitta; the Persians, Metra. Their rites in sacrificing are these. Being to sacrifice, they neither set vp Altar, nor kindle fire, nor vse vestments, pipes, cakes, or libaments: but hee which intendeth to sacrifice, placing the sacrifice in a cleane place, calleth vpon that God, wearing their Tiara The attire of the head, among the Persians, as the Turbant amōg the Turkes. girded about with myrtle. The sacrificer prayeth not for himselfe alone, but generally for all Persians, and especially for the King. And after that the sacrifice is cut into small peeces, he streweth vnder the sodden flesh, small hearbes, chiefely trifoly; and setting the flesh in order thereon, the Magus standing by singeth Theoga. some hymnes (of the generation of the Gods) which they hold to be a most effectuall inchantment. Without one of their Magi no sacrifice is accounted lawfull. After all this, the sacrificer vseth the flesh at his pleasure. Of all daies euery man accounteth his owne birth-day to bee most solemnely obser∣ued: and then maketh greatest cheere. The richer sort then set whole Beeues, Camels, Horses, Asses, baked in an Ouen or fornace, on the Table: the poorer, smaller beastes. The Persians are small eaters: but in their drinking consult of the weightiest af∣faires. Of which they deliberate fasting, but pronounce sentence after they are well in drinke. To vomit or make water openly, is vnlawfull to them. Those that are aequall, salute vvhen they meete each other vvith a mutuall kisse; which is fastened on the cheeke onely, if they bee of vnequall degree. They holde
themselues the best of all men, their neighbours so much better, how much neerer them they dwell. They are much addicted to Venery with both sexes. Next vnto Mar∣tiall valour, they repute excellent the procreation of many Children; the King allow∣ing annuall presents to him who hath begotten most Children, & therefore they vse many women. The child commeth not in his fathers sight till he be fiue yeares old, but liueth with the women, that if hee die before, his father should thence conceiue no greefe. From that time till he be twenty, he learneth three things, to ride, to shoote, to speake truth. For to lie is with them the most shamefull thing; the second, to be in debt. For one fault onely no man ought to be punished. Whatsoeuer is not meere to bee done, ought not to be spoken. A Leprous person if he be a Citizen may not en∣ter into the Citie, nor haue any societie with men: for this disease is sent (say they) for some offence against the Sunne: if hee bee a forrenner, they banish him out of their Region, and for the same cause carrie into that Region white Pigeons. In a Ri∣uer they neither spit, nor make water, nor wash, but haue them in very religious ve∣neration. These things, saith Herodotus, I can affirme of the Persians out of mine owne knowledge: that which followeth I doe not so well know; that they bury not their dead bodies before they be torne of some fowle, or dogge: but I well know that their Magi doe wrap them vp in waxe and then bury them. These Magi differ both from other men, and from the Aegyptian Priests in this, that these pollute themselues with the death of nothing but their sacrifices, but the Magi with their owne hands kill any thing: except a man and a dogge: yea, they esteeme it some great exploit if they haue killed verie many Ants or Serpents, or other things which creepe or flye. Thus farre Herodotus. Strabo Libr.11. nameth Anaitis, Amanus, and Anandatus, Gods of the Persi∣ans: When the Persian Emperours had ouerthrowne the These Goro∣pius with Dutch Ety∣mologies, and interpretati∣ons bringeth from the Cim∣merians and Saxons. See his Saxonica.p.606. Sacae, they encompassed with a wall a certaine rocke situate in a field. and erecting a Temple of the foresaid Gods, there instituted yearly solemnities, named Saca, which of the inhabitants of Zela are yet celebrated, (so they call the place.) That towne in great part belongeth to them which are called Sacred seruants, to which Pompey added a great countrey. Some report that Cyrus, hauing ouercome the Sacae, attributing this victory to diuine power, consecrated that day to his countrey-Goddesse, naming is Sacaea, and wheresoeuer the Temple of that Goddesse is, there also are celebrated those Sacaean feasts, in manner of the Bac∣chanals, day and night, the men and women drinking themselues drunken. Strabo in the end of the same eleuenth booke mentioneth their Temples, and amongst others the Temples of Tanais, which before in Herodotus is denied to be the vse of the Persians: Stra.l.15. Cicero blameth the Magi, for procuring Xerxes to burne all the Temples of Greece, because they included their Gods in walles, and to whom the whole world was a Tem∣ple and house. Cic.de leg.l.2. Strabo thus reporteth of the Persians: The Persians haue neither Ima∣ges nor Altars: they sacrifice in a high place, they thinke heauen to be Iupiter: they wor∣ship the Sunne, whom they call Mithra, the Moone also and Venus, and the Fire, and the Earth, and the Windes, and the Water: they sacrifice in a cleane place, and present their sacrifice crowned: & whē as Magus, the ruler of this busines, hath diuided the flesh in peeces to euery one, they goe their waies leauing no part thereof to the Gods, who (say they) are satisfied with the soule of their sacrifice. Some, as it is reported, lay a part of the Numbles on the fire. They sacrifice especially to the Fire, and to the Wa∣ter, laying on the fire drye stickes, the barkes pulled off, and laying thereon fat Tal∣low, and pouring on the same, Oyle, they kindle the same, not blowing with their breath, but fanning or otherwise enforcing the winde thereto. If any bloweth the fire, or cast any dead thing or durt therein, hee is punished with death. They per∣forme their Water-ceremonies in this sort: Comming to a Lake, or Riuer, or Foun∣taine, they make a ditch, and there slay a sacrifice, with great heede that none of the next water bee touched with the bloud: after, laying the flesh on myrtle and Lawrell, the Magi burne the same with small twigges, and making certaine pray∣ers, sprinkle oyle mixed with Milke and Honie, not in the fire or water, but on the earth. They are a long while muttering their prayers, holding a bundle of small Tamariske∣twigges.
In Cappadocia, where is very great store of the Magi, which (of the Fire) are cal∣led Pyrethi, and many Temples of the Persian Gods, they slay not the Sacrifice with a knife, but a Clubbe or Mallet, wherewith they beate it. The Pyretheia are great in∣closed places, in the middest whereof there is an Altar: Thereon the Magi keep much ashes, and a fire continually burning, whither they euery day resort, & make their prai∣ers about an houres space, holding a bundle of twigges before the fire, hauing their heads couered with a kind of labelled Mitre, hanging downe on both sides, that the strings couer their lippes. These things are done in the Temples of Anaitis and Ama∣nus. For there are their Temples, and there the Image of Amanus is carried in proces∣sion. These things we haue seene. It seemeth, that whereas Herodotus reporteth they had no Temples, Altars, nor Images: and Strabo so often mentioneth their Temples, and heere the Altar and Image of Amanus; that in Herodotus dayes they had none: which grew afterwards in vse, as a forreine rite brought in amongst the Persians after the Macedonians had conquered them; or else that there were differing Sects among their Magi, some (as these in Cappadocia) embracing Altars, Images, and Temples, some refusing some or all of these. For otherwise Strabo disagreeth not only from He∣rodotus, but from himselfe, before denying them the vse of Altars and Images, and here affirming it of the Cappadocian Magi (in other things) of the Persian Religion. We may further adde (from Gramay Gram. As. Persica. his Collections out of diuers Authors, and from others, concerning the Persian Religion) that they sometime obserued the Grae∣cian Deities, calling Iupiter, Bel; Hercules, Sandes; Venus, Anaitis. To Iupiter was sa∣cred a Charriot with a Beame of gold. The Sunne they worshipped (by the name of Mithra, and Eldictus) at Sunne-rising: and adored also the painted Image thereof. They accounted the horse the Sunnes peculiar beast, and offered vnto him white hor∣ses: and with white horses his sacred Chariot was drawne before the King, when hee sacrificed. Ouer Q Curt.lib.3. Darius his tabernacle, the Image of the Sunne, enclosed in Cristall, shone forth so that it might be seene of all. The order also of Darius his march, when he warred against Alexander, had in the first place their Fire, which they called Sacred and Eternall, carried on siluer Altars. Next hereunto the Magi, singing their Coun∣trey-Hymnes, followed by three hundred sixtie and fiue yong-men, (so many as their yeare had dayes) clothed in bright red. Then came Iupiters Chariot, drawne by white horses: after whom followed a horse, of exceeding greatnesse, consecrated to the Sunne. Their Riders had white garments, and golden Roddes. Likewise, both sides of the Kings Chariot were adorned with Images of gold and siluer: two being most eminent among them; the one, of Peace, the other, of Warre. That souldiour, which was initiated in Mithra's hallowed orders, was first proued by foure-score seuerall kindes of punishment: and if hee continued stedfast, hee was washed, putting on his head a Tertul de Ce∣ron.mil.t. Crowne with a Sword interposed. Chast virgins were hallowed the Sunnes Priests. They worshipped Diana whom they called Nannea, (as some will haue it) in that history of 2.Mac.1.13 Antiochus. They solemnized certaine feasts, the chiefe whereof was that of Mithra. Another holy-day they called the Destruction Athenaeus l.12 of vices, in which the Magi killed venemous things, and offered; and the seruants lorded it fiue dayes together, ruling both the family and their maisters. Their Kings birth-daies they did also solemnize, making therein a banquet called Lycta: at which time the King might not deny any thing to any sinter. Magophonia they celebrated in memory of the Magi slaine by Darius Histaspis, and his Colleagues. Of their holie∣day Saca before is spoken: in which (some report, that) the seruants changed offices and garments with their Maisters. Minutius Foelix Min. Foel. O∣ctau. Arnob.con.Gent.lib.6. obiecteth against them their in∣cestuous copulation with their mothers. Arnobius derideth their worshipping of Ri∣uers. The Christian Fathers and heathen Authors are plentifull in the narration of the Persian vanities. Eusebius Euseb. de praepar.lib.6.c.8. citeth a saying of Bardesanes Syrus; Among the Persians there was a Lawe to marry their sisters, daughters, and mothers: which custome the Persians obserued also in other Countries, & therefore other nations hating them, cal∣led them Magussi; of which are many in Egypt, Phrygia, and Galatia, whose poste∣rity succeedeth them in the same wickednes. This name Magussoei is deriued of Magi.
CHAP. VI. Of the alterations of the State and Religion in Persia, vnder the Saracens. THe Saracens (as is already shewed) a people bred, as it were, of putri∣faction in that corrupt estate of the World, dispossessed of his stato and life Ormisdas the last Persian King. Their Religion had sustained small alteration in Persia before this time, for aught I finde, sauing what the Christian had in these parts preuailed, (which belongeth to another taske.) But from that time that the Saracens were Conquerours, the soules of the Persians haue no lesse beene subiect to those foolish Mahumetan superstitions then their bodies to cruell slauerie: yea the Curio Sara. histor.lib. 1. Blon∣dus saith, that Mahumet was present at their first conquest, and that by his command they relinqushed their name, & accepted the Saracen. dec. 1. libr.9. name of Persian was drowned in the ti∣tle of Saracens. Homar was then Caliph. But when Iezid the sonne of Muavi was Priest and King (such are the Caliphs) of the Saracens, Mutar, the Deputy or Go∣uernour of Persia, proclaimed himselfe a Prophet, and seised on the state: from him the Persian Sophi deriueth his originall. When Iezid was dead, the Inhabitants of Cufa in Arabia proclaimed Hocem the sonne of Ali, Caliph: but Abdalam the sonne of Iezid intrapped and slew him: and at his Sepulchre was after erected the city Car∣bala. This Hocem had twelue sonnes, Zeinal, Abadin, Zeinal Muamed, Bagner Mu∣amed, Giafar Cadeneg, Ciafar Musa, Cazin Musa, Hali Macerat, Alle Muamed Ta∣guin, Muamed Halmaguin, Alle Hacem Asquerin, Hacem Muamed Mahadin: This last Barr. As.dec.2.lib.10.c.6. the Persians say that he is not yet dead, but that he shall come sitting on a horse, to preach their Law to all Nations: beginning in Massadalle where Ali his grandfa∣ther lieth buried. And therfore they haue there alway a horse prepared ready, which in time of Diuine Seruice, on a certaine festiuall day, they bring with Lights burning to the Temple in which Ali is buried, praying him to send his nephew quickely. That day is solemnely celebrated with so great concourse of people, as a Portugall there present said hee had neuer seene the like. The other eleuen brethren were buried in diuers places. To returne to Mutar; Abdimelec one of the following Calipha's, sent Ciafa against him, by whose ouerthrow that new Prophet wanne new and greater estimation then before. But an other tyrant, Abdala Zubir, arising amongst the Sara∣cens, sent his brother Musub against Mutar, who slew Mutar, and was soone after slaine himselfe of Abdimelec, who recouered againe that Prouince of Persia. Abdi∣melec being dead, in the yeare seuen hundred and two and twenty, Gizid his sonne Curio Sarac. hist.lib.2. succeeded, and an other Gizid vsurped the Scepter in Persia, but was ouerthrowne by Masabner the Captaine of Abdimelecs sonne. In the reigne of Marvan, Asmulin tooke on him the protection of Mutars Sect, af∣firming Ali to be greater then Mahumet: he was Prince of the Corasens in Persia, and by one Catabanus his counsell incited the seruants, by force or treachery, to kill their Masters: and these being growne great by their Maisters wealth were diuided into two factions, the Caisms, and the Lamonites. Asmulin Captaine of the Lamo∣nites destroyed the Caismi: and with his Lamonites, and Catabanus, inuaded Per∣sia, and were there incountred by Iblinus the Lieutenant with an armie of an hun∣dred thousand men; but the Lamonites by the incouragement of Asmulin and Cata∣banus (whom they reckoned holy men) discomfited him and his; and after incoun∣tred Marvan himselfe with three hundred thousand men, and made him to flee with foure thousand into Aegypt, where Salin the sonne of Asmulin ouerthrew him. Thus the Maruanian race being expelled (the reliques whereof setled themselues in Fesse and Spaine) Asmulin, from whom the family of the Sophi descendeth, with Cataba∣nus reigned ouer the Saracens. By this which hath bin said, appeareth a continual difference betwixt the Persians,
and other Saracens about their Religion; eyther (as some affirme) for that the Persi∣ans preferred Ali to Mahumet, or for that (which is more likely) they accounted Ali, and not any of the other three (Eubocar, Osmen, or Homar) to be the true successour of Mahumet. The Sultans or Deputies of Persia, which gouerned there vnder the Chaliph, vsed that their schismaticall fancie, as they sawe occasion to their owne am∣bitious designes, vnder colour of Religion. Among the rest Muamet or Mahumet is famous, who being hardly beset for the like cause by his Maister, the Chaliph of Bagadet, required aide, (as before is more largely shewed) Libr.3.ca.8 of the Turkish Nation then wandering in part of Armenia, called of them Turcomania, who sent him for his succour three thousand Turkes vnder the leading of Tangrolipix, by whose helpe Pisasiris the Califa was ouerthrowne. And after this hee obtained both the Sultan∣ship of Persia, in the yeare of our LORD, 1030. and also slew Pisasiris, and enioy∣ed that soueraignty: Knolies. from thenceforth the Califa's of Bagadet being stripped of their temporalls, but retayning still the places of Patriarchs of their Religion (as some re∣late) euen to this day. The Turkes thus possessing the Persian royalty, and possessed of the Persian superstitions, there reigned one hundred and seuentie yeares, the Tar∣tars then chasing them out of Persia. For after Haithon de Tartar. that Changis Can had founded that Empire, Hocota, or Occoda Can his successour sent out his sonnes diuers wayes with diuers armies with intent to subdue the world, Iochi conquered Turquestan and Per∣sia: and not long after Mango Can sent Haolon his brother, who continued and prosecuted the Tartarian Conquests beyond Phison or Tigris, subdewing the whole kingdome of the Persians, taking Baldach, with the great Chalifa, whom he starued amiddest his treasure; beleagered a Castle of the Assassini, with a siege of seuen and twenty yeares, and then taking the same by composition of the defendants, only for want of clothing: he wanne Aleppo, and the kingdome of Syria, with Damascus the head City thereof: and had intended also the Conquest of the Holy Land from the Sa∣racens, if he had liued; for both this Haolon & Mango the great Can were both Chri∣stians by perswasion of Aiton the Armenian King. About this time in the North-East parts of Persia (which of this new heresie they called Mulehet) there was an old man, named Aloadin, a Mahumetan (as all those parts then were) which had inclosed a goodly Aloadins Pa∣radise, valley situate betweene two hilles, and furnished it with all variety, which Nature and Art could yeeld, as fruits, pictures, rilles of milke, wine, hony, water, pallaces, and beautifull damosells richly attired, and called it Paradise. To which was no passage, but by an impregnable Castle. And dai∣ly preaching the pleasures of this Paradise to the youths, which he kept in his Court, sometimes would minister a sleepy drinke to some of them, and then conueigh them thither: where being intertained with these pleasures foure or fiue dayes, they suppo∣sed A right fooles Paradise. themselues rapt into Paradise. And then being againe cast into a trance by the said drinke, he caused them to be carried forth; & then would examine them of what they had scene, and by this delusion would make them resolute for any enterprise, which he should appoint them; as to murther any Prince, his enemy. For they feared not death, in hope of their Mahumeticall Paradise. But this M. Paul. & Odor. Haolon or Vlan after three yeares siege, destroyed him, and this his Fooles Paradise. Some tell Cartwright. this of A∣ladeules in the time of Zelim the first. Abaga succeeded him in the gouernment of these parts, anno 1264, but not in the Christian religion: Tangodor the next, became a Sara∣cen, and called himselfe Mahomet, and at Tauris and other places destroyed the Churches of the Christians, as Haolon had done of the Saracens: hee banished the Christians, and peruerted as many Tartars as he could to Mahumetisme. But Argo∣nus the sonne of Ahaga rebelled, and taking him, cut him asunder in the middle, suc∣ceeding in his place, anno 1285. after him Regayto whom the Tartars slew, placing in his steed Baydo a christian, who forbad the preaching of Mahumetism among the Tar∣tars, and reedified the Churches of the Christians: Casan succeeded in his dominion & deuotion: and after his death Carbaganda, who in his childehood had been baptized, and named Nicholas, but when his Christian mother was dead, he became a Saracen. Thus farre out of Haithonus; in which history appeareth the vicissitude of diuers Re∣ligions,
sometime Tartarian, sometime Christian, sometime Mahumetan, as in the Princes who gouerned these Countries vnder the great Cham or Can of the Tartars: so also no doubt in a great part of the Countries themselues, which vsually are of the Kings religion. This Carbaganda, reigning about 1305, is the last Tartar Prince which ruled in these parts; for as their religion, so also their Empire failed; the Aegyptian Soldans preuayling in Syria; the Ottoman Turkes, in Asia; and Gempsas, in Persia. This Gempsas was Soldan of the Parthians: and about the yeare 1350. restored that Persian kingdome to the Parthians. From him descended the Peucerus lib.4. 5. Persian Kings to Ma∣laonchres, who being taken away by fraud, Vsun Cassan succeeded. Yet was not the Persian state so settled in Gempsa his posteritie, but that Great Tamerlane subdewed the same vnto himselfe, which his sonne after lost againe. This Tamerlane some re∣port to haue bin of meane parentage; others, of royall descent, and Michouius, libr.1. cap.8. deriueth him from Baths, one of the greatest Conquerors among the Tartars. Vsuncassan (called also Assymbe) depriued the Sultan of Parthia and Persia of his life and kingdome: his name is by some Malaonchres; by others, De: but Ambrosio Contarini, & Iosapha Barbaro (which both were in Persia with Vsuncassan) cal him Iau∣sa. In the yeare 1478. died Vsuncassan; and his sonne lacob succeeded, whose wife, bearing dishonest affection to one of the court, sought by the murther of her husband to aduance this Courtier to her husbands bed and empire. And Viaggio di mercante apud Ramus. hauing conueighed venime into a golden Cup presents her husband the same to drinke, who somewhat suspecting her, caused her to beginne; himselfe and his sonne following her both in drinking and dying. And thus was Persia, by the wickednesse of one woman, made the stage of ciuill warres, whiles the chiefe Nobles sought each to possesse himselfe of the state, which at last, after fiue or six yeares warre befell to Alumut or Elvan-beg, then being but foureteene yeares old, who was slaine by Ismael in the yeare 1499. The history of Ismael, because it giueth much light both into the state and religion of Persia, is more fully to be reported. When as Mustacen Mumbila the Chaliph of Bagdet had beene by the Tartars done to death, in the yeare after Haithonus account 1258 (about the yere 1369) there arose in Persia I.P.B.par.2 l.2 Osor ere. Em. libr. . Surius Comment. Knolles T.histor. pag 464. a noble man called Sophi, lord of the City Ardouil, reporting himselfe to be of the bloud of Alle or Hali, descended from Musa Cazin, or Cersin one of the twelue sonnes, (as is said) of Hocem. Guinue his sonne (otherwise written, Ginni, Guine, and Giunet) maintained his Sect after him. Minadoi Minidoi lib. 2 saith, That Sexehiuni, or more distinctly, Serec Ginnet, was Au∣thor of the Persian sect, who vnder the name of Sofi is by Mi∣nadoi deriued of Sofiti, a peo∣ple subdewed by Alexander. Sofi, and of Siec, (that is, of a wise man, and an Author of Religion) or rather vnder the pretence of holines, beganne to perswade the people, that the 3 first successors of Mahomet were vsurpers, onely Ali ought to be named lawfull successor, and ought to be called vpon in their prayers, and by all means to be honored. From this time forward the Sepulchre of Ali and his sons in Cafe grew in great credit, and was visited euery yeare after the same sort that the Turkes visit the Sepulchre of the other three: and the Kings of Persia vsed there to be crowned, and girt with their sword, and their great Calife there kept his residence. Because this Cafe was neare Babylon, hence grew the common errour, that these things were done at Babylon or Bagdet. Ionius also is deceiued, where hee maketh Arduelle or Aidere, author of the Persian faction. This Persian superstition was brought in by Giunet the Sofi, afterward maintained by Siec Sederdin, and after him by Siec Ginnet the second, then by Siec Aider called by Ionius, Arduelle, and at last encrea∣sed and enlarged by Ismael and his successors. Ismael renewed or continued the name Sofi or Sofiti: but his successors leauing that, and the name of Siec, haue retained one∣ly the title of Saha, which some write Shaugh, some Xa, a royall title communica∣ted by the head of this superstition to those Kings which participate with them there∣in. Ioseph Scaliger Scal.Can.I∣sag.libr.3. saith, that Sa or Seha is the same with Monsieur among the French, and Don among the Spaniards. The Iewes and Arabians write it : It is sometimes set before the name, as in the present King Scha Habas; sometime comes after, as Me∣lixa for Melic-scha. Barrius Io.Bar.Asia.dec.2.li.10.c.6. beginnes this pedegre at the father of Giunet, or Guine (so he calls him) and not as Minadoi, with Guinet himselfe. He addeth, That for the
Ensigne, Character, or Cognisance of his Sect, he ordained, that in the midst of their Turbant, (which they weare with many folds) there should arise a sharp top, in maner of a Pyrainis, diuided into twelue parts; (in remembrance of Ali his twelue sons) from the top to the bottome. They vsed the colour red on their heads (saith Minadoi) by or∣dinance of Arduelle, and therefore were called Cheselbas, that is, Red-heads, some write it Cuselbas. Guine (as Barrius affirmeth) was holden in such reputation of holines by Tamerlane, that he came to visit him as a Saint; and at his request, set free 30000. slaues, which he had taken in the warres against Baiazet. These slaues became his dis∣ciples first, and after souldiers to his sonne Aidar against the Christian Georgians. This Surius Com. Knoll.T.Hist. pag.464. Aidar Erdebil (or after Ivius, Harduelles,) forsaking (as some say) the world, led a streight life in continencie and austerity, and was therefore admired as a Prophet, and resorted to out of all parts of Armenia and Persia comming to Tauris to see him: He inueighed against the common opinion concerning Mahomets successors, as Guin∣ne and Sophi had done, shutting vp heauen to all, sauing Hali his followers. For so the Persians vse to say in their praiers; Cursed be Ebubeker, Omar, and Osman: God be fa∣vorable to Hali, & wel pleased with him. Vsuncassan moued with his fame, gaue him in marriage his daughter Martha begot of the Christian Lady Despina, daughter of Calo Ioannes emperor of Trapezoned; both of them by this alliance strengthning themselues against the Turke. Aider had by this Marha, Ismael, whom shee trained vp in the principles of Christian Religion. Iacob, successor of Vsuncassan, iealous of the multitude of Aiders disciples, and the greatnes of his fame, caused him to be secretly murthered; persecuting all his professed followers with fire and sword. Ismael then a child fled in∣to Hircania to one Pyrchales, a friend of his fathers, who afterwards ayded him to the recouering of his patrimony. Boterus saith, That Iacob, after the murther of Ai∣dar, committed his two sonnes, Ismael and Solyman, to Amanzar (a Captaine of his) to be conueighed to Zalga, a strong mountainy place: but he brought them vp liberally with his owne children, and in his last sickenes, gaue them horse and two hundred du∣cats, with aduise to repaire to their mother; where taking vpon him the protection of the sect of Hali, & the reuenge of his fathers death, his enterprises succeeded prospe∣rously. Cap.11. Gionan Maria Angiolello saith, That Iacob being poysoned 1485, the seig∣niorie was possessed by a kinsman of Iacobs called Iulauer, after whose . yeares reigne succeeded Baysingir two yeres; after, Rutan seuen yeres, who sent Solimanbec against Sechaidar the father of Ismael, who made challenge to the state in right of his wife the daughter of Vsuncassan, who slew him in the field. Rustan would also haue killed the mother and her sons, had not intreaty of his nobles preuented it. He committed them to warde in the Iland of the Armenians in the lake Astumar; whither the sent for them againe after three yeares, but they for feare fled to Ardovill, and there liued closely for a time. Rustan was slaine by Agmat through his mothers procurement, who loued that Agmat, who abode Sultan fiue months, and was slaine by Rustans souldiors. And Alvan the kinsman of Vsuncassan was Seignior, whom Ismael slew. A certaine Merchant who abode a long time in Tauris, and trauelled through the most part of Persia (skilfull of the Turkish, Persian, and Arabian languages, either see∣ing himselfe, or learning of them which did see) in the time of Ismael, relates this Hi∣story somwhat otherwise, Ramusius: whom, as learning of the Persians themselues the Persian af∣faires, we may reckon worthy to be followed, saith, That this Sechaidar in Ardovil was the head of this Sophian Sect, and had three sons and three daughters by the daugh∣ter of Vsuncassan. He was a zealous enemy against the Christians, oftentimes with his followers repairing into Circassia, doing the people much damage, which when in the daies of Sultan Alumut he attempted as before times, he was by Alumuts order forbid∣den at Darbent further passage: but seeking to make way by force, he was by the for∣ces of Alumut taken, and his head, on the toppe of a launce, presented to Alumut, and by his commaund, giuen to the dogges to be eaten; the cause why the Sophians are such enemies vnto dogs, killing all they finde. This newes comming to Ardouill, his three sons fled, one into Natolia, another to Aleppo, Ismael the third to an Iland in the lake of Van, in which is a city of Christian Armenians, where he abode foure yeares in
the house of an Armenian priest, being then about thirteene yeares old, who vsed him curteously, and instructed him in the rudiments of Christian Religion. A yeare after he went from Arminig to Chillan, where he kept with a Goldsmith his fathers friend. In this time he had intelligence, by mutuall writing, with his friends at Ardouil: and with this Goldsmith hauing gathered together eighteene or twentie men of their Sect secretly to take a strong castle, called Maumutaga, and hidden in ambush two hundred horsemen of his friends in Ardouil, suddenly slaying the gard, and possessing himselfe of the Castle, he entred a Towne not farre from the Castle, killing the inhabitants, and carrying the spoyle to the Castle. This Castle was very rich, because it was a principall Hauen of the Caspian Sea; and so strong, that when Alumut had newes hereof, he was dissuaded from sending any power thither to besiege him. Two dayes iourney from hence is Sumachi: which with his power, now encreased, he also tooke, and diui∣ded the spoyles euery where to his souldiors, which with fame of this liberalitie came from all parts vnto him. He sent also into Hiberia, three or foure dayes iourney from thence, which was then gouerned by seuen great Lords, three of which, Alexander Sbec, Gorgurambec, and Mirzambec, with many promises of present spoyles and fu∣ture exemptions from tribute, he woon to his side, receiuing from each of them three thousand horse, so that he was now growne fifteene or sixteene thousand strong. A∣lumut with thirty thousand valiant souldiers went to meete him betweene Tauris and Sumachia, and hauing passed a great riuer, ouer which were two Bridges, he presently caused them to bee broken: Ismael arriuing there the next day, with great diligence found a passage through the streame, & with his whole forces, in front, in the breake of the day, assailed Alumut his army, little suspecting such a good morrow, that Alumut with a few companions hardly escaped. The pauilions, horses, and other bootie, Is∣mael bestowed on his souldiers: and then hasted to Tauris, where entring without re∣sistance, he made great slaughter, killing all the race of Iacob, opening his Sepulchre, and the Graues of other noblemen, which had bin at the battell of Darbent against his father, & burning their bones; 300 harlots he caused to be cut asunder in the middle: he killed all the dogges in Tauris, and because his mother had married to one of those nobles which were in the battell of Darbent, hee caused her head to be stricken off in his presence. In this while many towns, cities, castles, and Lords submitted themselues to him, and ware his red-coloured Turbant: but the Castle Alangiachana (whereto were subiect eighteen villages of Christians, which vsed yerely to send to Rome two men from the Patriarch to the Pope, of whose faith they were, speaking Armonian, ha∣uing some bookes, but quite lost the vse of the Italian language) this castle (I say) held out for Alumut vntill his death. While Ismael was Sultan in Tauris, the Sultan in Bagadet Murat Can son of Iacob, with an army of 30000. marched against him, & in a plaine meeting with Ismael was there ouerthrowne, not 70. persons escaping to Bagadet with Murat Can: the place bearing witnes of the slaughter, buried vnder many new hils of bones. All these things were done anno 1499. And while I was in Tauris, many came from Natolia, Carama∣nia, and Turkie to serue him; of whom they were gratiously intertained, Anno 1507. our Author being then in Malacia saw with his eyes, the Sultan Alumut conueyed pri∣soner by Amirbec, who with foure thousand men going from Mosul (somtime Niniue) to Amit, where the Sultan kept, with promise and profession of his succor, being ad∣mitted the city, tooke him, & cast a chaine about his necke, whose head Ismael smote off with his owne hands. He was presented to him by Amirbec in the country of Ala∣duli, against whom Ismael was now warring: where taking the city Cartibirt, he cut off the head of Becarbec son of Aladuli lord thereof with his own hands. From thence returning to Tauris he had almost done as much to his two brethren, whome hee had left Gouernours in his absence, for transgressing their Commission, but with much in∣treaty of his Lords, spared their liues, yet confined them to Ardouill, not to depart from thence. The next yeere he pursued Murat Can, who was come to Syras, a Ci∣tie not inferiour to Cairo in Egypt, with sixe and thirtie thousand men, but male con∣tent, and therefore many of them fleeing vnto Ismael. Whereupon Murat Can sent
two Embassadours with fiue hundred followers, with offer of Vassallage vnto him. Ismael cut them all in pieces, saying, That if Murat can would be his Vassall, hee should come in person, not by Embassage. Muratcan had closely sent Spies to ob∣serue the sequele of his businesse, and being hereof by them aduertised, fledde: For many of his Nobles had alreadie put on the redde Turbant, of whome he feared to be taken, as Alumut had beene; and therefore with three thousand of his most faithfull he fledde vnto Aleppo: but the Soldan of Cairo not admitting him, hee went to Aladuli, who entertained him honourably, and gaue him his daughter to wife. Ismael, after great slaughters in Siras and Bagadet, was forced to returne to Spaan with his Armie. For Ieselbas the Tartar had taken all the Countrey of Corasan, and the great Citie of Eri, which is in compasse betwixt fortie and fiftie myles, well peo∣pled, and full of Marchandize: He had taken also Strava, Amixandaran, and Sari, on the Caspian shore; and with intent to beguile Ismael, desired leaue to passe through is Countrey to Mecca on Pilgrimage. Ismael with deniall, and other sharpe words; repelled his suit, and abode a yeare in Spaan, to withstand his enterprises. After he returned to Tauris, where were great Triumphes solemnized in his honour. This Sophi is so loued and feared (sayth this Marchant) that they hold him as a God, es∣pecially his souldiors: of which, some goe into the warres without Armour, holding it sufficient, that Ismael will succour them: others, because they content themselues to die for Ismael, goe into battaile with naked breast, crying, Schiack, Schiack, i. GOD, GOD. And they forget the name of GOD, alway naming Ismael: they hold, That he shall not die, but liue euer. And where other Mosulmans say, La ylla yllala, Mahamet resullalla, the Persians say, Laylla yllala, Ismael vellilalla; reputing him a God and a Prophet. I haue learned, that Ismael is not contented to be called or wor∣shipped as God. Their custome is to weare redde Bonnets, with a certaine thing like girdle, large below, and straiter vp wards, made with twelue foulds, a finger thicke, signifying the twelue Sacraments of their Sect, or those twelue brethren, nephewes of Ali, Ismael was of faire countenance, of reasonable stature, thicke and large in the soulders, shauen all but the mustaches; left-handed, stronger then any of his Nobles, but giuen to Sodomie. At his second comming to Tauris, he caused to take twelue of the fairest boyes in the Citie to serue his lust, and after gaue to each of his Nobles one for the like purpose, and before tooke tenne of the best mens sonnes for the same intent. Thus farre haue we had commerce with this namelesse Persian Marchant in Ra∣musius his shoppe, Osorius de Reb. Emman. lib. 10. I.Bot.Ben. who sometime attended on his Court and Campe. Others adde hereunto, That he sent Embassadours to all the Mahumetan Princes of the East, to re∣ceiue that redde-Hat Ensigne, together with his Sect; as did his sonne Tammas after him, when Nizzamulucco onely accepted thereof. But it is the common opinion, that the greatest part of the Mahumetanes in Soria and of Asia Minor are secretly of at Sect. Ismael after this warred, and wonne, vpon the Zagatai Tartars, and other adiacent Nations, that he left vnto his successours a very great Estate, Knol.Turk.Hist. reaching from the Caspian Sea to the Persian, and betweene the Lake Iocco and Tigris, the Riuer Abbiam, and the Kingdome of Cambaya, more then twentie degrees from East to West, and eighteene from North to South. He ordained a new Liturgie, and forme of Prayer, differing from the auncient. Such was his authoritie, that they would sweare, By the Head of Ismael, and blesse in his name, saying, Ismael graunt the thy desire. Vpon his Coyne, on the one side, was written, La illahe illa∣lahu Muhamedun resulallahe: And on the other, Ismaill halife Iullahe, that is, Ismael the Vicar of GOD. Surius Comm. in An.1500. The Iewes, at the first, had this Ismael in such admiration, that they foolishly reckoned Ismael to be their promised Messias, gratulating themselues, in this conceit, throughout the most part of Europe, celebrating feastiuall Solemnities, with mutuall Presents, in testimonie of their ioy; which yet was soone dashed, none hating the Iewes more then Ismael.
He lyeth buried at Ardouil, in a faire Meskit, with a sumptuous Sepulchre made by himselfe in his life time; where is a faire Stone-Hospitall erected by him for strangers, allowing to all trauellers three dayes reliefe for horse and man freely. Ant. Ienkinson. Ardouil is in latitude 38. degrees. The life of Ismael had beene answerable to the bloudie presages in his ominous birth; Angiolello, c.13. for he came forth of his mothers wombe with both his hands shut, and full of bloud: for which cause his father would not haue brought him vp, but commaunded him to be slaine: but they which carried him away, moued with compassion, secretly nourished him three yeares, Ph.Camerar. Medit. Histor. Cent.2.c.4. and after presented him to his father, who then acknow∣ledged and receiued him with loue and kindnesse: for this his bloudie and warre-like spirit dwelt in a louely and amiable bodie, adorned with all the Ensignes of beautie. He died Anno 1524. Schiack Theemes, or Shaugh Tamas, succeeded, and raigned aboue fiftie yeares. Michael lsselt. in An.1576. He liued deuoutly, and yet (for their Law reconcileth both) very voluptuously, inheri∣ting his fathers Throne, but Busbeq. epist.3. not his valour, and spending the greatest part of his time amongst his women. Ant. Ienkinson. Hak.t.1.p.349. So zealous he was of their superstition, that when M. Ienkinson came to his Court with the Queenes Letters to treat with him of Traffique and Com∣merce for our English Marchants, before his feet touched the ground, a payre of the Sophies owne Shooes or Basmackes (such as himselfe vsed to weare, when he arose in the night to pray) were put vpon his feet, least their holy ground should be polluted with Christian steppes. And being admitted into his presence, and asked of his Reli∣gion, Whether he were a Gower, that is, an Vnbeleeuer, or a Muselman (so they call them of their owne profession) hauing answered, That he was a Christian, beleeuing CHRIST to be the greatest Prophet: Oh thou vnbeleeuer (said he) we haue no need to haue friendship with the vnbeleeuers, and so willed him to depart: which he did, and after him followed a man with a Basanet of Sand, fifting all the way that he had gone within the said Pallace, euen from the Sophies sight vnto the Court-gate. In his time Solyman (as in our Turkish Relations before is shewed) much endam∣maged the Persians, Lib.3.cap.8. and tooke Babylonia, Tauris, and other parts of their dominions: yet did Tam recouer some part thereof againe, and draue Solyman out of Tauris, (or Ecbatana, as Minadoi Minadoi of the Warres be∣tweene the Turkes and Persians, l.1. interpreteth) and, by a composition, caused him to rase the Fort of Chars, erected by the Turkes in his frontiers. He died the eleuenth of May, 1576, leauing behind him eleuen children: Mahamet the eldest, who had li∣ued a while in Heri (sometime called Aria) and after in Siras (aunciently named Per∣sepolis:) his second sonne was Ismahel, whome for his fiercenesse his father had con∣fined to the Castle Cahaca: the third, Aidere; the rest, Mamut, Solimano, Mustaffa, Emanguli, Alichan, Amet, Abrahim, and Ismahel the younger. He appointed his second sonne Ismahel his successour, esteeming him more worthie then Maha∣met Codabanda (this surname was giuen him for his diseased eyes) as being giuen to a studious and quiet life, and contenting himselfe, that Abas Mirize (which now raig∣neth) was confirmed in the Citie of Heri, and honoured with the title of the Visier of that Countrey. Periaconcona, the daughter of Tamas, and elder then any of the brethren, being in Commission with other Councellors of State to see her fathers Will executed, whiles the Postes ranne with aduertisements to Ismahel, was attempted by Aidere with ear∣nest solicitation for the Crowne: whose ambitious desire shee so farre satisfied, as that shee caused him to be inuefted in Regall apparrell, and setled in the great Gal∣lerie, attending the acclamation of the people; being publikely installed, as though he were elected King. But meane while she set sure gards of men, deuoted to Isma∣hel, at the gates of the Palace; thus purposing to entertaine him (with dreames of dangerous honours) till Ismahel arriued at Casbin. But whiles he (suspecting the de∣ceit) sought to flee, he left his head behind in the hands of Sahamal his vncle, which he cast, all-bloudie, in the middest of his conspiring partakers. Ismahel soone after came, and receiued with publike applause the desired Soueraigntie: & as he had before
addicted himselfe to the studie of the Turkish Law; (enough, if it had beene knowne, to haue barred his succession) so now, after the Turkish manner, he foundeth his Throne (a foundation too slipperie to stand) in bloud, causing the heads of his eight younger brethren to be cut off, together with all such as were neere them in bloud or affinitie, and all the fauourites of the late slaine Aidere. Turkish Parricide imitated in Persia. Thus is Casbin dyed in the bloud of her hopefull Gallants, and entertaines her beholders eyes with streames of bloud running from the slaine, which cause another streame of teares to issue from their liuing friends; who filling the ayre with mournefull complaints (which retur∣ning answere by Ecchoes, seemed to sympathize their griefe) and in compassion of those dying bodies, then gasping their fatall breaths, imitating (with true affection, and not affected imitation) the same in deepe and broken sighes: viewing also their owne dangers in the present ruine of their neerest and deerest some-time allies and acquaintance: tossed with this varietie of turbulent passions, conceiue, in this confu∣sion of thoughts (that which is truly the daughter and mother also of confusion) Tre∣cherous Disloyaltie to the author of these their sorrowes. Ismahel posting on to his owne destruction, had now forbidden the deuotions of Aly the Persian Prophet, and enioyned the Turkish Rites of Abubar, and other the followers of Mahomet, by imprisoning, rayling, pulling out the eyes, and killing Aly his obseruants, establishing his Decree, not sparing, in this persecution, to torment the tender Ladies (some of them of his owne bloud) nor reuerencing age or profession, depriuing euen the Ca∣liffe of Casbin (the eye of their blindnesse) of both his eyes, because he would not see equitie in this noueltie; and purposing (as the Fame went) to goe to Bagdat, there to receiue the Crowne from him whomsoeuer he should finde the successour of the great Califfe, in the middest of his cruelties he was (with like crueltie) murthered by Peria∣concona. The Executor of her fathers Will is thus made an Executioner of her fathers sonne, hauing brought in the conspirators, apparrelled in womens weedes, to strangle him among his paramours. This was done the 24. of Nouember 1577; after he had raigned one yeare, seuen moneths, and sixe dayes. Mahomet Codabanda thought it now time for him to looke to his right, which by meanes of Mirize Salma, the chiefe of the Sultans, he obtained. This Sultan presented him with the head of that Virago Periaconcona vpon the top of a Launce, with the disheuelled haire, gastly lookes, and bloudie impressions, yeelding an vncouth (though not vndeserued) spectacle to the beholders: De Medusa & Megaera, vide Poetas. which (if like the Snakie scalpe of Medusa it did not transforme them in∣to stones, yet, as if it had beene the banner of Megaera) seemed to display new quar∣rels, kindling inward hatreds, tumultuous seditions, and ciuill broyles, which exposed them to Amuraths forces, who thought it fit time for him to fish with his Turkish Nets in this troubled Persian streame. Of these warres is alreadie spoken Lib.3.c.8. . Much losse did the Persians by this meanes sustaine, and much more had followed, had not Emir Hamze, Mahomets eldest sonne, with his valorous attempts, stopped the Turkish pro∣ceedings, and, like the Easterne Sunne, with his greater brigtnesse dispersed those wea∣ker beames of The Moonie Standards of proud Ottoman. I. Silvest. in Du Bartas transl. But soone was this Sunne eclipsed, not by the Moones interposition (for that is na∣turall, if we vnderstand it of the heauenly; and ordinary, if of the earthly and Turkish) but by extraordinary and vnnaturall procurement (as was thought) of his ambitious brother Abas, or of others suspected of his father, effected by a treacherous Eunuch that garded him; which sodainely strucke him through the body and slew him. Abas his brother by solemne oath cleared himselfe of this odious imputation. And yet he is no lesse suspected of a more monstrous and vnnaturall treachery against his owne fa∣ther, who is thought Minadoi, l.9. in his 9. books, translated by M. Hartwell, the Reader may see these wares at full. Relatione di Persia, & Tu. Thesoro. Politice.

But (all this notwithstan∣ding) he hath since so subtilly handled the matter, that he is both beloued of his owne, and feared of his enemy: his subiects sweare and blesse in his name. Cartwright. An. 1603. He hath recoue∣red from the Turke both Tauris, and other Regions of Servania and Georgia, which the Turke had before taken from the Persians. Hee was reported also to haue taken Bagdat, bnt (it seemeth) not truely.
As for Tauris, in the yeare 1514, Selim tooke it (as some say) on composition, which he brake, and carried thence three thousand of the best artificers to Constantinople. An. 1535, Solyman gaue it for a prey to his souldiors; An 1585, Osman spoyled it vvith vncouth and inhumane cruelties; whatsoeuer the insulting Conqueror, in the vtmost extent of lawlesse lust, could inflict, or the afflicted condition of the conque∣red could in the most deiected state of miserie sustaine, was there executed. Abas in recouerie here of vsed the Canon, an Instrument which before they had, to their owne losse, scòrned. This Prince is (sayth our Author) excellent both of compositi∣on of bodie, and disposition of minde, of indifferent stature, sterne countenance, pier∣cing eyes, swart colour, his mustachees on the vpper lippc long, his beard cut close to the chinne. He delights in Hunting and Hawking, Running, Leaping, and trying of Masteries: He is an excellent Horseman and Archer. In the morning he vseth to visit his stables of great Horses, and hauing there spent most of the fore-noone, he returnes to his Pallace: About three of the clocke in the afternoone he goeth to the At-Maidan, which is the high street of Hispaan, the Citie of his residence, round about which are seaffolds for the people to sit and behold the King and his Nobles at their Exercises of Shooting, Running, Playing at Tennis, &c. all on horsebacke. In this place very often, in his owne person, he heareth causes, and pronounceth sentence, executing Iustice seuerely. Now that we may mention some of the chiefe Cities of Persia (vnder which name I here comprehend, as vsually in this Historie, their Media, Ghei∣lan, Massan∣dtan, or Hyr∣cania, Parthia, Aria, Canda∣har, Heri, Co∣rassau, Farsi, or Persia, with the Caramanian desart, and the Kingdome of Lar, and the Turcoman na∣tion are sub∣iect to this King: and lie hath also subdued & ruined the houses of some great men, which in his fathers daies would doe what they lift. Dominion, not as it is measured by the Pennes of Geographers, but by the Swords of their Princes.) In Sumachia Ma∣ster Cartwright sayth, They saw the ruines of a cruell spectacle, which was a Turret ere∣cted with Free-stone & Flints, in the middest whereof were placed the heads of all the Nobilitie and Gentrie of the Countrey. A mile from this Towne was a Nunnerie, wherein was buried the bodie of Amalcke Canna, the Kings daughter, who slew her selfe with a knife, for that her father would haue forced her to marrie a Tartarian Prince: the Virgins of the Countrey resort hither once a yeare to lament her death. Sechi is foure dayes iourney thence, not farre from which is Eres, which, because they yeelded to the Turke, were by Emir-Haie vtterly destroyed, man, woman, and child. Arasse is the chiefe Citie of Marchandise in all Servania, especially for raw Silkes. Tau∣ris hath out-liued many deaths, and is very rich by reason of continuall Trade, nouri∣shing almost two hundred thousand people within her compasse; for walls it hath not. This was sometimes the Seat-Royall, and after that, Casbin, which is situate in a fertile Plaine, foure dayes iourney in length, wherein are two thousand Villages. The buil∣dings are of Bricke dried in the Sunne, as in Persia is most vsuall: The At-maidan, or chiefe street, is foure-square, almost a mile in circuit. Neere to it is Ardouil, of chiefe note for beginning of the Sophian Superstition. Gilan is foure dayes iourney from Casbin, and stands neere to the Caspian Sea. Neere to Bachu is a Fountaine of blacke oyle, which serueth all the Country to burne in their houses. Cassan is well seated, and rich in marchandise, but subiect to heat more then other parts of Persia. No person is there permitted to be idle. Hispaan is thought to be Hecatompolis: the walls are a dayes iourney about on horsebacke, before the greatest, now the royall Citie of the Persians. It hath a strong Fort, two Seraglio's, the walls where of glister with red Mar∣ble and Parget of diuers colours, paused all with Mosaique worke, all things else combining Maiestie and louelinesse, Magnificence and beautie. The inhabitants, as did the ancient Parthians, buy, sell, talke, and performe all their publike and priuate affaires on horsebacke: the Gentlemen neuer goe on foot. Sieras is thought to be Persepolis, it is rich of Trade, and there is the best Armour made in all the East, of Iyron & Steele, cunningly tempered with the iuice of certaine hearbes.
CHAP. VII. Of the Sophian Sect, or Persian Religion, as it is at this present. IT hath beene alreadie shewed, how the Saracens had one Calyfa, or Caliph, whome they esteemed the Head of their Religion and Em∣pire, in right vnto both succeeding their grand Seducer, Mahomet; and how the foure Captaines or Doctors, each ayming, vnder colour of Religion, to further his ambitious Proiects, made way to difference of Sects in the beginning; and in succeeding Ages the Sword deci∣ded who was rightfull successour, the posteritie of each challenging to himselfe that right, according as they were able in the Field to maintaine it. These Persians affected Hali, as truest interpreter of their Law, and Lord of the State, to whome Mahomet gaue his daughter in his life time, and his Alcoran at his death, being his kinsman also by birth: and although, by the violence of the contradicting Ca∣liphes, they did not alway make hereof open profession, yet euer and anone, as occasion was offered, this fire brake out, yet neuer into so great a flame, as af∣ter the yeare 1369, by Sophi, Guine, Aidar, Ismael, and their successours, vnto this day. From that diuision betwixt the Persians and Arabians, about the successour of Mahomet, (it is Barrius his relation, in which the Persians call themselues Sia, which signifieth the Vnion of one Bodie, but the Arabians call them Raffadin, that is, Vnreasonable, and themselues Cunin) proceeded other Sects amongst the Ma∣humetans; and amongst the Persians, two, called Camarata and Mutazeli, which follow little the saying of the Prophets, but would haue all proued to them by na∣turall reason, not allowing Moses or Mahomet any further. Io.di Barr. As∣dec.2.l.0.c.6. There is one Sect a∣mongst them, called Malabedà, which subiecteth all things to Chaunce and to the Starres, not to Diuine Prouidence. There are other called Emozaidi, which reiect many things in the Alcoran, and follow the Doctrine of Zaidi, the Nephew of Hocem, second sonne of Ali; these inhabite on the Confines of Prester Iohn, and in Melinde. But to come to the common Persians, and to obserue out of Barrius the diuer∣sitie of Opinion betwixt them and the Arabians; their Doctors reduce these diffe∣rences into seuenteene Conclusions. The Persians say, That GOD is the author and worker of euerie good, and that euill commeth from the Devill, quast doe-euill: or, Diuell, of Διάβολος, an accuser or cauiller. Deuill: The Arabians say, That would bring in two Gods, one of good, the other of euill. The Persians say, That GOD is eternall, and that the Law and Creation of Men had a beginning: The Ara∣bians answere, That all the words of the Law are prayses of the workes of GOD, and therefore eternall, like himselfe. The Persians say, That the Soules of the Blessed in the other World cannot see the essence of GOD, because he is a Spirit of Diuinitie; onely they shall see his Greatnesse, Mercie, Pitie, and all other good things which he worketh in the creatures: The Arabians answere, That they shall see him with their eyes, euen as he is. The Persians say, That when Mahomet receiued the Law, his soule was carried by the Angell Gabriel into the presence of GOD: The Arabians affirme it of his bodie also. The Persians say, That the children of Ali, or Alle, and Fatema, and their twelue Nephewes, haue preheminence aboue all Prophets: the Arabians graunt it, aboue all other men, but not aboue the Prophets. The Persians say, That it is suffi∣cient to pray thrice a day vnto GOD; in the Morning when the Sunne riseth, which is called Sob the second (Dor) at Noone; the third (Magareb) before Sunne-set, be∣cause these three containe all the parts of the day: the Arabians require twice besides, according to their Law, called Hacer, and Assa. The rest of their seuenteene Articles of difference mine Author hath not expressed. These are sufficient to shew, That they not onely differ about the successors of Mahomet, as Minadoi affirmeth, but about
Dogmaticall Points also in their ridiculous Theologie, and interpretation of their Law. These differences haue continued of old and long continuance: what hath in later times accrewed hereunto by the Sophian additions of Guine and his followers, is in part touched in the former Chapter. Let vs now take view thereof, as the same at this present hath infected Persia and the neighbouring Regions. There is resident in Casbin Minadoi, li. 2. The chiefe is now at Hispaan. Carlw. their prophane Priest, called Mustaed-Dini, that is to say, the chiefe of the Law, who is as the Mufti among the Turkes; and in the other subiect Cities are certaine peculiar heads obedient to this chiefe Priest; who notwithstanding are not chosen or displaced at his pleasure, but by the King him∣selfe, who should not onely be a King, but a Priest, as Ali and Mahomet were, from whome hee chalengeth succession. Howbeit, for auoiding of greater trouble, hee graunteth that fauour, and putteth ouer that burthen from himselfe vnto others, to whose iudgements he also referreth himselfe, whensoeuer there is any Consultation or Treatie touching their Law and Religion. Vnder the Musted-Dini are the Ca∣lifes (sayth Minadoi) and these are they that execute their daily Seruice in their Mos∣chees or Temples. The chiefe of these Califes is he that putteth the Horne vpon the Kings head when he is first enthronized: a ceremonie now performed in Casbin, be∣cause the Turkes forbad it to be performed in Cafe, neere vnto Babylon, according to the auncient wont. Other Cities also haue a Mustaed-Dini and Calife, although infe∣riour to them of Casbin. The difference betweene the Turke and Persian (as commonly it happeneth in case of Religion) is so hotely pursued on both sides betwixt them, that they neither vse mutuall Marriage nor Marchandise, Phil. Camerar. I.F.Op. subcis. cent.3.c.12. as some affirme: There can be no certaine Peace, or continuing Truce. And if one alters his Religion, and turnes to the other side, hee is not receiued without a new Circumcision There be meanes to draw vp that skinne by art, which may en∣dure a new cutting. . Baiaze the great Turke burnt two hundred Houses in Constantinople, infected with this Sect, together with the inhabitants, and set forth a publike Edict against it. Ismael is said, in like hatred of the Turkes, to haue caused a Swine to be nourished, which, in despight of the Ottoman, he named Baiazet. Solyman returning from Amasia, was enter∣tained in the house of one of this Sect, who therefore, after the departure of his Prince, purified his House with Washings, Perfumes, and other Ceremonies, as if it had beene polluted with a Turkish Guest: For which cause himselfe was slaine, and his House razed. But let vs take a further view of this Sect in other Countries. Neither could it containe it selfe in the limits of the Persian Kingdome, but was spread further, and receiued euen in the heart of Turkie, and Skirts of India. For amongst other the Disciples of Aidar, Chasan Shelife and Schach Culi, after∣wards surnamed Cuselas, Knol. T. H. Surius Comm. in An. 1500. fleeing the furie of the Persian King, who had slaine their Master, and persecuted his followers, came into Armenia Minor, and there tooke vp their dwelling at the great Mountaine Antitaurus, at the foot whereof the bro∣ken Rockes haue many darke Caues, the worke of Art partly, partly of Nature: which place of the inhabitants is called Teke-il, whereof Sohach-Culi was after called Techellis. Here these two giuing themselues wholly to a contemplatiue life, in a strict austeritie contenting themselues with such things as the earth voluntarily affoorded, began to grow in knowledge first of the Heards-men and Shepheards, after of the Husbandmen and Countrey people, admiring their new holinesse. Yea, Baiazet himselfe, then Emperour of the Turkes, moued with zeale of their deuotion, sent them yearely sixe or seuen thousand Aspers. Afterwards becomming Fortune∣tellers, and prognosticating thinges to come, they were by the superstitious peo∣ple drawne into Villages and Cities, where they preached Hali, according to Ai∣dars Doctrine, enioyning their Disciples the redde Band on their Turbants; of which, the Turkes tearme them Cuselbas, that is, Redde-Heads, with which, in short time, the Cities and Townes were filled.
When they were thus multiplied, there met ten thousand of thē at a Faire at Tascia, or Attalia, where they executed the chiefe Magistrate; and being perswaded by these new Masters, they sware neuer to forsake their Captaines, or refuse any labour for their most holy Religion, vowing their soules and bodies in defence thereof. These Cap∣taines not hauing otherwise to maintaine their followers, gaue them leaue to forage the countrey adioyning, and to liue vpon the spoile of them that would not receiue their new doctrine, which they in many troupes, and with many prayers accordingly performed. They entred into Lycaonia, and the people fled out of the countrey into Iconium. There two Prophets set vp proclamations of blessings to all such as would receiue their sect; and of destruction to the gain-sayers. Ismael also, to encrease their strength, had sent them some troupes of horse-men. Baiazets two nephewes with the forces of the countrey, incountting them in battell, receiued the ouerthrow: Cor∣cutus, the sonne of Baaze, with his armie durst not assaile them. Thus marched they into Bythinia, where neere vnto the Riuer Sangarius, Caragoses Bassa, Viceroy of A∣sia, affronted them, hauing before commanded Aehmees, the eldest sonne of Baiazet, to leuy forces in his gouernment of Cappadocia and Pontus, to shut them in at their backs. But Techellis, after the losse of seuē thousand men, & all his ensignes, chased him out of the field into Cutaie, the seat of the Viceroy, where he besieged and tooke him with his wiues and children: and after being pursued by Alis Bassa, with forces out of Europe, hee implaed this Caragoses in the way on a sharpe stake fastened in the ground. Heere was he forced to fight, and his fellow Chasan Shelife slaine; but Te∣chellis recouering the battell almost lost, left Alis Bassa slaine in the place; the Turkes fleeing before him. Ionuses Bassa was sent against him, when hauing lost a great part of his strength, he retired his weakened forces vnto Antitaurus, out of the woods and mountaines often asailing the Turkes: whence at last he fled into Persia. Ionnses cau∣sed strait inquisition to be made for these new sectaties, doing such to death with ex∣quisite torments, as had borne armes in the late rebellion, and burned the rest in the forehead with an hot iron: and after transported them, together with the friends and kinsmen of such as had beene executed, into Europe, there to be dispersed through Macedonia, Epirus, and Peloponnesus, for feare of a second returne of Techellis. The remainder of Techellis his power as they fled into Persia, robbed a Carauan of Mer∣chants; for which outrage, comming to Tauris their Captaines were by Ismaels com∣mand executed, and Techellis himselfe burnt aliue; but yet is this sect closely fauoured in Asia. We haue now seene the proceedings of this Sophian sect, both in Persia and Tur∣kie, both heere kept downe, and there established, by force. Nicolas Nicholay in his third booke, saith, That Sophi is not the name of their King, but of their sect, which enioyneth them to weare on their heads woollen Tolipanes: Sophi in Arabian being the name of wooll. Hak.tom.1. Geffrey Ducket saith, in the Persian language Sophi signifieth beg∣ger, and that their King is called there, not Sophi, but Shangh; but of this title is said be∣fore. Whether it hath beene deriued of the first Author, or of their woollen superstiti∣on; the Sophian sect is exceeding zealous in their Rites. To weare red on the lower parts of their bodie, were to these Red-heads scarcely piacular. Touching Hali, they haue diuers dreames: as that when they doubted of Mahomets successor, a little Li∣zard came into a Councell assembled to decide the controuersie, and declared that it was Mahomets pleasure, that Mortus Ali should be the man. He had a sword where∣with he killed as many as he stroke. At his death hee told them that a white Camell would come for his bodie, which accordingly came, and carried his dead body and the sword, and was therewith taken vp into heauen, for whose returne they haue long looked in Persia. For this cause the King kept a horse readie sadled, and kept for him also a daughter of his be his wife, Some say it is for one of his Nephewes. but shee died in the yeare 1573. And they say further, that if he come not shortly, they shall be of our beleefe. They haue few bookes, and lesse learning. There is often great contention and mu∣tiny in great Townes, which of Mortus Ali his sonnes was greatest: sometime two or three thousand people being together by the eares about the same: as I haue seene
(saith Master Ducket) in Shamaky, and Ardouil, and Tauris, where I haue seene a man comming from fighting, and in a brauery bringing in his hand foure or fiue mens heads, carrying them by the haire of the crowne. For although they shaue their heads commonly twice a weeke, yet leaue they a tuft of haire vpon their heads about two foot long, whereof, when I enquired the cause, They answered, that thereby they may be the easilier carried vp into heauen when they are dead. In praying they turne to the South, because Mecca lieth that way from them. When they be on trauell in the way, many of them will as soone as the Sunne riseth light from their horses, turning themselues to the South, and will lay their gownes before them, with their swords and beads, & so standing vpright doe their holy things, many times in their prayers knee∣ling downe and kissing their beads, or some what else that lieth before them. When they earnestly affirme a matter, they sweare by GOD, Mahomet, and Mor∣tus Ali, Knol. Turk. Hist.pag.964. and sometime by all at once, saying, Olla Mahumet Ali, and sometime Shaugham basshe, that is, by the Shaughes head. Abas the yong Prince of Persia, char∣ged with imputation of treason, after other Purgatory speeches, sware by the Creator that spread out the aire; that founded the earth vpon the deepes; that adorned the heauens with Starres; that powred abroad the water; that made the fire; and briefely, of nothing brought forth all things: by the head of Ali, and by the religion of their Prophet Mahomet, Arthur Ed∣wards. Hak.tom.1. that he was cleare. If any Christian will become a Bosarman, or one of their superstition, they giue him many gifts: the Gouernor of the towne appointeth him a horse, and one to ride before him on another horse, bearing a sword in his hand, and the Bosarman bearing an arrow in his hand, rideth in the Citie cursing his father and mother. The sword signifieth death, if he reuolt againe. Before the Shaugh see∣med to fauour our Nation, the people abused them very much, and so hated them, that they would not touch them, reuiling them by the names of Cafars and Gawars, that is, Infidels, or Misbeleeuers. Afterwards they would kisse their hands, and vse them gent∣ly and reuerently. Rich. Cheinic. Drunkards and riotous persons they hate; for which cause Richard Iohnson caused the English, by his vitious liuing, to be worse accounted of then the Russes. Their opinions and rites most-what agree with the Turkish and Saracenicall. Their Priests are apparelled like other men: Ducket. they vse euery morning and after-noone to goe vp to the toppes of their Churches, and tell there a great tale of Mahomet and Mortus Ali. They haue also among them certaine holy men called Setes; accounted therefore holy, because they, or some of their ancestors haue beene on pilgrimage at Mecca; these must be belieued for this Saint-ship, although they lie neuer so shamefully. These Setes vse to shaue their heads all ouer, sauing on the sides a little aboue the temples, which they leaue vnshauen, and vse to braid the same as women doe their haire, and weare it as long as it will grow. Ios. Barb. apud Ramus. Iosafa Barbaro at Sammachi lodged in an Hospitall, wherein was a graue vnder a vault of stone, & neere vnto that a man with his beard & haire long; naked, sauing that a little before and behind he was couered with a skin, sitting on a peece of a matte on the ground; I (saith he) saluted him, & demanded what he did: he told me he watched his father: I asked who was his father; He, quoth he, that doth good to his neighbour: with this man in this sepulchre I haue liued thirtie yeares: and will now accompany him after death; and being dead, be buried with him: I haue seene of the world sufficient, and now haue determined to abide thus till death. Another I found at Tauris on All-Soules day, in the which they also vsed a comme∣moration of soules departed, neere to a Sepulchre in a Church-yard; hauing about him many birds, especially Rauens and Crowes: I thought it had beene a dead corpse, but was told it was a liuing Saint, at whose call the birds resorted to him, and he gaue them meate. Another I saw, when Assambei was in Armenia, marching into Persia against Sig∣nior Iausa, Lord of Persia and Zagatai, vnto the Citie of Herem; who drew his staffe in the dishes wherein they ate, and said certaine words and brake them all: the Sultan demanded what hee had said: they which heard him answered, that he said he should
be victorious, and breake his enemies forces, as he had broken those dishes: where∣upon he commanded him to be kept till his returne; and finding the euent according, he vsed him honorably. When the Sultan rode through the fields, he was set on a Mule and his hands bound before him, because he was sometime accustomed to doe some dangerous folly: at his feet there attended on him many of their religious persons, cal∣led Daruise. These madde trickes he vsed according to the course of the Moone, some∣times in two or three dayes not eating any thing, busied in such fooleries, that they were faine to binde him: He had great allowance for his expenses. One of those holy men there was, which went naked like to the beasts, preaching their faith: and hauing obtained great reputation, he caused himselfe to be immured in a wall fortie dayes, there to abide without any sustenance: but when this time was expired, and some wondered, one more nose-wise then the rest smelled the sent of flesh: the Sultan hearing it, committed him and his disciple to the Cadilasher, who by torments caused them to confesse the cousinage; for, thorow a hole which was made in the wall by a caue, he had broth conueyed to him, and therefore they were both put to death. In the yeare 1478. Chozamirech an Armenian, being in his shop in Tauris, an Azi or Saint of theirs came to him, and willed him to deny his Christian faith: he answered him courteously, & prayed him not to trouble him: but when he persisted, he offered him money; the Saint would not haue the mony, but importuned his first sute: Chozumirech said hee would not deny his Christian faith: whereupon the other pluc∣ked a sword out of a mans scabad which stood by, and with a wound which he gaue the Armenian in the head, killed him, and ranne away. But the Armenians sonne com∣plaining to the Sultan, procured his apprehension  Meren, two dayes iourney from Tauris: and, being brought before him, he with a knife killed him with his owne hands, and caused him to be cast on a dung-hill for the dogges to eat; saying, Is this the way to encrease the faith of Mahomet? But when some of the more zealous peo∣ple went to one Daruiscassun, which was in guarding of the sepulchre of Assambei the former Sultan, and (as it were). Prior of the Hospitall, and requesting of him, obtai∣ned the bodie to burie it: the Sultan hearing it, sent for him, & said to him, Darest thou countermaund my commaunds? Away and kill him; which was suddenly dispatched. He, further to be reuenged of the people, committed the Towne to the sacke, which for the space of three or foure houres was done. And then he forbad further spoile, and fined the Towne in a great summe of gold. Lastly, he caused the Armenians sonne to come before him, and with many kind words comforted him. This long history I haue inserted, to shew the extremity of blinde zeale, and religious furie in the secular and votaries of these Persians, if Instire should not withstand their rage. Before is mentioned the commemoration of their dead, which is thus performed ouer their sepulchres. Thither resort great multitudes of men and women, old and yong, which sit on heapes with their Priests, and with their candles lighted: the Priests either reade or pray in their language; and after cause to be brought somewhat to eat in the place: the place containeth betweene foure and fiue miles: the pathes which lead thither are full of poore people, which begge almes, some of whom offer to say some prayer for their benefactors. The sepulchres haue stones vpon them ingrauen with the names of the buried parties: and some haue a Chappell of stone thereon. At Merdin he saw a naked man, which came and sate by him, Ios. Barb. and pulling forth a booke, read thereon, and after drew neere and asked him, whence hee was; hee an∣swered, a stranger: I also am a stranger, saith he, of this world, and so are we all; and therefore I haue left it, with purpose to goe thus vnto mine end; with many words be∣sides touching meekenesse, and the deniall of the world. He said, I haue scene a great part thereof, and finde nothing therein that contents me, and therefore haue determi∣ned to abandon it altogether. To this Merdin a man cannot passe, but by a way made of stone, continuing a mile: at the head thereof is a gate and way to the Towne; and within the Towne is another hill with a like way of fiue hundred pases in height. There is an Hospitall for entertainment of all strangers, made by Ziangirbei, the brother of Vsuncassan: and if they bee of better sort, they are entertained with carpets spread
for them worth an hundred ducats a peece: and victuals for all commers. We might heere take further view of their stately Temples, their great and popu∣lous Cities, and other things worthie obseruation, if that our Turkish History had not related the like also among them, especially touching the persons and places religious. For the rest I referre the Reader to other Authors. Ducket. The wonders of Nature in these parts are: neere Bachu, a fountaine of oyle continually running, and fetched into the farthest parts of Persia: and another neere Shamaky, of Tarre, whereof we had good vse and proofe in our ship. Hereabouts you shall haue in the fields, neere to any Vil∣lage in the night, two or three hundred Foxes howling. Kine they haue like ours, and another sort great boned and leane, as hard-fauoured as those which Pharaoh drea∣med of. In Persia groweth great abundance of Bombasin cotton: this groweth on a certaine tree or brier, not past the height of a mans waste, with a slender stalke like to a brier or carnation Iuly-flowre, with very many branches, bearing on euery branch a fruit or cod round, which when it commeth to the bignesse of a wall-nut, openeth and sheweth forth the cotton, which groweth still like a fleece of wooll, to the bignes of a mans fist, and then being loose is gathered: the seeds are flat and blacke, as bigge as pease, which they sow in their fields and plowed ground in great abundance. I had thought I had ended this Chapter and our Persian Expedition, but our good friends the Iesuites would needs entertaine your wearie eyes, with reading an exploit of theirs, related by Iohn Copley his Doctrinall and Morall Obser∣uations con∣cerning Reli∣gion.pag.85. one, sometimes their fellow Catholike, now (I hope) our fellow Christian. For the credit of this honest and loyall (if their honest returne not with  n∣est, and loyall with a lie-all) societie, was a French pamphlet by them dispersed (a little before the Powder treason) amongst their Catholike friends in England, reporting the miraculous conuersion of the King of Persia, by one Campian a Iesuite, an English∣man, that had expelled a Diuell out of a possessed partie; and commanded the Diuell at his departure to giue a signe thereof, by striking downe the top of a steeple. Which being effected, the Kings conuersion followed, together with many of the nobility, to the Roman faith; libertie also being granted to preach it openly, and to build Chur∣ches & Monasteries throughout the kingdome. This was beleeued in England, especi∣ally by a friend of our Authors, vnto whom that pamphlet was sent, who requested him to say Masse in thanksgiuing to GOD for so great a benefit. But in the end, that Iesuite who sent the Pamphlet, gaue out that it was but a thing deuised by French Hu∣gonets, to disgrace their societie. Gracious societie! that can sometime cure their lies with a distinction of piaefraudes, Deuout-de∣ceits:spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici? Had euer any but a lesuit dis∣pensation to many Deuoti∣on and Deceit, Godlinesse, & Cousenage to∣gether? sometime couer them with a robe of the new fa∣shion, Aequinocation: sometimes can expose their bastards at other mens doores, to shield themselues from shame with laying the blame on others; and haue a mint in their pragmaticall heads of such supersubtle inuentions: what are they now disgraced, and that by Hugonets? Euen as tru-ly as the Parliament-house should haue beene blowne vp by Puritans Proceeding against the Traytors.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Seres, and of their Religion. VNder the name of Scythia, is contained a very great part of the world: It was diuided into Scythia Europea, and Asiatica. Pliny Plind.4.c.12. saith, that this name reacheth vnto the Sarmatians and Germans, and to those farthest nations, which were vnknowne to other men. And Strabo in his first booke saith, that all knowne regions towards the North were called Scythians or Nomades: and in his eleuenth booke he affirmeth, that the Greekes called all those Northerne Nations, Scythians, and Celtoscythians. Those beyond the Adriatike and Pontike seas, and the Riuer Ister or Danubius, were called Hyperborei, Sauromatae and Arimaspi: those beyond the Caspian sea, Sacae and Massagetae. Some Scytha . Calius li.18.24. will haue this name to be giuen them , which signi∣fieth to be angrie: Others of their Shooting, Plin.l.7.c.56. saith that Scy∣thes, son of Iu∣piter, inuented the bow and arrowes. called still of some of those Nations, and in some other languages Schieten, of which our word Shoote is deriued: Mela in his third booke and fifth chapter, calleth them all Sagae: and in the fragment which bea∣reth the name of Cat Annij de orig, & ap. A Riccobo Cato de Originibus, is mentioned Scythia Saga: this word Saga, Berosus Pseudo-Bero∣sus.lib.2. & 3. & 5. interpreteth a Priest: saying, that Noah left to the Scythian Armenians his rituall bookes, which only Priests, and that only among priests, might reade, who were therefore called Saga, as Noah himselfe had beene. These peopled the countries from Armenia to the Bactrians, all which place was called Scythia Saga: ouer which Saba∣tius reigning in the time of Iupiter Belus, Araxa with his sonne Scytha possessed all from Armenia Westward, to Sarmatia in Europe. The Graecians fable Hercules to be the father of these Nations, begetting Herod.lib.4. Diod.Sic.lib.. Scythes on a monster, whose vpper halfe resem∣bled a woman, the nether part a Viper. It were an endlesse and boundlesse worke, to seeke and set out the true and proper beginnings and bounds of this so large a Tract of the world, called Scythia: the particular Nations of them would be but harsh to recite out of Pliny, Mela, Strabo, and others: the multitude whereof he that will may finde in Ortel.Thes. Ortelius his Thesrus collected together. The Sarmatae, or Sauromatae, are some∣time made one peculiar people of the Scythians: and sometimes the names are con∣founded, Sarmatia also being diuided into Europaea and Asiatica, whereof the one is interpreted by Oliu.is Melt. Ortel. Thes. geo. Oliuerus, Polonia, by Ortelius, Russia, and the other Tartaria. Goropius Gorop. Becce∣sel. in his Becceselua admiring his owne language, coniectureth that while Nimrod and his company fell to Babel, or after our pronunciation, Babble at Babel, o∣thers, namely, the Cymbrians, or posteritie of Gomer, stayed stil in Margiana, a country fruitfull of Vines; whither he imagineth Noah descended out of the Arke, and there a∣bode after the Floud. These he supposeth, being not at Babel, retained their old and first vniuersall language. But Margiana growing too little for their multiplied num∣bers, they wer forced to send out Colonies. And thus the Saxons, Tectosages, Sauro∣matae, Getes or Gothes, the Danes, Galles, and other Scythian Nations, the true po∣steritie of Gomer, and keepers of the first languge, as he by Dutch Etimologies ga∣thereth, peopled both Scythia and Sarmatia in Asia, and Europe together with all Germany, France, England, Norway, Denmarke, and some parts of Asia Minor. He that will be further informed of his Reasons, let him reade his Saxonica Getodanica, and other Treatises of his Becceselanian Antiquities. Ptol.lib.3.c.5. Ptolomey distinguisheth Scythia from Sarmatia: he confineth Sarmatia Europaea with the Sarmatian Ocean, and the land vnknowne on the North: with Vistula on the West: the Easterne border is Tanais: from whence vnto the Hircanian sea Eastward, is Sarmatia Asiatica, on the North abutting on the vnknowne parts of the earth, on the South with the Euxine sea, and a line drawne right from thence to the Caspian sea. Scythia is by Ptol.l.6.c.14. him placed to the East of Sarmatia, diuided by the hill Imaus, exten∣ding vnto the region called Serica, hauing on the North vnknowne places; on the South, the Sacae, Sogdiana, Margiana and India. But our purpose is to take them here
in their more generall sense, vnderstanding all the North parts of Asia, now Tartaria Asiatica, (for of Europe, sauing wherein the Europaean Scythians agree with the Asi∣an, we are not now to speake:) And of these, first to consider their ancient Scythian rites, and in the next place their later Tartarian appellation and religion. Iustin Iustin.lib.2. out of Trogus relateth the arguments vsed of the Egyptians and Scythians, each seeking to challenge to themselues, to be the ancientest of Nations, in which quarrell the Scythians preuailed. Their manners and customes he thus reporteth. They haue no limitation of lands, nor tillage, nor house, but alwayes wander thorow places not inhabited, feeding their heards and flockes. They carry their wiues and children with them on carts, which also being couered with hides, they vse for houses. No of∣fence is more hainous amongst them then theft: gold & siluer they as much contemne, as others desire. Milke and hony is their food; their cloathes, skins of beasts, for the vse of wooll they know not. They haue three times sought the Empire of Asia, neuer con∣quered of others. They chased Darius the Persian King out of their coasts: they slew Cyrus with all his army: they ouerthrew Zopyron a Captaine of Alexander the Great with all his forces. They only heard of, neuer felt the Roman armes, and themselues founded the Parthian Empire. That which credulous & fabulous antiquitie hath reported, of the monstrous peoples inhabiting the Northerly and vnknowne parts of Scythia, is not heere to be recited, the countries being at this time discouered, and knowne to haue no such men, as either by nature are balde and flat nosed, with huge chins; or haue but one eye, where there are also Gryphons keepers of their treasures, or men with goats feet: or other monsters of men, which Pliny, Plin.lib.7. Solinus cap.20. Herodotus and others, haue rather mentioned then beleeued; Man∣deuil and Munster following them in like relations. Next to these both in place and credit, we may reckon the Hyperboreans, of whom the Delians Herod.lib.4. Pius secundus in historie Asiae, confuteth this tale. report that they sent to Delos virgins with sacrifice to Lucina, bound vp in wheat-straw: through so many nations inhabiting betweene. Of the Issedones is reported, that when one dieth, his kindred bring thither beasts, which they kill, and cut, and dresse, and eat together with the flesh of the dead man, whose skull also they keepe and gilde, vsing it as an idoll, to which they performe yearely ceremonies: mese exequies doth the sonne there per∣forme to his dead father. Generally of the Scythian religion thus. Of the gods, they worship first Vesta, whome they call in their language Tabits: next of all Iupiter, in their speech Papeus, and the Earth supposing her to be the wife of Iupiter, and call her Apia. In the next place they worship Apollo and Venus, by the names of Oetosyrus, and Artimpasa, and Mars and Hercules. Some of them sacrifice also to Neptune or Thamimasades. Images, Altars and Temples, they thinke ought not to be made, ex∣cept to Mars. Their manner of sacrificing is generally this: The sacrifice is presented with the fore-feet bound, the Sacrificer at his backe hauing laid aside his holy vest∣ment, woundeth the same, and while it falleth, calls vpon that god to whom he sacri∣ficeth; and then putteth a halter about the necke, and strangleth it, without kindling any fire, or vowing, or other ceremony, and flayeth it; the flesh plucked from the bones, he casteth into a great Caldron, the bones he vseth for fewell to seeth the same (for wood the countrie doth not yeeld:) And if they haue not any such vessell, they put all the flesh with water into the paunch, and so the beast doth seeth it selfe. After it is boyled, he which sacrificed offereth the libaments, or offerings of the flesh and and in∣wards: their sacrifices are, besides other beasts, especially of horses. Their Temples to Mars they builde on this manner. Scythian Tem∣ples. They heape together bundles of twigs three furlongs in length and bredth, & aboue on them is made a square plaine, three sides thereof are vpright, the fourth is made slope, and bending-wise thereby to get vp: thither they bring euery yeare an hundred and fifty waines of twigs to supply the waste of them. Vnderneath this work is erected an old iron sword, and this is their image of Mars, to which they offer yearly sacrifices, both of other cattel and of horses: and more to this blade then to other gods. Of their captiues they offer one of an hun∣dred, but after another manner. For after they haue offered wine on their heads, they kill them by a certaine vessell, and after lifting them vpon that their heape or Temple,
they embrew the Sword-god with the bloud. This they doe aboue: beneath in the Temple they cut off all the right shoulders of the slaine men, and hurle them vp in the aire together with the hands; wheresoeuer the hand shall fall, there it lieth, and the dead bodie apart. When they haue performed all their solemnities they depart. Swine are so odious to them, that they will haue none of them nourished in their countrey. There are among them Diuiners, whose rites are these. Scythian di∣uination. They bring great bundles of willow twigges, which they lay on the ground, and vntie, and laying them asunder one by one, diuine. Some of them practise diuination with the leaues of the Teil∣tree, which they fold and vnfold in their hands. The King, when at any time he falleth sicke, sendeth for three choice men of those diuiners; who for the most part name some man vnto him, which hath forsworne himselfe, hauing sworne by the Kings throne, an oath vsed of the Scythians: presently the man is brought forth, who, if he denieth what their art hath accused him of, the King sendeth for twice the number of diuiners: or if they by new practise of their art finde him guiltie, his head is cut off, and the first diui∣ners share his goods: but if they shall absolue him, more diuiners are sent for; and if the most of them doe absolue him, then those three first are thus done to death. They lade a waine with twigges, and binding the diuiners hand and foot, and stopping their mouthes, cast them into the waines, and set all on fire, burning oxen waine and men together, vnlesse some of the oxen by the burning of their harnesse escape. This pu∣nishment inflict they on their false Prophets. They make their leagues with other na∣tions in this sort. They powre wine into a great bowle, mixing therewith the bloud of them which ioyne in league, cutting some part of the bodie with a knife or sword; and then dippe in that bowle or mazer a sword, arrowes, an axe, a dart, and after curse themselues with many words, last of all drinking the wine. Their Kings are buried amongst the Gerrh, with many ceremonies carrying the dead bodie through all the countries ouer which hee raigned, which cut and shaue themselues; and with him is buried his best beloued Paramour, his Cup-bearer, Cook, Master of his horse, Waiter, Messenger, Horses, and the first fruits of all other things, and also golden cuppes: and then cast on earth, making a very great hill. When the yeare is gone about, they take fiftie of his principall attendants, which are not slaues, but free-borne Scythians, and strangle them with so many horses of the best, and fasten the dead men on the dead horses with much solemnitie. But to relate all the particulars hereof, and their burialls also of priuate men (whose dead bodies are carried about fortie dayes, from one friend to another, entertained euery where with feastes, &c.) would be too tedious. The Scythians so farre hate forren rites and religions, that Anacharsis, a Scythian Philosopher, hauing trauelled through a great part of the world, and vowed to the mother of the gods, if he returned home in safetie, that he would sacrifice to her with such rites as hee had seene obserued in Cyzicus: in the performance of his vow, was slaine by King Saulius. Scyles Ph.Camerar. Med. hist. Cent.1.58. yet tho Turkes (their of-spring) hold diuers religions. also being King of the Scythians, when he brought in forren rites, and ob∣serued the madde Bacchanal solemnities, which he had seene among the Greekes, lost both his kingdome and life. Athenaeus lib.12. cap 8. They cut off the noses of men, and imprinted pictures in the flesh of women, whom they ouercame: and generally their customes of Herodot lib.4. warre were bloudie: what man soeuer the Scythian first taketh, he drinketh his bloud: he of∣fereth to the King all the heads of the men he hath slaine in battell: otherwise he may not share in the spoile: the skinnes of their crownes flaied off, they hang at their horse bridles: Plin.lib.7.c.2. their skinnes they vse to stay for napkins and other vses, and some, for cloa∣thing. Once a yeare the chiefe men haue a solemnitie amongst them, in which they powre wine into a Mazor, of which none may drinke, which hath not slaine an enemy. These customes were generall to the Scythians in Europe and Asia (for which cause Poly.hist.l.9. Scytharum facinor a patrare, grew into a prouerbe of immane crueltie, and their Land was iustly called Barbara nec Scythiae tellus, &c. T. bul.lib.3. Barbarous): Others were more speciall and peculiar to particular nations Scythian. Of the Barbarous A.Mar.l.22. crueltie of the Scythians, the sea confining was called Euxinus,
by the contrary, as the furies were called Eumenides, saith Ammianus, because they sa∣crificed strangers to Diana, whom they worshipped vnder the name of Orsiloche, and hanged vp their heads on the walls of their Temples. The Ile Leuce, neere to Taurica, was dedicated to Achilles, where none of his deuout worshippers durst abide in the night time; for none might spend the night on shore without danger of his life. The Massagetae Strab. lib.11. famous for the ouerthrow of Cyrus, esteeme the Sunne alone for GOD, and offer vnto him a horse. They haue one wife to each man, and yet euery one vseth also his neighbours wife openly, hanging meane while his quiuer on the waine or cart: The best death and most happy amongst them, is, when they are become old, to be cut in pieces, and to be eaten together with sheeps flesh: if he die naturally, they burie him in the earth, as dying a base and beastly Ioan. Boem. death. Their weapons are of brasse, their furniture of gold, of both which they haue much store, little of iron & siluer. Caelius lib.11. cap.21. The Bactrians, when they were old or worne with sicknesse, cast their parents to dogges, which they kept for this purpose, and called Buriall dogges. The Bactrian women are pompous, Euseb. de prae∣par. Eng.lib.6. cap.8. riding in great state, and lie with their seruants, and with strangers. They haue among them Brachmanes; Zoroastres the Bactrian is accounted first author of the Magi, and of liberall Artes: he liued twenty yeares in a wildernesse with cheese. The Sacae sometimes made neerer, sometimes further inuasions: they possessed Ba∣ctria, and a great part of Armenia, which after of them was called Sacasena, and pro∣ceeded vnto Cappadocia, where, in the middest of their feastings, being in the night surprised by the Persians, and slaine, they left their name Saca or Sacea to a yearely so∣lemnitie among the Persians in memory of this victory. Of the Sacae, some hold Gorop. Beeces. our Saxons to be descended. The Amazons, of whom is before related, are said Iustin.lib.2. to be descended of the Scythi∣ans, who vnder the conduct of Plinos and Scolpythus, setled themselues by the Riuer Thermodon, and possessed the field of Themiscyra: But when they continued to spoile the adioyning countries, they were by secret conspiracie of those people destroyed. Their wiues Goop thinks and I with him that these A∣mazons were but the wiues which exerci∣sed armes, and followed war∣fare with their husbands. became warriours both in defence and offence, and did great acts vn∣der their two Queenes, Marthesia and Lampedo: after Ohera and Antiope the daugh∣ters of Marthesia, in the time of Hercules raigned: then Penthesilea, who in the Troian warres was slaine. Yet the reliques of that nation continued vntill Minthia or Thale∣slris in Alexanders time; and by degrees ware out altogether. One of their Queenes instituted the sacrifice to Mars and Diana called Tauropolium, saith Diodorus, Diodor. Sic. lib.2. cap.11. who addeth that they liued not without men, but that they put the men to domestike drud∣geries, and exercised the women in the field. Yet doth he no lesse then Strabo make doubt of these Amazonian, or Vnimammian Nation The Ama∣zons are still o ation further then the relaters or their authors haue trauel∣led in two places of Asia, two of Africa, two of Ameri∣ca: the Ama∣zon haue bin, till th  came there and found none. : and no lesse of the Hyperbo∣rean, which he thus relateth out of Hecataeus, that they dwell in an Iland in the Ocean neere vnto the Pole, in which Latona was borne, and Apollo was most of all worship∣ped: and that the Ilanders generally are Apolloes Priests, euery day chaunting Hymnes in his praise: they haue also a huge groue, and a round Temple dedicated to Apollo, to whom their Citie is sacred. These and other things fable they of the Hyperborei, to which Solinus Sol.r. addeth many other, of the clemencie of the aire, of the innocencie of the men, of their freedome from sicknes, and voluntary seeking for death in the fulnesse of dayes (after they haue made merry, casting themselues from a certaine rocke into the sea) all these pleasures concurring notwithstanding; things contrary both to truth and Nature, except with Goropius Gorp. Bec. lib.9.pag.1032. we turned some parts, at least, of this historie into an allegory. He yet historically interpreteth, that they which placed the Hyperborei be∣yond the Arimaspi, these beyond the Issedones, and those also beyond the Scythians, and these againe beyond the Cimmerians, intended the Europaean Scythians, or inha∣bitants about Maeotis, the Liuonians and Muscouites: the Issedones to be in Scandia, and all alongst those frozen or Icie seas, as he proueth by Etimologie of the word: North-east, and Eastwards from these in the continent of Asia he placeth the Arimaspi, and in the continent of America Mexicana he seateth the Hyperborei: They which list may haue recourse to his learned discourses of this argument. The Scythians punished Aex. ab. ∣ex. lib.3.cap.11. no fault more seuerely then theft. They would make them∣selues

We might proceed further in these cold Scythian narrations, if the deepe snowes, long deserts, beastly men, and man-kind beasts, men-eaters, and other monstrous ad∣uentures in the way, did not make it both perplexed and dangerous.

THe names of Scythia and Sarmtia, are now together with those Nati∣ons swallowed vp and drowned in that Tartarian deluge, which about foure hundred yeares since with a sudden torrent ouerwhelmed the greatest part of Asia, that we speake not of Europe, the heart whereof, quaked & trembled with feare of this tempest. From Rome did Pope Vincent. Bel∣luac. spec.bist.lib.30. Innocent the fourth send Ambassadors, by entreaties to preuent their armes, when as they had already ouer-runne (besides those countries which still beare their name) Russia, Polonia, Slesia, Moraui, Hungaria, euen as farre as 2 . So farre was the huge vnwealdy Empire of Alexander, or of the Romans, short of the Tartarian geatnes, that the expedition of some one Bath. of the subiects of this Empire, hath pierced as farre into the West, as euer Alexander into the East, and that happily among more re∣solute courages, then the Persians or Indians, effeminated with wealth & peace, could afford: and Tamerlane alone some ages after (if we credit that history Arab. of the life of Tamerlane. of his life, trans∣lated out of the Arbike) subdued and obtained more (besides his owne inheritance) then all that which the Romans had archieued in that eight hundred yeares and vp∣wards, wherein their Empire was growing to the full; but of him afterwards. The name Tartar is proper to a riuer in Mongul, from whence it was deriued to the people inhabiting neere the same, which after gaue both name & lawes to so great a part of the world. For thus writeth Ioannes Io. de Plan Carpini. apud Hak. tom.1. de Plan Carp, which was sent embassa∣dour
to the Tartarian Court, from Pope Innocent, An.1246. There is a countrey in the East part of the world called Mongol: which had sometimes foure sorts of inhabitants: Yeka-Mongol, that is, the great Mongols; Sungol. that is, water-Mongols; these cal∣led thēselues Tartars Totaros vo∣cant.id est, exu∣es. Mercat. , of a Riuer which runneth thorow their coūtrey named Tartar: the third Merkat, the fourth Metrit. These all were alike in person and language, but diuided amongst themselues into seuerall Prouinces, and vnto seuerall Princes. In the land of Yeka-Mongol, was Chingis secund. Vincentium in Spec. hist. Can∣gius, Haitono. See Lud. Reg. Lampadius in mellific. &c. Niceph. Greg. hist. Rom lib.2. calls him Zit∣zischan. Cyngis, who began to be a mightie hunter before the LORD: for he learned to steale men. He raunged into other countries, taking as many cap∣tiues as he could, and ioyned them vnto himselfe. Also he allured the men of his owne countrey vnto him, who followed him as their ring-leader to doe mischiefe. Then be∣gan he to warre vpon the Sumongols or Tartars, and slew their captaine, and after ma∣ny conflicts-subdued them to himselfe, and brought them all into bondage. Afterward he vsed their helpe against the Merkats, whom also he vanquished in battell. Procee∣ding from thence, hee fought against the Metrites, and vanquished them also. The Naiman hearing that Cyngis was thus exalted, greatly disdained thereat: for they had a great and mightie Emperour, vnto whom all the foresaid nations paid tribute. Whose sons (when he was dead) succeeded him in his Empire. Howbeit, being yong and foo∣lish, they knew not how to gouerne the people, but were diuided, and fell at variance among themselues. These inuaded Cyngis his countrey, putting the inhabitants to the sword, but were after ouerthrowne by the Mongols, & either slaine or made captiues. Some G. Botero Ben. fetch the Tartarian pedegree from the ten Tribes of Israel, which Salmana∣sar carried captiues: and in their Mappes Ortel. Theat. place hordes of Danites, Nephthalites, &c. in the furthest Northerly and Easterly bounds of Asia; which yet are a great part of the world, not onely from Media (whither those people were conueyed) but from any part of the Assyrian Empire. (The King of Tabor, or Tybur, in these parts, is said to haue come into France, to Francis the French King, about the yeare 1540, and was after at Mantua by Charles the Emperour burned, for secret sollicitation of him and other Christian Princes to Iudaisme.) And Opmeerus Opmeer. Chr. in An. M.3413. reporteth of that their iourney passing thorow Euphrates, miraculously staying his streame (to wonder at the vanitie of Writers) when they went into a region called Aisarich, which was a yeare and a halfes trauell, there to keepe their law; where neuer before had beene any habitation. M. Panlus Cap.42.apud Ram. (the La∣tine copy of M. Paul. is ve∣ry vnperfect) G. Mercat. tab. vn. who with his father and vncle liued many yeares in the Court of the great Cham, aboue three hundred yeares since, saith that they dwelled at first (if such wandring may be so called) in the North, where they had no Lord ouer them, but paid tribute to a great Signor (there called Vncam, and heere in these countries Presbiter Iohn) to whom they paid the tenth of their beasts. But this Vncam or Presbiter Iohn fearing their numbers euery where multiplying, deuised to disperse them through the world: which the Tartars perceiuing, with ioynt consent forsooke their former habi∣tation, & departed thence far off into the North, denying further tribute vnto Vncam. After they had there continued a certaine time, they chose to their King about the yeare 1162 one which was calld Cingis Can, who ruled them with such modestie and iustice, that they loued and feared him as a god, his fame reducing all the other Tar∣tars in other parts vnder his obedience. He thus strengthened, weary of those deserts, commanded them to arme themselues with bowes, and other weapons, and began to inuade and conquer Cities and Prouinces to his subiection, the principall inhabitants whereof he carried with him, kindly entertaining them, leauing such discreet Gouer∣nours in the same, that the people were secured in their persons and goods. When he had thus subdued about nine Prouinces, he sent his ambassador to Vncam sub∣dued. Vncam, to demand his daughter in mariage which Vncam with much indignation and many threatnings denying, Cingis assembling his forces marched against him, and by the way enquired of his Astrologers and Diuiners touching his successe. They taking a greene reed, clet it asunder, placing the parts thereof a good distance one from another, and writ vpon the one the name of Vncam, and Cingis on the other; telling the King that whiles they were reading their coniuring charmes, these reeds would fight together, and the victo∣rie should remaine with him whose reed got the better: which accordingly came to
passe in the sight of the army: Cingis his reed ouercomming the other, as after Cingis himselfe did Vncam, whom he slew in the field, and possessed his daughter and state, wherein he continued sixe yeares conquering Cities and Kingdomes, and at last was wounded, at a Castle called Thaigin, in the knee, whereof he died, and was buried in mount Altay. The next Emperour (after his account) was Cyn Can the third, Bathyn Can the fourth, or Allan the brother of Mangu; Esu Can, the fifth, Mongu Can the sixth, Cubli Can who not only inherited what the former had conquered, but in the sixtieth yeare of his raigne subdued in a manner the rest of (those parts of) the world. The word Can signifieth Emperour. Where soeuer these Emperours die, they are buried in Altay afore∣said; they which carry him, killing all they meet within the way, bidding them goe to the other world to serue their Emperour. For this end they also slay the best horses, to serue their dead Lord in another world. When Mangu Can was buried, there were more then ten thousand men slaine by the souldiers which conueyed him. In this Hi∣story of M. Paul, obserue that this catalogue of Emperours is vnsound: for W. de Ru∣bruquis in Bathyes time, was at the Court of Mangu Can, to whom Bathy was subiect. Occoday is left out, and Es put in. The cause of this error seemeth to be the giuing of this name can to the chiefe Dukes, as Bathy, &c. and the want of exact written chro∣nicles in those times amongst them. For further light into this history, I thinke it not amisse to set downe what Haithon or Anthony the Armenian hath written of the Tartarian beginnings. This our Author was royally descended in Armenia, where he liued about three hundred yeares since, and at the request of Pope Clement the 5, writ the history of the Tartars, from Cingis or Cangius til Mango Can, taken out of the Tartarian histories: the rest he partly saw with his eyes, & partly learned of his vncle, an eie-witnes of the same, who had attended on Haython the Armenian King, in the great Chas Court. The countrey where the Tar∣tars first dwelt (saith The Tartars Legend of Cangius.Hait. Armen. Haithon) is beyond the mount Belgian, where they liued like beasts, hauing neither letters nor faith, nor habitation, nor souldiourie, nor reputation among their neighbor-nations. There were of them diuers nations, called by one com∣mon name Mogli, which were diuided into seuen principal tribes, whose names were Tatar, Tangut, Cunat, Talair, Sonich, Monghi, Tebeth. These all being subiects to their neighbours, a poore old man being a Smith (who as they beleeue, was ingendered of the Sun-beames) saw in his sleep an armed man on a white horse, which said vnto him, O Cangius, The will of the immortall GOD is that thou be the Gouernour of the Tar∣tarians, and Ruler of the seuen nations, to free them from their bondage and tribute. This his vision, when he reported to others, they would not beleeue him, vntil that the night following, the chiefe men amongst thēselues saw the same man, with command from the immortall GOD, to yeeld obedience vnto Cangius. This they performed with all reuerence, and spread in the midst of them a black felt, with a seat theron, on which the seuen Princes or chiefe men placed Cangius, calling him Can, that is, Emperour, and kneeled before him. This happily was then the most sumptuous throne A felt the Tartarian throne in their coronation. their State could afford, but continued in the royall inuestiture of their succeeding Soue∣raignes, their exceeding riches and conquests notwithstanding: at two of which so∣lemnities (saith our Author) I my selfe haue beene present. Cangius thus inthronized on his felt, commanded them many things: first to beleeue the immortall GOD: and from thence forwards, the Tartars beganne to call vpon the name of the immortall GOD, seeking for his aide in all their enterprises. Secondly, he commanded to make a generall view of all such as were able to beare armes, appointing Captaines ouer tennes, ouer thousands, and ouer ten thousands, which made a full regiment. Hee commanded also those seuen principall heads of their Tribes, to bereaue themselues of their dignities, and for further triall of their obedience, each of them to bring thi∣ther his eldest sonne, and to cut off his head each with his owne hand: which they re∣fused not to doe, in reuerence to that Diuine ordinance, whereby he was made their Soueraigne. Cangius hauing thus made triall of their fidelitie, subdued many Nations: and one day hauing his horse slaine in battell vnder him, was forsaken of his Tartars,
despairing his recouery after they saw him fall, and might easily haue beene slaine, had not his enemies through ignorance neglected him, to pursue the rest: which Cangius perceiuing, conueyed himselfe into a thicket of shrubbes: and when his enemies re∣turned to despoile the dead, an Owle came and sate on the shrubbe, vnder which Cangius was hidden, which caused them not to suspect any to lurke there, and so they departed. He the next night fled to his people; who seeing him, and hearing the or∣der of his escape, gaue thankes to the immortall GOD, who by meanes of that bird had preserued him. They also had (after this) that The Owle obserued. fowle in such reuerence, that it is accounted a happie thing to weare one of her fethers on their heads. Cangius after∣wards assaulting his enemies, brought vnder, both them, and all the countries on that side of Belgian. The exact time of these things Haithon could not learne, not∣withstanding his much inquirie: which hee imputeth to their want of letters at that time. These countries thus conquered, the armed man appeared to him the second time, and commanded him in the name of the immortall GOD to passe the mountaine Bel∣gian, and go toward the West, where he should conquer Kingdomes, Seignories and Lands. And that thou mayest be assured that this is the will of GOD, arise and goe with thy people towards the mountaine, to that part which ioyneth on the sea: There thou shalt dismount, and turne thee toward the East, and kneeling downe nine times, shalt worshippe the immortall GOD, and he which is Almightie shall shew thee the way by which thou mayest commodiously passe. Cangius presently commands his people with their wiues and families to accompany him in this enterprise; and when they were come to the sea, forgate not with his followers to performe those nine wor∣ships; and staying there that night in his prayers, the next day he saw that the sea had gone nine foote backe from the Mountaine, and left a spacious way, by which they with all their substance passed, Westward. Hence it is that the Tartars ascribe some happinesse to the number of nine: and he that will offer a present to any Tartarian Sig∣nor, must offer nine things The number of nine. , which custome they vse in their tributes vnto this day, as Master Ienkinson found by experience to his cost. Cangius after many aduentures, and many lawes which of him were called Iasack Cangis Can, hauing first perswaded his twelue sonnes (wherein I thinke his nephews were also reckoned) to concord, bidding each of them to bring him an arrow, which together, none of them; asunder, the least of them might easily breake, he died. This Historie of Cingis or Cangius I haue thus fully related, for knowledge both of the beginnings of their: State and Religion: and if these visions seeme fabulous, yet might Cingis in his subtiltie deale with them, as Mahomet with his Arabi∣ans, or Numa with the Romans; the one making Gabriel, the other Aegeria, authors of their policies: and what hee in part pretended, might by Fame and Time bee augmented. Although I see not, but that this Historie of Cingis may as well bee credited, as that of Alexander, in Iosephus, to whome appeared one in the habite of the Iewish High Priest, commaunding him to vndertake that enterprise, with promise of assistance, for which cause, hee whom the world worshipped as a King, and as a god, did worshippe, Antiq.lib.11. himselfe prostrate before Iadad the High Priest. And the same Ios. Antiq.lib.2.in sine. Author also saith, that the Pamphylian sea diui∣ded it selfe to giue way vnto his Macedonian souldiers, hauing no other way to de∣stroy the Empire of the Persians. To returne to our Frier with whom we began; he reporteth Io.de Plano arpini. that Cingis, after his victory against the Naimani, warred vpon the Kythayans, but were ouerthrowne, and all the Nobles, except seuen, slaine. Hauing breathed himselfe a while at home, he inua∣ded the Huyria Christian people of the Nestorian sect, whom they ouercame, & recei∣ued of thē letters, of which before they were ignorāt. After thē, he subdued the Saroyur, Kaanites, & Hudirat. This done, he waged war against the Kythayans or Cathayans, whose Emperour he shut vp into his chiefe City, where Cyngis besieged him, till that victual failing in his Camp, he commanded that they should eat euery tenth man of the army. They of the City fought valiantly with engines, darts, arrowes: and when stones
wanted, they threw Siluer, especially molten Siluer. But by vndermining, the Tartars made way from the Armie into the middest of the Citie, where they issued vp, and ope∣ned the gates by force, and slew the Citizens. This is the first time that the Emperour of the Kythayans being vanquished, Cyngis Cham obtained the Empire. The men of Kytay Kytayans; & their Religion. are Pagans, hauing a speciall kinde of writing by themselues, and, as it is re∣ported, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament. They haue also recorded in Histories the liues of their fore-fathers, and they haue Eremites, and certaine houses made after the manner of our Churches, which, in those dayes, they greatly resorted vnto. They say, that they haue diuerse Saints also, and they worship one GOD. They adore and reuerence CHRIST IESVS our LORD, and beleeue the Article of e∣ternall life, but are not baptized. They doe also honorably esteeme and reuerence our Scriptures. They loue Christians, and bestow much almes, and are a very courteous and gentle people. They haue no beards, and they agree partly with the Mongals in the disposition of their countenance. There are not better artificers in the world. Their Countrey is exceeding rich in Corne, Wine, Gold, Silke, and other Commodities. After the conquest of Cathay, cyngis sent his sonne Thossut Can (for so they tearmed him also) against the people of Comania, whome he vanquished. Another sonne hee sent against the Indians, who subdued India Minor. These Indians are the blacke Sa∣racens Blacke Sa∣racens. , which are also called Aethiopians. Thence he marched to fight against Chri∣stians, dwelling in India Maior, whose King was commonly called Presbyter Iohn, who by a stratageme repelled them out of his dominion. In trauelling homewards, the said Armie of the Mongals came vnto the Land of Buirthabeth, the inhabitants whereof are Pagans, and conquered the people in bartaile. This people haue a strange custome; when any mans father dieth, he assembleth all his kindred, and they eat him. They haue no beards, but with an yron Instrument plucke out the haires, if any grow. Cyngis himselfe went vnto the Land of Kergis, which they then conquered not. And in his returne home his people suffered extreame famine: and by chaunce finding the fresh entrailes of a beast, they cast away the dung, sodde it, and brought it before cyngis, and did eate thereof. Hereupon Cyngis enacted, That neither the bloud, nor the en∣trailes, nor any other part of a beast, which might be eaten, should be cast away, saue onely the dung. He was afterward slaine by a thunderclap, leauing behind him foure sonnes; the first Occoday, the second Thossut can, the third Thiaday, the name of the fourth is not knowne. Cyngis being dead, Occoday Occoday 2 Tart.Imp. was chosen Emperor. He sent Duke Bathy his nephew, the sonne of Thossut can, against the Countrey of Altisoldan, and the people called Bisermini, who were Saracens, but spake the Language of Comania, whome he subdu∣ed. Thence they marched against Orna, a Port Towne on the Riuer Don, where were many Gazarians, Alanians, Russians, and Saracens, which he drowned with the Riuer running through the Citie, turning it out of the chanell. Thence they passed into Rus∣sia, and made foule hauocke there, destroying Kiou, the chiefe Citie. They proceeded against the Hungarians and Polonians, and in their returne inuaded the Morduans, being Pagans, and conquered them in battaile. Then they marched against the people called Byleri, or Bulgaria magna, and vtterly wasted the Countrey. From hence they proceeded towards the North against the people called Bastarci, or Hungaria magna, and hauing conquered them, subdued also the Parossitae and Samogetae, thence pro∣ceeding vnto the Ocean Sea. At the same time Occoday sent cyrpodan against Kergis The Kergis , who subdued them in battaile. These are Pagans, hauing no beards at all. They haue a custome, when any of their fathers die, in token of lamentation, to draw (as it were) a Leather thong ouerthwart their faces, from one eare to the other. Hence hee marched with his forces Southward against the Armenians, which they conquered, with part of Georgia, receiuing tribute of the other part; and from thence into the Do∣minions of the mightie Soldan, called Deurum, whome they vanquished in sight. And to be short, they went on further, sacking and conquering euen vnto the Soldan of A∣leppo, whose Countries they subdued. They marched against the Caliph of Baldach,
and exacted at his hands the daily tribute of foure hundred Byzantines, besides Bal∣dakines, and other gifts. Thus farre of their Conquests out of Frier Iohn a∣foresaid, who was in person with Bathy, or Baydo, and at the Court of Guine the Emperour. Haython Haithon Ar∣men. calleth Baydo the second sonne of Ocoday, or Hoccota Can, affirming, That he sent his three sonnes; Iochi into the West, as farre as Tygris; Baydo towards the North, and Chagoday towards the South. He sent also one Baydo (whether the same, or another) with thirtie thousand horse, against the Soldan of the Turkes, whose Realme he subdued in the yeare 1244. He addeth, That Baydo hauing conquered Cu∣mania Cumania. , (which he confineth on the East with the Corasmians, on the West with the Euxine, on the North with Cassia, happily Casan, on the South with the Riuer Etil) he subdued Russia, Gazaria, Bulgaria, and so passing into Austria, following the streame of his victories, in the passage of a great streame was there drowned. His heires suc∣ceeded him in the places which he had conquered; which Seignorie Tochay possessed in Haithons time. This Historie of Baydo his death is not likely: For Yvo of Narbona, in an Epistle to the Archbishop of Burdeaux, recorded by Mat. Paris. Mat. Paris in the yeare 1243, sayth, That in the same present Summer they had departed out of Hungarie, and layd siege to Neustat, wherein this Yvo then was: and in the yeare 1246, Frier Iohn was with the said Baydo, who also rehearseth that Hungarian Expedition, and his re∣turne vnto those parts about Volga, or Etil. Likewise William de Rubi uquis, a Frier Mi∣norite, was sent to Baatu (so he calleth him) from Lewes the French King, in An. 1253. And to this agreeth Mathias à Michon Mat. à Michou.de Sarmat. lib.1. in his Sarmatian Historie, who witnesseth, That in the yeare 1241 the Tartars, vnder Bathu, came into Russia, & destroyed Kiou, a Citie before stately and beautifull, hauing in it three hundred Churches and more, very faire, of which some remaine to this day among the shrubbes and bryers, recep∣tacles for wilde beasts. It was the Seat of the Metropolitan, who had vnder him many Bishops through Moldauia, Valachia, Russia, and Muscouia. He sent Peta into Polo∣nia, who destroyed the Countrey, and on Ashwednesday turned Cracouia into ashes, abandoned before both of the Prince and People; and after ouerthrew Duke Henrie, and other Noblemen, with the forces of the Countrey assembled against them, toge∣ther with Pompo, the great Master of the Dutch Order in Prussia: in which battaile, a certaine Tartarian Standard-bearer, carrying in a great Standard the Greeke letter X, and on the top of the staffe a blacke and terrible Image, with a long beard, began Tartarian Sorcerie. with inchantment strongly to shake the head of the Image: whereupon a smoake and cloud of intolerable stinke was presently dispersed ouer the Polonians, & they became heart∣lesse and vnable to fight. Duke Henrie and Duke Boleslan and Pompo, with the flower of their Nobilitie, was here slaine, and the Countrey miserably spoyled. From hence they went into Morauia, where they put all to fire and sword more then a moneth to∣gether: and thence to Hungarie to Bathy, who entred Hungarie with 500000 souldi∣ors; where first ouerthrowing those forces which King Bela had sent to prohibit them passage, they after chased the King himselfe, with the power of his Kingdome oppo∣sing himselfe against them, out of the field, who fled into Austria, and after into Sclauo∣nia, leauing his Countrey a prey to the Tartars: who making spoile on that side of Da∣nubius, the next Winter passed ouer the Riuer, then frozen, & filled all with bloud and slaughter. Bathy sent Cadan to pursue the King into Scalauonia, still fleeing before him, who wasted Bosna, Seruia, and Bulgaria. And after two yeares sackage in Hungarie, they passed by the fennes of Maeotis into Tartaria, and happily had returned to make fresh spoyles in Europe, if the Embassage of Pope Innocent had not diuerted their pur∣pose: or rather, that Occoday, their great Cham, being about that time poysoned, they were to expect a new Commission from his successor, which was Cuine; who when he was installed, euen in the presence of Frier Io.de Plano C. Iohn, the Popes Legat, erected a Banner against all Kingdomes of the Christians, except they would be subiect to him: for their intent was to subdue all the world, as Cyngis Cham had ordained; and the superscrip∣tion of his Seale was, GOD in Heauen, and Cuine Cham vpon Earth, the strength of GOD, the Scale of the Emperour of all men.
But Cuine Cuine 3 Imp. Mangu 4. in short time after died, and left the Empire to Mangu Can; to whome Aytonus Haitonus de Tart. the Armenian King went voluntarily in person, about the yeare 1257, and receiuing gracious entertainement, made vnto him seuen petitions: first, That he and his people should become Christians: secondly, That there should bee perpetuall peace betweene the Tartars and Christians: thirdly, That in all Countries conquered by the Tartars, the Churches and Clergie-men of the Christians should be free from seruitude and tribute: fourthly, That he would redeeme the Holy Sepulchre and the Holy Land from the Saracens: fifthly, That he would destroy the Caliph of Baldack: sixtly, That himselfe might haue aid, as need should require, in his defence, of such Tartars as were neere vnto Armenia: seuenthly, That such parts of Armenia which the Saracens now possessed, and the Tartars should recouer from them, might, returne to the Crowne of Armenia. Mangu-can answered, after deliberation with his Nobles, to the first, That himselfe would be a Christian, and persuade other his subiects, but force none thereunto: and to the rest in order, that his requests in all should be fulfil∣led, and to that end he would send his brother Haolon into those parts, as is before al∣readie shewed. Thus was Mangu baptized by a Bishop, then Chauncellor of Arme∣nia, and all his household, and many Nobles of both sexes. But before Ierusalem could be recouered, Mangu died, and Cobila, or Cublai Cublai 5. Imp. Can succeeded, in whose time M. Paulus M.Paul.l.2. was an eye-witnesse of the Tartarian proceedings, who affirmeth, That this Cublas exceeded in power, not his predecessours onely, but all the Kingdomes of Christians and Saracens, although they were ioyned in one. Before he obtained the Soueraignetie, he shewed himselfe a valiant souldior: but after he was Emperour, he neuer fought field but once against Naians his vncle, who was able, out of the Pro∣uinces wherein he gouerned, to bring together foure hundred thousand Horse, to whome Caidu should haue added a hundred thousand Horse more. These both con∣spired against their Master and Lord Cublai: but before their forces were ioyned, Cublai stopping the passages, that none might passe to carrie newes, suddenly assem∣bled, within tenne dayes iourney of Cambalu, three hundred and threescore thousand horse, and a hundred thousand footmen. An. 1286. With this power riding day and night, hee came suddenly on his enemies, and hauing first consulted with his Diuiners, after their manner, gaue the on-set, and tooke Naiam prisoner, whome he strangled betwixt two Carpets, least the Earth should drinke, or the Sunne should see the bloud of that impe∣riall familie. Naiam had beene secretly baptized, and now also had the Crosse for his Banner, which occasioned the Iewes and Saracenes to scoffe at the Christians: but Cublai vnderstanding hereof, called them all before him, & said, That the Crosse would not helpe such wicked men as Naiam, who was a Traitor to his Lord; say yee not therefore, that the GOD of the Christians is vniust, to forsake his followers; for he is the chiefe Bountie and Iustice. Cublai by his Captaines conquered the Kingdomes of Mien, Bengala, Mangi, &c. After M.P. l.2.c.. Tamor 6. Cublas Can succeeded Tamor Can sonne to Cingis, the eldest sonne of Cublai: in whose time, Haithon (which then liued) sayth, That there were besides, three great Tartarian Princes, but subiect to the great Can: Chapar, which ruled in Turquestan, who was able to bring into the Field foure hundred thousand horsemen armed: Hoch∣tay, in the Kingdome of Cumania, who was able to arme sixe hundred thousand horse∣men to the warres, but not so resolute as the former. Carbauda, the third, ruled in Tau∣ris, able to assemble an Armie of three hundred thousand horse, well prouided. And all these liued in the Westerne bounds of the Tartarian Empire, euery way inferior in wealth and numbers to the Southerly and Easterly parts thereof.
CHAP. X. A Continuation of the Tartarian Historie, and the question discussed, whether Cathay and China be the same. SInce this Tamor Can, wee haue not so continued a Historie of their Empire and Emperours as before, and yet we haue had succeeding te∣stimonies a long time of their State and Magnificence, but neither so diligent obseruers, nor so exact Writers as the former: besides that, their Histories seeme in some things more fabulous. Of this later sort are Odoricus Odoricus ap. Hak. , a Frier, which liued three yeares in the Emperours Court, and trauelled as farre as Quinsay, who died in the yeare 1331; Sir Iohn Mandeuile Sir Iohn Mandeuile. our Countreyman spent many yeares in those Countries a few yeares af∣ter Odoricus, and writ the Historie of his Trauels in the Reigne of Edward the third of England, Echint Can being then Emperour of the Tartars: in which, if many things seeme not worthie credit, yet are they such as Odoricus, or some others, not of the worst Authors, had before committed to writing, and happily be others after his time, in those dayes when Printing wanted, foisted into his booke. Once, he setteth downe the distances and passages of Countries so exactly, as I thinke hee could not then haue learned but by his owne Trauels. After his time Nic. di Conti. ap. Ramus. Nicholo di Conti, a Vene∣tian, trauelled through India and Cathay, after fiue & twentie yeares returning home: and going to Eugenius the fourth, then Pope, to be absolued, because he had denied the Christian Faith to saue his life, his enioyned penance was, truly to relate to Poggius the Popes Secretarie his long peregrination: This was in the yeare 1444. About the same time Ios. Barbar. Iosafa Barbar, a Venetian, in the yeare 1436, had learned of a Tartarian Embassadour (which had beene at Cambalu, and returning by Tana, was entertained of the said Iosafat) some particulars touching the great Cham and Cathay, some part whereof he heard after confirmed by the mouth of Vsun-cassan, the mightie Persian King, in the yeare 1474: So that from the yeare 1246 thus farre we haue a continued succession of the Cathayan Historie, besides that which an Arabian hath written in his Historie of Tamerlane, now extant in English. I am the more curious in naming these Authors, least any should thinke that which is written of this people to be fabulous (all these, in a manner, concurring in the most substantiall things) or should confound, as diuerse Ludouicus Reg. Literae Iaponicae. cantugo Con∣tughi in Thes. Polit. part. 4. &c. lately haue done, the Countries and Affaires of China and Cathay. The cause of both these errours is, because that in these last hundred yeares and more, in which more of the World then euer before hath beene discouered, yet nothing of moment is found out of this Countrey or People. Whereunto may be answered. That since, diuers of the great Tartarian Lords, before subiects to the great Cham, hauing made themselues absolute Lords of their seuerall States, the way hath not beene so open to passe, being otherwise of it selfe exceeding∣ly both long, difficult, and dangerous: and the adioyning Princes recouering them∣selues from Tartarian seruitude, will neither suffer their owne to goe out, nor others freely to enter their Dominions; as the Muscouite, the King of China, and others. M. Ant. Hak. to. 1. pag. 303. Inkinson, which went as farre thither-ward as Bogharre, could not pafle further for warres in those parts. Neither haue any gone thither by Sea. And yet e∣uen in this time we haue not altogether wanted witnesses. Ludonicus L.Vertoman. Vertomannus, a hundred yeares since, in Bengala met with diuerse Christians, who affirmed, That there were in their Countrey diuers Signiors, Christians, subiect to the great Cham. These were white men, of a Citie called Sarnau. In M. Hakluits To. 1. pag. 336. & leq. painefull labours wee may reade of diuerse passages out of Russia and Persia by Caravans into Ca∣thay. Ramusius also, in his Annotations Ramusius. before M. Paulus, telleth of one Chaggai Me∣met, a Persian Marchant, who had beene at Campion and Succuir in Catay (Damircan
then raigning) and had acquainted him with diuerse particulars thereof. Also in the Epistle of Emanuel Car∣val. Epist. vide eadem ap. Pierre du Iarric, livre 4 de l'histoire des Inde Orient. c. 16. Emanuel Carualius, a Iesuite, dated at Malaca in Ianuarie, 1599, is contained the transcript of Ierome Xaverius his letter from Lahor, the Citie Royall of the great Mogor, dated August 1598. Wherein the Iesuite relateth, That whiles he was in conference with the Prince, there entred into the Pallace an old man of Mahomets Religion, threescore yeares of age, who affirmed to the Prince, That he had come from Xatai by the way of Mecca. Presently some which knew him, affir∣med, That he had distributed in almes a hundred thousand pieces of Gold at Mecca. The Prince asking if it were so, he affirmed, That he did it because he was old, & could not long liue, nor carrie those things away with him. Being demaunded of the state of Xatai, he answered, That he had there liued thirteene yeares in the Citie Royall, Xam∣balu, the King whereof was very mightie, and had in his Empire a thousand and fiftie Cities, some of them very populous. He said, he had often seene the King, with whom no man speaketh but by a supplication, nor is answered but by an Eunuch. Being as∣ked how he had accesse thither, he answered, That he sustained the person as well of the Embassador of the King of Caygar, as of a Marchant: and being detained in the first Citie by the Magistrate, he shewed his Commission, and post was presently sent to the King, who returned in a moneth, riding 90. or 100. myles a day, with change of Horses, bringing him letters of admission. No man was troublesome to him in the way. They punish theeues seuerely (which also is obserued of the Cathayans in Iosa∣pha Barbaro and in Marcus Paulus aforesaid.) The people hee affirmed were white, comely, long-beareded, and very personable. In Religion he said they were Isauites, (or Christians, professors of IESVS) and some among them Mussauites, or Iewes, and many Mahumetans, who hoped to draw the King, being a Christian, to their Sect. The Iesuite addeth, That he farther conferred with him another day about their Religion, who told him, That they had many Churches, and some very great; many Images, both painted and carued, especially of the Crucifixe, which they religiously worship. Euery Church hath his Priest much reucrenced. The Priests liued single, and kept Schooles, wherein they instructed the youth, which should after take Orders: they had also one among the Priests supereminent, and were all maintained at the Kings costs, as were the Churches also both built and repaired. They ware blacke clothes, and on holy∣dayes, redde; with Cappes much like the Iesuites, but greater. He added, That he had often seene the King goe to Church: That there were many of both Sexes, which in Cloysters liued a Monasticall life, some obseruing also a single life in their own houses. This agreeth with Vertomans report. He reported, That the Countrey was rich, and had in it many Mines of Siluer: the King had foure hundred Elephants, which they said were brought from Malaca. And from pegu also he said, that Marchants resorted thither, which voyage was halfe a yeare (it seemeth through the Sea betweene China and Iapan.) Xauerius addeth, That while he was at Caximir, he heard of many Christians in Rebat, a Kingdome adioyning to Xa∣tai, who had Churches, Priests, and Bishops, to whome he had written three wayes in the Portugall and the Persian Tongues. The greatest obiection against this Historie, that distinguisheth Cathay from Chi∣na, is the report of Iacob Pantogia Iacob Pantogia , a Iesuite, in a letter dated from Panquin, the Seat Royall of China, in March 1602, in which he blameth a double error of our Mappes, both for making China larger then it is, and for adioyning to the same this questioned Kingdome of Cathay, whereas (saith he) China, or Sina, is Cathay, and this Panquin, where now we liue, is Cambalu. This he proueth by the incredible riches which he here saw, agreeing to that which is commonly reported of Cathay, and by the testi∣monie of certaine Moores and Mahumetanes, whome he found in Panquin, which vsually, euery fifth yeare, resort hither vnder shew of an Embassage, and paying of tri∣bute; indeede for gaine, by way of traffique: (their tribute meane-while obtaining sufficient retribution out of the Kings Coffers, who sustaineth them and theirs, all the time of their abode in China, at his owne costs, besides other gifts.) Of these Mar∣chants, which resorted hither out of Persia and the Countrey of the Mogores, the Iesu∣its by enquirie learned, that this countrey of China was called Cathay, & had no other
name in Persia, and among the Mogores, nor did they know any other Countrey so called. And asking further, how they called the Citie Panquin, they answered, Cam∣balu: whereupon the Iesuite concludeth without all scruple, as is said. And againe, in the Chinian Epistles, dated 1607, is reported, That Bened. Goes. Benedictus Goes (sent sixe yeares after of the Iesuites by the way of Mogor to finde out Cathay) remained in the borders of China, in the Prouince of Xanti, from whence he writ, An. 1606. That he could finde no other Catay then the Kingdome of China. This report fur∣thereth Pantogia's opinion. But if it be not sufficient to oppose the former report of Xamer to these of Pan∣togia and Goes, and the different qualities of the Chinians and Cathayans (as in their proper places shall follow) both in things priuate and publike, diuine and humane; I answere, That the name Cambalu is by M. Paulus M.Pa.l.2.c.7. and others interpre∣ted the Citie of the Prince, or Cam. And Perera Galotto Pere∣ra relationes Chin. interpreteth Pachin, or Panquin, where the King of China alwayes resideth, to signifie the Towne of the Kindgome, as he was there aduertised, the same signification (in manner) remaining to the di∣uers appellations in differing Languages, as a common name to be applyed to any Citie Royall If Panquin were Cambalu, the inhabi∣tants would so tearme it as the Cathayans did. . This Perera was himselfe a longtime prisoner there, and accounted it a wonder in one Citie to meete with a few Moores, who were detained in China, hauing come thither twentie yeares before, and were permitted the vse of their Reli∣gion; of which they could say almost nothing, but Mahomet was a Moore, and their father was a Moore, and I am a Moore, with some other wordes of their Alcoran; wherewithall, and in abstinence from Swines flesh, they liue (sayth he) till the Deuill take them all. And yet the report of Xauier telleth vs, That the Moores are many and mightie in Cathay; of Iewes I remember nor the mention of them in any Chinian re∣lation: of Christians, which (he saith) is the Religion in Cathay, there are not to my knowledge, except some late gleanings of the Iesuites, any reported to be at all in China, but at Xensi Lit. lac.Anton. An.1603. at Xucheo, which also were aliens, as appeareth by their com∣plexion, long beards, and the vse of Bells. And whereas in China theeues and malefactors are seldome executed (and none hath power to execute any without speciall Commission from the King) but either they die by stripes, hunger, or imprisonment, except some few once in a yeare: M.Pau∣lus and Iosafa Barbaco, from the relation of eye-witnesses, affirme, That in Cambalu was such suddaine and rigorous execution of Iustice, that one taking a Iarre of Milke from a womans head, and beginning to drinke, vpon the womans out-cry was appre∣hended, and presently with a sword cut in funder, that the bloud and milke issued to∣gether; a Tartarian Embassador affirming both this, and that he had seene the like exe∣cution vpon another, for taking a piece of Bayes from a woman, so chopped in twaine. But the relation of the Chinian and Cathayan differing Rites will further cleare this point. As for the name of Cathay, ascribed to China by the Moores, I answere, That William de Rubruquis Will de Rubr. Hak. to.1. , who was in the Court of Mangu Can supposeth Cathay to be Serica Regio, described by Ptolomey farre more Northerly then the Iesuite repor∣teth China to be, by his own Astrolabicall obseruation. And to these Seres Ptol.l.6.c.16. Ptolomey ioyneth the Sinae, or Chinois, on the South, and our later Geographers generally con∣curre in this opinion. He also which readeth Ioannes de Plaeo Carpins Jo.de plano Carp. c.5. , shall find, that the Tartars conquered the Kara-Kitai, or blacke Cathayans, and then the Emperour of Kithai, by vndermining his Citie, as is said, in the dayes of Cyngis; and yet a great part of Kitai remained yet vnconquered, and withstood his forces, and namely that part which is neerest the Sea. And this wealthie Countrey of Great Cathaya hath many Prouinces, the more part whereof doe yet withstand the Moals or Tartars (it is the last period in Will.de Rubruquis). I hence gather, that the name Kitai was applyed to a great part of the North-east corner of Asia, happily no lesse generall to many Regi∣ons on that side, then India to the Southerly parts. And why may not the name of Kathay Rich. Iohnson from a Tarta∣rian Marchant learned the way to Cathay, and in Cathay it selfe he rec∣koneth 75. daies iourney. Hak. , as well by the Mogores and Persians, be giuen to the North parts of China (one parcell of the North-east of Asia) as the name of India, not onely to so great a part of Asia, but to America also, which was called India, because the first
discouerers that thought they had encountred the Indian Continent? And these parts of China, may much fitter retaine the name of Cathay, to which Empire it had so long beene subiect, and by the Cathayan conquest was first knowne to our world. But they knew no countrey else so named: True; for the Lawes of the Cathay∣ans forbidding egresse of the Natiues, and ingresse of Aliens, and a more forcible law of Mountaines and deserts, wilde beasts, and wilder men; the manifold smaller and more beggerly Segniories betweene, euery one challenging their ninth (if not themselues confiscating, or theirs robbing all) now in so long a space may bury euen the name and knowledge of the great Cam, whereas neither armes of Princes, nor traffique of subiects, can open any new, or retaine the olde notice of Nations. What dreames did the West conceiue of the East in Asia, and South in Afrike, till the ar∣mies first, and Marchants after, of the Carthaginians, Macedonians, and Romanes discouered them ? And yet how did those flouds of Barbarous people afterwards drowne with barbarous ignorance the knowledge of all Arts, and this of Geography amongst the rest? And till the Tartarians, like a terrible thunderclap, with the light∣ning and noise of their Armies, brought a more sudden then welcome knowledge of themselues to the world, who euer in Persia or Assyria had heard of their names or of diuers people else, (and these Cathayans among the rest) first knowne by their conquests? Further the Iesuite himselfe to Panquin ascribeth iust fortie degrees: and Marcus Paulus his Father and Vnkle went from Boghar (the altitude whereof Maister Ienkinson Hac. at his being there, obserued to be thirtie nine degrees, and ten minutes: or as Abilfada Is. ap. Ramus. Abilfada Ismael placeth it, thirtie nine, and an halfe North & Northeast to goe in∣to Cathay. The like course did the same men hold going into Cathay, from Armenia afterwards with Marcus himselfe, Lib.1.c.1. sempre alla volta di Graco & Tramontana; whereas a course directly East, or inclining to the South, must haue beene taken, if China had beene Catai. Neither is it likely that their iourney would haue beene so much letted by Frosts and Snowes. The same may bee gathered out of the discoures following in Marcus Paulus, Lib. I. & li.2. where hee abutteth the countreyes in succeeding linkes to Ca∣thay, from the East, to the Northwards, and from the North-east declining West∣ward in reckoning from thence. And whereas Pantogia raiseth the most Northerly part of China but to two and forty degrees at the most, wherein as to an eie-witnes wee yeeld him credit: How can it stand with reason, how can it be likely that in those temperate climes, the world can yeeld but a few Nations, and those base Mores, and Ethnkies, when as a good part of Spaine, halfe Italy, Greece, all France, Germany, and Hungry (to omit other wealthy parts of the world) are subiect to the same paral∣lels? And indeede herein Pantogia hath well helped vs, whereas our moderne Mappes haue caused no small scruple to a diligent obseruer, in placing Cathay, a countrey reported to bee so fertile and ciuill in so Northerly a clime, very indis∣creetely Hond. tab. raising Cambalu to the height of threescore degrees, and paralelling Ca∣thay with Norwey: which cannot stand with other things thereof reported, howso∣euer the Tartars themselues were happily of a more Northerly climate then this men∣tioned. Others goe not so farre, yet they place Cambalu too farre within land, which Paulus saith is within two daies iourney of the Sea. It seemeth that now this great Tartarian Prince hath no strength at sea, and therefore is the lesse knowne. And here in participate other great and mighty Princes, Prester Iohn (so called) of Ae∣thiopia in Africa, and the Sophi, and great Mogor, in Asia; ranked iustly a∣mongst the greatest Emperours of the world: who hauing some part of their Domini∣on adioning to the Sea, make little or no vse thereof. Abilfada Ismael a Syrian Prince who wrote an exact Geography in Arabian Ab. Ismael cited by Ramus. vol.2. about three hundred yeares since, pla∣ceth Cambalu in 144. 8. Long. and 35. 25. Latit, it may haply bee 45. degrees in Lati∣tude, one Figure being falsified, or else inuerted for 53. And as this Latitude disagreeth from that of Panquin, so the Longitude a great deale more. Thus much haue I thought good to dispute touching that difficult and hard question of Cathay and China: which though it will bee tedious to some, yet to the
curious may seeme short enough; although somewhat else may bee obserued to this purpose in the particulars of China, and Cathay following: this confirming my opi∣nion further, that Chaggi Memet, Mar. Polo, Mandenill, Odoricus, Nicolo di Conti, and others, eie-witnesses, speake of China or Mangi, and of Cathay, as diuers Coun∣treys. And Farfur King of Mangi M. P. L.2. 55: possessed his Countries, now knowne by the name of China, in peace till An. 1269. being counted a richer countrey then Cathay it selfe, which was conquered before, if we vnderstand it properly: and Cambalu seemeth to be the Citie wherein Cingis the first Cham besieged and tooke the Cathayan Emperour. Paulus also mentioneth among the greatest Cities of Mangi, Panghin, and Nang∣hin, which sound to be the same with Panquin and Nanquin; reporting further that Mangi alone had in it a thousand and two hundred great, rich, and industrious Ci∣ties, (as much as is reported of whole China, and more) and that after Cublai Can had conquered that State, he diuided it into nine tributarie kingdomes, gouerned by so many Vice-royes vnder him, (which possibly the Chinois recouering diuided into fif∣teene, as now they reckon them:) And these Cities he fortified with Garrisons, not of the Naturall inhabitants, but of Cathay. And these things are reported by him who long liued in these parts, & non interfuit solum sed etiam praefuit, & quorum pars mag∣nafuit, possessing the place of Gouernour vnder the Can three yeeres (according to the Tartarian custome) in Iangni M.Paul.l.2.c.60. one of the chiefe Cities of Mangi, hauing vn∣der it seuen and twenty other Cities: and the whole prouince of Mangi hee placeth Southeast from Cathay. And wherefore doth the King of China alwaies abide in Panquin, in the Northerly part of his Kingdome, but, as all which write hereof af∣firme, because of the Tartars which from those parts conquered the kingdome? which if they were so base a people as Pantogia affirmeth, could not bee so dreadfull to the Chinois, that their King for their sakes should there make his residence in the skirts and borders of the Kingdome. Alhacen Alhacen his history of Tam. translated by Jean.du Bec. a learned Arabian wrote the Hi∣storie of Tamerlanes life, wherein he telleth of the great Cham of Cambalu, and the King of China: as diuers Princes of diuers countries, one of which accrewed to Ta∣merlaine by marriage of the Chams onely Daughter, and the other by conquest. What needed such a wall (which Scaliger Scal.Can.Is.l.3 saith he hath seene in the Mappes of Chine) made by the Chinois, if the Tartars were not mighty neighbours, especially themselues being so mighty and populous? For my part I cannot but thinke that in so great a tract as is situate to the North of China, there is now as there haue beene of olde many Cities, and a Tartarian or Cathayan Kingdome, although it remaine yet vnknowne. And who knew that there was such a Kingdome as China a hundred yeares agoe? or who hath sailed that way to seeke this, since? and how long was it before it was knowne in our world that there was such a Prince in the world as the great Negus aboue mentioned in Ae∣thiopia; especially hee hauing no ships for warre or marchandise, nor many (scarse any) good hauens by Sea to make himselfe knowne: and within land Nature hath as it vvere imprisoned him, barring vp the passages with Mountaines and de∣serts: which seemeth now to be the case of the Cathayan; furthered by the iealou∣sie of many great Princes not to admit any forreiner in, or license any of theirs to passe out, for feare of innouation. Sed plenum aleae est saith Scal.ih.de reb.Sinarum. Scaliger, de ijs aliquid statuere quae nobis per caliginem duntaxat nota sunt. It is hard to determine in these misty mysteries. Euen as in Nature it falls out that the sunne shines there many howers before it ariseth to vs, so in Historie it may happen that there may shine a Tartarian Sunne in Cathay, when as a darke night in this longinquitie of distance hideth him from our eyes. Let euery Reader iudge as pleaseth him: I am afraid be∣twixt Cathay and China I shall get a checke for staying longer then becommeth a pilgrim. Let vs now therefore minde our Pilgrimage, and take view of the Tartari∣an Religion: with thankes to the Iesuites for their paines, but loth to follow them in nouelties except we be forced: the rather, because none are so ready to blame men therein as their societie; which though they be new sprung vp, yet are Veteratores,
(so Scaliger fitly Scal. Elench. N S. calls them) pretenders of Antiquitie, but Steph. verba paululum muta∣ta, in lib. de Lips.Lat. nihil illis antiquins quàm antiquare antiquitatem. It is indeede for their nouelties that wee forsake them. Id¦verius quodprius. Truth and Antiquitie haue kissed each other. But let vs leaue the Ietnites, which in more necessarie matters haue left the true Antiquitie, and come to our Tartarian taske. CHAP. XI. Of the Religion of the Tartars, and Cathayans. IOannes Io de Pl.Car..3. ap.Hak..1. de Plano Carpini thus writeth of their religion. They beleeue that there is one GOD, the maker of all things visible and inuisible, the Author of good things and punishments, yet doe they not wor∣ship him with prayers, praises, or any certaine rites. They haue also Idols of Felt, in the fashion of a man, and the same they set on both sides of their Tent-doores, and vnder them they put a thing of Felt fashioned like a Dugge. These they account the keepers of their Cattell, Authors of their Milke and yongstore. Others they make of silke, and doe them much honour. Some place them in a faire Chariot couered, before the doore of their flation: and who∣soeuer stealeth any thing out of that Chariot is slaine without all pitty. Their Captaines haue one alway in the middest of their Tent. To these Idols they offer the first fruits of their Milke: and the first morsels of their meate, and first draught of their drinke, at meales. And when they kill a beast, they offer the heart to their Idoll, leauing it be∣fore him till the morning, and then they take and eate it. They make an Idoll also to their chiefe Emperour, and offer thereunto with great solemnitie, as well other crea∣tures as horses, which none after dare ride on till death. They breake not a bone of the beasts which they kill for meate, but burne them with fire. They bend themselues to this Idoll toward the South, as to God. They worship the Sunne, Lights, and Fire: Water also, and the Earth, offering thereunto the first of their meates and drinkes, and in the morning before they eate or drinke. They haue no set rites prescribed by Lawe, nor doe they compell any to deny their religion simply: although in some of their cu∣stomes they are very rigorous. Thus they martyred Michael Duke of Russia, because he refused to doe reuerence to the Image of Cingis Can, which had beene their first Em∣perour: and compelled they yonger brother of Andrew Duke of Saruogle in Russia, to marry his said brothers wife according to their custome, after that they had slaine her former Husband. They haue certaine traditions, according to which they reckon these things follow∣ing to be sinnes. Their sinnes. To thrust a knife into the fire or any way to touch the fire with a knife, or with their knife to take flesh out of the Cauldron, or to hew with an hatchet neare to the fire. For they thinke that they should so cut away the head of the fire. They ac∣count it sinne also to leane on the whip wherewith they beate their horses (for they ride not with spurres.) Also to touch arrowes with a whip, to take or kill yong Birds, to strike an horse with the raine of their bridle, and to breake one bone against another. Like∣wise to poure out meate, milke, or any kinde of drinke, vpon the ground: or to make water within their Tabernacle, which whosoeuer doth willingly, is slaine: but otherwise he must pay a great summe of money to the inchanter to bee purified: who causeth the Tabernacle with all things therein to passe betweene two fires. Besides if any hath a morsell giuen him which hee is not able to swallow, and for that cause casteth it out of his mouth, there is an hole made vnder his Tabernacle, by which hee is drawne forth, and slaine without all compasion. Likewise whoso∣euer treades vpon the threshold of any of the Dukes Tabernacles hee is put to death. Thus are these Gnattes strayned, vvhen as hostile inuasions, mur∣ther, and such other Camels, are easily amongst them swallowed. They thinke that
after death they shall liue in another world, and there multiply there cattell, eate, drinke and doe other actions of life. At a new Moone, or a full Moone, they begin all new en∣terprises. They call her the great Emperour, and bow their knees and pray thereto. The Sunne they say is the Moones mother, because she hath thence her light. Their Sorce∣ries. They are giuen to Diuinations, Auguries, Sooth-sayings, Witchcrafts, Inchant∣ments: and when they receiue answere from the Diuell, they attribute the same vnto God, whom they call Itoga, & the Comanians call him Cham, that is, Emperor, whom they maruellously feare and reuerence, offering to him many Oblations, and the first fruits of their meate and drinke. According to his answeres they dispose all things. They beleeue that all things are purged by fire: therefore when any Embassadours, Princes or other Personages whatsoeuer, come vnto them, they and their gifts must passe be∣tweene two fires to be purified, least peraduenture they haue practised some Witch∣craft, or haue brought some poison or other mischiefe with them. And if fire fall from heauen vpon men or beasts, which there often hapneth; or if they thinke themselues any way defiled or vncleane, they thus are purified by their Inchanters. If any be sicke, a speare is set vp in his Tent with blacke Felt welted about it, and from thenceforth, no stranger entreth therein. Their sicknes and Funerals. For none of them which are present at his death, may enter the hord of any Duke or Emperour, till a New Moone. When he is dead, if he be a chiefe man, he is buried in the field where pleaseth him. And he is buried with his Tent, sitting in the middest thereof, with a Table set before him, and a platter full of meate, and a Cup of Mares milke. There is also buried with him Vin.l.30.c.86 a Mare and Colt, a Horse with bridle and saddle: and they eate another Horse, whose bones the women burne for the soule of the dead, stuffing his hide with straw, setting it aloft on two or foure poles, that hee may haue in the other world a Tabernacle and other things fitting for his vse. They bury his golde and siluer with him: the Chariot or Cart in which he is carried forth is broken, his Tent is destroyed, neither is it lawfull to name his name, till the third generation. They obserue also other funerall rites, too long to rehearse. They lament their dead thirty daies, more or lesse. Their Pa∣rents and those of their Family are thus cleansed. They make two fires, and pitch neere thereunto two Speares, with a line from the top of the one to the other, fastening on the same line some peeces of Buckeram, vnder which, and betwixt the fires, passe the men, beasts, and Tents. There stand also two women; one on this side, the other on that, casting water, and repeating certaine charmes: if any thing fall, or be broken, the inchanters haue it. And if any be slaine of Thunder, the men in the Tent must thus bee cleansed and all things in the Tent, being otherwise reported vncleane, and not to be touched. Their condi∣tions. No men are more obedient to their Lords then the Tartars. They seldome contend in words, neuer in deedes. They are reasonably courteous one to another: their women are chaste; adulterie is seldome heard off, and theft is rare, both puni∣shed by death. Drunkennesse common, but without bralls among themselues, or dis∣credit among others. They are proud, greedy, deceitfull. They eate Dogs, Wolues, Foxes, Horses, and in necessitie, mans flesh, Mice, and other filth, and that in as filthy a manner, without Cloathes, and Napkins, (their bootes and the grasse can serue to wipe their greasie hands:) they haue no bread, hearbes, Wine, meate or Beere, nor doe they wash their dishes. It is a great sinne amongst them to suffer any of their foode to bee lost: and therefore they will not bestow a bone on a dogge, till they haue eaten the marrow. Yvo. Narbonensis in an Epistle recited by Mat. Paris Mat.Paris. An. 1243. reporteth the confession of an English man, which was taken with other Tartars by the Christians. He saith that they called by the Name of Gods the ancient founders and fathers of their Tribes, and at set times did solemnise feasts vnto them, many of them being particular, and but foure onely generall. They thinke that all things are created for themselues a∣lone. They be hardy and strong in the breast, leane and pale-faced, rough and huf-shoul∣dred, hauing flat and short noses, long & sharpe chinnes, their vpper iawes low and de∣clining. their teeth long and thinne, their eie-browes extending from their foreheads down to their noses, their eies inconstant & blacke, their thighs thick, and legges short,
yet equall to vs in stature. They are excellent Archers. Vanquished, they aske no fa∣uour; and vanquishing, they shew no compassion. They all persist as one man in their purpose of subduing the whole world. Their proud swelling titles appeare in the copies of those Letters of Duke Baioth∣noy & Cuin Can, expressed by Vincent Rel. Spec.Hist.l.vlt.c.51.&52. Vincentius. One of them beginneth thus. By the precept of the liuing GOD, Cingischam sonne of the sweet and worshipfull GOD saith, that GOD is high aboue all, the immort all GOD, and vpon Earth Cingischam onely Lord, &c. These Letters of the Emperour, the Tartars called the Letters of God: and so begin∣neth Duke Baiothnoy to the Pope, who had sent Frier Ascelline, with Alexander, Albe∣ricus, and Simon, thither in Embassage. The word of Baiothnoy, sent by the diuine disposi∣tion of Cham, Know this O Pope, &c. Frier Iohn Jo.de P.C. saith, he stileth himselfe The power of GOD, and Emperour of all men: and hath in his scale ingrauen words of like effect, as is already shewed. Mandeuill C.37. Sir Io.Mand. hath the same report. Will. de Rubruquis W. de Rubr. saith, that they haue diuided Scythia amongst them, from Da∣nubius to the sunne-rising, euery Captaine knowing the bounds of his pastures which they feed, in the winter descending Southwards, ascending in the Summer Northwards. Their houses are moueable, remoued on great Carts which containe twenty foote be∣tweene the wheeles; their houses on each side ouerreaching fiue foote, drawne by aboue twenty Oxen. When they take them downe, they turne the doore alwaies to the South. Ouer the Maisters head is an image of felt, called the Maisters brother: and another ouer the head of the good wife or Mistres, called her brother, fastened to the wall: and betwixt both of them is a little leane one, which is the keeper of the whole house. Shee hath also at her beds feete a Kids Skinne, filled with Wooll, and a little image looking towards the Maidens and Women. Next to the doore on the womens side (which is the East, as the mans side is on the West) there is an Image with a Cowes Vdder for the women, whose office it is to milke the Kine: on the other side another with a Mares Vdder for the men. When they make merry, they sprinkle their drinke vpon these Images in order, beginning at the Maisters. Then goeth a seruant out of the house with a cup full of drinke, sprinkling thrice toward the South, and bowing the knee at euery time: and this is done for the honour of the Fire. Then performeth hee the like superstition toward the East, for the honour of the Aire: next to the West for the honour of the Water: and lastly to the North, in the behalfe of the Dead. When the Maister holdeth a cup in his hand to drinke, before he tasteth thereof hee poureth his part vpon the ground: if hee drinketh sitting on horse-backe, hee first poureth part thereof on the Mane of the Horse. After the seruant aforesaid hath dis∣charged his cups to the foure quarters of the world, hee returneth to the house: and two other seruants stand ready with two cups, and two basons, to carry drinke vnto their Maister, and that Wife, which lay with him the last night, sitting together on a bed. Their Sooth-sayers or Inchanters are their Priests. M. Paulus thus reporteth of their Religion. They say L.1.c.46. that there is a God on high in heauen, of whom lifting vp their hands, and smiting their teeth three times together, euery day with censer and incense they desire health l.2.c.26. , and vnderstanding. They place a Table aloft, in the wall of their house, in the which is written a name, that represen∣teth this God. They haue another which they call Natigay (or Itogay) of Felt or o∣ther stuffe in euery house. They make him a Wife and Children, and set his Wife on the left hand, his children before him, which seeme to doe him reuerence. This they call the God of earthly things, which keepeth their Children, beasts, and corne: and vvhen they eate, they annoint his mouth with the fat, and the mouthes of his Wife and Chil∣dren, and then cast out the broth out of the doore vnto other Spirits, And when their God hath had his part, they take theirs. Of this Natigay, they with like ceremonies of lifting vp their hands, and smiting of their teeth, desire temperature of the Aire; fruits of the Earth, l.2.c.26. Children and such like. Their wiues are exceeding chaste and obseruant: and though they be many, yet can Rachel and Leah, yea ten or twentie of them, agree with a maruellous vnion, intent vnto their household, and other busi∣nesse,
whereby they are gainefull, and not chargeable to their Husbands. When they marry, W. de Rub. in this sort. the Husband couenanteth with the father of the Maide, who hauing giuen him power to take her wheresoeuer he shall finde her, he seeketh her among some of her friends where shee hath then of purpose hidden her selfe, and by a kinde of force carrieth her away. They marry with any except their owne Mother and Sister. Their Widdowes seldome marry, because of their seruice to their former Husbands in an other world, except the sonne marry his fathers wiues, or the brother, his brothers, because they can there in the next world, bee content to resigne them to their former Husbands againe. The women buy, sell, and prouide all necessaries into the house, the men intending nothing but their armes, hunting and hauking. If one hath buried a Male-childe, and another a Female, the parents contract a marriage be∣twixt those two, and painting in papers, seruants, horses, clothes, and houshould, and making writings for the confirmation of the Dower, burne these things in the fire, by the smoke whereof they (in their smokie conceits) imagine all these things to bee carried and confirmed to their children in the other world: and the parents of the two dead parties claime kindred each of other: as if they indeede had married their children while they liued. In Xaindu did Cublai Can build a stately pallace, encompassing sixteene miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are sertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sump∣tuous house of pleasure, which may be remoued from place to place. Here he doth abide in the monethes of Iune, Iuly, and August, on the eight and twentith day where of, he departeth thence to another place to doe sacrifice on this maner. Hee hath a Herd or Droue of Horses and Mares, about ten thousand, as white as snow: Of the Milke where∣of none may taste, except he be of the bloud of Cingis Can. Yea the Tartars doe these beastes great reuerence, nor dare any crosse their way, or goe before them. According to the direction of his Astrologers or Magicians, he on the eight and twentith of August aforesaid spendeth and powreth forth with his owne hands the Milke of these Mares in the Aire, and on the Earth, to giue drinke to the spirits and Idols which they worship, that they may preserue the men, women beasts, birds, corne, and other things growing on the earth. Their Sects and orders. These Astrologers, or Necromancers, are in their Art maruellous. When the skie is cloudie and threatneth raiue, they will ascend the roofe of the palace of the Grand Can, and cause the raine and tempests to fall round about, without touching the said Palace, These which thus doe are called Tebeth, and Chesmir, Tebeth and Chesmir. two forts of Idolaters, which delude the people with opinion of their sanctitie, imputing these workes to their dissembled holinesse: and for this cause they goe in filthy and beastly manner, not caring who seeth them, with dirt on their faces, neuer washing nor combing themselues, And if any be condemned to death, they take, dresse, and eate him: which they doe not if any die naturally. Bachsi. They are also called Bachsi, that is of such a Reli∣gion or order, as if one should say a Frier. Preacher, or Minor, and are exceedingly expert in their diuelish Art. They cause that the bottles in the Hall of the great Can doe fill the bolles of their owne accord, which also without mans helpe, passe ten paces through the Aire, into the hands of the said Can, and when he hath drunke, in like sort returne to their place. These Bachsi sometimes resort vnto the officers, and threaten plagues or other misfortune from their Idols, which to preuent they desire so many muttons with blacke heads, and so many pounds of incense, and Lignum Aloes to performe their due sacrifices. Which they accordingly receiue and offer on their Feast day, sprinkling Broth before their Idols. There boe of these, great Monasteries, which seeme like a small Citie, in some whereof are two thousand Monkes, which shaue their heads and beards, and weare a religious habite, and hallow their Idols feasts with great solemnitie of hymnes and lights. Some of these may bee married. Otherthere are, called Sensim, Sensim. an order which obserueth great abstinence and strict∣nesse of life, in all their life eating nothing but Branne, which they put in hot water, and let it stand till all the white of the meale be taken away, and then eate it beeing
thus washed. These worship the Fire, and are condemned of the other for Heretikes, because they worship not their idoles, and will not marry in any case. They are shauen, and weare hempen-garments of blacke or bright yellow, and although they were silke, yet would they not alter the colour. They sleepe on great mattes, and liue the austerest life in the world. Of their Astrologers in Cambalu were not fewer then fiue thousand; Christians, Catayans, and Saracens, maintained with foode and rayment at the great Cans charge. These, by their Astrolabe foretell of the change of weather, mortality, warres, disea∣ses, &c. And if any enterprise any great worke, he resorteth vnto them, and telling the houre of his natiuitie, by their Art is informed of the successe. They hold the soule to be immortall, and according to euery mans merits in his life, to passe into a more noble creature, till it be deified, or ignoble, as to a pesant, and then to a dogge, and so by degrees to the vilest. They shew much reuerence to their parents, to whome if any be vngratefull in their necessity, there is an office and officers appointed to trie and punish the offence. In the Emperours hall none dare spit, but for that purpose ca∣rieth a little vessell to spit in: nor dare any there make any noyse or lowd talking. The Tartars were at first very vncharitable to the poore, and would curse them, saying, That if God had loued them, he would haue prouided for them: but after the Idolatrous Bachsi had commended Almes for a good worke, there was great prouision made for them, and euery day at least twenty thousand dishes of Rice, Mill, & Panike, by certaine Officers distributed amongst them. And for this liberality they adore him as a God. Cingis amongst his first Lawes enacted (as saith Vincentius) the punishment of Vincent. Bel. Spec.histor.lib. 30.ca. 70. death to be inflicted vpon offenders in those three vices, which before time had been most rife amongst them, namely, lying, adultery, and theft: of which yet towards o∣ther men that were not Tartars they made no conscience. They are great Vsurers, taking tenne in the hundred for a moneth, besides vse vpon Ca.75. vse; insomuch, that a souldier in Georgia, which had borrowed fiue hundred peeces of coine called Yperpera, retaining the same fiue yeares, was constrained to repay se∣uen thousand. And a Tartarian Ladie for seuen yeares vse of fiftie sheep, demaunded seuen thousand Yperpera. They are so couetous, that though they abound in cattell, they will scarce allow any to their owne expence, while it is found and good, but if it die, or be sicke. They are addicted to sodomie or buggerie. Ca. 76. They eate sometimes for necessity mans flesh, sometimes to delight themselues, and sometimes to terrifie others, reckoning it a great glory to haue slaine many, and that by varietie of cruelty. Ca. 77. Their heads they shaue from eare to eare, in manner of a horse-shooe: wearing long lockes at their eares and neckes. There be some of the Tartars, which when they see their fathers grow old and diseased, they giue them fatte meates which may choake them. And when they are thus dead, they burne their bodies, reseruing the ashes as a precious iewell, sprinckling their meates with that powlder. Ca. 86. But if any thinke not this enough (which I am afraid the most will deeme too much) let him resort to the large reports of Vincentius in his three last Bookes; an Author, I confesse, otherwise fabu∣lous, and monkish, but heerein to be beleeued, as receiuing his Reports from the eie∣witnesses. Likewise Nicephorus Niceph. Greg. hist. Rom.lib.2. Greg. vnder the name of Scythians hath written of them, their Expeditions, and Customes: their contempt of golde, and ignorance of the vse of it before these Conquests: and of the miseries which heere by the Turkes sustained, ha∣uing the Tartars on one side, the Christians on the other, and in their bowells a more implacable enemy, famine against them. Setling themselues (saith he) in the parts of Mesopotamia, Chaldea, Aslyria, they left their owne, and learned the rites and reli∣gion of these Mahumetans.
CHAP. XII. Of the festiuall solemnities, and of the magnificence of the Grand Can. WE haue already spoken of the solemne sacrifice obserued on the eight and twentieth day of August: We reade in our Author Marcus Paulus. Marcus Pau∣lus, an eie-witnes of these his relations, of other the Grand Cans grand solemnities. Of which, two are principall, one on his birth day, which in Cublai Cans time was the eight and twentith of Septem∣ber. On which himselfe was royally clothed in cloth of gold, and twenty thousand of his Barons and souldiers were all apparelled in one colour, and like (excepting the price) to himselfe, euery one hauing a girdle wrought of Golde and Siluer, and a paire of shooes, some of their garments richly set with pearles and jewells, which they weare on the thirteene solemnities, according to the thirteene Moones of the yeare. On this day all the Tartars, and seuerall Princes subiect, present him with rich gifts; and all Sects of Religions pray vnto their gods for his health, and long life. But their chiefe feast is on the first day of their yeare, which they beginne in Febru∣ary, celebrated by the Grand Can, and all the Countries subiect to him: in which they are all arayed in white, a colour in their estimation portending good lucke. And then he is presented with many clothes and horses of white colour, and other rich presents, in the same religiously obseruing the number of nine; as nine times nine horses, if they be able, and so of peeces of gold, cloth, and the rest. Then also the Elephants (which are about fiue thousand) are brought forth in sumptuous furniture: and Camels coue∣red with silke. And in the morning they present themselues in the Hall as many as can, the rest standing without in their due order. First, those of the Imperiall proge∣ny; next, the Kings, Dukes, and others, in their due place. Then commeth forth a great man or Prelate, which crieth out with a lowd voyce; Bow downe your selues, and worship: which they presently doe, with their faces to the earth. This Prelate addeth, God saue and preserue our Lord long to liue with ioy and gladnesse. They all answere; God grant it. The Prelate againe: God encrease his Dominion, and preserue in peace all his subiects, and prosper all things in all his Countries. Where∣unto they answer as before. Thus they doe worship foure times. After this, the said Prelate goeth to an Altar there, richly adorned; on which is a redde Table with the name of the Great Can written in it, and a Censer with Incense, which hee incenseth in stead of them all, with great reuerence performed vnto the Table. This done, they returne to their places, and present their gifts, and after are feasted. When Cublas had ouerthrowne Naiam his vncle (as before is said) vnderstanding that the Christians obserued their yearely solemnity of Easter, hee caused them all to come vnto him, and to bring the Booke of the foure Gospels, which he incensed often with great Ceremonies, deuoutly kissing it, and caused his Barons to doe the like. And this he obserueth alway in the principall feasts of the Christians, as Christmasse and Easter. The like he did in the chiefe feasts of the Saracens, Iewes, and Idolaters. The cause (he said) was because of those foure Prophets, to which all the world doth reuerence: IESVS of the Christians, Mahomet of the Saracens, Moses of the Iewes, and Sogemambar Can the first Idoll of the Pagans: and I (saith hee) doe ho∣nour to them all, and pray him which is the greatest in Heauen, and truest, to helpe me. Yet he had best opinion of the Christian faith, because it contained nothing but goodnesse: and would not suffer the Christians to carry before them the Crosse, on which so great a man as CHRIST was crucified. He also sent Niculo & Maffio, the Father and vncle of Marco Polo our Author, in embassage to the Pope, to send him 100. wise men which might conuince the Idolaters, that boasted of those their magi∣call wonders, whereas the Christians that were there, were but simple men, not able
to answer them, which if it had beene effected, hee and his Barons would haue beene baptized. Odoricus Odoricus.V.& Io. oeni; saith, that in his time the Can celebrated, besides the former, the feasts of his circumcision, marriage, and coronation. But before the conquest of Cathay they obserued not any day at all with festiuall solemnities. Cublai Can was of meane stature, of countenance white, red, and beautifull. Hee had foure wiues, which kept seuerall Courts, the least of which contained at least ten thousand persons. He had many concubines; euery second yeare hauing a new choice of the fairest maidens in the prouince of Vngut, most fertile (belike) of that commo∣dity: which passe a second election at the Courts, and the fairest and fittest of them are committed to Ladies, to prooue and to instruct them. Their parents holde it a great grace so to haue bestowed their children: and if any of them proue not, they impute it to their disastrous planet. They hold it for a great beauty, to haue their noses flat be∣tweene the eyes. In December, Ianuary, and February, he abideth at Cambalu, in the North-East part of the prouince of Cathay, in a Pallace neare to the City builded on this manner. There is a circuite walled in, foure square, each square containing eight miles, hauing about them a deep ditch, and in the middle a gate. A mile inwards is an other wall, The Grand Cans pallace. which hath six miles in each square; and in the South side three gates, and as many on the North. Betwixt those walls are souldiers. In euery corner of this wall, and in the middest, is a stately pallace, eight in all, wherein are kept his munitions. There is a third wall within this, containing foure miles square, each square taking vp one mile, hauing sixe gates and eight pallaces, as the former, in which are kept the Grand Cans prouisions. And betweene these two walls are many faire trees, and meadowes sto∣red with many beasts. Within this is the Grand Cans Pallace, the greatest that euer was scene, confining with the wall abouesaid, on the North and South. The matter and forme thereof is of such cost and Art, with such appurtenances of pleasure and state, as were too long heere to recite. Hee for a superstitious feare suggested by his Astrologers of a rebellion which sometime should be raised against him in Cambalu, built a new city neere thereunto called Taidu Odoricus calleth it Caide. foure and twenty miles in compasse, and yet not able to receiue the Inhabitants of the old city, whence he remoued such as might moue suspicion, hither. This city was built by line, in foure squares, each whereof contained sixe miles, and three gates, so streight, that vpon the wall of one gate one might see the gate right against it. In the middest of the citie is a great Bell, which is rung in the night, to warne men to keep within doores. The great Can hath twelue thousand horsemen vnder foure Captaines to his gard. He keepeth leopards, wolues, and lions to hunt with, and with them to take wilde asses, beares, harts, &c. and one sort of eagles able to catch wolues. The two maisters of his hunting game had ten thousand men vnder each of them, the one part clothed in redde, the other in skie-colour: and when the Emperour hunteth, one of these Captaines goeth with his men and dogges on the right hand, the other on the left, compassing a great quantity of ground, that not a beast can escape them. From October to March, they are bound daily to send in a thousand head of beasts and birds. He hath also when he trauelleth, Odoricus rec koneth a gter numb ten thousand falconers diuided in diuers companies, himselfe abiding in a Chamber carried vpon foure Elephants, whence he may see the game, hauing also his tents pit∣ched for his solace neare thereby. None may carry hawke or hunting-dogge out of his dominion, nor may hawke or hunt neare the Court by many dayes iourneis, nor at all, in their times of breding, from March to October. But he that list to be more fully informed heerein, let him reade Marcus Paulus and others V 32. M n which haue written of this Argument. It is religion to vs further to su∣spend our discourse of religion.
CHAP. XIII. Of the alteration of Religion among the Tartars: and of the diuers sorts, sects, and nations of them now remaining. AFter so long narration of the Religion of the auncient Tartars, and of the Cathayans, where their Emperours fixed their abode: it follow∣eth to consider of the times following, wherein they haue beene di∣uided both in policie and faith. Maginus Mag. Geogr. Precop. Desert. Zagathay. Caz  & Morgat. diuideth them into fiue principall sorts: which may likewise be subdiuided into many inferi∣our braunches or Hords. The first of these he calleth Tartari minor, or the lesse, which is in Europe betwixt Boristhenes & Tanais comprehending Taurica Chersonesus, inhabited by the Precopite Tartars, or as Broniovius Mart. Bronie. Tartaria. tearmeth them Perecopensis of Perecopia a towne and Castle in Taurica: they are called also Ossouen∣ses and Crims, of two Townes bearing those names. These are now subiect to the Turke both in state and religion, hauing some Townes and Mahumetane Temples, and monasteries and Turkish garrisons, and a few Temples and persons Christian, of the Armenian, Grecian and Westerne profession. They liue in their homely cottages in the winter, but in the summer, wander in their carts as the other Tartars, then whom they are somewhat more ciuile. They pay three hundred Christians yearely to the Turke for tribute: of whom their Can, since the time of Zelim, receiueth a banner, and his approbation to the Empire, giuing his children or brethren in hostage. They e∣lect also an heire apparant to their empire whom they call Galga, and if the Can will preferre his sonne to that dignitie: hee killeth all his brethren, as the Turkes also deale with theirs. It should seeme that they deriue their pedegree from Cingis, descended (if I may coniecture, where certaine historie faileth) of some of the sonnes of Bathy, the great Conquerour in those parts of the world. Lochton Can was the first which ruled in Taurica: long since Bathy's time. They vse the Chaldean and Arabian letters: they haue their Cadies to administer religion and iustice, as haue the Turkes. Of these Eu∣ropaean Tartars L Chalcond. lib.3. Bronionius, Maginus, and others haue written a Discourse, to whom I referre such as desire to know further of their affaires. They count the Don or riuer Tanais holy, in respect of the commodities which it yeeldeth them. These Tartars A Guag.de Sar∣mat. Sigism. ab Herberst Petr. Bertius in tab. Chytroeus, Auton. passing through the confines of Polonia and Podolia, to help the Turke in the warres of Hungary, the wayes being secured and defended with the garrisons, they vsed a new stratagem to make way, by driuing a multitude of Buls before them, which contrary to their expectation, affrighted with the Ordnance, recoiled vpon their driuers, treading them downe, and scattering them. The Chan, when St. Bathor King of Poland was dead, sent his embassadours to bee elected their King; affirming, that their Pope should be his, their Luther his also: and for dainties, horse-flesh would content him. His suite was reiected with laughter. The second part in this diuision is attributed to Tartaria Deserta, so called of the Desert huge tract of Countrey betweene Tanais, the Caspian Sea, and the lake Kitay: sometime knowne by the name of Sarmatia Asiatica. It containeth many Tribes: of which the principall are, Zavolhensis, called Bulgar Tartars, of Volga: be∣tweene which riuer and Iaich they haue their abode. This they called the great Hord, and the Emperor thereof Vlucan, in the yeare 1506. subdued by the Crim-Tartars be∣fore mentioned: and after that by Basilius the Muscouite, to whose large stile Bulgaria is added, taking that name of Volga, as it were Volgaria, or of Bulgar a towne vpon that riuer. Cazan and Ashacan Hords of these Zavol Tartars haue beene sub∣iect also many yeares to the said great Duke, Genroeus de im∣periis ex 4. sect. Mahum &c. P.Camerar. Med. histor. ca.98. who caused the Prince of Casan (be∣ing taken prisoner, when he was yong) to be baptized. Neare vnto Cazan is Vachen, he people whereof are Gentiles; and the Cheremizes halfe Gentiles, halfe Tartars,
and Mangat or Nagay, Mahumetan Tartars, which in the yeare 1558. were tho∣row ciuile warres, famine, and pestilence, destroyed to the number of aboue a hun∣dred thousand. These Nagayans haue their diuers hords subiect to their seuerall Dukes, whom they call Murzes, hauing no vse of money, corne, or Arts. They, in the time of their distresse, would for one loafe of bread, worth sixe pence, haue sold sonne or daughter to Maister Ienk if hee would haue bought a thousand, although other∣whiles they deride the Christians, as liuing on the toppes of weedes (so they call our corne.) This our Author and Countreyman trauelled downe the Riuer Volga to A∣stracan, which riuer, after it hath runne aboue two thousand English miles, hath threescore and tenne mouthes or falles into the Caspiansea. Through this Sea hee passed to Manguslaùe an other part of the Desart Tartaria. The Prince whereof Ti∣mor Soltan hee found and saluted in a Regumq tur∣res, Pauperum tabernae. little round house, not hauing Towne or Ca∣stell, made of reedes, couered without with felt, within with carpets, accompanied with the great Metropolitane of their Countrey, esteemed of amongst that field-peo∣ple, as the Bishop of Rome is in most parts of Europe. And had hee not presented himselfe to him with the great Dukes Letters, hee had beene spoyled of all that hee had. They passed thence with a Carauan of Merchants twentie dayes, not finding wa∣ter, but as they drew out of olde deepe wells, brackish and salt: and passed some∣times two or three dayes without the same. After that, they came to a Gulfe of the Caspian Sea agayne, where the water is fresh, and sweete. Not so the people: For the Customers of the King of Turkeman tolled of euerie fiue and twenty, one; and se∣uen ninths, for the said King and his brethren. Into this gulfe the Riuer Oxus did sometimes fall, but is now intercepted by the Riuer Ardock, which runneth toward the North: and (as it were) loath to view so cold a Clime and barbarous Inhabi∣tants, after hee hath runne with a swift race a thousand miles, (as it were) in flight, hee hideth himselfe vnder ground for the space of fiue hundred miles, and then loo∣king vp, and seeing little amendment, drowneth himselfe in the Lake of Kithay. Thence they had three dayes iourney to Sellizure, where finding Azim Can, to whome hee presented a ninth, hee receiued there the like festiuall entertainment as before with Timor, that is, the Minimo con. tenta Natura. flesh of a wilde horse and mares milke without bread. Hee and his brethren ruled all from the Caspian Sea to Vrgence, and had continuall warres with the Persians; and is called Turkeman: for the other Hords of that huge Tartarian Desart, the Kirgessen, Melgomazan, Scibanski, Thumen (which still is said to remaine vnder the obedience of the Grand Can) Bascheridi, Heselits, harsh names of harsher people in those most harsh and horride Desarts, will hasten my Pen and your Eares, to some more pleasing subiect. The Thumen and their neighbours are great Inchanters, and by their Arte (they say) raise tempests and o∣uerthrowe their enemies. The Kirgessen obserue these stinking holies: Their Ortelius. priest mixeth bloud, milke, and cow-dung together with earth, and putting them in a vessell, therewith climeth a tree, and after his deuout exhortation to the people, he besprinckleth them with this sacred mixture, which they account diuine. When any of them die, they hang him on a tree instead of buriall. The Tartars in Turkeman vse to catch wilde horses with hawkes tamed to that pur∣pose, which seising on the necke of the horse, with his beating, and the horses cha∣sing, tireth him, and maketh him an easie prey to his maister, who alwayes rideth with his bow, arrowes, and sword. They eate their meate, and say their prayers sitting on the ground crosse-legged, spending the time very idly. As maister Ienkinson with his company trauelled from hence towards Boghar, they were assailed with forty thieues: of whome they had intelligence somewhat before, and therefore certaine holie men (for so they account such as haue beene at Mecca) caused the Carauan to stay while they made their prayers and diuinations touching their successe. They tooke cer∣taine sheepe and killed them, and tooke the blade-bones' of the same, which they first sodde, and then burnt, mingling the bloud of the said sheepe with this poulder of their bones with which bloud they wrote certaine Characters, vsing many other ce∣remonies
and wordes, and thereby diuined, that they should meete with enemies, which after much trouble they should ouercome: which accordingly prooued true. Of the faithfulnesse of these holy men hee had good proofe, both here and elsewhere they refusing not to expose themselues to danger, and to forsweare themselues rather then betray him and the Christians to their theeuish Countreymen. For these robbers would haue dismissed the Bussarmans, so they call their Catholikes, if they would haue deliuered the Caphars, that is, infidells, as they esteeme the Christians, vnto their po∣wer. One of their holy men (which the enemies had surprized) by no torments would confesse any thing to the preiudice of his fellowes. But at last they were forced to agree, & giue the theeues twenty ninths, that is, twenty times nine seuerall things, and a Camell to carry the same away. This Countrey of Turkeman or Turchestan is the first habitation of the Turkes, and the people were called by that name, both in Haithons time, and in the time of Mauritius. Their Niceph. Cal. libr.11.ca 30. religion then was the same with that which we haue aboue related of the Tartars, worshipping the foure Elements &c. as in the Turkish History you haue heard. Pliny nameth the Turkes nearer Maeotis: but whether in deuouring the people with their swords, as they did the pastures with their cattell, they came from hence, or these from thence, or that Pliny might easily wander in so wandering a subiect; all auerre, that from hence they went first into Per∣sia, and in succeeding ages haue made many fertile Countries, like their Turcomania, where Maister Ienkinson saith groweth no grasse, but heath whereon their cattell feed: The Ottoman-horse blasting with his breath the ground he treads on, (hath ac∣cording to their owne Prouerbe) there neuer groweth grasse more. The Turkeman Nation is (saith Haithon) for the most part Mahumetan, and many of them without Law at all. They vse the Arabian Letters. These Deserts and Theeues haue almost made vs forget our diuision, according to which wēe should haue told you, that from the Caspian Sea hither you must (accor∣ding to Maginus) call the Tartars generally Zagathayans, Marcus Pau∣lus li.1. so called of Zagathay, the great Cans brother, somtime their Prince. Which name G. Boter. comprehendeth also diuerse other Nations more ciuill then the former, possessing the Countries sometime known by the names of Bactriana, Sogdiana, Margiana, now Ieselbas, that is, Greene heads, of the colour of their Turbants: differing from the Persians, whome they call for like cause, Redde-heads. These haue cruell warres continually with the Persians, whome they call Caphars (as they doe the Christians,) for their supposed heresie, of which in the Persian relation hath beene shewed, and for that they will not cut the haire of their vpper lips, for which they are accounted of the Tartars great sinners. In Ant. Ienkins. Boghar is the feate of their Metropolitane, who is there more obeyed then the King, and hath sometime deposed the King, and placed an other at his pleasure. There is a little riuer running through the City, whose water breedeth in them that drinke thereof (espe∣cially strangers) a worme of an ell long, which lieth in the legge betwixt the flesh and the skinne, and is plucked out about the anckle, with great Arte of Surgeons well practised heerein. And if it breake in plucking out, the party dieth. They plucke out an inch in a day, which is rolled vp, and so proceede till shee bee all out. And yet will not the Metropolitane suffer any drinke but water or mares milke, hauing officers to make search and punish such as transgresse, with great seuerity. Zagatai liued the space of one hundred twenty and one yeares before Marcus Paulus, and was (as hee saith) a Christian, but his sonne followed him in his kingdome, not in his reli∣gion. Heere in this Countrey is Samarcand the Citie of Great Tamerlane (of some cal∣led Temir Cuthlu, that is, as Mathias a Michou Michouius lib.1.ca.8. interpreteth it, Happy Sword) whose army contained twelue hundred thousand: whose conquests exceed (if Histories ex∣ceed not) all the Great Alexanders, Pompeys, Caesars, or any other Worthies of the World. And one of the greatest Monarchs now of the earth, The Great Mogore is said Iesuit. epist. Rel. Mogor. to descend of him. Of him are many Histories written by some Leunclav. Pe∣orend. louius &c. that haue liued since his time, and could not well know his proceedings, it being generally deplored, that this Achilles
wanted a Homer Cic. Orat. pro Arch. , which Alexander applauded in him, but wanted for himselfe: on∣ly one Alhacen (an Arabian which then liued) hath written largely thereof, and that (as he sayth) by Tamerlans commaund, which Iean du Bec, Abbot of Mortimer, in his voyage into the East Countrie, met with, and had it interpreted to him by an Arabian, and we vpon his credit: which if any thinke to be insufficient, I leaue it to his choise and censure. That Author sayth, that Tamerlan descended of the Tartarian Empe∣rours, and Og his father was Lord of Sachetay, who gaue to his sonne Tamerlan (which name signifieth heauenly grace in their Tongue) his Kingdome while he yet liued, ap∣pointing two wise Counsellors, Odmar, and Aly, to assist him. He was well instructed in the Arabian learning, and a louer of learned men. Nature had set in his eyes such rayes of maiestie and beautie, that men could scarce endure to looke on them. He wore long haire, contrarie to the Tartarian custome, pretending, that his mother came of the race of Sampson. He was strong, and had a faire legge: whereas Leunclauius sayth he was called Tamurleng, of his lamenesse. His first Warre was against the Mus∣couite, whome he ouercame: The second against the King of China, with like suc∣cesse (I mention not his battailes in ciuill warres:) The third against Baiazet the Turke (whome he captiued) passing thither by the way of Persia; where Guines, Au∣thor of the Sophian Sect, a great Astrologer, and accounted a holy man, encouraged him with Prophesies of his good successe. This Warre he made against Baiazet in behalfe of the Greeke Emperour, and others, whome the Turke oppressed. He went priuatly to Constantinople, and had sight of the Citie, with all kindnesse from the Em∣perour. He inuaded Syria and Aegypt, ouerthrew the Soldan, and wonne Cairo; d∣estroyed Damascus, visited and honoured Ierusalem, and the holy Sepulchre, and gran∣ted great Priuiledges thereunto. The Princes of Lybia and Barbarie, by their Embas∣sages in Aegypt, acknowledged his Soueraignetie: In his returne by Persia he was encountred by Guines, who brought with him an infinite number of sundrie kindes of beasts, which he made tame, and by which he taught men. As soone as he saw Tamer∣lan, he made his Prayers towards the Heauens for his health, and for the Religion of the Prophet, excommunicating the Ottomans, as enemies to the faithfull beleeuers. Tamerlan gaue him fifteene or sixteene thousand Some say 30000. of his prisoners, which he instructed in his opinion: and after conquered Persia, and so returned to Samarcand, where he had vowed to erect a Church and Hospitall, with all sumptuous Magnificence. Thence hee went to Mount Althay, to burie his vncle and father in law, the Great Cham, in whose State he succeeded. He enriched Samarcand with the spoyles got∣ten in his Warres, and called the Temple which he there built, the Temple of Salomon, wherein he hanged vp Trophees and Monuments of his victories, and caused all his battailes therein to be ingrauen, thereby (said he) to acknowledge the Goodnesse of GOD. His Religion was not pure Mahumetisme, for he thought GOD was delighted with varietie of worships; yet he hated Polytheisme and Idols, onely one GOD he acknowledged, and that with much deuotion, after his manner. Thus he beat downe all the Idols in China, but honoured the Christians, with great admiration at the strict life of some Votaries. When Aly his Counsellor was dead, he built a stately Tombe for him at Samarcand, and caused Prayers to be said three dayes for his soule. Being neere his end, he blessed his two sonnes, laying his hand on the head of Sautochio the elder, and pressing it downe, but lifting vp the chinne of Le∣trochio the younger, as it were presaging vnto him the Empire, although the elder were proclaimed. But this Empire was too great, and too suddenly erected to continue. These three sorts of Tartars which wee haue hitherto mentioned, are all, for the most part, Mahumetans. There are some yet (as Michonius Lib.1. cap.7. affirmeth) neere the Caspian Sea, which are not Mahumetans, nor shaue their haire of their heads after the Tartarian manner; and therefore they call them Calmuch or Pagans. The fourth are those which in greatnes are first, namely the Cathayans, called Cara∣bus (that is, black-heads) of their Turbants, as the former, Ieselbas. But of their religion, further then that which hath beene before expressed, we can say little. And it seemeth
by the relations mentioned in the former chapters, that they are Gentils or Christians, and not of Mahomets errour. Chaggi Memet Chag. Memet. , a Persian Marchant, related (as in part is said before) to Ramusius, that he had beene at Campion, Daimir Can then raig∣ning, and that vntill Camul, the Westerly part of Tanguth, they were Idolaters and Ethnikes: from thence Westwards, Musulmans, or Saracens. In the Epistle of Carua∣lius Carval. Epist. the Iesuite, it is reported by a Mahumetane Marchant, that they were Christians, happily because of Images which the Idolaters and Pseudo-Christians doe equally worship. The fifth and last forme of our Tartars are those which abide in those places, whence the Tartars first issued to ouer-whelme all Asia with their Armies, of which is related at large in the ninth Chapter: of which, for want of probable intelligence, I can say little more. Our Mappes place there the Hords of the Danites, Nephthalites, Ciremis∣sians, Turbites, and other, which some deriue from the dispersion (as is said) of the tenne Tribes. Here is Tabor also, whose King was by Charles the fifth, Emperour, in the yeare 1540 (as before is said) burned at Mantua, for soliciting to Iudaisme. Pope Innocent, King Lewes of Fraunce (by meanes of Will. de Rubruquis) and the King of Armenia, solicited (as you haue partly heard) both the great Can, and his chiefe Princes, to become Christians: and it is likely that the Tartars might, if dili∣gence had beene vsed, and some Superstitions had not darkened the Christian professi∣on, haue beene thereunto persuaded, which many also of them were, as appeareth in Haithon, Mat. Westmonast. and Vincentius. But the Saracens, which had before polluted those Countries where the Mahume∣tan Tartars now abide, by that sutablenesse of their Law to their lawlesse lusts of Ra∣pine and Poligamie, preuailed (as Michouius Lib.1.c.5. reporteth) with Bathi and those other Tartars, to embrace Mahumet, and refuse CHRIST. They say, Eissa Rocholla, that is, IESVS is the Spirit of the LORD; Mahomet Rossolai, that is, Mahomet is the Iu∣stice of GOD. They obey (saith he) the Pentateuch of Moses, are circumcised, obserue the legall Ceremonies: they haue no Bells, but euery day cry, Lahi illo illoloh, which signifieth, that there is but one GOD. They professe themselues Ismaelites, the Chri∣stians they call Dzintzis, that is, Pagans; and Gaur, Infidels See the Sa∣racen Historie. . They obserue three Feasts: the first Kuiram, to which they prepare themselues, with their thirtie dayes Lent, and in that Feast offer Rammes, Birds, &c. The second they celebrate for All Soules, for which they fast a moneth, visit the graues, and doe workes of mercie. The third they keepe for themselues and their owne saluation, and fast twelue dayes. Iosafa Barbaro l.1. apud Ram. (a Venetian, which liued amongst the Tartars about the yere 1437) saith, That they embraced not the faith of Mahomet generally, but as euery man liked, vntill about that time, in the daies of Hedighi, a Captaine vnder Sidahameth Can, who first compelled them thereunto, being before free vnto their Idolatries, if they pleased. And of the other Tartars neere the Zagathayans, he saith, That many of thē were Ido∣laters, and carried Idols in the Carts: yea, some of them vsed to worship whatsoeure Beast they first met with, after they went abroad in the morning. Their neighbors, the Moxij, at a certaine time in the yeare, take a Horse, which they set in the field, with his foure legges tyed to foure posts, and his head to another post, fastened in the ground. This done, one of thē standing in a conuenient distance, shooteth him to the heart. Af∣terwards they flea him, & obseruing certaine ceremonies about the flesh, eat the same. The skinne they fill with chaffe, and in each of his legges thrust a straight sticke, that he may stand vpright, as if he were aliue. Lastly, they goe to a great Tree, and loppe there∣from as many boughes as they thinke good, and make a Roome or Sollar in that Tree, where they set this Horse on this feet, and worship him, offering vnto his Foxes, and diuers Beasts which beare rich Furres; of which offerings the Trees hang full. Master Ienkinson mentioneth a Nation liuing among the Tartars, called Kings; which are also Gentiles, as are also the Kirgessen (of whome wee haue spoken) and the Colmackes, which worship the Sunne, as they doe also a redde Cloth, faste∣ned to the toppe of a Pole, and eate Serpents, Wormes, and other filth. Neere to which he placeth (in his Mappe of Russia) certaine Statues, or Pillars of Stone,
which sometimes were Hoords of Men and Beasts feeding, transformed by diuine power (if it be not humane error) into this stonie substance, retaining their pristine shape. These Nations are either Tartars, or, in manner of life, like vnto them, and may therefore passe vnder that generall appellation. And this may suffice touching the Tartarian Nation and Religion; which in the West and South parts of their abode is Mahumetane, in the more Northerly and Easterly, partly Heathenish, partly Iewish, or Moorish, or mixed, or as may best aduantage them, and most please them, wandring in opinion in like sort as in their habitation. But I haue shewed my selfe no Tartarian, whiles I dwell so long on this Tartarian Discourse, happily herein as tedious to the Reader, as staying in one place would be to the Tartar; a thing to him so abhominable, as in anger he wisheth it as a Curse, Would GOD thou mayest abide in one place, as the Christian, till thou smell thine owne dung. In∣deede this Historie, not throughly handled before by any one, drew me along, and I hope will purchase pardon to this prolixitie. CHAP. XIIII. Of the Nations which liued in, or neere, to those parts, now possessed by the Tartars: and their Religions and Customes. FRom those Countries, inhabited by the Persians and Zagathayan Tar∣tars Eastward, we cannot see with M. Paulus his eyes (the best guides we can get for this way) any Religion but the Saracen, till we come to Bascia, a Prouince somewhat bending to the South, the people where∣of are Idolaters and Magicians, cruell and deceitfull, liuing on Flesh and Rice. Seuen daies iourney from hence is Chesmur, wickedly cun∣ning in their deuillish art, by which they cause the dumbe Idols to speake, the day to grow darke, and other maruellous things, being the well-spring of Idols and Idolatrie in those parts. They haue Heremits after their Law, which abide in their Monasteries, are very abstinent in eating and drinking, containe their bodies in strait chastitie, and are very carefull to abstaine from such sinnes, wherewith they thinke their Idols offen∣ded, and liue long. There are of them many Monasteries: They are obserued of the people with great reuerence. The people of that Nation shed no bloud, nor kill any flesh: but if they will eate any, they get the Saracens, which liue amongst them, to kill it for them. North-Eastward from hence is Vochan, a Saracenicall Nation; and after many dayes iourney ouer Mountaines (so high, that no kinde of birds are seene there∣on) is Beloro, inhabited with Idolaters. Cascar (the next Countrey) is Mahumetane, beyond which are many Nestorian Christians in Carchan. There are also Moores, or Mahumetanes, which haue defiled with like superstition the Countries of Cotam and Peym (where the women may marrie new husbands, if the former be absent aboue twentie dayes This Mari∣age admits no Non-residence , and the men likewise) and of Ciarcian, & Lop. From Lop they crosse a Desart, which asketh thirtie dayes, and must carrie their victuals with them. Here (they say) spirits call men by their names, and cause them to stray from their company, and perish with famine. When they are passed this Desart, they enter into Sachion, the first Citie of Tanguth, an idolatrous Prouince, subiect to the great Can: there are also some Nestorians and Saracens, where they haue had the Art of Printing these thousand yeares. They haue Monasteries replenished with Idols of diuers sorts, to which they sacrifice, and when they haue a male child borne, they commend it to some Idoll, in whose honour they nourish a Ramme in their house that yeare, and after on their Idols festiuall, they bring it, together with their sonne, before the Idoll, and sacrifice the Ramme, and dressing the flesh, let it stand till they haue finished their prayers for their childs health: in which space (they say) their Idoll hath sucked out the principall sub∣stance of the meat: which they then carrie home to their house, and assembling their kinsfolke, eat it with great reuerence & reioycing, sauing the bones in goodly vessels.
The Priests haue for their Fee the Head, Feet, Inwards, Skinne, and some part of the Flesh. When any of great place dieth, they Funerall ob∣seruances in Sachion. assemble the Astrologers, and tell the houre of his natiuitie, that they may by their Art finde a Planet fitting to the burning of the corpes, which sometime, in this respect, attendeth this fierie constellation a weeke, a moneth, or halfe a yeare: in all which time, they set before the corpes a Table furni∣shed with Bread, Wine, and other Viands, leauing them there so long as one might conueniently eate them, the Spirit there present (in their opinion) refreshing himselfe with the odour of this prouision. If any euill happen to any of the house, the Astro∣logers ascribe it to the angrie soule for neglect of his due houre, agreeing to that of his Natiuitie: They make many stayes by the way, wherein they present this departed soule with such cates, to hearten it against the bodies burning. They paint many pa∣pers, made of the Barkes of Trees, with pictures of Men, Women, Horses, Camels, Money, and Rayment, which they burne together with the bodie, that the dead may haue to serue him in the next world. And all this while of burning is the Musicke of the Citie present, playing. Chamul, the next Prouince, is idolatrous, or heathenish: for so we distinguish them from Saracens, Iewes, and Christians, which I would were not as guiltie of Idolatrie as the former, in so many their forbidden Rites, although these haue all, and the other, part of the Scriptures, whereof those Heathens and Idolaters are vtterly ignorant. Here they not onely permit, but account it a great honour to haue their wiues and sisters at the pleasure of such strangers as they entertaine, themselues departing the while, and suffering all things to be at their guests will: for so are their Idols serued, who therefore for this hospitalitie (they thinke) will prosper all that they haue. And when as Mangu Can forbad them this beastly practise, they abstained three yeares; but then sent a pitifull Embassage to him, with request, That they might continue their former custome, for since they left it, they could not thriue: who, ouercome by their fond importunitie, graunted their request; which they with ioy accepted, and doe still obserue. In the same Prouince of Tanguth is Succuir, whose Mountaines are clothed with Rheubarbe, from whence it is by Marchants conueyed through the world. Campion is the mother Citie of the Countrey, inhabited by Idolaters, with some of the Arabi∣an and Christian Nations. The Christians had there, in the time of M. Polo, three faire Churches. The Idolaters had many Monasteries, abounding with Idols of Wood, Earth, and Stone, couered with Gold, and artificially made, some great, tenne paces in length lying along, with other little ones about them, which seeme as their disciples, to doe them reuerence. Their religious persons liue, in their opinion, more honestly then other idolaters, although their honestie is such, as that they thinke it no sinne to lye with a woman, which shall seeke it at their hands; but if the man first make loue, it is sinnefull. They haue also their Fasting-dayes, three, foure, or fiue in a moneth, in which they shedde no bloud, nor eate flesh. They haue many wiues; of which, the first-married hath the first place and preheminence. Here M. Paul liued about a yeare. Touching the Religion and Customes in Tanguth, the reports Ramusius. of Caggi Memet in Ramusius (who of late yeares was in Campion) are not much different. He sayth, That their Temples are made like the Christians, capable of foure or fiue thousand persons. In them are two Images of a man and woman, lying in length fortie foot, all of one Piece, or Stone: For which vse they haue Carts with fortie wheeles, drawne of fiue or sixe hundred Horse and Mules, two or three moneths iourney. They haue also little Images, with sixe or seuen heads, and tenne hands, holding in each of them seuerall things, as a Serpent, Bird, Flower, &c. They haue Monasteries, wherein are men of holy life, neuer comming forth, but haue foode carried them thither dayly: Their gates are walled vp; and there are infinite of Frier-like companions passing to and fro in the Citie. When any of their kindred die, they mourne in white. They haue Printing, not much vnlike to that which is vsed in Europe; and Artillerie
on their walls very thicke, as haue the Turkes. All the Catayans and Idolaters are forbidden to depart out of their natiue Countrey. They haue three Sciences, Chimia, Limia, and Simia: the first, Alchymie; the second, to make enamoured; the third, Iugling, or Magicke. Succuir also is, according to his report, great and faire, beautified with many Tem∣ples. Their Rheubarbe they would not bestow the paines to gather, but for the Mar∣chants, which from China, Persia, and other places, fetch it from them at a cheape price. Nor doe they in Tanguth vse it for Physicke, as we here, but with other ingre∣dients make perfumes thereof for their Idols: and in some places they burne it in stead of other firing, and giue it their horses to eat. They set more price by an hearbe which they call Mambroni cini, medicinable for the eyes, and another called Chiai Catai, growing in Catay at Cacianfu, admirable against very many diseases, an ounce whereof they esteeme as good as a sacke of Rheubarbe; whose description you may see at large, according to the relation and picture of the said Chaggi, in Ramusius: for (to adde that also) they haue many Painters, and one Countrey inhabited onely by them. These Tanguthians are bearded as men in these parts, especially some time of the yeare. Northwards from Tanguth is the plaine M. Paul. of Bargu, in customes and manners like to the first Tartars, confining with the Scythian Ocean, fourescore dayes iourney from Ezina, in the North parts of Tanguth, and situate vnder the North starre. Eastward of Tanguth (somewhat inclining to the South) is the Kingdome of Erginul, addicted likewise to Ethnike superstitions, wherein yet are some, both Nestorians and Mahu∣metans. Here are certaine wilde Bulls as bigge as Elephants, with manes of white and fine haire, like silke; of which, some they tame, and betwixt them and their tame Kine engender a race of strong and laborious Oxen. Here is found a beast also, as bigge as a Goat, of exquisit shape, which euery full Moone hath an apostemation or swelling vn∣der the bellie, which the Hunters (at that time chasing the said beast) doe cut off, and drie against the Sunne, and it proueth the best Muske in the world. The next Easterly Countrey is Egrigaia, idolatrous, and hauing some Christians of the Sect of Nestorius. But Tenduc, next adioyning, was at that time gouerned by King George, a Christian and a Priest of the posteritie of Presbyter Iohn, subiect to the Grand Can. And the Grand Cans giue commonly their daughters in marriage to this gener∣ation and stocke of Presbyter Iohn. The most part of the inhabitants are Christians, some Idolaters and Mahumetans being there also. There be also that are called Argon, des∣cended of Ethnikes and Moores, the wisest and properest men in those parts. All the people, from hence to Cathay, are Christian, Mahumetan, and Gentile, as themselues like best. In Thebet, the next Countrey, the people in times past (saith W.de Rubr.c.28. Odoricus saith the same. Will. de Rubru∣quis) bestowed on their parents no other Sepulchre then their owne bowels, and yet in part retaine it, making fine cuppes of their deceased parents skuls, that drinking out of them in the middest of their iolitie, they may not forget their progenitors. They haue much gold, but hold it an high offence to imprison it, as some doe with vs, in Chests or Treasuries: and therefore hauing satisfied his necessitie, they lay vp the rest in the earth, fearing otherwise to offend GOD. Cambalu is in the Northeast parts of Cathay: and fortie miles Westward from hence (all which way is enriched with Palaces, Vineyards, and fruitfull Fields) is Gouza, a faire Citie, & great, with many Idoll-Monasteries. Here the way parteth, leading Westward into Cathay, and South-Eastward vnto Mangi, or China. Tanifu and Cacianfu are Prouinces, which trend Westward from hence, inha∣bited with idolatrous Nations, and here and there some of the Arabian and Christian profession, full of Cities. Cunchin and Sindinfu are Ethnikes; as is Thebeth: where they haue a brutish custome, livert. re∣porteth the like custome in Calicut. not to take a wife that is a virgin; and therefore, when Marchants passe that way, the mothers offer vnto them their daughters, much striuing which of them may be the most effectuall bawd to her child. They taking to their pleasure such as they like, gratifie them with some Iewell, or other Present, which on her marriage-day she weareth, and she which hath most of such presents, bringeth the most accepted dowrie to her husband, as testimonies of the great fauour of their Idols.
This Thebeth contained sometimes eight Kingdomes, with many Cities, but was now desolated by the Tartarians. There are great Necromancers, which by their infernall skill cause Thunders and Tempests. They haue Dogges as bigge as Asses, with which they catch wilde Oxen and all sorts of Beasts. Caindu is an Heathenish Nation, where, in honour of their Idols, they prostitute their wiues, sisters, and daughters to the lust of trauellers; which being entertained in the house, the good man departeth, and the woman setteth some token ouer the dore, which there remaineth as long as this stallion-stranger, for a signe to her husband, not to returne till the guest be as well gone from her house, as honestie from her heart, and wit from his head. They make money of Salt, as in Cathay of Paper. In Ca∣raian also (a large Prouince adioyning) there are some Christians and Saracens, but the most Ethnikes, which are not discontented, that other men should lye with their wiues, if the women be willing. Carazan is of like ir-religion; their soules captiuated to the Old Serpent, and their bodies endangered to mightie huge bodies of The serpents of Carazan. Serpents, tenne paces long and tenne spannes thicke, which that Countrey yeeldeth. They keepe in their dennes in the day, and in the night prey vpon Lions, Wolues, and other Beasts, which when they haue deuoured, they resort to some water to drinke, and by their weight leaue so deepe im∣pression in the sand, that hereby men knowing their haunt, doe vnderset this their Tract with sharpe stakes, headed with yron, couering the same againe with sand; by this meanes preying on the spoyler, and deuouring the deuourer; esteeming nothing more sauourie then the flesh, nor more medicinable then the gall of this Serpent. More Serpentine then this diet, was that custome which they vsed, when any proper and personable Gentleman, of valorous spirit, and goodly presence, lodged in any house amongst them: in the night they killed him, not for the spoyle, but that his soule, furnished with such parts of bodie and minde, might remaine in that house. Much hope of future happinesse to that house did they repose in so vnhappie attempts. But the great Can killed this Serpent also, ouerthrowing this custome in the conquest of that Prouince. Cardandan confineth on the Westerne limits of Carazan. They make blacke lifts in their flesh, rasing the skinne, and put therein some blacke tincture, which e∣uer remayneth, Naked pride. accounting it a great ornament. When a woman is deliuered of a child, the man lieth in, and keepeth his bed, with visitation of Gossips, the space of for∣tie dayes. They worship the ancientest person of the house, ascribing to him all their good. In this Prouince, and in Caindu, Vocian, and Iaci, they haue no Physicians, but when any be sicke, they send for their Witches or Sorcerers, and acquaint them with their maladie. They cause Minstrells to play, while they daunce and sing, in ho∣nour of their Idoles, not ceasing till the Deuill entreth into one of them, of whome those Sorcerers demand the cause Infernall Physicke. of the parties sickenesse and meanes of recouerie. The 'Demoniake answereth, for some offence to such or such a God. They pray that God of pardon, vowing that when hee is whole, hee shall offer him a sacrifice of his owne bloud. If the Deuill see him vnlikely to recouer, he answereth, that his offen∣ces are so grieuous, that no sacrifice can expiate: but if there be likelyhood of recoue∣rie, he enioyneth them a sacrifice of so many Rammes with blacke heads, to be offe∣red by these Sorcerers, assembled together with their wiues, and then will that god be reconciled. This is presently done by the kinsmen of the sicke, the sheepe killed, their bloud hurled vp towards Heauen. The Sorcerers and Sorceresses make great lights, and incense all this visited house, making a smoake of Lignum Aloes, and cast∣ing into the aire the water wherein the sacrificed flesh was sodden, with some spiced drinkes, laughing, singing, dauncing in honour of that God. After all this reuel-rout, they demaund againe of the Demoniake, if the God be appeased: if so, they fall to those spiced drinkes, and sacrificed flesh with great mirth, and being well apayed, re∣turne home; if not, they (at his bidding) renue their superstition, ascribing the reco∣uerie (if it happen) to that Idoll: and if he dieth notwithstanding, they shift it off to the want of their full due, fleecing, or tasting the same before, to the Idols defrauding.
Thus they doe in all Catay and Mangi. Thus much out of the large Reports of Paulus. Rubruquius telleth the like of Cailar and Caracoram, where he had been in these Ca∣tayan Prouinces, concerning their Christopher or Giant-like Idols, and Idoll Temples: in one of which he saw a man, with a crosse drawne with inke on his hand, who see∣med by his answeres to be a Christian, with Images like to that of Saint Michael and other Saints. They haue a Sect called Iugures, whose Hypocritical shauclings. Priests are shauen, and cladde in saffron-coloured garments, vnmarried, an hundred or two hundred in a cloister. On their holy-dayes they place in their Temples two long formes, one ouer against ano∣ther, whereon they sit with bookes in their hands, reading softly to themselues. Nor could our Author (entering amongst them) by any meanes breake this their silence: They haue, wheresoeuer they goe, a string about them full of nut-shells, like the Po∣pish bead-rolls; alway they are vttering these words, Ou mam hactani, GOD thou knowest, expecting so many rewards, as they make such memorialls of GOD. They haue a Church-yard, and a Church-porch, with a long pole on it (as it were a steeple) adioyning to their Temples. In those porches they vse to sit and conferre. They weare certaine ornaments of paper on their heads. Their writing is downwards, and so from the left hand to the right; which the Tartars receiued from them. They vse Magicall characters, hanging their Temples full of them. They burne their dead, and lay vp the ashes in the top of a Pyramis. They beleeue there is one GOD, that he is a Spirit: and their Images they make not to represent GOD, but in memoriall of the rich after their death, as they professed to Rubruquius. The Priests (besides their saffron-iackets buttoned close before) weare on their left shoulder a cloake, descending before & be∣hind vnder their right arme, like to a Deacon carrying the Houselboxe in Lent. They worship towards the North, clapping their hands together, and prostrating them∣selues on their knees vpon the earth, holding also their foreheads in their hands. They extend their Temples East and West in length; vpon the North-side they build (as it were) a vestrie; on the South a Porch. The doores of their Temples are alwayes ope∣ned to the South. A certaine Nestorian Priest told him of so huge an Idoll, that might be seene two dayes before a man came at it. Within the Quier, which is on the North side of the Temple, they place a chest long and broad, like a table, and behind that chest stands their principall Idoll, towards the South: round about which, they place the other lesse Idols: and vpon that chest they set candles, and oblations. They haue great Bells, like vnto ours. The Nestorians of those parts, pray with hands displayed before their breasts, so to differ from that Iugurian Rite of ioyning hands in prayer. Thus farre W. de Rubruquis, who was there An. 1253. In Thebet (saith Odoricus) re∣sideth the Abassi, or Pope of the Idolaters, distributing religious preferments to those Easterne Idolaters, as the Roman Pope doth in the West. CHAP. XV. Of other Northerne people adioyning to the Tartars. ABout the mouth of the riuer Ob, Zlata Baba. Ortel. G. B. B. is said to be an ancient Idoll, in forme of an old woman, holding in each arme a child, and a third at her feet, called by her worshippers (the Iugri, Obdorani and Condo∣rani) Zlata Baba, that is, the golden old wife, to which they offer precious Furres, and sacrifice Harts, besmearing the mouth and eyes of the Idoll with the bloud. In the time of their sacrificing, the Priest demands of the Idoll touching things to come, and sometime receiueth an∣swere. The Samoyeds are Idolaters and Witches, obseruing diuellish superstitions, as wit∣nesseth Richard Iohnson, who in the fifth of Ianuary, 1557. saw amongst them, as R. Iohnson, apud Hak.to.1. fol∣loweth. The Samoyeds about the banckes of Pechere, are in subiection to the Mus∣couite,
and when they will remoue from one place to another, then they will make sa∣crifices, in manner following. Euery kindred doth sacrifice in their owne tent, and he that is most ancient, is their Priest. And first the Priest doth begin to play vpon a thing like to a great fiue, with a skinne on the one end like a drumme; his drumme-sticke is about a span long, and one end is round like a ball, couered with the skin of an Hart. Also the Priest hath as it were a white garland on his head, and his face is couered with a peece of a shirt of male, with many small ribbes, and teeth of fishes and wilde beasts hanging thereon. Then he singeth, as wee vse here in England to hollow, whoope, or shout at Hounds, and the rest of the company answere him with this Outes Igha, Igha, Igha, to which the Priest with his voice replieth. And they answere him with the selfe-same words, so many times, till in the end, he become, as it were, madde, falling downe as he were dead, hauing nothing on him but a shirt, and lying on his backe. I perceiued him yet to breath, and asked why he lay so: they answered, Now doth our GOD tell him what we shall doe, and whither we shall goe. And when he had lien still a little while, they cried thus three times together, Oghao, Oghao, Oghao, and as they vse these three calls, hee riseth with his head, and lieth downe a∣gaine; and then he rose vp and sang with like voices as he did before, with the like answere, Igha, Igha, Igha. Then he commaunded them to kill fiue Ollens, or great Deere, and continued singing still, both he and they as before. Then he tooke a sword of a cubit and a spanne long (I did mete it my selfe) and put it into his belly halfe way, and sometime lesse, but no wound was to be seene; they continuing their sweet song still. Then he put the sword into the fire, till it was warme, and so thrust it into the slit of his shirt, and thrust it thorow his bodie, as I thought, in at his nauell, and out at his fundament, the point being out of his shirt behinde, I laid my finger vpon it. Then he pulled out the sword, and sate downe. This being done, they set a kettle of water ouer the fire to heate, and when the wa∣ter doth seeth, the Priest beginneth to sing againe, they answering him. For so long as the water was in seething, they sate and sang not. Then they made a thing being foure square, and in height and squarenes of a chaire, and couered with a gowne very close the fore-part thereof, for the hinder-part stood to the tents side. Their tents are round and are called Chome, in their language, The water still seething on the fire, and this square seat being readie, the Priest put off his shirt, and the thing like a garland, which was on his head, with those things which couered his face, and he had on yet all this while a paire of hosen of Deere-skinnes, with the haire on, which came vp to his but∣tockes. So he went into the square seat, and sate downe like a Taylor, and sang with a strong voice or hollowing. Then they tooke a small line made of Deere-skinnes of foure fathomes long, and with a small knot the Priest made it fast about his necke, and vnder his left arme, and gaue it to two men standing on each side of him, which held the ends together. Then the kettle of hot water was set before him in the square seat, which seat they now couered with a gowne of broad-cloath without lining (such as the Russes vse to weare). Then the two men which did hold the end of the line, still standing there, began to draw, and drew till they had drawn the ends of the line stiffe, and together; and then I heard a thing fall into the kettle of water, which was before him in the tent. I asked what it was, and they answered, his head, shoulder, and left arme, which the line had cut off, I meane the knot, which I saw afterward drawne hard together. Then I rose vp, and would haue looked whether it were so or not, but they laid hold on me, and said, that if they should see him with their bodily eyes, they should liue no longer. (And the most part of them can speake the Russian tongue, to be vnderstood, and they tooke me to be a Russian) Then they began to hallow with these words, Oghaoo, Oghaoo, Oghaoo, many times together: in the meane while I saw a thing like a finger of a man, two times together, thrust thorow the gowne from the Priest. I asked them that sate neere to me what it was, that I saw, and they said, not his finger, for he was yet dead; and that which I saw appeare thorow the gowne, was a beast, but what beast they knew not, nor would not tell. And I looked vpon the gown, and there was no hole to be seene. At last the Priest lifted vp his head, with his shoulder
and arme, and all his body, and came out to the fire. Thus farre of their seruice, which I saw during the space of certaine houres. But how they doe worship their Idols, that I saw not: for they put vp their stuffe to remoue from that place where they lay. And I went to him that serued their Priest, and asked him what their GOD said to him, when he lay as dead. He answered, that his owne people doth not know, neither is it for them to know, for they must doe as he commanded. The Hollanders in the yeare 1594. sent to discouer a way to Cathay and China, by the Northeast, Hak. Voy. to.1. Gerard de Veer ap. De Bry in 3 part. Ind. Orient. which by Master Burrough, Pet and Iacman, English men, had beene long before in vaine attempted. William Barentz was the chiefe pilot for this Discoue∣rie. This yeare Nauig.1. they sailed through the Straits of Vaygats, and thought themselues not farre short of the Riuer Ob. The next yeare they returned for the same discouery. They Nauig.2. landed in the Samogithians or Samoyeds countrey, and named a place, because they there found Images carued of wood, Idoll-nooke. They gaue names to places long before discouered by the English, as if they had beene the first founders. They learned of certaine Muscouites, that the inhabitants of Noua Zemla, had neither Re∣ligion nor Ciuilitie prescribed them by any Law, but worshipped the Sunne, Moone, and North-Starre, and euery yeare offered vnto them sacrifices of Deere and other things. On the nine and twentieth of August there arose a thicke fogge, whereup∣on. Oliuer Brunel (which had beene three seuerall yeares sent by the King of Den∣marke, for the discouerie of Groenland) reporteth that in threescore and sixteene de∣grees, he had often obserued such thicke fogges, that some perished therby. These hap∣pened most commonly in October and Nouember. The last of August they had speech with the Samoyeds: they were of Description of the Sa∣moyeds. short stature, scarcely foure foote high, with long haire, broad faces, great heads, little eyes, short and bow-legs, very swift, clothed with beasts skins, whereof the hairy side was outward. They know no GOD. The Sunne (whose presence they are long depriued of in the Winter, which is recompensed in their nightlesse Summer) is worshipped amongst them. And when the Sunne is decli∣ning out of their sight, the Moone, or North-Starre, is his receiuer or successour (if you will) in that tribute of their deuotions. They haue, besides, many Idols rudely carued. In times past they had no King, but now they chuse one to that dignitie. They burie their dead, and offer yearely their sacrifices for them to the Sunne, Moone, and North∣Starre, of their Deere, which they burne, except the head and feet. They eat the flesh of wilde beasts, either raw, or dried in the aire; which makes them haue very vnsauourie breath. On the sixth of September two of them went on shore, on the continent of Moscouia, and encountred with a Beare, which killed one of them: his crie brought in others of their fellowes (which were also straggling about) to his reskue, but the Beare laid hold also vpon one of them, and could not be driuen to forsake his prey, till him∣selfe became a prey in recompence. The two torne carkasses were there buried. They tooke off from one Beare, which they killed, an hundred pound of fat, which serued them for their lampes: the skinne was nine foot large, and seuen wide. In the yeare 1596. Nauig.3. There were sent other two shippes, to prosequute this Disco∣uerie, which on the fourth of Iune had sight of a triple Sunne, attended and guarded with a double Rain-bow, one encompassing them, the other crossing them ouerthwart. After many dreadfull combates with the ice, and one of the shippes departing from the other, they were forced to Winter in Nona Zemla; where they built them a house to serue them for a fortification against the sauage Beares, tempestuous stormes, con∣tinuall snowes, ice, and vnspeakeable cold; and (if worse may be) a worse then all these they endured, a continuall night of many weekes, wherein neither the Sunne, nor any of his courtly traine, the least rayes to bee the harbengers of his desired pre∣sence, did present themselues to their eyes: and the fire could scarcely preuaile against the insulting tyrannie of the cold, to warme them. The Beares together with the Sun forsooke them, but plentie of Foxes remained; and with the Sunne the Beares also re∣turned: sometime laying violent siege to their house. From the fourth of Nouember till the seuen and twentieth of Iannarie they saw no Sunne. Their watch also or clocke was by violence of the cold forced to stand still, that they could not measure their
times. Thus did they waite i expectation of the Sunnes returne, that they also (not able further to pursue the voyage) might returne home, which eleuen of them did in October following. But seeing these North-easterne seas are so frozen and vnpassable, I will therefore in an inkie sea finde an easier passage for the Reader, with more both ease and securi∣tie, to this mightie Kingdome of China, whereof we are next to speake. CHAP. XVI. Of the Kingdome of China. CHina is supposed of some, to be that countrey, whose people of Ptelo∣mey Ptol.Geog.l.7.c.3. are called Sinae. Some thinke them to be the people mentioned by the Prophet Esay Es.49.12. Osor.in parap. Iun. Annot. , whereunto Iunius also inclineth. The Arabi∣ans call them  Tzinin: and the Portugals first of all other (be∣cause they could not pronounce it aright) called them Chinians (saith Scal. Can. Isag. lib.3. Ioseph Scaliger): Pierre du Iarric, saith, Pierre du Iarric lib.4. del'histoire des Indes Orient. cap.17. that before that time in all the East they were called Chijs, and the inhabitants of Ceilan were called Chinga∣les, because they were mixed with the Chinois; and Cinamom, was of the Persians named Darchini, that is, wood of China, as some thinke: he addeth their opinion that deriue that name from the Chinian salutation, in which they vse the word Chij, Chij, as a nickname therefore giuen them: and others that thinke the Citie Chincheo gaue name to the whole Region: but it were tedious to recite heere the seuerall opinions in this question; the difficultie whereof ariseth from this, that the Chinois themselues know not this name, but call their countrey Tamen. Leauing therefore these deriua∣tions and names of Cin, Cauchin China, Battechina, and the rest; let vs come to the Countrey it selfe. It bordereth Gotard. Arthus hist. Indis Orient.cap.49. on the North, with Catay and the Tartars; on the South, with Cauchin China; on the East, with the Sea; on the West, with the Bra∣mas. It reacheth from seuenteene degrees to two and fortie of Northerly Latitude, and lieth after their owne description Iac. Pantog. almost foure square. On the West it is separated and secure from vnneighbourly neighbours, by a sandie wildernesse; on the North, by a wall, which Nature hath partly framed of high mountaines, and Art hath supplied with the labour and industrie of men. It is diuided into fifteene Prouinces; sixe whereof border on the Sea, Cantan, Foquien, Chequiam, Nanquin, Xantum, Pa∣quin: the other nine bee inland, Qniansi, Huquam, Honan, Xiensi, Xansi, Suchnon, Qutichen, Iunan, Coansi. Some reckon these names somewhat differently. The King holdeth his Court in Paquin; his predecessours, before the Tartarian conquest of this countrey, are said to haue resided in Nanquin, or (according to the more ancient wri∣ters) in Quinsay. Pantogia reporteth his owne iourney from Macao to Paquin, the space of sixe hundred leagues, in all that space trauelling but one day by land, for shortning his way, otherwise all the way by water, carried in a Riuer, called of the Chinians a little sea for the greatnesse, abounding with sea-fish, an hundred leagues vp from the sea, and after that in another Riuer of like bignesse, whose waters were thicke and mirie, which they clarifie with allume, before they can drinke it: all the rest of the streames that he passed were made by mens hands,. These Riuers are abun∣dantly stored with shipping of two sorts; one for sayling, and the other for habitati∣on: and from Nanquin to Paquin the space of three hundred leagues, it seemed to be, as it were, a continued street of shippes: and though they came in the morning be∣times to Nanquin, yet were there the same houre aboue fiue hundred saile of vessels, vnder saile readie to enter, which were laden with prouision for the Citie. The Kings shippes in that Region about Nanquin, are reported to bee about ten thousand, to carrie his tents and tributes, besides a thousand saile belonging to priuate men. The shippes wherein the Mandarines, or Magistrates and Officers are carried, are not in∣feriour in sumptuous statelinesse to the shippes Royall in Europe. The Riuers are no
lesse adorned and beautified with Cities, Townes, and Villages, so many, as that in all this way they had alway sight of one or other: and so great, that sometime they sailed two or three houres with the streame alongst the walls of some Citie. Their Townes and Cities haue high walles. Nanquin standeth in two and thirty degrees, and is eight or ten leagues from the sea, with a Riuer leading thither. All their Ci∣ties are alike, except in big∣nesse. It hath three faire bricke walles, with large and stately gates. The streetes are of two leagues, or of two and a halfe in length, wide, and paued. The compasse is at least eleuen or twelue leagues, and containeth by con∣iecture two hundred thousand houses, and (according to all the opinions of the Ie∣suites there abiding) equalling, or exceeding in people foure of the greatest Cities in Europe. There are diuers other Cities within a dayes iourney hereof, which are great and famous for traffique, of which Hancheum and Sucheum are chiefe, which are of the Chinians called Paradise, for the plentie of all things. Sucheum is as Ve∣nice in situation, hauing her streets part by water, and part on land; so rich in traffique, that the China-bookes do reckon twelue millions of reuenue to accrew from hence to the Kings coffers: and he that seeth these Cities (saith the Iesuite) will beleeue those reports. To stay heere a while, That After I had written this, I was further confirmed in my opinion by the relation of the Citie of Quinsay, large∣ly written by Contugo Contug∣bi in la 4. parte del Thesoro politico cap.47. who is of the same mind. Quinsay, whilome the royall seate of the Kings of Mangi (as Venetus recordeth) now supposed to be swallowed vp with some Earth∣quake, or in Bellonaes all-consuming belly deuoured, may seeme to be heere raised from the graue: the waterie streets; the trade and reuenue, exceeding alone (if some Botero Relat. part.2. account truly) any one the richest Kingdome in Europe: the situation in the mid∣dest of China, and neere to the sea; the signification, Quinsay being interpreted, The Citie of heauen: and so is Suntien (in the discourse Lib.1.cap.8. of this Kingdome, translated by R. Parke) said to signifie. All these reasons doe moue me to coniecture, that Quin∣say is now by euersion of Earth-quake, warres, or both, and by diuersion of the Court from thence, conuerted into this smaller Sucheum, the name also a little inuer∣ted, remaining, as diuers languages and dialects will suffer, almost the same. Or per∣happes sickening with so long warres (begunne in the time of M. Paulus, and con∣tinuing in the dayes of our countrey-man Mandeuile, almost an hundred yeares af∣ter, both of them seruing the great Cam in those warres.) Quinsay at last, after so long and tedious a consumpation, died, and bequeathed what suruiued those spoiles, of her land-greatnesse vnto Nanquin, of her sea-treasures vnto Sucheum, both succee∣ding, but not together equalling (that wonder of the world) Quinsay, M.Paulus lib.2.cap.68. encompas∣sing an hundred miles, and twelue thousand bridges, sixteene hundred thousand hous∣holds, with the countrey adioyning, then the ninth part of the Kingdome of Mangi yeelding sixteene millions and eight hundred thousand ducats of gold, besides six millions, and foure hundred thousand ducats for the custome of salt, in yearely reuenue to the great Of Quinsay see a particular and large discourse by Con. Contughi. Can. Well then may it beseeme Sucheum, and Nanquin, both to haue risen out of the ashes of such a Phoenix. Hereto agreeth the report of Nicolo di Conti (who was there about the yeare 1440.) that the King had then built Quinsay anew, thirtie miles circuit. But let vs listen to Pantogia. These Cities of China want that elegance and magnificence, which stately Tem∣ples, and sumptuous buildings doe afford vnto our Cities of Europe. Their houses are low, without the ornament of porches, galleries, windowes, and prospect into the streets. In the Winter Ant. Dal. meida. they haue store of ice and snow, euen about Nanquin. They haue abundance of all things necessarie to the life of man, fruits, flesh, and fish, with prices correspondent. They haue two, and some where three, haruests in the yeare. Few mountaines, but plaines of an hundred leagues. Wine they make of Rice. They eate thrice a day, but sparingly. Their drinke (be it water or wine) they drinke hot, and eat with two stickes of Iuory, ebony, or like matter, nor touching their meat with their hands: and therefore little naperie serueth them. Their warme drinkes and abstinence from fruits, are great preseruatiues of their health, which for the most part they enioy. The Chinians Description of the Chi∣nois. haue thinne beards (not aboue twentie haires) short noses, small blacke eyes, long garments, and, if they would resemble a deformed man, they paint
him with short habite, great eyes and beard, and a long nose. They are white, but not so much as in Europe. They haue Artificers of all trades: and in idlenesse none may liue. The impotent are well prouided for in Hospitals. They haue no Gentlemen, but euery man is a Plebeian vntill his merits raise him. Preferment is atchieued onely by learning. This maketh them generally studious. Their letters are not reduced into alphabeticall order, nor are properly letters, but characters, whereof they haue fortie thousand; and therefore in that they frame not difference of syllables, but of sence, in diuers languages, yea in Iapon, their writing is vnderstood, not their speaking. Their paper is like a thinne transparent parchment, and beareth inke but on one side. Their writing is downewards, not side-wayes, as ours. They haue in ordinary and daily vse eight or ten thousand of those characters. Their words are monosyllables. Rhetorique is the only science which they ayme at: for he obtaineth places of ho∣nour, which can most fitly place his words, and most eloquently write of the subiect propounded. They haue not publike Schooles, but in the Cities are publique trialls or commencements euery third yeare, whither these Probationers resort, and are ex∣amined, and are accordingly preferred. They haue three degrees: Descrip. Mac. Graduates of the first degree are called Siusai; of the second, Quiugin; of the third, Chinzu, Euerie Citie yeeldeth triall for the first degree. For the second, onely the Metropolitan Citie of the Prouince; whereunto they of the first degree doe resort euery third yeare, and in a publike house, doe the second time, make an Oration, of some obscurer theme then the former. There are such multitudes of them, that some are sometime killed in the entrance of that their Commencement-house. For the third degree, they are examined onely at the Court the third yeare after. And out of this Order are taken their Mandarines or Magistrates, after some studie in the law of the Land. While they are writing their Probationary Themes, they are shut vp, with one to attend them, foure and twentie houres, with penne, inke, paper, and candle, and hauing subscribed their names, certaine Registers copie the said Orations, without setting to the Authors names and then seale vp their first patterns. Those namelesse copies are by appointed Officers examined, and those chosen which they approue for best; the names & authors are known, by comparing these copies with the principall. In the first degree they obtaine certaine immunities to themselues and their families; prouided that he proceed in his studies, or else they will degrade him. He that hath obtained the third degree of Loytia, or, Loutea. Loytia (as they terme it, or as we may stile it, Doctor) writes it vp ouer his doores, that all men may honor his house: and this is the highest Nobili∣tie whereto they can ascend. To the elder brother of these fellow-commencers, is a triumphall arch erected, besides other solemnities. They haue bookes, written by cer∣taine wise-men or Philosophers two thousand yeares since or more, of Politicall and Morall Philosophie; the Authors whereof they honor for Saints, especially one Con∣fusius, to whom the Mandarines doe therefore once in the yeare offer sacrifice, and the Kings doe honor his posteritie, vnto this day. And he alone in the pith and weight of his Sentences, may be compared to Plato or Seneca, though farre short of their e∣legant and eloquent phrase. Their Printing is somewhat differing from ours, not ioy∣ning the letters, but for euery leafe making a table with letters or characters on both sides. They print also white letters in blacke, more atificially then we. Poetrie, Painting, and Musicke, are amongst them commendable qualities. Their learning is not so exceeding, as the first Chinian relations report, in the Mathematikes and o∣ther liberall Sciences. The principall Mandarines admire the Iesuites in these things, who esteeme the greatest learning of the Chinois, after their valuation, to be nothing superiour to that of the Romans, in the dayes of Cicero: (although it cannot bee denied, that Rome euen then approched neare her highest toppe of humane Science) It were an endlesse worke to recite the admirable things of this huge King∣dome: and therefore I remit the Reader to those diuers Authors, which haue written treatises of them. Yet out of these I hope the Reader will pardon me, to obserue some thing touching their politie and gouernment. This kingdome is by themselues Perera. called Tamen, and the
Inhabitants, Tamegines: China is a mere stranger in China. The King is absolute Mo∣narch, and in reuenue exceedeth all the Princes in Europe, and Afrike together: which ariseth out of that which is properly called Census, the poll-money of his sub∣iects Census. (paying three Mazes, or halfe ducats) exceeding thirtie Millions: and his Tributum. Tributes, out of the profits of the earth and their handicrafts, amounting to sixe and twenty mil∣lions after their own bookes: His Vectigal. Customes in Canton (one of the least Prouinces) are neere eight millions. Pantogia summeth the whole at a hundred and fifty millions. His expences are exceeding great; all the Mandarines, Eunuches or Courtiers, Souldiours, Hospitals, and Priests receiuing Stipends out of his Exchequer. The Kingdomes adia∣cent are willingly refused of his King, whose predecessors sometime possessed, after freed them, as bringing more burthen, then profit: which of late appeared in Corea, which the Iaponites inuaded, the Chinois defended, as abutting on the Frontires: but when the enemie left inuading, the defender soone after voluntarily relinquished these new subiects. The King hath one wife and many Concubines, whose children inherit, if the lawfull Wife bee barren: as euen now it happened; An. Do. 1602. Vanlia the present King be∣ing the sonne of a Concubine, as his apparant heire also is. These women are so strait∣ly kept that they are neither suffered to goe abroad, nor to speake vnto their kinsfolks, which likewise receiue no increase of honour or authoritie by their kinswomens ad∣uancement. His Courtiers are Eunuches, whom their poorer Parents haue gelded in their youth in hope of this Court-preferment, where after they are admitted by that Manderine appointed to this office, they are trained vp vnder elder Eunuches to bee made seruiceable. Of this drosse of mankinde are supposed to bee in the Court a hun∣dred and threescore thousand. This King is esteemed more tyrannicall, then his prede∣cessors, neither doth he euer come abroad, as they were wont once in the yeere, to sa∣crifice in the Temple sacred to Heauen and Earth. His Palace is farre more spacious, but not equall in workmanship to those in Europe. It is compassed with a triple wall, the first wherof might enuiron a large towne. Herein besides the many lodgings of the Eu∣nuches, are hills, groues, streames, and other things of pleasure. The Iesuite Pantogia. our Author saith, that he passed eight huge Pallaces before he came to the lodgings of those Eunu∣ches, which were appointed to learn how to order their Clockes or Watches, wherwith they had presented the King: and there were as many beyond. And ascending vp a towre, he saw Trees, Gardens, houses, exceeding all that euer hee had seene in Eu∣rope, who yet had beene in many the most sumptuous buildings therein. Within the third wall, is the King, with his women, children, and such seruants as are thither admitted. When the Heire apparant is proclaimed, all his other sons are sent away soone after, and confined to certaine cities, where they nothing participate in affaires of State: otherwise are honoured as the Kings kindred, liuing in pleasure in their Pallace∣prisons, vnto the third and fourth generation. The Kings Title is, Lord of the world, and Sonne of Heauen. The Mandarines haue their habite (both in attire and language) in their iudiciall proceedings peculiar. Of these Mandarines, (to omit them which are officers in each Citie) there are three principall in each Prouince. The first hath to deale in cases Criminall, and is called Ganchasu: The second is the Kings Fosterer or Treasurer, and is called Puchinsn: The Lieutenant for the warres, named Chumpin. These all are in subiection vnto the Tutan or Vice-roy of the Prouince. All these Ma∣gistrates beare office three yeares together, chosen alwaies out of other Prouinces, to auoide corruption. They haue an annuall officer called Chaien, who maketh inquisiti∣on of all crimes, both of priuate persons, and Magistrates themselues. None may exe∣cute the sentence of death, but by especiall Commission from the King. And therefore the Malefactors are consumed in the prisons. But they haue authoritie with certaine Canes to beare men on the legges in such terrible crueltie, that a few blowes may either lame or kill the partie. And therefore no King is more feared then these Man∣darines, who goe (or are carried rather) on mens shoulders in sumptuous chaires (such is their fashion) attended with fifty or threescore Sergeants going before them, two and two in a ranke, armed and furnished with Halberds, Maces, Battle-axes, Chaines, and these Canes: some crying to giue way, wherewith and the noise of those Chaines,
and Canes both men and dogges, with mute silence giue place. In the middest of their Cities are pallaces of the Kings for these officers to reside in. In Panquin and Nan∣quin the multitude of these Magistrates is incredible, one of these Cities containing more then two thousand and fiue hundred, as many as some-where are of Citizens. These all twise a day heare causes, and execute iustice. In Panquin are sixe Mandarines, Presidents of so many seueral Councels. The first of these is called the heauenly Manda∣rin for that his most ample power, which entreateth with the King for the preferment, Degradation, or correction of all the Mandarines in the Kingdome: for not one of them is there whose office is not by his Maiestie confirmed or abrogated. The second is Maister of the ceremonies, both in humane magnificence, and diuine saricfice. The third is Head of the councell of warre. The fourth, is chiefe Treasurer. The fift is Surueyor, and Procurer generall of the Kings buildings in his Palace, in the walls of Cities, and such like. The last dealeth as Chiefe vnder the King in causes criminall. These six are in∣feriour to one order of Mandarines, which are of the Kings Priuy Councell. These Ma∣gistrates are no way comparable in wealth to the Nobles in Europe. Their sentence a∣gainst guilty persons is without solemne furniture of words: as, Let him haue twen∣tie strokes, more or lesse, which by those Canine Cane-men is suddenly executed, the party lying grouelling on the ground. These Canes are cleft in the middest, three or foure fingers broad: twenty or thirty blowes will spoile the flesh, fifty or threescore wil aske long time to be healed, a hundred are vncurable. They vse also the Strappado, hoi∣sing them vp and downe by the armes with a cord. They be aboue measure patient in hearing causes: and their examinations are publike. Condemned persons haue a pillory∣boord fastned about their necke, & hanging downe before them to the knees, in which his fellony or treason is expressed, which boord neither suffereth them well to eate or sleepe, and in fine killeth him. There be in euery Metropolitane Citie foure principall houses for those three officers before mētioned: the fourth, for the Taissu, wherein is the principall gaole or prison, walled about, high and strong, with a gate of no lesse force: within the same are three other gates before you come where the prisoners lie, in the meane space are such as watch & ward day and night. The prison within is so great, that in it are streets & market-places, & neuer void of seuen or eight hundred men that goe at liberty. But by following Perera (sometime a prisoner there) into his prison, I find my selfe almost imprisoned, and therefore will flee hence into their Temples, & there take sanctuarie. Here they deale as madly with their Gods, as there with their men. CHAP. XVI. Of the Religion vsed in China. HOw much the greater things are reported of this so large a Countrey, and mighty a kingdome, so much the more compassion may it prouoke in Christian hearts, that amongst so many people there is scarse a Chri∣stian, who amongst so ample reuenues, which that King possesseth, pay∣eth either heart, or name, vnto the King of Heauen, till that in so huge a vintage, the Iesuits of late haue gleaned a few hādsuls to this profession. M. Paulus, N. di Conti & Odoricus call this country M. Polo. saith that in Zipangu (or Iapon) they called in Cin. Longobard saith that the Man∣dtrines called the country about Canton Mangines, that is, Barba∣rous rude and vnciuill; as, far from the Cities Royall. Mangi, which somewhat better a∣greeth with Tamen & Tamegine, as (Perera saith) they call thēselues, then China, which he thinketh from the neighbor country of Canchin-China was applied to this. It had (af∣ter Paulus) twelue hundred Cities, after Odoricus, two thousand, and yet both they describe an other large country of Catay more Northerly, that here againe we may pre∣uent such scruples. Their Religion was then, & continueth still (though with some al∣teration) Idolatrous or Ethnike, & it is thought Gi. Bst. Ben. that a great part of Asia, especially the I∣lands as far as Zeilan, & euen to Madagascar, borrowed some of their superstitions frō hence, as hither they sometime paid their tribute, vntil a fulnes and feare of surfet, caused the Chinois as you haue heard to let themselues bloud, and willingly to relinquish all that which they doe not now enioy. They were before the Tartarian conquest M. Polo. giuen
to Astrologie, and obserued Natiuities, and gaue directions in all matters of weight. These Astrologers or Magicians told Farfur the King of China or Mangi, that his king∣dome should neuer bee taken from him, but by one which had a hundred eyes. And such, in name, was The name signifieth a hundred eies. Chinsanbaian the Tartarian Captaine, which dispossessed him of his state, and conquered it to the great Can about 1269. This Farfur liued in great delica∣cie, nor did euer feare to meete with such an Argus. Hee brought vp yearely two hun∣dred thousand Infants, which their Parents could not prouide for: and euery yeare on certaine of his Idol-Holy-daies feasted his principall Magistrates, and all the wealthiest Citizens of Quinsay, ten thousand person at once, ten or twelue daies together. There were then some few Nestorian Christians; one Church at Quinsay; two at Cing∣hiansu, and a few others. They had many Idol-Monasteries. They burned their dead: the kinsmen of the dead accompanied the corpse, clothed in Canuas, with musicke and hymnes to their Idols: and when they came to the fire, they cast therein many papers wherein they had painted slaues, Horses, Camels, &c. as of the Cathayans is before re∣ported, to serue him in the next world. They returne, after their funerall rites are fini∣shed, with like harmony of instruments, and voices, in honour of their Idoles, which haue receiued the soule of the deceased. Odoricus Odoricus ap. Hak. affirmeth that at Kaitan or Zaiton, he found two Couents of Minorite-Fri∣ers, and many Monasteries of Idolaters, in one whereof he was, in which (as it was told him) were three thousand Votaries, and a hundred thousand Idols. One of those Idols (lesse then some others) was as bigge as the Popish Christopher. These Idols they feede euery day with the smoke of hot meates set before them: but the meate they late themselues. At Quinsay a Chinian conuert ledde him into a certaine Mona∣stery, where hee called to a Religious person and said: This Raban Francus, that is, this religious Frenchman commeth from the Sun-setting, and is now going to Camba∣leth, to pray for the life of the great Can, and therefore you must shew him some strange sight. Then the said religious person tooke two great baskets full of broken re∣liques, and led mee vnto a little walled parke, and vnlocked the doore. We entred in∣to a faire greene, wherein was a Mount in forme of a Steeple, replenished with hearbs and trees. Then did he ring with a Bell, at the sound whereof many creatures, like Apes, Cats, and Monkeys, came downe the Mount, and some had faces like men, to the number of foure thousand, putting themselues in good order, before whom hee set a platter, and gaue them those fragments. Which when they had eaten, hee rung the se∣cond time, and they all returned to their former places. I wondred at the sight, and de∣manded what creatures they were. They are (quoth he) the soules of Noble men which wee here feede for the loue of GOD, who gouerneth the world. And as a man was ho∣norable in his life, so his soule entreth after death into the body of some excellent beast, but the soules of simple and rusticall people possesse the bodies of more vile and bru∣tish creatures. Neither could I dissuade him from the opinion, or perswade him that a∣ny soule might remaine without a body. Nic. di Conts Nic. di Cont ap Ramus. saith, that when they arise in the morning, they turne their faces to the East, and with their hands ioined, say: GOD in Trinitie keepe vs in his Lawe. Their religion at this time is idolatrous and Pagan, wherein the common peo∣ple are somewhat Gotar Arthu cap.52. superstitious, but the King himselfe and the Mandarines, as seeing the vanitie thereof, and not able to see the truth, are in manner irreligious and peo∣fane: the first worship that which is Nothing in the world, and these finde nothing in the world, but the world and these momentany things to worship. Yet doe they acknowledge a Deitie of the Heauen and Earth, whereof the former Kings haue beene more superstitiously obseruant: and this Vanlia also, when as some few yeares since his pallace was fired with lightnings, being guiltie of his owne vnworthinesse, bee com∣manded his sonne to pray vnto heauen for reconciliation. And although Pantog. the Manda∣rines confine their happinesse with their liues, yet some of them are found admirable their grauitie and constancie of resolution. This appeared lately, when as the King, in loue of his second wife or concubine, would haue preferred her son to the title of Prince and hope of succession, neglecting the elder, which was the sonne of her, who among
his women had the fourth place, contrary to the lawes and customes of China: they all assembled together and presented a petition to the King, that forasmuch as hee would not bee admonished to obserue their auncient lawes in proclaiming the law∣full heyre apparant, that hee should seeke him new officers, and for their parts they resigned their Manderine-robes; which the King (relenting) caused them to resume, with promise of satisfaction to their demaund. There haue not wanted of them which haue publikely in writings (after their manner) expostulated with him of his vniust courses: and one on this sort, Although O King, I know the gibbet is already pit∣ched for mee, and the fire kindled to burne mee, yet will not I cease to reprehend thine iniuries and publike enormities. Amongst all their idols, Discourse of China.l.2. they obserue with great reuerence One, which they paint with three heads, continually looking each on other. Others they haue resembling the pictures of the Apostles. These were the Philiosophers wee spake off, whereof three are principall, Confusius, Xequiam and Tanzu. The first is in first and chiefe account for the inuention of part of their let∣ters, for his holinesse, and for his bookes of Morall vertues. Vpon the daies of the New and full Moone, Dialog.Mac. his disciples which are in manner all their men of lear∣ning, Mandarines and students, doe assemble themselues at the common schoole or commencement-house, and before his Image (which is worshipped with burning of Incense and Tapers) they doe bow their knees thrice, and bend their heads to the ground. The followers of the second are called Cen in China, and in Iapon, Bonzi, which shaue their heads and beards, and doe for the most part inhabit the temples of Xe∣quiam, or of other Saints of that profession, rehersing certaine prayers after their man∣ner on bookes, or beades, and haue some inckling of the life to come, with rewards an∣swerable to the well or ill spent life. The third sort, which follow Tanzu, differ in their long haire and some other ceremonies from the former, but they both liue in great con∣tempt, as men vnlearned and ignorant, and are not permitted to sit beside the Ma∣gistrates, but kneele before them, and are subiect to their punishment no lesse then the Vulgar. They weare on their heads a Tire like to a Miter (saith Nunnes:) twice was Melir Nunnes at Cantan, and could finde none of them which could so much as teach me their owne mysteries. Confusius his precepts prescribe the light of Nature as guide, ascribing much to the heauens, to Fate, to the worshipping their forefathers images, without mention of other God, in other things approching neerest to the the Truth. Nic. Longo∣bard. On the said Holidaies of the New and full Moone, a little before sunne rising, in all the Cities of this vast Kingdome, and in all the streets thereof at one and the same houre, they make publication and proclamation of sixe Precepts. First, Obey thy Fa∣ther and Mother: Secondly, Reuerence they elders and superiours: Thirdly, Keep peace with thy neighbours: Fourthly, Teach thy Children and posteritie: The fift enioineth euery one to discharge his office and calling. The last prohibiteth Crimes, as Murther, Adultery, Theft, and such like. These things doe their Mandarines cause to be obser∣ued; otherwise Atheists, not hauing reason or reasoning of the immortalitie of the soule, and future rewards, which yet some of their bookes and pictures of their Pao or God, resembling those infernall torments, might learne them. Both Manderines and others haue many images in their houses to which they sacrifice. But Admirande Reg. Sin. if they obtaine not their requests, they will whip and beate these Gods, and then set them againe in their places and with new incense seeke their reconcilement, renewing their prayers, and their stripes also, if their prayers be reiected. And in a word the Manderines are the Gods (or Diuels rather) whom the people most feare, as dreading blowes from them, which themselues at pleasure can and doe inflict on the other. This God-bea∣ting they vse with Lotts. Maffaus l.6. Disc. of china. For when any is to vndertake a iourney or any matter of weight, as buying, lending, marrying, &c. They haue two stickes flat on the one side, otherwise round, as bigge as a Wallnut, tied together with a small thread, which after many sweet oraisons they hurle before the Idoll. If one or both of them fall with the flat side vpwards, they reuile the Image with the most opprobrious termes: and then hauing thus disgorged their choller, they againe craue pardon vvith many fawning promises. But if at the second cast they finde no better fortune, they
passe form words to blowes, the deafe God is hurled on the earth into the water or fire, till at last with his vicissitude of sweet and sowre handling, and their im∣portunate reiterations of their casts, hee must needes at last relent, and is therefore feasted with hennes, musicke, and (if it bee of very great moment, which they con∣sult about) with a hogges head boiled, dressed with hearbes and flowers, and a pot of their Wine. They cut off the billes and clawes of their fowles, and the hogges snowe, and doe throwe vpon it graines of rice, and sprinkling it with Wine, set it in dishes vpon the Altar, and there make merry before their Idols. They obserue an other kinde of Lotts with stickes put together in a pot, and drawing out the same, consult, with a certaine booke they haue, of their destinie. But to returne to their varietie of Idols. Frier Gaspar de la Crux, being in Canton, entred a certaine Religious house, where he saw a chappell, hauing therein, besides ma∣ny other things of great curiositie, the image of a woman with a Child hanging about her necke, and a Lampe burning before her. The mysterie hereof (so like the Popish The picture of our Lady, & her blessed sonne. mysterie of iniquitie,) none of the Chinois could declare. The Sunne, the Moone, Starres, and especially Heauen it selfe, are Gods of the first forme in their Idoll∣schoole. They acknowledge Laocon Tzantey, the Gouernour of the great God (so it signifieth) to be aeternall and a Spirit. Of like Nature they esteeme Causay, vn∣to whom they ascribe the lower Heauen and power of life and death. They subiect vnto him three other spirits, Tanquam, Teyquam, Tzuiquam: the first supposed to bee Authour of raine; the second, of humane natiuitie, husbandry, and warres; the third is their Sea-Neptune. To these they offer victuals, odours, and Altar∣clothes: presenting them also with plaies and Comedies. They haue Images of the Deuill with Serpentine lockes, and as deformed lookes as here hee is painted, whom they worship, not to obtaine any good at his hand, but to detaine and holde his hand from doing them euill. They haue many hee and shee-Saints, in great venera∣tion, with long Legends of their liues. Amongst the cheefe of them are Sichia, the first inuentour of their religious Votaries of both sects; Quanina, an anchoresse; and Neoma a great Sorceresse. Frier Martin, in one Temple in Vcheo, told a hundred and twelue Idols. In time of trouble they haue familiaritie with the Diuell, as Pe∣dro de Alfaro obserued, beeing in a Ship with the Chinois, in this sort. They cause a man to lye on the ground grouelling, and then one readeth on a booke, the rest answering, and some make a sound with Bels and Tabors. The man in short space be∣ginneth to make visages and gestures, whereby they know the Diuel is entred and then doe they propound their requests, to which hee answereth by word or Letters. And when they cannot extort an answer by word, they spread a Red mantle on the ground, aequally dispersing all ouer the same a certaine quantitie of Rice. Then doe they cause a man that cannot write to stand there, themselues renuing their former inuocation, and the diuell entring into this man causeth him to write vpon the rice. But his answers are often full of lies. It were taedious to tell of their opinions touching the Creation. All being a rude and vnformed Chaos, Tayn (say they) framed and setled the Heauen and Earth. This Tayn created Pauzon and Pauzona. Pauzon by power of Tayn created Tanhom, and his thirteene brethren. Tanhom gaue names to all things, and knew their vertues, and with his said brethren multiplied their generations, which continued the space of ninety thousand yeares. And then Tayn destroyed the world for their pride, & created another man named Lotzitzam, who had two hornes of sweet sauour, out of which presently did spring forth both men and women. The first of these was Alazan, which liued nine hundred yeares. Then did the heauen create another man. (Lotzitzam was now va∣nished) named Atzion, whose mother Lutim was with childe with him onely in see∣ing a Lyons head in the ayre. This was done in Truchin, in the prouince of Santon: hee liued 800 yeers. After this, Vsao & Hantzui, and Ocheutey with his son Ezoulom, and his Nephew Vitei the first King of China, (they say) were the inuenters of diuers Artes. They haue Discourse of China.l.2. many Monasteries of foure differing orders of Religion, distinguished by the seuerall colours of their habit, black, yellow, white & russet. These foure orders are
said to haue their Generals (whom they call Tricon) which reside in Panquin. These ordaine Prouincials, who againe haue subordinated to them the Priors of seueral hou∣ses or Colledges, in those their houses acknowledged chiefe. The Generall is clothed with silke in his owne colour, and is carried on mens shoulders in an Iuory chaire by foure or sixe men of his habite. They liue partly of reuenues giuen them by the King, and partly by begging: which when they doe, they carry in their hands a certaine thing, wherein are prayers written, whereon the almes are laide, and the giuer thereby cleared of his money. I should haue said, of his sinne. They are It seemes that some Ro∣mish Friers haue beene there of olde shauen, vse beades, eate together, and haue their Cells, assist at burialls, arise two houres before day to pray vnto the heauen and Sinquian, who (they say) was the inuenter of that their manner of life, and became a Saint, in which their deuotion they continue vntill breake of day, singing and ringing of belles. Once, both the Friers which formerly, and the Iesuites which later haue beene there, affirme a great conformitie betwixt their and the Chi∣nian ceremonies. They may not marry in the time of their Monkish deuotion, but they may (acquainting the Generalls therewith) at their pleasure relinquish their vowe. The eldest sonnes may not enter into religion, because they are bound to su∣staine their aged parents. At the admittance of any is a great Feast, made by their friends. At the launching of any Ship, they dedicate the same to the Moone, or some Idoll: and besides there resort thither these Monkes, to make sacrifices in the poope, and reuerence the Deuill, whom they paint in the fore-castle, that hee may doe them no harme. Else vvould shee make an vnfortunate voyage. Mass.l.6: The religious men, as is said, are shauen, the people weare long hayre, in combing whereof they are woma∣nishly curious, these hoping by their lockes to bee carried into heauen, the other, professing a state of greater perfection, refuse any such helpe. There bee of their re∣ligious more, austere, Iacob Anton.1603. which liue (in Deserts and solitarie places) the liues of Here∣mites. They haue hilles consecrated to Idols, whither they resort in heapes on pil∣grimage: hoping hereby to merit pardon of their sins, and that after their death they shall bee borne againe more Noble and wealthy. Some of these will not kill any liuing creatures, especially such as are tame, in regard of this their Pythagorean opi∣nion of the . transanimation or passage of soules into beastes. The Iesuites con∣uerted one man neere vnto Nanquin, which had thirtie yeares togither obserued a fast; not strange among the Chinois, neuer eating flesh or fish, and on other things feeding temperately. Vsurers are punished in China, with the losse of that money so emploied. Of their Priests is before shewed, that they haue both secular and regular: Scalant. ap Ortel. the one weareth long haire and blacke clothes, and hath priuate habitation: the other liue in couents, and are shauen. Neither may marry, though both doe (and not here alone) far worse. They much commend in their bookes Nic. Longobar the consideration & examina∣tion of a mans selfe, & therefore do esteeme highly of them which sequester themselues, from humane society to diuine contemplation, that (as they say) they may restore them∣selues to thēselues & to that pristine state, wherein the Heauen created them; And ther∣fore haue not onely Colledges of learned men, who leauing the affaires of state and se∣cular distractions, doe in priuate villages liue together, obseruing these contemplati∣ons with mutual conferences: but euen women also haue their Nunneries, & liue a Mo∣nasticall life vnder their Abbesses after their manner: although euen such as are married liue closely enough; their feete to this ende so straitly swaddled in their infancy, that they grow but little, (and to haue little feete i with them great commendation) whereby they can not but lamely walke abroad. And if any Widdow refuse a second marriage, shee obtaineth hereby much praise, and many priuiledges. Their Bonzij are so little accounted of, that the Iesuites wearing their habite were little set by, and therefore taking the Mandarine-habit, of that apparell in learned men were exceeding∣ly honoured of all sorts. Many are the ceremonies which they there obserue in Funeralls. As they honour their parents in their life time, (being otherwise liable to greeuous punishments, yea some of their Mandarins will sue for the Kings licence to leaue their publike function to giue priuate and more diligent attendance to their parents) So after their death they mourne
three yeares in white hattes and garments. The first moneths they girde vnto them a rough vesture with a rope, like the bare-foote Friers. This is not onely obserued of the meaner sort; but the mightiest Mandarins, after newes of their fathers death, leaue their function, and in their priuate houses bewaile their losse. The weal∣their sort keepe them aboue ground two or three yeares in a Parlour fitted for that purpose, whither they daily refort vnto them, to salute them, and to burne In∣cense, and set meats before them. Sometimes also the Bonzij, or Priests, resort thi∣ther with their Dirges and holy things. Their wiues, children, and neighbours come likewise to bewaile them. The Mandarins will not vse those things which before they did: not the same Apparrell, House-hold-furniture, Salutations. They colour part of the paper in which they write, with another colour. They obserue not their wonted proper names, but call themselues otherwise, as disobedient, or such like. Musicke is banished: their diet is hard. When the corpse is to be buried, all the kinred come toge∣ther, and assemble as many Priests as they can, which on musicall instruments, and with their voyces tune, their mournefull Ditties. The place whither the corpse is carried, is adorned with diuers Images. The coffin is very large, the prouiding of which they commit not to their heire, but themselues in their liues take order for the same, bestowing great care & cost for the best wood & workmanship which they are able to procure, wherein spending sometime seuenty, eightie, or a hundred ducats. They hold it vnfortunate to die before they haue prouided the same. They are no lesse curious for the place of their buriall, thinking that hereon dependeth the fortune of their posteri∣tie, and therefore sometime spend a whole yeare in consultation, whether it shalbe to∣ward the North, or some other region. Their Sepulchres are in the fields, where they fortifie them, and oft times resort thither to performe their obsequies. To be buried within the walls were a thing most miserable, neuer to be forgotten. And for some time after they will eate no flesh, in regard of that passage of soules before spoken of. This opinion is of more authoritie and credite with them then that of Hel or Heauen, although (as is said) their Bookes and Pictures depaint terrible things in that kinde. Others Mass and Discourse of China. adde, that as soone as one is dead, they wash him, and clothing him in his best apparrell, all perfumed, set him in his best chaire, and there all his neerest kindred kneeling before him, take their leaue with teares. They coffin him (as before) and place him in a roome richly furnished, and couer him with a sheet, in which they paint his portraiture. A Table standeth by full of viands, with candles on it. Thus do they keepe him fifteene dayes, euery night the Priests executing their superstitious exe∣quies, burning and shaking certaine papers before them. By the Sepulchre they plant a Pine tree, which is sacred, and may not be cut downe, nor conuerted to any vse, if the weather ouerthrow it. Their funerall pompe is in manner of Procession, with can∣dles carried in their hands. They burne vpon the graue many papers, painted with men, cattell, and prouision for his vse in the next world. The times religious are the new Moones, and full Moones (as yee haue heard) in which they make great banquets, and then also they muster their souldiers, who a∣lone may weare weapons in China. They solemnize Prera. also their birth-dayes, where∣unto their kindred do resort of custome with presents, and receiue good cheare. The Kings birth-day is a great festiuall. But Discourse of China. New-yeares day, which is the first day of the new Moone in February is their principall feast, and then they send New-yeares-gifts to each other. Their order for the poore may be a patterne vnto Christians: they suffer none to begge, nor to be idle. If any be blinde, yet he is set to some worke, as grinding in a querne, or such like; of which sort (after G.B.B. Boterus account) there are foure thousand blinde persons that grinde stil in Canton alone. If they be impotent, that they cannot worke, their friends (if they be able) must prouide for them; if not, they are kept in Hospitalls, out of which they neuer passe, and haue all necessaries prouided them by Officers appointed in euery Citie to this businesse. Common women are confined to certaine places and may not goe abroad, nor dwell in the City, for infecting others, and are accountable to a certaine Officer of their euill earnings, which when they
are old, is bestowed on their maintenance. Their dwelling is in the Suburbs of cities. The Lawe of Nations is little respected in China. Embassadours are in manner im∣prisoned for the time of their abode, their affaires being intreated of by the Manda∣rins; who thinke no Nation worthy to deale with their King, in any equall termes of Embassage. Osor.li.11. Petreius the Portugall Ambassadour was imprisoned at Canton, and there died. Prowder people are not vnder heauen then they. Long nailes is an ho∣norable signe, as of hands not employed to base and manuall labours. They thinke no Bookes so learned as their owne, which their ancient men take paines to conne by heart, as boyes in Schooles, and their Professors do reade with subtle and curious ex∣ceptions, distinctions, and obseruations on the Text. They thought the Popedome must needes befall the Iesuites at their returne into Europe, for the learning which they had gotten in reading these Chinian Authors. In their Temples they haue a great Altar, after the Dutch fashion, that one may go round about it. There set they vp the Image of a certaine Gal.Perera. Co Louton. At the right hand standeth the Deuill (their Veiouis) more vgly then amongst vs he is painted For he hath three Crownes on his head, & long , clawes on his hands & fete, a dreadfull countenance & face vpon his blly and is set in a darke corner. Arth.pag.492. : whom they worshippe with great reuerence that come thither to aske counsell, or draw lots. Besides these Temples, which they call Mani they haue another sort, wherein both vpon the Altars and walles stand many idoles well proportioned, but bare-headed. These beare the name of Omith son; accompted of them spirits, but such as in heauen do neither good nor euill, thought to be such men and women as haue chastely liued in this world, in abstinence from fish and flesh, fed onely with rice and sallads. Of that Deuill they make some account: of these spirites little or nothing at all. They hold opinion, that if a man doe well in this life, the Heauens will giue him many tem∣porall blessings: but if he do euill then shal he haue infirmities, diseases, troubles, and penury, and all this without any knowledge of GOD. They imagine also, that they which liue heere well, presently after death shall become Deuills, if otherwise, that then this Deuill doth transanimate his soule (as is said) into a dogge or other beast. And therefore do they sacrifice vnto him, praying that hee will make them like vnto himselfe. Linschot.c.23 When a man lieth on his death-bed, they set before him the picture of the Deuill, with the Sunne in his right hand, and a poniard in his left, and desire the pati∣ent to looke well on him, that hee may be his friend in the future world. They liked the Christian manner of praying, and desired vs (saith Perera) to write them some∣what concerning Heauen, which wee did to their contentation. They are great Sodo∣mites, although they haue many wiues and concubines, which they buy of their pa∣rents, or in the markets, in like manner as the Turkes. They are not by Lawe pre∣scribed to obserue this or that Sect: and therefore they haue many sects, some wor∣shipping the Sunne, some the Moone, some nothing: and all, what themselues best like, as is in part before shewed. Antony Dalmeida A. Dalmeida. 1580. saith, That in saying Masse, they were so thronged with the people, that they were almost troden vnder foot. And of a Chinian Priest (contrarie to the zeale elsewhere in any Religion) they were inuited to dinner, and feasted to∣gether with many other of their Priests that vsed them kindly. Amongst them he ob∣serued, that the Deuill had taught them in many things to imitate the sacred ceremo∣nies (it is the Iesuites phrase) of the Catholike Church. At Ciquion also (a City like to Venice) they prouided themselues of a house, on both sides whereof dwelt these Bon∣zi, or Chinian Priests, who vsed them gently, and daily resorted to them to heare their doctrine; and some of them desired Baptisme: so little is this Religion prised of her forwardest Schollers. This I note by the way, lest these reports should seeme to contradict themselues, relating the deuotion, and manifold superstitions, and yet su∣pine negligence, atheisine, and polytheisme, professed and practized in these large confines according to each mans choice. And as Pantog. that Religion, which of the one sort is practised, is against the light of reason, that a man (as Tertullian saith) should be mercifull or cruell (as these Chinois are) vnto their Gods: So the other (and especi∣ally they which are most learned) neither hope nor feare any thing after death, and ascribe this vnto their happinesse, that they are not touched with such (as they suppose
them) superstitios fancies. Yet euen they which ascribe no Diuinity to their Idoles, obserue their Country-customes of sacrifices and offering vnto them. Their Temples are not so sumptuous as some report, but meane, and meanly kept. They consult, not onely with their gods, (as you haue heard) but with their Wisards and Fortune-tel∣lers; whereof they haue great store. They are exceedingly addicted to two vaine stu∣dies of Alchimy, wherein if they haue not so good successe as he is the West, which (as La Nou Dis∣course. La Nou saith) turneth so little Lead in his Bulles into so much Golde, yet they vse as religious and costly diligence: (for besides much siluer lost, to find siluer, many of them seeke to better their fortune in this attempt, with many yeares fastings:) The o∣ther is to prolong their life, for which they deuise a thousand Artes and Compositi∣ons. Of both these studies they haue diuers Bookes and Professors. There be which fable themselues to be very old, vnto whom is great recourse of Disciples, as to some heauenly Prophets, to learne lessons of long liuing. They supposed the Iesuites, (whom they tooke to be of great learning) did not truely tell them their age, but suspected, that they had already liued some ages, and knew the meanes of liuing e∣uer, and for that cause abstained from marriage. The Discourse of China p.207. Chinian salutations are so full of ceremonies, beyond any people, that I dare not salute them, for feare of tediousnesse. Religion it is yet vnto me to passe vn∣saluted that Religion which I reade obserued by them in intertainement of the Spani∣ards of the Philippina's. They were feasted by the Viceroy; and two Captaines ap∣poynted Stewards, or Feast-maisters, before they sate downe, did take each of them a cup full of liquor in his hand, and went together, whereas they might discouer the Heauen, and offered the same to the Sunne, adding many prayers, that the comming of their guests might be for good, and then did fill out the wine, making a great cour∣tesie. And then proceeded they to their feast. The Chinois Linschoten Cap.23. in the eclipse of the Sunne and Moone, are afraid that the Prince of heauen will destroy them, and pacifie him with many sacrifices and prayers; they holde the Sunne and Moone, man and wife. Ludouicus Georgius in his Mappe of China, Maginus et Ortelius. describeth a huge Lake in the Pro∣uince of Sancij, made by inundation, in the yeare of our Lord 1557. wherein were swallowed seuen Cities, besides Townes and Villages, and innumerable multitude of people: one onely childe in a hollow tree escaping so great a destruction. Such as escaped drowning, were, as Boterus addeth, destroyed with fire from Heauen. From this worke of Diuine Iustice I might passe to those admirable works of humane indu∣strie amongst them: Of Pantogia. which sort are (besides that wall continued by the ioynt a∣greement of Art and Nature some hundreths of leagues; and their printing) their ar∣tillery farre short of that excellencie of ours, or rather more excellent, as more fauou∣rable; their souldiers peeces not hauing barrells aboue a spanne long, and their great artillerie of little vse: their porcellane and fine earthen dishes; their sailing waggons, and other things, may not be further described for feare of prolixitie: all which are so much the more to be admired, because they are their owne inuentions, and not bor∣rowed. The opinion of Scaliger Scal.Exer.92. touching the steeping of that their porcelline, and burying it in the earth, is gaine said by later Writers, Linschot c.23. who affirme, that the earth, whereof these dishes are made, is naturally hard, beaten finall, steeped, and often stirred, and of the finest, swimming in the toppe, is the finest vessell framed. This Countrey hath few in it of other Religions. The Tartars conquered it, and possessed the same about two hundred yeares, and were expelled at last by a Bonzi, whose posteritie still enioy the Scepter. There are still about Paquin and many other places of the kingdome, some Tartars which haue their Moschees, and obserue Ma∣humet. They differ in countenance from the Chinois. Perera saith he saw at Fuquien certaine Moores, who could say little of their Religion, but, Mahomet was a Moore, my father was a Moore, and I am a Moore, with some other words of their Alcoran, where withall, in abstinence from swines flesh they liue, (saith hee) vntill the Deuill take them all. He reasoned with them, because hee had in many Chinish cities seene the reliques of Mahomet kept; and they answered, That they came in great shippes,
fraught with Merchandise from Paquin-ward, to a Port appoynted to them by the King, where they conuerted to their Religion the chiefe Mandarin or Loytia; where∣upon the people beganne to turne Mahumetane. They now waxing bolder, prohibi∣ted the eating of swines flesh, the peoples chiefe foode: who hereby prouoked, com∣plained of a conspiracie betwixt these Moores and the Loytia, against their King. Heereupon he and the chiefe of them were executed, and the rest dispersed into cer∣taine Cities, where they remained slaues to the King. Mathaeus Riccius learned of certaine Mogore-strangers, that in the Xensian Pro∣uince the north part of China, in a place called Xucheo, there are white men with long beards, which vse Bells, and worship Isa, that is, IESVS and Marie, and ho∣nour the Crucifix. Their Priests were married, and cured diseases without medi∣cines. The former part of this report agreeth iust with that of Carvalius, before men∣tioned in the eight Chapter, touching Cathay, which Geographers place next heere∣unto. The Iesuites haue three or foure places of residence; But the Labourers are few, and their haruest nothing so plentifull as in other places, which they impute to the hard∣nes of learning the Chinian language, and especially their writing in so many Chara∣cters not distributed into any Alphabeticall order: to be exact in which, is required a good part of a mans age: their inhospitall Lawes to prohibite strangers entrance into their Country, and suspition of them when they are entred; their Epicurean opini∣ons and liues; their addicting themselues to auncient customes; the conceit of their owne learning; their pride, cruelty, extortion, polygamie, and such like. Themselues can in their Epistles and Tractats Pier.du Iar∣ric.lib.4. acquaint you with their Roman conquests in these parts, and here and elsewhere Iarric one of their society is an Arch-Trumpeter, to sound their exploits: I can not say, alwayes without arring. Boterus ascribeth vnto China seuenty millions of people, whereas he alloweth to I∣talie scarse nine, and to Spaine lesse, to England three, to all Germany, with the Switzers, and Lowe Countries, but fifteene, and as many to all France. Lamentable it is, that the deuill should haue so great a tribute in this one kingdome. Gonsales (in his Discourse of China, translated by Parker) reckoneth almost seuen millions of soul∣diers in continuall pay. In the later Literae à Mat.Ric. Epistles from China, dated 1606. and 1607. little is there to further this History. As for their tales of Miracles in those and the Iaponian Epistles (bearing the same date) wherein Ignatius Loyola's picture is made a miracle-worker; I hold thē not worth relation. At Nanquin was a conspiracie of 3 thousand people, to make a new King, but they were executed and quartered for their treason. The Chinois beleeue (as is there reported) that there is a certaine spirite which hath power of the life and death of children that are sicke of the measells, and therefore when their chil∣dren are sicke thereof, they hang a Glasse before the doore of the Chamber where he lieth, that the spirit comming to destroy the childe, seeing his Image in that Glasse, should not dare to approach nearer. Their baptisme cured the disease: a new remedy for measells; a new vertue of baptisme. I thought it not impertinent heere to adde the Catalogue of the Kings of this Countrey, according Historie of China. to their owne Stories, which although it be in part fabulous, (as what auncient prophane Storie is not?) yet, because I haue done thus in other Nations, and haue so worthy a patterne in this, as the Worthie of our Age Ioseph Scalig.Canon.Isagogic.lib.2. Iosephus Scaliger, pardon me to trouble thee with this Chronicle of their Kings. The first was Vitey, a Giant-like man, a great Astrologer and Inuenter of Scien∣ces; hee reigned a hundred yeares. They name after him a hundred and sixeteene Kings (whose names our Author omitteth) all which reigned two thousand two hun∣dred fifty and seuen yeares: all these were of his linage: and so was Tzintzon the ma∣ker of that huge wall of China which killed many of the Chinois, of whom hee tooke euery third man to this worke. For which cause they slew him when hee had reigned fortie yeares, with his sonne Agnizi. They ordained King in his stead Auchosau, who
reigned twelue yeares; his sonne Futey succeeded and reigned seuen yeares; his wife eighteene; his sonne, three and twenty: then followed Guntey, foure and fifty; Gun∣tey the second, thirteene: Ochantey, fiue and twenty: Coantey, thirteene: Tzentzey, six and twenty and foure moneths: Anthey, six: Pintatey, fiue: Tzintzumey, three and seuen moneths: Huy Hannon six: Coum, two and thirtie: Bemthey, eighteene: Vn∣they, thirteene: Othey, seuenteene: Yanthey, eight months: Antey, nineteene yeares: Tantey, three months: Chitey, one yeare: Linthey, two and twenty yeres: Yanthey, one and thirty yeares: Laupy, one and forty yeares: Cuythey, fiue and twenty yeares: Fon∣tey, seuenteene yeares. Fifteene other Kings reigned, in all, one hundred seuentie and six yeares. The last of which was Quiotey, whom Tzobu deposed, who with seuen of his linage reigned three score and two yeres: Cotey, foure and twenty yeares: Dian, six and fifty yeares: Tym, one and thirtie yeares: Tzuyn, seuen and thirty yeares: Touco with his linage (which were one and twenty) reigned two hundred ninetie and foure yeares: Bausa a Nunne, wife of the last of them (whom she slew) one and forty yeares: Tautzon slew her, and reigned with his posteritie (which were seuen Kings) one hundred and thirtie yeares: Dian, eighteen yeres: Outon, fifteene yeares: Outzim, nine yeares and three months: Tozon foure yeares: Auchin, ten yeares: Zaytzon, and seuenteene of his race, three hundred and twenty yeares: Tepyna the last was dispossessed by Vzon the Tartar, vnder whom, and eight of his Tartarian successours, China endured subiection ninetie and three yeares; Gomb expelled Tzintzoum the last of them. He with thir∣teene successors haue reigned about two hundred and fortie yeares.
OF THE EAST-INDIES: AND OF THE SEAS AND ILANDS ABOVT ASIA, WITH THEIR RELIGIONS. THE FIFTH BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of India in Generall, and of the ancient Rites there obserued. THe name of India, is now applied to all farre-distant countries, not in the extreme limits of Asia alone, but euen to whole America, through the errour of Columbus and his fellowes; who at their first arriuall in the Westerne world, thought that they had met with Ophir, and the Indian Regions of the East. But the Ancients also comprehended vnder this name a huge Tract of Land, no lesse in the iudgement of Alexanders followers, in his Easterne Inuasions, then the third part of the Earth; Ctefias accounted it one halfe of Asia. Ptolomey Ptol.lib.7. and other Geogra∣phers, did vsually diuide India by the Riuer Ganges, into two parts, one on this side Ganges, and the other beyond. Although heere we finde no lesse difficultie concerning Ganges, which the most account the same with Guenga, that falleth into the Gulfe of Bengala, which they also imagine to be that, which of the Ancients is called Sins Gangeticus: Other Mercat.tab.muers.Magin. Gag. G. Arthus bi. Ind. Or. esteeme the Riuer Cantan (whereon Cantan chiefe Citie of one of the Chinian Prouinces, whereof we haue so lately taken our leaue) to be that Ganges: Of which minde are Mercator, Maginus, Gotardus Arthus, and their disciples. M. Paulus M. Paulus lib.3. diuideth India into three parts, the Lesse, the Greater, which he calleth Malabar; and Abasiae, betwixt them both. Dom. Niger Nig.Com. As.x. reckoneth the same number; the first, from the Riuer Indus (whence this name India flowed) vnto Barius, hee calleth Caisarat: the second or middle, from thence to Caberis, Miniber: from thence Eastward to Ganges, he nameth Maabar, and all these on this side Ganges: beyond it placing Magin, or Mangi. Ptolomey maketh the Sinae, to be next beyond India extra Gangem, on which he abutteth them on the West: and therfore if Sinae be China, then are they by him placed quite beyond India:
and therefore Mercater and Maginus esteeme Cathay to bee the Region of the Sinae. It is our part to leaute this matter to the discussing and deciding of others, and to hold on our perambulation through this wide and spacious Region: first relating the generalities and antiquities thereof: and next proceeding from China (where we left) vnto the next adioyning Nations, certainly reputed Indian, how vncertaine soeuer Ganges runneth, whether on this side, or beyond them: to which when we haue ad∣ded our suruey of the Ilands adioning to the Continent of Asia, wee may end this Booke, and our promised Asian Discouery. Vnder the name of India, heere we com∣prehend all that Tract betweene Indus and the Persian Empire on the West, vnto Chi∣na Eastward, as it trendeth betwixt the Tartarian and the Indian Seas. Semiramis first inuaded India, as Ninus her husband had done before to Bactria, but not with like successe. For although she had thought to haue encountred the In∣dian Elephants with her counterfeits made of Oxe-hides, sowed together in that shape, and stuffed with Hay: for which vse she caused three hundred thousand beasts to be slaine, which might both serue in the battell for shew, and before-hand to exer∣cise her horse to such sights; and, if we beleeue Diodor.Sic.lib.2.cap 5. Ex Ctesia. Antiquitie, mustered in her huge army no lesse then three millions of foot-men, and fiue hundred thousand of horse: Yet Stanrobates, at that time the Indian Monarch, brake her Forces, and chased her out of the field. In these first times the Indians Caelius Rhodig.lib.18.cap.31. are said to liue like the Scythians, without houses, Cities, Temples, in a wandering course with their Tents, liuing on the barke of the tree Tala, and wilde Venison, the skinnes whereof were their garments. In all India were no seruants, but all free-men. These things were altered by Bacchus or Dio∣nysius, who made an Expedition hither, not so much with Armes, as with Arts. Hee taught them the vse of wine, oyle, and sacrificing: in memory whereof, Posteritie ho∣nored him for a god. Of this the Poets, and histories of Alexander, and others make much mention. So doth Suidas tell of one Brachman, that prescribed the Rites and Lawes of the Brachmanes: Solinus, of Hydaspes; and others, of Ganges, Hercules, and the rest, with much vncertaintie. The first certaine notice of those parts was by Alex∣anders inuasion and conquest, who yet pierced but a small way in this vast part of the world, except that little we haue of the Persians exploits in these parts. The Strab.lib.15. S.Aurel, Victor. Romans were hindered by the Persians and Parthians, from passing hither with their armies, al∣though their Ambassages be reported, both to Augustus, and long after to Antonius Pius. Strabo in his fifteenth booke is large in this Indian subiect. He reporteth out of Aristohulus, that the Riuer Indus, by force of an Earthquake, changed his chanell; thereby a great part of the neighbour Region being turned into a desert. For in this, Indus is like vnto Nilus, in that, without it, the Countrey would be a wildernesse, and therefore is also worshipped of the Inhabitants. It receiueth fifteene other Riuers into it. He mentioneth the Cathei not farre from thence, which after happily gaue name vnto Cathay. To let passe the strange Creatures, which some ascribe to these parts, as Dragons of incredible bignesse, those great Apes, which by imitation of men in aray, made Alexanders Campe to arme themselues against so ridiculous au e∣nemie. The Indians are seuen sorts: Plin.l.6.c.19. Ar.lib.8. The first in estimation, and fewest in number, were their Philosophers. These kept publike Acts once a yere before the King, and he which in his obseruations was found three times false, was condemned to perpetuall silence. The second sort were husband-men, which paid the King (the onely owner of all the land) a fourth part of the encrease. The third was of shepheards and huntsmen, which wandered in Tents. The fourth Artificers. The fifth souldiers. The sixth Magistrates. The seuenth Courtiers, and those of his Priuy Counsell. If any woman killeth the King in his drunkennesse, she is rewarded with the marriage of his sonne and heire. If any depriue another of a member, besides like for like, he loseth his hand; and, if
it be an Artificer, his life. They strangle their , that it may bee so offered whole to their Idols. Of their Philosophers, or men learned and religious, the Brachmanes. Brachmanes obtaine the first place, as being neerest in sect to the Greekes. These are after their man∣ner Nazarites from the wombe. So soone as their mother is conceiued of them, there are learned men appointed which come to the mother, with songs, containing pre∣cepts of chastitie. As they grow in yeares they change their Masters. They haue their places of exercise in a groue nigh to the Citie, where they are busied in graue confe∣rences. They eat no liuing creatures, nor haue vse of women; liue frugally, and lie vpon skinnes. They will instruct such as will heare them, but their hearers must neither sneese, nor spit, nor speake. When they haue in this strict oor so spent seuen and thir∣tie yeares, they may liue more at pleasure and libertie, in diet, habit, proper habitati∣on, and the vse of gold, and marriage. They conceale their mysteries from their wiues, left they should blabbe them abroad. They esteeme this life as mans conception, but his death-day to be his birth-day vnto that true and happy life, to him which hath beene rightly religious. They hold the world to be created, corruptible, round, ruled by the high GOD. Water they imagine to haue beene the beginning of making the world; and that besides the foure Elements, there is a fifth Nature, where of the Hea∣uen and Starres consist. They inreate of the immortalitie of the Soule, and of the tor∣ments in Hell, and many such like matters. The The Indian Germanes. Germanes another Order of religious on learned men, are honored amongst them: especially such of them as liue in the woods, and of the woods, both for their diet of those wilde fruits, and their habit of the barkes of trees, not acquainted with Bacchus or Venus any more then with Cees. They speake not to the Kings, when they aske counsell of them, but by messengers; and doe pacifie the angrie gods, as is sup∣posed, by their holinesse. Next in honor to these, are certaine Mondints, which liue of Rice and Barley, which any man at the first asking giueth them, together with entertainment into their houses. These professe skill in Physicke, and to remedie diseases, wounds, and sterilizie; very constant in labour and hardship. Others there are, Inchauters and Di∣uiners, Masters of ceremonies about the dead; which wander thorow townes and Cities. Some there are more ciuill and secular, in their life professing like pietie and holinesle. Women also are admitted vnto the fellowship of their studies in this Phi∣losophie, not to their beds. Aristobulus writeth, that he saw two of these Brachmanes, the one an old man shauen, the other yong with long haire, which sometimes resor∣ted to the Market-place, and were honored as Counsellours, and freely tooke what they pleased, of any thing there to be sold, for their sustenance. They were annointed with Sesamine oyle, wherewith, and with hony, they tempered their bread. They were admitted to Alexanders table, where they gaue lessons of patience Practise of prescribed pa∣tience. : and after going to a place not farre off, the old man lying downe with his face vpward, sustained the Sunne and showers terrible violence. The yonger standing on one foot, held in both his hands a peece of wood of three cubits lifted vp, and shifted feete, as the other was wearie: and so they continued euery day. The yong man returned home afterward, but the old man followed the King, with whom hee changed his habit and life, for which, when as he was by some reproued, he answered that he had fulfilled the fortie yeares exercise, which he had vowed. Onesieritus saith, that Alexander, hearing of some religious Obseruants, which went naked, and exercised themselues to much hardship, and would The like stubbornnesse is yet in their Iogbies. not come to others, but would bid men, if they would haue a∣ny thing with them, to come to them; sent him vnto them, who found fifteene of them twentie furlongs from the Citie, each of them obseruing his owne gesture of sitting, standing, or lying naked, and not stirring till Sun-setting, in that vnsupportable heate, at which time they returned into the Citie. Caanu was one of them. Hee afterward followed Alexander into Persia, where beginning to be sicke, he caused a great pile or frame of wood to be made, wherein he placed himselfe in a golden chaire, and caused
fire to be put to, in which he was voluntarily consumed, telling (if they tell true) that he would meete Alexander at Babylon, the place fatall to Alexanders death. This Ca∣ianus told Onesicritus of a golden world, where meale was as plentifull as dust, and fountaines streamed milke, hony, wine and oyle. Which Countrey, by men turned into wantonnesse, Iupiter altered and detained, imposing a life of hardnes and labour, which while men followed, they enioyed abundance; but now thar men begin to sur∣fet and grow disobedient, there is danger of vniuersall destruction. When he had thus spoken, he bade him, if he would heare further, strippe himselfe, and lye naked vpon these stones. But Mandanis, Arr. calleth him Dandanis.lib.7. another of them, reproued Calanus for his harshnesse, and, commending Alexander for his loue to learning, said that they inured their bo∣dies to labour for the confirmation of their mindes against passions. For his nakednes he alledged, that that was the best house which needed least furniture of houshold. He added that they searched the secrets of Nature, and that returning into the Citie, if they met with any carrying figges or grapes, they receiued of him gratis; if oyle, they pow∣red it on them: and all mens houses and goods were open to them, euen to the parlors of their wiues. When they were entered, they imparted the wisdome of their senten∣ces, as the other communicated his meats. If they feared any disease, they preuented the same with fire, as was now said of Calanus. Megasthenes reproueth this Calanus, as Alexanders trencher-Chaplaine, and commendeth Mandanis, saying, that when Alexanders messengers told him that he must come to the Sonne of Iupiter, with pro∣mise of rewards, if he came, otherwise menacing torture: he answered, that neither was he Iupiters sonne, nor did possesse any great part of the earth: as for himselfe, hee neither respected his gifts, nor feared his threatnings; for while he liued, India yeel∣ded him sufficient; if he died, he should be freed from age, and exchange for a better and purer life. Whereupon he saith, Alexander both pardoned and praised him. Cli∣tarchus reporteth also, that to the 'Brachmanes are opposed another Sect called Pram∣ne, men full of subtiltie and contention, which derided the studies of others in Physiologie and Astronomie. He diuideth the Brachmanes into those of the mountaines, clo∣thed in Deeres skinnes, which carried scrippes, full of rootes, and medicines, which they applied with certaine charmes to cure diseases: and the second sort hee calleth Gymnetae, those naked ones before mentioned (whereof it seemeth they were called Gymnosophistae) which had women amongst them, but not in carnall knowledge: the third he calleth Ciuill, which liued in Cities and Villages, wearing fine linnen, and apparelled in skinnes. Nicolans Damascenus saith, Nic. Damasc. Suetonius men∣tioneth this, in vita Augusti.cap.21. that at Antiochia he saw the Indi∣an Embassadours, sent to Augustus from Porus, the King (as his letter contained) of six hundred Kings, with presents, among which was a female Viper of sixteene cu∣bites (one of like bignesse Strabo saith he saw sent out of Egypt) and a Cray-fish of three cubits, and a Partrich bigger then a Vulture. Zarmonochagas, one of these Indi∣an Philosophers, was one of the Embassadours, who at Athens burned himselfe, not moued thereto by aduersitie, but by prosperitie, which had in all things followed his desires, left in his succeeding age it might alter: and therefore entred the fire, annoin∣ted, naked, laughing. His Epitaph was: Heere lieth Zarmanochagas the Indian, of Bargosa, which according to his Countrey-custome, made himselfe immortall. Suidas telleth of a Nation called Brachmanes, inhabiting an Iland in the sea, where Alexander erected a pillar, with inscription, that he had passed so farre. They liue an hundred and fiftie yeares, and haue neither bread, wine, flesh, nor mettals, nor houses, but liue of the fruits, and cleare water, and are very religious. Their wiues liue apart on the other side Ganges, to whom they passe in Iuly and August, and after fortie daies re∣turne home againe. When the wife hath had two children, shee neither knoweth her husband after, nor any other man; which is obserued also, when in fiue yeares hee can raise no issue of her, he after abstaineth. These Io. Boem. slay no beasts in sacrifice, but affirme that GOD better accepteth vnbloudie sacrifices of Prayer, and more delighteth in man, his owne Image. Hyctaspes, Am. Marcel.lib.23. the father of Darius, is reported to haue learned of the Indian Philoso∣phers
or Brachmanes both Aftronomie and Rites of Religion, with which he after in∣structed the Persian Mag. None Arrian.lib.1. might sacrifice without one of these to direct him, who only among the Indians had skill of Diuination, and authoritie to sacrifice, and were free from other seruices. The Indians are said to worship Iupiter, Ganges, and other Heroes of their Coun∣trey. Some of the Indian Nations accounted it dishonorable (as they doe also at this day) for the wiues not to be burned with their deceased husbands. Thomas Dorotheus in vita Barthol. & Thm. the Apo∣stle preached the Gospell to the Indians, and so did Bartholomew also, and destroyed their Idols (which wrought great wonders amongst them) Astaroth, Beirith, and Wal∣dath, as Ab∣dias Pseudo Abdias. Bab.Epise. reporteth, who euen in this Historie may easily be conuinced to bee counterfeit, in ascribing the names and religions of the Grecians, Iuno, Neptune, Bere∣cinthia, to the Indians; besides those vnchristian reuenges, in killing so many of their aduersaries, and olde Heathenish, new Popish Ceremonies, fathered on those A∣postles. To let passe that Abdias, a fit Bishop of that mystieall Babylon: Gen.di.lib.6.cap.26. Alexander ab A∣lexandro reckoneth among their gods the greatest trees (to cut which, was with them a capitall crime) and a Dragon, in honor of Liber Pater. Hercules they honoured in a Giant-like statue, whose daughter Pandaea, the Pandeans say, was their first Queene. These affirme, that in the hill Meros, which they account sacred to Iupiter, is a caue wherein Liber or Bacchus was nourished; from whence the fable grew, that hee was borne of Iupiters thigh; for so  signifieth. Some of the Indians (saith Solin.cap.55. Solinus) kill no beasts, nor eat flesh; some liue only on fish. Some kill their parents and kins∣folkes, before age or sicknesse withereth them, and deuoure their flesh, an argument not of villany, but pietie amongst them. Their Plin.l.7.c.2. Gymnosophists, from the Sunne-ri∣sing to the setting, fixe their eyes on the bright orbe of the Sunne, thence obseruing certaine secrets. Hereunto he addeth the tales of men with dogges heads; of others with one legge, and yet very swift of foot: of Pigmeis, of such as liue only by sent: of hoary infants; of some like Polyphemus, with one eye in their fore-head; of others with eares to the ground, wherein many of the old writers are Poets, and the moderne, Painters, as in many other monsters of men and beasts. We seeke credit with the wise, and not admiration of fooles. The Al.ab.Al.lib.4.cop.17. Indians neuer sacrificed, or saluted their Idols without dances. They were neuer rewarded with military honor or spoile, except they brought into the Campe an enemies head in their hand. They punished periury with the losse of fingers and toes; and such as deceiued their Clients, with perpetuall silence; and besides, they were disa∣bled vnto any Office. Their Lawes are not written; their contracts without seales, or witnesses. In the hills, Laur. Coruin. called Hemodi, Bacchus is said to haue erected pillars, to witnes his Conquest, as farre as that Easterne Ocean, as Hercules did in the West. He built the Citie Nysa, where he left his sicke and aged souldiers, which Alexander spared, Arrian.lib.5. and suffered to their owne libertie, for Dionisius or Baecchus his sake. And as Bacehus ere∣cted Pillars, so did Alexander Altars to the twelue chiefe gods, as high as towers, mo∣numents of his farre trauels, where he obserued solemne games and sacrifices. He Arrian.lib.6. sa∣crificed also, not to his countrey gods alone, but to Hydaspis, Acesine, and Indus, In∣dian riuers, and to other gods, with other Rites and sacrifices, then he had before vsed: drowning a golden bowle in Indus, and another in the Ocean, in his Ethnicke super∣stition. To him did the Indian Magi (so doth Arrianns Arrian.lib.7. call their Brachmanes) say, that he was but as other men, sauing that he had lesse rest, and was more troublesome, and being dead, should enioy no more land, then would serue to couer his bodie. And euery man (said they) stamping with their feet on the ground, hath so much as he trea∣deth on. Eusebius Euseb.de praep. Euang. lib.6.cap.8. reciteth out of Bardesanes Syrus, that amongst the Indians, and Ba∣ctrians, were many thousand Brachmanes, which as well by tradition, as law, worship∣ped no Image, norate any quicke creature, dranke no wine nor beere, only attending on Diuine things: whereas the other Indians are very vicious, yea some hunt men, sa∣crifice, and deuoure them, and were as Idolaters.
Pliny besidee his relations of monsters in these parts, telleth of their Philosophers (called Gymnosophists like things to that, which is before mētioned of their beholding the Sunne from the rising to the setting, with fixed eyes, standing on the hot sands all day-long, on one foot by course. Tooth-ache, with other diseases of the head & eyes, spitting, and other sicknesses, are either exiles or strangers to the Indians. Tally saith, Tusc.quaest.lib.5. that in this naked plight these Philosophers endure the cold of Winter, and snowes of Caucasus, while they liue, and the burning fire at their end without any plaining. The Indian women also striue which shall be married to her husbands corpse, in a fiery chariot, riding with him into another world.. Philostratus in his large Legend of the life of Apollouius Tyanaeus, their Philosophi∣call Saint, relateth Phil.l.2.c.4. his pilgrimage into India, to the Brachmanes, in which he came to Nysa, where was a Temple of Bacchus built by himselfe, planted about with Bayes, Vines, and Iuie, whose shady roofe couered the same. In the middest was an Image: all instruments belonging to the Vintage were there, some of gold, others of siluer hang∣ed vp, sacred to Dionysius. He after Cap.9. came to Taxilla the Citie royall, where he found the Temple of the Sunne, and in it, the Iuory Image of Aiax, with golden statues of Alexander: and ouer-against the same, brazen Images of Porus. The walls of redde marble shined like fire, interlaid with gold, resembling lightning. The Mosaical floore pouldred with pearles. The King heere offered sacrifice to the Sunne. For the pepper∣trees, Lib.3.cap.1. which (he saith) are great, and abound with Apes, who gather the pepper for the Indians gratis, brought thereunto by a wile of the Indians, who first gather some, and lay it on heapes, and then goe away: at their returne, finding many the like heaps made by the aemulous Apes, I leaue it to the Authors authority, and Readers credulity: as that also which followeth of the Inhabitants of Paraca in these parts, who by eating a Dragons heart and liuer, attaine to vnderstand the language (if so I may terme it) of beasts. And if you maruell at this, Cap.3. that which followes will amaze you; of men which doe not, as the former, communicate with the nature of beasts, but of spirits, making themselues at their pleasure inuisible. Heere in a holy hill was a pit, whereof no man drinketh, by which the Indians binde their faith, as by the most solemne and inuiola∣ble oath. In this pit was a fiery receptacle, where men were purged from their offen∣ces: and two tubs (of Whetstones, I should say) of raines and windes, the one being opened yeelding raines, and the other, windes. In this place were many Indian, Grecian, and Egyptian statues, with their Rites ob∣serued accordingly. This hill was reported the middle of India, and euery noone-tide they sing Hymnes to the Sunne for that fire, borrowed (they say) from his beames. The Brachmanes sleepe on the ground, on hearbes strewed two cubits thicke, that by this eleuation they might more signifie their deuotion to the Sunne, whome they laud night and day. He found Cap.4. Iarchas their principall, with seuen associates, sitting on Thrones of Brasse. Iarchas could tell Apollonius his Name, Nation, and Aduentures, which had befallen him all his life. They annoint themselues, then wash in a fountaine, and after this, being crowned, enter the Temple in solemne Procession, with Daunces, smiting the ground with Roddes, wherewith the earth, like vnto waues, did moue and rayse it selfe. Iarchas being asked by Apollonius, what he thought of himselfe and his companie, answered, That they were Gods, because they were good men: that he him∣selfe had sometime beene Ganges, and Apollonius before had beene an Aegyptian Ma∣riner, an attendant which there waited on them had beene Palamedes, whose misfor∣tunes we read of in the warres of Troy, thus in new bodies presenting themselues to the world. The world, he said, was a liuing creature, compounded of fiue Elements, with diuers other things of Pygmeys, which liued vnder the Earth, of Gryphons, &c. Thus much I thought to adde of Apollonius, because some vaine Philosophers haue impudently compared him to our Sauiour, that the Reader might parallel this Legend with the Gospell out of this darkenesse, the more to admire that more then admirable Light. And thus much out of Philostratus, of the Brachmanes. The Gymnosophists are by him placed, and by that name knowne, in Aegypt and Aethiopia, whither also Apollonius went to visit them.
CHAP. II. Of the Indian Prouinces next adioyning to China. CAuchin-China Magin. is an Indian Kingdome, situate betweene the Riuer Cantan, and the Kingdome of Siam, diuided into three Prouinces, and as many Kings, but one of them is Paramount. It Discourse of China, p.381. aboundeth with Gold, Siluer, Aloes, Porcelane, and Silke. They are Idolaters and Pagans, and Gi.Bot.Ben. haue had some deuotion to the Popish Christianitie, moued thereto by certaine pictures of our Ladie, of the last Iudge∣ment, and Hell (a new kinde of preaching) and haue erected many Crosses amongst them, of which the Friers report (after their fashion) some miracles. Their Religion seemeth little to differ from that of the Chinois. Nigh vnto this Kingdome is Champa, the name of a Kingdome, and chiefe Citie thereof, of great Traffique, especially of Lignum Aloes, which groweth there in the Mountaines, prized at the weight in Siluer, which they vse in Bathes, and in the Fune∣rals of great Princes. In Religion they are as the former. Camboia lyeth Southward from thence, a great and populous Countrie, full of Ele∣phants and Abada's (this Beast is the Rhinoceros:) Here also they begin to honour the Crosse, as Frier Siluester (a man, as they say, much reuerenced by the King, and honou∣red of the people) hath taught them. When the King dieth, Summario di pop.orientali. his women are burned, and his Nobles doe voluntarily sacrifice themselues in the same fire. The women are generally burned with their husbands at their death. The Camboyans dealt treche∣rously Nauigatio. Iac.Neccij per Cornel.Nicolai. with the Hollanders, An. 1602. whome they inuited to the shore, with pro∣mise of certaine Buffes, and then cruelly slew them. They detained the Admirall on shore, to be redeemed, with some of their Ordinance. When they intend a iourney, they vse diuination with the feet of a Henne, to know whether it will be luckie, or no; and as the Wizard shall answere, they dispose of themselues, eyther to goe, or stay. On this side of Camboia, is Magin.G.Bot.Ben. Siam, mother-Citie of a Kingdome bearing the same name, in which are reckoned thirtie thousand families of Mores, besides the Naturals. In these parts are huge woods, harbours of Lions, Tigers, Ownces, and Mariches, which haue maidens faces and Scorpions tailes. Heere runneth Menan out of that huge lake Chiamay, which yeeldeth this and other Riuers of like nature to Nilus in E∣gypt. They haue amongst them many religious Discourse of China, p.390. men, which leade an austere life, and therefore had in great reputation of holinesse. These liue in common: they may not marry, nor speake to a woman (which fault is punished with death) they goe alway bare-foot, in poore aray, eating nothing but Rice and greene herbes, which they beg from doore to doore. They craue it not, nor take it with their hands, but goe with a wallet at their backes alwaies, with their eyes modestly fixed on the ground, and cal∣ling or knocking, stand still, till they receiue answere, or some thing be put in their wallets. Many times they set themselues naked in the heate of the Sunne: notwith∣standing that himselfe, with such direct beames, together with his frie (whole armies of Gnats) doe their vtmost malice vpon them. They rise at Mid-night to pray vn∣to their Idols, which they doe in Quires, as the Friers doe. They may not buy, sell, or take any Rents, which, if they should doe, would bring on them the imputation of Heretikes. Some Merchants of Siam being at Canton, and hearing that Frier Martin Ignacio and his companions, were there imprisoned, for  that Chi∣nian Kingdome without licence, they visited them, and seeing their poore Friers weedes, they, besides other almes, offered to pay their ransome, if money would doe it. The Siamites G. Bot.B.l.2.part.3. commonly hold, that GOD created all thinges, rewardeth the good, punisheth the bad: That man hath two Spirits; one good, to keepe; and the
other euill, to tempt, continually attending him. They build many and faire Tem∣ples, and place in them many Images of Saints, which sometime liued vertuously, and now are in Heauen. They haue one Statue fiftie paces long, which is sacred to the Father of men. For they thinke that he was sent from aboue, and that of him were borne certaine persons that suffered Martyrdome for the loue of GOD. Their Priests are clothed in yellow long garments. (This colour is esteemed holy, and eue∣rie yellow thing, for the resemblance which it hath with Gold, and with the Sunne, is hallowed to GOD.) Besides that which is before said of their strict orders, they may not nourish Hennes, because of their female Sexe. To drinke Wine, is punished in their Priests with stoning. They haue many Fasts in the yeare, but one especially, in which the People frequenteth the Temples and their Sermons. They haue their canonicall houres by day and night for their holy things. They hold, that the World shall last eight thousand yeares, whereof sixe thousand are passed, and then it shall be consumed with fire: at which time shall be opened in Heauen seuen eyes of the Sunne, which shall drie vp the Waters, and burne vp the Earth. In the ashes shall re∣maine two Egges, whence shall come forth one man and one woman, which shall re∣new the World. But there shall be no more Salt, but fresh Riuers and Lakes, which shall cause the Earth, without mans labour, to abound in plentie of good thinges. The Siamites are the sinke of the Easterue Supers∣titions, which they deriue to manie Nations. The inhabitants of this Kingdome are much giuen to pleasure and riot: they re∣fuse the vse of manuall Arts, but addict themselues to Husbandrie. They haue Maginus. G.Bot.Ben. pub∣like Schooles, where they teach Lawes and Religion in the vulgar Language: other Sciences they learne in a more learned Tongue. They worship innumerable Idols, but especially the foure Elements; according to which his Sect, each man maketh choise of his buriall. They which worshipped the Earth, are therein buried: the Fire burneth the dead carkasses of them which obserued it: in the Ayre are hanged (to feast that ayrie-winged people with their flesh) those which adored the Ayre, being aliue. The water drowneth those which had aliue beene drowned in that Waterie Re∣ligion. Euery King, at his first entrance to the Crowne, erecteth a Temple, which he adorneth with high Steeples, and innumerable Idols. In the Citie of Socotay is one of mettall, fourescore spannes high. The Kingdome of Siam comprehendeth that Aurea Chersonesus of Ptolomey, de∣scribed by Arrianus in his Periplus, (the Mappe whereof Ortelius set forth 1597) which Tremellius and Iunius iudge to be Salomons Ophir. The Land trendeth long and narrow, and containeth fiue hundred Leagues of Sea-coast, compassing from Chaupa to Tavay. But of this space the Arabians, or Moores, haue vsurped two hun∣dred, with the Townes of Patane, Paam, Ior, and Malacca, now in possession of the Portugals: and the Kingdomes of Aua, Chencran, Caipumo, and Brema, haue shared also therein. Odia Ioan.Bar.l.9.c.2. is the chiefe Citie thereof, containing foure hundred thousand households, and serueth the King with fiftie thousand souldiors: and to the Riuer Ca∣piumo (on which it standeth) belong two hundred thousand Vessels. This King hath nine Kingdomes subiect to him, and thirtie thousand Elephants, whereof three thou∣sand are trained to the warres. His Nobles hold their Lands in a kind of Knights-Ser∣uice, like the Turkish Timars (yet onely for terme of life) and without the Kings pay serue him, whensoeuer he appointeth, with twentie thousand horse, and two hundred and fiftie thousand foot. The Countrey is compassed with the high Hills of Iangoma, Brema, or Brama, and Aua, and is it selfe plaine, in situation and fertilitie (caused by inundation) like to Aegypt. The Lai are tributaries to Siam, for feare of the Gueoni, Caniballa and Man-eaters liuing: in the Mountaines adiacent; against whome the Siamite defendeth them, and inuaded those Gueoni one time with twentie thousand horse, two hundred and fiftie thousand footmen, and tenne thousand Elephants for Carriages and Warre. Caesar Frederike Cas.Frid. reporteth, That in the yeare 1567 the King of Pegu besieged the King of Siam, in his chiefe Citie, with an Armie of 1400000 men, and lay before it 21.moneths, and had 500000 fresh souldiors sent him in supply,
and yet had not preuailed, if Treason had not more furthered his designes then force. The gates were one night set open, and the Peguans entred: which when the Siamite perceiued, he poysoned himselfe, leauing his Children and Kingdome a prey to the Conquerer: whose triumphall returne, Fredericke (then in Pegu) beheld. Since that time the Kings of Siam haue beene tributaries to Pegu. After this Peguan had raigned seuen and thirtie yeares, he left his Kingdomes, but not his fortunes, to his sonne: who taking displeasure against the Siamite, his vassall, sent for him to come to him, which he refused. And thereupon he entred into his Countrey with nine hundred thousand men, and besieged him in his chiefe Citie: which he, seeking politicke delayes, made semblance still to deliuer, vntill in the third moneth after (which was March) the Riuer ouerflowed the Countrey six score miles about, after his yerely custome, and partly drowned, partly committed to the Siamites, attending in boats for this bootie, to be slaughtered, that huge Armie; of which, scarce threescore and tenne thousand returned to Martavan, and those without Elephants and Horses. And when the King of Pegu proceeded in his attempts with like successe, the Siamite, at last, besieged him in Pegu, his Royall Citie, An. 1596. But hearing a rumor of the Portugals comming to helpe him, he raysed his siege. These are the reports of Franciscus Fernandes, a Iesuite. Of the Peguan wee shall speake more in the next Chapter. Malacca is now subiect to the Portugals, who haue there their Bishop, and a Col∣ledge of Iesuites besides the Castle. It sometime was subiect to Siam, from whome it rebelled, after that Marchandise had made them rich. The Ayre is here very vn∣holsome: their Speech, a deuised Language of the first founders (for it is not long since it was but a few Fishers Cottages:) their Religion is Mahumetan, as a great part of the Coast here about is. Maginus calleth it the Centre of the Easterne Trafficke. They are Linscho. R.Fitch. proud of that their Language; wherein they deuise many Sonnets and a∣morous Poesies. The Malayos, or Countrey people, goe naked, with a Cloth about their middle, and a little Roll of Cloth about their heads. Lodonico Barthema (who was there before the Portugals knew it) supposed, that here arriued more shippes then in any Citie in the world. The Riuer Gaza, neere thereunto, is more, after his reckoning, then fifteene myles ouer. The people in the Countrey (which com∣passeth about two hundred and threescore myles) lodge in Trees, for feare of Ty∣gers. After that Alphonsus Ioan.Bar.l.9. Albuquerque had conquered Malacca, the Moores, dis∣possessed there, seated themselues in diuerse places along the Coast, and some of them vsurped the title of Kings. Patane G.Arthus Dantisc. Hist. Ind.Oriene.pag.333. is a Citie betweene Malacca and Siam, chiefe of that Kingdome, where∣to it giueth name, in the height of seuen degrees. The buildings are of Wood and Reed, but artificially wrought. The Mesquit (for many of them are Mahumetanes) is of Bricke. The Chinois are more then the natiue inhabitants. They are of an Ash∣colour. The vse Navig.Iacob.Neccij. three Languages; the Malayan (which to them is naturall) the Sian, and Chinan. The first is written like the Hebrew, from the right hand; the second, like the Latine, from the left, and almost in like Characters; the third, from the right to the left, with a descent from the toppe to the bottome. The Chinois haue idolatrous Temples, and so haue the Sians, wherein are many golden Statues; the Priests which attend them are clothed in yellow. They haue sacred youths which are their Oracles. The people when they enquire of them, sit a conuenient distance from the Images, and obserue the yong mans gestures (who with his haire disheuelled lyeth prostrate before the Idoll) singing and playing on Instruments, vntill he arise, and standeth vp. For then, as possessed of the Deuill, he runneth vp and downe with a terrible countenance, and maketh a stirre, as if he would kill himselfe, and them that stand by, with a sword which he hath in his hand. Then the people prostrating themselues, request him to declare the Deuils Oracle, and he answereth as pleaseth him; his lyes being accounted Oracles. Adulterie is here a capitall offence, the father of the malefactor being the Executioner, or his next kinsman, if hee bee
dead: yet is this vice common (notwithstanding this rigor) by reason of the womens vnbridled lust. The Kingdome was gouerned many yeres by a Queene, who gaue good entertain∣ment to the Hollanders.

After 1603, the Hollanders tooke a rich shippe of the Portugals at Macao, laden for Iapan. Cornel.de Vena. , neuer saw them againe, but heard, that the Portugals had caused fifteene of them to be hanged: the other at Auarella Falca, in 11. degrees ½. where they found the Tract of Carts, and footings of Beasts, but could not see a man, nor shoot a Beast. They guessed, that the people liued as the Tartars, wandring in Carts and Tents, with∣out any setled dwelling. The place was by them called Sotternym, by reason that many of their companie had lost the vse of reason, and became madde, with eating a certaine fruit there growing, like to Plummes, with a tender stone, which continued till they had slept. Had they knowne then the easinesse of the cure, it had beene bet∣ter then any Comedie to haue tickled their Splene, and prouoked laughter A merrie madnesse of Euery one in his mor. , to see one fighting against the enemies, which assaulted him at his Cabbin: to heare ano∣ther with piteous shrikes crie out on the multitude of Deuils and Hobgoblins, which affrighted him: a third sees strange sights, and cryes out, the shippe is full of stran∣gers: and whiles one, in more pleasing distraction, enioyeth (and ioyeth in that di∣stracted pleasure) the sight of GOD and his Angels, another (transported by this hu∣moured Charon) with dreadfull and gastly lookes trembles at his supposed sights of the Deuill, and his hellish associates. It were a madnesse to relate how exceedingly this their madnesse was diuersified, and how many Acts this Tragicall Comedie had, till sleepe had dispersed those fumes wherewith that fruit had distracted their braines. From thence (as is said) they came to Patane, where the Queene entertained them in good sort, and to their contentment. As the difference of their writing, in such neerenesse of dwelling, is very much, so no lesse is found in their Religions. The Batauians are Mahumetanes. The Chinois and Siams are Ethnikes, in that diuersitie of Rites which you haue heard. Whiles the Hollanders were there, one of those youths, in that Propheticall distraction before∣mentioned, warned them to depart from thence; for a great fire would otherwise con∣sume them: whereupon many forsooke their habitation, and yet no fire happened. They also saw the execution of their seuere Law against Adulterie, on two noble Per∣sonages, whose lewd familiaritie being detected, she chose to be strangled, and he to be stabbed (the Law permitting them their choise of the kindes of death) which by the fathers of the parties was executed on them. In single persons it is accounted no crime. And if a foreine Marchant come to trade there, they vse to aske him, if hee neede not a woman: yea, many young women offer their seruice; and the price and time being agreed on, shee, whome he pleaseth to chuse, goeth with him to his house, and in the day performeth the office of a Seruant, in the night of a Con∣cubine: but then neither of them may seeke change of pleasure, without great perill. The Siamites that liue here, weare two or three balls of Gold or Siluer, as bigge as a Tennis-ball, in their yards, as wee shall after obserue in Pegu. The Mahumetans weare them not. The Queene keepes her selfe close at home among her women; of which, some may not marrie (but yet may doe worse) others may, hauing first ob∣tained the Queenes licence. It is seldome that shee is seene; yet sometimes shee is, when shee rideth on an Elephant in Progresse, for her recreation. And for Elephants, they haue a deuise to take them in this sort. Some ride into the See the next Chapter of another way to take them. Woods on a tame Elephant, and when they espie a wilde one, they prouoke him to fight. Whiles these are fastened in the encounter, by the teeth, or tuskes, each striuing to ouerthrow the other, some come behinde the wilde Elephant, and fa∣sten his hinder feete, and so eyther kill him for his Teeth, or by famine tame him.
Since this time o.Herinannis Hist. Nav.ab 1602. a.604. , the Hollanders haue had much trading at Patane; and the King of Ior, moued with their good successe against the Portugals, ioyned his Nauie to theirs, to chase them out of those parts. Yea, they haue braued the Portugals, euen before Goa, the Seat of their Viceroy; and in Nouember, 1604, at Calecut Step.  gen. entred into so∣lemne League with the Samaryn, and the Hollanders, against them: and the next yeare they wonne from the Portugals the Castles of Amboyne and Tidore, not to mention many other prizes taken from them by the Hollanders at sundrie times.

CHAP. III. Of the Kingdome of Pegu, or Brama. PEgu G.B.Ben. is the Citie Royall of the Kingdome Brema, or Brama, the Nati∣on where began the greatnesse of the late Kings. These Bramans in∣habited neere the Lake Chiamay, among whome the King of Pegu had his Lieutenants or Viceroyes: One whereof (the Deputie of Tan∣gu) about threescore and tenne yeares since, rebelled against him, and surprised the Kingdomes of Prom, Mellntay, Calam, Bacam, Miran∣du, Aua, all peopled with the Bramans, trending Northwards a hundred and fiftie Leagues. He after attempted Siam with an Armie of three hundred thousand, and ent three months in making way through the huge Woods and inaccessible Places, but atchieued not his purpose. After his returne, he assayled Pegu, and conquered it; and then returned the second time 1567, as in the former Chapter is mentioned. N. Pimeta lit. F.Fernandez. He subiected to his Seignorie twelue Kingdomes, which Fernandes thus rehearseth: The Kingdome of Cavelan, where are the best Rubies and Saphyres: secondly, that of Aua, the bowels whereof are filled with Mines of Copper, Lead, & Siluer: the third Bacan, enriched with Mines of Gold: Tungran, the fourth, aboundeth with Lac Hard Wax. and Lead: such is Prom, the fifth: The sixt is Iangoma, stored with Copper, Muske, Pepper, Silke, Siluer, Gold: Lauran, the seuenth, had Beioim enough to lade shippes: the eight and ninth are the Kingdomes of Trucon, Staples of China-marchandise: the tenth and ele∣uenth are the Diademes of Cublan, betweene Aua and China, poudered with precious stones: Siam, whence we last came, is the last of the twelue; in the inuasion whereof he armed a million and threescore thousand men (which number is short of Fredericke saith he had 2 & crowned kings at commaund, and that no King in the World was of greater power. Frederickes reckoning, except we ascribe that surplusage to Victuallers, Voluntaries, and Seruants and Attendants on the baggage:) which Armie (saith Fernandes) he tythed out of his people, taking one onely of tenne. Hee so abounded with wealth, that a hundred shippes, fraughted with Rice, seemed to diminish nothing of the plentie. The Fields are said to yeeld three haruests in a yeares and of Gemmes the store is beyond estima∣tion, and almost maketh them there short of the estimation of Gemmes; But this wealth, then wanting no store, had, when 'Fernandes writ this 1598, a contrane vi∣cissitude, of no store, but of want, euen of those thinges which Nature exacteth, as necessarie proppes of life. Scarcely of so many millions were left seuen thousand persons, Men, Women, and Children, to participate in the Kings imprisonment or Siege in his Tower, and those feeding on mans flesh, the parents requiring
of the children that life which before they had giuen, to sustaine their owne, and now layed them not in their bosomes, but in their bowels, the children became liuing Se∣pulchres of their scaree-dead parents. The stronger preyed vpon the weaker: and if their flesh was eaten vp before by their owne hunger, leauing nothing but skinne and bones to the hungrie assault of these raueners, they ripped the bellie, and deuoured their inward parts, and breaking the skull, sucked out the braines raw. Yea, the weaker sexe was by the strength of famine armed with no lesse butcherly despight a∣gainst whomsoeuer they could meete in the streetes of the Citie; with their kniues, which they carried about them, as harbengers to their teeth, in these inhospitall inhu∣mane-humane banquets. And thus did the besieged Citizens, while the King endured in his Tower no small part of like miserie, besides the indignitie, so to be by his owne vassalls straitned, and after slaughtered. But such is the iust hand of the King of Kings, who regardeth not persons, but as he sheweth Mercie to the mercifull, so doth he reserue Vengeance for crueltie and Tyrannie. Pardon me, Reader, if on this spectacle I cause thee, with my selfe, to stay a while and wonder. The Sunne, in his daily iourney round about this vast Globe, saw few equall (that I say no more) to this Peguan greatnesse, and yet in a small space, he that is higher then the Highest, hath abated and abased this Magnifi∣cence lower then the lowliest of his Princes. After the death of that Braman Conqueror, his sonne, in the second moneth of his succeeding Raigne, hearing that thé King of Aua, his tributarie and vncle, was plot∣ting some conspiracie, he committed to prison fortie of his Nobles, partners in that new Prolect, and bringing them all, with their Parents, Wiues, Children, Friends, and Acquaintance into a Wood, set There were destroyed by this flame and execution 4000 persons. Arthus pag.326. & Caspar Balby, c.37. hath the same number, saying, That all the Citi∣zens of Pegu were inioyned to be present at the execution. He cals the place not-a-Wood, but a Prison. He was then at Pegu. fire thereon, commaunding to cut them in pieces, whosoeuer escaped out of the flame. This kindled another fire in the hearts of his discontented subiects, which was not quenched, but with his ouerthrow. He warred on his vncle, the King of Aua, with no great aduantage, till they both agreeing to trie it by single Combat on Elephants, Pegu obtained the Conquest. In the meane time the Siamite with an Armle marched to the borders of Pegu, diuulging rumours. That he came to succour his Lord against the Avan Rebell. The King enraged here∣at, sent presently part of his forces to take him, and present him captiue: but the souldiors refused to follow the Generall in this Enterprise, and returned to their owne houses. The King, after his returne, sent to Siam, by faire speeches to persuade him to come to him: He refused his presence, but denied not his wonted Tributes. Hereupon the King, after two yeares prouision for the Warre, made that vnhappie Expedition in the former Chapter mentioned. And there the waters taking part with the Siamite, he tried once and againe the like fortunes of warre. He sent his brother the King of Iangoina, and his owne sonne twice; which did much harme to the Si∣mites, and receiued no little themselues; neuer returning without losse of halfe their armie, and of his owne soune, in the last inuasion slaine with a shot. Relentlesse hee (inflamed rather with his losses) determined another Expedition in his owne person; and therefore laid vp store of prouision in barnes at Martauan, Murmulan, Tauay, and Tànassarin, three yeares together, purposing then to employ all the Peguans in this enterprise. But they weary of forren calamities, I piscator sapi. hidde themselues in woods and wil∣dernesses, and some turned Talopores: so they call their religious persons. Many sold themselues slaues. The King persisting, in his person gaue order to his vncle Ximibe∣gus, to take a muster of all the people, and to entertaine halfe of them for the warres. But he missing so many, which had by those new courses preuented this seruice, ac∣quainteth the King therewith; who enioyneth the late professed Talopoyes to resigne their habite, the yong men to be compelled to warfare, the old men to be exiled to the Bramans, where after he caused them to be exchanged for horses. He caused all the Peguans also to be branded in the right hand, that they might be knowne. This made them entertaine thoughts of rebellion, which was first practised by the Colmians, who set a new King ouer them.
The Peguan sent an Armie against them, with charge to burne or bring away all they could finde among them, which they did, together with many of the people of both Sexes, which he (after his manner) setting Wood about them burned. And when the rest (not able to Warre against their King and famine at once,) submitted themselues, with The cruell tyranny of the K. of Pegu. exquisite torments he slew them all. He then sent to his sonne, the King of Aua, to transplant those people of euery Age & Sexe, to people these forlorne Desolations of Pegu. They, vnacquainted with this aire, brake forth in diseases, wherewith they infect∣ed also the naturall Inhabitants: which plague made such hauock, that many in impati∣ence cast themselues into the Riuer. The Murmulans with helpe of the Siamites seised on their Castle, whom the King besieged a yeere together, and then was forced from thence by the Siamites sudden irruption, with losse of the most of his people: the hor∣ses, Elephants, & country it selfe remaining their recompence. And the Peguan Cap∣taines also, fearing their Maisters tyranny, became subiects to the Siamite, whose whole families this tyrant with fire & water destroyed, so that all the tract from Pegu to Mar∣taua and Murmulan was made a Wildernes. These things done, hee sent for his yonger sonne, the King of Prm, and commanded him to the siege of Murmulan: who, vtterly misking the attempt, conuaied himselfe in the night homewards, with purpose of re∣bellion. The King of Siam not ignorant of this Peguan estate, inuaded the countrey in har∣uest-time, and therefore that, which they could, they conuayed into barnes, the rest was fired. He proceeded and laide siege to Pegu: in which at that time were a hun∣dred and fifty thousand men, and three thousand peeces of ordinance, a thousand whereof were Brasse: but (as is said) for feare of the Portugales, which were said to haue entred into Siam by the way of Camboia he departed, leauing Famine behinde as Lieutenant of his Warres, which caused the Forrenners, then in Pegu for the de∣fence thereof, to get them to their owne homes. Those few which remained, liued with prouision from Tangu. The King sent to his Deputy in Tangu, to come to him with all the Inhabitants of the Countrey and their store, leauing his Wife, and some few to guard the Citie. He answered that he would send halfe, and to demaund all were vnreasonable. The King sends foure Noble men with Souldiours to force him hereun∣to. But he slayeth the leaders, and seiseth on their followers. Thus the Famine encrea∣sing, and the people eating one another, the King numbreth the Citizens, among whom he findeth seuen thousand Siamites, whom he commanded to be slaine, not lea∣uing aboue thirty thousand of all sorts in the Citie. His sonne, the King of Prom, which had now stood out three yeares, began to relent and sue for pardon, with promise to bring the Promans (to the number of fifty thousand) to the Citie, whereat his Father reioiced, and sealed his pardon which hee sent him with many gifts. Iudas cannot be secure, till he hang him∣selfe, But his chiefe counsellor, authour of this rebellion, fearing all the blame would bee laide on him, poisoned the Prince: himselfe, aspiring to the Kingdome, was within one weeke de∣stroyed: and the Nobles, euery man seeking to seise the state to himselfe, caused that of those fiftie thousand, within two moneths space, whiles euery weeke they had a new Prince, scarse remained fiftie men fit for Warre, which departed to Pegu, three or foure in a Ship, leauing their Countrey to the habitation of wilde beasts. The Natiues of Pegu are not quite extinct, but many of them are fledde into other Kingdomes; of whom, and of the Bramans, Iangoma numbreth a hundred and twenty thousand: Oracan, twentie thousand: Siam, a hundred thousand: and the King of Iangoma is able (they say) to arme a million of men. The Talapoyes perswaded the Iangoman to depose his brother of Pegu. Hee al∣ledged his oath vnto his Father, while he liued. They reply, that no oath might prohi∣bite, if he placed his brother in a Vahat (or golden Throne) to be adored for a God. And partly with this (I may not call it) reason: and partly, as Xerxos alleadged for him∣selfe, because that his elder brother was borne before his Father was King, and because his mother was the former King of Pegu's daughter, he perswaded himselfe that it was lawfull. And thus vvas the state of this mightie Kingdome in the yeare 1598, brought
to one Citie, which also was now become a withered carkasse, and well neare the Se∣pulchre of it selfe, and (as mischiefes come not alone) beseeged by Mogus, King of Orracan. Andreas A Boues. Boues (in his Letters the 28. of March, 1600.) thus finisheth this Trage∣die. When the King of Pegu saw himselfe in such streites, besieged by the Kings of Orracan, or Arracan, and Tangu, he yeelded himselfe to the King of Tangu: vvho dealt treacherously with him, and cut off his head, as hee did to the Queene likewise, and the Prince. Hee then hasted to the Tower of Pegu, vvhere he found as much gold and Iewels as laded six hundred Elephants, and as many Horses, besides siluer and other mettalls of smaller price. The King of Arracan then absent, and angry that the King of Tangu (contrarie to promise) had seised all the treasure to himselfe, he pur∣posed to inuade his kingdome, and to that intent, had the aide of many Portugales (amongst whom this Iesuite was one) who saw the wayes and fieldes, lately so fer∣tile, now full strewed with dead mens bones and Skulles, and in the Riuers all passage of Ships hindered by the Carkasses of men. The King of Arracan found in the towne aforesaid, three millions of siluer, with the Artillerie: and then remained Lord of Pegu. Bnt the Kings of Siam and Iangoma preuented his enterprise for Tan∣gu, vvhich they inuaded to depriue him of his treasures. The King of Siam twice as∣sailed Martauan with repulse, vvherevpon, hee caused two of his cowardly Cap∣taines A cruell pu∣nishment of Cowards. to bee cast into Cauldrons of scaulding Oile: and the third time conquered that kingdome. Thus haue you heard of the power and subuersion of this great Monarchy: so much the more lamentable, because their fall was from such a height. The Countrey is so fertile, that at what time so euer Corne bee put into the ground, the paiment is good vvith increase. I haue seene vvich mine eyes (saith Caesar Frederike) that they haue eaten Serpents, Scorpions, all manner of Hearbes and grasse. Such fertilitie, and such stomackes, as they make credible the reports of their huge Armies, so doe they make more terrible the reports of their desolations. This that I speake of their diet, I vnderstand not of their extremitie and Famine, but ordinarily. Mr. Fitch saith the same, that they eate Rootes, Hearbes, Leaues, Dogges, Cats, Rats, and Snakes, they refuse almost nothing. It is aboue a hundred yeares since Vertomannus was there, who in company of a Persian Marchant went to visit the King, who then had warres in Aua. They went in a Boate all of one peece of Wood, fifteene or sixteene paces long. The Oares were Canes, and the Mast was one Cane as bigge as a Herring-Barrell. The King wore as many Iewels as vvere worth a great Citie, which made him in the night time to shine as the Sunne. Hee had then a sacrifice to doe to the Diuell, and the next day the Persian presented him with rich Coralls, vvhich hee tooke in so good worth, that hee gaue him as many Rubies as were vvorth a hundred thousand du∣cats. The King, that liued when Maister Fitch 1588. M.R. Fitch. Cas. Fred. was there, had one Wife, and three hun∣dred Concubines: of whom hee was said to haue fourescore and ten Children. Hee sate in iudgement almost euery day. They vse no speech in their sutes, but giue vp their Supplications, written in the Leaues of a Tree with the point of an Iron bigger then a bodkin. These Leaues are of an Elne long, and two inches broad: they are also double. Hee which giueth in his Supplication standeth a little off, with a present: which, if the King granteth his request, he accepteth; if not, hee returneth vvith his present. Pegu is (or at least in a more vnhappy tense, when they were there, was) a Cittie great, strong, and very faire, with walls of stone, and great ditches round about it, with many Crocodiles in them. There are two townes; the olde, in which the Merchants a∣bide, and the houses are made of Canes called Bambos: and the new, for the King and his Nobilitie. The Citie is square with faire walles, hauing in each square fiue Gates, be∣sides many Turrets for Centinels to watch, made of Wood, and gilded very faire. The streetes are straight as a Line from one Gate to another: and so broad, that ten or
twelue men may ride a-front through them. On both sides at euery mans doore is set a Coco-tree, yeelding a faire shew, and comfortable shadow, that a man might walke in the shade all day. The Houses are made of Wood, and couered with Tiles. The Kings house is in the middest, walled and ditched about: and the houses within of wood sumptuously wrought and gilded. And the house wherein his Pagode or Idoll stan∣deth, is couered with Tiles of siluer, and all the walles are gilded with Gold. Within the first Gate of the Kings House was a large roome, on both sides whereof were houses made for the Kings Elephants. Among the rest hee had foure white Elephants, a thing rare in Nature, but more precious in his estimation. For this is part of his Royall Title, The King of the White Elephants. And if any other hath any bee will seeke by fauour or force to haue the same, which (some Linscot say) was the cause of the quarrell betwixt him and the King of Siam. Great seruice was done vnto them. Euery one of these white E∣lephants stood in an house gilded with Gold, and were fed in vessels of siluer gilt. One of them, as hee went euery day to the Riuer to bee washed, passed vnder a Cano∣pie of Cloth of Golde or Silke, carried by six or eight men; as many going before playing on Drummes or other Instruments. At his comming out of the Riuer, a Gen∣tleman washed his feete in a Siluer Bason. There were of blacke Elephants nine Cu∣bits high. The King was said to haue aboue fiue thousand Elephants of Warre. There was about a mile from Pegu, a place builded vvith a faire Court i it, to take wilde Elephants in a Groue: which they doe by the Female Elephants, trained to this pur∣pose, and annointed with a certaine Oyle, which causeth the wilde Elephant to follow her. R. Fitch. 28.cal. Balbye c. 38. When the Hunts men haue brought the Elephant neere to the Citie, they send vvord thereof, and many horse-men and foote-men come out and cause the Female to take a streight way, which leadeth to the place where shee enreth, and he after her for it is like a Wood. When they are in, the Gate is shutte, and they get out the Fe∣male. The wilde one seeing himselfe alone, weepeth, and runneth against the walles which are made of strong Trees: some of them breake their teeth therewith. Then they prick him with shape Canes, and cause him to goe into a strait house, and there fasten him with a rope, and let him fast three or foure daies, and then bring a Female to him, with meate and drinke, within few daies taming him. When they goe into the Warres, they set a frame of wood vpon their backes (bound with great Cordes) wherein sit foure or six men, which fight with Gunnes, Darts, Arrowes, and other weapons. All Authors agree, that no beast commeth so neere the reason of a man as the Elephant, yea they seeme to goe before some men in conceit, haughtinesse, desire of glory, thankefulnes, &c. The Peguans are beardlesse: and carrie pinsers about them to plucke out the haires if any growe. They blacke their Teeth, for they say a Dogge hath white teeth. The men of Pegu, Aua, Iangoma and Brama weare balles in their yards, which they put in the skinne beeing cut, and vveare, for euery Childe one, till they haue three, and may take them out at pleasure: the least is as bigge as any Wall-out: the biggest as bigge as a little Hennes Egge. They were inuented to preuent Sodo∣my, which they vse more then any people in the world: Abusing the Male-Sexe, causeth the women also to weare scant clothes, that as they goe, their thigh is seene bare, to prouoke men to lust. If the King giue any one of his Balles, it is a great iewell accounted: they heale the place in six or eight daies. The Bramas that are of the kings bloud pricke some part of their skinne, and put therein a blacke colour, which last∣eth alway. If any Marchants resort thither, he shall haue many Maides (saith Lins Lins∣choten) offered him by their parents to take his choise, and hauing agreed with the parents he may, for the time of his abode, vse her as his slaue, or his Concubine, with∣out any discredit to her. Yea, if hee come againe, after shee is married, hee may, for the time hee stayeth there, demaund her in like sort to his vse. And vvhen a man marrieth, hee vvill request some of his friendes to lye the first night vvith his Bride. There are also among them that sowe vp the priuie part of their. Daughters, leauing onely passage for Vrine: which, when they marry passe vnder the Surgeons hand for remedy. Caspar Balby, and Got. Arthus, tell of another custome
of their Virgins, if that name may be giuen them. For saith he, Histor.Indiae Orien.pag.313. Virgines in hoc regno omuinò nullareperire lcet: Puellae eni emues statim à pueritia sua medicamentū quoddam vsurpant, quo muliebria disten duntur & apertae continontur: idque propter globuls quos in virgs vir gestant: illis enim admittendis virgines arctiores nullo modo sufficerent. If a man be bankerupt the Creditor may sell his wife and Children. Their money is called Gan∣za, and is made of Copper and Leade, which euery man may stampe that will. Gold and Siluer is marchandise and not money. The tides of the Sea betweene Martauan and Pegu by Caesar Fredericke Cas.Fred. are reputed the greatest wonder which he saw in his trauels: being so violent, that the ayre is filled with noise, and the earth quaketh at the approch of this watery element, shooting the botes that passe therewith as ar∣rowes, which at a high water they suffer not to anker in the Chanell, which would betray them to the deuouring iawes of the returning tide, but draw them toward some banke, where they rest in the ebbe on dry land, as high from the Chanels bot∣tome as any house top. And if they arriue not at their certaine Stations, they must backe againe whence they came, no place else being able to secure them. And when it encreaseth againe, it giueth them three calls or salutations: the first waue washeth ouer the barke from Stemme to sterne: the second, is not so furious: the third, raiseth the Anker. In Negrais in Pegu R.Fitch. diuers people dwell in boates which they call Paroes; the country being full of Riuers, in which they goe too and fro with their Families: as strange is the dwelling here on the land; their houses being set on high Posts, and their going vp on Ladders for feare of Tygers. From hence to Pegu, is ten daies iourney by the Riuers, in which way is Cosmon and Medon, where their markets (are as their dwellings) vpon the water in Boates, with a great Sombrero, like a Cart-wheele, to keepe off the Sunne, made of Coco-Leaues. CHAP. IIII. Of the Religion in Pegu, and the Countrey thereunto subiect. THeir Varellaes or Idoll-Temples in the Kingdome of Pegu are many. R.Fitch. Cas.Fredrike. They are made round like a Sugar-Loafe or a Bell: some are as high as a Church or a reasonable Steeple, very broad beneath: some a quarter of a mile in compasse: In the making of them, they consume many Sugar-Canes with which they couer them from the top to the bottom. Within, they be all earth, done about with stone. They spend thereon much Gold, for they be all guilded aloft, and many of them from the top to the bot∣tome: and euery ten or twelue yeares, they must be new gilded, because the raine consumeth off the Gold, for they stand open abroad. Were it not for this vaine custome, Golde would heere be good-cheape. About two daies iourney from Pegu, there is a Varelle, Cas.Balby saith that ma∣ny of these Vareles were burned, toge∣ther with foure thousand hou∣sand houses in Pegu by neg∣ligence of a Portugall Marriner. or Pagode, which is the Pilgrimage of the Pegues. It is called Dogonne, and is of wonderfull bignes, and all gilded from the foote to the top. This house is fifty fiue paces in length, and hath in it three Iles or Walkes, and forty great Pillars gilded, which stand betweene them. It is gilded with golde within and without. There are houses ve∣ry faire round about for the Pilgrims to lie in: and many goodly houses for the Talli∣poies to preach in, which are full of images both of men & women all ouer gilded; I sup∣pose it the fairest place in the world. It standeth very high, and there are foure waies to it, which all along are set with Trees of Fruits in such wise, that a man may goe in the shade aboue two miles in length. And when their Feast-day is, a man can hardly passe by water or by Land for the great prease of people, which resort thither from all places of the kingdome. There are on the shore of Dogon two Statues, which from the head downeward represent yongmen, but haue the faces of Diuels, and two winges on their backes. In Pegu there is a Varelle or Temple, like to this, which the King frequented to doe his holies therein, mounting vp Staires
at the foote whereof were two Tigres gaping wide, seeming as if they had beene aliue. Besides the many Magazins (or Treasuries full of Treasure) which the late Bramen King had, hee had neere vnto the palace a Court walled with stone, the gates whereof were open euery day. Within this Court are foure guilded houses co∣uered with Leade: and in euery of them certaine Idols of great value. In the first house was a great Statue of Gold, and on his head a crowne of Gold; beset with rare Ru∣bies, and Sapphires, and about him foure little children of Gold. In the second house is another of Siluer, as high as an house, set as it were sitting on heapes of money, crowned, his foote is as long as a man. In the third house there is the like Idol of brasse, and in the fourth, of Ganza, (which is their money mettall, tempred of Leade and Copper) In another Court not farre from this, stand foure other Colosses, or huge ima∣ges of Copper, in houses gilded faire, as they are themselues, saue the head. Balby Balby c.38. tels of fiue made of Ganza, so monstrous, that the toes of their feete were as bigge as a man, and fitting crosse-legged were yet as high as one could hurle a stone, and were all gilded. Fernandes Fernandes Epist. relateth of threescore and seuen Images of Gold, richly ador∣ned with Iewels, and three hundred threescore and six Combalengas or Gourds of Gold, molten by the Kings Father, each weighing a hundred and fourescore pound; besides his other treasures; to conceale which hee slew two hundred Eunuches his attendants. Their Tallipoies, R. Frith. before they take orders, goe to schoole, till they bee twenty yeares olde or more: then they come before a Tallipoie, appointed for that purpose, whom they call Rowli. Hee (as cheefe and most learned) examineth them many times, whether they will leaue their friends, and the company of all women, and take vpon them the habit of a Talipoy. If hee be content, then he rideth vpon an horse about the streetes, very richly apparelled, with Drummes and pipes to shew that hee leaueth the riches of the world to be a Tallipoie. In few daies after, hee is car∣ried vpon a thing like an horslitter, which they call a Serion vpon ten or twelue mens shoulders, in apparell of a Tallipoy, with Pipes and Drummes and many Tal∣lipoies with him and all his friends: which accompany him to his house, standing without the towne, and there leaue him. Euery one of them hath his house which is very little) set vpon six or eight postes, to which they ascend on a Ladder of twelue or fourteene steppes. These houses are commonly by the high-waies side, and among the Trees, and in the Woods. They goe stangely apparelled with one Camboline or thinne cloth next to their body, of a browne colour; another, of yellow, doubled many times vpon their shoulders. These two be girded to them with a broad girdle: and they haue a skinne of Leather hanging on a string about their neckes, whereon they sit bare-headed, and bare-footed, with their right armes bare, and a broad Sombrero or shadow in their hands to defend them in Summer, from the Sunne, and in Winter, from the Raine. They goe with a great pot made of wood or fine Earth, and conered, tied with a broad girdle vpon their shoulder, which commeth vnder their arme: wherewith they goe to begge their victuals which they eate, which is Rice, Fish, and Hearbes. They demaund nothing, but come to the doore, and the people presently doe giue them one thing or other: they put altogether in their pot. They keepe their Feasts by the Moone: and at a new Moone is their most solemne Feast: and then the people send Rice and other things to that Kiack or Church, of which they be: and there all the Tallipoies of that Church meete and eate that which is sent them. They preach against all abuses, and many resort vnto them. When they enter in∣to their Kiack at the doore there is a great iarre of water, with a Cocke or a Ladle in it, and there they wash their feete, and then enter in, lifting vp their hands to their heads, first to their Preacher, and then to the Sunne, and so sit downe. When the Tallipoies preach, many of the people carry them gifts into the pulpit, where they sit & preach. And there is one which sitteth by them to take that which the people bring, which is diuided among them. They haue none other ceremonies nor seruice that I could see but onely preaching.
Boterus G.B.B.l.part 3 Arthus pag. 319. saith, that they hold an innumerable multitude of worlds successiue∣ly one after another, and also innumerable number of Gods: but not all at once. They imagine that fiue haue gouerned this present world, whereof foure are passed aboue two hundred yeares agoe. Now they are without a God, and expect the fift many ages hereafter: after whose death, they conceiue that the world shall perish by fire, and then another world shall follow, and other Gods to rule it. They reckon likewise in the number of their Gods certaine men, which yet haue first passed into fishes, beasts, and birds of all sorts. After death they beleeue three places, one of pleasure; (like the Mahumetane Paradise) another of torment; the third, of annihilation, which they call Niba. The soules after their phantasie abide in the two former places, whence they returne so often into this life till at last they be holden worthy that Niba. He addeth, that they haue Couents, or Colledges of Priests, which liue three hundred together, or more in one place, haue no vse of women, are harbourers of strangers, and liue some of almes, some of rents. They haue like Nun∣ries also for the women. There is supposed to be in one Idol-sanctuarie (whereof they haue many) 120000. Idols. They fast thirty dayes in the yeare: in which they eate nothing till night. They are of opinion, that he which in this world robbeth another man shall in the next world be his seruant for recompence. They hold it a sinne also to kill a liuing creature, although this bee not strictly obserued amongst them. Some Iewes are of opinion that this people descended of those Israelites vvhich Solomon sent to Ophir, which they place in this Kingdom. Part 1.l.2. But the Peguans themselues ascribe their originall to a dogge, and a China-woman, which escaped ship∣wracke. The Diuell is highly worshipped of these Pegusians, Caspar. Balby. Got. Arthus. histor. Indiae. Pag. 321. to whom they erect a state∣ly Altar, and adorne it with varietie of flowers, and meates of all sorts, so to see and feede him that hee should not hurt them. This is principally done when they are sicke: for then they make vowes, and build Altars, which they couer with clothes and flow∣ers. They entertaine him also with diuersitie of musicke, and appoint him a Priest whom they call the Deuils Father, which procureth his rites and musicke. Some, as soone as they arise from their beds, bring a basket of rice, and meates, and a burning Torch in their hands, running vp and down in the streets, openly professing to feede the diuel to preuent harme from them that day. And if dogges follow them, they hold them to be sent of the Diuell to deuoure those meates in his name. Some will not eate, till they haue first cast something behinde their backes to the Diuell. And in the country-villages some of the richer inhabitants leaue their houses furnished with store of foode three moneths space to be inhabited of him, keeping meane while in the fieldes: that so the other nine monethes they may be out of his danger. And howsoeuer the Talo∣pois preach against this diuellish deuotion, yet they cannot reclaime the people. The Talipoies euery Monday, arise early, and by the ringing of a Bason call together the people to their Sermons, which are of Iustice to man, but nothing of Religion to God. They wash themselues often, C. Balby C, 39. and the water, wherewith they are washed, the people account holy, and reserue it for their drinke. They haue many feasts very solemnely obserued. Sapan. Giachie One Feast (called Sapan Giachie) is kept twelue leagues from the Citie: whither the King rides in a triumphall Chariot, with his Queene in exceeding pompe, his Nobles attending. Another Sapan Catena. is kept in Pegu, against which day all the Courtiers prouide them certaine pillars or I∣mages of diuers formes, kept closely, that none may see what others haue prouided, till the day. These are made of Indian Reedes, carued and guilded, and on the feastinall presented to the King, who praiseth the most artificiall of them. All that night huge lights of waxe are burnt in honour of their Idol, whose Feast it is, that all may see to haue accesse to him, to which end the Citie-Gates are left open. But none may approch vnto him empty-handed. They haue Sapan Daiche a Feast of watering celebrated in the olde Citie, where the King, Queene, and his Children, with Rose-water sprinkle one another. And all the Captaines likewise besprinkle each other, that they seeme as wet as if they came out of a Riuer. It is said of the last Kings father, that when the people
were thus washing, hee would send amongst them an Elephant, which slew many of them, whereat he laughed; the people lamented. An other feast Sapan Dunan. they haue, where∣in they haue a triall of their shippes, which can saile best: this feast lasteth a month: A fift feast Sapan Giaimosegenon. is called Gianosegenon, in honour of a certaine Idoll; they haue many o∣ther feasts, but these the most solemne. Antony Correa, a Portugall, concluding a league with the King of Pegu, the Kings Deputy caused the articles of accord, writ∣ten in Portugall and Pegu languages with golden letters, to be read aloude, and then rent the scrole, and with a few leaues of an odoriferous tree, caused the same to bee burned to ashes, vpon which hee layed both hands of the Priest, who in the name of the King, sware to those Articles. These things being done with great attention and silence, Correa. loath in a superstitious fancie, to defile Holle Writ, with confirmati∣on of an oath to a Gentile, sware on a Booke of amorous Sonnets, to keepe inuiola∣ble the said Articles. In the yeare of our Lord 1585. the King of Aua rebelling, (as is before shewed) the King of Pegu, by single combate, slew the traitor. The fight was on Elephants, in which the Pegusians Elephant, and the Auan Prince, died. The liuing Elephant was preferred to the place of the former; but in fifteene dayes space (let the beastlinesse of men imitate the humanity of a beast) he sorrowed so Caspar Balby was there with other Mer∣chants, which saw him wee∣ping. for his Maister, that nothing might comfort him. And although hee had continually two seruants attending him, and telling him of his amended estate vnder a mightier maister, yet would hee scarce cease to weepe, or beginne to eate, till his fifteene dayes exequies were finished. Bomferrus a Franciscan spent three yeares in learning the Pegu's language, and mysteries, that he might preach the Christian Religion amongst them, but was soone forced to giue ouer and returne into India. For they could not endure to heare anie better knowledge then they had. Crocodiles and Aps C. Balby. are accounted holy and sacred creatures, for which cause Apes multiply exceedingly; none taking them, except for the vse of their Varelles or Temples, where they tie them, and keepe them with diligent réspect. And though the Crocodiles in the Towne-ditch deuoure men daily, yet in a blinde zeale they will drinke no other water, and account their soules certainely saued, whose bodies are thus certainely lost and deuoured of those beasts, which sometimes are thirtie foote in length. The Kings, subiect to the King of Pegu, did their homage, and presented themselues before him, kneeling, yea they not onely kneeled to him, but to his white Elephants also. When the King dieth, they make two shippes with golden couers, and betwixt them erect a golden Theater; in which they place the corpse, applying thereto muske, and the most sweet woods, with other things: and so set forth the same to Sea, setting that Theater or Pagcant on fire. In one of the shippes are Talapoies, which sing till they thinke the body consumed to ashes. Then do they make a masse or lumpe of these ashes and milke, and commit the same to Sea in the hauen of Sirian at an ebbing wa∣ter: the bones which remaine they carry to an other place, and there erecting a Chap∣pell, doe bury the same therein. After this they returne to the pallace, and, according to the accustomed rites, inaugurate the new King. The father of that King (whose tragedie yee haue heard) had his bones buried in Dogon. In Dagin or Dacin, as certaine Merchants at Martaban told our Author Balby ca.42., That if the King be in loue with a maide, he asketh her fathers consent, which yet few will graunt, because he is still tied to maintaine his daughter; the King allowing no expen∣ses to his wife. In some places of that kingdome are men-eaters, called Batacchi, which when their parents grow olde, kill them, and eate them as great dainties. When the King hath condemned a man for some crime, these are his executioners, who in the presence of the king cut off his head, hands and feete, and adding pepper and salt, eate his flesh raw. He is called the king of Assi, and is of great power, hath many ships, much pepper, and is a sworne enemy to the Portugalls, working all the euill he can to Malacca. If the father knoweth the sonne to be guilty (or the sonne the father) of some grieuous crime, he may slay him, but must after giue account to the king; and if he al∣low
the fact, all is will; otherwise he is liable to punishment. In Iamahey or Iangoma (fiue and twenty daies iourney from Pegu) when the peo∣ple be sicke, they make a vow, to offer meate vnto the deuil, if they escape: and when they be recouered, they make a banquet, with many pipes, and drummes, and many other Instruments, and dauncing all the night. Their friends bring them presents, Cocos, figges, Arrecaes, and other fruits; and with great dancing and reioycing, they offer to the deuill, and say, they giue the deuill to eate, and driue him out, and to this end in their dancing they crie and hollow very lowd. Likewise, when they be sicke, a Tallipoy or two, euery night doth sit by them, and sing, to please the deuill, that he should not hurt them. When one is dead, he is carried vpon a great frame, made like a Tower, with a couering all gilded, made of canes, carried by foureteene or sixteene men, with great minstrel sie to a place out of the Towne, and there is burned. Hee is accompanied with all his friends and neighbours, all men: and they giue to the Tallipoies, or Priests, many mattes and cloth: and then returne to the house, where they feast it two dayes: which being expired, the women accompany the wife to the place where he was burned, and there spend a while in mourning: then doe they gather the peeces of bones, which be left vnburned, and burie them, and then returne to their houses. The neere of kindred doe also shaue their heads, both men and women. CHAP. V. Of Bengala, and the parts adioyning. THe kingdome of Bengala Mgin. Gin. Bet. Ben. Got. Arthus hist. d Orient. pag. 282. is very large, and hath of coast one and twenty leagues, and as much within land. The riuer Chaberis (which some call Guenga, and thinke to be the ancient Ganges) watereth it: It is plentifull in rice, wheate, sugar, ginger, long pepper, cotton and silke: and enioyeth a very wholesome ayre. The inhabitants neare the shore, are (for the most part) Mahumetans, and so also was the king, before the great Mogore (one likewise of his owne Sect) conquered him. Gouro the seate royall, and Bengala are faire cities. Of this the Gulfe, sometimes called Gangeti∣cus, now beareth name Golfo di Bengala. Chatigan is also reckoned amongst their Cities. They Linschot. ca. 16. are a most subtile and wicked people, and are esteemed the worst slaues of all India: for that they are all theeues; and the women, whoores; although this fault is common through all India, no place excepted. They haue a custome, neuer to dresse or seeth meate twice in one pot, but haue euery time a new one. Whensoeuer they are found in adultery, they haue their Adulterie punished. noses cut off, and are thence forwards nar∣rowly looked to, that they keepe not each others company. The Portugalles haue here Porto grande, and Porto Pequino, but without forts and gouernment; euerie man liuing after his owne lust: and for the most part, they are such as dare not stay in their places of better gouernement, for some wickednesse by them committed. In Bengala are found great numbers of Abadas or Rhinocerotes, whose horn (grow∣ing out of his snowt) teeth, flesh, bloud, clawes, and whatsoeuer he hath without & within his body, is good against poyson, and is much accounted of throughout all India. The skinne Linschot. c. 47 vpon the vpper part of this beast, is all wrinckled, as if hee were armed with shields. It is a great enemy of the Elephant. Some thinke that this is the right Vnicorne, because as yet there is no other by late trauellers found, but one∣ly by heare-say. Onely Ludonicus Vertomannus Lud. Vert.lib.1.ca.19. saith he sawe a couple of those true Vnicornes at Mecca; one whereof had a horse of three cubits, being of the bignes of a colt of two yeres and a halfe old; the other was much lesse: both sent to the Sul∣tan of Mecca, for a rare present out of Aethiopia. Gesner in his Booke of Foure-foo∣ted Beasts, Gesner s de Quadrup. citeth this testimony, and some others, whereby he perswadeth, that there are diuers sorts of these Vnicornes: But it cannot seeme otherwise then strange, that
in this last hundred of yeares. Wherein the world hath vnveiled her face more then e∣uer before; none of credite (that I haue read) hath affirmed himselfe to haue seene this Vnicorne, but in picture. That which is reported of their vertue against poyson, pro∣ceedeth from the hearbes which Bengala yeeldeth: for in other places they are not heere the price of these. There are heere also certaine wilde Goats, whose hornes are in account against venome: as I my selfe (saith Linschoten) haue proued. The kings Gi Bot. Ben. of Bengala, in times past, were chosen of the Abassine or Aethiopian slaues, as the Soldans of Cairo were sometime of the Circassian Mamalukes. North∣wards of Bengala lieth the kingdome of Arracan. The great Can subdued these parts and the kingdome of Mien, about the yeare 1272, while Mcus Paulus liued there. Arracam, Chandican, and Syripur are by Fernandez placed in Bengala, as so many kingdoms: Patane or Patenau by Frederike and Fitch reckoned to an other Bengalan kingdome: which our Countreyman Maister Fitch calleth the kingdom of Gouren: so that vnder this name Bengala are comprehended many Seigniories; all, or the most part now subiect to the Mogor. Our Mappes seeme not to describe the riuer Ganges (so will we here terme it with Ortellius, Castaldus, Barrius, and all our later Trauellers, both Merchants and Iesuits) according to the due course thereof. For Chaberis they bring from the North encli∣ning to the East, Guenga from the West; but Maister Fitch, which continued fiue mo∣neths in passing downe first in Iamena from Agra, which falleth into Ganges, and then in Ganges it selfe to Bengala (although hee confesseth it may be done in shorter time) saith it commeth from the North-west, and runneth East into the Sea. Some call Chaberis, Ganges; and some hold Guenga to be Ganges; and some make but one riuer of them both: and hence may happly arise in part, that seeking of Ganges so farre off. There is in Ganges Balby ca. 4. a place called Gongasagie, that is, the entry of the Sea, in which are many fishes called Sea-dogges. They which are weary of this world, and desire to haue a quicke passage to Paradise, cast in themselues here to be deuoured of these fishes; perswading themselues, that the next and readiest way thither, is by their jawes. Ganges R. Fitch. ouerflowing his bankes, in times past drowned many villages, which so remayne; and hath changed his wonted Channell: the cause that Tanda (a Citie of trafficke) standeth now a league from the riuer. It watereth a fruitfull Countrey and populous, and (as the Oceans high Collector) receiueth into him many riuers by the way, some no lesle then it selfe, so that in the time of raine, you can not see from the one side of Ganges to the other. The superstitious opinion conceiued, in those parts, of this riuer, appeareth by the reports of all. Hier.  Eman. Pin. Emanuel Pinner at Cambaia obserued many to resort thither on pilgrimage, sometime out of that Citie foure thousand; and was told by the Gouernor of Bengala vnder the Mogor then at Lahor, that there came thither sometime three hundred thousand or foure hundred thousand Pilgrims. And addeth, That not long before his comming to Cambaia there assembled there, to this deuout iourney, fiftie thousand people. Happy they esteeme that man which wa∣sheth himselfe therein, and secure of saluation, if at the point of death he may drinke of this water. Pardaw is three testons Portugale. Hee conferred with one Gedacham, a great man, which had beene on this holy voyage, and had there weighed his mother three times; first, by her weight in siluer; secondly, in golde; thirdly, in pearles, all which hee gaue vnto the poore. M. Pimenta. A brother of his, called Ra, being to goe to the great Mogore, offered one hundred and fiftie thousand Pardawos that his Pagodes or Idoles should send him good successe. They make an Image also to this riuer, whereunto they doe diuine honour. The king of Calecut and the other kings of Malabar keep a solemne feast e∣uery twelue yeares, in honour of this riuer; because that long since a certaine Bra∣mene (falsely accused) fled vnto Ganges, and there led an austere life twelue yeres; worshipping that Streame and his Idoll, to whom when he purposed to return home, after those twelue yeares expired, that Image of Ganges appeared, and said, that on the last day of February hee would appeare in a riuer of his owne Countrey, and cause
the waters thereof to arise, and runne backeward in witnesse of his innocencie, and bade him assemble all the Lords of Malabar to the sight, which accordingly came to passe, and the memory thereof is by this Feast solemnized. Bannaras R. Fitch. is a great Towne on Ganges, to which the Gentiles out of farre coun∣tries come on pilgrimage. The men are shauen all but the crowne. Alongst the wa∣ter-side are many faire houses, in which stand Images of euill fauour, made of stone, and wood, like leopards, lions, monkeis, men, women, peacockes, and deuills, with foure armes and hands, sitting close-legged, and holding somewhat in their hands. There are diuers old men, which on places of earth, made for the purpose, sit praying, and they glue the people (which by breake of day, and before, come out of the towne, to wash themselues in Ganges) three or foure strawes, which they take, and hold them betweene their fingers where they wash themselues: & some sit to mark them in the foreheads, and they haue in a cloth a litle rice, barly, or mony, which they giue to these old men. After that, they go to diuers of their images, and giue them of their sacrifi∣ces, those old men in the meane while praying, which maketh all holy. They haue one idoll called Ada, with foure hands and clawes. On certaine great carued stones also they poure water, rice, wheat &c. They haue a great place like a wel, with steps to goe down, wherein the water standeth foule, and stinketh by reason of those many flo∣wers, which they continually throw thereinto. Many people are alwaies therein with imagination of pardon for their sins, because God (as they blaspheme) washed himself therein. They gather vp the sand in the botome, as a holy relike. They pray not but in the water, and wash themselues ouer head, lading vp water with both their hands, and turne themselues about, and then drinke a little of the water three times, after which they goe to their Gods in their houses. Some of them will wash a place which is their length, and then will pray vpon the earth, with their armes and legs at length out, and will rise vp and lie downe, and kisse the ground twenty or thirtie times, but will not stirre their right foote. Some vse fifteene or sixteene pots, little and great, rin∣ging a bell while they make their mixtures ten or twelue times; and make a circle of water about their pots, and pray: others sitting by, one of which reacheth them their pots. They say ouer these pots diuers things many times, which done, they go to their gods and strew their sacrifices, which they thinke are very holy, and marke many of them which sit by in the foreheads, esteemed as a great gift. There come fiftie, and sometime a hundred together, to this Well, and to these Idoles. About their Idolls in some houses sitteth one in warme weather to blow the wind with a fan vpon them. And when they see any company comming, they ring a little bell, and many giue them their almes. None of these idolles haue a good face. Some are blacke, and haue clawes of brasse; and some ride on peacockes or other fowles. One there is alwayes attended with his fan, to make winde, which (they say) giueth them all things, both food and rayment. Heere some be burned to ashes, some scor∣ched in the fire, and throwne into the water, when they are dead: the Foxes presently eate them. The wiues do burne with their husbands when they die: if they will not, their heads be shauen, and neuer any account is made of them after. If a man or wo∣man be sicke, and like to die, they will lay him before their idolles all night: and that shall mend or end him. And if he do not mend, that night his friends will come and fit a little with him, and cry, and after will carry him to the waters side, and set him vpon a little raft made of reeds, and so let him go downe the riuer. The chiefe idols are very euill-fauoured, their mouthes monstrous, their eares gilded, and full of jewelles, their teeth and eyes of gold, siluer, glasse, coloured blacke, with Lampes continually burning before them. Into their houses or Temples you may not enter, with your shooes on. When the scorched Indians are throwne into Ganges, the men swim with their faces downewards, the women with their faces vpwards; which I had thought they had by some meanes caused, but they denied it. The people goe all naked, with a little cloth about their middle. Their women are exceedingly on their necks, armes, and eares, decked with rings of siluer, copper, tin, and iuory hoopes; they are marked with a great spot of red in their foreheads, and a stroke of red vp to the crowne, and so
it runneth three wayes. Their marriages are in this sort: The manner of their marri∣ages. The man and the woman come to the water side, where standeth a Bramane or Priest, with a Cow and a Calfe, or a Cow with Calfe: These all goe into the water together, the Bramane holding a white cloth of foure yards long, and a basket crosse bound with diuerse things in it. This cloth he laieth vpon the backe of the Cow. And then he taketh the Cow by the taile and saith certaine words. She hath a copper or a brasse pot-ful-of water. The man holdeth his hand by the Bramans hand, and the wiues hand by her husbands, and all haue the Cow by the taile. Then they poure water out of the pot vpon the Cowes taile, which runneth through all their hands, and they lade vp water with their hands, and then the Bramane tieth their clothes together. After this they goe round about the Cowe and Calfe, and giue somewhat to the poore there attending, leauing the Cow and Calfe for the Bramans vse, and offer to diuers of their Idolls money, then ly∣ing downe vpon the ground, they kisse it diuers times, and goe their way. Betweene this and Patenaw are diuers theeues, like the Arabians, without certaine abode. Patenaw was sometime a kingdome, now subiect to the Mogore. The women here are so decked with siluer and copper, that it is strange to see, and by reason of such rings vpon their toes, they can weare no shooes. Heere I saw a dissembling Prophet which sate vpon an horse in the market-place, and made as though he slept, and many of the people came and touched his feete with their hands, and then kissed their hands. They tooke him for a great man, but I saw he was a lazie lubber: and there I left him sleeping. The people here are great praters & dissemblers. As I came from Agra down the riuer Iemena, I saw also many naked beggets, of which the people make great ac∣count; they call them Schesche. Heere I saw one, which was a monster among the rest, wearing nothing on him, with a long beard, the haire of his head couering his pri∣uities. The nailes of some of his fingers were two inches long: for hee would cut no∣thing from him A right nig∣gard.. Neither would he speake, but was accompanied with eight or ten which spake for him. When any man spake to him, hee would lay his hand vpon his breast, and bow himselfe, but speake he would not to the King. In those parts they had many strange ceremonies. Their Bramans or Priests come to the water, and haue a string about their neckes made with great ceremonies, and lade vp water with both their hands, and turne the string first with their armes within, and then one arme after the other out. Heere also about Iemena, the Gentiles will eate no flesh, nor kill any thing. They pray in the water naked, and dresse their meat and eate it naked: and for their penance they lie flat vpon the earth, and rise vp and turne themselues about thirtie or forty times, and vse to heaue vp their hands to the Sunne, and to kisse the earth, with their armes and legs stretched out along, their right leg being alwayes before the left. Euery time they lie downe, they score it with their fingers, to know when their stint is ended. The Bramanes marke themselues in the foreheads, cares, and throats, with a kinde of yellow geare which they grinde; euerie morning they doe it. And they haue some old men which go in the streets with a box of yellow powlder, and marke them which they meet on their heads and neckes. And their wiues doe come, ten, twenty and thirty together to the water side, singing, and there doe wash themselues, and vse their ceremonies, and marke themselues on the foreheads and faces, and carry some with them, and so depart singing. Their daugh∣ters be married, at, or before the age of ten yeares. The men may haue seuen wiues. They are a crafty people, worse then the Iewes. I went R. Fitch. from Bengala into the Countrey of Couche, which lieth fiue and twentie dayes iourney North-wards from Tanda. The King was a Gentile, named Suckel Counse: his Countrey is great, and lieth not farre from Cauchin-China. All the Countrey is set with canes made sharpe at both ends, and driuen into the earth; and they can let in the water, and drowne the Countrey knee-deepe. In time of war they poyson all the waters. The people haue eares which be maruellous great, of a span long, which they draw out in length by deuises when they be young. They are all Gentiles, and will kill nothing, They haue Hospitalls for sheepe, dogs, goates, cats, birds, and all other liuing creatures. When they be old and lame, they keep them till
they die. If a man catch or buy any quicke thing in other places, and bring it thither, they will giue him money for it, or other victualles, and keepe it in their Hospitalles, or let it goe. They will giue meate to the Antes. Their small mony is Almonds, which oftentimes they eate. We passed through the Countrey of Gouren, where we found but few villages, and almost all wildernesse, and sawe many buffes, swine, and deete: grasse longer then a man, and very many Tygers. Satagam is a faire Citie, for a city of Moores, and very plentifull. In Bengala such is the estimation of Ganges, that they will fetch of it a great way off, though they haue good water neere: & if they haue not sufficient to drinke, they will sprinkle a little on them, and then they are well. From Satagam I trauelled by the Countrey of the King of Tippaia, with whom the Mogore hath continuall warre. The Mogores, which be of the kingdome of Recon and Rame, be stronger then this King of Tippaia. Foure dayes iourney from Cou∣che is Botanter, and the citty Bettia: the King is called Dermaine the people are tall and strong: the Countrey great, three moneths iourney, and hath in i high moun∣taines, one of which a man may see, six dayes iourney off: Vpon these mountaines are people with eares of a span long; otherwise they account them Apes. Hither re∣sort many merchants out of China and Tartaria. From Charigan in Bengala I went to Bacola, the king whereof is a Gentile; thence to Senepare, and after, to Simer∣gan, where they will eate no flesh, nor kill no beast; and thence to Negrais in Pegu and Cosmin. Thus farre hath our Countrey-man led vs in the view of so many super∣stitions of these Bengalans: and their Northerly neighbours. The Bengalans Linschot. haue a tradition or fable amongst them, That this riuer commeth out of Paradise, which was proued by one of their kings, who sent men vp the stream till they came to a pleasant aire, still water, and fragrant earth, and could rowe no fur∣ther. Hence happly grew this conceit, That this water should wash away sinne, and that without it they cannot be saued. This riuer hath in it Crocodiles, which by wa∣ter are no lesse daungerous then the Tygers by land, and both will assault men in their shippes. There is also a little small beast, which by his barking maketh the Tiger to runne away. The king of Chandecan N. Pimenta. caused a Iesuite to rehease the Decalogue: who when he reproued those Indians for their polytheisme, worshipping so many Pagodes; He said, that they obserued them but as, among them, their Saints were worshipped: to whom how sauoury the Iesuites distinction of  and  was for his satisfaction, I leaue to the Readers iudgement. This king, and the others of Bacala and Arracan haue admitted the Iesuites into their Countries, and most of these Indian Nations. In that part of Botanter, which is next to Lahor and the Mogor, the people Hier relatio de reg Mogor. are white, and Gentiles. Their garments are close girt to them, that a wrinckle or pleit is not to be seene, which they neuer put off, no not when they sleepe, as long as they are able to hang on: their head-attire is like a sugar loafe, sharpe at the toppe. They neuer wash their hands, left, say they, so pure a creature should be defiled. They haue but one wife; and when they haue two or three children, they liue as brother and si∣ster. Widowers and widowes may not marry a second time. They haue no Idolles nor townes, nor king, in those parts of Bottanter. They haue their Soothsayers, which they aske counsell of. When any is dead, they resort vnto these Wisards, to knowe what is to be done with their dead. They search their Bookes; and as they say the word, they burne them, or bury them, or eate them, although they vsually feede not on mans flesh. They also vse dead mens skulls instead of dishes, as in Thebet we haue obserued the like custome. They are liberall Almes-giuers.
CHAP. VI. Of the Great Mogor. THe Great Mogor (according to Boterus) hath vnder his subiection se∣uen and fortie Kingdomes, which lye betweene Indus and Ganges on the East and West, and betwixt Imaus and the Ocean. He is called of the people the Great Mogor, for the same cause that the Ottoman-Turkes are called Great. The stile of him that was King 1595, & 1599. when the Iesuites imparted to vs these relations, was Mahumeth Zelabdi E∣hebar, King Mogor. His descent is from Tamerlan (worthily called Great) from whome he is reckoned the eight. His father was Emmanpada (as the Iesuites re∣port) which being driuen to great straits by the Parthians, or Tartars, was driuen to aske aid of the Sophi. or Persian King; which he obtained, with condition of submit∣ting himselfe to the Persian Religion. The Mogores speake the Turkish Language. The Empire of this Mogore is exceeding great, containing the Countries of Bengala, Cambaia, Mendao, and others, comprehended by some vnder the name of Industan. This Mendao is said to be tenne Leagues in circuit, and that it cost the Mogor twelue yeares siege. Agra and Fatipore are two Cities in his dominion, great, and full of peo∣ple, much exceeding London; and the hole space betweene is as a continuall popu∣lous Market. Many Kings he hath conquered, and many haue submitted themselues and their States voluntarily to his subiection. Twentie Gentile Kings are numbred Relat.de Reg. Mog. in his Court, which attend him, equalling the King of Calecut in power. Many others pay him tribute. Eleuen great Riuers runne through his dominions; Taphi, Harada, Chambel, Iamena, Ganges: The other six are Indus, or Schd (as they call it) and Ca∣tamul, Cebcha, Ray, Chenao, Rebth, tributaries to Indus. The whole Monarchie enui∣roneth nine hundred Leagues. King Echebar Of the great Mogor his pu∣issance, riches, and other qua∣lities Pierre du larric hath largely written l.4. de histoire des Indes Or.c.8 hath many Lords, each of which is to maintaine eight, tenne, twelue, or foureteene thousand horse in readines for the warre, besides Elephants, of which in the whole Kingdome are said to bee fiftie thousand. Himselfe can further bring of his owne into the Field fiftie thousand horse, & footmen innumerable. To those Lords he alloweth certain Prouinces for such militarie seruice: for he is Lord of all, nor hath any else possession of any thing, but at the will of the King. Once a yeare they appeare before the King, where they present a view of those their enioyned forces. Many millions of reuenue doe besides accrew vnto his coffers: yet his Port and Magnificence is not so great, as of many other Princes, either for Ap∣parrell, Diet, or the Maiestie of his Court-seruice. He cannot write or reade, but hea∣reth often the disputations of others, and Histories read before him, being of deepe iudgement, piercing wit, and wise fore-cast. In execution of Iustice hee is very disi∣gent, insomuch, that in the Citie where he resideth he heareth all causes himselfe, nei∣ther is any malefactor punished without his knowledge, himselfe giuing publike au∣dience tenne times euery day: for which purpose hee hath two wide Halls, and in them Royall Thrones, where he is attended with eight Counsellors, besides No∣taries. This King detesteth the Mahumetane Sect, which, as you heard, his father embra∣ced for his aduantage; and therefore hath ouerthrowne their Moschees in his King∣dome, conuerting them to Stables, and more trusteth and employeth the Gentiles in his affaires then the Moores: whereupon many of them rebelled against him, & stirred vp the Prince of Quabul, his brother, to take Armes: against whome Echebar opposed himselfe, and caused him to retire into his owne Countrie. It is vncertaine The vncer∣tainetie of his Religion. what Reli∣gion he is of, some affirming him to be a Moore, some a Gentile, some a Christian; some of a fourth Sect, and of none of the former. Indeede it appeareth that he wauereth, vncertaine which way of many to take, able to see the absurdities of the Arabian
and Gentile profession, and not able to beleeue the high mysteries of the Christian Faith, especially the Trinitie and Incarnation. He hath admitted the Iesuites there to preach, and would haue had them by miracle to haue proued those thinges to him, which they (elsewhere so much boasting of Miracles) wisely refused. For the deman∣ded, that the Mulla's, or Priests of the Mogores, and they, should by passing through the fire make tryall of their Faith. Hee hath many Bookes and Images, which the Christians there doe vse, and seemeth to haue great liking to them, vsing the same with great reuerence. But his Religion is the same (it seemeth) with that of Tamer∣lane his predecessour, to acknowledge one GOD, whome varietie of Sects and wor∣shippings should best content. He caused loan. Oranus. thirtie infants to be kept, as is said of Psammetichus King of Aegypt, setting certaine to watch and obserue, that neither their Nurses, nor any else, should speake vnto them, purposing to addict himselfe to that Religion which they should embrace, whose Language these infants, should speake; which accordingly came to passe. For as they spake no certaine Language, so is not he setled in any certaine Religion. He hath diuerse Idols sometime brought before him, among which is one of the Sunne, which early euery morning he worship∣peth. He worshipped also the Image of CHRIST, setting it on the Crowne of his head. He is addicted to a new Sect, as is said, wherein he hath his followers, which hold him for a Prophet. The profit, which they haue by his Gold, addicteth them to this new Prophet. Hier. Xauier. He professeth to worke miracles; by the water of his feet cu∣ring diseases. Many women make vowes vnto him, either to obtaine children, or to recouer the health of their children; which if they attaine, they bring him their vow∣ed deuotions, willingly of him receiued. Hee hath three sonnes; Sciec the eldest, which is honoured with the title Go, and called Sciecigio, that is, the Soule, or Per∣son, of Sciec: he much fauoureth the Iesuites: The second, Pahari; Dan, or Daniel is the youngest: Some call them by other names. His presents are exceeding, besides his Tributes and Customes: for in eight dayes space these gifts amounted to a million of Gold; man Pinner. and almost daily he is presented with the like, and especially in a feast which he celebrateth, called Nerosa, great gifts are offered: so that his Treasures occupie the next roome to those of China. Touching the Superstitions of this Kingdome, thus writeth Ioannes Oranus, in his Narration of this Kingdome. Narratio reg. Mogor. . Not farre from the Citie Tahor is an Idoll, resembling a woman, which they call Nazar Coto, framed with two heads, and six or seuen armes, and twelue or foureteene hands, one of which brandisheth a Speare, another a Club. Hereunto resort many Pilgrims to worship, and hereof they tell many miracles; as that many cut off their Tongues, which are againe restored whole vnto them, but re∣maine mute. Some thinke our breath to be our Soule. Some affirme, That all things are the same thing. Some, that GOD onely hath a being, other things are shadowes and apparances. Some thinke all things, and some, the round Circle of the world, and some, themselues to be GOD. Almost all doe hold the commigration of soules into the bodies of Beasts. They say the World shall last foure Ages, or Worlds, whereof three are past. The first lasted seuenteene Laches (euery Laches containeth a hundred thousand yeares) and 28000 yeares. Men in that World liued tenne thousand yeares, were of great stature of bodie, and great sinceritie of minde. Thrice in this space did GOD visibly appeare on the Earth: First in forme of a Fish, that he might bring out the Booke of the Law of Brama, which one Causacar had harled into the Sea: The se∣cond time in forme of a Snayle, that he might make the Earth drie and solid: Lastly, like a Hogge, to destroy one that said he was God, or as others of them as truely say, to recouer the Earth from the Sea, which had swallowed it. The second World lasted tenne Laches, and 92006 yeares, in which men were as tall as before, and liued a thousand yeares. GOD did appeare foure times: first, in a monstrous forme, the vpper part a Lyon, the lower a Woman, to represse the pride of one which gaue out himselfe for GOD: Secondly, like a poore Bramane, to punish a proud King, that would by a new-deuised Art flee into Heauen: The third time,
to be reuenged of another King, which had slaine a poore Religious man, he came in the likenesse of a man, named Parcaram; and lastly, like one Ram, the sonne of Gio∣orat, which had slaine Parcaram. The third World continued eight Laches, and foure thousand yeares, wherein men liued fiue hundred yeares; and GOD appeared twìce in humane likenesse. The fourth Age shall endure foure Laches, whereof are alreadie passed 4692 yeares. They say GOD will also appeare in this Age. Others imagine, that he hath alreadie appeared, and that Echebar is he. Some hold, That those tenne appearances were but creatures, which had receiued Diuine power. They themselues easily perceiue the vanitie of these Chimara's and monstrous opinions, but will not leaue them, least they should (at the same cast) loose their wealth and Super∣stition together. In this Countrie of the Mogor they haue R. Fitch. many fine Carts, carued and gilded, with two Wheeles, drawne with two little Bulls, about the bignesse of our great Dogges in England, and they will runne with any Horse, and carrie two or three men in one of those Carts. They are couered with Silke, or fine Cloth, and be in vse as our Coa∣ches in England. By the Letters of N. Pimenta o. Busa. 1600, it appeareth, that the Mogor had subdued three Indian Kings, of the Arabian Sect, Abdenagran, Idalcan, Massulapatan, and grew dreadfull to the puissant King of Narsinga, by the current of his Conquests, in that Chersonesus which trendeth to the South from Cambaia and Bengala, before mentioned. CHAP. VII. Of Cambaia, and the neighbouring Nations. CAmbaia is also called Guzarat Maginus. , containing in length, from the Riuer Bate to Circam, a Persian Region, fiue hundred myles of Sea-coast, being on other parts enuironed Mass.l.4. with the Kingdomes of Dulcinda and Sanga on the North; Mandao, on the East; on the West, Nauta∣cos, or the Gedrosians. The Sea and the Confines of Decan are the Southerly bounds. It hath in it, by estimation, threescore thousand Populations, or inhabited Places, watered with many streames, the chiefe whereof is Indus, which diuideth it in the middle, running from Caucasus, or Naugrocot, and af∣ter nine hundred myles iourney, with two nauigable mouthes disemboquing it selfe into the Ocean. This Countrey is very fertile, not yeelding to any other in India, in the fruites which the Earth and Trees bring forth, besides their store of Ele∣phants, Gemmes, Silke, Cotton, and such like. The people are of an Oliue-colour, and goe naked, except about their priuie parts. They eate no Flesh, but Rice, Milke, Barley, and other life-lesse creatures. The inhabitants are, for the most part. ∣tiles; and so were their Kings, vntill the Mahumetane Superstitions preuailed. There are Ioseph. Ind. Linsch.l.1.c.27. vp, within the Land, People called Risbuti, which are the naturall Nobles of this Kingdome, chased by the Moores to the Mountaines, whence they make often excursions and spoyles in the Countrey, and the Cambayans pay them tribute, that they might liue in peace. Their chiefe Sea-Townes are Daman, Bandora, Curate, Ravellum, Bazuinum; and within Land, Cambaia, Madabar, Campanel, Tanaa, &c. Cambaia hath bestowed the name on the whole Kingdome, which they call the Indian Cairo, for the excellencie thereof: it standeth three myles from Indus. The Tides here L. Vertom..4. encrease not, as with vs, at the full, but at the decrease of the Moone they are at the highest. It is not a hundred and threescore yeares since Macham, a Moore, expelled the Guzarat King.
This Machamut deserueth mention for one thing, wherein the Sunne hath scarce beheld his like. He so accustomed himselfe to poysons, that no day passed wherein he tooke not some: for else he him selfe had died, sayth Barbosa, as it fareth with Am∣sian, or Opium, the vse whereof killeth such as neuer tooke it, and the difuse, such as haue. And beyond that which we reade of Mithrodates in the like practise, his Na∣ture was transformed into so venomous a habit, that if he did meane to put any of his Nobles to death, he would cause them to be set naked before him, and chewing cer∣taine Fruits in his mouth, which they call Chofolos and Tambolos, with lime made of shells, by spitting vpon him in one halfe houre, depriued him of life: if a Flye sat vpon his hand, it would presently fall off dead. Neither was d. Barbosa. his loue to be preferred to his hatred, or with women was his dealing lesse deadly. For he had foure thousand Con∣cubines, of whome none liued to see a second Sunne, after he had carnally knowne them. His Mustaches (or haire of his vpper lippe) was so long, that he bound it vp on his head, as women do with a haire-lace; and his beard was white, reaching to his Waste. Euery day when he arose, and when he dined, fiftie Elephants were brought into the Pallace, to doe him reuerence on their knees, accompanied with Trumpets, and other Musicke. Caelins Rhodiginus Cael Rhod. l.11 c.13. mentions the like of a maid, thus nourished with poysons, her spittle (and other humours comming from her) being deadly: such also as lay with her carnally, presently dying. He cites out of Auicenna a like example of a man, whose nature, infected with a stronger venome, poysoned other venomous creatures, if any did bite him. And when a greater Serpent was brought for triall, he had by the biting thereof a two-dayes Feuer; but the Serpent died: The other did not harme him. Mamudius, the successor of King Machamut, was a great enemie to the Portu∣galls. Badurius succeeded in State and affection, and exceeded in greatnesse and am∣bition. He inuaded Moff. l.11. Mandao, and Sanga, where he besieged Citor, then gouerned by a warre-like woman, which not able to hold out longer against him, fledde, and left the people in forlorne plight, who in a desperate resolution (like Sardanapalus) hea∣ping vp their Treasures, set fire thereto, and then cast themselues therein. This fire continued three dayes, and consumed threescore and tenne thousand persons. Hence Badurius triumphantly marched against the Mogor, whome Maffaens calleth Miramudius, (it seemeth to be Echebars Grandfather, whome some Rel.reg Mog. call Baburxa, famous for his Indian victories) with an Armie of a hundred and fiftie thousand horse, whereof thirtie thousand were barded; and fiue hundred thousand footmen: of great Brazen Ordinance, a thousand; whereof foure Basiliskes were drawne (such was their weight) by so many hundred yokes of Oxen: with Shot and Powder he laded fiue hundred Waines, and as many with Gold and Siluer, to pay his souldiors. These Forces, with this prouision, might rend the Ayre with thunders, might make the Earth to shake with terrour, might drie and drinke vp Ri∣uers of water, might frame another fierie Element, of Arts inuention, but could not eyther terrifie the Mogor, or saue Badurius from a double ouerthrow, first at Doce∣ri, next at Mandoa, where the looseth his Tents and Treasures, and shauing his beard, fleeth disguised to Diu, in which, that the Portugalls might be engaged in the same Warre, he gaue them leaue to erect a Fortresse: A thing of such moment vnto them, that Iohn Botelius (confined before vnto India, for crimes obiected) thought, by being the first messenger thereof in Portugall, to purchase his libertie: whereof he might well be reputed worthie, who in a little Vessell, scarce eighteene foot long, and six wide, with vndaunted courage contemning that wide, long, & tem∣pestuous Ocean, arriued with his small companie, great newes, and greater admiration at Lisbone. Badurius after alteriug his minde, and therein entertaining a treacherous proiect against the Portugalls, coloured the same with kindnesse, and he (which feared all Cicer. Offic. men no lesse thē he was feared as guiltie to his own tyrannie, which somtime made Dionisins of a King a Barber, & now this, a King of others, & his own Cook, trusting no
man to dresse his meat) aduentured to visit the Portugall Viceroy in his shippes, pro∣fessing great friendship with great dissimulation, and by a meane Mariner, at his re∣turne, was slaine; whereupon the whole Island submitted it selfe to the Portugall yoke. And because we haue in this Chapter mentioned so many wonders, let this also haue place among (if not aboue) the rest, which presently happened Maff. Hist. Ind.l.11. Whiles the Portugals were busie in their buildings, a certaine Bengalan This same man appeared before Solyman the Turkish General, at the siege of Diu. Viag.divn Co∣mite Venetian. came to the Go∣uernour, which had liued, as he affirmed, three hundred thirtie fiue yeares. The olde men of the Countrey testified, That they had heard their ancestors speake of his great age, and himselfe had a sonne fourescore and tenne yeares old, and not at all booke∣learned, yet was a speaking Chronicle of those passed times. His teeth had sometimes fallen out, others growing in their places; and his beard, after it had beene very hoa∣rie, by degrees returned into his former blacknesse. About a hundred yeares before this time he had altered his Pagan Religion into the Arabian or Moorish. For this his miraculous age, the Sultans of Cambaia had allowed him a stipend to liue on, the continuance of which he now sought, and did obtaine of the Portugalls. Mamudius, Successour to Badurius, sought with all his forces to driue these new Lords out of Diu, as Solyman had done before, by a Nauie and Armie sent thither, but both in vaine: of which Warres, Damianus à Goes Dam. a Goes, op. Di.  bell, Camb. hath written diuers Commen∣taries. But this whole Countrey is now subiect to the Mogor. It was, in Alex∣anders time, peopled by the Massani, Sodrae, or Sabracae, Praestae, and Sangada, as Ortelins hath placed them, where Alexander (as in diuerse other places hee had done) erected a Citie of his owne name, called Alexandria. Daman, another Key of this Bay, and entrance of the Riuer Indus into the Sea, fell to the Portugalls share. The Land of Cambaia Linschot. is the fruitfullest in all India, which causeth great trafficke of Indians, Portugalls, Persians, Arabians, Armenians, &c. The Gzarates, or Cam∣baians, are the subtillest Marchants in all India. They haue Od. Barbosa. amongst them many Histories of Darius and Alexander, which sometime were Lords of this Indian Pro∣uince. The Portugalls Gotardus Ar∣thus Hist. India Orient.c.23. haue at diuerse times conquered diuerse of the chiefe Townes in this Kingdome, some whereof they keepe still. There are women in Diu, which by art dye their teeth blacke, esteeming themselues so much more beautifull, and therefore goe with their lippes open, to shew the blacknesse of their teeth. When a Cambayan dieth, they burne his bodie, and distribute the ashes vnto the foure Ele∣ments (of which man consisteth,) The wiues are burned with their husbands, being addressed thereunto in pompous attyre. Six Leagues from Decan is a Hill, out of which the Diamond is taken. This Hill is kept with a Garrison, and walled about. A little from Ciauli is an old Temple (suppo∣sed to be built by Alexander the Great) adorned with Imagerie, now the habitation of Battes. Beneath it is a Riuer so deepe, that none haue yet found the bottome. Garcius ab Horto thus writeth Gar, ab Horte Hist. Plant.l.a.c.28. , That about three hundred yeares before his time, a mightie King in the Kingdome of Dely, depriued the Gentiles of the Kingdome of Balaguate. At the same time the Moores dispossessed the Reisbuti of Cambaya. These Reisbuti in Cambaya (once the Naturall Lords) and the Venezaras and Clles, of like condition in Balaguate, to this day exercise Robberies in those parts: the Kingdome of Decan to these, and to the first the Kingdome of Cambaya, paying tribute, to be freed from the same. And the Kings suffer them, that they may share with them. The Kingdome of Dely is Northerly, subiect to Cold and Frosts, as in Europe. The Mo∣gores had possessed this Kingdome, but a certaine Bengalan (rebelling against his Master) slew him, vsurped his State, and by force of ware added this also to his Do∣minion; he was called Xaholam Xaholam, i. Lord of the world. . This King made his sisters sonne Daquem. his successor, who was much addicted to Foreiners: he diuided his Kingdome into twelue parts, or Prouinces, ouer which he set so many Captaines: Idalcam, from Angidaua to Ci∣farda: from thence to Negarona, Nizamaluco: Ouer Balaguate, or the vp-Hill Countrey (for Bala in the Persian Language signifieth the toppe, and Guate a Hill) Imadmaluco, and Catalmaluco, and Verid, &c.
These all rebelled, and captiued Daquem their King at Beder, the chiefe Citie of De∣can, and shared his Kingdome amongst themselues, and some Gentiles, partners in the conspiracie. They were all foreiners but Niza∣maluco. This and the other names, be∣fore-mentioned, were titles of honour giuen them, with their Offices, by the King, cor∣rupted by the vulgar in pronouncing. Idalcam is Adel-ham. Adel, in the Persian Language, signifieth Iustice; Ham is the Tartarian appellation, signifying a Prince, or King (which name might well be the Relikes of the Tartarian Conquests in those parts) so Adelham is, King of Iustice. Neza in the Persian (which Scaliger Ios.Scal.de Emend.temp.l.7. sayth is of like extent in the East, as Latine in the West) is a Launce: Maluco signifieth the King∣dome. Neza, or Nizamaluco, the Speare of Launce of the Kingdome. So Cota maluco the Tower of the Kingdome, Imadmaluco the Throne of the Kingdome, &c. Niza∣maluco is also called Nizamoxa: which Xa, or Seha, is a Persian title (signifying Ios.Scal.Can.Isag.l.3. as Monsiour in France, or Don in Spaine) and giuen by Ismael the Sophi, and Tamas his sonne, to all those Kings that would communicate in their Sect, which Nizamoxa onely yeelded to. Other of them made shew, but soone recanted. Thus farre Garcias. The Religion in Cambaia is partly Moorish, partly Heathenish. Vertomannus L.Veri.l.4. is author, that they worship not Idols, or Pagodes. Others report, That this way, and o∣thers, they are exceeding religiously deuoted. They obserue a strict kind of man. Pinner. fasting, which lasteth with some eight dayes, with others fifteene, twentie, or thirtie dayes: in all which space they cate not a bit; onely, when they thirst, drinke water. One could not see when to make an end of this his penance, till his left eye fell out of his head, as both had done before out of his heart. In Cambaia they had one Bramene in such reputation of holinesse and honour, that they would salute him before they medled with their worldly affaires. One affirmed to this Iesuite, That if his Bramene should commaund him to distribute all his goods to the poore, he would doe it, yea, he would lay downe his life at his commaund. On the eight day of Ianuarie An. Do.1595. in that Citie, were giuen in almes twentie thousand Pardawes (which is in value about a Flemish Dollar;) one man had giuen fiue thou∣sand thereof, another three thousand, another fifteene hundred. The cause was, be∣cause that day (as their Bramenes affirmed) the Sunne departed from Sur to Horte. Of their Pilgrimages is spoken before; some Eastward to Ganges; some Westward to Mecca, to wit, the Moores; not men alone, but women also: and because Mahomet hath forbidden all vnmarried women this holy iourney, they will marrie before they set forth, and dissolue the same Marriage againe, after their returne. Hereby they thinke to purchase merit with GOD. I went one day (sayth Pinnerus) to the publike Hospitall, which the Citizens of Cambaia had founded for all kindes of birds, to cure them in their sicknesse. Some Peacockes were there incurable, and therefore might haue beene expelled the Hospi∣tall. But (alacke for pitie of so rufull an accident) a Hawke had beene admitted thi∣ther for the cure of his lame legge, which being whole, he inhospitally slew many of these co-hospitall weaker Fowles, and was therefore expelled this Bird-Colledge by the Master thereof. For men they had not an Hospitall that were thus Hospitall to Fowles. They haue certaine Religious persons, called Verteas The Religi∣ous in Cam∣baia. , which liue in a Colledg together, and when I went to their house, they were about fiftie in number. They ware white Cloth, were bare-headed, and shauen; if that word might be applyed to them, who pull off their haire on their heads and faces, leauing only a little on their Crowne. They liue on almes, nor receiue they but the surplusage of the daily foode of him that giueth them. They are wiuelesse. The Orders of their Sect are written in a booke of the Guzarates writing. They drinke their water hote, not for Physicke, but deuotion, sup∣posing that the water hath a soule, which they should slay, if they dranke the same vnsodden. For the same cause they beare in their hands certaine little brushes, with which they sweepe the floore, before they sit downe, or walke, least they should kill the soule of some Worme, or other small Creature. I saw their Priour thus doing.
The Generall of this Order is said to haue an hundred thousand men vnder his ca∣nonicall obedience, and is newly chosen euery yeare. I saw amongst them little boyes, of eight or nine yeares old, resembling the countenances of Europe, rather then of In∣dia, by their parents consecrated to this Order. They had all in their mouth a cloath, foure fingers broad, let thorow both their eares in a hole, and brought backe againe thorow their eares. They would not shew me the cause; but I perceiued it was, lest some gnat or flie should enter thither, and so be slaine. They teach that the world was made many hundred thousand yeares agoe: and that GOD did then send three and twentie Apostles, and now hath sent the foure and twentieth in this third age, two thousand yeares since, from which time they haue had writing, which before they had not. The same Em. Pinner. Author in another Epistle saith, That the most of the Inhabitants of Cambaia are Bramenes. They eat no flesh, nor kill any thing, yea they redeeme beasts and birds maimed or sicke, and carry them to their hospitals to be cured. In Guzza∣rat he had seene many Gioghi, a religious order of Monkes, which yeeld to none in pe∣nance and pouertie. They goe naked in cold weather: they sleepe on dung-hils vpon an heap of ashes, with which they couer their head and face. I saw the place where one of these Gioghi kept in the middest of the Citie Amadeba, to whom, in conceit of ho∣linesse, resorted more numbers of people, then to the shores of Lisbone, at the returne of the Indian Fleet. This Gioghi was sent for by the Prince Sultan Morad, son of the Mogor, and refused to come, One ficritus re∣porteth the like of the Gymnoso∣phists. bidding that the Prince should come to him: it is e∣nough that I am holy, or a Saint to this end. Whereupon, the Prince caused him to be apprehended, and (being soundly whipped) to be banished. This people killeth not their kine, but nourisheth them as their mothers. I saw at Amadeba, when a cow was readie to die, they offered her fresh grasle, and draue the flies from her: and some of them gaue this attendance two or three daies after, till she was dead. A league and a halfe from this Citie, I saw a certaine Coemiterium or burying∣place, then which I had neuer seene a fairer sight, wherein had beene buried one Ca∣zis, the Master of a King of Guzarat, who had crected this Fabrike, and three other were buried in another Chappell. The whole worke and pauement was of Marble, containing three Iles: in one whereof, I told foure hundred and forty pillars, with their chapiters and bases of Corinthian worke, very royall and admirable. On one side was a lake, greater then the Rozzio at Lisbone; and that building was curiously framed with faire windowes, to looke into the lake. Linschoten Linsch.c.37. Andrea Corsali. affirmeth the same things of their Pythagorean errour, and addeth that they sometimes buy fowles or other beasts of the Portugals, which meant to haue dressed them, and let them flee or runne away. In the high-wayes also and woods they set pots with water, and cast corne or other graine vpon the ground, to feed the birds and beasts. And (to omit their charitable Hospitalls before mentioned) if they take a flea or a louse, they will not kill it, but put it in some hole or corner in the wall, and so let it goe: and you can doe them no greater iniury, then to kill it in their pre∣sence, which with all entreatie they will resist, as being a hainous sinne, to take away the life of that, to which GOD hath imparted both soule and bodie; and where words will not preuaile, they will offer money. They eat no Radishes, Onyons, Garlike, or any kinde of herbe, that hath red colour in it, nor egges, for they thinke there is bloud in them, They drinke not wine, nor vse vineger, but only water. They would rather starue, then eat with any, but their countrey-men: as it happened when I sailed from Goa to Cochin with them in a Portugall shippe, when they had spent all their store, the time falling out longer then they made account of; they would not once touch our meat. They wash themselues euery time they eate, or ease themselues, or make water. Vnder their haire they haue a starre vpon their foreheads, which they rub eue∣ry morning with a little white sanders tempered with water, and three or foure grains of Rice among it, which the Bramenes also doe as a superstitious ceremony of their law. They sit on the ground in their houses, vpon mattes or carpets, and so they eate, leauing their staues (which are piked and hooked) at the doore: for which cause the
heeles of their shooes are seldome pulled vp, to saue labour of vndoing them. The Moores Od. Barbosa. amongst them will sometimes abuse the superstition of these Cam∣bayans to their owne couetousnesse, bringing some Worme, Rat, or Sparrow, and threatning to kill the same, so to prouoke them to redeeme the life thereof at some high price. And likewise if a malefactor be condemned to death, they will purchase his life of the Magistrate, and sell him for a slaue. The Moores will sometimes make semblance, as if they would kill themselues, that these foolish Guzzarates may see them in like sort. They will goe out of the path, if they light on an Ant-hill, lest they might happily treade on some of them: they suppe by day-light, lest their candle∣light should occasion the death of some gnat or flie. And when they must needs vse a candle, they keepe it in a lanthorne for that cause. If lice doe much annoy them, they call to them certaine religious and holy men, after their account: and these Ob∣seruants The like low∣sie tricke is re∣ported in the Legend of S. Francis, and in the life of Igna∣tius, of one of the first Iesui∣ticall pillars, by Maffaeus. will take vpon them all those lice which the other can finde, and put them on their head, there to nourish them. But yet for all this lousie scruple, they sticke not at cousinage by false weights, measures and coyne, nor at vsury and lies. Some are said N.di Cont. to bee zealous in their Idoll-seruice; as to sacrifice their liues in their honor, by a diuine cutting off their heads: the Priest meane-while muttering his damned holinesse, for which they are accounted Saints. CHAP. VIII. Of the Indian Nations betwixt Cambaia and Malabar, and their Religions. THe mightie Riuers of Indus and Ganges paying their Fine to the Ledi of waters, the Ocean, almost vnder the very tropike of Cancer, doe (as it were) betwixt their watery armes present into that their Mothers bosome this large Chersonesiu; A Countrey, full of Kingdomes, riches, people, and (our duest taske) superstitious customes. As Italy is diuided by the Apennine, so is this by the hills which they call Gate, quite tho∣row to the Cape Comori, which not only haue entered league with many in-lets of the sea, to diuide the soile into many signories and kingdomes, but with the aire and Na∣tures higher officers, to dispense with the ordinarie orders, and stablished statutes of Nature, Gi. Bot. Ben. Maff.lib. 1. Linsch. I. 1.c.34. at the same time, vnder the same eleuation of the Sunne, diuiding to Sum∣mer and Winter their seasons and possessions. For whereas Cold is banished out of these Countries (except on the toppes of some hills) and altogether prohibited to ap∣proach so neere the Court and presence of the Sunne; and thefore their Winter and Summer is not reckoned by heate and cold, but by the fairenesse and foulensse of weather, which in those parts diuide the yeare by equall proportions: at the same time, when on the West-part of this Peninsula, betweene that rige of Moun∣taines and the Sea, it is after their appellation Summer, which is from September till Aprill, in which time it is alwayes cleare skie, without once (or very little) ray∣ning: on the other side the hills which they call the coast of Choromandell, it is their Winter; euery day and night yeelding abundance of raines, besides those terrible thunders, which both beginne and end their Winter. And from Aprill till Septem∣ber in a contra∣rie vicissitude; on the Westerne part is Winter, and on the Easterne Summer; in so much that in little more then twentie leagues iourney in some place, as where they crosse the hills to Saint Thoma, on the one side of the hill you ascend with a faire Summer, on the other you descend attended with a stormie Winter. The like, saith Linschoten, happeneth at the Cape Rosalgate, in Arabia, and in many other places of the East. Their Winter also is more fierce then ours, euery man prouiding against the same, as if he had a voyage of so many moneths to passe by sea, their shippes are brought
into harbour, their houses can scarce harbour the inhabitants against the violent stormes, which choake the Riuers with Sands, and make the Seas vnnauigable. I leaue the causes of these things to the further scanning of Philosophers: the effects and affects thereof are strange. The Sea roareth with a dreadfull noyse: the windes blow with a certaine course from thence: the people haue a melancholike season, which they passe away with play: In the Summer the winde bloweth from the Land, beginning at Midnight, and continuing till Noone, neuer blowing aboue tenne Leagues into the Sea, and presently after one of the clocke vntill midnight, the contra∣rie wind bloweth, keeping their set-times, whereby they make the Land temperate, the heat otherwise would be vnmeasurable. But this change commonly causeth dis∣eases, Fluxes, Feuers, Vomitings, in dangerous (and to very many, in deadly) manner, as appeareth at Goa, where, in the Kings Hospitall (which is onely for white men) there die fiue hundred in a yeare. Here you may see both the North and South Starres; and little difference or none is found in the length of day and night through∣out the yeare. Dely is the next Kingdome to Cambaia, now not the next, but the same; the moun∣taines which before diuided it, not prohibiting the Mogors forces to annexe it to his Crowne. Of it is spoken before in the Chapter of Cambaya, as also of Decan, which lyeth along the coast, betwixt the Riuers Bate and Aliga two hundred and fiftie miles. Here Gio-Rt.Ben. Garcias ab Horto, .2.c.28. Linschot. &c. was, as is said, sometimes a Moore King; who, leading a voluptuous and idle life, by his Captaines was dispossessed of his State: the one of these was called Idal∣can: whose seat royall is Visapore, who in the yeare 1572. incamped before Goa, which the Portugals had taken from him, with an armie of seuenty thousand foot, and fiue and thirtie thousand horse, two thousand Elephants, and two hundred and fiftie peeces of Artillery. The other was Nizzamalucco, which resideth in Danaget, and besieged Chaul, with not much lesse forces, against a captaine of the Venazary, which are a people that liue on spoile, as the Resbuti in Cambaia, the Belemi in Delly, Canara or Concam, seemeth to haue beene a part of Decan, but is possessed by the King of Narsinga, whose state is on the East side of the Mountaines: it hath in it the coast∣townes of Onor, Batticalla, Mayander and Mangalor, Linscho.lib.1.cap.27. famous for traffique, but e∣clipsed by the Portugals neighbourhood. In these parts sometimes raigned a Benga∣lan Prince, which diuided his state among his Captaines, which originally for the most part were slaues, that he might ease himselfe of the cares of Gouernment. And as hee imparted to them great places; so did he likewise honorable names, Vide supra.cap.7. calling one Idal∣cam, which signifieth the King of Iustice; another Nisamalucco, that is, the Speare of the Kingdome; another Cotamalucco, the strength of the Kingdome; another Ima∣demalucco, the pillar of the Kingdome; another Melique Verido, the keeper of the Kingdome, &c. But he that should haue beene the keeper of the Kingdome, was made the keeper of the King, whom these his slaues and officers by ioynt conspiracie had ta∣ken prisoner at Bider, his chfe towne; the Countrey of Decan falling to those two which are before named, and the rest to the rest. Goa Of Goa, reade Arthus histor. Ind.c. 25. & Linschot. is the seat of the Viceroy, and of the Arch-bishop, and of the Kings Counsell for the Indies, and the staple of all Indian commodities. It standeth in a little Iland, called Tizzarin, nine miles long, and three broad. Bardes on the North, and Sal∣zette, are both in like subiection to the Portugals; the King letting them to ferme, and employing the rents to the payment of the Arch-bishop, Cloysters, Priests, Viceroy, and other his officers. There dwell in this Towne of all Nations and Religions. The Gouernment is as in Portugal. Only publike vse of forren Religion is forbidden them: but in their houses priuately, or on the maine land, they may practise the same. The Portugalls many of them are married with Indian women, and their posteritie are called Mestics, and in the third degree, differ nothing in colour and fashion from naturall Indians. Of the Portugalls they reckon two sorts, married men, and soul∣diers, which is a generall name to all Bachellours, although they are at their own com∣mand. Of these are many Knights, and are called Canalhiero Pidalgo: for if a man doe any thing worth reckoning, presently his Captaine imparteth this honor to him;
whereof they much boast themselues, albeit that this Knight-hood had descended to Cookes boyes. Many of the Portugalls liue onely by their slaues. They vse great ce∣remonie or pride (which you will call it) in their behauiour: the particulars whereof let Linschoten Linschot.lib. 1.cap.28. 29. 30. 31. 32. , that there liued amongst them, teach you. Besides both Abassine and Armenian Christians, Iewes, and Moores, heere are ma∣ny Heathens. The Moores eate all things but swines flesh, and dying, are buried like the Iewes. The Heathens, as Deanijns, Guzarates, and Canarijns, are burnt to ashes, and some women aliue are buried with the Gentlemen or Bramenes, their husbands. Some will eat nothing that had life; some all but the flesh of Kine, or Buffles. Most of them pray to the Sunne and Moone: yet all acknowledge a GOD that made all things, and ruleth them, after this life rendering to all according to their workes. But they haue Pagodes, which are Images, cut and framed most vgly, and like monstrous Diuels, to whom they pray and offer: and to Saints which heere haue liued holy, and are now intercessours for them. The Diuell often answereth them out of those Images, to whom also they offer, that he should not hurt them. They present their Pagode (when a marriage is to be solemnized) with the Brides maiden-head; two of her nee∣rest kinswomen forcing her vpon the Iuory pinne, (leauing the bloud there for monu∣ment) of that diuellish Idoll; the husband herein applauding his happinesse. They haue for the most part a custome to pray vnto the first thing they meete withall in the morning, and all that day after they pray vnto it; be it Hogge, or any other thing. But if they first meete with a Crow (whereof there are great store) they will not for any thing stirre out againe that day, after so vnluckie a signe. They pray likewise to the new Moone, saluting her first appearance on their knees. They haue Iogos or Hermits reputed very holy: many Iuglers also and Witches, which shew diuellish tricke. They neuer goe forth without praying. Euery hill, cliffe, hole, or denne, hath his Pa∣godes in it, with their furnaces hard by them, and their cesternes alwaies full of water, with which euery one, that passeth by, washeth his feete, and then worshippeth and offereth Rice, Egges, or what else their deuotion will afford: which the Bramen eateth. When they are to goe to sea, they will feast their Pagode with trumpets, fires, and hangings, fourteene dayes before they set forth, to obtaine a good voyage: and as long after their returne: which they vse to doe in all their feasts, marriages child∣births, and their haruest and seed-seasons. CHAP. IX. Of the Indian Bramenes. THe Indian Heathens haue a custome, that no man may change his fa∣thers trade, but must succeed in the same, and marry a wife also of the same Tribe. The Brachmanui, or, as they are at this day called, the Bramenes (who haue their shoppes, as well as other Merchants, throughout the Cities) are of best reputation, and weare in signe of their profession (from the shoulder crosse vnder the arme, vpon their naked bodie, downe to the girdle) three strings like sealing threeds: which for their liues they will not, nor may by their vow put off. They are naked, sauing that about their middles, they haue a cloath bound to hide their priuities. And sometime when they goe abroad, they cast a thinne gowne ouer them. Vpon their heads they weare a white cloath, wound twice or thrice about therewith, to hide their haire, which they neuer cut off, but weare it long, and turned vp as the women doe. They haue common∣ly hanging at their eares, gold-rings. They are very subtill in writing and accounts, making other simple Indians beleeue what they will. Whatsoeuer they meet first with in the streets, they pray to all day after.
When the Bramenes die, Ceremonies at the death of a Bramene. all their friends assemble together, and make a hole in the ground, in which they throw much sweet wood, spices, rice, corne, and oyle. Then lay they therein the dead bodie: his wife followeth with musicke, and many of her neerest friends, singing praises in commendation of her husbands life, encoura∣ging her to follow him, which accordingly shee doth. For, parting her Iewels a∣mong her friends, with a cheerefull countenance shee leapes into the fire, and is pre∣sently couered with wood and oyle, whereby she is quickely dead, and with her hus∣bands bodie burned to ashes. And if it chanceth (which is seldome) that any woman resueth this fiery coniunction they cut the haire cleane off from her head, neither may she after that weare Iewell, but is accounted a dishonest woman. This custome is (as may appeare) very ancient, and supposed to haue beene ordained, because of the libi∣dinous disposition of the Indian women, which for their lusts would often poison their husbands. The Bramenes obserue fasting-dayes with so great abstinence, that they eate no∣thing that day, and sometime not in three or foure dayes together. They tell many miracles of their Pagodes. They hold the immortalitie of the soule, both of beasts and men, and that so often mentioned Pythagorean succession, and renuing of mens soules, in beasts; and contrariwise. They by the direction of the Diuell (the author of their miracles) frame such deformed statues to their Idols. The Indian women in Goa, when they goe forth, haue but one cloath about their bodies, which couereth their heads, and hangeth downe to the knees, otherwise na∣ked. They haue rings thorow their noses, about their legges, toes, neckes, and armes, and seuen or eight bracelets vpon their hands (according to their abilitie) of glasse or other mettall. When the woman is seuen yeares old, and the man nine, they marrie, but come not together till the woman is able to beare children. Master Fitch mentioneth R. Fitch. the solemnitie of these marriages, & the cause, to be the burning of the mother when the father is dead, that they might haue a father-in-law to bring them vp. To leaue Goa with this Iland. The Canaras and Decanijns weare their beards and haire long, without cutting, as the Bramenes. They except from food Kine, Hogges, and Buffles. They account the Oxe, Cow, or Buffle to bee holy, which they haue commonly in the house with them, and they besmeere, stroke and handle them with all friendshippe in the world; feede them with the same meate they eate themselues; and when the beasts ease themselues, they hold vnder their hands, and throw the dung away: they sleepe with them in their houses, hereby thinking to doe GOD seruice. In other things they are as the Bramenes. For those are the Laitie; these are the Spiritualtie. When they take their oathes, they are set within a circle of ashes, on the pauement, and laying a few ashes on their head, the other on their breasts, sweare by their Pagodes to tell the truth. The Canarijs and the Corumbijns are the rustickes, and countrey-husbandmen, the most miserable people of all India: their religion is much as the other. They co∣uer onely their priuities, and eate all things except Kine, Oxen, Buffles, Hogges, and Hennes flesh. Their women bind a cloath about their nauell, which reacheth halfe∣way the thigh: they are deliuered alone by themselues, without other helpe: their children are brought vp naked, till they be seuen or eight yeares old, without any trouble about them, except washing them in a little cold water, and liue to bee an hundred yeares old, without head-ache, or losse of teeth. They nourish a tuffe of haire on their crownes, cutting the rest. When the man is dead, the wife breaketh her glasse-iewels, and cutteth off her haire; his bodie is burnt. They eate so little, as if they liued by the aire: and for a peny would endure whipping. In Salsette are two Temples, or holes rather of Pagodes, renowned in all India: one of which is cut from vnder a hill, of hard stone, and is of compasse within, about the bignes of a Village of foure hundred houses: with many galleries or chambers of these deformed shapes, one higher then another, cut out of the hard rocke. There are in all three hundred of these galleries. The other is in another place, of like matter & forme. It would make a mans haire stand vpright to enter amongst them. In a little Iland cal∣led
Pory, there standeth a high hill, on the top whereof is a hole, that goeth downe in∣to the hill, digged and carued out of the hard rocke; within, as large as a great cloister, round beset with shapes of Elephants, Tigers, Amazons, and other like, workemanly cut, supposed to be the Chinois handy-worke. But the Portugalls haue now ouer∣throwne these Idoll-Temples. Would GOD they had not set new Idols in the roome; with like practise of offerings and pilgrimages, as did these to their Pagodes. I once Linschoten. went into a Temple of stone, in a Village, & found nothing in it, but a great table that hung in the middle of the Church, with the image of a Pagode thereon pain∣ted, hellishly disfigured with many hornes, long teeth out of the mouth downe to the knees, and beneath his nauell with such another tusked & horned face. Vpon the head stood a triple crowne, not much vnlike the Popes. It hung before a wall, which made a partition from another chamber, like a quier, close without any light: in the middle wherof was a little doore, and on each side of it a furnace within the wall, with certaine holes thereby to let the smoake or sauour of the fire to enter into that place, when any offering should be made. Whereof we found there some, Rice, Corne, Fruits, Hens, and such like. There issued thence such a filthy smoke, & stink, that it made the place black, and almost choked such as entred. We desired the Bramene to open the doore, which with much intreaty he did, offering first to throw ashes on our foreheads, which we re∣fused, so that before he would open vs the doore, we were forced to promise him not to enter beyond the doore. It shewed within like a lime-kill, being close vaulted, without hole of window: neither had the Church it selfe any light but the doore. Within the said Cell hung an hundred burning lampes, and in the middle stood a little Altar coue∣red with cotton cloth, and ouer that with gold; vnder which, as the Bramene told vs, sate the Pagode all of gold, of the bignes of a Puppet. Hard by the Church without the great doore, stood within the earth a great foure∣square cisterne, hewed out of free stone, with staires on each side to go downe into it, full of greene, filthy, & stinking water, wherein they wash themselues, when they meane to enter into the Church to pray. In the euening, they carried their Pagode on Proces∣sion, first ringing a bell, wherewith the people assembled, and tooke the Pagode out of his Cell with great reuerence, and set it in a Palamkin, which was borne by the chiefe men of the Towne; the rest following with great deuotion, with their vsuall noise and sound of trumpets, & other instruments; & hauing caried him a pretty circuit, brought him to the stone-cisterne, washed him, & placed him againe in his Cell, making a foule smoke and stinke, and euery man leauing his offering behind him, intended to the Pa∣gode, but consumed by the Bramene and his family. As we went along by the waies, we found many such shapes vnder certaine couertures, with a small cisterne of water hard by, and halfe an Indian nut hanging thereby, to take vp water withall, for the trauellers to wash and pray. By the said Pagodes doe stand commonly a Calfe of stone, and two little furnaces; before which they present their offerings. My fellow leaping on one of those Calues in the Church, the Bramene called out, and the people came running, but we staied their furie by gentle perswasion of the Bramene before. And thus much of these deformed formes, and mishapen shapes, with their worshippings and worship∣pers sutable. Like lips, like lettice. Vaine Rites, stinking sinkes and smokes, vgly Idols, conspiring with internall Darknes of the mindes, and externall Darknes of their Tem∣ples; to bring an eternall Darknes to the followers, that all may shut vp (as they are begunne) in a hellish period. Botero saith, The Bramenes also worship Gi.Bot.Ben.lib.2.part.3.Maff.lib.1. one Parabramma, and his three sons, and in honor of them weare those three threeds afore-said. Hee affirmeth, that the Ioghi wander vp and downe through India, abstaining from all carnall pleasure, but a certaine time; which being expired, they are past possibilitie of further sinning, and are then called Abduti, as the illuminate Elders of the Familists, polluting themselues in all filthines. The Bramenes Od. Barbosa. haue Images of the Trinity and haue in religious estimation the number of Three. They acknowledge and pray to the Trinity in Vnity: but affirme many Demi-gods, which are his Deputies in gouerning the world. They honour the Portugalls Images also, as approaching to their owne superstition. They marry but one
wife, and admit no second succeeding marriage. The Bramenes must descend of the Bra∣mene Tribe, and others cannot aspire to that Priesthood: but some are of higher account then others: For some serue for messengers, which in time of war, & among theeues may passe safely, & are called Fathers. They will not put a Bramene to death for any crime. When they are seuen yeeres old Od. Barbosa. they put about their necke, a string two fingers broad made of the skin of a beast called Cressuamengan, like a wilde Asle, together with the haire: which he weareth till he is foure yeares old, all which time he may not cate Betelle, a leafe. Be∣telle. That time expired, the said string is taken away, and another of three threds put on, in signe that he is become a Bramen, which he weareth all his life. They haue a principall amongst them, which is their Bishop, which correcteth them, if they doe amisse. They marry but once, as is said, and that not all, but onely the eldest of the Brethren, to conti∣nu the succession, who is also heyre of the fathers substance, and keepeth his Wife streitly, killing her, if he finde her Adulterous, with poison. The yonger brethren lie with other mens wiues, which account the same as a singular honour done vnto them. They haue great reuenues belonging to their churches, besides offerings, and at set houres of the day resort thither to sing and doe other their holy rites. Twice in the day, and as of∣ten in the night, their Pagode is taken out of the Altar, and set on the Bramenes head, looking, backward, and is carried in procession three times about the Church, the Bra∣menes wiues carrying lights burning: euery time they come to the principall doore of the Church, which is on the West side thereof (some churches haue two doores beside) they set it downe on their offering-stone, and worship it. Twice a day they bring it to eate of their sod Rice, as often (it seemeth) as the Bramene is hungry. When they wash them (which is often) they lay a little ashes on their heads, foreheads, and breasts, saying that they shall returne into ashes. When the Bramenes wife is with child, as soone as he knoweth it, he clenseth his teeth, and abstaineth from Betelle, and obserueth fasting till she be deliuered. The Kings of Malabar will scarse eate meate but of their dressing. Sumario di pop orient. They are of such estimation, that it Marchants trauell among theeues, and robbers, one Bramene in the company secureth them all, which Bramene will eate nothing of an other mans dressing: and would not become a More for a Kingdome. Ni.di Conti saith Nic.di Conti. he saw a Bramene three hundred yeares old: hee addeth, that they are studious in A∣strologie, Geomancie, and Philosophy. To be short, they are the Masters of Ceremonies and the Indian Religion, in whose Precepts the Kings are trained vp. Besides these Mas.l.1 se∣cular Bramenes, there are other Regular, as those Ioghi and Vertae: of which wee haue spoken. There are also some that liue as Heremites in Deserts: some in Colledges: some wander from place to place begging: Some (an vnlearned kinde) are called Sanasses: Nic.Pimenta Some, contrarie to the rest, nothing esteeme Idols, obserue Chastitie twenty or fiue and twenty yeares, and feede daily on the Pith of a fruit called Caruza, to preserue in them that cold humour, neither doe they abstaine from Flesh, Fish, or Wine, and when they passe along the way, one goeth before them crying Poo Poo, that is, way, way: yea, the King himselfe honoureth them; and not they, the King: Some liue, enclosed in iron Cages all filthy with Ashes which they strew on their heads and garments: some burne some part of their body voluntarily: All are vaine-glorious, and seeke rather the shell then the Kernell, the shew then the substance of holines. I haue thought good to say thus much together of them, as in one view representing the Bramenes; a name so aunciently, so vniuersally communicated to the Indian Priests, although some par∣ticulars before haue beene, or hereafter may bee said touching some of them in other places, according to the singularitie of each Nation in this so manifold a profession.
CHAP. X. Of the Regions and Religions of Malabar. MAlabar extendeth it selfe Maginu. from the Riuer Cangeracon to the Cape Comori; which some take to bee the Promontory Cory, in Ptolomey: Maginus doubteth whether it be that which hee calleth Commaria extrema. Piol.l.7. ca. 1. In the length it containeth little lesse then three hundred miles, in bredth from that ridge of Gate to the Sea, in some places, fiftie. It is full of people, diuided into many states, by varietie of Ri∣uers, which cause horses to be vnseruiceable in their Warres, and nourish many Cro∣codiles, enrich the soile, and yeeld easie transportation of commodities, which are spi∣ces of diuers kindes. They haue Batts, in shape resembling Foxes, in bignes, Kytes. The chiefe kingdomes in this Tract are Kanoor, Calecut, Cranganor, Cochin, Carcolam, and Tranancon. About Lop. Castaneda L.1. Od. Barbosa. G. Bot Ben. Linscot. G. Arthus hist. c.26.27. & seq. seuen hundred yeares since it was one kingdome, gouerned by Scma, or Sarama Perimal, who by perswasion of the Arabian Marchants became of their Sect, in which he proued so deuout, that hee would end his daies at Mecca. But before his departure hee diuided his estate into these petty Signories, among his principall Nobles and kindred: leauing vnto Coulam the spirituall preheminence, and the Imperiall Title vnto his Nephew of Calicut, who onely enioyed the Title of Zamori or Emperour, and had prerogatiue of stamping Come. Some exempt from this Zamoria Empire and Allegeance, both Coulam, the papall Sea of the High Bra∣mene, and Cananor: and some haue since by their owne force exempted themselues. This Perimal died in his holy voyage: and the Indians of Malabar reckon from this diuision their Computation of yeares, as wee doe from the blessed Natiuitie of our LORD. Hee left (saith Castaneda) to himselfe but twelue leagues of his coun∣try, which lay neere to the shore where hee meant to imbarke himselfe, neuer before inhabited: this hee gaue to a Cousin of his then his Page, commanding, that in me∣mory of his imbaking there it should bee inhabited, commanding the rest to take him for their Emperour (except the Kings of Coulan and Cananor) whom yet with the rest hee commanded not to Coine money, but onely the King of Calacut. For Calecut was therefore here built: and the Mores for the imbarking tooke such de∣uotion to the place, that they would no more frequent the Port of Coulan, as be∣fore (which therefore grew to ruine) but made Calicut the staple of their Marchan∣dise. Calicut, the first in order with them, shall bee so with vs. The Citie is not walled nor faire built, the ground not yeelding firme foundation, by reason of the water which issueth if it bee digged. This Kingdome hath not aboue fiue and twenty leagues of Sea-coast, yet rich both by the fertilitie of the soile, which yeeldeth corne, spices, Co∣cos, Iaceros, and many other Fruits: and by the situation; as the Staple, especially be∣fore the Portugales vnfriendly neighbourhood, of Indian Merchandise, and therefore in her varietie of Marchants beeing a Mappe (as it were) of all that Easterne vvorld. The losephus Indus Aegyptians, Persians, Syrians, Arabians, Indians, yea, euen from Catay the space of six thousand miles iourney, here had their trade and traffique. The Pallace also contained foure halles of Audience, according to their Religions, for the Indians, Mores, Iewes, Christians. Of their Bramenes or Priestes wee haue al∣ready said. They yeeld Diuine honours to diuers of their deceased Saints, and (dedicated to an Ae) hath large por∣ches, and hath (saith Maffaus) seuen hundred Marble Pillars, not interiour to of Agrippa in the Romane Panthcon. It seemeth that the ground in that place is not of so queasie and waterie a stomach, but that it can digest deepe foundations. To Elephants they attribute like Diuinitie: but most of all to Kine, supposing
that the soules of men departed doe most of all enter into these beasts. They haue ma∣ny bookes of their superstition approching to the Auguril discipline of the He∣ans, and fond Fables of the Graecians: and diligently conceale the same from vul∣gar knowledge, except some Bramene Proselyte doe detect those Mysteries. They beleeue One GOD Maker of Heauen and Earth, but adde that hee could haue no pleasure in so weightie a charge of gouerning the World, and therefore hath de∣legated the same to the Diuell to reward euery man according to his workes; him they call Deumo: they name God Tamerani. Lud.vert.l.5.c.2. The King hath in his Palace the Chap∣pell of Deumo, carued full of Deuils, and in the middest fiteth this Image of met∣all in a Throne of the same matter, with a triple crowne like the Popes, and foure hornes, with teeth, eyes, and mouth wide and terrible, with hooked hands, and feete like a Cocke. In each corner of this square Chappell is a Diuell set in a fietie Throne, wherein are many soules, the Diuell putting one with his right hand into his mouth, and taking another from vnder him with his left hand. This Idoll is washed by the Bramenes with sweet water, incensed and worshipped euery mor∣ning. Sometime in the weeke they sacrifice on this manner. They haue an Altar strewed with Flowers, on which they put the bloud of a Cocke, and coales of fire in a Siluer Chafingdish, with much persumes, incensing about the Altar, and often tinging with a little Bell of Siluer. They hold in their hands a siluer knife, with which the Cocke was killed, which they dippe in the bloud, and put into the fire with many Apish gestures. All the bloud is thus burned, many Waxe-candles bur∣ning meane-while. The Priest hath on his wrists and legges as it were Morrice-Bels at his necke: and when hee hath ended his Sacrifice, hee taketh his hands full of Wheate, goeth ackewar from the Altar (on vvhich hee alwaies sixeth his eyes) to a certaine tree, and then urleth the Corne vp ouer his head as high as hee can: after vvhich hee returneth and vnfurnisheth the Altar. The King of Calicut eateth no meate, before foure prin∣cipall Bramenes haue first offered thereof to the Deuill, which they doe lifting both their hands ouer their heads, and shutting their fists draw backe the same with their thumbe, presenting of that meate to the Idol, and then carry it to the King on a great Leafe, in a treene platter. The King fitteth on the ground at his meate, vvithout any thing vnder him, attended with Bramenes, standing foure paces off, with their hands before their mouthes in great reuerence. And after the King hath eaten those Priests carry the reliques into the Court, where they clap thrice with their hands, whereat presently certaine Crowes resort thither to eate the Kings leauings, which crowes are hereunto accustomed and may not be hurt of any. When the King marrieth a Wife, Castaneda and Barbosa saith, that she is not married but as his Concubin one of the principall Bramenes hath the first rights lodging with her, for which hee hath assigned him by the King foure hundred, or fiue hundred ducats. The King and his Gentlemen, or Nairos, eate not flesh with∣out licence of the Bramenes. The King committeth the custodie of his Wife to the Bramenes, when hee trauelleth any whither, and taketh in too honest part their di∣shonest familiaritie. But for this cause, the Kings sonne succeedeth not in the crowne, but his Sisters sonne, as being certainly of his bloud. These sisters of the King chuse what Gentleman they please, on whom to bestow their Virginitie, and they proue not in a certaine time to bee with childe, they betake them to these Bramene-stalli∣ons. The Gentlemen and Marchants haue a custome to exchange wiues in token of great friendship. Some women amongst them haue six or seuen husbands, fathering her children on which of them she best pleaseth. If a debter breake day with his creditor, and often disappoint him, hee goeth to the principall of the Bramenes, and receiueth circle about him chargeth him in the name of the King, and the said Bramena, not to depart thence till ne hath satisfied the debt, which if he doe not, he must sterue in the place; for if hee depart, the King will cause him to bee executed. The new King for one yeares space cateth
neither Fish not Flesh, nor cutteth his Haire, or Nailes: vseth certaine prayers day∣ly, eateth but one meale, and that after he hath washed, neither may hee looke on any man till he hath ended his repast. Od.Barbosa. At the yeares end be maketh a great Feast, to which resort aboue ten thousand persons to confirme the Prince and his Officers: and then much almes is giuen. Hee entertaineth ten thousand women in diuers offices in his Pallace. These make to the King (after his fasting yeere is out) a Candlemasse-Feast, each of them carrying diuers lights from the Temple (where they first ob∣serue many Idoll and idle ceremonies) vnto the pallace with great musicke and other iollitie. . Babosa reckoneth eighteene Sects that haue no mutuall conuersation, nor may mar∣ry but in their owne rankes or order. Next to the king and Bramenes, hee placeth the Nayros, which are Gentlemen and Souldiours, and are not professed Nairos (not∣withstanding their-bloud) till they bee by their Lords or by the King made Knights or Souldiours. And then hee must neuer from that time goe without his weapons, which commonly are a Rapier and a Target, and sometimes Peeces or Bowes. They neuer marry, but lie with such of the Nairos Women or Daughters as like them, lea∣tng his weapons meane-while at the doore, which forbid any man else, although it be the good-man himselfe to enter, till hee hath ended his busines and bee gone. And if one of the common people once touch a Nairo, it is lawfull for the Nairo to kill him: and hee is also vncleane, and must bee purified by certaine washings. And for this cause they cry as they goe in the streetes, Po, Po, that the baser raskallity may giue place. They haue a pit of standing water at their doores hallowed by the Bra∣menes, wherein euery morning they wash themselues, although it be greene, smie, and stinking, imagining thus to bee clensed of their sinnes. They are brought vp al∣together to foates of Armes and actituitie from their Child-hood, admirably able to winde and turne themselues, and are very resolute and desperate, binding themselues by Oath to liue and die with their King or Lord. No Nairo's wo∣men may enter into Calicut but one Night in the yeare, vvhen the Citie is full of lights: and they goe vvith the Nairos, to behold and gaze their fill. They intend nothing but their lust, and thinke that if they die Virgins they shall neuer enter into Paradise. The Biabari are another sort, and are Merchants, Gentiles, and enioy great pri∣uiledges. The King cannot put them to death, but by sentence of the principall of themselues. They vvere the onely Machants before the Mores traded there, and still enioy many possessions. These marry one Wife, and their Children inherit, and they may touch the Nairo's. The Cugianem are a Sect of the Nairo's, hauing a law and Idols by themselues, which they may neuer alter. They make Tiles to couer the Temples and the Kings Palace. The Nairo's may lye with their women, but must wash themselues before they goe home. Another Sect is called Manantaar, which are Landerers, nor may they or their posteritie be of other function: nor may they mingle themselues with any other gene∣ration. They haue Idol-ceremonies and temples by themselues. The Nairos may vse their wiues (or women rather.) Their brethren or Nephewes are their heires. The Calien are Weauers, and haue a distinct idolatrous Sect; otherwise are as the former. Besides these of better condition, there are of baser sort eleuen Sects, which may not marry nor meddle with others. The first of these are called Tiberi, hus∣bandmen; the second, Moger, and are Marriners; both hauing their proper supersti∣tions, and vse their women in common. The third, are Astrologers, whom they call Caniun. Great men aske their counsell, but may not touch their persons. The Aggeri are Masons and workers in metalls. The Muchoa or Mechoe are Fishers; dwel∣ling in Villages by themselues; the men, theeues, the women Harlots, with whom they please. The Betua are Salt-makers: The Paerun are Iugglers, Inchanters, and Phy∣sicians (if such damnable deuillish practises may deserue so honourable name.) which, when any are sicke and require their helpe, vse coniuration to cause the Diuell to enter
into some of them, and then by his suggestion declare the euent of the disease, and what sacrifices or other things are to bee performed. They may not touch or bee touched of other men. The Reuolet are a baser sort of Gentiles, vvhich carry wood into the Citie to sell, and Hearbes. The Puler are as Excommunicate per∣sons, and liue in desert places, where the Nairos haue no occasion to passe, and when they goe neere any these Nairos, or any of the better sort, they crie as loude as they can (as Lu.13.45. the Lepers among the Iewes) that others may auoide them. For if any touch them, their kindro may for such action or passion slay them, and as many of these Puler also, as may make satisfaction for such disparagement. Some nights they will goe of purpose, seeking to touch some of the Nairo-wo∣men with hand, sticke, or hurling of a stone: vvhich if they effect, there is no re∣medie for the vvoman but to get her forth and liue with these Villaines, or to bee solde, to escape killing by the hands of her kindred. These Puler are Theeues and Sorcerers. The Pareas are of worse esteeme, and liue in Deserts vvith∣out commerce of any, reputed worse then the Diuell. These tenne sorts (or ele∣uen if you reckon two sorts of the Tiberi, as our Authour doth; whereof one are warriours, distinguished by a certaine cudgell, which they must carry in their hands, from the Nairos) are as well differing in Religions, as matters of common life: though, for their seuerall rites, it vvere wrong to the Reader at large to recite them, if we had the particulars to deliuer. There are besides these Gentils, Naturall of Malabar, many strangers of In∣dians, Mores, and Christians. But in other Kingdomes of Malabar, the heathenish Religion is little differing from that in Calicut. I. op.de Casta∣nedo. G.B.B. Generally amongst them, the Bramenes and Kine are had in such honour, that when the Kings create their Nairos, he girdeth them with a sword, and embracing them one by one, bids them haue care of the Bra∣menes and the Kine. Cranganor is a small Kingdome: the Inhabitants of the Citie, which giueth name to the Region, are Christiana of Saint Thomas prosession, about seuentie thousand in number. Cochin is now growne great by the Portugales traffique and friendship. Of the rest there is not much worth recitall. The Papall Maglnus. honour among the Bramenes, which some ascribe to Coulam, Maginus bestoweth on the King of Cochin. In these parts are now many Christian proselytes of the Iesuites conuersion, besides many of the old Thomas-Christians. The King of Coulams Dominion Od. Dar. stretcheth beyond the Cape Comori (where Malabar endeth) on the East side fourescore and ten miles, as farre as Cael: which di∣uers great Lords hold vnder him. Among the rest is the Signiorie of Quilacare. In the Citie of Quilacare is an Idoll of high account, to which they solemnize a Feast eue∣rie twelfth yeere, where the Gentiles resort as the Popish Christians in the Romish Iubilee. The Temple sacred to this Idoll hath exceeding great reuenue. The King (for so he is called) at this Feast erecteth a Scaffold couered with silke, and hauing wa∣shed himselfe with great solemnitie, hee prayeth before this Idoll: and then as∣cendeth the scaffold, and there in presence of all the people cutteth off his nose, and after that, his eares, lippes, and other parts, which hee castes towards the I∣doll, and at last hee cutteth his throate, making a butcherly sacrifice of himselfe to his Idoll. Hee that is to bee his successor must bee present hereat: for he must vn∣dergoe the same martyrdome, vvhen his twelue yeares Iubilee is come. Along this coast dwell the Paraui, simple people, and Christians, vvhich liue by fishing of Pearles. The Nairos make such holes in their eares, that Caesar Frederike Caes.Fred. saith he thrust his arme vp to the shoulders in one of them. They are prodigall in their liues in the honour of their King: Osorius Osorius. telleth of some, which, like the re∣nowmed Decij. had vowed themselues to death, and not to returne from the enemy without victorie. Besides those former Sects, Stephanus de Brito Step.de Brit. 1600. speaketh of the Maleas which inhabit small Villages in the mountaines, which are hunters of Elephants: amongst whom are no thefts or robberies, and therefore they leaue their doores open
when they goe abroad. They are skilfull in Musicke, and Magike. They haue no Idoll amongst them; onely they obserue their auncestors spulchers. Of the Feast which all the Malabar-kings hold euery twelfth yere in honour of the Riuer Ganges, wee haue there spoken Supra cap. 5. where we haue discoursed of the Riuer: This Feast lasteth eight and twenty or thirty daies with great solemnitie, to the furtherance whereof certaine souldiours; to the number of thritie; rush among the people, and kill as many as they can; themselues certaine to bee killed of the Kings Souldiors. This is the Tribute imposed by the King of Calecut on one of his vassals, to honour this so∣lemnitie with such a number that shall thus sell their liues as deare as they can. Of the Election and erection of the Zamoryn, we haue spoken in the beginning of the Chap∣ter: Let vs here adde out of Castaneda Hernan. opes de Castaneda. .1.c.14. concerning his deuotion. Hee saith that this King of Calycut is a Bramene, as his predecessors also. And for that it is a custome that all the Kings die in one Pagode or Idol. temple, he is elected for that cause. For alwaies there is and must be in that house a King to serue those Idols, and when he that serueth there, dieth, then must the King that then raigneth leaue his Empire, and goe serue in that place as the other did; another being elected to succeede him in the Kingdome. And if any refuseth to forsake his Court for the Pagode, they enforce him there∣vnto. The Kings of Malabar bee browne men, and goe naked from the Girdle vpward, and from thence downe ward they are couered with cloth of Silke and of Cotton, ador∣ned with Iewels. For their Children; the sonnes inherit not, but the brother, or if there bee none, the Sisters sonne. When their Daughters are ten yeares old, they send out of the Kingdome for a Nayro, and presenting him with giftes, request him to take her Virginitie: which hauing done, he tieth a Iewell about her necke, which shee weareth during her life, as a token that from thence-forth she hath free power of her body, to doe what she will, which before she might not. After their death Funerall Rices. these Kings are car∣ried forth into a plaine field, and there burned with sweet Wood, very costly, their kindred and all the Nobilitie of the country being present: which done, and the ashes buried, they shaue themselues, without leauing any haire except on the browes and eye-lids, euen on the least child; and for the space of thirteene daies cease to eate A lease, of which see Cap. 12. Betele (his lips are cut that doth it) and all that time is an Interregnum, wherein they obserue if any will come in to obiect any thing against the new future King. After this Inauguration of the new King. hee is sworne to the Lawes of his predecessor, to pay his debts, to recouer whatsoeuer be∣longed to his kingdome being lost, which oath hee taketh hauing his sword in his left hand, and in the right a Candle burning, which hath a ring of Gold vpon it, which hee toucheth with two of his fingers and taketh his oath. This being done, they throw or poure vpon him a few Graines of Rice, with many other ceremonies and prayers, and he worshippeth the Sunne three times: after which, all the Caymailes or principall No∣bles sweare their fealie to him, handling also the same Candle. The thirteene daies en∣ded, they eate their Betele againe, and flesh and fish as before; the King except, who then taketh thought for his predecessor, and for the space of one whole yeere (as is be∣fore obserued in part out of Barbosa) eates no Betele, nor shaueth his beard, nor cut∣teth his Nailes: eateth but once a day, and before he doth it, washeth all his body, and observeth certaine houres of prayer daily. The yeare being ended, he obserueth a kinde of Dirige for his predecessors soule, whereat are assembled a hundred thousand persons, at which time he giueth great Almes, and then is confirmed. All these Malabar-kings haue one especiall man, which is the cheefe administrator of Iustice, who in matters of gouernment is obeyed no lesse then the King himselfe. The Souldiors are Nayros, none of which can bee imprisoned or put to death by ordinarie iustice: but if one of them kill another, or else kill a Cowe, or sleepe with a Country-woman, or speake euill of the King; the King after information giues his warrant to another Nayro, who vvith his associates kill him wheresoeuer they finde him, hewing him with their swords, and then hang on him his warrant to testifie the cause of his death. These Nairos may not weare their weapons, or enter into combat, till they bee armed Knights, although that from the age of seuen yeares they are trained vp in feates and practise of Armes. Hee
The dub∣bing of the Nairo's. is dubbed or created by the King, who commandeth to gird him with a Sword, and laying his right hand vpon his head, muttreth certaine words softly, & afterward dub∣beth him, saying; Haue a regard to keep these Bramenes, and their Kine. When they yeeld themselues to any mans seruice, they binde themselues to die with him, and for him, which they faithfully performe, fighting till they be killed. They are great Soothsay∣ers, haue their good and bad dayes, worship the Sunne, the Moone, the Fire, and the Kine, and the first they meete in the morning. The Deuill is often in them (they say it is one of their Pagodes) which causeth them to vtter terrible words; and then he go∣eth before the king with a naked Sword, quaking, and cutting his flesh, saying with great cries; I am such a God, and I am come to tell thee such a thing; and if the king doubteth, he roareth lowder, and cutteth himselfe deeper till he be credited. The Por∣tugalls haue much eclipsed the greatnesse of the king of Calycu, and caused many o∣ther alterations in all the East in this last Age of the world. Of whose exploits Castane∣da, Barrius, Maffaeus, Osorius, and others haue written at large. CHAP. XI. Of the kingdome of Narsinga and Bisnagr. FRom those places where our feete last rested (or touched rather) vnto the Cape Guadauerin Magin. Gi. Boer. Be. betwixt that ridge of mountaines called Gates, and the Ocean (which is there named the Gulfe of Bengala) trendeth the kingdome of Narsinga or Bisnagar; those two royall Cities con∣tending which shal giue name to this mighty Empire, containing two hundred leagues of Sea-coast. The king hath in continuall pay fortie thousand Nairos. But as occasion serueth, hee can bring into the field many many thousands more, as in that Expedition against Idalcan specified by Barrius and Bote∣rus; in which, to let passe that world 700000.foot.40000 horse. 700.elephants. 20000. horlots. of people, hee sacrificed vnto Idolls twentie thousand seuen hundred and three score head of beasts and fowles in nine dayes space, which in Idoll-deuotion were all bestowed after on the poore. In the yeare of our LORD 1567. Biznagar C.Fred. was sacked by foure Kings of the Moores, (as saith Frederike) naming them Dialcan, Zamaluc, Cotamaluc and Vidy, through treason of her owne Captaines: but hauing sacked it (as not able to holde it) they retired home. The city remained after, an habitation for Tygers and wild beasts; containing in circuit foure and twenty miles, as our Author (that stayed there seuen moneths) affirmeth. Hee neüer sawe Pallace exceeding that of Bisnagar. It had nine gates, with guards of souldiers; Heere he obserued their rites in burning the women so often mentioned. The woman The solem∣nity of bur∣ning of the wife after her husbands death. taketh two or three moneths respite after her husbands death: the day being come, she goeth earely out of her house, mounted on an horse or elephant, or else on a stage carried by eight men: apparelled like to a Bride adorned with iew∣ells, and her haire about her shoulders; holding in her left hand a Looking-Glasse; in the right, an arrow: and singeth as shee passeth through the Citie, saying; That shee goeth to sleepe with her husband. Shee is accompanied with her friends, vntill it bee one or two of the clock in the afternoone: then they goe out of the citie passing by the riuers side to the burning-place, where is prepared a great square Caue full of wood. Heere is made a great banket, the woman eating with ioy, as if it were her wedding∣day, and after they sing and daunce till the woman bidde to kindle the fire in the caue; then she leaueth the Feast, and taketh her husbands neerest kinsman by the hand, and goeth with him to the banke of the riuer, where she strippeth her of her clothes and iewells, bestowing them at her pleasure, and couering her selfe with a cloth, throw∣eth her selfe into the riuer, saying; O wretches, wash away your sinnes. Comming out of the water, she rowleth her selfe into a yellow cloth; and againe, taking her husbands
kinsman by the hand, goeth to the said caue, by which is erected a little Pinnacle, on which she mounteth, and there recommendeth her children and kinred to the people. After this, another woman taketh a pot with oyle, and sprinckleth it ouer her head, and therewith annoynteth all her body, and then throweth it into the furnace, the wo∣man going together with the same. Presently after the woman the people throw great peeces of wood into the Caue, so that with those blowes, and the fire, shee is quickely dead: and their great mirth is on a sodaine turned into great lamentation and howling. When a great man dieth, both his wife and slaues with whom hee hath had carnall copulation, burne themselues together with him. Amongst the baser sort, I haue seene (saith Maister Frederike) the dead man carried to the place of buriall, and there set vp∣right: The wife immured with hir dead husband. the woman comming before him on her knees, casteth hir armes about his neck, while a Mason maketh a wall round about them: and when the wall is as high as their neckes; one comming behinde the woman, strangleth her, the workeman presently finishing the wall ouer them; and this is their buriall. Ludouicus Vertomannus Lud.Vert.li.6 relateth the same funerall rites of Tarnasseri (as in other parts of India) sauing that there fifteene or twenty men in their idolatrous habite, like Deuilles, doe attend on the fire wherein the husband is burned; all the Musicians of the citie solemnizing the funerall pompe: and fifteene days after they haue the like solemnity, at the burnign of the woman, those diuellish fellowes holding fire in their mouthes, and sacrificing to Deumo, and are her intercessors to that deuill for her good intertainement. The cause of burning the wiues is by some ascribed to their wonted poysonings of their husbands before this Law; Odricus. by others, that the husband might haue her helpe and comfort in the other world. In these parts is the City of Saint Thomas or Malepur, where they say Saint Tho∣mas (after he had preached the Gospel to the Indians) was martyred and burned. The Legend which some report of his death, were too tedious to recite: and as little like∣liehood of truth is in that long tale of the miraculous Crucifixes heere sound, related by Osorius, Osorius libr. 3. who likewise declareth the rites of those Saint Thomas-Christians, of their Chaldean Pope, Cardinalls, Patriarchs and Bishops; of which in an other place wee shall more fitly speake. On the first day of Iuly Saint Thomas holy-day is celebrated, aswel by the Pagans as Christians: and his Sepulchre is had in deuout estimation both of the Moores, Gentiles, & Christians; each Od. Barbosa. pretending the right of his own Religion to the Church, where this Saint lieth interred, to which the Indian Christians goe on pilgrimage, carrying with them a litle of that earth for a great relike. A Moore had the keeping of the Church, which was built after our fashion, and begged of the commers for maintenance of it, and of a Light continually burning therein. The Portugalls Liuschot. now inhabite this Towne almost desolate: the Iesuits also haue heere a residence. The Church-doores (by the superstition of some) are almost cut in peeces, and carried away to set in gold and siluer, and to weare about their neckes, as a holy relike; the Portugalles heerein being exceedingly vaine, and attributing here∣unto many miracles, verifying that Prouerb which the Spaniards vse, affirming the Portugals to be Deuout litle fooles. Pocos sotos devotos. One sent Linschoten a whole bead-roll or payre of Beads therof, the bringer affirming that those beads had calmed a tempest miracu∣lously by the way. The Inhabitants in this respect haue driuen their Church-doores full of nailes: but Saint Thomas bones are now remoued to Goa. Those doores are of such renowened holinesse, because they were made of that wood which Saint Tho∣mas drew with his girdle out of the hauen (which it choaked) and could not before be remoued Odoricus Odoricus telleth of a strange and vncouth Idoll, as bigge as Saint Christopher, or pure golde, with a new band about the necke full of precious stones, some one where∣of was of valew (if he valewed iustly) more then a whole kingdome: The roofe, paue∣ment, and seeling of the walles, within and without the Temple, was all gold. The Indians went thither on pilgrimage, some with halters about their neckes, some with
their hands bound behinde them, some with kniues sticking on their armes and legs; and if after their pilgrimage, the wounded flesh seftered, they esteemed that limbe holie, and a signe of their Gods fauour. Neere to the Temple was a lake whereinto he Pilgrimes cast golde, siluer, and gemmes for honour of the Idole, and reparation of his Temple. At euery yearely feast the King and Queene with the Pilgrimes and people assembling, placed the said Idoll in a rich Charriot, and with a solemne pro∣session of Virgins two and two in a rancke singing before him, and with musicall In∣struments carry him forth. Many Pilgrims put themselues vnder the charriot-wheels, where they are crushed in peeces. More then fiue hundred persons vsed thus to doe, whose carkasses were burned, and ashes kept for holie reliques. Otherwise also they will deuore themselues to such a martyrdome in this manner. The parents and friends assemble and make a feast to this Votary, and after that hang fiue sharpe kniues about his necke, and so carry him before the Idole, where he taketh one of his kniues, and crieth; For the worship of my God I cut this my flesh; and cutting a peece, casteth it at the face of the Idole, and so proceeding, at the last saith; Now doe I yeelde my selfe to death in the behalfe of my God; and being dead, is burned as before. Our Countrey-man S. Iohn Man∣d sir Iohn Mandeuile reporteth the same Historie of their Idoll Procession, and the ashes of those voluntary Martires, which they keepe to defend them against tempests and misfortunes. He also saith, that some Pilgrimes in all their peregrination, not once lifted vp their eye-liddes, some at euery third or fourth pace fell downe on their knees to worship, some whipped, others wounded themselues; yea, and killed themselues (as is before said.) Nicholao di Conti Nic di Conti. reporteth the same in his time. Neither is this bloudy custome yet lest, as Linscboten Linschat. libr.1.c2.44. affirmeth by report of one of his Chamber-fellowes that had seene it. They haue (saith hee) a waggon, or cart, so heauie, that three or foure Elephants can hardly draw it, which is brought forth at Faires, Feasts, and Processions. At this Cart hang many Cables or Ropes, whereat all the people hale and pull, of deuotion. In the vpper part of the Cart standeth a Ta∣bernacle, and therein the Idole: vnder it sit the Kings wiues playing on Instruments. And while the Procession passeth, some cut peeces of their flesh, and throw at the Pagode, some lay themselues vnder the wheeles of the cart, with such euent as you haue heard. Gaspro Balby relateth the same, and addeth, that the Priests, which haue care of this Idol, and certaine women, are conscrated to these deuotions from their Cradles by their zeale-blinde parents. Balhy ca. 28. & Arthus Dan. bist.Ind.O.c.1. And the women prostitute their bodies, to gaine for the Idole whatsoeuer they can get ouer and aboue their owne maintenance. This fil∣leth the Citie with strumpets; there being of this Sacred (you may interprete it Cur∣sed) crue, foure hundred in one place of the Citie. These haue their place in the Idol-Procession, some of them in the Charriot which is drawne by men; euerie one ac∣compting himselfe happy, that can touch or draw the same. This he saith was at Ne∣gapaton. He further affirmeth, that not farre from the Citie of Saint Thomas is the Towne Casta: where the wife is not burned (as at Negapatan) but a great graue being made for the deceased husband, they place the liuing wife by the dead corpse, and their neerest kindred cast earth vpon them both, and stampe thereon. They which marrie, wed in their owne degree, as a Smith to Smiths daughter; and they powre out their prayers at the Image of some Cowe, or a Serpent called Bittia di capella. Their Bra∣mine burne Cowes-doung; and if they intend any warres with other Nations, they annoynt their nose and forehead with those ashes, not washing themselues till the e∣uening. They which haue sacrificed themselues to the Pagode, when they haue wal∣ arrowes, and diuersly mangle themselues; at last, cutting their owne throats, so sa∣crificing themselues to the Pagode. There are also certaine people called Amouchi, otherwise Chiavi, which percei∣uing
the end of their life to Ociperate dying. approch, lay hold on their weapons, which they call Chisse and going forth, kill euery man they meete with, till some body (by killing them) make an end of their killing. They are loth (it seemes) to come into the deuills pre∣sence empty-handed, or to goe to Hell alone. Some of them worship GOD in the likenesse of a Man; some in the Images of Kine and Scrpents: some inuoke the Sunne and Moone; others, some Tree or Riuer. Among many Feasts which they celebrate in the yeare, one in Autumne is most so∣lemne, in which they take some great tree, and fasten it in the ground, hauing first fa∣shioned it like a mast of a ship, with a crosse-yard, whereon they hang two hooks of yron. And when any one by sicknes, or other misery, hath made a vow to their Idoll or Pagode, he commeth thither, & being first admonished by the Priests to offer his sa∣crifice, they lift him with those hooks by both the shoulders, and there hold him to the Idol, till he hath 3.times saluted the same, with clapping his folded hands to his breast, and hath made some sport thereto with weapons which he hath in his hand. After this he is let downe, and the bloud which issueth from his shoulders is sprinckled on the tree, in testimonie of his deuotion. Then they draw him vp againe by the middle, to giue thankes to the Idoll: and then giue him leaue to heale himselfe, if he can. They which are in great miserie, or seeke some great matter at the hand of their Idoll, doe this. They haue an other Feast, celebrated in the night, continuing eight nights: in which many candles are seene burning through the City. Three or foure runne from one end of the streete to the other, and hurling rice, and other meates after them, say, they offer it to the deuill which followes them; not daring to looke behinde, lest hee should slay them. In other places also they haue those idoll-chariots, like vnto Towers, to the draw∣ing whereof, many thousands of deuout persons put their helping-hand. Francis F.Fernandes epist. 1598. Fernandes saith, that Cidambaran is the mother-city of their Pagan-rites, wherein are many stately Temples, and the reuenue of the Bramenes amounted to thirty thou∣sand ducats, but now they are payd but twelue thousand yearely. Heere happened a strange accident, the same day the Iesuites departed, which was this. There is in this City a Temple of Perimal, wherein they worship an Ape called Hanimant, whom they report to haue beene a GOD, and (for I know not what) to∣gether with many thousands of other gods, to haue remained there, being all trans∣formed into Apes. Now when this principall Ape was forced to passe into the Iland Zeilan, and wanted a ship, he leaped, and at euery leape left an Iland or heape of land behinde him, so making way for his apish traine to Zeilan. The tooth of this Ape was kept for a great relique in that Iland with great resort of Pilgrimes thereunto: and in the yeare Linschot. c. 44. 1554. was by the Portugalls, (who made a roade thither, in hope of great bootie) taken away. The Indian Princes offered the Viceroy three hundred thousand (or as Linschoten telleth, seuen hundred thousand) ducats, for the ransome of this Apes tooth, but the Archbishop dissuaded the Viceroy; who thereupon burnt the same be∣fore those Indian Embassadours, and threw the ashes into the Sea. Not long after, a Benian of Cambaia perswaded the Indians, that hee by Diuine power had taken away that holy tooth being inuisibly present, and had left another in the roome which was burnt. Superstition is credulous, and the King of Bisnagar gaue him a great summe of gold for that Apes tooth, wherewith hee thus apishly had bitten and mocked them, which was after holden in like veneration as the former. But to returne to our Ci∣dambaran History. They F. Fernand. tell, that a holy man, in great penance, had many yeares held his foote pierced through with a peece of yron; and when hee was often by GOD commaun∣ded to leaue that selfe-rigour, he flatly refused, vnlesse that hee might see GOD dauncing about him, which also he condiscended vnto; and with the Sunne, Moone and Starres, which played the Musicians, he appeared dauncing. And as he daunced, a Chaine of gold fell from his foote, whereof this Towne tooke name. For Cidam∣baran signifieth a golden Chaine.
Now at this time 1598. there was a great contention, whether the signe of Perimal should be erected in the Temple of Cidambacham. This signe was a gilded mast, with an Ape at the foote thereof. Many Embassadours were there about this quarrel; somevrging, some resisting this deed. But the Prince (called the Naicho of Gingi) would haue it set vp, not withstanding the Priests greatest vnwillingnesse. The priests therefore both regular (which are the Iogues) and secular Bramenes ascended vp the roofe of the Church, and thence threatned to hurle downe themselues, which twen∣ty of the Iogues did, and the rest threatned to follow. But the Naicho caused gunnes to be discharged at them, which slew two, and caused the rest to retire and breake their couenant, rather then their neckes, with their fellowes. A woman also of this faction cut her owne throat for zeale of this new superstition. The swelling stile of this king of Bisnagar I thought worthy to be heere inserted, which is this. The titles of the Kings of Bisnagar. The husband of good fortune, the God of great Prouinces, King of the greatest Kings, and God of Kings, the Lord of horsemen, the Maister of them which can not speake, Empe∣rour of three Emperours, Conquer our of all hee sees, and Keeper of all he conquers, dreadfull the eights coasts of the World, vanquisher of the Mahumetans, &c. Lord of the East, west, North, and South, and of the Sea, &c. Vencapat adinus Ragiu Denamaganus Ra∣gel, which now ruleth and gouerneth this world. With the Naicho or King of Gingi (vassall to the King or Emperour of Bisnagar) the: Iesuites found good entertainement. Heere some of the Iogues distributed the wa∣ter of Ganges out of certaine vessells couered with sowle and filthy clothes, which yet the people for deuotion kissed. These Iogues with admirable patience endured the Sunnes heate: and one among the rest inclosed himselfe in an yron Cage, with his head and feete onely out of the Cage, that hee could neither sit nor lie downe at any time: and on the Cage were hanged a hundred Lampes, which foure other Iogues his companions lighted at certaine times. And thus walked hee in this his perpetuall pri∣son, as a Light vnto the world in his vaine-glorious opinion. They reasoned with certaine Bramenes; some of which held the Sunne for God, and yet sometime to haue beene a man, and for his merites so promoted. Some denyed a multitude of Gods, onely allowing that priuiledge to Pyrama, Vidhun, and Vnitir, one of which Maketh, an other keepeth, the third destroyeth all things. Neare to Madure is an idole called Chocanada: which by night appeared in Visi∣on to a Priest, and bade him goe say to the Naicho of Madure, that hee or I must a∣bide in this house: whereupon hee would not be corriuall with his Idole, but resig∣ned the Pallace to him. His deuotion is such, that euery day while he fitteth in iudge∣ment, a Bramene euer and anon soundeth the name of Aranganassa in his eares: and when one is wearie, another succeedeth in the same office, neuer ceasing this Idols remembrance, although he there fitteth fiue or fix houres. I thought meete to mention one Custome Dis. of China pag 401. which some report of the Brama, or Pope-like Bramene in these parts, who by his authoritie dispenseth with many of their Lawes, and disolueth Marriages: giuing libertie at his pleasure to the women to mar∣ry an other; which his dispensation is sealed on her right shoulder, with a marke of a hote yron. Chandagrin is the royall seate of the great King of Bisnagar Melebin Cotig. The chiefe Fami∣lies therein are the Bramenes, Raius, and Cretius. They affirme that their Idole Peri∣all did bring forth the first out of his head (as the Poets tell of Minerua;) the se∣cond out of his breast; the third out of his belly: and all other inferiour Families out of his feete. The Bramenes haue some opinions, not altogether dissonant from the Scriptures. They say, that GOD onely by his thought made a man, which they call Adam. On the tenth day of Iuly Anno 1600. happened an Eclipse of the Sunne, which the Bramenes said was by meanes of the Dragon (which they make a celestiall signe) his biting of the Sunne and Moone: whereupon the King and others neither eate nor dranke that day; deploring their misery, because the Dragon deuoured the Sunne. In the City Prepeti, three miles from Chandegrin is the feast of Perimall, in remem∣brance
of his marriage: at which the offerings amounted to two hundred thousand crownes: and the Charriot of the idoll was drawne forth a mile and halfe in Processi∣on by tenne thousand men. They haue an other Feast of the Kine, because they sup∣pose Perimal to be the sonne of a Cowe, and then the wayes and streetes are full Siman of that cattell. They haue a feast in honour of the Sunne, which lasteth eight dayes, so∣lemnized by the Emperour himselfe, and he is iudged a traitour which is not present thereat. Then they castlots, the King first, and after the rest, diuining by arrowes the next yeares destinie. If an arrow light on a tree, and being plucked out causeth a red liquor to follow, it prognosticateth warres; if white, peace. Not farre hence is an Idoll called Tripiti, to which are great Pilgrimages and Offerings; alwayes as they goe, some beginne, and the rest answere, and so all continue to resound the name of the Idoll Goia. Before they enter into the Temple, they shaue and wash themselues. They haue Heremites which they call Sanasses, who liue in deserts, and at some times appeare before the people naked. They haue others which they call Gurupi, learned Priests, (as it were a degree of Doctors) which beare a great port, and neuer goe forth on foote. The Idoll Tripiti is seated on a mountaine, about which are fertile valleys; stored with fruits, which none may touch, as being consecrated. There are in the woods great abundance of Apes, so tame, that they will take meat out of mens hands: the people esteeme them a diuine race, and of the familiaritie of Perimal the chiefe God, whom they worship in many colours and shapes, as of a man, oxe, horse, lion, hogge, ducke, cocke, &c. As Veiga Em.de Veiga. and Ricius; two Iesuites, trauelled to Chaudegrin, they came to Tra∣vilur, where they sawe their Idoll, with a white banner on his backe, and after him three sacred kine, with Drummers on their backes, and after them Trumpetters and many Musicians of other sorts. Then followed thirrie women dauncing, which were also consecrated to the Idolles seruice, and might not marry, but vet prostitute their bodies: these were richly attired, and carried Lights. The Priests followed with the Idoll, and were followed by the people with Lights. At their returne they set downe the Idoll, and set sodden rice before him to eate; others meane while driuing away the flies; and others couering him that hee should not be seene eating: and at last, one maketh a long Oration of the worthy acts of their God, and then set him a∣gaine in his place. This lasted foure houres; and in the mean space many reasoned with the Iesuites, and some held vaine Discourses of the Creation: as, that there were seuen Seas; one of salt-water, the second of fresh, the third of honey, the fourth of milke, the fift of Tair (which is creame beginning to sowre) the sixt of sugar, the seuenth of butter: that the Earth had nine corners, whereby it was borne vp by the Heauen. O∣thers dissented, and said, that the Earth was borne vp by seuen Elephants; the Ele∣phants feete stood on Tortoises, and they were borne by they knew not what. When the Naicho of Tangaor Melh. Cotig. died, three hundred of his Concubines willingly offered themselues to the fire, to honour his funerall; so much can Custome harden so delicate and soft-hearted a nature. The Temples Gi.Rot.Bin. in this Countrey haue great reuenues, which in some places are encreased by the deuotion of women, which prostitute themselues to gaine for their Idoles: and many yong girles are brought vp for this purpose. Many are here in these parts, of the Sect of the Guzzarats, which kill no quicke thing, as is spoken Osr.lib.4. Some haue a stone hanging about their neckes, as big as an egge, with certaine lines drawn through the middle thereof; and this they worship, and call it Tambarane: they keep euery Friday holiday. The kingdom of Orissa hath on the sea-coast three hundred and fifty miles, betwixt the richer kingdoms of Bengala and Bisnagar, poore of ports and traffike. Raman Magin. is the royall city; from whence the riuer Ganga passeth, and at his fall into the Sea ioy∣neth his waters with those of Ganges. The Inhabitants (except a few Moores) are Gentiles, little or nothing (that I can learne) differing in rites from their neighbours, of which yee haue heard. Some Summario di.pop.orient. ascribe to the Citie Orissa, as the name, so the prin∣cipalitie of the other Cities of this kingdome.
One thing I thought not to omit: That there be Linscbot.c.15. whole Villages and kindreds of people, in other things like to other men, but are borne with one of their legges and one foot from the knee downewards, as thicke as an Elephants legge; which the com∣mon people imagine to be a curse by Diuine iustice, inflicted vpon the whole Gene∣ration, for that their Progenitours murthered Saint Thomas. Linschoten saith, he hath seene and spoken with them, and could learne no other cause thereof. It is to them a deformitie, but no let or impediment otherwise. And thus haue we finished our perambulation of the Continent of Asia. Now let vs ship our selues ouer (for we are not skilful of Hanimants leapes) vnto the Ilands: hauing first feasted you with the fruits and other rarities of Nature in Indie. CHAP. XII. Of the Creatures, Plants, and Fruits in India. OF the Elephant and Rhinoceros is alreadie spoken: and of diuers o∣thers of their beasts. The Elephant is of great vse both for Warre and Peace. When the keeper employeth him in any burthen, he getteth first on his necke, and putteth his feet vnder the beasts eares, hauing a hooke in his hand, which he sticketh aboue betweene his eares, where his stones lie: they binde the burthen with a rope, which at his keepers bidding he taketh in his mouth, and windeth it about his teeth, and so draw∣eth the packe after him. The Elephants are said to keepe themselues chastly to one fe∣male, which is thought to bring forth in a yeare and halfe or two yeares. Christ. Acosta in fine Linschot. lib.1.cap.46. Thomas Lopez; &c. Christopho∣rus Acosta, Linschoten, and other moderne Authors, as also Aristotle, Pliny, Aelian and others of the Ancient, relate strange reports of the Elephant. For the Readers de∣light I will mention some. An Elephant being weary, hasted home; his keeper after much entreatie not preuailing, told him it was for the King of Portugalls seruice, which he would haue him doe: the beast answering hoo, hoo (which in the Malabar language signifieth I will, I will, as Acosta interpreteth) fulfilled his request. The same Elephant wanting his meat; his master said it was because his kettle wherein he vsed to boile it was broken, and therefore willed him to carry it to the Tinker; which he did, and brought it againe, but ill-mended: whereupon he was sent againe, and the Tinker to trie him, amended it worse. The Elephant carries it to the riuer which ranne by, to see if it would hold water, and finding it to runne, came back with great noise and an∣ger: the Tinker entreats pardon, and at the third time doth it well; which yet the Ele∣phant would not beleeue, till by triall he saw it held water, and then shewing it to the standers by that it would hold, carried it home. A souldiour hurled a Coco-shell at an Elephant: which (because he could not then repay it) put the shell in his mouth, and a few daies after seeing him in the street, at Cochin, he hurled the same out of his mouth at the souldiour againe. Another souldiour iniured the keeper of an Elephant, which would haue reuenged the wrong, but was forbidden by his said keeper: but after e∣spying the souldiour, when his keeper was absent; he took him vp in his trunke & duc∣ked him diuers times in the water, & then set him downe where he had taken him vp. They are very ambitious. One being vpbraided of lazines by his keeper, when as his burthen was too heauie for him to draw, and therefore they had brought another Ele∣phant to help him; disdaining a companion, thrust him away, & drew himselfe dead in the place. Another in like case fell on his fore-legs, & wept at his keepers chiding, and although he admitted a cōpanion till the greater difficultie was ouercome, yet feeling it thē in his own power to draw, he put away the other Elephāt with his head & teeth, to recouer his credit. Of the admirable capacitie, gratitude, and other qualities of this beast, were tedious to recite. An ample testimony hereof, is the example of the King of Aua his Elephant before mentioned. Of the Rhinoceros I haue little further to say: as of other beasts tame & wilde, which Nature yeeldeth in other places as well as here. As for fowles, they haue abundance of Parrots, & Noyras, more pleasing in beautie,
speech and other delights then the Parrot, but cannot be brought out of that countrey aliue. Of Bats as bigge as Hennes, about Iaua and the neighbour Ilands, we haue al∣readie spoken. Clusius Clus. Exot. lib. 5.cap.1. bought one, of the Hollanders, which they brought from the Iland of Swannes, Ilha do Cerne, newly stiled by them Maurice Iland; it was aboue a foote from the head to the taile, aboue a foot about, the wings one and twentie in∣ches long, nine broad, the claw whereby it hung on the trees, was two inches, the pisle easily seene, &c. Heere Cap.4. they also found a fowle which they called Walgh-vogel, of the bignesse of a Swanne, and most deformed shape. In Cap.3. Banda and other Ilands, the bird called Emia or Eme, is admirable. It is foure foot high, somewhat resembling an Ostrich, but hauing three clawes on the feet, and the same exceeding strong: it hath two wings rather to helpe it running, then seruice∣able for flight: the legges great and long: they De Bry part.4. Ind.Or. say it hath no tongue, and that it put∣teth out the pisle backwards, as the Camell: that it deuoureth Oranges and Egges, rendring the same in the ordure, nothing altered. Of the birds of Paradise, elsewhere is shewed the falsehood of that opinion, which conceiue them to want feet, whereas they goe as other birds, but being taken, the bo∣die (for the most part) together with the feet are cut off, and they being dried in the Sunne, is so hardened and closed, as if Nature had so formed them. This is testified by inerarium.A Pigaset. Holland. Nau. Pigafetta, and the Hollanders. Of this, Clusius in his Auctarium hath a large Dis∣course, shewing diuers kinds of them, a greater and a lesse: and saith that Iobin de Wee∣ly of Amsterdam sold one of them, which had feet, to the Emperour, 1605. But I would not herein be tedious. Of the birds and beasts of India, Acosta, Linschotn, Cin∣sius, besides Gesner and others can informe the studious. They haue Crowes so bold, that they will come flying in at the windowes, and take the meat out of the dish, as it standeth on the table before them that are set thereat: and are such vexatiō to the Bussles, that they are forced to stand in waters vp to the necks, that they may be rid of them. They haue Rats, which the Cats dare not touch, as big as yong Pigges, which vndermine the foundations of houses in such sort with their dig∣gings, that they sometimes fall to the ground. There are other little red Rats, which smell like muske. Incredible is the scathe which they receiue in Goa by the Pismires, which with such huge multitudes will presently assaile any thing that is fatty, or to be eaten, that they are forced to set their cup-boords and chests, wherein are their victu∣alls and apparell, with a woodden cisterne of water vnder euery of their foure feete, and that in the middle of the roome. And if they forget to haue water in the cisterne, presently these Ants are all ouer, and in the twinckling of an eye (saith Linschoten) they will consume a loafe of bread. The like cisternes haue they for their beds and tables: and for the pearches wheron they set their Canary birds, which els would be killed by Pis∣mires, yea though it hung on a string frō the roofe of the house. The poorer sort which want cup-bords, hang their fragments in a cloth on the wall, hauing a circle of char∣coales about it; with this wall to keepe out this small creature, and great enemy. There are other Ants almost a finger long, and reddish, which doe great harme to fruits and plants. Great is the harme which Moths and Wormes doe in mens cloths and bookes, which can very hardly be kept from them. But more hurtful is the Baratta, which flieth and is twice as bigge as a Bee, from which nothing almost can be kept close enough, and are to be esteemed as a plague among them like to the Pismires, and are common∣ly in all fat wares and sweet meats, and when they come vpon apparell they leaue their staining egges behind. The Salamander is said Icones de Bry Ind. Or.p.rt.4. to be common in the Ile of Madagascar. Of Serpents L.Vert.Lib.5.cap.22. they haue diuers kinds and very venemous, besides one other kind as big as a Swine, which is destitute of poison, & hurteth only by biting. But the superstitiō of the King of Cale∣cut multiplieth their serpents. For he causeth cottages to be set vp to keep thē from the raine, and maketh it death to whomsoeuer that shall kill a Serpent or a Cow. They think Serpēts to be heauēly spirits, because they can so suddēly kil men. So much hath that old Serpēt, both at first & since, deluded mē by this venemous creature. There An. Galuano. are hogs with horns in the Moluccasin Celebes & Mindanao are hogs, which bendes the
teeth they haue in their mouthes, haue other two growing out of their snouts, and as many behind their eares of a large spanne and halfe in length. Of fish they haue great plentie and varietie. They haue of Hayens or Tuberons which deuoure men, especially such as fish for pearles. And others bath themselues in cisternes, not daring to aduenture the riuers for them. Of fish-monsters like men, and like an hogge some write: and as monstrous is that, which Maffans Maff. hist. Ind. lib.7. telleth of a Whale, which with the opposition of his huge bodie, stayed the course of a shippe sayling with eight other shippes into India, with so great a noise and shaking, as if they had fallen on a rocke. Neither could the windes, which filled the sailes, further her course. The Marriners, when they saw two elements of Wind and Current, so strongly encountring, looked out and saw this monster, with her finnes embracing the sides of the shippe, and enterlacing the sterne with her taile, applying her bodie to the keele, which contained about An hundred and fiue Do∣drantes. eightie foot in length. They thought presently that some hellish fiend had beene sent to deuoure them; and consulting of remedie, at last sent out their Priest in his holy vestments, with crosses and exorcismes: who (like the greater diuell) preuailed with these weapons, and the Whale forsooke them with∣out further hurt. There are Linsc.c.48. certaine fish-shells, like Scalop-shells, found on the shore; so great that two strong men with a leauer can scarse draw one of them after them. They haue fish within them. A shippe (called Saint Peter) fell vpon sands, sailing from Cochin, and split. The men saued themselues, and of the wood of the old shippe built a Caruell, wherein to get to the Continent, but in the meane while were forced to make a sconse, and by good watch to defend themselues from certaine Crabbes of exceeding greatnesse, and in as great numbers, and of such force, that whomsoeuer they got vnder their clawes, it cost him his life, as two Marriners of the same shippe told mee. Crabbes heere with vs haue a sympathy with the Moone, and are fullest with her fulnes: in India there is a contrary antipathy, for at a full Moone they are emptiest. They haue Oysters, in which the Pearles are found, which are fished for by duckers, that diue into the water, at least ten, twenty or thirty fathom. These men are naked, and haue a basket bound at their backes, which, being at the bottome, they rake full of Oysters and durt together, and then rise vp and put them into boats. They lay them after on the land, where the Sunne causeth, them to open, and then they take out some∣time many, sometime few Pearles, as each Oyster yeeldeth, which is sometimes two hundred graines and more. The King hath one part; the souldiers, a second; the Ie∣suits, a third; and the fishers themselues the fourth: a small recompence for so great a danger, in which many men euery fishing-time lose their liues. The Hollanders found Tortoises so great, that ten men might sit and dine within one of the shells. Of their fruits, Ananas is reckoned Paludanus. one of the best: In taste like an Apricocke, in shew a farre off, like an Artichoke, but without prickles, very sweet of sent. It was first brought out of the West-Indies hither. Iacas are bigger then the former, and grow out of the bodie of the tree: they are of many pleasant tastes, but hard, to digest. Of Mangas there are three forts, they are as bigge as goose egges. The first sort hath stones, which the second wanteth. The third is poison so deadly, that yet no remedie hath beene found against it. Of the like bignesse is the Caions, of which, of the Iam∣bos, Iangomas, Carambolas, Iambolijs, Papaios, &c. I leaue to speake, as not writing an Indian Herball, but onely minding to mention such things, which, besides their countrey, haue some varietie of nature, worthie the obseruation. For the rest, Garcias ab Horto translated by Carolus Clsius, Paludanus, Linschoten, Christophorus, Acosta writing particularly of these things) and others in their generall Herballs, may ac∣quaint you. Of this sort is the Indian Fig-tree; if it may may be called a tree, which is not a∣boue a mans height, and within like to a reed, without any woodie substance: it hath leaues a fathom long, and three spans broad, which open and spread abroad on the top of it, It yeeldeth the fruit in fashion of the clusters of grapes, & beareth but one bunch
at once, containing some two hundred figges at least, which being ripe, they cut the whole tree downe to the ground, leauing only the root, out of which presently grow∣eth another, and within a moneth after beareth fruit, and so continueth all the yeare long. They are the greatest sustenance of the countrey, and are of very good taste, and smell, and in those parts men beleeue that Adam first transgressed with this fruit. But of greater admiration is the Of this, be∣sides Linscho∣ten see Garcias Hort. with Clusius notes. Ext lib.7.c.26. Coquo-tree, being the most profitable tree in the world, of which in the Ilands of Maldiua they make and furnish whole shippes: so that (saue the men themselues) there is nothing of the shippe or in the shippe, neither tackling, merchandize, or ought else but what this tree yeeldeth. The tree groweth high and slender, the wood is of a spungie substance, easie to be sowed, when they make vessells thereof, with cords made of Cocus. For this nut (which is as bigge as an Estridge egge) hath two sorts of huskes, as our Walnuts, whereof the vppermost is hairy (like hempe) whereof they make Occam and Cordage, of the other shell they make drinking-cuppes. The fruit, when it is almost ripe, is full of water within; which by degrees changeth into a white harder substance, as it ripeneth. The liquor is very sweet, but with the ripening groweth sowre. The liquor extracted out of the tree is medicinable; and if it stand one houre in the Sunne, it is very good vineger, which be∣ing distilled, yeeldeth excellent Aqua-vitae, and wine. Of it also they make, by setting it in the Sunne, Sugar. Of the meat of the nut dried, they make oyle. Of the pith or heart of the tree, is made paper for bookes and euidences. Of the leaues they make couerings for their houses, mattes, tents, &c. Their apparell, their firing, and the rest of the commodities which this tree (more plentifull in the Indies, then willowes in the Low-Countries) yeeldeth, would be too tedious to recite. They will keepe the tree from bearing fruit, cutting away the blossomes, and then will hang some vessell there∣at, which receiueth frō thence that liquor, of which you haue heard. It is the Canarijns liuing, & they wil clime vp these trees, which yet haue no boughes, but on the top, like apes. This tree hath also a continuall succession of fruits, and is neuer without some. No lesse wonder doth that tree Clusius descri∣beth this tree out of the Re∣lations of Pliny lib. 12. Curtius lib. 9. Strab. l.5. Theophrastus lib.4. and men∣tioneth like kinds (if not the same) out of Lopez de Ca∣agneda lib.7. Oustdo lib.6. Lope or Piga of Congo, &c. clus. Exet. lib.I.cap I. cause, which is called Arbore derais, or the tree of roots: Clusius calleth it (by Plinies authoritie) the Indian fig-tree: and Goropius (with more confidence, then reason) affirmeth it to be the tree of Adams transgression. It groweth out of the ground, as other trees, and yeeldeth many boughes, which yeeld certaine threads of the colour of gold, which growing downewards to the earth, doe there take roote againe, making as it were new trees, or a wood of trees, couering by this meanes the best part sometimes of a mile: in which the Indians make galleries to walke in: The figs are like the common, but not so pleasant. The Arbore triste Garcias ab Horto lib. . c.1. C. Acosta.c. 37. saith it growes most in Malabar. deserueth mention: It growes at Goa, brought thither (as is thought) from Malacca: The Hollanders saw one at Acri in Samatra. In the day-time and at Sunne setting, you shall not see a flower on it: but within halfe an houre after, it is full of flowers, which at the Sunne-rising fall off; the leaues shutting themselues from the Sunnes presence, and the tree seeming as if it were dead. And that yee may know the Indians want not their Metamorphoses and Le∣gends, they tell that a man, named Parisatico, had a daughter, with whom the Sunne was in loue; but lightly forsaking her, he grew amorous of another: whereup∣on this Damosell slew her selfe, and of the ashes of her burned carcasse came this tree. Bettele The Plant Bettele. is a leafe somewhat like a Bay-leafe, and climeth like Iuie, and hath no o∣ther fruit: neither is any fruit more in vse then these leaues: at bed and boord, and in the streets as they passe, they chew these leaues; and in their gossippings or visiting of their friends, they are presently presented with them; and eate them with Arecca, which is a kinde of Indian nut. It saueth their teeth from diseases, but coloureth them as if they were painted with blacke bloud. When they chew it, they spit out the iuice, and it is almost the onely exercise of some, which thinke they could not liue, if they should abstaine one day from it. They hane an hearbe called Dutro, which causeth distraction, without vn∣derstanding any thing done in a mans presence: sometimes it maketh a man
sleep as if he were dead the space of foure and twentie houres, except his feete bee washed with cold water, which restoreth him to himselfe; and in much quantity it kil∣leth. The women giue their husbands thereof, and then in their sights will prostitute their bodies to their lewder louers, and will call them Cornudo, stroking them by the beard: the husband sitting with his eyes open, grinning like a foole, and when he re∣turneth to himselfe, knoweth nothing but that he hath slept. Another strange hearbe is called Sentida, or feeling, for that if any passe by it, and toucheth it, or throweth sand or any thing else on it, presently it becommeth as if it were withered, and closeth the leaues; so continuing as long as the man standeth by; but so soone as he is gone, openeth fresh and faire: and touching it againe, it wi∣thereth as before. But the strangest plant (for so may we terme it) is, that at Goa the hornes of beasts slaughtered are throwne together in one place, lest they should be occasion of indig∣nation and reproch to any; the shewing or naming of a horne being there ominous. These hornes thus cast forth, after a certaine time, take roote, and the rootes grow two or three spannes in length. Pepper (whereof there are diuers forts) groweth at the foot of Arecea, or some other tree, on which it climeth, as Bettele or Iuie; growing in bunches like grapes. Cinamom Garcias ab Horto.i.1.c.1. is the inner barke of a tree as big as an Oliue; with leaues like bay-leaues, and fruit like an Oliue: The drying of the barke maketh it roll together. Within three yeares after, the tree yeeldeth another barke, as before. In Seylon is the best. They of Ormuz call it Darchini, that is, wood of China: and selling it at Alexandria, call it Quasi Amomum ex Sina delatum. Cinnamemum. Ginger Ginger. groweth like yong reeds, or Gladiolus, with a roote like a Lilly: it is plen∣tifull in Malabar. Cloues Cloues. grow in the Moluccos on trees, like Bay-trees, yeelding blossomes, first white, then greene (at which time they yield the pleasantest smell in the world) and last of all red and hard which are the Cloues. They are so hot of nature, that if a paile or tub of water should stand in the chamber, when they clense them, or any vessell of wine or of her moisture, in two dayes the Cloues would sucke it out and drie it. The same na∣ture is in the vnspunne silke of China. The Nutmegge-tree, Nutmegs. is like a Peach or Peare-tree, and groweth most in Banda and Iaua. The fruit is like a Peach, the inner part whereof is the Nutmeg, which is couered and interlaced with the Mace or Flowre, and ouer that, is the fruit like a Peach, as I haue seene them conserued. When the fruit is ripe, the first and outermost part ope∣neth, as it is with our Walnuts, then the Mace flourisheth in a faire red colour, which in the ripening becommeth yellow. It were an endlese peece of worke, and not so pertinent to our purpose, to speake of the rest of the spices, drugges, and fruits in India: These (as the rarest or cheese) I haue chosen so (as it were) to recreate our Reader with a walke, and howres-view in this Indian Garden, being before full cloyed with our tedious narrations of their supersti∣tions. I might adde heere a discourse of Gemmes, as Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, &c. But it becommeth not my pouertie to talke so much of Iewels. The greatest ver∣tue in any which I haue read of, was of that which Osorius Osor. de Reb. Em.lib.7. 8. saith, would not suffer a droppe of bloud to fall from him that ware it, who yet, without losse of bloud, was flaine by a great wound: and this Iewell was lost by shippe-wracke, when it should haue beene sent to Portugall for a present to the King. He which had this Iewell, as called Nhodaheguea, a Prince of Samotra, which was killed in his shippe; and the Portugalls riing him, found no bloud about him, till they had taken from him a chaine of gold, in which this stone was inclosed, and then hee bled fresh∣ly This stone is taken out of certaine beastes, which the Siamites call Cabri∣sias. The Bezar-stone. Bezar-stones are likewise taken out of the maw of a Persian or Indian Goat, which the Persians call Par. And in the Countrey of Pan, by Malacca, they finde within the gall of an Hogge a stone, of greater force against poyson and other diseases, then that Pazar-stone. It is thought that
these stones doeproceed of the pasture whereon these beasts feed. The Amber is found as well in other places as in India. Garcias Garcias ab Horto. in Clus. Exot.lib.7.c.1. thinkes it to be the nature of the soile, as Chalke, Bole-armenike, &c. and not the seed of the Whale, or issuing from some fountaine in the sea, as others hold. Clusius tels a probable opinion of D. Marel, that it was an excrement gathered in the Whales belly. Galmano Discou. writeth of a small vermine in Sian, which cleaueth fast to the trunke of the Elephant, and thence sucketh out his bloud and life: his skull is so hard that it can∣not be pierced with a hand-gun: and in his liuer is said to be the likenesse of men and women, and he which hath one of them about him, is safe from wounds by iron. He telleth of a tree in Mindanao; the one halfe whereof (which standeth towards the East) is a good remedie against poison: the Westerne halfe yeeldeth the strongest poyson in the world. There is a stone, on which whosoeuer sitteth, shall bee broken in his bodie. CHAP. XIII. A gennerall Discourse of the Sea, and of the Ilands ad∣ioyning to Asia. AFter our long perambulation of the Asian Continent, the sea inuiro∣ning doth sollicite our next endeuours, that the Reader might there refresh his wearied sense, with a new succession of Natures varieties, and humane vanities. And first, while our Barke be made readie to ship vs ouer to some of those Ilands, let vs (as it were on the shore) take view of this, so strong, so weake, so constant, and so vnconstant waterie Element. The Sea is great and wide, saith Psal. 104.25- and 26. the Psalmist: and at first couered the whole earth like a garment, till for mans vse Gen. 1.9. the drie land appeared, which for mans abuse was againe in the dayes of Noab couered: And had not GOD Psalm. 104.9 set the Sea a bound which it cannot passe, it would returne to couer the Earth for euer. It is his Ferem. 5.22. perpetu∣all decree, who commanded, and it was made, that though the waues thereofrage, yet they cannot prenaile; though they roare, yet they cannot passe ouer. For how casie were it for the Sea o enclose the Earth in her watery mantle, and againe to make a conquest of the drie Land, hauing such forces of her owne, and such re-enforcements from the Aire, and the Earth it selfe? Her owne powers, euen by order of Nature and proporti∣on of the Elements, cannot but seeme dreadfull: in which, as the Aire exceedeth the Water, and is it selfe exceeded of the Fire; so the Water may seeme no lesse to sur∣mount the Earth, the lowest and least of the Elements. And what armies of exhalati∣ons doth the Sunne daily muster in the great airy plaine, which would succour their mother in such an attempt? Besides that, euen the Earth, as it is euery where compas∣sed of the Sea, doth compasse in it selfe so many Seas, Lakes, Riuers, in the vppermost face thereof, as professed partakers; and the inward bowels thereof haue daily intelli∣gence, and continuall conspiracie with the Waters, by those secret pores and priuy passages, whereby it commeth to passe, that albeit Eccles.1 7. a Riuers runne to the Sea, yet the Sea is not filled. And were it possible that so many Worlds of Waters should daily and hourely flow into this watery World, and that such a World of time together, and yet the Sea nothing encreased, but that (as Salomon there saith) The Riuers goe to the place from whence they returne and goe? that is, they runne into the Sea, and thence, partly by the Sunnes force, eleuated and restored in raines, &c. partly by filling the veincs of the Earth with Springs, doe both wayes returne againe in Riuers to the Sea. This Vid. Zane. de Oper. & G P. B. Ret.  &c. appea∣reth by the Dead Sea, and by the Caspian, which receiue many Riuers without open payment thereof to the Ocean: and at the straits of Gibraltar, the Ocean commonly hath a current in at one end, and the Euxine Sea at the other, besides abundance of o∣ther waters out of Europe, Asia, Africa, and yet is no fuller.
The depth of the Sea is holden by some to hold proportion to the height of the Mountaines on the Earth. The saltnesse of the Sea some ascribe to the first Creati∣on; some, to the Sweat of the Earth, rosted with the Sunne; some, to the saltnesse of the Earth, especially in Minerals of that nature; some, to adust vapours, partly let fall on the Sea, partly raysed from it to the brinkes and face thereof; some, to the moti∣on of the Sea; and some, to the working of the Sunne, which draweth out the purer and finer parts, leauing the grosser and baser behind: as in this little world of our bo∣dies, the purest parts of our nourishment being imployed in, and on the bodie, the vrine, and other excrements remaining, doe retaine a saltnesse. I will not determine this question, as neither that of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, which ( Apollonius Phil.l.5 some say) is the breath of the World; some, the waters in holes of the Earth, forced out by Spi∣rits; some, the meeting of the East and West Ocean: some ascribe it to the Moone, naturally drawing water, as the Load-stone, Iron: some to the variable light of the Moone. A variable light they all giue vs. They that send vs to GOD, and his Decree in Nature, haue said what is the true cause, but not how it is by naturall meanes effe∣cted. Certaine it is, that the Ocean and the Moone are companions in their motion: vncertaine, whether the Ocean hath a naturall power in it selfe, or from the Moone, so to moue. But these things we leaue to Philosophers searching wits, and better ley∣sures. The motion of the Sea is manifold; as first by ebbings and flowings, these also differing, according to the course of the Moone, in Spring, or Nepe-tides, and accor∣ding to the distance, as they are neerer or further from the Ocean, and according to the deepenesse or shallownesse of the places, besides other accidents, ouer-ruling them, making them, in diuerse Seas, to be greater, lesse, or none at all, longer also in some place, or oftener, as in Negropont, where the water is said to rise and fall seuen times a day. And besides these hourely, daily, or monethly motions, another (more generall) is ascribed vnto the Sea, from East to West, proceeding from the motion of the Heauens, which in the openest Seas, as in the Atlantike and South Seas, are apparantly manifest, especially betwixt the Tropickes, where they finde a constant Easterly breath; vncertaine whether it may be tearmed a winde, arising of inferiour exhalations, or some impetuous violence, caused by the superiour motions, which draw together with them the Elements, not of the Fire onely, but also of Ayre and Water. And hence are those strong Currents in di∣uerse places, as that which runneth in at the great Bay, and out againe with like force, betweene Cuba and Florida, causing the Spaniards to goe one way to the In∣dies, and to returne another. Other particular motions in the Sea, proceeding from especiall accidents of the Ayre by windes, which somewhere haue their set seasons; of the Sea by Whirle-pooles, and contrarie currents: of the Land by Capes, Islands, In∣draughts, Riuers, and such like, it would be tedious to relate. The Sea is commonly diuided into the Mediterranean and Ocean: and vnder that Mid-land appellation are contained all the Seas and Gulfes that are seated within the Land, as the Arabian, Persian, Baltike, Bengalan, and especially such as the Sea of So∣dome and the Caspian, which haue no apparant commerce with the Ocean: but espe∣cially is that Sea called Mediterranean, which entring at the Straits of Gibraltar, is both larger then any of the rest (containing, aboue tenne thousand myles in circuit) and abutteth not on one onely, but on all the parts of the elder World, washing indif∣ferently the shores of Asia, Africke, and Europe. The Seas beare also the names of the Countries, Cities, Hills, Riuers, and Lands, by which they passe, or of some other accident there happened; as the Atlantike, or Ger∣mane Ocean, the Adriaticke, the Redde, White, or Blacke Seas, the Sea of Ladies, the Euxine by a contrarie appellation, for their inhospitalitie. But to contract our speech vnto Asia, we finde the Sea prodigall of his best things, and of himselfe vnto it, clasping, with a louely embrace, all this Asian Continent, saue where a little Necke of Land diuides it from Africa; and no great space, together with Tanais, from Europe. Yea, as not herewith satisfying his loue to this Asian Nymph, in many places he insinuates himselfe within the Land by Gulfes or Bayes,
twining his louing armes about some whole Countries: otherwhere (as it were) by hostile vnderminings he maketh Seas farre from the Sea; and especially hath yeel∣ded so many Islands, as rather may seeme admirable then credible. For, to let passe the North parts (as not so well knowne) where Vaygats, Nova Zemla, and the rest, would giue vs but cold entertainement: Comming thence to the East and South, we are encountred with the Island, or Of the Islands of Asia. Islands rather, bearing the name of Iapan; the principall where of are three: of which more afterwards. These are seconded by the Islands of China, which doe (as it were) hedge and fence it in; of which, there is little in Authors worthie mentioning. In Macao, or Amacan, the Portugalls haue a Colonie, but the chiefe Island of China is Anian, in the Gulfe of Cauchin-China. Further from the Continent, from Iapan Southwards, are many Islands, called by the names of Lequi, the greater, and the lesse, rich in Gold: nigh to the same is Her∣mosa: and next to these the Philippinae, so called P. Bert tab. of Philip the second, King of Spaine, by whose charge and charges they were discouered in the yeare 1564, long after that Magellanus had lost his life in the discouerie of these parts. Some make this name hold some proportion to the Spanish ambition, calling all the Islands Phi∣lippinae, which are betweene New Spaine, and the Gulfe of Bengala, in all, after their account, eleuen thousand. They begin their reckoning at Noua Guinae, where first we see Cainam. The next Banda, which name is proper to an Island so called, and common also to her neighbours, Rosolarguin, Ay, Rom, Neyra, in foure degrees to the South, which alone in the world are G. Bot.Ben. said, by some, to bring forth Nutmegs and Mace. The men here are Marchants, the women attend to Husbandrie. The Islands del More abound with Rice and Sagu (a fruit which yeeldeth Meale) where A. Pigafeta. are wilde Hennes, which sit not on their egges, but burie them a good depth vnder the sand, where the Sunne hatcheth them. They haue no Kine, but a Fish of like linea∣, which they take in their Nets. Gilolo hath a Mahumetane Prince, and is a great Island; the people are Men-eaters. Amboino is the name of many Islands, rude both in soyle and people, which eate their owne parents when they are olde. Neere to these are the Moluccae, fiue in number, Ternate, Tidor, Motir, Machian, and Bachian, famous through the world, as being Natures Store-house of Cloues. Their worship is directed to the Sunne, Moone, and other heauenly and earthly creatures. The Selebes. Selebes abound with Gold, abandoned of goodnesse, peopleD with Idolaters and Men-eaters. The Islands of Moratay. Moratay are more Northerly, where Bat∣tata-rootes is their bread, their neighbours fare in the Islands of Tarrao, Sanguin, So∣lor, and others. In those Islands, which more properly beare the Philippine title, Mindano is, of very large circuit, and hath diuerse famous Cities: Tendaia, for her excellence, is by some called the Philippina. Luzzon incompasseth a thousand myles, in which the Spaniards haue built a Towne, called Manilia, and haue thither carried Cattell for breede. Borneo is reputed as bigge as Spaine, richly attended with many Islands of smal∣ler circuit. It hath a Citie of the same name, founded on Piles, in the salt water, with sumptuous buildings of hewed Stone, couered with Coco leaues. The King is a Mahumetan. The greater Iaua is by Scaliger I. Scal. called an Epitome, or Summe of the World; rich in many Commodities. The Cabal is a wilde Beast in this Island, whose bones doe restraine the bloud from issuing in wounded parties. The South part is Gentiles, as the Countries within the Land; but towards the shore they are Mahumetans. Tou∣ching the lesser Iaua, there is some controuersie which should be it. Betwixt Malacca and Samatra Nature hath (as it were) sowed that Field of Wa∣ters with Islands; the principall of which is Bintam. Samatra, within the Countrey, is Ethnikes: towards the Coast are Moores; an Island large, rich, and populous, di∣uided into many Kingdomes. The Gulfe of Bengala is (as it were) garded with a double ranke of Islands, which Neptune hath set as Garisons of those Seas. But these ll are not worthie the honour
due to Zeilan, called in old times Taprobana. if they guesse not better which so call Samatra. From thence, alongst the Coast of India, are seene few Islands of any great∣nesse: But further into the Sea are the Maldiva, so called of Maldiva, one of their number, whose name signifieth a thousand Islands; some of which are diuided by lar∣ger Seas, some by smaller Armes; the Ocean somewhere with his greatnesse threate∣ning to swallow them, and in other places as curious of his delightfull search, stea∣ling rather, then forcing a separation, prouoking the passengers to communicate in his sports; who sometimes, helped with some ouer-growing Tree, can leape from one Island to another. Yet hath not Nature, thus diuersifying their situation, yeel∣ded them diuersitie of her riches, sauing that it seemeth here shee hath chosen her chamber for the Palme, or Coquo- Nuts, which in other places she hath, in compa∣rison, but scattered, here stored, that by this store the people might supply all their other wants. Yea, besides the Land-Coquo, there groweth another vnder the water bigger then the former; a speciall Antidote for poyson. The inhabitants are addicted to subtletie and Sorcerie, and in the Islands next to the Continent, Moores beare sway; in the rest, Pagans. Other Islands, of smaller reckoning, we reckon not. Diu hath long beene famous for the warres therein, vainely attempted by the Turke and Indians against the Fortresse of the Portugalls. The Persian Gulfe hath left some remnants of Land extant; the chiefe is Ormus, a famous Mart, which the Moores there maintained, vnder the gouernment of a Moore, afer made tributarie to the Portugall; which Nature hath made barren; In∣dustrie, plentifull: the more fertile Element yeelds barrennesse and Sands; the bar∣renner bringeth in a double wealth, Pearles and Merchandise. In the Discourse of these Asian Seas and this Persian, amongst the rest I thought it worthie relating, which L. de Vrreta Hist. Ae Luys de Vrreta, in his Aethiopian Historie telleth of a certaine Iew. He trauelling alongst the shore of this Persian Sea, by some In Armes thereof, which embay themselues within the Land, saw the Sea loftie swelling, by force of the Winds and Tides, seeming to threaten the higher Elements, but euen now readie to swallow vp the Earth, roaring out a loud defiance in such sort, that the poore Iew was amazed, and dreadfully feared therewith: and this continued the space of some dayes, whiles the Iew trauelled thereby. But on the Saturday and Sabbath, Superstition commaunded the Iew; and Nature (the handmaid of Diuinitie) enioyned the angrie Elements to rest; a sudden calme followed, as if waues and winds would accompanie the Iewin his deuotions, and had forgotten their former furie and wonted nature, to remember the sanctification of this day. The Iew hauing heard before, that there was a Sabbaticall Rer (which some place in Aethiopia, some in Phoenicia, others they cannot tell where) in a credulous fancie persuades himselfe, that this Arme of the Sea was that Sabbaticall streame, & that he now saw the experimēt of that relatiō with his eyes. Fancie had no sooner affirmed, but superstition sware to the truth, & cre∣dulitie tickles him with gratulation of diuine fauor to himself, that had liued to see that blessed sight. Rauished with this conceit, he filles his budget full of the sand, which is of a more grosse and cleauing nature, then in other places, and carrieth it with him as a great treasure vnto the place of his habitation. There he tells his countrey-men that now the Messias would not be long before he came, for now he had found this signe thereof, the Sabbaticall Riuer; shewing this sand in proofe thereof. Credit I∣dus Apella, the Iewes beleeue quickly all but the truth, especially in Portu∣gall, Some say that the Iewes were expelled out of Portugall before these whi∣ther he came with this report. Many thousands moued by his words, remoued their dwellings, and selling their substance, would needs goe into these parts of Petsia, by the Sabbaticall Riuer to fixe their habitation; there waiting for their promised Messi∣ One, and a chiefe of this superstitious Expedition, was Amanes L, a Phy∣sitian of great note, accounted one of the most learned of his profession, and a writer therein; and Iohn Micas, a Merchant of great wealth. They passed through France, Germanie, Hungarie, their company (like a snow-ball) encreasing as they went, with the addition of other Iewes of like credulitie. When they came to Constantinople, there were of them in many bands or companies thirtie thousand,  , the
Turkish Commaunder, thought to gaine by this occasion; and would not suffer them to passe ouer the water into Asia, without many hundred thousands of duckats, except they would passe on horsebacke. This example was soone both spread and followed of the other Bassaes and Commaunders in Asia, as they went; their wealth and sub∣stance being euery where so fleeced, that they came into Syria, much lessened in num∣bers, in estate miserable and beggerly; new Officers euery where, as new hungry Flies, lighting on these wretched carkasses (so I may call them:) some they whipped, some they empaled, some they hanged, and burned others. Thus were these miserable Pil∣grims wasted: and Don Iohn Baltasar was present, when Amat aforesaid being dead with this affliction, his Physicke-bookes were at an Out-cry to be sold at Damasco, and because they were in Latiue, no man would buy them, till at last another Iew became Chapman. Micas, one of the wealthiest men which Europe held, died poore in an Hospitall at Constantinople. And this was the issue of their Pilgri∣mage to the Sabbaticall Streame, which they supposed to finde in this Persian Gulfe; where wee haue too long holden you the spectator of this Iewish Tra∣gedie. The Redde Sea, or Arabia, Gulfe, seemed vnwilling to be the Oceans subiect: so many small Islands doth she continually muster in resistance, besides her vndermining the Sea with her shallow Channell, conspiring the destruction of many heedlesse Ma∣riners, that here will aduenture as tenants to the Sea in their mouing houses. Once (by a mightier hand) was it helped to preuaile against the Seas force, to discouer drie Land in the middest thereof, and with her waterie erected walls to guard these new passengers, till the same hand reuersed it, orrather rewarded the then emptie bellie thereof with the prey of so many thousand Aegyptians. Babelmandel, Cama∣ran, and Mazva are accounted amongst the chiefe of these Isolets: chen hath most Soueraignetie; being the Seat of the Turkish Bassa for Abassia. Socotera is without the Strait. The naturals are Christians, of S. Thomas S who is here said to haue suffered shipwracke, and of whose broken shippe was erected a Church. They are great warriours, both men and women, and great Magicians. They haue no vse of Trafficke, Letters, or Nauigation, and yet are esteemed the no∣blest people in the world. (Two Gio. Bol.Ben. other Islands confront this; of which one (they say) is the habitation of men, and the other of women, which sometimes haue entercourse one with the other, but the Ayre (Natures inexorable and heauie handmaid) not suffering any long abode to each, but in their owne allotted portion. Loth am I to looke any further into that boisterous Sea, and therefore leauing all that huge Tract of Africke, as compassed by a suddaine thought, but vnsalu∣ted, wee shall finde other Asian Islands in the Mediterranean. And because, be∣ing now wearied, the Archipelago would be too tedious a passage for vs, neither are there many Islands worth naming in Propotis, or the Exin, we will speake a little of Rhodes and Cyprus, and then remember how long wee haue forgotten ourselues. The former of those containeth about an hundred and twentie myles: fertile in soyle, and of most pleasant ayre, caused by that loue which Phoebus beareth to it; there neuer passing day, in which he doth not, in his bright and shining apparrell, salute it. And for this cause happily was that huge Colossus of Brasse (gilded ouer, and reputed the most wonderfull of the Worlds seuen Wonders) here dedicated to the Sunne (though some ascribe it to Iupiter.) the workmanship of Chares Lin∣di, of threescore and tenne cubits, or as others tell, a hundred fortie three feet, This inscription was in the basis as Meursius translates it: Rbodo colossum  quater cubi∣s decem Su∣perbientem Lindius ee it Laches which words shew both the author Lindius  and the height so,  bites Meursius in transt. Con∣stant. but it selfe told fourescore cubits in height, which, falling by an Earthquake, the Oracle forbad the Rhodians to erect againe. But nothing forbad Mabias, or Mu∣ the fifth Caliph, after his seuen yeares Warre about Constantinople (as sayth Constant. Por∣phyrogeitus de d imp , Theophanis Chronicon. Constantinus out of Theophanes) inuading this Island, to carrie away nine hundred (or, as Constantnus numbreth, three thousand and fourescore) Camels burthens of this Brazen carkasse.
The Temple of Liber was here enriched with many presents of the Greekes and Romanes, to both which the Citie of Rhodes was had in friendly and honourable regard. Much was their force by Sea in auncient times, and for two hundred yeares space it was the Seat of the Hospitular-Knights, which now reside in Malta; driuen thence by mightie Solyman. These Knights had also, by purchase of King Richard the first of England, the Island of Cyprus, Adrian. Ro∣man. Theat. Vrbium, l.2. dedicated by the Poets to Venus, to whome the inhabitants were too much addicted, as appeared by their Temples and other vanities in her ho∣nour. At Paphos shee was worshipped in the likenesse of a Nauell; and round thereabouts (by the Deuils working) it rained not. Trogus writeth, That the Cy∣prians prostituted their daughters (before they married them) to Mariners on the shore. Wee haue seene at Rome (sayth R. Volteranus) the attendants of Queene Carlotta, neuer a whit better then those auncient. Of Cyprus thus reporteth Ammianus Marcellinus, lib. 4. It is ennobled by two Cities, Salamis, and Paphus; the one famous for Iupiters Images; the other, for the Temple of Venus. It is so plentifull in all thinges, that it needes no helpe of other Nations, and of her owne abundance is able to set forth a Shippe, from the Keele to the Toppe-sayle, with all prouision, furnished to the Sea. Neither grieue I to tell it; the Romanes more greedily then iustly made themselues Lords thereof. For Ptolomey the King being confederate with vs, was proscribed without any fault, but the defect of our Treasurie, who therefore poysoned himselfe, and the Isle became Tributarie. Sextus Rufus fayth as much. Amasis was the first, if wee beleeue Hrodotus, Herod. Thalia. , that euer conquered Cyprus, and máde it. Tributarie. Hee also sayth (Lib. 7.) That the Cyprians were partly from Salamine and A∣thens, partly from Arcadia, partly from Cythnus, from Phoenicia, and from Ae∣thyopia. Pliie affirmeth Plin. 1.5.c.31. , That it was sometime the Seat of nine Kings, and was diuersly named, as Acamantis, Cerastis, Afpelia, Amathusia, Macaria, Cryptus, and Colinia. It was such a Forrest of Trees Ortel. Theat. , that when as their Ship∣ping and Mines were not able to waste them, it was made lawfull for any man to fell and destroy them, and for his labour to possesse the Land which hee had so cleared. In the time of Constantine it was forsaken of the inhabitants, as before forsa∣ken of the Elements, which refused to water with any droppes of raine that Island (sometime accounted happie) the space of seuenteene yeares together, or as others haue it, sixe and thirtie, re-peopled from diuerse parts by Helena, the mother of Constantine Quadi Geo∣graphia. , and remaining to the Greeke Empire, till that Lion of England made it a prey, and the Knights purchase, who sold it to Guido Lusignan: whose po∣steritie fayling, the Venetians succeeded, till Selym the second, minding to erect a Religious Hospitall, to testifie their Magnificence, began with an irreligious foun∣dation. In Hak.voy∣ages the taking of Famagusta, &c. is largely related, To. 2. P.Contarenus de bllo Turc. Ven. For whereas their holy Lawes will not suffer any thing to be dedicated to holy vses, which their owne Sword hath not conquered, he brake League with the Venetian, and robbed them of this Island, which they are thought, not with the iustest title, before to haue possessed. But it is high time to bethinke vs of our Indian shore, whence wee haue taken so large a prospect; where wee are stayed to be tran∣sported into the chiefe of those Islands, there to take a more leisurely view of their Regions and Religions.
CHAP. XIIII. Of the Islands of Iapon, and their Religions. THe Iesuites haue not more fixed the eyes of the World vpon them in the Westerne parts, then they haue fixed their owne eyes on the Easterne; here seeking to repayre, with their vtempered Mor∣tar, the ruines of their Falling Babylon: there laying a new founda∣tion of their after-hopes: here, by their Politicke Mysteries and Mysticall Policies, endeauouring to recouer; there, by new Con∣quests to make supply to their losses: here, for busie intruding into affaires of State, suspected by their owne, hated by their aduersaries; there, by seeming to neglect Greatnesse, and to contemne Riches, of the mightiest are not feared, while others beleeue, obserue, and admire them. Both here and there they spare not to Mat. 23.15. compasse Sea and Land, to winne Pro∣selytes; euery of their Residences, or Colledges, being as so many Forts to esta∣blish this new Romane Monarchie, but with vnlike aduantage, encountering there with Reason (or rather with the carkasse of Reason) attended with Igno∣rance and Superstition, whose Owlish eyes cannot endure the enterview of Truth, though darkened with those Cloudes, wherewith they ouer-cast it: Here with Truth, yea, the Soule of Truth, true Religion; whose Shield of Faith; and Sword of the Spirit, these (the stronger part of those strongest Gates of Hell) cannot preuaile against. A Spanish Faction of Spanish humour and successe, more easily conque∣ring a world of the naked Americanes, and esseminate Indians, then keeping all they had in Europe. Such are the armes of the one, and the preaching of the other. Yet would I faine be thankefull to the one and the other Benefit by the Spaniard and Iesuite. , the first for furthering Geographie with knowledge of a new world; the other, for making a possibilitie of a better world to some, whereas otherwise there was a generall desperation of all. Neither are the wounds of Popish superstition so absolutely mortall, as the Ethnike Atheisme; the one hauing no foundation at all; the other shewing the true founda∣tion: although their Babylonish slime euen heere supplieth the roome of better mat∣ter, besides their stubble, hay and wood built vpon it. Better a mixed Truth, then a to∣tall errour: and a maymed CHRIST, then none at all. But howsoéuer they bee beholden to them for their Diuinity, it were inhumanity in vs, not to acknowledge a beholdingnesse to them, for that they giue vs in the knowledge of many peoples, although in all their Discourses this caution is necessary, not to yeelde them a Ca∣tholique and vniuersall credite, where we any way may spie them dawbing the walls of their pretended Catholike Church. In relating their Miracles, and such like, wee will remember they are Iesuites: in other things not seruiceable to Rome, wee will heare them as Trauellers, when lying doth not aduantage them, nor hurt vs. But as the Labours of the Iesuites may euerie where breed shame to our negligence in a better quarrell: so in Iapon it is most of all admirable, that the furthest part of the World should be so neere to their industry. And that you may at last bee acquainted with Iapon, wee will borrow of them to pay your hopes, by their long introduction suspended. Maffaus (who hath translated and set forth more then thirtie of those Ia∣ponian Epistles) in the twelfth Booke of his Indian Historie, doth thus de∣scribe it. Besides other lesse, three principall Islands beare the name of Iapon;
which the Merator thinkes Iapan to b he Aure  which agreeth not with Ptolo∣mey.l.7.c.2. who placeth it vn∣der the Line. fist and greatet most peculiarly challengeth, containeth in it three & fift Kingdomes or Principalities, the chiefe Citie whereof is Meaco: The second is Xmm, diuided into nine Segiories: The third, Xicoc, quartered into foure Lordships, so that there are in all of this Iaponian Dominion, threescore and six Shires, of petty King∣domes. The space of land is measured two hundred leagues in length, in bredth some∣where ten, in other places thirtie, betweene the thirty and thirty eight degrees of Nor∣therly Latitude: Eastward from China. The soile is not very fertile, subiect to much snow, the air holsome. The bowels of the earth are stored with diuers mettals; the trees are fruitfull, and one A strange Tree. wonderfull, in that it abhorreth moisture, and if haply it be moist∣ned, it shaketh & becommeth withered: which they remedy by plucking it vp by the rootes, and after it is dried in the Sun, to set it in drie sand; if a bough be broken off and nailed on againe, it groweth. They haue two high mountaines, one of which casteth forth flames, and in the top thereof the diuellvseth to shew himselfe in a bright cloud o some, that (by long fasting) haue prepared themselues to this sight: the other, called Fi∣geniana, is by some leagues higher then the clouds. They much esteeme a tall persona∣blenesse: they plucke off the haires on their head: children before; the common people halfe way; the Nobilitie almost all) leauing but a little growing behinde: to touch which were to offer great indignitie to a man. They can indure much hardship: an infant new borne in the coldest of winter is presently carried to the Riuer to be washed: their education is hard: yet are they neat: they vse forkes (as the Chinois) or stickes, not touching the meate with their fingers, and therefore neede no naperie: they sit on car∣pets, and enter the roomes vnshod, their tables are a hand high, some eighteene in∣ches square, curiously wrought, to each guest one, and changed at euery new seruice or change of meate, Quabacondonus, against a solemne and festiuall entertainment of his Father, prepared a hundred and thirtie thousand of these tablets. Their houses are most of wood, because of often Earthquakes: and some of Stone. Temples and Mona∣steries they haue for both Sexes: and more had, till Nubunanga destroyed them. Their language is one, & yet exceedingly diuersified according as they differ in State or Sexe: or as they speake in praise or dispraise, vsing a diuers Idiom. They vse Characters in writing and printing, as in China. Their swords are of a most excellent temper. Their customes differ in many things from other men. Customes in things indifferent are come∣ly or vncome∣ly, pro more loci. Blacke is a festiuall colour, white a Funerall: their meates, drinkes, perfumes, are as dissonant to ours. Their teeth are coloured with blacke, as beauties liuery borrowed of Art, which wee by Art would auoide. They mount on the right side of the Horse. They sit, (as wee rise) to en∣tertaine a friend. They giue to the sicke persons, salt things, sharpe, and rawe: ne∣uer let bloud: wee contrary (as in other rites) either to other ridiculous. All their Nobles are called Toni: amongst whom are diuers degrees: all of them holding their all in capite, to finde so many Souldiours to the Warres, at their owne costs. Gene∣nerally the whole Nation is witty: pouertie is a disgrace to no man. Reproches, Thefts, periuris, Dice-play are hatefull: very ambitious they are in all things, re∣spectiue to their credit, full of courtesie each to other, neuer bralling, no not at home with their houshoulds. The Inconstancie of that State learneth them by vse to prepare for, and to welcome, euery State. They are exceedingly subtle, hypo∣pocriticall and double-dealing: they are also of cruell disposition, not to their ene∣mies alone, but sometimes will assay the goodnesse of their blade and strength of their arme, on some innocent bodie; and in case of distresse, they esteeme it a credit to preuent the sentence of lawe by bloudy execution done on themselues, vvhich they vsually doe in ripping vp their breastes a crosse, a seruant or friend attending to smite off his head: and if it bee a man of any sort, his friends and followers in like manner with their owne hands plucke out their bowels to testifie their loue. The Gouernours haue absolute rule ouer their inferiours: yea, in euery priuate Family the authoritie extendeth to life or death. All apon sometime obeyed one Prince called Vo, or Dairi, who at length addicting himselfe to his priuate delights, and putting off the burthen of ruling to his officers, grew in contempt: and at last euery
one eed on his owne prouince, whereof you haue heard there are threescore and six, Leauing the Dairi a bare title, and a Heralds Kingdome to giue termes of honour at his pleasure, whence he raiseth great reuenue, otherwise subiect (excepting his Title) as are all the rest, to the Lord of Tensa (so they call the noblest Kingdome adioining to Meaco) This Cos. Turian. Vo or Dairi descendeth by succession from the auncient Kings, out of which he is chosen, and is honoured as a God. He may not touch the ground with his foote, which if hee do, hee is put by the place: neuer goeth out of his house, seldome is seene of the people. He fitteth in his seate with a bowe and arrowes on one hand of him, on the other a Dagger. If he should kill any, or if hee shew him∣selfe an enemy to peace, he is depriued as well as if he had troden on the ground. All great men haue their factors with him to procure new titles of honour, the onely fe∣well of his greatnes. They haue another generall officer or chiefe Iustice, which denounceth Warre, and in peace, giueth sentence on matters in controuersie. But these are but the instruments of the Lords of Tensa, as are also the Bonzij. These are their Religious, among whom one is supreme in cases spirituall, by whom all their old holies are ordered, and all new are confirmed or dashed. The Tundi, (which are as their Bishops) are by him consecra∣ted and confirmed, although their nomination be by lay patrons. He dispenseth with them in diuers priuiledges and immunities: he inioyeth great reuenue and soueraintie, and is aduanced hereto by money and kindred. The Tundi giue Priestly orders, and dis∣pense in smaller matters, as eating flesh on daies prohibited. They haue many Sects, some reckon them twelue; all truely agreeing, in disagreeing with Truth: some of them Epicure-like denying Gods prouidence, & the soules immor∣talitie. They hold that a man hath three soules, which one after another come into, and depart out of the body. Few of their Bonzij will openly teach this Doctrine, but la∣bour to hold the people in awe. Amida & Xaca they preach, as Sauiours, & to be wor∣shipped. Some of their Sects doe beleeue an eternall life, and promise it to all such as call vpon these supposed Deities, as Saints which sometime ledd so austere a life, for the sinnes of mankinde, that for a man to vexe his minde, or macerate his body for his owne sinnes, would not onely be superstitious, but offensiue and derogatorie to their merits. And here the kinde-hearted Iesuite Maffaeus. , is panged with a fit of Charitie to yoke the Lutherans with them; as if the sufferings of IESVS were but the superstitions of Amida, as if either the sufferings of man, imperfect, borrowed, dutie, could be, or the sufferings of God could not be meritorious; or as if the I utherans denied Christi∣an contrition (whose affect is Indignation, 2. Cor. 7.11. effect (selfe-reuenge) as they doe Popish confession and satisfaction. These Gods they call Fotoques. Other Gods of a lesse mould they call Camis, which haue their charges and peculiar offices, for health, chil∣dren, riches, &c. as among the elder (that I trouble not the queasie stomackes of the later) Romanes. These were Kings and Noble-men, or Inuenters of Artes, of whom they haue as true tales as Homer or the Legend yeeldeth. Taicosama that died An. Dom. 1598 Fran Pasius: Lud. Frois. a few yeares since, (the first which in these many later ages tooke the Title of a King, which, together with the crowne, he receiued of the King of China) ordained before his death, that his body should not be burned after the wonted manner, but closed in a Chest, and, in a sumptuous temple for that purpose built Al. Valignam. his image should be enshrined and wor∣shipped with the Title of Scinfaciman, or New Faciman, the name of their Mars or warlike God: which was also done. Thus he, which in his youth had vsed to cut wood and carry it into the Market to sell for his daily fustenance, for his valure promoted in militarie honours, at last became the greatest Monarch that Iapon had seene in eight hundred yeares, and not contented with humane greatnes, would aspire to that diuine, whereof hee himselfe had beene a derider in others. His name before was Faxiba, cal∣led after, Quabacondonus, the highest Title next to the Dairi, and signifieth the chiefe of the treasure: next borrowing a kingly Stile from China, would (mad folly) on his death∣bed bequeath Godhead to a man, and immortalitie to a carkasse: when hee could no longer hold out his pride, cruelty, and other wicked courses, which made his presence
dreadfull, his memory detestable. Nabumanga was his predecessour in his state and impietie, arrogating diuine honour to himselfe L. Frois. but destroying the Temples of their Gods, together with their Temple-keepers, the Bonzij. This appeared at Frenoiama, a famous Vniuersitie of those Bonzij, nine miles from Maco, wherein eight hundred yeares past, a Iaponian King had erected three thousand and eight hundred Temples, with houses adioined for the Bonzij: allowing to their maintenance the third part of the reuenue of the Kingdome of Vomen. Hence proceeded their orders and gouerne∣ment in affaires both of state and Religion, being a Seminarie of Lawes and Superstiti∣ons. But these temples in time diminished to eight hundred, and the Bonzian disci∣pline as much mpatred, and altered from austeritie (in some) to wantonnes, (in others) from Artes, to Armes. The Bonzii tooke part with Nechien, enemy of Nabunanga, who enraged hereat made truce with the one, to destroy the other. The Bonzij not pre∣uailing by their suing for peace, fortified themselues for Warre in the Temple of Qua∣non their God of health and long life, much frequented with Pilgrims from all parts; much solemnized with their pompous processions (like in all parts if ye beleeue the Iesuite to their Corpus-Christi-solemnitie) which grew the more famous for that these were but the preamble to the like pompe in the Gibon-Feastiuall at Meaco. But all preuailed not with Nabunanga, who destroyed both Temple and Priestes with fire and sword, burning foure hundred other temples for company, in the yeare 1572. At Meaco hee burned twenty of these Bonzian Cloisters of the greater sort, besides fourescore lesse, and in one of them threescore Bonzian women or Nuns, whose Deuotion was employed in begging for the reparation of the Temple of Dai∣bud. Amongst the rest, as the Grecians had their Mercury with his Caduceus, so the Iaponians haue their Iza with his Trident, to conuay soules departed into their allot∣ted eternall residences: The Bonzij his Chapleines by lots enquired whither they should remoue him, he commanded it, and they with great solemnitie performed it, but out of a place, which then escaped, to another Out of the Frying-pan into the fire. wherein, and where with he was burnt. Fa∣cusangin was another Bonzian Academy adorned with many Colledges which he de∣stroyed. Xinguen the King of Cainochun shaued his head and beard: and professed him∣selfe a Bonzi, & not only attired himselfe in their habite, but thrice a day did performe their superstitions, hauing six hundred Bonzij to his followers. He writ to Nabunan∣ga, intitling himselfe the Patrone of those Religions: the other in his answere stiled himselfe the Tamer of Diuels, and enemie of Sects. But after that he would bee a God, soone did he cease to bee a man; the immortall God, hating corriuals, by his owne subiects destroyed his life, riches, and memory. These Bonzij are for the most part gen∣tlemen whom their Parents (hauing many children) for want of maintenance thrust into Cloisters; Shauen (as you haue heard) and Shauers couetously pilling and polling the people of their money by many deuises, as by selling them scrolles to keepe them (by the Diuell) from hurt of Diuels after death: borrowing of money heere, Bal. Gags. to re∣pay with great interest in the Future world; giuing the Creditor a bill or scroll of their hands for securitie: by telling of things stollen or lost, (which they doe by In∣chantments calling a Diuell into a Child, who being so possessed, answereth their que∣stions) by selling their blessings, and curses like Balaam. Some by vow (the most) liue vnmarried: as the Bonzian women. Another Sect, called Ianambuxos, before their admission into that order liue two thousand or more together on a high mountaine, for the space of threescore daies ma∣cerating themselues with selfe-inflicted penance; the Diuell in diuers shapes meane∣while appearing to them, and after this they are receiued into that damnable fellow∣ship, distinguished by white stockes hanging downe their neckes, curled haire, and blacke hats, and so wander from place to place, giuing notice of their comming by a little Bell. Another Sect called Genguis dwell on some high Hill, blacke of complexion, and (as is supposed) horned, marry wiues of their owne kindred, passe ouer great riuers by the diuels help; who on a certain hill at times appointed appeareth to them; of whom by the name of Amida hee is worshipped. In another hill hee was wont to appeare to his deuoutest followers, whom then he would leade as they thought
to Paradise, indeede to destruction, they say that a sonne, not able to perswade his fa∣ther from this passage to Paradise, secretly followed him with his bow and arrowes, and when the Diuell appeared shot and wounded a Foxe, whom hee followed by the bloud to a lake wherein hee found many dead mens bones. They haue another V∣niuersitie in Iapon called Coia, whose Bonzian students are of the Sect of Combendaxis, supposed the Inuenter of the Iaponian Letters. He in his old age digged a foure-square Caue, into which he conuayed himselfe, affirming that he then died not, but after some millions of yeares would returne in the daies of one Mirozu, which then should bee a most worthy King in Iapon. About his sepulchre burne many Lampes sent thither from diuers Nations, with opinion that such as enrich that monument shall themselues here bee enriched, and in the other life by Combendaxis patronised. In the Colledges here liue six thousand of those Shauelings: from whom women are restrained vpon paine of death. At Fatnochati, the Bonzij A Conni-catching Tricke. trained vp witty and proper youthes in all trickes of subtiltie and guile, acquainting them with Genealogies of Princes that so they might counterfet to be the sonnes of such or such great men, and borrowing money on that credit might enrich their wicked Colledge: till the sleight being found, they were killed of the inhabitants. There be that worship the Sunne and Moone, who haue an Image with three heads, which (they say) is the vertue of the Sunne, Moone and Elements. Cos.Tur. These worship the Diuell, in visible shape appearing to them, with many and costly Sacrifices. Some hold Xacas booke in such Veneration, that without it they hold it impossible to be saued. Other Bonzij haue beene in other ages in high reputation of holines, but Caspar.Vilela. one especially, not a hundred yeers since, the Author of the Sect called Icoxos: the ruler or Generall of which Sect is openly wicked, but so adored of the people, that if he but looke on them they will salute him with teares of ioy, praying him that all their sinnes may bee pardoned, and therewith giue him no small quantitie of their Gold. His yearely festiuall is so honoured with thronging of the people, that in the entry of the Cloyster many are troden vnder foote, which yet is of the blinde people accounted a happinesse, many willingly yeelding themselues to be killed in that presse. And in the night, whiles his praises are sung, there is a great howling and lamentation. Nequiron was Author of the Sect Fquexan. But of other their superstitions you shall heare more in the next Chapter. CHAP. XV. A Continuation of the former Discourse touching the Religions of Iapon. MEaco their chiefe Citie is chiefe also in superstitions, hauing had (if re∣port lye not) on the hill neere to it seuen thousand Cloisters or Abbies: one of which is so famous, that the Kings in their Warres will vow great summes of Gold, and after victory pay the same there: the peo∣ple also in distresse make it their sanctuarie, where the Diuell by visi∣ons deludeth them. In August they celebrate the Feast of Gibon with Pageants: fifteene or sixteene Chariots, couered with silke goe before, in them are chil∣dren with Minstralsie. Euery Chariot is drawne with thirtie or fortie men, and followed by their peculiar companies or trades: and after them Chariots of men armed, which all passe by the Temple in the morning. In the Euening, two litters come forth, carri∣ed by men; the one of the God, the other of his Lemman: then followeth the third: of his Wife, with which the men runne vp and downe in such a confused manner, as may signifie her iealousie. Here the people weepe and pray to their Goddesse, whom yet with a contrarie deuotion they comfort: and lastly (as if by the peoples me∣diation) the Litters are ioined together, and carried into the Temple. In the same moneth they haue their Feast of All soules, in which they light many
Lampes, at their doores, and all night walke vp and downe the Citie: and ma∣ny suppose at a certaine place they meete with the walking Ghosts of their decta∣ed friends, and after welcoming ceremonies, they set vittailes Baites in the iourney to Pa∣radise. before them, at least in that place, where hauing a while attended they inuite them to their houses. The reason of this refreshing they alleadge the long iourney to Paradise, which in lesse then three yeares space cannot bee passed, and therefore they haue neede of heartning. Two dales this Feast lasteth, in which they clense their graues and giue presents to the Bonzii, In March they haue festiuall playes, in which ma∣ny meere in the afternoone painted with the Images of their Gods on their shoulders: and parting themselues into two rankes, the boyes begin with stones, the men conti∣nue the fray with arrowes, poles, and swords, alwaies with the death of some, and im∣punitie of the doers. At Sacai in Iuly they keepe the Feast of Daimaogin, to whom many Temples are de∣dicated: in which the Idoll is carried with much pompe on horsebacke, followed first by the Bonzij, then the Nobilitie, after them certaine Witches, whom armed troupes of souldiours follow. Then commeth the Litter of the God, all gilded, carried by twenty men, answering each other in certaine hymnes; the people worshipping. Some of their Bonzii professe a militarie discipline, as the Knights of Malta. The profession called Neugori was instituted by Cacuban (who is therefore deified) in which some intend their prayers, whiles other fight, and others performe their taske of making fiue arrowes a day. Their gouernment is an Anarchy; euery one obeying and commanding, the meanest person amongst them hauing a Negatiue in all their consultations: And nothing is agreed on till all be agreed. In the night they often kill one another without remorse, and yet (such is their religion) this Sect holdeth it a sinne to kill a flye or any liuing thing. They beleeue diuers Paradises, into each of which their peculiar Gods carrie their owne worshippers: And some make ouer-hastie iourneyes thither on this sort. He watcheth certaine daies, and then out of a Pulpit preacheth of the contempt of the world. Others betake them to bee his companions, while some giue their almes. On the last day hee maketh an Oration to his fellowes, who all drinking Wine goe into their Ship, carrying a sithe to cut vp all the brambles in their way; and putting on their clothes, stufte their sleeues with stones, and hanging a great stone about their neckes to helpe them the sooner to their Paradise, hurle themselues into the Sea. And great honour is done to them being thus dead. I saw one (saith Vilela) that had seuen of these companions, which with their great alacritie, and my great amazement, did this. But they which worship Amida, obserue another rite. Being weary of liuing, they put themselues in a strait hole of the earth receiuing breath on∣ly by a Reede, and so continue fasting and praying till death. Some of them in honour of a certaine Idoll doe cast themselues downe from a high Tower, where this Idoll is placed, and after their death are reputed Saints. Others Pet Alca saile to their Paradise (as before) but, when they haue launched into the deep, make holes in the ships keele for death to enter, and the sea to swallow both it and them Iosephus Acosta Ios.  Hisor. India l.5.c.2.5. tells of a strange Confession which is obserued in this order. There are (saith he) in Ocaca very high and steepe Rockes, which haue pikes or points on them aboue two hundred fadome high. One of which, higher and more terrible then the rest, daunteth and terrifieth the Xaabusis (which be Pilgrims) to looke vp vnto it: vpon the top of the point there is a great rodde of Iron of three fadome long, placed there by a strange deuise: at the end of this rod is a ballance tied, whereof the scales are so bigge, as a man may sit in one of them. And the Goquis (which bee Diuels in hu∣mane shape) command those pilgrims to enter therein, one after another, not lea∣uing one of them. All this is re∣presented to the eye in pi∣ctures by Theo∣dor de Bry.A∣merica part . Then with an Engine or Instrument, which moueth by meanes of a wheele, they make this rod of Iron to hang in the aire; one of the Xamabusis bee∣ing set in one of the scales, which (because there is no counterpoise in the other scale) presently hangeth downe, and the empty one riseth to touch the rod aforesaid, whereupon the ballance hangeth. Then the Goquis telleth the poore Pilgrim that hee
must confesse all the sins that he can remember with a lowde voice, that all may heare: Which he presently doth, some of the hearers laughing, some sighing. At euery sinne mentioned, the other scale falles a little, till that hauing told all, it remaines equall with the other, wherein the sorrowfull penitent sits. Then the Goquis turnes the wheele, and drawes the rod and ballance vnto him, and the Pilgrim comes forth, and another enters till all haue passed. If any concealed any sinne, the empty scale yeelded not, and if when hee was vrged to confesse, he grew obstinate, the Goquis cast him down from the top, where in an instant he is broken into a thousand peeces. A Iaponian who had seuen times made triall hereof, being conuerted to Christianitie reported this. But the terror was such (said he) that few would conceale any thing. The place hereof is cal∣led Sangenotocoro, that is, the place of confession. Thus, much Acosta, whom as I thanke for the Story, so I would a little trouble (for hee would more partiently heare and beare, then some of his hotter brethren) with a question concerning confession. And if the question come too late, yet the Societie liueth (and will longer then a better thing:) into a Colledge of whom Iapon hath brought vs, as their names here testifie. The question is, whether euery residence of the Iesuites be not a Sangenotocoro of Ocaca, that is a place of confession (so doth Sangenotocoro signifie) of which we may exclaime  and if you will  the one for the cruell terrour where with it filleth the Conscience, and the later for the fleshly filthines wherein Ocaca is not bla∣med, but their Our Chau∣cer in the Fri∣ers prologue. Cor. Agrippa de vanit.c.64. and many of the Papists them∣selues confesse thus much of their confessio∣nists Aluar. Pe∣lag. Ouand. Ia∣cob. de Graf.&c. See Whites way to the Church. pag. 229. Churches haue beene Stewes, and Confession, the Baude. But to let this passe, and consider the former. What Racke or Rocke can Ocaca yeeld like to this, which the concil. Trid. Sess.14.ca.5. can 6.7. Councell of Trent hath framed, that full Confession of all mortall sins (loe here the Racke) euen the very thoughts against the two last commandements, with the circumstances of the sinnes, is necessarie by diuine ordinance vnto all which haue sinned after Baptisme; &(loe here the Rocke) Anathema to the gaine-sayers. Tush, your coine is not currant, although you yeeld it profitable, & comfortable, and satisfactorie to the offended Church, except you yeeld all necessary, all diuine. Diuines shal I call you, or Goquis, Diuels in the flesh, that make a hell in the spirits of men? that with your debi∣ta praemeditatione, & with your omnia & singula peccata, etiam occulta, tiam circum∣stantias, Etiam circum∣stantiatum mi∣nutias. Bellar. circumuent poore Christians, and put them in an Ocacan ballance ouer hell∣mouth, there to fall, without such fauour as to be broken in peeces; Goe Cardinall, and write Bellar.to.3..lib.de poeni∣tentia, totus. whole volumes for the proofe hereof, yet would I rather chuse to en∣ter the Sangenotocoro-scale; then your Confession-schoole. Easie it may be indeede to seared Iesuiticall Consciences that account Treason Religion, yea pleasant and delightfull to such Statists to haue Kings vpon the knees of their bodies, to poure out before them the secrets of their soules, and (they are wiser then Salomon Prouerb. 25.3 which estee∣med it vnpossible) to search out the Kings heart. But to such as haue busines enough to know and rule themselues, and doe indeede make Conscience of euery dutie, what intollerable anguish is here prepared? when my heart, besides that it is wicked and de∣ceitfull aboue all, who can search it? is like an vntamed heifer, who can rule it? Had I not neede alway to haue a Priest at mine elbow, to whom to shriue mee? Ir.17.9. Who kno∣weth the errours of his life? and who knoweth when he hath made his due premedi∣tation to examine them? This made Bellarmine vse the difficultie of Confession Bel.de poenit.3.c.12. as an argument of the diuine Institution thereof. It is so difficult (saith he) that no power of man or the Church could haue imposed it, and therefore it was diuine. I vvill not say, who instituted the ballance of Ocaca, and yet it was a hard thing, and neuer the like heard of; I say, that the Gospell imposeth not such hard things (this were to bring vs backe to the Lawe) but prescribeth an Mat. 11.30. easie yoke and a light burthen: easie to such as loue not their ease, light to such as like and delight in it. But this, euen to those that dote vpon it, and deuote themselues to it, is not onely hard, but altogether impossible: Witnesse Bellarmine himselfe, Quid enim mosestius, quid onerosius, quàm vt cogantur eti∣am viri principes, Reges{que} potentissimi, sacerdotibus qui & ipsi homines sunt, peccata sua omnia detegere, quamuis arcana, quamuis turpia, &c. Witnesse experience in such Sheldons Mo∣tiues in the Preface. as haue tried it more neerely then Bellarmines Controuersies would giue him leisure, yet liuing in continuall disquietnes, and torment of their Consciences, in the vse of their
sacrament of Confession, receiuing no rest day nor night, as seruing Gods, who can not giue it them. These are the words of Sheldon (happily brought out of that dark∣nesse, wherein, and whereof he was a Priest and Minister, to a clearer light) who out of his owne knowledge addeth; That it is not imaginable what inconsolable liues, some, that are frequent in the vse of Confession (as necessary to saluation) do leade: there is no stonie heart which would not pitty them, knowing their torments. But lest any man thinke, that some Goquis hath hurled me out of the seate of my hi∣storie, to fall and split my selfe vpon these Iesuiticall rockes, I will returne to our nar∣ration of the Iaponites. Diuers of them before their Images in desperate distresse dis∣embowell themselues in that bloudy manner before mentioned. To tell L. Almeida. of their Idoll Casunga, of whom they begge riches, Tamondea, Besomon∣des, Homocondis and Zoiolis: to which foure, their superstitious opinion committeth so many heauens in custody, Canon and Xixi the sonnes of Xaca, Maristenes, Tirigis, and others, would be too tedious to report. Organtinus Organtinus. telleth that whiles on a time the feast of this last was solemnizing, a showre of stones rained with such violence, that the company to the number of twenty thousand, betooke them to their heeles. But Amida is most worne in their lippes; beggers asking and blessing in his name; chapmen in buying and selling sounding and singing it: the Bonzij promising salua∣tion to all that inuoke it. Admirable are the Temples L. Frois. for matter and workmanship erected to him; one neare Meaco is a hundred and forty elles in length, with a huge Image of Amida, hauing thirtie Images about it of souldiers, besides Ethiopians and Deuills, yea windes and thunders figured, and a thousand Images of Canon (on each side of the Temple fiue hundred) all in like, but monstrous shape, with thirty armes, two onely holding proportion to his body, the breast adorned with seuen faces; all the Images and other furniture so glittering with golde, that it dazeleth the beholders eyes. One Temple is dedicated iust by to a Lizard, (which they make Author and Patron of learning) without Altar or Image in it. Hee that readeth of the huge works of Taicosama, holding sometime a hundred thousand workemen in labour at once, may present to his imagination the incredible buildings which those tyrants, by so many slauish hands, can raise. They are very curious and ambitious in setting forth their funeralls; a matter of no small consequence to the couetous Bonzij, who follow the corpse, if the party were rich, sometime two hundred in a company singing the praises of that GOD which the deceased had most worshipped, beating a basen instead of a Bell, till they come to the fire, where so many rites are performed. I should doe you wrong In L. Frois his Epistle En∣glished Hack. to 2. of voiages you may reade them. to relate them, hauing beene redious in the rest. Onely after so much wickednesse of men, let vs adde somewhat of the admirable workes of GOD in Iapon. On the two and twenty day of Iuly in the yeare 1596. it rained ashes round about Meaco, couering the ground as if it had beene snow. Soone after it rained both there and in other places, as it had beene womens haire. And not long after followed an Earthquake that hurled downe Temples and Pallaces, which with their ruines destroi∣ed thousands: six hundred gilded images in the temple of Ianzusangue were cast down, and broken in peeces, as many remaining whole. It brought vp the Sea a great way vpon the maine land, which is carried backe with it into the Sea, not leauing menti∣on that there had beene land. So was the Citie Ochinofama swallowed, Famaoqui, Ecuro, Fingo, Cascicanaro, the neighbour-townes, attended her in this new voyage, and became Sea. The shippes in the hauen found no more securitie, but were also de∣uoured. The like happened in the yeare of our LORD 1586. to Nagafama, a place frequented with merchants, which the Sea before had enriched, then with an Earth∣quake deuoured, the earth in many places opening such wide mouthes, that a ealli∣uer-shot could scarce reach from the one side to the other, bleching out of that yaw∣ning passage such a ine, as none were able to pae y.  one∣ly shook with seare, but bellowed out such roaring cries vnder that blow of their Cre∣ators hands, as did make the accident more dreadfull. Yet was all  forgotten,
and Taicosama fell to building of new Pallaces. He that listeth further to be acquainted with Iaponian affaires, may resort to the E∣pistles of the Iesuites, which, besides these I haue named, are many: and of that socie∣tie are not many lesle then two hundred in this Iland Gab.Matasus.1603.Eman.Aosa. , which also is now become an Episcopall Sea. The first of them was Xauier, one of Ignatius first companions, and like to haue beene canonized before him too. But the first finding of this Iland is by Galvanus ascribed to Anthony Mota and his fellowes 1542. But before these M. Polo writeth of this Iland, which hee calleth Zepangu M.Pol.li.3. whither Cubla the great Tartarian Can in the yeare 1264. sent two Captaines to conquer the Iland. The winds (as angry with the Tartarians, and taking part with the Ilanders) raised so stormie a Sea, that (when there were now thirtie thousand of their company landed in a little Iland) they were forced to put off to Sea, and scattered with tempests. The Ilanders set forth a nauy to take those Tartarians, which so confusedly ordered that enterprise, that the Tartarians found meanes to make themselues maisters of their enemies nauie, and therewith to saile away. Marcus Paulus reporteth like things of their idola∣trous Religion, as you haue heard: of Idoles with heads of Oxen, Hogs, and Dogs, and other deformed shapes: and some with many hands, as a testimony of their great power. The enemies which they tooke in warre, not able to redeeme themselues, he saith they did eate in solemne Feasts: He addeth, that in the Iaponian language Man∣gi was called Cin: as now it is Cina or China. I haue presumed to adde a peece of a Letter of Quabacondonus to the Viceroy of In∣dia, which after other things hath these words. Iapon is the kingdome of Chamis, whom we esteeme to be the same with Scin, which is the beginning of all things. This Scin is the substance and very being of all things: and all things are one and the same with Scin, and into Scin are resolued, which in Scina is called Iutto; and in Tescincu, Buppo. In the obseruation of the Lawes of this Chamis, consisteth all the politique gouernement of Iapon, both inward and outward, &c. The king Hen.Cuyckius of Bungo, Arima, and Omur sent their Ambassadours to the Pope (then Gregorie the thirteenth) with Letters of their deuotion to his Holinesse, and had audience in the Consistorie the three and twentieth day of March Anne 1585. This was the Iesuites policie (saith Linsc.li.i.c.26 Linschoten) to make the Iaponites to know the magnificence of Europe, & by that meanes principally to enrich themselues with gifts and priuiledges. But for a farewell to these Iaponian Iesuites, I like their being there so well, that I could wish all of that society in Europe were preaching in that Iland. Touching the kingdome of Iapan, we can not set downe the number and order of their Kings in auncient times. It seemeth, that these last eight hundred yeres they haue beene much disquieted with ciuile warres; euery one getting as many shires or king∣domes, which in Iapan are three score and six, as he could. Nabunanga was a great Prince; and Quabacondonus a greater: both great tyrants. This last caused his Ne∣phew to be made Quabacondono, contenting himselfe with the title of Taicosama; but soone after, iealous of his greatnesse, hee forced him (after the Iaponian maner) with his companions, to kill himselfe. He hauing no children but one infant, when he was sicke and neare to death, sent for Gieiaso the chiefe of the Iaponian Nobles, Lord of eight kingdomes, and made him administrator of the kingdome till his sonne should be of age; and further to binde him hereunto, he made a marriage betwixt Gieiasoes nece, two years old, and this infant of his about the same age, causing the same pre∣sently to be consummated. He took an othe of him, & the other nobles for their fealty to his sonne. But after his death there arose Arth.Dantis.bist. Ind.Orient.cap.28. great contentions, which Gieiaso (now calling himselfe Darsusama) appeased, and after some battells against his aduersaries, inuested  the Empire, Anno 1601. This hee did then in yong Taicosamas name  hath seized the Empire fully to himselfe. And calling himselfe Cub  (as the later Epistles testifie) hath entituled his own sonne to the Iapon . And for that cause fortifieth himselfe in Quato, one of his aunci∣ent and in Gieudo a towne thereof, at the charge of his subiects, of
which Epist.Iapon.1606. & 1607 he hath had at once there working continually, from Februarie to September, three hundred thousand: hee hath raised strong fortifications, and ruleth with great policie, none daring to molest him. CHAP. XVI. Of the Philippina's. IT is already shewed, that those Ilands receiued this name of Philip the second, King of Spaine, and that this name sometime is in a large sense attributed to all these Ilands in those huge Seas, but more properly to those which Legaspi discouered in the yere 1564, and where the Spa∣niards haue since that time had some places of abode: Mendenao, Ten∣daya, Luzon, and their neighbours, lying farre into the Sea before Cauchin-China & Cambaia, betwixt the seuenth degree and the twentith of Norther∣ly latitude. They are G.Bot.Ben. many in number, some of them very great, rich in rice, hony, fruits, birds, beasts, fishes, gold: and enriched further with trade from China. Seuen∣tie of these Ilands are subiects or friends to the Spaniards. Of ancient time they were subiect to the Chinois, Discourse of China. vntill they did voluntarily relinquish them: the cause of much ciuile warre amongst themselues, that Anarchy prouing worse to them than a Tyran∣ny, or rather the worst tyranny, euery man becomming a Tyrant, and as he had means of wit, strength and followers, preying vpon others, vsing or selling them for slaues: which their diuisions made an easie way to the Spanish Conquest. They worshipped the Sunne and Moone, and the men and women, which in their language they called Maganitos, obseruing in their honour solemne and sumptuous feasts. In the Illocos they worshipped the Deuill, and offered to him many sacrifices in recompence of a great quantity of gold, which they said he had giuen them. Their Feasts and Sacrifices were done by women, which were Witches (of them called Hol∣goi) reuerenced amongst them as Priests. These had ordinary talke with the Deuill, and many times in publique. These wrought strange witchcrafts; they answered vn∣to all questions that were demaunded of them: (although their answers were often either lies or riddles) they used lottes as the Chinois, and were obseruers of times. If they beganne a iourney, and met with a Lizard or other worme, they would returne home, saying, the heauens prohibited their proceeding. They haue now amongst them many Preachers and Monasteries of the Augustini∣ans, Franciscans, and Iesuitcs. But the wicked life of the Spaniards is so offensiue to the Inhabitants, that the Discourser (himselfe a Frier) telleth heereof a notable Storie. Pag.349. A certaine Ilander soone after his baptisme, died, and appeared after to many of his Countrey-men, perswading them to be baptized, as a way vnto that happines, where∣of he now had in himselfe most blessed experience: Onely they must be baptized, and obserue the Commaundements, of which the Spaniards preached to them, of whom, and of others like vnto them, there were in that happy place infinite numbers. Here p∣on he vanished, and some were perswaded: but others of them refused, saying; that be∣cause there were Spaniard-souldiers in glory, they would not go thither, because they would not be in their company. A like History Bartholom de las Casas Crudel.Hisp. relateth of a Westerne Indian, at the time of his death answering to a Dominicke Ftier, which counselled him to die a Christian, and so to be capable of heauen: (when hee heard there were Spaniards in heauen) he would rather be in hell with his fore fathers then in heauen with the Spaniards. The Spaniards Francis. Vaz 1601. haue their Bishop and Archdecon, and besides other Religious, seuen Colledges of Iesuites. Boterus G.B.B.part 4. lib.3. saith, that the King of Spaine had thought to haue made Manilla an Archibishopricke, & added three other Bishoprickes. Captaine
Noort Noort 1600. (a Dutch man that compassed the world) lost a ship heere in fight with the Spa∣niards, & suncke one of theirs: he affirmes that the conuerts of these parts, are more po∣pishly Christian then in the midst of Rome or Spaine, and more addicted to their su∣perstitious follies. In Mendenao they are Mahumetans, as they are in Burnco. In these Philippina's Tho.Candish voyage, Hak. tom. 3. some carue and cut their skinne, with sundry strakes and de∣uises all ouer their body. Moreouer, as we haue spoken of Balls worne in their yards, by the men of Pegu, so here, the men and men-children amongst them haue nayles of tinne thrust quite through the head of his priuy part, being split in the lower end, and riueted, which is done when they be yong, and the place groweth vp againe, without any great paine. They take it out, and put it in as occasion serueth. This here, as that in Pegu, is said to haue bin practised, to auoyde the sinne of Sodomy, whereto before they were prone. The males also are (at least in On the Ile Capul. some of the Philippina's) circum∣cised. The people worshippe the deuill, who oft times appeareth to them in confe∣rence, in most vgly and monstrous shape. There is amongst them an Iland of Negro's inhabited with blacke people, almost as bigge as England, in nine degrees. Heere also be those Ant.Galuano blacke people called Ospapuas, Man-eaters and Sorcerers, among whom Deuills walke familiarly, as Companions. If these wicked spirites find one alone, they kill him, and therefore they alwayes vse company. Their Idoles they adorne with Ostrich feathers. They vse to let themselues bloud with a certaine hearb laid to the member, and licked with the tongue: with which they can drawe out all the bloud in their body. When as Magellan, first of all men, by the West discouered these Easterne Ilands, in the Ilands of Buthoan and Caleghan hee could learne no other Religion obserued amongst them, but that lifting vp their hands closed together, and their face towards heauen, they called on their God by the name of Abha. In Zubut (in token of friend∣ship) he and the king did let themselues bloud on the right arme, for so was their wont to confirme leagues of amity. The king had his skinne painted with a hote yron Pen∣sile: he and his people at Magellan's perswasion were baptized; and burned their I∣doles, which were made of hollow wood, with great faces and foure teeth, like bores∣tuskes in their mouthes; painted they were all ouer, but had only a fore-part, and no∣thing behinde. They weare in their yard a naile of gold. They had many wiues, but one princi∣pall. They obserued many Ceremonies in killing a hogge, in sacrifice, as it seemed, to the Sunne. After the sounding of their cimballs, and certaine cates set downe in plat∣ters, two olde women came forth with Trumpets or Pipes of Reede, and did reue∣rence to the Sunne, and then clothing themselues with sacred vestments, one of them put about her fore-head a haire-lace with two hornes, holding another haire∣lace or skarse in her hand, and so began to sound, daunce, and call vpon the Sunne, wherein she is followed by the other, both of them in this manner dauncing about th Hogge, which is there fast tyed. A. Pigasetta. in . The horned Beldame still muttereth certaine wordes to the Sunne, and the other answereth her: then doth shee take a cuppe of Wine, and after some Ceremonies, poureth it on the Hogge: and after that with a launce, after dances and flourishes, she killeth the Hogge. All this while a litle Torch is burning, which at last she taketh into her mouth, and biteth it: and the other wo∣man washeth the Pipes with the swines bloud, and with her finger, embrewed with bloud, marketh the forehead of her husband first, and then of the rest. Then doe they vntire themselues, and onely with women associates, ate the cheere in the platters: and after singe the Hogge, and eate him. From hence Magellan went to Mathan, where in a battell with the Ilanders he was slaine. In Puladan they keep Cockes for the Game, but eate not of their flesh, forbid∣den by their superstitions. In Ciumbubon they found a tree, which had leaues like those of the Mulbery, hauing besides on each side of the leafe, as it were, two feete, with which (as if it had bin mouing and sensible) it would stirre and go vp and downe. Pigafetta kept one eight dayes in a platter, and when he rouched it, presently it would lee from him, and moue vp and downe: he thought it liued of the aire.
In Burneo the people are, partly Moores, & partly Gentiles, and according to their Religions, haue two Kings and two royall Cities, situated in salt-water. The Moores when they kill a hen, or a goat, vse first certaine words to the Sunne. The Gentiles Mas. Transil. worship the Sunne and Moone, esteeming the one Male and the other Female, him the Father, this the Mother of the Starres, whom also they reckon in the Catalogue of their demi-gods. They salute the Sunne in his morning-approch, with certaine verses and adoration: which they also performe to the Moone, and demaund of them chil∣dren, riches, and other their necessaries. After death they expect no future state. The Spaniards heard of great Pearles, as bigge as egges, which the King of Burneo had: and if you beleeue them, they tooke an Oyster themselues, whose fishie substance weighed seuen and fortie pounds. The Moore-King in Burneo was serued in his Pal∣lace and attended onely by women and maidens. In Gilolo Pigafetta. they are likewise some of the Arabian Sect, the others Gentiles. The Moores had two kings of their law, each of which had six hundred children. The Gen∣tiles vsed to worship the first thing they encounter in the morning all the day follow∣ing. They Got. rthus pag.396. were sometime man-eaters; some of the Ilanders were by the Portugalls conuerted: but the King being poysoned by a Mahumetan, they declined. Yet one Noble man named Iohn, first killed his wife and children with his own hands, left they should apostatize, and then offered himselfe to indure any torment. The Moluccos are vsually reckoned (as before is said,) but many other Ilands are subiect to them, and by some Authors called also by that name. The King of Ternate is said Sir Fr. Drah. to haue seuenty Ilands vnder his subiection, and in his port representeth great maiesty. Both here and in Banda the Mahumetan superstition hath set footing, and preuailed, as in the other adioyning Ilands, the Moores being as zealous to winne Proselites, as to enrich themselues. None of these Ilands is aboue sixe leagues in com∣passe, enriched with cloues, but of other fruits barren and poore. One Mass.libr. 5. tree they haue, which out of the cut braunches yeeldeth a white, holesome, and fauourie li∣quor for drinke, they call it Tuaca, and the pith thereof affoordeth them meate called Sagu, tasting in the mouth like sowre Curds, melting like Sugar, whereof they make certaine Cakes, which will endure good for foode tenne yeares. The cloue-trees not onely sucke vp all the moysture of the Earth, where they grow, disdaining any other plant should grow neere them (like our Inclosers) sodainely drinking vp all the hea∣uens liberality in showers, but with their thirstie appetite intercept the running wa∣ters that descend from the Mountaines, before they can betake them to their mothers lappe, the Oceans refuge. In this Iland Galuan. are men hauing anckles with spurres, like to Cockes; here are hogges with hornes: a riuer stored with fish, and yet so hote, that it flaicth of the skinne of any creature which entreth it: there are Oisters so large, that they christen in the shells: Crabbes so strong, that with their clawes they will breake the yron of a picke-axe: stones which grow like fish, whereof they make lime. In Ternate Iac. is a mountaine, which (as it were) angry with Nature, for being fast∣ned to the earth, doth not onely lift vp his high head aboue the airy regions of clouds, but endeuoreth also to conioyne it selfe with the fiery Element, where with it seemeth to hold some entercourse, with dreadfull thunders belching out light flames, mixed with a darke smoake, like prowd Greatnesse, wasting it selfe with it owne flames, and filling the neighboring-valley with ashes, It is not much aboue a hundred yeres, since first the Sect of Mahumet entred the Moluccas. But now Lud.Fernand. La.Masonius. both heere and in Amboi∣no the Iesuites haue their residences, and haue perswaded many to their Catholike faith. Stephan Got. Arthus pag 403. ab Hagan in the yeare 1605. wanne this Iland of Amboino, and the fort of the Portugals, to the States: it is a cloue-Iland. Much conflict was sometime betweene the kingdomes of Spaine and Portugall, a∣bout these Ilands: and some warre since betwixt. the Portugalls and Hollanders, en∣ded with the Hollanders losse. These Moluccians are treacherous, faithlesse and iea∣lous: they suffer no man to see their wiues; yea themselues see not their wiues vntill they be contracted. In Ternate Holland Na∣uig. 1598. & 99: per Bilibald. Strobe Theft is neuer suffered vnpunished: the Hollanders sawe a boy of e∣leuen
or twelue yeares, for stealing a leafe of Tabacco, led vp and downe with his hands bound behinde him, for a publique spectacle and derision to other boyes. They maintaine deadly warres with the Portugalls, and spare none of them that they can get. If an Eclipse of the Sunne or Moone happen, they howle and make piteous la∣mentation, perswading themselues, that their King, or some great man amongst them will die. Experience thereof was the sixt of August 1599. when the Moone was eclip∣sed about eight of the clocke at night, they euery way by crying out, by strange ge∣stures, praying, and beating their basons and drummes, expressed a lamentable passion of griefe, for the feare aforesaid. And the Eclipse being past, when they see, that nei∣ther the King, nor any other is dead, they obserue the next day solemnly festiuall with publike Procession of old and yong, of all sorts. They esteemed it a Miracle when the Hollanders told them that there were in their Country which could prognosticate of Eclipses long before. Columbus Gas.Ens li. I. ca. 5. vsed the simplicity of the Iamaicans to his preserua∣tion: for when they forsooke him he threatned vnto them the anger of GOD, where∣of they should see an euident token in the darkening of the Moone within two daies, which according to the naturall reuolution of the Heauens (knowne to Columbus) comming to passe, the Ilanders with dread and feare shewed all readinesse to his ser∣uice. The water about Ternate is so cleare, that they fish by the eie, and can see the An∣kers in the bottome of the water, at sixteene or seuenteene fadome depth, as if it were but a foote: and espie euerie fish which passeth, to no small aduantage of their fishing. When the King goeth to the Mesquit, a boy goeth before, which beareth his Sword on his shoulder, and in the other hand a kidde: after him follow the kings souldiors. After them another with a Censer. Next to whom commeth the King with a Tiresol ouer his head, to keepe off the Sunne. When they are come to the dores, there are Vessels of water to wash their hands and feete, before they enter; and then the floore is couered with white Cloth, whereon they prostrate them∣selues, with their faces to the Earth, softly mumbling their Mumpsimus-deuotions. In the middest is a Pulpit, spread with white Cloth. In stead of a Bell they haue a great Drumme hanged vp, which they beat with clubbes: They haue in euery Temp∣le also one Bell, but without a Clapper. All come at that Peale, or Sound, with their weapons armed. The Moluccians Iat Neccij Nauig.in octaua part. Ind. orient. de Bry. are better proportioned then other Indians, haue more beard (which the elder men nourish and weare long for their greater authoritie) browne of colour, and meane of stature. For valour they haue not their like in all India, es∣pecially those of Ternate, chusing rather to die then flee, and esteeming it a great credit to fight against greater multitudes. Their shields are of Wood, two spannes broad, and foure foote long. They are exceedingly addicted to slouth and ease, none working in any handicraft; their houses are of timber and reedes, without one naile in them, which their slaues build, and doe also their other labors. They haue no mo∣ney, and the siluer which they haue is employed to vessells of plate. Their riches are their Cloues, wherewith they prouide them of other necessities. They neuer see their wiues till they be married; nor the wiues them. Makian and Moher are now subiect to the king of Ternate: Tidore and Batian haue their peculiar kings. This people haue the power to elect their king, so that they choose one of the royall and ancient fami∣lie. The king of Ternate calleth himselfe king of Golilo, whereof he hath but a part, and that by conquest. The Birds of Paradise (saith this Author) haue two feet, aswell as other Birds; but as soone as they are taken, they are cut off, with a great part of their body, whereof a little is left with the head and necke, which beng hardned and dried in the Sunne, seeme to be so bred. The Moores Pigsetta. made the Ilanders beleeue that they came out of Paradise, and therefore call them Manucodiata, or holie Birds, and haue them in religious accompt: They are very beautifull, with variety of fethers and colours. Amboyna bringeth forth Orenges, Citrons, Limons, Cloues, Coquos, Bonana's, sugar-canes, and other fruits, being a very fertile Iland. The Inhabitants are simple,
liue sparingly, and are attyred like other the Moluccans. They spend much Rice, whereof they make loaues like Sugar-loaues. They haue Gallies Nauig. Hol∣land,.per. B. Strobaeum. De Bry, part.5. Ind. Or. hath the pictures of these Gallies, &c. after their manner, formed like Dragons, which they row very swiftly: they call them Karkollen. The Admirall came to the Hollanders with three of these, full of armed men, which row∣ed round about them, expressing manifold signes of ioy with Songs and Drummes: the slaues singing as they rowed. They had three pieces of Ordinance in euerie Galley, which they discharged, answered in that kinde by the Hollanders. But two of the Holland-shippes not finding sufficient store of commodities for them all, went to Banta, passing by Poel Setto, an Island not inhabited, bearing Northwest from Banta fiue Dutch myles. They say it is inhabited of Deuils, and whosoeuer must passe by, maketh all possible hast to be gone, much affrighted either by selfe-fancies or deuillish impostures. Banta is foure and twentie Dutch myles from Amboyna and diuided into three parts, which comprehend fiue myles. The chiefe Citie is Nera. In this Island are more store of Nutmegs then elsewhere in the Moluccas: for which cause they resort hither from Iaua, China, and Malacca. They professe Mahumetisme so deuoutly, that they neuer goe to their Watches before they haue prayed in the Mesquit, where∣into they enter, being first washed (after the Mahumetane manner) but pray so loud, that they may be heard a great distance: their wordes of Prayer are Stofferolla; Stofferolla; Ascehad an la, Ascehad an la; Ylla, Ascehad an la; Yll lolla. yll lolla, Mahumed die Rosulla: At the pronouncing of which last wordes, they stroke their hands ouer their face; in which gesture they thinke is much holinesse. Other prayers they mutter ouer very softly, with little mouing their lippes. THey stand vp∣on Mattes, and lift vp their eyes twice or thrice to Heauen: after which, they kneele downe, bowing their head twice or thrice to the earth. Thus they doe often euerie day, both at home and in the streets. They haue their publike Meetings and Bankets in their Temples very often, euery one bringing his part of the cheere: which some∣times they doe in the Woods, a hundred in a companie. At these times they consult of publike affaires. They haue ciuill Warres, Nera and Lontoor holding together against three other Townes. Two little Islands, Pollerviin and Poelvuay take part with Nera, and when occasion requireth, come thither with their Boats to consultation, where they are entertained in publike Feasts: the manner whereof is, that they sit downe in order; in stead of a Table euery one hath a piece of a leafe of the Bonanas Tree: then is set before each a piece of Sagu bread, after that, a dish made of the leafe of another Tree, with a little sodden Rice and Flesh-pottage, which they hurle by hand∣fulls into their mouthes, deuouring rather then eating the same. In the meane while the Gentlemen arise with their weapons, and exercise themselues in marti∣all Games, with Daunces. The quarrell betwixt these Islanders grew about the cutting of certaine Trees, from whence it is come to cut and kill one another with cruell butcheries. They exercise Sea-fights in their Caracorae, or Galeots, with great dexteritie, with great shouts and cryes, the Gentlemen dauncing on the Hatches very actiuely. They are very bloudie and barbarous, yet burie the heads of their enemies with sweet odours. If any of their friends die, the women made a shrill and loud crie to call him a∣gaine; which not effected, they prouide a great Feast, whereunto all the kindred and friends are inuited. They burie them almost after our fashion, in a white sheet, the corpes being carried on mens shoulders, the men first, and women after, following. A Cen∣ser is there left fuming all the day and night; and in the night they keepe a light burning in a little House, which they haue set ouer the Graue. In the morning and euening all of all sorts come and say their Prayers a long while together at the Graue: and being asked wherefore? they said, That the dead should not arise againe.
They haue a play with the ball, exercised by many of them, not as amongst vs with the hand, but with their feet, tossing the same vp into the Ayre, and taking it one of a∣nother with admirable sleight. Before we leaue these Moluccas and their dependant Islands, we may conclude with a Tragedie, wherein blinde Superstition, and beastly crueltie, were principall Actors. When Menesius Art. Hist. Ind. Orient.c. 46. was Gouernour of the Portugall Fort in Ternate, he kept a Sow, which some of the deuouter Mahumetans killed. He getting the chiefe Priest (acces∣sorie to the fact) into the Castle, at his deliuerie made his face be greased with Bacon by the Iaylor, which caused the people to offer abuse to some Portugalls. Menesius in reuenge cut off the hands of two of them, the third had his hands bound behind him, and was baited with two dogges on the Sea-shore: which his implacable ene∣mies transported him into like dogged humour (though he were not with Hcuba transformed into the shape) insomuch, that fastening with his teeth on one of their eares, he held fast, till his strength failing, he sunke into the Sea with the dogge, and was drowned. In Celebes they Od. Barbosa. eate mans flesh. Hak..3 The King of the Moluccas was wont to send condemned persons to Celebes, to be deuoured. Castrius conuerted the King. South∣ward of Celebes is situated a little Island, where Sir Francis Drake graued his shippe. This Island is throughly growne with Woods, in which euery night cer∣taine fierie Flyes made such a light, as if euery twigge or tree had beene a burning Candle. Here they found Battes as bigge as Hennes, and plentie of Cray-fishes so great, that one would suffice foure men to their dinner: they digged themselues holes in the Earth, like Conies. From hence they sayled to Iaua; of which name M. Paulus and Nic. di Conti re∣kon two great Islands, ascribing to the one two thousand, and to the other three thou∣sand myles in circuit. The lesse is neere to the firme Land of the South Continent, where Beach, and some other Prouinces, are named by Paulus and Vertomannus, of Heathenish Superstitions. The lesse Iaua had in the dayes of M. Paulus eight King∣domes, in six of which himselfe had beene, which he nameth Felech, wherein the ru∣rall inhabitants were Idolaters, the Citizens Moores: the Idoll-worshippers eare any flesh whatsoeuer, of man, or beast, and obserue all day what they first see in the mor∣ning. Basma M. Paul. l. 3. the second, acknowledged the great Chams Soueraigntie, but payed him no tribute. Here were certaine Vnicornes, headed like a Swine, footed like an Ele∣phant, with one ore on their forheads (with which they doe not hurt any, but to that end vse certaine prickles that grow on their tongues;) They delight also in the Myre like Swaine. Here are little Apes, much resembling men in their countenance, which they vsed to preserue with certaine Spices, hauing flayed off their skinnes, and left the haire growing in those parts, where Nature causeth men to be hairie, and fell them to Merchants, to be carried ouer the world as the bodies of little men; happily the onely true Pygmies the world yeeldeth. In Samara, the third of those Kingdomes, none of the North-starres can be seene. They are Man-eaters, and Idolaters; but not so brutish as in Dragoian, the next King∣dome: where, if a man be sicke, his kinsmen consult with their Sorcerers, who enquire of the Deuill, Whether he shall escape, or no? And if the answere be Negatiue, they send for certaine men, specially designed to that villanous Mysterie, which strangle him; and then they dresse and eate him amongst the kindred, euen to the very marrow in his bones. For (say they) if any flesh should remaine, it would putrifie, and wormes would breede thereof, which after (for want of sustenance) would perish, whereby the soule of the dead partie would be much tonnented. The bones they burie safely, that no Beast should touch them: such dread haue they of Beasts and crueltie in a more then beastly crueltie, and such a care to obserue humanitie nd pietie in a most impious inhumanitie. Lambri, the next Kingdome, hath in it some men with tayles, like dogges, a spanne long.
The last is Fanfur, where they liue of bread made of the pith of Trees, the wood whereof is heauie, and sinketh to the bottome, if it be put in water, like yron, and therefore they make Launces thereof, able to pierce Armour: for it is three-fingers thicke betwixt the hollow and the barke. To let passe Pentan, Sondar, and other idolatrous Islands, and come to Iaua Maior: This Countrey is very rich, but in times past of most abhominable custome. di Conti. Nic. Conti sayth, That they seede on Cats, Rats, and other vermine, and were most vile murthe∣rers, not sticking to make tryall of the good cutting or thrust of their blades on the next bodie they met with, and that without punishment, yea (if the blow or' thrust were deliuered with fine force) with much commendation. Vertomannus Ver. l.6. affirmeth of them, That some obserue Idols, some the Sunne or Moone, others an Oxe, and ma∣ny the first thing they meet in the morning, and some worship the Deuill. When men were old, and not able longer to work, their children or parents carried them into the market, and sold them to others, which did eate them. And the like they vsed with the younger sort in any desperate sicknesse, preuenting Nature with a violent death, and esteeming their bellies sitter sepulchres then the earth, accounting others fooles which suffered the wormes to deuoure so pleasant foode. For feare of these man-eaters they stayed not long there. It seemeth that they haue much left these bruitish customes, since wonne to more ciuilitie by the trading of Moores and Christians; especially such as are of the Arabian Law: although, as our owne countreymen report, which haue there liued, a mans life is valued to the murtherer at a small summe of mony. They are a proud Nation: Scot. If a man should come in where they are set on the ground after their manner, & should sit on a Chest, or high thing, it were as much as his life were worth. When they are sicke, Gio. Bot.Ben. they vow vnto GOD, vpon their recouerie, a more honoura∣ble death, which they performe after their recouerie, by the murtherous hand of some other vpon them. They are Od.Barbosa. great Inchanters, and obserue houres, and sitting minutes and moments of time, for composing their Blades and Armour, of which they are con∣ceited, that, being tempered with their Charmes and Superstitions, with the least drawing bloud of another, they will kill him; themselues, in their inchanted Armour, safe from others blowes. They abide in expectation of these Martiall minutes, for their coniured Armours, sometimes eight or tenne yeares, before they can finish them. The Iauans Bar. dec.2.l.9. ca. Holland. Nau. Arthus. Isacius & . say, That their auncestors came from China, which Countrey they for∣sooke, because of the tyranuie where with they were oppressed, & in great multitudes peopled this Island. They weare their haire and their nailes long. They are dutifull to their superiors. The great men stire not forth, without a great troupe of followers. They are seldome idle, much busied about their Scabberds and Weapons, which they vse to poyson. They are not without their weapons night or day, which they will not suffer another man to touch. They are so eager of reuenge, that they will presse on their aduersaries weapon, drawing it through their owne bodie, to kill him that hath wounded them. They haue Mahumetane Temples, where they doe their deuotions with great silence. They acknowledge IESVS, Mahomet, Dauid, and Moses foure Prophets. They obserue their houres, and two Fasts, or Lents. The great mens wiues neuer goe out of the dores to be seene. Their Cities are Ballambua, and Panarucan, (a little from whence is a burning Hill, which first brake forth 1586, and oppressed infinit numbers of men, and cast great stones into the Citie, for three daies space making one continued night of darknesse) Passarua, the King whereof married the King of Ballam∣buas daughter, and the second night after he had lyen with her, slew her and her atten∣dants, because she would not turne Mahumetan. Ioartam, Surrabaia, Tuban, Matara, are also royall Cities, as are Daunia, Taggal, Charabaon, and many others. But Bantam is of most trafficke, frequented by Portugalls, Dutch, and English, in which euery day are three seuerall Markets. Here Merchants, when they come, may buy a woman for their leshly & worldly businesse (you may adde the Deuill too, to make vp the nūber) which at their departure they fell againe. Publike affaires are treated and handled by night, at which time the Counsellors of State meet, & ascend some tree, or the roofe of the house, viewing the heauens till the Moon arise, & then goe into the Senat-house.
Not farre from Bantam Io.Isac.Pon∣tan . ∣stelodam. Nau. Batah. 1594.ap. De Bry, part.3.c.33. liue certaine of the Passarrans, which being there oppres∣sed by their King, came hither, and here obtained a piece of ground, to build them a Citie, which is called Sura. They haue a King, or Gouernour, and liue quietly, fol∣lowing Husbandrie: they eate nothing that hath life (a common Superstition of the Indians) weare white Clothes of Paper, made of the leaues of Trees, and neuer mar∣rie (herein resembling the Iewish Essees) yet neuer want succeeding generation: Many of the Iauans daily consecrating themselues vnto their Societie. The Chinois in Iaua doe sometimes bring vp Crocodiles, and eat them. The King of Tuban Bilib. Strobaus is the richest King, and mightiest in all Iaua. They haue ma∣ny Horses, and make great account of them, decking them with gallant furniture of Gold, Siluer, and the counterfeits of Dragons and Deuils on their Saddles: they ride and manage their Horses with great skill. Madura is North from Iaua, a fertile Island of Rice, the soyle whereof is so moist and waterish, that their Buffalls and men goe almost knee-deepe, when they sow it. Arosbay is the chiefe Citie. They are theeuish, and giuen to spoyle, and captiued ma∣ny of the Hollanders, which went thither on shore, to buy commodities; which they were forced to redeeme at a deere rate. In these parts, are Battes as bigge as Hennes, which the people rost and eate. The Island Bali is very populous, containing (as is thought) sixe hundred thousand inhabitants; they are Ethnikes, and worship that which they first meete in the mor∣ning. Here and in Pulo Rossa the women are burned with their dead husbands: one man is said Nauig. Bat. 1594.c.39. to haue had fiftie of his wiues (for they marrie as many as they please) bur∣ned with him, whiles the Hollanders were there. The Island hath many Buls, Buffals, Goats, Swine, Horse, with many kindes of Fowles, Fruits, and Mettalls: The chiefe men are carried by slaues on seats borne on their shoulders, or else in Chariots drawne with Buffalls. In the Voyage of M. Thomas Candish Th. Candish. Hak. 10.3.pag.822. is mention made of a Iauan King, called Raia Balombam, very aged, which had a hundred wiues, and his sonne had fiftie. Their custome is, that when the King dieth, they burne the bodie, and preserue the ashes. Fiue dayes after the wiues of the dead King goe to a place appointed, and there shee which was deerest in his fauour, throweth a ball from her; and where that ball resteth, thither they goe all, and turning their faces Eastward, stabbe themselues with a Crise or Dagger to the heart. They are very resolute people, and dread no at∣tempt which the King shall enioyne them, be it neuer so dangerous. All the race of this King Ballamboam was rased and vtterly destroyed by the Passarvan, after a long siege: which Warre was begun in the bloud of the King of Ballamboams daugh∣ter, whome hee slew, as is before sayd, and added this Drunkennesse vnto his thirst. Iortam, or Ioartam Nnig. Oliuer Noort. containeth about a thousand households. The inhabitants are Ethnikes, and haue their Temples in Woods, to which they resort to say and doe their Holies at noone, before their deformed Deuill-formed Pagodes. In this Citie dwelleth the chiefe Pope, or High-Priest, of that Superstition, whose autho∣ritie is great in all those parts. He was a hundred and twentie yeares old, and had many wiues which nourished him with their milke, being not able to take o∣ther sustenance: a deadly enemie to the Christians, whome the King did yet with some Priuiledges fauour.
CHAP. XVII. Of Samatra, and Zeilan. SAmatra is esteemed by some Gi. Bot. Ben. Mass.l.4 O.Arthus Hist. Indiae Orient.cap.0. the greatest of the Easterne Islands, stretching it selfe almost seuen hundred miles in length, in breadth a∣boue two hundred. The Ayre is not very holesome, by reason of the situation vnder the Line, and the multitude of Lakes and Riuers, whereout the Sunne drinketh more then hee can well concoct, and therefore (as it were) belcheth out here continually such crude and vn∣digested vapours. Their foode is Millet, Rice, Sagu, and Fruits. Their riches are Pep∣per, Ginger, Cassia, Silke, Benioyn, Gold, Tinne, Yron, &c. The Kingdome of Campa is full of Trees, whose pith or marrow is Aloe, which is prized in India at the like weight (some say) of Gold; the Barke is called Aquila. In the Sea-coast they are Moores in Religion, and so haue beene about these last two hundred yeares: vp with∣in Land they are Pagans, and in many places, as in the Kingdomes of Andragiri and Aru, they are Man-eaters. They were diuided, before the Portugalls entred India, in∣to nine and twentie Kingdomes, whereof the chiefe was Pedir, after that Pacem, and now Acem. For Abram, sometime a slaue, since King of Acem, hath conquered al∣most all the North part of the Island, and with helpe from the Turke and the Arabians distresseth sometimes the affaires of Malacca. This King Linscht. gaue in marriage with his daughter, to the King of Ior, a peece of Ordinance, such as for greatnesse, length, and workmanship can hardly be matched in all Christendome. Here is a P. Bertius Tab. Hill, called Balalvanus, which continually burneth; and a Fountaine (as is reported) which run∣neth pure Balsame: Others Ortel. Maff.l.4. thinke, that this was Chersonesus Aurea, of the Aun∣ients. Galvanus Discoueries of the world. writeth, That the Bacas, or Man-eaters, in the Mountaines of Samatra, gild their teeth, and esteeme the flesh of blacke people sweeter then of the white. The flesh of their Kine, Buffes, and Hennes, is as blacke as Inke. They say, That there are certaine people there called Daragni Dara, which haue tayles like to Sheepe. Here is said also to grow a Tree, the iuice whereof is strong poyson, and if it touch the bloud of a man, killeth him, but if a man drinke of it, it is a soueraigne Antidote. As for those tailed-people (a slander by Beckets Legend See Lamberts perambul. reported of some Kentish men, iniurious to that angrie Saint, and after applyed to our whole Nation; many indeede esteeming the English to be tayled) Galvano affirmeth, That the King of Tidore told him, that in the Islands of Batto-China there were some which had tayles, hauing also a thing like vnto a dugge betweene their coddes, out of the which there came Milke. Nicolo di Conti N.di Conti. sayth, in his time the Samatrans were all Gentiles, and the Man∣eaters amongst them used the skulls of their eaten enemies in stead of money, exchan∣ging the same for their necessaries; and he was accounted the richest man, which had most of those skulls in his house. In Vertomannus time they had money in Pedir, narked on the one side with a Deuill, on the other with a Chariot, drawne with Ele∣phants. Their L. Vert. Religion (hee sayth) is the same with those of Tarnasseri, burning heir wiues in like manner. The inhabitants are cunning Artificers, Marchants, and Saylers: their Shippes haue at each end a Prow, which with maruellous agilitie they can dispose forwards, or backwards, making vse of the same, according to he diuersitie of Winde and Channell, which there are verie changeable. In Acen Herman. de Bree. Arthus pag.359 are Mesquits of Timber and Reede, with the Vessells of Water at the entrie for them to wash, according to the Arabian custome. The King comes little a∣broad, nor may any goe to him, except hee bee sent for by an Officer with a gilded Staffe, or Dagger.
To his Palace they passe through seuen Gates one after another, garded with wo∣men, expert at their weapon, and vsing both Peeces and Swords. Hee hath none o∣ther gard for his person. In saluting the King, they lay their hands foulded on their head, which in other salutations they lay on the forhead. It is thought, that the pre∣sent King was sometime a Fisherman. He is a Mahumetan. In Macazar (an Island not farre from the former) the most are Ethnickes, some also Moores, and some Christians. They vse the Malaican, or Malaian, Tongue, which is generall through the Indies. Their Arrow-heads are of Fish-bones, enueno∣med with incurable poyson. In Macazar the Priests conforme, or rather deforme, themselues to the fashion of women, nourishing their haire on the head, and plucking it out of the face: they guild their teeth, and vse broken, wanton, and effeminate ge∣stures. They are called Becos; they marrie one another. For them to lye with a wo∣man, is capitall, and is punished with burning in Pitch. These Men-monsters, Women-Deuills, were great impediments to the Portugalls, in drawing them to Christianitie. Zeilan (which some call Seylon, other Ceilan) is by Barrius auerred to be Ta∣probana: sometimes (according to M. Paul M. Paul. lib.3. his Reports) thought to haue compre∣hended three thousand sixe hundred myles in circuit; since much impaired by his ouer-mightie neighbour the Sea, which hath now left not aboue two hundred and fiftie myles in length, and a hundred and fortie of breadth vnto it. Barbosa. The Indians call it Tenarisim, or the delitious Land, and some are of opinion, that this was Para∣dise. So iust are the iudgements of the Highest, that, when as man wandered from him, caused him also to wander from himselfe, and from his habitation: yea, the place it selfe hath also wandered, in mens wandering conceits, ouer the World, yea, and out of our habitable World altogether, as before is shewed; men now seeking it as vain∣ly as before they lost it. It is in fashion Lib. 1. resembling an egge, by a shallow channell separated from the Cape Comori. The Heauens with their deawes, the Ayre with a pleasant holesomenesse and fragrant freshnesse, the Waters in their many Riuers and Fountaines, the Earth diuersified in aspiring Hills, Iow Vales, equall and indifferent Plaines, filled in her inward Chambers with Mettalls and Iewells, in her outward Court and vpper face stored with whole Woods of the best Cinnamon that the Sunne seeth, besides Fruits, Oranges, Leimons, &c. surmounting those of Spaine; Fowles and Beasts, both tame and wilde (among which is their Elephant Linschot. An. Corsali. , honoured by a natu∣rali acknowledgement of excellence, of all other Elephants in the world.) These all haue conspired and ioyned in common League, to present vnto Zeilan the chiefe of worldly treasures and pleasures, with a long and healthfull life in the inhabitants, to enioy them. No maruell then, if sense and sensualitie haue here stumbled on a Para∣dise. There, wooddie Hills (as a naturall Amphitheatre) doe encompasse a large Plaine: and one of them, as not contenting his beetle-browes with that only prospect, disdaineth also the fellowship of the neighbouring Mountaines, lifting Maff. 1.3. vp his steepe head seuen Leagues in height; and hath in the toppe a Plaine, in the middest whereof is a stone of two Cubits, erected in manner of a Table, holding in it the print of mans foote, who (they say) came from Deli thither, to teach them Religion. The Iogues and other deuout Pilgrims resort thither, from places a thousand Leagues di∣stant, with great difficultie of passage both hither and here. For they are forced to mount vp this Hill by the helpe of nailes and chaines fastened thereto. Nature hauing prohibited other passage. Maffoeus and Boterus could persuade themselues, that this foot-steppe is a relike and memorie of the Aethiopian Eunuch: others will haue it farther fet, and father it on Adam, the first father of mankinde, of whom the Hill also is named, Pico de Adam. The Moores Od.Barbosa. call it Adam Baba, and say, That from thence Adam ascended into Heauen. The Pilgrims are clad in their Palners-weed, with yron chaines, and skinnes of Lyons, and other wilde Beasts. Vpon their armes and legges they weare buttons with sharpe points, that cut the flesh, and draw bloud, which (they say) they doe in GODS seruice.
Before they come at the mountaine, they passe by a fenny valley full of water, wherein they wade vp to the waste, with kniues in their hands, to scrape from their legges the bloud-leeches, which else would end their pilgrimage and life before the time. For this durtie and watery passage continueth eighteene miles, before they come at the hill, whose proud top would disdaine climing, if Art did not captiue Nature, and binde the hill with chaines of iron, as is said. When they are mounted, they wash them in a lake or poole of cleere springing water, neere to that foote-stone, and ma∣king their prayers, doe thus account themselues cleane from all their sinnes. This holy iourney is generally performed by the Ilanders (saith Vertomannus) once a yeare. He addeth Vert..3.c.4. that a Moore told him, that his foot-print was two spannes long: and that Adam heere a long time bewailed his sinne, and found pardon. But Odo∣ricus affirmeth, that they reported this mourning to haue beene for Abel, and to haue lasted three hundred yeares, and of the teares of Abel and Eue this purifying water to haue proceeded: which Odoricus Odoricus. proued to be a tale, because he saw the water springing continually, and it runneth thence into the sea. He saith that this water had in it many precious stones; and the King gaue leaue at certaine times of the yeare to poore men to take them, that they might pray for his soule; which they could not doe, but first annointed with Limons, because of the horseleeches in that water. A∣dams hill is supposed to be seuen leagues in height. In Candy Her.de Bre. were statues artificial∣ly wrought fiue or sixe fathomes high, which these Symmetrians proportioned to the stature of Adam, gathered by that print of his foot. In Vintane, Georgius Spilbergins. is a Pagode or Idol-temple, the compasse whereof is an hundred and thirtie paces: it is very high, and all white except on the toppe, which hath the spires thereof gilded, in so much that men are not able, when the Sunne shineth, to looke thereon. It hath a Tower or square Steeple of excellent workmanshippe. There are many other Temples, and a Monasterie also of Religious persons, which are attired in yellow, haue their crownes shauen, with Beads in their hands, and alwayes seeme to mumble ouer somewhat of their deuout orisons, being in high estimation of san∣ctitie with the vulgar, and freed from publike labours and burthens. Their Monaste∣rie is built after the manner of the Popish, being also gilded with gold. In their Chap∣pells are many Images of both sexes, which they say represent some of their Saints: they are set on the Altars, and are cloathed with garments of gold and siluer. Before them are the Images of Boyes, which beare vp great Candle-stickes, with waxe-can∣dles burning therein night and day. Euery houre they resort to these Altars to their Mumpsimus. They held a solemne Procession, whiles the Hollanders were there, in which their Abbot rode on an Elephant richly attired, lifting vp his hands ouer his head, with a golden rodde therein: the Monkes went two and two before him in or∣der, partly bearing, and playing on many Instruments of Musicke, partly bearing wax∣lights and torches: the men also, and after them the women and maids, followed in like order: and the fairest Virgins were busied with games and dances, being naked from the nauell vpwards, beneath couered with smockes of diuers colours, their armes and eares adorned with gold and iewels. Any man that should see it (saith our Author) would thinke, our Westerne Monkes had hence borrowed their Ceremonies. Their Images are in euery corner of the way, which they adorne with flowers. In Candy, the chiefe Citie of that Kingdome, were Pagodes innumerable. The houses or Temples were of stone, like the Temples in these parts: some statues were as high as the mast of a shippe. The people heere, if they haue once touched meate, which for quantitie or qualitie they cannot eat, they cast it to the dogges: neither will any man (be he neuer so meane) eat that which another hath touched. The women goe naked from the waste vpwards. They marry as many wiues as they can keepe. The King makes vse of their superstition: For pretending to build Temples, hee after leaues them vnperfect, excusing himselfe, that they had not contributed suffici∣ent summes of money, and therefore exacteth a new. There is one statue of great sta∣ture, with a sword in his hand, which by illusion of the Diuell (if it be not the delusi∣on
of fabulous reports) made as though he would strike the King with his sword, as he was entering the Temple, and put him in great feare, whereas before he had made a mocke of it. The Singales or Natiue Inhabitants say that the world shall not pe∣rish as long as that Image continueth safe. When any one is sicke, hee sacrificeth to the Diuell, hauing a boxe hanging in his house to that end, therein to gather somewhat for his offering. Some pray vnto the Image of an Elephants head, made of wood or stone, that they may obtaine wisedome (whereof this prayer argues their great want): some eate no quicke creature. They eat no beefe, nor drinke any wine; they worship whatsoeuer first meeteth them in the morning. George Spilberge was bountifully entertained of the King of Candy, Herman. de Brec, ap.de Bry.part. 8.Ind. Or. but Sebald de Weert was with diuers of his companions slaine, after he had receiued much kind∣nesse of the King; his importunitie to get the King into his ship, making him suspect some treacherie. The King of Morecalo had eares adorned with iewels, and hanging downe (the lappets of them were so stretched) to his shoulders. He was kinde to the Hollanders: but they incensed him against them by killing certaine Kine; for some of them said, that the soules of Kine slaine after that manner, were hurled forthwith into hell. Hee obserued one Pagode, to whose feast he went while the Hollanders were there, the so∣lemnitie whereof was to continue ten dayes, till a new Moone, with great concourse of deuout persons. Of the superstitions of Perimal, and the worshippe of the Apes tooth, celebrated in this Iland; we haue alreadie shewed in the Chapter Chap. 10. of Narsinga. The Cinga∣lan language which they speake in this Iland, is G. Bot. Ben. thought to haue beene there left by the Chinois, sometimes Lords of Zeilan. Yet in M. Paulus his dayes the Tartari∣ans had not pierced thus farre. For the King then raigning, refused to sell to Cublai Can (then the greatest Monarch in the world) at a price, a Ruby which hee had left him by his Ancestours, esteemed the richest iewell in the world, being (as he Paul l. 3.c.19. saith) a spanne long, and as bigge as a mans arme, cleere and shining, as if it had beene a fire. In this Iland were reckoned nine Principalities or Kingdomes, but Linschoten. not long since their chiefe King was murthered by a Barber, who draue the other Kings out of the Countrey, and vsurped the Monarchie to himselfe, practising hostilitie against the Portugalls. The Cingalas are very cunning Artificers in all mettalls. One of them presented the Arch-bishoppe of Goa with a Crucifix, so cunningly wrought, as if he had gi∣uen life to the Image of one dead. Hee sent it to the King of Spaine as a rare iewell, not to be equalled in Europe. The Inhabitants heere are actiue and expert in Iugling, both men and women, trauelling through India with their strange Hobby-horses, to get money by this va∣nitie. The Sea-coast (as in other Indian Ilands) is inhabited with Moores, the Inland with Pagans. The Portugalls haue a fortresse at Colombo. The Ilanders Od. Barbosa. are not warriours: they giue themselues to pastime and pleasure: they goe naked from the girdle vp∣ward: they make wide holes in their eares, which they stretch out with the waight of their iewels to their shoulders. The Hollanders found exceeding, both good and bad, entertainment with the King of Candy. Now for that question, whether Zeilan or Samatra be that Tapro∣bane of the Ancient is very doubtfull. Yet that report in Pliny Plin.l.6.c.22. of Taprobane seemes more to encline for Zeilan. For hee saith, that in Claudius time, a seruant of Annius Plocamus, which was Customer for the Red-sea, was carried from the Coast of Arabia, besides Carmania, in fifteene dayes, which I thinke could not possi∣bly be done to Samatra. Likewise the excellencie of the Elephants beyond all the Indian agrees to Zeilan: and had Samatra beene so knowne at that time, the other parts of India (it is like) had beene better discouered then they were in those times. This Taprobane was discouered to bee an Iland, by Onesicritus, Alexanders Ad∣mirall
of his Fleet in these parts. It was then accounted another world, and therefore shall be the Period of our PILGRIMAGE, and Perambulation in this Part of the World: which (by the gracious goodnesse of his Almightie guide) the Pilgrime ha∣uing passed: before he venture vpon the Monster-breeding Africa, he thinkes it not amisse to repose himselfe in so pleasant an Iland; where he may at leisure looke backe, and view the ruines of so many mightie Monarchies, puissant Kingdomes, stately Ci∣ties, and renowned States, which by the wise, iust and prouident hand of the Dispo∣ser of Kingdomes, haue had their fatall Periods, and giuen place; some to Barbarisme, and some to their succeeding heires (sprung out of their ashes) flourishing in greater glorie then their predecessours. Heere may he likewise behold many beautious Nymphes (daughters of Asia) lif∣ting vp their Virgin-lookes to view the world: which, putting off their maskes (that haue heretofore veiled their beauties from the bright eye of fairer Europe) doe giue good hope of future discoueries in those parts, which yet lurke vnder that obscure cur∣taine of Terra Incognita. Acknowledging both in the one and the other (as the Al∣mighty power of him that brings all this to passe, so) his bountifull mercie to that land, which he hath separated from the rest of the world; not so much by a sea of wa∣ters, as by that boundlesse Ocean of his grace and fauour, from whence flow those eternall waters of life, which this Nation aboue other Nations enioyeth. Heere hath he built a Temple for his TRVTH, and planted Oliues round about it. Heere hath he crowned that TRVTH, with prosperitie and plentie of all things. Heere hath he decreed to establish that TRVTH, to be a faithfull witnesse on Earth, so long as the Sunne shall endure in Heauen; if the ingratitude of such people, so fauoured, doe not compell him to turne away his face in displeasure. Which fearefull Curse to auert, the Pilgrime doth againe betake him to his Beads: beseeching the LORD of Heauen and Earth, who doth whatsoeuer he will both in Heauen and in Earth, to turne away that wrath (which by manifold examples he hath warned vs of in other parts) which wee haue as deepely deserued as any. And that hee would still be pleased to lift vp the light of his louing countenance vpon vs, in vouchsafing vs that Saint (his Vna Veritas) to be our guide for euer. To that Saint is this voyage intended: which (af∣ter a Psalme 24.1. Domini est terra, and a Gloria Patri, for the conclusion of his Orisons) the Religious Traueller shall be readie to prosecute.
RELATIONS OF THE REGIONS AND RELIGI∣ONS IN AFRICA. OF AeGYPT, BARBARIE, NVMI, DIA, LIBYA, AND THE LAND OF NEGROS; AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS. THE SIXT BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of AFRICA, and the Creatures therein. WHether this name Africa, bee so called of G. 25 4. Epher or Apher, the sonne of Midian, and Nephew of Abraham, by his second wife Keturah (as Iosephuss Antiq.l.1.c.15 affirmeth, alleadging witnesses of his opinion, Alexander Poly∣histor, and Cleode) or of the Sunnes presence, De his etymis & alijs consule F. Luys de Vireta l. 4.c.1. Roteros because it is aprica, or of the coldes absence, of  and  as Festus saith: or of the word Faruta Dom. Nig. G. Arthus hist. Indiae Orien.c.4. which in the Arabian tongue signifieth to diuide (where∣upon they call this part of the world Ifri∣cbia) because it is (saith Io. Leo.lib.1. Leo) diuided by Nilus, and the Sea, from the rest of the world: or of Pom.Mela.lib. 1.cap. 9. fricus, an Arabian King, which (chased by the Assyrians) heere sea∣ted himselfe: or if any other Many of the Ancients, and Leo ascribe all beyond Ni∣lus to Asia: so Pol.hist.l.3.6.37. Africa intra Ni∣lum & columnas Herculis sita est. can giue more probable Etimologie of the Name, I list not to contend. Nor is it meet for me to be religious in these questions of names, in this
quest and inquire of Religions. It is a great Peninsula, by one Isth, or necke of land betweene the red sea, and Mediterranean, ioyned to the continent, which with the red sea aforesaid is the Easterne limit of Africa, as the Mediteranean on the North, and elsewhere the Ocean. For Nilus is a more obscure, and vncertaine vmpire. It is twice Magin. as bigge as Europe, and yet not so much peopled: Nature hauing made heere her solitarie place of retiring, attended by scorching heates, and showers of sands, as a counterfeit of those heauenly raines, and mouing waters, which the aire and seas afford in other places. Such are the many deserts in Africa, onely fertile in barrennesse: although in other parts it is both fruitfull and populous. The Equinoctiall Circle doth in manner di∣uide it in the middest. And yet old Atlas neuer sheddeth his snowie haires, but hath alwayes on his huge and high opes vnmolten snow, whence sometime it is dispersed as from a store-house, in such incredible quantitie, that it couereth carts, Horses, and the toppes of trees, to the great danger of the inhabitants: and the fountaines are so cold as a man is not able to endure his hand in them. Mount Atlas aforesaid stretcheth from the Ocean, Oc. Atlanti∣cus. bearing name of him almost to Egypt. Other Mountaines of name are those of Sierra, Leona, and the Mountaines of the Moone, &c. One Lake Zembre, yeeldeth three mightie Riuers, disemboking themselues in∣to three seuerall seas: Nilus which runneth Northwards fortie degrees from hence, in Astronomicall reckoning; Cuama which runneth into the Easterne; and Zaire in∣to the Westerne seas: of which Riuers, and of other like, the Reader shall finde more in due place spoken. The Romans reckoned sixe Prouinces in Africa: Ptolomey numbereth twelue. But then was not Africa so well knowne as now. Iohn Leo Io Leo.lib.I. (a Moore, both learned and experienced) hauing spent many yeares in trauell, diuideth Africa into foure parts; Barbaria, Numidia, Lybia, and the Land of Negros. Numidia he calleth Biledulgerid, or the Region of Dates: and Lybia, he calleth Sarra, for so the Arabians call a desert. But he thus excludeth Egypt, and both the higher and lower Aethiopia, which others Maginus. Pory. adde hereunto, and make vp seuen parts of Africa. Many are the Io.Leo lib.9. Creatures which Africa yeeldeth, not vsuall in our parts. Ele∣phants are there in plentie, and keepe in great herdes together: The Giraffa or Ca∣melopardalis; a beast not often seene, yet very tame, and of a strange compositi∣on, mixed of a Libard, Hart, Buffe, and Camell, P. Bellon. l.2. cap.49. doth largely de∣scribe him. and by reason of his long legges before, and shorter behinde, not able to grase without difficultie, but with his high head, which he can stretch forth halfe a pikes length in height, seemeth to feed on the leaues and boughes of trees. The Camels in Afrike are more hardie then in other places; and will not onely beare great burthen, but continue to trauell fiftie dayes together, without carrying with them any corne to giue them, but turne them out at night to feed on thistles, boughes, and the little grasse they finde: And no lesse patient are they of thirst, being able to endure fifteene dayes without drinke vpon necessitie, and fiue dayes ordinarily. The Arabians in Africa count them their greatest wealth: for so they defcribe a mans riches, saying, Hee hath so ma∣ny thousand Camels: and with these they can liue in the deserts without dread of any Prince. Of Camels they haue three sorts: the first called Hugiun, of great stature, and strength, able to carry a thousand pound waight: the second lesle, with two bunches on the backe, fit for carriage and to ride one; called Becheti, of which they haue one∣ly in Asia. The third sort, called Ragnahil, is meagre and small, able to trauell (for they are not vsed to burthens) aboue an hundred miles in a day. And the King of Tom∣buto can send messengers on such Camels to Segelmesse or Darha, nine hundred miles distant in seuen or eight dayes, without stay or change by the way. Their Camels also are docile: they will more be perswaded to hold on a iourney fur∣ther then ordinary by songs, then blowes. In the spring they are mare-wood, & mad of
copulation, in which time they are very ready both to hurt their followers, and to kill their maisters, or any that haue whipped or hurt them. Of horses they haue both wilde (which they entrap by subtilie) and tame: of which the Barbary ho: se is famous, in Eu∣rope and Asia highly prized. The Lant or Dant is a kinde of wilde Kine, but swifter then almost any other beast. They haue also wilde Kine, and wilde Asses. The Adim∣main is as bigge as an Assle, otherwise resembling a Ramme. They haue other sheepe, whose Tailes weigh twenty pound, and sometime fourescore or more, carried on little Cart behinde them. But those Adimmain are found in the Deserts and kept to profit, yeelding them Milke and Cheese. The Females onely haue hornes. The Lyons in cold places are more gentle, in hotter are more fierce, and will not flee the on-set of two hundred horsemen armed. Mr. Iohn Vassall Of Eastwood in Essex. (a friend & neighbour of mine) tolde mee that he brought once out of Barbary a Lyons skinne, which from the noute to the top of the Taile contained one and twenty foote in length. Strange it is that a Lionesse by shewing her hinder parts to the Male, should make him run away. In time of their coupling, eight or ten will follow one Female, with terrible & bloudy battels amongst themselues. They engender backward, Plin.l.8.c.16. Solinus c.36. as doe the Camel, Elephant, Rhinoceros, Ounce, and Tyger. They spare such men as prostrate themselues, and prey rather on men then wo∣men, and not at all on Infants, except compelled by hunger. Plinis tels that Alexan∣der set thousands on worke by hunting, hauking, Fishing, or other meanes, to take and learne the Natures of creatures, that Aristotle might by them bee informed thereof, who wrote almost fiftie Treatises of that Subiect, whereof it seemeth most are lost. He citeth out of Aristot. histor. nimalium. him, that Lyons bring forth small deformed lumpes, at the first time fiue, and (euery yeare after) one lesse, after the fift burthen remaining barren. It cannot stirre till it be two monethes old, nor goe till it be six, if you beleeue him. The Lybians beleeue that the Lyon hath vnderstanding of prayers, and tell of a Ge∣tulian woman, which lying at the Lyons mercy besought him so Noble a beast not to dish mour himselfe with so ignoble a prey and conquest as shee a weake woman was. The like is told Ovied.hist.Ind. l.16.c.11. Vrban. Calueto in Benzon.l.3. of a Spanish Dogge, of one Didacus Salazara Spaniard. This man, according to the bloudy practise of that Nation, minding to fill his Dogges bel∣ly with an olde womans flesh which was his Captiue, gaue her a Letter to carry to the Gouernour and so soone as shee was a little past, loosed his Mastife, who pre∣sently had ouer-taken her. The woman terrified, proftrates her selfe to the Dogge, and sues for her life; Good Maister Dogge, Maister Dogge (saith she) in her lan∣guage, I carry this Letter to the Gouernour (and shewes it him.) Be not fierce on me Maister Dogge. The Dogge (hauing changed, it seemes, with his maister his dogged∣nesse for the others humanitie) made a stay, and lifting vp his legge onely pisted on her and departed, to no small wonder of the Spaniards that knew him. But to returne to the King of beastes. His Taile seemeth to be his Scepter, where∣by he expresseth his passion. He shrinkes not at danger, except some couert of Woods shroude him from witnesses, and then he will take the benefit of flight, which other∣wise he seemes to disdaine. Mentor, a man of Syracusa, was encountred with a Lyon, which in stead of tearing him, fawned on him, and with his dumbe eloquence seemed to implore his aide, shewing his diseased foote, wherein Mentor perceiued a stubbe sticking, which hee pulled out. The like is reported by Gellius A Gellius Noct.Atic , out of Polyhistor, of a Fugitiue seruant, who hauing performed this kinde of office to a Lyon, was by him gratified for a long space with a daily portion of his prey, But after the man was taken and presented to his Maister (a Roman Senatour) who exhibited games to the Romanes, wherein seruants and condemned persons were exposed to the fury of the beasts, amongst whom he placed this seruant; and by a wonderfull Fate, this Lyon also was a little before taken & bestowed on him for this solemne spectacle. The beasts running with violence to their bloudy encounter, sodainly this Lyon stayed, and ta∣king a little better view fawned on this his guest, and defended him from the assault of the other beasts: whereupon, by the peoples entreatie (who had learned the Sto∣rie of him) he was freed, and the beast giuen him: which followed him with a Line in
the streetes, the people pointing and saying; Hic est homo Medicus leonis, hic est Leo hospes hominis. One Elpis a Samian performed a cure on another Lyon, pulling a bone out of his throate, at the Lyons gaping and silent mone: and in remebrance hereof built a temple (at his returne) to Bacchus at Sango, whom before he had inuoked, being in feare of a Lyon. Pliny and Solinus among other African beasts mention the Hyaena, which some thinke to be Male one yeare, and Female another, by course: This Aristotle Arist hist. animal.l.6.32. denies. This beast hath no necke-ioint, and therefore stirres not his necke, but with bending about his whole body. He will imitate humane voice, and drawing neere to the sheepe-coates, hauing heard the name of some of the shepheards wil call him, and when he comes, deuoure him. They tell that his eyes are diuersified with a thousand colours, that the touch of his shadow makes a dogge not able to barke. By engndring with this beast, the Lionesse brings forth a Crocuta, of like qualities to the Hyaena. Hee hath one continued tooth without diuision throughout his mouth. In Africa also are wild Asses, among which, one Male hath many Females: a iealous beast, who (for feare of after en∣croching) bites off the stones to the yong Males, if the suspicious female preuent him not by bringing forth in a close place where he shall not finde it. The like is told of Beners, Flin.l.8.c.30. Whitney Einbl. Solinus. which being hunted for the medicinable qualitie of their stones, are said to bite them off when they are in danger to be taken, paying that ransome for their liues. It cannot be true that is reported of the Hyaeneum, Marbodus de Gemmis. a stone found in the Hyaena's eye, that be∣ing put vnder the tongue of a man, he shall foretell things to come, except he fore-tell this, That no man will beleeue what our Authour before hath told. The Libard is not hurtfull to men except they annoy him: but killeth and eateth Dogges. Dabuh is the name of a simple and base creature like a Wolfe, saue that his legges and feete are like to a mans: Sol in c. 33. calleth them Celphos. so foolish, that with a song, & a Taber, they which know his haunt will bring him out of his denne, and captiue his eares with their musicke, while another captiuateth his legges with a Rope. The Zebra of all creatures for beauty and comelinesse is admirably pleasing: re∣sembling a horse of exquisite composition, but not all so swift, all ouer-laide with par∣tie coloured Laces, and guards, from head to Taile. They liue in great heards, as I was told by my friend Andrew Battle, who liued in the Kingdome of Congo many yeares, and for the space of some monethes liued on the flesh of this Beast, which hee killed with his peece. For vpon some quarrell betwixt the Portugales (among whom he was a Sergeant of a band) and him, he liued eight or nine monethes in the woods, where he might haue view of hundreds together in heards both of these, and of Ele∣phants. So simple was the Zebra, that when he shot one, hee might shoote still, they all standing still at gaze, till three or foure of them were dead. But more strange it see∣med which hee told mee of a kinde of great Apes, if they might so be termed, of the height of a man, but twice as bigge in feature of their limmes, with strength proporti∣onable, hairie all ouer, otherwise altogether like men and women in their vvhole bodily shape. They liued on such wilde fruites as the Trees and woods yeelded, and in the night time lodged on the Trees: Hee was accompanied with two Negro-boyes: and they carried away one of them by a sudden surprise: yet not hurting him, as they vse not to doe any which they take, except they then looke vpon them. This slaue af∣ter a monethes life with them conuayed himselfe away againe to his Maister. Other Apes there are store, and as Solinus reporteth, Satyres (if there be any such) are thought to be conceiued of humane copu∣lation with Goates. . raudius in Soli. Satyres with feete like Goates, and Sphynges, with breasts like women, and hairie, whereof Pierius saith hee saw one at Verona, and a kinde of Conies also at the same time, foure times as bigge as the ordina∣rie, & (which is more incredible) had each of them foure genitall members. Philippo Pi∣gafetta speaketh in his Relation Congo translated by A. H. of Congo, of other beastes in Africa, as of the Tyger as fierce and cruell as Lyons, making prey of man and beast, yet rather deuouring blacke men, then white: whose Mustachis are holden for mortall poison. and being giuen in meates, cause men to die madde. The Empalanga is somewhat like to an Oxe. Their sheepe and goates neuer bring forth lesse then two, and sometimes three or foure at a time. They haue Wolues, Foxes, Deere, (Red and Fallow) Robuckes, Ciuet-Cats, Sables and Marterns. They haue Snakes and Adders, whereof some are
called Imbumas fiue and twenty spannes long, liuing in Land and water, not venemous but rauenous, and lurke in trees (for which taking purpose, Nature hath giuen it a lit∣tle horne or claw within two or three foote of the Taile) waiting for their prey, which hauing taken, it deuoureth hornes, hoofes, and all, although it be a hart. And then swollen with this so huge a meale, it is as it were drunke and sleepie, and vnweldie or the space of fiue or six daies. The Pagan Negros rost and eate them as great dain∣ties. The people doe eate them. The biting of their Vipers killeth in foure & twen∣ty howers space. Africa for monsters in this kinde hath beene famous, as in the Ro∣man Historie appeareth. Attilius A Gel.l.6.c.3. Regulus the Romane Consul in the first Punike warre, at the Riuer Bagrada encountred with a huge Serpent, and planted his En∣gines an 1 Artillerie against the same, whose skinne, sent to Rome for a Monument, was in length a hundred and twenty foote, as Gellius out of Tubero reporteth. The Scales Oros.l.4.c.8. armed it from all hurt by darts or Arrowes, and with the breath it killed ma∣ny, and had eaten many of the Souldiours before they could with a stone out of an Engine destroy the destroyer. The Riuers of Niger, Nilus, Zaire, and others, haue store of Crocodiles, whereof some are of incredible bignes and greedy denourers. Mount Atlas hath plenty of Dragons, grosse of bodie, flow of motion, and in biting or touching incurably venemous. The Deserts of Lybia haue in them many Hydra's. Dubh is the name of a kinde of great Lizard, not venemous, which neuer drinketh, and if water bee put in his mouth hee presently dieth. He is counted dainty meat, and three daies after hee is killed, at the heate of the fire hec moueth as if he had life. In Congo is a kinde of Dragons like in bignes to Rammes, with wings, hauing long Tailes, and Chappes, and diuers iawes of Teeth, of blew and greene colour, painted like scales, with two feete, and feede on rawe flesh. The Pagan Negros pray to them as Gods, for which cause the great Lords keepe them to make a gaine of the peoples deuotion, which offer their gifts and Oblations. The Chameleons are knowne among vs, admirable for their acrie sustenance, (although they also hunt and eate Flies) and for the changeablenes of their colours. Solinus c. 3.3. The Tarandus, a beast somewhat re∣sembling an Oxe, liuing in Aethiopia, is of like fearefulnes and changeablenes. An other Serpent hath a rundle on his Taile like a Bell, which also ringeth as it goeth. But if any desire to know the varietie of these Serpents, Solinus in his thirteenth chapter will more fully satisfie him: and Bellonius in his obseruations. Manifold are these kindes of Serpents in Africa, as the Cerastes, which hath a lit∣tle Coronet of foure hornes, whereby he allureth the birds vnto him (lying hidden in the sands all but the head,) & so deuoreth them. The Iaculi dart themselues from trees on such creatures as passe by. The Amphisbena, hath two heads, the Taile also onera∣ted, (I cannot say honoured) with a head, which causeth it to moue circularly with croo∣ked windings: a fit Embleme of popular sedition, where the people will rule their Prince, needes must their motion bee crooked, when there are two heads, and there∣fore none. The Scythale is admirable in her varied iacket. The Dipsas killes those whom shee stingeth, with thirst. The Hypanale with sleepe, as befell to Cleopatra. The Hemerois with vnstanchable bleeding. The Prester with swelling. And not to poison you with names of many other of these poisonfull creatures, the Basiliske is said to kill with her sight or hissing. Galen Gallen.lib.de Theriaca. Pliny saith it is twelue fingers long, and nine inches. 1.8.c.21. describes it: and so doe Solius and others. It is not halfe a foote long, and hath three pointells (Galen saith) on the head, or after Solinus, strakes like a Mitre. It blasteth the ground it toucheth, the Hearbes, and trees, and infe∣cteth the ayre, that birds flying ouer fall dead. It frayeth a way other Serpents with the hissing. It goeth vpright from the belly vpwards. If any thing be slaine by it, the same also proueth venemous to such as touch it. Onely a Weasill killes it. The Bergameni bought the carkasse of one of them at an incredible summe, which they hung in their Temple (which Apelles hand had made famous) in a Net of Golde, to preserue the same from birds and Spiders. The Catoblepas is said to bee of like venemous nature, alwaies going with her head into the ground, her sight otherwise being deadly. As for the monsters, that by mixt generations of vnlike kindes Nature vnnaturally produ∣ceth lo. Baptistu Porta, &c.
I leaue to others discourse. Leuinus Lemnius de occultis.14.c.12. Lemnius tels, that of the marrow in a mans backbone is engendred a Serpent; yea of an Egge which an old Cock will lay after he is vnable to tread Hennes any longer, is (saith he) by the same Cockes sitting, produced a basilske: and tells of two such Cockes at Zirizea, killed by the people, which had found them sitting on such Egges. Ostriches keepe in companies in the Deserts, making shewes a far off as if they were troupes of Horsemen: a ridiculous terrour to the Carauans of Marchants: a foolish Bird, that forgetteth his Nest, and leaueth his Egges for the Sunne and Sands to hatch, that eateth any thing, euen the hardest Iron: that heareth nothing: They haue Ea∣gles, Parots, and other Fowles. But none more strange then that which is tearmed Nisr, bigger then a Crane, preying vpon Carrion, and by his flight burieth his great body in the clouds that none may see him, whence he espyeth his prey: and li∣ueth so long that all his fethers fall away by age, and then is fostered by his yong ones. Other fowles they haue too tedious to relate. Grashoppers doe here often renew the Aegyptian plague, which come in such quantitie that they intercept the shining of the Sunne like a cloud, and hauing eaten the fruits and Leaues, leaue their spawne behinde (worse then their predecessors) deuouring the very barkes of the Leafe-lesse Trees. The old depart none knowes whither: and sometime with a South-East winde are carried into Spaine. The Arabians, & Lybians eate them before they haue spawned, to that end gathering them in the morning, before the Sunne haue dried their wings, and made them able to flye. One man can gather foure or fiue bushels in a Morning. P. Oros.l.5.c.11. Orosius tells that once they had not onely eaten vp Fruits, Leaues, and Barke, while they liued, but being dead, did more harme: for beeing carried by a winde into the Sea, & the sea not brooking such morsels, vomiting them vp againe on the shore, their putri∣fied carkasses caused such a plague, that in Numidia died thereof eight hundred thou∣sand: and on the Sea coast neere Carthage and Vtica, two hundred thousand: and in V∣tica it selfe thirtie thousand souldiours, which had beene mustered for the Garrisons of Africa. In one day were carried out of one gate one thousand & fiue hundred carkasses. They are said to come into Barbary seuen yeares togither, & other seuen not to come, at which times corne before so deare, is sold for little, and sometimes not vouchsafed the reaping, such their soile and plenty. The iuice of the yong is poison. Aluares in his 32. and 33. Chapters, tells of these Grashoppers in Aethiopia, that in some places they made the people trusse vp bagge and baggage, and seeke new habitations where they might finde victuall: The Countrey all desert and destroyed, and looking as if it had snowed there, by reason of the vnbarked Trees, and the fields of Mais, the great stalkes whereof were troden downe, and broken by them: and in another place a Tem∣pest of raine and Thunder left them more then two yards thicke, on the Riuers bankes. This he saw with his eyes. But the studious of Natures rarities in these parts may resort to Leo, and others, as also for their further satisfaction in the Fishes and Monsters of the water; as the Hyp∣popotamus, in shape resembling a horse, in bignes an Asse: The Sea Kine, lesser then the land Kine, the Tartaruca a tortuise, which liueth in the Deserts, of huge bignes, &c, The people which inhabite Africa are Arabians, Mores, Abissines, Aegyptians, and diuers sorts of the Heathens, differing in rites from each other, as shall follow in our discourse. The Monsters which Pliny and others tell of, besides Munster and Sabelli∣eus out of them, I neither beleeue, nor report.
CHAP. II. Of Egypt and of the famous Riuer Nilus: and her first Kings, Temples, and Monuments, according to Herodotus, Diodorus, and others. AFter our generall view of Africa, Egypt may iustly challenge the prin∣cipall place in our African discourse, as being both in situation next to Asia (whence wee are lately come) and consequently from thence first peopled; besides that Religion, our Load-Starre, hath here found the soonest and solemnest entertainement. And not in Religion alone, but in Politie, Philosophie, and Artes, the Grae∣cious Iamblichus. which would seeme the first Fathers of these things haue been Disciples to the Aegyptians, as Am.M.l.22.D.S.l.1. Plin.de Os. & is. Volat.l.12. Lact.l.4.c.9. Hieron.ad Paul. Am. Marcellinus and D. Siculus, Plutarch, and many others affirme. Hence Orpheus, Musaus, & Homer fetched their Theologie; Lycurgus and Solon their lawes; Pythagoras, Plato, Anaxagoras, Eudoxus, Democritus, Daedalus, here borrowed that knowledge for which the world hath euer since admired them. Let it not then be imputed to me as a tedious officiousnesse, if I longer detaine the Reader (otherwise delighted with the view of those rills which hence haue flo∣wed among the Greeke and Latine Poets and Philosophers) in surueying these Aegyptian Fountaines and well-springs, whence haue issued especially a deluge of Superstition, that in elder times drowned all the neighbouring parts of the world. Nor let it bee tedious vnto vs to behold (in this historicall Theater) those Aegyp∣tian Rarities; the sight whereof hath drawne not Philosophers alone, but great Princes too, and mighty Emperours, to the vndertaking of long and dangerous iourneyes: As Aelian.Spart.Seuerus. Seuerus, who though hee forbade Iudaisme and Christianitie, yet went this Pilgrimage, in honour of Serapis, and for the straunge sights of Mem∣phis, Memnon, the Pyramides, Labyrinth &c. Vespasian also and others did the like. The name of Egypt (saith Antiq.l.1.c.6. Broughtons Concent. Iosephus) is Mesre, of Misraim, the sonne of Cham, and the Egyptians of themselues Mesraei. So the Arabians at this day call it (as Leo Ie. Leo l.8. affirmeth) but the inhabitans they call Chibth. This Chibth they say was hee which first ruled this Countrey, and built houses therein. The inhabitants also doe now call themselues thus: yet are there not now left any true Egyptians, saue a few Christians: the Mahumetans hauing mingled themselues with the Arabians and A∣fricans. The Turkes D. Chylr. call both the countrey it selfe, and principall Citie (Cairo) by the name of Misir. The name Egyptus is deriued from Aegyptus brother of Denaus after the common account: as others say, of Ai Copti, the land of Copti, (a chiefe Citie of Egypt) so Lydiat and some others. Ai and Copti. Egypt hath on the East, the gulfe, & some part of Arabia; on the South the falles and mountaines of Aethiopia; on the West, the Deserts of Libya; on the North, the Me∣diterranean Sea: all which Nature hath set not onely as limits, but as fortifications also to this Countrey. Nilus runneth through the middest thereof, threescore miles from Cairo making by division of himselfe that Delta, to which some appropriated the name of Aegypt, refuted by Iupiter Ammon, whose Oracle (saith Herodotus) rec∣koned all that Aegypt, which Nilus ouerflowed. Ptolomaus Ptol.li.4.c.54. numbreth three of those Deltas. Touching the head of Nilus; Bredenbachius (as Adrichomius citeth him) affir∣meth, that many Soldans haue sent men on purpose furnished with skill and prouisi∣on for the Discouery, who, after two or three yeares, returning, affirmed that they could finde no head of this Riuer, nor could tell any certainety, but that it came from the East, and places not inhabited: both of like truth. For indeede this Riuer ari∣seth
(as by late discoueries is found) out of a Lake in twelue degrees of Southerly Latitude, out of which not onely this Riuer runneth Northwards into the Medi∣terranean, but Naire also, Westward, Zuama, and Spirito Santo Eastward into the Ocean, as is said: all ouer-flowing their Territories in the same time and from the same cause. What this cause should be, many both old and later wri∣ters haue laboured to search. Herodotus, Diodorus, Pliny, and Solinus, haue lent vs the coniectures of Antiquitie herein: Ph.Pigafetta.l.2.c.vlt.apud Ram. Fracastorius and Ramusins, haue bestowed their discourses on the Subject, as Goropius also and others of later yeares haue done. The most probable cause is the raynes, which Gorop. Gorop.in pecees. Niloscopium. in his Niloscopium, deriueth from a double cause. For the Sunne, in places neere the line doth shew more mighty ef∣fects of his fierie presence, exhailing abundance of vapours, which in terrible show∣ers he daily repaieth, except some Naturall obstacle doe hinder (as in someplaces of Peru Acosta.hist.Ind. where it seldome or neuer raineth:) And hence it is, that the Indians both East and West, and the Africans, reckon their Summer and Winter otherwise then in these parts of the world: for this time of the sunnes neere presence with them they call Winter in regard of these daily stormes: which hee seemes to recompence them with other six monethes continuall serenitie and faire weather; not then raising (by rea∣son of his further absence) any more exhalations then are by himselfe exhausted and consumed, which time for that cause they call Summer. Goropius therefore out of his coniectures telleth vs of a two-fould Winter, vnder both Tropikes at the same time; vn∣der Cancer the rainie Winter, which in manner (as yee haue heard) attendes on the same; vnder Capricorne the Astronomicall Winter in the Sunnes absence, where also he supposeth it to raine at that time by reason of the high hils there situate, & the great Lakes, which minister store of moisture, besides that Cancer is then in the house of the Moone. Againe, the Windes P.Pigafetta. l.... Etesij (that is to say ordinaris euery yeare) in their annu∣all course, euery Winter lift vp the cloudes to the toppes of the hilles, which raelt them into raine, wherby all the Riuers in Aethiopia are filled: and cause those ouer-flowings, which in Nilus is strangest, because it is in Egypt, furthest off from the raines that cause it. The like ouerflowing is common to many other Riuers; as to Ni∣ger, in Africa; to Menan of Pegu; and the Riuer of Siam in Asia; and to the Riuers of Amazones, and Guiana in America. Frier Luys Historia de la Etiopia.l..c.28. de Vrreta ascribeth the ouerflowing to some secret passages and pores, whereby the Ocean and the Mountaines of the Moone hold mutuall commerce. This increase of Nilus beginneth about the middest of Iune, continuing forty daies, after which followeth the decrease as long. In the middle of Nilus, (saith Leo Lib.8. Leo) ouer against the olde Citie of Cairo, standeth the Ile Michias, or the measuring Ile, containing one thousand, and five hundred Families, and a Temple, and a foure-square Cisterne of eighteene cubits depth, whereinto the water of Nilus is conuaied by acertaine sluce vnder the ground, in the middest wher∣of is a pillar marked also with eighteene cubits, to which Officers for the purpose re∣sort daily from the 17. of Iune, to obserue the increase, which if it amount to fifteene Cubits, and there stay, it doth portend fertilitie, and how much ouer or vnder, so much lesse abundance. In the meane time the people deuoutly exercise prayer and almes-giuing: And after, the price of victuals, (especially of Corne) is proportio∣nably appointed for the whole yeare. The Cities and Townes of Egypt, whiles this inundation lasteth, are so many Ilands. And thus saith Herodotus, The land of Egypt doth not onely owe the fertilitie, but her selfe also, vnto the slimie encrease of Ni∣lus: for Raine is in∣fectious if at any time it fall in Egypt: except in and about Alexandria, where Pigasetta saith it raineth. Terra suis con∣tenta bonis, non indiga mercis, Aut Iouis, in solo tanta  fiducia Nile. Luceā.Bel. Sac.l..19. Nilus solus ex amnibus vniuer∣sis nullas expirat auras.Solin. raine is a stranger in this Countrie seldome seene, and yet ostner then wel∣come; as vnholsome to the inhabitants. But Goropius reasoneth largely in confutation of the opinion of Herodotus. The mouthes or falles of Nilus, numbred by the Pro∣phet Esay Isay 11.15. and other in olde times, seuen, and after Pliny (who reckoneth the foure smaller) eleuen: are now (as Willielmus Tyrins out of his owne search testifieth) but foure, or, as other writers, but three worthy of consideration, Rosetto, Balbitina, Da∣meiata, where the saltnes of the earth, and shelles found in it, may seeme to confirme Herodotus opinion, that Nilus hath wonne it from the Sea. Egypt was anciently diui∣ded
into Thebais, Delta, and the region interiacent: and these subdiuided into six and thirtie Nomt, which we may call shires, whereof Tanite and Heliopolite were the as∣signement of Iacobs familie D. Chytr. then called Goshen, from whence Moses after condu∣cted them into Canaan, as Strabo Str.lib.16. also witnesseth. The wealth of Aegypt, as it pro∣ceedeth from Nilus, so is it much encreased by the fit conueyance in the naturall and hand-laboured channells Sesostris, Ptolomai, Tra∣iani sossa. thereof. Their haruest beginneth in Aprill, and is threshed out in Maie. In this one Region were sometimes (by Herodotus and Plinies report) twenty thousand Cities: Diodorus Diod.lib.1. Siculus saith eighteene thousand: and in his time, three thousand. He also was told by the Egyptian Priests, that it had beene gouer∣ned about the space of eighteene hundred yeares, by the Gods and Heroes; the last of whom was Orus: after whom it was vnder kings vntill his time, the space almost Olymp.180. of fifteene hundred yeares. To Heredotus they reported of three hundred and thirtie kings from Menas to Sesostris. The Scripture, whose Chronologie conuinceth those lying Fables, calleth their Kings by one generall name, Pharao (which some Morn deuer.fos Antiq libr.3.ca.2. interpret a Sauiour, Iosephus saith signifieth Authoritie) and maketh auncient mention of them, in the dayes of Abra∣ham. Some beginne this royall Computation at Mizraim. If our Berosus which An∣nius hath set forth were of authoritie, Pseudo-Bero∣siu. he telleth, that Cham, the sonne of Noah, was by his father banished for particular abuse of himselfe, and publique corruption of the world, teaching and practising those vices, which before had procured the Deluge, as sodomy, incest, buggery: and was therefore branded with the name Chemesenua, that is, dishonest Cham, in which the Egyptians followed him, and reckoned him among their Gods, by the name of Xenoph.de aquiuocu, cal∣leth Cham Saturnus Aegyptius.c Psal.75.&108. Saturne, consecrated him a Citie called Chem Min. The Psalmes Psal.75.&.108. of Dauid doe also thus entitle Egypt, the land of Cham: which name was retained by the Egyptians themselues in Ieromes Hier.in Gen. Brought.Conc. dayes. Chemmis after Diodo∣rus was hallowed to Pan, and the word signifieth Pans Citie: in Herodotus his time it was a great towne in Thebais, hauing in it a Temple of Perseus, square, and set round with Palme-trees, with a huge Porch of stone, on which were two great statues, and in it a Chappell, with the Image of Perseus. The Inhabitants want not their miracu∣lous Legend, of the Apparitions of their God, and had a relique of his, a sandale of two cubites which he sometimes ware. They celebrate festiuall games in his honour, after the Greek maner. Herodotus also mentioneth an Iland called Chemmis, with the Temple of Apollo in it. Lucian Lucian.Dis syr. sayth, the Aegyptians were the first that had Temples, but their Temples had no Images. Their first Temples are reported Diod.Sic.li.1 to haue beene erected in the times of Osiris and Isis, whose parents were Iupiter and Iuno, children to Saturne and Rhea, who succeeded Vulcan in this Kingdome. They built a Magnificent Temple to Iupiter and Iuno, and two other golden Temples to Iupiter Calestis, and Iupiter A, or Cham, which we before spake of, instituting vnto them Priests and golden Statues. Menas is reckoned the first King after those Demi-gods Mors.de vera Christ.rel.ca.26. who built a Temple to Vulcan, and taught the people to sacrifice, and other rites of Religion. Long after him, Busiris built Thebes, which was said Herodot.li.. to haue a hundred Gates, and many state∣ly erections of Temples, Colosses, Obeliskes; by the one Name they call their more then Giantly Images; by the other, their Pillars of one stone, fashioned like a Nee∣dle. Of foure Temples, there was one containing in circuit thirteene furlongs, in height fiue and fortie cubits, the wall foure and twentie foot thicke. Cambyses rob∣bed it. Amongst the seuen and fortie Sepulchres of their Kings, that of Simandius was reckoned most sumptuous, the gates whereof were two hundred foot long, and fiue and fortie cubits high: within was a square Cloyster, containing in each square foure hundred foot, borne vp with Statues of Beasts in stead of Pillars, of sixteene cubits, the Roofe made of stones, of two paces broad, beautified with Starres. Then was there another gate like to the former, but fuller of worke, with three huge Statues to himselfe, his mother, and daughter. Within this was another Cloyster, more beautifull then the former. This cost, although it might happily be enlarged in the telling, yet doth not disagree to that Aegyptian opinion, esteeming their houses
their Innes, and their Sepulchres their etern all Habitations. Of the race of Simandius was Ogdous, that built In 69.51. & 19.50 Memphis (called in the Scripture Noph) compassing a hun∣dred and fiftie furlongs, at the parting of Nilus, into that Delta-diusion, where the succeeding Kings abode, forsaking Thebes, till Alexandria was after built by Alex∣ander. Thebes was called Diospolis, or Iupiters Citie, where (as Strabo St.lib.17. reporteth) was consecrated to Iupiter a beautifull Virgin of noble birth, who, vntill the time that shee had her naturall purgation, had the carnall companie of whomsoeuer she pleased, and at this her menstruous accident was bewailed as dead, and after married. Such Vir∣gins the Greekes (sayth he) called Pallades. Many yeares after Ogdous, succeeded Sesostris. Iosephus Antiq.lib.8.4. is of opinion, That Herodotus erred in the name, and ascribed the deeds of 2.Chron.12.9. Shishak to Sesostris; to which also the computation of Herodotus doth a∣gree reasonably in the time. Volater.li.12.Lud.Reg.libr.4. Others account him the same with Sesachis in Diodorus. The huge Conquests of this Sesostris are beyond all that euer Alexander atchieued, if we credit Authors. At his returne he builded in euery Citie of Aegypt a Temple to their chiefe God at his owne costs; and offered a shippe of Cedar, two hundred and eighty cubites in length, filuered on the in-side, guilded on the out-side, to the chiefe god at Thebes, and two Obeliskes one hundred and twenty cubits high, wher∣in were ingrauen the greatnes of his Empire and reuenues. At Memphis in the Tem∣ple of Vulcan he dedicated Statues of himselfe and his wife, thirty cubites high, of his children twenty. And when he went to the Temple, or through the Citie, his Charri∣ot was drawne by Kings, as Lucan singeth: Venit ad Occasum mundi{que} extrema Sesostris; Et Pharios currus Regum cernicibus egit. Sesestis in the Westerne World, by warre Compelled Kings to draw his Memphian Carre. Thus we reade in our owne Chronicles Mat Western. Fox Act.& Mo∣nument. Slow.obron.&c. of Edgarus Pacifieus, sometimes King of England, rowed in a Boate by eight Kings, himselfe holding the Sterne. Tacitus Annal.2.15. telleth of Rhamses an Aegyptian King, who conquerd the East and South parts of the world, helped heerein, (as the Priests tolde Germanicus) with the forces of Thebes, who had then seuen hundred thousand fighting men. This was written in Egyptian Characters at Thebes, interpreted by one of the Priests, together with his reuenues not inferiour to the Roman or Parthian Empires. Pheron, the sonne and suc∣cessour of Sesostris, enraged at the rage of Nilus, swelling aboue eighteene cubits, cast a dart against the streame, Her.lib.2. and thereupon lost his sight, which by the aduice of the Oracle in Butis, was restored by the vrine of a woman, which had neuer knowne man but her husband: which caused him to burne his owne wife and many other, failing in this new experiment, and to marry her whom at last he found by this proofe to be ho∣nest. He set vp in the Temple of the Sunne two Pillars, each of one stone of 100 cubits high, and eight broad. After, succeeded Memphites, Rhamsinitus, and Cheopes. This last shut vp all the Temples in Egypt, and busied them in his owne workes, one hun∣dred thousand by course ten yeares together, in building a Pyramis for his Sepulchre. The least stone was thirtie foote, and all grauen. Nilus passeth vnder it by a trench. It was reckoned among the Wonders of the World. His daughter and brother made two other; odious therefore to the Egyptians, who will not once name them. Bellon.l..2.c.42. Bello∣nius out of his owne sight reporteth, that the Pyramides (vet remayning) doe exceed that which Histories haue related of them. Hee measured one of the foure squares of one of them, which contained three hundred and foure and twenty large paces. This was hollow, the other solid. They did it (saieth hee) in hope of the resurrection. For they would not interre their dead bodies, because of the worms; nor burne them, because they esteemed Fire a liuing creature, which feeding thereon, must together with it perish. They therefore with nitre and cedar thus preserue them. Some also re∣port,
Gi.Bot. That they vsed hereunto the slimie Bitumen of the dead Sea, which hath pre∣serued an infinit number of Carkasses in a dreadfull Caue (not farre from these Pyra∣mides) yet to be seene, with their flesh and members whole, after so many thousand yeares, and some with their haire and teeth. Bellonius thinketh the fables of Lethe and Styx to haue flowed from that Lake, by which the dead bodies were brought hither. Of these is the true Mummia. Not farre hence is that Sphynx, a huge Colosse, with the head of a Maid, and bodie of a Lion, supposed by Bellonius to be the monument of some Sepulchre. It yet continueth all of one stone, and is a huge face, looking toward Cairo. The compasse of the head, sayth P. Martyr, Leg.Bab.lib.3 an eye-witnesse, is 58. paces. Plmy Lib.36.ca.12. numbreth . Pyramides and saith, That the compasse of this Sphynx, about the head, was 102. foot, the length 143. 360000 men were 20. yeares in making one of the Pyramides, and three were made in 78. yeares and foure moneths. The greatest (saith he) couereth eight acres of ground; and Bellonius affirmeth, That the Pyramides rather exceede then fall short of the reports of the Ancient, and that a strong and cun∣ning Archer on the toppe is not able to shoot beyond the fabricke of one; which Vil∣lamont being there, caused to be tried and found true. But I would be loth to burie the Reader in these sumptuous Monuments, the witnesses of vanitie and ostentation; of which, besides the Ancient, Martyr, Bellonius, Euesham, Villamont, and other eye-witnesses haue largely written. Mycermus is reckoned the next King, better beloued of his subiects, whose daugh∣ter was buried in a wooden Bull in the City Sai; to which euery day were odors offred, & alight set by night. This Oxe once a yeare was brought out to the people. Next to him was Asychis, who made a Pyramis of bricks; and these bricks were made of earth, that claue to the end of a pole for this purpose, in a vaine curiositie thrust into a lake. Yet were all these wonders exceeded by the Labyrinth, the worke (say some) of Hons.Cos.li.3. sam∣metichus, or (after Herodotus) of the twelue Peeres which reigned in common as kings, partly aboue ground, partly beneath, in both containing 3500 roomes. Herodotous saith he saw the vpper roomes, the lower he might not, as being the Sepulchres of the Founders, & of the sacred Crocodiles: all was of stone, and grauen. The lake of Maeris was not lesse wonderful, compassing 3600. furlongs, & 50 fadom in depth, made by Maeris, whose name it beareth. In the midst were 2. Pyramides 50. fadom aboue, & as much beneath water, one for himselfe, the other for his wife. The water flows 6 months out, & 6 months in, from Nilus. The fish were worth to the kings coffers twēty of their pounds a day the first 6, & a talent a day the last 6 months. Of Necus whom the Scrip∣ture calles Pharaon Necho, & of his victory against the Syrians in Magdolo, or Magid∣do, where he slue king Iosiah. He also makes this Necus author of that trench, from Ni∣lus to the red sea, which Strabo ascribes to Sesostris. Pli. Plm.li.6.c.29 makes Sesostris first author, se∣conded by Darius, who in this busines was followed by Ptol. 100. foot broad, 37. miles long; but forced to leaue the enterprise, for feare of the red sea ouerflowing Egypt, or mixing his water with Nilus. Reg.23.29. Tremellins thinks it to be the labour of the Israelites, in that seruitude, from which Moses freed them. He consumed in this work 120000. Egyptians. After him reigned Sammi, & then Apries. About these times Anton.Galux. Nabuch. conquered the Egyptians, accor∣ding to Ezech. prophecy, Ezec.30. But they had also ciuil wars. Amasis Philostrat.de vita Apollon.lib. 5.ca.. saith that Apollonius, seeing a Lion (which one had tamed) offer to fawn on him, withall, vttering certaine murmurings; inter∣preted that speach of the Lion to the people, saying, that be sometime had been Amasis the Aegyptian King: whereupon he was sent with pompous procession of the Priests, to Le∣ontopolis, and there placed in the Temple. depriued A∣pries, who, being of a base birth, of a great bason of gold in which himselfe & his guests had vsed to wash their feet, made an Image, & placed it in the most conuenient part of the city; & obseruing their superstitious deuotion thereunto, said that they ought now no lesse to respect him, notwithstanding his former base birth and offices. When hee was a priuate man, to maintaine his prodigall expenses, he vsed to steale from others: and when they redemaunded their own, he committed himselfe to the censure of their oracles. Such oracles as neglected his thefts, he being a king, did neglect. He brought from the city Elephantina 20 daies sailing, a building of solid stone, the roofe being of one stone, 21 cubits long, 14 broad, and 8 thicke, and brought it to the Temple at Sai. He ordained, that euery one should yerely giue account to the Magistrate, how he li∣ued, & maintained himself. Psammenitus his son succeeded, whom Cambyses depriued.
CHAP. III. Of the Aegyptian Idoles, with their Legendary Histories and Mysteries. IF wee stay longer on this Aegyptian Stage, partly the varietie of Au∣thors may excuse vs which haue entreated of this subiect, partly the variety of matter, which, adding some light to the Diuine Oracles, (not that they neede it, which are in themselues a light 2.Pet.t.19. shining in a darke place; but because of our need, whose owly eyes can not so ea∣sily discerne that light) deserue a larger relation. For whether the Hi∣stories of the Old Testament, or the Prophecies of the New be considered, both there literally we reade of Egyptian rites practised, and heere mystically of like superstiti∣ons in the Antichristian Synagogue reuiued, therefore Apoc.II.8. called spiritually Sodome and Aegypt. No where can Antiquitie pleade a longer succession of errour; no where of superstition more multiplicitie; more blind zeale, in prosecuting the same themselues, or cruelty in persecuting others that gaines aied. Oh Aegypt! wonderfull in Nature, whose Heauen is brasse, and yet thine Earth not Yron, wonderfull for Antiquitie, Arts and Armes, but no way so wonderfull, as in thy Religions, wherewith thou hast distur∣bed the rest of the world, both elder and later, Heathen and Christian; to which thou hast beene a sinke and mother of Abhominations. Thy Heathenisme planted by Cham, watered by Iannes, Iambres, Hermes, ouerflowed to Athens and Rome: Thy Christi∣anisme, famous for many ancient Fathers, more infamous for that Arrian heresie, which rising heere, eclipsed the Christian light; the world wondring and groning to see it selfe an Arrian: I speake not of the first Monkes, whose egge, here layd, was faire, and beginnings holy: but (by the Deuills brooding) brought forth in after-ages a dange∣rous serpent: Thy Mahumetisme entertayned with like lightnes of credulity, with like eagernes of deuotion, no lesse troublesome to the Arabian Sect in Asia and Afrike, then before to the Heathens or Christians in Europe. The first Author (it seemeth) of this Egyptian, as of all other false Religions, was Cham (as before is sayd) which had taken deepe rooting in the dayes of Ioseph the Patriarch, and in the dayes of Moses; their Priests Gen.41.8. Exodus1 7. Wisemen and Soothsayers, confirming their deuotions with lying mi∣racles, as the Scriptures testifie of Iannes and Iambres; and Her.Asc.lep. Hermes Trismegistus, of his grandfather and himselfe. The Grecians ascribe these deuotions to Osiris and Isis: of whom the Historie and Mysterie is so confused; that Typhon neuer hewd Osiris into so many peeces, as these vaine Theologians, and Mythologians haue done. They are for∣sooth in the Egyptian throne, King and Queene: in the heauens, the Sunne & Moone: beneath these, the Elements: after Herodotus, they are Bacchus and Ceres: Diodorus maketh Osiris the same with the Sunne, Serapis, Dionysius, Pluto, Ammon, Iupiter: I∣sis, the Moone, Ceres and Iuno. In Macrobius and Servius she is the nature of things; he, Adonis and Atis: Plutarch addeth to these Interpretations Oceanus and Sirius, as to Isis, Minerua Proserpina, Thetis. And if you haue not enough, Apulcius will helpe you, with Venus, Diana, Bellona, Hecate Rhamnusia: and Heliodorus nearer home, maketh Osiris to be Nilus, the Earth Isis. So true is it that l.Cor.8.4. Io. 4 12. an Idoll is nothing in the world, and Idolaters worship they know not what. But to search this fountaine further, you may reade the Egyptian opinion in Dio∣dorus, Diod.Sic.li.1. how that the world, being framed out of that Chaos, or first matter, the lighter things ascending, the heauier descending, the Earth yet imperfect, was heated and hardned by the Sunne, whose violent heate begat of her slimie soft∣nesse certaine putride swellings, couered with a thinne filme, which beeing by the
same heate ripened, brought forth all manner of creatures. This muddy generation was say they) first in Egypt, most fit, in respect of the strong soile, temperate ayre, Nilus ouerflowing, and exposed to the Sunne, for to beget and nourish them: and yet re∣taining some such vertue. at the new flaking of the riuer, the Sunne more desirous (as it were) of this Egyptian Concubine, whom the waters had so long detained from his sight, ingendring in that lustfull fit many Creatures, as mice and others, whose fore∣partes are seene mouing before the hinder are formed. These newly-hatched people could not but ascribe Diuinitie to the Author of their humanity, by the names of Osi∣ris and Isis, worshipping the Sunne and Moone, accounting them to be Gods, and euerlasting: adding in the same Catalogue, vnder disguised names of Iupiter, Vul∣can, Minerua, Occanus, and Ceres, the fiue Elements of the world, Spirit, Fire, Aire, Water, & Earth. These eternall Gods begot others, whom not Nature, but their owne proper merite made immortall, which reigned in Egypt, and bare the names of those celestiall Deities. Their Legend of Some think that this Osiris was Mizraim the sonne of Cham.Morn. Osiris, is, that he hauing set Egypt in order, lea∣uing Isis his wife gouernour, appoynting Mercurie her Counsellour (the inuenter of Arithmetike, Musicke, Physicke, and of their superstition) made an expedition into farre countries, hauing Hercules for his Generall, with Apollo his brother, Anubis and Macedon his sonnes, (whose Ensignes were a Dogge and a Wolfe, creatures after for this cause honored, and their counterfeits worshipped) Pan, Maron, and Triptolemus, and the nine Muses attending with the Satyres. Thus did hee inuade the world, rather with Arts, then Armes; teaching men husbandry in many parts of Asia and Europe, and when Vines would not grow, to make drinke of barley. At his returne, his bro∣ther Typhon slew him, rewarded with like death by the reuenging hand of Isis and her sonne Orus. The dispersed peeces, into which Typhon had cut him, she gathered and committed to the Priests, with iniunction to worship him, with dedication vnto him of what beast they best liked, which also should be obserued with much ceremonie, both aliue and dead, in memory of Osiris. In which respect also Lactant.lib a they obserued so∣lemnely to make a lamentable search for Osiris with many teares, making semblance of like toy at his pretended finding, whereof Lucan singeth, Nunquam{que} satis quaesitus Osiris; alway seeking (saith Lactantius) and alway finding. To establish this Osiri∣an Religion she consecrated a third part of the land in Egypt for maintenance of these superstitious rites and persons: the other two parts appropriated to the King, and his souldiours. This Isis, after her death, was also deified in a higher degree of adoration then Osiris selfe. One thing is lacking to our tale, which was also lacking a long time to Isis in her search. For when shee had with the helpe of waxe made vp of six and twenty parts, which she found so many Images of Osiris, all buried in seuerall places: his priuities, which Typhon had drownd in Nilus, were not without much labor found, & more solemnity interred. And that the deuil might shew how far he can besot men, the Image Arnob. contr Gent lib.5.aliam resort coulam oblcsiment Natalis Com.li. 5: ca 3.aliam. hereof was made and worshipped; the light of this darkenesse shining as farre as Greece, whose Phallus, Phallogogia, Ishiphalli, Phallophoria, and Phallophon is∣sued out of this sincke, together with their membrous monster Priapus. Athenaeus Athin.l.5.c.5 telleth of Ptol. Philadelphus in a solemnitie wherein he listed to shew to the world his madnesse; or (as it was then esteemed) his magnificence (a place worth the rea∣ding to them, who are not heere glutted with our tedious Egyptian banquet) hee a∣mong many sumptuous spectacles presented a Phallus is the image of a mans yard. Phallus of gold, painted, with gol∣den Crownes, of one hundred and twenty cubites length, hauing a golden starre on the top, whose circumference was six cubites. This was carried in a Charriot, as in o∣thers the Images of Priapus, and other Idoles. Of the Isia call rites, Laur.Pig. Mens.Isiac.ex∣posit. that brazen Table (supposed to haue been some Altar-couer) after possessed by Card. Bembus, full of mysticall Characters, explaned by Laurentius Pignorins in a Treatise of this Argument, may further acquaint the desirous Reader. Diodorus thinketh this the cause why they consecrated Goates, and erected Images of Satyres in their Temples; affirming that their Priests are first initiated in these bawdie rites. Their canonized beasts, of which the Egyptians and Syrians, (sayth De Nat. De∣orum. lib.1. Tully) con∣ceiued
stronger opinions of Deuotion, then the Romans of their most sacred Tem∣ples, were Philo. Jud. de decem praec. Ios.cont.App. Dogges, Cattes, Wolues, Crocodiles, Ichneumaons, Rammes, Goates, Bulles, and Lions, in honour of Isis: their sacred Birds were the Hawke, Ibis, Phani∣copterus: besides Dragons, Aspes, Beetles, amongst things creeping: and of fishes, whatsoeuer had scales; and the Eele. Yea their reason did not onely to sensible things ascribe Diuinitie, but garlike and onions were free of their Temples, derided there∣fore by Iuuenal. Iuuenall, Porrum & coepe nefas violare & frangere morsu: O sanctas gentes quibus haee nascuntur in hortis. Numme. Onions or Leekes by old Egyptian Rite, It was impiety to hurt or bite: Oh holy people! in whose gardens grow Their Gods, on whom deuotion they bestow. For this cause some Trem & Iun. in Genes. 43. Exod. 8. thinke the Hebrewes were in such abhomination to the Ae∣gyptians, that they would not eate with them, as eating and sacrificing those things, which the other worshipped. Example whereof Diodorus an eye-witnesse telleth, that when Ptolomey gaue entertainement to the Romans, whose friend he was decla∣red; a Roman, at vnawares hauing killed a Cat, could not by the Kings authority, sen∣ding Officers for his rescue, nor for feare of the Romans, be detained from their but∣cherly furie. For such was their custome for the murther of those sacred creatures, to put to death by exquisite torments him that had done it wittingly, and for the Bird Ibis and a Cat, although vnwittingly slaine. And therefore if any espie any of them lying dead, hee standeth aloofe lamenting and protesting his owne innocencie. The causes of this blinde zeale, were the metamorphosis of their distressed Gods into these shapes; secondly, their ancient Ensignes; thirdly, the Tusc.Qu.li.5. profit of them in common life. Origen Orig.contra Celum lib.4. addeth a fourth, because they were vsed to diuination, and therefore (saith he) forbidden to the Israelites as vncleane. Eusebius out of the Poet citeth a fift cause, namely, the Diuine Nature diffused into all creatures, after that of the Poet: Deum nam{que} ire per omnes Terras{que} tractus{que} maris caelum{que} profundum. God goes through Sea, and Land, and lofty Skies. I might adde a sixt, that μετεμψὺχωσις or transanimation which Pythagoras (it see∣meth) here honoured. If I might, with the Readers patience, I would adde somewhat of their Mysterie of iniquitie, and the mysticall sense of this iniquitie. For, as many haue sweat in vnfolding the mysteries of that Church, which spiritually is called Sodome and Aegypt, as Ambrosius de Armariolo, Amalarius, Durandus, Durantus, and others: so heere haue not wanted mysticall Interpreters, Porphyrius, Iamblicus, Plutarch and the rest. Such is the deepnesse of Satan in the shallownesse of humane both reason and truth. Water and Fire they vsed in all their Sacrifices, and do them deuoutest worship (saith Apud Euseb. de Praep.li.3.c.2. Porphyry) because those Elements are so profitable to mans vse: and for this vse sake they adored so many creatures: at Anubis they worshipped a man. But especially they held in veneration those creatures which seemed to holde some affinitie with the Sunne. Euen that stinking Beetle or Scarabee did these more blinde then Beetles in their stinking superstitions obserue, as a liuing Image of the same, because forsooth, all Scarabees are of male sex, and hauing shed their seede in the dung, do make a ball thereof, which they rowle to and fro with their feet, imitating the Sunne in his circu∣lar iourney. Eusebius followeth this Argument in the seuerall beasts which they wor∣ship: but to auoid tediousnesse, I leaue him, to looke on Plutarchs paines in this Argu∣ment. De Os. & Is. He maketh Isis to be deriued of the verb  to know, as being the God∣desse of Wisedome and Knowledge: to whom Typhon for his ignorance is an enemie. For without Knowledge Immortalitie it selfe could not deserue the name of Life, but of Time.
Their Priests shaued their owne haire, and ware not woollen but linnen garments, because of their professed puritie, to which the haire of man or beast being but an ex∣crement, disagreed: and for this cause they reiected Beeues, Mutton and Porke, as meats which cause much excrements. Yea their Apis might not drinke of Nilus, for this riuers fatning qualitie, but of a fountaine peculiar to his holinesse. At Heliopolis they might not bring wine into the Temple, holding it vnseemely to drinke in the presence of their LORD. They had many purifications wherein wine was forbidden. Their Kings, which were also Priests, had their sacred stints of wine; and did not drinke at all before Psametichus time, esteeming wine to be the bloud of them, which some∣time warred against the gods, out of whose slaine carkasses Vines proceeded, and hence proceedeth drunkennesse, and madnesse by wine. Their Priests abstaine from all fish: they eate not Onions, because they grow most in the wane of the Moone, they procure also teares and thirst. Their Kings were chosen also either of the Priests, or of the souldiours; and these also after their election, were presently chosen into the Colledge of Priests. Osiris signifieth many eyes, in the Egyptian language. Os, is much, and Eri, an eye. The Image of Minerua at Sai, had this inscription, I am all, which is, which hath beene, which shall be, whose shining light no mortall man hath opened. Ammon . Opifex intelle∣ctus qui verita∣tis est dominus & sapientiae, quatenus in ge∣nerationem pro∣grediens occul∣tam latentium rationem produ∣cit in lucem, A∣mum Aegyptiacae lingua vocant: quatenus autem sine mendacio peragit omnia Pit a nuncupa∣tur: quatenus effector bonor, Osiris aliasque denominationes habet propter potentias actio∣nesque differen∣tes. Iamblichus de Mysterijs. they call Am (the same as is before said with Ham or Cham the sonne of Noah) in the vocatiue case, as inuocating him, whom they hold the chiefe GOD of the world, to manifest himselfe. They esteemed children to haue a diuining facultie, and obserued the voices of children playing in the Temples, and speaking at aduen∣ture, as Oracles, because Isis seeking after Osiris, had enquired of children. They in∣terpret Astronomically the Dog-starre to belong to Isis; the Beare, to Typhon; Orion, to Horus. The Inhabitants of The bais acknowledged nothing for GOD which was mortall; but worshipped Cneph, which they said, had neither beginning nor ending. So many are the interpretations in their mysticall Theologie, that Truth must needs be absent, which is but One: and these may rather seeme subtle fetches of their Priests, to gull their people, then the true intents of their first authors of Idolatrie. Because Typhon was of red colour, they consecrated red Bulls, in which yet there might not be one haire blacke or white. They esteemed it not a sacrifice acceptable to the gods, but contrarie, as which had receiued the soules of wicked men: and therefore they cursed the head of the sacrifice, which they hurled into the riuer: and since haue vsed to sell to strangers. The diuell happily would teach them an apish imitation of that sacrifice of the red Cow, Numb. 19. The Priests abhorre the sea, as wherein Nilus dieth; and salt is forbidden them, which they call Typhons spittle. In Sai, in the Porch of Mineruaes Temple, was pictured an Infant, an old man, a Hauke, a Fish, and a Sea-horse. The mystery was, O yee that are borne, and die, GOD hateth shamelesse persons. The Hauke signified GOD, the Fish hatred, the Sea-horse impudencie. By their Osiris and Typhon, they signified the good and euill, whereof we haue not onely vicssitudes, but mixtures, in all these earthly things. And heere Plutarch is large in shewing the opinion of these wise-men, which when they saw so much euill, and knew withall that good could not bee the cause of euill, they imagined two begin∣ings, one whereof they called GOD, the other Deuill: the good, Orimazes; the bad, Arimanius. This opinion is fathered on Zoroastres, Betwixt these two was Mi∣thres, whom the Persians called a Mediator. So the Chaldaeans had among the Pla∣nets, two good, two bad, three of middle disposition. The Grecians, their Iupiter and Dis, and Harmonia begotten of Venus & Mercury. Empedocles called the one Friend∣shippe, the other Discord: the Pythagoreans Vid.Soc.lib. I.cap.17. call the good, One, bounded, abiding, right, square, &c. The other, Duplicitie, infinite, moued, crooked, long, &c. Anaxa∣goras, the minde and infinitenesse; Aristotle, Forme and Priuation. Plato, the Same, and Another. Hence appeareth how true it is, that I.Cor.2.14. the Naturallmen perceiue not the things of GOD, nor can know them: and hence grew the Manichaean heresie. All Nat.Com.lib.6. & 8. the deformitie and defect of things, Plutarch ascribeth to Typhon (whome they also called Seth, Bebon, and Sy, saith Pignorius) that which is good, to Osiris,
and Isis The hornes of Isis (for so they picture her) are by Suidas ascribed to that fable of Io, which some say is Isis. , to this the matter, to him the forme. In the Towne of Idithya they burned liuing men, whom they called Typhonians, scattering their ashes, and bringing them to nothing. This was openly done in Dog-daies. But when they sacrificed any of their sacred beasts, it was done closely, and at vncertaine times. He that would further be acquainted with these mysteries, let him resort to Eusebius and Plutarch. Iamblichus hath written a large Treatise, De Mysterijs, where the more curious Reader may fur∣ther satisfie himselfe. Hee mustereth in their rankes and order, first the Gods, then Arch-angles, next Angels, then Daemones, after them Heroes, Principalities and Soules in their subordinate orders. Marsilius M. Fic. in lamb. transla∣ted according to Proclus. Ficinus doth thus dispose his Egyptian my∣steries, or mysticall opinions of GOD. The first in order is, Vnum Super Ens. The se∣cond, Vnum Ens, or Vnitas Entis. The third, Intellectus Intelligibilis, Prima Icthon. The fourth, Emeph, the Captaine of the heauenly Deities. The fift, Captaine of the work∣men of the world, the vnderstanding of the soule of the world, called Amun, Phtha, Vulcan Osiris. But these wayes are too rough, cragged and thornie for a daintie tra∣ueller: they that will, may reade Iamblichus, Proclus, Porphyrius, translated by Marsi∣lius Ficinus. Mercurius Trismegistus (so called, Gen.Dier. lib.2. cap.8. because he was thrice greatest King, Priest, and Philosopher) was (saith Lact.lib.1.c.6. Lactantius) called Thoth or Thoyth, of whom they na∣med their first moneth, acknowledging to haue receiued their lawes and letters from him. He built the Citie Hermopolis, and of the Saits was honored for a god. Of him also Augustine De Ciuit, 'Dei.lib.8. cap.26. illustrated by the Annotations of Vines, will further acquaint you. Fran. Patrici Zoreaster. Franciscus Patricius (as he hath taken great paines, out of Psellus, Ioannes Picus, and others, for the opening of the Assyrian, and Chaldaean opinions, and hath collected three hundred and twenty Oracles, and sacred sentences of Zoroaster, so he) hath with F. P. Her. Tris∣megist. Graco∣lat no lesse industry published twenty bookes of Hermes or Mercury Trismegistus. He af∣firmeth that there were two of that name, the one Grand-father to the other: the elder of which was councellour and instructer of Isis, and the scholler of Noah. He had a son named Tat, which begate the second Hermes, which Hermes had a son also called Tat, by which likenes in name great confusion and vnlikelihoods haue happened in historie. This second Hermes (hee supposeth) liued in the dayes of Moses, but was somewhat more ancient. Both the elder and yonger were writers, as he sheweth out of their workes: and called Trismegists, not for that he was greatest King, Priest, and Philosopher, as Ficinus, saith, nor for their cleare sentences touching the Holy Trinity, but (as the French vse the word thrice, for the Superlatiue) as men thrice or most ex∣cellent in learning. The same Patricius hath set forth three Treatises of Asclepius: of which name were three learned Aegyptians, Asclepius Vulcani, inuenter of Physike, Asclepius Imuthes, inuenter of Poetry, and another which had no sur-name, to whom Asclepius de sole & damonib. l.. Hermes dedicated some of his bookes; and the same Asclepius in the beginning of his first booke, calls himselfe the scholler of Hermes. In the writings of these Aegyptians, translated into Greeke, and explaned by the Aegyptian Priests, the Greeke Philoso∣phers, especially the Platonikes and Pythagoreans, learned their Diuine, Morall, and Naturall Philosophy. Antiquitie and Learning hold vs longer in these mens compa∣nie; the more curious may haue recourse to their owne workes. Twenty thousand bookes are ascribed to Hermes: some say thirty six thousand fiue hundred twentie fiue. He in his Asclepius, Asclep.cap.9. translated by Apuleius, thus writeth. Aegypt is the Image of heauen, and the Temple of the whole world. But the time shall come when the Ae∣gyptiā deuotiō shall proue vaine, & their pietie frustrate: for the Diuinitie shall returne to heauen, and Aegypt shall be forsaken of her gods. And no maruell, seeing that these gods were Idols, the workes of mens hands, as himselfe Cap.13. after sheweth: and when as they could not make soules, they called, Origen.cont.Celsum lib. 4. saith, that a∣mong other spels they vsed to adiure di∣uels in the name of the God of Israel, God of the He. brewes, God that drowned the Egyptians in the red sea. or coniured into them the soules of diuels or an∣gels, by which the Images might haue power to doe good or euill. For thy Grand∣father, O Asclepius, saith he was the first inuēter of Physike, to whom is a Temple con∣secrated in a mountaine of Libya, where his worldly man (his body) resteth: for the rest
or rather his whole selfe is gone to heauen, and doth now heale men by his Deitie, as then by his Physike. The same doth This might be that Mere. of whom Tully saith, Quem Aegyptij nefas pu∣tant nominare. De N.D.lib.3. Mercury my grandfather, preseruing all such as resort to him. Much may the willing Reader learne further of their superstitions, which he thus freely confesseth in that Author, whose prophecie, GOD bethanked, by the bright and powerfull Sunne-shine of the Gospell, was long since effected. CHAP. IIII. Of the Rites, Priests, Sects, Sacrifices, Feasts, Inuentions; and other obseruations of the Aegyptians. THus farre haue we launched out of their History, into their Mysteries. To returne to the relation of their Beasts and bestiall superstitions. Lucian Lucian. de Astrologia. saith, That this Apis represented the Celestian Bul, and other beasts which they worshipped, other signes in the Zodiake. They that respected the Constellation of Pisces, did eate no fish, nor a Goat, if they regarded Capricorne,. Aries a heauenly Constellation, was their heauenly deuotion: and not heere alone, but at the Oracle of Iupiter Ammon. Strabo lib.17. Strabo saith, That they nourished many, which they accoūted sacred, but not gods. This nou∣rishment, after Diod. Sic.l.1. Diodorus, was in this sort: first they cōsecrated vnto their maintenance sufficient lands. Such Votaries also as had recouered their children from some dange∣rous sicknesse, accustomed to shaue their haire, and putting it in gold or siluer, offered it to their Priests. The Haukes they fed with gobbets of flesh, and birdes catched for them. The Cats and Ichneumons, with bread, and milke, and fish: and likewise the rest. When they goe their Processions, with these beasts displayed in their Banners, euery one falleth downe and doth worshippe. When any of them dieth, it is wrapped in fine linnen, salted and embalmed with Cedar and sweete oyntments, and buried in a ho∣ly place, the reasonlesse men howling and knocking their breasts, in the exequies of these vnreasonable beasts. Yea, when famine hath driuen them to eate mans flesh, the zeale of deuotion hath preserued vntouched these sacred Creatures. And if a Dogge die in a house, all in that houshold shaue themselues, and make great lamen∣tation. If Wine, Wheate or other food be found, where such a beast lieth dead, su∣perstition forbiddeth further vse of it. Principall men, with principall meats, are ap∣pointed to nourish them in the circuit of their Temples. They bathe and annoint them with odoriferous oyntments. And they prouide to euery one of them a female of his owne kinde. Their death they bewaile no lesse, then of their owne children: In their funeralls they are exceeding prodigall. In the time of Ptolomaeus Lagi, theis Apis or Bull of Memphis being dead, the Keeper be∣stowed ou his funerall, ouer and aboue the ordinarie allowance and offerings, fiftie talents of siluer borrowed of Ptolomey. And in our age, saith Diodorus, an eye-witnesse of these his relations, some of these Nourishers haue bestowed an hundred ta∣lents on this last expence. After the death of this Bull, which they call Apis, was made a solemne and publike lamentation, which they testified by shauing their heads, al∣though their purple lockes might compare with those of Nisus, saith Luc.de Sacra. Lucian: and after his buriall Solin.Am.Marc. were an hundred Priests employed, in search of another like the for∣mer; which being found, was brought to the Citie Nilus, and there nourished fortie dayes. Then they conueyed him into a close shippe, hauing a golden habitacle, in which they carried him to Memphis, and there placed him in the Temple of Vulcan for a god. At his first comming Euseh. praepar. Euang.lib.2.c.1. onely women were permitted to see him, who I know not in what hellifh mysterie, lifting vp their garments, shewed him Natures se∣crets, and from thence-forth might neuer be admitted the sight of him. At his first finding, the people cease their funerall lamentations. At his solemne receiuing into Memphis, they obserue a seuenth dayes festiuall, with great concourse of people. His consecration was done by one wearing a Diadem on his head. They made the people
beleeue he was conceiued of lightning. He Strabo l.17. had a Chappell assigned to him, and cal∣led by his name. He was kept in a place enclosed, before which was a Hall; and in that another enclosed roome, for the Dame or Mother of Apis. Into this Hall they brought him, when they would present him to strangers. Psammetichus was the founder of this building, borne vp with collosses, or huge statues of twelue cubits, instead of Pillars, and grauen full of figures. Once a yeare Solinus. Plutarch. he had sight of a female, chosen by especi∣all markes, and slaine the same day. On a set day, which he might not outliue, accor∣ding to their rituall bookes, they drowned him in the bottome of a sacred fountaine: and then buried him as aforesaid, with much mourning. After this solemnitie it was lawfull for them to enter into the Temple of Serapis. Darius to curry fauour with the Aegyptians, offered an hundred talents to him that could find out a succeeding Apis. Of this Apis, thus writeth De Ciuit.Dei.lib.18.cap.5. Augustine. Apis was the King of the Argiues, who sailing into Aegypt, and there dying, was worshipped by the name of Serapis, their greatest god. This name Serapis was giuen him (saith Varro) of his funerall Chest called in Greeke , and from thence Sorapis, as if one should say, Sorosapis, after Serapis. It was enacted, that whosoeuer should affirme, that he had beene a man, should be done to death. Hence it is, that in the Aegyptian Temples Harpocrates, an Image holding his finger on his mouth, is ioyned a companion to Isis and Serapis, in token of concea∣ling their former humanitie. Suidas Suidas. saith, that Alexander built vnto him a magnificent Temple, of which, and of this Serapis we shall largely declare in the next Chapter. Vi∣ues out of Nymphoderus saith, that this carkasse in that Chest, whereof the name Serapis was diuided; was of a Bull, not of a man. Eusebius Euseb. Chron. nameth two Kings called by this name Apis, one a Sicyonian, the other of Argos: the first more ancient; the other the son of Iupiter and Niobe, called after Serapis. But Apollodorus affirmeth him the son of Phoroneus, and brother of Niobe. and therefore the Sicyonian King is more likely to be the Aegyptian Apis, builder of Memphis: for the other (saith Scal.in Eus. he) died in Pelo∣ponnesus, which of him was called Apia. The markes Viu. in Aug. de Ciu Dei. lib. 13.cap.5. of the next Apis were these; All his body was blacke, with a white starre in his forehead, after Herodotus, or in his right side, saith Pliny, like vnto a horned Moone. For he was sacred to the Moone, saith Mar∣cellinus. On his back he had the shape of an Eagle, a knot on his tongue like a Beetle. If such an one, might seeme to some impossible to be found, as no doubt it was rare, and therefore costly; Augustine Vbi supra. attributeth it to the diuels working, presenting to the Cow in her conception such a fantasticall apparition, the power of which imagination appeareth Gen.30.39. in Iacobs example. But what a beastly stirre haue we heere (me thinkes I heare some whining Reader say) about beasts Varijsq, colo∣ribus Apis. Ouid. Met 9. and Bulls. I answere that it deserueth the more ful relation, both for the multitude of Authors, which mention something of this History, for the antiquitie, and especially for the practise of the same superstition, Bulling.

Bacis Macrob. another that was fained to change colour euery houre, at Her∣munthus besides Onuphis, and Menuphis other where. Thus by sinne beastes became gods, men became beasts, if this be not a baser degree of basenesse to worship beasts, and in them diuels: to content themselues with meane houses, and neuer to be conten∣ted with the magnificence and sumptuousnes of their Temples to beasts.

That is, They haue glorious Chappels, with Groues: and stately Temples, with goodly gate-wayes and porches: but when you are within once, ye shal see nothing but a Cat (or some such Carrion) worshipped, &c. We are further to know, that although Aegypt worshipped beasts, yet not all, the same: These Strabo lib.17. Stuckius de sa∣cris sacrificijs{que} Gentilium, de his fusion. only were vniuersally receiued: three beasts, a Dog, a Cat, a Bull: two fowles; the Hauke & the Ibis: two fishes; Lepidotus and Oxyrinchus. Other beasts haue their sects of worshippers; as a Sheepe among the Thebans and Saits; the fish called Latus among the Latopolitans: a Cynocephalus at Hermopolis (which is a kind of great
Ape or Monkie naturally circumcised, and abhorring from fish) a Wolfe at Lycopolis. The Babylonians neere to Memphis, worshipped a beast called Cepus, resembling in the face a Satyre, in other parts, partly a Dog, partly a Beare: likewise other Cities, o∣ther beasts, which caused great distention, whereof Iuuen. Sat.15. Iuuenal.

Strabo saw, in the nomus or shire of Arsinoe, diuino honot giuen to a Crocodile, kept tame in a certaine lake by the Priests, and named Suchus, nourished with bread, wine, and flesh, which the Pilgrimes that came to visite him offered. Now the Ten∣tyrites, and those of Elephantina killed Crocodiles. And in the Citie of Hercules they worshipped an Ichneumon, a beast that destroyeth Crocodiles and Aspes, and there∣fore euen at this day of much estimation, as Bellonius P. Bell. ob. obserueth, where you may see his description. These imagined that Typhon was transformed into a Crocodile. At Hermopolis they worshipped a Goat: and Goats had carnall mixture with women. Volat. The Ombites (more beastly) esteemed themselues fauoured of their Crocodile god, if he filled his paunch with the flesh and bloud of their dearest children. King Menas built a Citie called Crocodile, and dedicated the neighbour-fenne to their food. They were as scrupulous in the vse of meates: some Diodor.Sic. lib.1. abstained from Cheese, some from Beanes, some from Onions, or others after their owne fancie. This multiplicitie of sects is ascribed to the policie of their ancient Kings, according to that rule, Diuide and Rule. For it was not likely they would ioyne in conspiracie, whom Religion (the most mortall make-bate) had disioyned. They held Serpents in so sacred account, L. Pig.mens. Isiac.exp. that Osiris is neuer painted without them: and Iosophus Ios.cont.Ap.lib.2. saith, That it was reckoned a happines (which I thinke few would enuy them) to be bitten of Aspes, as also to be deuoured of Crocodiles. Venemous was that old Serpent, which both heere, and in other Nations, then, and at this day, hath procured diuine honor to this first instrument of Hell: As if he wòuld thus exalt this trophee of his ancient conquest, in despite both of GOD and Man, in that Crea∣ture whereby man perished, and which GOD had cursed: except we will rather attri∣bute it to a diuellish malice, or apish imitation of that brasen Serpent set vp by MOSES Iohn 3.14. in the wildernesse, the figure of CHRIST crucified, who brake this Serpents head. Ie∣remy the Prophet was stoned (some Vines in August. say) at Tanis in Egypt, and was after worship∣ped of the Inhabitants there (such was their difference of Sects) for his present reme∣dying the Stings of Serpents. I thinke by this time, either my relation, or their superstition is tedious: and yet I haue not mentioned other their gods, both stincking and monstrous. Loath am I to search the waters for their deified Frogges, and Hippopotami, or play the scauenger, to present you with their Beetle-gods out of their priuies: yea their priuies Ortel. ex Cle∣ment. & Min. Foelice. and farts had their vnsauoury canonization, and went for Egyptian Deities; lettice sutable to such lippes. Lesse brutish, though not lesse Idolatrous, was it in Ptolomaeus Philopator, Ael. Var.lib.13.cap.22. to erect a Temple to Homer, in which his Image was placed, comely sitting enuiro∣ned with those Cities which challenged him for theirs. Their sacrifices were so diuersified in their kinds, that Peucer Peuc. de Di∣uinat. saith, They had six hundred three score and six seuerall sorts of them: some they had peculiar to speciall gods, Sard.lib.3.15. as to the Sunne, a Cocke, a Swanne, a Bull; to Venus, a Doue; to the celestiall signes, such things as held correspondent similitude. Besides their sacrifices of red men to Osiris. Busiris Tristes{que} Busi∣ridis ara is said to haue offered Thrasius (first author of that counsell, worst to the counseller) thereby to appease angry Nilus, that in nine yeares had not ouerflow∣ed. They offered euery day three men at Heliopolis, instead of which bloudie Rites Amasis after substituted so many waxen Images. Thus were their gods beastly, their sacrifices inhumane, or humane rather too much:
Other things they obserued of their owne inuention, framing to themselues deformed and compounded shapes, whose Images they adored. Such were their Canopi, swad∣led as it were in clouts (so resembling Orus) with heads of Dogges or other creatures. Osiris Tab. Isiaca Bembi. is sometime seene with the head of a Hauke, Isis with the head of a Lion, Ann∣bis alway with the head of a Dogge, and contrariwise beasts pictured with the heads of Osiris and Isis: monstrous mishapen figures, of mishapen monstrous mysteries. They borrowed of the Iewes abstinence from Swines-flesh and circumcision of their males, to which they added excision of their females, still obserued of the Christi∣ans in those parts. They so abhorre Swine, Herod.lib.2. that if one by the way touch them, he pre∣sently washeth himselfe and his garments. Neither may a Swineheard haue accesse in∣to their temples or marry with their daughters. Yet doe they offer wine to the Moone and Bacchus (Isis and Osiris) when the Moone is at full. In this sacrifice they burne the taile, milt and leafe: and (which on another day would be piacular) on that day of the full they eat the rest. The Egyptians Drus.de 3. sectis lib.2. sware by the head of their King, which oath, whosoeuer violated, lost his life for the same, without any redemption. Their Priests in old time renowned for their learning, in Straboes time were igno∣rant & vnlearned. No woman Io. Bocm.lib.1.cap.5. might beare Priestly function. These Priests might not eat egges, milke, or oile (except with sallads) they might not salute mariners, nor looke vpon their children or kinsfolks. They Sard.l.3.c.18. Herod lib.2. washed themselues in the day-time thrice, & in the night twice: they were shauen, ware linnen garments alwayes new washed, were daily allowed sacred meats. Du Bartas Colonies. Of their ancient Priests, thus Du Bartas singeth in Sylu∣sters tune; The Memphian Priests were deepe Philosophers, And curious gazers on the sacred Stars; Searchers of Nature, and great Mathematickes, Ere any letter knew the ancient'st Attickes. When they sacrificed, they made choice of their Beastes by certaine religi∣ous markes: (a Cow they might not sacrifice, as consecrated vnto Isis:) they kindled a fire, and sprinkling water ouer the sacrifice, with inuocation of their God killed it, cut off the head, which either they sold to the Graecians, if they would buy it, or cast into the Riuer, with imprecation, That whatsoeuer euill was imminent to them or their countrey, might be turned vpon that head. This ceremonie Gremmay. As seemeth to haue come to them with many other from the Iewes. And they haue been as liberall of their rites since to the Catholikes (for so they will be called) as appeareth both by this relation, and by the testimony, not only of Moresinus Moresin Dep. rel. a Protestant, but Maginus, Magini. Ptol. Pol de inuento.ribus. Beroal. in Apu∣leiums. Polidorus, Boemus and Beroaldus, Popish writers, although daubed ouer with new mysticall significations, as in Bellarmine and other the purest Catholikes is seene. Their Priests Draudius in Solinum. were their Iudges, the eldest of which was chiefe in pronoun∣cing sentence. He ware Aelian. Var.hist.lib.13. about his necke a Saphire-iewel, with the Image of TRVTH therein ingrauen. The Priests Alex.ab Alex. Gen dier.l.2.c.8. of Isis, besides their shauings and linnen garments, had paper-shooes; on their heads, Anubis; in their hands, a Timbrell, or a branch of sea∣worme wood, or a Pine-apple. They had one chiefe Priest, or Primate of Egypt, as ap∣peareth Ios. cont. Ap. lib.t.is qui super Aegyptiaca sacra erat constitutus. Hel. hist. Aeth. lib.7. Herod lib.2. saith that they had 41. Priests and as many Kings before his time. by Iospus and Heliodorus, who maketh Thyamis to succeed his father Ca∣lasyris in this high Priesthood at Memphis. Manetho also enioyed this Pontificall Hie∣rarchy, as appeareth by his Epistle to Ptolomaeus, which after shall follow. Philostratus Philost. dev't. Apoll. lib.6.c.3. speaketh of Gymnosophists, which some ascribe to India; Heliodorus to Aethiopia; he to Aethiopia & Egypt. These, saith he, dwelt abroad without house, on a hil a little off the banks of Nilus, where grew a Groue, in which they held their general Aslemblies, to consult of publike affaires, hauing otherwise their studies & sacrifices apart, each by himself. Thespesion was the chief of this monkish Colledge, when Apollonius after his vi∣sitatiō of the Babylonian Mag, and Indian Brachmanes. Domitiano imperatore. came thither. These held the immortality of the soule, and accounted Nilus for a god. If a man at Memphis had by chance-medly killed a man, he was exiled till those Gymnosophists absolued him. Hercules Temple at Canopus was priuiledged with Sanctuary, to giue immunity to fugitiues, and malefactors: thus elswhere Osiris; Apollo, in Syria; Diana, at Ephesus; eue∣ry Cardinals house (saith Pius 2 Asia. a Pope) in Rome; Saint Peter, Pol. Vir.l.3. at Westminster; and other Popish Oratories, priuiledged dennes of theeues.
Their Feasts were many: of which, Herod. lib.2. Herodotus reckoneth one at Bubastis, in ho∣nour of Diana. To this place the men and women, at this festiuall solemnitie, sayled in great multitudes, with Minstrelsie and shoutings; and as they came to any Citie on the waters side, they went on shore, and the women, some daunced, some played, some made a brawle with the women of the place: and thus resorting to Bubastis, they there offered great sacrifices, spending in this Feast more Wine then in all the yeare besides. Hither resorted of men and women, besides children, seuen hundred thousand. In Bu∣siris was solemnized the Feast of Isis, in which, after the sacrifice, many thousands beat themselues: but with what they did beat themselues, was not lawfull to relate. The Carians that inhabited Egypt did also cut their forheads with swords, signifying there∣by, that they were foreiners. This Citie was in the middest of the Egyptian Delta, and in it, a very great Temple of Isis. A third Feast was at Sai, in honour of Minerua, where assembling, by night they lighted candles full of Salt & Oyle, & therewith went about the walls of the Citie: This solemnitie was called Light-burning, or if you will, Can∣dlemasse. This night they which came not hither, yet obserued the setting vp of lights throughout Egypt. A fourth was at Heliopolis, in honor of the Sunne. A fist at Butus, of Latona, wherein only sacrificing was vsed. At Papremus was obserued the solemni∣tie of Mars, with sacrifices, but till Sunne-set, only a few Priests were busied about the Image: a greater number of thē stood before the dores of the Temple with woodden clubbes, & ouer-against them aboue a thousand men that payd their vowes, each with clubbes in their hands, who the day before caried the Image out of a gilded Chappell of Timber into another sacred roome; those few which were chosen for the Idoll-ser∣uice, drawing a Wagon with 4. wheeles, on which the Chappell & Image were carried. Those that stood at the Porch, forbad these to enter; but the Votaries, to helpe their God, beat & draue them backe. Here began a great clubbe-fray, in which many were wounded, & many (although the Egyptians concealed it) died of the woūds. The cause (forsooth) was because here was shrined the mother of Mars to whō her sonne, at ripe age, resorted to haue lyen with, but was repelled by her seruants: whereupon, he pro∣curing helpe elsewhere, was reuenged of them. Hence grew that solemnitie. On the 7. day of the moneth Tybi Hospin. de F. st. c. 7. (which answereth to our Ianuarie & December) was solemnised the cōming of Isis out of Phenscia; in which many things were done in despight of Typhon. The Captites then hurled downe and Asse frō a steepe place, & abu∣sed ruddie men for this cause. They had Plut. also, in their Bacchanall-solemnities, most filthie Rites, in which being drunken, they carried Images of a cubit length, with the pnuie member of a monstrous size, with Musicke, accópanied with the elder Matrons. This yard, which they called Phallus, was vsually made of Figge-tree. Herodotus, l.2. saith, That besides their Swine-Feast they obserued another to Bacchus, without Swine, in like sort as the Grecians: in which, they had cubitall Images made of sinews, or, as Coelius Coel. Rhod l.. 16. readeth it, made to be drawne to and fro with sinewes or strings, carried by women. In the moneth Thoth (which most-what agreeth to September) the 19. day Plut. ibid. was holy to Mercurie, in which they did eate Honey and Figges, saying withall, Truth is sweet. On the 9. day of this moneth they obserued another Feast, wherein euery man before his dore did eate rosted Fish: the Priests did not eate, but burne the same. Before was mentioned the seeking of Osiris, alway sought (sayth Lactantius) and alwaies found. This was an Egyptian Feast obserued in the moneth Athyr (which answereth some what to Nouember) from the seuenteenth day (in which they imagi∣ned that Osyris perished) foure dayes were spent in mourning: the causes were foure; Nilus slaking, the Windes then blowing, the Dayes shortening, the Winter approa∣ching. Here is the mysterie vnfolded. On the nineteenth day they went by night to the Sea, and brought forth a sacred Chest, in which was a golden Boxe, into which they poured water, and made a shout, That Osyris was found. Then they mingled the Earth with Water, adding Spices and costly Perfumes, and made an Image of the Moone, applying these mysticall Rites to the nature of the Earth and Water. About the Winter Solstice they carried a Cow seuen times about the Temple Hosp. c.27. , in remem∣brance of the Sunnes circuit, which in the 7. month would be in the Summer Solstice.
The originall of Isis seeking Osiris, is before shewed. Some make Typhon the hus∣band of Isis, which slew Osiris her sonne, or brother (as diuers diuersly esteeme him) for Incest committed with her, and cut him in pieces. Anubis her Huntsman, by helpe of his dogges, found out the pieces againe. This (saith Minutius M. F.octav. Arnob. contra gentles, l.2. Felix) is resembled euery yeare, Nec desinunt annis omnibus vel perdere quod inneniunt vel innenire quod por∣dunt. Hac Aeptia quondā nunc & sacra Romana sunt. Truly the Playes of CHRIST his Crucifying and Resurrection, which is obserued in all Churches of the Romant Religion yearely, might seeme to haue had this Egyptian originall. Once, Index ex∣purgatorius hath cut out Viues Tongue, where he speaketh against them, in annot. Aug. de Crv. Dei, cap.vlt. This Feast is also mentioned by Iulius Firmius and others. They had another Feast called Pamylia, of Pamyle the nurse of Osiris, who going to fetch water, heard a voice, bidding her proclaime, That a great King and Benefactor, was borne. On this holiday was carried in Procession an Image with three stones, or (as Plutarch de Osir. sayth) with a three-fold yard, in which beastly Rite he findeth a foolish mysterie, not worth the telling. But I thinke this Feast of Feasts hath glutted euery man. The Egyptians had many Oracles of Hercules, Apollo, Minerua, Diana, Mars, Iu∣piter, and others. The Oracle of Latona at Butys Peucer de Diuinat. told Cambyses, That he should die at Ecbatana, whereby he secured himselfe for Syria, and yet there died, in an obscure village of that name, whereas he had interpreted it of the great Citie in Media. Their Apis and Serapis were also esteemed Oracles. Annibal was deceiued by the Oracle of Serapis, telling him of his death, which he construed of Libya, and fell out in a place of the same name in Bithynia. At Memphis a Cow, at Heliopolis the Bull Mneus, at Arsinoe the Crocodiles were their Oracles. But it were too tedious to relate the rest. Somewhat of the Egyptian inuentions. Husbandrie Laur. coru. by some is ascribed to them, but falsely, Adam, Cain, Noah, and others were in this before them. Astronomie also is not their inuention, but Ios.Ant.l.8. taught them by Abraham. Dom. Neg. Aph. Com. 3. Cic.de div. l. I. A. Thevel. de mundo nono, c.4. Geometrie is more like to be theirs, driuen to seeke out this Art by Nilus ouerflowing. Idolatrie to the Starres was first here practised (sayth Lactantius:) for lying on the roofes of their houses (as yet they doe) without any other Canopie then the Azure Skie, first they beheld, then stu∣died, lastly adored them. Magicke is also ascribed to them; of whose timely professors Iannes and Iambres are an instance. Physicke is fetched also from hence; and Wri∣ting, both after the vulgar sort, as also that of the Priests, Hieroglyphicall, where of Ho∣ropallo an Egyptian, Pierius, Goropius, besides Mercerus and Hoeschelius, with others, haue written. Aelianus L.14. 34. accounteth Mercurie the first inuenter of their Lawes. The women in Egypt did performe the offices which belonged to the men, buying, selling, and other businesse abroad; the men spinning and performing household-taske. This Elogie or commendation is giuen them by Martial: Niliacis primum puer hic nascatur in oris, Nequitias tellus scit dare nulla magis: From Egypt (sure) the boyes birth may proceede, For no Land else such knauerie can breede. And Propertius: Noxia Alexandria dolis aptissima tellus, The place where Alexandria doth stand, Is noysome, and a Conny-catching Land. We may here adde out of Flauius Vopiscus Flav. Vopisc. Saturninus. Trebellius Pollio testifieth the like in his Tri∣ginta Tyranis. a testimonie of the qualities of the E∣gyptians. They are (saith he) inconstant, furious, braggarts, iniurious; also vaine, li∣centious, desirous of nouelties, euen vnto common Songs and Ballads, Versifiers, Epi∣grammatists, Mathematicians, Wisards, Physicians both for Christians and Samari∣tans; and alway things present, with an vnbridled libertie, are distastfull to them. He bringeth also, for witnesse of this assertion, Aelius Adrianus, who in an Epistle to Servianus, affirmeth thus.
I haue learned all Egypt to be light, wauering, and turning with euery blast of fame. They which worship Serapis, are Christians, and euen they which call them∣selues Bishops of CHRIST, are deuoted to Serapis. No Ruler is there of the Iewish Synagogue, no Samaritan, no Christian Priest, which is not a Mathematician, a Wizard, a Chirurgion (or annointer of Champions.) This kinde of men is most seditious, most vaine, most iniurious: The Citie (Ale∣xandria) rich, wealthie, fruitfull, in which none liues idle. Goutie men haue somewhat to doe, blinde men haue somewhat to doe, or haue somewhat which they may make; nor are the goutie-fingered idle. They haue one GOD; him doe the Christians, him doe the Iewes, him doe they all worship. I wish them nothing else, but that they may be fedde with their owne Pullen, which how they make fruitfull, I am ashamed to tell. Thus much Adrinaus. The Pullen he speaketh of, it seemeth, are such, as euen to this day they vse to hatch (not vnder the Henne, but) in furnaces of dung and ashes, wherein thou∣sands of Egges are layed for that purpose. That which hee speaketh of the Christi∣ans, is either of some Heretikes, or luke-warme Time-seruers to be vnderstood: or else remember, that it was Adrian, an Ethnicke, whose intelligence was from such as himselfe, in those times hating the Christians; of whome, through blinde zeale of their Idolatrie, what did they? What did they not faine and deuile? Euen more o∣dious then here is expressed, as Ecclesiasticall Histories shew. The Iewes had gi∣uen Adrian cause, by their Treasons, to hate them, and flatterers opportunitie to be∣lye them. Let him that loues me, tell my tale. But a man would maruell to heare Adrian blame the Egyptians so much for that, for which himselfe in Authors is so much blamed; namely, Superstition and Sorcerie. For hee made Images of Antmous, which hee erected almost in all the World, sayth Dionis Nicai Adr. Dion. This Antinous was in high estimation with him (some thinke, his minion:) He died in Egypt, either drowned in Nilus, as Adrian writeth, or (which is the truth) was sacrificed. For whereas Adrian was exceeding curious, and addi∣cted to Diuinations and Magicall Arts of all kindes (in the hellish Rites whereof was required the Soule of such a one as would die voluntarily) Antinous refused it not, and therefore was thus honoured, and had a Citie in Egypt newly repaired from the ruines, and dedicated in his name. Yea, Aelius Spati∣anus in Adriano. hee reported hee saw a new Starre, which (forsooth) was the Soule of this Antinous. The Greekes made a God of him, and a giuer of Oracles. Ammianus Marcellinus Am. Marc. l.22. ascribeth to the Egyptians a contentious numour, addicted to lawing and quarrells, assuetudine perplexous litigands semper laetissimum. Their vanitie and superstition may further appeare by that which Diophantes Diophantes Lacedem. apud Stuckium de sae∣cris. re∣cordeth of one Syrophanes, a rich Egyptian; who doting on his sonne yet liuing, dedicated an Image in his house vnto him, to which the seruants at any time, when they had displeased their Master, betooke themselues, adorning the same with Flowers and Garlands, so recouering their Masters fauour. Some Coelius Rhodig. Lectionum antiq. l.16.3. make the Egyp∣tians first inuenters of Wine (which, they say, was first made in the Egyptian Citie Plinthis) and of Beere, to which end they first made Mault of Barley, for such places as wanted Grapes. When a man proued more in shew then in substance (as hypoctites, whome the Truth it selfe calleth Whited Tombes) the Prouerbe tearmed him an Egyptian Tem∣ple, because those buildings were sumptuous and magnificent for matter and forme to the view, but the Deitie therein worshipped, was a Cat, Dogge, or such other con∣temptible creature. The naturall furie Polyb. Hist.l.15.c.31. Exod.1. and crueltie vsed amongst the Egyptians, hath also made them infamous among Authors, both Prophane and Diuine. But least I also should impose too cruell a taske on my more willing Readers, I will proceede to other obseruations. I haue here, in this Egyptian Relation of their Rites, Manners, and Mysteries, beene the larger, both because Authors are herein plentifull,
and especially because Aegypt hath beene an old storer and treasurer of these my∣sticall Rites for that later vpstart, the Mysticall Babylon, in the West; which, as she is spiritually called Sodome and Aegypt, so like that strumpet mentioned by Pro.7.10. Salomon, hath not a little decked her bed with the Ornaments, Carpets, and Laces of Aegypt. Wiser were the Romans Dion.Cass.l.54 of old, which made diuerse Lawes to expell the Aegyptian Rites out of their Citie, which the later Popes entertaine. CHAP. V. Of the manifold alterations of State and Religion in Aegypt by the Persians, Graecians, Romans, Christians, Saracens, and Turkes: with the Aegyptian Chronologie, since the beginning of that Nation till our Times. THe last Aegyptian Pharao was Psamminitus, vanquished by Camby∣ses, sonne of Cyrus the Persian, who quite extinguished that Aegyptian Gouernment, and much eclipsed their superstitious solemnities. For Herod.l.3. Cambyses proclaimed desiance, not to the persons onely of the Aegyptians, but to their Gods also: yea, he set their sacred Beasts in the forefront of his battaile, that being thus shielded by their owne deuotion, he might easily ruinate the Kingdome. Such a disaduantage is Superstition to her followers, being indeede but a life-lesse carkasse of true Religion, which alway breedeth true Fortitude; as Ptolomey and the Romanes vsed the like stratageme a∣gainst the Iewes on their Sabbath, which (in it selfe a diuine Commaundement) they construed to a superstitious Rest, a Sacrifice without Mercie, wherein they might helpe their Beasts, but suffer themselues, like Beasts, to be ledde to the slaughter. Cambyses hauing pulled downe their Temples in Aegypt, intended Iustin. l.1. as much to the Oracle of Iupiter Ammon, in which Exploit he employed fiftie thousand men, which (as the Ammonians report) were ouer-whelmed with a tempest of Sand. O∣ther newes of them was neuer heard. Himselfe meane-while, meanely prouided of victuall for such an Enterprise, made an Expedition against the Aethiopians; in which, Famine making her selfe Purueyor for the Armie, fedde them with the flesh of each o∣ther; euery tenth man being allotted to this bloudie seruice. Thus with a double discomfiture altogether discomforted, he retyreth to Mem∣phis, where he found them obseruing their festiuall solemnitie of the New-found Apis, and interpreting this ioy to haue proceeded from his losse, hee slew the Ma∣gistrates, whipped the Priests, commaunded to kill the Citizens that were found feasting, and wounded their Apis with his Sword, vnto death. Hee practised no lesse hostilitie vpon their Obeliskes, Scpulchres, and Temples: The Sepulchres they esteemed Sacred, as their eternall Habitations: (and no greater securitie could any Aegyptian giue vnto his Creditour, then the dead bodies of their Pa∣rents:) The Temples Strab.l.17. describeth the forme of their Temples. , euery where accounted holy, here were many, and those magnificent. At Memphis they had the Temples of Serapis, Apis, Venus, and the most anti∣ent of them all, of Vulcan, with the Pigmcy-Image of Vulcan in it, which Cam∣byses derided: of Serapis at Canopus, where Pilgrims by dreames receiued Oracles: at Heraclium, Sai, and Butis, to Latona; at Mendes to Pan; at Momemphis to Venus; at Necropolis, Nicopolis, and other places, to other supposed Deities. Cambyses also burned the Images of the Cabyrians, and the Temple of Anubis at Heliopolis, whose stately building and spacious circuit Strabo describeth, as likewise at Thebes.
They write, That after, as he was taking Horse, his sword, falling out of the Scab∣berd, wounded him in the thigh (where he before had wounded Apis) and slew him. Thucidol. 1. In the time while the Persians enioyed Aegypt, the Athenians, by instigation of Inarus, King of Libya, inuaded Aegypt, wonne Nilus and Memphis: but after six yeares lost all againe. Ochus, one of his successours (called of the Aegyptians, Asse) killed their Apis, and placed an Asse in his roome, which kindled such indignation in Bagoas an Ae∣gyptian (one of his Eunuches) that he murthered Ochus, whome hee hurled to bee rent and torne of Cats, that this Beast, sacred to Isis, might reuenge the indignitie offered to Apis. But this Eclipse of the Aegyptian Superstition, caused by this Per∣sian interposition, had an end, together with that Monarchie. For Alexander Curt.l.4. Arrian.l.3. did not onely leaue them to their wonted Rites, himselfe Adrichom. Theat. T.San. sacrificing to their Apis, and solemnizing Games in his honour, but added further glorie to their Countrey, by erection of that famous Citie, named of himselfe Alexandria (where, as some Lydyat. Em. Temp. thinke, the Citie No had before stood, destroyed by Nabuchodonosor) second in reputation to Rome, the Herodian.l.7. receptacle of Iewish, Graecian, and Aegyptian Religions, adorned with many Temples and Pallaces, his Successours, Ptolomaus Lagi (of whome the fol∣lowing Kings were all called Ptolomai and Lagidarum imperium & rgum series: Strab.lib.17. Niceph. patrl l.6 & 7. Lagidae) Philadelphus, Euergetes, Phi∣lopator, Epiphanes, Philomator, Euergetes the second, Physcon, Lathurus, Auletes the father of Cleopatra, whome Iulius Caesar made Queene of Aegypt (the price of her honestie) and Anthonie his wife, whome, together with her selfe, her ambition ouer∣threw, adding to the greatnesse of Alexandria. As for the deuotion there Ruff. l.2.c.23. Theod.l.5.c.22. practised, wee may reade in Russinus of the Temple and Image of Serapis, in his time destroy∣ed by Theophilus, successour to Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria. This Temple was borne vp with Vault-worke, with great lights and secret passa∣ges, the space of an hundred steppes: on the toppe whereof, round about, were lof∣tie Roomes, in which the keepers of the Temple, and they which made themselues chaste () remained. Within these were Galleries, or Cloysters, in squared rankes, and in the middest of all was the Temple, lifted vp on costly Pillars, and built of Marble. Post Capitolium nihil orbis terrarum cernit ambitiosius, sayth Am. Marcell. l.22. Inter Serapidis templa celeber∣rimum apud Alexand. Ve∣tustiss, Memphi. boc fanum sub∣ire nec hospitib. nec sacerdotib. licet priusqua Apin sepelierint. Pausan At. ano∣ther: Except the Capitoll, the world hath not a statelier Peece. Here was the Image of Serapis, reaching with his right hand to the wall on one side, with his left hand vnto the other, being framed of all kindes of Wood and Mettalls. It had on the East a little window so fitted, that when on a solemne day the Image of the Sunne was admitted to salute this Serapis, the iuggling Priests so obser∣ued the time, that euen then the Sunne-beames, through this window, should seeme to kisse Serapis. They had also another tricke, by a Load-stone placed in the Roofe, to draw vp the yron Image of the Sunne, as if it did then bidde Serapis Farewell. The superstitious Ethnickes had a Tradition among them, That if euer mans hand did offer violence to that Image, the Earth should presently returne, and re∣solue it selfe into the first Chaos, and the Heauens would suddainely fall. All this notwithstanding, a Christian souldior dismembred the same, and burned Serapis openly, the Mice running out of his diuided trunke. Some (sayth Russinus) esteemed this Serapis to be Iupiter, and that hee ware a Measure (Modius) on his head, as hee which gouerned all thinges in measure, or else, did liberally feede men with the Fruites of the Earth. Others coniectu∣red him to be Nilus; others, Ioseph Oros.l.1.c.8. affirmeth, that of Iosephs act Aegypt is still witnesse vnto his time, con∣tinuing the payment of the fist part of their profits to the King. , that fedde Aegypt in the seuen deare yeares. Others thought him to be one Apis, (a King in Memphis) who in the time of fa∣mine, with his owne store, supplyed the peoples want: for which benefit they built a Temple to him after his death, wherein they nourished an Oxe, in remembrance of him, whose Husbandrie and Tillage had nourished them. This Beast they called also Apis.
He Storie of Yrannus, Sa∣turnes Priest. mentioneth the Temple of Saturne, whose Priest called Tyrannus (vnder pre∣tence of Saturnes commaundement) would demaund the companie of what Ladie he liked, to beare the God companie at night: which the husband did not much sticke at, esteeming it an honour to haue a God his corrìuall. But Tyrannus shut∣ting the woman into the Temple, by secret passages conueyed himselfe thither, in∣to the hollow Image of Saturne, in which he held conference a while with the wo∣man, and after by a deuife putting out the lights, satisfied his lust in committing those workes of darknesse, which after being brought to light, caused the Temples destruction. They had Breast-plates of Serapis in euery house, in the Walls, Entries, Posts, Windowes; in stead whereof they after fastened Crosses. The Crosse in the Ae∣gyptian Mysteries signified life to come. They had a tradition, That their Religion should continue, till there came a Signe, in which was Life. Socrat. l. 5.c.16. And by this occasion many of their Priests were conuerted. Sozomen Sor. l.7.c.15. reporteth the same, That in pur∣ging of Serapis Temple at Alexandria, the Crosse, being found among other their Hicroglyphickes, was occasion of the conuersion of many vnto the Christian Faith. This Niceph. l.12.26. Theodor.l.5.22.Hist.trip.l.10.c.29. Temple, and the Temple of Bacchiu, were turned into Christian Churches. Olympius a Philosopher, with a companie of seditious Ethnickes, fortified them∣selues in Serapis Temple, and caused many by force to sacrifice: and when the Christians burned their Images, he answered, That the Images were but corruptible matter, but the Vertues, or Diuine Powers, which inhabited them, were fled to Hea∣uen. This I thought to mention for their sakes, who to their Image-worship haue borrowed the like Heathenish playster. Ruffinus addeth, That in destroying the Temples, they found Reliques of their bloudie Superstition, the heads of infants cut off, with the lippes gilded. The de∣uotion of Canopus was not inferior to that of Alexandria. Here, through the sub∣tletie of the Priest, the Chaldaeans were vanquished. For whereas they challenged their God Fire to be the strongest, as deuouring other Woodden and Mettall-Gods, he conueyed an Earthen pot full of holes, which he had stopped with Waxe, and filled with water, into the Image: and when the Chaldaeans made their fierie tryall hereof, the Waxe melting, the water issued, and quenched the fire. Hence it is, that they made the Image of Canopus with feet and necke short, and a Belly like a Barrell, or water-Vessell. Tacitus Cor.Tac.l.4. c.35. reporteth certaine miracles wrought at Alexandria by the instigation of Serapis: the curing of a lame and blinde man, whom that God had moued to seeke this helpe at Vespasians hand; which hee also perfourmed. Hee consulting with this Oracle, saw sodainely behinde him in the Temple one Basilides, whom by present en∣quirie he found to lie sicke foure score miles thence in his bed. The name yet was an ominous signe to him of the whole Empire, as deriued of  The originall of this God (saith he) is by some imputed to Ptolomoeus Lagi, who hauing in Alexandria erected Temples, and instituted religious rites, seemed in his sleepe to see a tall young man, warning him to send into Pontus, to fetch thence his Image, sodainely after va∣nishing in a flame of fire. When the Aegyptian Priests could not satisfie him in the interpretation of these things, Timotheus an Athenian, whome hee had sent for to be chiefe Maister of Ceremonies, willed him to send to Sinope, wherein was an ancient Temple of Pluto, hauing in it the Image of Proserpina. Ptolomey neglecting this; and with a second Vision terrified, sent to Scydrothemis King of Sinope for the same; be∣ing (in the way) further hereunto incouraged by the Delphian Oracle. Scydrothemis protracting the businesse was by diseases and manifest anger of the Gods, enforced to assemble and persuade his people to suffer the carrying away of their God. But whiles they resisted this enterprise, the ambitious Idole, without once taking leaue, conueied himselfe into the shippe, which also, together with himselfe, he made to arriue at Alexandria in three dayes, where was this Temple built to him, in the place
wherein sometime had stood I sis Chappell. Some Athen l.5.ca.5.6. esteemed him Aesculapius for his cures, some O sir is, some Iupiter, some Pluto, but Serapis was his Aegyptian appella∣tion.

Onias, os.Ant.13.6. one of the Iewish Priests (according to the Iewish manner) literally inter∣preting Esais Isa 19 19. prophecy of the altar in Egypt, built a Temple at Bubastis in fashion of that at Ierusalem, but lesse, by the permission of Philometor, and furnished it with Priests and Leuites after the Iewish Religion. At ans . 2. Alexandria also the Iewes were free and had their Synagogues, as at Leontopolis likewise and other places. Procop.de bel∣lo Persico li.1. Procopius saith, that Dioclesian the Emperour bestowed Elephantina and the parts adioining on the Blemi and Nobatae, whose Religion was a mungrell of the Greekish, Aegyptian, and their owne: but the caused them to cease humane sacrifices which they vsed to offer to the Sun. And thus was the state of religion in Egypt during the cōquests of the Persians, Greeks, and Romans, each rather seeking to settle heere their Empires then opinions. But when the Sunne of Right consnes the Sonne of GOD, the Sauiour of man, appeared to the World, he honoured Egypt with his infancie, as after with a Religious conquest, by weapons (not carnall) casting downe the holds which these hellish spirits had heere so long posses∣sed; thus fulfilling truely what Esay had prophecied and Mercurie foretold. Alexan∣dria became a Patriarchall Sea (the first Bishop whereof was Saint Marke) enioying in Lybia, Pentapolis, and Egypt, the same power that the Roman Bishop had in Italy, by decree of the Con.Nic. Can.6. first Nicene Councel. Heere also liued the first Heremites (the Hist. Tripar. 1.c.11. Paul. Diacol. 8. first & cheese of which was Antony, an Egyptian, inuenter of this order) in the sandy Deserts, by occasi∣on on of those bloudy persecutions wherein many thousands lost their liues. Of these Ere∣mites read Io. Cassianus and Severus Sulpitius de vita Martin. l.3. But when as the Ma∣humetan Religion and armes began first to peepe into the World, Egypt Vincent Spec.li.24. was made a slaue to those superstitions vnder which it groneth till this day. These Saracens diuided Egypt into three parts; Errif, from Cairo to Rosetto; Satrid, from Cairo to Bugia; Matemma, as Nilus runneth to Damiata. It was Leo Afric. l.8. subdued vnder the conduct of Hamrus the sonne of Hasi, Generall of the Arabian forces to Homar or Aumar the second Caliph. He onely exacted tribute, permitting freedom of their con∣science to all. He built vpon the bankes of Nilus a Towne called by the Arabians Fis∣stato i. Tabernacle, because that in the desert places, through which he passed, he was constrained to lie in tents. The common people call this Towne Mesre Haticht, the antient Citie: for so it is in respect of Cairo, The Arabi∣ans & Turkes doe call Cairo, Miszr: the re∣uenue whereof amounteth to aboue a milli∣on, and run∣neth into the Hasnad or pri∣uate Treasure of the great Turke, and not into the pub∣like Treasurie. Lazaro Soranzo. which was after built, two miles from hence, by one Gehoar, who of a Dalmatian slaue had been aduanced to be a Counsellour vnto Elcain the Mahumetan Calipha, and was Generall of his Armie about the foure hundred yeare of their Hegeira. He called it Elchahira, which signifieth an imperious mistresse. He hath vn∣der him there∣fore 16 banza∣ckes & 100000 Timariots, or horse mens fees, to main∣taine so many horse for tho He walled it round, and built in it that famous Temple called Gemih Has∣hare, as Hamrus had done before at Fustato. In this Towne of Fustato standeth the Sepulcher of a famous Saint of their Sect, called Nasissa, of the line of Mahomet, whose beautifull shrine the Schismaticall Patriarches of Egypt adorned with siluer lampes, carpets of silke and other precious ornaments. No Mahumetan commeth to Cairo Turkes warres at their owne charge. Knlles.
either by Water or Land but he adoreth this Sepulcher, and offereth thereat, inso∣much that the yearely oblations and almes heere offered for the releese of the poore kindred of Mahomet, and maintenance of the Priests that keepe it, (which want not their counterfeit miracles to delude the peoples zeale) amount to one hundred thou∣sand Sarassi. And when Zelim conquered Cairo, the lanisaries risling this Sepulcher, found in it fiue hundred thousand Sarassi in ready coyne besides other riches. Some report that this Nafissa being a dame of honour, yeelded her body, without reward, to any that required the same, Pilgrim to Mecca apud Hak. bestowing (as she said) this almes for the loue of the Prophet Mahomet. I ettuce sutable to such lippes: Like Prophet, like Saint. But Leo would haue you thinke her an honester woman. Fustato is reckoned as as suburb to Cairo, containing (in Leo's time one thousand fiue hundred twentie six) fiue thousand families: besides many Sepulchers adored of the fond people, which couer the paue∣ment with rich carpets. Hither resort euery Friday great multitudes for deuotion, and bestow liberall almes: P. Mart. Leg. Bab.l.3. They heere sprinkle cold water with sweete herbes and leauie boughs. Bulach is another Suburb of Cairo vpon the bankes of Nilus, of like distance, and hath in it foure thousand families with stately Temples and Colleges. Beb Eiloch stan∣deth a mile from Cairo, and hath about three thousand families. Gemeh Tailon was adorned by Tailon sometime gouernour of Egypt with a sumptuous Temple and Pal∣lace. Beb Zuaila, another Suburb, containeth twelue thousand families. Cairo, it selfe within the Walls hath not aboue eight thousand families, and is full of stately and magnificent Temples. Heere is an Hospitall built by Piperis, the first Soldan of the Ma∣malukes race: the yearely reuenues whereof amount to two hundred thousand Saraffi, or as some reckon, fiue hundred ducats a day. It is open to all sicke and diseased per∣sons, and heire to all that die there. The Plague is sometime so hotte at Cairo, that there die twelue thousand persons daily. This was the state of Cairo in Leo's time. Sa∣lomon Sal. Schu. Schuveigher affirmeth that at his being in Cairo An. a thousand fiue hundred eightie one, there died daily betweene seuen and ten thousand; nor is any place more plagued with the French disease. Besides that Hospitall, and Nasissas Sepulcher, are three other famous, Zavia della Iunachari, Imamsciafij, and Giamalazar. This is the generall Vniuersitie of all Egypt. Hak. pilgrim. to Mecca. In this place, An. one thousand fiue hundred three∣score and six, in the moneth of Ianuarie, by misfortune of fire were burned nine thou∣sand written bookes of great value, wrought with gold, worth three or foure hun∣dred ducats a peece one with an other. This was interpreted as an ominous token of their ruine. They thinke also that Mecca will in short time be conquered by the Chri∣stians, and her deuotions shall be remoued to Rosetto. Neander Neon. Or. Te. Par.3. his conceit is ridicu∣lous, that Cairo should hold as much people as all Italy, and that there are two & twen∣tie thousand Temples. Iohn Evesham out of their owne registers numbreth but two thousand foure hundred: and though Cairo considered together with these suburbes is great, yet is it not all the way continued with houses and buildings, P.Mart. but hath Gardens also and Orchards betweene. Alexandria is very vnholesome, as the graue of that Alexandria we before men∣tioned. Vnder the foundations are great habitations, as if they were two Alexandria's built one vpon another. Vnder the houses of the Citie are cisterns sustained with mighty Arches to receiue the inundation of Nilus. When the Saracens had spoyled it, it remained long desolate vntill a subtle Caliph proclaimed that Mahomet had left great indulgences to such as would heere inhabit. And thus hee replenished the Ci∣tie with inhabitants, building houses for them, as hee did colleges for the Students, and Monasteries for the Religious. Heere yet remaineth a little Chappell, where∣in they say that the high prophet, and King Alexander the great, lie buried: to which resort many Pilgrims that adore the same, and bestow there their Almes. Thebes, that sometime was so famous a Citie, containeth not now aboue three hundred families: and still retayneth some bones of the carkasse of old Thebes, many Pillars, Walls, inscriptions in Latin, Greeke, and Egyptian characters. Memphis, her next successour, is vtterly ruinate. The Mahumetans entred Egypt a∣bout
Anno six hundred thirtie seuen. After, their state sinking vnder the weight of it selfe (which is the ordinarie sicknes of greatnes) they grew to dissentions and sects, as is said in our Saracen Historie. For the seate of the Saracenicall Caliphas beeing by Ma∣camat remoued to Bagdat, which he had builded, there arose new Caliphs in Damas∣co; in Egypt (whose seate was after at Cairo:) in Cairoan, to whom the Africans yeelded subiection, and after at Marocco. The first suc∣cession of the Egyptian Celisas vncertaine But in Elcains time, while he sought to win the East from the Caliph of Bagdat, his Lieutenant rebelled against him, a. d hee was saine to liue in Egypt, where Gehoar had built Cairo. The Sect of Hali had before also pre∣uailed in Egypt, for which cause Nasissas father was forced to flee the Countrey, yet this Sect after was restored by Asmulinus, and Solinus his sonne, first Caliph of Egypt. But when the Westerne forces, vnder Godfrey of Bullen, grew terrible to the East, Car Chronl. 4.10.11.53. the Egyptians paied tribute to the Christians, which Dargan the Sultan detaining was by Almericus King of Ierusalem ouerthrowne in battell. Knolics T.H. Noradine of Damasco sent Saracon his sonne to helpe Sanar the Sultan against this Dargan, which Sara∣con was by the Caliph appointed Sultan, who before had slaine the Sultan, and Saladine his successor slew the Caliph, and rooted out his posteritie to settle his owne. This Historie is diuersly reported. Peuerus Teue Car. Chro. maketh the Egyptian Chaliphs to bee Schismaticall from their first entrance, which was (as he saith) in Anno, 703. which raigned in Egypt, foure hundred fortie and seuen yeares, of the profession of Hali. Curio writeth otherwise, as Read.l.3.c.2. in their Historie wee haue shewed. So also doth Leo diffenting from em both, a man learned in his owne Religion. Hee saith that the Caliph of Cairo had continued two hundred and thirtie yeares, when as Saladine slew him and subiected himselfe to the Caliph of Bagdet, the onely Caliph then remai∣ning. This Saladine was Nephew to Saracon, who chased the Christians out of Syria. His Children reigned after him, of which Melechsala was last, who first inuented the order of the Mama'ukes, which were Circassian slaues, bought in their youth, and trained vp to Armes, Artes, and Religion of the Saracens, whom hee made of his guard. But they slew their Maister, and vsurped the Kingdome to themselues, al∣waies electing one of their company, the first of which Mamaluke Kings was Tur∣quemenius, who was slaine of his fellow Cothus, and he of Bendocader, who was also poisoned &c. Leo saith, that Saladines Family reigned a hundred and fiftie yeares, and Piperis was (saith he) the first-Mamaluke King. Gampson Gaurus, and Tomumbeius, the last of these Kings were ouerthrowne by Zelim the Turke. Anno 1517. whose successors still hold Egypt, and haue a Bassa resident at Cairo, from whence vvas carried by water many ornaments to Constantinople. The Caliph as at Bagdet, so here retained some spirituall preheminence. So saith P. Mart. Leg. Bab.3. that the Caliph sells the Soldan this dignitie at a price, and ascending the Throne, doth giue vnto the Soldan, there standing on foote, the absolute power of life and death, and then descending disrobeth himselfe, attiring the Soldan with the same robes. So it ap∣peareth, that the name & power of the Caliph, all the time of the Mamalukes (as the Ghost of it selfe) had some almost breathlesse shadow left: the life & substance being in the Soldan. There is (saith Leo) in Cairo, & in all Egypt 4 Sects, differing frō each other in Canon & Ciuill aws, all Mahumetans. He which professeth one of these sects, cannot at his pleasure betake him to another, except being learned bee shew reasons therefore. Each of these Sects hath his peculiar Iudge, from whom yet lieth an appeale to a higher Iudge, being gouernour of the Sect called Essafichia. Whosoeuer attempteth ought against the precepts of his owne Sect, is secretly punished by the iudge thereof: And although the Priests of these seuerall Sectes vse differing Liturgies and rites, Example for Christians, in ending Con∣trouersies of Religion. yet doe they not take one the other for enemies, with hatred or mutinies: but if any question a∣rise, learned men by conference debate the same. No man vpon paine of grieuous punish∣ment may reproch any of the foure Doctors, first authors of those foure sects. There is one Sect of religious men in Cairo, called Chenesia, which liue vpon horse-flesh: therfore are lame Iades bought & set vp a fatting, & sold to these Chenesians, which sect is rise in all Asia. There goe certaine women vp & down the citie crying, whose office is to excise
or circumcise the women, which is obserued in Egypt and Syria, both by the Mabu∣metans and Iacobite Christians. Neither haue the Turkes (although in superstition by themselues acknowledged short of the Arabians and Aegyptians) beene altoge∣ther idle in their deution, which they testifie by their Pilgrimages, and Good works among Turkes. Almes∣workes. Bellonius telleth of one Turke that caused water to be brought daily on Ca∣mels backes for the case of Trauellers in that Desert space betweene Alexandria and Rosetto. Egypt hath in it many Iewish Synagogues, who speake the Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Arabian, and Greeke languages, and are great Marchants. Wee haue had a∣mongst vs Vagabonds, which call themselues Aegyptians, the dregges of mankinde. Of these Aegypt it selfe hath, no lesse forreine to them then to vs. They wander (saith Bellonius) through all the Turkish Empire, and are cunning in Iron-workes. They seeme to be Christians of Wallachia. Thus wee see the iudgements of God by the Persians, Graecians, and Romans for their pristine Idolatrie: and a greater iudge∣ment for their haeresie, hatched by Arrius, punished by a Saracenicall Apostasie. Among the differing Sects of the Mahumetans, (of which wee haue spoken in the third booke) Africa, and specially Egypt, and herein Cairo most of all is pesteredy with them, which may be called the naked, or the wicked Sect, roguing vp and downe na∣ked, and practising their fleshly villany, in the open sight of the people, who yet hold them for Saints. Leo l.3. The inst hand of diuine iustice, that when men forsake God, not Religion and Truth alone, but reason, but sense shall also forsake them. As for the Christians in Egypt, ye may reade in the Histories Hist.Sar.G.Tyr. Foxe Act. & Mon. of the Holy-land-warres, what attempts were often made by the Westerne Christians against these vnbeleeuers. Concerning the pre∣sent state of Christianitie there, Leo, Boterus, G.Bot.Ben. Pory in Leon. Chytr. Chron. and Maister Pory in his additions to his Englished Leo, may acquaint you. Besides, the forraine Christians, which resort to these parts for traffique there, are thought to bee fiftie thousand Natiue of the coun∣trey, which haue Churches, and Monasteries, whereof there are three Christian Chur∣ches at Alexandria. They are called Cofti, and Christians from the Girdle, because of their Circumcision, which together with Baptisme they admit. In their Liturgie they vse the Chaldean language. But they reade the Gospell againe, in the Arabian. They are accounted of Entiches haeresie. Their Patriarchall Sea is Alexandria: Abdias Fab. Dorotheus. Baron. t.6.white 55.2. which from Saint Marke to this day hath had a continued succession, as appeareth by the late Letters of Gabriel to the Pope, calling himselfe the fourescore and seuenteenth of the Patriarches from Saint Marke. How Christian Religion was first planted in Egypt by Saint Marke, and the Apostles, and their successors, and how persecuted by the Eth∣nikes: after by the Arrians; and how Ethnike Religion was againe by Valens permit∣ted to all that would embrace it, the fore-named Ecclesiasticall Histories make menti∣on: how it was persecuted by the Persian inuasions, and after by the Saracens in time brought to this present passe, and how it now continueth, wee may reade in many both aron. annal. Pappus, Enagr. Pantalcon. &c. olde and new Authors. Zaga Zabo an Aethiopian Bishop saith, that the Patri∣arke of Alexandria resideth at Cairo: Where their Aethiopian Metropolitane Dam.a Goes.Fran.Aluares c98. Hemingii atc∣chismus in fine. Catholi Tradit. recei∣ueth of him his confirmation. And in their Aethiopian Liturgie, they mention them both in this sort. Pray for our Prince, the Prince of our Archbishops, the Lord Ga∣briel, and the chiefe of the Church of Alexandria, and for the chiefe of our Countrey, our venerable Archbishop Marke, &c. And thus much of this Aegyptian Prelate, as a taste of that which is to be declared in our Christian Relations. Adrianu Romanus, Theat. Vr∣bium. in his Theatrum Vrbium saith, that besides the Patriarch of the Coptites, here is also a Patriarch of the Greekes and Arabians, which haue their Liturgie in Greeke, but scarse vnderstand the same.
CHAP. VI The Egyptian Chronologie, out of Manetho high Priest of the Egyptians, and others. AFter this so long a Historie of Aegyptian affaires, I haue here added the order of times, wherein those things happened, that this our Re∣lation might bee the more complete, although perhappes it may seeme to some more then taedious already. Varro diuided times into three sorts; the first he called Vncertaine: the second, Fabulous: the third, Historicall: Ioseph Sealiger, a man happily more studious in this Subiect of times, then all Times before haue yeelded vs, reckoneth the two former for one, as not easily to be distinguished. He hath also published to the world not one∣ly his owne learned Obseruations on Eusebius Chronicle, but such fragments Excerpta Barbaro-Lat. Manuse. Chron. Causab. Collectan bist. &c. as out of Cedrenus, Syncellus, and others, he could finde both of Eusebius Chronicle in Greek, (for before we had onely the Latine translation of Hierome, much whereof also is vtterly lost) as also of Africanus, from whose Store-house Eusebius tooke his Chro∣nicle, both for matter and words, almost by whole sale, And whereas Annius had be∣fore cousened the world with countersets of Berosus, Manetho, Metasthenes, with o∣ther Fabulous tales, falsely fathered on the auncients: Hee hath helped vs likewise to some Reliques of those Histories, which others haue inserted into their workes; the very bones of such carkasses being worthy of admiration, if not of veneration. The true Manetho therefore in three Tomes, wrote the Aegyptian Historie vnto Ptolomaeus Philadelphus: his Greeke Epistle Dedicatorie, being but short, I haue thus translated. To the Great King Ptolomaeus Philadelphus Venerable, appropriated after to Augu∣stus, and his successors. Augustus, Manetho High Priest and Scribe of the sacred sanctuaries, throughout Egypt, of the Sebennite Family, a Heliopoli∣tan, to my Lord Ptolomaeus, Greeting. It behoneth vs (mighty King) to giue account of all those things which you counsell vs to search out. The sacred Bookes, written by our forefather Trismegistus Hermes, which I haue learned (according as you, enquiring what things shall come to passe in the world, haue commanded me) shall bee declared: Farewell, my Lord King. Hence appeareth the time of Manetho, and his Pontisicall dignitle, with the Originall of his Antiquities borrowed of Hermes, and the occasion of his vvri∣ting in the Greeke, as to a Grecian King. Patricius out of a holy book setteth downe this Genealo∣gie; Horus, the sonne of Osiris, he of Chus, and he of Cham or Chamephes. He first setteth downe the yeares of the raignes of their Gods. Vulcan, Sol. Agathodoemon, Saturne, Osiris and Isis, Typhon. Then of the demigods: Orus, who raigned fiue and twenty yeares: Mars, three and twenty: Anubis, seuenteene: Her∣cules, fourteene: Apollo, foure and twenty: Ammon, thirtie: Tithoes, seuen and twenty: Sosus, two and thirtie: Iupiter, twenty. Things both false in themselues and in the copie imperfect. After these he reckoneth in order two and thirtie Aegyptian Dynasties. Dynastiae, Lordships, or gouernments in Egypt. 1. The first of the Thinites; of eight Kings, whose names and yeares of raigne are, Menes, threescore and two: he was slaine of an Hyppopotamus, or Riuer-horse. A∣thothis his sonne, seuen and fiftie. Hee built a Palace in Memphis, and wrote of Ana∣tomie. Cencenes, his sonne, one and thirtie. Enephes, his sonne, three and twenty. In his time was a great Famine. He built the Pyramides in Cochon. Saphoedus, his sonne, twenty: Semenpsis, his sonne, eighteene: Bieneches, his sonne, six and twenty. Sum. tot. two hundred threescore and three. 2. The second Dynastie of the Thinites; vnder nine Kings. Whose names and yeares of their raigne are in order as followeth, Boethus, eight and thirtie yeares.
Catechos, nine and thirtie: in his time was ordained the worship of Apis, at Mem∣phis, and Mueuis at Heliopolis. Binothris, seuen and fortie: Tlas, seuenteene: Sethenes, one and fortie: Chaeres, seuenteene: Nephercheres, fiue and twenty: in his time Nilus is said to haue had his waters mixed with honie. Sesochris, eight and fortie: Ceneres, thirtie. Summe three hundred and two. 3. The third of the Memphites. Echerophes, eight and twenty: Tosorthros, nine and twenty. He is supposed to be Aesculapius for his skill in Physicke; studious of painting and Architecture. Tyris, seuen: Mesochris, seuenteene: Zoyphis, sixteene: Tosertasis, nineteene: Aches, two and fortie: Siphuris, thirtie: Herpberes, six and twenty. 4. The fourth Dynastie of the Memphites. Soris, nine and twenty: Suphis, threescore and three: he made the greatest Pyramis. Suphes, threescore and six: Mencheres, three score and three: Ratoeses, fiue and twenty: Bicheres, two and twenty: Zebercheres, seuen. Tamphthis, nine: Sesochris, eight and for∣tie. 5. The fist of the Elephantines. Vsercheres, eight and twenty: Sephres, thirteene: Nephercheres, twenty: Sisiris, seuen: Echeres, twenty: Rathuris, one and fortie: Mer∣cheres, nine: Tacheres, fortie and foure: Vnos, three and thirtie. 6. The sixt of the Memphites. Othoes, thirtie: Phios, three: Methusuphis, seuen, Phiops, a hundred: Menthesuphis, one: Nitochris, twelue: she built the third Pyramis. 7. The seuenth of seuentie Kings that raigned so many daies a peece 8. The eight offeuen and twenty Kings which raigned a hundred forty & eight yeares. Their names are not expressed. 9. The ninth Dynastie was of the Heracleopolitans: of which were nineteene Kings, that raigned foure hundred and nine yeares. The first of them was Achthoes a cruell Tyrant, deuoured by a Crocodile. 10. The tenth was of nineteene Kings: whose raigne endured a hundred fourescore and fiue yeares. 11. The eleuenth of the Diospolitans: whose sixteene Kings raigned three and for∣tie yeares. Here endeth the first Tome of Manetho: whose second Tome containeth the twelfth Dynastie of the Diospolitans; The first of which was Cosongoses, six and fortie: Ammamenes, eight and thirty: Sesostris the great Conquerour, eight and fortie: Lachares, eight Ammares, eight; Ammenenes, eight: Semiophris, foure. 12. The thirteenth, of threescore Kings which raigned foure hundred fiftie & three yeares. 14. The fourteenth of threescore and seuenteene Kings, contained a hundred foure∣score and foure. 15. The fifteenth of Phaenicians, Shepheards, the first of which was Saites, nineteene: Anon, three and fortie: Pachnan, threescore and one: Staan, eight: Arcles, fortie nine: Aphobis, threescore and one: In all two hundred fortie and two. And the totall summe of the yeares of these fifteene Dynasties is three thousand three hundred and seuen∣teene. 16. The sixteenth Dynastie was of other shepheards whose thirtie two Kings raigned fiue hundred and eighteene yeares. 17.

The summe of the yeares of this Dynastie is one hundred fifty and nine. 27.

Dionysius, thirtie: Cleopatra, two and twenty: in all, three hundred and one. If the former Catalogue doe not agree with therelations of Iosephus, Cont. Ap. Theoph.lib.3. Theophilus or others, who haue cited some parts of Manetho in their workes, it is not much mar∣uell; the Graecians being alway audacious, ready to peruert Authors to their owne purposes; besides the ouersights of Writers, through negligence or ignorance in fo∣reine names. Neither is Manetho's word an Oracle, who reckoneth so long times be∣fore any time was: but either it is to be ascribed to the arrogancie of the Egyptian Priests desirous to be accounted no lesse ancient then the Chaldaeans: for Berosus and Manetho (as if they had been agreed) deriue their Histories from like Antiquitie (saith Scaliger out of Syncellus) which would better appeare, if we had the entire bodies, and not a few scattered bones of their Histories: or else we may ascribe it to their con∣founding of Histories, applying to an order of Succession, the diuers reignes of seue∣rall Dynasties, which happily gouerned at the same time in seuerall partes of Egypt, as in so small a Region as Canaan, Ioshua destroyed one and thirty Kings. This Scali∣ger Can. Isageg.l.3 coniectureth, Lydyat L.deemen. T. Some suppose the first of these Dyna∣sties were soon after the Cre∣ation, & soone after the floud: see the History of the World. affirmeth. Neither yet is Scaliger to be blamed for ac∣quainting the world with these fragments of Manetho, considering that the middle
part thereof holdeth, not onely likelihood in it selfe, but in great part correspondence with the Scriptures. If the Egyptians deuised otherwise to Herodotus and Diodorus, it was easie for them to deceiue strangers, or be deceiued themselues. The like historie of prodigious Antiquities Augustine De ciu. Dei lib.12.c.10. relateth of an Egyptian Priest that told Alex∣ander of the continuance of the Macedonian kingdome eight thousand yeares, where∣as the Graecians accounted but foure hundred and fourescore. Yea, the Scriptures themselues haue not escaped that mis-reckoning of Times; almost all Antiquitie being carried downe the streame of the Seuenty Interpreters, which adde many hundred yeares to the Hebrew Text, either of purpose, as some Brou.Concent. suppose, or as Augustine De ciuit.h.15.ca.13. thin∣keth, by errour of him that first copied the Scriptures out of Ptolomeis Library. That which we reade of the Dynasties of the Shepheards, Scaliger interpreteth of that baser seruile sort, which Moses Genesis 46.34 saith were abhominable to the Aegyptians, and seeme to haue beene strangers, that inhabited some Fenny places which Nature had fortified, if we beleeue Heliodorus Hist. Aeth.l.1 , and thence made forrages into the Countrey (the custome of Borderers) and were called therefore Robbers. These (it seemeth) dri∣uen to their shifts, by the hard and tyrannous vsage of the Egyptians, procured (as we reade of the Tartars) their owne freedome, and thraldome of their Lords. The Ro∣mans in their times were forced to maintaine a garrison against them, therefore cal∣led . And Hierome mentioneth In vita Hilar. the Bucolia where no Christians dwelled, but onely a fierce nation. Iosephus Ios. cont. Ap. Euseb, Chron. and Eusebius thinke them to be the Israelites, which is vnlikely, because, they liued in seruitude, and neuer reigned there. Lydyat suppo∣seth the Philistims vnder Abimelech and Phicol to be the men. Nothing is more obscure in this Egyptian Chronologie, then the time of the de∣parture of the Israelites thence vnder Moses, whom Iulin Paraenad gen. Martyr affirmeth out of Diodorus to haue beene the first that wrote the Egyptian Lawes. Tatianus Affyrius Orat. contra Groec. (who after became an heretike) saith (and alleadgeth Ptolomey Mendefius a Priest for his Author) that this departure was in the dayes of Amasis king of Egypt, who liued in the time of Inachus. Theophilus and Iosephus Theopb. lib.3. out of Manetho, in the reigne of Tethmoses: Eusebius Eul. Nicoph. pat. in the reigne of Cenchres: Others Ado Funct. Beroal.Perk. Bunt.odom.Mare. Pont. Pbrigio. Wolh. tpis. Chrongr. Dagli. Must. &c. otherwise, according to the diuers interpretation of Manetho. The Scripture sheweth, it was after foure hundred and thirtie yeares, from the promise first made to Abraham, as all that I know both elder and later, Greeke and Latin Chronographers, except Genebrard and A∣driehomius, reckon it. Lydyat thinketh that the drowning of the Egyptian Pharao was the cause of those tumults in Egypt, about succession, which are ascribed to Aegyp∣tus and Danans. Of this Aegyptus some deriue the name of the Country: which hee supposeth rather to be compounded of Ai and Capti or Copti, that is, the Region of Copti the chiefe city, as of Ai & Thebets or Thebais, Aethiops. Scalig.de Em. Temp.lib.5. Ignatius the Patriarch of Antioch, in his Arabian Epistle to Scaliger, calleth Egypt the land of Copti, where he saith, by a cruell edict of Dioctesian, were slaine one hundred forty foure thousand, and other seuen hundred thousand were by the same Tyrant exiled. Orosius Or. lib.1.c.10 re∣porteth that the prints of the Charriot-wheeles of the Egyptians, then pursuing the Israelites through the Sea, doe yet remaine in the sands on the shore, and vnder-wa∣ter, which no curiosity or casualty can so disorder; but that Diuine Prouidence doth re-imprint them in their wonted forme. Hard it is to apply the yeares of the Egyptian Chronologie, to the true accompt of the worlds generation, by reason of the disagreement of Authors, touching the Egyp∣tian Kings, vntill Sesacs time: which (after Lydyat) was in the yeere of the World 3029. although euen from hence we haue but slippery footing. Augustus (after the same Author) made Egypt a Prouince, in the yeare 3975. Vnder which Roman go∣uernement it continued vntill the Saracens conquered it, in the time of Omar the third Chalipha, who beganne his reigne, after Scaligers computation, in his Cata∣logue Scalig.  ag. lib.2. of the Chalipha's, in the yeere of CHRIST 643. The names of the Caesars belong to another place, and were tedious heere to relate the yeares of their seuerall reignes. Otmen the fourth Chalipha beganne in the yeare of CHRIST 645: whom the rest succeeded in order, vntill the yeere 869. And then the Chalipha's were di∣uided.
Mutemad reigning in Bagded Among all the 13. proces subiect to the Chalipha of Bagdet. E∣gypt had the second place, as Cnstan Porphyro sheweth out of Theophanes. Constant. de ad∣min. mp ca. 25. , and Tolon in Egypt, who died in the yeere of CHRIST 883. and of the Hegeira 270. whom succeeded Hamaria his sonne: and af∣ter him his sonne Aharum, whom Muchtaphi the Bagdet-Chalipha slew, about the yere 907. Afterwards, about the yeare 943. Achshid Muhammed sonne of Tangi reigned in Egypt, to whom a few yeares after succeeded his sonne Abigud, whom Meaz Le∣din Illahi of the posteritie of Phetima, Mahumets daughter, depriued in the yeare of our Lord 971. to whom succeeded his sonne Aziz, 975. Leo calleth him E Elhacham, in the yeare 996. Etaher Laazizdin Illahi 1030. Musteratzor Billahi 1035. Musteale 1095. Elamir Ba∣bacam Illahi 1101. he was but fiue yeares olde: the Protectour of the kingdome was Aphtzala Wizir. Elhaphit Ladin illahi 1135. Ettaphar succeeded, and hee being slaine, Elphaiz, who died in the yeare 1160. and Etzar ledin Illahi his sonne was the last of the Phecimaean race. To him succeeded Asareddin Shirachoch of the familie of Aub (which were Curdi) after his death Iusaph zlat eddin was constituted king by the Chalipha: & the Bagded Chalipha's were againe acknowledged in Egypt. This is that Saladine that tooke Ierusalem, in the yere of CHRIST 1190. Heg. 586. He conquered Mesopotamia, &c. he died in the yeare of our Lord 1193. Elaphtzal succeeded him in the kingdome of Damascus, Melich Elaziz in Egypt, Taher Giazi in Halep, or Aleppo; Melich Ela∣zis exchanged Egypt for Damascus, with his vnckle Eladel. The Egyptians made Apht∣zal their King, in the yeare of our Lord 1202. After Eladel succeeded Elchamel 1219, who died in the yeare of our Lord 1237. Hegeira 635. Essaloch followed: and after him Elmatam 1242. The Turkemen conspied against him: hee fled into a Tower of wood, which they fired: and halfe burned, he leaped into a streame that passed by, and there perished. Turcoman Azddin Ibik was made king in his place, in the yeare of our Lord 1245. Here beganne the reigne of the Mamalukes or slaues. He being slaine an other slaue succeeded whom they called Melich Elmntaphar. This seemeth to be hee that Leo calleth Piperitis. Thus farre out of Scaliger, collected by him out of Abra∣ham Zacuthi, which addeth much light to the Egyptian Historie of these times, where∣in I could neuer before satisfie my selfe concerning the erection and alteration of the schismaticall Egyptian Chalipha's, which with much labour (little auailing) I had sought. These Kings were not called Chalipha's (as the posteritie of Phetima or Fatima) but Sultans. A certaine catalogue of the names, times, and affaires of these Mamaluke-Sul∣tans, I can not perfectly exhibite. Pencerus Peuc. Chron. lbr.4. nameth in order these names  Turque∣menius, Cothus, Bendocader, Melechsait, Elpis, Melech seraph, Melechnasar, Me∣lechadel, and after many others, Caithbeius, a stout enemy of the Turkes P.Mart. Leg. Bab. li.3. This Caith∣beius was chosen Sultan, in the yeare of our Lord 1465. and reigned three and thirtie yeares. Two of his principall Mamalukes Acbardin and Campsous, full of emulation, were a principall cause of the ruine of that Dynastie. For whereas the Sultan was alway chosen out of the Mamalukes, by most voices amongst themselues, Campsous fearing left Acbardin should haue succeeded after Caithbeius, fained that his maister had ta∣ken order on his death-bed, that his sonne Mahomet should obtaine the roome: and vsed meanes to effect it, both by the voyces of those Mamalukes hee could suborne, and confirmation of their Chalipha, whose hornes these Soldans had shortned, abridging his power, (as before is said.) This Mahomet proued so cruell a tyrant, and those two Mamalukes so banded themselues in factions, that all became confused, and within six yeres after Caithbeius his death the Sultans throne was fiue times vacant. Tomumbeius kills Mahomet: Campsous Ciarchesius is chosen. Zanballat, President of Damascus, rebel∣leth, and by Tomumbeius meanes imprisoneth him, and vsurpeth the Scepter: but for his crueltie soone after is depriued and captiued by Tomumbeius, and after, strangled; He also succeeding in authoritie, tyrannie, and destinie. After Tomumbeius, was elected Campson Garus, whom Zelim the Turke ouerthrew, and slew in battell, in whose place an other Tomumbeius was chosen; but soone, to∣gether with his whole state, came into the Turkes power. Thus being diuided in many factions amongst themselues, and exercising all cruelties and pillages vpon the people,
Of the Ae∣gyptian misery in hese times, reade Verto∣man. and Mart. eye witnesses. they made themselues a prey to their neighbour, who, like a Vulture, watched this op∣portunitie to seize on these Lions, hauing now bled out their strength in mutuall and ciuill conflicts, in the yeare of our Lord 1517. Soliman succeeded, in the yeare of our Lord 1519; or 1520 ( others say.) Selim the second 1566. Amurat the third 1574 and in the yeare 1595. Mahomet the third, to whom Achmet, who now is the E∣gyptian and Turkish Souldan. Of these you may bee more fully informed in Maister Knolles his Turkish Historie, as also in our former relations. CHAP. VII. Of the Oracle of Iupiter Anmon; and of Cyrene: and the Re∣gions adioyning. ALl that lieth betweene Africa Minor and Egypt, Li. t.ca 3. Pomponius Mela doth call Cyrenaica, including vnder that title Marmarica, which Pliny Plin.li.5.c.5. reckoneth by it selfe: who also calleth the former Pentapolitana, and saith it is renowned by the Oracle of Hammon, which is fiftie miles di∣stant from Cyrene, by the fountaine of the Sunne, and those fiue cities, Berenice, Arsinoe, Polmais, Apollonia, Cyrene. This is now called Barca and Mesrata Lcoli. 6. lo. Bocin of which, this is inhabited, and rich: the other is most-what de∣sert, and poore: Their religion was like the Egyptians in times past. The Arabians, that liue there now, attend on their purchase, being the greatest theeues in Afrike. Berenice Dom.Nig. was sometime sacred, famous for the garden of the Hesperides, neare to which is that riuer of Lethe so much chaunted by the Poets. Nigh to this place also are the Psylli, a people terrible to Serpents, and medicinable against their poysons both by touching the wounded party, and by sucking out the poyson, and by enchaunting the Serpent. The Oracle of Iupiter Ammon is famous among the auncient. The place, where this Temple was, hath on euery side vast and sandy Desarts, in which they which trauelled, as we find in Arrianus Arrian.l.b.3. .lib.4. and Curtius seemed to warre with Nature. For the Earth was couered with sand, which yeelded an vnstable footing, and sometime was blowne a∣bout with the windy motions of the Aire: Water was hence banished, neither clouds nor springs ordinarily affording it. A fiery heate did possesse and tyrannize ouer the place, which the sands and Sunne much encreased. Neither was here tree, or hill, or other marke for Trauellers, to discerne their way, but the starres. In the middle of this Desart, was that sacred Groue (which Silius Italicus calleth The fortune∣telling Groue. Lucus fatidicus) not a∣boue fiftie furlongs in circuite, full of fruit bearing trees, watered with wholesome springs, seasoned with temperate aire, and a continuall spring. The Inhabitants, called Ammonians, are dispersed in cottages, and haue the middest of the Groue fortified with a triple wall. The first munition containeth the Kings Pallace; the second, the Serail or lodgings for his women, where is also the Oracle; the third the Courtiers inhabite. Before the Oracle is a fountaine, in which the Offerings were washed before they were offered. The forme of this God was deformed with rammes hornes crooked, as some paint him: But according to Curtius, without forme of any Creature, but like a Vmbilicus. round Bosse, best with Iewells. This, when they consult with the Oracles, is carried by the Priests in a gilded shippe, with many siluer Bells on both sides of the ship. The matrons follow: and the Virgins singing their distuned Procession, by which they prouoke their GOD to manifest what they seeke. These Priests were about foure score in number. Rammes hornes are said to bee ascribed to him, because Bacchus wandering in these Desarts with his army, was guided to this place by a seelie Ramme. Likewise Pausanias Pausan. lib. 4. in his Messenica saith, that one Ammon (which built the Temple) a shepheard, was
Author of this name to their God. Plutarchs De O reason of Amus we haue before shewed. Gthers deriue this name from  the sand; which may well agree with all Idol-deuo∣tion, as being a sandy foundation, although it is here intended to the situation. Drusius ad∣deth another reason of the name Ha, the Aegyptian name of the Sunne: Iupter idem qu l, saith Arnobius, & Minutius Fae∣lix quest he. l.3. But that which I haue before noted of Ham, the sonne of Noab, soundeth more probable, as be∣ing Progenitor of all these Nations, and of this mind also is Peucer.de Di∣uinat. Pencerus. This Strabo Strabo 17. in his time saith was not in request. as no other Oracles besides. For the Romans conten∣ted themselues with their Sibills and other diuinations. This Oracle was not giuen by word, but by signes. This defect of Oracles in generall, and especially of this, occasioned that treatise of Plutarch Plut.de dese. Orac. of this subiect, enquiring the cause of the Oracles failing. Neuer had he read that . 10.11 the Gods which had not made heauen & earth should perish out of the earth: nor had he eyes to see that Sun of Righteousnes, the light of the world, whose pure beames chased and dispersed the mists of darkenesse. And therefore are his conie∣ctures so farre from the marke, as notable with a naturall eye to see the things of God. The Dtod Stc.li.3 ca.5. antiquitie of this Oracle appeareth, in that Semiramis came to it, and inquired of her death; after which, the Oracle promised to her diuine honours. Besides this Groue, Cvt ibidem. Pomon mela. plin. solu. &c. there is another of Ammon, which hath in the midst a well, they call it the fountaine of the Sunne, whose water at Sunne-rising is luke warme, and cooleth more and more till noone, at which time it is very cold: and from thence till midnight, by degrees exchan∣geth that coldnesse with heate, holding a kinde of naturall Antipathv with the Sunne, hotest in his furthest absence, coldest in his nearest presence. Plinie and Solinus place this fountaine in Debris, a Towne not very farre from those parts amongst the Garamants. The Ammoman women haue such great breasts, that they suckle their children ouer their shoulder; the breast not lesse, if Inuenal be beleeued, then the childe; In Meroe crasso maiorem infante mamillam. In Meroe, the monstrous Pappe Is bigger then the childe in lappe. Pausanias pausan.lib.3. reckoneth an Ammonian Iuno among the Libyan deities, as well as this Iupiter. He addeth, the Lacedemonians had this Ammon in much request, and built to him diuers Temples, as at Gytheum one, which had no roofe: and the Aphytaeans did him no lesse worship then the Libyans. Ortelius who hath bestowed a Description of this Temple, supposeth that his Image was painted with hornes, but that Umbilicus was accounted the Deirie it selfe, or the signe of his presence, which shapelesse shpe he sampleth by many like in other Nati∣ons. The shippe he coniectureth to signifie, that the Religion was brought from some other place. But if Ammon be that sonne of Noah, it might rather be a memoriall of the Arke, wherein Noah and his sonnes were preserued: as that also of Ianus, (who is ima∣gined to be Noah) may more fitly be interpreted, then according to the Poets Glosle. Pub.Ouidiu. Sic bona posterit as puppin formanit in aere, Hospits aduentum testificata Dei. So well-dispos'd Posteritie did frame Aship, to shew which way their strange God came. The Hammientes are not much distant in place, or differing in name, from the Am∣monians: which build their houses of falt, digging the salt-stones out of the mountains, which they with morter apply to their buildings. Mela ioyneth to these aforesaid the Atlantes, which curse the Sunne at the setting and rising, as bringing damage to them and their fields. A practise not vnlike to the women of Angola at this day, who (as An∣drew Battle my friend told me) salute the new Moone when they first see her, by hol∣ding
vp their naked bumme against her, as the cause of their troublesome menstruous purgation. These Atlantes haue no proper names, nor feed of such things as haue life. He afur∣meth of the Garamantes, that they had no wiues, but liued in a beastly communitie. The Augilae acknowledge no other Gods but Ghosts, or soules departed, by which they sweare; with which they consult as Oracles; to which they pray at their tombs, receiuing answers by dreames. The women the first night of marriage are prostituted to all that will see them, the more the greater honour, but after, must obserue their owne hus∣bands. The Trogloditae dwell in Caues, and feed on Serpents, and rather make a found or noyse, then humane voyce: they vsed circumcision: they named not their children by the parents names, but by the names of sheep or other beasts which yeeld thē norish∣ment. And vnto these doth Pliny adde the Blemmyae with faces in their breasts, the Sa∣tyres. Aegypanes Himantopodes and other monsters, scarse worthie relation or credite. These parts I haue thus ioyned in-one Discourse, as liuing (for the most part) a wilde life, as the Arabians and Tartars doe at this day: and for Religion hauing nothing no∣table that I finde, but as you haue heard. The Arabians which vnder Elcm about the foure hundreth yeere of their Hegeira gaue a ducat a man to passe into Affricke, are Lords and Inhabitants of the deserts to this day, liuing (as wee say) a Dogges life, in hunger and ease, prosessing Mahumets Sect. The Adrimachidae Io. Boem. G.Draudius in Solinum Caelius Rhod. lib 18. ca.38. hued neare to the Egyptians both in situation and custome. The Nasamones had many wiues, with which they had company publikely. The first night of the marriage, all the guests had dealing with the Bride, and rewarded her with some gift. The Gnidanes had a more beastly custome, whose women glorying in their shame, ware so many fringes of leather as she had found Louers. The Machlyes ware the haire on the hinder part of their head, as the Iaponians now doe. The Auses vsed the con∣trary: whose Virgins in the yearely feast of Minerua, diuided themselues into two com∣panies, and skirmished with staues and stones. If any Virgins died of the wounds, they accounted them false maides. The most martiall Virago of the company, they arme and crowne, and place in a Charriot, with great solemnitie. They vsed not marriage, but had women in common: the childe being reckoned his with whom he choosed to liue, To adde a word of the Cyrenians, they held it vnlawfull to smite a Cow, in honour of I∣sis, whose fasts and feas they solemnely obserued: and in Barca they abstained both from beefe and hogges flesh. They scared The like doth Villamt re∣port of the Turkes. the crownes or temples of their children, to preuent the distilling of the rheume. In their sacrificing, they first cut off the eare of the beast, as first fruits, and hurled it ouer the house. Their Gods were the Sunne and Moone. The Maxes shaue the left side of their heads, leauing the haire on the right side. The Zigantes feed on Apes, whereof they haue plenty. The Meogauares make no account of Sepulchres, in stead wherof they couer the corps with stones, and set vp a Goats horne on the stone-heape. They haue many skirmishes for their pastures, which are ended by the mediation of olde women, who may safely interpose themselues, and end the fray (or battell if you will so call it.) When men are so old that they can no longer follow the heirds, they strangle him with a Cowes taile, if he will not preuent them by doing it himselfe. The like medicine they administer to such as are dangerously sicke. Of the Macae, Caelius thinks the Roman Priests borrowed their shauen Crownes. Other things which our Authors adde of these people and others adioyning, as seeming too fabulous, I list not to expresse.
CHAP. VIII. Of that part of Barbarie, now called the Kingdomes of Tunis and Tripolis. ALl the Tract of Land, betweene Atlas and the Sea (stretching in length from Egypt to the Straits) is Leo, l.1. called Barbaria, either of Barbar (which signifieth to murmure) because such seemed the speech of the inhabi∣tants to the Arabians, or of the word Bar, which signifieth a Desart, doubled. It comprehendeth Magin. both Mauritania's, Africa Minor, Libya Exterior, besides Cyrenaica and Marmarica, whereof we haue spoken. The inhabitants some fetch from Palestina, some from Arabia. It was conquered by the Romanes, and taken from the Greeke Emperours by the Vandals, and from them a∣gaine by the Saracens and Arabians, and is now partly subiect to the Turke, partly to the Xeriffe. It is vsually diuided into foure Kingdomes, Marocco, Fesse, Tremisen, and Tunis; for of Barca is said alreadie. The Kingdome of Tunis containeth all that which the Ancients called Africa pro∣pria, or Minor, and Numidia Antiqua. The Soyle is fertile, especially the West part. The inhabitants are sound and healthfull, seldome vexed with any sicknesse. Hereof are reckoned fiue parts; Bugia, Constantina, Tunis, Tripolis, and Ezzab. This Ezzab is the most Easterly part, hauing many Townes and Regions, amongst which, some account Mesrata. From these parts vnto Capes, is the Tripolitan Region. The chiefe Towne is Tripolis, wherein the Great Turke hath his Bassa, or Vice-roy, a Receptacle of the Pyrates, which roue and robbe in those Seas; Nic.Nic. was there present. in the yeare 1551 wonne from the Knights of Malta by Sinan Bassa. From Capes to Guadilbarbar is the Tunetane Territorie. From thence vnto the Mountaine of Constantina is that Region, hereof bearing name: and from thence Leo, l. 5. to the Riuer Maior, about a hundred and fiftie myles space, doth Bugia extend it selfe, so called of Bugia Bugia an Vniuersitie. the principall Citie, some∣time adorned with Temples, Hospitals, Monasteries, and Colledges of Students in the Mahumetan Law. Here is also Necaus, a very pleasant Citie; and Chollo, very rich. Constantina is an auncient Citie, containing eight thousand families, and many sump∣tuous buildings, a great Temple, two Colleges, and three or foure Monasteries, much resorted to by Merchants: Euery Trade hath their peculiar streets. A little from the Citie is a hot Bath, hauing in it abundance of Crab-fishes, or little Tortoises, which the women take for euill spirits, and ascribe vnto them the cause of their sicknesse, or ague, if any befall: and therefore kill white Hennes, and set them on an earthen Vessell, with their feathers, enuironing the same with little Waxe-candles, and so leaue them neere to this Bath, or Fountaine. How euer it fare with their Feuer, their meat shall not stay long, but some or other that see the womens deuotion, will enuie the euill spirits so good cheare, and for that time will be the spirits themselues, to dresse and cat their prouision. Not farre hence is a Marble building, with Images grauen therein: the people haue a conceit, that it was sometime a Schoole, and those Statues the Schollers, by diuine iudgement so transformed for their wicked∣nesse. In this Region is situated Bona sometime called Hippo, famous through our Christi∣an World for the most famous of the Fathers, that since the Apostles daies haue left vs their writings, AVRELIVS AVGVSTINVS; a name fitting to him, which indeed was Aureus and Augustissimus, Bishop of this Sea, while he liued; and yet liuing (in his Workes) a Bishop, not of Hippo, but of the Westerne Church. Wittie, Learned, Wife, and Holy Father, that hast with thee carried these Titles from Hippo: where, after thee, the Arian Vandals, and since, the Saracens, haue liued and Lorded, and at this day is possessed of such as haue no possession of Wit, Learning, Wisedome, or Holinesse: but haue testified their banishment of all these, by ascribing them to fooles and madde
men, whome they honour and admire as Saints. Nic. Nicolay, l. 1. This Bona (then brooking this name better) containeth now three hundred Herthes, and a sumptuous Mosque, to which is adioyned the house of the Cadi. Tunis is now a great Citie, since the ruines of Carthage, neere vnto which it stan∣deth.

Phoenicians: an emulous competitor with Rome of the Empire of the World. It contained (sayth P. Oros.l. 4.22. Orosius) in the circuit of the walls twentie miles; Livies Epitome saith, foure and twentie; all engirt with the Sea, except three myles space, which had a wall of squared stone, thirtie foot broad, and fortie cubits high. The Tower Byrsa en∣uironed aboue two myles, and had in it the Temples of Iuno, Aesculapius, and There were in Carthage the Temples of Iuno, Memo∣ria, Apollo, Silius addeth of Elisa, and of Venus Coelestis, or Vra∣nia, the Phoeni∣cian Astroarche & Syria Dea. Belus. Of the greatnesse of their name and power, those three Punike warres are witnesses; in the second of which, Annebal (whome his father Hamilear, then Generall in Spaine, had caused to sweare at the Altar of Iupiter, neuer to hold friendship with the Romans, he then being but nine yeares old, as Aemilius Probus, or as other will haue it, Cornelius Nepos reporteth:) he, I say, passed ouer the Pyrenaean Mountaines, through Fraunce, and ouer the Alpes, into Italie, with an Armie of a hundred thousand footmen, and thirtie thousand horse. The Riuers Ticinus and Trebia, the Lake Trasimenus (running with Roman bloud, by three ouerthrowes of Scipio, Sempronius, and Flaminius the Ro∣man Consuls) witnessed the Punike might Of the Pu∣nike warres and greatnesse the Roman Histories are full: so also Polybius and o∣thers among the Greekes.

Hist. l. 3. 39. . But the victorie at Cannae against Varro did pierce the breast, and had rent the heart of Rome, had Annibal knowne to haue vsed the victorie as well, as to haue gotten it. There did Rome seeme to breath her last: the Sunne, the Winde, the Dust helping the Carthagiman with Natures forces; yea, the Riuer Gellus, against Nature, stayed it selfe, whether with wonder, feare, or ne∣cessitie, accepting a Bridge or Damme rather or Roman bodies for a passage to the A∣frican Armie. These were golden dayes to Carthage, when three. Modij. bushels of Gold-Rings, taken from the fingers of the slaine, enemies, were sent hither as a present Polyb. l.3. c.11. & seq. ex translatione Causaboni, & Romani historiei sere omnes, haec plene. . A swoune meane-while did Rome sustaine; and easily in fiue dayes might Hannibal haue dined in the Capitoll: and poore helpe could she finde when she reuiued, had not Ca∣pua, with feasting the Conquerour, detained Rome from Conquest, when they de∣spoyled the Temples for Armour, armed their slaues, and bestowed their priuate state on the publike Treasurie: all which could not make Fabius Cunctator. fight with Annibal, but by not fighting learned to ouercome, knowing, that a shield was better weapon then a sword in that case.

Italie, where he was, but in Africke and Carthage, whence his force was; thereby procuring Annibals re∣turne, as the outward members are forced to yeeld their bloud, to succour any sudden oppression of the heart. But how is my heart oppressed with sudden passion, thus to transport the Reader, with my selfe, from Africke into Spaine, France, Italie, there to behold this Tragedie? Let the matter it selfe answere: and now we are returned to Carthage, and finde the Tragedie here. For in the third Punike warre the Romans (saith Lib.2.c. 15. Florus) rather fought with the Citie it selfe then with men. And alas, what could that Hermaphrodite-army doe, wherein were fiue and twentie thousand armed women Oros.l. 4.23. ? Yet had women then the greater courage: Hasdrubal the King yeelded. His wife, with her two children, and much people, burned themselues in the Temple of Aesculapius, that could not cure this disease of his Citie and suppliants; the like fate befalling the first and last Queenes of Carthage. Seuenteene dayes Prosperitate ac securitate rerum corruptis moribus plus nocuisse monstretur. tàm cito. eversa, quam prius ocucrat tam diu adversa Carthage. August. de Civ. Dei, l.3.c.21. together did Carthage burne, seuen hundred yeares after the first building. In this last warre, after they had deliuered vp their Nauie and weapons, being com∣maunded
to remoue tenne myles from thence, Anger kindled new forces, and taught them to supply the want of yron, with Siluer and Gold, in making weapons, with pul∣ling downe their houses to build a Nauie, the Matrons giuing their haire (the femi∣nine Ornament) to make bands for their manly and warlike Engins; their priuat glo∣rie, for publike necessitie; all which serued but to augment the pompe of this funerall of Carthage. Caesar did after restore it with a Roman Colonie, neuer attaining the Ty∣rian glorie, Leo, l. 5. afflicted with Vandales and Gothes, and by the Saracens made desolate; vntill the time of Elmahdt, in hereticall Caelipha; who procured the reinhabiting here∣of. But not aboue the twentieth part was inhabited: The rest remaineth as scattered ruines, dispersed bones of the carkasse of old Carthage. Master Pountesse, a friend of mine, told me, That he hath beene rowed in his Boat ouer the walls of Carthage, or their ruines, the Sea hauing made the last conquest by eating into the Land. The con∣daits are whole (saith Leo) which bring water from a Hill thirtie miles from Carthage, twelue miles vnder the earth, the rest aboue. And now (saith he) are not aboue fiue and twentie shoppes and fiue hundred houses therein, one faire Temple, one College, but without schollers, the inhabitants poore, proud, and superstitious. Master Ap.Hak. Evesham saith, That this Citie is now ruinated and destroyed. He mentioneth these Arches, wherein water was hither conueyed, and one street three miles long. As for the Sea-discoueries attempted by the Carthaginians, Hanno compassed all Africa, from the Spanish to the Arabian Straits, and committed his discoueries to wri∣ting; Himilco at the same time was employed in the search of Europe. Diodorus Sicu∣bis Diod. Sic.l.5.c.7. writeth a whole Chapter of their discouerie of a pleasant and fertile Island West∣ward, in the Ocean, which cannot fitly agree with any other Region then some part of the West Indies. And some Gen.Chron. thinke, that the Indians of America were a Colonie of the Carthaginians. Aristotle hath also the like relation in his booke De admirandis Auditionib. In the beginning of the Warre Dom.Nig. they had three hundred Cities in Libya, and seuen hundred thousand persons in their Citie. Tunis was a small Towne, till after the destruction of Carthage it grew in some reckoning (as before is said.) It hath in it about tenne thousand households. Abdul Mumen ioyned it to his Kingdome of Marocco. And when that Kingdome decli∣ned Leo, l. 5. , the Vice-roy (which before was subiect to Marocco) now vsurped the State to himselfe, calling himselfe King of Africa. In our fathers Sleid.Com.l.5. Fr. Sur. Com. Doglioni. dayes, Muleasses, sonne of Mabomet, King of Tunis (by murther of his elder brother Maimon, and either killing or putting out the eyes of twentie other his brethren) obtained the Crowne. But Ros∣sette the only brother remaining, when with his Arabians he could not gaine the King∣dome, he went with Barbarssa to Solyman the Turke, who so vsed the matter, that Muleasses was chased out of his Kingdome, and Tunis subiected it selfe to Selyman. But Mulcasses craued and obtained aide of Charles the fist, who in the yeare 1535 passed De bac expe∣ditione Diatrium sersit Ioan. Etrobius. with an Armie into Africke, and repossessed Muleasses of his Kingdome, who became the Emperours Vassall. Our Histories tell of Edward the first his arriuall at Tunis, and Henry the fourth with English Arches; at both which times the Tunetanes were forced to compositi∣on. It was, before either of them were Kings; Frossart, for Henry, hath his sonne Iohn de Beaufort. Muleasses, about the yeare 1544, crossed ouer the Sea into Sicilie, leauing his sonne Amida in the gouernment. Surius Comm. The costlinesse of his diet was admirable, and of his Perfumes. One Peacocke and two Phesants, dressed after his order, were obserued to amount to a hundred duckats, and more. He was a superstitious obseruer of his Re∣ligion, and of the Starres, which portended to him the losse of his Kingdome, and a miserable end. To auoid this, he departed out of Africa (for feare of Barbarussa) but so fell into the danger. A rumour was spread at Tunis, that he was dead; whereupon Amida possessed himselfe of the Kingdome. Muleasses hasted home to recouer it, and lost himselfe: for he was taken captiue, and after both his eyes put out with a burning knife, and of his two sonnes Nahasar and Abdalas he was committed to pri∣son. But Abdamelech his brother got the Kingdome from Amida, & soono after died,
to whome succeeded Mahomet his sonne, a child: whose Tutors were so tyrannicall, that Amida was againe sent for by the Tunetans, and Muleasses is brought to sanctu∣arie, whence by the Spaniards meanes he was conueyed to Guletta, and thence to Si∣cilia, where he was maintained at the Emperours charge Knolles, pag. 902. . He deriued his pedegree from the Chorean Familie, in right line from Homar, Mahomet disciple. Amida ob∣tained the Kingdome, thus tossed betwixt Moores, Turkes, and Christians, but was af∣ter taken and sent prisoner to Sicilia. Mahomet (brother of Amida, now a slaue in Si∣cilia) was made King of Tunes, vnder the Spaniard, 1573, by Don Iohn of Austria: but the next yeare after, Selym the Turke tooke Guletta, holden by the Spaniards almost fortie yeares; and at last tooke Tunes also: Mahomet the new King was sent to Con∣stantinople prisoner. It hath (saith Leo, l.5. Leo) many Temples, especially one of singular beautie and greatnes, furnished with store of Priests and Reuenue: also, many Colleges of Schollers, and Monasteries of Religious persons, to which the people yeeld liberall almes. They are so befooled, that they esteeme fooles Saints: and while I was at Tunis, the King built a faire Monasterie for one Sidi el Dahi, that went vp and downe with his head and feet bare, hurling stones, and crying like a madde man, endowing the same with great re∣uenue for him and all his kindred. Biserta is an auncient Citie, supposed Maginus. by some to be Vtica, where Cato slew himselfe. Cairaoan hath beene a Citie famous, built by Hucba, Generall of the warres of Oz∣men, or Otman, the third Chalifa, 36. miles from the Sea, and from Tunis 100, to secure themselues from any suddaine inuasion, which the commoditie of the Sea might cause them. He built therein an admirable Temple, on Pillars of Marble. To Hucba in this gouernment succeeded Mucas. Muse, who from hence made an Expedition into Spaine, and ouerthrew the Spanish King and his Gottish forces, and tooke Toledo: Iezul his sonne, his brother, and nephew, succeeded each other in his gouernment, which Elag∣leb (that followed them) turned into an independent and free Seignorie, by occasion of the Chalifa's leauing Damasco, and remouing the Seat Royall, or Popedome, to Bagdat. This house here ruled 170 yeares, at which time Mahdi an hereticall Chalifa depriued them. These Saracens wanne Sicilia in those times to the Cairaoan domini∣on. About the 400. yeare of the Hegira, Elcain was Chalifa in Cairaoan, whose Cap∣taine Gehoar conquered vnto him Barbarie, Numidia, and as farre as Sus Westward: and after being employed in the East, subdued Aegypt and Syria. He, for securing himselfe and his armie, built Cairo. After this, he sent to his Lord Elcain to come thi∣ther in person, assuring him, That the Chalifa of Bagdat was not able to abide his pre∣sence and puissance. Elcain liftening to Gehoar, appointed a Lieutenant in Cairaoan, and went to Cairo. But his Lieutenant of Cairaoan rebelled & offered his obedience to the Chalifa of Bagdat, who therefore gaue him large priuiledges, and made him King of all Africa. Elcain in these Straits knew not which way to turne him, till by counsell of his Secretaire he tooke this course. The Arabians at that time were ex∣ceedingly multiplied, insomuch, that the Countrey, otherwise barren, could not su∣staine them and their Cattell. To these he gaue leaue to passe into Africa, paying for euery Poll a Duckat, and taking an oath of them to be enemies to his rebell. These in short time sacked Tripolis and Cabis, and, after eight moneths siege, Cairaoan also, and remained Lords of Africa, till Ioseph the first, King of Marocco, who gaue aide to the kinsmen of that rebell, wanne the Cities from the Arabians, which still kept possession of the Fields. The Lord of Cairaoan fled Westward, and reigned in Bugia and the parts adioyning, and others of his kindred ruled in Tunis, till the King of Marocco swallowed all; that Citie being built presently after the Arabians had de∣stroyed this, in the yeare 424 of their Hegra, as Leo Leo, l. 2. reckoneth. Cairaoan Surius Cōment. hath in it an auncient Temple, and College of Priests: Hither the great men among the Moores and Numidians, are brought to be buried, hoping by the prayers of those Priests to clime to Heauen. For this cause (Boterus saith) they enter into this Citie vn∣shod, with great reuerence.
Concerning the Religion of these Africans: in auncient times, Leo saith, That they worshipped the Fire and the Sunne, as did the Persians, erecting in honour of each of these, faire and sumptuous Temples, in which the Fire was continually kept burning, as in the Temple of Vesta at Rome. The Numidians and Libyans sacrificed to the Planets. And some of the Negros worshipped Guighimo, which signifieth the LORD of Heauen. These afterward (he sayth) were of the Iewish Religion, and after that of the Christian, till the 268 yeare of the Hegira, that some Negro Kingdomes became Mahumetan, although there remaine some Christians to this day: but those which were Iewish, both by the Christians and Mahumetans, were vtterly destroyed. But those of Barbarie (whereof we especially entreat) remained (sayth he) Idolaters, till 250 yeares before Mahomets birth, when they became Christians. This must be inter∣preted of the vniuersall and publike profession about the time of Constantine: For o∣therwise Africke had in it Christians before. Dorothaeus in Synopsi saith, That Epaenetus, one of the 70 Disciples, was Bishop of Carthage; and that Simon the Apostle preached in Mauritania, and among the Africans, as Matthias also in Aethiopia. But the Gothes soone corrupted Christian Religion with Arrianisme, the fore-runner of Mahume∣tanisme, both here and elsewhere. The Moores (saith Alex.ab. Alex.Gen.dier.l. 6.4. another) worshipped Iuba as a God; and the Poeni, Vranus; the Libyans, Psaphon. This Psaphon (otherwise a base fellow) had taught birds to sing, Psaphon is a great God, and then let them flie into the Woods, where chanting their Lesson, they inchanted the rude people with this super∣stition. Aelianus Aelian.l. 14. 25. telleth the like Historie of Annon a Carthaginian, whose birds, at libertie in the Woods, forgat this their Masters Lesson. The Poeni Dom.Niger.Perfidi Poeni prouerb. being (as is said) Phaeni, or Phaenicians, brought (in all likelyhood) the Phoenician Religion with them from thence. Silius reckoneth one of their damnable Rites like to come thence, of humane Sacrifices. Mos fuit in populis quos condidit advena Dido, Poscere caede Deos veniam, ac flagrantibus aric (Infandum dictu) parvos imponere natos. Carthage, t'appease th'offended Deities, Was wont to offer humane Sacrifice: And tender Babes (abhominable shame) Were made the fewell of the Altars flame. To Saturne (saith Sar.l. 3. Sardiss) were humane Sacrifices offered by the Rhodians, Phae∣nicians, Curetes, and Carthaginians: the Sardi, their Colonie Suidos. , offered the fairest of their captiues, and such as were aboue threescore and tenne yeares old, who to shew their courage, laughed; whence grew the Prouerbe, Sardoniusrisus: this was done also to Saturne. The Carthaginians, in time of plague, offered their children to Saturne, which Gelo caused them to leaue. Being ouercome by Agathocles, they sacrificed 200 of the chiefe mens children to Saturne. Chtarchus and others write, cited by Suidas, That in their solemne supplications at Carthage they put a child into the armes of Sa∣turnes Brazen Image, vnder which was set a Furnace, or Ouen: which being kindled, the child being burned, seemed to laugh. This custome might happily be the occasion of that desperat act before spoken of in the destruction of Carthage by the Romans, so many perishing in Aesculapius Temple. Other their Rites are likely to be the same with those which we haue reported of the Phaenicians, somewhat perhaps in time in∣clining also to the Greekish superstition. Their deuotion to Venus, the Phaenician god∣desse, Augustine August. in Psal. 98. mentioneth in these words, Regnum Veneris quale er at Carthagini, vbi nunc est regnum Christi? The Punicke Tongue was, according to the same Author, very neere to the Hebrew in many words Contra lit. Petil.l. 3. , yea almost in all: a surther testamonie either of their Canaanite or Phaenician off-spring, as wee may gather out of Precopius, the Pu∣nikes in Augustines daies calling themselues Chanam. Expos. inchoat. ad Rom. See Ortel Parergo. Carthage was called Iustiniana, of Iustinian, Iunonia of Graeccbus. Hadrianopolis of Hadrian, and of Commodus. Alexandria Commodiana Togata. It was sacked the second time of Ca∣pellianus, President of Mauritania; thirdly, vnder Genserichus, of the Vandals; fourthly, of the Maurusians; fiftly, of the Persians; sixtly, of the Egyptians; lastly, of the Mahume∣tans.
Tripolis of Barbarie (for there is another of that Plin.l. 5.c.20. name in Syria, so called, because the Arcadians, Tyrians, & Sidonians inhabited it) was so named of three Cities, whose Colonies planted it, Abrotonum, and Tophia, and Leptis magna: or, as Solin.c. 36. Draudius. Martin.del Rio. others, Cesa, or Taphra, or Oea, Sabrada, and Leptis. It was built by the Romanes, conquered by the Gothes, and after by the Saracens. And after the destruction thereof, the Africans built a new Tripolis, wherein were many faire Temples, Colledges for Students, and Hospitals. Corne is alway deere, because their Fields are Sand. Io. Lco.l. 5. It was subiect vnto the King of Tunis, till the King of Fez carried away the King of Tunis prisoner. At which time the Genovese Fleet of twentie saile tooke Tripolis, and sold it to the Fezan for fiftie thousand duckats. But the Kings of Tunis recouered it after. Zacharias be∣ing King, played the Tyrant, and therefore was expelled, and a certaine Citizen was aduanced to the Throne; who at first gouerned modestly, but declining to tyrannie, was marthered: And a Courtier of Prince Abubacer, who had made himselfe an He∣remite, was forced to be their King, who ruled Tripolis, till Ferdinando sent Peter Na∣uarre thither, who came thither in the euening, and the next day tooke it: and the King remained captiue, till Charles the fift freed him. Charles gaue the Citie to the Knights of Malta, whome the Turkes Nic. Nicolay l.1.c. 18. G. Bot.Ben. Of Tripolis read T. Sanders in Hak. o. 2. part. 1. dispossessed by force, Anno 1551, and there haue their Beglerbeg or Vice-roy to this day. This was one and fortie yeares after Nauarre had taken it. The Kings of Tunis liued in great delicacie among their women, Musicians, Play∣ers, and such like, committing the gouernment to the Munafid, or high Steward, and other Officers. When hee calls for a Musician, he is brought in hood-winked like a Hawke. The inhabitants are exceeding prodigall in perfumes. They haue a compound called Lhasis. Lhasis, one ounce whereof being eaten, causeth laughing dalliance, and makes one as it were drunken, and maruelously prouoketh to lust. In the Kingdome of Tunis is placed the Lake Tritonia, where Minerna is said to haue shewed her selfe the in∣uenter of Spinning and of Oyle, and therefore worshipped. Ezzab is the most Easterly part of the Tunetan Kingdome, the chiefe Prouince whereof is Mesrata. The inhabitants are rich, and pay no tribute. There grow Dates and Oliues, and they traffique with the Numidians, to whom they carrie the wares which they buy of the Venetians. The Great Turke swayeth with his Ottoman Scep∣ter, at this present, this Kingdome of Tunis, and all Africa, from Bellis de Gomera to the Redde Sea (except that little which the Spaniard hath.) At this day Leo.l 1. they are Ma∣humetan, and haue beene about these nine hundred yeares past, from the time of Huc∣ba. The inhabitants of the Cities differ much from the Mountainers & ruder Rustikes. For they are studious, especially in matters of their law, as in times past they were also in Philosophie and the Mathematickes. But these last fiue hundred yeares their Princes and Doctors haue prohibited many Sciences, as Astrologie & Philosophie: according to the Mahumetan custome they vse much washing and resorting to the temples. They are very faithfull in their promises: and exceeding ielous. They goe through the world as Merchants, and in many places are interteined as Readers and Maisters in divers sci∣ences: and are well esteemed in Egypt, Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, India, Turky. The yon∣ger sorte yield much reverence to their Elders and Parents: and will not hold discourse of love or sing love-songs in their presence. But these citizens are very proude and re∣vengefull. The Lords esteeme more of their beastes, then of the common-people. The The Countrey-people in the fieldes and Mountaines live hardlie in labour and want. They are beastly, theevish, ignorant, vnfaithfull. Their women, before they be maried, may live as wantonly, as they list: yea, the father maketh (hatefull love to the daugh∣ter, & the brother is vnlovely loving to the sister. The Numidians are traitours, homi∣cides, theeves, and, for rewarde, will doe any thing. Such also are the Libyans; with∣out any kinde of letters, Faith, or Law, without Heaven or Earth; living (if that may be called a life) like Wilde beasts, for ignorance; like Devills, for wickednesse; like Dogs, for poverty. These things reporteth Leo of them, who lived among them: which may provoke vs to thankfullness to that Great GOD, who hath given vs such abundance for body and soule, in things present and future, temporall and eternall.
CHAP. IX. Of the Kingdomes of Tremisen, Algier, and other places, anciently called Mauritanis Caesariensis. THe Kingdome of Telensin or Tremisen, Io. Leo.lib. 4 Maginus. Boterus. Dom. Niger. Strabo lib. 17. beginning Westward from the Riuer of Zha and Muluia; Eastward, it bordereth on the Great Ri∣uer; Southward, vpon the desert of Numidia; and Northward, vpon the Mediterran Sea. It was by the Romans called Mauritania Caesa∣riensis: the name came of the Inhabitants called Mauri, and of the Greekes,  some say of their colour, because it is obscure and darke. They were supposed to come hither first with Hercules out of India. More likely it is that Arias Mont. in apparatu. Tremel. & Ian. they descended of Phut, the sonne of Cham, Gen. 10.6. Pliny menti∣ons a Riuer named Fut, in these parts, descending from Atlas. Salust saith Salust. belt. Ingurth. they came with Hercules, but were not Indians but Medes: and the name Medi turned af∣ter into Mauri. Vitruvius Vitruuius lib: 8. cap. 2. nameth Mauritania, Maurusia. Ortelius Ortel.Thesaur. testifieth, That in ancient coines it is read Mauretania, and so Tacitus Cornel.Tacit. hist. lib.2. readeth. Ptolomey diuideth it into Mauritania Caesariensis, which Victor Victor. Perse∣cutionis lib. 3. Vticensis calleth Maior, and Tingitania. Pliny Plin lib.5. cap. 1. & 2. ascribes this diuision to Caligula; Dion, to Claudius Casar: of whom it was sir∣named a Caesariensis of the mother Citie Caesarea, where he planted a Roman Colony, before called Iol, the Royall seat of Iuba, a man famous, for that he first raigned ouer both these Mauritania's, but more famous for his learning, whereby hee still liueth in the learned moniments of Pliny and others; author of much of our African reports. He in his childhood was led in triumph at Rome; his father Caesar. Com∣ment. de bello ciuili Africano lib. 5. Orosius l. 6. c. 16. R. Volater. l. 12. Iuba, the successour of Be∣chus, had before slaine himselfe in the ciuill warres. Augustius restored him to his fa∣thers Kingdome, to which he left his sonne Ptolomey, borne of the daughter of Anto∣nius, and Cleopatra, whom Caligula slew, and then diuided Mauritania into two Pro∣uinces, whereof this is called, as is said, Caesariensis of the Colony of Claudius Caesar. That which Procopius Precop. de bel∣lo Persico & Vandilico. lib. 4. hath written of the originall of these Maurusij, as he termes them, although in our first booke mentioned, here also may seeme to deserue relation. When Ioshua, or Iesus the sonne of Nun or Nane, had inuaded the Land of Canaan, the people fled into Egypt, and there multiplying, pierced into Africa, replenishing with people all that coast vnto the pillars of Hercules, vsing a semi-phaenician dialect. For all the Sea-coast from Sidon to Egypt, was anciently called Phaenicia. They built the towne Tinge in Numidia, where they erected two pillars of white stone neere a great fountaine, wherein was ingrauen in Phaenician letters, Wee Flee from the face of Iesus the Theese, the sonne of Naue. These are supposed the first inhabitants of Africa, and for that cause Antaeus their King, which encountred in single combate with Her∣cules, was said to be the sonne of the Earth. Afterwards when the Phaenicians came hither with Dido, they were heere receiued for kindreds sake, and permitted to build Carthage; which after grew so mightie, that it subdued and expelled the Maurusy themselues. The Romans made the Carthaginians, and other Africans Tributaries, and caused the Maurusy to inhabit the furthest parts of Africa: But in processe of time they, obtaining many victories against the Vandils, seated themselues in Mauritania, til Iustinian remoued them. Thus farre Procopius. Paulus Pauli Diace∣ni lustinianus. Diaconus recordeth also the same history, sauing that he saith the Egyptians would not receiue them, and therefore they passed into Africa. The Maurusy in the time of Iustinian were destroyed, and cap∣tiued in such multitudes, that a Maurusian slaue was valued but at the price of a sheepe. The author of this was Salomon, an Eunuch, according to a prophecie which they had a∣mongst thē, that one without a beard should destroy thē. But captiuitie could not much empaire their happines, whose very freedome was misery. Procop. Eadem Coelius Rodig. l. 18. c. 38. Suidas saith that they were bold: & fought fleeing and re∣turning vpon aduantage, like as we read of the Parthi∣ans. For they liued in smal base cottages, exposed to the Summer Sunnes, and Winter snowes, sleeping (except a few of the better sort) on the bare ground, alway wearing the same garment howsoeuer the season differed, and that torne and ragged: wanting bread and all other necessaries, neither grinding nor boyling that corne they had. Thus miserable were their bodies
and their soules more. For they had neither feare of GOD, nor reuerence of men, nor re∣spect of pledge, nor regard of oath, nor peace with any, but where feare constrained them. They had their women Prophetesses, which diuined by their sacrifices: a thing vnlawfull for their men to attempt. Of the numbers of their wiues they bragged, In Epistola ad Salomonem. that the Christiās which had but one wife, might feare the losse of their childrē, they which might haue fiftie wiues need not misdoubt issue and posteritie. And yet they were by many wars brought to smal numbers, and a few tribes or families. Leo Leo.lib.4. saith, that after the Romans were expelled, the ancient Gouernours called Beni Habdulguad of the fa∣mily of Magraua repossessed these parts: who were after dispossessed by Ghamrazen, Son of Zeijen, whose posterity raigned heere almost 380. yeares. But they were much vexed by the Kings of Fesse and Tunis. It was in later times called the kingdom of Te∣lensin, or of Tremisen, stretching in length from East to West 380. miles, in bredth not aboue fiue and twenty. The Kings could neuer satisfie the Numidians couetise, whose friendship they haue with great cost sought. It hath two frequented hauen townes, O∣ram and Mersalcabir, both taken and holden by the Spaniards. They were taken in the time of Ferdinando King of Spaine; for which cause Abuchemmen the Telensin King was expelled by his owne subiects, and Abuzeijen placed in his roome, which he could scarcely warme before he was slaine by Barbarussa the Turke, who conquered this Kingdome. Anno 1515. But Abuchemmeu sought to Charles the fifth for aid, by whose helpe he recouered his Kingdome, and paid a tribute to the Emperour. But Habdulla his succes∣sour detained the tribute, and submitted himselfe vnto Soliman the great Turke. Al∣gior remained to Barbarussa. This Munster Cos∣niog.lib.6. Barbarussa or Barbarossa was a meane fellow of base cōdition, who in his youth sold cheeses in Spaine for his liuing, & by his industry attained to great matters. There Knolles pag. 635. were of them two brethren, borne at Mytilene in Lesbos, their mother a Christian, their father a renegate Grecian, Horucius Barbarussa. and this Hariadenus Barbarussa. They first stole a Galliot, and so committing themselues to sea, by piracy vnder Cama∣les, a Turkish Pirate, they grew rich: and from one Gally, came to haue a Nauie of their owne, with which they scoured the coasts of Barbary. At the same time Surij Com∣ment, in Annum 1534. two brethren contended for the Kingdome of Algier, one of whom requesteth aid of Horucius, who so helped him against his brother, that he helped himself to the Kingdome, by the mur∣ther of the King his patron and ally, which he did not long enioy, being taken & slaine of the Spaniards, and his head sent into Spaine. But his brother Hariadenus succeeding him, became mighty both by sea & land, to the great damage both of the Moores and Christians: and Soliman moued by his same, sent for him, and made him Admirall of all the Turkish seas, and sea-forces, vnder whom he grew dreadfull, not to these parts of Barbary alone, which he subiected to the Turk, but to those countries of Christendom which are washed with the Mediterran: euen Rome it self quaking for fear of a second Hannibal, who after so many ages should by sea from Africa auenge the angry ghost of old Carthage. In the yeare 1538. The Pope, Emperour & Venetians, had with ioynt forces set forth a Nauy of aboue two hundred & fifty saile against him, but by mutual discords (the wonted aduantage of the Turks against the Christians) they made them∣selues both sport and spoile to this Turkish Pirate. The sea could no longer endure the successe of this Barbarian, but mad to see the Christians vnchristian madnes, & vnwil∣ling to submit his proud waues to the base thraldome of this base Turke, swelling with indignation, conspired with the neighbour element, which pretended equall quarrell for so often darkening his light, & poisoning his breath with those hellish smokes, and for vsurping those thunders, which had wont to be the airy priuiledge of his middle regiōs: these both agreed in their disagreeing with tempestuous fury to spoile the spoi∣lers: the winds from the Acroceraunian hills, and the seas on the Dalmatian shore, so girt in the Turks, with their equall vnequall siege, that twenty thousand of them were captiued and shut vp in Neptunes prisons, to become food to his family, and the new conquerours on euery shore, made their markets of Turkish commodities, and by wrackes testified to the Earth, that they had wrecked themselues on her and their ene∣mies. And yet did Barbarussa recouer himselfe by new forces, and hauing wonne Rhe∣gium;
came to Ostia, where he rode three daies; the Romans trembling meane while, and ready to leaue Saint Peter alone to locke out the Turkes if they came, So much more fortunate were his proceedings, then of Hali Bassa, who in the fight at Lepanto lost his life and Nauy, whereof Knolles saith fortie sunke; an hundred threescore and one Gallies and sixtie Gal∣liots taken. pag. 883. Michael Isselt, Com. in Ann. 1571. eightie fell to the seas share, and an hundred and thir∣ty saile to Don Iohn and his partners; the greatest blow that euer the Turke at sea re∣ceiued, and had the greatest King Iames in his Poem of Lepanto. Homer to sing it. But me thinkes I feele some Cynthius pulling me by the eare, & asking if the Pirats haue robbed me of my Religion, the most proper subiect of my discourse. Truly that irreligious crue while they seeke to winne other things, care not to lose that. But this Algier hauing beene of old, and still conti∣nuing a receptacle of Turkish rouers, could not be passed ouer, especially in these Pira∣ticall times, without some obseruation, being also the gate whereby the Turkish for∣ces first entred into Barbary. Iohn Io.Leo.lib.4. Leo writeth a little otherwise of Barbarussa and Algier. The Moores call this Citie Gezeir, the Spaniards Algier: and of old was called Mesgana of that African family which founded it. It containeth It hath now eightie thou∣sand persons, as Boterus affir∣meth. about foure thousand families: the buildings very sumptuous; Innes, Bath-stoues, and Temples very beau∣tifull: euery occupation hath a seuerall place by it selfe. It hath adioyning plaines very pleasant and fertile, one whereof is fiue and forty miles long, and almost thirtie broad. For many yeares it was subiect to the Kingdome of Telensin: but hearing that Bugia was gouerned by a King, they submitted themselues to him, paying him a tribute, o∣therwise in manner free. Then did they build themselues gallies, and molested with Piracies the Spanish Ilands of Maiorica, Minorica, and Ieuiza. Ferdinando therefore prouided an Armada against them, and built a Fort within shot of the Towne: where∣upon they requested peace, and promised tribute. But Barbarussa, when Ferdinando was dead, was sent for by the Citizens, and made Captaine ouer all their forces. He soone after murthered Selim Etteumi an Arabian Prince, which had beene created Go∣uernor of Algier, when Bugia was taken by the Spaniards: & possessed himselfe of the gouernment, & there coyned money, calling himselfe King; the neighbouring people yeelding him obedience and tribute. This was the beginning of Barbarussas greatnes: and at the most part hereof Leo was present, and lodged in his house which had beene Embassadour from Algier to Spaine, from whence he had brought three thousand bookes written in Arabian. And whiles I was at Tunis, I heard that Barbarussa was slaine at Telensin, and his brother This was Ha∣riaden the Tur∣kish Admirall. Cairadin succeeded. It was told me also that the Emperour Charles the fifth had sent two armies to surprise Algier, the first whereof was destroyed in the plaine, the second slaine and made slaues by Barbarussa, in the yeare of the Hegira 922. Thus farre Leo. In the yeare 1541. N c. Villagag∣non. de bac ex∣pedit. Sury Comm.in Ann. 1541. Charles himselfe with his Imperiall Nauy passed the seas, to like both purpose and effect, more ouercom∣ming himselfe in the patient bearing his losses, then his enemies whom he sought to assaile. He was moued to this expedition by the complaints of his subiects, against the Turkish Pirats, which vnder Asanaga, Barbarussa's Lieutenant, infested all those seas. But the tempestuous weather both at land and sea disappointed him, and after the losse of many, both men and shippes, was forced to returne, and, to make roome for his souldiers, caused his horses (their gallant breed notwithstanding) to bee cast ouer∣boord. Thus doth Algier still continue a sinke of Pirats; and now saith Maginus, there are in it not many lesse then fiue and twenty thousand Christian slaues; which in likeli∣hood at this time are encreased. Tripoli is also a seat of a Turkish Viceroy or Begler∣beg, and of Turkish Rouers. In the Kingdome of Telensin is the desert of Angad, wherein are store of Roes, Deere and Ostriches, Arabian theeues, and Lions. The Ca∣stle of Izli was sometime stored with Inhabitants, and stately walled. Since, it was in∣habited with religious persons, much reuerenced by the Kings of Telensin, and the Arabians, which giue free entertainment for three dayes vnto all trauellers. A little off runneth a Riuer, out of which they water their fields, which else would yeeld them no fruit. Guagida betwixt two stooles had vnquiet sitting, paying tribute both to the kings of Telensin, & the Arabiās. Ned Roma was built by the Romans, as the name te∣stifieth, for Ned signifieth like; & like it was, if Historiographers faile not, vnto Rome.
Heere and at Tebecrit dwelt great store of Weauers. Haresgol was sometime famous, but being destroyed by a King and Patriarch of Cairaoan, it bequeathed as it seemeth the greatnes therof to Telensin, which after grew in renowne. This towne giues name to this Kingdom. When Abu Tesfin reigned, it had in it sixteene thousand families. Io∣seph King of Fesse besiege it seuen yeares together, and almost famished them: but he being slaine by treason, they found victuals enough in their enemies camp (which they assailed & spoiled) for their reliefe. Forty yeares after Abulhesen King of Fez after thirty months siege tooke it, & beheaded their King. Here are many and beautifull Temples, hauing their Mahumetan Priests and Preachers. Likewise here are fiue Colleges most sumptuously built by the Kings of Telensin & Fesle, curiously wrought with Musaike worke, for the Arabian Muses & Students, which haue their maintenance there. Their Bathes & Innes Iomit. A great part of this City is inhabited with Iewes, distinguished by their yellow Turbants from the other Citizens, which being very rich, in the yeare of the Hegira 923. were robbed and brought to beggery. The Turks Gi.Bot.Ben. are now Lords thereof, between whō & Charles the fift, who had vndertaken their protection, the Ci∣ty is much impaired, as also by the wars betwixt the Seriffe & the Turk. Barbarossa subiected it. Batha is a great City, or rather was such: now ruined by wars. Not far hence in Leo's time kept a famous Heremit, much esteemed for his holinesse: who in short time grew so rich in horses & other cattell, that none in that region were cōparable to him. He paid nothing, nor any of his to the King, or to the Arabians, because they supposed him a Saint. I was told by his disciples (saith Leo) that the tenth of his corne is eight thousand bushels a yeare. A rich Here∣mite. He hath fiue hundred horses and mares, ten thousand small cattel, and two thousand oxen, besides that, he hath yearely sent him from diuers parts of the world, of almes and offering, betweene foure thousand and fiue thousand duckats. His fame is spread ouer Asia and Africa. His disciples are fiue hundred, which dwell with him, and liue at his charge, to whom he enioyneth neither penance nor la∣bour, but to reade ordinary prayers: and giues them some names of GOD to obserue in their prayers, which they are to mumble so many times a day. For which cause mul∣titudes resort to him to be his disciples, which after such instruction he sends home a∣gaine. He hath an hundred tents, some for strangers, some for shepheards, & others for his family. This good and lusty Heremit hath foure wiues, & many slaues, and by them many sons & daughters gallantly attired. His children also haue wiues and children, in so much that the whole family of this Heremite and his sons exceed fiue hundred. He is honored of the Arabians; & the King of Telensin is afraid of him. I, being desirous to know him, was entertained of him three daies, & supped with him euery night in secret roomes, where he shewed me among other things, bookes of Magike & Alchimy: and would haue proued to me that Magike was a true Science, whereby I thought him to be a Magician, because I saw him so much honored, and yet vsed neither sayings nor doings, but those inuocations of GOD by certaine names. Thus farre Leo lib. 4. Oran is Oran. subiect to Spaine, taken of Peter Nauarre. 1509. It hath ten thousand fa∣milies. The Turkes in vaine assaulted it, An. 1563. Their Piracies procured this Spa∣nish thraldome: vnto which Mersalcabir, a most famous Hauen, is also subiect. Tegdemt Tegdemt. is as the Arabian name signifieth, ancient. It sometime was famous & a∣boūded with men of learning & Poets. But he which would further be informed of the Cities of this Kingdome, let him reade Leo. The people of Bresch vse to paint a black crosse on their cheeke, & another vpon the palme of their hand. The same is obserued of diuers others, which yet know not the reason therof, being Mahumetans. The story saith, that the Gothes inuading and ruling these parts proclaimed freedome from tri∣bute to all such as would become Christians, a badge of which Christianity was this crosse, still kept, now their Religion is lost. The gouernment of these parts is, as is said, Turkish, The Beglerbeg hath chiefe title, but the Dinano hath chiefe power of iudgments and iurisdiction. The Corasan or Cap∣taine of the Ianizaries, being in many matters as great as the Beglerbeg. The Begler∣begs of Algier and Tunes make their principall profits of their places (which they hold three yeares, hauing first bought them at a deare rate) by their Piracies, which with
ioynt consent they exercise on these seas, all in manner being fish that comes to net, if they meet them conueniently notwithstanding any league, or peace holden with the Grand Signor. They also giue entertainment to such Pirats of other places as resort to them, either to sell their ill-gotten goods, or to ioyne their strength with them. As of late Pirates. Dansker and Warde haue beene famous in this infamie; the first, after his seruice with them and for them, receiuing his reward, by them suddenly killed at Tunes (where he was knowne notwithstanding his disguising himselfe, with purpose to haue surprised their Fleet): the other (a shame to our Countrey, of which he was) grew so rich by his Piracies, that he shewed at one time to (the Author of these reports) Iohn Pountesse, a bagge of Iewels, containing almost halfe a bushell, besides his other pur∣chases: And at last, that the end might manifest the wickednesse of these proceedings, Many Eng∣lish Christians vnworthy e∣ither of these names, turne from that faith (which they neuer had, but in profession) to professe themselues (for hell) Tur∣kish. he became an Apostata and Renegado from his Faith; and soone after died at Tunes: leauing his goods (for his goodnesse he had left before) vnto the Turkes, his body vn∣to a forren sepulchre, and his soule; let Pirats and Robbers (if they thinke they haue a∣ny soule) say whither. Algier was by Barbarussa subiected to the Turke, about the yeare 1534. Tunes An. 1574. three and twentie year after that Tripoli, in Barbary, another cage of like birds, and seat of a Beglerbeg, was taken from the Knights of Malta by Sinan Bassa. These Kingdomes the Turke hath in Africa, besides the great Kingdome of Egypt, and what he hath taken from Prester Iohn. In Egypt Knolles. are said to be an hundred thousand Tima∣riots, or horse-mens fees, which for that tenure of their land, without any charge to the Great Turke, are to serue where it pleaseth him to employ them. In this King∣dome of Algier are fortie thousand. CHAP. X. Of the Kingdome of Fesse, part of Mauritania Tingitana. MAuritania Tingitana (so called of Tingis, now Tanger, at the mouth of the Streits) is by Ptolomey Ptol.lib.4.c.1. bounded on the West, with the Westerne or Atlantike; on the North, with the Mediterran seas; on the East, with the Riuer Pliny calls this Riuer Mal∣vana. Mulvia or Malva, which diuideth it from Casariensis; on the South, with the inner Nations of Libya. Niger Dom.Nig.Aph.Com.1. saith, it was after cal∣led Setinensis, of the Citie Setia: more truly, Sitiphensis, of Sitiphis, which Procopius saith was the mother Citie of Tingitana. In this Prouince are now the famous Kingdomes of Fez and Marocco. Gi. Bot. Ben. The ancient inhabitants besides the Mau∣rusy (of which we haue spoken) were Plin.lib.5.c.2. the Massesuli, Autololes, Bannurri, and the Gae∣tulians which liued heere, and in other parts of Africa, as the Tartars do in Asia, and the Arabians in Africa, remouing their dwellings (if tent-wandrings may be so called) as their pastures faile them. So Silius writeth of them; Silius, lib.3. Nulla domus, plaustris habitant, migrare per arva Mos, at{que} errantes circumuectare Penates. House they haue none; but wandring still in Waines, They cart their houshold-gods about the Plaines. The Westerly point of Mauritania Pomponius beginneth at the Promontory, called, of their store of Vines, Ampelusia, Pompon. Me∣la.lib.1.cap.. cum Olivary annot. now Cabode Cantero, as Oliuarius affirmeth. In it was a cause sacred to Hercules, & beyond the same, Tingi, supposed to be built by An∣taus, for proofe whereof they shew his Target made of an Elephants hide, too huge and vnwealdie for any man of later times, and holden in great veneration. Next to this Tingi (which gaue name to the Countrey, after by Claudius Caesar, who sent a Colony thither, called Traducta Iulia) was a high mountain called Abyla, to which on the Spa∣nish coast was opposed Calpe, which two hills bare the name of Hercules pillars; Her∣cules himselfe (if we beleeue fabulous antiquity) making there a passage to the Ocean and Mediterran seas, for mutual view and entertainment. They are now called, Seuta on that side, and Gibraltar on this. A little hence was Iulia Constantia, a Colony of Au∣gustus, and Lixus, a Colony of Claudius. In this, Natal.Comes.Mythol.l.7.c.2. was Antaeus his Palace, and his combate with Hercules, and the Gardens of the Hesperides. Antaeus, if his Legend be
true, was Some say threescore and ten, and that Serterius sound him in his sc∣pulchre of that length. I can nasily beleeue both alike. threescore and foure cubits long, a cruell & inhospitall tyrant, who in his en∣countring with Hercules, was three times hurled dead to the earth, & so many times by his mother (the earth) reuiued: which Hercules perceiuing, held him vp in the aire till he had strangled him. Wherby they intend, that the Sunne reuiueth the Earth, signified by Antaeus & Hercules, but with his excessiue heat doth kill it. The Hesperides were the daughters of Hesperus, brother of Atlas; Aegle, Arethusa, Hespertusa. In their gardens grew those golden appels (the dowry of Iuno to Iupiter) kept by a Dragon, engendred of Typhon and Echidna, which had an hundred heads, and many voices, attended by the Priest of the Hesperides: These Hercules fetched away. This was the Poeticall tale; the truth whereof is said to be, that the daughters of Atlas were by Pirats and theeues, sent from Busiris King of Egypt, stolne; & redeemed by Hercules, who slew those theeues. These were borne to Atlas, of Hesperida, daughter of Hesperus his brother, called ther∣fore Atlantides and Hesperides, six in number. Atlas had an excellent kinde of sheepe, with yellow fleeces, which for this exploit he bestowed on Hercules; and taught him also the knowledge of Astronomy: in regard of which Science, Atlas is said to haue borne vp the Heauens with his shoulders, and Hercules to haue vndertaken his bur∣then. Whereas Natalis Bib.7.cap.7. Comes placeth these Gardens with Pliny, neere to Lixus, and yet nigh to Meroe and the red sea, betwixt which places is such a world of distance, it argueth how great errors great schollers may fall into by want of that so-much-neg∣lected studie of Geography, without which, History that delectable study is sicke of a halfe-dead palsie: one cause that hath moued me to ioine in my studies & in this work, the history of Time, with her manifold chāges & chances, & of Place together. Besides the Altar of Hercules, & wilde Oliues, there remained nothing in Plinies dayes of that Hesperian Garden. Niger Dom. Niger. Com.Apb.1. findes there a tree Mallow, twenty foot high, and aboue a fathome about. Of Mount Atlas they tell wonderfull tales, of the selfe-fertility thereof, the inhabitants neuer seene by day, the desert-like silence, the fires therein shining by night, the musike and mis-rule of the Aegypanes and Satyres, and the labours of Her∣cules and Perseus there. Iohn Leo shall better acquaint vs with the truth, then those fa∣bles of credulous antiquitie. Out of him therefore and other later Writers we will take view of the present face of Africa, there being little that can be said of their ancient Rites, more then is alreadie obserued. The Romans brought hither their language and Religion. The Vandals vnder Gensericus passing out of Spaine, made conquest of all in manner which the Romans had in Africa, of whose cruellty Victor Victor Vit∣censis Persecu∣tionis Vand. Vticensis an eye-wit∣nesse, hath written three bookes. The manifold battels and alterations of estate be∣twixt them, the Romans, Maurusians, and others, Procopius Procop. de Bello Vand. hath diligently recorded. It would be harsh and tedious heere to relate. The soile, saith Mela, is more noble then the people: of the miraculous fertility whereof, Dionysius Dion. Halicar. lib. 1. Munster Cosm lib. 6. Halicarnasseus, Munster, Boemus & others haue written, I know not how truly. That their corne yeelds an hun∣dred fold increase, and in some places an hundred and fiftie: that there are seene Vines as great as two men can fathome, and grape-clusters a cubit long, &c. It is The atrum Arnoldi Mer∣manij. thought that Christian Religion was heere preached in the Apostles time. Leauing those things of more age and vncertaintie, we will come now to the King∣domes of Fez and Marocco, which haue beene of Saracenicall erection in this Pro∣uince of Tingitana. Io.Leo.lib.3. G.Bot.Ben. Maginus. That of Fez stretcheth from Azamor to Tanger, and from the Atlantike Ocean to Muluia. This Riuer is the Easterne border, on the North it is wash∣ed with the Sea, on the South is the Kingdome of Marocco, on the West, the Riuer Ommirabih. The Riuers Subu, Luccus, and others, water it. Therein are numbred se∣uen Prouinces, Temesna, the territory of Fez, Azgar, Elhabet or Habat, Errif, Garet, and Chaus or Elchauz: euery of which, saith Leo, had in old times a seuerall Gouernor. Neither was the City of Fez the royall seat, but was built by a Schismaticall Rebell, in whose family the gouernment continued 150. yeares. And then the Marin family preuailing, gaue it first the title of a Kingdome, setling their abode and strength therin. Temesna beginneth at Ommirabih, thence stretching Eastward to Buragrag, be∣tweene Atlas and the Ocean. It is a plaine Country, eighty miles in length, containing in it forty great Townes, besides three hundred Castles. In the yeare of the Hegeira 323. Chemim the sonne of Menal, an Hermeticall Preacher, perswaded them to pay no
tribute, nor yeeld subiection to Fez, because the Lords thereof were vniust, bearing himselfe for a Prophet, and in small time gate into his hand the spirituall & temporall sword, holding the same by force & armes. But after that Ioseph had built Marocco, he sought by Catholike Doctors of the Mahumetan Religion, to reduce them from their Heresie, but they slew them, and with an Armie of 50000. marched towards Marocco to expell thence the house of Luntuna, but by this means brought destruction to them∣selues; Ioseph getting the better, and spoiling their Country, ten moneths together, with great cruelty. It is thought that a Million of people by famine, sword, rocks, and riuers, were consumed: and Temesna was left to be inhabited of Wolues, Lyons, and ciuet-Cats, 150. yeares: at which time King Mansor gaue the possession of Temesna to certaine Arabians, who fiftie yeares after were expelled by the Luntune Familie, re∣couering the Kingdome from the house of Mansor; and after, the Marin Familie pre∣uailing gaue it to the people of Zenete and Haora, in meede of their seruice, which they had done to the Marins against the King and Patriarch of Marocco. From which time they haue enioyed the same almost two hundred yeares. Anfa was a Towne of great trade with the English and Portugals, and by these vtterly rased: and so the A∣rabians serued the next City Mansora. Nuchaila, sometimes famous for their plenty of corne, of which it is recorded, that they would giue a Camels burthen for a paire of shooes, hath now but a few bones left of her carkasse, namely a peece of the wall, and one high steeple, where the Arabians, after they haue ended their tilth, lay vp their in∣struments of husbandry, none daring to steale his Neighbours tooles, in reuerence of a Saint of theirs, there buried. Rebat is a Towne furnished with Colleges, and Tem∣ples, the modell of Marocco. At Sella was King Mansor buried, where he had built a stately Hospitall, and Palace, a beautifull Temple, and a Hall of Marble cut in Mosaike worke, with glasse windowes of diuers colours, wherein he and his posteritie were bu∣ried. I saw, saith Leo, the Sepulchre, and copied out the Epitaphes of thirtie of them. Madur Anvan by the ruines testifieth her somtime proud buildings, hospitals, Innes, and Temples. In Thagia is visited the Sepulchre of a holy man, which liued in the time of Habdul Mumon the Calif or Patriarch, who wrought great miracles against the Lyons, where with the Towne is much molested. Ettedle, a Mahumetan Doctor, wrote a Legend of his miracles, which Leo saith he had read, and supposed that they were done either by Naturall or Deuillish Magike. The Fessans after their Easter, yearely re∣sort to his Tombe with such numbers of men, women, and children, and their Tents, that they seeme an Armie. It standeth from Fesse 120. miles, so that their going and returning in this Pilgrimage lasteth fifteene daies. My Father carried me yearely thi∣ther when I was a child, and since, I haue beene there many times, by reason of many vowes which I made, being in danger of Lyons. Where Zarfa stood, the Arabians now Segesest, vbi Troia fuit. fow corne. The Territory of Fez hath on the West the Riuer Buragrad; on the East, Inaven; on the North, Subu; and Atlas on the South. Sella was built by the Romans, sacked by the Gothes, subiect since to Fesse. The buildings are of Mosaike worke, supported with marble pillars: euen the shops are vnder faire and large porches, and there are ar∣ches to part occupations. All the Temples are beautifull. In this Towne the Geno∣waies, English, Flemings, and Venetians, vsed to trade. The Spaniards tooke it in the 670. of the Heg. but lost it againe within ten daies. Fanzara was destroyed by Satrid. who with certaine Arabians besieged Fez seuen yeares together, and destroied the Villages in the Country about. Mahmora was made famous by the slaughter of the Portugals, whose bloud dyed the Sea three dayes together, blushing to see the barbarous Barbarian spill so much Christian bloud. Leo was there present, and num∣breth the slaine Christians at ten thousand, besides the losse of their ships and Ordi∣nance, whereof the Moores tooke vp foure hundred great brasse peeces out of the Sea, in the yeare of the Heg. 921. Fez, or Fesse, was built in the time of Aron the Calif, in the 185. yeare of the Heg. or Mahumeticall computation. It had this Fez signifi∣eth gold, in A∣rabian. golden title, because on the first day of the foundation there was found some quantitie of gold. The Founder was named
Idis is, Arons neare Kinsman, to whom the Califaship was more due. For he was Ne∣phew of Hali, Mahumets Cosen, who married Elsewhere called Fatima. Falerna, Daughter of Mahomet, and therefore, both by Father and Mother of that kindred: whereas Aron was but in the halfe bloud, being Nephew to Habbus, the Vncle of Mahumet. Howbeit both these families were depriued of the Califate: and Aron by deceit vsurped Of this read our third book: the difference seemeth to bee more in names then truth. For Arons grand∣father fained himselfe willing to transferre that dignity to Hali, and caused the house of Vmene to loose it, and Habdulla Seffec became the first Caliph who persequuted the house of Hali openly, chasing some into Asia, and some into India. But one of them remained in Elmadina, of whom (because he was old and religious) hee had no great feare. His second Sonnes grew in such fauour, with the people, that they were forced to flee, and one being taken and strangled, the other, which was this Idris, escaped into Mauritania, where hee grew in such reputation, that in short time hee got both swords into his hand, and dwelt in the Hill Zaron, thirtie miles from Fez, and all Mau∣ritania payed him Tribute. He dyed without issue, only he left his slaue with child; shee was a Goth become Mahumetan, and had a sonne, which after his father was cal∣led Idris. He succeeded in the Principality, and was brought vp vnder the discipline of a valant Captaine, named Rasid: and beganne to shew great prowesse at fifteene yeares. He afterwards, increasing in power, built on the East-side of the Riuer a small City of three thousand Families. After his death, one of his sonnes built an other City on the West-side: both which Cities so increased, that there was small distance be∣tweene them. An 180. yeares after, there arose ciuill warres betwixt these two Cities, which continued a hundred yeares. And as Esops Kite erued the Mouse and Frog, so Ioseph of the Luntune Familie, apprehending this aduantage, tooke both their Lords, and slew them, and thirtie thousand of the Citizens. He brake downe the walls which parted the two Cities, and caused many Bridges to be made, and brought them both to be one City, which he diuided into twelue Wards. The City is now both great and strong. The sweet situation of Fez. It seemes that Nature and Art haue play the wantons, & haue brought forth this City, the fruit of their daliance: Or else, they may seeme corriuals, both, by all kind offices, seeking to winne her loue: So doth the earth seeme to dance, in little Hillocks and prety Vallies, diuersifying the soile: so doth the Riuer disperse it selfe into manifold channels, no sooner entering the City, but it is diuided into two armes, where with it embraceth this louely Nymph: and these subdiuided, as it were, into many fingers, in variety of water-courses, insinuating it selfe vnto euery street and member thereof: and not contented thus in publike to testifie affection, finds meanes of secret intelligence with his loue by conduit-pipes, closely visiting euery Temple, College, Inne, Hospitall (the speciall chambers of his Spouse,) Yea & almost euery priuate house: from whence with an officious seruice he carryeth the filth that might offend either sight or sent of his Bride, which still enioying, he wooeth, and euer wooing enioyeth. Neither is Art behind in his proffered courtesies, but still presents her with Mosaike works, as chaines and Iewels to adorne her: with fine bricks and stones framed into most artificiall Fa∣bricks, both louely for delight, and stately for admiration. The roofes of their houses are adorned with Gold, Azure, & other excellent colours, which are made flat for the Inhabitants vse and pleasure: whose houses are richly furnished, euery chamber with a presse curiously painted and varnished. And who can tell the exquisitnesse of the por∣tals, pillars, cisterns, and other parts of this Cities furniture? Once, let the Temples therein a while detayne your eyes, whereof there are in Fez, together with smaller Chappels or Moschees, about seuen hundred, fifty of which are great and faire a∣dorned with marble pillars, and other ornaments, the chapiters thereof wrought with Mosaike and carued works. Euery one hath his Fountaines of marble, or other stones not knowne in Italy. The floores are couered with mats, closely ioyned, and so are the wals a mans height lined therewith. Euery Temple hath his steeple after the Mahume∣tan manner, whereon they, whose office it is, ascend and call the people at the appoin∣ted houres to praier: there is but one Priest thereunto, who saith their seruice there, and hath charge of the reuennue of his Church, taking accounts thereof, to bestow it on the Ministers of the said temple, namely those which keep the lamps light in the night, the Porters, & them which crie in the night-time, to call them to Church. For he which
cryeth in the day-time, is only freed from tenths, and other payments, otherwise hath no salarie or stipend. There is one principall and (if wee may so terme it) Cathedrall Church, called the Temple of Caruven, so great, that it containeth in This com∣passe is to be vnderstood of all the buil∣dings. circuit about a mile and halfe. It hath 31. Gates, great and high. The roofe is 150. Tuscan Braccia di Toscana. yards long, and little lesse then 80. broad. The steeple is exceeding high. The roofe here∣of is supported with 38. arches in length, and 20. in breadth. Round about are cer∣taine Porches on the East, West, and North, euery one in length 40. yeards, and in breadth 30. Vnder which Porches or Galleries are Magazines or Store-houses, where in are kept lamps, oile, mats, and other necessaries. Euery night are lighted 900. lamps; for euery arch hath his lamp, especially that row of arches which extends through the mid-quire, which alone hath 150. lamps, in which ranke are some great lights made of brasse, euery of which hath sockets for 1500. lamps. And these were bells of certaine Cities of Christians, conquered by the Fessan Kings. About the walls of the said Tem∣ple within, are pulpits of diuers sorts, wherein many learned Masters read to the peo∣ple such things as pertaine to their faith and spirituall law. They beginne a little after breake off day, and end at Vnbora di giorao. one houre of the day. In Sommer they read not but after 24. houres or Sunne-set, and continue till an houre and halfe within night. They teach aswell morall Philosophie, as the Law of Mahomet. Priuate men reade the Sommer∣Lectures, only great Clerks may read the other, which haue therefore a large stipend, and books, and candles, are giuen them. The Priest of this Temple is tied to nothing but his Mumpsimus, or Seruice. Also he taketh charge of the money and goods, which are offered in the Temple for Orphans: and dispenseth the reuennues that are left for the poore: euery holy day he dealeth to the poore of the City money and corne, ac∣cording as their necessitie is more or lesse. The Treasurer of this Church is allowed a Ducat a day. He hath vnder him eight Notaries, each of which haue six Ducats a mo∣neth: other six Clerkes gather the Rents of Houses and Shops, which belong to the Church, retayning the twentieth part thereof for their wages. Moreouer, there are twenty Bayliffs of the husbandry, that ouer-see the labourers. Not farre from the Ci∣ty are twentie Lyme-kills, and as many Brick-kills, seruing for the reparations of the Temple, and the houses thereto belonging. The reuennues of the Temple are This may be reckoned as old rent with vs, which now is exceedingly improued: for Lo wrote this, An. 1526. of his former ob∣seruations. two hundred Ducats a day. The better halfe is laid out on the premisses. And if any Tem∣ple of the City or Moschee be without reuennue, they are hence furnished with many things. That which remaines goeth to the common good of the City. In the City are two principall and most stately Colleges of Schollars, adorned with Mosaikes and carued workes, paued with marble and stones of Maiorica. In each of them are many chambers; in some Colleges are a hundred, in some more, and in some lesse. They were all built by diuers Kings of the Marin Familie. One is most beauti∣full, founded by King Abu Henon. It is adorned with a goodly Fountaine of marble, and a streame continually running: there are three Cloisters, or Galleries, of incredi∣ble beauty, supported with eight square Pillars of diuers colours, the arches adorned with Mosaike of Gold and fine Azure. The roofe is of carued worke. About the walls are inscriptions in Verse, expressing the yeare of the foundation, and praises of the Founder. The gates of the College are of brasse, fairely wrought, and the dores of the chambers carued. In the great Hall where they say their prayers is a Pulpit, that hath 9. staires to it, all of Iuorie & Ebonie. This College cost the founder 480000. Ducats. All the other Colleges in Fesse hold some resemblance with this, and in euery of them are Readers or Professors in diuers Sciences, prouided for by the Founders. In old times the Students were wont to haue their diet and raiment allowed for 7. yeares, but now they are allowed only their chamber: for the Bellona, ene∣mie to the Mu ses. wars of Satrid consumed their possessi∣ons. So that now there remaines but little wherewith they maintaine their Readers, and of them some haue 200. Ducats, some 100. yearely, and some lesse. And there a∣bide in the said Colleges, only a few strangers maintained by the almes of the citizēs; When they will reade, one of the auditors readeth a Text, and the Reader then readeth his Comments, and brings some exposition of his owne, and explaneth the difficulties. And somtimes in his presence the Students dispute of that argumēt which he handleth. There are many Hospitals in Fesse, not inferiour in building to the Colleges afore∣said.
In them strangers were entertained three daies at the common charge. But in the time of Satrids warre the King sold their reuennues. Now, only learned men and Gentlemen receiue entertainement, and poore persons reliefe. There is an other Ho∣spitall for diseased strangers, which haue their diet, but no phisick allowed them. Here also mad men are prouided for. In this Hospitall Leo in his youth had beene a Notarie. There are in Fez a hundred bath-stoues well built, with foure Halls in each, and cer∣taine Galleries without, in which they put off their clothes. The most part of them per∣taine to the Temples and Colleges, yeelding them a great rent. They haue a yearely festiuall wherein all the seruants of the Bathes with trumpets and great solemnitie goe forth of the Towne, and gather a wilde Onion, which they put in a brasen Vessell, and bring it solemnely to the hot-house dore, and there hang it vp in token of goodluck. This Leo thinks to be some sacrifice, obserued by the ancient Mores, yet remaining. E∣uery African towne had somtimes their peculiat feast, which the Christians abolished. Innes here are almost two hundred, built three stories high, and haue a hundred and twentie chambers a peece, with Galleries afore all the dores. But here is no prouision of bed or board for strangers. The Inne-keepers of Fez are all of one familie, called Elcheua, and are attired like women, shaue their beards, become womanish in their speech, yea degenerate euen to the wheele and spindle. They are so Infamous Inne keepers. odious (except to base villaines that resort thither) that the better sort of people will not speake to them: and may not enter the Temple, Burse, or Bathe, nor into those Innes next the great Temple, where Merchants are entertained. There are thousands of mils, all al∣most pertaining to the Temples and Colleges reuennue. Each trade in Fesse hath a peculiar place alotted thereto, the principall whereof are next the great Temple: as Scriueners, Booke-sellers &c. euery trade by themselues. The Christian captiues rest only vpon Fridaies, and eight other daies in the yeare fe∣stiuall to the Mores. There are six hundred fountaines walled about, the waters where∣of are conueied by conduicts to the Temples, or other places, because the Riuer is sometimes drie. They haue in Fez a Iudge for criminal! causes, and an other for que∣stions of Religion. A third that deales in Matrimoniall cases. From these there lieth an appeale to the high Aduocate. The Iudges of Mahomets law in matters of conscience haue no allowance for the same. Their marriages are thus. When the Father of the Maid hath espoused her to her The man ne∣uer seeth his Bride before marriage: but sends his Mo∣ther, or some other Woman to see her: and vpon that re∣port agreeth with the Fa∣ther. louer. They goe with their friends to Church, & haue with them two Notaries which draw the couenāts agreed betwixt them into writing. The Father bestowes a dowrie or portion of mony, apparell, and such like; seldome, of land. When the Bridgrome setcheth her home, she is set in a cabinet, couered with silk, and carried by Porters, accompanied with her Kins-folks, & much minstrelsie: and the Bridgromes friends goe before with torches, and her kinsmen after, toward the great Church. Then he hasteth home, expecting his Bride in his chamber, whom her Father, Brother, & Vncle, bring and deliuer to his Mother: & he setting his foot on hers, shuts the chamber dore. At which a woman standeth and receiueth of him a napkin stained, which she sheweth to the assembly as a testimonie of the Brides virginitie: but if she be not found a Maide she is returned to her friends with shame, and the guests goe home without their feast. They hold great feasting also at the circumcision of their male∣children, which is the seuenth day after they are borne. The Barber or Circumciser is presented with gifts of all the inuited guests. Then followeth mirth and iollitie. They vse dancings, but the women a-part by themselues without men. There is a remainder of holy daies instituted by the Christians which themselues vn∣derstand not. On Christ-masse Euen they eate a sallet made of diuers hearbs, and seeth all kinds of pulse which they feede vpon. On New-yeares day the children goe with maskes on their faces to the houses of Gentlemen, and haue fruits giuen them for sing∣ing certaine songs. On the feast of S. Iohn Baptist they vse to make bone-fires. They make a feast, called Dentilla, (when their childrens teeth begin to grow) vnto other children. When a man dies, the women put on sack-cloth, and defile their faces with dirt. They call to them those wicked men in womens attire, which haue foure square drums, to the sound whereof they sing mournfull ditties, in praise of the dead partie. At the end of euery verse the women vtter most hideous shrikes & outcries, tearing their
haire and beating their brests & cheeks, till they be all embrued with bloud. And thus they continue seuen daies, and then intermit their mourning fortie daies, after which space they resume the same for three daies, as before. But the better sort behaue them∣selues more modestly. At this time all the widowes friends come about her to comfort her, and send her diuers kinds of meats: for in the mourning house they may dresse no meat at all, till the dead be carried out. The woman which looseth her Father, Brother, or Husband, neuer goes forth with the Funerall. At some festiuals, the youths of one street will fight with clubs against the boies of an other street, and sometimes betake them to other weapons, and kill one an other. Sometimes they vse these bloudie fraies without the Citie, the Officers forcing them to better order. There are many Poets which pen amorous Sonnets: and on Mahomets birth-day make verses in his cōmen∣dation, resorting early to the Palace, and there ascending the Tribunall, reade their verses to the people: and he whose verses are best, is pronounced that yeare Prince of the Poets. The Marin Kings on that day vsed to entertaine the learned men, and to re∣ward the best Poet with a hundred duckets, a horse, a woman-slaue, & the Kings robes which he ware that day. In Fez are two hundred Grammer Schooles, built like great Halls. Euery day they learne one lesson of the Alcoran. They reade and write not in bookes, but in great These tables are boords like horne bookes, when one les∣son is learned, that is wiped out, and an o∣ther written: & so through∣out the Alco∣ran, till all bee learned. tables. In seuen seuen yeares they learne the whole Alcaron by heart. And then the father inuiteth his sonnes Schoole-fellowes to a banket: and his sonne rides through the street in costly apparell, both which are lent by the Gouernor. The other boies ride and sing songs in praise of GOD and Mahumet. On Mahumets birth-day euery boy must carry a torch to schoole curiously wrought, some weighing thirtie pound, which they light before day, and let them burne till Sun-rising, singing all the while the praises of Mahumet. The Schoolemasters haue the remnant of the wax which sometimes they sell for a hundred duckets. They are free Schooles anciently built. In the Schooles, and also in the Colleges, they haue two daies of recreation e∣uery weeke, wherein they neither teach nor studie. There be three kinds of Fortune∣tellers, or Diuiners. One of which vseth Geomanticall figures: others powre a drop of oile into a glasse of water, which becōmeth cleare as a seeing glasse: in which they say they see strange sights, rankes of Deuils, like armies, some trauelling, some passing o∣uer a Riuer, &c. When the diuiner seeth them quiet, he demandeth such questions of them as he will, and the Deuils with gestures returne answere. The third sort are wo∣men-witches, which make the people beleeue that they are acquainted with Deuils of diuers sorts, red, white, black: and when they will tell any mans fortune they persume themselues with certaine odors, whereby (as they say) the Deuill entreth into them, and their voice is presently altered, as if the Deuill spake within them. And then they that come to enquire aske their questions, and so hauing left their present for the De∣uill, depart. These Female fifthinesse. women vse vnlawfull lusts betweene themselues in mutuall silthi∣nesse: and if faire women come to them they will demand the Deuils fee, that they may haue such dealing with them. Yea some addicting themselues to these abhomi∣nable practises will faine themselues sick, and send to one of these witches, which will affirme, that shee is possessed with a Deuill, and cannot be cured, except shee become one of their society. The foolish husband beleeues, consents, and makes a sumptuous feast at that her deuillish admission. Others will coniure this Deuill with a cudgell out of their wiues: others faining themselues to be possessed with a Deuill, will deceiue the witches, as they haue deceiued their wiues. There are Exorcists or Diuiners, called Mubazzimi, which cast out Deuils, or, if they cannot, they excuse themselues, and say it is an Aerie spirit. They write characters, and frame circles on an ash-heape, or some other place: then they make certaine signes on the hands or foreheads of the possessed partie, and perfume him after a strange manner. Then they make their inchantment, and demand of the spirit, which way he entred, what he is, & his name: and then com∣mand him to come forth. Others there are that worke by a Cabalisticall rule, called Zairagia, and is very hard: for he that doth this must be a perfect Astrologer and Caba∣list. My selfe (it is Leo's report) haue seene an whole day spent in describing one figure only. It is too tedious here to expresse the manner. Howbeit, Mahomets law forbids all diuination, & therefore the Mahumetan Inquisitors imprison the Professors thereof.
There are also in Fez some learned men which giue themselues the sirnames of Wise∣men and morall Philosophers, which obserue lawes not prescribed by Mahumet: some account them Catholike, others not, but the vulgar hold them for Saints. The law forbiddeth loue-songs, which they say may bee vsed. They haue many rules and orders, all which haue their Defenders and Doctors. This Sect sprang vp foure∣score yeares after Mahumet. The first Author thereof was Elhesen Ibnu Abil∣basen, who gaue rules to his Disciples, but left nothing in writing. About an hundred yeares after came Elbarit Ibun Esed, from Bagadet, who left volumes of writings vnto his Disciples: But by the Lawyers was condemned. Fourescore yeares after, vn∣der an other famous Professor, that law reuiued, who had many Disciples and preach∣ed openly. But by the Patriarke and Lawyers, they were all condemned to loose their heads; the giddie receptacles of such fantasticall deuotions. But hee obtained leaue of their Caliph or Patriarch, that he might trie his assertions by disputations, with the Lawyers whom he put to silence. And therefore the sentence was reuoked, and ma∣ny Colleges built for his followers. A hundred yeares after Malicsach the Turke de∣stroied all the maintainers thereof, some sleeing into Cairo, some into Arabia. Not long after, Elgazzuls a learned man compounded the controuersie; so reconciling these and the Lawyers, that the one should be called Conseruers, the other Reformers of the Law. After the Tartars had sacked Bagdat in the yeare of the Hegeira 656. these Sectaries swarmed all ouer Asia and Africa. They would admit none into their Societie, but such as were learned, and could defend their opinions: but now they ad∣mit all, affirming Anabapti∣sticall fancies in Fez. learning to be needlesse, for the Holy teacheth them that haue a cleane heart. Therefore they addict themselues to nothing, but pleasure, feasting, and singing. Sometimes they will rend their garments, saying, They are then rauished with a fit of diuine loue. I thinke rather superfluitie of belly-cheare is the cause: for one of them will eate as much as will serue three, or else it is through wicked lust. For sometimes one of the principals with all his Disciples is inuited to some marriage feast, at the beginning whereof they will rehearse their deuout Orizons and Songs: but after they are risen from table, the elder beginne a dance, and teare their garments, and if through immoderate drinking any catch a fall, one of the youths presently take him vp, and wantonly kisse him. Whereupon ariseth the Prouerbe, The Heremites banket, signifying, that the Scholler becomes his masters Minion. For none of them may marrie, and are called Heremites. Among these Sects in Fez are some rules esteemed Hereticall, of both forts of Do∣ctors: Some hold that a man by good Workes, Fasting, and Abstinence, may attaine to the nature of an Angell, the vnderstanding and heart being thereby so purified, say they, that a man cannot sinne, though he would. But to this height is ascended by fif∣tie steps of discipline. And though they fall into sinne before they be come to the fif∣tieth degree, yet will not God impute it. They vse strange and incredible fastings, in the beginning, but after, take all the pleasures of the world. They haue a seuere forme of liuing set downe in foure bookes, by a certaine learned man, called Essehrauar de Sehranard in Corasan. Likewise an other of their Authors, called Ibnul Farid, wrote all his learning in wittie Verses, full of Allegories, seeming to treat of Loue. Where∣fore one Elfargano commented on the same, and thence gathered the rule and the de∣grees aforesaid. In three hundred yeares none hath written more elegant Verses, which therefore they vse in all their bankets. They hold that the Heauens, Elements, Planets, and Starres, are one God, and that no Religion is erroneous, because euery one takes that which he worships for God. They thinke that all knowledge of God is contained in one man, called Elcorb, elect by God, and wife as hee. Forty, among them are called Elanted, which signifieth blocks. Of these is Elcoth or Elcorb elected, when the former is dead: threescore and ten Electors make the choice. There are se∣uen hundred and threescore and fiue others, out of whom those threescore and ten E∣lectors are chosen. The rule of their order binds them to range vnknowne through the world, either in manner of fooles, or of great sinners, or of them the vilest man that is. Thus some wicked persons of them goe vp and downe naked, shamefully shewing their shame, and like brute beasts will sometimes haue carnall dealings with women
in the open streets; reputed neuerthelesse by the common people for Saints, Vide.l.3.c.7, as we haue shewed elsewhere. There is an other sort called Caballists, which fast strangely, eate not the flesh of any liuing creature: but haue certaine meates and habites appoin∣ted for euery houre of the day, and of the night, and certaine set praiers according to the daies and moneths, strictly obseruing the numbers of them, and carrie square ta∣bles with characters and numbers engrauen in them. They say that good spirits ap∣peare to them, and talke with them, instructing them in the knowledge of all thinges. There was amongst them a famous Doctor, called Boni, which composed their rule and orders, whose booke I haue seene, seeming to fauour more of Magick then the Cabala. Their notablest workes are eight. The first, called Demonstration of light, containeth fastings and praiers. The second, their square Tables. The third, foure∣score and nineteene vertues in the name of GOD contained, &c. They haue an other rule among these Sects, called Suach, the rule of Heremites; the Professors whereof inhabit woods, and solitarie places, without any other suste∣nance then those desarts afford. None can describe their life, because they are estran∣ged from all humane societie. He that would see more of these things, let him reade the booke of one Elefacni, who writeth at large of the Mahumetan Sects, whereof are threescore and twelue Principall, each maintaining his owne for truth, and the way to saluation. Two are most predominant in these daies; that of Leshari in Africa, Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and Turkie; and the other of Imamia in Persia, and Corasan, more lately broched. Al∣though I haue spoken before of the Saracen sects, yet could I not but follow Leo in his reports of them here. As for these Gold-finders & Alchymists. Coniurers, which by art magick professe to finde gold, which indeede loose gold to finde it; and the Alchymists, which seeking to turne other mettals into gold, turne their gold into other mettals, and the books that both these haue of their sciences: likewise the Snake-charmers, and other baser people, I passe ouer. In the Suburbs of Fez are a hundred and fiftie caues, hewen out of excellent marble, the least of which will hold a thousand measures of corne. This is the sinke of Fez where euery one may be a Vintner and a Bawde. An other suburbe hath two hundred families of Lepers, which are there prouided for: and all of that qualitie forced to keepe there. In new Fez the Iewes haue a street, wherein they haue their houses, shops, and Sy∣nagogues: and are meruailously increased since they were driuen out of Spaine. They are gold-smiths: for the Mahumetans may not be of that trade, because they say it is vsurie to sell things made of gold or siluer for more then their weight, which yet is per∣mitted to the Iewes. They liue in exceeding contempt, not being permitted to weares shooes, but in steed thereof vse socks made of rushes. They weare a black turbant, and if any will weare a cap hee must fasten a red cloth thereunto. They paied to the King of Fez monethly in Leo's time one thousand and foure hundred Duckats. The Mahumetan temporall Lords are not by their law to hold any other reuennue, then of euery subiect which possesseth an hundred Duckats, two & a halfe for Tribute, and of corne the tenth measure yearely. Yea, this is to be paied into the Patriarke or Califs hand, who should bestow that which remaineth ouer and aboue the Princes ne∣cessitie, on the common profit; as, for the poore, and maintenance of warres. But now the Princes haue tyrannised further, especially in Africa, where they haue not left the people sufficient for their needments. And therefore Courtiers are odious (no lesse then the Publicans sometimes among the Iewes) no man of credit vouchsafing to in∣uite them to their tables or receiue gifts from them; esteeming all their goods theft and briberie. Nor may any Mahumetan Prince weare a Diademe, which yet it seemes is now broken. In Gualili a Towne of Mount Zarhon is Idris, of whom before is spoken, buried; all Barbarie religiously visiteth his Sepulchre. Pharao is the name of a Towne, by the vulgar supposed the worke of Pharao, which fond conceit grew from a booke, entitu∣led, The booke of the words of Mahomet, taken out of an Author, called Elcalbi, which saith with Mahomets testimonie, that there were foure Kings which ruled all
the world; Two faithfull, and two vnfaithfull: the two former, Salomon and Alexander Magnus: the two later, Nimrod and Pharao. The Latin inscriptions there seene shew it was the worke of the Romans. In Pietra Rossa, a Towne by, the Lyons are so tame that they will gather vp bones in the streets, the people not fearing them. The like LyonsTame Lyons. are in Guraigura, where one may driue them away with a staffe. At Agla the Lyons are so fearefull that they will flee at the voice of a child; whence a coward brag∣gart is prouerbially called a Lyon of Agla. Shame is the name of a Castle, so called of their shamefull couetousnesse; which, when they once requested the King then en∣tertained amongst them to change, he consented. But the next morning, when they had brought him vessells of milke, halfe filled vp with water, hoping the King would not perceiue it, he said that none could alter nature, and so left them, and their name to them. We haue now passed two Prouinces of the Kingdome of Fez: the third is named Azgar, which hath the Riuers Buragrag, on the West; Bunasar, on the South; the Ocean, on the North; and Eastward, the Mountaines. Here standeth Casar Elcabir, which King Mansor gaue to a poore Fisher, who had giuen him kind entertainment in his cottage one night when he had lost his cōpany in hunting. In it are many temples, one College of Students, and a stately Hospitall. Habat, the fourth Prouince or Shire of this Kingdome, is next hereunto, and containeth almost 100. miles in length, and 80. in breadth. Ezaggen, a Towne of Fez, are permitted by an ancient priuilege of the Kings of Fez to drinke wine, notwithstanding Mahomets prohibition. Arzilla, saith Leo, was taken by the English, then worshippers of Idols, about 900. yeares after Christ. The Religion, I thinke, deceiues him. He ads, that the Towne remained with∣out habitation 30. yeares, & then one of the Mahumetan Patriarchs of Cordoua, then Lord of Mauritania, reedified it. Of the acts of the English it is not vnworthy the re∣hearsing, T. Walsingham hist.Hen. c.5. That Seut or Ceuta (there written Sunt) was taken by the Portugals, through the assistance of English Merchants, An. 1415. Iulian, the Earle of Seut, brought the Mores first into Spaine, in the yeare of the Heg. 92. In it were many Temples, Colleges, and learned men. Errif begins at the Streits of Gibraltar, and stretcheth Eastward to the Riuer Nocor 140. miles. The Inhabitants are valiant, but are excessiue drinkers. Mezemme & Bedis, or Velles de Gumera, are chiefe Towns in it. On Mount Beni Ierso was built a faire College, & the Mahumetan law publikely taught therein: the inhabi∣tants therefore freed from all exactions. A tyrant destroyed this College, and slew the learned men. The bookes therein were valued worth foure thousand duckats. This was An. 1509. In Mount Beni Guazeual is a hole, that perpetually casteth vp fire; wood cast in, is suddenly consumed to ashes: some thinke it hell-mouth. In Mount Beni Mesgalda were maintained many Mahumetan Doctors, and Students, which would perswade the people to drink no wine, which themselues wil not abstaine from. Garet the sixth Shire of this Kingdome, lieth betweene the Riuers Melulo and Mul∣uia. The seuenth is Chauz, reputed the third part of the Kingdome, betweene the Ri∣uer Zha and Guruigara. Herein standeth Tezza, adorned with Colleges, Temples, and Pallaces. A little Riuer springing out of Atlas runs thorow the chiefe Temple, which is greater then that at Fez. There are three Colleges, and many Bathes and Hospitalls. Each trade dwells by themselues, as at Fez. I was acquainted (saith Leo) with an aged fire in this City, reputed a Saint, and enriched exceedingly with the peoples offerings. From Fez did the people resort to visit him with their offerings, which is fifty miles: he seemed to me to be a deceiuer. In Mount Beni Iesseten are many iron mines, and the women in great brauerie weare yron rings on their fingers and eares. Ham Lisnan was built by the Africans, and borrowed the name from the Fountaine of an Idoll, whose Temple was neare the Towne: to which at certaine times in the yeare resorted men and women in the night: where, after Sacrifices, the candles were put out, and each man lay with the woman he first touched. Those women were forbidden to lye with any other for a yeare after. The children begotten in this adulterie, were brought vp by Priests of the Temple. The Moores destroyed this Holy-Stewes, and the Towne, not leauing any mention thereof. In Mount Centopozzi are ancient buildings, and neare thereto a spacious Hole, or drye Pit, with many roomes therein: they let men downe into the same by Ropes with lights, which if they goe out
they perish in the pit. Therein are many Bats which strike out their lights. In the Mountaines of Ziz there are Serpents so tame, that at dinner time they will come like Dogs and Cats, and gather vp the crums, not offering to hurt any. Thus much of the Kingdome of Fez out of Leo, a learned Citizen of Fez, and great traueller, both in the places and Authors of Afrike: whom Ortelius. Maginus; Boterus follow, commen∣ded by Bodin. Me∣thod c.. Ant.Pess. de hist. Apparat. l.16. ser.7. c.2. Bodinus, Posseuinus, and others, as the most exact writer of those parts, and translated into English by Mr. Porie, from whom if I swarue in diuers things, impute it to the Italian Copie of Ramusius, which differeth not a little, especially in these things I haue here set downe, from the English. I thought good here also to adde out of others some such customes and rites as they obserue in Fez, and other parts of this Kingdome Historie of Barbarie. Ro.C. Their circumcision is vsed in their priuate houses. Women may not enter the Moschee for their often vncleannesse, and because Eue first sinued. The eight day after a child is borne the Parents send for a Ialby or Priest, and some old men and women, where after a few praiers said, the wo∣men wash the child all ouer with water, and giue the name, making a banker. But sometimes the circumcision is deferred diuers yeares after this ceremonie, as the Fa∣ther thinkes meete. Their fasts they obserue very strictly, not so much as tasting water till the Stars ap∣peare. Yea, diuers haue beene seene by their rigour in this superstition to faint, and some to die. A certaine More in the time of their Lent (which continueth thirtie daies) in the companie of an English Gentleman, being thirstie with heat and trauell, went to a conduit in Marocco (where the same religion is professed as in Fez) & there drin∣king, was so reuiled of the people, that in a desperate anguish he slew himselfe with his dagger. Yet doth their law allow an exchange some daies of this Lent, with other daies in the yeare following, if trauell then hinder. Their feasts and fasts are at the same times and in the same manner that the Turkes obserue, of which is before spoken. Their Ea∣ster they call Rumedan: their Whitsontide, Lidhiber: their Michaelmasse, Lashour: their Candlemasse, Lidshemaw: (if it bee lawfull thus to parallell those vaine superstitions with Christian obseruations.) In this last feast, which seemeth to be the same that Leo calls Mahomets birth-day, euery one must haue a candle for himselfe, and for euery Son in his house. The King hath that day candles carried to him, some like May-poles, other like Castles, six or eight men carrying one of them: so artificially composed, that some are in making six moneths. That night the King doth heare all the law read: the like is done in all other Churches. The Talby that cannot reade all their law in a night is held insufficient for his place. They goe (saith my Author) six times in foure and twentie houres, (which is once oftner then is written of the Turkes, except on their Sabbath) to their praiers, first washing themselues, as they doe also after the offices of nature, & after company with their wiues, thinking thereby to be washed from their sinnes. Their times of praier are, two houres afore day, the first: when the Monde, or sexten crieth in the steeple (as you may reade in our Turkish relations) & then may no man touch his wife, but prepare himselfe to pray (with washing or other deuotions) either in his owne house, or at Church. After their publike praiers the Talby sits downe and spends halfe an houre in resoluing the doubts of such as shall moue any questions in matters of their law. The second time of prayer is two houres after, when it is day. The third at noone. The fourth at foure of the clock in the afternoone. The fift at the twilight. The last, two houres after. In the first of these they pray for the day; in the second they giue thanks for it; in the third time they giue thanks for that it is halfe pas∣sed; in the fourth they desire the Sunne may well set on them; at twilight they giue thanks after their daily labours; the lasttime, they desire a good night. They thinke it vnseemly to eate meat with their left hands, and hold it vncleane, and doe all with their right hand. Their Sabbath or Friday is not exempted from worke: Only they are then more deuout in going to Church. Their Churches are not so faire generally as in Christendome, nor haue seats in them; ornaments, or bels: (only the floores are matted) they are also poore for the most part; as are their Church-men. Their Lyturgie is very short, not so long as the Pater oster and Creed: other set forme they haue not, but euery one praies after his owne pleasure. Although
the Moore may haue foure wiues, & as many Cōcubines as he can purchase, yet few marry foure, because the wiues friends will haue a sufficient bill of Dowrie for her maintenance, which none but rich men can performe: and againe, the wiues chal∣lenge his nights company, and that in course: if any be neglected, shee complaines to the Magistrate, and he forceth the husband to his dutie, or else to send her home with her Dower, and a bill of diuorce. The Concubines are embraced with more stolne pleasures. That bill of Dower holdeth the husband in awe, which else would make a slaue of his wife, or still change for yonger flesh. The Bride is bedded before her hus∣band see her: and if he find her not a Virgin, he may turne her home and keepe her por∣tion by law. For their funerall rites; when one is dead they presently wash him, & spee∣dily put him into ground (the heat so requiring) and after that, the women at conue∣nient times haue a custome to meet, & make memoriall of their deceassed friends with remembrance of their vertues, which they thinke causeth men to haue more respect to their good name. Their other obsequies are before declared. The King vseth to sit in iudgement on Fridayes in the afternoone: and the Musti sits with him at other times in iudgement: but on the Friday he sits alone by himselfe. Of these Mufties are three; one at Marocco; an other, at Fez; the third, at Taradant in Sus, an other part of this Se∣riffian Kingdome. Other Iudges sit all the yeare long two houres before noone, and as many after. Before these euery man pleads his owne cause: and if the witnesses can be proued to be infamous of life, or not to say their prayers six times a day, their testimo∣nie is disabled. The Scriuanos are Talbies, which assist the Iudge, and in his absence supply his place. The Fokers or Saints (Leo before calls them Heremites) dwell in the best places of the Country, keepe great hospitality for all trauellers, whither any man may come for a night, and be gone in the morning. They giue great example of mo∣rall liuing, and almes to the needie, comprimising matters of difference betwixt parties and repressing disorders. They are much loued and respected, and their houses are hol∣den sanctuaries, whose priuileges the King will not breake, but vpon waighty reasons. CHAP. XI. Of the Kingdome of Marocco, with a discourse of the Kings thereof, and of the Se∣riff, xarif, or Iarif, and his posteritie, now beginning in Barbarie. THis Kingdome is situate Boter.part.I.Maginus. betweene Atlas and the Atlantike Ocean, bearing name of the chiefe City thereof: fruitfull of corne, oile, grapes, sugar, honny, and cattell. They make fine cloth of Goats haire, and of their hides that lether Cordouan Jether of Ma∣rocco. which hence is called Marocchine. This King∣dome is diuided into seuen Prouinces, through which we intend our next perambulation, taking Leo Leo. part. 2. for our guide: beginning at Hea, which on the North and West hath the Ocean, Atlas on the South, and the Riuer E∣sisnual on the East. The people feede on cakes of Barly, and on a pappe, or hasty-pud∣ding of barly meale, which being set in a platter, all the Familie compasse about, and rudely with Natures spoones claw forth those dainties. Napery they vse none, a mat layed on the ground serueth for table and cloth, and stooles too. Cappes are the pri∣uileges of age and learning. Linnen shirts are almost banished their Countrie: and so are Arts liberall and mechanicall, except some simple Lawyer which can make some shift to reade, and a Surgeon to circumcise their children: Their physick is cauterising as men deale with beasts. They are alway in mutuall warres one with an other, yet will not they iniury a stranger, who if he would trauell amongst them, must take some harlot, or wife, or religious man, of the aduerse part with him. At Tednest, one of their Cities, such respect is had to strangers, That if a Merchant come thither and hath no acquaintance, the Gentlemen of the City cast lots who shall be his Host, and they vse him kindly, looking only for some present at his departure, in token of thankefull∣nesse. And if hee bee a meaner person, hee may choose his Host without any recom∣pence at all. In the midst of the City was a great & ancient Temple with many Priests attending their deuotions, besides other meaner Oratories. This City hath since beene ruined and desolate. In Teculeth were 1000. housholds, foure hospitals, one beautifull Temple, & a house of religious persons: destroied it was by the Portugals, An. 1514. as Hadecchis
had bin the year before. Ileusugaghen is another towne of Hea, or of Hell ra∣ther, so full is it of confusion, bloud, and murthers, besides the want of learning, ciuili∣tie Iudges, Priests, or whatsoeuer else may detaine those men from a beastly or diuelish∣Metamorphosis. The Seriff, being made a Prince of Hea, brought mee thither to be a Iudge, but for feare of Treason amongst them wee were glad to leaue them. How farre off in manners is their neere neighbour Tesegdelt? Where a guard is set at gates not so much to keepe out enemies, as to entertaine strangers, whom at his first comming they aske if hee haue any friends in the Citie: if not, they must pro∣uide him entertainment at free cost. They haue a most beautifull Temple, furnished with Priests. Taglesse, the next towne, is a denne of theeues and murtherers. When I was there, such a swarme of Locusts ouer-spread the Countrey, that scarse might a man see the earth, eating vp their fruits. Culeihat was built of a cetraine Sectary in our time, first a Preacher, attended with troupes of Disciples, after, a cruell and mercilesse tyrant, murthered at last by one of his wiues for lying with her Daughter: and then his villanies beeing manifested, the people put all his followers to the sword. Onely a Nephew of his fortified himselfe in a Castle, which hee held maugre all their might, and burying his Grand-father, taused him to be adored as a Saint. Homar Seijef was the name of that Rebell. The o∣ther parts of Hea are like the former, some exceeding Hospitall and courteous, some brutish without diuine or humane learning or liuing. Great store of Iewes liue here, and in Mount Demensera are of those Iewes which are called Karraini Scripture-Iewes. Carraum, of the rest accounted Sectaries. These reiect the Traditions, and hold them onely to the writ∣ten Scriptures (as in our Iewish relations yee haue read.) In Mount Gebelelhadih are many Heremites, which liue on fruits of Trees, and water, so reputed of the simple peo∣ple, that all their doings are accounted miracles. Sus is the second Region of this Kingdome, lying Southwards from hence on the other side of Atlas, so called of that Riuer which is the Easterne border thereof, other∣where bounded with the Sea and the Desarts. At Messa neere the Sea side is a Temple holden in great veneration. Many Historians affirme that from this Temple shall come that iust Califa, of whom Mahoet Prophecied. There also they say the Whale vo∣mited vp Ionas. The Rafters and beames of the Temple are of Whales bones; which vsually are there left dead on the Shore. This the common people esteeme to proceede from some diuinitie of that Temple: but the true cause is certaine sharpe Rockes a lit∣tle off in the Sea. I my selfe was inuited by a Gentleman, who shewed mee a Whales fibbe, so huge, that lying on the ground in manner of an Arche, vnder it, as it were through a gate, we rode on our Camels, our heads not reaching to touch it. It had been there kept a hundred yeares for a wonder. Amber is there found in abundance, which some thinke proceedes from the Whales, and is either the Ordure or the Sperme and feede thereof. Teijent is a Citie of Sus, wherein is a great Temple, and an Arme of a Riuer passeth through the same. There are many Iudges and Priests, whom in their Ec∣clesiasticall affaires they obey. Tarodant hath three thousand Families: sometimes the place where the Kings Lieutenant or Deputy resideth. Tedsi is much greater, adorned also with a Temple, and furnished with Priests and Ministers: Iudges and Lecturets paid at the common charge. In mount Hanchisa it snowes in all seasons of the yeare, and yet the inhabitants goe thinly clothed in the sharpest Winter. The Region of Marocco is three-square: confined with the mountaines Nefisa, on the West; and Hadimeus, on the East; betweene the Riuers Tensist, & Esifinuall. The coun∣trey in fertilitie of soile resembleth Lombardy. Marocco (which some thinke to be Bo∣canus Hemerus of Ptolomey) was built (saith Leo) by Ioseph sonne of Tessin, King of the people of Lontuna. It was built by the aduice of excellent Architects, & cunning work∣men. In the time of Hali sonne of Ioseph, there were in it ten thousand fires or Families, and more. It had foure and twenty gates: was strongly walled: furnished with Temples, Bathes. Colledges, Innes, after the African manner. One most slately temple was built by Hali, and called by his name. But a successor of that kingdome, called Abdul Mumen
caused to berazed, and built againe, and called after his owne name, howbeit the name of Hali is still continued in the Title, all that his cost not withstanding. This Abdul Mu∣men, who was the second that by rebellion succeeded in the kingdome, built an other Temple, which Mansor enlarged fiftie yards or ells on euery side, adorning it with many Pillars fetcht out of Spaine. He made a cisterne or vault built vnder it, as large as the temple it selfe; and couered the Temple with lead, with leaden pipes from the roofe, to conuey the raine water that fell thereon, into the cisterne. He built thereon a steeple like the Coliseo or Amphitheatre at Rome, of great hewen stone. The compasse of this steeple or tower is a hundred Tuscan yards or ells, higher then the steeple of Asenelli at Bononia. There are seuen losts one aboue another, very faire and light some. Vpon the toppe of this tower is built a little turret, the toppe whereof is as a needle or spire: and it containeth fiue and twenty yards in compasse, and is as high as two great launces, with three lofts therein, one higher then the other. On the toppe of this spire is a broch with three globes of siluer one vnder an other, the greatest below, and the least highest. From the toppe hereof the mountaines of Azafi may be easily seene, a hundred and thir∣cie miles off: and a tall man on the ground seemes as little as a child of a yeare old. The plaine country fifty miles about is hence discerned. It is one of the greatest Temples in the world; and yet not frequented, the people assembling thither to their deuotions, but on fridays: the city it selfe neare this Temple is ruinate, so that the passage is made diffi∣cult by the ruines of houses. Vnder the porch or gallery of this Temple were sometimes a hundred shops of Book-sellers, and as many ouer-against them, but now An. Dom. 1526 there is not one in all Morecco: Scarcely is the third part of the city inhabited: the rest being plan∣ted with vines & trees, the Arabians not suffering them to exercise any husbandry with∣out their walls. It was built anno 424. of the Hegeira. After Ioseph the Founder, & Hals his son, Abraham succeeded, in whose time, a rebellious preacher called Elmahels, borne and brought vp in the mountains, rebelled, & with an army incountred king Abraham, and ouerthrew him. The king fled, and was so hardly pursued by Abdul Mumen, whom Elmabels had sent after him, whiles himselfe be sieged Marocco, that the poore king in danger to be surprized at Oram, mounting on his horse, & taking his wife behinde him, set spurres to his horse, & so came all 3. downe together on the mercilesse rockes. Ab∣dul Mumen returning victorious, found this addition to his happines, that Elmabeli was dead, & himselfe was chosen King and Prelate (or Chalipha) by the forty disciples, & ten secretaries of Elmaheli, a new custome in the Mahumetan law. He maintained the siege, & at the yeres end, entred by force, and took Isaac, the litle and only son of Abraham, & stabd him with his own hands, killing most of the souldiers he there found, and many of the citizens. His posteritie reigned after him, from anno 516 of the Hegeir. to the 668. at which time the family of Marin depriued them, in which the kingdom continued til the 785 yere. Then the same decreasing in power, Marocco became subiect to certain lords of the old hill, neare to the city. But of none receiued they so much dammage, as of the Marin family, which held their court in Fez, & had a Lieutenant only in Marocco; Fez being made chiefe citie of Mauritania. Let me borrow of Cali. Sec. Cal Sec Curio de regno Mar. pag.356. Cario in his history of the kingdome of Marocco, which (for the most part) is taken out of Leo. He saith that Abdul Mumen subiected to his empire all Barbary, from Messa to Tripolis; his Empire in Africa comprehending 90 daies iourny in length, & 15 in bredth. He also possessed the kingdome of Granada in Spain, somtime called Betica, & from Tariffa to Tarracon, & a great part of Castilia & Portugall. Neither had he alone this large Empire, but his Leo reckons them in this Order. Abdul, Ioseph Mansor, Iacob Mansor, and this Ma∣homet Enasir: whereas Curio seemes to insinuate a longer line of posteritie: these being all, directly and immediatly succeeding. son Iasippus, after him, Iacobus Mansor his nephew, and their posterity, til Mahumet Enasir, who an 1212 in the kingdome of Valencia was ouerthrowne of Alphonsus (as I take it) the ninth king of Castil, in that place which is called Las navas ds Tolosa; loosing in the battell 60000 men. In memory of which battell and victorie, that Alphonsus adorned his Scutchion with a Castle Or, in a field purple: which custome his successours doe still obserue, because that day that golden Kingdome, as a strong Castle, confirmed to him by the bloud of his enemies, was deliuered from those miscreants: And thereup∣on that Kingdome of the Bastitanes (so it was before that time stiled) was intituled Castile. Moreouer, hee instituted that Knightly Order of Saint Iames, who haue in
their habite purtraied a purple sword, in token of bloud. This Mahumet our Historians call Miramulinus. For Abdul Mumen intituled himselfe Miralmumin, the name sig∣nifying, The Prince of beleeuers, which others corrupting call Miramulin, as they did him Abed Ramon. Howsoeuer it standeth for the name and armes of Castile; cer∣tainely Curio was not curious, nor carefull enough in adding, that this Abdul Mumen was in the time of Rodericus the Gottish King, about seuen hundred yeares after Christ, as also in his Saracenicall Historie he relateth, and we before haue obserued, seeing that Marocco was long after built, and diuers hundreths of yeares were interposed be∣twixt Rodericus, and this Abdul Mumen; Curio herein Curio, fault a∣iseth from conounding the Histories of Abea Kamon and Abdul Mu∣men, which li∣ued some Cen∣turies of yeers. after the for∣mer. differing not onely from Leo, is best guide in the rest of his Historie, but from himselfe, as will easily appeare to any that list to compare his Saracenicall Historie with the Marochian. I cannot omit that which Mathew Mat.Par.in Iohan p. 233. Paris hath written of Iohn King of England, about these times, and in his owne daies. He sent, saith he, Thomas Herdinton & Ra∣dulph Fitz Nicholas Knights, and Robert of London Clerke, to Admirall Murnselius, king of Marocco, Africa, and Spaine, whom they commonly call Miramumelius, to make offer vnto him of his Vassallage, and that he would not onely hold the Land of him with paiment of Tribute, but would also change his Religion, and accept the Mahumetan. The Embassadours hauing declared their message, the King (or Emire Elmumenin to call him rightly) shut vp the booke whereon they found him reading, and after a little deliberation thus answered. I was now reading a Greeke booke of a certaine wise man, and a Christian, called Paul, whose words and deeds well please me; this onely I like not, that he forsooke the Religion wherein he was borne, and vnconstantly embraced another: and the same I say of your Maister. GOD Almigh∣tie knowes that if I were without the Lawe and now to chuse, this aboue all other should be my choise. And then, by diuers questions enforming himselfe better of the state of the Kingdome and of the King, he grew into great passion and indignation a∣gainst the King, protesting that he thought him vnworthy to bee his confederate, and commanded the Embassadours neuer more to see his face. The Author heard Robert of London, one of those which were sent, relate these things. But to returne to our Marocchian buildings. In it is a great Castle, in the middes whereof is a faire Temple, and thereon a goodly Tower, and on the top of the same an iron broche, with three golden Globes weighing a hundred and thirtie thousand Barbary Ducats, in forme like those before mentioned. Diuers Kings haue gone about to take downe the same, but alway some strange misfortune hath befalne them, whereby they haue beene forced to leaue their attempt. Insomuch that it is holden a signe of ill lucke to take them from theuce. The vulgar conceit is, that some influence of the Planes is cause hereof. And also that shee that set them there, by Art Magicke inchanted certaine spirits to a perpetuall Station there for to guard them. The people indeede are the spirits which in our time kept the Kings fingers from them, who else would haue aduentured all those phantasied dangers to haue possessed himselfe of the golde for his warres against the Portugales. The Wife of King Mansor is reported to haue set them there as a Monument of her memory, ha∣uing sold her Iewels to purchase them. Adrianus In Theatt. vrbium. Romanus saith, that the Talofi, Numi∣dians, and all Barbary come to Marocco, to study and learne Grammer, Poetry, Astro∣logie, and the Lawes. There is also in the said Castle a Colledge for the receit of Stu∣dents, which hath thirtie Chambers, and beneath, a spacious Hall, where in old times Lectures were read: and all the Students had their expences allowed them, and rai∣ment once a yeare: and the Readers for their stipend had, some a hundred ducats, some two hundred, according to the qualitie of their profession. No man might be admitted into that Colledge which was not well instructed in the Principles of Artes. The excel∣lencie of the matter and workmanship might well detaine vs longer in the view therof, but that it is now rather become a Sepulcher of Sciences, then a Theater, there being not aboue fiue Students vnder a senselesse Professour, left in Leo's time, as the ghosts of those sometimes renowned numbers of Schollars. There were built also by Mansor, twelue stately pallaces in the said Castle, for his Guard, Officers, Armories, and other
purposes fitting both Mars and Venus. There were also goodly and spacious Gar∣dens, and also a Parke with many kindes of wilde beasts, as Giraffas, Lyons, Elephants, &c. There was a Leopard made of Marble, the spots not borrowed, but Natures han∣dy-worke. But alas, Deuouring Time, that swalloweth his owne off-spring, was not content to haue inglutted his insatiable paunch with the flesh of those beasts, and men, branded with Natures stampe of mortalitie; but euen those curious and costly stones are now become graue-stones to themselues prouoking the beholders at once to com∣passion and amazement; the Reliques of laborious Art still contending with Time, to restifie what greater excellence hath beene. The Garden is now become the Citie dung∣hill, the Librarie in steede of bookes is furnished with nests of Doues, & other fowles. That ouerthrow which Mahomet the King of Marocco receiued in Spaine, was the oc∣casion of the ruine of that Family, which was furthered by his death, leauing behind him ten sonnes which contended amongst themselues for the Kingdome, and slew one an∣other. Hrevpon the people of Marin, entred into Fez, and possessed themselues of that Kingdome: the Habduluad Nation seised on the Kingdome of Telensin, and remouing the Gouernor of Tunis made whom they pleased King. After the ruine of Mansors pro∣geny, the Kingdome was translated to Iacob, son to Habdulach, first King of the Ma∣rin Family. Lastly, this Kingdome declining, the Arabians by continuall outrages haue further distressed it, forcing the people to what pleased them. Thus farre Leo: who saw not the influence of a Starre, euen in his daies, in his eyes, and of his acquaintance, ari∣sing, which after in his exaltation brought a new alteration to Marocco, and all those parts of Barbary. I meane the Seriffo, a name vsually giuen vnto such as professe them∣selues descended of Mahomets kindred, from whence also this we speake of deriued his Pedegree. The History I thinke heere worthy to bee inserted: the rather because this Westerne starre is now declining, and by his fierie gleames, seemes to bee neere his set∣ting. And thus in effect doth Boterus G.B.B. parte 2.l.2. out of whom aister Pory and the Description of the world hath translated the same. relate the same. About the yeare 1508, began to grow in name, through Numidia, a certain Alfaique, borne in Tigumedet in the Prouince of Dara, being a subtle man, and no lesse ambitious in mind, then learned in those Sciences, whereunto the Mahumetans are most addicted. He, by confidence of his bloud (descended of their Prophet) and of the diuisions of the States of Africa, & the exploites there daily atchieued by the Portugales, attempted to make himself Lord of Mauritania Tingitana. For this cause he sent his three sons Abdel, Abnet & Mah. to visit the sepulcher of Mahomet. Much was the reuerence, & reputa∣tion of holines, which they hereby acquired amongst that superstitious people, which now beheld them as saints, and kissed their garments as most holy reliques. These failed not in their parts of the play to act as much deuotion, as high contemplatiue lookes, deep-fetched sighs, & other passionate interiections of holines could expresse. Ala, Ala, was their yernfull noe, their foode was the peoples almes. The old Father ioying to see his proiects thus farre proceede, and minding to strike whiles the Iron was hote, sent two of them to Fez; Amet, and Mahumet: where one of them was made Reader in the Amodoracia, the most famous Colledge of Fez, and the yonger was made Tutor to the Kings yong sonnes. Aduanced thus in fauour of the King and People, by their fathers aduise, they apprehended the present Occasion of the harmes sustained by the Arabians and Mores vnder the Portugales Ensignes: they demanded licence of the King to display a Banner against the Christians, putting him in hope easily to draw those Mores to him, and so to secure the Prouinces of Marocco. In vaine were Mulley Nazer the Kings brother his allegations, not to arme this Name of Sanctitie, which being once victorious might grow insolent, and forget dutie in minding a Kingdome. They obtaine their desires, and with a Drum and Banner, with Letters of commenda∣tions to the Arabians, and people of Barbary, they are so attended with forces and for∣tunes, that Ducala, and all as farre as Cape de Guer stoupes to their command: the peo∣ple willingly yeelding their Tents to this Holy warre against the Portugales, enemies of their faith. Herevnto was added the ouerthrow which they gaue to Lopes Barriga, a famous Portugall Captaine, the brightnes of that sun-shine being somewhat ecclipsed with the losse of their elder brother, if rather a Monarchy were not hereby furthered. By
faire words they entered into Marocco, & there poisoned the King, causing Amet Serisso to be proclaimed in his steede, King of Marocco. The Arabians of Ducala and Xarqua, about this time trying their quarrels by dint of sword in mutuall conflicts, presented as it occasion to the Seriffs, to prey vpon them both; their strength hauing made them weake, and their weakenes making the other strong. And now did they begin to vsurpe souereinty, presenting their Fessan King, with six Horses, and six Camels, and those but simple, whom before they had acknowledged their Soueraigne, with paiment of the if fifths of their spoile. The King of Fesse before applauding his owne victories in theirs, began now to distast, and to distrust: he sends to them to demaund his fifths, and the tri∣bute also formerly paid him by the King of Marocco. Death, the cōmon enemy of man∣kinde, here interposed her selfe on the Seriffian part, and tooke the King of Fez out of the world; the Scepter descending to his son Amet, the scholler of the yong Seriff: who not onely proceeded not in his fathers demaunds, but confirmed Amet in the Signio∣rie of Marocco, so that in some small matters he would acknowledge the souereintie of Fez. But now the Seriffs, whose harts continually encreased with their fortunes, sent him word; that being lawfull successors to Mahomet, they owed no man tribute, & had more right in Africa then he: if hee would respect them as his Friends and Allies, so it were, it otherwise, they which had power to offend the Christian, should not be desti∣tute in defending themselues. The sword; the vnequallest arbiter of equity, is now made vmpire; the Fess in proclaimeth warres, besiegeth Marocco, is dislodged, and in his re∣turne vanquished. Thus haue the Seriffs acquited themselues of that yoke, and now in∣tend new conquests on the other side of Atlas, and in Numidia, and in the mountaines, which happily they archieued. Yea, the Portugales wearied with the warres, which they were forced to maintaine in defence of those places they held in Africa (the expences so much u mounting the reuenue) abandoned them to the Seriffs. And now the want of enemies procured enmitie betwixt the brethren, who trying that valour against each o∣ther, which before they had exercised iointly against their enemies, the issue was, that the yonger, in two battels hauing ouercome the elder, and at the second, which was Anno 1544, hauing taken him prisoner, confined him to Tafilete. Hee now sole Monarch of Marocco, conuerts his forces against the King of Fez, to try if he could be his Mr. in the field, as he sometimes had been in the schoole, and failed not of his attempt, but hauing once taken and freed him, the second time because he had broken promise, he depriued him and his sonnes of estate The end of the Reigne of Marins. and life. He also by meanes of his sonnes tooke Tremizen, which soone after was recouered from them by Sal Araes Vice-roy of Algier, and Fez also added, by an ouerthrow of the Seriff, to the Turks conquest, who gaue the gouern∣ment: of Fez to Buasson, Prince of Veles. But he in an vnfortunate battel with the Seriff, lost his life & state. Mahomet going after to Taradant, was by the way slaine in his Paui∣lion, by the Treason of some Turkes suborned therunto by the King of Algier, of whom all (but fiue) in their returne were slaine by the people: Anno 1559. Mulley Abdala, the the Seriffs sonne, was proclaimed King. Some R.C. his Hi∣story of Barba∣ry. Capit.1. write that by occasion of a rebellion in Sus, he sent to the bordering Turks for aide, who first helped, after murthered him, and hauing sacked Taradant, and ouerrunne the countrey two monethes together, were in their returne by the Mountainers cut off. Mully Abdala hauing reigned fifteene yeares died, leauing behinde him thirteene sonnes; the eldest, Abdela, commanded the rest to be killed: but Abdelmelech the se∣cond brother escaped into The Turkes fingers haue iched to be dealing with these parts, euer since So∣limans time: Nic.Honiger: and haue ther∣fore willingly entertained all occasions to effect their am∣bitious de∣signes. Turkie, and Muley Hamet, the third brother, esteemed of a simple and quiet spirit, not any way dangerous to the state, was spared. The other ten were put to death in one day at Taradant, where they had been brought vp. This Ab∣dela dying, left behinde him three sonnes; Muley Mahomet, Muley Sheck, Muley Nassar: the two yonger escaped into Spaine, where Sheck is yet liuing, & turned Chri∣stian. Nassar returned in the fourteenth yeare of Muley Hamets raigne, and had al∣most driuen Muley Sheck, then Gouernour of Fez vnder his Father, to his heeles, had not superstition more preuailed with Nassars followers, then Allegeance. For when Lent came, his Souldiours would needes home to keepe their Easter at their owne hou∣ses: for feare wherof Nassar hastily giuing battell, was there slaine. Abdelmelech before
fled into Turkie, now came back with Turkish forces, & got the Kingdome from Maho∣met who sleeing, or as others write, sending for succour to Sebastian King of Portugall, obtained it.

On the fourth day of August, they ioined battell, and the Duke of Auero, with his Portugals, made a great impression into the Mores host, which Abdelmelech labouring beyond his naturall force to withstand, saued his people, but lost his life, not by the sword of the enemie, but by the weakenes of his body deliuered vp to death. His brother Hamet ruled the Armie (as yet ignorant of what had befalne) and made such slaughter of the Portugales that the Duke of Auero, the King of Portugall, and other great Personages there fell, and Mahomet himselfe was drowned, in fleeing ouer a Riuer. Thus remained Hamet, victorious, and at one time had the dead corpses of three Kings in his Tent. Such is the fury of warre, the force of death trampling vn∣der foote the meanest, and triumphing ouer the greatest.

He gouerned the Alarbes (which are the inhabitants of the plaine and Champaine Countreys of Marocco, Fez, and Sus) in peace & subiection receiuing their tenths duely paide. The Brebers or Mountainers, a people of another language and disposition, he could not so easily came, & therefore in policie he drew them into forreine expeditions, especially against the Negros, there∣by extending his Empire so far that way, as by Camell it was six moneths ionrney from Marocco, to the extramest bounds. Likewise he vsed them to goe with the Carauan is a company of merchants go∣ing together with their goods & beasts Carauans to Gago to fetch home his yearely Tribute. He conquered Tombuto and Gago, about the yeare 1594. as appeareth by the letters of Madot. Hack∣luyt. Laurence Madoc, who saw thirty mules laden with gold come from thence to Marocco, & saith that Tombuto rented threescore quintals of gold. His prouisions for his Iugenewes or Sugar-gardens, for his buildings, maintenance of his women (rather for the pompe then the sinne) I let passe. For passed they are now and gone, together with himselfe, his three sonnes, by ciuill warres, lea∣uing scarfe hope of good, or place for worse estate then is now in Barbary, and hath beene these many yeares. His sonnes were Mahomet, commonly called Sheck, a title proper to the Kings eldest sonne. Boferes was his brother by the whole bloud: Sidan, by another woman; as were, Nassar & Abdela. Muley is a title of honour, giuen to the Kings children, & all of the bloud Royall. Muley Sheck was made gouernour of Fez in his fathers life time; Boferes, of Sus; & Sidan, of Tedula, in the mid way beweene Fex and Marocco. Muley Sheck so displeased his Father by his vnbridled courses, that
he went with an Armie to Fez to displace him, and to set things there in order, lea∣uing Boferes (lately returned from Sus, because of the Plague) in the gouernment of Marocco. Sheck tooke Sanctuarie with fiue hundred of his best Souldiours, from whence his father caused him to be brought by force, and sent him prisoner to Mic∣kanes: but before hee could finish his purposes, the 14. of August, 1603. hee died. Sidan had followed his father in this expedition, and taking aduantage of his pre∣sence, seised on the treasures, and proclaimed himselfe King of Barbary, and heire to his Father. What Sidan had done at Fez, the like did Boferes, at Marocco, and at Taradant. Nassar made some stirres, but soone after died of the Pague. Boferes sendeth Basha Iudar to encounter with Sidan, who was now come with his forces a∣gainst him, and because himselfe had not the heart, to hazard his person in battell, kno∣wing that it would be no small discouragement, if there were none his equall in bloud, he on certaine conditions, freed his elder brother Muley Sheck, who the sixt of Ia∣nuary, 1604. chased Sidan out of the field. Hence all old quarrels, and seuds, and rob∣beries, and a world of other mischiefes now Of these warres and the Genealogie of this Seriffian Family, See Laur. Bayer∣lincki opus Chron. 10.2.in Ana. 1603. began to fill all the parts of Barbary. Muley Sheck in Fez proclaimes himselfe King. Thus is all inuerted, many Kings, and few Subiects: none now in this vncertainty paying their accustomed tenths, inten∣ding rather mutuall feuds and battels, betwixt their seuerall Tribes and kindreds, then common fidelitie and allegiance. Sidan by aide of the great Foquere, or Heremite, ob∣taineth Sus, the people yeelding obedience to none but whom that Religious person shall appoint them: by meanes of him also, a peace was concluded betwixt Boferes, and Sidan in August. 1604. Thus was the Warre continued betweene Sheck and Bofe∣res. Abdela, Shecks sonne, driueth Boferes out of Marocco, in the latter end of the yeare: 1606. vsing his victorie with bloudy crueltie, besides the rifling and pillage of the goods in the citie. Bloud is a slippery fundation, & pillage a pill'd wall: so fell it out to Abdela, who soone lost the citie to Sidan, which hee had taken from Boferes, after a bloudy field fought betwixt them in Aprill after. Here Sidan puts to the sword 3000. Fessans, which had taken sanctuary, and came forth disarmed, vpon promise of pardon, which Boferes after with like persidiousnes, and breach of promise requited on 3000. Marochians. The Shracies (which are mountainers, neere to Algier, but no more re∣specting the Turkes there, then the Brebers doe the Serif) fell at variance, and began to mutiny in the Armie of Sidan, whom they serued and cut off the Bashas head, who was their Generall, which caused Sidan to execute vniust cruelties against all of that Tribe in Marocco giuing the Shracees goods to the murtherer whomsoeuer. On the six and twentith of Nouember, 1607. Abdela ioineth in battell with Sidan, prouoked by those Shracees who thirsted for reuenge of Sidans Tyrannies, where many English, vnder Captaine Gisfard, and other Captaines, were slaine, Sidan chased, and Marocco recouered. But whiles these brethren contend, Muley Hamet Bosonne their Cousin, rich in reasure, richer in hopes, thought it fit time to take vp that kingdome, which these with warring for it, lost. Hee gathering together whatsoeuer forces he could make, came to∣wards Marocco: Abdela heard and feared, and hauing spied a man vpon a Hill with a speare in his hand, with white linen like a flagge vpon it: his feare (an vntrustie mes∣senger) told him, that all Bosonnes Armie was behinde the Hill, (although it were then a full daies March from thence) and lent him wings to flie to Fez. The man was but a silly More, which had washed his linnen, and dried it on his speare point. Bo∣sonne entreth Marocco, and proclaimes himselfe King, but looseth both Citie and Kingdome in Aprill following, 1608. and after a second ouerthrow receiued by Sidan now Maister of Marocco, he was by Alkeid Azus his meanes poisoned. Muley Sheck loth to leaue Marocco to Sidan, sendeth Etina an Italian Marchant into Spaine, with promise, to the Catholike King, of Allaroche, Saly, Alcasar, and other townes to turne Spanish, if he would helpe him to his right in Afrike. This Negotiation was well entertained, and the Spaniard (they say) now hath Allaroche; the cause that hee which now hath obtained the State will not be called King, till he hath regained it. For the opening of this (I suppose you are weary of those vnnaturall and bloudy spectales
which this History presents vnto you, and therefore I hast) you must now conceiue that according to the report of such as came lately from thence, Boferis is dead, Muley Sheck shiftes for himselfe where he can, Abdela rules in Fez, and Sidan hath lately lost Marocco. The historie, or (if you will) the Mores report of the present state, as by a friend of mine lately come from thence I am giuen to vnderstand, is this. A certaine Foquere, Heremite, or Saint, (names giuen by diuers to the same) called Habet Ben Abdela, liued in the mountaines of Atlas, where sometime he entertained Sidan to his great content, fleeing then to his The Mores call their pro∣tection or de∣fence, a horne, as is vsuall in the scriptures. borne or defence, in time of distresse. This man the Mores report to be a great Magician, that hee could feede three hundred Horse at one pit of Barly, and the same no whit diminished, that he foretold of plenty the last yeare, which came accordingly to passe, that he could by his Art secure men from the danger of Gun-shot. If any beleeue not these things, yet let him beleeue that the credulous and superstitions More (which easily conceiueth and receiueth any thing but truth) be∣leeueth it, and then it belongeth to our discourse, who rather attend what they doe beleeue, then what they should. This is that they tell, that Hamet Ben Abdala, being in great reputation for wealth, learning, and holinesse, gathered a band of men, and conducted them this last spring to Marocco. He challenged not the Kingdome to him∣selfe, but said that the first of the Family of the Xerisfe had done well, though hee vsur∣ped, but his posteritie had broken the kingdome, and God was not pleased with them. (This is the opinion of that Religion, to measure Gods approbation of things by the e∣uent and successe.) He further alledged a certaine prophecie of the reigne of one Alle. This they say is his sonne, or some other which hee carrieth with him. For hee hath two tents, the one white, wherein himselfe lodgeth: the other red, wherein abi∣deth (they say) one which they suppose shall bee their King, whom they neuer see. Sidan with an Armie of sixteene thousand, giues him battell at Marocco, the 5. of Iune, this present yeare, 1612. and was ouerthrowne. For hee went him∣selfe, and ledde his company on the mouth of the ordinance without harme: hee cau∣sing (as the Mores report) that the Bullets should still remaine in the peeces when they were discharged, as he had often for the confirmation of his people made triall before, setting fortie Gunners to shoote at as many others without harme, by the like Art. Thus he lost none of his owne, & many of the other were slaine. Sidan fled to Sali, & embarkes his two hundred women in a Flemming; his riches, in a Marsilian: this was taken by Don Luys, the Spanish Admirall, wherein were thirteene Chests of Gold: the other at S.ta Cruz, met Sidan, and deliuered him his women. Men were more necessary, which he wanted, and yet (worse then their want) some offered their seruice for pay, and re∣ceiuing it, forsooke him, whereby he was forced to flee into the Mountaines, where he is said yet to remaine. Hamet, now called Mully Side Hamet Ben Abdala, placed a, Gouernour in Marocco, another at Taradant, the chiefe Gitie of Sus. His march was in great hypocrisie (I may rather call it then simplicitie) in a Straw Hat, and a patched garment, while crowne and Robes imperiall are the markes he shootes at. And so we leaue him, and these relations to your censure. We must forward on our Pilgrimage, we haue sufficiently filled our eyes with bloud in this Barbarian Tragedie. Now let vs take more quiet view of the other parts of this kingdome. Agmet was sometimes called a second Marocco, l.eo l.2. from whence it standeth foure and twenty miles. The hilles and valley about it, adorned with Gardens and Vineyards, a faire Riuer, and fertile fields, yeelding fiftie-fold increase, haue assem∣bled Natures forces to ioyne with Art, (if Magike may be so termed, and the Histo∣ries write true) for the common good of Agmet, and Marocco. The Riuer runneth (as is thought) to Marocco vnder the ground; which secret passage is attributed to the wizards of Ioseph, founder of Marocco, left the vvater-course should bee cutt off from the Citie. This fruitfull Agmet in Leo's time was peopled onely with Foxes and wilde beastes, sauing that a certaine Heremite held the Casdtle, with a hundred of his Disciples. The The Moun∣taines of Ma∣rocco. mountaines are very rude, according to their rough and cold places of habita∣tion, many of them couered continually with snow. In Nififa they gaze and wonder at
strangers: in Seme they forced Leo to play the Iudge and Notarie (accepting no ex∣cuse) eight dayes: and then set him in a Church-porch, and after a certaine prayer, pre∣sented themselues with their presents before him, cocks, hennes, nuts, garlike; and some of the better sort, a goat, which all he gaue to his host: money they had none for him. In Secsiua there is at all times of the yeare, snow. There are many great Caues wherein they winter their beasts, in Nouember, Ianuary and February. They weare no shooes, but certaine sandals, and are lusty men, at ninety or a hundred yeares old: Temnelia is an hereticall Hill and Towne, which hath a faire Temple. They are of Elmaheli his Sect, and challenge any stranger which comes amongst them to dispute. In Hantera are many Iewes of the Carraim Iewes. Carraim Sect. The fourth Region of this kingdome is Guzzula, confining with the hill Ida on the West, Atlas on the North, Hea on the East. They haue no walled Townes, but great Villages: neither haue they King or Gouernor; the cause of ciuil warres amongst them: yet doe they obserue three dayes in a weeke truce, when euery man may trauell or bar∣ter safely. A certaine Heremite, who was reputed a Saint, was Author of this three dayes truce in each weeke. He had but one eye. I my selfe, saith Leo, saw him and found him to be trusly, curteous, and liberall. Duccaia the fifth Region lieth betweene Tensift and the Ocean, Habid and Omira∣bih. At Azaph the Prince was (in Leo's time) murthered at Church, whiles he was in his Deuotions, by a subiect, who was chosen Gouernour; but the Portugals obtained the place. Az, a citie excedingly addicted to Sodomie, was also punished with Por∣tugall slauery, and most of the Country thereabouts. In the hill called Greene-hill liue many Heremites, of the fruits onely there growing. Here are many Altars and Saints af∣ter the Mahumetan fashion. Mahumet King of Fez, in the yere of our Lord 1512, pas∣sed this way with his armie, and at euery Altar made a stand, and there kneeling, would thus say: My God, thou knowest that my intent of comming to this wilde place, is on∣ly to help and free the people of Duccala from the wicked and rebellious Arabians, and from our cruell enemies the Christians: and if thou dost not approue it, let thy scourge light onely on my person: for these people that follow me deserue not to bee punished. Hence he sent me Ambassador to Marocco. Hascora the sixt region of Marocco is situate betweene the riuer Tensift and Quadel∣habid. Aledin in Hascora was conquered to the King of Fez by a merchant, whose pa∣ramour the Prince had taken away; for which adultery he was by the Iudges condem∣ned to be stoned. The Prince of Temcenes was so addicted to Arabian Poetry, that he gaue Leo, then a youth of sixteene yeares olde, fiftie ducats for certaine verses hee had made in his praie, and twice as much he sent to his vncle for the same cause, with a horse and three slaues. Tedles is the seuenth Prouince of this Kingdome, lying betweene Guadelhabid and Ommirabih. Tefza the chiefe towne is beautified with many Temples, and hath store of Priests. The towne-walls are built of a kind of marble called Tefza, which gaue name to the towne. Mount Dedes is in this Prouince, where the people (for the mo pat) dwell in Caues vnder the ground: they haue neither Iudges nor Priests, nor honest men among them. For other places, if any thinke vs not more than tedious alreadie, let them resort to Leo, whom all follow in their relations of these parts. CHAP. XII. Of the Arabians and naturall Africans; and of the beginnings and procee∣dings of the Mahumetan superstition in Africa: of the Portu∣galles forces and exploits therein. HAuing often mentioned the Arabians in our former Chapters, it seemes fit to speake somewhat of the comming of that Nation, and their religion, into Africa from the East, as also of the Armes of the Portugalls (before often spoken of) which frō the West haue made some impressions in these parts.

Omar inuaded Egypt, and Odman in the yeare 650. passed further with fourescore thousand fighting men, and defeated Gregorius Patricius, and imposing a tribute on the Africans departed. In Leontius time, in the yeare 698. They inuade and possesse Africa, and appoint Gouernors of their owne: in the yere 710. they pierced into Numidia and Libya, and ouerthrew the Azanaghi, and the people of Gala∣ta, Oen and Tombuto. In 973, hauing passed Gamben, they infected the Negros, and the first that dranke of their poison, were those of Melli. In the yere 1067. Iaiata sonne of Ababequer entred into the lower Ethiopia, and by little and little infected those peo∣ple which confine vpon the desarts of Libya and the rest, and pierced vnto Nubia and Guinea. Constantinus the Emperour Const.Po phy∣rogenities de ad∣minister.imperio. ex Theophanis historia ca.25. among the Prouinces or great Amera-shippes subiect to the Saracens, numbreth Africa for one: the number and order whereof he hath tran∣scribed from Theophanes, and I heere from him. The first of these was Persia or Cho∣rost; the second, Egypt; the third, Africa; the fourth, Philistiem or Rhamble; the fift, Damascus; the sixt, Chemps or Emessa; the seuenth, Chalep; the eight, Antiochia; the ninth, Charan; the tenth, Emet; the eleuenth, Esipe; the twelfth, Musel; the thir∣teenth, Ticrit. But when as Africa shooke off the yoke of the Ameras of Bagdad, and had an Amera of her owne, afterwards by occasion of the weakenesse of the Amera of Bagdad, the Amera of Persia or Chorasan freed himselfe also, and called himselfe Ame∣rumnes, wearing the Alcoran hanging downe his necke in Tables like a chaine, and saith he is of the kindred of Alem: and the Amera of Egypt (to whom the Amera of A∣rabia Faelix, had alway beene subiect, became also his owne man, calling himselfe Ame∣rumnes, and deriuing his pedigree from Alem. This as it giues light to the Saracen Hi∣storie in generall, so it sheweth the greatnesse of the Arabian or Saracenicall power in Africa, where first they made head against their maisters, in the time as is said before of Elagleb then Deputy or Amera in Cairaoan, whose example became a president to the Amera's of Persia and Egypt: & (which is more to our present purpose) was occasion of further spreading their superstition through Africa; the fountaine or sinke thereof being nw not farre off in Damasco or Bagdad, but in the heart of Africa, Satan there chusing his Throne for these his Vicars, or Chalipha's (for so the word saith Scal. Can. .li.3. Cha∣lipha est Vicari∣us, quonomine  qui  M   sunt, qui & duna's & bonomis . Scaliger signifieth) which as you haue heard, were too faithfull in that their infidelitie. And because I haue mentioned Scaligers interpretation of the word Chalpha, it should not bee amisse to adde out of the same place, that the first Gouernors or Generalls after Mahumet (or as he calles him, Muhammed) were called Emirelmumenin, that is, Captaines of the Orthodox or right Beleeuers. Afterwards, because vnder colour of Religion, they sought, not onelie of Priestly Primacie, but a tyrannicall Monarchie, they chose ra∣ther to be called Chalipha. The first Emirelmumenin was Abubecher. When his succes∣sours sent their Lieutenants into Africa and Spaine, they gouerned a while vnder them, doing all in the name of the Emirelmumenin, although nothing in a manner but a Ti∣tle was wanting of the fulnesse of power to themselues. But after, they entituled them∣selues Emire Elmumenin, and of Deputies became Kings: which was done by the pe∣tite Kings of Spaine, and the Gouernours of Africa. And now the King of Marocco and Fesse vseth it. For it is not a proper name, but as the French King is called Chri∣stianisimus, and the Spanish Catholicus. Thus farre Scaliger: which serueth as a glosse for those former names of Amera, Amerumnes, Chalipha, Miramuldinus, and many o∣ther hence corrupted. The meanes of these and other Saracens enlarging their Sect haue beene principal∣ly by Armes; and where they were not of force, by trafficke and preaching, About 200. yeares after the death of Mahamet, all Barbarie was infected with that pestilēce. Leo.lib.1. as on the other side of Ethiopia, eue to Cabo de los Corientes in the kingdomes of Magadazo, Me∣linde, Mombazza, Quiloa, and Mosambique, besides the Ilands of Saint Laurence, and others. But the greatest mischiefe that happened to Africa, by the Arabians, was about the soure hundreth yeare of the Hegeira. For before that time, the Mahumetan Chali∣pha's, or Amera's, had forbidden the Arabians to passe ouer Nilus with their tents and families, that so the Countrey was still peopled by the auncient Inhabitants, howsoe∣uer
it were gouerned by them. For such multitudes of vnbrideled & barbarous nations were not likely to proue dutifull subiects to the Empire. About that time, eone Elcain the schismaticall Chalisa of Cairaoan, as is before in part shewed, hauing by his Generall Gehoar conquered all the Westerne parts, as farre as Sus, employed the same mans va∣lour for the conquest of the East. And Egypt being now together with Syria subdewed; Elcain himselfe seeing the Chalipha of Bagdet, made no preparation to withstand him, by the aduice of Gehoar, (which at that time sounded Cairo) passed into Egypt, thin∣king to inuest himselfe with the Saracenicall soueraignetie, committing the gouerne∣ment of Barbary to a Prince of the tribe Zanhagia, who in this absence of his Lord compacted with the Chalipha of Bagdet, and acknowledged his Title in Barbarie, re∣ceiuing in reward of his treason from that Bagdet Prelate the kingdome of Africa. El∣cain hauing lost his morsell, to snatch at a shadow, was in great perplexitie what course to take, tilla Counsellor of his perswaded him that hee might gather great summes of gold, if he would let the Arabians haue free liberty to passe through Egypt into Africa: which, though he knew, that they would so waste it by their spoiles as it should remaine vnprofitable, both to himselfe; and his enemies, yet incited by two vehement Orators, Couetousnesand Reuenge, at last he granted. And permitted all Arabians, which would pay him ducats a peece, freely to passe, receiuing their promise, that they would becom deadly enemies to the Rebel of Cairaoan. Whereupon tenne Tribes or Kindreds of the Arabians (halfe the people of Arabia deserta) and a multitude also out of Arabia Faelix (as writeth Ibnu Rachu a famous Historian, out of whom Leo hath drawne a great part of his African Historie) accepted the condition, and passing the Desarts, they tooke Tripolis, sacked Capes, and after eight moneths siege, entred into Cairaoan, filling with bloud, and emptying with spoile, all the places where they preuailed. Thus did these kindreds of Arabians settle themselues in these partes, and forced the Prouinces adiacent to tribute: and remayned Lords of Africa till Ioseph founded Marocco, who aided the posteritie of the Rebell against them, and brake their yoke from the Cities tri∣butary. But Mansor the fourth King and Chalipha of the Sect of Muoachedin, begunne, as is said, by Elmahels and Abdul Mumen, preferred the Arabians, and induced them to make warre vpon those their enemies, whom easily they conquered. He also brought all the chiefe and principall of the Arabians into the Westerne Kingdomes, and assig∣ned them more noble places for habitation, to wit, the Prouinces of Duccala and Az∣gar: to those of meane condition he appoynted Numidia, which at first were, as it were, slaues to the Numidians, but after recouered their liberty, and obtained the dominion of that part of Numidia assigned them, euery day encreasing in power. Those which inhabited Azgara and other places in Mauritania, were all brought into seruitude. For the Arabians out of the Desarts, are as Fishes out of the Water. Atlas on the one side, and the other Arabians on the other side, suffered them not to passe into the De∣sarts, and therefore they laied downe their pride, and applyed themselues to husban∣drie, dwelling in their tents, and paying yeerely tributes to the Kings of Mauritania, from which those of Duccala, by reason of their multitudes were free. Many Arabi∣ans remayned still in Tunis, which, after Mansors death, they tooke and made them∣selues Lords of the Regions adioyning: where some of them bare great sway till Leo's time: the other depriued of their wonted pay at Tunis, committed great robberies and slaughters of merchants and trauellers. The Arabians, which inhabited Africa, are diuided into three Peoples, Hilet, and Cachin, which are said to descend of Ismael, therefore by the Mahumetans esteemed more noble: the third is termed Machill, deriued from Saba, and came thithet out of Arabia Faelix. The diuisions and subdiuisions of these into their seuerall Tribes and Families, which Leo hath done, would perhappes to our nicer Readers seeme but an harsh heape of strange names, and for their sakes I wil referre the studious hereof to that our Author. The Tribe Etheg, which Manser placed in Duccala, and in the Plaines of Tedles,
in later times suffered much damage by the Portugalles on the one side, and the Kings of Fez on the other: they are about one hundred thousand men of warre, halfe horse∣men. The Sumaites in the Desarts neare Tripolis can arme foure score thousand men: Sahid in the Desarts of Libya, can bring into the field almost an hundred and fiftie thousand of their Tribe. The Ruche are not rich, but in agilitie of body miraculous, and account it a shame if one of their footmen be vanquished of two horsemen: nor is any amongst them so slow that hee will not outgoe any the swiftest horse, be the iour∣ney neuer so long. The Vode dwell betweene Gualata and Guadin, and are esteemed about three score thousand warriours. The other kindreds of them are exceeding ma∣ny, dispersed through Africa, some-where commaunding, other-where subiect. And as they liue in diuers places, so doe they obserue differing customes. Those which doe dwell betweene Numidia and Libya liue miserably: they make merchandise of their Cameils with the Negros, and haue many horses in Europe, termed horses of Barba∣rie. They are much addicted to Poetrie, and make long Poems of their warres, hun∣tings, and loes, with great elegance, and that in rithme, like the vulgar Italian Son∣nets. They are (the destiny of Poets) curteous, but poore. The Arabian Inhabitants be∣tweene Atlas and the Sea, are more rich in corne and cattell, but more base & barbarous in conditions. Amongst the Arabians neere Tunis, a good Poet is highly esteemed, and amply rewarded of their great men, neither can the neatnes and grace of their verse easi∣ly be expressed. When they goe to war, they carry their wiues with them on camels, and that (to make vp the wonder) to incourage them. The Arabians betweene Barbary and Egypt leade a wretched life in those barren desarts, forced, not onely to exchange their cattell for corne, but to pawne their sons in great numbers to the Sicilians, who if they breake day, make slaues of them: and therefore they exercise all robberies, and sell any stranger (they can lay hold on) to the Sicilians for corne. Now for the naturall and natiue Inhabitants of Africa, the white men (so they are in comparison of the Negros) are diuided into fiue peoples, Sanhagia, Musmuda, Zeneta, Haoara, and Gumera. The Musmuda inhabite the regions of Hea, Sus, Guzula, and Marocco. Gumera inhabiteth the mountaines alongest the Mediterranean, from the Streits to Tremizen. These two dwelseuered from the others, and maintaine continuall warres one with another. As Authors say, they were wont to haue tents, and the wide fields for their habitation, and those that were conquered, were sent to inhabite Cities, the Conquerours were Lords of the fields. The Tribes or Peoples Zeneta, Haoara, and Sanhagia, inhabite Temesne. The Zeneti chased the family of Idris from the dominion of Africa and Fez: and were againe themselues, after that, depriued by the Sanhagian families of Luntuna, and of Abdul Mumen. The Benemarini a Zeneran familie recoue∣red the Empire long after. They are in these times Ro. C. historie of Barbarie. diuided into Brebers and Alarbies. The Brebers inhabit the Mountaines: The Alarbees, the Plaines. Both of them maintaine deadly udes, and will fight forer battels in such quarrels, then in seruice of their King. Insomuch, that vpon losse of any great man, cruell battels haue been fought, and ten thousand men slaine at a time. The Alarbees haue their fairest Virgin riding on a Camell, with a flagge in her hand, decked in all pompe to sollicite her Kindred to reuenge, and goeth formost in the field incouraging them to follow. The kindred spareth no bloud to saue their Virgin, which the other side striueth to winne, holding that a continuall glorie to the seuenth generation. When a man is killed, his Tribe seeketh not reuenge on the murtherer onely, but on the first man of that Tribe he meetes with. The Brebers doe likewise. Their women follow them in their battels, with a certaine colour in their hand called Hanna, which will staine, and therefore they throw it vpon such as offer to runne out of the field, the basest ignominie that can befall them. The Larbie and Breber doe differ as much in language, as Welch and English; the one is giuen to Husbandry, the other very much to Robbery. Mully Sidan in these late warres seeing the Larbees also become robbers, caused the next Dwarre (a towne of Tents) belonging to that Tribe which herein had faulted, to be destroyed, man, wo∣man,
childe, kine, sheepe, and whatsoeuer belonged to them; by his souldiours. But af∣ter hee had lost the field in the battell with Muly Sheck, they foraged vp to Marocco gates, trusting to the strength which that Tribe could make, being fifteene thousand horse. This Tribe or Kindred was called Weled Entid. In Africa they are much subiect to the cough: insomuch lib. 1. that on the Fridayes, when they are at their Mahumetan sermons, if one fall a coughing, another followes, and so from hand to hand all take it vp, and hold on in that sort, till the end of their sermon, no man hearing what hath beene said. For their morall he general vices of the A∣fricans, chap.8. conditions, Leo thus describeth them, as wee haue somewhat mentioned before: The Inhabitants of the Cities in Barbary are poore and proude, ire∣full, and writing all iniuries in marble: vntractable, and vnfriendly to strangers: simple, and credulous of impossibilities. The vulgar is ignorant of Nature, and esteem all works thereof diuine and miraculous. They are irregular in their life and actions, exceedingly subiect to choler, speake aloft and prowdly, and are often at buffets in the streetes. Thus base is their disposition, and no lesse is their estimation with their Lords, who make better account of their beasts. They haue no chiefe men or Officers to rule or counsell them. They are ignorant of merchandise, being destitute of bankers and money-chan∣gers, and euery Merchant is constrained to attend his wares himselfe. No people vn∣der heauen more couetous: few amongst them, which for loue of God or man will en∣tertaine a stranger, or requite a good turne: alwayes encombred with melancholy, they addict themselues to no pleasures: the reason where of is, their great pouerty and small gaines. The shepheards, both in the mountaines and fields, liue a labour some and miserable life; a beastly, thuish, ignorant kinde of people, neuer repaying any thing committed to them. The yong women before they marry may haue their louers in all filthinesse, none of them bestowing her virginitie on her husband; if they be once married, their louers do no more follow after them, but betake them to some others. The brutish fa∣ther makes this odious loue to his daughter, and the beastly brother to his whoorish si∣ster. The most of them are neither Mahumetans, Iewes, nor Christians, but without faith, and without so much as a shadow of Religion, neither making any prayers, nor hauing any Churches, but liue like beasts. And if any hath any smacke of deuotion, yet hauing no Law, Priest, nor any rule to follow, he is forced to liue like the other. Many of them, both in Cities and fields, are found fauouring of better things, both for Artes, Merchandise, and Deuotion, as the same Leo sheweth: but thus are the most inclined. Now, to adde somewhat further of the Mahumetan Religion in Africa. Anno 714. (as some do Ant. Gueuara Epistol.  de Barros Asia dec. 1. lib.1 reckon) the Saracens, by the incitement of Ius Earle of Seuta, as in our third Booke is related, inuaded and conquered Spaine. Leo in his fift Booke attributeth this to Muse Gouernor of Africa, vnder Qualid Some will haue this Qua∣lid or V, ro¦be the Miral∣mumin of Africa a Maraunian, whom Leo maketh the Easterne Chalipha. the Chalipha of Damasco, whose next successor depriued Muse, and sent Iezul to Cairaoan to succeed in his roome, whose po∣steritie there gouerned till that house was depriued of the Chaliphshippe, and the seate thereof remoued from Damasco to Bagdet. Then was Elagleb made Lieutenant of A∣frica, and held it with his posteritie after him one hundred and seuentie yeares. After which time El Mahdi an hereticall Chalipha dispossessed them. Of this El Mahdi, and Elcain, and their supposed heresies, I haue no certaine Historie. Certaine it is, that the Mahumetans from the beginning were diuided, as appeareth of Idris in our Historie of Fez: and more fully in the Catalogue of Mahomets next successors, which were the next, not in bloud, but in power. So did Bubac, or Abubacer challenge it, and after him Homar and Ottoman: contrary to the Testament of Mahomet, who appoynted Hali his heire. Muavias also murthered Hali and his sonne, to obtaine the soueraignetie. Thus were they diuide about the true successor of their false prophet; which fire is not yet extinct. Another diuision was about the interpretation of their law. G. B. E. Hist.Sar.lib. 1. Abubacer gaue foundation to the Sect Melchia or Melici embraced by the Africans: Homar was au∣thor of the Sect Anesia, which the Turkes and Zaharans in Afrike receiue. Odman or Ottoman left behinde him the Banesia, which hath also his followers. Hali was head
of the Imemia, which is followed by the Persians, Indians, many Arabians, and Gelbines of Africa. Curio calleth these Sects Melici, embraced of the Africans, and as he affirmeth. A∣safij of the Syrians and Arabians, Alambeli of the Persians, and Bnanisi of the Alexandri∣ans and Assyrians. Forren names can scarcely be translated, but withall are traduced, and of diuers diuersly called. Of these foure grew three score and eight Sects of name, besides other more obscure. Amongst the rest were the Morabites, who led their liues (for the most part) in Hermitages, and make prosession of morall Philosophie, with cer∣taine principles differing from the Alcoran. One of these was that Morabite, which cer∣taine yeares past shewing Mahomets name imprinted in his breast, beeing done with aqua fortis, or some such thing, raised vp a great number of Arabians in Africa, and laid siege to Tripolis, where being betrayed by his Captaine, hee remayned the Turkes prisoner, who sent his skinne to the grand Seignior. These Morabites affirme, that when Alle or Hali fought, he killed tenne thousand Christians with one blowe of his Sword, which they say was an hundred cubites long. The Cobtini is as foolish a Sect, one of which shewed himselfe, not many yeares since, at Algier, mounted on a reede, with a bridle and reines of leather, affirming that hee had ridden an hundred miles on that horse in one night, and was therefore highly reuerenced. Somewhat also is said be∣fore of these African Sects in our Chapter of Fez. An other occasion diuided Africa from other of the Mahumetan superstition. For when Muavia and Iezid his sonne were dead, one Marvan siezed on the Pontifica∣lity, but Abdalam the sonne of Iezid, expelled him. He also had slaine Holem the sonne of Hale a little before, whom the Arabians had proclaimed Chaliph, and there∣fore made the Maraunian flocke, of which he descended, odious to the Arabians. They therefore at Cusa chose Abdimelic for the Saracenicall soueraigne, who was of Halis posteritie, which they call the Abazian stocke or family. Hee sent Ciafa against Abda∣lan, who fled and was slaine; Ciafa exercised all cruelties against all that Maraunian kin∣red, drew Iezid out of his Sepulchre, and burnt his carkasse, and slaying all of that house, cast their bodies to the beasts and foules to be deuoured. Whereupon one Abed Ramon of that family, (some suppose him the sonne of Muavias) fled into Africa, with great troupes of foilowers and partakers, where the Saracens receiued him very honourably. Barrius Dec. i. lib. I. Asia. tels that Ciafa himselfe was Caliph, and that he descended of Abaz, of whom that stocke was called Abazian: and that he tooke an othe at his election, to destroy the Maraunians, which he executed in manner as aforesaid by Abidela his kinsman and Ge∣nerall. To Abed Ramon resorted the Mahumetans in Afrike, who equalling his heart to his fortunes. called himselfe Miralmuminin, which is is-pronounced Miramu∣li, & signifieth the Prince of the Beleeuers; which he did in disgrace of the Abazians, Some attribute the building of Marocco to him, which others ascribe to Ioseph, as be∣fore is said, and some to some other Prince, built (as they say) in emulation of Bagdet was built long af∣ter Abed Ra∣mons time. Bagdet, which the Easterne Calipha builded for the Metropolitan Citie of their Lawe and Em∣pire. Barrius addeth, that he became a Nabuchodonofor, to whip and scourge Spaine, which Vlit his sonne, by Musa his Captaine, wholy conquered in the time of Rhode∣rious. But Pelagius soone after with his Spanish forces beganne to make head against the Moores, and recouered from them some towns: which In two yeres space it is said, that there pe∣rished in those Spanish wars. 700000. people. warre was continued with diuersity of chance and change, three hundred yeares and more, till An. Do. 1110. Alphonsus the sixt tooke Toledo from them: and for diuers good seruices which Don Henrie Don Henrie Earle of Lo∣raine. had done him in these warres, gaue him his daughter in marriage, and for her portion, those parts which he had taken from the Moores in Lusitania, since called the kingdome of Portu∣gall, withall, that he or his could conquer frō them. Thus were the kingdom of Portugall planted in the bloud of the Moores, whereby it hath beene so fatned, and hath so bat∣ned euer since, that all their greatnesse hath risen from the others losse. For they not on∣ly cleared those parts of that kingdome of them, by an hereditary warre, but pursued them also into Africa, where Iohn the first tooke Seuta from them, so making way to his Posteritie, to pierce further, which happily they performed.
Alphonsus the fift of Portugal, Osor. de reb. gestis Emanelis tooke from them Tanger, Arzila, and Alcasare, and others: especially Emanuel wanne from them many Tutuan, Asa∣pbi, Castellum regale, Azamor, Titium, Maza∣gan, &c. Dam. a G. Cities, and a great part of Mauritania; the Arabians not refusing the Portugals seruice, till the Seriff arose in A∣frica, as euen now was shewed, and chased the Portugals thence. Thus Spaine hath reuenged herselfe of the Mahumetan iniuries by her two armes; of Castile (which at last draue them out of Granada, and tooke diuers Townes in the Maine of Africa from them, and in our dayes hath expelled the remainders of that Race quite out of Spaine;) and Portugal, which thus freed it selfe, and burthened them, and by another course did yet more harme to the Mahumetan profession. For Henry, sonne of Iohn the first, set forth Fleets to discouer the Coasts of Africa, and the Ilands adjacent, diuers of which were by the Portugals possessed; made way to the further discoueries and conquests of that Nation in Africa, and India, to these our dayes, where they haue taken diuers Kingdomes and Cities from the Moores. Of which, o∣ther places of this Historie in part, and the larger relations of Barrius, Osorius, Maffeus, Arthiu Dantis∣canus. P. Iarric lib. 3. Barrius in his Decades, of Osorius, Maffaeus and Arthus, Iarric, and others, are ample witnesses. CHAP. XIII. Of Biledulgerid and Sarra, otherwise called Numidia and Libya, WE haue now, I suppose, wearied you with so long discourse of that part of Africa on this side Atlas, but such is the difference of the mindes wearinesse, from that of the bodie, that this being wearied with one long iourney, if the same be continued with a second, it is more then tired: the other after a tedious and irkesome way, when another of an∣other nature presents it selfe, is thereby refreshed, and the former wearinsse is with this varietie abated, yea although it be, as this is, from a better to a worse. Euen the mounting vp this cold hill, and thence to view the Atlantike Ocean on the West, Southward and Eastward the deserts, will neither make the soule breathlesse with the steepe ascent, nor faint with so wilde prospects of manifold wildernesses; this of bar∣ren Earth, and that of ba Waters; a third seeming to be mixt of both, a sea without waters, and earth without soliditie, a sand not to hazard shippes with her priuie am∣bushments, but with open violence swallowing men, and disdaining to hold a foot∣print as a testimony of subiection; a winde not breathing aire, but sometimes the higher element in fiery heats, and sometimes the lower in sandie showers: once, a Na∣ture mocking Nature, an order without order, a constant inconstancie; where it is Natures pastime to doe and vndoe; to make mountaines and valleyes, and moun∣taines of valleyes at pleasure. Strange is the composition of these places, but stranger is that of the minde, which feedes it selfe with the cruell hunger, and satiates thirst with the insatiable thirstinesse of these deserts. And whereas the bodie feareth to bee drowned, euen there, where it as much feareth to want water, in this sandy iourney: the Soule (modell of Diuinity, life of Humanitie) feares no such accidents to it selfe, but in a sweetnesse of variety delights to suruey all that her first and ancient inheri∣tance (howsoeuer since by sinne mortgaged and confiscated) and being sequestred from all societies of men, can heere discourse with GOD and Nature in the Deserts. Hither now, after so long a preamble, wee bring you, and at first present vnto your view Numidia, where you shall be feasted with Dates, which haue giuen the name Biledulgerid (that is Date-region) thereundo, and before is made one entire part of seuen, in our Lib.6.cap.1. diuision of Africa. Lduius L. Marmelius. Marmelius writes it Bild el Gerid The Easterne Border is Eloacat, a City distant 100 miles frō Egypt; the Westerne is the Atlantike Ocean; the Northerne, Atlas; the Southerne Libya. This is the basest part of Africa Leo lib.1. ; the Cosmographers not deigning it the name of a Kingdom, the inhabitāts
thereof are in many places so farre distant from any other. As for example, Tesset a Citie of foure hundred housholds, is separated from all other habitation three hun∣dred miles. Some places thereof are better peopled. The Numidia described by Ptol. lib.4. Plin.lib. 5 cap 3. P. Mela.l.1.c.6. Olinarius in Melam. Cael. Rhod.lib. 18. cap. 38. Pto∣lomey, Mela, and Pliny, is of farre lesse bounds, and is rather a part of Barbary, then of this which we heere describe: called (saith Pliny) Metagonitis, and famous for nothing but Marble and wilde beasts: the Numidae called Nomades of their pastorall life, and change of pastures, carrying their houses on their carts. The Cities whereof were Cyr∣tha, called now Constantina and Iol, now as some write Bugia. The Numidians are notorious for excessiue venery. For the Religion of these, whom Leo termeth Numidi∣ans, he saith, That in old time they worshipped certain Planets, and sacrificed to them: and were like to the Persians in worship of the Sunne, and the Fire, to both which they built Temples; and like the Vestals in Rome, kept the fire continually burning. Chri∣stian Religion began to quench this fire (as is Mermannij Theatrum. thought) in the Apostles dayes, which af∣ter was peruerted by Arianisme, subuerted by Mahometisme. Iewish religion had heere some footing also, before that Christianity was preached to them. The Numidians liue long, but lose their teeth betimes (sowre sauce for their sweet Dates) and their eyes also pay vntimely tributes to the sands, which the windes very busily and often send as their searchers and customers, till at last they can see to pay them no more. In all Numidia the French disease (as we terme it) is vnknowne, and in Libya. I haue knowne, saith Leo, an hundred persons that haue beene cured of that malady, onely by passing ouer Atlas and breathing this ayre. This disease was not heard of in Africa, till King Ferdinand expelled the Iewes out of Spaine, & the Moores by lying with the Iewes wiues got the same; and generally infected Barbary, calling it therefore the Spanish disease. The Plague also infecteth Barbary once in ten, fifteene, or fiue and twentie yeares, and destroyeth great multitudes, because they haue little regard or remedy for it. In Numidia it is scarce knowne once to happen in an hundred yeares, and in the Land of Negros neuer. Worse diseases then Pox or Plague possesse the Numidians, namely, ignorance of Diuine, Morall, and Naturall knowledge, Trea∣son, Murther, Robbery, without all respect of any thing. If any of them are hired in Barbary, they are employed in base offices, Scullians, Dungfarmers, and what not? Neither are the Libyans or Negros much better. Of the Numidians and Libyans are fiue peoples, Zenaga, Guenzaga, Terga, Lemta, and Berdeua, and liue al after the same manner, that is, without manners or order at all. Their garments of base cloath, scarce couer halfe their bodie. The Gentlemen (Gen∣tlemen must pardon me the abasing of the name) to be distinguished from the rest, weare iacket of blew cotton with wide sleeues. Their Steeds are Camels, on which they ride without stirrops or saddles, and vse a goad in stead of spurres, and a lether fa∣stened in a hole bored thorow the gristles of the Camels nose, serues them for a bridle. Mattes made of rushes are their beds, and wooll growing on their Date-trees yeelds matter for their tents. Their food is often-times patience with an empty belly: which when they fill, bread or meat after any sort is absent: Onely they haue their Camels milke, whereof they drinke a dish-full next their heart: and certaine drie flesh sodde in butter and milke, euery one with his hands raking out his share of these dainties, and after drinking the broth; and then drinke vp a cup of milke, and supper is done. Whiles milke lasteth they care not for water, especially in the Spring-time; all which soason, some neuer wash hands or face, because they neuer goe to the places where they may haue water. And the Camels haue ioyned with their masters in this neatnesse, not re∣garding water, whiles they may feed on grasse. All their life (or that space rather before they die, not worthy the name of life) is spent in hunting, and robbing their enemies; not staying aboue three or foure dayes in a place, as long as the grasse will serue their Camels. They haue ouer euery tribe one, in manner of a King, whom they honour and obey. Very rarely is a Iudge found amongst them, and to him such as are litigious ride sometimes fiue or six dayes iourney. Him will they amply-reward with a thousand duckats, more or lesse by the yeare. As for Letters, Arts, Vertue, they dwell not in these deserts.
They are very iealous, which is the death of many. Yet are they liberall after their man∣ner to strangers, as I my selfe (it is Leo's report) can testifie. For going ouer the deserts with a Carauan of Merchants, the Prince of Zanaga encountered vs with fiue hundred men on Camels, and caused vs to pay our customes: and then inuited vs to his tents. There did he kill many Camels to feast vs, both yong and old, and as many gelt, and Ostriches, which they had taken in the way. And when the Merchants shewed them∣selues loath that he should make such slaughters of them, he said that it were shame to entertaine them with small cattell only, being strangers. So we had roast, and boiled: and bread of Panike, very fine; and Dates great plenty. Hee honored our company with his presence; but he ate together with his Nobles separate from vs: and had with him certaine religious and learned men, to sit with him, which all the meale-time tou∣ched no bread, but only flesh and milke. The reason the Prince gaue vs, because they were borne in the deserts where no corne grew. Only they ate bread on certaine so∣lemne Feasts, as at their Easter, and day of Sacrifices. Thus did this liberall Prince spend on vs ten times the value of his customes. After this manner also liue the Afri∣cans called Soaua. The Tracts of Numidia Leo lib. 6. most in name, are these: Dara, which extendeth it selfe two hundred and fifty miles in length, where are great store of Date-trees, whereof some are male, and some female; the first brings forth only flowers, the other, fruit. And they take a flowred bough of the male, and engraft it in the female: otherwise, the Dates proue nought, and almost all stone. They feed their Goats with the stones of the Dates beaten, and there with they grow fat, and yeeld store of milke. Segelmesse was built (if any list to beleeue Bicri an Afri∣can Cosmo∣grapher his er∣rour. Bicri, an African Cosmographer) by Alexander the Great. Heere were certaine Colleges and Temples. The people of the Country liued on Dates. They haue no Fleas; a small priuiledge, for they haue infinite store of Scorpions. Fighig, hath industrious and wittie people, whereof some become Merchants, others Students, and go to Fesse, where hauing obtained the degree of Doctors they returne into Numidia, and are made Priests and Preachers, and so become rich. Tego∣rarin hath traffique with the Negros. They water their corne-fields with Well-water, and therefore are forced to lay on much soile. In which respect they will let strangers haue their houses rent-free, onely the dung of themselues and their beasts excepted. They will expostulate with that stranger, which shall in some nicer humour goe out of doores to that businesse, and aske him, if he know not the place appointed thereunto. Heere were many rich Iewes, which by meanes of a Preacher of Telensin, were spoi∣led, and most of them slaine, at the same time that Ferdinand chased them out of Spaine. Techort is a Numidian Towne, exceeding courteous to strangers, whom they entertaine at free-cost, and marry their daughters to them rather, then to the natiues. Pescara is exceedingly insested with Scorpions, whose sting is present death, wherefore the Inhabitants in Sommer time forsake their Citie, and stay in their coun∣trey-possessions till Nouember. Libya extendeth it selfe from the confines of Eloachat vnto the Atlantike, betwixt the Numidians and Negros. It is one other of the seuen parts, into which we haue di∣uided Africa. The Arabians call it Sarra, that is, a Desert. Pliny Plin.lib. 5. in the beginning of his fifth booke, saith, that all Africa by the Grecians was called Libya. Taken in a more proper sense, it is diuersly Strabo lib. 17. Otel Thesaurus. bounded by the Ancients; and therefore we will heere hold vs to Leo's description. The name Libya is deriued from Libs, a Mauritani∣an King, as some . Coruini Geograph. affirme. Herodotus Herodoti lib.3. saith, of a woman named Libya. Among the Libyans are reckoned Niger. Aph. Com. 3. the Libyarchae, Libyophaenices, Libyaegrptij, and diuers other nations, euen of the Isidurus, Orig. lib. 6. Ancients accused for want of inward and outward good things, cunning only in spoile and robbery. The Libyans worshipped one Psaphon Alexand. ab Alex. lib.6.c 4. for their god, induced thereunto by his subtilty. For he had taught birds to sing, Psaphon is a great god; which being set at liberty, chaunted this note in the woods, and easily per∣swaded the wilde people to this deuotion. It was the custome of women to howle in their Temples, Cael. Rhod.lib. 12. cap.2. whence some of the Bacchanal rites were borrowed by the Grecians. Vnto the Libyans are reckoned those nations, whose barbarous rites are before related
in the seuenth Chapter of this booke. We will now come to later obseruations. G. Bot. Ben. part.1.lib.3. Maginus. Men may trauell eight dayes or more in the Libyan deserts, ordinarily without finding any water. The deserts are of diuers shapes, some couered with grauell, others with sand, both without water: heere and there is a lake, sometime a shrubbe, or a little grasle. Their water is drawne out of deepe pits, and is brackish, and sometimes the sands co∣uer those pits, and then the trauellers perish for thirst. The Merchants that trauell to Tombuto, or other places this way, carry water with them on Camels; and if water faile them, Leo. lib.1. they kill their Camels, and drinke water which they wring out of their guts. Their Camels are of great abilitie to sustaine thirst, sometimes trauelling with∣out drinke twelue dayes or more. Otherwise they were neuer able to trauell thorow those deserts. In the desert of Azaoad there are two Sepulchres of stone, wherein certaine letters ingrauen testifie, that two men were there buried; one a very rich Merchant, who tor∣mented with thirst, bought of the other, which was a carrier or transporter of wares, a cup of water, for ten thousand duckats, and died neuerthelesse; both buier and seller, with thirst. Their liues for leaudnesse resemble the Numidians before mentioned, but for length come much short of them, few attaining to sixty yeares. A. Cadamoste. They are (as little need as they haue thereof) often plagued with those clouds of Grashoppers, which couer the aire, and destroy the earth. The Libyan desert of Zanhaga beginning at the Westerne Occan, extendeth it selfe farre and wide betweene the Negros and the Numidians, to the Salt-pits of Tegaza. From the Well of Azaoad, to the Well of Araoan, an hundred and fifty miles space, is no water; for lacke whereof, many both men and beasts there perish. Likewise in the desert Gogdem, for nine daies iourney no drop of water is found. In the desert of Tar∣ga is Manna found, which the Inhabitants gather in little vessels, and carry to Agadez to sell. They mingle it with their drinke, and with their pottage: It is very holesome. Tegaza is an inhabited place, where are many veines of Salt, which resembles Mar∣ble, they digge it out of pits, and sell it to Merchants of Tombuto, who bring them victuals. For they are twenty dayes iourney from any habitation, the cause that some∣times they all die of famine. They are much molested with the South-east winde, which maketh many of them to lose their sight. Bardeoa was found out lately by one Hamar, a guide vnto a Carauan of Merchants, who lost his way by reason of a mala∣dy which fell into his eyes; yet blinde as he was he rode on a Camel; none else being able to guide them: and at euery miles end caused some sand to be giuen vnto him, whereon he smelled, and thereby at last told them of an inhabited place, forty miles before he came at it: where, when they came, they were denied water, and were for∣ced by force to obtaine it. The Riuers that arise out of Atlas, and by the vnkindnesse of their Kinde, fall this way, finding these thirstie wildernesses to yeeld them the rea∣diest chanells, are trayned alongst by the allurements of the sands, stouping and crou∣ching to them, till being further from witnesses, they are either swallowed vp of great lakes, or else whiles they hold on their pursuit for the Ocean, lose themselues in the search, and whiles they are liberall to the thirstie sands in the way, at last die them∣selues (I cannot say, diue themselues, as elsewhere in the world) for thirst in the deserts. And yet through these way-lesse wayes, doth couetousnesse carry, both the Arabians in their roauings, and Merchants with their Carauans to the Negros for wealth: whi∣ther, I thinke, at last you expect the comming of this our Carauan also.
CHAP. XIIII. Of the Land of NEGROS. NIgritarum terra, or the Land of Negros, Maginus. Gi. Bot. Ben. either is so called of the Riuer Niger, or of the blacke colour of the Inhabitants: some thinke the Riuer is named Niger of the people: It hath on the North those deserts which we last left; on the South, the Aethiopike Ocean, and the Kingdome of Congo; on the East, Nilus; on the West, the At∣lantike. Leo makes Gaogo in the East, and Gualata in the West, the limits thereof. On the side of the Riuer Canaga it is sandy and desert, beyond, it is plentifull, being watered with Niger, which runnes thorow the middest of it. There are no hills neere the bankes of Niger, but wooddy places diuers, receptacles of Ele∣phants. Raines do neither good nor harme: only Niger Ministers them plenty, as Ni∣lus in Egypt: Their encrease is likewise alike; forty dayes together after the middest of Iune doth Niger encrease, at which time the Negro townes are Ilands, and the way to them by boats; and as many it decreaseth. The Merchants in Iuly, August and Sep∣tember, trade in boats made of a hollowed tree (like the Indian Canoas) lo. Leo lib. 7. This Riuer, some thinke, ariseth out of a desert called Se, from a great lake: some with lesse like∣lihood, thinke it an arme of Nilus: Cadamosto. and some with no truth, thinke it to bee deriued from Paradise. It is by Geographers Ortel. Ramu∣sius, &c. brought from a lake, which they call Niger, within two degrees of the Equinoctiall, and running thence Northwards, hides him∣selfe from the violence of the Sunnes fury, vnder a mantle of earth, sixty miles toge∣ther; and then the Earth discouering him, he runnes not farre, but in reuenge he co∣uers a great part of the Earth, and drowneth the same in a lake called Borneo, till the Earth againe with her strong armes claspes him in streiter bankes, and forceth him to turne his streame Westward, in which way hauing gotten fresh helpe of some other streames, that send in their succours; he againe preuaileth, and ouerthrowes the Earth in the lake Guber: but shegetting vp againe, makes him flee to the Ocean for aide, with whose tide-forces assisted, hee rendes the Earth in to many Ilands, which hee holds as captiues betweene his watery Ortelius and others in their Mappes, make Senaga and Gambra to be armes or mouthes of Niger. Sanutus thinkes it to be Rio Grande, Leo alledgeth the opinion of some which thinke it to come from Ni∣lus by some vnder-earth passage. The Truth is vncer∣taine, the an∣gry deserts not admitting due search. Armes of Senaga, Gambra, and diuers o∣thers, which euer let slippe their hold, and hold them yet in euerlasting captiuitie. In this combate whiles both parts sweate in contention, a fatter excrement is left be∣hinde, which all this way heartens the Earth with admirable fertilitie: especially then when the clouds in the Summer time take Nigers part, and daily marshall their mightie showers to the Riuers aide, shooting off continually in their march their airy Ordinance, with dreadfull lightnings, whereat the amazed Earth shrinkes in her selfe, and the insulting waters for three moneths space trample ouer all, and send colonies of fishes to inhabit the soile, engirting meane while all the townes with a strait siege. But when the Sunne, in his Autumne progresse, sends forth the windes to summon the cloudes to attend on his fiery Chariot; The Earth by degrees lookes vp with her dittie face, bemired with washing, and makes vse of the slime, which can∣not runne away with the fleeting waters, to serue her all the yeare after, as harbenger of plenty and abundance. Bichri and Meshudi, ancient African Writers, knew little of these parts: Leo lib. 7. but a Mahumetan Preacher in the 380. yeare of the Hegeira, made the people of Luntuna, and Libya, of his faithlesse faith: and after that, they were discouered. They liued, saith Leo, like beasts, without King, Lord, Common-wealth, or any gouernment, scarse knowing to sowe their grounds: cladde in skinnes of beasts: not hauing any pecu∣liar wife; but lie ten or twelue men and women together, each man chusing which he best liked. Warre they wage with no other Nation, nor are desirous to trauell out of their countrey. Some worship the Sunne at the rising: Others, as the people of Gualata, the Fire: & those of Gaoga are Christians, like the Egyptians: Ioseph King of Marocco
subdued them: and after that the fiue peoples of Libya; of whom they learned the Ma∣humetan Law, and other Arts, and the Merchants of Barbary frequented those parts. The Libyans diuided them into fifteene parts, each third part of those fiue peoples possessing one. But the Anno 1526. present King of Tombuto, Abaci Izchia, being made Generall of the Forces of Soni Heli the former King, which was a Libyan, after his death slew his sons, and brought the Kingdome to the Negros, conquering many Prouinces. After which he went to Mecca on Pilgrimage, and therby set himselfe in debt an hundred and fiftie thousand duckats. A great part of those parts by their difference of language, and Re∣ligion, is yet vnknowne to vs. Gualata was subdued by the King of Tombuto, a beggerly Countrey. This Regi∣on adioyneth to Cape Blanco. The Portugals, when they discouered these Coasts for Henry the Infanta, traded heere for slaues as is farre as Canaga, or Senaga (to which our Nation Rich. Raialds, Hack. hath since traded) and is an arme, as is said, of Niger. These people inhabiting on this Riuer, Aluise Cadamosto. di Cadamosto, a Venetian, calls Azanaghi, and saith, that when first the Portugals sailed thither, their simplicity was such, hauing neuer before seene a shippe, they tooke the shippes for great birds with white wings, out of some strange place comming thither: but when they saw them strike saile, they changed their opi∣nion, and thought them to be fishes, seeing them a sarre off: but when they saw them the next day so farre off from that place, they tooke them for night-goblins or spirits. This did he learne of diuers of the Azanaghi, slaues in Portugal. They hidde their faces no lesse then the priuities, esteeming the mouth vnmeete to be seene, whence they belched such sowre breath. They had a kind of muffler to hide it, and part of the nose, onely discouering the same at meate. Other Gouernours they then had not, on∣ly more reuerence was done to the most rich. A beggerly, theeuish, lying, trecherous Nation, as any in the world. They annoynt their haire euery day with fatte of fish for great gallantry, whereof they stinke exceedingly. And lest you should thinke better of their eyes then of their nose, their women esteeme it the greatest part of goodly feature, to haue large breasts, which by Art and industrious stretching of them, they enlarge, and some of them haue them hanging to their Nauill. Neere vnto those are certaine Negros, which suffer not themselues to be seene of any, nor to be heard speake: but haue excellent gold which they exchange with other Negros, which bring vnto them Salt, such as the minerall salt of Tagazza, and lea∣uing the same, they goe away from thence halfe a dayes iourney: the Negros come downe in certaine Barkes, and lay at euery heape of Salt a quantity of gold, and goe their wayes. When the Salt-Merchants returne, if they like the summe, they take it; if not, they leaue the gold still with the Salt, and goe their wayes: and then the other returne, and what heapes of Salt they finde without gold, they take for their owne: the other, either they leaue more gold for, or else leaue altogether. This seemeth hard to beleeue, but many of the Arabians and Azanhagi testified it to our Authour for truth. The Merchants of Melli affirmed to me, that their Prince had once by a plot taken one of them, thinking to haue learned the condition of that people, but either of sullennesse, or because he could not, he neither eate nor spake, and within three dayes died. Their stature, they which had taken him, affirmed to be a hand higher then themselues: and that their nether lippe was thicke and redde, and so great that it hung downe to their brest, and it together with their gummes bloudie: their teeth great, and on each side one very large: their eyes standing out: terrible they were to looke vpon. And because they had apprehended this man by their ambushment, they returned not in three yeares: but after forced by the need of Salt to cure their diseases (whence happily that deformity proceeded) they renewed that traffique. To leaue these farre within Land, and come to the Barrius dec.1. lib.3. cap.8. & Maffaeus hist. Ind. lib.1. saith that Senaga and Gambea were by the Ancients cal∣led Stabiris and D ratus. This name Se∣naga was giuen by reason that the Prince was so called. Riuer Senaga, Cadamosto iustly maruelled at the partition which that Riuer caused: for on the one side the Inha∣bitants were well proportioned, very blacke, and the soile very fertile: on the other side, the Inhabitants meagre, small, swart, and the ground barren. The people, that dwell on the bankes of Niger, are called Gilofi. The Kings name in my time (which
was 1455. almost a hundred and threescore yeares since) was Zuchali. Hee had thirtie wiues. When Richard Hak. to.2. Rainolds was there 1591, the Kings name was Amar Me∣lik. All that Region betwixt Sanaga and Gambea is called by one generall name, Gia Lof: of which, Maffeus Maff. l.1. Bar.Dec. 1.l.3. c.6,7,8. and Barrius write, That in an accident of ciuill warres Bemoin came to the King of Portugall for aide, and was there royally entertained and baptized with his followers; of which, some were of such admirable dexteritie and nimblenesse of bodie, that they would leape vpon a horse as he galloped, and would stand vpright in the saddle, when he ranne fastest, and turne themselues about, and suddenly sit downe; and in the same race would take vp stones layd in order on the ground, and leape downe and vp at pleasure. This Bemoin was shamefully murthered by Peter Vaz, the Portugall Generall, and the hope of Christianitie in those parts disappointed. This was Anno 1489. From thence Al.Cadam. Cadamosto went to Budomel; the Prince whereof was had in great respect by his people: which when they come into his presence, kneele on both their knees, and bowing their heads to the ground, cast sand ouer their shoulders, and on their heads, with both hands, and then goe towards him on their knees; and when they speake to him, cast sand ouer their shoulders still, with their head bowed downe, the Prince scarcely deigning them a looke, or word. For euery light offence he would sell their wiues and children. He suffered our Author to goe into his Moschee, where his Arabian Chaplaines, after their manner, mumbled their Mattens tenne or twelue times in halfe an houre; all the companie rising and falling againe to the earth, and kissing it. He also heard him willingly confute the Mahumetane, and proue the Chri∣stian Faith: but said, he thought it was harder for a Christian to be saued then a Ne∣gro, because GOD was a iust GOD and LORD, who had giuen to vs many good things in this world; to them nothing in comparison, who should therefore in the o∣ther world haue their Paradise, which here they wanted. Easily might he haue beene turned to Christianitie, but for feare of loosing his State. His wiues prouide him his diet, as it is vsuall among the Negros, and none but his Priests and some principall men eate with him; which is after a beastly sort lying on the ground, the dish set in the middest, and all taking out the meat with their hands. They eate little at once, but eate often, foure or fiue times a day. From October to Iune it raines not there. They haue great Serpents, and many, which they vse to charme: and the Prince when he would poyson his weapons, did (as was reported) make a great Circle, and en∣chaunted by his Charmes all the Serpents thereabouts thereinto, and then killed that which seemed to him most venomous, letting the rest goe: with the bloud thereof, and the seed of a certaine Tree, he tempered a poyson for that purpose, with which a weapon infected, drawing neuer so little bloud, did kill in a quarter of an houre. They haue great store of Parrats, which are instructed by a maruellous naturall cunning to preuent the Serpents, which would else destroy their neasts. They build therefore on high Trees, and on the end of some tender bough thereof they fasten a Bull-rush, which hangs downe two spannes, thereunto weauing and working their neast in such sort, that the Serpents, for feare of falling, dare not aduenture to deale therewith. The Negros came about Cadamosto, with wonder to see his apparrell, and the whitenesse of his colour (neuer before had they seene any Christian) and some of them with spit∣tle rubbed his skinne, to see whither his whitenesse were naturall, or no: which per∣ceiuing to be no tincture, they were out of measure astonished. They would then giue nine, or sometimes foureteene slaues, for a horse furnished. And when they buy a horse, they will bring some of their Enchaunters, which make a fire of hearbes, and set the horse ouer the smoake, vttering certaine wordes; and after that annoint him with a thinne ointment, and shut him vp twentie dayes, that none may see him, han∣ging certaine trumperie about his necke, thinking that hereby they are more se∣cure in battaile. Gunnes seemed to them, for their hideous noyse, to be of the Deuill. Bagge-pipes they thought to be a liuing creature, that thus sang in variable accents. But when they were suffered to handle them, they thought them to be some heauen∣ly thing, that GOD had made with his owne hands, to sound so sweetly. They be∣held
the Shippe with great curiositie; and Eyes that were carued in the Prow of the Shippe, they tooke to be eyes indeede, by which it saw how to direct the course at Sea. They said, the Christians that could thus make voyages by Sea, were great En∣chaunters, and comparable to the Deuill; themselues had ynough to doe to trauell by Land. Seeing a Candle burne in the night, they which knew not to make any light but their fires, esteemed it wonderfull. Honey they haue, which they sucke out of the combes, but the Waxe they hurled away, till they were instructed how to make Candles thereof. Senega (Boterus sayth) comes from the Lakes Chelonidi. A hundred and fiftie Leagues from the mouth it hath certaine Falls, or Cataracts (as Nilus hath) that men may passe vnder the fall of the streame, without wetting. Cadamosto doubled the Promontorie, called Cape Verde, or the greene Cape, be∣cause of the greene Trees which the Portugalls (who had first discouered it in the yeare before) found there growing in abundance; as Likewise Cape Sierra Lio∣na is so called of the Lion∣like terrour thereof, al∣wais couered on the top with Clouds, which yeeld dreadful thun∣ders and light∣nings. It seems to be the same that Ptolomey and Hann. call the Chariot of the Gods. G. ot. Ben. Cape Blanco, or the White Cape, was so called of the White Sands there. The inhabitants they found were of two sorts, Barbacini, and Sereri. They haue no Prince. They are great Idolaters, and haue no Law: but are very cruell. They poyson their arrowes; with which, and the situation of their Countrey, they haue preserued themselues from the Kings of Senega. In Gambia they were, some Idolaters of diuerse sorts, some Mahumetanes. They were also great Enchaunters. Their liuing, as at Senega, saue that they eate Dogges∣flesh. Here the Prince hunted an Elephant, and gaue them to eate: the flesh is strong and vnsauorie. The Elephants delight in myre like Swine. They hunt them in the Woods: for in the Plaines an Elephant would, without running, soone take and kill the swiftest man; whome yet they hurt not, except they be first prouoked. Here was a kinde of Fish (Cadamosto Cadamosto apud Ramus. Nous. 47. calls it Cavallo, and his Latine Interpreter, Piscis Caballinus; I take it for the Hippopotamus, or Riuer-Horse) which is (sayth he) as bigge as a Cow; his legges short, with tuskes like to a Bores, but so great, that I haue seeue one of two spannes, and longer, clouen-footed, and headed like a Horse: he liues on both Elements, sometimes in the Water, otherwhiles on the Land. The wo∣men vpon their breasts, neckes, and armes, had certaine workes, done with a Needles point, heated in the fire, in manner as with vs they worke hand-kerchiefes. This be∣ing done in their youth, would neuer out. The like flesh-branded workes they vse at Cape Sagres, as Pietro Pietro di Sin∣tra. di Sintra, a Portugall, obserued vpon their bodies and faces. The inhabitants there are Idolaters, and worship Images of Wood, to whome they offer some of their meat and drinke, when they goe to their meales. They goe naked, couering their priuie parts with the Barkes of Trees. This is The Hollan∣ders were en∣tertained of a King in Gui∣nee, but very miserably: an old woman naked, three times went a∣bout the Cap∣taine, with cer∣taine murmu∣ring words, and cast ashes on his clothes. The Nobles a∣bout the King were naked. Hol. Nauig. 1599. in Guinea. A little from thence they found men who vsed as great brauery in their eares, which they bored full of holes, and ware therein rings of gold in rowes or ranks. They ware one great ring in an other hole bored through their nose, like to buffles in Italie: which, when they eate their meat, they tooke away. The men and women of sort weare such rings also in their lips, in like sort as in their eares, an ensigne of their No∣bilitie and greatnesse, which they put in and out at pleasure. Beyond the Riuer of Palmes they found others thus beringed, and for greater gallantry ware about their necks certaine chaines of teeth, seeming to be the teeth of men. They tooke a Negro whom they carried into Portugall, who affirmed, if a woman which only could vn∣derstand him, did interpret him rightly, that in his Country were Vnicornes. On this coast the Portugals erected a Castle, called Mina, for their better trading. And these Countries haue since beene sought to The Guine∣ans esteeme well of the French, ill of the Flemish, and not well of the Portu∣galls. Arthus Hist.Ind.Or.c.9. by French, Flemish, and many of our English Merchants. In the yeare 1553. Tho. Windam. Antonie Pintea∣do. See Hakl. voy∣ages, to.2. part.3. Thomas Windam and Antonie Ponteado, a Portugall, in two English ships traded alongst those coasts, as farre as Benin, where they presen∣ted themselues to the King, who sate in a great Hall, the walls whereof were made of earth without windowes, the roofe of thinne boords, open in diuers places. His No∣bles about him neuer looke him in the face, but sit cowring vpon their buttocks, with their elbowes vpon their knees, and their hands before their faces, not looking vp till
the King commaund them. And when they depart out of his presence, they turne not their backes vpon him. Such reuerend regard doth that Negro-King receiue of them. The next yeare Iohn Lock. Master Iohn Lock went for Captaine into those parts, to trade for Gold, Graines, and Elephants teeth. And after that, diuerse Voyages were thither made by William William Tow∣erson. Towerson, who obserued at the Riuer of S. Vincent strange Trees, with great leaues like great Dockes, longer then that a man could reach the toppe of them; and a kinde of Pease by the Sea-side growing on the Sands like Trees, with stalkes seuen and twentie paces long. Diuerse of the women had breasts exceeding long. At the Cape Tres puntas they made him sweare, By the Water of the Sea, that he would not hurt them, before they would trade with him. King Abaan, a Negro, entertained our men kindly; he caused a pot of Wine, of Palme, or Coco, which they draw forth of Trees, as wee haue elsewhere obserued; but their ceremonies in drin∣king are thus: First, they bring forth their pot of drinke, and then make a hole in the ground, and put some of the drinke into it, and after that cast in the earth againe, and thereon set their pot, and with a little thing made of a Gourd, take out of the same drinke, and put it vpon the ground in three places: and in diuerse places they haue certaine bunches of the pills of Palme-trees set in the ground before them, and there they put in some drinke, doing great reuerence in all places to the same Palme-trees. All these ceremonies done, the King tooke a Cup of Gold, in which they put Wine, and whiles he dranke, all the people cryed Abaan, Abaan, with certaine other words; and then they gaue drinke to euery one. The like ceremonies they vse in all the Countrey. In Benin Iames Welsh. the people goe naked till they be married; and then are clothed from the waste to the knees. Their Bread is a kind of Rootes, called Inamia; which, when it is well sodden, may be preferred before ours. They haue here great Spouts of wa∣ter falling out of the Ayre, which if they light on a Shippe, doe endanger the same. They fall like the Pillars of Churches. As for those Voyages to these parts, made by Willid Rutter. George Fenner. Antonie Ingram. Rutter, Fenner, Ingram, or others, I referre them to Master Hackluyts Col∣lections. These Coasts are vsually called Guinea, by a more generall appellation, although that be properly one Region onely. About the Castle of Mina they are subiect to such Wormes, as Master Ienkinson Ant. Ienkinson Hak. to. 1. These wormes come out of their legges, or some fleshie part. hath obserued to grow vpon men at Boghar in Bactria, by drinking the water of the Riuer there: which are an ell long, and must be pulled out by degrees, euery day a little: if they breake by the way, it is very dange∣rous. The tortures they cause is vnspeakable. The inhabitants of Benin Gtard Arth. Dant. Hist. India, c. 9. Ind. Orient. part. 6. de Bry. obserue Circumcision, and other Mahumeticall Super∣stitions: they cut or rase the skinne, with three lines drawne to their Nauell, estee∣ming it necessarie to saluation. They will not easily doe iniurie to any, especially a stranger. They haue Birds in such respect, that it is deadly to any that shall hurt them. And some are appointed to haue a peculiar care of them, and to prouide them soode; which they doe in high Mountaines, where they lay meat for them: which they come and eate. The inhabitants of Guinea Get. Art. c.10.11,12,13. giue religious respect also vnto certaine Trees. And in the yeare 1598 certaine Hollanders cutting them, and not ceasing at the persuasi∣on of the Negros, whose Superstitions in that case they derided, it passed from words to blowes betwixt them, and the Dutchmen were forced to get them to their shippes; one of their companie being slaine in the chase. But the murtherer was offered to the Hollanders to be punished: which they refusing, his countreymen cut off his head, and quartered his bodie, bestowing the one as a monument of reuenge, ouer the slaine parties graue, the other on the Fowles, vnburied. Their noses are flat, not na∣turally, but by pressing them downe in their infancie, esteeming it a great part of beautie. Their hot stomackes can digest raw flesh; and therefore Alex.Problem. l. 1. & 2. Cael. l. 16.c. 15. Alexander Aphro∣disieus, and Coelius Rhodiginus, that thinke their naturall heat, extracted to the out∣ward parts, to be the cause of their blacknesse, are deceiued. They eate their enemies
which are slaine in the warres (which are very rise amongst those Nations) and those which are taken, are euerlasting prisoners. And in some more important warres which they vndertake, they will burne their dwellings before they goe, least either the ene∣mie might possesse them by conquest, or themselues become too mindfull of a re∣turne. In these warres they prouide themselues of some light armour, wearing at such times no other apparrell. Some men, of greater sort, had a white confection, wherewith they whited their faces and bodies. Their women are vnfaithfull Secre∣taries in Natures most hidden secrets, vsing in the sight of men, women, boyes, and girles, to be deliuered of their children, whome after they circumcise, whether they be of the male or female sexe. Their funeralis they celebrate with much singing and solemnitie. They beleeue, that men, when they die, goe into another world, where they shall haue like need of many things, as here they haue, and therefore vse to put with the dead corpes some part of household. And if they loose any thing, they thinke, that some of their friends, which in the other world had need thereof, came thence and stole it. Of The Religi∣on of the Gui∣neans. GOD being asked, they said he was blacke and euill, and did them much harme; their goods they had by their owne labour, and not by his good∣nesse. Circumcision they vse, and some other Turkish Rites. They hold it vnmeet and irreligious to spit on the ground. They haue no Letters, nor Bookes. They ob∣serue a Sabbath, herein agreeing, and yet disagreeing, with Turke, Iew, and Christian, for they obserue Tuesdayes rest, from their Fishing and Husbandrie. The Wine (of the Palme-tree) which is that day gathered, may not be sold, but is offered to the King, who bestoweth it on his Courtiers, to drinke at night. In the middest of the Market-place (this was in the Riuer Gabam, and the Hollanders the reporters) they had a Table standing on foure Pillars, two elnes high, whose flat couer was made of Straw and Reedes wouen together. Hereon were set many strawen Rings, called Fetissos, or Gods, and therein Wheat, with Water and Oyle, for their God, which they thinke eates the same. Their Priest they call Fetissero, who euery festiuall day placeth a Seat on that Table, and sitting thereon, preacheth to the people; which done, the women offer him their infants, and he sprinkleth them with water, in which a Newt doth swimme, and then besprinkleth the Table aforesaid with the same water, and so vttering certaine words very loud, he dismissed his deuout assembly. Many weare such Rings of Straw next their bodies, as preseruatiues from those dangers, which else their angrie God might inflict on them. In honour of the same Deitie (or Deuill, as it seemes they conceiue him to be) they bechalke themselues with a kind of chal∣key earth, and this is vnto them in stead of their morning Mattens. The first bit at meales, and first draught, is consecrate to their Idoll, and therefore they besprinkle therewith those Rings, which I said they weare on their bodies. If Fishers cannot speed at Sea, they giue a peece of Gold to the Fetissero, to reconcile their frowning Saint. He therefore, with his wiues, walkes a kinde of procession through the Citie, smiting his breast, and clapping his hands with a mightie noyse, till he come at the shore: And there they cut downe certaine boughes from the Trees, and hang them on their neckes, and play on a Tymbrell. Then doth the Fetissero turne to his wiues, and expostulates with them, and withall hurleth into the Sea Wheat and other things as an offering to Fetisso, to appease his displeasure towards the Fishermen. When the King will sacrifice to Fetisso, he commaunds the Fetissero to enquire of a Tree, where∣to he ascribeth Diuinitie, what he will demaund. He, with his wiues, comes to the Tree, and in a heape of ashes, there prouided, prickes in a braunch plucked off the Tree, and drinking water out of a Bason, spouts it out on the braunch, and then dau∣beth his face with the ashes: which done, he declareth the Kings question, and the Deuill out of the Tree makes answere. The Nobles also adore certaine Trees, and esteeme them Oracles: and the Deuill sometimes appeareth vnto them in the same in forme of a blacke Dogge, and otherwhiles answereth without any visible apparition. There are which worship a certaine Bird, which is spotted and painted (as it were) with Starres, and resembleth the lowing of a Bull in her voice. To heare this Bird lowing in their iourney, is a luckie boding, saying, Fetisso makes them good promi∣ses,
and therefore set him, in that place where they heare it, a Vessell of Water and Wheat. And as the Earth and Ayre yeeld them Deities, so the Sea is not behind in this liberalitie, but yeelds certaine Fishes to thier canonization. In this respect they take not the Tunie at all, and the Sword-fish they take, but eat not till his sword be cut off, which is dryed, and holden in great veneration. The Mountaines would bend their sullen browes, if they should not haue some redde letters in their Ca∣lendar, to which their toppes aspire, threatening to scale Heauen, or ouer-whelme the Earth, if this Fetissan portion did not pacifie their angrie moode, by daily presents of meat and drinke set thereon. Neither can Nature alone vsurpe this Prauiledge, but Art, in other things her eulous corriuall, and farre vnequall competitor, in this matter of God-making, commonly gets the vpper hand. And therefore they with their ceremonious Art can make them Fetisso's, or Gods, at pleasure. Principally in their Funeralls they obserue it: for when one is dead, they make a new Fetisso, or Funerall rites. Ring of Straw, and pray it to beare the dead partie companie, and protect him in his iourney into the other world. The friends and kinsfolkes assembling, prepare a Henne, and then setting themselues in a corner of the dead mans house, they place all his Fetisso's on a row, the greatest in the middest, adorning the same with garlands of Pease and Beanes, like to the Popish praying-Beades. Then they sprinkle the same with the bloud of the Henne, and hang a chayne or garland of hearbes about their neckes. After this, the women set the Henne, now sodden, in the middest of the Fe∣tisso's, and the Fetissero takes water in his mouth, which amiddest his Exorcismes and Charmes he spouts on those Fetisso's, and taking two or three hearbes from his necke, he rolles the same in forme of a ball, which after certaine ceremonies hee layeth downe, and so doth, till all his Hearbe-garland be spent; and then makes them all in∣to one great Ball, and therewith besmeareth his face, and thus is it made a Fetisso; and the partie deceased is now at rest. In the meane time the dearest of his wiues filleth all the house with mourning, the neighbours and friends with Songs and Musicke (such as they haue) and Daunces. And at last they take vp the Corps, and carrie it to the Graue, which is digged foure foot deepe, and couer it with stakes, that nothing may fall therein. The women creeping about the Sepulchre, expostulate with him, Why he would leaue them? Then doe they hurle on earth, so that none can get into the Corps; for he hath with him his Household, Armour, and whatsoeuer he vsed in his life time; Wine also (if before he loued it) to drinke in the other world. Lastly, they couer the Sepulchre with a Roofe, to defend all from raine. If the King dies, not one∣ly greater solemnitie is vsed: but the Nobles thinking it necessarie for so great a Per∣sonage to haue attendants, they offer vnto him one, a seruant; another, a wife; a third his sonne or daughter, till there be many of both sexes in that other life to attend him. All which are suddenly slaine at vnawares, and their bloudie carkasses buried together with the King. Yea, the Kings wiues, which loued him best, refuse not this last and e∣uerlasting seruice, as they suppose; but yeeld themselues to die, that they may liue with him. The heads of all these, thus slaine, are set vpon poles round about the Se∣pulchre: Meat, Drinke, Rayment, Armes, and other Vtensils are added for their vse, and buried with them. They, in vncertainetie of criminall accusations, as of Adulte∣rie, Murther, and such like, haue a certaine water offered them to drinke by the Fetis∣sero, made of those hearbes whereof their Ball-Fetisso is made, and in effect like the cursed water, Num. 5. none daring to drinke, for feare of sudden death thereby, if he be guiltie. And now leauing the Coasts of Guinea, Benin, Melegete, and other Regions of the Negros, adioyning to the Sea, we will looke backe againe into the in-land Countries: whereof Gualata is a hundred myles distant from the Ocean, and hath alreadie beene mentioned. The next thereunto, in Leo.l.. Leos Relations, is Gheneoa, which is not the same with Guinea before-mentioned, if Leo had true intelligence, but is situate be∣twixt Gualata, Tombuto, and Melli, and in one place bordereth on the Ocean, where Niger falleth into the Sea. They had great Traffique with the Merchants of Barba∣rie. They haue Gold vncoyned, and vse also yron money. There is neither Towne,
nor Castle, but one, where the Prince, with the Priests, Doctors, and Merchants reside. Those Priests and Doctors goe apparrelled in white, the rest in blacke or blew Cot∣ton. In Iuly, August, and September, Niger ouerfloweth it. Izchia, the King of Tombuto, conquered it, and kept the King prisoner at Gago, till his death. Melli is the head Citie of a Kingdome, which hence taketh name, and hath in it great store of Temples, Priests, and Readers or Professors, which reade in the Temples, because they haue no Colledges. They are more ingenious then other Negros, and were the first that embraced the Mahumetan Law. Izchia also subdued them. Tombuto was founded in the yeare of the Hegeira 610. And it is situate within twelue myles of a braunch of Niger. There are many Wells, to receiue the ouer∣flowing waters of Niger. Salt is brought them fiue hundred myles from Tagazza, and is very deare. I, at my being there (sayth Leo) saw a Camels burthen sold for fourescore duckats. The King had many Plates and Scepters of Gold, some whereof weighed thirteene hundred pounds. They which speake to him, cast Sand ouer their heads, as Cadamosto obserued at Budomel. The King would admit no Iewes into his Citie, and hateth them so extreamely, that he would confiscate the goods of such Merchants as held traffique with them. He greatly honoured men of Learning, and no merchandise yeelded more gaine then Bookes. There were many Iudges, Doctors, and Priests, to whome he allowed their stipends. The people vsed much dauncing in the streets, from tenne to one a clocke at night. They mingle Fish, Milke, Butter, and Flesh together in their gallimausrey kind of diet, neither toothsome, nor holsome. Hamet, King of Marocco Pory.in tran∣slat. Ro C. Historie of Barbarie. , conquered the same Kingdome 1589, and also Gago, and other Countries of the Negros, extending his Empire six moneths iourney from Marocco, by Camels; whose riches thereby acquired, appeare in the letters of Law∣rence Hak. to.2. Madoc. Madoc, and we before haue touched. Gago is much frequented by Merchants, and things sold at excessiue rates. In an hundred myles space you shall scarce find one in those parts that can reade, or write: and the King accordingly oppresseth them with taxations. In Guber they sow their Corne on the waters which Niger, with his ouerflowings, brings vpon the Countrey, and haue abundant recompence. Izchia, King of Tombu∣to Leo, l.7. , conquered the King of Guber; of Agadez also, and of Cano, which haue great store of Merchants: Likewise, of Casena, and Zegzeg, and Zanfara; in which I finde little worth the remembrance. Cano hath some Relikes of Christianitie, and they are named by the Apostles names. Guangara was not onely oppressed by the said Izchia of Tombuto, but by Abraham King of Borno. Borno confineth with Guangara on the West, and extendeth Eastwards fiue hun∣dred myles. The people haue no Religion, neither Christian, Iewish, nor Mahume∣tan; but like Beasts liue with their wiues and children in common: and as a Merchant which liued long amongst them, and learned their Language, told Leo, they haue no proper Fuen our auncestors, the Saxon, had no surnames, but by some acci∣dents, as White, Long, Short, &c. And the Nor∣mans brought ouer their cu∣stomes of na∣ming men by the place of their habitati∣on; as the Towne, Oke, Style, or their Occupation. And in aunci∣ent Writings few proper names, but their Christian, may be found. So the Roman Craessi, Nasones, &c. names, as in other Nations, but as they giue him some name of distincti∣on by his height, fatnesse, or other peculiar accidents. The King warreth with his neighbours: he is descended of the Libyan people Bardoa. For maintenance of his Warres hee will giue great prices for Horses, exchanging fifteene or twentie slaues for one, which slaues he tooke from his enemies. When I was in this Kingdome, I found there many Merchants that were wearie of this traffique, because they stayed for their slaues till the King returned from his Warres. Yet the King seemes to be rich: all his Horse-furniture, Stirrops, Spurres, Bridles, Bitts, were of Gold; and his di∣shes, Platters, or whatsoeuer he did eat or drinke in: yea, his chaynes for his Dogges were for the most part of most fine Gold. He hath many, both white and blacke peo∣ple, subiect to him. Gaoga bordereth Westward on Borno, and thence trendeth to Nubia, betweene the Desarts of Setta on the North, and another Desart confining on a winding crooke of Nilus, about fiue hundred myles square. It hath neither Ciuilitie, Letters, nor Go∣uernment. The inhabitants haue no vnderstanding, especially they which dwell in the mountaines, who goe naked in the Summer time, their priuities excepted. Their
houses are made of boughs which easily take fire. They haue store of cattell. A hun∣dreth yeares before Leo's time they were brought in subiection by a Negro slaue, who first slew his Master, and by helpe of his goods made preyes in the next Regions, ex∣changing his captiues for horses of Egypt: and so became King of Gaoga. His Ne∣phewes Sonne Homara then reigned, and was much respected by the Soldan of Cai∣ro. Leo was at his Court, and found him a man passing liberall. Hee much honored all that were of the linage of Mahomet. The Nubae in old times were many Kingdomes, as Strabo Strabo.l 17. affirmeth, not subiect to the Aethiopians: and were then Nomades, or wanderers, and robbers. As it is now taken (Iohn Leo being our Author) Nubia stretcheth from Gaoga vnto Nilus, hauing the Egyptian confines on the North; and the Deserts of Goran on the South. They cannot saile out of this Kingdome into Egypt. For the Riuer Nilus, whiles it is couetous of largenesse, looseth his deepnesse, and couering certaine plaines, becom∣meth so shallow that both men and beasts may wade ouer. Dangala is their chiefe Towne, and hath ten thousand Families, but ill built, their houses being chalke and straw. The Inhabitants with their traffique to Cairo become rich. There is in this Kingdome great store of Corne and Sugar, Ciuet, Sandall; and Io∣rie. They haue a strong poison, one graine whereof, giuen to ten persons, will kill them all in a quarter of an houre, and one man, if hee alone take it, presently. An ounce hereof is sold for a hundred Ducats. It is not sold but to strangers, which first take their oath that they will not vse it in their Country. And if any sell thereof secret∣y, it costs him his life: for the King hath as much for custome as the Merchant for price. Some G. ot Bed. Portugals trauelling through Nubia saw many Churches ruined by the A∣rabians, and some Images. The Iewish and Mahumetan superstition haue there al∣most preuailed. In old time they had Bishops sent them from Rome, which by meanes of the Arabians was after hindred. The Nubian King warreth with the Inhabitants of Goran, called Zingani; who speake a language that none else vnderstand; and with others in the deserts, on the other side of Nilus, towards the Red Sea, whose language seemes to be mixt with the Chaldaean, and resembles the speech of Suachen, in the Country of Prester Iohn. They are called Bugiha, and liue very miserably. They had once a Towne on the Red Sea, called Zibid, whose Port answereth directly to that of Zidem, which is forty miles from Mecca. This Zibid for their robberies was destroyed by the Sultan. Ortels Ortel. Theat. saith, that in Nubia they were sometimes Christian, and now are scarcely of any re∣ligion at all. They sent into Prester Iohns Country for Priests, when Aluares F.luares.  c.30.ch 137. was there, to repaire their almost-ruined Christianity, but without effect. Sanutus Stus apud Maginut. reckons here other Kingdomes, Gothan, Medra, Dauma, whereof be∣cause we haue little but the names, I can write nothing. Now if any would looke that wee should here in our discourse of the Negro's as∣signe some cause of that their black colour: I answere, that I cannot well answere this question, as being in it selse difficult, and made more, by the variety ncde. a∣pud Strabode. lib.15. of answeres, that others giue hereunto. Some alledge the heat of this Torrid Region, proceeding from the direct beames of the Sunne; And why then should all the West Indies which stretch from the one Tropike to the other, haue no other people? except a few in Quareca, which haply were not naturalls of the place. And if this were the cause; why should Africa yeeld white people in Melinde, and neare the Line, blacke, at the Cape of Good hope in fiue and thirtie? Some leaving the hot impressions in the Aire, attribute it to the drynesse of the earth: as though the Libyan Deserts are not more drie, (and yet the people no Negro's) and as though Niger were here dryed vp. Some, to the hidden qualitie of the soile; And why then are the Por∣tugalls Children and Generations white, or Mulatos at most, that is tawnie, in St. Thomez and other places amongst them, and the Inhabitants of Melinde, Ma∣dagascar,
and other places, in the same height, in and adioyning to Africa? Some a∣scribe it (as Herodotus) to the blacknesse of the Parents sperme or seede; And how made they the search to know the colour thereof, which if it hath (a thing by others denyed) by what reason should it imprint this colour on the skinne? Some ascend a∣boue the Moone, to call some heauenly constellation and influence into this consisto∣rie of Nature; And there will I leaue them: yea, I will send them further to him that hath reserued many secrets of nature to himselfe, and hath willed vs to content our selues with thinges reueiled. As for secret thinges, both in Heauen and Earth, they belong to the Lord our God, whose holy name be blessed for euer, for that he hath reueiled to vs thinges most necessarie, both for body and soule, in the thinges of this life, and that which is to come. His in comprehensible vnitie, which the Angells with couered faces in their Holy, holy, holy. hymnes resound and Laude in Trinitie, hath pleased in this varietie to diuersifie his workes, all seruing one humane nature, infinitely multi∣plyed in persons, exceedingly varied in accidents, that wee also might serue that Vns & si di∣cipotest vnissi∣muss.

RELATIONS OF THE REGIONS AND RELIGI∣ONS IN AFRICA. OF AeTHIOPIA, AND THE AFRICAN ILANDS; AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS. THE SEVENTH BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of Aethiopia Superior, and the Antiquities thereof. OVT of Nubia we needed neither Palinurus helpe, nor Charn, to set vs on the Aethiopian Territorie: the Sea is farre distant, and the Riuer Nilus which parteth them, (whether loth to mixe his fresh wa∣ters, with the Seas saltnesse, or fearing to fall downe those dreadfull The falls of Nilus downe from steepe Rocks. Cataracts, or dreading the mul∣titude of pits, which the Aegyptians make in his way to intrap him) here sheweth his vnwillingnesse to passe further forward, and distracted with these passions, hath almost lost his channell, diffusing himselfe in such lingring and heartlesse manner, as man and beast dare here insult on his waters, and I also haue aduentured to take the aduantage of these shallowes, and wade ouer into this anciently renowned Aethiopia. The name Aethiopia came from Aethiops, Aethiopia di∣cta à Coryneta, Aethiope Vulca∣ni, F.N. Com. l. 2. the sonne of Vulcan: before, it had beene called Aetheria, and after that Atlantia. Lidyat.in e∣mend. Temp. Lydiat deriueth Aethiopia of Ai, and Thebets, the land of, or beyond Thebais, which was called Aegyptus Superior, next to Aethiopia. Chytraeus saith, it is deriued of splendeo, and  visus; of the Sunnes burning presence. Two Aethiopia's are found in Afrikes as Plie Plim. l.5.c.8. witnesseth out of Homer (so ancient is the diuision) the Easterne and Westerne. And this partition is by some still followed, as namely by Osor.de rebut gest.Emanuelis.lib 4. Osorius. Others
diuide the same into the Asiatike and African: Author here of is Heredotus Herodot.l.7. in his Po∣lymnis, which reckoneth two sorts of Aethiopians in Xerxes huge Armie; the Easterne, mustered vnder the Indian Standards; the other, of Africa by themselues, differing from the former in language, and their curled haire. Eusebius Euseb. Chron. in A. hl. 3580. mentioneth Aethio∣pians neare the Riuer Indus. And to let passe Pausanias Pausan. l.6.in fine. his search among the Seres, or Philostratus Philostrat.l.3. devit. Ap. at Ganges, for some Asian Aethiopians; the Scriptures seeme to mention an Aethiopia in Asia. For Cush, the Sonne of Cham, (of whom Iosephus Ioseph. Antiq.I.c.6 saith the Aethiopians called themselues, and were called by others, Chusaei) was Author, not only of the Ethiopians in Africa, but of many peoples of Arabia also in Asia, as Moses Gen. 10 Vide Annot. Tremel. & Iun. relateth. And hence perhaps it was that Miriam Num.12.& Exod.2. and Aaron contended with Moses for his wife Zippora, because shee was an Ethiopian. And yet was shee a Midianite: but called an Ethiopian, in respect of the Neighbour-hood which Mi∣dian had to Aethiopia Orientalis, as F. Vatablus. in Num. 12. Vatablus obserueth out of the Iewish writers, or for that Midian is also assigned to Ethiopia, taken in larger sense, as saith Genebr. Chron. Pag. 71. Genebrard. Iunius saith, because the Midianites dwelt in that Region which was assigned to Cush. Saint Augustine Aug. de Mi∣rabil.sac.Scri∣pture.l.1. affirmeth, that the Region Northwards from the red Sea, and so euen to India was called Aethiopia Orientalis. This distinction is still acknow∣ledged by later F Ribera. in sophon.c.3. Lira n Postill. Calui in Cō∣ment. Num. 12. Chiraeus in Ono∣viastico. Writers. And therefore it is needlesse to fetch Moses a Wife out of Ethiopia beneath Egypt, to interprete that place. For so Iosephus Iosep.Ant.l.2 , as we shall after see, telleth of a Wife which Moses in his prosperitie, before his flight, married from thence. This obseruation is very necessary, because the Scriptures often mention Ethio∣pia, when no part of Africa can be vnderstood Gibbins. in Gen. 2.q.6. v.5. , as Genes. 2. 13. where one of the Riuers of Paradise is sayd to compasse the whole land of Cush, or Ethiopia. And so in other places, Cush, or Aethiopia. Learned Iunius Iun.in Gen.2 Praelectionib. obserueth, that Cush is either a proper name as Genes. 10. or common to the people that came of him: It is also a name attributed to the three Arabia's, to the two (African) Ethiopia's, and to all the Southerne tract by the Persian Gulfe. Leauing now that Asian Ethiopia, which alreadie wee haue handled vnder other names, wee will now proceede in our African iourney, where wee finde in Ptolomie Ptol.l.4.c.6.& 7. not so exact description thereof, as in later Geographers, being then in the greatest part vnknowne. Maginus Maginus. maketh Ethiopia to containe two of those seuen parts, whereinto he diuideth Africa: one of which he calleth Aethiopia Superior, and Inte∣rior, which for the most part is subiect vnto the Christian Prince, called in Europe Priest or Prester Iohn: the other, Inferior and Exterior, is all that Southerly part of A∣frica, which was not knowne to the Ancients. This doth not altogether agree with Homers Hom.Odys. in initio. diuision, (whose Geographi Strabo Strabo.l.1.Pertotum. hath so largely trauersed and admired.) For how could Homer, or any in his time attaine to the knowledge of those remote parts? Neyther yet may we reiect that renowned Poet, seeing this partition may serue vs now in the better discouerie of places, where wee may reckon all that to the Westerly Ethiopia, which from Guinea stretcheth to the Cape of Good hope: and thence to the Red Sea Northwards, to the Easterly; Nilus, and a line from the head thereof vnto the aforesaid Cape, being the Arbiter in this diuision. But to let passe this curiositie in caruing, when all is like to be eaten, we will beginne at Ethiopia vnder Egypt, and so take the Country in our way, going from the Red Sea, till hauing doubled the Cape, we come from the Abas∣sine Christians to those of Congo on the Ethiopian Ocean. Aethiopia sub Aegypto, (so the Geographers Ptol.l.4.c.7. Dom. Niger. Aphric.com.4. call this part) hath on the North, Egypt; on the West, Libya Interior; on the South, Aethiopia Agisimba; on the East, the Red and Barbarian Seas, to the Promontory Raeptum, which Ortelius Ortel. Thesau. placeth about Quiloa, Porie Mercat.Tab.Vniuersalis. Porie before Leo. calls it Quili∣manci: Mercater Ortel. Theat. Moginus. Description of the World. interpretes Magala. The Abissine Empire, is by our late Writers entended further, receiuing for the Southerne limits, the mountaines of the Moone; and for the Westerne, the Kingdome of Congo, the Riuer Niger, and Nubia: and therefore containeth Aethiopia sub Aegypt, and besides Trogloditica, Cinnamomi∣fera Regio, and part of the inner Libya.
True it is, that the Great Neguz his titles comprehend thus much, yet rather (say some) as a monument of what hee hath had, then an euidence of what he hath: The Turkes in the North, the Moores on the West, and others otherwhere circumcising this circumcised Abissine: and now according to G.Bo.Ben.Io.di Barros. Boterus and Barrius, the Lake Bar∣cena is the center of his Dominion. But euen still Friar F.I.ys. hist.or. de Etiopia. Luys de Vrreta, giues him both all before named and more. The name Abissine or Abassine, which is giuen to this Region, Niger D.Niger. deriueth from the Egyptian word Abases, which (Strabo Strabo.l.17. repor∣teth) they gaue to all inhabited places compassed with great Deserts, and situate there∣in, in manner as the Ilands in the Sea: three of which Abases, he saith, were subiect to the Egyptians. To take now some exacter view of these parts; leauing Vide Mun∣ster. in fine 6.lib. those Iewish monstrous fables of Monsters of threescore and ten cubits, & their great lies of the little Pigmey∣Christians, with such other stuffe, fit for them to write, who are iustly credulous of 2.Thes.2.12. lies because they beleeued not the Truth: let vs see what others haue written, both of the people and place, and first of the first, and most ancient Relations. The Cataracts or falls of Nilus, which separate Aethiopia from Egypt, are by the most Authors reckoned two, the greater & the lesse: Stephanus addeth a third at Bon∣chis, an Aethiopian Citie. These are Mountaines which encroch vpon the Riuer, and with their lostie loobes and vndermining trecherie, hauing drawne vp the earth, which should afford him a channell, into their swelling and ioynt conspiracie, as with a mixt passion of feare and disdaine, make the waters in their hast and strife ouerthrow them∣selues downe those steepe passages: the billowes bellowing and roaring so terribly with the fall, that the inhabitants (as some This reporateth Cicero in So scip. & cals these falls Ca∣tadupe. affirme) which dwell neare, are thereby made deafe: and the Riuer amazed and dizzie, whirles it selfe about, forgetting his tribute to Neptune, till forced by his owne following waters, he sets, or rather is set forward on his iourney. They are Iean. Bermu∣desius in Legat. Aethiopica. now called Catadhi, which signifieth Noise, of those dreadfull and hi∣deous out-cries which there are caused. Betwixt these falls and Meroe, Strabo Strabo.l.17. pla∣ceth the Troglodytae, of which we haue alreadie spoken: and the Blemmyes, Nubae, and Megabari. They are Nomades, without Towne or habitation, and addicted to robbery. Procopius Procop.de Bello Persico.l.1 testifieth, that these were accustomed to doe much damage on the Roman consines: and therefore Dioclesian brought them out of their barren Ter∣ritories, and gaue them Elephantina, and the Region adioyning for habitation, com∣municating to them the Roman rites and superstitions, and built the City Philas, in hope of future friendship. Caelum non animum; they changed the soile not the soule, but were no lesse iniurious to Oasis, and other the Roman subiects. They worshipped some Gods, borrowed of the Grecians; Isis, and Osis, of the Egyptians; and Priapus. The Blemmyes also offered humane sacrifices, with cruell inhumanity, to the Sunne, till Iustinians time, who tooke away those bloudy deuotions. As for the tale that those Blemmyes wanted heads, and had their eyes and mouths in their breasts, the Authors had either no eyes to see the truth, or more head then they should to deuise lyes: as we may say of other shapelesse and monstrous shapes of people, which Plin.l.5.c.8.& 6.c.29. Solinus, cap.39. Plinie and So∣linus, out of other Authors report, to inhabite these vnknowne parts: some wanting lips, some nostrills, some tongues, or mouthes, &c. indeede all wanting truth. Rather would I counsaile the studious of Geographie, to learne the names of the Peoples and Nations of these Regions, of Plinie and Solinus: which because we haue but names of them, I forbeare to name. Meroe doth inuite me to a longer entertainement, being an Iland which Nilus with louely embraces claspeth about, according to Iosephus and Cedrenus, sometimes called Saba, as now also the Abissines name it; the Egyptians call it Naule Babe; the inhabitants, Neube; our Maps, Guegere; to which Theuet addeth more Iovy, Girave,  &c. Opiniones: ege pad Otilium in Thes , if not more then truth. The Iland, after Helindor.hist.Aethiopica, l.10.Porie describes this Hād in his notes before Leo. Heliodorus (the Bishop of Tricca) his description, is three square, each of which triangle limits are made by three Riuers, Astaboras, and Asasoba; (Strabo calls it Astapus, & Astosabus) this from the South, that from the East) drowning their names & waters with Nilus; it is in length 3000. furlōgs, in bredth 1000
plentifull of Elephants, Lyons, Rhinocerotes, Corne, and Trees, besides her hidden treasures, and mines of yron, brasse, siluer, gold, and salt. It hath also Heben wood, as Lucan Lucaus singeth, Laetacomis Hebeni. It receiued that name Niger. com. Aph.. of Meroe, sister of Cambyses, or after Eusebius Eusebius, of Merida, the mother of Chenphris, King of Egypt. They worshipped a Barbarian God, and besides Pan, Hercules. and Isis. Strabo l.17. It was before called Saba, th Ioseph. Ant. l.2. They cast their dead into the Riuer, others reserued them at home in glasse shrines, others in ear∣then receptacles buried them neare to their Temples. They esteemed them for Gods, and sware by them. They ordayned him King, who excelled in strength, or in person, or in husbandrie of cattell, or in wealth. Their Priests enioyed the chiefe ranke of ho∣nour, who sending their Herald or Messenger, enioyned the King his death, and set vp an other in his roome. At length a certaine King abolished this custome, and rush∣ing with his armed Souldiers into their Temple, where was a golden Chappell, slew all those Priests. This was at Meroe the head City of the Iland, where (Pausanias Pusanias.l.1 saith) they shewed the Table of the Sunne, and that they were the iustest men of all the Aethiopians. Concerning that Table, and the expedition of Cambyses into these parts, Herodotus Herod-Tha∣lia. l.3. relateth: He affirmeth, that Cambyses designed at once three inuasions; against the Carthaginians, the Ammonians, and Macrobians (all in Africa.) These last haue their names of their long liues, which they draw forth farre beyond the vsuall course. Hee placeth them on the South shores of Africa, but Mela Pomp.Mel. l.3.c.10. in Meroe: Seneca, Plinie, and Solinus beyond. That Table of the Sunne, Herodotus and Mela, thus describe. Neare to the Citie was a place alwaies furnished with variety of rosted meates, there set in the night by the Magistrates, and eaten on the day by such as listed, and therefore of this open feasting, called the Sunnes table: whom the ignorant people also thought to be the Cater of these dainties. Cambyses sent an Embassage vnto the King with presents, but principally to espie the Country: whom the Aethiopian requited with a Bow, and bad that the Persians should then inuade the Macrobians, when they were able to shoote in such bowes: thanking GOD that hee was contented with his owne. And because he had sent him golden chaines, hee asked to what vse they were, they said, for ornaments; he answered with smiling, thinking them to bee chaines for pu∣nishment, That he had stronger fetters then those. The like account hee made of his purple Robes, ointments, and wine: and asked further what the Persians eate, and when they told him bread made of wheat, (the nature whereof they declared) and withall, that the oldest Persians exceeded not fourescore yeares; hee said, that it was no maruell of their short life, that fed vpon dung: neither could they liue so long, were it not for that drinke of wine which they vsed; It was not extraordinarie Valer. Max.l.3.c.14. there to attayne to a hundred and twentie yeares, their meat was boiled flesh, and their drinke milke. He brought them to a Fountaine, wherein being bathed they smelled as of Violets, it was so subtle that nothing could swimme thereon, not wood, or other ligh∣ter matter: this water was supposed to lengthen their liues. He brought them also to the Prisons, where they saw many manacled and bound with chaines of gold. Lastly, he shewed them their Sepulchres made of glasse, in this manner. After they haue embalmed the dead corps, they annoynt it with a kinde of pargetting mortar, and then put it in a case or coffin of glasse, through which it shineth, and is apparant without any ill sauour. This they keepe one yeare in the house, offering thereto Sa∣crifices, and the first fruits of all thinges: and then carrie it out of the Citie. Thus farre Herodotus. Wherein, that which some penny-father would most admire, their golden fetters, how common and rife is it in an other sort with vs? euery couetous miser, manacling, fettering, strangling himselfe with his gold, in shew his ornament, in affect his God, in effect his Deuill, Iaylour, chaines, and hell. The Macrobiy (Mela addeth) vsed brasse for honour, gold for punishments. Of the table of the Sunne before mentioned, thus writeth Frier Luys de Vrreta, Luys de Vr.Hist. de la E∣tiopiae.l.prime.c.2. in that his large historie, which he hath composed in Spanish, of Aethiopia: that the King in a curious brauerie & sumptuous vanitie, caused there to be set by night in a certaine
field store of white bread, and the choisest wines, hanged also on the trees; great varie∣tie of Fowles, rost and boiled, and set on the ground, Mutton, Lamb, Veale, Beefe, with many other dainties ready dressed. Trauellers and hungrie persons which came hither and found this abundance, seeing no body which prepared, or which kept the same, ascribed it to Iupiter Hospitalis his bountie & hospitality, shewing himselfe a Protector of poore trauellers: and called this field the Table of the Sunne. The report hereof pas∣sed through the world, and brought many Pilgrims from farre Countries, to visit the same. King Cambyses sent his Embassadors to see it: Plato, the Prince of Philosophers hauing trauelled through Asia as farre as Caucasus, and gone also to the Brachmanes, to see and heare Hiarchas in a Throne of gold, amongst a few Disciples, disputing of Natures mysteries, and discoursing of the Starres and Planets, & returned by the Per∣sians, Babylonians, Arabians, and other Nations, entred into Aethiopia, led with de∣sire to see this renowned Table, and to eate of those delicacies. The Aethiopians, since their Christianitie in zealous detestation of Idolatrie, will not so much as name this field, and these ancient rites, and giue in charge to the Priests at this day, that they handle not, or treat of the like vanities, because they were inuentions of Idolaters. Cae∣lius Cael. Rhod.l.10. Rhodiginus affirmeth, That this Table of the Sunne grew into a prouerbe to signi∣fie a house well furnished and prouided. Thus farre Frier Luys. Of the Pillar of Semiramis is before spoken out of the relation of Xenophon de Ae∣quivocis: concerning which, and his other Companions, and Brethren, howsoeuer Posseninus, Goropius, and others, doe reproue Annius for abusing the world with those glorious Titles Beros.Metasthencs. Cato, Mar.c,&c. and ancient names, and proue them to be counterfait: yet, in my minde that of Xenophon seemeth to sauour of some true antiquitie, and that more then others of the same edition. In that pillar, consecrated to the memorie of Ninus, the inscription testifieth, that Cush or Cuz was the Aethiopian Saturne; as Cham, the E∣gyptian; and Nimrod, the Babylonian. When Cush was dead F.Luys l.x.c.3 , they say, Regma his sonne succeeded in the Aethiopian Kingdome, and after him Dodan: after whose time is no record of certaine succession. Diodorus saith, they chose him which was most comely of Personage for their King. Memnon is chanted by Homer and the Poets, which lost his life at Troy in defence of Priamus and was (some say) King of Aethio∣pia. Of the speaking image of Memnon, yee haue seene in our Egyptian relations. As for the wife of Moses. whereof Iosephus Ios.Ant.l.2. Zon.Annal.to.1. saith, that the Aethiopians hauing o∣uer-runne, and almost subdued Egypt, and none daring to make head against them, Moses (whom Thermutis, Pharaeohs Daughter, had brought vp) was chosen Generall of the Egyptian Armie, which he conducted into Aethiopia, and cōming to the siege of Saba, Tharbis the Aethiopian Kings, daughter fell in loue with him, and sent her seruants to entreat of a marriage with him: which he accepted, vpon condition of de∣liuering the Towne vnto him; and that being done, married her: all this seemeth ra∣ther to be a Iewish fable, thinking hereby to credit their Law-giuer, then agreeing to Moses, the Truth, and Scripture; and might happily arise from that speech, that Moses Num.12.1. his wife was an Aethiopian; of which we haue spoken alreadie. Neither is it likely that Moses would accept of Treason for the dowrie with his wife, sealed with the bloud and ouerthrow of her Countrey and Citizens. And yet from hence doe some deriue the originall of their Nation. After the father of this supposed Thar∣bis, Derianus is said to raigne, who valiantly withstood Bacchus (which is thought to be Osiris, the Aegyptian King, and after, their God) when he inuaded Aegypt with an Armie. Diodorus mentioneth Actisanes, a King of Aethiopia. Cepheus also is numbred in that royall Catalogue: but of all, Ganges Suidas. was most famous, who with his Aethiopian Armie passed into Asia, and conquered all as farre as the Riuer Gan∣ges, to which he left that name, being Plut.de Flum. before called Chliaros. He conquered as farre also to the West, vnto the Atlantike Ocean, and gaue name to the Countrey of Gui∣nea; which name, some F. Luys. say, is corrupted of Gangina, the name it had receiued of Ganges. These things are written by some, and I will not sweare for the truth, as safe∣ly we may doe for that which the Scripture mentioneth of some of their Kings, in the daies of Asa and Hozekiab, Kings of Iuda: whose puissance then was such, that 2. Chron. 14.9 Zerah
brought into the field a million of men: and Tirrhaa was corriuall vnto proude and 2.King.19. blasphemous Sennacherib, in sute for the Monarchie of the world. Before that time the Aethiopians had warred vnder Shishak King of Egypt, whom somem take for Se∣sostris. The Babylonians in Nabuckodonosors time conquered Egypt and Aethiopia, as Lauat.in Ez. 300 Est.8. some expound the prophecie of Ezechiel. And the Persian Empire extended from India to Aethiopia. Of the historie of the Queene of Saba, we shall haue more cause to speake afterwards. Some thinke P.Mart in . R.g. that shee came from Arabia where the Sabeans inhabite: Others Iosep. Gssa, comestor, Iu∣nis, &c. bring her from hence, and say, that shee was an Aethiopian. The mention of her and of Candace (which name Plinie Plin.l.6.c.29. saith continued to the Aethio∣pian Queenes in many successions) hath made some Mat Drisse.atio Lipsie bauita. thinke (as it seemeth) that Aethiopia was gouerned only by Queenes. But let vs obserue further concerning their rites and ancient customes, as diuers Authors haue related the same. CHAP. II. A continuation of the Aethiopian Antiquities, and of the Queene of Saba. HELIODORVS in his Historie (which although for the substance it be fained, as a loue-discourse, yet must hold resemblance with thinges done) and for the variety and conceit thereof, commended by that learned Phil. Melanct. in Epist.cd Ope∣rinum. German Philip, and by our English Sr Ph.Sidney. Philip (the soule of Poesie) mitated in his Arcadia, telleth of Hydaspes his Aethiopian King, that after his victorie at Syene, and hauing there performed his deuotions, and seene their Niloscopium (like to that at Memphis, and now at Cairo) and enquired the originalls of their feasts, and holy rites done in honour of that Riuer: when Heliod.histor. Aethiop.l.9 et 10 he came to the Cataracts, he sacrificed to Nilus, and the Gods of the Borders. He then sent messengers to the Wiseen, whom he calleth Gymnosophists, which are the Kings Counsellours, at Meroe, to certifie them of his victory, and to call a publike assembly wherein to gratifie the Gods for the same with sacrifices & solemne pomps, in the field consecrated to the Sunne, the Moone, and Bacchus. Persina, the Queene, deliuered those letters to the Gymnosophists, who dwelt by themselues in a Groue, con∣secrated to Pan; and before they would giue answere, consulted with the Gods by praier, and then Sisimures the chiefe of them promised all should be fulfilled. The Sa∣crifices were to bee done to the Sunne and Moone. and therefore, except Persina the Queene, which was Luna's Priest, no woman for feare of contaminating the Holies of those Pure and Bright Deities, might bee present. Hydaspes was Priest of the Sunne. Much preparation was made of Beasts for their Hecatombe's, and much concourse of people crossing the Riuer in those boats of Canes or Reedes. There was presented the Images of their Gods, Memnon, Perseus and Andromeda: and nigh to them sete the Gymnosophistae. Three Altars were erected; two ioyntly to the Sunne and Moone; a third to Bacchus by himselfe, to him they offered all sorts of Beasts; to Sol, white Chariot-horses; to the Moone, a yoke of Oxen. And when all things were ready, the people with shouts demanded the sacrifice, which vsually was accustomed for the health of their Nation. That was, some of the strangers taken in the warres, to be of∣fered: First, triall Our English and the Ger∣man Histories mention the like clearing of adulterie, by going with bare feete on burning plow∣share. Bale. was made by spits of gold, heated with fire, brought out of the Temple, whether the captiues had euer knowne carnall copulation: for treading on the same with their bare feet, such as were pure Virgins receiued no harme, others were scorched. These were offered in sacrifice to Bacchus; the other, to those purer Deities. These thinges haue I here inserted, not as done, but as like to such thinges, which among the Meroites vsed to be done, and agreeing with the generall deuotions of those Ethiopians. Philostratus Philot.de∣vta Apaltonu.l.6.c.4. reporteth like matters of their Gymnosophits and of the Groue where they kept their generall consultations: otherwise, each of them by themselues a-part, obseruing their studies and holies. They worshipped Nilus. inten∣ding
in their mysticall interpretation the Earth & the Water. They entertained stran∣gers in the open aire. Thespesion was then (in Apollonius his time) chiefe of their society. At his command, an Elme did speake. They held the immortality of the soule. The Aethiopians sacrificed to Memnon and to the Sunne. Lucian, after his scoffing manner gratulates the Aethiopians that fauour, which Iu∣piter vouchsafed them, in going on feasting, accompanied with the rest of the Gods, and that twelue daies together, if Homer Hom.Iliad.& Luciā.de sacrif. reckoned truly. But more Idem de A∣strologia. seriously else∣where he vnsoldeth that mysterie, shewing that the Aethiopians were inuenters of A∣strologie, helped therein by the clearnesse of the skie in that Region, and like tempera∣ture of the seasons. Of them the Egyptians learned, and furthered that science. In his Treatise Idem de Sul∣tatione. of Dancing, he affirmeth, that the Aethiopians vsed their haire in steed of a quiver, and neuer drew arrow from thence to shoot in battell, but with a dancing iesture. Diodorus D.Si.l.4.c.1. Siculus telleth, that the Ethiopians were accounted most ancient of all other men: and that not only Humanitie, but Diuinitie, was borne and bred amongst them: solemnities, pompes, holies, and religious rites, were their inuention. And therefore (saith he) Homer brings in Iupiter, feasting with the Ethiopians. The reward of their piety, was the immunitie of their region from forraine conquests. Macrob.in Smn.Scip. l.2. cap.10. Macro∣bius interprereth Iupiters banket with the Ethiopians of that Ocean, which Antiquitie imagined to be vnder all the Torrid Zone, that the fiery bodies of the srarres, supposed to be nourished with moisture, might there quench their thirst. So would those good men drowne a great part of the African and American world, in hospitality to the Starres, by their imagined middle-earth Ocean: which experience hath now suffici∣ently confuted. Cambyses attempted and lost his Armie; and Semiranits entred, but soone retur∣ned: Hercules and Dionysisus ouer-ranne the rest of the World, the Ethiopians either for their deuotion they would not, or, for their strength, could not conquere. The Egyptians, some say, were Colonies from hence; yea, Egypt it selfe the dregs of that soile, which Nilus carryeth out of Ethiopia. The Egyptians borrowed of the Ethiopians, to esteeme their Kings as Gods, and to haue such care of their Funeralls, the vse of Statues, and their Hieroglyphicali letters. Pierius Pier. Hiero∣glyphica. , and others, haue written thereof  large. Their best men they chose for their Priests: and hee among them, who, when the God is carried about, shall bee pos∣sessed with some Bacchanal furie, is chosen King as by diuine appointment, and is of them worshipped as a God. His gouernement is gouerned by Lawes. They doe not put a Malefactor to death, but an Officer is sent to him with the signe of death The like is vsed in Japan. , whereupon hee goeth home and slayeth himselfe. One would haue sled out of his Country; but the mother of the malefactor killed him, because he would not after his Country manner kill himselfe. The Priests in Meroe exercised this authority (as it before said) ouer their Kings, and would send them word that the Oracles of the Gods commanded them to dye, neither might they reiect the diuine dispensation: and thus with arguments, not with armes, they perswaded them to a voluntarie death. But in the time of Ptolemaeus Secundus, King of Egypt, King Ergamenes well skilled in the Greeke sciences, and Phi∣losophie, reiected that superstition. They say, that the custome yet (till Drodorus time) remaineth, that if the King be maimed, or by some accident want any member, his Courtiers also will depriue themselues of the same. Yea, when the King died, his friends thought it good fellowship to die with him, esteeming that death glorious, and the surest testimony of friendship. The Ethiopians Diod.Sit.Strabo.l.17. dwelling nearer to Arabia, armed their women in their wars, till they attained to a certaine age: the most of which ware a ring of brasse in their lip. They which dwelt further vp into the Country, were diuersly conceited of the Gods. for some they thinke immortall, as the Sunne, Moone, & the World: some mortall, as Pan, Hercules, Iupiter, for their vertues exalted to that dignitie. Strabo telles it in the singular number, that they thought that God to be immortall, which is the cause of all
things. Their mortall God was vncertaine, and wanted name: but they most common∣ly esteemed their Kings, and Benefactors, for Gods. Some that inhabite nearer the Line worshipped no Gods: and were much offended with the Sunne, and hiding themselues in the Fennes, cursed him when he did rise. These things you may reade gathered out of Diodorus, and Strabo, Laurentij Cor∣uini Geograp. lo Bocmus de morib. gentium. Draudus in So∣linum. Fr. Tha∣mara de las Co∣stumbras de to∣das las gentes. in Coruinus, Boemus, Draudius, and Thamara, with some o∣ther additions. Sardus saith, Sardus demorib. gentium. l.t.c.10. that the Aethiopians were circumcised: as were also (besides the Iewes, Aegyptians, and Arabians,) the Trogloditae, Macrones, Creo∣phagi, and inhabitants of Thermodoon. As wee haue shewed of the Macrobij, or long∣liued Aethiopians, so there were others called Brachobij, of their shorter liues, wher∣of were reckoned two sorts: the Sidonij, neere to the Red Sea, and the Erembi, which some Raph. Vola∣terianus Geo∣graph. l.12. take for the Troglodytae. They liue not aboue fortie yeares. Plutarch Plutarcide placitis Philoso∣phorum. out of As∣clepiades reporteth the like, saying that they were olde men at thirtie yeares. The same authour Id. de non iras∣cendo. telleth, that they and the Arabians could not endure myce: and that the Per∣sian Magi did likewise, esteeming them creatures odious to God. Alexander Gen. dierum l.2.25. C.30. ab Alex∣andro writeth, concerning the education of their Children, that, the Aethiopians feared their new-borne Infants in the foreheads, to preuent the distillations of Rheumes from the braine. And when they are somewhat growne, they make triall of their forward∣nes, by setting them on the backes of certaine Foules, on which if they sit in their fly∣ing, without feare, they bring them vp very carefully: but if they shrinke and quake with feare, they expose them as a degenerate issue, vnworthy education. Their Letters they wrote not side-waies, after the Greeke or Hebrew manner, but after the present Chinian custome, downewards. They had seuen Characters, euery of which had foure significations. What manner of writing they now vse appeareth in Dam a Goes. Zaga Zabo de fide Aethiopum. Damianus a Goex, or of Zaga Zabo rather, an Aethiopian Bishop, in his Treatise of their Religi∣on, done into Latine by Damianus: but more fully in Iosephus Iof. Scaliger de Emend.l.7. Scaliger de Emenda∣tione Temporum, who hath lent vs a long Tractate in that language and writing, with the same words expressed in Hebrew and Latine Characters, and the interpretation of them also into Latine, in foure seuerall Columnes. He that listeth to reade some Phi∣losophicall speculations of Nature in these Aethiopians, wherein they differ, & where∣fore, from others: let him reade Coelius Cal.R.l.16 c.15.l.9.23. Rhodiginus of that Argument: he saith that they were expert in Naturall Magike. Nicephorus Niceph.Hist. Eccles.l.9.c.18. writes, that Alexander the Great sent Assyrian Colonies into Aethiopia, which many ages after kept their owne lan∣guage, and, like enough, their Religion. The Nations of Aethiopia, which are farre distant from Nilus, are Dom.Niger. said to liue a miserable life. Their life is beastly, not discerning in their lust, Mother, Daughter, or any other name of kindred. Of their auncient ex∣ploites, we haue no continued History. About the time of Christ, it appeareth, that Candace was Queene of Aethiopia.Sho was a manly Virago, as Strabo testifieth, who liued at the same time, and followed Ae∣lius Gallus in this expedition. He forced Candace to send her Embassadours to Augu∣stus for peace, which shee obtained. Sextus Sexti. Vict. Augustus. Victor mentioneth this Aethiopian Embassage. Dioclesian relinquished that part of Aethiopia, which the Romans held be∣yond Egypt, as not able to beare the charges. Iustinian Procop. de Bello Persico.l.1. sent his Embassadours vnto Hellisthaeus, the Aethiopian King, and to Esimiphaeus King of the Homerites, his Arabi∣an neighbour, to aide him against the Persian. This Hellisthaeus had warred against the Homerites, for quarrel of Religion, because they were many of them Iewes, and others Gentiles, himselfe being a Christian: and because they made many forrages into the Christian Countreys. He so farre preuailed, as he made that Esimiphaeus, a Christian, their King: whose yoke they shooke off soone after: and Abram, a slaue, vsurped the State. He had beene seruant to a Romane at Adulis, a Citie of Aethiopia, worthy men∣tion especially in this matter, for the ominous prosperitie of seruants. For the Citie it selfe was built by fugitiue seruants, which ranne from their Aegyptian Maisters: and this Abram a seruant there, obtained to be a King: neither could the Aethiopian with all his might depose him. The like Pauli Dia∣coni Iustinus. embassage to Archetas king of Ethiopia was sent by Instinus for aid against the Persian: both which I mention, to shew the greatnes at that time of his state, nothing comparable notwithstanding to that which after besel them. A∣mong
the Ethiopian Antiquities, Plato testifies, as Orosius Oros.lib.t.c. cites him, that many plagues and vncouth diseases infested, & almost altogether destroyed Ethiopia, about that time that Bacchus in uaded India. If any delight himself in such Legendary draffe as the coū∣terfet Abdias, Abdias Bab. Apostolice hist. libr. 7. set forth by Wolfgangus Lazius, hath in it, touching the Magicians and Enchantments, and some other ceremonies of Ethiopia, I am loth to blot my paper with them: not because we are not certain of the truth (for in others we may be deceiued) but because we are certaine of the errors, so grosse that they may be seene and felt. Maruell that Wolfg. Lazius. Lazius, an historian, would with his Notes illustrate such a hotchpotch of darknes. And yet our countryman Jewell and Harding. Harding, leauing the cleare waters of truth, hath swallowed the same swill, as the Iewell of our Church hath taught him. The Eunuch of Candace was the first Ethiopian Christian, as Luke Act. 8. and Eusebius Eusch.Ec.bist.libr.  Pappus speakes of Thomas, Ma∣th, and Ma∣thias preaching in Ethiopia. do shew. But before we come to their christian conuersion, we are first to declare their conuer∣sion to Iudaisme (if it be true the Ethiopians write) in the time of Salomon. The Ethiopi∣ans hauing liued before a vagrant life, like the Nemades of old; & the Arabians, & other Libyan nations, not far from them in Asia & Africa at this day; Arue the Ethiopian king first fixed a setled abode at Axvms, & made it the royall city, Genebr. chron. pag.118. after whom followed A∣gab, & in the third place, Ghedur or Sabanut, which subdued al Ethiopia, & left the king∣dom to his daughter Makedae that reigned 80 yeres. An. 50 of her reigne she visited Sa∣lomon. After her they reckon these kings til Christs time, Melic, Andedo, Auda, Gigasio, Zangua, Guasio, Antet, Bahara, Canada, Chanze, Endur, Gnaza, Endrath, Chaales, Setija, Aglaba, Anscua, Breguas, Guase, Beseclugna, Baazena, in whose time they say CHRIST was borne. Genebrard setts downe the times of their reigne, which he confesseth, and it self conuineeth to be false. This Queen of Saba before mentioned, is by Ios. Antiquit libr.8.ca.2. Iosephius called Nicaule, the Queen (saith he) of Ethiopia & Egipt. But Zaga Zabo Zaga Zabo E∣piscopus Ethiop. in the Ethiopian hi∣story which he writ, & caused to be done into latine by Damianus a Goes, calls her Ma∣queda, whose history the Ethiopians haue written in a book as big as all Pauls Epistles. The summe of his report is this; She was a worshipper of Idols, as her auncesters had bin, when as Fame filled her ears with the renowne of Salomons name: & then sent a messen∣ger to Ierusalem, to learn the truth, who at his return confirming those former reports, she went her self to visit him. Of him, besides many other things, she learned the Law, & the Prophets. By him she conceiued also a son, of whom she was deliuered in her iourney homewards, & named him Meilech. After 20. yeres education in Ethiopia, she sent him to Salomon his father, to be instructed of him in wisdome, desiring him to consecrate her sonne king of Ethiopia, before the Arke of the Couenant; she ordained also that women should not henceforth inherit, as before had bin accustomed. Salomon did this, & chan∣ged his name to Dauid: & after long instruction, sent him backe to his mother, attended with many noble companions, among whom was Azarias the son of Zadock the priest. This Azarias caused tables to be made like to those in the Ark, & pretending to sacrifice for the good succes of his iourny, went in & stole the tables of the Law, leauing in their roome these later counterfets, which he reuealed not to any, till he came to the borders of Ethiopia. Then Dauid being made acquainted with the fact, daunced for ioy, as his grandfather Dauid had done before the Arke wherin the Tables were inclosed, his peo∣ple making great ioy. His mother resigned to him the Empire, & from that time to this, the kingdome hath passed in a right line, from Candace was the name of diuers Ethio∣pian Queens, contrarie to this report. male to male: circumcision also with the law of Moses hath bin obserued. The Officers which Salomon appointed his son, are still cōtinued in the same families & order; nor may the Emperor chuse thē out of any other stocke then these of the Iews. This long Legend I report, not for the truth, but for that religious conceit wherewith it is accepted in Ethiopia. For who knowes not, that none but the high Priest, & that but once a yere, entred into that holy place, where the Ark was, and Nadabs and Abihu's fire, with other diuine iudgements; Vzzahs touching; and the Bethshemites viewing the Arke at so deare a rate; could not but make dreadfull so dam∣nable an attempt. Besides, we should haue looked for our blessed Sauior out of Ethiopia, where Salomons oires still reigne (if these say true) & not go to Salathiel and Zorobabel, descended of another brother, and therfore further off from the throne of their father Da∣uid, on which Christ was to sit, & to which he was borne, next and apparant heire, euen according to the flesh. And yet doth Genebrard credit these reports, & Baronins also in part
as Luys de Vrreta reporteth, This Luys hath written 3. large books in Spanish, collected (as he saith) out of Don Iuan de Baltasar an Ethiopian of great accompt, who had beene Embassador frō his Mr. Alexander 3. the great Negus, into Persia & other places, & came into Spaine with his licence to imprint his Ethiopian history. Out of him Luys reporteth that the former book, whence Zaga Zabo the Bishop, Embassador to the King of Portu∣gall, had taken those things, is Apocripha: yet so, as that it is true cōcerning that report of Maquedas conception, & the royall descent from thence till these times. The stealing of the tables he denieth; & affirmeth, that the truth was, that Salomon had bestowed on the Queen of Saba a fragment of the tables, which Moses brake in his zeale for the Israelits idolatry with the golden Calfe. For that conception by Salomon, he proueth it by, the E∣thiopian Records, the title of their King, & his armes; which are the same, which the tribe of Iuda gaue, viz. a Lyon rampant, crowned, in a field Or, with this inscription, The Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda hath ouercome. Since they were Christians they haue added to these armes a crose, which the Lyon holdeth in his right foot. And in this right they lay chal∣lenge to Ierusalem for their inheritance. Now for the fragment of the table which Mo∣ses brake, it is receiued for a truth throughout Ethiopia, & it is still preserued in the hill Amara, as the greatest Iewell in the world. Baltasar had often seene and handled it. It seemeth to be of the Chalcedonie stone, shining, & transparent, and is a corner of a square table, the broken edges yet being manifest, with the letters, some broken, some whole, much differing frō the common Hebrew (which Genebrard saith the Iewes in∣uented, thereby to differ from the schismaticall kingdome of the Israelites, of the ten tribes; the Samaritans still retaining the former, as both he and Scaliger affirme.) But these letters cannot be read; for he brought a learned R. Sedechias from Mecca. Iew, skilful in all the Eastern lan∣guages, Persian, Arabike, Indian, Chinois, &c. yet knew thē not. This relique is with such deuotiō admired of the Iewes, that when they passe but within sight of that hill Amara, they prostrate thēselues on the ground with much reuerēce, & for this cause make much of the Ethiopians (whersoeuer they meet them) as a people beloued of God, to whō he hath imparted such a Relique. They Vincent Fer∣rer, a Popish Saint. tell also a tale (I think) of the Queene of Saba, that in her iourney homewards she had a reuelation concerning a peece of wood which she saw, that it should be the same wheron Christ should after die for mankind: wherefore adoring the same with much deuotion & teares, she writ to Salomon thereof, who hid it in the earth 4 Stades, Foure times the height of a man. where the poole of Bethesda was made afterwards, & by vertue therof wrought miracles. But the Ethiopian superstitiō hath fables enough of her own, & needs not the officious help of Romish Saints in this kind. As for that successiō of Iewish officers; Luys denies it, & saith the Iews are no where more hated thē in Ethiopia: & A∣lexander the 3. late Emperor among them, banished all Iewes & Mores out of all his do∣minions. The officers of the Emperor are the sons of the tributary kings his vassals, and the noblest of his subjects. And for the Iews which came with Meilech, or Meilolec, (af∣ter called Dauid) his next successor Iosua (so he cals him) becomming an Apostata, redu∣ced idolatry: & wheras David his father had giuen them one of the Temples dedicated to the Sunne in Mount Amata, to make it an house of Prayer to the God of Israel, casting forth the Idols therin; now in this Iosues daies, some of them returned to Ierusalem, or to other prouinces of Africa, & some inhabited the vtmost parts of Africa, nere the Cape of Good Hope, & Deserts not before inhabited And the said Don Iuan de Baltasar, be∣ing sent by the Emperor into the lāds of Monopopata (so he cals it) & of Galofes, of Bar∣bizin, of Mandinga, & of Zape, which are inhabited of idolatrous Gentiles, hee found a∣mong them some of these Iewes descended of that exiled stocke (as themselues also hold) which had forgotten their Iudaisme, & all knowledge of the scriptures, onely had retained some reliques of it, & abstinence from swines flesh, differing also from those Gentils, in worshipping one God, wheras the other acknowledge One great God, whom they cal Caramus, but worship also Tigers, Lions, Flies, Spiders, Snakes, Lizards, & whatsoeuer first meete them in the morning. These Gentils Gods curse and mans fol∣low the Iewes euery¦where, as the shadow the body. call the Iewes Tabayqueres, and will not admit them to purchase houses, or inheritance, but either vse them as interpre∣ters or factors for Marchants (which is the highest step they can attaine to) or else em∣ploy them in base drudgeries, to be their Porters, slaughter-men, and such like, that they seeme rather slaues to those barbarous Nations, then to enioy any liberty of free-men.
Rightly may those Nations bee called Barbarous, which seeme rather to barke then to speake, & yet they scorne that any should abase them, with the basest of Titles in their opinion to call them Tabayquero, and reuenge it with the death of the wrong doer. In these re∣ports, though there be many things falle yet may some be probably true: let the Reader Iudge. CHAP. III. Of Presbyter Iohn: and of the Priest-Iohns in Asia: whether that descended of these. HAuing now declared the Antiquities of Aethiopia, drawne out of anci∣ent Authors, let vs neerer hand behold, what neerer out times, Authors haue reported thereof. Wherin first we will here insert out of I. Scal de E∣mend. Temp. l.7. Scaligers Annotations, vpon the Aethiopian Ecclefiasticall Calendar or Compu∣tation of times, somewhat remarkable, and fitting to our present pur∣pose. The name (saith hee) of the Christian Aethiopians is not now first made knowne to vs. For their Church not onely at Hierusalem and Constantinople, but at Rome also and Venice, hath had libertie a good while to vse their owne rites. The Portugales, and Francis Aluares haue further discouered them: Before wee onely heard the name of Aethiopia. A wonder it is, that some ages since, Castaneda seemeth al. o to hold that the Ngas is that Presbyter Iohn of Asia; though not of his race.l.1.c.1 their Emperors name was made knowne to vs out of Asia, rather then out of Aethiopia it selfe. Three hundred yeares agoe, the Ethiopian Kings reigned in Asia, especially in Drangiana, the borders of Susiana, India & China, vntill the Tartars dispossessed them of the Asian Empire. For Cingis first, the first Tartar King, slew Vncam, the Aethiopian Emperour: & his posteritie chased the Abissines out of Moin and China, and forced them to flee into Africa. Often haue I maruelled that a people of no knowledge in these times of sea affaires, could at∣chieue so mighty exploits, as to propagate their Empire, from Aethiopia to China. Since that time the knowledge of that Emperour hath come to vs in the name of Prestegiano: which in the Persian tongue (as much now of reckoning in Asia, as the Latine in the West) signifierh, So with vs, the French King is called Christianissmus; the Spaniard, Catholieus: the English, Defē∣der of the faith Apostolike, inferring thereby that hee is a Christian King of the right faith. For Prestegan signifieth Apostles, and Prestegani Apostolicall; Padeschaprestegiani, the King Apostolicall, in Arabian Melich ressuli, in Aethiopian Negusch Chawariawi. Of this greatnes of their Empire, in Asia are witnesses those Aethiopian crosses, which are seene in Giapan, China, and other places. Yea, the Temple of Thomas the Apostle in the Region of Maltapur. see our Historie. l.5. Malabar, hath nothing in it but is Aethiopian, the crosses, building, and name it selfe. It is called; In Ramusius copie it is And∣via, in the La∣tine Auarij. Mar. Polo. l.2. Cap. 27. Ram.20 Hanariya, which in Aethiopian is as much to say, as, Apostle: which Marcus Paulus falsely expoundeth, a Holy-man. (This name in the Author see∣meth to be giuen not to the Church, but to the Apostles himself) Paulus addeth that the remainder of the Christians subiect to Prestegian abode in Tenduch. The neighbou∣ring Arabians call them now Habassi, and we from thence Abissines, or Abassenes: they call themselues Chaldaeans: for their ancient and elegant language, in which their bookes are written, is neere to the Chaldaean and Assyrian. Moreouer, the Eccesiasticall Historie testifieth, and out of the same Nicophorus l.9.c.18, that many Colonies vvere sent out of Assyria into Aethiopia. They are there called Axumitae, of their chiefe citie but by themselues as Aluares affirmeth Chaschumo. More may we say hereafter of their rites and other things worthy of knowledge, in the Institutions Scaligers Ae∣thiopian Grammar. of that tongue which we haue diligently, and methodically written. These words of Scaliger haue made me take some paines in the search of the premisses; for he differeth from the opinion of o∣thers which haue written any thing of Presbyter, or Priest Iohn (as they terme him) in Asia, whom the Tartars subdued. Ortelius Ortelli Theat. in the Mappe of Tartaria. P. Bertius & ddil Geograph. maketh a Presbyter Iohn in Asia, and an other in Africa, if I vnderstand him. As for that Vncam, William de Rubruquis, which trauelled those parts in the morning of the Targar-greatnes, An. 1523. reporteth that one Con Can reigned in Kara-Catay, or blacke Catay, after whose death a certaine Ne∣storian Shepheard (a mighty Gouernour of the people called Yayman, which were Ne∣storian-Christians) exalted himselfe to the Kingdome, and they called him King Iohn, reporting of him ten times more then was true, as is the Nestorians wont. Willi.de Ru∣bruquis tinera∣rium ap. Hak. to.1.Cap.19. For not∣withstanding all their great boasts of this man, when I trauelled along by his territories, there was none that knew any thing of him, but onely a few Nestorians. This Iohn had a brother, a mighty shepheard called Vut, which inhabited three weeks iourny beyond
him: he was Lord of a Village called Cara Carum, his subiects, called Crit or Mer∣kies, were also Nestorians. But their Lord abandoning Christianitie, embraced Idols and reteined with him Priests of the said Idols. Ten or fifteene daies iourney be∣yond his pastures, were the Pastures of Moal, a beggerly Nation, and neere them the Tartars. Iohn dying, this Vut became his Heyte, and was called Vut Can (whom others call Vnc Can) and his droues and stockes ranged vnto the Pastures of Moal. About the same time one Cyngis a Black-Smith in Moal, stole many of Vut This Vut or vncam was cal∣led Prete or Priest as Bote∣rus coniectu∣reth, because he had the crosse borne before him he is said, with no great likeli∣hood of truth, to haue ruled 7. Kingdomes Cans Cattell: who in reuenge with his forces spoiled the Moals and Tartars. They aggreeued, made Cyngis their Captaine, who suddenly brake in vpon Vut, and chased him into Cataya; tooke his Daughter and married her, and had by her Mangu, that was then the Great Can when our Author wrote this. These relations sauour not any such Monarchy as should extend from Aethiopia, to those parts of Asia. M. Paul.l.1.c.24. Paulus telleth that the Tartars were tributaries to this Vmcan (so hee calles him) which, saith he, after some mens opinion signifieth in our language Priest Iohn, but through his tyranny prouoked to rebellion, they vnder the conduct of Cingis, slew Vn∣cam. And afterward he saith that C.52. The Latine Copie wants these things. Tenduc was vnder the subiection of Priest Iohn: but all the Priests Iohns that there reigned after Umcan, were tributarie to the Great Can and in his time reigned one George, who was a Priest and a christian, as were the inhabi∣tants. But he held not so much as the Sir Io'm Mandeuiles sto∣rie of Presbyter Iohn, is fabu∣lous. Priests Iohns had done: & the great Cans did still ioine in affinitie with this family, marrying their daughters vnto these Kings. This George was the fourth after Priest Iohn, and was holden a great Signior. He ruled ouer two Na∣tions, called by some Gog and Magog. by the inhabitants, Vng Happily the Prince before mentioned was cal∣led Vncam of Vng, and Can: for Can signifi∣eth a diumour or ruler. & Mongul, where some were Mahumetans; some Heathens, other Christians. It appeareth by their Histories, that Scaliger was deceiued, to thinke that this Priest Iohn had so large an Empire, see∣ing Rubruquis in the same Age, or sonne after M.P.l.3.c.37 could in his own countrey heare so little of him: and his posteritie in M. Paulus his time, continued tributarie Kings vnder the Tartar. The name Priest was giuen them of that function, which he testifieth, George receiued, and Iohn perhaps of that first Shepheard that vsurped Con Cans estate. To let passe therefore that Presbyter Iohn in the Northeast, we slumble on an other midway be∣twixt that & Aethiopia. For so Ioannes Josi. de Pl. Carp. inerar um ca.5. deplano Carpini (sent Embassadour to the great Can, from Pope Innocent. An. 1246.) and Vincentius Vincentij Bel∣uacensis Spic. historiale l.32. c.10. in his Speculum, tell of the King of India Major, called Presbyter Iohn, being inuaded by the Tartars vnder the leading of Tossut Can, sonne of Cingis, who before had subdued India Minor: Hee by a stratageme acquired his Realme of them. For making mens images of Copper, he set each of them vpon a saddle on horse-back, and put fire within them, placing a man with a paire of bellowes on the horse-backe behinde euery Image. And so with many images & horses in such fort furnished, they marched against the Tartars: and when they were ready to ioyne, by kindling a fire in each Image, they made such a smoke that the Indians wounded & slew many Tartars, who could not see to require them through the smoke: but were forced to leaue that countrey, & neuer after returned. Here now we meet with a new Presbyter Iohn in India Major, which whether he were the same with the Aethi∣opian, let vs a little examine. India is by M. M.P.l.3.c.37 Paulus diuided into three parts, the Lesser, Greater, & Middle; the first of them he boundeth from Ciamba to Mursili, & saith, it had in it eight Kingdomes; the Middle called Abascia, had in it seuen Kingdomes, three whereof were Saraceus, therest Christians. Six of them were subiect to the seuenth. It was told me, saith he, that after their baptisme with water, they vsed another Baptisme with fire, branding three markes on their forehead & both their cheekes. The Saracens vsed one brand from the forehead to the middle of their nose: They warre with the Soldan of Aden, & with the inhabitants of Nubia, & are reputed the best warriours in India. The greater Abdias nomi∣nat Indian quae in Aethiopiam vergit. 1.8. India extendeth from Malabar, to the Kingdome of Chesmacoran, and had in it thirteene Kingdomes. This Abascia by the bordering enemies of Nubia & Aden is apparant to be this Aethiopia where we now are: euen by their brands we may know them: And this the Ancients called India. For Sidonius Sidonius ap. Ortel. in The∣sauro. calleth the Aethiopian Memnones Indians: and Aeltanus Aelionus l.17. animalium. placeth Indians at Astaboras, one of the Riuers of Meroe: Virg. Georg.4. Virgil also brimgeth Nilus out of India. Vsg.. Coloratis, animis denexus ab Indus: which must needs be meant of Aethiopia. Nicephorus Sabellicus Aenead. 10.l.8. reckoneth the Sabeans and Homerites
people of Arabia vnto India. Sabellicus Sabell. Aen. 10.lib.8. complaineth of the confounding of these names India, and Ethiopia, saying, that most men did thinke Ethiopia next to E∣gypt, to be that India, where Alexander ouerthrew Porus. This confusion of names, I thinke, did first grow from confusion of Nations. For as is before obserued out of Eusebi∣us, the Ethiopians arose from the Riuer Indus, & setled their habitation neere to Egypt. Perhaps they brought the Indian name also to these parts. Or else the ignorance of those remote countries might doe it: in which respect, not onely a third part of the olde world, but another new-found world, is named India. Therefore Acosta Ios. Acost. hist. Ind. l.1.c.14. esteemeth In∣dia to be a generall name to all countries which are far off, and strange to vs, although it be properly attributed to the East Indies. Now if any wonder at such an extrauagant discourse of India here, let him know that in our search for Presbyter Iohn, which then was knowne to withstand the Tartarts in Asia, I cannot see how he can be the Abissine or Ethiopian: but rather thinke that when a mighty Christian Prince was found in E∣thiopia, they did imagine him to be that Presbyter Iohn, of which they had heard in Asia; being furthered in this errour by the name, India, which, as is said, did generally compre∣hend both the true India, & this, more truly called Ethiopia. Now for that Presbyter Iohn in India, I take him for some Christian King: for at that time there were many Christi∣ans, as appeareth by Venetes, in manner dispersed throughout Asia: and some, called S. Thomas Christians, remaine in India to this day. Why I thinke it not to agree to the A∣bissine, my reasons besides the former are, the distance of place: all that huge tract of A∣rabia, with the wide seas on each side, separating India from Ethiopia: the vnpassable Deserts by land: No mention in history who should dispossesse them of that India Ma∣ior, where the Tartar had neuer any great power: the Histories Of these In∣dian Histories touching the same times See Linschoten l.1.ca.12. & 27. & G.B.B. which wee haue of those Indian Princes, the Kings of Malabar, of Decamo, the Samorin, &c. are against it: the difference of Religion; for those Indian Christians of S. Thomas are not branded with hote irons, nor circumcised, not agree in other rites with the Ethio∣pian: the Ethio∣pian History challengeth no such large extents to their Empire, except in Africa, where they seate them in a continuall descent, from the time of Salomon, till now, whereas those Presbyter-Iohns had their dwelling and abode in Asia, as their Stories signifie. And further, the name Odoardo Lo∣pez. l.2.vlt. Priest-Iohn is a name vnknowne in Ethiopia, and by ignorant mi∣staking of the Europaeans, applied to that Ethiopian Emperour when first they heard of him, as saith Zaga Zaga Zabode 33. Fide Ethio∣pu. Zabo his Embassadour to the King of Portugall, who reproueth the men of these parts Luys de Vrre∣ta Hist. Eiiop. L 1.c.7. saying that he is named of them Belul, which signifieth Excel∣cellent, or precious, and in the Chaldaean tongue, Ioannes Encoe; which signifieth the same. Sabellieus saith, the Ethiopians called him Gyan; Linschoten affirmeth, Bel Gyan: (Bel signifieth the highest, and Gyan, Lord. But Frier Luys out of Baltasar the Ethiopi∣an, sheweth that in the hill Amara are ancient records, which testifie that from the time of that Queene that came to Salomon, the Emperours haue been called Beldigian, the signification whereof is, a precious stone, or a thing of great value: which Title hath continued to those Emperours, as Pharao to the Egyptians, and Caesar to the Romans, Some also of the Royall bloud (which are vsually kept, as after shall appeare, in the hill Amara) when they are elected to the Empire, if there bee many of that Imperiall issue; take orders & become Priests, not procreating any Children. Such saith he in our times haue beene Daniel the second, Paphnutius, that succeeded to Naum, and Alexander the third his succesour, all which were both Priestes and Kings; and therefore by the Aethiopians which resort to the Holy Sepulcher at Ierusalem, & vsed to speake Greek, were called Priest Beldigian. This by corruption of the name by Merchants, and such as knew not the signification, and also for breuities sake, was pronounced Priest Gian or Iohn. Now for the Priest Iohn in Asia, he tels that when S. Thomas was martyred in In∣dia, the three Mat. 2.l. Magi, who had visited Christ by the leading of a Starre in his Infancie, and had after beene consecrated Bishops ouer their seuerall Kingdomes (you must not deny their royalty) by the Apostle; chose one amongst themselues to be Priest & King, who was called Priest Iohn. If you beleeue not Peter de Natalibus, out of whom the Frier cites this, I should be too much troubled in perswading you. Hee telleth also out of Otho Frisingensis, that about the yeare 1145. one Iohn a Christian, both King and Priest.
Priest, reigning in the furthest parts of the East, warred vpon, and ouercame the Medes, Assyrians. & Persians, and had intended to free Ierusalem out of Saracenicall seruitude, but not finding passage ouer Tigris, was forced to returne. This is like to hee that Pres∣byter Iohn, whose posterity vsed that Stratageme before mentioned against the Tartars. And to him I thinke might fitly agree that Title of Prestegian (easily deflected and alte∣red to Priest. Iohn) whereof you haue heard out of Ioseph Scaliger. I haue seene a Manu∣script Communica∣ted to me, by that industri∣ous and lear∣ned Gentle∣man, Maister Selden, of the inner Temple. in old French, pretended to be a Letter from Prester Iohn, to the Emperor Fre∣derike, wherin is discoursed of the site, greatnes, puissance, wealth, and other rarities of his estate: but finding so many monsters, and vncouth relations therin, I could not be so prodigall of faith or penurious of iudgement, as to value his authoritie at any high rate: wherin Sir Iohn Mandeuill seemes to haue been a lender or borrower, so iustly doe they agree, in disagreeing from both probabilitie and possibilitie of truth: yet both in the one and the other, we may obserue the like situation of Prester Iohns dwelling in these parts of Asia, neere Persia: and that such a multitude of Fables could not but haue some truth for their ground. My conclusion is, that for that name of Prestegian, I like vvell Scaligers interpretation, and thinke that it may agree either to this, or some other Christian Prince at those times in India, which is far neerer to Persia, and from whence the Indians borrowed their Royal titles, both in those times & since, as, Garciasab Her∣to Garc. ab Hor. l.2.c 28. Linschoten l.1. c. 27. and Linschoten shewe. Idalham or Adelham, the Title of the King of Goa is the seate of the Portugall Viceroy. Goa, and the countries about, commonly called Idalcan, is not a proper name, but a Title of ho∣nour, (signifying (as Adonizeack Iosh. 10.1.  ord) or King of Iustice: Nisamaluco, the speare of the Kingdome; and such like: Ismael the Sophi (which name also is by some in∣terpreted Elect, because they pretended to be or doe so, and others, the reprobate follo∣wers of a reprobate Religion) added the Title of Xa or Sha, to such as embraced his new sect, as Nisomoxa, &c. If the borrowing of names from the Persian language (so gene∣rall in those parts) bee still obserued: no maruell if some Christian King in those times might Stile himselfe Prestegian, or Apostolicall, (which others not vnderstanding called Priest Iohn, or Prete Iannt) as beeing compassed with so many Saracens the enemies of the Apostles, besides Heretikes, and Heathens. At Mosul is yet a Patriarch, who in Paulus M. Paul.l.1.c.6. time was of farre greater iurisdiction, and as an Easterne Pope ordained Archbishops and Bishops, through all the parts of India, besides Cairo, and Baldach: and therefore no maruell if in India there were some Great Carishan Prince, able to make head a∣gainst the Tartars in those times: For euen in Cranganor G. Bot Ben. part 3.l.2. are yet supposed to bee 70000. Christians: besides a great number in Negapatan, and in Matipur: and very many in Angamale, and 15000. on the North of Cochin, where the Archbishop that dependeth on the Patriatch of Babylon, or Mosul, resideth: All which haue no com∣munion with the Greek, Roman, or Ethiopian Churches. And for the Ethiopian names or crosses, either their Marchants when their state was great, or slaues, which taken from them are euen in these times sold deerest of any other, and mount to great preserments of warre, vnder these Lords, might leaue such impressions: or, some other, which as they professed One Christ, so might haue some words and ceremonies common with the Ethiopian: although I must needs acknowledge, that many of those crosses haue not crossed my way, nor any other Ethiopian foote-prints. Pardon me gentle Reader, if I seeme tedious in this dispute, seeing it is necessary both for the vnderstanding of the extent of the power and Religion of this Precious or Priest Iohn: and Scaliger hauing ascribed such large bounds to his Empire, I could not but exa∣mine the same, otherwise professing my selfe (sinon magts amtca veritas) euen willing, if I must needs erre, to erre with him, who hath in many tongues, and Artes, shewed him∣selfe perhaps the worthiest Generall, and generallest Worthy, against Errour that euer we haue had, the Alpha of learned men in our Age, as our learned D. Morton a∣gainst Brerely. Morton testifieth of him, and a great light of learning, acknowledged by Royall Iunius & Scal.duo magna literarum lumi∣na.Rex lacobus in Declarat. contra Vorst. testimonie. His autho∣ritie I would not seeme to contemne, and therefore haue entred this long search: con∣tented, if any like better to follow the opinion of Sealiger in this, as I haue done in ma∣ny things else, that he take his choise.

Dau∣cali and Dobas, are neere the Red Sea, inhabited with Mores. Many of these Countries are diuersly placed by diuers: through ignorance of the exact situations: which Aluarez F. Aluares. in his so many yeares trauell in those parts might well haue acquainted vs with, if he had first acquainted himselfe with rules of Art, to haue obserued by instruments the true fire and distances.
Let vs now come vnto the Court of their Emperour, which was alway mouing, Aluaes spea∣keth a, it was in his time: it is now other∣wise as you shall after reade. and yet the greatest towne that his whole Empire containeth. For there are few which haue in them one thousand and six hundred Families, whereas this moueable Citie hath fiue thousand, or six thousand tents, and Mules for cariages about fifty thousand. In his march from one place to another, if they passe by a Church, he and all his compa∣ny alight, and walke on foote, till they be past. There is also carried before him a con∣secrated stone or Altar, vpon the shoulders of certaine Priests appointed to that office. They call him Acegue, which signifieth Emperour, and Negus, that is, King. By commandement of the Queene Maqueda, which visited Salomon, women Strabo l.18. tels of circum∣cised women in these parts.

As for the rites of their Christianitie, it belongeth not to this place to expresse. Their circum∣cision Zabo saith, is not obserued, as if it made them more worthy then other Christi∣ans, for they thinke to be saue onely by faith. They vse this and distinctions of meates, and Mosaicall rites, yet so as hee that eateth. should not despise him that eatest not, and not condemning others that refuse them: but yet thinking that neither Christ, nor the Apostles, nor the Primitiue Church had disannulled them, interpreting also the Scriptures to their purpose. Of their agreeing with other Churches in the most points of substance, the Authour of the Catholike Traditions. Catholike Traditions hath written: and when I make a Christian Visitation of these parts, it shall be further discouered. The succession is not tied to the eldest, but to him F.Luys saith he is elected, as elsewhere is shewed. whom the Father appointeth. For Dauid which sent this Ambassage to Portugall, was the third sonne in order, and for modestie in refusing to sit in his Fathers Throne, which in the same triall his o∣ther Brethren had accepted, was preferred to that which hee had refused: the other reiected for their forward acceptation. The King offered L ad Eman. the King of Portugall an hundred thousand drammes of Gold, and as many Souldiours towards the subduing of the Mores, besides other things meete for the warre. It seemes the difference of the Aethiopian, and Popish Superstition was the cheese hinderance in this businesse: neither partie beeing able (if willing) to reconcile their long-receiued differences from each other, and the truth. Eugenius the Pope, and the Aegyptian King, then named The seeds of Iacob, Litrae ad Papam. had written to each other: and Aluarez yeelded Obedienza del Prete launi &c. apud Ramusium. obedience to the Pope, in the name of the Prete, at Bologna, in the presence of Pope Clement the seuenth, and Charles the fist. But all this sorted to none effect. For Pope Paul the fourth sent an Embassage to Claudius, then the Abassine Emperour, employing in the same thirteene Iesuites, one of which was made Patriarch, and two Bishops, in their hopefull Aethiopian Hierarchie. Ignatius, the founder of the Iestes, wrote a long Letter also, which Maffaeus P. Muff.istor.Indie.l.16. hath inserted at large. Thus in the yeare 1555. Iohn the third, King of Portugall, vndertooke the charges to con∣uey them thither: and sent Eman. Acosta in Communario reum in oriente gestarum. Consaluus Roterigius, to prepare them way by a for∣mer Embassage to Claudius, whose eares hee found fast closed to such motions. Wherevpon, the New Patriarch stayed at Goa, and one of the Bishops vvith a Priest or two went thither, where when they came, they found Claudius slaine, and his brother Ouiedo R. of Hierapolis. Adamas, a cruell man, and an Apostata sometimes from his saith, in the Throne. He cast the new Bishop into bands, and drew him into the warres with him, where the Emperour was discomfited, and hee taken and strip∣ped of all, and at last miserably died, and with him the hope of Roman Abassia. Sabellieus Sabel. Aen. 10.l.8. saith hee had conference with some Aethiopians, which said that their Lord ruled ouer threescore and two Kings. They called him Gyam, which signi∣fieth mighty. They wondred why the Italians called him a Priest, seeing he neuer receiued Orders, onely hee bestowed Benefices: and is neither called Iohn or Ianes, but Gyam. Some report of him things incredible, as one Webbe Webs Trauels an Eng∣lish man in his Tales of his Trauels. He hath Golde enough shut vp in a Caue, to buy the moitie of the world, as L. L Le Roy.l.9. Regius affirmeth, and can raise an Armie of ten hundred thousand, (saith Sabellicus.) Yet the Peasants are not emploied in milita∣rie seruice: but onely the Cauas, which are men brought vp thereto. They warre
not in the Len, Alvarez cap 113. except against themselues with extremity of fasting, so weakening their bodies, that the Moores The Moores also vse to giue assaults on the Saturdayes & Sundayes, be∣cause (of a Iew∣ish superstiti∣on) then they refuse to fight. make that their harvest of Abissine captiues. Of this their fasting Aluares saith, that they beginne their Lent ten dayes before vs: and after Candlemasse, fast three dayes, in remembrance of Niniuehs repentance; many Friers in that space eating nothing: and some women refusing to suckle their children aboue once a day. Their generall fast is bread and water, for fish is not easily had, being igno∣rant to take it. Some Friers eate no bread all Lent long for deuotion; some, not in a whole yeare, or in their whole life, but feede on hearbs, without oyle or salt: that I speake not of their girdles of yron, and other their hardships, which my Penne would willingly expresse, if my Method forbade me not. This fasting (as exposing their State to hostile inuasions and insolencies) may finde place and mention heere. Their Friers and Priests in Lent eate but once in two daies, and that in the night. Queene Lit. Helen. ad & in. Reg. Por∣tug. Helena, that sent her Ambassadour to King Emanuel, was reported to eate but three times a weeke, on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. On Sundayes they fast not. In Tigray and Tigremahon they fast neither Saturday nor Sunday: and they marry (because they haue two moneths priuiledge from fasting) on Thursday before our Shrouetide. They that are rich, may there marry three wiues, and the Iustice forbids them not; only Alvarez. they are excommunicated from entring the Church. In the kingdome of Angole, yron, and salt is currant money. The Moores of Dobas haue a law, prohibiting marriage to any, that hath not first slaine twelue Christians. The diuorces Alvar.c.2. and marrying the wiues of their brethren deceased, is heere in vse much like as with the Iewes. In Bernagasso, Alvarez and his company, in their trauel, were incountred with ma∣ny great Apes as bigge as Weathers, their fore-parts hairie like Lions, which went not lesse then two or three hundred in a company: they would climbe any rockes: they digged the earth, that it seemed as it had beene tilled. In the Countrey of the Giannamori, Ca.50. as they trauelled, they crossed a certaine brook or riuer, that came downe from the mountaines, and finding a pleasant place, shaded with the Sallowes, there they reposed themselues at noone: the water of the brooke was not sufficient to driue a Mill. And whiles the company stood, some on one side the brooke, some on the other, they heard a thunder, which seemed a farre off, but saw no likelihood of raine or winde; when the thunder was done, they put their stuffe in or∣der to be gone, and had taken vp the Tent, in which they dined, when one of the com∣pany going by the brooke about his busines, sodainely cried out, Looke to your selues: whereupon turning about, they saw the water come downe a speares deapth with gret fury, which carried away part of their stuffe: and had they not (by good hap) taken vp their tent, they together with it had bin carried away with the streame. Many of them were forced to clime vp the Sallowes. Such was the noise of the water, and the ratling of the stones, which came tumbling downe the mountaines together, that the earth trem∣bled, and the Skie seemed to threaten a downe fall. Sodainely it came, and sodainely it passed. For the same day they passed ouer, and sawe very many and great stones ioy∣ned to those which they had seene there before. In the kingdome of Goyame, C.135.see.c.12 Some draw Nilus from certain moun∣taines, which are named Mountaines of the Moone: but it comes first from the lake Zembre, or Zaire: and passeth by this where it is en∣creased. the riuer Nilus springeth, it is there called Gion, and comes from two lakes, which for their greatnesse may seeme to be Seas, in which (report goeth) that Mermaides, Tritons, or Men-fishes are seene, and some haue told me (saith Alvarez) that they haue seene it. Peter Covilian a Portugall, which had li∣ued a great part of his life in those parts, tolde me, that hee had beene in that kingdome by order from Queene Helena, to build there an Altar in a Church built by her, where she was buried. Beyond that kingdome, I was told, there were Iewes. The houses of the Ethiopians C.159. are round, all of earth, flatte roofed, couered with thatch, compassed with yards. They sleepe vpon oxe-hides. They haue neither Tables nor Table-clothes, but haue their meate serued in on plaine woodden platters. Some eate flesh raw; others broyle it. Artillery they had not vntill they bought some of the Turkes. Writing is little (and scarce a little) vsed amongst them: the Officers dispatch matters of Iustice by Messengers, and word of mouth. There is no wine made of the
grape (but by stealth) except in the Pretes and Abuna is their Patt-arch. Abunas: others vse wine made of Rai∣sins, steeped tenne dayes in water, and sirained, which is cordiall and strong. They haue plenty and want of mettalles; Golde, Siluer, &c. the soile yieldeth, but they haue not Art to take it. They haue no coine of golde or siluer; salt is the most currant money. Sugar canes they haue, but want skill to vse them. The mountaines and woods are full of basil and other odoriserous plants. They haue store of bees and honey: but their Hiues are placed in Chambers, where making a little hole in the wall the bees goe in and out. There are some places very cold. The Commons are miserably oppres∣sed by their superiours. No man may kill an Oxe though it be his owne, without li∣cence from the Gouernours: there were no Shambles but at the Court. The common people seldome speake truth, no not vpon an oath, except they are compelled to sweare by the head of the king; they exceedingly seare excommunication. Their oathes are in this fort: The party to be deposed goeth with two Priests, carrying with them fire and and incense to the Church-doore, whereon hee layeth his hand. Then the Priest ad∣iures him, saying; If thou shalt sweare falsly, as the Lion deuoureth the beasts of the forrest, so let the Deuill deuoure thy soule: and as corne is growned vnder the mil-stone, so let him grinde thy bones: and as the fire burneth vp the wood, so letthy sou'e burne in hell: (the partie answereth to euery to these clauses, Amen.) But if thou speake truth, let thy life be prolonged with honour, and thy soule enter into Paradise with the Bles∣sed, Amen. Then doth hee giue his testimonie. They haue Bookes written in Parch∣ment. Some F. Inys histor. Et.l br. 1.c.28. Brieie des rip∣tion of the whole world. affirme that the Princes of Egypt haue time out of minde payed to Prester Iohn a great tribute, (continued by the Turkes, which Luys saith is three hundred thou∣sand Zequis, euery Zequibeing sixeteene ryalls, and with vs eight pence) for that by him the furious spirit of Nilus is stoked and cooled, being detained in the way by many sluces, for that purpose made. The great Turke denying this, Alfons. Albu∣querque deui¦sed to diuert Nilus into the red Sea. the Abissine caused those dammes to be broken, and by drowning Egypt in vncouth manner, forced that great Monarch to composition. Alvarez denies both the mountaines of Luna, and the mel∣ting of snow, which is supposed the cause of this riuers hastinesse; and ascribeth the o∣uerflowing or Nilus to the extreame raines in Ethiopia, whose Fountaines diuers Por∣tugalles haue seene (he saith) in Goyame. The Turke notwithstanding hath (by war∣ring vpon him) erected a new B-glerbeg-ship in his Dominions. Alvarez liued there six yeeres, and was once within thirtie miles of Nilus, but in all his trauells neuer sawe that riuer. So little accesse haue the Ethiopians (barred out by vnpassable passages) v∣sually to the same. Andrea Andrea Cor∣sali liter. at R. Corsali rporteth that the Prete Dauid, was of Oliue colour, but shewed his face but once in the yeere, hauing at other times his face couered for greater stare, and therefore also spake to none, but by an interpreter. The Inhabitants are branded with fire, which they vse, not for Baptisme, but in obseruation of a Custome of Salomon, who so marked his slaues, as they affirme. Frier Luys giueth a more probable reason thereof, saying that when the world groned vnder Arrianisme: the Abisse Emperor caused his subiects to brand themselues with a three-fold marke or stampe in the fore∣head, to testisie their faith of and in the Trinitie: which now since their commerce with the Roman Christians is in mannet wholly left, except in the ruder and more vnciuill parts of Barnagasso, the borders of the Empire. The same Author Luys de Vr∣st de la Ethiopia libr. 1. pag 247. & d. saith, that in Ae∣thiopia are Elephants, the Rhinoceros, and (besides other beasts) the Vnicorne in the Kingdome of Goyame, and in the hilles of the Moone, but seldome seene, onely the horne is found, which hee casteth in maner as the Harr. There are also (he saith) birds of Paradise: and such store and varietie of flowers ail the yeare long, that their Eu∣nuches are alwaie decked with them. There is one Flower not anywhere else knowne, called Ghoyahula, much resembling a Mary-gold, but exceeding faire in varietie and excellencie of colours, fragrant smell, abundance of leaues in the Flower, and with a more rare qualitie; beginning to open at noone, and so by little and little opening more and more tiil midnight, alway the sent encreasing with the opening: after mid∣night it shuts by little and little, till noone: denying by the same degrees her pleasing
offices to both senses, of sent, and sight. He mentioneth Pag 344. In their language alico∣meinus. also a bird, called the Rhi∣nocerot of the aire, much bigger then an Eagle, and hauing a bowe-fashioned bill or beake foure foot long, and a horne betweene the eies, with a blacke line alongst it. It is a cruell sowle, and attends on battells and campes. The Portugalls had sight of one at the red Sea, when Solyman the Eunuch had his nauy in the red Sea. The horne is of the same propertie with that of the Vnicorne and Rhinoceros. There are fishes also called Rhinocerotes of the Sea; many of which are payd the Prete for tribute. CHAP. V. Of the Hill Amara: and the rarities therein. THe hill Amara hath already beene often mentioned, and nothing indeed in all Ethiopia more deserueth mention, whether wee respect the natu∣rall site, or the employment thereof. Somewhat is written thereof by Geographers, and Historians, especially by Alvarez, F. Alvarez  Cap.58.ad 62. whome wee haue chiefly followed in the former relations of this Countrey, as an ∣witnesse of the most things reported; but neither they, nor he haue a∣ny thing but by relation, sauing that hee passed two dayes iourney along by the said hill, and that also had almost cost him his life. But Iohn de Baltasar liued in the same a long time, and therein serued Alexander which was afterwards Emperour, and was often by commaundement of the same man, when he was Emperor, sent thither: out of his relations, Frier Luys de Vr∣reta de la histo∣ria de la Ethio∣pia lib. mim. c. 8. & deiucept. Luys saith, he hath borrowed that which here were offer you. And here we offer you no small fauour, to conduct you into, and about this place, where none may come but an Ethiopian, and that by expresse licence, vnder paine of leauing his hands, feet, and eies behind, in price for his curiositie; and not much lesse is the dan∣ger of such as offer to escape from thence; Alvares himselfe being an eie-witnes of some such cruell executions insticted for that offence. This hil is situate as the nauil of that E∣thiopian body, and centre of their Empire, vnder the Equinoctiall line, where the sunne may take his best view thereof, as not encountring in all his long iourney with the like Theatre; wherein the Graces and Muses are Actors (no place more graced with Na∣tures store, or furnished with such a store-house of books) the Sunne himselfe so in loue with the sight, that the first and last thing he vieweth in all those parts, is this hill, and where Antiquitie consecrated vnto him a stately Temple: the Gods (if ye beleeue Ho∣mer, Hom. ll. that they feasted in Ethiopia) could not there, nor in the world find a fitter place for entertainement, all of them contributing their best store (if I may so speake) to the banquet, Bacchus, Iuno, Venus, Pomona Ceres, and the rest, with store of fruits, whole∣some aire, pleasant aspect and prospect; secured by Mars, left any sinister accident should interrupt their delights, if his garrisons of souldiers were needefull, where Na∣ture had so strongly fortified before; onely Neptune with his ruder Sea-Deities, and Pluto with his blacke-Guard of barking Cerberus, and the rest of that dreadfull traine (whose vnwelcome presence would trouble all that are present) are al, saue Charon, who attends on euery feast, yea hath now ferried away those supposed Deities with himselfe, perpetually exiled from this place. Once, Heauen and Earth, Nature and Industry haue all beene corriualls to it, all presenting their best presents, to make it of this so louely presence, some taking this for the place of our Fore-fathers Paradise. And yet, though thus admired of others, as a Paradise, it is made a prison to some, on whom Nature had bestowed the greatest freedome, if their freedome had not bin eclipsed Iam nacet esse Deum. Ou. with greatnes, and (though goodly starres, yet by the Sunnes brightnes, are forced to hide their light, when grosse and earthly bodies are seene) their noblenesse making them prisoners, that one Sun onely may shine in that Ethiopian throne. It is situate in a great Plaine, largely extending it selfe euery way, without other bill in the same for the space of 30, leagues, the forme thereof round and circular, the height such, that it is a dayes worke to ascend from the soot to the top; round about, the rocke is cut so smooth, and euen, without any
vnequall swellings, that it seemeth to him that stands beneath, like a high wall, whereon the heauen is as it were propped: & at the top it is ouer-hanged with rocks, jutting forth of the sides the space of a mile, bearing out like mushromes, so that it is impossible to as∣cend it, or by ramming with earth, battering with canon, scaling, or otherwise to winne it. It is aboue twenty leagues in circuit, compassed with a wall on the top, wel wrought, that neither man not beast in chase may fall downe. The top is a plaine field, only toward the South is a rising hill, beautifying this plaine, as it were with a watch-tower, not ser∣uing alone to the eie, but yeelding also a pleasant spring, which passeth through all that Plaine, paying his tributes to euery garden that will exact it, and making a lake, whence issueth a riuer, which hauing from these tops espied Nilus, neuer leaues seeking to find him, whom he cannot leaue both to seek and find, that by his direction & conueiance he may, together with him, present himselfe before the Father and great King of Waters, the Sea. The way vp to it is cut out within the rocke, not with staires, but ascending by little and little, that one may ride vp with ease; it hath also holes cut to let in light, and at the foot of this ascending place, a faire gate, with a Corps du Guarde. Halfe way vp is a faire and spacious Hall cut out of the same rocke, with three windowes verie large vp∣wards: the ascent is about the length of a launce and a halfe: and at the toppe is a Gate with another guard. The aire aboue is wholesome and delectable; and they liue there very long, and without sickenesse. There are no Cities on the top, but palaces, standing by themselues, in number foure and thirtie, spacious, sumptuous, and beautifull, where the Princes of the royall bloud haue their abode with their families. The souldiers that guard the place dwell in tents. There are two Temples, built before the reigne of the Queene of Saba, one in honour of the Sunne, the other of the Moone, the most mag∣nificent in all Ethiopia, which by Candace, when shee was conuerted to the Christan Faith, were consecrated in the name of the Holy Ghost, and of the Crosse. At that time, (they tell) Candace ascending with the Eunuch (whose proper name was Indica) to baptise all of the roiall bloud, which were there kept, Zachary the eldest of them, was in his baptisme named Philip, in remembrance of Philips conuerting the Eunuch, which caused all the Emperors to be called by that name, til Iohn the Saint, who would be cal∣led Iohn, because he was crowned on S. Iohns day: & while they were busie in that holy worke of baptising the Princes, a Doue in fiery forme came fleeing with beams of light, & lighted on the highest Temple dedicated to the Sunne, whereupon it was afterwards consecrated to the Holy Ghost by Saint Mathew the Apostle, when hee preached in Ethiopia. Those two Temples were after that giuen to the Monasticall Knights of the Militarie Order of Saint Anthonie, by Philip the seuenth, with two great and spacious Couents built for them. I should loose both you and my selfe, if I should leade you in∣to their sweet, flourishing and fruitfull gardens, whereof there are store in this Plaine, curiously made, and plentifully furnished with fruits both of Europe plants there, as peares, pippins, and such like; and of their owne, as oranges, citrous, limons, and the rest; with cedars, palme trees, with other trees, and variety of hearbs, and floures, to satisfie the sight, taste and sent. But I would intertaine you, only with rarities, no where else to be found; and such is the Cubayo tree, pleasant, beyond all comparison, in taste, and whereunto for the vertue is imputed the health and long life of the Inhabitants; and the balme tree, whereof there is great store here: and hence it is thought Ioseph. Ant. libr. 8.ca.2. the Queene of Saba carried and gaue to Salomon, who planted them in Iudaea, from whence they were transplanted at Cayro long after. The plenty of graines and corne there growing. the charmes of birds, alluring the eares with their warbling Notes, and fixing their eies on their colours, ioyntly agreeing in beauty, by their disagreeing varietie, and other creatures that adorne this Paradise, might make me glut you (as sweet meates vsually doe) with too much store. Let vs therefore take view of some other things worthy our admiration in this admired hill. The stately building of the two Churches aforesaid, with their Monasteries, with the pillars and roofes of stone, richly and cunningly wrought, the matter and the workman∣ship conspiring magnificence; that of Iaspar, Alabaster, Marble, Prophyry; this with painting, gilding, and much curiostitie, with the two Monasteries, containing each of
them 1500, religious Knights and Monkes: each monasterie hath two Abbats; one of the militarie Knights, the other spirituall, of the monkes, inferior to the former. In the monastery of the Holy Crosse are two rare peeces, whereon Wonder may iustly fasten both her eies: the Treasury and Library The Library of the Pte. of the Emperour, neither of which is thought to be matchable in the world. That Librarie of Constantinople Zuta. An. to 3 wherein were 120000 bookes nor the Alexandrian Library, wherein Gellius Gill h.6.c.17 numbreth 700000, had the fire not bin admitted (too hastie a Student) to consume them, yet had they come short, if re∣port ouer-reach not, this whereof we speake; their number is in a maner innumerable, their price inestimable. The Queene of Saba (they say) procured Bookes hither from all parts, besides many which Salomon gaue her, and from that time to this, their Emperors haue succeeded in like care and diligence. There are three great Halls, each aboue two hundred paces large, with Bookes of all Sciences, written in fine parchment, with much curiositie of golden letters, and other workes, and cost in the writing, binding, and co∣uers: some on the floore, some on shelues about the sides: there are few of paper: which is but a new thing in Ethiopia. There are the writings of Enoch copied out of the stones wherein they were engrauen, which intreate of Philosophie, of the Heauens and Ele∣ments Others goe vnder the name of Noe, the subiect whereof is Cosmographie, Ma∣thematikes ceremonies and prayers: some of Abraham, which he composed when he dwelt the valley of Mamre, and there read publikely Philosophie and the Mathema∣tikes There is very much of Salomon, a great number passing vnder his name: many a∣scribed to Iob, which he writ after the recouery of his prosperity: many of Esdras, the Prophets, and high Priests. And besides the foure canonicall Gospels, many others ascribed to Bartholomew, Thomas, Andrew, and many others: much of the Sibylles, in verse and prose: the workes of the Queene of Saba: the Greeke Fathers, all that haue written, of which, many are not extant which vs: the Writers Fr-Lays hath a very large catalogue of them l.1.c.9 taken out (as he saith) of an Index, which Anthary Gricus and L Cremo∣nes made of them, being sent thither by the Pope Gre∣gorie 13. at the instance of Cardinall ar∣l, which sawe and admired the varietie of them, as did many others then in their company. of Syria, Egypt, Africa, and the Latine Fathers translated, with others innumerable in the Greeke, Hebrew, A∣rabike, Abissine, Egyptian, Syrian, Chaldee, far more Authors, and more of them then we haue; few in Latin; yet T. Liuis is there whole, which with vs is imperfect; and some of the workes of Thomas Aquinas: Saint Augustines workes are in Arabike: Poets, Phi∣losophers, Physicians, Rabbines, Talmudists, Cabalists, Hierogliphikes, and others would be too tedious to relate. When Ierusalem was destroyed by Titus; when the Saracens ouer-ranne the Christian world; many Bookes were conueyed out of the Easterne parts into Ethiopia; when Ferdinand and Isabella expelled the Iewes out of Spaine, many of them entred into Ethiopia, and for doing this without licence, enriched the Pretes Li∣brary with their bookes: when Charles 5. restored Muleasses to his kingdome, the Prete hearing that there was at Tunis a great Library, sent & bought more then 3000 books of diuers Arts. There are aboue 200 Monkes, whose office is to looke to the Librarie, to keepe them cleane and sound; each appointed to the Books of that language which hee vnderstandeth: the Abbot hath streight charge from the Emperor, to haue care thereof; he esteeming this Library more then his treasure. And yet his treasure is such, The Treasu∣ry of the Prete. as leauestall others of all Princes in the world behind, quite out of sight: It is a Sea, that euery yeare receiueth new riuers, neuer running out: the Emperours, euen from the time of the Queene of Saba, laying vp part of their reuenue here. And therefore Literae Dauid. Dauid the Prete, in Letters to King Iohn the second of Portugall, said, that hee had golde as the sands of the Sea, and the Starres in the Skie. The first that coyned money, was Alexander the third, which died in the yeare of our Lord 1603, stamping in the one side, the figure of Saint Mathew the Ethiopian Patron, and on the other, the Lion and Crosse, which is the Armes of Ethiopia. His Iewels, here kept, are incomparable; Topazes, Amethists, Saphires, Diamonds, and others. He hath one Iewell which was found in the riuer Ni∣ger, (that brings forth more gemmes then any riuer in the world) which is one peece of stone or rocke diuersifed with a thousand varieties of stones: it is square, about two palmes and a halfe, and thicke withall: there are in it a hundred and sixty Diamonds, one as large as the palme of ones hand, others of one, two or three fingers, and some lesse: it hath aboue 300 Emeraldes, Rubies the greatest in the world; aboue fifty Saphires, Tur∣queses, Balazes, Amethists, Ipinels, Topazes, Iacinths, Crysolites, and all other kinds. Na∣ture
heere playing the leweller, and representing a Map of the worlds gemmes in one Iewell, without and infinitly beyond all Art of man. Being set in the Sun, it seems a com∣bined marriage of heauenly & earthly Excellence, that no mortall eie hath seeue the like, not is able to endure the sight of this. When Bernardo Vecheti a Ieweller was sent thi∣ther by Francis de Medices Duke of Florence, he accounted it beyond all estimation or valew. The Emperour keepes it in a box of gold. By the perswasion of that Bernardo he hath made him tables set with thousands of stones in them. Corrall is more esteemed in Ethiopia then gold, and therefore frier Luys denies that coralls in the bottome of the red sea, make it red, as some affirme: and that which Barros Barros dec. 2 lib. 8.ca.1. saith hath beene found there, is vnperfect. But greater Iewels then those are kept in Amara, the princes of the bloud roial, which are sent to this hill at eight yeres old, and neuer returne thence, except they bee chosen Emperours. The first Author of this custome was Iosue the nephew of Salomon, and son of Meilet or Melilec, to remoue all occasions of ciuill wars about succession. And their continued succession in one line, without alienation, is imputed to this. Some Empe∣rours for a time had left it, til Abraham being Emperour had, or pretended to haue a re∣uelation, to renue that custome, if he would continue the Scepter in the linage of Dauid. The Princes which liue there, are six, eight, twelve, & sometimes more: Anno 1608 they were six; euery of which liues by himselfe, and that in great estate and maiesty in royall palaces with spacious halls richly hanged, remouing to another palace at pleasure: they meet all together when they will play, hunt, walke, and on holidayes to diuine Seruice: they take place according to their age; ech hath his ten seruants for ordinary attendance, which are the sons, or descended of the tributary kings: for baser Offices, the great Mr or military Abbot employeth the soldiers that guard at the foot of the hill, which with∣out licence may not ascend. They haue other graue persons to instruct them in virtue & learning. Euery city, that is, euery habitation of a thousand houses, is at their own charge to send thither three men, a gentleman, a citizen, and a plebeian, for the guard of the hill, which make vp the number of 7500, there being 2500 cities in the Empire. The milita∣ry Abbats order them in their seueral wards, the baser at the foot of the hill, the citizens at the middle, and the gentlemen at the top; their capitains changed at euery two months end. Besides the souldiers tents, are many other of Merchants and Officers. No woman may ascend, nor hath done since Queene Candace was here baptized by her Eunuch: the the Princes liue single, and marry nor, as Aluares hath vntruely affirmed of them. CHAP. VI. Of the Election of the Emperors: of their Scholes, Vniuersities, and royall Cities. WHen the Emperor is dead, many solemne ceremonies are obserued, both religious and ciuill about the election of another, which is in the autho∣rity of the 2 military Abbots of S. Anthonies order in the mount. Oaths are taken both of the Electors and Elected, the first, to vse sincerity, the other to reigne iustly, obseruing, and causing in his Empire to be obser∣ued, the laws of God, Christian religion, the soure first Councels, of Nice, Ephesus, Chal∣cedon, & Constautinople: and (if the F. Luys de vr∣ret.hist.Ethiop. Frier reach not, for in their holy Fathers case Ire∣lie not much on their holines) to acknowledge the Florentine Counsell, and the Popes Supremacie, and lastly, the Constitutions of Iohn the Saint, and Philip the seuenth, an∣ciēt Emperors: which done, in solemne Procession of all estates they goe to the Church, and hauing set the Emperour in his throne, the Princes of the bloud are brought out of the Pallace, where in the time of the election they had beene enclosed, to kisse his hand, and sweare sidelity, clothed in the habite of the Knights of Saint Anthony: the same oath is giuen also by the Kings, his vassalls (foure of which are present at the electi∣on) the Counsellers, Prelates, and others, according to their place. After this, fires are made on the towers of the Mount, to giue notice of this election, which being seene by
the neerer Cities, they also by the like fires (as it were) proclaime the same in a mo∣ment through all the Empire: which is confirmed by Posts sent thence on Dromeda∣ries, by the Abbat of the Abbey of the Holy-Ghost, one of the Electors, and the Coun∣cell, vnto the Citie of Saba, and the mother of the New-Elect, if she be liuing, and to his neere kindred, to come and reioyce with him. The next day the Emperour goeth in blacke habite to the Palace where the Princes are, and saluteth them with kinde embracements, one by one, with his bonnet in his hand: which is done in the next place by the Prelats, whome in honour of their Ecclesiasticall dignities the Princes re∣salute standing, with their heads vncouered. The tributarie Kings follow, not with embracements, but kissing their hands, rendering their salutations, and after them the Embassadors. The Emperour, hauing remained some time in priuat talke with them, goeth to the Abbey of the Holy-Ghost, and putting off his blacke habite, is clothed in Scarlet; and being on horsebacke, attended with his Familie, the Abbats, and Coun∣cellors, passeth to the Abbey of the Holy Crosse, where the two Abbats of that Abbey meet him; and after oath giuen to preserue the auncient Customes, present him with the Keyes of the Treasurie and Librarie: the Emperour bestowing as much of the said Treasure as he pleaseth. After all other ceremonies, the Councellors of the Court come to the Hill with twelue thousand Knights of S. Antonies Order (which are the Empe∣rours guard) and the eldest sonnes of the King, to conuey him solemnly to Zambra the Citie, where the Court and Councell reside, where with all solemnitie & magnificence he is likewise receiued, and conducted into the Palace, and placed on his Throne of twelue steppes, with acclamations of long life and happinesse on all hands. Fiue daies festiuall being here passed in all publike reioicings, he goeth to Saba to take the oathes of all his subiect Kings in person (whereof onely foure had been present at the Electi∣on) and one holding the Crowne, another the Scutchion of the Armes of that tributa∣rie King, he sweareth on the Scepter (which is a golden Crosse) true sidelitie and obe∣dience, and the Emperour puts on the Crowne againe on his head: and the said Scut∣chion, with his Armes, he giueth into his hand, & licenseth him to depart to his Pauilli∣on without the Citie. These Kings are truely Kings, & succeed in the inheritāce of their fathers, receiuing tribute of the subiects of their seuerall Kingdomes, and are not De∣puties, or Vice-royes, at the meere pleasure of the Emperour: but if one be vpon iust cause displaced, his sonne succeedeth: and therefore the Prete is called King of Kings. The eldest sonne of euery of these Kings attend alwayes on the Emperour, and haue attending on them ten seruants of the sonnes of the Nobles of their Kingdomes. The Emperour is bound by auncient custome to take a wife of the posteritie of those three Magi which adored CHRIST in his infancie, whome the Aethiopian and Romane Traditions calleth Kings, by the names of Gaspar, Melchior, Balthasar; of which, the Aethiopians say, that Melchior was of Arabia, and Balthasar of Persia, which being forced by persecution of Arians When were the Arians of such power in Arabia, but especially in Persia? , came into Aethiopia, in the time of Iohn the Saint, which reigned after Philip the seuenth, and receiued of his hands the Kingdomes of Fatigar and Soa, the former giuen to the posteritie of Balthasar, the other to the linage of Melchior. The Fer addeth, That all the legitimate descendents of these three Fami∣lies are borne with a starre on one of their sides; and that at the Iubilee, in the time of Gregorie the thirteenth, 1575, there were three of those three Families at Rome, with that naturall ensigne of the supernaturall and miraculous starre. Yea, the legitimate Mahumetanes in Arabia and Persia, remaining of those kindreds, haue the same signe, as Don Iohn sware to him, that he had seene. The Councell gouerneth according to the 127 Statutes made by the first Philips, and Iohn the Saint. Nothing is punished with death but Treason, vnder which name they also comprehend Murther and Adulterie: of this mortall sentence the Lions are the executioners, which in euery Citie are kept for that purpose. Some Italians had beene found guiltie of the sinne against Nature, a thing for which the Aethiopians (as some of the Ancients Ci for Parricide) had no law, as not thinking any would so farre degenerate; and therefore knew not how to punish them: but it was comitted to the Latin Councell, which adiudged them to be burned; a punishment not known before in those parts, yet fitting to those vnnaturall burning
The fault and the punishment being of equall strangenesse, the Emperour would not haue it executed there, but sent them to Goa to the Portugall Viceroy for that purpose. Heresie and Apostasie are likewise punished with death. That Latine Councell was instituted by Alexander the third, for Causes and Persons of Europe to be tryed and iudged by Iudges of their owne, resident at the Court (as the Grand Councell is) and chosen of each Nation two, of the Venetians, Florentines, and Portugalls: the two former come thither by the way of Cayro. Andrew Oniedo a Iesuite, sent thither by the Pope with the title of Bishop of Hierapolis, was Author and Councellour to the Emperour of this Institution, and by him made President of the same. This man ( G. Bot. part. 3. l.2. Mess.Hist.Ind.l.16. ma.A.osta. Bo∣tero, Maffaus, and others say) had miserable entertainment, with the residue of his Societie: but Frier Luys (from the relation of Don Iohn) tells, That he had liued and died in great honour amongst them, as he doth elsewhere magnifie exceedingly their respect to the Romane Papacie and Religion. Credat Iudaus Apella. Cui bono Cic. pro Mi∣lone. is the rule of my Faith to Friers and Iesuites in their Relations: in Naturall and Morall Hi∣stories, which serue not to the building of Babylons Tower, I receiue them with at∣tention, with thankes, and if need be, with admiration in some things: but when they come with Slime instead of Mortar, and would get Rome a name, I remember their Vowes & Profession, and yeeld no further attendance. That Claudius which was then Emperor, and his successor Adamas, were of schismaticall and tyrannicall qualities, as other Historians affirme, Frier Luys not only denies, but extolleth their good parts. He which now is Emperor, was elected An. 1606, and called himselfe Zaraschau∣reat, asprout or budde of the linage of Dauid, assister of S. Peter and S. Paul. He is a man haughtie and valorous, and was therefore chosen, because the Turkish Empire was so full of seditions, and the Sophi had sent his Embassadour to them, to chuse a fit warri∣or, that they might with ioint forces assault the Ottoman. There are in all the Cities of Aethiopia two Schooles or Colleges for the instructi∣on of youth; one for the male sexe, the other for the female: each diuided into three parts; the first, for the Gentlemens children; the second, for Citizens; the third, for the baser vulgar, with their seuerall Instructers, and without communion, medling, or conuersing of the one with the other. The Seminarie of College of boyes is a quar∣ter of a league without the Citie, the other within. There are they taught Letters and Religion. All, euen the Kings themselues, are bound to send their children thither to be instructed: and the Priests resort theither for Confession, and ministring the Sacra∣ment to them. They may resort home at festiuall times: otherwise they are there de∣tained; the Virgins, from tenne to twentie; the other, from tenne to sixteene yeares of their age. They haue not onely this order in their well-ordered Schooles, but in their disordered misorderly Stewes, the Deuils worke-houses, and suburbes of Hell, which yet in Rome and places of that Religion are permitted and admitted the Ci∣ties, and his Holinesse selfe is not a little enriched with (that which GOD prohibi∣ted) Deut. 23.18. the price of the Dogge, and of the Whore. The Aethiopians permit not any to be strange women, but strangers of other Countries, which may not enter into their Cities: Nor may the Nobles enter into the common houses which belong to the Citizens, or these to those of the Plebeians, nor any but to those peculiarly desig∣ned their state, vnder paine of death, as Adulterers, to be cast to the Lions. These women are hyred by certaine Officers at a common price, and are not to take any thing of particular men: They goe in pale-coloured Garments, and if they distast and forsake that beastly Trade, they send them to some places subiect vnto the Portugalls, not admitting them to conuerse with their women, for feare of in∣fection. But to leaue these Beasts, the Aethiopians giue great respect to their Physicians, which are onely of their Gentrie, and that not all that will, but onely such as certaine Officers shall chuse, of euery Citie to be sent to their generall Vniuersities (of which there are seuen in Aethiopia) there to be taught Naturall Philosophie (Logick, & other Arts they know not) together with Physicke, & the Arts of the Apothecarie and Chi∣rurgian. They are there maintained at the publike charge of the Cities that send them.
When the Doctors and Instructers see them sit to be Graduates, they goe with them to the Monkes of Alleluya, and of Plurimanos, who with a Monkes Cowle, of Hood, and other Doctorall Ensignes, doe inuest and inaugurate them in that De∣gree. They are great Herbarists. They make Making of Mummie. Mummia otherwise then in other parts, where it is either made of bodies buried in the Sands, or taken out of auncient Sepulchres, where they had beene layd, being embaulmed with Spices. For they take a captiue Moore, of the best complexion, and after long dieting and medicining of him, cut off his head in his sleepe, and gashing his bodie full of wounds, put therein all the best Spices, and then wrap him vp in Hay, being before couered with a Scare∣cloth; after which, they burie him in a moist place, couering the bodie with earth. Fiue dayes being passed, they take him vp againe, and remouing the Seare-cloth and Hay, hang him vp in the Sunne, whereby the bodie resolueth and droppeth a sub∣stance like pure Baulme, which liquor is of great price. The fragrant sent is such, while it hangeth in the Sunne, that it may be smelt (he sayth) a league off. The pri∣uiledges of Physicians are, that they are freed from the common custome of giuing one in three of their sonnes for the Emperours Warres, that they may ride on Ele∣phants in the Cities, which is allowed onely to the Emperours, Prelats, and Priests, that are Virgins: They may also weare Miniuer-Hoods, and are free from Subsidies and Payments. Theologie and the Chaldee Tongue is taught onely among their Priests and Ecclesiasticall persons in their Churches and Monasteries. They read Di∣uinitie in their natiue Tongue: the Text is the foure first generall Councels: the Scrip∣ture they reade in Chaldee, which is with them as Latine with vs. They handle not questions as the Schoolemen, in Logicall Disputations and Arguings, but copiously and eloquently interprete the Scriptures. Because we haue mentioned their Cities Saba and Zambra, let vs take some briese view of them, and so leaue this Spaniard, whose Discourse hath (I hope, not without some delight and profit) thus long holden you. Besides these two Cities, none haue aboue three thousand houses in them. But these are populous and magnificent, with Towers, Temples, triumphant Arches, Obeliskes, Pyramides, and the like tokens of Industrie, Antiquitie, and Maiestie. Saba was founded by that Queene which visited Salomon, and was the mother-Citie of the Empire. It hath fiue thousand houses, great and sumptuous, the streets spacious, with Portalls, or Penthouses, that men may walke safe from the Sunnes violence. It hath foure chiefe Gates, all of Alabaster and Iasper, wrought with Antique-workes; the gate-dores of Cedar curiously carued. The waies that lead to these Gates, for the space of two leagues, are set with Palmes, Planes, O∣ranges, Cedars, Cypresses, and other Trees on both sides, for shade and fruit: the foure high streets goe through the Citie acrosse, and where they meet, is an Arch or Vault erected on high Pillars, fairely wrought and gilded, with the brazen Image of S. Ma∣thew, their supposed Patron, as bigge as a Gyant, gilded also; the worke of Architects sent by Francis, Duke of Florence. Neere to this Citie are Mines of Gold, Gardens, and other places of pleasure and profit. Zambra is greater, containing thirtie thousand houses, and innumerable concourse of people. It stands in the Kingdome of Cafates, and high that great Lake, which hereof is called Zambra: where the Emperour leauing his wonted manner of remo∣uing vp and downe in Tents, hath fixed his Court royall: and yet without the Citie are many Tents that belong to the court. Here the Prete liueth, with two and fortie sonnes of Kings, and with his Great Councell, and the Latine. Alexander the third built the Pallace here 1570, with the Duke of Florence his workmen.
CHAP. VII. Of other Countries betweene the Redde Sea and Benomotapa. AEthiopia Exterior, or Inferior, is that Southerly Tract of Africa, which to Ptolomey and the Auncients was vnknowne. It comprehendeth all that great wedge of Land (such is the forme) which beginning in the West, at the Countries aboue Zaire, stretcheth to fiue and thirtie de∣grees of Southerly latitude, and from thence, Northwards, to the en∣trance or mouth of the Arabian Gulse; all this way besieged and en∣uironed with the Ocean Bot.Ben.part.1.l.2. maginus. Pory before Leo. Maginus diuideth it into fiue parts, Aian, Zanguebar, Benomotapa, Cafraria, and Congo: but Congo is here taken in a very large sence. Aian, after the Arabians account, containeth all that Region which lyeth betweene the mouth of the Redde Sea, and Quilimanci; being, for the most part, on the Sea∣Coast inhabited by the said Arabians: but the in-land parts thereof are peopled with a blacke Heathenish Nation. It comprehendeth two Kingdomes, Adel, and Adea; the former of which extendeth from that mouth of the Sea before mentioned, to the Cape Guardafu, by Ptol.l.A.c.7. Ptolomey called Aromata. South and West it bordereth vpon the dominions of Prete Ianns, about the Kingdome of Fatigar. The chiefe Citie is Arar. Zelia also and Barbora pertaine to this Kingdome, Cities without the Strait, on the Sea, much frequented with Merchants. Zeila is situate in eleuen degrees, where Pto∣lomey placeth the Avalites. It is stored with varietie of Merchandise, and yeeldeth some representation of Antiquitie in the buildings thereof, consisting of Lime and Stone. The King is a Moore, and esteemed a Saint among the superstitious Mahu∣metans, for his continuall Warres with the Christian Abassines, whence he transpor∣teth innumerable slaues to the Arabians and Turkes, receiuing in exchange Armour and other helpes for his Warres. Anno 1541 Guad tameth the King hauing before done much harme, by the helpe of some Portugalls which Claudius the Abassine had in his warres, was slaine, and his Armie ouerthrowne: but his successour, Anno 1559, slew Claudius in battaile, and the Moore acknowledging diuine assistance in this victorie, triumphed on an Asse. Zeila was burnt and sacked by the Portugalls, Anno 1516: as Andrea Andrea Corsa∣li Corsali, who was then present in the Action, testi∣fieth. Adea is situate betweene Adel, Abassia, and the Sea. The inhabitants are Moores, descended of the Arabians, who many hundred yeares agoe, partly by their rich Traf∣fique, and especially by force of Armes, became Lords, not onely of Aan, but of all the Sea-Coast, to Cape dos corrientes, which is somewhat to the South of the Souther∣ly Tropicke. In all which space, before the Portugall Discoueries, that part of the Ci∣ties which lay open to the Sea, was open and vnfortified, but toward the Land were walled, for feare of the in-land people. Adea payeth tribute to the Abassian. In this Kingdome is Magadazzo, being it selfe a pettie Kingdome of the Moores, which are of an Oliue colour. Lud. Roma∣, l.7. Brava was a free Towne, which, with Pate and Gogia, were ta∣ken by the Portugalls, vnder Tristan de Cugna. Zanzibar, or Zanguebar, is a name by the Arabians and Persians giuen to that Tract, extending from the Riuer Qualimanci, which Ptolomey calls Raptus, to the borders of Benomotapa. Some, in a larger extent, include Benomotapa and Cafraria. Sanutus affirmeth, That it is a low, fennie, and wooddie Countrey, with many Riuers, which by extremitie of moisture cause the ayre to be intemperate. From the waste vpwards they goe naked. Herein are contained the Territories of Melinde, Mom∣baza, Quiloa, Mosambique, and others. Melinde o.di Barros, Dec.1.l.4.c.6.  faith, At Me∣linde Gnma receiued kinde entertaine∣ment, and Pi∣lots to conuey hun to India, when it was first discoue∣red by the Portugalls. is the name of a Kingdome, and of the chiefe Citie thereof: The inhabitants, especially neere to the Sea, are Moores, and build their houses after the manner of Europe. The women are white, and
the men, of colour inclining to white, notwithstanding the situation vnder the Line. They haue blacke people also, which are Heathens for the most part. Of like condi∣tion is Mombazaf Vascus Gamma 1500, subducd Mombaza, and Almeida fiue yeares after, and, after Non∣ius, Acuna. Osor. dereb. Eman. (which is said to haue some resemblance with Rhodes) but enemie to the Christians, and was ruinated by Thomas Cotigno, in the yeare 1589, for recei∣uing Alebech the Turke; as Ampazi in the same Coast, by Alfonso Mello the yeare before. Quiloa stands nine degrees to the South of the Line: the name of a Citie and Island, which is a Kingdome of the Moores, and extendeth her dominion faire in the Coastg. Ma. hist. indic. l 2. Arthus bist. ind. c.2.o. The King grew mightie by the Trade of Sofala; but it was made tributa∣rie to Portugall by Vascus Gamma, Anna 1500. In the yeare 1505 the Portugalls for deniali of that tribute, depriued Abrahem, the Arabian Ring, of his Scepter, and built a Fort there; which the Moores soone after destroyed, together with the new King, made by the Portugalls. The people are whitish, their women comely, rich in attire: their houses faire built, and richly furnished. Betweene Coava and Cuama, two Riuers which spring out of the same Lake with Nilus, are the Kingdomes of Mombara, Mozimba, Macuas, Embcoe, and against them the Promontorie Prassum. Here is Mosambique See Linschot l  c.4. Paludanus ibid. , by which name is signified a Kingdome in the Continent, and an Island also, with a safe Harbour, which with two other Islands are in the mouth of the Riuer Moghincats, in fifteene degrees South. Mosambique is inhabited by Portugalls, which haue there a strong Castle: here the Portugall shippes Winter. In this Island are Sheepe, with tayles of fiue and twentie pound weight (a Beast common in Africa:) Hennes blacke both in feathers, flesh, and bone, and sodden, looke like Inke, yet sweeter then other in taste: Porke very good, but for the decre sauce. There are some Mahumetans, as they were all, before the Portugalls arriuall there. They haue Trade in the Continent, in Sena, Ma∣curva, Sofala, Cuama, a people for the most part differing in speech and behauiour, each Village fighting with her neighbour, captiuing them: and some (as at Macurva) eat them. Their chiefest  is by Hunting, and by flesh of Elephants. In euerie Village is a new King. The Captaine of Mosambique, in his three yeares Gouern∣ment, maketh thre hundred thousand duckats gaine, especially by Gold, from Sofala. Vp further winin Land te people goe almost naked, and were so simple when first the Portugis traded  ther L Romanus, l. g. , that Ludonico Barthema, or Vertomannus, for his shirt; and anther, for a sor, and a little Bell; bought fifteene Cowes of them; and then were eadie to fall together by the eares among themselues for the Bell, who should haue it. But they could not enioy their purchase, being driuen to their heeles by three female Elephants, which hauing young ones, were very fierce, and made them leaue their Ki to saue themselues. In these Seas the Moores sayle in Vessells fow Lear, the sayles of Palme-tree leaues, calked with Gumme, gathered off  T in  Woods. S  betweene Cuama and Magnice, two Riuers. Here the Portugals haue on a little nd (whence the whole Kingdome hath this name) a Fort and Factorie of rich Trade, the people bringing great quantitie of Gold (whereof they haue plentifull Mines) for their Cloth and other commodities: it is supposed that it a∣mounteth to two millions yearely. Ortelius Ortel, Thesaur. is of opinion, That this Cephala, or Sophala, is that which in Salomons time eg 9.28. 2. chron.9.21. was called Ophor, from whence so great quantitie of Gold was brought by his Nauie. Iosephus seph. Antiq. seekes for it in India: Eu∣polemus Euseb. deprap. l.9 in the Redde Sea, imagining it to be an Island there placed. Dom, Niger Geog. Tremd & Iun. Anot. Ni∣ger Tremellus and Iunius, in Aurea Chersonesus, where Malacca standeth (al∣though wee reade not of any great quantitie of Gold found in that soyle.) Gaspar Var. d Ophyra. Gaspar Varerius is of the same minde, but reckoneth to the Chersonesus both Pegu and Sa∣motta, with all that lyeth betweene them. Vatablas Vatin i.r..9. F.Mart. de.I.l.3. with lesse reason applyeth it to Spagniola, discouered by Columbus. and by Columbus himselfe so called. Arias Ar. Mont. Mon.  verit. I ollus. Grep. Hispania. Mon∣tanus. Philip Morny. Postlls, Geropis, would by their authoritie much moue vs to thinke with them, that Ophir is Peru, if the ignorance of the Load-stone, and those
huge Seas, esteemed by Antiquitie vnnauigable, did not detaine vs from consent: And where should Peru yeeld him Ivorie, where neuer was yet seene an Elephant? Iosephus Ios. Acosta, l.I.6.14. Acosta taketh Ophir and Tharsis to signifie no certaine places, but com∣monly to be taken in a generall sence, as the word India is now with vs; a name gi∣uen to all remote Countries, East and West. Hee thinketh, that Salomons Gold, Ivorie, &c. came from the East Indies. But some reasons doe yeeld great cause of coiecture for Sofala, both because of the plentie of the commodities which Salomons seruants are said to bring with them, and because of auncient buildings of Stone-worke, which the Io.di Barros Dec.i.l.10.c.1. inhabitants call, the worke of Deuills; supposing it impossible for men (guessing of others by their owne ignorance) to haue built: Which also haue strange Letters, that the Moores (though learned) could not reade: (And why might they not be the olde Hebrew Letters, which the Phoenicians of old, and Samaritans to this day obserue, as elsewhere we haue shewed?) And further, Thomas Nauigationi di Thome Lopez ap. Ramusium. Lopez telleth, That certaine Moores related vnto them of the riches of those Mines; that Shippes from Mecca and Zidem vsed to trade there; and that yearely there were taken forth of the Mines two millions of Mitti∣galls, euery Mittigall being a Duckat of Gold, and a third part: That the Warres in those Countries at that time had ceased the Traffique: and that they had Bookes and auncient Writings, which testified, That these were the Mines whence Salomon, in his three yeares Voyages, fetched his Gold, and that the Queene of Saba was na∣turall of the parts of India. As for India, yee haue Cap. sup. euen now read, that it was a name giuen to many Nati∣ons, and among the rest, to Aethiopia. And if a man consider the small skill which that Age of the world had in marine affaires, still as much as might be holding their course within fight of Land, he can scarce thinke, that long Nauigations could then be performed. Barrius accounteth all Sofala to the Empire of Benomotapa, of which wee shall speake anone: wee haue now mentioned the same, by reason of the Isle which is subiect to the Portugalls. These, beside Gold, here haue great Trade for Ivorie, of which Barrius sayth, That in Benomotapa are yearely slaine foure or fiue thousands, and of Water-horses (whose teeth are accounted Ivorie also) all the great Riuers in Africa are full. These feede sometimes on the Medowes, where the Mari∣ners haue chased them, as Lopez Th. Lopez. reporteth: and after long chasing by Land, they haue taken the water; where, in reuenge, they haue assaulted the Mariners in their Boates, and bitten chippes of the same, being, by the thicknesse of their Hides, ar∣med against their Pikes, and haue made them afraid, that they would ouer-whelme the Boat. Within the Land, behind these parts, is the Kingdome of Monoemugi, which is rich in Gold: their vnfortunate warres with Monomotapa haue made them knowne. Nilus is their Westerne border, and Abassia on the North. They haue little redde Balls made of a kinde of Clay in Cambaya, and resembling Glasse, which they weare for ornament, and vse for money. This King warreth with the Benomota∣pa, and hath terrible souldiours, called Giacqui, or Agab, or Agg, who inha∣bite betweene the Lakes, whence Nilus and Zaire take their beginnings; which liue a wandering life, like the Nomades, in Cottages, which they make in the Fields. They are of stature tall, and of countenance terrible, making lines vpon their cheekes with certaine yron Instruments, and turning their eye-lids backward, eating their enemies. These not long since (as Od. Lopez, I.2.C.5. some say) inuaded the Kingdome of Congo, and forced the King to keepe in a small Isle, where himselfe was taken with a Drop∣sie, and his people famished, as after shall follow in due place. The Amazones of Monomotapa are euery way equall vnto them in prowesse. Little is knowne of the Religion of these Heathenish Nations, nor of other Kingdomes, where∣of we haue little but the names to relate, Goroua, Cola, Anzuga, Moneulo, Ba∣duis.
Now for those Moores which inhabited the Sea-coasts, as wee haue said, they are not all Io. di Barros, Dec.I.lib.8.c.4. Catholike Mahumetans, especially such of them as haue conuersed, and ta∣ken their habitations further within Land. And the first Moores or Arabians that came to inhabit those coasts, were banished persons, called as in the Chronicles of Quiloa is reported, Emozaidin, of Zaide, the nephew of Hocem the sonne of Hali, whose Do∣ctrine they followed in some opinions, contrary to the Alcoran, and therefore estee∣med Heretikes. Long after them came three shippes with great multitudes of Arabians, that fled from the King of Laza their enemie, vnder the conduct of seuen brethren, which built Magadazzo, and after that, Braua; which, in manner of a Common-wealth, was till the Portugals time gouerned by twelue Aldermen, or chiefe Gouernours, that descen∣ded of the seuen brethren. These Moores and the former differing from each other in their superstitions, could not agree, and therefore the Emozaidin were forced vp higher into the Countrey, and there by mariages mixed themselues with the Cafers (so the Arabians call all Heathen people) and became Mungrels in a galli-maufrey of deuotions, whom therefore the Sea-cost-Moores called by a generall name, Boter. Baduini: which in Arabia and Egypt, is the title of the people that liue in the Champaine, and Inland countries: and those that liue neere the Sea-coast are called Arabians, &c. They make no difference of meats. The Heathens in those parts are giuen to Auguries and Witcheres: & in their highest attempts and greatest resolutions, yet will leaue off, if any of these phantasies bode vn∣luckinesse. The fruits, birds, beasts, and seeds, are in manner like to the people, all wilde. The aire is vnholesome. But what vnhealthsomenesse can there bee found, where gold is found? which makes men commit themselues (no maruell what they commit with others) to the most scorching heats, to contagious aires, to tempestuous seas, and the darkest prisons of the disembowelled Earth. CHAP. VIII. Of Benomotapa, and the parts adioyning. BEnomotapa, called also Benomotaxa, and Monomotapa, is a large Em∣pire, so entituled after the name of the Prince thereof (for Benomotapa is with them a title, as Caesar or Emperour with vs) extendeth after some mens reckoning almost a thousand leagues in compasse, between the great Lake, whence Nilus springeth on the North-east, Magnice and Toroa on the South, and the Sea-coast of Sofala on the East. It is betweene the sea and the fresh waters, accounted a huge Iland. Betweene Cuama and Corrientes it is pleasant, holesome, and fruitfull: And from the Cape Corrientes to Magnice, it a∣bounds with beasts; but it is cold. Their principall Cities are Zimbas (happily the same which Ptolomey Ptol. Geogr lib.4.cap.9. calls Agisymba) and Benamataza; that one and twentie, this fifteene dayes iourney, from Sofala. Of the abundance of Elephants in Benomotapa is said before; whereof Aethiopia is euery where stored with manifold herdes: lo. di Barros, Dec.I.l.10.c.1. al∣though I dare not subscribe to their opinion, that esteeme Elephants as common there, as heere we haue Oxen. It is a creature nine cubites high (in their largest sta∣ture) and fiue cubits thicke: with long and broad eares, little eyes, short tailes, and great bellies. Of their disposition is spoken alreadie. The Mines neerest to Sofala, are those of Manica, which are in wide Champaines compassed with mountaines, ninety miles in circuit. The places where the gold is, ap∣peare and are knowne by the drinesse and barrennesse of the soile, as if Nature it selfe could not hord vp gold in her spacious chests, but she must needs proue bare and bar∣ren of her wonted good workes; and how much lesse vnnaturall and degenerate man∣kinde? The Prouince is called Matuca, the people Botonghi, which (although they
are betweene the Line and the Tropike) yet in Winter haue such snowes in the moun∣taines, that if any abide there, they die frozen in them; and in Summer-time the aire in the tops of those hills is so cleare and pure, that some of our men, which were then there, saw the new Moone, the same day that she had kissed her bright and bountifull brother. And who can now charge the bright eye of the world, with the obscure darkenesse of this Peoples hue, which so cold Winters, nor pure Summers, can lessen or lighten? Yea euen in the cold Countries neere the Cape of Good-hope, the Aethiopians haue no hope or happe of better colour; whereas the hotter Countries of Libya, and in manner all America (notwithstanding the Sunnes strait looking, and neerenesse, not allowing them a shadow to attend them in the greatest height of his bounty) know not this blacke tincture in the naturalls thereof. But to returne (and who will not returne?) to the Mines: There are other Mines in the Prouinces of Boro and Quiticui, in which, and in the riuers, is found gold not so pure. The people are carelesse and negligent to get, and the Moores which traded with them, were faine to giue their wares in trust, with promise by such a time to pay them in gold, and the people would not faile in their word. Other Mines are in Toroa, wherein are those buildings which Barrius attributeth to some forren As the Por∣tugals haue  eir Castles Mina, Sofa∣la, &c. so some Prince, Master fometimes of those Mines. Prince, and I, for the reasons before alledged, to Salomon. It is a square fortresse, of stone; the stones of marueilous greatnesse, without any signe of morter or other matter to oyne them. The wall fiue and twenty spannes thicke, the height not holding proportion. Ouer the gates are letters, which learned Moores could nei∣ther reade nor know what letters they were. There are other buildings besides, of like fashion. The people call them the Court; for an officer keepes it for the Benomo∣tapa, and hath charge of some of his women, that are there kept. They esteeme them beyond humane power to build, and therefore account them the workes of Diuels; and the Moores which saw them, said the Portugals Castles were no way to be com∣pared to them. They are fiue hundred and ten miles from Sofala, Westward, in one and twentie degrees of Southly Latitude: in all which space is not found one buil∣ding ancient or later; the people are rude, and dwell in cottages of timber. All the people of this Region is of curled haire, and more ingenious then those which are against Mosambique, Quiloa and Mclinde, among whom are many that eat mans flesh, and let their kine bloud to satisfie their thirst. These seeme prone to receiue the Faith: for they beleeue in One GOD, whom they call Mozo and haue no Idols, not worship other thing: They punish nothing more seuerely then Witchcraft, whereun∣to other Negros are exceedingly addicted; no such person escapeth death. The like detestation they conceiue against Adultery and Theft. Euery one may haue as many wiues as they will: but the first is principall, the other serue her; and her children are heires. A woman is not marriageable with them, till her Naturall purgation testifie for her abilitie to Conception: and therefore they entertaine the first fluxe therof with a great Feast. In two things they are religious; in Obseruation of dayes, and Rites concerning their dead. Of dayes, they obserued the first day of the Moone, the sixt, the seuenth, the eleuenth, the sixteenth, the seuenteenth, the twentieth, and the eight and twen∣tieth, because in that day their King was borne. The religion is in the first, sixt, and seuenth, all the rest are repetitions, aboue ten. When any is dead, after his bodie is eaten, his neere kindred, or his wife which hath had most children by him, keepe the bones, with some signes whereby to know, whose they were: and eue∣ry seuenth day they obserue Exequies in the same place where they are kept: They spread many cloaths, and set thereon tables furnished with bread and sodden flesh, which they offer to the dead with prayers and supplications. And the principall thing they request of them, is, the good successe of their Kings affaires. These prayers they make, being cloathed in white garments: after which, the good-man and his family eat their offerings. The Benomotapa must weare cloathes of the same Countrey, for feare of infection; others may weare forren cloath. He is serued on the knee, and
when he drinketh or cougheth, all they which are about him make a shout, that all the Towne may know. None may cough in his presence: also, euery one must sit in token of reuerence; to stand, is a signe of dignitie, which he affordeth the Portugals and Moores, and is the chiefe honor can be yeelded any. The second honor is to sit on a cloath in his house: the third, that a man may haue a doore in his house, which is the dignity of great Lords. For meaner persons, they need not feare to haue any thing stolne out of their open houses, seeling the seueritie of Iustice doth secure them. Doores are not for necessitie, but for honor. Their houses are of pyramidall or steeple forme, all the timbers meeting in the middest at the toppe: couered with earth and straw. Some of them are made of timbers, as long and bigge as a great shippes mast: the grea∣ter they are, the more honorable. The Benomotapa hath musike whither so euer he goeth, with singers: and more then fiue hundred iesters, which haue their captaine or master of Mis-rule. The royall en∣signe is a little plow-share, with an iuory point, which he carrieth always at his girdle; by which is signified peace, and husbanding of the ground. He beareth likewise one or two Porta vna  due Zagaie. Bot saith, vna Zapoa,  due dardi: a mattocke and two darts. swords in token of Iustice, and defence of his people. The Countrey is free; and giues him no other payments, but presents, when they come to speake with him: and certaine dayes seruice. No inferiour comes before his superiour without some pre∣sent, in token of obedience and courtesie. The Captaines of warre with all theirs be∣stow seuen dayes in thirtie in his husbandry or other businesse. He must confirme all sentences of Iudgement in his owne person: there needs no prison, for matters are pre∣sently dispatched, according to the allegations and testimonies that are brought. And if there be not sufficient testimonies, then the matter is tried by oath, in this manner. They beat the barke of a certaine tree, and cast the powder thereof in water; Of such like water, see the next Chapter. which the partie drinketh, and if he doe not vomit, he is cleared; if he vomit, he is condem∣ned. And if the accuser, when the accused partie vomiteth not, will drinke of the same, and doth not vomit, he is then acquitted, and the matter dispatched. If any sue to him, he speedeth not, but by mediation of a third person, which also sets downe the summe that the King must haue, sometime at so deare rate, that the suter rather refu∣seth the Kings grant. They haue no horse, and therefore warre on foot: The spoiles are generally shared amongst all. When he marcheth, in the place where he is to lodge they make a new house of wood, and therein must continuall fire be kept, without euer going out; saying, that in the ashes might be wrought some witcheries to the inda∣magement of his person. And when they go to the warres, they neuer wash their hands nor faces, till they haue obtained victory. They haue their wiues with them, which are so loued and respected, that if the Kings sonne meet with one of them in the street, he giues her way. Benomotapa hath more then a thousand women; but the first is Princi∣pall, although she be inferiour in bloud, and her sonne succeeds. And in seed-time and haruest, the Queene goeth to the field and ouer-seeth the stuffe, esteeming it a great honor. Thus farre out of Barrius. Iohannes Boterus Gi.Bot.B.pag.I. tells, That his chiefe warriours are women, namely, cer∣taine Amazones, which feare off their left pappes, as Odoardo Od. Lopes Cogo hist.lib..cap.9. Lopez reporteth, least they should hinder their shooting, after the manner of the auncient Ama∣zones: they are quicke, bold, couragious, and constant in battell, and most constant in inconstancie: for when they make shew of flight, they will returne (espying their aduantage) with the greatest fury. They dwell in certaine countries by themselues, and at certaine times haue men to accompany with them for generation, to whom they send their males; reseruing all the female children which they haue. Thus we finde Amazons, which the Ancients reported in Asia, and Diodorus Libya, now in these times, if this report be true, in Aethiopia: and Huldericus Shmidel histo∣ria Nautgat. in Am.cap.37. Shmidel hath told of the like in America. In the yeare 1560. Consalvus Eman. Acosta Rerum in oriente gest. Comment. Silueria, with two other Iesuites, went from Goa to the Kingdomes of Inhamban, and Monomotapa: and coming to Inhamban, they went to Tonge, the Citie royall, where they baptised the King and all his people in a short space, naming the King, Constantine, the Queene, Mary. Thence went Consalvus
to Monomotapa, and so preuailed with his Images, Preaching, and Contempt of the world, that he wanne the King and his mother, with multitudes of others to Baptisme. But soone after the King, by suggestion of the Moores, slew him. Schastian in reuenge raised an armie of sixteene hundred, Rter part.2. lib.3. most of them being Gentlemen, which he sent vnder the conduct of Francis Barretto. The Benomotapa fearing the Portugals forces, offered reasonable conditions, which Barretto refusing, was discomfited, not by the Negro, but by the aire; the malignitie whereof (the sowre sauce of all these golden Countries in Africa) consumed his people. There are other Kingdomes adioyning to Monomotapa, and the mountaines of the Moone, Matana, Melemba, Quinbebe, Ber∣teca, Bauagul, of which I can giue you but the names. Caphraria, or the Land of the Caphars is next to be considered, which Maginus boundeth betweene Rio di spirito sancto, and Cape Negro, extending to the Cape of good hope Southwards. Why hee should call this part the Caphars, I know not: for the Arabians, of whom this word is borrowed, giue that name to all the Heathen people in Africa: yea both the Arabians, and all of their religion, call all such as re∣ceiue not that superstition, Caphars, euen Christians also, as Master Ienkinson A. Ienkinson in Hakl. tom.. pag 327. long since told vs. And for the Heathens in Africa, Barrius affirmeth, that it is by the Moores giuen to them all: signifying, Without Law, or lawlesse people. Zanguebar is in this respect called Cafraria. It should seeme it is appropriated to these the Sou∣therliest Nations of Africa; for want of other the more true proper names which were vnknowne. With the names of the Capes, and other places of note, Master Po∣ry Pory before .c. hath already acquainted his English Reader: Onely that notable and famous Cape of good hope (so named Osor. de reb. m. lib.I. This was An. 1487. The discouerie therof is lage∣ly related by Io.di Barros in his first Decade of Asia lib.3. by Iohn the second, King of Portugal, for that hope which hee conceiued of a way to the Indies, when it was first discouered) deserueth some mention. It hath three head-lands, the Westermost whereof beareth name of Good hope, the middlemost, Cabo fals, because they haue sometimes, in their returne from the Indies, mistaken this for the former: betweene which two Capes runneth in∣to the Sea a mightie Riuer, called by the Portugals, Rio dule, which springeth out of a Lake called Gale, situate among the mountaines of the Moone, so much celebrated by the ancient Geographers: The third and Eastermost, is that of Agulhas or Needles, about fiue and twenty leagues from the first: both which seeme as two hornes, where∣with it threatens the Ocean, which in these parts is found oftentimes 'Bartholom Dias, who first discouered this Cape, called it Ca. Tormeuts, in regard of the troubles and dangers he there sustained. tempestuous, and when it cannot preuaile against this rough-faced and horned Promontory, it wrekes the whole malice vpon the shippes, whose ribbes, in the enraged fits, it would breake if they were of iron; as Linshoen Linscot.lib.I. cap.93. Nauig. Verbussi. testisieth of his owne experience. True it is, that sometimes it is passed with more ease; but not so vsually: and Linshoten tells, that at his returne from India, the Saint Thomas, a new Carrick, was heere cast away, They found it there in A∣prill as cold as with vs in Winter, when it freezeth not: and yet the people are blacke. and their shippe, wherein he sailed, in such danger, that one while they prayed, another while murmured, another time would returne backe, and the Captaine pro∣fessed no small maruell why our LORD suffered such good Catholikes to endure such torments, and the English Heretikes, and blasphemers to passe so easily. The waues there (saith he) strike against a shippe, as if they stroke against a hill, that if it were of stone it would at last be broken. Heere Captaine Sir Iames Lancaster. Hakl.tom.2. part.2. Lancaster traded with the people, and for two kniues bought an oxe, for one, a sheepe, &c. in good quantitie. Their sheepe are great, with great tailes, but hairy, not woolled. Their oxen great, not fat, but well fleshed. The Captaine killed there an Antelope as bigge as a Colt. There were diuers great beasts vnknowne to them. When they had passed this Cape, they lost their Admirall Captaine Raimond, and neuer saw them, or heard of them more. And foure dayes after they found as terrible an enemie from aboue, and encountered with a thunder-clap, which slew foure of their men out-right, their neckes being wrung asunder: And of fourescore and fourteene men there was not one vntouched, but some were blinde, others bruised in their legges and armes, or brests, others drawne out, as if they had beene racked; which all yet, GOD be thanked, did after recouer. The Hollanders in the yeare 1595. traffiked with the Cafres, which were valiant,
but base in apparell, couered with Oxe or sheepe-skinnes wrapped about their shoul∣ders, with the hairy side inward, in forme of a mantle: their priuy-parts couered with a sheepes taile, fastened before and behinde with a girdle. But now we see it made a daily matter to the Portugal, English, and Dutch, so capable of hope of Good, that the Cape of Good hope is nothing feared: although at home many haue no good hope of publike good, and wish that they would carry out of Europe lesse money, and bring home more men. For my part, I wish so well to Nauigation and discoueries, that I could wish such complaints to be but calumnies, and to be the knauigations of false discouerers. I cannot omit, Botero. that vpon the toppe of this Promontory, Nature hath as it were framed her selfe a delightfull bower, heere to sit and contemplate the great Seas, which from the South, East and West bea vpon this shore: and therefore hath heere formed a great plaine, pleasant in situation, which with the fragrant herbes, va∣rietie of flowers, and flourishing verdure of all things, seemes a terrestriall Paradise. It is called the table of the Cape. That which from hence lieth to Cape Negro, hath not to our purpose any thing notable. This also deserueth mention, that notwithstan∣ding all the damages of this dreadfull Promontory, and the seas on this side and be∣yond, Moffus hist. Ind.l.II.1535. Iames Botellius a Portugal, to recouer the fauour of his Prince, Iohn the third, by the first bringing newes of a happy accident that then befell in India, in a little boat or vessell scarse eighteene foot long, and six broad, sailed from Cochin to Dabul, and from thence alongst the Arabian and African shores, doubling this Terrible Cape, and missing Saint Helena, came yet safe to Lisbone, worthily welcomed both for his mes∣sage, and the messenger, that durst aduenture to encounter Neptunes strongest forces, notwithstanding so weake furniture. The Hollanders De Bry Iad. Or. part.3. at the Cape of Good hope, had of the inhabitants two kine for two rustie kniues, and one much greater for a new one: two fat bulls and three sheepe for a barre of iron, weighing threescore and ten pounds. The people make much account of iron: they are of short stature: darkish colour: their armes are adorned with copper and iuory, their fingers with rings of gold, and with beads of bone and wood. They brand their bodies with diuers markes. And because they alway annoint themselues with grease and fat, they yeeld a ranke smell. If we killed a beast for our vse, they would aske the inwards, and eat them raw, the filth being not well cleansed from them. At their Feasts they would seeth a beast in his hide, fastned on foure stickes with fire vnderneath. They liued miserably, yet for gallantry ware bones and peeces of dried flesh about their neckes. Neere this Cape are weeds growing in the sea fiue and twentie fathome long. The Ascension Cap.Rob.Co∣uert. built their Pinnesse Anno 1608. at Soldania, about fifteene or six∣teene leagues from the Cape of Good Hope, and there tooke in for their prouision a∣bout foure hundred head of cattell, as Oxen, Steeres, Sheepe, and Lambes, together with fowles and fresh water. They filled their boat with Seales at the Ile Pengwin, a little from thence. Such was the brutish nature of the inhabitants, that when the Eng∣lish had cast out of their shippe one of those Seales, and the same had lien fourteene dayes, and now swarmed with crawling Maggots, they would take them vp and eate them; as they would also doe the guts, garbage, and panch of the beasts. They more esteemed iron, then gold or siluer. Heere the first night after they weighed anchor, The Ascension lost the Vnson and the Good Hope, their Pinnesse (so neere the Cape of Good Hope) which, me thinkes, obseruing what after besell them, seemes an ommous presage, written in these names, of their other losses which followed, concluded with the losse of their shippe on the coast of Cambaya. It is morally true, that ascending and aspiring mindes lose Vnion ( Prou.13.10. for onely by pride doth man make Contention) Vnion being gone, Good Hope followeth, Qn concordia cresnnt discordia & res & spes pe∣reunt: and so it befell in this their tragedie, after the losse of those vessels which bare such names. The shippe was lost by the Masters indiscretion, but yet hath the honor (suruiuing her fates) that she was the first English shippe that euer sailed on those seas. The people were saued, and trauelled from Surrat to Brainport, a Citie bigger then London, of great trading, and so passed till they came to the Great Mogors Court at
Agra, where they saw the beginning of a goodly Monument, which he hath beene nine yeares in building, for his father, with fiue thousand work-men continually: the matter is fine marble, the forme nine-square, two English miles about, and nine stories in height, whereon the Mogor said (as a Frier there reported) that he would bestow an hundred millions of treasure. From thence some of them passed by land to Bucker and Sucker, (as he calls them) and thence through Persia to Baydat, and so to Aleppo, from whence they came for England: which land-trauell through three so mightie States of the Great Mogor, Soph, and Turke, had deserued mention elsewhere in more proper place, if then it had come to my hands. But let vs returne(left this Ascension or extension of our Discourse bring it to the like shipwrack) vnto the Aethiopian Cafres. Modesty had almost forbidden me to recite that, which may with some easily ob∣taine a Plaudite, in the last Act and finishing of this Chapter, concerning the Caffares. Linschoten Linschot.c.41. shall recite it for me. They liue, saith he, like beasts (he speaketh of those which liue neere Mosambique, and those especially more within the Land) they are blacke as pitch, with flat noses, thicke lippes, some haue holes both aboue and vnder in their lippes, and, as it were, other mouthes in their cheekes, wherein they thruft small bones to beautifie themselues: for which cause they rase and seare their bodies with irons. If they will make a diuellish forme and picture, they represent a white man in his apparell, as thinking nothing more vgly. Some also file their teeth as sharpe as needles. They haue Villages wherein they dwell together, and in euery Village a Lord or King, to whom they are subiect. Religion and Faith are vnknowne to them. They vse mutuall warres, and some eat mans flesh. When they take prisoners in war, or kill their enemies, they obserue a more then beastly testimony of their great valour, which is after this manner. They cut off their priuy members (to depriue them of all hope of generation) and then drie them well for preseruation: after which, they come before the King with great reuerence, in the presence of the principall men of the Vil∣lages, and there take these members, so dried, one by one in their mouthes, and spit them on the ground at the Kings feet, which the King with great thankes accepteth; and the more to honor them, causeth them all to be taken vp, and giuen to them a∣gaine, which is from thenceforth an ensigne of their Knight-hood. For they take all those members, and tie them on a string like a bracelet or chaine; and at all solemne meetings, as when they marry, or goe to a Wedding or Feast, the Bride, or wiues of these Knights, doe weare that chaine about their neckes, being, saith our Author, a∣mong them as great an honor as the Golden Fleece, or the renowned Garter with vs, and their wiues as proud, as if some Crowne or Scepter had befallen them. CHAP. IX. Of the Kingdome of Congo, and the other Kingdomes and Nations adioyning. THe Kingdome Maginus. Gi. Botero Ben.part.I. of Congo (vnderstanding so much by the name, as in times past hath beene subiect thereto) hath on the West, the Occan; on the South, the Caphars, and mountaines of the Moone; on the East, those hills from which the Riuers issue and runne into the foun∣taines of Nilus; and on the North, the Kingdome of Benin. Of these Countries, Pigfetta Od.Lop.per Pigafet. trans∣lated by A.H.P.du Iarric. hist. Ind. Orient. part.3. from the relation of Odoardo Lopez, a Portu∣gal, hath written two bookes, out of whom P.du larric, Boter and others, haue taken most of their reports. And in this we will beginne with the most Southerly parts; in which we first come into the Kingdome of Matama (this is the Kings proper name) who being a Gentile, ruleth ouer uers Prouinces, named Quimbebe. This is a Kingdome Od.Lopez lib.I.cap.7. great and mightie, extending from Brauagal to Bagamidri: the aire thereof is holesome, the earth
outwardly furnished with store of fruits, in wardly with mines of Cristall and other mettals. The Segniories towards the Sea-coast are very meane, and want Hauens. Angola sometime a Prouince of the Kingdome of Congo, is now a great Kingdome i selfe, and very populous. They speake the same language, with small difference of dialect, that is vsed in Congo, whose yoake they cast off since the Congois became Christians. Diego Barr. Dec. . lib. 2. cap. 3. Od. Lopez ibid. Can first discouered these parts for the Portugals, An.1486. And the Portugals vsed to trade quietly with the Angolans: but some of them trading as high into the Country as Cabazza, the royall City, which is an hundred and fifty miles from the Ocean, were there by order from the King put to the sword, vnder pretence of intended treason. This was done 1578. Panlo Dias (to whom the King Sebastian had giuen the gouernment of these parts, with licence to conquer three and thirty leagues alongst the coast to him and his heires) to reuenge himselfe for this despight done to his people, armed such Portugals as he had, and with two Gallies and other vessels, which he kept in the Riuer Coanza, he went on both sides the Riuer, conque∣ring and subduing many Lords vnto him. The King of Angola raised a mighty armie of a million of men, P.Diaz (as some report) sent a present to Spaine, of two buts of Negros noses, which were slaine. A.B. as is supposed. For they vse to leaue none at home that is fit to carry a weapon: and make no preparation for victuall, but such, as haue any, carrie it vpon the shoulders of their seruants, and therefore no maruell if their food being soone consumed, their Campes be soone dissolued. Small likewise is their prouision of armour for offence, and for defence much lesse. Diaz sent to the King of Congo for aid, who sent him sixty thousand men: with which, and his owne Nation, he made his party good, against the confused rabbles of the Angolans. The trade of Angola is yet continued, and from thence the Portugals buy and carry to Brasil and other parts yearely, a world of slaues, which are bought within the Land, and are captiues taken in their warres. One Thomas Thom.Turner. Turner that had liued a long time in Brasil, and had also beene at Angola, told me, that it was supposed eight and twenty thousand slaues were yearely shipped from Angola and Congo, at the Hauen of Loanda. He named to me a rich Portugal in Brasil, which had ten thousand of his owne, working in his Inge∣nios (of which he had eighteene) and in his other employments. His name was Iohn de Paus, exiled from Portugal, and thus enriched in Brasil. A thousand of his slaues, at one time, entered into conspiracy with nine thousand other slaues in the Countrey, and barricadoed themselues for their best defence against their Masters, who had much adoe to reduce some of them into their former seruitude. To returne to Angola, we may adde the report of another of our Countrey-men, Andrew Bat∣tell was taken by the Portu∣gals on the coast of Brasil, and shipped o∣uer to Congo, where (and in the Countries adiacent) he liued very ma∣ny yeares, and was Sergeant of a Band, &c. Andrew Battell (my neere neighbour, dwelling at Leigh in Essex) who serued vnder Manuel Silnera Pèrera, Gouernor vnder the King of Spaine, at his Citie of Saint Paul: and with him went farre into the Countrey of Angola, their army being eight hundred Portugals, and fifty thousand Naturals. This Andrew Battell telleth that they are all Heathens in Angola. They had their Idols of wood in the middest of their townes, fa∣shioned like a Negro, and at the foot thereof was a great heape of Elephants teeth, containing three or foure tunnes of them: these were piled in the earth, and vpon them were set the skulls of dead-men, which they had slaine in the watres, in monument of their victory. The Idoll they call Mokisso, and some of them haue houses built ouer them. If any be sicke, he accounteth it Mokisso's hand, and sendeth to appease his angry god, with powring wine (which they haue of the Palme-tree) at his feet. They haue pro¦per names of distinction for their Mokissos, as Kissung, Kalkete, &c. and vse to sweare by them, Kissungowy, that is, by Kissango. They haue another more solemne oath, intri∣all of controuersies: This triall is called Motam∣ba. for which purpose they lay a kinde of hatchet, which they haue, in the fire, and the Ganga-Mokisso, or Mokissos Priest taketh the same redde hot, and draweth it neere to the skinne of the accused partie; and if there be two, hee causeth their legges to be set neere together, and draweth this hot iron without touching be∣tweene them; if it burnes, that partie is condemned as guiltie, otherwise he is freed. For the ceremonies about the dead, they first wash him, then paint him, thirdly apparell him in new clothes, and then bring him to his graue, which is made like a vault, after it is digged a little way down, vndermined, and made spacious within, and
there set him on a seat of earth, with his beads (which they vse in chaines and brace∣lets for ornament) and the most part of his goods, with him in his lasting home. They kill Goats, and shed the bloud in the graues, and powre wine there, in memoriall of the dead. They are much giuen Od. Lopez. to diuination by birds. If a bird flie on their left hand, or cry in some manner which they interpret ominous and vnluckie, they will cease from the enterprises which they haue in hand. Their Priests are Gi.Bot.B.part.I.lib.3. called Gange, and so highly re∣puted, that the people thinke it in their power to send plenty or scarsity, life or death. They are skilfull in Medicinall herbes, and in poysons; and by familiarity with the Di∣uell foretell things to come. In Angola cuery man taketh as many wiues as he will. There are mines of siluer, and of most excellent copper. They haue many kine, but loue dogges better then any other flesh, and sat them to the shambles. Andrew Battell told me, that the dogges in those Countries are all of one sort, prick-eared curres of a meane bignes, which they vse al∣so to hant with, but they open not; (for because they cannot barke) and therefore they hang clappers made of little boords about their neckes. He hath seene a mastiffe sold for three slaues. Lopez affirmeth that a great dog was exchanged for two and twenty slaues; which might happen vpon some extraordinary occasion. The money in Angola is glasse-beads, which they vse also, as is said, for ornament. The King of Angola hath seemed willing to become Christian, and hath sent to the King of Congo for that pur∣pose, but could not obtaine any Priests in that scarcity to instruct him. This Kingdome hath many Lord-ships subiect thereto, as farre on the Sea-coast as C. Negro. Towards a Lake, called Aquelunda, lieth a Countrey called Quizama, the Inhabitants whereof being gouerned after the manner of a Common-wealth, haue shewed themselues friendly to the Portugals, and helped them in their warres against Angola. The houses in Angola are made in fashion like a Bee-hiue. The women at the first sight of the new Moone, turne vp their bummes, in despight, as offended with their menstruous courses which they ascribe vnto her. The men sometimes in a valo∣rous resolution, will deuote themselues vnto some haughty attempt in the warres: and taking leaue of the King, will vow neuer to returne, till they bring him a horse-head, or some other thing very dangerous in the enterprise, and will either doe it or die. Horse-tailes are great iewels, and two slaues will be giuen for one taile, which com∣monly they bring from the Riuer of Plate, where horses are exceedingly encreased and growne wilde. They will, by fiering the grasse round about, hemme the horses a∣bout with a fiery circle, the fire still streightning and approching neerer, till they haue aduantage enough to kill them: Thus haue the Europaean cattell of horse and kine so encreased in that other world, as they spare not to kill the one for their hides, and the other for their tailes. Next to Angola Northwards, Od. Lopez. is the Kingdome of Congo, the Westerne line whereof Lopez extendeth three hundred threescore and fifteene miles; the Northerne, fiue hundred and forty; the Easterne, fiue hundred; and the Southerne, three hundred and threescore. The bredth thereof from the mouth of Zaire, crossing ouer the moun∣taines of the Sunne, and the mountaines of Crystall, is six hundred miles. And yet is it much streightned of the ancient bounds, only the title except, which still holdeth the old stile: Don Aluaro King of Congo, and of Abundos, and of Matama, and of Quiza∣ma, and of Angola, and of Cacongo, and of the seuen Kingdomes of Congere Amo∣laza, and of the Langelungos, and Lord of the Riuer Zaire, and of the Anziquos, and Anziquana, and of Loango. The present Kingdome is diuided into six Prouinces, Bamba, Songo, Sundi, Pango, Batta, Pemba. Bamba is the chiefe for greatnesse and riches, then gouerned by Don Sebastian Mani-Bamba: the word Mani is a title of ho∣nor, and signifieth a Prince or Lord: when need requireth, the Mani-Bamba may haue in campe foure hundred thousand men of warre. Therein are mines of siluer: and on the Sea-coast, a kinde of shells which they vse for money, for siluer and gold is not vsed for money amongst them. In this Prounce are yearely bought by the Portugals aboue fiue thousand Negros. There are among them very mightie men, that will
cleaue a slaue in the middest, or cut off a bulls head at one blow. Yea one of them did beare on his arme a vessell of wine, containing the fourth part of a Butt, and might weigh three hundred and fiue and twenty pound, vntill it was cleane emptied. There are certaine creatures as big as Rammes, and haue wings like Dragons, with long tailes and chappes, and diuers rowes of teeth, and feed vpon raw flesh. Their colour is blew and greene, their skinne be-painted like scales, and they haue but two feet. These the Pagan Negro's doe worship for gods, and at this day many of them are kept for a mi∣racle. And because they are very rare, the chiefe Lords doe curiously preserue them, and suffer the people to worship them, in regard of the profit which accreweth to them by the offerings which the people make vnto them. Other Creatures of these parts are mentioned in the first Chapter of this booke. Peacockes are not common, and are very deare, their seathers being vsed for royall ensignes. The King of Angola bring∣eth vp some in an inclosed wood, and suffereth none to keepe them but himselfe. To speake at large of the other fiue Prouinces, would be tedious to the Reader, and Ma∣ster History of Congo trans∣lated by Abra∣ham Hartwell. Hartwell hath taught Lopez to speake English, of whom such as are desirous, may be further satisfied. Ouer-against the Ile Loanda, where the shell-money is ga∣thered, is vpon the Continent the Towne of Saint Paul, inhabited with Portugals and their wiues. The Riuers of Congo are many, Bengo, Coanza, Dande, Lembe, Ozone, Loze, Anibriz, and the greatest of all, Zaire: all which haue some, either affinity in mutuall marriages of their streames, or consanguinity in the fountaines from whence they flow, which are certaine Lakes, the first of which is Zembre, the other Aquelunda. In all these Riuers are common the rarities of Nilus, the ouer-flowing of the waters, Ri∣uer-horses, Crocodiles, and such like. Andrew Battell told me of a huge Crocodile, which was reported to haue eaten a whole Alibamba, that is, a company of eight or nine slaues chained together, and at last paid for his greedinesse: the chaine holding him slaue, as before it had the Negroes, and by his vndigestible nature deuouring the deuourer; remaining in the belly of him after he was found, in testimony of this victo∣rie. He hath seene them watch and take their prey, hailing a Gennet, man, or other creature into the waters. A souldiour thus drawne in by a Crocodile, in shallower wa∣ters, with his knife wounded him in the belly, and slew him. In their summer it rai∣neth not, and then the places in their winter (the time of the Sunnes neerest presence, attended with daily raines) couered with water, doe grow thicke, and matted with a∣bundance of little trees, herbes and plants, with the fatned wombe of that moist soile, conceiueth by the directer beames of the Sunne, which the ouer-flowing waters in the winter carry away, as it were small They call these patches of ground thus carried in Zaire, Balsa's. Ilands, lifting them vp together with the rootes and soile, the yong trees and deere standing and growing thereon, carried captiue vn∣to Neptunes eternall prisons. In Bengo and Coanza they are forced to set vp, for a time, houses vpon cratches, their other houses being taken vp for the Riuers lodgings. Zaire is of such force, that no shippe can get in against the current, but neere to the shore: yea it preuailes against the Oceans saltness threescore, and as some say, fourescore miles, within the Sea, before his proud waues yeeld their full homage, and receiue that salt temper in token of subiection. Such is the haughtie spirit of that streame, which ouer-running the low Countries as it passeth, and swollen with conceit of dai∣ly conquests, and daily supplies, which in armies of showers are by the clouds sent to his succour, runnes now in a furious rage, thinking euen to swallow the Ocean, which before he neuer saw, with his mouth wide gaping, eight and twentie miles, as Lopez affirmeth, in the opening; but meeting with a more Giant-like enemie, which lies lurking vnder the cliffes to receiue his assault, is presently swallowed in that wider wombe; yet so, as alwayes being conquered, he neuer giues ouer, but in an eternall quarrell, with deepe indented srownes in his angrie face, foming with disdaine, and filling the aire with noise, (with fresh helpe) supplies those forces which the salt-sea hath consumed. In this Riuer is a Fish called Ambize, Angulo, or Hog-fish, that hath, as it were, two hands, and a taile like a Target, which eateth like Porke, and whereof they make Larde, and hath not the sauour or taste of fish. It seedeth on
the grasse that groweth on the bankes of the Riuer, and neuer goeth out: it hath a mouth like the mozell of an Oxe: there are of them that weigh fiue hundred pound a peece. About the yeare 1490. Iohn the second, King of Portugal, sent Consalno di Sosa, with three shippes, and Priests in them, to bring the King and people of Congo to Christian Religion, Of the con∣uersion of Congo, reade 10. di Batros. Dec.3.l.3.c.10. and Osorius de reb. Emanuelis, lib 3. and Maffaeus. hist. ind. lib.i. and Lo∣pez. lib. 2. and Got.Arthus hist. Ind. Orientalis, lib. 14.15.16.17. which was effected; and although hence arose ciuill warres amongst them, yet the matter was at last ended to the aduancement of the Christian Religion (such as the Portugals taught, and no doubt infinitely better then their Pa∣gan superstition, howsoeuer spotted with many Romish staines) And from that time to this, now an hundred and twentie yeares, hath Congo continued Christian, vn∣der Iohn, Alfonso, Piedro, and the rest of their Kings. When the first Bishoppe of Saint Thomas went into Congo, to take possession of his Pastorall charge there (for the Kingdome of Congo was annexed to the Bishop∣rike of Saint Thomas) from the Sea-side to the Citie, which is an hundred and fiftie miles, King Piedro caused the wayes to bee made smooth and trimme, and couered ouer with mattes, that the Bishoppe should not set his feet vpon any part of the ground, not adorned: all the wayes, trees, and higher places swarming with people, offering Lambes, Kiddes, Chickins, Partriches, Venison, Fish, and other necessaries, to testifie their zeale. And at last arriuing at the Citie of Saint Sauiours (before called Banza, which signifieth a Court, and is commonly attributed to all the chiefe Cities, where the King of any of those Countries holdeth his residence) hee was there recei∣ued by the King and his Nobles, and ordained the Church there to be the Cathedrall Church of his See, which had belonging to it eight and twentie Canons, with other Officers, and ornaments vsuall. After Don Piedro succeeded Francisco, and after him, Diego: who being dead, his sonne and two other Competitours of the Kingdome were slaine, and Henrico, brother to Diego, was made King, and after his death, Aluar, whom the Giacchi draue out of his Kingdome, till King Sebastian sent Francesco di Gone to expell them. The greatest, and most zealous Prince for Christian Religion, was Alphonso, who, on paine of death, forbad to all his subiects the hauing, or worshipping of Idols, which he commanded should be all brought, and deliuered to the Lieutenants of the Countrey, together with their Characters and Witcheries. For before euery Lopez. man adored that which best liked him: some, those Dragons before spoken of; others, Ser∣pents, which they nourished with their daintiest prouisions. Some worshipped the greatest Goats they could get; some, Tigres; and the more vncouth and deformed any beasts were, the more in their beastly and deformed superstition were they obserued. Battes, Owles, and Scritch-owles, birds of darknesse, were the obiects of their dar∣kened Deuotions; Snakes and Adders enuenomed their soules, with a more deadly poyson, then they could doe their bodies. Beasts, Birds, Herbes, Trees, Characters, and the formes of those things painted and grauen, yea the skinnes of them, being dead, bring stuffed with straw, had their shares in this diffused varietie, and confused masse of irreligious Religion. The ceremonies they vsed to them, were, kneeling on their knees, casting themselues groueling on the earth, defiling their faces with dust, verball prayers, reall offerings. They had their Witches, which made the people be∣leeue that their Idols could speake: and if any man had recouered of any sicknesse, af∣ter he had recommended himsefe to them, they would affirme that the angry Idol was now appeased. All these Idols King Alphonso caused to be burned in one heape in stead whereof the Portugals gaue them Images of Saints, and Crucifixes to worship. This may seeme an exchange rather, then a ceasing from superstition, were not some fundamentall and especiall substrance of Truth communicated, besides those blinde shadowes, wherewith (no doubt) GOD draweth some out of darkenesse, this dark∣nesse notwithstanding, in a true and sauing, though a dimme and shadowed light; wherewith as farre going before vs in affection, as we before them in knowledge; I dare not but in the hope of the saluation of some, thanke GOD for this glimse of
heauenly light, rather then rashly to censure and sentence them to a totall and hellish darkenesse. Emanuel Maus hist. Ind.lib. 3.& 15. since sent supplies of religious persons, to confirme them in their Chri∣stianitie, and his sonne, Iohn the third, sent also Iesuites to that purpose, who ere∣cted Schooles among them: and they also send their sonnes into Portugal to learne the Sciences and knowledge of Europe. GOD Almighty grant that those fountaines may be cleaed of all popish mire, that thence more holesome waters may flow, to the watering of this Aethiopian Vineyard. They vse in Congo Arthus ca.15.Linschot.lib.2. Andrew Ba'tell saith, that the tree which thus strangely multiplieth it selfe, is called the Manga tree. to make cloathes of the Enzanda tree, (of which some write the same things that are reported of the Indian Fig-tree, that it sends forth a hairy substance from the branches, which no sooner touch the ground, but they take roote and grow vp, in such sort, that one tree would multiply it selfe into a wood, if Nature set not some obstacle.) The inner-most barke of the Inzanda, by beating, is made excellent cloath. Other trees there are, which the Tides couer, and are disco∣uered by the Ebbes, laden at the roote with Oisters. But more admirable is that huge tree called Alicunde, of which my friend Andrew Battell And. Battell. supposeth some are as bigge (besides their wonderfull tallnesse) as twelue men can fathome. It spreads like an Oake. Some of them are hollow, and the liberall clowdes into those Natu∣rall Caskes dispense such plentie of water, that one time three or foure thousand of them in that hote region, continued foure and twentie houres at one of those trees, which yeelded them all drinke of her watery store, and was not emptied. Their Ne∣gros climbed vp with pegges (for the tree is smooth, and therefore not otherwise to be climbed, and so soft, that it easily receiued pegges of a harder wood, driuen into her yeelding substance with a stone) and dipped the water, as it had beene, out of a Well. He supposed that there is fortie tunne of water in some one of them. It yeel∣deth them good opportunitie for hony, to which end the countrey-people make a kinde of Chest, with one hole into the same, and hang it vpon one of these trees; which they take downe once a yeare, and with fire and smoake chasing or killing the Bees, take thence a large quantitie of hony. Neither is it liberall alone to the hungrie and thirstie appetite, but very bountifully it cloathes their backes, with the barke thereof, which being taken from the yonger Alicundes and beaten, one fathome which they cut out of the tree, will by this meanes extend it selfe into twentie, and presently is cloath fit for Linschot.lib..Lopez. These Boats, saith Andrew Battell, are made of ano∣ther tree, for the Acunde is of too spun∣gie a suostance for that pur∣pose. wearing; though not so fine as that which the Inzanda∣tree yeeldeth. It serues them also for boats, one of which cut out in proportion of a Scute, will hold hundreths of men. Of their Palme-trees, which they keepe with watering and cutting euery yeare, they make Veluets, Sattens, Taffatas, Damaskes, Sarcenets, and such like, out of the cleansed and purged leaues thereof drawing long and euen threeds for that pur∣pose. And for their Palme-wiues, which they draw out of the toppe of a kinde of Palme, which at first is strong and inebriating wine, and in time declineth to a sowre and holesome vineger: of the stone of the fruit, which is like an Almond, they also make bread, of the shale of the fruit, Oyle, which also serueth them for Butter: Lopez distinguisheth this tree from the Coco tree, which is there also growing: and another Palme that beareth Dates; other that beare Cola, like a Pine-apple, excel∣lent for the stomacke, and for the liuer most admirable: it being supposed, that the li∣uer of a Henne or other bird, putrified, sprinkled with this matter, recouereth the for∣mer freshnesse and soundnesse. Other sorts of Palmes yeeld other fruits, and of their leaues they make mattes, wherewith they couer their houses. Lopez saw a Pomeci∣tron, the kirnell whereof left within the rinde, yeelded a pretie tall sprigge in foure dayes. Of stones they haue such store to build with, that in some places they may cut out a Church of one peece. There are whole mountaines of Porphyrie, of Iasper, of white Marble, and other Marbles: One especiall, that yeeldeth faire Iacinthes, that are good Iewels, straked like as it were with naturall veines.
The Port and Ile of Loanda lying ouer-against the Portugall Towne of Saint Paul, famous for many things, deserueth especiall mention for this, that it yeel∣deth, in lesse then halfe a yard digging, waters very sweet; but of so contrary a Na∣ture to the Sea, her mightie neighbour, that when the Sea ebbeth, the water is salt, and when it floweth, the same is sweete and fresh: as if the Sea imparted that which it selfe hath not, or rather enuied that which it hath, and therefore alway at his com∣ming, re-demandeth that saltnesse from those springs, to attend vpon their Ocean-mother. So doe wee see the siluer Lampes of Heauen in the Sunnes absence to lighten the World, which yet want light, when it is most plentifull, to shew them∣selues. Euen nature sealeth and confirmeth Monopolies to her principall Cour∣tiers, alwayes prouided, that it thereby better serueth for the common good, and therefore no precedent to such dropsie and splen-like Monopolies, Monie-pollings, with which some exorbitant members burthen themselues, and make others by ligh∣ting, heauie: worthily therefore by the Sunne of our Great Britaine, at the first ri∣sing of his morning brightnesse, dispersed from our Horizon. But how farre is Loan∣da from Britaine? And yet our scope is to bring Loanda and all the world else in∣to our Britaine, that our Britaines might see the in and out-side of the same. Loan∣da is reported (as some affirme of Egypt and Nilus) to bee the issue of the Oceans sand, and Coanza's mire, which in processe of time brought forth in their disagreeing agreement, this Iland. In Congo the King is Lord supreme: and none hath power to bequeath his goods to his kindred, but the King is heire generall to all men. CHAP. X. Of Loango, the Anzichi, Giachi, and the great Lakes in those parts of the World. IT followeth in the course of our Discouery, to set you on shore in Loango, the Northerly neighbour of Congo, right vnder the Line, Lopez l.I.c.5. whose Countrey stretcheth two hundred miles within Land. The people are called Bramas, the King, Mani Loango; sometimes, as report goeth, subiect to the King of Congo. They are Circumcised after the manner of the Hebrewes, like as also the rest of the Nations of those Countries vse to be. They haue abundance of Elephants, and weare clothes of the Palme. Andrew Andrew Bat. Battell liued amongst them two yeares and a halfe. They are, saith hee, Heathens, and obserue many superstitions. They haue their Mo∣kisso's or Images, to which they offer according to the proportion of their sorts and suites: The Fisher offereth Fish, when he sueth for his helpe in his fishing; the Coun∣trey-man, Wheat; the Weauer, Alibungo's, peeces of cloath: other bring bottels of Wine: all wanting that they would haue, and bringing what they want, furnish∣ing their Mokisso with those things, whereof they complaine themselues to bee dis∣furnished. Their Ceremonies for the dead are diuers. They bring Goats and let them bleed at the Mokisso's foot, which they after consume in a Feasting memoriall of the decea∣sed partie: which is continued foure or fiue dayes together, and that foure or fiue se∣uerall times in the yeare, by all of his friends and kindred. The dayes are knowne, and though they dwell twentie miles thence, yet they will resort to these memoriall-Exequies, and beginning in the night, will sing dolefull and funerall songs till day, and then kill, as aforesaid, and make merry. The hope of this, maketh such as haue store of friends to contemne death; and the want of friends to bewaile him, makes a man conceiue a more dreadfull apprehension of Death. Their conceit is so rauished
with superstition, that many die of none other death. Kin is the name of vnlaw∣full and prohibited meate, which, according to each kindreds deuotion, to some Familie is some kinde of Fish; to another, a Henne; to another, a Buffe; and so of the rest: in which, they obserue their vowed abstinence so strictly, that if any should (though at vnawares) eate of his Kin, he would die of conceit, alway pre∣senting to his accusing conscience the breach of his vow, and the anger of Mo∣kisso. He hath knowne diuerse thus to haue died, and sometimes would, when some of them had eaten with him, make them beleeue, that they had eaten of their Kin, till hauing sported himselfe with their superstitious agonie, hee would affirme the contrarie. They vse to set in their Fields, and places where Corne or Fruits grow, a Basket with Goates-hornes, Parrats feathers, and other trash: This is the Mokisso's Ensigne, or token that it is commended to his custodie; and therefore the people, very much addicted to theft, dare not meddle, or take any thing. Likewise, if a man, wearied with his burthen, lay it downe in the high way, and knit a knot of Grasse, and lay thereon; or leaue any other note (knowne to them) to testifie, that hee hath left it there in the name of his Idoll, it is secured from the lime-singers of any passenger. Conceit would kill the man that should transgresse in this kinde. In the Banza, or chiefe Citie, the chiefe Idoll is named Chekoke. Euery day they haue there a Market, and the Chekoke is brought forth by the Ganga, or Priest, to keepe good rule, and is set in the Market place, to preuent stealing. Moreouer, the King hath a Bell Recouerie of stollen goods. the strokes whereof found such terrour into the heart of the fearefull theefe, that none dare keepe any stollen goods after the sound of that Bell. Our Author inhabited in a little Reede house, after the Lcango manner, and had hanging by the walls, in a Cloth case, his Peece, wherewith he vsed to shoote Fowles for the King, which, more for loue of the Cloth, then for the Peece, was stollen. Vpon complaint, this Bell (in forme like a Cow-bell) was carried about and rung, with proclamation to make restitution; and hee had his Peece the next morning set at his dore. The like another found, in a bagge of Beades of a hundred pound weight, stollen from him, and recouered by the sound of this Bell. They haue a dreadfull and deadly kinde of tryall in controuersies, after this man∣ner. Triall of sus∣pected persons There is a little Tree, or Shrubbe, with a small Root (it is called Imbunda a∣bout the bignesse of ones thumbe, halfe a foot long, like a white Carrot. Now when any listeth to accuse a Man, or Familie, or whole Street, of the death of any of his friends, saying, That such a man bewitched him, the Ganga assembleth the accused parties, and scrapes that Root, the scrapings whereof he mixeth with water, which makes it as bitter as gall (he tasted of it:) one Root will serue for the tryall of hun∣dred men. The Ganga brewes the same together in Gourds, and with Plantaine stalkes hitteth euery one, after they haue drunke, with certaine wordes. Those that haue receiued the drinke, walke by, till they can make Vrine, and then they are there∣by freed. Others abide till either Vrine frees them, or dizzinesse takes them: which the people no sooner perceiue, but they cry, Vndoke, Vndoke, that is, naughtie Witch: and he is no sooner fallen by his dizzinesse, but they knocke him on the head, and dragging him away, hurle him ouer the Cliffe. In euery Libertie they haue such Tryalls, which they make in cases of Theft, and Death of any person. Euerie weeke it falls out that some or other vndergoes this Tryall, which cosumeth multi∣tudes of people. There be certaine persons called Dunda, which are borne of Negro-Parents, and yet are, by some vnknowne cause, white. They are very rare, and when such happen to be borne, they are brought to the King, & become great Witches: They are his Coun∣cellors, and aduise him of luckie and vnluckie dayes for execution of his enterprises. When the King goes any whither, the Dundas goe with him, and beat the ground round about with certaine Exorcismes, before the King sits downe, and then sit
downe by him. They will take any thing in the Market, none daring to contra∣dict them. Kenga is the landing place of Loanga. They haue there an Idoll called Gum∣biri and a holy House, called Munsa Gumbiri, kept and inhabited by an old wo∣man; where once a yeare is a solemne Feast, which they celebrate with Drummes, Daunces, and Palme-wines: and then they say he speaketh vnder the ground. The people call him Mokissa Cola, or a strong Mokisso, and say, That hee comes to stay with Chekoke, the Idoll of the Banza. That Chekoke is a Negro-Image, made sitting on a stoole: a little house is there made him: they annoint him with Toc∣cola, which is a redde colour made of a certaine Wood This seemeth to be Red San∣ders. A. Bat. sayth it is Log∣ood. ground on a stone, and mixed with water, wherewith they daily paint themselues, from the waste vpwards, esteeming it great beautie: otherwise they account not themselues readie. It is for like purpose carried from hence to Angola. Sometimes it falls out, that some man or boy is taken with some sudden Enthu∣siasme, or rauishment, becomming madde, and making a whooping and great cla∣mours. They call them Mokisso-Moquat, that is, taken of the Mokisso. They cloth them very handsome, and whatsoeuer they bid in that fit (for it lasteth not very long) they execute as the Mokissos charge. Morumba is thirtie Leagues Northwards from hence, in the Mani-Loango's Dominion; where he liued nine moneths. There is a House, and in it a great Bas∣ket, proportioned like to a Hiue, wherei is an Image called Morumba, whose Reli∣gion extendeth farre. They are sworne to this Religion at tenne or twelue yeares old: but for probation are first put in a House, where they haue hard diet, and must be mute for nine or tenne dayes, any prouocation to speake notwithstanding. Then doe they bring him before Morumba, and prescribe him his Kin, or perpetuall absti∣nence from some certaine meat. They make a cut in his shoulder like to an halfe Moone, and sprinkle the bloud at Morumbas feete, and sweare him to that Religi∣on. In the wound they put a certaine white powder, in token of his late ad∣mission; which, so long as it continueth, doth priuiledge him to take his meat and drinke with whomsoeuer hee pleaseth, none denying him the same, at free cost. They also haue their fatall Tryalls before this Image, where the ac∣cused partie kneeling downe, and clasping the Hiue, sayth, Mene quesa ca bamba Morumba, signifying, That hee comes thither to make tryall of his in∣nocence; and if he be guiltie, hee falls downe dead; being free, hee is freed. Andrew Battell sayth he knew sixe or seuen, in his beeing there, that made this tryall. Beyond the Countrey of Loango are the Anzignes Od.Lopez.l.1.5, , the cruellest Canni∣balls which the Sunne looketh on. For in other places they eate their enemies, or their dead; but here they take and eate their Kinsfolkes and Countrey-folkes. They keepe Shambles of Mans flesh, as with vs of Beefe and Muttons. They cate their enemies: Their slaues (if cut out, they will yeeld them more in the seuerall Ioynts, or Peeces, then to be sold aliue) they kill, though it be but to saue a halfe-penny. Some of them for wearinesse of life, and some (oh crueltie of vaine-glory) euen for valour of courage, in contempt of Death, and estee∣ming it an honourable proofe of their fidelitie and manhood, will offer them∣selues to the Butcherie, as faithfull subiects vnto their Princes, of them to bee consumed and eaten, that with their death, and after their death, they may doe them seruice. These Anzichi stretch from Zaire to Nubia. They haue many Mines of Cop∣per, and great quantitie of Sanders, redde and gray; wherewith (mixed with the Oyle of Palme-tree) they annoint themselues. The Portugalls temper it with Vi∣neger, for the healing of the French Pokes: by the smoake thereof they driue away the head-ache. It is incredible, or at least would so seeme to vs, which Lopez reporteth, That they carrying their arrowes (which are short and slender,
of a very hard wood) in the Bowe hand, will shoot off eight and twentie (so many they hold at once) before the first of them fall to ground; and with a short Hatchet, with a sudden whirling themselues about, breake the force of the enemies arrowes, and then hanging this Hatchet on their shoulder, discharge their owne arrowes. They are of great simplicitie, loyaltie, and fidelitie, and the Portugalls more trust them then any other slaues. They are yet sauage and beastly, and there is no conuer∣sing with them: but they bring slaues of their owne Nation, and out of Nubio Con∣go to sell; for which they recarrie Salt, and Shells, which they vse for Mon, Silkes, Linnen, Glasses, and such like. They All the Hea¦then Nations in these parts of Africa are circumcised. circumcise themselues, and besides that, both men and women, both of the Nobilitie and Comminaltie, from their childhood marke their faces with sundry sla∣shes made with a knife. I asked (sayth Cap.10. Lopez) of their Religion, and it was told me that they were Gentiles; which was all I could learne of them. They worship the Sunne for the greatest God, as though it were a man; and the Moone next, as though it were a woman. Otherwise euery man chuseth to himselfe his owne Idoll, and wor∣ships it after his owne pleasure. The Anzichi G.Bot.Ben. part.1.l.3. haue one King principall, which hath many Princes vnder him. Of Ambus and Medera, Northerne Regions, little besides the names is knowne. Biafar is inhabited with people much addicted to Enchauntments, Witchcrafts, and all abhominable Sorceries. Of the Giacchi wee haue made often mention, and of their incursions into Congo. These, in their owne Language, are called Agag, as Lopez Lopez.l.1.13. & l.2.c.9. testifieth, and liue on both sides of Nilus, in the borders of the Empire of Mohenhe-Muge. They vse to marke themselues about the lippe, vpon their cheekes, with certaine lines which they make with yron Instruments, and with fire. More∣ouer, they haue a custome to turne their eye-lids backwards, so that their blacke skinnes, white eyes, and cauterized markes seeme to conspire a dreadfull and gastly deformitie in their faces. They hold warre with the These Ama∣zones are (as we haue obser∣ued) doubted of in other pla∣ces: and Andr.Battell, which trauelled neere to those parts, denieth this report of Lopez as vntrue. Amazones; and of late yeares haue inuaded the neighbour Nations. Their weapons are Darts, their food humane flesh, without all humanitie deuoured. Andrew Battell Andr. Battell liued (by occa∣sion of the Portugalls tre∣chery) with the lagges a lon∣ger time then euer any Chri∣stian, or white man had done: and serued thē with his Mus∣ket in their warres: neither could Lopez (saith he) haue true intelli∣gence whence they came. For the Christians at that time had but vncer∣tain cōiectures of them: nei∣ther after had the Portugalls any cōuersing, but by way of commerce: but he being be∣trayed, fled to thē for his life, and after, by stealth escaped from them: the only European that euer liued in their campe. liued amongst them sixteene moneths. He sayth, they are cal∣led Iagges by the Portugall, by themselues Imbangolas, and came from Sierra Lio∣na. This either is not the former Nation, but so called of like condition in man∣ners, and inuasion of Countries, or else these reports agree not. Howsoeuer, he af∣firmeth, That they are exceeding deuourers of mans flesh, for which, they refuse Beefe and Goates, whereof they take plentie. They haue no setled habitation, but wander in an vnsetled course. They rise in Haruest, and inuading some Countrey, there stay as long as they find the Palmes, or other sufficient meanes of maintenance, and then seeke new aduentures. For they neither Plant nor Sowe, nor breed vp Cat∣tell: and which is more strange, they nourish vp none of their owne children, al∣though they haue ten or twentie wiues a man, of the properest and comeliest slaues they can take. But when they are in trauaile, they digge a hole in the Earth, which presently receiueth, in that darke prison of death, the new-borne creature, not yet made happie with the light of life. Their reason is, that they will not bee troubled with education, nor in their flitting wanderings be troubled with such cumbersome burthens. Once, a secret prouidence both punisheth the fathers wickednesse, and preuenteth a Viperous generation: if that may be a preuention, where there is a suc∣cession without generation: and as Plinie Plin l.5.c.17. sayth of the Esseni; Gens aelerna est in qua nemo nascitur. For of the conquered Nations they preserue the boyes from ten to twentie yeares of age, and bring them vp, as the hope of their succession, like Negro-Azimogli Azimogli are the children of Christians ta frō the parents by the Turke, the spawne of their lanizaries , with education fitting their designes. These weare a Collar about their necke, in token of slauerie, vntill they bring an enemies head slaine in battaile; and then are they vncollared, freed, and dignified with the title of Souldi∣ors. If one of them runnes away, he is killed and eaten. So that hemmed in betwixt hope and feare, they grow very resolute and aduenturous, their Collars breeding shame, disdaine, & desperate furie, till they redeeme their freedome, as you haue heard.
Elembe the great Iagge brought with him twelue thousand of these cruell monsters from Sierra Liona, and after much mischiefe and spoyle setled himselfe in Benguele, twelue degrees from the Line Southwards, and there breedeth and groweth into a Nation. But Kelandula, sometime his page, proceeds in that beastly life before men∣tioned, and the people of Elembe by great troupes runne to him, and follow his Campe, in hope of spoyle. They haue no Fetisso's, or Idols. The Great Iagge, or Prince, is master of all their Ceremonies, and is a great Witch. I haue seene this Ke∣landula (sayth our Author) continue a Sacrifice from Sunne to Sunne; the Rites where of were these: Himselfe sat on a stoole in great Pompe, with a Cappe adorned with Peacockes feathers (which Fowles, in one Countrey called Shelambanza, are found wilde) and in one place empaled, about the graue of the King, are fiftie kept, and fedde by an olde woman, and are called Ingilla Mokisso, that is, Birds of Mokisso. Now about him thus set, attended fortie or fiftie women, each of them wearing con∣tinually a Zebras tayle in their hands: There were also certaine Gangas, Priests, or Witches. Behind them were many with Drummes and Pipes, and Pungas (certaine Instruments made of Elephants teeth, made hollow a yard and halfe, and with a hole like a Flute, which yeeld a loud and harsh sound, that may be heard a myle off.) These strike, and sound, and sing, and the women weaue (as is said) till the Sunne be al∣most downe. Then they bring forth a Pot, which is set on the fire, with Leaues, and Rootes, and Water therein: and with a kinde of white powder, the Witches, or Gan∣gas, spot themselues, one on the one cheeke, the other on the other; and likewise their foreheads, temples, breasts, shoulders, and bellies, vsing many inchaunting tearmes, which are holden to be prayers for victorie. At Sunne-set a Ganga brings his Kissen∣gula, or Warre-Hatchet, to the Prince (this weapon they vse to weare at their girdles) and putting the same in his hand, biddes him be strong, their God goes with him, and he shall haue victorie. After this they bring him foure or fiue Negros, of which, with a terrible countenance, the Great Iagge with his Hatchet kills two, and other two are killed without the Fort. Likewise, fiue Kine are slaine within, and other fiue without the Fort; and as many Goates, and as many Dogges, after the same manner. This is their Sacrifice, at the end whereof all the flesh is in a Feast consumed. Andrew Battell was commaunded to depart when the slaughter began, for their Deuill, or Mo∣kisso (as they said) would then appeare and speake to them. This Sacrifice is called Kissembula; which they solemnize when they attempt any great enterprise. There were few left of the naturall Iagges, but of this vnnaturall broode the present succes∣sion was raysed. Now that we haue thus discoursed of these former Nations, let vs take view of the more in-land and Easterly borders, which abutte on Congo: where we shall find the great Lake Aquilunda, which with her many Riuers aforesaid watereth all that great Countrey, assisted therein by a farre greater Lake, called Zembre, great Mother and chiefe Ladie of the Waters in Africa. As for the Mountaines of the Moone, now cal∣led Toroa, there is a Lake called Gale, of no great quantitie, whence issueth a Riuer, named Camissa, and by the Portugalls, the sweet Riuer, disemboquing at the False Cape, an Arme whereof had before entred the Sea (in 32.40.) of Infante Io.di Barros Dec.1.l.3.c.4. Od. Lopez.l.2.c.8 & Pigafctta. , one of Dias his companions, in the first Discouerie of those parts, called Infante because he there went first on Land. But from those Hills of the Moone, the Lake whence Nilus sprin∣geth hath no helpe. Neither are there two Lakes, East and West, distant from each o∣ther about foure hundred and fiftie myles, as Ptolomey describeth; for then the one should be in the confines of Congo and Angola, the other about Sofala and Mono∣motapa: where is found but one Lake (for Aquilunde is no tributarie to Nilus.) This Lake is betweene Angola and Monomotapa, and containeth in Diameter 195. myles. There is indeede another Lake which Nilus maketh in his course, but standeth North∣ward from the first Lake Zembre, and not in East or West parallel. Neither doth Nilus (as some affirme) hide it selfe vnder the ground, and after rise againe, but it runneth through monstrous and desart Valleyes, without any setled Channell, and where no people inhabiteth, from whence that fabulous opinion did grow.
This Lake is situate in twelue degrees of Southerly latitude, and is compassed about like a vault with exceeding high Mountaines, the greatest whereof are called Cafates, vpon the East; and the Hills of Sal-Nitrum, and the Hills of Siluer on another side, and on the other side with diuerse other Mountaines. The Riuer Nilus runneth North∣wards foure hundred myles, and then entreth into another great Lake, which the in∣habitants doe call a Sea. It is much bigger then the first, and containeth in bredth two hundred and twentie myles, tight vnder the Equinoctiall Line. Of this second Lake, the Anzichi giue certaine and perfect intelligence: for they traffique into those parts. And they report, That in this second Lake there is a people that sayleth in great ships, and can write, and vseth number, weight, and measure, which they haue not in the parts of Congo; that they build their houses with Lime and Stone, and for their fashi∣ons and qualities may be compared with the Portugalls. This seemeth to be in Go∣iame, where the Abassine entituleth himselfe King, and in his title (as before Cap.3. you haue read) calls it the Fountaine of Nilus: which Alvares F. Alvares, c.135. also mentioneth, that Peter Covilian saw. He affirmeth, That there are Iewes about those parts, which perhaps are the people that the Anzichi speake of. From this second Lake in Goiame, the Riuer which is there called Gihon, passeth through the Pretes Dominion to Meroe, and so to Aegypt, as elsewhere is shewed. In these two great Lakes are diuerse Islands, that we speake not of the Tritons, and other I know not what monsters, there reported to be found. The Lake Zembre yeeldeth not Nilus alone, but Zaire, a farre more spacious Riuer in widenesse, and more violent in force then Nilus, or any other Riuer in Afri∣ca, Europe, or Asia, of which we lately related. And besides her Northerne and We∣sterne tributes, carried by those two Riuers to the Mediterranean and Ocean Seas, she sendeth her great streames of Magnice, Coava, and Cuama, into the inner or Ea∣sterne Ocean. Magnice Od.Lopez. l.2.c.9. springing out of Zembre, receiueth in his voyage to the Sea three other Riuers; Nagoa, called S. Christophers; and Margues, which both spring out of the Mountaines of the Moone, by the people there called Toroa: the third is Arroe, which besides his waters, payeth to Neptune, which neither needes, nor heedes it, a great quantitie of Gold, which it washeth from the Mountaines of Monomotapa (a Coun∣trey extending it selfe betweene Magnice and Cuama) whose seuen mouthes seeke to swallow vp many Islands which they hold in their iawes, but through greedinesse loose that which greedinesse makes them seeke, not able to swallow so great morsels, which therefore remaine and are inhabited with Pagans. Boterus G.Bot. B part.1.l.3. sayth, That this Ri∣uer runnes out of that Lake, a great space in one channell, and then is diuided into two; the one called Spirito santo, running into the Sea, vnder the Cape Couenti; the other Cuama, receiueth the Riuers Panami, Luangua, Arruia, Mangiono, Inadire, Rui∣na, and is sayled more then seuen hundred myles. Coava is also a great Riuer. The inhabitants within Land, about these Riuers, are (as you haue heard) Pagans and rude people. Let me now haue leaue to conuey my selfe downe this Riuer Coava into the Ocean, and there take view of the many Islands with which Nature hath adorned this African world, as with many Brooches and Iew∣els set and hanged about the fringes of her garments: and first learning what we can by heare-say of the Islands in and from the Redde Sea hither, we will in some Portu∣gall Carricke sayle round about the African Coast, and acquaint you with what wee shall finde worthiest obseruation: and then not willing as yet to set foot in Lisbone, as we meet with the fleet of Spaine sayling to the New-found World, will passe with them for further Discoueries. For, to goe into the Mediterranean, to discouer the A∣frican Islands there, will scarce be worth the while. To heare a little of those few may content vs.
CHAP. XI. Of the Seas and Islands about Africa: The auncient and moderne Obseruations, Nauigations, and Discoueries. AFter this long and tedious iourney ouer Land, where the steepe and Snowie Mountains, the myrie and vnholsome Valleyes, the vnpasiable Wildernesses, swift Riuers, still Lakes thicke Woods, and varietie of the Continent-obseruations, haue thus long whiled vs; let vs now, by a swifter course, take view of the African Seas, and those Islands which they hold alway besieged, but neuer conquer. In the first place presents it selfe to our Discouerie that Sea, which separateth (after the moderne reckoning) A∣frica and Asia asunder. This is called the Redde Sea; which name (sayeth Plin.l.6.c.23. Plinie) the Grecians call Erythraeum (this word signifieth Redde) and is ascribed by some to a King named Erythras; by others, to the repercussion of the Sunne-beames; by others, to the colour of the Sand and Earth (in the bottome;) and by others to the nature of the water it selfe. Solinus Solin.c.42. affirmeth, it is called Erythraeum, of King Erythrus, the sonne of Perseus and Andromade, and not onely of the colour, alledging M. Varro. Varro, that learned Roman, for his author: who also mentioneth a Fountaine on the shore there∣of, which changeth the colour of the Sheepes fleeces which drinke there, into a dus∣kish and darker colour. Strabo Strab. l.16. citeth the testimonie of Nearchus and Orthagoras, concerning the Isle Tyrina, two thousand furlongs from Carmania, in which the Se∣pulchre of Erythras is shewed, being a great Hill, planted with Trees: and that he reig∣ned in those parts, and left his name thereunto: which they learned of Mithropastes, who flying from Darius, had liued in that Island. Barrius To.d: Borros, Dec. 2.l.8.c.1. Al, Alboquerke. writeth, that Alfonso Dalboquerque (that victorious Portugall, who subdued so many Islands, Seas, and Kingdomes to that Crowne) in a Letter to King Emanuel affirmeth, That it may be called the Redde Sea, of certaine redde spots, or staynes, which are seene therein: and when he entred into the Straits, he encountred a great veine of redde water, exten∣ding it selfe from Aden as farre as they could see from the Shippes toppes. These redde veines of water the Moores ascribed to the ebbing and flowing of that Sea. Iohn di Castro Ioh. di Castro. (afterwards Viceroy of India) sayled to the bottome of the Strait, as farre as Suez, and much laboured to finde the cause, why it should be called the The Scrip∣ture often mentioneth this Sea: but calls it, as Tre∣mel. and Iun. translate, mare algosum, or, af∣ter Vatablus, Carectosum; of the weedes plentifully growing there∣in. Exod. 10.18.&c. Redde Sea. He, in his Mappe of these parts, sayth, That he saw therein many such redde spaces of water, but taking vp the water in a Vessell, out of the Sea, it seemed clearer and more christalline then that without the Straits: Hee caused also some to diue, which did bring him out of the sandie bottome a redde matter, braunched like Corall, and some like Oranges. In other places where were greene spots in the Sea, were taken out greene braunches: and where the Sea was white, the sand there-vnder was very white: and though the depth in some places amounted to twentie fathome, yet the puritie of the christalline waters caused this transparent colour. Neere to Sua∣chen he found most of those spots, and from thence to Alcocer, the space of foure hun∣dred myles. But neerer the bottome, towards Suez in a great space he saw none. Fur∣ther, without the Strait, he saw such redde Luys de Vrreta saith, That the sands on the shore, and that the Mountains are red, which the Sunne shines on, and by reflection of the beames causeth that rednesse. Hist. Ethop. l.1.c.11. spots or veines of water at Cape Fartach, as if Oxen had beene slaine there, yet the water taken vp in a vessell seemed cleare; and he supposed that this rednesse proceeded of the Whales bringing forth their young. Barrius misliketh that coniecture, and those other of antiquitie, in searching the cause of this name of Redde, and is of opinion, That the violent currents of the Tides, assisted with some tempestuous windes, raise vp from the bottome that redde floore, whereof we haue spoken, and cause, by the motion of the same vnder the water, that rednesse in the vpper face thereof: which is in more spacious quantitie neere the Straits, where there is greatest force of the Tides; and the threeds or straines of this rednesse are lesse in the greater and more spacious Sea-roome. The Portugall Pilots first thought, that
the winds brought out red dust from the drie soile of Arabia, which no mans experi∣ence hath confirmed. Andrea A. Corsali let. 2. Corsali, which sayled and warred vnder the Portugals in these Seas, An. 1516. saith, he knowes not why it should be called red, for the water is coloured as in other Seas: which seemeth to crosse the former reports: and may ei∣ther bee construed of the water generally not discoloured, or perhaps while hee was there, the tides and winds did not conspire so boisterously, as at some other times they doe, against the yeelding and weaker soile in the bottome thereof. How euer it be for, this rednesse, many deceiue themselues in streitning this name to the Arabian Gulfe, which the Ancients Liv.l.45.Plm.l.6.c.24. gaue vnto all the Seas from Egypt to India: and reckon the Per∣sian and Arabian Gulfs, armes of the red Sea. Yea Arrianus, (not he that writ Arrian.de reb. Alexan.1.8. Alex∣anders life, who yet in the report of Nearchus his voyage from Indus, to the Riuer Ti∣gris, calls it the Red Sea: but an other of that name) in his Arriani Pe∣riplus Ortesius. Tepidum Ru∣benti Tigrim immiscet freto. Senec.

Hauing now troubled you with the name, why, and how farre, the name extendeth: we may view the Isands therein situate: which if any would more fully know, let him reade Arrianus and Barrius, and the voyage of Soly∣man Bassa, 1538. vnto Din, written by Dam.a Goes. op.Diensix vtaggio di vn. Venet. Camito alla acta di Diu.Ramus.part.1. Damianus in Latin, and by a Venetian in Ra∣musius, who was present in the action: I must but touch the principall. Sues is the be∣ginning of this Sea, which some suppose to bee that which the Ancients call Arsinoe, after others Heroum, is the place where the Turke hath his Arsenall, and Gallies, for those Seas, the matter whereof is brought out of Caramania, by Sea, by Nilus, and by Camels ouer Land the rest of the way, at incredible charges. Here in old times was a channell which conueied the waters of Nilus to this place, where they had Cisternes to receiue it; all destroied by the Mahumetans: and now the Inhabitants fetch the wa∣ter, which they vse, six miles off. Some thinke that Pharaoh was here drowned: which passage other set downe at Tor where the Sea is straitned, and is not aboue nine miles ouer. It seemeth that the prints of the Chariot wheeles, which Orosius Oros l.1.c.10 affirmeth, still remained as testimonies of Pharaohs ouer-whelming vnder those waues, and could not by any industrie of man be done out, but by the mightie hand of God were soone re∣stored in the same forme, are not now there to be found: for they would soone end the controuersie. Asion-Gaber 1.Reg.9.26. was a Port hereabouts, whence Salomon sent his Naule to Ophir and after him Iehoshaphat 1. Reg:22.48. , but not with like successe: which (Iosephus Ios.antiq.l 8. saith) was Berenice, not farre from Elana. Hierom calls it Essia. Berenice adrich p.118. was the Port of the Red Sea, where the Indian drugs and spices in the time of the Roman Empire was vn∣laden and landed, to be carried thence to Alexandria, the whole course whereof Plini describeth Lib.6.cap.23 .

Out∣wards bound, they keepe the middle, and haue Pilots for that purpose, homewards they haue other Pilots, which direct the ship within the shallowes: and are taken in at Babelmandel, called Ptol.l.4.c.I. by Ptolomie, Insuia Diodori an Ile in the entrie or strait of the Gulfe, which Strabo saith, the ancient Kings of Egypt chained to keepe the passage. Zi∣dem is 12. leagues from Meca, where the ships haue vsed to vnlade their spiceries, as before at Berenice: without this Towne is a Moschee, which the Moores say is the Se∣pulchre of Eua. Their water is raine water, reserued in Cisternes. Passing by the Ile Mehun, the Ile Camaran is famous by the diuers spoiles there made by the Portugals: it is in 15. deg. This Iland (saith Corsali) is the hotest place that euer I saw: not one of vs, but had our secret parts chased and flaied with heat: and many of our companie died. Dalaccia is an Iland where they gather pearles. Suachen is the best harbour in all the gulfe, which the Turks haue taken from the Abissine: it stands in 19. deg. & a third. Mazzua is an Iland which makes Ercocco a good hauen. But of the hauen & Ports on both sides the Gulfe, Barrius Bar.Dc.2.l. relateth more largely. Of the Iles Achafas and Tuicce
we haue but names: likewise of others; whereof Ptolomie Ptol.l.4.c.8 doth number a great mul∣titude. The people of these parts are Mahumetans, and many Baduins, Hereticall and theeuish Moores. Many Iewes are in Adom, the chiefe Towne of merchandise in these parts: the King whereof (after much kinde gratulation) Soliman Bassa hung vp at the yards arme: and at his returne dealt the like dole to the King of Zibit, subiecting their States vnder treacherous pretences to his great Master. Scaliger Ios.Scalig. Can.Is. tells of Samaritans dwelling in an Iland of the Red Sea, which, when any man landed there, would religi∣ously forbid to touch them: as we haue before mentioned. The Ascension R.Couerte. ascended into the Red Sea, An. 1608. to Moha, which is a Citie of great trade. In the Ocean with out the strait, neare to the African shore, are not many Ilands mentioned by the Anci∣ents. Arrianus in his Periplus speakes of seuen Ilands, called Pyralaon: and of an other great Iland neare to them, called Menuthesias or Menuthias, now called Madagascar, and S.Laurence: some take it for the Iland of Iambolus, whereof Diodorus Dio.Sic.l.3.cap.13. hath large∣ly related, and Ramusius Ramus.part.1 hath discoursed thereon: other seeke for that Iland in Soma∣tra. That Iambolus was a Merchant, which trading in Arabia for spices, was taken by theeues, and made a shepheard: after carried away by Aethiopians, who tooke these forrainers according to their rites, to expiate their Countrie. For they were enioyned by Oracle to make such expiation once in 600. yeares, with two men that were for∣rainers. For the fulfilling whereof they were put in a boat, fit for two men, with six moneths victuaile: and commanded to sayle Southwards, and they should come to a happy Iland, where the men liued a blessed life. And if they came safe thither, their Countrie should enioy prosperitie 600. yeares: if they turned back, they should bring vpon them much trouble. The Aethiopians meane while kept holy daies, and offered Sacrifices for their good voiage, which in foure moneths they atchieued: and were ex∣ceeding courteously vsed and entertained of the Ilanders. These were foure cubites higher then other men, very nimble and strong. The reports of this his voyage sa∣uour more of an Sir Thom.

Yet is it thought (as Ramusius discourseth) not altogether fabulous, but that he was indeed in some remote Iland, to which he applied such fancies, as Diodorus reporteth. To leaue there the certaine fictions, & vncertaine coniectures of Antiquitie: and come to more certaine relations; the only Iland of name without the streit is, Socotera, in 13. deg. Corsali A.Corsali. let. 2. was at Soquotera. An. 1516. thinks it vnknowne to Ptolomie, (which others suppose to be his Insula Dios∣coridis) he saith, that it was inhabited of Christian shepheards, which liued on milke, and butter: their bread was of dates: like to the people of Prester Iohn, but their haire was longer, clothed with one only peece of cloth about their priuities; The Land bar∣ren, as in all Arabia Foelix, and the Sea-coasts gouerned by the Arabians. Hence com∣meth and is named the Aloe Socotrina Maginus. . They are Iacobits, and haue Churches with Altars, & obserue the Crosse with great reuerence: they enter not their Churches, but stand in the Church-yard, or Porch. Their Abuna, or Priest, ruleth them. Other Go∣uernour they haue none of their owne. The Portugalls haue two Townes there, Coro and Benin. They Porie.before  co, cap de In∣sulu. hold opinion that S. Thomas here suffered ship wrack: and that of his ship was built an ancient Church, which is yet to be seene, walled about with three partitions, and three dores. They liue for the most part in cabbins of boughs, or in Caues: their women are as good Souldiers as the men. They are much addicted to Magick, and bring to passe matters incredible, although the Bishop excommunicate such as vse it. They will with cōtrarie wind hinder men that in damage them, from fai∣ling away. Conceited they are exceedingly of their owne excellence. Two small Iles lie to the North of Socotera, called the two Sisters; the Inhabitants of an Oliue colour, without law among themselues or commerce with others. There M. Pola l.3. Cap. 33.34. are also those two Iles, the one, of men; the other, of women; which we mentioned in our fift booke, Cap.3.pag 438. A matter, how true I know not, but very strange. They are Christians, subiect to the Bishop of Socotera, and he to the Zatoia in Badach. Many other Ilands there bee of no great name in that Sea, called Sinus Barba∣ricus: as of Don Garcia: the three and the seuen brethren, of S. Brandon, S. Fran∣cis, Mascarentia, De Natal, Cmr, and many other: besides those of Quisoa.
Mosambique, and some other for their vicinitie to the Land before handled. The Ile Alaginus. of St. Laurence (so called by the Portugalls; by themselues, Madagascar) is mee∣test in all those parts, to entertaine the Readers obseruation, as being one of the grea∣test Ilands of the World. It contayneth in breadth foure hundred and fourescore miles, in length a thousand and two hundred, in compasse foure thousand miles. M. Polo M. Polo.l.3. cap.35. saith, the Inhabitants were Saracens, and were gouerned vnder foure Lords, eate Camells flesh, vse merchandise or arts. Thus farre did the great Can stretch his Tartarian Dominion: and sent hither to spie the Land. That which Polo saith, he heard of a Bird in this Iland, called Rush, so bigge as it could take vp an Elephant, hath no likelihood of truth. He calls it Magascar. It is situate from seuenteene to six and twentie ½. of Southerly Latitude Maffaeus.hist.ind.l.3. . Only vpon the coast they are Mahumetans: with in Land Idolaters, black, and like the Cafres: the soile yeeldeth Cloues, Ginger, and Siluer. It deserueth to haue better Inhabitants, if Linschoten Linschot.l.1.c.3.& l.2. Paludanus. iudge rightly, hauing many faire and fresh Riuers, safe harbours, plenty of fruits and cattell; therein are foure gouernements, each fighting against other. They vse not themselues to trade with others, nor suffer others to traffique with them. The Portugalls haue some trade with them, but goe not on Land. In the first discouery of them Osor.l.4. by the Portugalls, 1506. they shewed themselues in hospitall and treacherous, rewarding receiued kindnesse, in their Canoas or Boats, made of the body of a Tree, with shot. There Ph.Pigafetta. Congo.l.2.c.9. are said to be some white people, supposed to be of Chinian off-spring. Of the people of Madagascar the Hollanders report De Bry.part.3 Ind.Or., that they are of colour black, strong, and well made: they couer their priulties with cotton: they haue large holes in their eares in which they weare round sticks. They acknowledge one Creatour, and obserue Circumcision, but know nothing of praying or keeping festiualls. They haue no proper names, whereby to distinguish one day from another: neither doe they number Weekes, Moneths, or Yeares. Nor doe they number aboue ten. They are exceedingly afraid of the Deuill, (whom they call Tainuaddei) because he vseth often to afflict them. They liue most-what on fishing. They marrie but one wife: their time of marriage is, for the men, at twelue; the women, at ten yeares of age. Adulterie and Theft are punished with death. The men vse to hunt abroade, the women spinne their Cottons at home, whereof they haue Trees yeelding plentie. If any man kill a∣ny of his Kine, all his Neighbours may challenge part. In St. Marie, an Iland by Mada∣gascar, they met with the King, which was obserued of his Subiects with great reue∣rence. Here they buried one of their dead men, the Ilanders being present, who signi∣fied by signes that his soule was gone to heauen: & would haue had them to cut off his legges by the knees. The Ile of Cerne, they called Manrich Iland. They found excel∣lent Eben Trees there, the wood where of is as black as pitch, and as smooth as Iuorie, inclosed with a thick barke. They found of the same kinde some red, some yellow. There were Palme-Trees like the Cocos. They found store of Birds, whereof they might take some in their nests with their hands. There were no people inha∣biting. In the channell between the firme Land, & Madagascar, are many Ilands G.B.B.del Isole. great & small, all inhabited by Mahumentans: the chiefe of which is St. Christopher, more Northwards against Mombaza, and Melinde, are three Ilands, Momfid. Zanzibar, & Pemba: inhabited with Mahumetans of white colour. In the time of M. M. Polo l.3.c.36. Polo, Zenzibar was Hea∣thenish: the Inhabitants, he saith, very grosse and deformed; and likewise the women. Neare the Cape of Good hope are the Iles of Don Aluares and Tristan d'Acunnha: but, of no great note. The deepnesse of these Seas, make them vncapable of many Ilands. CHAP. 12. Of the Ilands of Africa, from the Cape hitherwards. ON this side the the Cape Linschot.l.1.94.Hist. of Chi∣na.part.3.c.vlt. is the Iland of St. Helena, in 16. degrees and 1/4. of Southerly Latitude. It is very high and hilly: the name was giuen of the Saint, on whose day it was discouered. It hath in it store of Goates, Hogs, Hens, and other creatures, which the Portugalls haue there left to multi∣ply:
for before there was none of them: there also they haue planted Figs, Oranges, Limons, and such like, whereof the Vallies are full: that it seemeth an earrhly Para∣dise, the fruit growing all the yeare long. They haue great store of fish, of which with crooked nailes they take great plentie: the Rocks yeeld salt for the furthering of their prouision. It seemes God hath planted it in conuenient place, for the long and dange∣rous. Indian Nauigations. There the Portugalls leaue their sick, which stay till other ships come the next year to take them. It was neuer inhabited: only an Heremite dwelt there, who vnder pretence of mortifying his flesh by penance, butchered the flesh of the Goats and Bucks so fast for their skinnes, that the King sent for him home, & will suffer none to dwell there. Abraham Kendall put in there about the yeare 1591. and left on shore one Segar a sicke man, whom Edm.Barker. Hak lo.2 part.2 Edmund Barker 18. moneths after found there in good plight; but their vnexpected comming, as it seemeth, so rauished his weake spirits with ioy, that it distracted him, and being otherwise of bodily constitu∣tion very well, he died eight daies after. The like I haue read of a Portugall in the same place. North-west from hence are the Iles of Ascension, not inhabited. Of Loanda, nigh to, or rather a peece of Congo, is already spoken. Ouer against the Cape of Lopo Gon∣salues, is the Ile of Nobon: and not farre from thence Nauigat  all iola di S.  part. 1.f.116. St. Thomas, 180. miles from the shore, and so much also in compasse, right vnder the line. At the first discouerie it was a wood: now inhabited by Portugalls and Negro's. These line 100. yeares: but few borne in Europe exceede 50. It is vnholsome, through exceeding heat, vnto Europae∣ans especially, which in December, Ianuarie, and Februarie The windes which at other times refresh them, then by nature impri∣soned in their homes. , can scarsly walke vp and downe for saintnesse. In the midst is a woodie Mountaine, continually ouershadowed with a thick cloude, which so moistens the Trees that grow in great abundance there∣on, that from hence droppeth water sufficient for the watering of all their fields of Su∣gar Canes. They haue 70. Ingenios or Sugar houses, each of which hath two or three hundred slaues belonging thereto; wheat, here sowne, becommeth all blade, without ripening any corne. No fruit which hath a stone in it will here prosper. The Towne which hath about 700. Families, and the Castle, was taken by the Hollanders, 1599. The Ile Del Principe Holl.Naig. , was so called, because the reuennues thereof were in times past allowed to the Prince of Portugal. It standeth in three degrees Northerly latitude: Ilian Clerchagen tooke the same 1598. The Iles of St. Mathew, Santa Cruz, St.Paul, and Conceptio yeeld small matter of historie. Next to Cape Verde stand seuen Ilands, full of Birds, emptie of Inhabitants, called Barbacen. But those that are called the Iles of C. Verde are nine, situate betweene the Greene and White Capes: Linschoten reckons ten. They were first discouered by Antonio di Nolli, a Genoway, 1440. None of them are inhabited, but the Iles of Iago, & Del Fogo: both which were taken, 1596. by Sr Antonie Sr. . Sher.  .3. pag 600. Serly: who had one night a shower of ashes from that Iland of Fogo or Fuego, or of Fire, so called, because it continually burneth, which fell so thick on their ship that you might write your name with your finger vpon the vpper deck. St. Iago was taken and burnt by Sir Francis Sr Fr. Drake. Drake, 1585. Braua and Buena Vista, haue brauer and goodlier names then nature. Maio yeelds salt in a Lake of two leagues long, the Sunne congealing and turning the waters into salt. From thence is passed into the Sea, called Sargasso inschot.lib.1 cap 95. , because it is couered with hearbs, like to the hearbe Sargasso in the Portugall Wells, like to Sarrper, yellow of colour, with emptie Berries like Goose∣berries: which beginneth at 20. degrees, & continueth till 34. farre off in the Sea: for the ships in their going to India keeping neare the shore meet not with any. The Sea seemeth as a greene field, so thick that a man cannot see the water, and hindreth the ships passage, except they haue a strong winde. The coast of Africa is 400. miles di∣stant, neither is any Iland neare: saue that these weeds seeme to make many Ilands. Thus doe men in ships behold the wonders of the Lord in the deepe, no Land being nigh, nor no ground to be found, although it is thought to come from the ground. And in∣deede all those Seas are full of wonders, as they passe along the coast toward the In∣dies. Tho. Th. Steuens. Hak lo.2. part.2 Steuens complaineth of the continuall thunders, lightnings, and vnhol∣some raines which there they met: the raine water, if it stands a litle, conuerting pre∣sently to wormes, and filling the meat, hanged vp, with wormes. An hearbe also
swamme vpon the face of the waters like a Cocks-combe, so venimous, that it can scarse be touched without perill: Fishes, called Sharks, most rauenous deuourers, which had other six or seuen smaller fishes, guarded with blew and greene, attending like Seruing-men. Fishes also (as bigge as a Hering) with wings, which doe not so much helpe them by flying to escape an other greater fish, that pursueth them by Sea, as endanger them to a Sea-Fowle, which waits that opportunitie. Neither can it flie high or farre, or longer then the wings are wet: not swimme fast, hauing exchanged finnes for wings. So haue I seene men thriue worse that haue two trades, then such as haue been skillfull & thriftie in one. Lerius La ij na. in Brasil.c.3. addeth the like wonder of certaine Birds, so tame that they would light vpon the Hatches, and suffer themselues to bee taken. These are the same Birds which pursue those flying fishes, wiser to hunt them, then to saue themselues: as bigge as Crowes in fethers, in flesh little bigger then a Sparrow, and farre lesse then the fish which they take and deuoure. To returne to our discouerie from Iago where wee left: here the Negro's Nau.all Is di S. Tome. were wont to bring slaues to fell to the Portugalls for beads, and other trifles, and cottons, with other base commodities: and them not such alone as they tooke in war, but their fathers and mothers, thinking they did them a benefit, to cause them thus to bee conuayed into better Countries: they brought them naked. The Iles of Arguin are six or seuen, inhabited by the Azanhagi, where the King of Spaine hath a Fortresse: concerning the trade wherof you may reade the letter of Melchior Mel. Peton. Hak. part.2. Petoney. Further into the Sea are the Canaries: which are com∣monly reckoned seuen; Canaria, Teneriff, Palma, Gomera, Hierro, Lansarotte, & Fuerte, Ventura: Theuet A.Theuet.c.5. ads 3; others, more; Lbos, Rca, Gratiosa: St, Clara, Alegranca, & In∣fierno. The Inhabitants were so grosse before they were discouered, that they knew not the vse of fire. They beleeued in one Creator of the world, who punished the euill, and rewarded the good: herein they all consented, in other things disagreed: their wea∣pons were stones and staues. They shaued their heads with sharpe stones like flints. Yron they had not: gold they respected not. The women nursed not their children, but commonly committed that office to their Goats. They as much delighted in dan∣cing, as the Birds Canari Birds. which beare their name, in singing. They were vnknowne from the times of the Roman Empire G.B.B. part.1 Vol.2. Bar.Dec.1.l.1. at which time they were called Fortunatae till either an English or French ship by misfortune lighted on them. An. 1405. Io Bentacor con∣quered them, & after him 1444.

Be∣ttancourt, & saith, he was sent by Iohn the second of Castile, An. 1417. who being slaine in the action, his son sold them to Perter Barba a Spaniard, & he to Don Henrie. He saith the people were Idolaters, and did eate their flesh raw for want of fire: they tilled the ground with Oxe & Goats-hornes. They had many wiues, but deliuered them to the Superiors to lie with them, before they lay with them. Don Henrie conquered the rest which Batancourt had not possessed. Their former gouernement was by 190. persons, which ruled also in matters of religion, prescribing to the people their faith, and wor∣ship. They had in higher name of authority a King, and a Duke. To flay a beast was e∣steemed the basest office in the world, & therefore committed to their prisoners: they which did this, liued separate from the people: Thus was it in the Gran Canaria. In Gomera Cadamosto. , they vsed for hospitality to let their friends lie with their wiues, and recei∣uing theirs in like courtesie: and therfore, as in India, the Sisters sonne inherited. In Tenarise they had two Kings, one dead, an other aliue: when a new King was crowned some man to honor his entrance, offered himselfe to voluntarie death: when the King was buried, the noblest men carried him on their shoulders, and putting him into the graue, said, Depart in peace O blessed soule. Theuet A.Theuet. New-found World. cap.5. affirmeth, that the Cana∣ries are so called of the Canes and Reedes that grow there: that they worshipped the Sunne, Moone, and Planets. Of these Ilands, Thomas Nichols The. Nichols. an English man, hath composed a Treatise extant, in Master Hakluyts voyages, To.2. Part.2. Hee saith they dwelt in Caues, supposed to descend of such, as the Romans in Africa had exiled, and cut their tongues out for blasphemie against their Gods.
The pike or high Hill of Tenarise, is after Theuets measure foure and fiftie miles.Tho∣mas Byam, Th. Byam. Some say it may be seene two hundred and fiftie Deser.can. Caluet. a friend of mine, told me, that he hath seene it eight and forty leagues in∣to the Sea, in cleare weather. Here before the conquest were seuen Kings, which with their people dwelt in Caues. Their buriall was, to be set vpon his feet naked in a Caue, propped against the wall: and if he were a man of authority, he had a staffe in his hand, and a vessell of Milke standing by him. I haue seene, saith Nichols, three hun∣dred of these corpses together, the flesh dried vp, the body light as Parchment. I my selfe saw two of those bodies in London. Canaria, Tenerif, and Palma, haue one Bishop, who hath twelue thousand Du∣cats reuennue: which place was not long since possessed by Melchior M. Canus. Loc. Theolog.lib.12. Canus, a great Writer in defence of the falling Babylon. They pay to the King fiftie thousand Ducats. Hierro, or the Iland of yron, is by the multitudes of Authors Beuzo.&c. affirmed to haue in it no fresh water, but what falleth from the leaues of a certaine Tree, which is alwaies greene, and couered with cloudes, and vnder-neath the same is a Cisterne to receiue the water, for the vse both of Men and Beasts, throughout that Iland: a whole wood of such Trees we mentioned in Saint Thomas Iland, which yeeld from their dropping leaues Rills of water downe all sides of the Hill, where they grow. In this Iland here is but one: and that very ancient. It is in seuen and twentie degrees. This, and Gomera, and Lancarota, are in the handes of priuate men. Madera standeth in two and thirtie degrees, it is the greatest of all the Atlantike Iles A. Galuano. . It was discouered by one Macham an English man: who arriued there by tempest, Anno 1344. together with a Woman, whom hee there buried, and on her Tombe did write his comming, and the cause thereof, with his and her names, and was occasion to the King of Spaine to discouer that and the Canaries. It was called Madera, of the wildernesses of Trees there growing; Here is a City called Fouchal. The Ile containeth in compasse a hun∣dred and fortie miles. The woods A. Cadamosto. which gaue name to the Iland were fiered, and burnt so furiously, that the people for a time were forced to goe some space into the Sea, from the violent heat, which caused such fat∣nesse to the soile, that at first it yeelded threescore fold: since, halfe so much. The ex∣cellent Wines were of Vines, first brought from Candie. They bring forth more grapes (saith he) then leaues, and clusters of two, three, and foure Palmi. spannes long. At first, the Pidgeons suffered themselues to bee taken, not knowing, and therefore not fearing a man. Fortie miles to the Ile of Madera is the Ile of Puerto, or Porto Santo, called of all Saints day, in which it was first discouered, Anno 1428. It was taken by Sir Amias Sir Am. Pre∣ston Hak. Preston, 1596. Here are such store of Conies, bred of one shee-Conie, brought hi∣ther great with yong, that the Ilanders were out of hope almost to withstand and a∣mend their damages by them sustayned. A litle Iland, neare to this, breedeth nothing else. And now we can accompany our Portugalls no further. A word of that which remayneth. Within the Streights are no great Ilands belonging to Africa. Pennon, or the Rock against Velles de Gumera, the Ile of Gerbi, and some others. Malta, is the most famous, where in old time was the Temple of Iuno. spoiled by Cic.in Vert.6. Verres, supposed to be that Melita, where Paul suffered Act.28.1. shipwrack: although there be an other Melita in the A∣driatike Sea, eare to Dalmatia: Polybius Polybius. calls it Melytusa, as Volateranus Volaterran. writeth. Ptolomie and Cicero name Melita, now called Malta, in this Ile of Malta. Some Ortel. in Thc∣saur. a∣scribe Pauls shipwrack to Melita in the Adriatike, neare to Dalmatia, whom Beza Beza. Annot. Aret. in Arta. learnedly confuteth: and proueth it to be that Malta, which now the Knights hold a∣gainst the Turke: whose valour in successe, in resisting that mightie Aduersarie Curio Bellum.Melitense. Viperanus. Knolles, pag.796 Curio, and Io. Antonius Viperanus, in their books of that Argument, Knolles in his Turkish Hi∣storie, Ri. Carre, and others, reiate at large. It was 1565. That which deceiueth those men in Malta, is the name of the Adriatike Sea, which now is giuen to the Gulfe of Venice, but then, as Beza and Aretius shew out of Strabo.lib. 3. was giuen to the Ionian Sea also, and further Southwards, Where Malta standeth: and Ortelius out of Ouid. Fast. 4. Philostrat. l.4. Ouid, and others, proueth the same.
Now a word of the ancient Nauigations about Africa. Hanno his voyage, sent Hanno.ap.R. forth by the Carthaginians, seemed fabulous, but Ramusius Sheweth euery place by him mentioned, to agree with the later discoueries of the portugalls, and thinketh (guided by a Portugall Pilot, skillfull of those Seas, which skanned this Nauigation of Hanno) that he went as farre as St. Thome. Long before this, Homer reporteth of Homer. Odys. 8. Menelaeus, compassing the Aethiopians from Aegypt, which some interpret of sai∣ling by the Cape of Good hope, as the Portugalls. Of this minde Strabo citeth Ari∣stonichus. Of Salomon and Iehoshaphat is sayd before. Herodotus affirmeth the Phae∣nicians Herod.l.4. failing in the Red Sea in Cambyses time: but, this was vsuall and yearely, as Plinie sheweth, lib. 6. cap.23. The same Plinie alleageth out of Cornelius Nepos, the Plin. l.2.c.67. sayling of Eudoxus out of the Red Sea, round about Africa to Cales. The like may be shewed in some other instances, of which reade M. Hakl. his Epistle Dedicatorie Tom: I. and Ramus. Part. I. Pag. III. and Galvanus in his Discoueries of the World. Which I mention, not to disparage or weaken the Portugalls praises, but to giue Antiquitie their due; which, I thinke, could not ordinarily compasse so long a Nauiga∣tion for want of the compasse: yet we should iniurie our Authors if we should not beleeue somewhat: although not so much as they report. That of Eudoxus is the most credible: but not without suspition in so long a voyage, of a priuate man.
RELATIONS OF THE DISCOVERIES, REGIONS, AND RELIGIONS, OF THE NEW WORLD. OF NEW FRANCE, VIRGI∣NIA, FLORIDA; NEW SPAINE, WITH OTHER REGIONS OF AMERICA MEXICANA, AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS. THE EIGHTH BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of the new world, and why it is named AMERICA: and the West Indies: with certaine generall discourses of the Heauens, Aire, Water, and Earth, in those parts. NOW are wee shipped for the New World, and for new Discoueries. But seeing this Inkie Sea, through which I vndertake a Pilots office to conduct my Readers, is more peaceable then that, which on the back-side of this American World, was called the Mare Paci∣sicum, & del Sur. Ortel. Theat. Peaceable, by Magellane the first discouerer: it yeeldeth vs the fitter opportunitie to contempla∣tion and discourse, in such Philosophicall Subiects, as Ioseph. Acosta. de procuranda Indorum salute, & bist. Indiae, I. & 2. Rotero. Relatif∣ni part.1.l.4. Gomara bist.gen.&c. the best Authors haue thought worthie the first place in their Histories of these parts. Yet, before we prie into Natures mysteries, the better to know our intended voyage, let vs enquire somewhat of the names, if any notice may thence arise, of the places thereby knowne. The New World, is the fittest name which can bee giuen to this vast and huge Tract; iustly called New, for the late discouerie by Columbus, Anno Domini 1492.: and World for the huge extension thereof; (as Master Hak.tom.3. Epist. Dedicat. Maginus. Ger. Mer. de Fa∣brica Mundi. Hakluyt hath obserued.) A new World it may bee also called, for that World of
new and vnknowne Creatures, which the olde World neuer heard of, and heere onelie are produced: the conceit whereof moued Mercator to thinke (which I dare not thinke with him) that the great Deluge in the dayes of Noab, drowned not these parts, because Mn had not here inhabited, who with a Deluge of sinne might procure that deluge of waters. America is a more common then fitting name, seeing Americus Vespucius the Flo∣rentine, from whom this name is deriued, was not the first Finder, not Author of that Discouerie: Columbus will challenge that, and more iustly, with Munst.Cosm.libr.5. whom, and vn∣der whom Americus made his first voyage, howsoeuer after that, hee coasled a great part of the Continent which Columbus had not seene, at the charges of the Caflilian and Portugall Kings Maff histor.Ind.libr.2. But so it might more rightly be termed Cabotia, or Sebastiana, of Sebastian Cabor a Venetian, which discouered more of the Continent then they both, about the same time; first employed by Hak.to.3 pa 7 king Henrie the seuenth of England, and after by the Catholike King. Columbus yet, as the first Discouerer, deserueth the name, both of the Country, for the first finding, and of Modestie, for not naming it by himselfe, seeking rather ef∣fects, then names of his exploits. But leaue wee these Italian Triumviri, the Genuois, Venetian, and Florentine, to decide this question among themselues: and why now is it called the West Indies? To this Acost.histor.Ind.Ind.Ind.ca.14. Acosta's Exposition of the word Indies, that there∣by wee meane all those rich Countries, which are farre off, and strange, is too gene∣rall an answere, and giueth not the true cause of the name. Gomara saith, that a cer∣taine Pilot, of whom Columbus receiued his first Instructions, tooke it to be India: or else Columbus himselfe, thinking by the West to finde a neerer passage vnto the East, by reason of the Earths roundnesse, sought for Cipango, or Iapan, and Cathay, when he first discouered the Ilands of the New World. And this opinion is probable, Pet.Mart. dec 1.lib.1. both be∣cause hee named Hispaniola, Ophir, whence Salomon fetched his golde: and Sebasti∣an Cabot in the first Voyage, which hee made at the charges of King Henrie the se∣uenth, intended (as himselfe Hak vbi supra. confesseth to finde no other Land but Cathay, and from thence to turne towards India: and the opinions of Aristotle Arist.de coelo & inundo. and Seneca, that India was not farre from Spaine, confirmed them therein Maginus saith it was called India, because it was discoue∣red at the same time that In∣dia was found by the Portu∣gals, or else for the likenesse of manners in the Indians. Now, that wee may descend from the Name, to the Nature of this new World: a World it is to see how Nature doth deflect and swarue from those grounds and prin∣ciples which the Naturallists, Ptol. Strabo. Plutarch, and some others mention the Ethiopians be∣yond the Tro∣pike of Cancer: and Taprobana, Agisimba &c. It seemeth that their meaning was, it was ve∣ry scarcely in∣habited, of few and small nati∣ons. Experi∣ence hath foūd no place more peopled. and Philosophers her forwardest Schollers haue set downe for Rules and Axiomes of Natures working. For, if wee regarde the ancient Poets, Philosophers, and Fathers, wee shall see them deceiued, and that not in few Opinions, which they seemed to haue learned in Natures Sanctuaries and inmost Clo∣sets. In the Heauens, they supposed a burning Zone; in the Earth, a Plage, plagued with scorching heats: Vt{que} duae dextra Coelum, totidem{que} sinistra Partes crant Zonae quintaest ardentier illis, Stc— —Totidem{que} plagae tellure premuntur Quarum quae media est non est habitabilis aestn Ntx teg it alta dus, tetide inter vtram{que} locauit: Temperiem{que} dedit. And Oirg. cui A∣vas statnit in suo Hypercritico Scalig.Geor. li. a greater then Ouid: Quin{que} toneut Coelum Zone; quaru vna crasc, Semper sole rubens &c. The sense whereof is, that those parts of the world next the Arctike or Antarctike Poles are not habitable, by reason of extreame colde; nor the middle part, by reason of vnreasonable heate: the two other parts temperate, and habitable.
The Philosophers accounted this no Poeme, or rather were more Poeticall them∣selues: For that which those accounted a torrid and scorched earth, these Cico somn. Scipinis. Macrob. in som. Srip.l.2.c.9. made to be a spacious and vnpassable Ocean, where the Starres, hote with their continuall motions, and the Sunnes thirstie steedes, wearied with their dayly iourney, might finde moisture to refresh and nourish their fiery constitutions. And therefore they di∣uided the Earth into two habitable Ilands, compassed about, and seuered in the mids with a huge Ocean: On this side whereof we are sicuated, and beyond, the Antipodes. Some Philosophers Leucippus. Democritus, Epieurus. Anaximande. indeede held otherwise, but with greater errours, as Leucippus, Democritus, Epieurus, Anaximander, which multiplied worlds, according to their fan∣cie. Rawe and vncertaine were the coniectures of the Aristot.2. meta.c.5. Plin.l.2.c 68. best. Yea, those whom we reue∣rence, as better then the best Philosophers, had no lesse errours in this point. The Gol∣den-mouthed Chrysst.u 14 & 17.in Heb.Thd. Doctor had a Leaden conceit that the heauens were not round, whom Theodoret is said to follow. Theophilact Theophilact.in 8.cap.ad Heb. alledgeth Basil for this his assertion, nec mo∣bile esse coelum, nec circulare, that heauen is neither moueable nor round, How firme∣ly, and confidently doth Firmianus Lact l.3.c.24. Institutionum. Lactantius both deny and deride the opinion, that there are Antipedes; But easier it was for him, with a Rhetoricall flourish, (wherein I thinke of all the Latine Fathers, he deserueth highest prize and praise) to dash this o∣pinion out of countenance, then to confute the Arguments and Allegations. vvhich hee there citeth in the Aduersaries name. But he that surpassed Lactantius no lesse in knowledge of truth, then hee was surpassed by him in smoothnesse of Stile, herein holdes equipage, and drawes in the same yoke of errour. I meane him, whose vene∣rable name no words are worthy and sufficient to Vshes in, Saint Augustine: vvho, though somewhere Aug.to. .de∣cem Categori. he affirmeth the Antipodes, yet elsewhere Aug.de ciuit. dei l. 16 c.11. pressed with an Ar∣gument, how men should passe from these parts in which Adam and Noah liued, to the Antipodes, through that vnmeasurable, Ocean, he thought it easiest to deny, that, which certaine experience at that time could not so easily proue: although Viues in eundem. euen then some reports (but obscure and vncertaine) had beene spread abroad of sailing about Africa, as Lib.7.c.vlt. a little before is shewed; which must enforce that which Augustine deni∣ed. Some Acosta & Sixt. Senens bibliot.l 5. annot. 3. also alledge Naeianen, Hierome, and Procopius, for this or the like opini∣on. But Poets, Phisosophers, Fathers, (in other things worthy our loue, for their de∣lightfull Poems; our admriation, for their profound Science; our awefull respect & reuerence, for their holy learning, and learned holinesse) herein wee bid you fare∣well: magis amica veri: as; our America, subiect to that supposed burning Zone, with clouds and armies of witnesses in her well peopled Regions can auerre, that the parts betwixt the Tropikes are both habitable and inhabited: and for the Perioeci, Periaeci are those which dwell in the same paralels, but contrarie Meridians. Anlicthones, which dwell in the opposite Zone or plage of the world. The Perici haue Summer and Winter, but not day & night a like: The Antaci haue day and night, a like, but not the seasons of the yeare. The An∣npdes differ in both. Ant oeci, Anticthomes, and Antipodes, the worlds roundnes, and other things of like na∣ture, this America yeeldes and is sufficient proofe: and the yearely compassing the world (which the Spaniards and Portugales diuide betwixt them) makes more then euident. And let those two English Ships, the onely two of one Nation which euer haue failed, & that with admirable successe and fortune, about the Globe of the earth, tell Lactantius Ghost, whether they dropped into the clouds (as he feared) there to become new constellations, which Antiquitie would easily haue artibuted to them The Golden Hinde (which trauersed the world round, and returned a golden Hinde indeede, with her belly full of Gold and Siluer) is yet at Deptford, there resting after her long iourney, offering vp herselfe to time, her deedes to eternitie. That which beguiled the ancients, was the neerenesse of the Sunne, his direct beames, and the swift motion of the heauens, which, they coniectured, did chase away cold, and moi∣sture out of all those parts. And hardly could reasō otherwise guesse, till experience That all the world is habi∣table, see the discourse of George Best. in a Preface to the Northwest dis∣coueries of M. Frobisher and inserted Hak. voyag to.3.p.48. hath shewed the contrie. For neuer is it moister in those parts, betweene the Tropikes, then when the Sunne is neerest, then causing terrible stormes and showers euery day: as if hauing drunken too much in his long and hote iourney ouer the Ocean, hee did there vomit it vp againe. Once, the people of those parts reckon it Winter, when the Astronomer would call it Summer: because of this taedious weather which euery day happening cannot but coole the aire and earth, with a maruellous temper:
and on the other side, they call the time of the Sunnes absence, Summer, because of the perpetuall cleanenesse, which continueth those six moneths; the Sunne then exhaling no more vapours then his hote stomacke can digest, which with his directer beames being drawne vppe, surcharge him with aboundance; and in the middle Re∣gion of the Ayre, by the then stronger Antiperistasis are thickened into raines, and attended with Thunders and Lightnings, proclaime daily defiance to the Earth: threatning harme, but doing good: cooling the same, after the morning-Sunne hath heated it, the showers then falling, when the Sunne threatens his hotest furie and violence. These raines make the like inundations and ouerflowings of Riuers in America (as before wee haue obserued in Nilus, Niger, and Zaire in Africa) which breaking their bounds, and driuing the Inhabitants, sometimes to dwell on trees growing, some∣times in their carkasses framed into Boates or Canoes, therein to retire themselues, till the Waters are retired, cause a cooling and refreshing to the earth, which they couer and shield by their inundations from the Sunnes angry arrowes. As in a Lim∣becke, a strong fire eauseth aboundance of vapours to bee extracted out of hearbes, or other matter, which beeing pressed, and finding no issue, turne into water: and if the fire bee small, it exhausteth the vapours as fast as it raiseth them: So the Sunne (in his greatest strength) exhaleth these plentifull vapours, which it distilleth in sho∣wers, which in lesse heate are of lesse quantitie, and more easily consumed. With∣out the Tropikes it is contrarie: for the Sunne is drie, the Winter moist; the cause beeing the Sunnes weakenesse, not able to concoct and disperse the vapours which the moist earth, then easily yeeldeth: which in his greater force in the Summer season we see effected: The like we see in greene wood and drie on the fire. It is no lesse worthie note, that no part of the World hath so many, so great Lakes, and Riuers: the vapours and Exhalations whereof, can not but coole and moysten the neighbouring Elements of the Ayre and the Earth. Againe, the equall length of the Dayes and Nights perpetually sharing the Time in equall portions, cau∣seth Qnodque die Sols violento in∣canduit aestu: Humida Nox reficit paribus∣que refrigerat bors, Honterus. that the heate is not so vnequall as the Ancients dreamed. The great deawes also in the night, which are greater then wee would thinke, and comparable for wet∣ting to pretie showers, encrease the freshnesse and coolenesse. Wee may adde heereunto, the neighbourhoode of so huge an Ocean, the pro∣prietie of the Windes, which in most places betweene the Tropikes are set, and cer∣taine, no lesse then the Sunne and Tides, and bring with them much refreshing: Fur∣ther, the situation of the Land doth further the colde not a little, in those hote Re∣gions; D. Fletcher. Contrariwise, neare the Poles, the continuance of the Sunne, and long daes make it hoter then in parts nearer the Sunne; as in Russia, then in England. Yea the high ridges and toppes of some mountaines in the burning Zone, are vnsufferable for colde, alwayes hauing on them, snowe, haile, and frozen waters, the grasse withered, and the men and beasts which doe passe along that way (for heere is no conuenient dwelling) benummed with the extreamitie of colde. —Paries cùm proximus alget, When the Mountaines are subiect to this Degree of colde, it can not but temper the Nighbour-Regions, with some coolenesse at least. Now to all these Reasons of the Temperature, vnder the Line, and betweene the Tropikes, some adde the influ∣ence of some vnknowne Constellations. Only let this be remembred, That the former hold not equally in all parts of the Torride Zone, seeing that Nature hath diuersified her selfe in diuers places, and by naturall exceptions hath bounded and limited those gene∣rall Rules. In some places, vnder the Line, it rayneth not at all: in other-some, those cooling Windes are wanting: neyther hath euerie Region Lakes, Riuers, or Moun∣taines to refresh them. But of these particulars we shall take better view in their pe∣culiar places. In the same space the windes are most-what Easterly, and without
the Tropikes westerly: so that the Mariners vse not to goe and returne the same way, but obseruing the generall windes, seeke to make vse thereof accordingly. The reason of this Easterly winde vnder the Zodiake Acosta l. 3. c. 6. is ascribed to the motion of the heauens: the first, moueable drawing with his owne motion the inferiour Orbes, yea, euen those elementarie, of the Fire, Aire, and (where it findes no other obsta∣cle) of the water also, as Pet. Mart. Dec 3.l.. Sir Hf. Gil∣bert Discou. Maister George Best. some suppose. But for the Aire (whereof wee now speci∣ally speake) the motion of the Comets, circularly carried in the Aire, (where also their motion is diuers, as is obserued in the Pianets) doth sufficiently proue. Without the Tropikes from 27. to 37. degrees, the windes are said to bee or the most part westerly, moued as some thinke by the repercusion of the Aire, here preuailing a∣gainst that force of the heauens, which mastereth it within the Tropikes: euen as we see waters, being encountred with others of more force, returne in a manner backe. This of the Easterly windes is to bee vnderstood of the Sea: for at Land, though there windes bee (as before is said) certaine and set, yet that which is the generall winde of one countrey is not generall to all: yea, in the same countrey they haue a set winde in some places for the day, and another quite contrarie bloweth in the night. Linscboten I. 3. Also, neere vnto the coasts they are more subiect to calmes in this burning Zone, then further off in the Sea, the grosser vapours which arise out of the Earth, and the diuers situation thereof being the cause of these differences. Such is the force of this naturall situation, that in some places it is strange what effects it produceth. There is in Peru a high Mountaine called Patiacaca, wherevpon Ioseph lof. Acoft. Na∣tur. and Morall Hist. of the In∣dies.l,3.c.9. Acosta, saith hee ascended as well prouided as hee could, being forewarned and forearmed by men ex∣pert. But in the ascent hee and all the rest were surprised with so sodame panges of straining and casting, and some also of scowring, that the Sea-sicknes is not compa∣rable hereunto. Hee cast vp Meate, Flegme, Choller, and Bloud, and thought hee should haue cast out his heart too. Some thinking to die therewith, demanded Con∣fession: and some are said to haue lost their liues with this accident. The best is, it lafts but for a time, neither leaues any great harme behinde. And thus it fareth in all the ridge of that mountaine, which runnes aboue a thousand and fiue hundred miles, although not in all places alike. In foure different passages thereof, hee found the like difference and distemper, but not so greeuous as at Pariacaca. Hee ascribes it to the subtiltie of the Aire on those high hilles, which hee thinkes are the highest in the world: the Alpes and Pirenees, beeing, in respect hereof, as ordinarie houses, compa∣red to high Towers. It is desart, the grasse often burnt and blacke, for the space of fiue hundred leagues in length, and fiue and twenty or thirtie in bredth. There are o∣ther Desarts in Peru, called Punas, where the aire cutteth of mans life without fee∣ling: a small breath, not violent, and yet depriuing men sometimes of their liues, or else of their feete and hands, which fall off as a rotten Apple from a Tree, with∣out any paine. This seemeth to be done by the force of cold, which in the Northern and Northeasterne parts of Europe worketh like effects: some This Maister Grge Barkley, a Marchant, which liued long in Liuo∣nia, told me of his owne sight. beeing found dead sodainely in those sledds in which they came to market, sitting therein as if they were aliue, and some loosing their ioints, by the like cause. But this makes vp the strange∣nesse of these mortall accidents, that this piercing cold aire both killeth and preser∣ueth the same body, depriuing it of life, and yet freeing it from putrefaction. A cer∣taine Dominike passing that way, fortified himselfe against the colde windes, by heaping vp the dead bodies which here he found, and reposing himselfe vnder this shelter, by these dead helpes saued his life. The cause is, Putrefaction cannot bee procreated, where her parents, Heat and Moisture are confined, and haue litle or no force. The Seas which compasse this westerne India, besides the Magellane strcits, and the Northerne vnknowne, (for the knowledge whereof our countreymen, Sir Mar. Fro∣bish. Maister Iohn Dauis. Tho. Hudson. Fro∣bisher, Danis, Hudson, haue aduentured their liues and fortunes, and at last haue giuen vs more hope then euer of the discouerie) are the great and spacious Ocean, which on this side is called the North Sea, and on the other side of America, is named the South Sea. The qualities thereof will better appeare, when wee come to speake of the Ilands therein.
Concerning the Land of the New-world, Acosta diuideth it into three parts, high, lowe, and meane: which hold almost the same proportion that Maister Lam∣bert Lambert. Peramb. of Kent. Wealth with∣out health. Health without wealth. Health and wealth. obserueth of Kent, the first hauing some wealth, by reason of the Hauens, and Ports therein, and of the vines that grow there, but are very vnholsome: the hilles are healthfull, but not fertile, except in the Siluer bowels, and golden entralls thereof: the third is the most commodious habitation, where the soile yeeldeth Corne, Cattell, and Pasture, and the Aire, health. The principall thing that hath brought this Westerne India into such request is, the Mines and mettalls therein. The wisedome of GOD Acosta. l. 4. c. 2 hath made mettalls for Physicke, for defence, for ornament, and specially for instruments in the worke which God hath imposed vpon man, that in the sweate of his browes hee should eate his bread. The industry of man hath ad∣ded another vse of mettalls, by weight or stampe, conuerting it to money, which the Philosopher Arist. Eth.l.5. calles the measure of all things. And a fit measure might it haue been, if the minde of man were not vnmeasurable, and vnsatiable in measuring this measure. Metalls naturally grow (as some Pile. de genes. Mundi l.5. Euleh. de prap. Enang.l. 8 c. 9. obserue) in land naturally most barren: Na∣ture recompensing the want of other things with these hidden treasures: and the God of Nature enriching the Indians with this substance, otherwise barren of hu∣mane and diuine knowledge, that might as a rich Bride (but withered and defor∣med) make her finde many utors for loue of her portion. And would God, they which reape here these Temporall things, would sow Spirituall, & giue them Apec 3.18. Psal. 12.6. Gold tried in the fire, and that which is as Siluer tried seuen times, I meane the Word of God sin∣cerely preached, without the drosse of their owne superstitions, And would they gaue them nt Iron for their Gold, an Iron Age for a golden, imposing a heauy yoke of seruitude Bart. de las Calas Hispan.

Benzo.l. 3. c. 21. which hath consumed worlds of people in this New World, and made the name of CHRIST and Christian to stinke amongst them: yea, they abhorre the Sea it selfe, for bringing forth such monsters, as they thinke the Spaniards: whom for their execrable wickednes, they esteemed, not to come of humane generation, but of the froth of the Sea, and therefore call them Viracochie, or Sea-froth. That which one saith of Religion, I may apply to this American world, Peperit dinitias, & filia denora∣uit matrem. Shee brought forth rich mettals, and the Daughter hath consumed the Mother: her golde that should haue beene a price in her hand to buy wisedome, hath to these importunate chapmen sold her freedome.

Ammtas. a Golden and Siluer Age indeede to the Spaniards, for the condition and state which hereby accreweth to them, not for the conditions and state of life, which they obserue: In the yeare 1587. When Acosta came to Peru, eleuen millions were transported in the two Fleetes of Peru and Mexico, almost one halfe thereof for the King. In the time when Pollo was Gouernour of Charcas in Peru, from the Mines of Potozi alone vvere drawne and customed euery day thirtie thousand Pezoes of Siluer, euery Pezo a∣mounting to thirteene Rialls, and a fourth part: and yet it is thought the one halfe was not customed. And at this day saith Acostel. 4. c. 7. Acosta, the Mines of Poozi yeeld the King a million of Siluer, for his fift yearely, besides the wealth that growes by Quicke∣siluer, and other Prerogatiue. In the yeare 1574. were ented threescore and six∣teene millions. That which is wrought in this countrey is not entred, besides prinie conueyances. How much differeth Potozi from the Mine Bebello in Spaine, one thou∣sand and fiue hundred paces deepe, admired, and that iustly, by Plin.l.2.3.c.6. Antiquitie, for yeel∣ding three hundred pounds weight of Siluer a day to Hannibal, but with much more charges, by reason, of the intolerable paines in drawing out the waters, which there∣in flowed, and in Potozi are wanting? But what will not this vnlouely loue of money doe? hereby man encountreth the vast Ocean, passeth the farthest and most contrarie climates, drowneth Bootes and all his teame, burieth himselfe in the bowels of the earth, raiseth new heauens, and seeketh his heauen, where hee cannot see heauen, or light, neere the bottomelesse bottomes of Hell: remoueth Fountaines, and Mountaines, re∣duceth a new Chaos, in the confusion of Elements; the Earths entralls beeing tw∣ored in the Aire, and sacrificed to his hoter brother in fierie purgations, the Aire fil∣ling the darke hollowes and hells which it cannot see, the waters forced out of those
possessions wherein they challenged succession and inheritance after the decease and remouing of the earth: all filled with darknes, to bring to light those metalls, which possessing the possessors, depriue them of the highest light, and brand them for lowest darknes.

How happy and golden was the out∣ward state of these Indians, before they accounted gold any part of their happinesse, and found it the cause of their ruine? Their golde is found either in Graines which they call Pippins, because they are like the Pippins or Seedes of Melons; which is pure and hath no neede of melting: or in powder, which is found in Riuers, mixed with the soile and sand for which Tagus, Pactolus, and Ganges haue beene famous: or else in stone, being  veine that groweth and engendreth, intermixing it selfe vvith the stones  Toose Pippins, or peeces of pure golde, found among the Rockes or Hils, are sometimes very great. P. Martyr P. Mart. dec.1.l.10. telles of one that weighed three thousand three hundred and ten Pizos, and was with much people and treasure drowned, in the ship called Boadill being therewith surcharged, in the returne homewards: A fit Em∣bleme for Christians, which when they will Abac. 2 6. lade themselues with this thick clay, 1. Tim. 6.3. drowne the soule in perdition and de ruction. The greatest quantitie is drawne at the Indies in the poulder-gold. The gold in stone is drawne out of the mines or pits, with great dif∣ficultie. They rofine pouldred golde in basens, washing it in many waters, vntill the sand fall from it, and the golde, as most heauy, remaineth in the bottome. They haue other meanes of refining it with Quick-siluer and strong Waters. In the Fleete 1585. the declaration of the Firmeland was twelue Cassons or Chests, which was so many hundreth weights of gold: besides one thousand fiftie and six Mares from New Spaine, which was for the King onely, not mentioning that which came for Mar∣chants, and priuate men. For the Siluer: the second place is giuen to it among metalls, because next to golde it is the most durable, and lesse endamaged by the fire, and in the sound and colour, passeth the gold. The Mines thereof are commonly in Mountaines & Rockes, seldome in Plaines, and Champaines. Sometimes they finde it Plny saith (but not true∣ly) that siluer is neuer found pure. straggling, in peeces, not holding any continuing Veine: sometimes it is fixed, and spreadeth it selfe in depth and length like to great branches, I haue seene some in al pro∣portion resem∣bling Plants, with the leaues spread, and di∣uided, and a stalke ascen∣ding, as if it promised flow∣ers, much like the Ribwort. The like report. tth Munster. Cosmog.l. 1. c. 9. and armes of Trees. Strange it is that in some places the fire, kindled with blowing of bellowes, will not serue to refine the Siluer, but they vse furnaces called Guayras, set in such places, where the winde continually bloweth. See of these labours. Plin. l.33 c.6. and more in Acosta l. 4. Thus in Peru, the mines of Porco sloupe to artificiall fires, which those of Potozi scorne and contemne. Potozi is a drie, colde, barren, and vnpleasant soile, if the rich Mines did not more then supply all those defectes, and make it a plentifull both habitation and Mart; not fearing the heauens disasters, the cold Aire, the frowning Earth, the fell showers, so long as the Siluer hooke can be sufficient attractiue for forraine store. Hence it is, that they feele no want of store, and yet haue no store but of want; the Mines excepted, which (I know not how) are both store and want, according as mens mindes in a second refining can digest and dispose them. They which worke in the Mines see no sunne nor light, by absence where of they finde both extreme cold, and dreadfull darknes, and an aire so vn∣holsome, as makes them no lesse sicke, then men tosled at Sea. They breake the me∣tall with hammers, and split it by force, and then carry it vp on their shoulders, by Ladders made of Neates Leather twisted like peeces of wood, which are cros∣sed with staues of wood: at the end of one Ladder begins another with seates of wood betweene, to rest them. They mount three and three. Hee that goes before carries a Candle tied to his thumbe: they haue their metall tied in a cloth like a scrip, each man bearing about fiftie pound weight, and that commonly aboue a hundred and fiftie A stade is the height of a man. stades in height. The most vsuall manner of refining in these times is by Quicksiluer: and therefore there are not now aboue two thousand Guayras in Po∣tozi, which haue beene in times past six thousand: a pleasant fight to such, whose
darkned conceits make their heauen vpon Earth, to see such a resemblance of the Starrie heauen in the night, dispersing such a manifold light. The siluer swamme on the topp, the other mettalls vnder, and the drosse in the bottome. The Quick∣siluer Acosta l.4.c.10 is admired for his naturall properties, that beeing a metall it is Liquid (not by Art as other metalls, or by expense, in which respect the other may no lesse bee called Quick-siluer, but) by it owne Nature: and beeing a liquor, is more heauie then those which haue a Naturall subsistence; this subsisting and sinking to the bot∣tome, when the other swimme aboue it. Gold onely challengeth presieminence, if Pli∣nie Plin.vbi supra. be beleeued. Nothing in this admirable liquor is more to be admired, then the na∣turall loue, and sympathie which it hath to Gold: as appeareth in such, as for the French disease vse ointments of this composition Lemuius de occultis naturae miraculis. l.3.c. vlt. if they weare a Gold Ring in their mouth, it attracteth this quicke and willing metall to it, from the Veines and inward parts, into which it had secretly and dangerously conueyed it selfe: the Ring plucked out of the mouth is of a Siluer complexion, which mutuall copulation nothing but fire can diuorce, or restore the same to the former colour. In their gildings of curious workes, it hath beene obserued that the workemen which vse Quick-siluer to that purpose, to preuent the secret and venemous exhalations thereof, haue swallowed a double duckat of Gold rolled vp, which drawes that fume of this liquor which enters in at the eares, eyes, nose, and mouth, vnto it in the stomach. Acosta saith, that if it meete with no solid body, where it may congele, it ascends till the aire by cooling the fume causeth it to fall in Quick-siluer. And for this fume Lem∣nius tells, that the Gold-Smithes hanging a cloth ouer the place where they Guild, which receiueth the fume of the Quicksiluer, finde that smoke in the cloth; recoue∣ring againe his former nature in drops of that Liquid metall Venenum rerum omnium est saith Plinie; it is a venome to all things, and yet a greater venome is in the mouth of man. I meane not that Rom.3.1.3. psal.140.3. poison of Aspes under the lips of many, as the Prophet spea∣keth in a spirituall sense, but euen in naturall operation, the Spettle of man enueno∣meth, with a stronger poison, this poison of Quick-siluer, and eithe killerh it, Some thinke that Quicke∣siluer cannot quite be killed. or at least depriueth it of the motion and quicknes, and maketh it pliant to medicines and ointments. Yea, some De saliue ho∣minis mirabili effectu vide Lemnium de oc∣cult. Nat.l.2.c.44. report that this Spettle of man, arising of secret vapours out of the body, as infectious exhalations out of vnholsome Lakes, especially when a man is fasting, killeth Scorpions, and other venemous beasts, or at least doth much hurt them. Quick-siluer disdaineth other metalls, onely it is thus rauished with gold, and not a little affected to siluer, for the refining of which, it is principally in vse: it corrupteth, forceth, consumeth, and fleeth the rest, as much as may be, and there∣fore they vse to keepe it in Earthen Vessels, bladders, skinnes, quills, and such vn∣ctucus receptacles. It hath pierced and eaten through the bodies of men, and hath beene found in their graues. Quick-siluer is found in a kinde of Stone, which doth likewise yeeld Vermillion. At Amador de Cabrera is such a Stone, or Rocke, foure∣score yards long, fortie broad, interlaced with Quick-siluer, with many pitts in it, threescore Stades deepe, and is able to receiue three hundred workemen: it is valu∣ed worth a million of Gold. From the mines of Guancauilca, they draw yearely eight thousand quintals of Quick-siluer, As for the manner of resining siluer, by Quicke∣siluer, their Engines and Milles, with the triall of their metall, I referre the Reader to Acost l.4.c. 12.13. Acosta. The Emeralds also grow in Stones like Chrystall, and there are many of them in the Indies. But of these and other gemmes it would be too taedious to write. Let vs come to the Men, Beasts, Fowles, and Plants of this New World.
CHAP. II. Of the first knowledge, habitation, and discoueries of the New world, and the rare Creatures therein found, Beasts, Birds Trees, Hearbs, and Seeds. AFter these generall Discourses of the Americans, some other of like nature I hold not vnmeete to be handled, before wee come to the parti∣cular Regions: and first of the men, whether the Ancients had any knowledge of them: how men first came into these parts, and of the first discoueries in the former Age. Concerning the first knowledge of these parts, it may iustly be a question whether the Ancients euer heard thereof. For to say nothing of that opinion, that the torrid Zone was not ha∣bitable in the opinion of the most, as wee haue shewed in the former Chapter: the allegations Hums.Gilbert Discou. O tel. Theat. in charta.N.O.bis Hak in Epist Ded. to.1.to.3 are not such as can force vs to beleeue that, whereto by great Authours they are alledged, Senceas Sen.biedea. Act.2. Prophecie is little to the purpose: New-worlds (saith he) shall be in the last Ages discouered, and Thule Thule is by Mercaro and others inter∣preted Island: by Ostdius Tilemarke in Norway. shall not bee any longer the fur∣thest of Ntions. But all that Chorus seemes to a diligent Reader to in: end nothing else, then to describe the vsuall affects, and effects of shipping and Nauigation; agreeing to that Argo-Argument of the Tragedie, wherein Iason in that famous Argo sailing to Colso, had obtained Medea's loue, which he vnkindly required. And had the Poet intended these. Westerne Dis∣coueries, he would neuer haue said Nec sit terris Vltima Thule: but Nec sit tellus Vltima Gades, as Boterus Botero parte 1.l.4. obserued. For the American Discoueries haue not beene by the way of Ise∣land, and Northward, but Southwestward: and this appeareth by the Verses before, Nunc tam cessit Pontus & omnes, Pat itur leges.— Qualibet altum cymba pererrat: Nilqua fuer at, sede, reliquit Peruis orbis, Indus gelidum Potat Araxem, Albin Persae Rhenum{que} bibunt; venient annis Secula seris, quibus Oceanus Vincla rerum laxet, As for Plato's Platos dis∣coursehere of is Englished by R.

Out of Platarch & other Histories of the Carthaginian, Phaenician, and Tyrrne∣man Nauigations they haue coniectures, but very vncertaine, & obscure: & those things, which Diodorus Diod.Sic.l.5.c.7. Arist de admi∣randis auditio∣nibus. reports of that Iland, agree nothing to the New-world which had not attained to that ciuilitie he there mentioneth, before the Spaniards arriuall.

This I much doubt; whether their Science in Nauigation was such, as that they would voluntarily aduenture, and could happily effect, this voyage to and from the West Indies. The most probable Historie in this kinde is (in my minde) that of D. Powell hi∣storie of Cam∣bria pag.22; A.D. 1 170. Madoc ap Owen Gwyneth, who by reason of ciuill contentions, left his Coun∣trie of Wales, seeking aduentures by Sea, and leauing the coast of Ireland North, came to a land vnknowne, where hee saw many strange things. This by D. Powell, and Mr. Humfrey Floyd, is thought to bee the Continent of the new world, confirmed here in by the speech of Muteaeuma, professing his progenitors to be strangers; and so were al the Mexicanes to those parts, as the Historie in the eighth Chapter following will shew: and by the vse of certaine Welsh words which Dan.lngram Ha.edit.1.to.3. Mereditih ap Rise & Gutyn Owen make mention of this Owens Na∣uigation. See Hak to 3.pag 1. Da∣nid Ingram obserued in his trauell through those parts. The Historie addeth that hee left certaine of his people there, and comming home for more people, returned thi∣ther with ten saile. Howsoeuer, it is certaine that the prints of this Brittish expe∣dition are in manner worne out, and no signe thereof was found by the Spaniards: Onely A.S. Andrews crosse in Cu∣mana.

As for Mutezuma beeing a stranger, it might bee so, and yet his proge∣nitours of some other parts of America. And the words of Welsh are 3.or 4.words. very few, which, as it happens in any other language, might by some chance come to passe. But if any bee desirous to beleeue, that this Madoc peopled the Continent or I∣land of America, rather then the Terceras, or some of the African Ilands, I will not hinder: nor will I runne too much out of compasse, in pleading for the Compasse, as which onely can direct in such spacious Seas. Yet of this opinion is that learned and iudicious Authour, Iosephus Acosta, who diligently discussing this question, How men passed first to the Indies; largely, and learnedly contendeth, that they came not thither purposely, if they came by Sea, but by distresse of weather; and yet findes no lesse difficultie, (that way) in the transporting beastes; especially wilde, and vnprofitable beastes, which it is not like any would take into Ship with them, much lesse conuay them ouer so huge an Ocean. At last he concludeth, that although some might arriue there by ship-wracke, and tempest of weather, yet is it most likely that the first inhabitants (descended of Adam and Noah, of which one Act.17.26. bloud God hath made all mankinde, to dwell on all the face of the Earth, and hath assigned the bounds of their habitation) passed thither by some place where the Con∣tinent of our world ioineth with America: or the Ilands thereof, are found fit me∣diatours for this passage, beeing not farre distant from the land. Ortchus in his map of mare Pacificum, af. firmeth that the people ofAmerica in likelihood were peopled from Europe by Gronland Ifland, Fri fland, &. And this on the North parts of the world, (where they place that strait of Anian, not yet certainely discouered) may bee so: besides that, on the South, men might passe from the coasts of Malacca to Iaua, and so to the South Continent, and from thence by the Magellane streights into America. Gronland is thought also, by some, to be the same Continent with Estotiland on the North. Some Negro's by force of tempest, it is probable, haue passed hither, because in Careca some haue beene found, betweene S. Martha, and Cartagena. Of whom Iohn Io di Castel∣lanos. di Castellanos writeth. Son todos ellos Negros come cueruos, &c. they are all (saith hee) as blacke as Ra∣uens. And of this minde is Botero. Du Bartas Colonies. Morney. deverit. Christ. Relig. Botero vbi sup. and those French Worthies, Du Bartas, and Phi∣lip Morney. It is not likely that the beasts could otherwise passe, but by the Continent, or by Ilands not farre off from the Continent, or from one another. Here also ari∣seth another question, how these beastes could passe from the parts of the knowne
world, where none such are knowne: to which it may be answered, That GOD hath appointed to euery Creature his peculiar nature, and a naturall instinct, to liue in places most agreeing to his nature: as euen in our world, Nonomnis fert omnia tellus: Euery Countrey hath not all Creatures: the Elephant, Rhinoceros, Riuer-Horse, Crocodile, Camell, Camelopardalis, and others, are not ordinarily, and naturally in Europe: nor the Zebra in Asia or Europe: and the like may bee said of many other Creatures. Now, as in the Arke it selfe, (the Cradle of man, and stall of bests,) wee must not onely obserue Nature and Art, for the making and mannaging thereof, but a higher and more powerfull hand: euen so in dispensing the Creatures which came from thence, they chole places by their owne naturall instinct, and man disposed, by his in∣dustry, according as he had vse of them; but most of all, the secret and mighty prouidence of God co-working in those works of Nature and Industry, and (in likelihood) infusing some more speciall & extraordinary instinct in that replenishing & refurnishing of the world, Act. 7.26. Assigning their seasons and bounds of habitation, hath thus diuersified his works, according to the diuersities of places, and sorted out to each Country their peculiar cre∣atures. As for the comming by shippe, it is for the beasts improbable, for the men (by any great numbers, or of any set purpose) vnlikely, seeing in all America they had no shipping, but their Canoes. The beasts also haue not beene found in the Ilands, which are in the Continent. And if any hereunto will adde a supposition, that there might be some Ilands or Parts of the Continent in times past, which is now swallowed by the mercilesse Ocean, so that then there might bee a way, which now is buied in the waues: (as some Sir Humphrie Gilberts Discouerie of the North-west. suppose) of Plato's Atlantis, placed at the mouth of the Streits, or Hercules Pillars, which yet they would haue to bee America, and some R. Versegans Antiquities. of the Sea betwixt Douer and Callais, once one firme Land (as they doe imagine) I list not to contradict them. F.G. histor. gener.parte . ca.13. As for the Indians owne report of their beginnings, which some ascribe to a foun∣taine, others to a Lake, others to a Caue, or what other opinion they conceiue there∣of, wee shall more fitly obserue in their proper places, discoursing of their Religions and Opinions: Now for the first certaine Discouerie of this New World, the World generally ascribeth it to Columbus, and worthily: but Columbus himselfe is sayd to haue receiued his instructions from another. This Historie is thus related by Gomara: A certaine Carauell, sayling in the Ocean, by a strong East winde long continuing, was carried to a Land vnknowne, which was not expressed in the Mappes and Cardes. It was much longer in returning, then in going; and arriuing, had none left aliue but the Pilot, and three or foure mariners, the rest being dead of famine and other extremities; of which also the remnant perished in few dayes, leauing to Columbus was borne at Cu∣gurco, or (as some say) at Nervi in the territory of Genua: he was a mariner frō a childe, and traded into Syria, and o∣ther parts of the East. After this he becam a master in making sea-cards: hee went to Portugall, to learn their nauigations on the coast of Africa, and there married. Gom. ca.14. R. Eden: Columbus (then the Pilots host) their Papers, and some grounds of this Discouerie. The time, place, countrey, and name of the man is vncertaine: Some esteeme this Pilote an Andaluzian, and that hee traded at Maders, when this be∣fell him: some, a Biscaine, and that his traffike was in England and France; and some, a Portugall, that traded at the Mina: some say he arriued in Portugall; others at Ma∣dera, or at one of the Azores: all agree that he died in the house of Christopher Colum∣bus. It is most likely at Madera. This relation of Gomara (as it hath no witnesses to prooue it, the whole company being dead; nor any good circumstances, so) Benzo Hier. Benzo lib.1.ca.5. plainely affirmeth it to be a fable, and a Spanish tricke, enuying a foreiner and Itali∣an that glory to be the first finder of the Indies. Hee citeth out of Peter Martyr an o∣ther cause that moued Columbus to this Discouerie, and not that Pilotes Papers or Re∣ports Gaspar Et libr. 1.ca.2. coniectureth, that Columbus (moued with his owne coniectures to this discouery) was confirmed further therein by this Pilote, which is said to die in his house. . For, hee being a mariner, vsed to the Sea from his youth, and sayling from Cales to Portugall, obserued, that at certaine seasons of the yeare, the Windes v∣sed to blowe from the West, whch continewed in that manner a long time together. And deeming that they came from some coast beyond the Sea, hee busied his minde so much heer with, that hee resolued to make some triall and proofe thereof. When he was now forty yeres old, he propounded his purpose to the Senate of Genua, vnder∣taking, if they would lend him shippes, hee would find a way by the west vnto the I∣lands
lands of Spices. But they reiected it as a Dreame. Columbus frustrate of his hopes at Genua, yet leaues not his resolution, but goeth to Portugall, and communicates this matter with Alphonsus King of Portugall: but finding no entertainement to his suites, sen eth his brother Bartholomsew Columbus to King Henrie the seuenth of England, to solicite him in the matter, whiles himselfe pas∣sed into Spaine, to implore the aide of the Castilians herein. Bartholomew Frnand Colamb-n vita patris Christo∣pho.i.cap.13.Hack. tom.3. vnhappily lighted on Pirats by the way, which robbing him and his company, lorced him to slaine himselfe with making of Sea-Cardes. And hauing got∣ten some what about him, presents a Mappe of the World to King Henrie, with his brothers offer o: Discouerie: which the King gladly accepted, and lent to call him in∣to England. But he had sped of his suite before in Spaine, and by the King and Queene was employed according to his request. For comming Gomara c.15 from Lisbone to Palos di Mo∣guer, and there conferring with Martin Alonso Pinzon, an expert Pilote, and Frier Io.Perez a good Cosinographer, he was counselled to acquaint with these his proiects, the Dukes of Medma Sidoma, and of Medina Caeli: which yeelding him no credit, the Fier counseiled him to goe to the Court, and wrote in his behalfe to Fer Fernand di Telavera the Queenes Confessor,.Christopher Columbus came to the Court of Castile, An.1486, and found cold welcome to his ste, at the hands of the King and Queene then busied with hote warres in Granada, whence they expelled the Moores. And thus remained he in contempt, as a man meanly clothed, without other Patrou then a poore Fer, saue that Alonso di Quintaniglia gaue him his diet, who also at last pro∣cured him audience with the Archbishop of Toledo, by whose mediation hee was brought before the King and Queene, who gaue him fauourable countenance, and promised to dispatch him, when they had ended the warres of Granada, which also they performed. Thus Columbus is set forth with three Caruells at the Kings charges, who because his treasure was then spent in the warres, borrowed sixeteene thousand ducats of Lewes de Sanct' Angelo: and on friday the third day of August, in the yeere of our Lord 1492. set saile for Gomera, one of the Canarie Iland, and hauing there re∣freshed himselfe, followed his Discouerie. After many dayes hee incountred with that herby Sea (whereof before wee haue Libr. 7.c vlt. spoken) which not a little amated and ama∣zed the Spaniards, and had caused their Pct.. dec. I returne, had not the sight of some Birds pro∣mised him land not fae off. But the Spauirds, after three and thirtie dayes sayling, desperate of successe, muti∣ned. and threatned to call Columbus into the Sea: A Beazo l.ibr.1.ca.6. disdaining much, that a stranger, a Geuos had so abused them. But he pacifying their enraged courages with milde speaches, and gentle promises, on the eleuenth day of October Gaspar.Ens li.1.ca.2. one Roderigo di Tri∣ana: spied and cried, Land, Land; the best musicke that might be, especially to Co∣lumbus, who to sai, fie the Spaniards importunity, had promised the day before, that if no land appeared in three days, he would returne. Columbi Na∣uigationes 1,2,3,4. One, the night before, had descri∣ed Fire, which kindled in him some hope of great reward at the Kings hand, when hee returned into Spaine, but being herein frustrate, he burnt into such a flame, as that it consumed both Humanitie and Christianitie in him, and in the agonie of Indignation made him ieau his Countrey, and aith, and reuolt to the Moores. Bt thee, Colum∣bus, how can I but remember? but loue? but admire? Sweetly may those bones rest, sometimes the Pillars of that Temple, where so diuine a Spirite resided; which neyther want of former example, nor publike discouragements of domesticall and forren states, nor priuate insultations of prowd Spaniards, nor length of time (which vsually deuou∣reth the best resolutions) nor the vnequall Plaines of huge vnknowne Seas, nor gras∣sie fields in Neptunes lappe, nor importunate whisperings, murmurings, threatnings of uraged companions, could daunt: O name Colon His true name was Co∣lon, which cor∣ruptly is cal∣led Columbus, , worthy to bee named vn∣to the worlds end, which to the worlds end hast conducted Colonies; or may I call thee Colombo for thy Doue-like simplicitie and patience? the tru. Colouna or Pillar, whereon our knowledge of this new world is founded, the true Christopher, which with more then Giant-like force and fortitude hast carried Christ his name and Religion, through vnknowne Seas, to vnknowne lands: which wee hope and pray, that it may be more
refined, and reformed, then Popish superstition, and Spanish pride will yet suffer. Now let the Ancients no longer mention Neptune, or Mines, or Erythras, or Danaus, to all which, diuers Authors diuersly ascribe the invention of Navigation; Mysians, Troy∣ans, Tyrians vaile your bonnets, strike your toppe-sailes to this Indian-Admirall, that deserveth the top-saile indeede, by aspiring to the top that Sayling could aime at, in discouering an other World. Let Spaniards, French, English, and Dutch resound thy name, or his name rather, Prouerb.30.4 whose name, who can tell? that would acquaint thee and the world by thee, with newes of a New World. But lest we drowne our selues in this Sea of Extasie and Admiration, let vs go on shore with Columbus in his new discoue∣red Iland. And first me thinkes I see the Spaniards, yesterday in mutiny, now as farre distracted in contrary passions; some gazing with greedie eies on the desired Land; some with teares of iny, not able to see that, which the ioy of seeing made them not to see: others embracing, and almost adoring Columbus, who brought them to that sight: some also with secret repinings enuying that glorie to a stranger; but biting in their bi∣ting envie, and making shew of glee and gladnesse: all new awaked out of a long trance, into which that stepmother Ocean, with dangers, doubts, dreads, despaires had deiected them, revived now by the sight of their Mother Earth, from whome in vnknowne armes they had beene so long weaned and detained. On shore they goe, and felling a tree, make a Crosse thereof, which they erected on the shore, and take possession of that New World in the name of the Catholike Kings. What worldly ioy is not mixed with some disastre? their Admirall heere splitteth on a rocke, but the men are saued by the help of the other shippes. This fell out in the North part of Hispaniola (so named by them, and by the Inhabitants called Haytin) where they had first sight of Inhabitants, which seeing these strangers, ranne all away into the mountaines. One woman the Spaniards got, whom they vsed kindely, and gaue her meat, drinke, and clothes, and so let her goe. She declaring to her people the liberalitie of this new people, easily perswaded them to come in troupes to the shippes, thinking the Spaniards to be some diuine Nation, sent thither from Heauen. They had before taken them for the Caribes, which are certaine Caniballs, which vsed inhumane huntings for humane game, to take men for to eate them: Children likewise, which they gelded to haue them more fatte, and then to deuoure them: the women they are not, but vsed them for procreation, and if they were old, for other seruices. The Ilanders had no other defence against them but the wooddy hilles, and swiftest heeles: to which they betooke them at the Spaniards arriuall, thinking them (as is said) to be Caniballs. And such haue they since proued, in effect, Bart.dels Casas, Hispan. crudeht. not leauing of 3 milions of people which here they found, 200:& that long since. The Deuill had forewarned them of this by Oracle Historie of China pa 312. H. Benzo. l.t.c.8 , that a bearded Nation should spoile their Images, and spill the bloud of their children, as we shall see in the particu∣lar Tractate of Hispaniola. Nothing more pleased the Spaniards, then the golde, which the naked Inhabitants exchanged with them, for bells, glasses, points, and other trifles. Columbus obtained leaue of Guacanarillus, the Cacike or King, to build a fort The fort of The Natiuitie in Hispaniola. , in which he left eight and thirtie Spaniards, and taking with him six Indians, returned to Spaine, where he was ly welcomed of the King and Queene. The Pope Alexander a wicked Pope. Guicciard.lib.

(then a Spaniard, Alexander the ring of this, diuided the World, by his Bull, betwixt the Portu∣gals and Spaniards. The Bull is become an Vnicorne, & his two horns are now growne into one: in the vniting of the two states. Columbus, graced with the title of Admirall, and enriched with the tenths of the Spanish gaines in the Indies, is sent a second time, with his brother Bartholomew, who was made Adelant ado or Deputy of Hispaniola. They had allowed them for this Expedition, small and great, seuenteen saile. The first I∣land he espied in his second nauigation, hee called Desseada or Desired, because hee had longed to see land. Arriuing in Hispaniola, hee found the Spaniards which hee had left there, that they were now not left, nor any where to be found. The Indians had murdred them & laid the blame on the Spanish insolencies. He then discouered Cuba & Iamaica, with the neighbor-isles. Returning to Hispaniola, he found his brother & the Spaniards in dissention and separation, and punishing the Authors of sedition, returned home. In the yeere of our Lord, one thousand foure hundred ninety seuen, hee made his third
voyage, and then touched on the Continent; discouered Cubagua, Pauia, and Cumans. But Koldanus Ximenius raising a rebellion, and accusing the Columbi to the King, effected that Bovadilla was sent Gouernor into Hispaniola, who sent the two brethren bound as prisoners to Spaine: vnworthy recompence of the worthy attempts of these Worthies. The King sreeth them, and employeth Christopher in a fourth voyage, 1502: in which Ovandus the Gouernour forbade Columbus the first finder to land on Hispa∣niola. Gasp.En lib. 1.ca.5. He then discouered Guanaxa, Higuera, Fondura, Veragua, Vraba, and lear∣ned newes (as some say) of the South Sea. He staied at Iamaica to repaire his fleet, where some of his men were sicke, and they which were sound in bodie, were more then sicke, foward and  in behauiour, and many left him. Vpon this occasion the Ilan∣ders also for sooke him, and brought in no victuall. Herewith Columbus, neither able to abide, nor depart, was driuen to his shifts, no lesse admirable for suttletie then re∣solution. Vide libr. 5. ca.16.pag 452. He told the Ilanders, that if they did not bring him in prouision, the Diuine Anger would consume them, a signe whereof they should see in the darkened face of the Moone within two dayes. At that time he knew the Moone would be eclip∣sed, which the simple Ianders seeing, with feare and griefe humbled themselues to him, and offered themselues ready to all kinde and duetifull Offices. At last, returning into Spaine, he there died, Anno 1506. His body was buried at Siuill in the Temple of the Carthusians. This was the end (if euer there can be end) of Columbus.

The particulars will more fitly appeare in our particular relations of each countrey. After this discourse of the men in those parts, let vs take some generall view of the o∣ther creatures, especially such as are more generally disperst through the Indies. I haue before noted, that America had very few of such creatures as Europe yeeldeth, vntill they were transported thither: and therefore they haue no Indian names for them, A rule to know what beasts were here naturall (or to such they haue names in their owne Lan∣guage) and what transpor∣ted: for these the Indians call by their Span. names. but those which the Spaniards that brought them, giue vnto them: as horse, kine, and such like. They haue lions, but not like in greatnesse, fiercenesse, nor colour to those of A∣frica. They haue beares in great aboundance, except on the North parts. They haue store of deere, bores, foxes, and tygres, which (as in Congo) are more cruell to the Naturalls then to the Spaniards. These beasts were not found in the Ilands, but in the Continent; and yet now in those Ilands, kine are multiplied and growne wilde, with∣out other owner then such as first can kill them: Acost.libr..c.21. & l 4 c.34 the dogges likewise march by troups, and endamage the cattell no lesse then wolues. The lions are grey, & vse to clime trees: the Indians hunt and kill them From Hispa∣niola were shipped Anno 1587. 35444 hide., & from new Spaine 64350. . The beares and tigres are like those in other parts but not so many. Apes and Monkies they haue of many kinds & those admirably pleasing in their apish tricks & imitations, seeming to proceed from Reason. A souldier leuelling at one of them to shoot him, the sily beast died not vnreuenged, but hurling a stone as the other aimed at him, depriued the souldier of his eie, and lost his owne life. They haue monkies with long beards. Acosta Lib.4.ca.39. See Car. Clus. de exot. & O∣uied.gen. histor, & summer. Gsn.de Quadr. tells of one monky that would goe to the Taucrne at his masters sending, and carrying the pot in one hand, and mony in the other, would not by any meanes depart with his mony, till he had his pot filled with wine: and retur∣ning home, would pelt the boies with stones, and yet haue care to carry his wine home safe to his master, neither touching it himselfe til some were giuen him, nor suffering o∣ther. Sheep haue much increased, and by good husbandrie, in that plentie of pasture, would be a great commodity: but in the Ilands the wild dogs destroy them: and there∣fore they that kill these dogs, are rewarded for it, as they which kill wolues in Spaine. The dogs P. Mart.de Insulis. which the Indians had before, were snowted like foxes; they fatted them to eate, and kept them also for pleasure: but they could not barke: Such dogges (we haue shewed) are in Congo. Their stagges Ouied.sum∣mar.22. and deere in the south parts of America, haue no hornes. They haue store of conies. The Armadilla is an admirable creature, of which there be diuers kinds: they resemble a* barded horse, seeming to be armed all ouer, and that as if it were rather by artificiall plates, opening & shutting, then naturall scales: it digges vp the earth as couics and moules.
The hogs Cataphractus equus. of the Indies haue their nauill vpon the ridge of their backes. They goe in heards together, and assaile men, hauing sharp talons, like rasors, and hunt their hun∣ters vp the ops of trees, whence they easily kill these enraged Sainos (so they call them) biting the tree for anger. The Dantes resemble smal kine, & are defended by the hardnes of their hides. The Vicugne somewhat resembleth a goate, but is greater: they sheare them, and of their fleeces make rugges and couerings, and stufies. In the stomacke and belly of this beast is found the Bezaar-stone somtimes one alone, sometimes, two, three, or foure: the colour of which is blacke, or grey, or greene, or otherwise: it is accounted soueraigne against poisons & venomous diseases. It is found in diues sorts of beasts but all chew the cud, & commonly feed vpon the snow and rocks. The Indian sheep they cal Lama, it is a beast of great profit, not only for food and raiment, but also for carriage of burthens: they are bigger then sheep, & lesse then calues: they will beare 150.li.weight. In some places they call them Amidas, and vse them to greater burthens. Hulderike Schmidel Hul. Schmi∣del.ca.44. Anno Do.1548. affirms, that he living in the parts about the riuer of Plate, being hurt on his leg, rode 40 leagues vpon one of them. They wil grow resty, & will lie down with their burthen, no stripes nor death able to asswage their moode; only good words, and faire dealing, with gentle intreaty, sometimes diuers houres together, can preuaile. Of towles they haue many kinds which we haue, as partriges, turtles, pigeons, stock∣doues, quailes, salcons, herons, eagles: and a world of Parrots, which in some places flee by flocks, as pigeons. There are also Estriges. Hens they had before the Spaniards ariued. They haue other kinds peculiar: The Tomin Aug Carate. hist.Peru libr.I. is the least in quantitie, the greatest for admiration and wonder. I haue oft times doubted (saith Acosta) seeing them flie, whe∣ther they were Bees or Butter-flies; but in truth they are birds. Theuet And.Thevet. ca.41. Lerius nav.c.11 and Lerius call it Gonambuch, or Govanbuch. They affirme tht it yeelds nothing in sweetnes of Note to the Nightingale, and yet is not bigger then a Beetle or Drone-bee: One would say, Voxes, praetereanihil: but so could not any truly say, for euen otherwise is it almost mi∣raculous: Nature making this little shop her great store-house of wonder, and astonish∣ment, and shewing Natura in magnis magna, in minimis ma∣xima. her greatest greatnesin the least instruments. The Prouinciall of the Iesuites in Brasill, affirmeth, as Clusius Car.Clus.Exot.libr.5. testifies, that the Brasilians called it Ourissia, which signifieth the Sun-beame, and that it was procreated of a flie; and that he had seen one, partly a bird, and partly a flie: first coloured blacke, then ash-coloured, then rose∣coloured, then red: and lastly, the head set against the Sun, to resemble all colors, in most admired varietie. It flieth so swift (saith Ouiedo sum∣mar. ca.48. Ouiedo) that the wings cannot be seen. It hath a nest proportionable. I haue seene (saith he) one of those birds, together with her nest, put into the scales, wherein they vse to weigh gold, and both weighed but two tomin, that is, 24 graines. Happly it is therefore calle. Tomineios, as weighing one Tomin. The feathers are beautified with yellow, green, & other colours: the mouth like the eie of a needle. It liueth on Lopes de Go∣mara bistor. Me∣xicana, or Con∣quest of the West Indies. deaw, and the iuice of hearbs, but sitteth not on the rose. The fea∣thers, specially of the necke and breasts, are in great request for those feather-pictures, or portraitures, which the Indians make cunningly and artificially with these naturall fea∣thers, placing the same in place and proportion, beyond all admiration: The Indian Battes should not flee your light, and are for their raritie worthy consideration, but that we have before spoken somewhat of them. They haue Acost.l.4.c.17 birdes called Condores, of exceeding greatnesse and force, that will o∣pen a sheepe, and a whole calfe, and eate the same. They haue aboundance of birds, in beautie of their feathers farre surpassing all in Europe, wherewith the skilfull Indians will perfectly represent in feathers, whatsoeuer they see drawne with the Pensill. A fi∣gure of Saint Francis, made of feathers, was presented to Pope Sixtus Quintus, whose eie could not discerne them to be naturall colours, but thought them pencill-worke, til he made triall with his fingers. The Indians vsed them for the ornaments of their Kings and Temples. Some birds there are of rich commoditie, onely by their dung. In some Ilands ioyning to Peru, the mountaines are all white, like snowe, which is nothing but heapes of dung of certaine Sea-fowle which frequent those places. It riseth many elles, yea many launces in height, and is fetched thence in boates, to hearten the earth, which hereby is exceeding fertile.
To adde somewhat of the Indian Plants, and Trees. See Monar∣dus & Clusius. D. Lobel Gerard and other Herba. sts. Mangle is the name of a tree, which multiplieth it selfe into a wood (as before we haue obserued of it) the bran∣ches descending and taking roote in the earth. The Plane tree of India hath leaues sufficient to couer a man from the foote to the head: but these, the Coco, and other In∣dian trees, are in the East Indies also, and there wee haue mentioned them. Caecaeo is a fruit little lesse their Almonds, which the Indians vse for money, and make thereof a drinke, holden amongst them in high regarde. They haue a kinde of Apples Th. Turner. called Ananas, exceeding pleasant in colour and taste, and very wholesome, which yet haue force to eate yron, like aqua fortis. The Acosta libr. 4.ca.24. Mamayes, Guayaues and Paltos bee the In∣dian Peaches, Apples, and Peares. But it would be a wearie wildernesse to the Reader, to bring him into such an Indian Orchard, where hee might reade of such varietie of Fruits, but (like Tantalus) can taste none: or to present you with a garden of their trees, which beare flowers without other fruit, as the Floripondio, which all the yeare long beareth flowers, sweet, like a Lillie, but greater: the Volosuchl, which beareth a flower like to the forme of the heart, and others, which I omit: The flower of the Sunne is now no longer the Marigold of Peru, but groweth in many places with vs in England. The flower of the Grandille they say (if they say truly) hath the marks of the Passion, Nailes, Pillar, Whippes, Thornes, Wounds, exceeding stigmaticall Francis. For their Seedes and Graines, Mays is principall, of which they make their bread, which our English ground brings forth, but hardly will ripen: it growes, as it were, on a reed, and multiplieth beyond comparison; they gather three hundred measures for one. It yeeldeth more bloud, but more grosse, then our wheate. They make drinke thereof also, wherewith they will be exceedingly drunke. They first sleepe, and after boile it to that end. In some places they first cause it to be champed with Maids, in some places with olde women, and then make a Leaven thereof, which they boyle, and make this inebriating drinke. The Canes and Leaues serue for their Moles to eate. They boyle and drinke it also for paine in the backe. The buds of Mays serue in fleed of but∣ter and oile. In some parts they make bread of a great roote called Yuca, which they name Ca∣cavi. They first cut and straine it in a Presse, for the iuyce is deadly poyson: the Cakes dried are sleeped in water before they can eate them. Another kind there is of this Yu∣ca or Iucca, the iuyce whereof is not poyson. It will keepe long, like biscuit. They vse this bread most in Hispaniola, Cuba, and Iamaica, where wheat and Mays wil not grow, but so vnequally, that at one inflant, some is in the grasse, other in the graine. They vse in some places another roote called Papas, like to grownd Nuttes, for bread, which they call Chuno. Of other their roots and fruits I am loath to write, lest I wearie the Reader with tedious officiousnesse. Spices grow not there naturally: Ginger thriueth wel, brought and planted by the Spaniards. They haue a good kind of balme, though not the same which grew in Palestina. Of their Amber, Oiles, Gummes, and Drugges I lift not to relate further. Out of Spaine they haue carried great varietie of Plants, here∣in America exceeding Spaine, that it receiueth and fructifieth in all Spanish Spanish fruis thriue well in one place or other of the Indies. Plants that are brought thither, whereas the Indian thriue not in Spaine: as Vines, Oliues, Mulbe∣ries, Figges, Almonds, Limons, Quinces, and such like. And, to end this Chapter with a comparison of our World with this of America; Our aduantages and preferments are many. Botero Rel. part. prima li.4. Our Heauen hath more Starres, and greater, as Acosta by his owne sight hath obserued, challenging those Authors, which haue written otherwise, of fabling. Our Heauen hath the North starre within three degrees, and a third of the Pole: their Crosier or foure starres set a-crosse, which they obserue for the Antartike, is thirtie de∣grees off. The Sunne communicates his partiall presence seuen days longer to our Tro∣pike, then to that of Capricorne. The want of the Sunne and Starres is one cause of greater colde in those parts then in these. Our Earth exceedes theirs for the situation, extending it selfe more betweene East and West (fittest for humane life) whereas theirs trends most towardes the two Poles. Our Sea is more fauourable, in more Gulfes and Bayes, especially such The Bal∣tike, Persian, Arabian, Cas∣pian seas, &c. as goe
farre within Land, besides the Mid-land Sea, equally communicating her selfe to Asia, Africa, and Europa. This conuenience of Traffique America wanteth. Our Beasts, wilde and tame, are farre the more noble, as the former Discourse sheweth. For what haue they to oppose to our Elephants, Rhinocerotes, Camels, Horses, Kine, &c? Neither were the naturall fruits of America comparable to those of our World. Whence are their Spices, and best Fruits, but from hence, by transportation, or trans∣plantation? As for Arts, States, Literature, Diuine and Humane, multitudes of Cities, Lawes, and other Excellencies, our World enioyeth still the priuiledge of the First∣borne. America is a younger brother, and hath in these things almost no inheritance at all, till it bought somewhat hereof of the Spaniards, with the price of her Freedome. On the other side, for temperature of Ayre, generally America is farre before Africa, in the same height. For greatnesse of Riuers, Plata and Maragnon exceede our World. Whether Africa or America exceed in Gold, it is a question: In Siluer, Potozi seemes to haue surmounted any one Mine of the World, besides those of new Spaine, and o∣ther parts, howsoeuer Boterus doubts. Yet Exitus acta probat. And now America ex∣cells, because, besides her owne store, she is so plentifully furnished with all sorts of li∣uing and growing creatures from hence, as euen now was shewed. CHAP. III. Of the North parts of the New World (Groenland, Estotiland, Meta Incognita, and other Places) vnto New Fraunce. AMerica is commonly diuided by that Isthmus, or necke and narrow passage of Land at Darien, into two parts; the one called Northerne America, or Mexicana; the other Southerne, or Peruana. This tren∣deth betwixt the Darien and Magellan Straits: that, from thence Northwards, where the Confines are yet vnknowne. For it is not yet fully discouered, whether it ioyneth somewhere to the Continent of Asia, or whether Groenland, and some other parts, accounted Ilands, ioyne with it. These were discouered before the dayes of Columbus, and yet remaine almost couered in obscuritie, and were therefore iustly tearmed Discourse of Fro shirs voy∣ages by George Best. Voyage 3. Meta Incognita, by Great Elizabeth, the best knowne and most renowmed Ladie of the World. The first knowledge that hath come to vs of those parts, was by Nicholas and Antonie Zeni, two brethren, Ve∣netians. Happie Italie, that first, in this last Age of the World, hast discouered the great Discouerers of the World, to whome we owe our M. Paulus, Odoricus, Vertmannus, for the East; Columbus, Vespucius, Cabot, for the West; these noble Zeni for the North: and the first encompassing the Worlds wide compasse, vnto Pigafetta's Discourse, companion of Magellan in his iourney: that I speake not of the paines of Russelli, Ramusius, Boterus, and a world of Italian Authors, that (I thinke more then any other Language) haue by their historicall labours discouered the World to it selfe. Vn∣happie Italie, that still hast beaten the bush, for others to catch the Bird, and hast in∣herited nothing in these Easterne and Westerne Worlds, excepting thy Catholike clayme, whereby the Catholike and Spanish Sword makes way for the Catholike∣Romane Crowne and Keyes: Neither the Sword of Paul, nor the Keyes of Peter; for both these were 2.Cor.4. spirituall. But to returne to our Venetians. The discoue∣ries of M. Nic. & Ant. Zeni ga∣thered out of their letters by Francisco Mar∣colino. They are related by M. Hakluyt in his 3.vol part.121. In the yeare 1380 Master Nicolo Zeno being wealthie, and of a haughtie spirit, desiring to see the fashions of the World, built and furnished a Shippe at his owne charges, and passing the Straits of Gibraltar, held on his course Northwards, with intent to see England and Flanders. But a violent Tempest assayling him at Sea, hee was carried hee knew not whither, till at last his Shippe was cast away vp∣on the Isle of Frisland; where the men and most part of the goods were saued.
In vaine seemes that deliuerie, that deliuers vp presently to another Executioner. The Ilanders, like Neptunes hungrie groomes, or base and blacke gard, set vpon the men whome the Seas had spared: but here also they found a second escape, by meanes of a Prince named Zichmui, Prince of that and many Ilands thereabouts: who being neere hand with his Armie, came at the out-cry, and chasing away the people, tooke them into protection. This Zichmui had the yeare before giuen the ouerthrow to the King of Nor∣way, and was a great aduenturer in feates of Armes. He spake to them in Latine; and placed them in his Nauie, wherewith he wonne diuerse Ilands. Nicole beha∣ued himselfe so well, both in sauing the Fleet by his Sea-skill, and in conquest of the Ilands by his valour, that Zichmui made him Knight, and Captaine of his Nauie. After diuerse notable Exploits, Nicolo armed three Barkes, with which he ar∣rived in Engroneland: where he found a Monasterie of Friers, of the Preachers Order, and a Church dedicated to Saint Thomas, hard by a Hill, that casteth out fire like Vessvius and Aetna. There is a Fountaine of hot water, with which they heat the Church of the Monasterie, and the Friers chambers. It commeth also in∣to the Kitchin so boyling hote, that they vse no other fire to dresse their meat; and putting their Bread into Brasse Pots without any water, it doth bake as it were in an hote Ouen. They haue also small Gardens, which are couered ouer in the Win∣ter time, and being watered with this water, are defended from the violence of the Frost and Cold, and bring forth Flowers in their due seasons. The common people astonished with these strange effects, conceiue highly of those Friers, and bring them presents of Flesh and other things. They with this Water, in the extremitie of the Cold, heat their Chambers, which also (as the other buildings of the Monasterie) are framed of those burning stones, which the mouth of the Hill casts forth. They cast water on some of them, whereby they are dissolued, and become excellent white Lime, and so tough, that being contriued in building, it lasteth for euer. The rest, after the fire is out, serue in stead of stones to make Walls and Vaults, and will not dissolue, or breake, except with some yron toole. Their Winter lasteth nine moneths: and yet there is a faire Hauen, where this water falleth into the Sea, not frozen: by meanes whereof there is great resort of wilde Fowle and Fish, which they take in infinite multitudes. The Fishers Boates are made like to a Weauers Shuttle, of the skinnes of Fishes, fashioned with the bones of the same Fishes, and beeing sowed together with many doubles, they are so strong, that in foule weather they will shut themselues within the same, not fearing the force eyther of Sea, or Winde. Neither can the hard-hearted Rockes breake these yeelding Vessells. They haue also (as it were) a Sleeue in the bottome thereof, by which, with a subtile deuise, they conuey the wa∣ter forth, that soaketh into them. The most of these Friers spake the Latine Tongue. A little after this, Nicole returned, and died in Frisland, whither his brother Antonio had before resorted to him, and now succeeded both in his goods and honour; whome Zichmni employed in the Expedition for Estotiland: which hap∣pened vpon this occasion. Six and twentie yeares before, foure Fisher-Boates were apprehended at Sea by a mightie and tedious storme; wherewith, after many dayes, they were brought to Estotiland, aboue a thousand myles West from Frisland: vpon which, one of the Boates was cast away, and six men that were in it, were taken and brought to a populous Citie; where, one that spake Latine, and had beene cast by chaunce vpon that Iland, in the name of the King asked them what countreymen they were; and vnderstanding their case, hee acquainted the King therewith. They dwelt there fiue yeares, and found it to be an Iland very rich, beeing little lesse then Iseland, but farre more fruitfull.
One of them said saw Latine Bookes in the Kings Librarie, which they at this pre∣sent doe not vnderstand. They haue a peculiar Language, and Letters, or Characters, to themselues. They haue Mines of Gold; and other Mettalls, and haue Trade with Engroneland. They sow Corne, and make Beere and Ale. They build Barkes (but know not the vse of the Compasse) and haue many Cities and Castles. The King sent these Fishermen with twelue Barkes Southwards, to a Countrey which they call Drogio: in which Voyage escaping dreadfull Tempests at Sea, they encountred with Canniballs at Land, which deuoured many of them. These Fishers shewing them the manner of taking Fish with Nets, escaped: and for the presents which they made of their Fish to the chiefe men of the Countrey, were beloued and honoured. One of these (more expert, it seemeth, then the rest) was holden in such account, that a great Lord made warre with their Lord to obtaine him: and so preuailed, that he and his companie were sent vnto him. And in this order was he sent to fiue and twentie Lords, which had warred one with another to get him, in thirteene yeares space: whereby he came to know almost all those parts; which, he said, was a great Countrey, and (as it were) a New World. The people are all rude, and void of goodnesse: they goe naked, neither haue they wit to couer their bodies with the Beasts skinnes, which they take in Hunting, from the vehement cold. They are fierce, and eate their enemies, hauing diuerse Lawes and Gouernours. Their liuing is by Hunting. Further to the Southwest, they are more ciuill, and haue a more temperate Ayre: They haue Cities and Temples dedicated to Idols, where they sacrifice men, and after eate them; and haue also some vse of Gold and Siluer. He fledde away secretly, and conueying himselfe from one Lord to another, came at length to Drogio, where hee dwelt three yeares. After this time finding there certaine Boates of Estotiland, he went thither with them: and growing there very rich, furnished a Barke of his owne, and returned into Frisland; where hee made report vnto his Lord of that wealthie Countrey. Zichumi prepared to send thither: but three dayes before they set forth, this Fisherman died. Yet taking some of the Mariners which came with him, in his stead, they prosecuted the Voy∣age, and encountred, after many dayes, an Iland; where tenene men, of diuerse Lan∣guages, were brought vnto them, of which they could vnderstand none, but one of Iseland. He told them, That the Iland was called Icaria, and the Kings thereof called Icari, descended of the auncient pedegree of Dedalus, King of Scots: who conquering that Iland, left his sonne there for King, and left them those Lawes, which to that present they retained. And, that they might keepe their Lawes inuiolate, they would receiue no stranger. Onely they were contented to receiue one of our men, in regard of the Language, as they had done those tenne Inter∣preters. Zichumi sayling hence, in foure dayes descried Land, where they found abun∣dance of Fowle, and Birds egges, for their refreshing. The Hauen they called Cape Trin. There was a Hill, which burning, cast out smoake: where was a Spring, from which issued a certaine water like Pitch, which ranne into the Sea. The people of small stature, wilde, and fearefull, hidde themselues in Caues. Zichumi built there a Citie, and determining to inhabite, sent Antonio backe againe, with the most of his people, to Frisland. This Historie I haue thus inserted at large, which perhaps, not without cause in some things, may seeme fabulous; not in the Zeni, which thus writ, but in the re∣lations which they receiued from others. Howsoeuer, the best Geographers Abrah. Ortel. Chrt. 6.Hak. vol.3. Bero Magius. are beholden to these brethren, for that little knowledge they haue of these parts; of which, none before had written: nor since haue there beene any great in-land Discoueries. Somewhat since there hath beene discouered by Gaspar Cortereale, a Portu∣gall; Stephen Gomes, a Spaniard, and Sebastian Cabot: and more by later Pilots,
of our Nation; but little of the disposition of the In-land people. Yea, it is thought to be all broken Ilands, and not inhabited, but at certaine seasons frequented by some Sauages, which come thither to fish. Such as wee can, in due order wee here bestow. Sebastian Ramus. in praesat. in 3.Vol. Cabot, in the yeare 1497, at the charge of King Henry the seuenth, disco∣uered to the threescore and seuenth degree and a halfe of Northerly latitude, minding to haue proceeded for the search of Cathay, but by the mutinie of the Mariners was forced to returne. The Mappe of Sebastian Cabot, cut by Clem. Adams. Hak. 3.p.1.6 Clement Adams, rela∣teth, That Iohn Cabot, a Venetian, and his sonne Sebastian, set out from Bristoll, dis∣couering the Land, called it Prima Vista, and the Iland before it, S. Iohns. The in∣habitants weare Beasts skinnes. There were white Beares, and Stagges farre greater then ours. There were plentie of Seales, and Soles aboue a yard long. Hee named (sayth Peter P. Mrt Dec.3.l.6. Martyr) certaine Ilands Codfish. Baccalaos, of the store of those fish, which the inhabitants called by that name, which with their multitudes sometimes stayed his Shippes. The Beares caught these Fish with their clawes, and drew them to land, and eat them. In the time of Rob. Fabian. ap.Hak.vbi sup. H.7. (William Purchas being then Mayor of London) were brought vnto the King three men, taken in the New-found Iland: these were clothe in Beasts skinnes, and did eate raw flesh. But Cabot discouered all along the Coast to that which since is called Florida; and returning, found great prepara∣tions for Warres in Scotland, by reason whereof, no more consideration was had to this Voyage. Whereupon he went into Spaine; and being entertained by the King and Queene, was sent to discouer the Coasts of Brasil, and sayled vp into the Riuer of Plate more then six score Leagues. He was made Pilot Maior of Spaine: and after that, Anno 1549, was constituted Graund Pilot of England By King Edward the sixt, with the yearely Pension of an hundred threescore and six pounds, thirteene shillings, foure pence: Where, in the yeare 1553, he was chiefe dealer and procurer of the Discouerie of Russia, and the North-east Voyages, Sr Hugh Wil∣loughby. R. Chancelor. Stephen Burrow. Pet, and lac. written by Hugh Smith, & all in Hak. to.1. made by Sir Hugh Wil∣loughby, R. Chauncelour, Stephen Burrough, and prosecuted by Pet, Iackman, and others, towards Nou Zemla, Persia, Tartaria, as in Master Hakluyts first Tome ap∣peareth. Anno 1500 Osorius de reb. Eman l.2. Gaspar Corteregalis, a Portugall, minding new Discoueries, set forth a Shippe at his owne charge from Lisbone; and sayling farre North, at last came to a Land, which for the pleasantnesse thereof, he called Greene. The men, as he reported, were barbarous, browne-coloured, very swift, good Archers, clothed in Beasts skinnes. They liue in Caues, or base Cottages, without any Religion, but obserue Soothsayings. They vsed Marriages, and were very iealous. Returning into Portugall, hee sayled thitherward againe, Anno 1501. But what became of him, none can tell. His brother Michael Corteregalis the next yeare set forth two Shippes to make search for his brother, but he also was lost. The King Emanuel grieued herewith, sent to enquire of them, but all in vaine. Their brother Vasco would haue put himselfe on this aduenture, but the King would not suffer him. The name Greene vpon this occasion was left, and the Land was called Corterealis, or Laborador, ex∣tendeth from 60. degrees to the Riuer of S. Lawrence. G. Bot.Ben. Terra Corterega∣lis. Thus farre Osorius. It reacheth, according to Boterus reckoning, to the 60. degree. Let vs come to our owne: For of Stephen Steph.Gomes. Gomes little is left vs but a ieast. This Gomes hauing beene with Magellan a few yeares before, in his Discouerie of the South Sea, enlarged with hopes of new Straits, in the yeare 1525 set forth to search this Northerly passage. But finding nothing to his expectation, he laded his Shippe with slaues, and returned. Gaspar Es, l.2.c.25 Hist.Ind. . At his returne, one that knew his intent, was for the Moluccas by that way, enquiring what he had brought home, was told Escla∣vos, that is, Slaues. He, fore-stalled with his owne imagination, had thought it was said Clavos, and so posted to the Court to carrie first newes of this Spicie Discoue∣rie, looking for a great reward: but the truth being knowne, caused hereat great laughter.
Sir Martin Frobisher Sr Mart. Frob. deserueth the first place, as being first that in the dayes of Queene Elizabeth sought the Northwest passage in three seuerall Voyages. The first whereof was written by Christopher Christ.Hall.Dionise Settle. The Ellis. George Best. Hall; the second, by Dionise Settle; the third, by Thomas Ellis; and all in one Discourse by M. George Best: all which, at large, the Reader may finde in M. Hackluyts laborious Discouerie of Discoueries. To speake briefely what may best befit vs in our Pilgrimage: Sir Martin Frobisher sayled from Blackwall, Iune the fifteenth; and the eleuenth of Iuly 1576. had sight of Frisland, but could not get on shore for the abundance of Ice, which was also accompanied with an extreame Fogge, as double gard to that Iland (vncertaine whether to fortifie, or to imprison them.) The twentieth of Iuly he had sight of an high Land, which hee na∣med Queenes Foreland, and opposit there∣to Halls Isle, in 62. degrees, 50. min. Elizabeths Foreland. Here was he much troubled with Ice: but say∣ling more Northerly, descried another Foreland, with a great Gutte, Bay, or Passage, which he entred, calling it Frobishers Straits, supposing it to be the diuision of Asia and America. Hauing entred threescore Leagues, he went on shore, and was en∣countred with mightie Deere, which ranne at him, with danger of his life. Here had he sight of the Sauages, which rowed to his Shippe in Boates of Seales skinnes, with a Keele of Wood within them, like a Spanish Shallop, saue onely they be flat in the bottoms, and sharpe at both ends. They eate raw Flesh and Fish, or rather deuo red the same  had long blacke hayre, broad faces, flat noses, tawnie of co∣lour, or like an Oliue (which neither Sunne or Winde, but Nature it selfe, imprinted on them, as appeared by their infants; and seemeth to be the generall Liuerie of A∣merica.) Their Apparrell was Seales skinnes: their women were painted or mar∣ked downe the cheekes and about the eyes with blew streekes. These Sauages in∣tercepted fiue of our men, and the Boat: Ours also tooke one of theirs, which they brought into England, where they arriued the second of October, Gaspar. Ens, l.2.Hist. Ind. Occid. c. 26. affirmeth, that one Iohn Scolve a Polonian, this yeare 1576 sayled beyond Frisland and Grocland, and thence, to Estorland and Labrador. 1576. He had taken possession of the Countrey in right of the Queene, and commaunded his com∣panie to bring euery one somewhat, in witnesse of the same. One brought a peece of blacke Stone, like Sea-coale, which was found to hold Gold in good quantitie. Whereupon a second Voyage was made the next yeare 1577, to bring Ore. And comming to those Straits in Iuly, found them in manner shut vp with a long Mure of Ice, which sometime endangered their Shippes, especially on the nineteenth of that moneth. They found a great dead Fish, round like a Porepis, twelue foot long, hauing Such a horne was brought home two ... yeres since, found on shore in a desolate Island; & such an one was ta∣ken vp A. 1588. in the coast of Norfolke, and sold by an ig∣norant woman for 18. pence, which proued effectuall a∣gainst poisons, as I was told by M. ob. Sal∣mon of Leegh, who had a peece of it. a Horne of two yards, lacking two ynches, growing out of the Snout, wrea∣thed and streight, like a Waxe Taper, and might be thought to be a Sea-Vnicorne. It was broken in the toppe, wherein some of the Saylers said they put Spiders, which presently died. It was reserued as Iewell by the Queenes commaundement, in her Wardrobe of Robes. They went on shore, and had some encounter with the inha∣bitants, which were of so fierce and terrible resolution, that finding themselues wounded, they leapt off the Rockes into the Sea, rather then they would fall into the hands of the English. The rest fledde. One woman, with her child, they tooke and brought away. They had taken another of the Sauages before. This Sauage had before, in the Shippe, seene the Picture of his Countreyman, taken the yeare before, thought him to be aliue, and began to be offended, that hee would not an∣swere him; with wonder thinking, that our men could make men liue and die at their pleasure. But strange were the gestures and behauiour of this man and the woman, when they were brought together; which were put into the same Cab¦bin, and yet gaue such apparant signes of shamefastnesse and chastitie, be a shame to Christians to come so farre short of them. Where they could haue any Trade with the Sauages their manner of was, to lay downe somewhat of theirs, and goe then way, expecting, that men should lay downe somewhat in lieu thereof; and if they like of their Mart, they come againe, and take it: otherwise, they take away their owne, and de∣part. They made signes, that their Catchoe or King, was a man of higher sta∣ture then any of ours, and that hee was carried vpon mens shoulders
They could not learne what became of the fiue men they lost the yeare before: one∣ly they found some of their apparrell; which made them thinke they were eaten. They laded themselues with Ore, and so returned. And with fifteene sayle the next yeare 1578, a third Voyage for discouerie was made by the said Captaine and Ge∣nerall. He went on shore the twentieth of Iune on Frisland Frisland is in length 25. leagues: the Southerne part of it is in the latitude of 57. degrees, & one second. Thomas Wiars. , which was named by them West England, where they espied certaine Tents and People like those of Meta, Incognita. The people fledde, and they found in their Tents a Boxe of small Nayles, redde Herrings, and Boords of Firre-tree well cut, with other thinges artificially wrought: whereby it appeareth, that they are workemen themselues, or haue trale with others. Some of them were of opinion, That this was firme Land with Meta Incognita, or with Gronland; whereunto the multitude of Ilands of Ice, betweene that and Mea Incognita induced them. In departing from hence, the Salamander (one of their Shippes) being vnder both her Courses and Bonets, happened to strike on a great Whale with her full stemme, with such a blow, that the Shippe stood still, and neither stirred forward nor backwards. The Whale thereat made a great and hi∣deous noyse, and casting vp his bodie and tayle, presently sanke vnder water. Within two dayes they found a Whale dead, which they supposed was this which the Sala∣mander had stricken. The second of Iuly they entred in with the Straits, the entrance whereof was barred with Mountaines of Ice, wherewith Barke Dennis was sunke, to the hin∣derance of their proiects. For in it was drowned part of a house, which they had in∣tended to erect there for habitation. The men were saued. The other Shippes were in very great danger, the Seas mustering Armies of ycie souldiours to oppresse them, vsing other naturall stratagemes of Fogges and Snowes to further these cruell designes. These Icie Ilands seeme to haue beene congealed in the Winter further North, in some Bayes, It seemeth they are of fresh waters, because the ice is fresh: and the Sunne mel∣ting the tops, causeth rills of fresh water to runne downe, which meeting together, make a prettie streame. or Riuers, and with the Summers Sunne being loosed, and bro∣ken out of their naturall prisons, offer themselues to all outrages, whereto the swift Currents and cold Windes will conduct them. Strange it is to see their greatnesse, some not lesse then halfe a myle about, and fourescore fathomes aboue water, besides the vnknowne depth beneath: strange the multitude; strange the deformed shapes: if this be not more strange, that they sometimes faue with killing, and suffer men to moore their Anchors on them, and to get vpon them to worke against them, for the safegard of their Shippes: That bloudie enemies should entertaine them with dis∣ports, to walke, leape, shout, fortie myles from any Land, without any Vessell vnder them (according to M. Bests Riddle) and a hundred and tenne myles from Land should present them with running streames of fresh Waters, able to driue a Myll. The Floud was there nine houres, the Ebbe but three. A strong Current ranne West∣wards. The people resemble much the Tartars, or rather the Samoeds, in Apparrell, and manner of liuing. It is colder here in 62. then 9. or 10. degrees more Norther∣ly toward the North-east, which (it seemeth) comes to passe by the Windes, East, and North-east, which from the Ice bring so intollerable a cold. The people are excellent Archers; a thing generall throughout America. Besides Seales skinnes, they vse the skinnes of Deere, Beares, Foxes, and Hares, for Apparrell, and the ca∣ses also of Fowles sowed together. They weare in Summer the hayrie fide outward; in Winter, inward; or else goe naked. They shoot at the Fish with their darts. They kindle fire with rubbing one sticke against another. They vse great blacke Dogges, like Wolues, to draw their Sleds, and a lesse kinde to eate. They haue very thinne beards. In the best of Summer they haue Haile and Snow (sometimes a foot deepe, which freezeth as it falls) and the ground frozen three fathome deepe. They haue great store of Fowle, whereof our men killed in one day fifteene hundred. They haue thicker skinnes, and are thicker of Downe and Feathers then with vs, and therefore must be flayed. The Sunne was not absent aboue three houres and a halfe; all which space it was very light, so that they might see to write and reade.
Hence is it, that those parts neere (and perhappes vnder) the Pole are habitable: the continuance of the Sunnes presence in their Summer, heating and warming with liue∣ly cherishment all Creatures: and in the Winter, by his oblique motion, leauing so long a twi-light; and the increased light The Moone setteth not, nor the Sunne in the Polar regi∣ons; being in Cancer. of the Moone, the Sunnes great and dili∣gent Lieu-tenant, the brightnesse of the Starres and whitenesse of the snow, not suffe∣ring them to be quite forlorne in darkenesse. The beasts, fowles, and fishes, which these men kill, are their houses, bedding, meat, drinke, hose, thread, shooes, apparell, and sailes, and boats, and almost all their riches. Besides their eating all things raw, they will eate grasse and shrubbes, like our kine: and morsels of Ice, to satisfie thirst. They haue no hurtfull creeping things, but Spiders; and a kinde of Gnat is there very troublesome. Timber they haue none growing, but as the vndermining water doth supplant and bring them from other places. They are great Inchanters. When their heads ake, they tye a great stone with a string into a sticke, and with certaine words effect, that the stone with all a mans force will not be lifted vp, and sometimes seemes as light as a feather; hoping thereby to haue helpe. They made signes, lying groueling with their faces vpon the ground, making a noise downeward, that they worship the Diuell vnder them. There is no flesh or fish which they finde dead (smell it neuer so filthily) but they will eat it, without any other dressing. Their Deere haue skinnes like Asses, and feet large, like Oxen, which were measured seuen or eight inches in breadth. There are no Riuers or running Springs, but such as the Sunne causeth to come of snow. Sometimes they will perboile their meat a little, in kettles made of beasts skins, with the bloud and water which they drinke; and licke the bloudy knife with their tongues: This licking is the medicine also for their wounds. They seeme to haue traf∣ficke with other Nations: from whom they haue a small quantitie of Iron. Their fire they make of Heath and Mosse. In their leather boats they row with one oare faster, then we can in our boats with all our oares. Master Iohn Dauis The voyage of Master Da∣uis, written by Iohn Iames. Hak.to.3 p.100. in the yeare 1585. made his first voyage for this North-west Discouery, and in threescore and foure degrees, and fifteene minutes, they came on shore on an Iland, where they had sight of the Sauages, which seemed to worship the Sunne. For pointing vp to the Sunne with their hands, they would strike their breasts hard with their hands: which being answered with like action of the English, was taken for a confirmed league, and they became very familiar. They first leaped and danced with a kind of Timbrel, which they strucke with a sticke. Their apparell was of beasts and birds skinnes, buskins, hose, gloues, &c. Some leather they had which was dressed like the glouers leather. The sixt of August they discouered land in 66.40. They killed white Beares, one of whose forefeet were foureteene inches broad, so fat, that they were forced to cast it away. It seemed they fed on the grasse, by their dung, which was like to horse-dung. They heard dogges howle on the shore, which were tame: They killed one with a collar about his necke: he had a bone in his pisle; these it seemed were vsed to the sled, for they found two sleds. The next yeare he made his second voyage, wherein hee found the sauage people tractable. They are great Idolaters, and Witches. They haue many Images which they weare about them, and in their boats. They found a graue, wherein were many buried, couered with Seales skinnes, and a Crosse laid ouer them. One of them made a fire of turfes, kindled with the motion of a sticke in a peece of a boord; which had a hole halfe thorow, into which he put many things, with diuers words and strange ge∣stures: our men supposed it to be a sacrifice. They would haue had one of the English to stand in the smoke, which themselues were bidden to doe, and would not by any means; whereupon one of them was thrust in, and the fire put out by our men. They are very theeuish. They catraw fish, grasse and ice: and drinke salt water. Heere they saw a whirle-winde take vp the water in great quantitie, furiously mounting it vp into the aire, three houres together with little intermission. They found in 63. deg. 8. min. a strange quantitie of ice in one entire masse, so bigge, that they knew not the limits thereof, very high, in forme of land, with bayes and capes like high-cliffe land; they sent their Pinnesse to discouer it, which returned with information, that it was onely
ice. This was the seuenteenth of Iuly, 1586. and they coasted it till the thirtieth of Iuly. In 66. deg. 33. min. they found it very hotte, and were much troubled with a stinging Flie, called Muskito. All the Lands they saw seemed to be broken, and Ilands; which they coasted Southwards, till they were in foure and fiftie and a halfe, and there found hope of a passage. In the same voyage Henry Mor∣gan. he had sent the Sun-shine from him in 60. degr. which went to Iseland, and on the seuenth of Iuly had sight of Gronland, and were hindered from harbour by the ice. They coasted it till the last of Iuly. Their houses neere the Sea-side were made with peeces of wood, crossed ouer with poles, and couered with earth. Our men plaid at foot-ball with them of the Iland. The third voyage was performed the next yeare, 1587. wherein Master Iohn Dauis in his Hydrogra∣phical descrip∣tion. Dauis discouered to the 73. degree, finding the Sea all open, and forty leagues betweene land and land, hauing Groenland (which for the lothsome view of the shore couered with snow, without wood, earth, or grasse to be seene, and the irkesome noise of the ice he called Desolation) on the East, and America on the West. The Spanish Fleete, and the vntimely death of Master Secretary Walsingham, (the Epitome and summary of Humane worthinesse) hindered the prosecution of these intended Discoueries. Henry Hudson hath since discouered aboue nine degrees neerer the Pole, and after diuers voyages, with the losse of himselfe, by meanes of his mutinous and (as is sup∣posed) murtherous companions, which returned the last yeare, hath gained more hope of this discouery of the South-sea, by a Northerly passage, then euer before. Hesselius Hesselius Ge∣rardus. Gerardus hath (I know not by what instructions) set forth this voyage, and discouery of Hudson, now this last Mart at Amsterdam, together with a Plat or Hydrographicall Mappe of the same: affirming that he followed the way which Cap∣taine Winwood had before searched, by Lumleyes Inlet, in 61. degr. and so passed tho∣row the strait to 50. and 51. where he wintered, and once saw a man girded with a Crisse, or Dagger of Mexico, or Iapon, whereby he guessed that hee was not farre thence. After they had stayed heere eight monthes, they set saile Northwards, and found an open Sea. His Marriners perceiuing that he intended further search for dis∣couery, mutinying for victuall, put him with some others into the boat, and there left him, and returned for England. And now are men employed in hope of perfecting that, to the glory of our Nati∣on, which vndaunted spirits amongstvs with such cost and danger haue attempted. Resolute, gallant, glorious attempts, which thus seeke to tame Nature, where shee is most vnbridled, in those Northeasterly, Northwesterly, and Northerly borders (where she shewes her selfe a As Borderers are most vnru∣ly and lawlesse, so in these out∣borders of the world, the power of Na∣tures greatest officers, the Sunne &c. is least seene. borderer indeed) and to subdue her to that Gouernment and Subiection, which GOD ouer all blessed for euer, hath imposed on all sensible Crea∣tures to the Nature of man; resembling in one Image and abridgement, both GOD and the World, consisting of a spirituall and bodily, visible and inuisible bsistence. How shall I admire your valour and courage, yee Marine Worthies, beyond all names of worthinesse, that neither dread so long, either presence or absence of the Sunne, nor those foggie mists, tempestuous windes, cold blasts, snowes and haile in the aire: nor the vnequall Seas, which might amaze the hearer, and amate the beholder, where the Tritons and Neptunes selfe would quake with chilling feare, to behold such monstrous Icie Ilands, renting themselues with terror of their owne massines, and disdaining o∣therwise, both the Seas soueraignety, and the Sunnes hottest violence, mustering them∣selues in those watery plaines, where they hold a continuall ciuill warre, and rushing one vpon another, make windes and waues giue backe, seeming to rent the eares of others, while they rent themselues with crashing and splitting their congealed ar∣mours: nor the rigid ragged face of the broken lands, sometimes towring themselues in a loftie height, to see if they can finde refuge from those snowes and colds that con∣tinually beat them, sometimes hiding themselues vnder some hollow hills or cliffes, sometimes sinking and shrinking into valleyes, looking pale with snowes, and falling in frozen and dead swounes: These thing agree with the relations of those parts, which tell of Earth-quakes, breaking of cliffes, &c. sometimes breaking their neckes into the Sea, rather embracing the waters, then the aires crueltie; and otherwhile with horrible Earth∣quakes, in heat of Indignation shaking asunder, to shake off this cold and hea.
Great GOD, to whom all names of greatnesse are little, and lesse then nothing, let me in silence admire and worship thy greatnesse, that in this little heart of man (not able to serue a Kite for a break-fast) hast placed such greatnes of spirit, as the world is too little to fill; onely thy selfe the prototype and samplar of this modell, canst of thine owne selfe, becomming all in all vnto vs, fill and more then satisfie. Thee I beseech, to pro∣sper in this and like attempts, this Nation of ours, that as in greater light then to o∣thers, thou hast giuen vs thy SONNF, the Sunne of right consnesse: so with him thou wilt giue all things, euen among other blessings, that thy Virgin TRVTH, by Virgi∣nian Plantation, or Northerly Discouery, may triumph in her conquests of Indian In∣fidels, maugre the bragges of that Adulteresse, that vaunteth Boterus a zea∣lous and slan∣derous Catho∣like, vseth these disgracefull speeches of this Discouery.

Of Newfound-Land, Noua Francia, Arambec, and other Countries of America, extending to Virginia. LEauing those vnknowne and frozen Lands and Seas, (although there is yet knowne no frozen The Nor∣therne seas may be called frozen, in re∣spect o the icy Ilands, which by their fresh∣nesse manifest themselues to proceed of fresh waters: no experience yet shewing, nor reason cō∣uincing, that the Ocean (al∣way salt and mouing) is any where frozen: as my learned friend Master Brigges (a great Mathematitiā) also affirmeth. Sea, otherwise then as you haue heard) let vs draw somewhat nearer the Sunne, gently marching, as the situation of Regions shal direct vs, left if we should suddenly leape from one extre∣mity to another, we should rather exchange then auoid danger. And heere we haue by Land Saguenay, and many Countries of Canada, which the French haue stiled by a new name of New France: and by Sea the Ilands many in number, and much frequented for their plenty of fish, commonly called New-found-Land, which name some ascribe to an Isle, others to diuers Iland, and broken Lands which the French call Bacaldos, vpon the gulfe and entrance of the great Riuer called Saint Laurence, in Canada. This Riuer some Edw. Hoics. Hak to. 3 p. 152. call the Strait of the three brethren; some Gi. Bot. Ben. Saint Laurence, and others Iaq. Car. lib. 2. cap. 11. Canada. It farre exceedeth any Riuer of the elder World. It beginneth, saith Iaques Cartier, beyond the Iland of As∣sumption, ouer-against the high mountaines of Honhuedo, and of the seuen Ilands. The distance from one side to another, is about fiue and thirty or forty leagues. In the middest it is aboue Other say two hundred. two hundred fathome deepe. There are great store of Whales and Sea-horses. From the entrance vp to Hochelaga is three hundred leagues. Many Ilands are before it, offering of their good nature to bee mediatours betweene this haughty streame and the angry Ocean: many others all alongst his passage he holdeth in his louing vnlouely lappe, washing and hugging them with his ruder embracings. The former are vsually frequented, and were first discouered by the English, the other by the French. Of Sebastian Cabot his proceeding this way is spoken alreadie. Robert Thorne Rob. Thorne in Master Hak∣luits Voyages, To. I. pag. 219. in a Treatise of his, affirmeth that his father, and one Master Eliot were the Discouerers of the New-found-Lands: & exhorted K. Henry to vndertake the search of the Indies by the Pole, which he held to be Nauigable. Vpon this motion, 1527. the King sent two shippes (as Hall and Master Hall, Master Grafton. Grafton mention in their Chronicles) one of which shippes was cast away about the North-parts of New-found-Land, the o∣ther shaping her course towards Cape Briton, and the coasts of Arambec (or as some call it Norumbega) returned home. More tragicall was the successe Master Hore, 1530. Hak. tom. 3. pag. 129. of Master Hores company, which set out nine years after in this Discouery, but by famine were brought to such extremities, that many of the company were murthered and eaten by their fellowes. And those which returned were so altered, that Sir William Buts a Norfolke Knight, and his Lady, knew not their sonne Master Thomas Buts, one of this starued number, but by a secret marke, namely a wart, which Nature had sealed on one of his knees. The commodities and qualities of New-found-Land, are related A. Parkhurst. Edw. Haies, S. G. Peckham. Step. Parmenius. Richard Clarke. Christoph. Cartile. by Master Parkhurst, Master Haies, Sir George Peckham, Stephen Parmenius, Richard Clarke, Master Christopher Cartile, all whose Discourses and experiments hereof, Master
Hakluit hath collected and bestowed on the World. The North-part is inhabited, the South is desert, although fitter for habitation. Besides the abundance of Cod, heere are Herrings, Salmons, Thornbacke, Oisters and Muskies, with Pearles, Smelts and Squids, which two sorts come on shore in great abundance, fleeing from the deuou∣ring Cod, out of the frying-pan into the fire. It is thonght that there are Buffes, and certaine, that there are Beares and Foxes, which before your face will robbe you of your fish or flesh. Before they come at New-found-Land by fiftie leagues, they passe the banke: so they call certaine high grounds, as a vaine of Mountaines, raising them∣selues vnder the water, about ten leagues in breadth, extending to the South infinitly, on which is thirty fathome water, before and after two hundred. Sir Humfrey Gilbert tooke possession thereof, by vertue of her Maiesties Commission. Anno 1583. It is with-in-land a goodly Countrey, naturally beautified with Roses sowen with Pease, planted with stately trees, & otherwise diuersified both for pleasure & profit. And now the report goeth, that our English Nation doe there plant and fixe a setled habitation. Neere to New-found land in 47deg. is great killing of the Morse or Sea-oxe. Thom. lames. In the Ile of Ramea, one small French shippe in a small time killed 500. of them. They are great as Oxen, the hide dressed, is twice as thicke as a Bulls hide: It hath two teeth like Elephants, but shorter, about a foot long, dearer sold then Iuory, and by some re∣puted an Antidote, not inferiour to the Vnicornes horne. The yong ones are as good meat as Veale. And with the bellies of fiue of the said fishes (if so we may cal these Am∣phibia, which liue both on land and water) they make a Hogshead of traine oile. Some of our English ships haue attempted this enterprise for the killing of the Morse, but not all with like succeese; nor with so good as is reported of Cherry Iland. At Brions Iland is such abundance of Cods, that Master Charies Leigh. Leighs company with foure hookes in little more then an howre, caught two hundred and fifty of them. Neere to the same in the gulfe of Saint Laurence, are three, termed the Ilands of Birds the soile is sandy red, but by reason of many birds on thē, they looke white. The birds sit as thick, as stones lie in a paued street: or to vse Iaques Iaq. Cart. 1. Cartier's comparison, as any field or medow is of grasse. Two of these Ilands are steepe and vpright as any wall, that it is not possible to climbe them. On the other which is in 49. deg. 40. min. and about a league in circuit, they killed, and filled two boats In an houre they might haue filled thirtie boats of Margaulx or Penguins: and might haue la∣den all their shippes with them, without any misse. in lesse then half an houre. Besides them which they did eat fresh, euery ship did powder fiue or six barrels of them. There are an hundred fold as many houering about, as within the Iland. Some are as big as Iayes, black & white, with beakes like vnto crowes: their wings are no bigger then halfe ones hand, and therefore they cannot flie high, yet are they as swift neere the water, as other birds. They are very fat: these they called Aponatz, a lesler kinde which there aboundeth, they named Godetz: A bigger, and white, which bite like dogges, they termed Mar∣gaulx. Although it be fourteene leagues from the maine, yet Beares swimme thither to feast with these birds. One they saw as great as a Cow, saith Cartier, and as white as a Swanne, which they did kill and eat, and the flesh was as good as of a two-yeare-old Calfe. About the Port of Brest, they found as many Islets, as were impossible to num∣ber, continuing a great space. The Iland of Assumption, Siluest Wyet. by the Sauages called Natiscote, standeth in 49. deg. The sauages dwell in houses made of fir-trees, bound together in the top, and set round like a Doue-house. This, as before is said, is at the entry of the Riuer into the gulfe of Saint Lawrence. The bankes of this Riuer are inhabited of people that worship the Di∣uell, & sometimes sacrifice to him their owne bloud. Botero part I. lib. 5. Francis the first, King of France, sent thither Iames Berton; and Henry his sonne, Nicolas Villagnon: but the greatest ri∣ches they found, were the Diamonds of Canada, and those of small value for their brit∣tlenes. Thus Boterus. Iaques Iaq. Cart. 1. Cartier made three voyages into these parts. First in the yeare 1534. Then was he gladly welcomed of the Sauages, singing, dancing, and ex∣pressing other signes of ioy, as rubbing his armes with their hands, and then lifting him vp to heauen, giuing all to their naked skinne (though all were worse then no∣thing) for the trifles hee gaue them. They went naked, sauing their priuities which were couered with a skinne, and certaine old skinnes they cast vpon them, Some
they saw, whose heads were altogether shauen, except one bush of haire which they offer to grow vpon the top of their crowne, as long as a horse taile, and tied vp with leather-strings in a knot. They haue no dwelling but their boats, which they turne vp∣side downe, and vnder them lay themselues along on the bare ground. They eat their flesh and fish almost raw, only a little heated on the coales. The next yeare Captaine Iaq. Car. 2. Cartier returned, and carried backe two Sauages, which he before had carried into France to learne the language. Hee then passed vp to Hochelaga He wintered this time in the Countrey. They found Rats which liued in the water, as big as Conies, and were very good meat. Hochelaga is a City round, compassed about with timber, with three course of Rampiers one within another, framed sharpe, about two rods high. It hath but one gate, which is shut with piles and barres. There are in it about fifty great houses, and in the middest of euery one a court, in the middle whereof they make their fire. Before they came there, they were forced to leaue their boats behinde, because of certaine falls, and heard that there were three more higher vp the streame, towards Sanguenay, which in his Iaq. Car. 3. third Voyage were discouered. Concerning the Religion in these parts of Canada, euen amongst the Sauages we finde some tracts and foot-prints therof, which neither the dreadful winters haue quite frozen to death, nor these great and deep waters haue wholly drowned, but that some shadow thereof appeareth in these shadowes of men, howsoeuer wilde and sauage, like to them which giue her entertainment. This people beleeueth, saith Iaques Iaq. Car. 2. Cap, 10. Cartier, in one which they call Cudruaigni, who, say they, often speaks to them, & tele them what weather will follow, whether good or bad. Moreouer, when he is angry with them, he casts dust into their eies. They beleeue that when they die, they goe into the Stars, and thence by little and little descend downe into the Horizon, euen as the Stars doe, after which they go into certaine greene fields, full of goodly faire and precious trees, flow∣ers and fruits. The French-men told them Cudruaigni was a diuell, & acquainted them with some mysteries of the Christian Religion, wherupon they condescended and de∣sired Baptisme; the French excused, & promised after to bring Priests for that purpose. They liue in common together, and of such commodities as their Countrey yeeldeth they are well stored. They wed two or three wiues a man, which, their husbands being dead, neuer marry againe, but for their widowes liuery weare a blacke weed all the daies of their life, besmearing their faces with cole-dust & grease mingled together, as thicke as the backe of a knife. They haue a filthy and detestable vse in marrying their maidens, first putting them (being once of lawfull age to marry) in a common place, as harlots, free for euery man that will haue to do with them, vntil such time as they finde a match. I haue seene houses as full of such prostitutes, as the schooles in France are full of children. They there vse much mis-rule, riot, and wantonnesse. They dig their ground with certaine peeces of wood, as big as halfe a sword, where they sow their Maiz. The men also doe much vse Tobacco. The women labour more then the men in fishing and husbandry. They are more hardy then the beasts, & would come to our ships starke naked, going vpon snow and ice, in which season they take great store of beasts, Stags, Beares, Marterns, Hares and Foxes, whose flesh they eate raw, hauing first dried it in the Sunne or smoke, and so they doe their fish. They haue also Otters, Weasils, Beauers, Badgers, Conies: fowle and fish great varietie: and one fish, called Adhothuis, whose body & head is like to a Greyhound, white as snow. Their greatest iewell is chaines of Esurgny, which are shel-fishes, exceeding white, which they take on this manner. When a captiue or other man is condemned to death, they kill him, and then cut flashes in his most fleshy parts, and hurle him into the Riuer Cor∣nibots, whence after twelue houres they draw him, finding in those cuts these Esurg∣ny, whereof they make beades and chaines. They are excellent for stanching of bloud. Thus much out of Cartier. In the yeare 1542. M. Franci Roberual. Monsieur Roberual was sent to inha∣bit those parts. He saith that he built a Fort faire and strong: the people haue no cer∣taine dwelling place, but goe from place to place, as they may finde best food, carry∣ing all their goods with them. It is more cold in that, then in other places of like height, as Iohn Alphonse of
Xanctoigne Iohn Alphuse of Xanctoigne. Hakluit tom. 3. affirmeth, because of the greatnes of the Riuer which is fresh water, and because the land is vntilled and full of woods. We may adde the cold vapours which the Sunne exhaleth in that long passage ouer the Ocean, the abundance of ice that commeth out of the North-seas, and the windes which blow from them, and from the cold snowie hills in the way. Monsieur M. Champlcin in Na Fran∣cia. lib. 2. cay 5. Champlein hauing of late made the same voyage, discoursed with cer∣taine Sauages yet liuing, of whom he learned touching their Religion, that they be∣leeue in one GOD, who hath created all things: that after GOD had made all things, he tooke a number of arrowes, and did sticke them into the ground, from whence men and women sprung vp, which haue multiplied euer since. Touching the Trinitie, being asked, a Sagamos or Gouernor answered, The answere of a Sagamos in cases of Reli∣gion. There was one only GOD, one SONNI, one Mother, and the Sunne, which were foure. Notwithstanding, This some∣what agreeth with the Ma∣nichean and Pythagorcan errour. that GOD was ouer and aboue all: the SONNE was good, and the Sunne also: but the Mother was naught and did eat them, and that the FATHER was not very good. Being asked, if they or their ancestors had heard that GOD was come into the world: He said that he had not seene him; but that anciently there wer fiue men, who trauelling toward the setting of the Sunne, met with GOD, who demanded of them, whither goe yee? They an∣swered, we goe to seeke for our liuing. GOD said, You shall finde it heere: But they not regarding, passed further: and then GOD with a stone touched two of them, who were turned into stones. And he said a gaine to the three other, whither go ye? they an∣swered, and he replied as at first: they yet passing further, he tooke two staues, and tou∣ched therewith the two formost, and transformed them into staues. Asking the third man whither he went, he said to seeke his liuing: whereupon he bad him tarry, and he did so, and GOD gaue him meat, and he did eat: and after he had made good cheare, he returned among the other Sauages, and told them all this tale. This Sagamos also told, that at another time there was a man which had store of Tabacco, and GOD came and asked him for his pipe, which the man gaue him, and he dranke much of it, and then brake the pipe. The man was offended hereat, beleeue he had no more pipes, but GOD gaue him one, and bad him carry it to his Sagamos, with warning to keepe it well, and then he should want nothing, nor any of his. Since, the said Sagamos lost the pipe, and found famine and other distresse: this seemeth to be the cause, why they say GOD is not very good. Being demanded what ceremony they vsed in praying to their God, he said that they vsed no ceremony, but euery one did pray in his heart, as he would. They haue among them some Sauages, whom they call Pilotoua, who speake visibly to the Diuell, and he tells them what they must doe, as well for warre, as for other things. And if he should command them to put any enterprise in execution, or to kill a man, they would doe it immediately. They because also that all their dreames are true. So farre Champlein. In the yeare 1604. Monsieur de Monts (according to a Patent granted him the yeare before, for the inhabiting of Cadia, Canada, and other parts of New France, from the fortieth degree to the six and fortieth) rigged two shippes, and bare with those parts that trend Westward from Cape Breton, giuing names to places at pleasure, or vpon occasion. One port was named Saualet of a French Captaine, who was there a fish∣ing, and had made this his two and fortieth Voyage hither: another was named of Ros∣signol, whose shippe was confiscated for trading there with the Sauages (a poore pre∣ferment, to leaue name to a Port by his misery) another was named Port Moutton, and within a great Bay, they named another Port-Royal, where after they fortified. The in∣habitants of these parts were termed Souriquois. From them Westward are the people called Etechemins, where the next port, after you are passed the Riuer of S. Iohn, is Saint Croix, where they erected a Fort, and wintered. Threescore leagues West from thence is the Riuer Kimbekt: and from thence the Land trendeth North and South to Mala∣barre. Authors place in that former extension of land betwixt East and West, a great Towne and faire Riuer, called Norombega, by the Sauages called Agguncia. These French Discouerers vtterly deny this History, affirming that there are but Cabans here and there made with perkes, and couered with barkes of trees, or with skins: and both
the Riuer and inhabited place is called Pomtegoet, and not Agg. And there car be no great Riuer (as they affirme) because the great Riuer Canada hath (like an insa∣tiable Merchant) engrossed all these water-commodities, so that other streames are in manner but meere pedlers. The Armouchiquois are a traiterous and theeuish people, next vnneighboutly neigh∣bours to the Etechemms: they are light-footed and lime fingred, as swift in running away with their stollen prey, as the Grey-hound in pursuing it. Monsieur du Point arriued in those parts in the yeare 1605. and du Mont remoued the French habita∣tion to Port Royall. Monsieur de Poutrincourt sailed thither in the yeare 1606. and with him the Author of the booke called Noua Francia, who hath written of the rites and customes of these Countries. He saith, that the Armouchiquoit are a great people, but haue no adoration. They are vicious and bloudie. Both they and the Souriquois haue the industrie of painting and caruing, and doe make pictures of Birds, Beasts, and Men, both in stone and wood, as well as the workemen in these parts. They, as is said, ascribe not diuine worship to any thing: but yet acknowledge some spirituall and inuisible power. I know not by what diuine iustice, and iniustice of the Deuill, it comes to passe, that God hath giuen some men vp so farre vnto the Deuills tyrannie, that he hath banished out of their hearts the knowledge and worship of the true God: and yet the nature of man cannot be without apprehension of some greater, and more excellent Nature, and rather then want all Religion, they will haue a Religious-irreli∣gious commerce with the Deuill. Yea, the more all knowledge of God is banished, the baser seruice doe men, in doing and suffering, yeeld to the Deuill: as (to leaue o∣ther parts to their owne places) it falleth out in these Regions. The Prince and greatest Commander of men among them, seemes by this meanes to bee the Deuills Vicegerent, and by wisardly and deuillish practises to vp-hold his owne greatnesse. So it was with Sagamos Memberton: if any body were sick he was sent for, hee made inuocations on the Deuill, he bloweth vpon the partie grieued, maketh incision, suc∣keth the bloud from it: (a practise vsed in very many Countries of the Continent and Ilands of America) if it be a wound he healeth it after the same manner, applying a round slice of Beauers stones. Some present is therefore made to him, of Venison or skinnes. If it be a question to haue newes of things absent, hauing first questioned with his spirit, he rendreth his Oracle, commonly doubtfull, very often false, and sometimes true. He rendred a true Oracle of the comming of Poutrincourt to du Pont, saying, his Deuill had told him so. When the Sauages are hungrie, they consult with Memberton's Oracle, and hee telleth them the place whither they shall goe: and if there be no game found, the ex∣cuse is, that the beast hath wandered and changed place: but very often they finde. And his makes them beleeue that the Deuill is a God, and know none other, al∣though they yeeld him no adoration. When these Aoutmoin's (so they call these Wisards) consult with the Deuill, they fixe a staffe in a pit, to which they tie a cord, and, putting their head into the pit, make inuocations or coniurations, in a language vnknowne to the others that are about, and this with beatings and howlings vntill they sweat with paine. When this Deuill is come, the Master Aoutmoin makes them beleeue that he holds him tied by his cord, and holdeth fast against him, forcing him to giue him an answere, before hee let him goe. That done, hee beginneth to sing something in the praises (as it seemeth) of the Deuill, that hath discouered some game vnto them, and the other Sauages that are there make answere with some concor∣dance of musike among them. Then they dance with songs in another, not vulgar, language: after which, they make a fire and leape ouer it, and put halfe a pole out of the top of the Cabin, where they are with some thing tyed thereto, which the Deuill carrieth away. Memberton carried at his necke the marke of his profession, which was a purse, trianglewise couered with their imbrodered worke, within which there was some∣what as bigge as a Nut, which he said was his Deuill, called Aoutem. This function
is successiue, and by tradition they teach their eldest sonnes the mysterie of this iniqui∣tie. Euery Sagamos sig∣nifieth a King, or Ruler. Sagamos either is, or hath his Aoutmoin. The men and women weare their black haire long, hanging loose ouer the shoul∣der, wherein the men stick a feather, the women a bodkin. They are much troubled with a stinging flie, for preuention where  they rubbe themselues with certaine kinds of grease and oiles. They paint their faces with blew or red, but not their bodies. For their marriages, they are contracted with the consent of Parents, who will not giue their Daughters in marriage to any, except he be a good hunter. The women are said to be chast, and the contrarie seldome found: and though the husband hath ma∣ny wiues, yet is there no iealousie among them. The widowes here, if their husbands be killed, will not marrie againe, nor eate flesh, till their death bee reuenged. Other∣wise they make no great difficultie (which Cartier reporteth of Canada) to marrie a∣gaine if they finde a fit match. Sometimes the Sauages hauing many wiues will giue one to their friend, if he likes her, so to disburthen themselues. The women eate not with the men in their meetings, but a-part. When they make feasts they end them with dances all in a round, to which one singeth; at the end of euery song all make a lowd and long exclamation: And to bee the more nimble, they strip themselues starke naked. If they haue any of their enemies heads or armes, they will carrie them (as a iewell) about their necks whiles they dance, sometimes biting the same. After their feasts they will diet themselues, liuing sometimes eight daies more or lesse with the smoke of Tabacco. They are in nothing laborious but in hunting. They sow but so much as will serue them for six moneths, and that very hardly: during the Winter they retire, three or foure moneths space, into the woods, and there liue on A∣cornes, Fish, and Venison, They wash not themselues at meales, except they be mon∣strous foule, and then wipe on their owne or their dogges haires. Their entertaine∣ment is with small complement: the guest sits downe by his Host, if it bee the King, takes Tabacco, and then giues the pipe to him that he thinkes the worthiest person in the companie. They are dutifull to their Parents, obey their commandements, and nourish their persons in age. They vse humanitie to the wiues and children of their conquered enemies, but the men of defence they kill. Their chiefe hunting is in win∣ter; they carrie alwaies tinder-boxes with them, to strike fire when hunting is done, or night takes them. For they follow the game sometimes three daies together. Their Dogges are like Foxes, which spend not, neuer giue ouer, and haue rackets tyed vnder their feet, the better to runne on the snow. They seeth the flesh in a tubbe of wood, by putting stones heated red hot therein. The womens dutie is to flay the beast and bring it home. The Ellan Doare, Stagge, and Beare, are their game. They take also with their hands Bevers, which are of a chest-nut colour, short legged, his forefeet haue open clawes, the hinder, finnes like a Goose, the tayle skaled, almost of the forme of a Sole-fish: it is the delicatest part of the beast. The head is short and round, with two rankes of iawes at the sides; and before, foure great teeth (two a∣boue and two beneath) with which he cuts downe small trees. He builds on the brinks of a Lake, cuts his wood, there with raiseth a Vault; and because the waters sometimes rise, he hath an vpper storie to betake himselfe to in such case: he builds it Pyramide∣wise, sometimes eight foot high, and daubes it with mud. Hee keepes his taile still in the water. They take him with their hands in a frost, one fraying him on the Ice, whiles an other seizeth on his neck. When one dies, they mourne for him long, euery cabin his day by course: after that, they burne all his goods, and burie the body in a graue: where when they haue placed him, euery one maketh a present of the best thing hee hath: as skinnes to couer him, bowes, kniues, or the like. The Scuruie or Scorbuch much consumed the French in these parts, a disease that vsually attendeth euill diet, and much salt meates; which, and want of exercise con∣uenient, are the harbengers of this sicknesse, Ol. Mag.l.16. cap.51. in long sieges and nauigations. Cartiers company were in a little time wonderfully cured hereof by a Tree like to Sassafras.
CHAP. V. Of VIRGINIA. LEauing New France, let vs draw nearer the Sunne to New Bri∣taine, whose Virgin soile not yet polluted with Spaniards lust, by our late Virgin-Mother, was iustly called Virginia. Whe∣ther shall I here beginne with Elogies or Elegies? Whether shall I warble sweet Carolls in praise of thy louely Face, thou fairest of Virgins, which from our other Britaine-World, hath wonne thee Wooers and Suters, not such as Leander, whose loues the Poets haue blazed for swimming ouer the Straits betwixt Sestos and Abydus, to his louely Hero; but, which for thy sake haue for-saken their Mother-earth, en∣countered the most tempestuous forces of the Aire, and so often ploughed vp Nep∣tunes Plaines, furrowing the angrie Ocean, and that to make thee of a ruder Vir∣gin, not a wanton Minion; but, an honest and Christian Wife? Or shall I change my accent, and plaine mee (for I know not of whom, to whom, to complaine) of those disaduentures, which these thy louely Louers haue sustayned in secking thy loue? What enuie, I know not, whether of Nature, willing to reserue this Nymph for the treasurie of her owne loue, testified by the many and continuall presents of a temperate Clymate, fruitfull Soile, fresh and faire Streames, sweet and holsome Aire, except neare the shore (as if her iealous policie had prohibited forraine Suters:) or of the sauage Inhabitants, vnworthie to embrace with their rustike armes so sweet a bosome, and to appropriate with greatest disparagement so faire a Virgin to Sauage Loues: or haply some conceiued indignitie, that some Parents should thither send their most vnruly Sonnes, and that our Britannia should make her Virginian lap to bee the voider, for her lewder and more disordered Inhabitants, whose ill parts haue made distastfull those kinder Offices of other our Britan Worthies, which else had beene long since with greatest gladnesse, and the recompense of her selfe entertay∣ned: Or whether it bee Virginian modestie, and after the vse of Virgins, shee would say nay at first, holding that loue surest in continuance, which is hardest in obtay∣ning: Whether any, or all of these, or what else hath hindered; hindered wee haue beene, and haue not yet obtay∣ned the full fruition of her Loue, and possession of her gainefull Dowrie, which yet now (more then euer before) shee seemeth to promise, and doubtlesse will quickly performe, if niggardise at home doe not hinder. And should men bee niggardly in this aduenture, where Nabal must needes verifie his name, where keeping looseth, aduenturing promiseth so faire a purchase? Miserie of our times, that miserable men should here want what they alreadie haue, and refuse to haue there, at no rate, abundant supply to their too miserable feares of want. Lift vp your eyes and see that brightnesse of Virginia's beautie: which the Mountaines lift vp themselues alwayes with wilde smiles to behold, sending downe siluer streames to salute her, which powre themselues greedily into her louely lap, and after many winding embracements, loth to depart, are at last swallowed of a more mightie cor∣riuall, the Ocean: Hee also sends Armies of Fishes to her coasts, to winne her Loue, euen of his best store, and that in store and abundance: the Mountaines out-bid the Ocean, in offering the secret store-houses of vndoubted mines: hee againe offereth pearles: and thus while they seeke to out-face each other with their puffed and bigge swollen cheekes, who shall get the Bride, the one laies hold on the Continent and de∣taines the same, maugre the Oceans furie, and hee againe hath gotten the Ilands all a∣long the coast, which he guardeth and keepeth with his waterie Garrisons. Virginia, betwixt these two sower-faced Suters, is almost distracted, and easily would giue en∣tertainement to English loue, and accept a New Britan appellation, if her Husband
be but furnished out at first in sorts and sutes, befitting her marriage solemnitie: all which her rich Dowrie would maintayne for euer after with aduantage. And well may England ourt her, rather then any other Europaean Louers, in re∣gard of his long continued amitie, and first discouerie of her Lands and Seas: this by Sebastian Cabot with his English Mariners, a hundred and fifteene yeares since, and the other by Sir Walter Raleighs charge and direction, Anno Domini one thousand fiue hundred fourescore and foure. Then, first of all Christians, did Master Philip Amadas, and Master Arthur Barlow, take possession in Queene Elizabeths name. The next yeare, that mirrour of Resolu∣tion, Hak. voiag. tom.3. pag.246. & d. Gaspar. Eus. hist. Ind. oc.l.3.c.23. Theodor. de Bry. Sir Richard Greenvile, conuaied thither an English Colonie, which hee there left for plantation, vnder the gouernement of Master Ralphe Lane, which there con∣tinued vntill the eighteenth of Iune in the yeare following, and then (vpon some vr∣gent occasions) returned with Sir Francis Drake into England. Yet, had they staied but a little longer, a ship of Sir Walter Raleighs had supplyed their necessities: and soone after Sir Richard againe repayred thither with three ships, and then also left fifteene men more to keepe possession. In the yeare 1587. a second Colonie were sent vnder the gouernement of Master Iohn White. To their succour Sir Walter Ra∣leigh hath sent fiue seuerall times, the last Briefe Note of a Barke, &c. printed 1602. by Samuel Mace of Weymouth, in March one thousand six hundred and two, but hee and the former performed nothing, but returned with friuolous allegations. The same yeare, Captaine Bartholomew Gos∣nold, and Captaine Gilbert, discouecred the North parts of Virginia, of which voyage Iohn Brereton Iohn Brere∣ton. hath written a Treatise. And in the yeare one thousand six hundred and fiue, Captaine George Waymouth made thither a prosperous voyage, and discoue∣red threescore miles vp a most excellent Riuer. His voyage was set forth-in print by Iames Iames Rosier. Rosier. After this followed the plantation by the present Aduenturers, in the yeare one thousand six hundred and six Relat. Cap. Smith. M.S. & W.S. M.S. , at which time a hundreth of our men were left there for the foundation of a New Britanian Common-wealth: and the East and West parts of England ioyned in one purpose of a two-fold plantation, in the North and South parts of Virginia. True it is, that some emulations did euen then becloude that morning Starre, and some disastrous Comets did arise in that Hemisphaere, in place of better Starres, shi∣ning rather with combustion in ciuill broiles, and bralls, then comfortable illumi∣nation and influence to the common good: these disorders were attended with idle∣nesse of the most, sicknesse of many, and some dyed. A cleare skie did afterwards appeare in their agreement on the choise of Captaine Smith for their President, who hauing before fallen into the hands of the Virginians, had beene presented Prisoner to Powhatan, where hee tooke aduantage by that disaduantage, to acquaint himselfe with the State and condition of the Countrie and Inhabitants. The Sauages were now in good termes with the English, their plantation at Iames Towne where they had built a Church and many Houses, in some reasonable manner flourished; the Countrie was with great paines and perills of the President further discouered; their Swine, Hennes, and other prouision, nourished; and some quanti∣tie of many commodities, as Furres, Dies, Mineralls, Sassafrasse, Sturgeon, and o∣ther thinges sent hither, in testimonie of their industrie and successe. And (not to mention other supplies,) Virginia grew now in such request New life of Virginia. , that nine Ships were furnished with the better part of fiue hundred men, to inhabite there, in the yeare one thousand six hundred and nine. Sir Thomas Gates was appointed Lieutenant Generall; Sir George Sommers Ad∣mirall of Virginia, and were sent to reside there as Gouernours of the Colonie. But the Sea Venture, wherein the two Knights, and Captaine Newport, with a hundred and fiftie persons sayled, after long conflict with the two angrie Elements, was sent to be imprisoned in Bermuda, where betweene two Rocks the Ship split, the people escaping to Land. In the meane time Man Script. W..ex. lit. maol. torum. the other three ships had landed their men
in Virginia, some of whom were such as had beene the emulous and enuious corri∣ualls of the President, which they then beganne to shew: and to second the same, a greater hurt by gunne-powder befell him, which forced him for his recouerie to set sayle for England, after he had liued there three yeares, maintayning himselfe and his that time principally, with such foode as the Countrie yeelded. Hee saith, he left be∣hinde at his returne fiue hundred men and women, three ships, seuen boats, two hun∣dred expert Souldiers, thirtie nine of their Weroances or Kings as Subiects and contri∣buters to the English, so farre subiect, that at his command they haue sent their sub∣iects to Iames Towne, to receiue correction at his appointment for wrongs done; and their Countries were free to the English for trauell or trade. But necessitie forced him to leaue the Countrie, which it forced the other appointed Gouernours not to finde. Hine illae lachrymae. Hence proceeded the disorder and confusion which after hapned amongst them. A great body was here, which acknowledged no head, and there∣fore grew vnweldie and distempered. Some sought for rule ouer others, which were ouer-ruled by vnruly passions of Ambition, and faction in themselues: others sought their ease, except sometimes they were ouer-busie in diseasing others, and deuou∣ring that which others had carefully laboured for: Ruine seiseth on the Church, Ra∣pine makes prey and spoile of the goods; Rauine deuoureth their beasts; Famine consumeth the men; Iniuries make the Indians their enemies; two of the ships pe∣rish vpon Vshant, and one man alone was left to bring home newes of their perish∣ing: the rest returne laden with letters of discouragement, painting our Famine, Se∣dition, and other Furies, which had broken loose amongst them, in the blackest co∣lours: which were sealed with report of the losse of their Admirall, to make vp the measure of mischiefe. All this did not daunt the Noble spirit of Lord de la Warre. that Resolute Lord, appointed Lord Gouernour, who in the beginning of Aprill one thousand six hundred and ten, set sayle from the coast of England, and on the ninth of Iune arriued safely at the disfor∣tified Fort in Virginia, where hee found the present State like to the Boxe Nat. Com. Mytholog.l.4.c.6 of Pan∣dora, which Epimetheus had opened, and suffered all euill to flie out, reseruing only Hope, which he shut fast in the bottome. All euills had now dispersed themselues, and made the Virginian Colonie a stage of Miserie: only Hope remained. But alas euen that also proued sick, and was readie to giue vp the Ghost, in the dangerous sicknesse, which befell that Noble Relation to the Councell of Virginia by the Lord de la Warre. 1611. Lord, which forced him after eight Moneths sicknesse, to returne for England againe. Hee shipped himselfe indeede for Meuis, an Iland in the West Indies, famous for whol∣some Bathes, but by Southerly windes was compelled to change his purpose, and at last to make home: hauing left Deputie Gouernor Captaine George Pearcie, a Gentle∣man of honour and resolution, with vpward of two hundred persons. Almightie God that had thus farre tryed the patience of the English, would not suffer them to bee tempted aboue that they were able: and therefore in his secret proui∣dence, before any knowledge was here had of his Lordships sicknesse, had ordayned that Sir Thomas Dale should be furnisht out with a good supply of three ships, Men, Cattell, and many prouisions, all which arriued safe at the Colonie the tenth of May, one thousand six hundred and eleuen. Hee by his Letters, and the Lord Gouernour by his Relations, did animate the Aduenturers; the one protesting himselfe willing and readie to lay all that he was worth vpon the aduenture of the action, rather then so honourable a worke should faile, and to returne with all conuenient expedition, if their friendly indeauours would therein second his resolutions: the other Sir Thomas Dales letter to the Cōmitties. writing that foure of the best Kingdomes in Christendome, put all together, may no way compare with this Countrie, either for commodities or goodnesse of soile. This sparke kindled in their hearts such constancie of zeale and forwardnesse, that they furnished out Sir Thomas Gates, (who had happily returned with the rest from Ber∣mudas) with six ships, three hundred men, and a hundred Kine, with other Cattell, Munition, and prouision of all sorts.
Sir Thomas Dale, hauing newes that it was a fleet of enemies, prepared himselfe and the rest to an encounter, but it ended with a common ioy, in the shaking of hands, and not of Pikes. Lawes are now made (for lawlesnesse had marred so much before) for the honour of God, frequenting the Church, obseruation of the Sabbath, reue∣rence to Ministers, obedience to Superiours, mutuall loue, honest labours, and a∣gainst adulterie, sactilege, wrong, and other vices, harbengers of Gods wrath and mans destruction. The Colonie consisted of seuen hundred men of sundrie arts and professions (few of them sick) which hauing left the Fort at Cape Henrie fortified and kept by Captaine Dauies, and the keeping of Iames Towne, to that noble and well deseruing Gentleman Master George Pearcie, is remoued vp the Riuer fourescore miles further beyond Iames Towne, to a place of higher ground, strong and defencible by nature, with good aire, plentie of Springs, much faire and open grounds freed from woods, and wood enough at hand. Here they burnt bricks, cut downe wood, and euery man falls to somewhat: they haue built, they say, competent houses, the first storie all of brick, that euery man may haue his lodging and dwelling by himselfe, with a sufficient quantitie of ground allotted thereto. Here also they were building an Hospitall with fourescore lodgings, and beds alreadie sent, for the sicke and lame, as the booke, called the New life of Virginia, relateth. Thus haue I beene bold somewhat largely to relate the proceedings of this Planta∣tion, to supplant such slanders and imputations as some haue conceiued or receiued a∣gainst it, and to excite the diligence and industrie of all men of abilitie, to put to their helping hand in this action, so honourable in it selfe, glorious to God in the furthe∣rance of his truth, and beneficiall to the common-wealth, and to the priuate purses of the Aduenturers, if the blooming of our hopes bee not blasted with our negli∣gence. For the description of the Countrie; Master Hakluyt from others relations in his third Volume of voyages hath written largely of those parts, discouered for Sir Walter Raleigh. Concerning the later, Captaine Iohn Smith, partly by word of mouth, part∣ly by his Mappe thereof in print, and more fully by a Manuscript which hee cour∣teously communicated to mee, hath acquainted me with that whereof himselfe with great perill and paine, had beene the discouerer, being in his discoueries taken Priso∣ner, and escaping their furie, yea receiuing much honour and admiration amongst them, by reason of his discourses to them of the motion of the Sunne, of the parts of the World, of the Sea, &c. which was occasioned by a Dyall then found about him. They carryed him prisoner to Powhatan, and there beganne the English acquain∣tance with that Sauage Emperour. The summe of his obseruation in that and other discoueries since, concerning the Countrie, is this. Virginia is situate betweene foure and thirtie and foure and fortie degrees of Notherly latitude; the bounds whereof on the East side are the great O∣cean, Florida on the South, on the North Noua Francia: the Westerne limits are vn∣knowne. But that part which beganne to bee planted by the English, in the yeare one thousand six hundred and six, is vnder the degrees seuen and thirtie, eight and thirtie, and nine and thirtie. The temperature agreeth with English bodies, not by other meanes distempered. The Sommer is hot as in Spaine, the Winter cold as in France and England: cer∣tayne coole Brizes doe asswage the vehemencie of the heat. The great Frost in the yeare one thousand six hundred and seuen reached to Virginia, but was recompenced with as mild a Winter with them the next yeare. There is but one entrance by Sea into this Countrie, and that at the mouth of a very goodly Bay. The Capes on both sides are honoured with the names of our Bri∣tanian hopes, Prince Henrie, and Duke Charles; lightsome and delightsome rayes of that Sunne which shineth from this elder to that New Britania. The water floweth in this Bay neare two hundred miles, and hath a channell, for a hundred and fortie
miles, of depth, betwixt seuen and fifteene fadome; of breadth, ten or fourteene miles. At the head of the Bay, the Land is Mountainous, and so runneth by a South west line: from which Mountaines proceede certaine brookes which after come to fiue princi∣pall Nauigable Riuers. The Mountaines are of diuers compositions, some like mil∣stones, some of marble: and many peeces of crystall they found throwne downe by the waters, which also wash from the Rocks such glistering Tinctures, that the ground in some places seemeth gilded. The colour of the earth in diuers places resembleth bole Armoniac, terra sigillata, and other such apparences: but generally is a black sandie mold. The Riuer next to the mouth of the Bay is Powhatan, the mouth whereof is neare three miles broade: it is Nauigable a hundred miles: falls, rocks, sholds, prohibite further Nauigation: hence Powhatan their greatest King hath his Title. In a Peninsula on the North-side thereof is situate Iames Towne. The people inhabiting which haue their Weroances, are the Kecoughtans, which haue not past twentie fighting men. The Paspaheghes, haue fortie. Chichahamania, two hundred. The Weanocks, a hundred. The Arrowhatocks, thirtie. The Place cal∣led Powhatan, fortie. The Appamatucks, threescore. The Quryoughcohanocks, fiue and twentie. The Warraskoyacks, fortie. The Nandsamnds, two hundred. The Chesapeacks, a hundred. The Chickahamaians are not gouerned by a Weroance, but by the Priests. No place affordeth more Sturgeon in Sommer, (of which at one draught haue beene taken threescore and eight) nor in Winter more Fowle. Four∣teene miles from Powhatan is the Riuer Pamaunk, nauigable with greater Vessells, not aboue threescore and ten miles. Toppahanock is nauigable a hundred and thir∣tie miles; Patamomeke, a hundred and twentie. To speake of Powtuxunt, Bolus, and other Riuers on the East side of the Bay: likewise, of diuers places which receiued name by some accident, as Fetherstones Bay, so called of the death of one of ours there happening, and the like: or to mention the numbers which euery people can make, would exceede our scope, and the Readers patience. Captaine Smiths Mappe may somewhat satisfie the desirous, and his booke when it shall bee printed, further. This the Captaine saith, that hee hath beene in many places of Asia and Europe, in some of Africa and America, but of all, holds Virginia by the naturall endowments, the fittest place for an earthly Paradise. Master Thomas Hariot Hak.vol.3. p.267. Theod.de Bry. 1.part.Americae. hath largely descri∣bed the commodities which the Water and Earth yeeld (set forth also in Latin with exquisite pictures by Theodore de Bry) in the relations of Brereton & Rosier, and others. There is a grasse which yeeldeth silke, beside tht store of silke-wormes. Hemp and Flax surpassing ours in growth and goodnesse, exceeded by a new-found stuffe of a certaine sedge or water-flagge, which groweth infinitely, and with little paines of boiling yeeldeth great quantitie of sundrie sorts of skeines of good strength and length, some like silke, and some like flax, and some a courser sort, as hemp. There is also a rich veine of Allum, of Terra Sigillata, Pitch, Tarre, Rozen, Tur∣pentine, Sassafras, Cedar, Grapes, Oile, Yron, Copper, and the hope of better Mines, Pearle, sweet Gummes, Dies, timber Trees of sweet wood for profit and plea∣sure, of which kinde haue beene discouered foureteene seuerall kinds. Neither is it needfull that here I relate the commodities of Virginia for food in Fowles, Beasts, Fishes, Fruits, Plants, Hearbs, Beries, Graines, especially their Maiz, which yeeldeth incredible recompence for a little labour. One acre of ground will yeeld with good husbandrie two hundred bushels of corne. They haue two rootes Cap.Smith.M.S. ; the one for me∣dicinall vse to cure their hurts, called Weighsacan, the other called Tockawhough, growing like a flagge, of the greatnesse and tast of a Potato, which passeth a fierie pur∣gation before they may eate it, being poison whiles it is raw. Yet in all this abun∣dance our men haue had small store but of want, and no fire nor water could purge that poyson which was rooted in some, to the hinderance of the plantation. Idlenesse in the vulgar, emulation, ambition, and couetousnesse in some of the grea∣ter, treacherie in some fugitiues, all these ayming more at their owne ends then at the
common good, haue from the beginning (I pray God it be, and I hope now is, ended) beene the poison to this honourable plantation. The chiefe beasts of Virginia are Beares, lesse then those in other places, Deare like ours, Aroughcun much like a Badger, but liuing on trees like a Squirrell: Squir∣rells, as bigge as Rabbets, and other flying Squirrells, called Assapanick, which sprea∣ding out their legges and skinnes seeme to flie thirtie or fortie yards at a time. The Ouassom hath a head like a Swine, a taile like a Rat, as bigge as a Cat, and hath vnder her belly a bagge wherein shee carryeth her yong. Their Dogges barke not, their Wolues are not much bigger then our Foxes, their Foxes are like our siluer-haired Conies, and smell not like ours. They haue Eagles, Haukes, wild Turkeys, and o∣ther Fowle, and Fish, which here to repeat would to some nice fastidious stomacks breede a fullnesse. They are a people Tho Hariot. clothed with loose mantles made of Deere skinnes, and aprons of the same, round about their middles, all else naked: of stature like to vs in England. They vse to paint themselues, and their children, he is the most gallant which is most monstrous. Their women imbroder their legges, handes, &c. with diuers workes, as of Serpents, and such like, with blacke spots in the flesh. Their houses are made of small poles, made fast at the top, in round forme, as is v∣sed in many arbours with vs: couered with barkes or mats, twice as long as they are broade. CHAP. VI. Of the Religion and Rites of the Virginians. NOw for the manners and rites of the people, thus hath Master Hariot Tho. Hariot. Hak.10.3.p.277. reported. They beleeue that there are many Gods, which they call Mantoac, but of different sorts and degrees: one only chiefe and great God, which hath beene from all eternitie. Who, as they af∣firme, when hee purposed to make the world, made first other Gods of a principall order, to bee as meanes and instruments to bee vsed in the Creation and gouernement to follow: and after, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, as petty Gods, and the instruments of the other order more principall. First, they say, were made waters, out of which by the Gods was made all diuersi∣tie of Creatures, that are visible or inuisible. For mankinde, they say, a woman was made first, which by the working of one of the Gods, conceiued and brought forth children. And in such sort they say they had their beginning: But how many yeares or ages haue passed since, they say, they can make no relation: hauing no letters, nor other meanes to keepe records of times past, but only Tradition from Father to Sonne. They thinke that all the Gods are of humane shape, and therefore they represent them by Images, in the formes of men, which they call Kewasowok: one alone is cal∣led Kewas. Them they place in Houses or Temples, which they call Machicomuck, where they worship, pray, sing, and make many times offerings vnto them. In some Machicomuck we haue seene but one Kewas, in some two, in other three. They be∣leeue the immortalitie of the soule: that after this life, as soone as the soule is depar∣ted from the bodie, according to the workes it hath done, it is either carried to h∣aeuen the habitacle of Gods, there to enioy perpetuall blisse and happinesse: or else to a great pit or hole, which they thinke to bee in the furthest parts of their part of the world toward the Sunne-set, there to burne continually. This place they call Popo∣gusso. For the confirmation of this opinion they tell tales of men dead and reuiued a∣gaine, much like to the Popish Legends. Thus they tell of one, whose graue the next day after his buriall was seene to moue,
and his body was therefore taken vp againe: who reported, that his soule had beene very neare the entring into Popogusso, had not one of the Gods saued him, and giuen him leaue to returne againe, and teach his friends how to auoide that terrible place. They tell of an other, which being taken vp in that manner; related, that his soule was aliue while his body was in the graue, and that it had trauailed farre in a long broade way, on both sides whereof grew most delicate pleasant Trees, bearing more rare and excellent fruits then euer he had seene before, or was able to expresse: and at length came to most braue and faire houses, neare which hee met his Father, that had beene dead before, who gaue him great charge to goe backe againe, and shew his friends what good they were to doe to enioy the pleasures of that place, which when hee had done, he should after come againe. What subtiltie soeuer be in their Wiroances Wiroance is a chiefe Lord, or petty King, which somtime hath but one Towne: and none that we had dealing with, had a∣boue eigh∣teene Townes vnder him. and Priests, the vulgar are hereby ve∣ry respectiue to their Gouernours, and carefull of their manners: although they haue also in criminall cases, punishments inflicted according to the qualitie of the offence. This I learned by speciall familiaritie with some of their Priests, wherein they were not so sure grounded, but that they lent open eare to ours, with doubting of their owne. The Tho.de Bry. in Pictur. Priests in Secota haue their haire on the crowne like a Combe, the rest being cut from it: only a fore-top on the forehead is left, and that Combe. They haue a garment of skinnes peculiar to their function. They are great Wisards. Our artificiall Workes, Fire-workes, Gunnes, Writing, and such like, they estee∣med the workes of Gods, rather then of Men, or at least taught vs by the Gods. They bare much respect to our Bibles. When the Wiroans was sick, hee sent to vs to pray for him. Some were of opinion that wee were not mortall, nor borne of Wo∣men, but that we were men of an old Generation many yeares past, then risen againe to immortalitie: some would likewise seeme to prophecie that there were more of our generation yet to come, to kill theirs, and take their places: which were now in the Aire inuisible, and without bodies, and that they by our entreatie did make men to die which had wronged vs. They haue First voiage to Virginia. Hak.tom.3.249. their Idoll in the inner-most roome of their house, of whom they tell incredible things. They carrie it with them when they goe to the Warres, and aske counsell thereof, as the Romans did of their Oracles. They sing songs as they march towards the battell, in stead of Drummes and Trumpets: their warres are bloudie, and haue wasted much of their people. A certaine King called Piemacum, hauing inuited many men and women of the Sc∣contans to a feast, whiles they were merrie and praying before their Idoll, came vp∣on them and slew them. When M. Ralph Lane Hak.tom.3.261. one of their Kings had conspired against the En∣glish, a chiefe man about him said, that we were the seruants of God, and not subiect to be destroyed by them: and that wee, being dead men, could doe more hurt then while wee were aliue. They vse to solemnize certaine moneths-mindes in their Sa∣uage manner for any great personage dead. Iames Iames Rosiers Rosier from the relation of Owen Griffin, an eye-witnesse, thus tells of their ceremonies. One among them, the eldest as he iudged, riseth right vp, the other sitting still: and looking about, suddenly cried with a loud voice, Baugh, Waugh: then the women fall downe, and lie vpon the ground: and the men all together answering the same, fall a stamping round about the fire, with both feet, as hard as they can, making the ground shake, with sundrie out-cries, and change of voice and sound. Many take the fire-sticks and thrust them into the earth: and then rest a while. Of a sudden they beginne as before, and con∣tinue so stamping till the yonger sort fetched from the shore many stones, of which euery man tooke one, and first beat vpon them with their fire-sticks, then with the stones beat the earth with all their strength. And in this manner they continued aboue two houres. After this ended, they, which had wiues, tooke them a-part, and with∣drew themselues seuerally into the wood. This seemed to bee their euening de∣uotion.
When they Theod. de Bry Icone 17.18. & seq. haue obtained some great deliuerance from danger, or returne from Warre, they obserue a publike and solemne reioicing by making a great fire, encom∣passed with the men and women promiscuously, all of them with Rattles in their hands making a great noise. They hold one time in the yeare festiuall, and then they meete together out of many Villages, euery one hauing a certaine marke or Character on his backe, where∣by it may bee discerned whose Subiect hee is. The place where they meete is spa∣cious, and round about are set postes, carued with the resemblance of a Nunnes head: in the midds are three of the fairest Virgins louingly embracing and clas∣ping each other: about this liuing Center, and Artificiall circle, they daunce in their sa∣uage manner. Their Idol called Kiwasa, is made of wood fower foote high, the face resembling the inhabitants of Florida, painted with flesh colour, the brest white, the other parts blacke, except the legges which are spotted with white; hee hath chaines or strings of beades about his necke. This Idoll is in Socota, as it were the keeper of the dead bodies of their Kings. In their Temples are houses of publike deuotion, they haue two, three, or more of them, set in a darke place. The dead bodies of their Wiroances are kept on certaine Scaffolds nine or ten foote high, this Kiwasa their guardian beeing placed with them: and vnderneath dwelleth a Priest which night and day there numbreth his deuotions. But let vs take view of our last Colonies obseruations. Captaine Smith, Newes from Virginia and a M.S. of Cap. Smith. was taken by the Virginians, and while hee stayed amongst them obserued these their magicall Rites. Three or foure daies after his taking, seuen of their Priestes in the house where he lay, each with a Rattle, (setting him by them) began at ten of the clocke in the morning, to sing about a fire, which they inuironed with a circle of Meale, at the end of euery song, (which the chiefe Priest began, the rest following) laying downe two or three Graines of Wheate: and after they had thus laide downe six or seuen hundred in one Circle, accounting their songes by Graines, as the Papists their Orisons by Beades, they made two or three other circles in like manner, and put at the end of euery song, betwixt euery two, or three, or fiue Graines, a little sticke. The High Priest disguised with a great skinne, his head hung round with little skinnes of Weasils, and other Vermine, with a crownet of Feathers, painted as vgly as the Diuell, at the end of each song vseth strange and vesement gestures, casting great Cakes of Deare∣suet, and Tobacco into the Fire: thus till six of the clocke in the euening, they conti∣nued these howling deuotions, and so held on three daies. This they pretended to doe, to know if any more of his countreymen would arriue, and what hee there in∣tended. They so fedd this our Authour, that he much misdoubted, that hee should haue beene sacrificed to the Quiyoughquosicke, which is a Superiour power they worship, then the Image whereof a more vgly thing cannot be described. To cure the sicke, a certaine man with Their Ratles are of Gourds or Pompion rindes: of which they haue their tre∣ble, tenor, base, &c. a little Rattle, vsing extreme howlings, shouting, singing, with diuers anticke and strange behauiours ouer the Patient, sucketh bloud out of his stomacke, or diseased place. Not much vnlike to that ratling deuotion of their exorcising Priests, (at least in absurditie) was that entertainement M.S. by W.S. which Powhatans women gaue the said Cap∣taine then beeing free and President of the company, at Werowocomoco; Where thirtie of them came out of the Woodes naked, onely couered behinde and be∣fore, with a few greene leaues, their bodies painted, but with some difference each from other: the leader of these Nymphs resembled both Actaeon and Diana, hauing on her head a faire paire of Stagges hornes, and a quiuer of Arrowes at her backe, with bow and Arrowes in her hand: The rest followed all horned alike, weaponed with vnlike instruments: these (as if they had beene the infernall guard, comming with Cer∣berus to welcome Proferpina to her Palace) rushed from the trees with hellish shoutes and cries, dancing about a fire, which there was made for that purpose: and after an houre thus spent, they departed.
Then did they solemnely inuite him to their lodging, where he was no sooner come, but all rounded about him with tedious kindnesse, crying loue you not mee? This sa∣lutation ended, which Pan and all his Satyres would haue accepted, they feasted him with plentie and varietie, some singing and dancing whiles others attended: and at last led him with a fire-brand in stead of a torch to his lodging. When they Cap.Smith.Man.S. intend any wars; the Weroances or Kings consult first with the Priests and Coniurers. And no people haue there beene found so sauage which haue not their Priests, Gods, and Religion. All things that are able to hurt them beyond their preuention, they after their sort adore, as the Fire, Water, Lightning, Thunder, our Ordnance, Peeces, Horses: Yea, Captaine Smith told mee; that they seeing one of the English Bores in the way, were stricken with awfull feare, because hee brisled vp himselfe and gnashed his teeth, and tooke him for the God of the Swine, which was offended with them. The chiefe God they worship is the Deuill, which they call Oke. They haue con∣ference with him, and fashion themselues vnto his shape. In their Temples they haue his Image ill-sauouredly made, painted, adorned with chaines, copper, and beads, and couered with a skinne. By him is commonly the Sepulchre of their Kings; whose bodies are first bowelled, then dryed on a hurdle, and haue about the ioynts chaines of copper, beads, and other like trash; then lapped in white skinnes, and rowled in mats, and orderly entombed in arches made of mats, the remnant of their wealth being set at their feet. These Temples and Bodies are kept by their Priests. For their ordinarie burialls, they digge a deepe hole in the earth with sharpe stakes, and the corps being wrapped in skinnes and mats with their iewells, they lay them vpon sticks in the ground, and couer them with earth. The buriall ended, the women hauing their faces painted with black cole and oile, sit foure and twentie houres in the houses mourning and lamenting by turnes, with yellings and howlings. Euery Ter∣ritorie of a Weroance hath their Temples and Priests. Their principall Temple is at Vttamussack in Pamaunk, where Powhatan hath an house vpon the top of certaine sandie hils in the woods. There are three great houses filled with Images of their Kings and Deuills, and Tombes of their Predecessours. Those houses are neare threescore foot long, built, after their fashion, arbour-wise. This place is in such estimation of holinesse, that none but the Priests and Kings dare enter: yea, the Sauages dare not passe by in boats without casting copper, beads, or somewhat into the Riuer. Here are commonly resident seuen Priests: the chiefe differed from the rest in his ornaments: the other can hardly be knowne from the common people, but that they haue not so many holes at their eares to hang their iewels at. The high-Priests head∣tire is thus made. They take a great many Snakes skinnes stuffed with mosse, as also of Weasils and other Vermines skinnes, which they tie by their tailes, so that all the tailes meete on the top of the head like a great Tassell. The faces of their Priests are painted as vgly as they can deuise: in their hands they haue rattells, some Base, some Treble. Their deuotion is most in songs which the chiefe Priest beginneth, the rest follow∣ing: sometime hee maketh inuocations with broken sentences, by starts and strange passions, and at euery pause the other giue a short grone. It cannot be perceiued that they haue any set holy dayes: only, in some great distresse of want, feare of enemies, times of triumph, and of gathering their fruits, the whole, Countrie, Men, Women, and Children, assemble to their solemnities. The manner of their deuotion is some∣times, to make a great fire, all singing and dancing about the same with rattles and shouts, foure or fiue houres: sometimes they set a man in the midst, and dance and sing about him, he all the while clapping his hands, as if hee would keepe time: after this, they goe to their feasts. They haue certaine Altar-stones, which they call Pawcorances, standing from their temples, some by their houses, others in the woods & wildernesses; vpon which they offer bloud, Deer-suet, & Tobacco. This they doe when they returne from the warres, from their huntings, and on other occasions. When the waters are rough in stormes, their coniurers runne to the waters sides, or passe in their boats,
and after many hellish out-cries and inuocations, cast Tobacco, Copper, Pocones, or such trash into the water, to pacifie that GOD whom they thinke to bee very angry in those stormes. Before their dinners and Suppers the better sort will take the first bitt, and cast it into the fire, which is all the grace they are knowne to vse. In some part of the countrey they haue yearely a sacrifice of children: such an one was performed at Quiyonghcohanock some ten miles from Iames-towne in this manner. Fifteene of the properest yong boyes betweene ten and fifteene yeares of age they painted white: Hauing brought them forth, the people spent the forenoone in dancing and singing about them with Rattles: in the afternoone they put these children to the roote of a tree, all the men standing to guard them, each with a Bastinado of Reedes bound together, in his hand. Then doe they make a Lane betweene them all along, through which there were appointed fiue young men to fetch these children. Each of these fetcheth a child, the guard laying on with their bassinadoes, while they with their naked bodies defend the children to their great smart. All this time the women weepe and cry out very passionately, prouiding Mosle, Skinnes, Matts, and dry wood, as things fitting the childrens Funerall. When the children are in this manner fetched away, the Guard teares downe trees, branches, and boughes, making wreathes for their heads, or bedecking their haire with the leaues. What else was done with the children was not seene, but they were all cast on a heape in a Valley, as dead, where was made a great Feast for all the company. The Werowance beeing demanded the meaning of this Sa∣crifice, answered, that the children were not all dead, but that the Oke or Diuel did suck the bloud from their left brest, who chanced to be his by Lott, till they were dead, but the rest were kept in the Wildernesse by the Yong men, till nine Moones were expired, during which time they must not conuerse with any, and of these were made their Priestes, and coniurers. This Sacrifice they held to be so necessarie, that if they should omitt it, their Oke or Diuell, and their other Quiyoughcosughes or Gods, would let them haue no Deare. Turkies, Corne, or Fish; and would besides make a great slaughter a∣mongst them. They thinke that their Werowances and Priestes, which they also e∣steeme Quiyoughcosughes, when they are dead, doe goe beyond the Mountaines to∣wards the setting of the Sunne, and euer remaine there in forme of their Oke, hauing their heads painted with Oile & Pocones Pocones is a small Roote which dried & beat into poul∣der turneth red: they vse it for swellings, aches, & pain∣ting. finely trimmed with Feathers, and shall haue Beades, Hatchets, Copper, and Tobacco, neuer ceasing to dance and sing with their predecessours. The common people, they suppose, shall not liue after death. Some sought to conuert them from these superstitions: the Werowance of Quiyoughcohanocke was so farre perswaded as that he prosfessed to beleeue that our God exceeded theirs, as much as our Gunnes did their Bowes and Arrowes: and many times did send to the President many presents, intreating him to pray to his In that ex∣tremitie of mi∣sery which ours since sustained, I haue been told that both the sauages and fugitiues would obiect our want and their plenty, for theirs, and against our Religion. God for raine, for his God would not send him any. The Wirowance of Acawmacke told our men of a strange accident: two children beeing dead, and buried, being reuiewed by the patents, seemed to haue liuely and cheerefull countenances, which caused many to behold them, and none of the behol∣ders escaped death. The Sasquesahanockes are a Gyantly people, strange in proportion, behauiour, and attire, their voice founding from them as out of a Caue: their attire of Beares skinnes, hanged with Beares pawes, the head of a Wolfe, and such like Iewels: and (if any would haue a Spoone to eate with the Diuell) their Tobacco-pipes were three quarters of a yard long, carued at the great end with a Bird, Beare, or other deuice, suf∣ficient to beate out the braines of a horse (and how many Asses braines are beaten out, or rather mens braines smoked out, and Asses haled in by our lesse Pipes at home?) the the rest of their furniture was sutable. The calfe of one of their legges was measured three quarters of a yard about, the rest of his limmes proportionable. With much a∣doe restrained they this people from worshipping our men. And M.S. by W.S. collected out of the writing of T.S.A.T.W.R.N.P.W.P.R.W.R.P.&c. when our men pray∣ed (according to their daily Custome) and sung a Psalme, they much wondred: and after began in most passionate manner to holde vp their hands to the Sunne, vvith a Song: then embracing the Captaine they began to adore him in like manner, and so
proceeded (notwithstanding his rebuking them) till their song was ended: which done, one with a most strange action and vncomely voice began an Oration of their loues. That ended, with a great painted Beares skinne they couered the Captaine, ano∣ther hung about his necke a chaine of white Beades. Others laide eighteene mantels at his feete, with many other ceremonies to create him their Gouernour, that he might defend them against the Massa-womekes their enemies. As these are very great, so the Wighcocomocoes are very little. I may also here insert the ridiculous conceits which some Virginians hold, concer∣ning their first originall, as I haue heard from the relation of an English Cap. Argoles boy his name was Henry Spilman. youth, which liued long amongst the Sauages: that a Hare came into their countrey and made the first men, and after preserued them from a great Serpent: and when two other Hares came thither, that Hare for their entertainment killed a Deare, which was then the onely Deare that was, and strewing the haires of that Deares Hide, euery haire proued a Deare. He said they worshipped towards a certaine Hoope or Sphere doubled a-crosse, which was set vpon an heape of stones in their houses. They had a house without the towne for the women, in the time of their naturall sicknes to keepe in, where no men might come, The Virginians Cap. Smith.M.S. are borne white: their haire blacke; few haue beards: the vvomen with two shells are their Barbars: they are strong nimble, and hardy, inconstant, timo∣rous, quicke of apprehension, cautelous, couetous of Copper and Beades; they seldome forget an iniury, and seldome steale from each other, least the coniurers should bewray them, which it is sufficient that these thinke they can doe. They haue their lands and gardens in proper, and most of them liue of their labour. In each eare commonly they haue three great holes, whereat they hang chaines, bracelets, or copper: some weare in those holes a small Snake coloured greene and yel∣low, neare halfe a yard long, which crawling about his neck, offereth to kisse his lippes. Others weare a dead Rat tied by the taile. Their names are giuen them according to the humour of the Parents. Their women they say are easily deliuered: they wash in the Riuers their yong Infants to make them hardy. The women and children doe the houshould and field-worke, the men disdaining the same, and onely delighting in fishing, hunting, warres, and such man-like exercises: the women plant, reape, beare burthens, pound their corne, make Baskets, potts, their bread, and doe their Cookerie and other businesse. Powhatan had aboue thirtie Commanders, or Wirrowances vnder him, all which were not in peace onely, but seruiceable in Captaine Smiths presidencie, to the English, and still as I haue been told by some that haue since beene there, they doe affect him, and will aske of him. Powhatan hath three brethren, and two sisters, to whom the in∣heritance belongeth successiuely, and not to his or their sonnes till after their death, and then the eldest Sisters sonne inheriteth. He hath his treasure of skinnes, Copper, pearles, beades, and such like, kept in a house for that purpose, and there stored against the time of his buriall. This house is fiftie or threescore yardes long, frequented onely by Priests. At the foure corners of this house stand foure images as Sentinels, one of a Dragon, an other of a Beare, a third of a Leopard, and the fourth of a Gyant. Hee hath as many women as he will, which when hee is weary of, he bestoweth on whom he best liketh. His will, and Custome are the lawes. He executeth ciuill punishments on malefactors, as broiling to death, being encompassed with fire, and other tortures. The other Wi∣rowances, or Commanders (so the word signifieth) haue power of life and death; and haue, some twenty men, some fortie, some a hundred, some many more vnder their command. Some were sent to enquire for those which were left of Sir Walter Rawleighs Colony, but they could learne nothing of them but that they were dead.
CHAP. VII. Of Florida. NExt to Virginia towards the South is situate Florida, Florida with i. long. Ortel. Theat. so called because it was first discouered by the Spaniards on Exped.in Flor.ap.T.de Bry. Palme-sunday, or, at the most interpret, Easter-day, which they call Pasqua Florida: and not, as Theuet writeth, for the flourishing Verdure thereof. The first Gomara hist. gen.e.45. finder after their account was Iohn Ponce of Leon, in the yeare 1512. but wee haue before shewed that Sebastian Cabota had discouered it in the name of King Henry the seuenth of England. The length of this Region extendeth to the fiue and twentith degree. It runneth out into the Sea with a long point of land, as if it would either set barres to that swift current which there runneth out, or point out the dangers of those coasts to the Hazardous Mariners. Into the Land it stretcheth Westward vnto the borders of New-Spaine, and those other countries which are not fully knowne: other where it is washed with a dangerous Sea, which separateth Cichora, Baliama, & Lucaiae from the same. Iohn Ponce Gomera & Caluetō. aforesaid hearing a rumour of a prodigious well, which (as the Poets tell of Medea) would make olde men become young againe, plaid the yongling to goe search it six monethes toge∣ther, and in that inquirie discouers this Continent: and repairing into Spaine, obtai∣neth this Prouince with the Title of Adelantado. He returned with a Nauie and band of Souldiours, but at his landing was so welcomed by the Floridians, that many of his men were slaine, and himselfe wounded vnto death. Benzo.l.2. Pamphilo de Naruaes had no bet∣ter successe: hee entred Florida, 1527. Cabeca, Denaca, and some of his company, after long captiuitie, escaped Pamphilo carried with him six hundred men: about the Riuer of Palmes, his ships were wracked, and most of the Spaniards drowned. A few escaped drowning but twelue fell madde, & like Dogs, sought to worrie each other. Scarsely ten returned into Spaine. These comming to Mexico, reported that they had restored three dead men to life: I rather beleeue, saith Benzo, that they killed foure quicke men. Don Ferdinando de Soto This expedi∣tion of Soto is, by Maister Hakluit, let forth in Eng∣lish, being writ∣ten by a Por∣tugall gentle∣man of Eluas, emploied ther∣in.l was. Anno.1538. enriched with the spoiles of Atibaliba King of Peru, In which action hee was a Captaine and horseman, here found place to spend that which there he had gotten. For hauing obtained the gouernment of Florida, and gathered a band of six hundred men for that expedition, in it hee spent fiue yeares searching for mineralls, till hee lost himselfe. Iulian Samado, and Ahuma∣da made sute for the like graunt, but could not obtaine it. Frier Luys de Beluastro, and other Dominikes had vndertaken by the way of preaching to haue reduced the Floridians to Christianitie, and the Spanish obedience, and were sent at the Em∣perours charge, but no sooner set foote on shore, then hee and two of his com∣panions were taken by the Sauages, and cruelly slaine and eaten, their shauen skalpes being hanged vp in their Temple for a monument. This happened in the yeare 1549. In the yeare 1524. Francis the first, the French King had sent Iohn Iohn de Ver∣razano.ap.Hak.to.3. de Verrazano hither, but because he rather sought to discouer all along the coast then to search or settle within Land I passe him ouer. In the yeare 1562. That wor∣thy of France, Of his life there is a spe∣ciall booke. Chastillon, Champion of Religion and of his countrie, sent Cap∣taine Iohn Ribault to discouer and Plant in these parts, which his Voyage & Plan∣tation is written by Rene Rene Laud.  Hak. Landonniere, one employed therein. He left Captaine Albert there with some of his company, who built a fort called Charles Fort: but this Albert was slaine in a mutiny by his Souldiours, and they returning home were so pursued by Famine, the Pursuiuant of Diuine Iustice, that after their shooes and Leather Ierkins eaten (their drinke being Sea water or their owne Vrine) they kil∣led and eate vp one of their owne company. Laudonniere was sent thither againe to inhabite, Anno 1564. and the next yeare Ribauls was sent to supply his place.
But vncouth He was relie∣ued by Sir Iohn Houkins great bounty . Famine had so wasted and consumed the French, before his arriuall, that the very bones of most of the Souldiours pierced through their starued skinnes in many places of their bodies, as if they would now trust the empty hands no longer, but would become their owne purueyours, and looke out for themselues. And yet better it is to fall into the hands of God, then of mercilesse Men: Famine being but a meere Execu∣tioner to Gods iustice, but these executing also a diuellish malice. Such were the Spa∣niards, who were sent thither vnder the conduct of Don Pedro Melendes, which mas∣sacred all of euery Sexe and age, which they found in the Fort: & Ribault, being cast by ship wracke on the shore, and receiued of Vallemandus the Spaniard, with promises of all kindnes, was cruelly murthered with all his company, except some few which they reserued for their owne emploiments. The manner of it is at large handled by Laudon.ap.Hak. Landinniere, Iaques Mor∣gues.ap  de Bry Amer.parte 2. by Morgues, by Challusius, Nic. Challusius Diepensised tus Latine per Cal∣etonem. which were as brands by diuine hand plucked out of this Spanish combustion. The Petition or Supplication put Supplicatio ap. Caluct. & apud Theod de Bry. vp by the Orphanes, Widowes, and distressed kindred of that massacred number to Charles the ninth, mentioneth nine hundred, which perished in this bloudy deluge. The Spaniards hauing laide the foundations of their habitation in bloud, sound it too slipperie to build any sure habitation thereon. For their cruelties both to the French and Floridians were retorted vpon themselues, in the yeare 1567. by Dom.de Gor∣gues.ap Hak.to.3 M. Dominique de Gorgnes, and his associates, assisted by the Natiue Inhabitants, and Flo∣rida was left destitute of Christian inhabitants. Thus hath Florida beene first cour∣ted by the English, wooed by the Spanish, almost wonne by the French, and yet remaines a rich and beautifull Virgin, vvaiting till the neighbour Virginia bestow on her an English Bridegroome, who as making the first loue, may lay the iustest chal∣lenge vnto her. Her riches are such that Cabcz.de vaca ap.Hak.in Lp. Dedic. in his Virginia richly valued. Cabeza de Vaca, (who was one of Naruaes wracked com∣pany, and Sotos Corriuall in this Floridian sute, and had trauelled through a great part of the In-land) affirmed to Charles the Emperour, that Florida was the richest countrie of the world, and that he had therein seene Gold and Siluer, and stones of great value. Be∣sides there is great varietie of Gaspar.Ens l.3 Botero parte 1.l.5. Trees, Fruits, Fowles, Beasts, Beares, Leopards, Ounces, Wolues, wilde Dogges, Goates, Hares, Conies, Deere, Oxen with woollic-Hides, Camels backes, and horses manes. Our discourse hath most right vnto their rites. For their many cities, the manner of their building, the manners of their inhabi∣tants I would not be so long. Morgues America parte 2.de Bry. hath let vs see them in the pictures. They wall or impale them with postes fastned in the ground, the circle as of a snaile comming within that point where it beganne, and leauing a way but for two men to enter; at either end of that double empaling or entrance, stand two watch-towers, one within the other without the Citie, where Watch-men alway are set for defence: their houses are round: their apparell nakednesse, except a beasts skinne, or some or∣nament of Mosse about their secret parts. They paint and rase their skinnes with great cunning; the smart makes them sicke seuen or eight daies after; they rubb ouer those rased workes, with a certaine hearbe, which coloureth the fame so as it cannot be done away. They paint their faces, and their skinnes cunningly (this Morgues a Pain∣ter beeing iudge) euen to admiration. They let the nailes on their toes and fingers grow long: they are tall, nimble, comely. They warre Laudonniere. alway one countrey vpon another, and kill all the men they can take, the women and children they bring vp: they cutt off the haire of the head together with the skinne, and dry it to reserue the same as a monument of their valour. After their returne from the Warres, if they bee victorious they make a solemne. Feast which lasteth three daies, with daunces and songs to the honour of the Sunne. For the Sunne and Moone are their Deities. Their Priests are Magicians also & Physitians with them. They haue many Hermaphrodites, which are put to great drudgerie, and made to beare all their carriages. In necessity they will eate coles, and put sand in their pottage. Three moneths in the yere they forsake their houses, & liue in the woods: against this time they haue made their prouision of victuall, drying the same in the smoke. They meet in cōsul∣tatiō euery morning in a great cōmon house, whither the King resorteth & his senators,
which after salutations sit downe in a round. They consult with the Iawas or Priest. And after this they drinke Cassine, which is very hote, made of the leaues of a certaine Tree, which none may tast that bath not before made his valour euident in the warres. It sets them in a sweat, and taketh away hunger and thirst foure & twenty houres after. When a King dieth, they bury him very solemnly, and vpon his graue they set the cup wherein he was wont to drinke: and round about the graue they sticke many Arrowes, wee∣ping and fasting three daies together without ceassing. All the Kings which were his friends, make the like mourning: and in token of their loue cutt off halfe their haire (which they otherwise weare long, knit vp behinde) both men and women. During the space of six Moones (so they reckon their monethes) there are certaine women appoin∣ted which bewaile his death, crying with a loude voice thrice a day, at Morning, Noone, and Euening. All the goods of this King are put into his house, which afterwards they set on fire. The like is done with the goods of the Priests, who are buried in their houses, and then both house and goods burned. The women Morgues Icon.18 19. that haue lost their husbands in the Warres present themselues before the King sitting on their heeles with great lamentations sueing for reuenge & they with other widowes spend some daies in mourning at their husbands graues, and carry thi∣ther the cup wherein he had wont to drinke: they cut also their haire neere the eares, strewing the same in the sepulcher. There they cast also their weapons. They may not marry againe till their haire be growne that it may couer their shoulders. When any is sicke they lay him flat on a forme, and with a sharpe shell rasing off the skinne of his forehead, sucke out the bloud with their mouths, spitting it out into some vessell. The women that giue sucke, or are great with childe come to drinke the same, especially if it be of a lusty young man, that their milke may be bettered, and the childe, thereby nourished, may be stronger. Ribault Icon.8. at his first being there had fixed a certaine Pillar of stone, engrauen with the Armes of France on a hill in an Iland, which Laudonniere at his comming found the Flo∣ridians worshipping as their Idol, with kisses, kneeling, and other deuotions. Before the same lay diuers offerings of fruits of the country, rootes (which they vsed either for foode or physicke) vessels full of sweet oiles, with bowes and Arrowes. It was gyrt a∣bout with Garlands of flowers, and boughes of the best trees, from the top to the bot∣tome, King Athore himselfe performed the same honour to this pillar, that he receiued of his subiects. This King Athore was a goodly personage, higher by a foote and halfe then any of the French, representing a kinde of maiestie and grauitie in his demeanure. He had married his owne mother, and had by her diuers children of both sexes; but after she was espoused to him, his father Satourioua, did not touch her. This Icon.11. Satourioua when he went to warre, in the presence of the French vsed these ce∣remonies: The Kings his coaditors sitting around, hee placed himselfe in the midst, at his right hand had a fire, and at his left two vessels full of water. Then did hee expresse Indignation and anger in his lookes, gestures, hollow murmurings, and loude cries, an∣swered with the like from his souldiours: and taking a woodden dish, turned himselfe to the Sunne as thence desiring victorie, and that as he now shed the water in the dish, so hee might shed the bloud of his enemies. Hurling therefore the water with great violence into the aire, and therewith be sprinkling his souldiours he said, Doe you thus with the bloud of our enemies: and powring the water which was in the other vessel on the fire, so (saith he) may you extinguish your foes, and bring backe the skinnes of their heads. Outina Icon.12. or Vtina another King was an enemie to this Sataurioua: he in his ex∣pedition which he made against his enemies (wherein hee was assisted by the French) consulted with this Magician about his successe. He espying a French mans Target, de∣maundeth the same, and (in the mids of an armie) placeth it on the ground, drawing a circle fiue foote ouer about it, adding also certaine notes and Characters: then did hee set himselfe vpon the Target, sitting vpon his heeles, mumbling I know not what with varietie of gestures about the space of a quarter of an houre: after which he appeared so transformed into deformed shapes that he looked not like a man, wreathed his lims and his bones cracking with other actions seeming supernaturall. At last he returnes himself
as it were weary and astonished, and comming out of the circle saluted the King; and told him the number of their enemies and place of their encamping, vvhich they found very true. This King was called Holata Outina, which signifieth; a King, of Kings, and yet a few hundreths of men vvere his armie, which hee Icon.14. conducted in their rankes, himselfe going alone in the mids. They drie the armes and legges, and crownes of their enemies which they haue slaine, to make solemne triumph at their returne, which they doe, fastning them on poles pitched in the ground, the men and women sitting round about, and the Magician with an Image in his hand, mum∣bling curses against the enemy: ouer against him are three men kneeling, one of which beateth a stone with a clubb, and answereth the Magician at euery of his imprecati∣ons, the other two sing and make a noise with certaine Rattles. They sow or set their corne rather, as in Virginia: and haue two seede-times, & two haruests, which they bring into a publike barne, or common store-house as they doe the rest of their victuals, none fearing to be beguiled of his neighbour. Thus doe these Bar∣barians enioy that Content attended with Sobrietie and Simplicitie, which we haue ba∣nished together out of our coasts: euery one distrusting or defrading others, whiles ei∣ther by miserable keeping, or luxurious spending, he (which is Auarus, Ma∣lus omnibus, sibi pessimus. Seneca. bad to all) is worst to him∣selfe. To this barne they bring at a certaine time of the yeare, all the Venison, Fish, and Crocodiles, (dried before in the smoke for the better preseruation) which they meddle not with till neede forceth them, and then they signifie the same to each other. The King may take thereof as much as he will. This prouision is sent in baskets on the shoulders of their Hermaphrodites, which weare long haire, and are their Porters for all burthens. They hunt Harts after a strange manner: for they will put on a Harts skinne, with the legges and head on, so that the same shall serue them to stalke with; and they will looke through the eye and holes of the Hide, as if it were a visour, thereby decei∣uing their game, which they shoot and kill, especially at the places, where they come to drinke. Their Crocodiles they take in a strange manner. They are so plagued vvith these beasts, that they keepe continuall watch and ward against them, as other-where against their enemies. For this purpose they haue a Watch-house Icon.16. by the Riuers side, and when hunger driues the beast on shore for his prey, the Watch-man calls to men appointed: they come ten or twelue of them, hearing a beame or Tree, the smaller end whereof they thrust into the mouth of the Crocodile (comming vpon them ga∣ping for his prey) which being sharpe and rough, cannot be got out, and therewith they ouer-turne him, and then beeing laide on his backe, easily kill him. The flesh N. Chalus.c.3. tasteth like Veale, and would bee sauourie meate, if it did not sauour so much of a musky sent. Their sobrietie Ic.2.8. lengtheneth their liues, in such sort that one of their Kings told me, saith Morgues, that he was Laudon. saith two hundred and fiftie, but he saw them not himselfe as this our author did: this man gaue two Ea∣gles to the French. three hundred yeares olde, and his Father, which there he shewed me aliue, was fiftie yeares elder then himselfe: when I saw him, me thought I saw nothing but bones couered with skinne. His sinewes was, veines, and arteries, saith Laudonniere in description of the same man, his bones and other parts appeared so clearely through his skinne, that a man might easily tell them, and discerne the one from another. He could not see, nor yet speake without great paine. Monsieur de Ottigni, demaunding of their age, the yonger of these two called a company of Indians, and striking twice on his thigh, laid his hands on two of them, hee shewed that they vvere his sonnes: and striking on their thighes, he shewed others which were their sonnes, and so continued till the fift generation. And yet it was told them, that the eldest of them both might by the course of Nature liue thirtie or forty yeares more. They haue Morgues Icon.34. a diuelish custome to offer their first borne Male Children to the King for a Sacrifice. The day of this dismall Rite beeing notified to the King, hee goeth to the place appointed and sittes downe. Before him is a blocke two foote high, and as much thicke, before vvhich the Mother of the Childe sit∣ting on her heeles, and couering her face, with her hands, deploreth the death of her sonne. One of her friends offereth the childe to the King: and then the women
which accompained the mother, place themselues in a Ring, dauncing and singing, and she that brought the child, stands in the mids of them with the childe in her hands, sing∣ing somewhat in the Kings commendation. Six Indians stand a-part, and with them the Priest with a Clubbe, wherewith after these ceremonies hee killeth the childe on that blocke: which was once done in our presence. Another Icon.35. Religious Rite they obserue about the end of Februarie: they take the hide of the greatest Hart they can get (the hornes being on) and fill the same with the best hearbes which grow amongst them, hanging about the hornes, necke, and bodie, as it were Garlands of their choicest fruits. Hauing thus sowed and trimmed it, they bring the same with songs and Pipes, and set it on a high Tree, with the head tur∣ned toward the East, with prayers to the Sunne, that hee would cause the same good things to grow againe in their Land. The King and his Magician stand nearest the Tree and beginne, all the people following with their Responds. This done, they goe their waies leauing it there till the next yeare, and then renew the same cere∣monie. Bibault R. Laudonn. at his first comming had two of the Floridians abord with him certaine daies, who, when they offered them meate refused it, giuing them to vnderstand that they were accustomed to wash their face, and to stay till sunne-set before they did eate: which is a ceremonie common in all those partes. They obserue a certaine Feast called Toya, with great solemnitie. The place where it is kept is a great circuit of ground, swept and made neate by the women the day before: and on the Feast day they which are appointed to celebrate the Feast, come painted and trimmed with fea∣thers, and set themselues in order. Three Tese 3.are lawas, which are Priests, Ma∣gicians, and Physicians. others in differing painting and gestures follow with Tabrets, dauncing and singing in a lamentable tune, others answering them. After that they haue sung, danced, and turned three times, they fall to run∣ning like vnbridled Horses, through the middest of the thicke woodes: the Indian women continuing all the day in weeping and teares, cutting the armes of the yong girles with muskle-shelles, with hurling the bloud into the Aire, crying out three times, He Toya. Those that ranne through the Woods, returne two daies after, and then daunce in the middest of the place, and cheere vp those which were not cal∣led to the Feast. Their daunces ended, they deuoure the meate, for they had not eate in three dayes before. The Frechmen learned of a boy, that in this meane∣while the Iawas had made inuocation Toya, and by Magicall Characters had made him come that he might speake with him, and demaund diuers strange things of him, which for feare of the Iawas he durst not vtter. To prouoke them vnto reuenge against their enemies, they in their Feasts haue this custome. There is a Dagger in the roome, which one taketh and striketh ther∣with one that is thereunto appointed, and then places the Dagger where hee had it, and anone reneweth the stroke, till the Indian falling downe, the women, Girles, Boyes, come about him and make great lamentation, the men meane while drinking Cassine, but with such silence, that not one word is heard: afterwards they apply Mosse warmed, to his side to heale him. Thus doe they call to minde the death of their ancestors slaine by their enemies, especially when they haue inuaded, and returne out of their enemies country without the heads of any of them, or with∣out any Captiues. These things following Ortelius Ortel.Theat. saith, hee had from his Nephew Caelius Ortelius, by the Relation of an eye-witnesse. The King giueth, or selleth rather, to euerie man his Wife. If a woman commit Adulterie, shee is bound to a Tree, her armes and legges stretched out all day, and sometimes whipped. A woman, three houres after shee is deliuered of a Childe, carries the Infant to the Riuer to wash it. They obserue no discipline in their Families with their Children. They haue Fleas, which bite so eagerly, that they leaue a great deformitie like a Lepry after: They haue winged Serpents, one of which I saw, saith Nicolaus Challus. exped. in Florid.c.3. Challusius, the wings whereof seemed to enable it to flie a little height from the ground: The inhabitants
were very carefull to get the head thereof, as was thought, for some superstition. Bo∣tero Botero Rel. part.1.lib.5. saith, that they haue three sorts of Harts, and of one of them make the same com∣modities which we doe of our kine, keeping them tame, and milking them. The Spa∣niard hath three garrisons on the coast of Florida, S. Iacomo, S. Agostino, and S. Philippo. They are Gasp.Ens.l.3 much addicted to venery, and yet abstaine from their wiues after con∣ception knowne. When Discouerie of Florida and Virginia richly valewed. Ferdinando Soto entred Florida, he there found amongst the Indians one Iohn Ortiz a Spaniard, which by the suttlety of the people, vnder colour of deliuering a letter which they had fastned to a clest cane, was taken and liued twelue yeares with them. Vcita the Lord of the place made him his Temple-keeper, because that by night the wolues came and carried away the dead corpses. Hee reported that these people are worshippers of the Deuill, and vse to offer vnto him the life and bloud of their Indians, or of any people, that they can come by: and when he will haue them doe that sacrifice vnto him, he speaketh vnto them, and tells them, that hee is a thirst, and enioynes them this sacrifice. They haue a prophecie, That a white people should sobdue them; wherein the French and Spanish haue hitherto failed in their attempts. Soto hauing in his greedy hopes neglected the many, commodities hee might haue en∣ioyed, to finde greater: was brought to such dumps that he thereon sickened, and af∣ter died. But before he tooke his bed, he sent to the Cacique of Quigalta, to tell him, that he was the childe of the Sunne, and therefore would haue him repaire to him: hee answered. That if he would drie vp the riuer, hee would beleeue him. And when hee was dead, because he made the Indians beleeue that the Christians were immortall, the Spaniards sought to conceale his death. But the Cacique of Guachoya busily enquiring for him, they answered that he was gone to heauen, as many times he did, and had left an other in his place. The Cacique thinking he was dead, Benzo libr.2. commaunded two young and well proportioned Indians to be brought thither, saying it was their custome to kil men, when any Lord died, to wait on him by the way: which their cruell courtesie the Spaniards refused, denying that their Lord was dead. One Cacique asked Soto what he ws, and why he came thither, he answered, That hee was the sonne of GOD, and came to teach them knowledge of the Law. Not so, saith the Cacique, if GOD bids thee thus to kill, steale, and worke all kinde of mischiefe. For their credulity in like case, Laudonniere telleth, that a strange and vnheard-of lightning hapned within a league of their fort, which consumed in an instant 500 acres of meadow, being then greene, and halfe couered with water, together with the foules that were therein. It continued burning three dayes together, and made the French∣men thinke, that for their sakes the Indians had set fire on their dwellings, and were gone to some other place. But a certaine Paracoussy, which is one of their petty Kings, or Caciques, sent to him a Present, beseeching him to commaund his men that they should shoote no more towards his dwelling, thinking that the ordinance had caused all this; which occasion he vsed to his owne good, by arrogating that to himselfe which he saw their simplicitie conceiued of him. Within two dayes after this accident, fell such an heat, that the riuer (I thinke) was ready to seeth: and in the mouth of the riuer were found, dead therwith, fishes enow to haue laden 50 carts, wherof issued, by putrefaction, much sickenesse. Calos is neare the Cape of Florida. The King thereof made his subiects beleeue, that his sorceries and charmes were the cause that made the earth bring forth her fruit Loudon. was tolde this of certaine Spa∣niards which liued in those parts. and that he might the easier perswade them, he retired himselfe once or twice a yeare to a certaine house, accompanied with two or three of his friends, where he vsed inchant∣ments. If any man offered to see what he did, it cost him his life. Euery yeare he offe∣reth a man in the time of haruest, which was kept for that purpose, and taken of such Spa∣niards as had suffered shipwracke on that coast. They which further desire to know the riches and commodities of these Countries, may resort to the Authors in this Chapter mentioned. Sir Francis Drake, in the yeare 1586, besides his worthy exploits in other places, tooke the sorts of S. Iohn and S. Augu∣stine; whence he brought Pedro Morales and Nicholas Bgoig, whose relations concerning that country M. Hackelyt hath inserted among other his painfull labours.
Dauid Ingram Dauid In∣gram ap. Hack. te.3.Edit.1. reported many strange things which he saith he saw in these parts, elephants, horses, and beasts twice as bigge as horses, their hinder partes resembling grey-hounds; bulles with eares like hounds; beasts bigger then beares, without head or necke, but hauing their eyes and mouths in their breasts: and an other beast, Crberus, he calls him Colluchio, which is (saith he) the deuill in likenes of a dog, and sometimes of a calfe; with many other matters, wherein he must pardon me, if I be not too prodigal of my saith. He tells also of punishment of adultery by death, the woman cutting the a∣dulterers throat, and the nearest kinsman, hers, after many prayers to the Colluchio, and a further punishment, in that they haue no quicke body buried with them to attend them into the other world, as all others haue. But they that list to beleeue, may consult with the Author. CHAP. VIII. Of the Countries situate Weslward from Florida and Virginia towards the South Sea. HItherto we haue discouered those parts of this Northern America, which trend along the North sea, which the English & French Nations haue most made knowne vnto vs: further westward the midland Countries are not so well known; yet following our Spanish guides we here pre∣sent them from their relations to your view. When as Cortez had con∣quered Mexico, as after followeth to be related, he was made Admi∣rall of the South seas, but the gouernement of Mexico and new Spaine was, with the ti∣tle of Viceroy, giuen to Don Antonio de Mendoza. These two, partly in emulation of each others glorie, partly in hope of enriching themselues, sought to discouer vnknown lands; the one by Sea; the later, both by sea and land. The Viceroy sent In his letter to the Empe∣rour p. Hack. to.3. as he himselfe testifieth, Francis Vasquez de Coronado, and Frier Marco de Nisae, with Stephen a Negro by land: out of whole relations we haue inserted that which concerneth our purpose. Marke Marco de Nisa his rela∣tion. the Frier, and Stephen set forth with cer∣taine Indians in this Discouerie: and Stephen going before, came to Ceuola, as Marke related, where hee was slaine: the Frier followed with his Indian guides, and passed thorough one place where was small store of victuall, because it had not there rained, as the Inhabitants affirmed, in three yeares space. The Indians called him Hayota, that is, a man come from heauen. He passed on further, led by the fame of Cevola, which with o∣ther six cities were reported to be vnder the gouernment of one Lord, & to haue houses of stone, cōsisting of diuers stories, where were many Turqueses, with many other strāge reports of their markets, multitudes, and wealth. But because the Frier came not there for feare of the Negroes entertainment, let vs listen to F. Vasquez his relation. Francis Vasques, who came, saw, and ouercame. An.1540. he went with his army from Culiacan which is 200. leagues from Mexico, & after a long and tedious iourney, he at last arriued in this prouince, and conquered (almost with the losse of himselfe) the first Citie of the seuen, which he called Cranado. Twice he was stricken down with stones from the wall, as he offered to scale the fame. He saith that their houses were of foure or fiue stories or lofts, to which they ascended on ladders: and that they had sellers vnder the ground, good, and paued. But those seuen cities were small townes, all standing in the compasse of foure leagues, all called by that generall name of Cevol or Cibola, and none of them particularly so cal∣led, but hauing other peculiar names, they were of like building. In this towne which he conquered stood 200 houses, walled about, and 300. others not walled. The Inhabi∣tants had before remoued their wiues & wealth to the hill. He reporteth of beasts there, beares, tigres, lions, and sheep, as big as horses, with great hornes, & little tailes, Ounces also & stags. That which the Indians worshipped (as far as they could learne) was the water, which, said they, caused the corne to grow, and maintained their life. Hee found there a garment excellently embroidered with needle-worke. Vasques went hence to Tiguez, to Cicuic, and to Quivira, as F.Lop.c. 212. 213. & 214. Lopes de Gomar a reporteth. This way is full of
crooke-backed oxen. Quivira is in forty degrees, and the Countrey is temperate. They saw ships in the Sea with bare Alcatoazes or Pelicans of gold and siluer in their prowes, laden with merchandise: which they tooke to be of China or Cathay. The men in these parts clothe & shooe themselues with leather: they haue no bread of any kinde of graine: their cheefe food is flesh, which they often eate raw, either for custome, or for lacke of wood. They eate the fatte as they take it out of the oxe, & drink the bloud hote (which of our bulls is counted poison) & the flesh they warme (for they seeth it not) at a fire of oxe-dung. They rather may be said to rauen, then to eate it: and holding the flesh with their teeth, cut it with rasors of stone. They goe in companies as the Scythian Nomades, Tartarian Hords, & many other nations, following the seasons and best pasturings for their oxen. These oxen Oxen of Quivira. are of the bignes and colour of our buls, but their horns ate not so great. They haue a great bunch vpon their shoulders, & more haire on their fore-part, then on the hinder: and it is like wooll. They haue, as it were, a horse-mne on their back-bone, and much haire, & very long, from their knees down∣wards. They haue great tufts of haire on their foreheads, and haue a kinde of beard vn∣der their chinnes and throates. The Males haue very long tailes, with a great knobbe or flocke at the end: so that in some respect they resemble a Lyon, in other the Camels, Horses, Oxen, Sheep, or Goates. They push with their hornes, and in their rage vvould ouertake and kill a Horse: for the Horses fled from them, either for their deformitie, or because they had neuer seene the like. The people haue no other riches: they are vnto them meate, drinke, apparell: their Hides also yeeld them houses, and ropes; their bones, bodkins; their sinewes and haire, thread; their Hornes, Mawes, and Bladders, Vessels; their dung, fire; the Calues-skinnes, budgets, where with they draw and keepe water. Gmara also mentioneth their sheepe, which they so call because they haue fine wooll and hornes: they are as bigge as horses, weigh fifty pound weight a peece. There are also Dogges which will fight with a Bull, and will carry fifty pound weight in Sackes when they go on hunting: for when they remoue from place to place with their heards. The Winter is long and sharpe, with much snow in Cibola, and therefore they then keepe in their Cellers which are in place of Stoves vnto them. In the height of seuen and thirty degrees, at Tiguez, the cold was so extreme, that the horses and men passed ouer the Riuer vpon the Ice: They there tooke a towne Taking of Tiguez. after fiue and forty daies siege, but with much losse, and little gaine. For the Indians killed thirtie horses in a night: and in an other slew certaine Spaniard, sent Ouando vp into the country (they could not tell whether for Sacrifice, or for the shew) & wounded fiftie horses: they drunke Snow in stead of water: and seeing no hope to hold out, made a great fire, and cast therein all they had of worth, and then went all out to make way by by force; where they were all in manner slaine, but not vnreuenged, forcing some Spaniards to accompany them into the Regions of death, and wounding many more, both men and horses. The Snow continueth in these parts halfe the yeare. Quivira is more northerly, and yet more tem∣perate. The Spaniards returned to Mexico in the end of the yeare 1542, to no small griefe of Mendoza, who had spent in this expectation 60000 ducats. Some Friers stay∣ed, but were slaine by the people of Quivira, only one man escaped, to bring newes to Mexico. Sir Francis Drake sailed on the other side of America to forty degrees of northerly latitude, and with cold was forced to retire, although the Sunne followed him all the way from Guatulco hither (which he sailed from the sixt day of Aprill to the fift day of Iune) as if that most excellent and heauenly Light had delighted himselfe in his socie∣tie, and acknowledged him for his sonne, more truly then the Spaniards (whereof anon we shall heate) or that Ouid.Meta∣morph.libr.2. Phaeto of the Poets, not able to compasse this compassing iourney: once, he was so good a scholer and learned the sunnes instruction so well, that he folowed him in a watery field, all that his fiery circle, round about this earthly globe, carried with the mouing winde (as it were aery wings) new starres, ilands, seas, atten∣ding and admiring the English colours: and first of Magellanes victorie (so was his ship cal∣led) had won this victorie, but lost his Generall. any Generall, loosed the girdle of the world and encompassing her in his fortunate armes, enioyed her loue. But I loose
myselfe while I finde him: and yet excellent names, I know not how, compell men to stand awhile, and gaze with admiration, if not with adoration. This our English knight Sir Francis Drake. Hack. l0.3. landed on this coast in thirty eight Degrees, where the Inhabitants presented them∣selues vnto him, with presents of feathers, and kalls of net-worke, which hee requited with great humanitie. The men went naked, the women knit loose garments of bull-ru∣shes about their middles. They came a second time, and brought feathers, and bagges of Tabacco; and after a long Oration of one that was Speaker for the rest, they left their bowes on a hill, and came downe to our men: the women meane while remaining on the hill, tormented themselues, tearing their flesh from their cheekes, whereby it ap∣peared that they were about some sacrifice. The newes being further spread, brought the King thither, which was a man of goodly stature: many tall men attended him: two Ambassadours with a long Speech of halfe an houre, signified his comming before. One, went before the King with a Scepter or Mace, whereon hanged two Crownes with three Chaines: the Crownes were of knit-worke, wrought artificially with diuers co∣loured feathers, the chaines of a bony substance. The King followed clothed in cony∣skinnes: the people came after, all hauing their faces painted with white, blacke, and other colours, euery one bringing his present, euen the very children also. The Scepter∣bearer made a lowd speech of halfe an houre, taking his words from an other which whispered the same vnto him, which with a solemne applause being ended, they came all downe the hil in order without their weapons: the Scepter-bearer beginning a song and dancing, wherein all the rest followed him. The King, and diuers others, made se∣uerall Orations or Supplications to the Generall, to become their King: and the King with a song did set the Crowne on the Generalls head, and put the chaines about his necke, honoring him by the name of Hioh. The common sort leauing the King and his guard, scattered themselues, with their sacrifices, among our people, taking view of all, and to such as best pleased their fancie, which were the yongest, offered their sacrifices, with weeping, scratching, and tearing their flesh, with much effusion of bloud. The En∣glish misliked their deuotions, and directed them to the liuing God: they shewed againe their wounds, whereunto the other applied plaisters and lotions. Euery third day they brought their sacrifices, till they perceiued that they were displeasing. And at the depar∣ture of the English, they (by stealth) prouided a sacrifice, taking their departing verie grieuously. They found heards of Deere feeding by thousands, and the country full of strange co∣nies, headed like ours, with the feet of a Want. and taile of a Cat, hauing vnder their chins, a bagge, into which they gather their meate when they haue filled their body a∣broade. There is no part of the earth, wherein there is not some speciall likelihoode of golde or siluer. The Generall named the Countrey Nova Albion. Nova Albion. In the yere 1581. History of China by Fr. Iuan Gonsalez de Mendosa. Augustine Ruiz, a Frier, learned by the report of certaine Indians called Conchos, that toward the north there were certaine great townes, not hitherto discouered by the Spa∣niards: whereupon, he, with two other companions of his owne Order, and eight soul∣diers, went to seek these parts, and to preach vnto them. They came vnto the Prouince de los Tiguas, two hundred and fifty leagues Northwards from the mines of Saint Bar∣bara, where one of the Friers was slaine by the Inhabitants. This caused the souldiers to returne backe, but the Friers staied still behind. The Franciscans fearing the losse of these their brethren, procured Antonio de Espeio An.de Espeio Nouemb.1512 to vndertake this iourney, with a company of souldiers. He passing the Conchos, the Pasaquates, the Toboses, came to the Patarabueyes, which is a great Prouince, and hath many townes, their houses flat roofed, and built of lime and stone, their streets orderly placed. The people are of great stature, and haue their faces, armes, and legges rased and pownced. Here New Mex∣ico. were ma∣ny Lakes of salt-water, which at a certaine time of the yeare waxeth hard, and becom∣meth very good salt. The Caciques kindly entertained them with victualles and other presents, especially hides, and Chamois skinnes very well dresled, as well as those of Flanders: And passing many dayes iourney further Northwards, they came where the houses were foure stories high, well built, and in most of them, stoues for the winter sea∣son. The men and women weare shooes and boots with good soales of neats leather, a
thing not else where to be seene in the Indies. In this prouince they found many Idoles, which they worshipped: and particularly they had in euery house an oratory for the de∣uill, whereinto they ordinarily carry him meate: and as the Papists erect Crosses vpon high-wayes, so haue this people certaine high Chappells, very well trimmed and pain∣ted, in which they say the deuill vseth to take his case, and to recreate himselfe as hee trauelleth from one towne to an other. In the prouince of Tiguas there were sixteene townes, in one of which the Friers aforesaid were slaine. Six leagues from thence was the prouince Los Quires which worship Idoles as their neighbors: they saw there cer∣taine Canopies, wherein were painted, the Sunne, Moone, and many Starres. It is in 37 ½. Hence they passed, keeping still their northerly course, and found a Prouince cal∣led Cuuames, where were fiue townes, one of which was Chia, which contained eight market places, the houses were plaistered and painted with diuers colours: they pre∣sented them curious mantles, and shewed them rich mettalls. Beyond this they came to the Ameies, and fifteene leagues thence, to Acoma, which is situate vpon a rocke: and hath no other entrance but by a ladder, or paire of staires, hewen in the same rocke: all their water was kept in cisterns. They passed hence to Zuny, which the Spaniards call Cibola, and there found three Spaniards left there by Vasques forty yeres before, which had almost forgotten their owne language. Westward from hence they came to Mo∣hotze, where were exceeding rich mines of siluer, as likewise in some of the other. These parts seeme to incline toward Virginia. Now that we haue heard of the in-land Discoueries by the Spaniards, and that Nova Albion of Sr. Francis Drake, let vs take some view of the Spanish nauigation on these coasts. Cortes the Conquerour of Mexico sent Fran. Vlloa apud Ramus. & Hack. vol.3. Francis de Vlloa with a fleet for discouerie, in the yeare 1539 from Acapulco, which came to Santa Cruz in California. They sai∣led ouer the gulfe, and came to the riuer of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, where they be∣held, on both sides, a goodly Country. I am loth to hold on with them in their voyage, lest I saile from my scope, and leaue the offended Reader behinde me. Here they found in their course burning mountaines, which cast vp fire, ashes, and smoake in great quan∣titie. They encountered with a cruell storme, and being almost out of hope, they saw, as it were, a candle vpon the shrowdes of the Trinitie (one of their shippes) which the Mariners said was Saint Elmo, and saluted it with their songs and prayers. This is the darkenesse of Popery, to worship a naturall light: yea that which hath little more then being, and is an imperfect Meteor, is with them more perfect then humane, and must participate in diuine worships. Without the gulfe of California they found store of great fish, which suffered themselues to bee taken by hand: also they saw weedes floting on the Sea, fifty leagues together, round, and full of gourdes, vnder them were store of fish, on them store of fowle: they grow in fifteene or twenty fadome depth. They caught with their dogges, a beast very fat, haired like a goat, otherwise resembling a deere: in this, neither, that it had foure dugs like vnto a Cowe full of milke. But because they had little dealing with the Inhabitants, I leaue them, and will see what Fernando Fer. Alarchon Alar∣chon can shew vs of his discovery. He was set forth by Antonio de Mendosa the Vice∣roy, in the yeare of our lord 1540, with two shippes. Hee came to the bottome of the Bay of California, and there found a mightie riuer, which ranne with such surious violence, that they could scarce saile against . Heere leauing the shippes with some of his company, hee passed vp with some peeces of ordnance, and two boates: and so drawing the boates with halers, they made vp the riuer called Buena Guia: they were incountered with the Indian Inhabitants, who forbade them landing, but Alarchon hurling his weapons downe, and pulling out certaine wares to giue them, appeased their fury, and caused them also to lay downe their weapons, and receiue of him some trifles, which he gaue them. Two leagues higher many Indians came and called to him: these were decd after a strange manner, some had painted their faces all ouer, some halfe way, others had visards on with the shape of faces: they had holes in their no∣sthrils, whereat certaine pendants hung, others ware shelles, hauing their eares full of
holes, with bones and shels hanging thereat. All of them ware a girdle about their waste whereunto was fastned a bunch of feathers which hung downe behinde like a taile. They carried with them bagges of Tabacco. Their bodies were traced with cole, their haire, cut before, hung down long behind. The women ware bunches of feathers before and behind them. There were foure men in womens apparell. Alarchon perceiued by signes, that the thing they most reuerenced, was the Sunne, and therefore signified vn∣to them, that hee came from the Sunne; whereat they maruelled, and tooke curious view of him with greater reuerence then before; brought him aboundance of foode, first flinging vp part of euery thing into the Aire, and after, turning to him to giue him the other part; offering in their Armes to carry him into their houses, and doing else whatsoeuer hee would haue them. And if any stranger came, they would goe and meet him, to cause him to lay downe his weapons, and if he would not, they would breake them in peeces. Hee gaue the chiefe of them small wares. They needed not pray them to help draw the boate vp the streame, euery one laboured to get hold of the rope: o∣therwise it had beene impossible to haue gotten vp against the current. He caused Cros∣ses to be made and giuen them, with instruction to honour them, which they did with extasie of blinde zeale, kissing them, and lifting them vp, euery one comming for them till he had not paper and stickes enough for that purpose. And as he passed further, hee met with one which vnderstood his interpreter, and as∣ked of him many questions, to which he answered, that he was sent of the Sunne, which the other doubting, because the Sunne went in the skie, he said that at his going down and rising, he came neere the Earth, and there made him in that Land, and sent him hi∣ther to visit this Riuer and the people, and to charge them not to make further warres one vpon another. But why saith the Indian did he send you no sooner? hee answered because before he was but a child. A long dialogue thus passed betwixt them, the issue whereof was that the Indian cried out, they would all receiue him for their Lord, seeing he was the childe of the Sunne, and came to doe them good. This vse did hee make of their superstitious obseruation of the Sunne, which they worshipped because hee made them warme (said they) and caused their croppe to grow, and therefore of all things which they eate, they cast a little vp into the aire to him. They warre one vpon an o∣ther (a thing common to all sauages) for small occasions: the eldest and most valiant guided the army (for in some places they had no Lord;) and of those which they tooke in the warre, some they burned, and from some they plucked out the hearts, and eate them. Alarchon caused a Crosse to be made of timber, commanding his owne people to worship it, and leauing it with the Indians, with instructions euery morning at the Sunne-rise to kneele before it. This they tooke with great deuotion, and would not suffer it to touch the ground, vntill they knew it by questioning, how deepe they should set it, with what composition of gesture to worship it, and the like curiosities of Paga∣nish Christianitie. He was told, that this riuer was inhabited by three and twenty lan∣guages, that they married but one woman to one man, that maides before marriage conuersed not with men, nor talked with them, but kept at home and wrought: adul∣tery was death: they burned the dead: widowes staied halfe a yeare or a whole yeare before they married againe. Euery family had their seuerall governor, other Ruler they had none. The riuer vsed at some-times to ouerflow the bankes. These people told A∣larchon, that in Cevola they had many blew stones, or turqueses, which they digged out of a rocke of stone, and when their Governors died, all their goods were buried with them: that they eate with napkins, many waiting at table: that they killed the Negro before mentioned, because he said he had many brethren, to whome they thought he would giue intelligence, and therefore killed him. An old man tolde him the names of two hundred Lords and people of those parts. This olde man had a son clothed in wo∣mans attire, of which sort they had foure: these served to the Sodomites. sodomitical lusts of all the vnmaried yongmen in the country, & may not thēselues haue to deale with any woman. They haue no reward for this their beaftial trade, but haue liberty to go to any house for their food: when any of them die, the first son that is borne after, succeeds in their nūber.
As for the more Northerly parts, both within Land, and the supposed Strait of A∣nian, with other things mentioned in Mappes, because I know no certaintie of them, I leaue them. The way by sea from these parts to the Philippinas, two of our owne Nation haue passed, whose Voyage, Linschoten also in his third booke largely trea∣teth of the course of these and other Na∣uigations. as also that exact Description of the same, by Franciscode Gualle, a Spanish Captaine and Pilot, Master Haklnit hath related, who hath in these, and other labours of like nature, deeply engaged himselfe for his Coun∣tries good, and of his Countri-men meriteth an euerlasting name, and to me (though knowne at this time, only by those portraitures of his industrious spirit) hath beene as Admirall, holding out the light vnto me in these seas, and as diligent a guide by land, (which I willingly, yea dutifully, acknowledge) in a great part of this my long and wearisome Pilgrimage. CHAP. IX. Of New Spaine, and the conquest thereof by Hernando Cortes. NOw are wee safely arriued out of the South The Spani∣ards call all that the South sea, which is on the other∣side of Ameri∣ca. Sea, and North vn∣knowne Lands, where we haue wildered our selues, and wearied the Reader, in this great and spacious Countrey of New Spaine. New Spaine is all that which lieth betweene Florida and California, and confines on the South, with Guatimala and Iucatan; how it came to be so called, asketh a long discourse, concerning the conquest thereof by Cortes, whose history is thus related. Hernando Gomara: the first part of the Conquest of the West In∣dies, translated into English by T. Nicolas. Cortes was borne at Medellin in Andulozia, a Prouince of Spaine, An. 1485. When he was nineteene yeares old he sailed to the Iland of S. Domingo, where Ouando the Gouernour kindly entertained him. He went to the conquest of Cuba in the yeare 1511. as Clerke to the Treasurer, vnder the conduct of Iames Velasques, who gaue vnto him the Indians of Manicorao, where he was the first that brought vp kine, sheepe and mares, and had heards and flockes of them: and with his Indians he gathe∣red great quantitie of gold, so that in short time he was able to put in two thousand A Castlin is seuen shillings and six pence, as The. Nicolas the Translator saith. Castlins for his stocke, with Andres de Duero a Merchant. At this time Christopher Morante had sent (Anno 1517.) Francis Hernandes de Cordona, who first discouered Xucatan, whence hee brought nothing (except the relation of the Countrey) but stripes: whereupon Iames Velasques in the yeare 1518. sent his kinsman Iohn de Girial∣na, with two hundred Spaniards Of this Voy∣age, Reade P. Martyrs fourth Decade: and Gomara part. I. and of all which followes in this Chap∣ter. in foure shippes: he traded in the Riuer of Tauas∣co, and for trifles returned much gold, and curious workes of feathers, Idols of gold, a whole harnesse or furniture for an armed man, of gold thinne beaten, Eagles, Lions, and other portaitures found in gold, &c. But while Girialua deferred his returne, Ve∣lasques agreed with Cortes to be his partner in the Discouery, which he gladly accep∣ted, and procured licence from the Gouernours in Domingo, and prepared for the Voyage. Velasques afterwards vsed all meanes to breake off, in so much that Cortes was forced to enlarge all his owne stocke, and credit, with his friends in the expediti∣on, and with fiue hundred and fiftie Spaniards in eleuen shippes, set saile the tenth of February 1519. and arriued at the Iland of Acusamil. P. Mart. Dec. 5. Gom. ubisupra, and Cortes his owne letters to the Empe∣rour. The Inhabitants at first fled, but by the kinde entertainment of some that were taken, they returned, and receiued him and his with all kinde offices. They told him of certaine bearded men in Yucatan, whither Cortes sent; and one of them, Geronimo de Aguilar came vnto him, who told him, that by shipwracke at Ia∣maia, their Caruell being lost, twentie of them wandered in the boat without saile, wa∣ter, or bread, thirteen or fourteen daies, in which space the violence of the current had cast them on shore in a Prouince called Maija, where, as they trauelled, seuen died with famine; and their Captaine Valdinia and other foure were sacrificed to the Idols by the
Cacike, or Lord of the Countrey, and eaten in a solemne banquet, and he with six o∣ther were put into a coupe or cage, to be fatned for another Sacrifice. But breaking prison, they escaped to another Cacike, enemy to the former, where all the rest died, but himselfe, and Gonsalo Guerrer a Marriner. He had transformed himselfe into the Indian Cut, boring his nose full of holes, his eares iagged, his face and hands painted, married a wife, and became a Captaine of name amongst the Indians, and would not returne with this Aguilar. Cortes with this new Interpreter passed vp the Riuer Tauasco, called of the former Discouerer, Grijalua, where the Towne that stood thereon, refusing to victuall him, was taken and sacked. The Indians here with enraged, assembled an armie of fortie thousand, but Cortes by his horse and Ordnance preuailed: the Indians thinking the Horse and Rider had beene but one Creature, whose gaping and swiftnesse was terrible vnto them, where∣vpon they submitted themselues. When they heard the Horses ney, they had thought the horses could speake, and demanded what they said: the Spaniards answered, these Horses are sore offen∣ded with you, for fighting with them, and would haue you corrected: the simple In∣dians presented Roses and Hennes to the beasts, desiring them to eate and to pardon them. Cortes purposed to discouer further Westward, because hee heard that there were mines of gold, hauing first receiued their vassallage to the King his Master, to whom (he said) the Monarchie of the Vniuersall did appertaine. These were the first Vassals the Emperour had in New-Spaine. They named the Towne, where these things were done, Victorie, before called Potonchan, containing neere fiue and twentie thousand houses, which are great, made of lime, and stone, and bricke, and some of mud-walls and rafters, couered with straw; their dwel∣ling is in the vpper part of the house, for the moistnesse of the soile. They did eate mans flesh sacrificed. The Spaniards sayled Westward, and came to Saint Iohn de Vlhna, where Teu∣delli, the Gouernour of the Countrey, came to him with foure thousand Indians. He did his reuerence to the Captaine, burning Frankincense (after their custome) and little Strawes, touched in the bloud of his owne bodie: and then presented vnto him Victualls, and Iewells of Gold, and other curious workes of Feathers; which Cortes requited with a Collar of Glasse, and other things of small value. A woman slaue, giuen him at Potonchan, vnderstood their Language, and shee, with Aguilar, were his interpreters. Cortes professed himselfe the seruant of a great Emperour, which had sent him thither, whose power he so highly extolled, that Teudilli maruelled, thinking there had beene no such Prince in the world as his Master and Soucraigne, the King of Mexico, whose Vassall he was, named Mutezuma. To him he sent the representations of these bearded men, and their Horses, Apparrell, Weapons, Ordinance, and other rarities, painted in Cotton Clothes, their Shippes, and Num∣bers. These painted Cottons he sent by Posts, which deliuered them from one to ano∣ther with such celeritie, that in a day and night the message came to Mexico, which was two hundred and tenne myles distant. Cortes had demaunded, whether Mute∣zuma had Gold? Tendelli affirmed, and Cortes replyed, That he and his fellowes had a disease of the heart, whereunto Gold was the best remedie. Mutezuma sent him many Cotton cloathes of diuers colours, many tuffes of feathers, two wheeles, the one of siluer, with the signe of the Moone, and the other of gold, made like the Sunne, which they hold for Gods, and giue vnto them the colours of the mettalls most like them. Euery wheele was two yards and a halfe broad. These with other parts, of the present were esteemed worth twentie thousand Ducats. Mutezuma also professed ioy, to heare of so great a Prince, and so strange
people, and promised prouision of all necessaries; but was very vnwilling that Cor∣tes should come to see him, as he pretended. Yet Cortes persisted in that his desire of seeing Mutezuma, that he might further acquaint himselfe with the knowledge of those parts. The silly Indians hauing neuer seene such strange sights, came daily to the Camp to see them: and when they heard the Ordnance discharged, they fell downe flat, thin∣king the heauens had fallen: the shippes they thought were the god of the aire, called Quezalcouolt, which came with the Temples on his backe, for they daily looked for him. Amongst the rest, or rather aloofe off from the rest, were certaine Indians of differing habite, higher then the other, and had the gristles of their noses slit, hanging ouer their mouthes, and rings of Iet and Amber hanging thereat: their nether lippes also bored, and in the holes rings of gold and Turkesle-stones, which weighed so much, that their lippes hung ouer their chinnes, leauing their teeth bare. This vgli∣nesse they accounted gallantrie, and such vncouth deformitie to be the onely braue∣ry. And thou Gallant that readest and deridest this madnesse of Fashion, if thine eyes were not dazeled with lightnesse (light I cannot call it) of selfe-reflected Vanitie, mightest see as Monster-like fashions at home, and more fashionly monster of thy selfe; thy cloathes and oathes, thy gestures and vestures, make thy naked Deformitie worse then their thus deformed nakednesse: both indeed seeme to haue receiued some hellish character (if there may be bodily representation) of that old Serpent in thse new fashions, striuing who shall shape himselfe neerest to that mishapen vglinesse, wherein the Indian iagges himselfe out of humane lineaments, the other swaggers himselfe further out of all ciuill and Christian ornaments. But these fashion-mongers haue made me almost out of my fashion, and to forget my selfe, in remembring their forgetfulnesse. These Indians of this new Cut, Cortes caused to come to him, and learned that they were of Zempoallan, a Citie distant thence a dayes iourney, whom their Lord had sent to see what Gods were come in those Teucallis, that is, Temples (so, it see∣meth, they called the shippes:) which held no conuersation with the other Indians, as being not subiect to Mutezuma, but onely as they were holden in by force. Hee gaue them certaine toyes, and was glad to heare that the Indians of Zempoallan, and other their neighbours were not well affected to Mutezuma, but readie, as farre as they durst, to entertaine all occasions of warre with him. He sailed from thence to Panuco, and passed the riuer farther, till he came to a little Towne, where was a Temple, with a little Tower, and Chappell on the toppe, ascen∣ded by twentie steppes, in which they found some Idols, many bloudie papers, and much mans bloud, of those which had beene sacrificed; he blocke also whereon they cut open those Sacrifices, and the razors made of flint, wherewith they opened their breasts, which strucke the Spaniards with some horrour and feare. They passed a little further, and there hauing taken possession, in the Emperours name, of the whole Countrey, they founded the Towne Delavera Crux, Cort resigning his authoritie, and Officers being elected; and lastly, all with generall consent appointing Cortez their Captaine. Cortez went forward to Zempoallan, where he was solemnely receiued and lod∣ged in a great house of lime and stone, whited with plaister, that shined in the Sunne, as if it had beene siluer; so did the siluer conceits of the Spaniards imagine, the desire of that mettall hauing made such an impression in their imagination, that they told Cortes before hee came at it, they had seene a house with walls of siluer. Heere, and at Chiauiztlan, Cortes incited them to rebell against Mutezuma, and to become seruants to the Spaniards, which they did; and he vnder-hand so wrought, that Mutezuma tooke him for his friend. All his intent was to fish in troubled waters, and to set them both by the ears, that he might watch opportunity to benefit himselfe. His own people rebelled, some of whom
he chastised with the halter and the whippe for example to the rest: and after caused all his shippes to bee sunke closely, that they should not minde any returne. Hee left an hundred and fiftie men for the guard of the new Towne, vnder Pedro de Henrico, and with foure hundred Spaniards, fifteene horses, and six peeces of Artillery, and thirteene hundred Indians, they went from Zempoallan, and came to Zaclotan, the Lord whereof was Olintler the subiect of Mutezuma, who to testifie his ioy, and to honour Cortes, commanded fiftie men to be sacrificed, whose bloud they saw new and fresh. They carried the Spaniards on their shoulders, sitting on beeres, such as vse to carrie dead men. He bragged as much of the power of Mutezuma, as the Spaniards of their Emperour. Hee said he had thirtie vassals, each of which was able to bring into the field an hundred thousand men of warre, and sacrificed twentie thousand men yearely to the gods: in this he somewhat exceeded; the other was true, although some yeares the sacrifices also were thought to amount to fiftie thousand. This Towne was great, and had thirteene Temples, in each of which were many Idols of stone of diuers fashions, before whom they sacrificed men, Doues, Quailes, and other things with great perfumes and veneration. Heere Mutezuma had fiue thousand souldiers in garrison. Cortes passed from thence to Mexico by the frontiers of Tlaxcallon, which were enemies to Mutezuma, whom he might easily haue ouercome, but reserued partly for the exercise of his sub∣iects to the warre, and partly for the sacrifices to his gods. These ioyned an hundred and fiftie thousand men against Cortes, taking him for Mutezuma's friend: and yet euery day sent him Guinney-cockes and bread, partly to espie his strength, and partly in a brauery, lest their glory should be obseured in the conquest of men already steruen. But when in many skirmishes and fights they could not preuaile against that hand∣full of Spaniards, they thought they were preserued from harme by inchantments: and sent him three presents with this message; That if he were that rigorous god which eateth mans flesh, he should eat those fiue slaues which they brought him, and they would bring him more: if he were the meeke and gentle god, behold frankinsence, and feathers: if he were a mortall man, take heere fowle, bread, and cherries. At last they made peace with him, and submitted their Citie to him. Their Citie Tlaxcallan was great, planted by a Riuers side, which issued into the South-sea. It had foure streets, each of which had their Captaine in the time of warre. The gouernment was an Aristocratie, hating Monarchie no lesse then tyranny. It had eight and twentie Villages, and in them an hundred and fiftie thousand hous∣holds, very poore, but good warriours. They had one market-place so spacious, that thirtie thousand persons in a day came thither to buy and sell by exchange: for money they had none. Mutezuma had sent before to Cortes, and promised tribute to the Emperour, what∣soeuer should be imposed; onely he would not haue him come to Mexico. And now he sent againe, that he should not trust that new friendship with the beggerly Nation of Tlaxcallan, and they againe counselled him not to aduenture himselfe to Mute∣zuma. Cortes held his determination for Mexico, and being accompanied with many of the Tlaxcantlexas he went to Chololla, a little from whence Mutezuma had prepared an armie to entrappe him in the way; but he finding the trechery, it redounded vpon Cholollois, the same day they had thought to haue executed the same vpon him. For this end they had sacrificed ten children, fiue males, and as many females, three yeares old, to Quezalcouatl their god, which was their custome when they began their warres. He out-going them in their owne art of subtiltie, entrapped their Cap∣taines in Counsell, and sent his armie to spoile the Citie, where were slaine many thou∣sands. There were twentie Gentle-men, and many Priests which ascended vp to the high Tower of their Temple, which had an hundred and twenty steppes, where they were burned, together with their gods and Sanctuary.
This Citie had twentie thousand housholds within the walls, and as many in the Suburbs. It shewed outward very faire and full of Towers, for there were as many Temples as dayes in the yeare, and euery one had his Tower. The Spaniards counted foure hundred Towers. It was the Citie of most deuotion in all India, whither they trauelled from many places farre distant in Pilgrimage. Their Cathedrall Temple was the best and highest in all New Spaine, with an hundred and twentie steppes vp to it. Their chiefe god was Quezalcouatl, god of the Aire, who was (they say) foun∣der of their Citie, being a Virgin, of holy life and great penance. Hee instituted fa∣sting, and drawing of bloud out of their eares and tongues, and left precepts of Sa∣crifices. He neuer ware but one garment of Cotton, white, narrow, and long, and vpon that a mantle, beset with certaine red crosses. They haue certaine greene stones which were his, and are kept for great reliques: one of them is like an Apes head. Eight leagues from Chololla is the hill Popocatepec, or smoake-hill, which the Earth seemeth to haue erected as a Fort to encounter and assault the aire: now with smoakie mists endeuouring to choake his purer breath, another while with violent flames, and naturall fire-workes threatening to ioyne league with his elder and superiour brother to disinherit him: sometimes with showers of ashes and imbers, as it were, putting out the eyes, and sometimes with terrible and dreadfull thunders, rending the eares of that Airy Element; alwayes (such is the euent of warre) hurting and wa∣sting it selfe, to endamage the enemy. The Indians thought it a place of Purgatorie, whereby tyrannicall and wicked officers were punished after their death, and after that purgation passed into glo∣rie. The Spaniards aduentured to see it, but two onely held on their iourney, and had there beene consumed, had they not by a rocke beene shadowed from the violent e∣ruption of the fire which then happened. It chanced that the Earth, weary it seemeth of the warre, as hauing spent her store and munition, agreed on a truce which continued ten yeares: but in the yeare 1540. it brake forth into more violent hostilitie then before, quaking and renting it selfe with vnbridled passion: and whereas the Aire had alwayes a snowie garrison about her high tops, and frontires to coole and quench her fiery showers, yet these did but kindle a greater flame, the ashes whereof came to Huexozinco, Quelaxcopan, Tepia∣cac, Chololla and Tlaxcallan, and other places, ten, or as some say, fifteene leagues distant, and burned their herbes in their gardens, their fieldes of corne, trees, and clothes that they laid a drying. The Vulean, Crater, or mouth whence the fire issued, is about halfe a league in compasse. The Indians kissed their garments (an honour done vnto their gods) which had aduentured themselues to this dreadfull spe∣ctacle. Cortes drawing neere to Mexico, Mutezuma feared, saying, These are the peo∣ple which our gods said should come and inherit this Land. He went to his Oratorie, and there shut vp himselfe alone, abiding eight dayes in prayer and fasting, with Sa∣crifice of many men, to aslake the furie of his offended deities. The Diuell biddes him not to feare, and that he should continue those bloudy Rites, assuring him that hee should haue the gods Vitziliputzli and Tescatlipuca to preserue him, saying, That Que∣zalcouatle permitted the destruction at Chololla, for want of that bloudie sacrifice. Cortes pasted a hill six miles in height, where by the difficultie of the passage, and of the cold (being alway couered with snow) the Mexicans might easily haue preuented his passing further. Hence he espied the lake, whereon Mexico and many other great Townes did stand, Iztacpallapan a Towne of ten thousand housholds, Coyoacan of six thousand, Vizilopuchtli of fiue thousand. These Townes are adorned with many Temples and Towers, that beautifie the Lake. From Iztacpalapan to Mexico is two leagues, all on a faire causey, with ma∣ny draw-bridges, thorow which the water passeth, Mutezuma receiued Cortes with all solemnitie on the eight of Nouember 1519. into this great Citie, excusing himselfe of former vnkindnesses the best hee could. Of his house, and Maiestie,
and the diuine conceit the people had of him, we shall speake after more fully, as al∣so of the Temples, Priests, Sacrifices and other remarkeable things of Mexico. Mutezuma prouided all things necessary for the Spaniards and Indians that atten∣ded them: euen beddes of flowers were made, in place of litter for their horses. But Cortes disquieted with those thoughts which commonly attend Ambition, discontent in the present, hopes and feares of the future, vsed the matter so, that he tooke Mu∣tezuma prisoner, and detained him in the place appointed for the Spaniards lodging; with a Spanish guard about him, permitting him otherwise to deale in all priuate or publike affaires, as before. Hereupon Cacama, Lord of Tezcuco, nephew to Mute∣zuma, rebelled, but by trechery of his owne people was presented prironer to Mute∣zuma. He, after this, summoned a Parliament, where he made an Oration vnto his sub∣iects, saying, That he and his predecessours were not naturalls of the Countrey, but his fore-fathers came from a farre Countrey; and their King returned againe, and said, he would send such as should rule them. And he hath now sent these Spaniards, saith he. Hereupon he counselled them to yeeld themselues vassals to the Emperour, which they did at his command, though with many teares on his part and theirs, at this fare∣well of their libertie. Mutezuma presently gaue to Cortes, in the name of tribute, great quantitie of gold and other iewels, which amounted to sixteene hundred thou∣sand Castlins of gold, besides siluer. Cortes had hitherto a Continuall victorie in Mexico without any fight: but newes was brought him of Pamphilo de Naruais, who was sent with eightie horse, and some hundreths of Spaniards by Velasques, to interrupt the proceedings of Cortes: who lea∣uing two hundred men in Mexico, with two hundred and fiftie other came suddenly in the night, and tooke Naruaes Prisoner, and returned to Mexico with Naruaes his company, now his followers also, where he found his men exceedingly distressed by the Citizens, for a murther committed in the great Temple at a solemne Feast, where in a religious daunce, they were slaine, for the rich garments and iewels they ware, by the Spaniards. Cortes came in good time for the reliefe of his men: and Mutezuma caused the Mexicans to bridle their rage, which presently was renued, and when Mutezuma was againe by his guardians, the Spaniards, caused to speake to the people: a blow of a stone on his temples wounded him, whereof three daies after he died. Cortes had some thousands of the Tlaxoltecas to helpe him, but was driuen to flee from Mexico with all his Spaniards and Indians, which he did closely in the night, but yet an alarme was raised, and the bridges being broken, much slaughter of his people was made by the Mexicans, and all his treasure in manner lost. They pursued after him also, and had two hundred thousand in the field: when it was Cortes his good happe to slay the Standard-bearer, whereupon the Indians forsooke the field. This battell was fought at Otumpan. At Tlazcallan, hee and his were kindly entertained; they had prepared before fiftie thousand men to goe to Mexico for his helpe, and now they promised him all offices of loyaltie and seruices. With their helpe he subdued Tepeacac: and built certaine Brigandines, or Frigats, which were carried many leagues on the backes of those Indians, and there fastened and finished, without which hee could neuer haue wonne Mexico. In Tezcuco certaine Spaniards had beene taken, sacrificed and eaten, which Cor∣tes now reuenged on them. Eight thousand men had carried the loose peeces and timber of this Nauy, guarded with twentie thousand Tlaxcallans, and a thousand Tamemez or Porters, which carried victualls attending. They caiked them with Tow, and for want of Tallow. -Oyle, they vsed mans grease, of such as had beene slaine in the warres. Fo the Indians vsed to take out the grease of their sacrifices. Cortes had heere nine hundred Spaniards, of which fourescore and six were horsemen, three cast peeces of iron, fifteene small peeces of brasse, and a thousand weight of powder, and 100000. Indian souldiers on his side. He made a sluce or trench aboue twelue foot broad, and two fathome deep, halfe a league long, in which 40000
men wrought fiftie dayes. Hee launched his Vessells, and soone ouercame all the Canoas of the Lake, of which were reckoned in all fiue thousand. The Spaniards brake the Conduits of sweet water, wherewith the Citie was wont to bee serued. Quahutimoc, now the new King of Mexico, receiuing encouragement from the di∣uellish Oracle, caused to breake downe the Bridges, and to exercise whatsoeuer wit or strength could doe in defence of his Citie, sometimes conquering, sometimes (as is the doubtfull chaunce of warre) conquered. Cortes had in Tezcuco ordained a new King, a Christian Indian, of the royall bloud, who much assisted him in this siege. The Spaniards being Lords of the Lake, and of the Causeyes, by helpe of their Galliots and Ordinance, they fired a great part of the Citie. One day the Mexi∣cans had gotten some aduantage, and thereupon celebrated a Feast of Victorie. The Priests went vp into the Towers of Tlatelulco, their chiefe Temple, and made their perfumes of sweet Gummes, in token of victorie, and sacrificed fortie Spaniards, which they had taken captiues, opening their breasts, and plucking out their hearts for offerings to their Idols, sprinkling their bloud in the Ayre, their fellowes looking on, and not able to reuenge it. They slew likewise many Indians, and foure Spani∣ards of Alvarado's companie, whome they ate in the open sight of the Armie. The Mexicans daunced, dranke themselues drunke, made bone-fires, strucke vp their Drummes, and made all solemne expressings of ioy. Dread, Disdaine, and all the Fu∣ries that passion or compassion could coniure vp, had now filled the Spaniards hearts and their Indian partakers: and Cortes, that hitherto had hoped to reserue some part of the Citie, now did the vtmost that Rage and Reuenge could effect, helped no lesse within with Famine and Pestilence, then with Sword and Fire without. At last Mexico is rased, the Earth and Water sharing betwixt them what the Fire had left, and all which had sometime chalenged a loftie inheritance in the Ayre. Their King also was taken; all that mightie State subuerted: and as the Mexicans before had prophecied, That the Tlaxantleca's should againe build the Citie, if conquered, for them; if conquerors, for the Spaniards. It was re-builded with a hundred thousand houses, fairer and stronger then before. The Siege lasted three moneths, and had therein two hundred thousand Indians, nine hundred Spaniards, fourescore Horses, seuenteene Peeces of Ordinance, thirteene Galliots, and six thousand Cannons. Fif∣tie Spaniards were slaine, and six Horses: of the Mexicans a hundred thousand, be∣sides those which died of Hunger and Pestilence. This was effected Anno 1521, on the thirteenth of August, which for that cause is kept festiuall euerie yeare. CHAP. X. Of the auncient inhabitants of New Spaine, and the Historie of their Kings. HAuing now declared the subuersion of this State and Kingdome by the Spaniards, I hold it not amisse to looke backe vnto the first peo∣ple which here inhabited, with the beginnings and proceedings of the Mexican Empire. The Botero, part. . first inhabitants of New Spaine were very barbarous and sauage, which ed onely by Hunting, and for this reason were called Chieh . Ies Acosta, l.7. Lop de Gom part. 1. They liued naked, solitarie in the Mountaines, without Tillage, Policie or any Religious Ceremonies: their wiues followed the same Hunting exercise, leauing their children tied in a Panier of Reedes to the boughes of some Tree. They did eate what they got in Hunting, raw. They eate also Snakes and Lizards, which they offered likewise in sacrifice to the Sunne, whome onely they worshipped, and that without any Image: they offered to him
Fowles, from the Butterflie to the Eagle. And some remnants of the like beastly men are yet found, which doe great hurt, and will not, by either cunning or force of the Spaniards, be reduced to any other course. They seeme to haue learned the sauage na∣ture of the wilde Beasts, of whome and with whome they liue. By this meanes it came to passe, that this wilde mountainous people left the best and most fertile part of the Countrey vnpeopled, which certaine remote Nations possessed, whome they called Nauatalcas signifieth well∣speakers. Navatalcas, for their ciuilitie. These came from those Northerne parts, which now they call New Mexico. The Navatalcas paint their beginning and first Territorie in manner of Caues (because of their seuen Tribes) and men comming out of them. By the supputation of their Bookes this departure was aboue eight hundred yeares since, and (by reducing to our accompt) about the yeare of our Lord 720. Fourescore yeares they stayed on the way, the cause whereof they ascribe to their Gods, which spake visibly to them, and bad them seeke new Lands that had such signes as they notified. Thus they proceeded in seeking those signes, and peopled the best parts, still re∣mouing their habitations as they found more fertile Countries, leauing onely the a∣ged, sicke, and wearie, with a few others to remaine in the former. And by these lei∣surely proceedings they entred the Land of Mexico, about the yeare 902, after our accompt. Those seuen Nations came not all at once; but first the Suchimilcos, next the Chalcas, and thirdly the Tepanetans, fourthly those of Tescuco, after them the Tlalluicans: the sixt were the Tlascaltecans, which helped the Spaniards to conquer Mexico, and therefore are exempted from tribute to this day. These expelled, as their Histories say, certaine Gyants, whome in pretence of friendship they had inuited to a banquet, and in their drunkennesse stole away their weapons, and slew them. Neither doth this seeme a fable; for at this day are found dead mens bones, of incredible big∣nesse. I saw a tooth (sayth Acosta) at Mexico, in the yeare 1586, as bigge as the fist of a man, and according to this, all the rest was proportionable. Three hundred and two yeares after the first transmigration, those of the seuenth Caue or Line arriued, which is the Mexican Nation: they worshipped the Idoll Vitzliputzli, and the Deuill spake and gouerned this Nation. He promised to make them Lords ouer all, which the other six Nations possessed, and to giue them a Land plentifull in riches: where∣upon they went forth, carrying their Idoll with them in a Coffer of Reedes, sup∣ported by foure of their principall Priests, with whome he talked, and communi∣cated his Oracles and Directions. He likewise gaue them Lawes, and taught them the Ceremonies and Sacrifices they should obserue. And euen as the pillar of Cloud and Fire conducted the Israelites in their passage through the Wildernesse, so this apish Deuill gaue them notice when to aduaunce forwards, and when to stay. The first thing they did wheresoeuer they came, was to build a house or Tabernacle for their Vitzliputzli, which they set alway in the middest of their Campe, and there placed the Arke in the middest of the Altar. This done, they sowed the Land, and if their God commanded to gather, they did so, and if, to raise their Campe, they obey∣ed, leauing the aged, ticke, and weary, to gather the fruits, and to dwell there. The chiefe Captaine whom they followed was called Moxi, whence came the name of their Mexico and Mexicans. Citie and Nation. Their Idoll perswaded them, when some were bathing themselues in certaine Lakes, to remoue the Campe closely, and steale away their cloathes: whereat they which were thus forsaken, changed their language and man∣ner of life, retaining alway their hatred to the Mexicans. They peopled the Prouince Mechouacan, From hence to Mexico is fiftie leagues, and vpon the way is Malinalco, which they say was peopled by a Witch and her family, whom by the commande∣ment of their god they left behind, closely remouing the armie by night. They stayed in a place called Tuta, where by stopping a Riuer, they drowned a Plaine, and planted it round with Willowes and other Trees; and many liking the place, talked of stay∣ing there: whereat their God offended, threatened the Priests, and in the night slew those which had consulted of staying. Their hearts were found pulled out, and their stomackes opened, which, after that, they obserued in their Sacrifices. The Mexicans,
by the aduise of their Idoll, proceeded, and by force made way through the Chalcas, and sent to the Lord of Culhuacan, who graunted them the place of Ticaapan to dwell in, which was full of Snakes and venomous Beasts, which by the helpe of their God they tamed. He would not suffer them to stay there, but commaunded them to proceede, and to seeke forth a woman, whome they should name the Goddesse of Discord. Whereupon they sent to the King of Culhuacan, to demaund his daughter to be Queene of the Mexicans, and mother of their God; who easily condescended, and sent his daughter gorgeously attyred. The same night shee arriued, by order of their God, she was murthered, and flayed, and a young man was couered with her skinne, with her apparrell thereon, and being placed neere the Idoll, was consecra∣ted a Goddesse, and mother of their God, euer after worshipping the same, making an Idoll which they call Toccy, that is, our Grandmother. The King of Culhuacan hereupon warred against them, and chased them out of those parts, by which meanes they came to the place where Mexico now is. Here certaine old Priests or Sorcerers entring into a place full of water-Lillies, they met with a very faire and cleare cur∣rent of Water, with Trees, Medowes, Fish, and other things, all very white, which were the signes their God had giuen them of their promised Land. In the night fol∣lowing, Vitzliputzli appeared in a dreame to an auncient Priest, saying, That they should goe seeke out a Tunal in the Lake, which grew out of a stone, vpon which they should see an Eagle feeding on smal Birds, which they should hold for the place where their Citie should be built, to become famous through the world. Hereupon the next day they all assembled, and diuiding themselues into bands, made that search with great diligence and deuotion. In their search they met with the former water-course, not white (as it was then) but redde like bloud, diuiding it selfe into two streames, one of which was an ob∣scure Azure. At last they espied the Eagle with wings, displayed toward the Sunne, compassed about with many rich feathers of diuerse colours, and holding in his Tal∣lons a goodly bird. At this sight they fell on their knees, and worshipped the Eagle, with great demonstrations of ioy and thankes to Vitzliputzli. For this cause they called the Citie, which there they founded, Mexico Te∣noxtiltan. Tenoxtiltan, which signifies, Tunal on a stone; and to this day carrie in their Armes an Eagle vpon a Tunal, with a bird in his Tallon. The next day following, by common consent, they made an Heremitage, adioyning to the Tunal of the Eagle, that the Arke of their God might rest there, till they might haue meanes to build him a sumptuous Temple. This they made of Flagges and Turfes, couered with Straw. Afterwards they consulted to buy of their neighbours Stone, Timber, Lime, in exchange of Fish, Fowles, Frogges, and other things which they hunted for in the Lake: by which meanes they procuring necessaries, built a Chappell of Lime and Stone, and laboured to fill vp part of the Lake with rubbish. The Idoll commaunded, that they should diuide themselues into foure principall quarters about this house, and each part build therein: to which he enioyned cer∣taine Gods of his appointment, called Calpultetco, which is, Quarter-Gods. This was the beginning of Mexico. This diuision seemed not equall to some of the Ancients, who valued their deserts farre aboue their allotted portion, who therefore separated themselues, and went to Tlatedulco: whose practises against the Mexicans caused them to chuse a King, to which Soueraignetie was chosen Acamapitzli, Nephew to the King of Culhuacan, and of the Mexican bloud by the fathers side. Him by embassage they demaunded, and obtained in the name of their God, with this answere from the King of Culhua∣can: Let my grand-child goe to serue your God, and be his Lieutenant, to rule and go∣uerne his creatures, by whome wee liue; who is the Lord of Night, Day, and Windes: Let him goe and be Lord of the Water and Land, and possesse the Mexican Nati∣on, &c. Hee was solemnely welcommed by the Mexicans: Welcome them art (sayth
an Many of these Orations are expressed in Acosta's se∣uenth booke at large, full of wittie inuenti∣ons and Rhe∣toricall flou∣rishes. Oratour vnto him in their name) to this poore House and Citie, amongst these Weedes and Mudde, where thy poore Fathers, Grandfathers, and Kinsfolkes endure what it pleaseth the Lord of things created. Remember Lord, thou commest to be our defence, and to be the resemblance of our Vitzliputzli, not to rest thy selfe, but to endure a new charge: with many words of that effect, expressed in the Mexican Histories, reserued by tradition; the children to that end learning them by heart, and these be∣ing as presidents to them which learned the Art Oratorie. After this, they were sworne, and he crowned. The Crowne was like that of the Dukes of Venice. His name Acamapixtli signifieth a handfull of Reedes, and therefore they carrie in their Armories a hand, holding many Arrowes of Reedes. The Mexicans at this time were tributaries to the Tapanccans, whose chiefe Ci∣tie was Azcapuzalco: who iudging, according to the nature of Enuie and Suspiti∣on, that they were so much weaker, how much the stronger they saw their neigh∣bours, thought to oppresse them by a strange policie, in imposing an vncouth, and (in shew) impossible tribute: which was, that they should bring the Tapunecan King a Garden, planted and growing in the water. In this their distresse, Vitzliputzli taught them to doe it, by casting earth vpon Reedes and Grasse layed in the Lake, and planting in this mouing Garden Maiz, Figges, Gourds, and other things, which at the time appointed they carried growing and ripe: a thing often since proued in that Lake, emulous no lesse of that glorie, to be accounted one of the Wonders in that New World, then those pensill Gardens, towred vp in the Ayre at Babylon, both here and there the reason of man, according to his naturall priuiledge, subiecting to his vse the most rebellious Elements of Ayre and Water. Acamapixtli, the Mexican King, after he had reigned fortie yeares, died, leauing it to their choise to chuse his successour. They chose his sonne Vitzilovitli, which signifieth a rich Feather: They annointed him with an Ointment, which they call Diuine, being the same where with they annoint their Idoll. Of their Coronation thus Lop de Gom. part.I. Lopez de Gomara sayth, That this was done by the High Priest, attyred in his Pontificalibus, attended with many others in Surplices, the Oyntment was as blacke as Inke. They blessed him, and sprinkled him foure times with holy Water, made at the time of the consecration of their God. Then they put vpon his head a Cloth, painted with the bones and skulls of dead men, clothed him with a blacke garment, and vpon that a blew, both painted with figures of Skulls and Bones. Then did they hang on him Laces, and bottles of Pouders, whereby he was deliuered from diseases and Witchcrafts. Then did he offer Incense to Vitzli∣putzli, and the High Priest tooke his Oath, for the maintenance of their Religion; to maintaine Iustice, and the Lawes; to cause the Sunne to giue his light, and the Clouds to raine, and the Earth to be fruitfull, &c. Lastly, followed the acclamati∣ons of the people, crying, GOD saue the King, with daunces, &c. He being crowned, and hauing receiued homage of his subiects, obtained the King of Azcapuzalco his daughter to wife, by whom he had a sonne called Chimalpo∣poca, and procured a relaxation of tribute from his father in law. He was deuout in his superstitions: hauing raigned thirteene yeares, hee died. His sonne then but ten yeares old, was chosen in his roome, but was soone after slaine by the inhabitants of Azcapuzalco. The Mexicans enraged with this iniurie, assembled themselues, and an Orator, among many other words tells them, That the Sunne is eclipsed and darke∣ned for a time, but will returne suddenly in the choise of another King. They agreed vp∣on Izcoalt, which signifieth a Snake of Rasors, the source of Acamapixtls their first King. The common people were earnest with this new King for peace with the Tapanecans, for the obtaining whereof they would carrie their God in his Litter for an intercessor. This was hindered by Tlacaellec the Kings Nephew, a resolute and valiant young man, who also, with perill of his life, vndertooke an Embassage to Azcapuzalco, and there defied the King, annointing him with the ointment of the
dead, after their manner. The commons of Mexico were herewith offended, and to pacifie them, the King indented with them, That if he lost the Field, they should eate him and his Nobles: they on the other side promising, if he did ouercome, to become his tributaries (for before they enioyed much freedome) and to labour in his Fields and Houses, and to become his seruants in Warre and Peace. In fine, such was the valour of Tlacaellec the Generall, that the enemies were ouerthrowne, their Citie sac∣ked, and the remainder of them made tributarie, the lands and goods of the conque∣red being diuided among the Conquerours, and some reserued to each quarter of Mexico, for the vse of their Sacrifices. Cuyacan had the next place in the Mexican Conquests: who hauing inuited the Mexicans to a banquet, in the end thereof sent for the last Seruice, womens habites, which they forced them to put on: but Izcoalt and Tlacaellec made them know, by their ruine, the manhood of the Mexicans. They subdued also the Suchimilcos, and Cuitlavaca, a Citie in the Lake; Teseuco yeelded it selfe. Izcoalt after twelue yeares died, and Moteçuma the first was chosen in his stead. Presently after his Election they conducted him to the Temple with a great trayne, where, before the Diuine Harth-(so called in regard of the continuall fire there kept) they enthronized him. The King there drew bloud from his eares and legges with a Griffons tallons as a Sacrifice, and was congratulated with many Orations of the Priests, Ancients, and Captaines. And whereas before they had accustomed, in their Elections, to make great Feasts and Daunces, and wasted many Lights; He brought in the custome, personally to make warre in some Prouince, thence to procure Sacri∣fices, to feast their Gods and men. This he performed at Chalco, from whence hee brought many Captiues, which on the day of his Coronation were sacrificed and eaten. At this Feast all his Tributes were brought in with great solemnitie, each Prouince marching by it selfe, besides innumerable Presents. All commers were bountifully entertained, and the poore were clad with new garments, giuen them by the King. The Chalcas had taken a brother of Moteçuma, and would haue made him their King, but he enioyning them to make a high Scaffold, ascended thereon, and telling them, the Gods would not permit, that to be a King, he should be a traytor vnto his Countrey, cast downe himselfe; whose death Moteçuma reuenged with the ruine of that whole Nation, conquering further vnto the North and South Seas, by the coun∣sell and courage of Tlacaellec. This King instituted new Ceremonies, and encreased the number of the Priests: he built the great Temple of Vitzliputzli & sacrificed great numbers of men at the dedication. Hauing raigned eight and twentie yeares, hee died. Tlacaellec was chosen his successour by the foure Deputies, and the two Lords of Tescuco and Tacuba (these were the Electors) but refused the Empire, as being fitter for the common good, as an instrument to another, then if himselfe welded the Scep∣ter. At his nomination they chose Ticocic; sonne of the late King, and piercing his nosthrills, for an ornament put an Emerald therein. He, in seeking captiues for the solemnitie of his Coronotion, lost more of his owne people, and after foure yeares was poysoned by his male content subiects. Axayaca his brother succeeded, altogether of another spirit. In his time died Tlacaellec, chiefe author of the Mexican greatnesse, whom before in his age they vsed to carrie in his Chaire, on mens shoulders, to councell. He was buried more solemn∣ly then any of the Kings, and his sonne was made Generall for the warres. Axayaca conquered Tequantepec, two hundred leagues from Mexico, thence to furnish the bloudie solemnities of his Coronation. He added to his Conquests Guatulco on the South Sea: in single combate ouercame the Lord of Tlarelulco, and subdued those Mexican-enemies of the Mexicans, setting fire on their Citie and Temple. After ele∣uen yeares he died, and Antzal the eight King was chosen. He punished the pride of Quaxulatlan, a rich Prouince, with those captiues, to celebrate his Coronation-Feast, and extended his dominion to Guatimala, three hundred leagues from Mexico. Hee
much adorned his Royall Citie, pulling downe the old houses, and in their roome e∣rected fairer. He let in a course of water to the Citie, because that of the Lake was muddie. But because they of Cuyoacan vsed these waters, the chiefe man of that Citie, which was a great Magician, sought to hinder it, whereby the King being pro∣uoked, sent to attach him. He escaped by his Protean Arts; now appearing like an Eagle, the second time like a Tygre, the third like a Serpent. But at last he was taken and strangled, and the Mexicans forced a Channell, whereby the water might passe to their Citie, the Priests meane-while casting Incense on the bankes, sacrificing the bloud of Quailes; others winding their Cornets: and one of the chiefe went attyred in a habite like to the Goddesse of the Waters, which was saluted and welcommed by all the people. All which things are painted in the Annales of Mexico: which Booke is now in the Vatican Librarie at Rome. Thus hee enuironed the Citie with water like another Venice; and hauing raigned eleuen yeares, died. Moteçuma the second was chosen, who before his Soueraigntie was of graue and stayed disposition, much addicted to his deuotions. He retyred himselfe into a Chap∣pell, appointed for him in the Temple of Vitzliputzli, where (they say) the Idoll spake to him; wherein also hee hidde himselfe, after hee had intelligence of this Election. From thence he was ledde to the Harth of their Gods, where he sacrificed, with draw∣ing bloud from his eares and the calues of his legges. They attired him with the roy∣all ornaments, and piercing his nosthrills, hung there at a rich Emerald. Being seated in his Throne, the King of Tescuco, one of the Electors; made an eloquent Oration, which Ioseph Lib. 7. c.20. Acosta hath set downe word by word, and-deserued a roome here, if our hastie Pilgrimage would suffer. This Moteçuma commaunded, That no Plebeian should serue him in any Office in his House, prouiding Knights and Nobles for that purpose. His Coronation was so∣lemnized with Dances, Comedies, Banquets, Lights, and other pompe: the sacrificed captiues were of a farre Prouince toward the North Sea, which he subdued. Mecho∣vacan, Tlascalla, and Tapeaca neuer yeelded to the Mexicans; which Moteçuma told Cortes, that he spared for the vse of his sacrifices, and the exercise of his souldiors. He laboured to be respected and worshipped as a God. It was death for any Plebeian to looke him in the face: He neuer set his foot on the ground, but was alwaies carried on the shoulders of Noblemen; and if he lighted, they layed rich Tapestrie, whereon he did goe. He neuer put on one Garment twice, nor vsed one Vessell, or Dish, aboue once. He was rigorous in execution of his Lawes, and for that purpose would dis∣guise himselfe, to see how they were executed, and offer bribes to the Iudges, to pro∣uoke them to iniustice; which, if they accepted, cost them their liues, though they were his kinsmen, or brethren. His fall is before declared: it shall not be amisse here to men∣tion some prodigious fore-runners of the same. The Idoll of Cholola, called Quetza∣coalt, declared, That a strange people came to possesse his Kingdome. The King of Tescuco, a great Magician, and many Sorcerers, told him as much. The King shut vp the Sorcerers in prison, where they vanished presently: wherefore he exercised that rage on their wiues and children, which he had intended against them. Hee sought to appease his angrie Gods by Sacrifices, and therefore would haue remoued a great stone, which by no humane industrie would be moued, as refusing his attonement. Strange voices were heard, accompanied with Earthquakes and swellings of the wa∣ters. A prodigious Bird, of the bignesse of a Crane, was taken, which on his head had (as it were) a Glasse representing armed men, and in the Kings presence vanished. A stranger thing befell a poore man, who was taken vp by an Eagle, and carried in∣to a certaine Caue, where hee let him downe, pronouncing these words; Most mightie Lord, I haue brought him whome thou hast commaunded. There he saw one like the King, lying asleepe; touching whome hauing receiued threatening Pro∣phesies, hee was againe by that former Pursuiuant placed where hee had beene taken vp. These thinges, as deuillish illusions, abusing GODS Prouidence and Iustice, and Imitating his Power, to robbe him of his glorie, deserue to be men∣tioned.
Muteçuma hauing intelligence of Cortes his arriuall, was much troubled, and con∣ferring with his Counsell, they all said, that without doubt their great and ancient Lord Queztzalcoalt who had said, that hee would returne from the East whither hee was gone, had now fulfilled his promise and was come. Therefore did hee send Em∣bassadours with presents vnto Cortes, acknowledging him for Queztzalcoalt, (some∣time their Prince, now esteemed a God) and himselfe his Lieutenant. Concerning the State of Mexico vnder the Spaniards, Robert R. Tompson ap. Hak. Tomson who was there about the year 1555. saith, that then it was thought there were a thousand & fiue hundred housholds of Spaniards, and aboue three hundred thousand Indians. The H. Haukss dp. Hak. lab. Hortop. Citie is enuironed with a Lake, and the Lake also with Mountaines about thirtie leagues in compasse; the raines falling from these Hills cause the lake. In this Citie resideth the Viceroy, and here the highest Indian Courts are kept. There are weekely three faires or markets, abounding with plentie of commodities at a cheape price. Many Riuers fall into the Lake, but none goe out. The Indians know how to drowne the Citie, and would haue practised it, had not the Conspirators been taken and hanged. The Indians here are good Artificers, Gold-smithes, Copper∣smithes, Black-smithes, Carpenters, Shooe-makers, Taylors, Sadlers, Embroderers, and of all other sciences, and worke exceeding cheape, liuing of a little. They will goe two or three leagues to a Faire, carrying not aboue a penny-worth of commodities, and yet maintayne themselues thereby. Miles Miles Philips. Philips saith, that when Sr.Francis Drake was on the South Sea, the Vice∣roy caused a generall muster to be made of all the Spaniards in Mexico, and found a∣boue seuen thousand housholds, and three thousand single men, and of Mestizoes twentie thousand. Mr. Chiltou Iohn Chilton. testifieth, that euery Indian payeth tribute to the King twelue Realls of Plate, and a Hauneg of Maiz, (fiue Haunegs make a quarter English) and euery Widdow halfe so much. And all their children, aboue fifteene yeares old, pay after the same rate. He hath great gaine by his fifths, and by the Popes Bulls: this leaden ware was worth to the King at first aboue three Millions of gold yearely. The great∣nesse of exactions caused two rebellions whiles he was there, and the King will not suffer them to haue Oile or Wine there growing, although the earth would prodigally repay them, that they may still haue neede of Spaine. Tlaxcalla, for their merits in the conquest of Mexico, as before is shewed, is free: only they pay a handfull of wheat a man in signe of subiection: but some later encrochers haue forced them to till at their owne charge as much ground as their tribute would amount to. There are in it two hundred thousand Indians. Some of the wild people in New Spaine are deadly enemies to the Spaniards, and eate as many as they get of them. Iohn Chilton fell into their hands, but being sicke and leane, they thought (as a captiue wench told him) that he had the Pox, and was but vnholsome foode, and so let him depart. It is an ill winde that blowes none to good: sicknesse, the harbenger of death, was to him preseruer of life. Mexico is now an Roters. Vniuersitie, and therein are taught those Sciences which are read in our Vniuersities of Europe. This Vniuersitie was Gasp..l.2 there founded by Antonie Mendoza, and King Philip erected a College of the Iesuits, An.1577. Mexico is an Archbishoprick. There Ortel. Theat. be many Spanish Colonies or Plantations, Compostella, Colima, Guadaleiara, Mechocan, Citie of Angele, and others: whereof diuers are Episcopall Sees. In Guaste can, not farre from Panuco, is a Hill, from whence spring two Fountaines, one of black pitch, the other of red, very hot. To speake largely of New Galicia, Mechuacan, Guaste can, and other Regions, would not be much to the Readers delight, and lesse to my purpose.
CHAP. XI. Of the Idols and Idolatrous sacrifices of New Spaine. THe Indians (as Acosta Naturall & morall Hist. of the Indies. lib.5. cap.3. obserueth) had no name proper vnto God, but vse the Spanish word Dios fitting it to the accent of the Cuscan or Mexican tongues. Yet did they acknowledge a supreme power, cal∣led Vitziliputzli, terming him the Most puissant, & Lord of all things, to whom they erected at Mexico the most sumptuous Temple in the Indies. After the Supreme God they worshipped the Sunne, and there∣fore called Cortes (as he writ to the Emperour) Sonne of the Sunne. That Vitziliputzli Hernando Cortes. Acost. l. 5.c.9. was an Image of wood, like to a man, set vpon an Azure-coloured stoole in a bran∣kard or litter; at euery corner was a peece of wood like a Serpents head. The stoole signified that he was set in heauen. He had the forehead Azure, and a band of Azure vnder the nose, from one eare to the other. Vpon his head he had a rich plume of fea∣thers, couered on the top with gold: he had in his left hand a white target, with the figures of fiue Pine Apples, made of white feathers, set in a Crosse; and from aboue issued forth a crest of gold: At his sides hee had foure Darts, which, the Mexicans say, had beene sent from heauen. In his right hand he had an Azured staffe, cut in fashion of a wauing Snake. All these ornaments had their mysticall sense. The name of Vit∣ziliputzli signifies the left hand of a shining feather. Hee was set vpon an high Altar in a small boxe, well couered with linnen clothes, iewells, feathers, and ornaments of gold: and for the greater veneration he had alwaies a curtaine before him. Ioyning to the Chappell of this Idoll, there was a pillar of lesse worke and not so well beautifi∣ed, where there was another Idoll called Tlaloc. These two were alwaies together, for that they held them as Companions, and of equall power. There was an other I∣dol in Mexico much esteemed, which was the Gemor part 1 calls him the God of Pro∣uidence. God of Repentance, and of Iubilees and Pardons for their sinnes. He was called Tezcallipuca, made of a black shining stone, attyred after their manner, with some Ethnike deuises: it had eare-rings of gold and siluer, and through the neather lip a small Canon of Crystall, halfe a foot long, in which they sometimes put an Azure feather, sometimes a greene, so resembling a Tur∣queis or Einerald: it had the haire bound vp with a haire-lace of gold, at the end whereof did hang an eare of gold, with two fire-brands of smoke painted therein, sig∣nifying that he heard the prayers of the afflicted, and of sinners. Betwixt the two eares hung a number of small Herons. He had a iewell hanging at his neck, so great that it couered all his stomack: vpon his armes, bracelets of gold; at his nauill a rich greene stone, and in his left hand a fanne of pretious feathers of greene, azure, and yellow, which came forth of a looking glasse of gold, signifying that he saw all things done in the world. In his right hand hee held foure Darts as the ensignes of his iustice, for which cause they feared him most. At his festiuall they had pardon of their sinnes. They accompted him the God of Famine, drought, barrennesle, and pestilence. They painted him in another forme, sitting in great maiestie on a stoole, compassed in with a red Cuin, painted and wrought with the heads and bones of dead men. In the lest hand was a Target with fiue Pines, like vnto Pine-Apples, of Cotton; and in the right hand a little Dart, with a threatning countenance, and the arme stretched out, as if he would call it: and from the Target came foure Darts. The countenance expres∣sed anger, the bodie was all painted black, and the head full of quailes feathers. Quecalc uatl was their God of the Aire. In Cholula Cholula. they worshipped the God of Merchandise, called Quetzaalcoalt, which had the forme of a man, but the visage of a little Bird with a red bill, & aboue, a combe full of warts, hauing also ranks of teeth, and the tongue hanging out. It carryed on
the head a pointed Mitre of painted paper, a sithe in the hand, and many toyes of gold on the legs: it had about it gold, siluer, iewells, feathers, and habits of diuers colours: and was set aloft in a spacious place in the Temple. All this his furniture was signifi∣cant. The name importeth Colour of a rich feather. No maruell if this God had many suters, seeing Gaine is both God and godlinesse to the most; the whole world admiring and adoring this Mammon or Quitzaalcoalt. Tlaloc was their God of water: to whom they sacrificed for raine. They had also their Goddesses Gomara part. 1. , the chiefe of which was Toz. which is to say, Our Grand-mother, of which is spoken before; shee was flaied by the command of Vitzi∣liputzli, and from hence they learned to flay men in sacrifice, and to cloth the liuing with the skins of the dead. One of the Goddesses, which they worshipped, had a sonne who was a great hunter, whom they of Tlascalla afterwards tooke for a God; being themselues addicted much to that exercise. They therefore made a great feast vnto this Idoll as shall after follow. They had an other strange kinde of Idoll which was not an Image, but a true Man. For they tooke a captiue, and before they sacrificed him they gaue him the name of the Idoll, to whom he should be sacrificed, apparrelling him also with the same orna∣ments. And during the time that this representation lasted (which was for a yeare in some feasts, six moneths in some, in others lesse) they worshipped him in the same manner, as they did their God; he in the meane time eating, drinking, and making merrie. When hee went through the streets, the people came forth to worship him, bringing their almes, with children and sick folks, that he might cure and blesse them, suffering him to doe all things at his pleasure; only hee was accompanied with ten or twelue men, lest he should flee. And he (to the end hee might bee reuerenced as hee passed) sometimes sounded on a small flute. The feast being come, this fat foole was killed, opened, and eaten. Lopes Lop. de Gom. part.1. de Gomara writeth, that the Mexicans had two thousand Gods They had their Venus, & their Bacchus, and Mars, and other such Dei∣ties in Mexican appellations, as the Heathen Greekes and Romans, as after shall ap∣peare. , but the chiefe were Vitziliputzli and Tezcatlipuca. These two were accompted brethren: There was an other God who had a great Image placed on the top of the Idolls chap∣pell, made all of that Countrie seedes, ground, and made into past, tempered with chil∣drens bloud, and Virgins sacrificed, whose hearts were plucked out of their opened breasts, and offered as first fruits to that Idoll. It was consecrated by the Priests with great solemnitie, all the Citizens being present, many deuout persons sticking in the dowie Image gold and iewells: after which consecration no secular person may touch that Image, nor come in his Chappell. They renew this Image with new dow many times, and O ter quater blessed man he, that can get any reliques of him. The Soul∣diers thought themselues hereby safe in the warres. At this consecration also a Vessell of water was hallowed with many ceremonies, and kept at the foot of the Altar for the Kings coronation, and to blesse the Captaines that went to the warres, with a draught of it. Next after their Gods it followeth to speake of their Acosta. 15. Goddesse sacrifices: where∣in they surmounted all the Nations of the world in beastly butcheries. The persons they sacrificed were So (some say) from the like practise of the Ancients Vi∣ctia was so called, & bustia quasi a victe, & ab boste captiues: to get which, they made their warres, rather seeking in their victories to take then to kill. Their manner of Sacrificing was this. They assem∣bled such as should be sacrificed in the Pallisadoe of dead mens skulls, of which wee shall after speake, where they vsed a certaine ceremonie at the foot of the Palisado; they placed a great guard about them. Presently there stept forth a Priest attyred with a short surplesse full of tassels beneath, who came from the top of the Temple, bearing an Idoll made of Wheat & Mays mingled with bony, which had the eies thereof made of greene glasse, and the teeth of the graines of Mays. He descended the steps of the Temple with all speede, and ascended by a little ladder vp a great stone, planted vpon a high terrasse in the midst of the Court. This stone was called Quauxi-ca, that is, the stone of Eagle: as he went vp and came downe, still he embraced his Idoll. Then went hee vp to the place, where those were which should bee sacrificed, shewing his Idoll to euery one in particular, saying vnto them, this is your God. This done, he des∣cended
by the other side of the staires, and all such as should die, went in Procession to the place where they should be sacrificed, where they found the Ministers readie for that office. Six of the Priests were appointed to this execution; foure to hold the handes and feet of him that should be sacrificed, the fift to hold his head, the sixt to open his stomack, and pull out his heart. They called them Chachalmna, that is, the Ministers of holy thinges. It was a high dignitie wherein they succeeded their Pro∣genitours. The sixt, which killed the Sacrifice, was as a high Priest, or Bishop, whose name was different according to the difference of times and solemnities. Their habits also differed according to the times. The name of their chiefe dignitie was Papa and To∣pilzm. Their habite and robe was a red Curtaine with tassells below, a Crowne of rich feathers, Greene, White, and Yellow, vpon his head; and at his eares like pen∣dants of gold, wherein were set greene stones, and vnder the lippe vpon the midst of the beard, he had a peece like vnto a small Canon of an Azured stone. The sacrificer came with his face and handes shining black: the other fiue had their haire much curled, and tyed vp with laces of leather, bound about the midst of the head: vpon their forehead they carried small roundelets of paper painted about with diuers colours, and they were attyred in a Dalmatike robe of white wrought with black, in this attyre representing the Deuill. The Soueraigne Priest carried a great knife in his hand of a large and sharpe flint, an other carried a coller of wood wrought in forme of a Snake, all put themselues in order before a Pyramidall stone which was directly against the dore of the Chappel of their Idoll. This stone was so pointed, that the man which was to bee sacrificed, being laied thereon vpon his back, did bend in such sort, as letting the knife but fall vpon his stomack, it opened very easily in the middest. Then did the guard cause them to mount vp certaine large staires in ranke to this place, and as euery one came in their order, the six sacrificers tooke him, one by one foot, an other by the other; and one by one hand, an other by the other, all naked, and cast him on his back vpon this pointed stone: where the fift of them put the coller of wood about his neck, and the high Priest opened his stomack with the knife with a strange dexteritie and nimblenesse, pulling out his heart with his handes, the which hee shewed smoking vnto the Sunne, to whom hee did offer this heat and fume of the heart: and presently he turned towards the Idoll, and did cast the heart at his face, & then cast away the body, tumbling it downe the staires of the Temple, there being not two foot space betwixt the stone and the first step. In this sort they sacrifi∣ced them all one after another. Their Masters, or such as had taken them, tooke vp the bodies and carryed them away, and diuiding them amongst them, did eate them. There were euer fortie or fiftie, at the least, thus sacrificed. The neighbour Nations did the like, imitating the Mexicans in this sacred Butcherie. There was another kinde of Sacrifice, which they made in diuers feasts, called Ra∣caxipe Velitzli which is as much as the flaying of men, because they flayed the sacri∣fice (as is said) and there with apparelled a man appointed to that end. This man Gomara saith, that the anci∣ent persons, & sometimes the King himselfe, would put on this skinne, be∣ing of a princi∣pall Captiue. went dancing and leaping through all the houses and market places of the Citie, euery one being forced to offer something vnto him: which, if any refused, he would strike him ouer the face with the corner of the skinne, defiling him with the congealed bloud. This continued till the skinne did stinke, during which time much almes was gathe∣red, which they imployed in necessaries for their deuotions. In many of these Feasts they made a challenge betweene him that did sacrifice, and him that should bee sacri∣ficed, thus: They tyed the slaue by one foot to a wheele of stone, giuing him a sword and target in his handes to defend himselfe: then stepped forth the other armed in like manner. And if hee that should bee sacrificed, defended himselfe valiantly a∣gainst the other, hee was freed, and was reputed a famous Captaine: but if hee were vanquished, he was sacrificed on that stone whereto he was tyed. They euery yeare gaue one slaue to the Priests, to represent their Idoll. At his first entrie into the office, after hee had beene well washed they adorned him with the Idols ornaments and name, as before is said: and if hee escaped before his time of
Sacrifice was expired, the chiefe of his guard was substituted to that representation, and Sacrifice. He had the most honourable lodging in all the Temple, where hee did eate and drinke, and whither all the chiefe Ministers came to serue and honour him: he was accompanied with Noble men through the streets. At night they put him in∣to a strong prison, and at the appointed feast sacrificed him. The Deuill (a Ioh.3.44, Murtherer from the beginning) suggested to the Priests, when there seemed defect of these Sacrifices, to goe to their Kings, telling them that their Gods dyed for hunger, and therefore should be remembred. Then assembled they their peo∣ple to warres to furnish their bloudie Altars. There happened a strange accident in one of these Sacrifices, reported by men worthie of credit, That the Spaniards beholding these Sacrifices, a yong man whose heart was newly plucked out, and himselfe tumbled downe the staires, when he came to the botome, he said to the Spaniards in his language; Knights they haue slaine mee. The Indians themselues grew wearie of these cruell Rites, and therefore they easily embraced the Spaniards Christianitie: Yea, Cortes writ to the Emperour Charles, that those of Mechoaan sent to him for his law, being wearie of their owne, as not see∣ming good vnto them. Some of the Spaniards Lop.de Com. part.1. were thus sacrificed at Tescuco, and their horse-skinnes tanned in the haire, and hung vp with the horse-shooes in the great Temple, and next to them the Spaniards garments, for a perpetuall memorie. At the siege of Mexico, they sacrificed at one time, in sight of their Countrie-men, fortie Spaniards. The Acost.l.5.c.27 Mexicans, besides their cruelties, had other vn-beseeming Rites in their Religion: as to eate and drinke to the name of their Idolls, to pisse in the honour of them, carrying them vpon their shoulders, to annoint and besmeare themselues fil∣thily, and other things, both ridiculous and lamentable. They Gom.pa.398 were so deuout in their superstitions, and superstitious in their deuotions, that before they would eate or drinke, they would take a little quantitie and offer it to the Sunne, and to the Earth. And if they gather Corne, Fruit, or Roses, they would take a leafe before they would smell it, and offer the same: he which did not thus, was accompted neither louing nor loued of God. The Mexicans in the siege of their Citie, being brought to all extremities, spake thus, as Lopes reporteth, vnto Cortes; Considering that thou art the child of the Sunne, why doest not thou intreat the Sunne thy Father to make an end of vs: O Sunne that canst goe round about the world in a day and a night, make an end of vs, and take vs out of this miserable life, for we desire death, to goe and rest with our God Querca∣nath, who tarryeth for vs. CHAP. XII. Of the Religious places and persons in New Spaine: wherein is also handled their Penance, Marriages, Burialls, and other Rites, per∣formed by their Priests. WE haue alreadie mentioned the Temple of Vitziliputzli in Mexico, which requireth our further description. It Acost. I.5.c.13 was built of great stones in fashion of Snakes tyed one to another: and had a great circuit, called Coatepantli, that is, a circuit of Snakes. Vpon the top of euery Chappell or Oratorie, where the Idols were, was a fine pillar wrought with small stones black as ieat, the ground raised vp with white and red, which below gaue a great light: Vpon the top of the pillar were battlements wrought like Snailes, supported by two Indians of stone, sitting, holding candlesticks in their hands, which were like Croysants, garnished and enriched at the ends, with yellow and greene fea∣thers, and long fringes of the same. Within the circuit of this Court there were many
chambers of religious men, and others that were appointed for the Priests and Popes. This Court is so great and spacious, that eight or ten thousand persons did dance easily in a round, holding hands, which was an vsuall custome there, howsoeuer it seemeth incredible. There were foure gates or entries, at the East, West, North, and South, at euery Gomara saith that the fourth was not a cau∣sey, but a street of the Citie. of which beganne a faire causey of two or three leagues long. There were in the midst of the Lake wherein Mexico is built, foure large causies. Vpon euery entrie was a God or Idoll, hauing the visage turned to the causie right against the Temple gate of Vitziliputzli. There were thirtie steps of thirtie fadome long, diuided from the circuit of the Court by a street that went betweene them. Vpon the top of these steps, there was a walke of thirtie foot broade, all plastered with chalke, in the midst of which walke was a Pallisado artificially made of very high Trees, planted in order a fadome a-sunder. These Trees were very bigge and all pierced with small holes from the foot to the top, and there were rods did runne from one Tree to another, to which were tyed many dead mens heads. Vpon euery rod were many skulls, and these rankes of skulls continue from the foot to the top of the Tree. This Pallisado was full of dead mens skulls from one end to the other, which were the heads of such as had beene sacrificed. For after the flesh was eaten, the head was deliuered to the Priests, who tyed them in this sort, vntill they fell off by morsells. Vpon the top of the Temple were two stones or Chappells, and in them the two Images of Vitziliputzli and Tlaloc. These Chappells were carued and grauen very artificially, and so high, that to ascend vp to it there were an hundred and twentie staires of stone. Before these Chappells there was a Court of fortie foot square, in the midst whereof was a high stone of fiue hand breadth, pointed in fashion of a Pyramide, placed there for the sacrificing of men as is before shewed. Gomara Gomar.part.1 saith, that this and other their Temples were called Tencalls, which sig∣nifieth Gods house. This Temple, he saith, was square, contayning euery way as much Pet.Mart. Dec.5.l.4. saith that in largeness the situation of this Temple is matchable with a Towne of fiue hun∣dred houses. as a Crosse-bow can shoot leuell: in the midst stood a mount of earth and stone fif∣tie fadome long euery way, built Pyramide-fashion, saue that the top was flat; and ten fadome square. It had two such Pyramide stones or Altars for sacrifice, painted with monstrous figures. Euery Chappell had three lofts, one aboue another, susteyned vp∣pon pillars: From thence the eie with much pleasure might behold all about the Lake. Besides this Tower, there were fortie other Towers belonging to other inferior Tem∣ples; which were of the same fashion: only their prospect was not Westward, to make difference. Some of those Temples were bigger then others, and euery one of a se∣uerall God. There was one round Temple dedicated to the God of the Aire, called Quecalco∣natl, the forme of the Temple representing the aires circular course about the earth. The entrance of that Temple had a dore, made like the mouth of a Serpent, with foule and deuillish resemblances, striking dreadfull horrour to such as entered. All these Temples had peculiar Houses, Priests, Gods, and Seruices. At euery dore of the great Temple was a large Hall and goodly buildings, which were common Armories for the Citie. They had other darke houses full of Idols of diuers mettalls, all embrewed with bloud, the daily sprinkling whereof makes them shew black: yea, the walls were an inch thick, and the ground a foot thick with bloud, which yeelded a lothsome sent. The Priests entered daily therein, which they allowed not to others, except to Noble personages, who at their entrie were bound to offer some man to bee sacri∣ficed to those slaughter-houses of the Deuill. There did continually reside in the great Temple fiue thousand persons, which had there their meate, drinke, and lodging; the Temple enioying great reuennues and diuers Townes for the mainte∣nance thereof. Next Acost.l.5.c.13 to the Temple of Vitziliputzli was that of Tescalipuca, the God of Penance, Punishments (and Prouidence) very high and well built. It had foure ascents; on the top was flat, an hundred and twentie foot broade; and ioyning to it was a Hal han∣ged with Tapestrie, and Curtins of diuers colours and workes. The dore being low and large was alwaies couered with a vaile, and none but the Priests might enter.
All this Temple was beautified with diuers Images and Pictures most curiously: for that these two Temples were as the Cathedrall Church, the rest as parishionall. They were so spacious, and had so many Chambers, that there were in them places for the Priests, Colledges, and Schooles. Without Lop. Gom. part.1. the great Temple, and ouer against the principall doore, a stones cast distant was the Charnell house, or that Golgotha (before mentioned;) where vpon poles or stickes, and also in the walles (two Towers hauing no other stuffe but lime and skulles) Andrew de Tapia certified Acost. l.5. cap.15. Gomara, that he, and Gonsala de Vmbria did reckon in one day, an hundred thirtie six thousand skulls. When any wasted, supply was made of others in their roome Within this great Circuit of the principall Temple were two houses, like Cloisters, the one opposite to the other, one of men, the other of women. In that of women they were Virgins only, of twelue or thirteen yeares of age, which they called the Maids of Penance: they were as many as the men, and liued chastely, and regularly, as Vir∣gins dedicated to the seruice of their God. Their charge was to sweepe and make cleane the Temple, and euery morning to prepare meate for the Idoll and his Mini∣sters, of the Almes the Religious gathered. The foode they prepared for the Idoll were small Loaues, in the forme of hands and feete, as of March-pane: and with this bread they prepared certaine sauces, which they cast daily before the Idoll, and his Priests did eate it. These Virgins had their haire cut, and then let them grow for a certaine time: they rose at midnight to the Idols Mattins, which they dayly celebrated, performing the same exercises which the Religious did. They had their Abbesses, who employed them to make cloth of diuers fashions, for the ornaments of their Gods and Temples. Their ordinary habite was all white, without any worke or colour. They did their penance at midnight, sacrificing and wounding themselues, and piercing the tops of their eares, laying the bloud which issued forth vpon their cheekes, and after bathed themselues in a poole which was within the Monasterie. If any vvere found disho∣nest, they were put to death without remission, saying, shee had polluted the house of their God. They held it for an ominous token, that some Religious man or woman had com∣mitted a fault, when they saw a Rat or a Mouse passe, or a Battin in the Idol-Chappell, or that they had gnawed any of the vailes, for that they say, a Cat, or a Bat would not aduenture to commit such an indignitie, if some of tence had not gone before: and then began to make inquisition, and discouering the offender, put him to death. None were receiued into this Monasterie, but the daughters of one of the six quarters, named for that purpose: and this profession continued a yeare, during which time, their fa∣thers and themselues had made a vow to serue the Idol in this manner, and from thence they went to be married. The other Cloyster or Monasterie was of yong-men, of eighteene or twenty yeares of age, which they called Religious. Their crownes were shauen, as the Friers in these parts, their haire a little longer, which fell to the middest of their eare, except on the hinder part of the head, where they let it grow to their shoulders, and tied it vp in trusses. These serued in the Temple, liued poorely and chastely, and (as the Leuites) ministred to the Priests, Incense, Lights and Garments, swept and made cleane the holy Place, bringing wood for a continuall fire, to the harth of their God, which was like a Lampe that still burned before the Altar of their Idoll. Besides these, there were other little boyes that serued for manuall vses, as to decke the Temple with Boughs, Roses, and Reedes, giue the Priests water to wash, Rasours to sacri∣fice, and to goe with such as begged almes, to carrie it. All these had their superi∣ours, who had the governement ouer them, and when they came in publike, where women were, they carried their eyes to the ground, not daring to beholde them. They had linnen garments, and went into the Citie foure or sixe together, to aske almes in all quarters, and if they gote none, it was lawfull for them to goe into the Corne∣fields, and gather that which they needed, none daring to contradict them.
There might not aboue fiftie liue in this penance, they rose at mid-night and soun∣ded the Trumpets, to awake the people. Euery one watched by turne, least the fire before the Altar should die: they gaue the censer, with which the Priest at mid-night incensed the Idoll, and also in the morning, at noone, and at night. They Mexican Vota∣ries, no lesse strict in that threefold cord which the Popish Votaries glorie of; Pouertie, Cō∣tinencie, Obe∣dience, with o∣ther will-wor∣ship: yea, for the time, more austere. were very subiect and obedient to their Superiours, and passed not any one point commanded. And at mid-night after the Priest had ended his censing, they retyred themselues a∣part into a secret place, where they sacrificed and drew bloud from the Calues of their legges with sharpe bodkins, therewith rubbing their Temples and vnder their Eares, presently washing themselues in a Poole appointed to that end. These yong men did not annoynt their heads and bodies with Tobacco. Petum, as the Priests did. This austeritie continued a yeare. The Priests likewise rose at mid-night, and retyred themselues into a large place where were many lights, and there drew bloud, as the former, from their legges, then did they set these Bodkins vpon the battlements of the Court, stickt in straw, that the people might see. Neither might they vse one bodkin twice. The Priests also v∣sed great fasts of fiue or ten dayes together, before their great Feasts. Some of them to preserue their chastitie, slit their members in the midst, and did a hundred thinges to make themselues impotent, lest they should offend their Gods. They drunke no wine, and slept little, for that the greatest part of their exercises were by night. They did vse also (that the selfe-tyrannising Catholike should not out-vie merits) to Discipline themselues with cords full of knots, wherein the people likewise came not behinde in cruell Processions, especially on the Feast of Tezcalipuca, lashing themselues with knotted Manguey-cords ouer the shoulders. The Priests fasted fiue dayes before that Feast, eating but once a day, and abstayning from their Wiues; the whips supplying those delicacies. Gomara I.op. de Gom. part.1. pag.396. speaketh of others, besides those yong ones before mentioned, which liued in those Cloysters, some being sick, for their recouerie; some in extreme pouer∣tie, to finde reliefe; some for riches, for long life, for good husbands, for many chil∣dren, and some for vertue: euery one abode there as long as they had vowed, and af∣ter vsed their libertie. Their offices were to spinne cotton, wooll, and feathers, and to weaue cloth for their Gods, and themselues, to sweepe all the holy roomes: they might goe on Procession with the Priests, but not sing, nor goe vp the staires of the Temple: their foode was boiled flesh and hot bread, receiued of almes, the smoke whereof was offered to their Gods: they eate and lay all together, but lay in their clothes. Touching their Priests in Mexico Ios.Acost.l.5 cap.14. there were some high Priests or Popes, euen vnder the same name, called by the Mexicans,Papas, as they should say, Soueraigne Bishops: others, as before you haue heard, were of inferiour ranke. The Priests of Vitziliputzli succeeded by linages of certaine quarters of the Citie, deputed for that purpose: and those of other Idolls came by election, or by being offered to the Tem∣ple in their Infancie. The daily exercise of the Priests was to cast incense on the I∣dolls, which was done foure times in the space of a naturall day: at breake of day, at noone, at sunne-set, at mid-night. At mid-night all the chiefe Officers of the Temple did rise, and in stead of Bells they did sound a long time vpon Trumpets, Cornets, and Flutes, very heauily; which being ended, he that did the Office that weeke, stept forth attyred in a white Robe with a censer in his hand, full of coles, which hee tooke from the harth, burning continually before the Altar; in the other hand he had a purse full of incense, which hee cast into the censer, and entring the place where the Idoll was, he incensed it with great reuerence; then tooke hee a cloth with the which hee wiped the Altar and the Curtins. This done, they went all into a Chappell, and there did beat themselues and draw bloud with Bodkins, as is said: this was alwaies done at mid-night. None other but the Priests might intermeddle with their Sacrifices, and euery one did imploy himselfe according to his dignitie and degree. They did like∣wise preach to the people at some Feasts. They had reuennues, and great offerings. The Mexican Priests Acost.l.5.c.26 were thus annoynted; they annoynted the bodie from
the foote to the head, and all the haire likewise, which hung like tresses, or a horse∣mane, for that they applied this vnction wet and moist. Their haire grew so, that in time it hung downe to their hammes, insomuch, that the weight made it burthen∣some; for they neuer cut it vntill they died, or were dispensed with for their great age, or were employed in gouernements, or some honourable charge in the Com∣mon-wealth. They carried their haire in tresses of sixe fingers breadth, which they died blacke with the fume of Sapine, Firre, or Rosine. They were alwayes died with this tincture, from the foote vnto the head, so as they were like vnto shining Ne∣gros. This was their ordinarie vnction; they had an other, when they went to sa∣crifice or incense on the toppes of mountaines, or in darke Caues, where their Idoles were, vsing also certaine ceremonies, to take away Feare, and adde Courage. This Vnction was made with diuerse venomous beasts, as Spiders, Scorpions, Salaman∣ders, and Vipers, which the boyes in the Colledges tooke and gathered together: wherein they were so expert, as they were alway furnished when the Priests called for them. They tooke all these together, and burnt them vpon the harth of the Temple which was before the Altar, vntill they were consumed to ashes. Then did they put them in Morters with much Tabacco or Petum, which maketh them loose their force; mingling likewise with these ashes, scorpions, spiders, and palmers aliue. After this, they put to it a certaine seed being grownd, which they called Olololchqui, whereof the Indians made drinkes to see Visions, for that the vertue of this herbe is to depriue men of sense. They did likewise grinde with these ashes blacke and hairie wormes, whose haire onelie is venomous: all which they mingled together with blacke, or the fume of rosine, putting it in small pots, which they set before their God, saying it was his meate, and therefore called it a Diuine meate. By meanes of this oyntment they became Witches, and did see and speake with the Deuill. The Priests, being slubbered with this oyntment, lost all feare, putting on a spirite of crueltie. By rea∣son whereof they did very boldely kill men in their Sacrifices, went all alone in the night time to the mountaines, and into obscure Caues, contemned all wilde beasts, beleeuing, that Lions, Tygres, Serpents, and the rest fled from them by vertue hereof. This Petum did also serue to cure the sicke; and for children, all resorted to them as to their Sauiour, to apply vnto them this Diuine Physicke, as they called it. They vsed manifolde other superstitions to delude the people, in tying small flowers about their neckes, and strings with small bones of Snakes, commaunding them to bathe at cer∣tayne times, to watch all night at the Diuine harth, to eate no other bread but that which had beene offered to their Gods, that they should (vpon all occasions) repaire to their wisards, who with certaine graines tolde fortunes, and diuined, looking into keelers and pailes full of water. The Sorcerers & Their wit∣ches. Ministers of the deuill vsed much to besmeare themselues. There were an infinite number of these witches, diuiners, inchan∣ters, and the like: and still there remaine of them (but secret) not daring publiquely to exercise their superstitions The Mexicans Their rites vnto infants. had amongst them a kinde of Baptisme, which they did with cut∣ting the eares and members of yong children, hauing some resemblance of the Iewish circumcision. This ceremonie was done principally to the sonnes of Kings and No∣ble men: presently vpon their birth the Priestes did wash them, and did put a lit∣tle sword in the right hand, in the left, a Target. And to the children of the vul∣gar sort, they put the markes of their callings, and to their daughters, instruments to spinne, knit, and labour. The Their mar∣riages Priests also had their office in marriages. The Bridegroome, and the Bride stood together before the Priest, who tooke them by the hands, asking them if they would marry: vnderstanding their will, he tooke a corner of the vaile, wherewith the vvoman had her head couered, and a corner of the mans gowne, which hee tied together on a knot, and so led them thus tied to the Bridegroomes house, where there was a harth kindled. Then he caused the Wife to goe seuen times about the harth, and so the mar∣ried couple sate downe together, and thus was the marriage contracted.
In other parts of New Spaine Gomara.part. 1 pag 389. they vsed other marriage-rites; at Tlaxcallan the Bridegroome and Bride polled their heads, to signifie, that from thenceforth all chil∣dish courses should be laid aside. At Michuacan the Bride must looke directly vpon the Bridegroome, or else the marriage was not perfect. In Mixteopan they vsed to carrie the Bridegrome vpon their backes, as if hee were forced: and then they both ioyne hands, and knit their mantles together with a great knot. The Macatecas did not come together in twenty dayes after marriage, but abode in fasting and prayer all that while, sacrificing their bodies, and annoynting the mouths of the Idoles with their bloud. In Panuco the husbands buy their wiues for a bowe, two arrowes, and a net; and after∣wards the father in lawe speaketh not one word to his sonne in lawe for the space of a yere. When he hath a child, he lieth not with his wife in two yeres after, lest she should be with childe againe before the other bee out of daunger; some sucke twelue yeares: and for this cause they haue many wiues. No woman, while she hath her disease, may touch or dresse any thing. Adultery in Mexico was death: common women were per∣mitted, but no ordinarie stewes. The deuill did many times talke with their Priests, and with some other rulers and particular persons. Great gifts were offred vnto him whom the deuill had vouchsafed this conference. He appeared vnto them in many shapes, and was often familiar with them. He, to whom he appeared, carried about him, painted, the likenes where in he shewed himselfe the first time. And they painted his Image on their doores, benches, and euery corner of the house. Likewise, according to his Protean and diuersified Apparitions, they painted him in many shapes. It belonged also to the office of the Priests and religious in Mexico, Acost.li. 5.c.8. to interre the dead, and doe their obsequies. The places where they buried them were their gardens and courts of their owne houses: others carried them to the places of sacrifices, which were done in the mountaines: others burnt them, and after, buried the ashes in the temples, burying with them whatsoeuer they had of apparrell, stones & iewels. They did sing the funerall offices like Responds, often lifting vp the dead body, with many ceremonies. At these mortuaries they did eate & drinke; and if it were a person of qualitie, they gaue apparell to such as came. When one was dead, his friends came with their presents, and saluted him as if he were liuing. And if he were a King or Lord of some towne, they of∣fered some slaues to bee put to death with him, to serue him in the other world. They likewise put to death his Priest or Chaplaine (for euery nobleman had a Priest for his do∣mesticall holies) that he might execute his office with the dead. They likewise killed his cook, his butler, dwarffs, & deformed men, and whosoeuer had most serued him, though he were his brother. And to preuent pouerty, they buried with them much wealth, as gold, siluer, stones, curtins, and other rich peeces. And if they burned the dead, they vsed the like with all his seruants, and ornaments they gaue him for the other world, & last∣ly, buried the ashes with great solemnitie. The obsequies continued tenne dayes with mournefull songs, and the Priests carried away the dead with innumerable ceremonies. To the noble-men they gaue their honorable ensignes, armes, and particular blazons, which they carried before the body to the place of burning, marching as in a Processi∣on, where the Priests and Officers of the Temple went with diuers furnitures, and orna∣ments, some casting incense, others singing, and some making the drums and flutes to sound the mournefullest accents of sorrow. The Priest who did the office was decked with the markes of the Idoll which the Noble-man had represented: for all noble-men did represent Idoles and carry the name of some one. Their The Mexicās honoured the best souldiers with a kinde of knighthood, of which were three Orders: one ware a red riband, which was the chief, the second was the Lion or ty∣ger knight: the grey Knight was the mea∣nest: they had great priviled∣ges. Acost. libr. 6 ca.26. Knighthood had these funerall solemnities. They brought the corpse to the place appointed, and environing it, and all the baggage, with pine-trees, set fire there∣on, maintaining the same with gummy wood, till all were consumed. Then came forth a Priest attired like a deuill, hauing mouths vpon euery ioynt of him, and many eyes of glasse, holding a great staffe with which he mingled all the ashes with terrible and feare∣full gestures. When Lop.de.Gom. part, 1.pag. 383. the king of Mexico sickened, they vsed forthwith to put a visor on the face of Tezcatlipuca or Vitzilivitzli, or some other idoll, which was not taken away till he mended or ended. If he died, word was presently sent into all his dominions for publike lamentations, and noble-men were summoned to the funeralls. The bodie
was laid on a matte, and watched foure nights, then washed, and a lock of haire cut off for a relike, for therein (said they) remained the remembrance of his soule. After this an Emerald was put in his mouth, & his body shrowded in seuenteene rich mantles, costly and curiously wrought. Vpon the vpper mantle was set the Deuice or Armes of some I∣doll, whereunto he had beene most deuote in his life time, and in his Temple should the body be huried. Vpon his face they put a vizor painted with fowle and diuellish ge∣stures, beset with iewels: then they killed the slaue, whose office was to light the lamps, and make fire to the Gods of his pallace. This done, they carried the body to the Tem∣ple, some carrying targets, arrowes, mases and ensignes, to hurl into the funerall fire. The high-priest and his crew receiue him at the temple gate with a sorrowfull Song, and after hee hath said certaine words, the body is cast into the fire there prepared for that purpose, together with iewells: also a dogge newly strangled, to guide his way. In the meane while two hundred persons were sacrificed by the Priests, or more, to serue him, as is said. The fourth day after, fifteene slaues were sacrificed for his soule, and vpon the twentieth day, fiue; on the sixtieth, three, &c. The ashes with the locke of haire was put in a chest, painted on the inside, with diuellish shapes, together with an other locke of haire which had beene reserued since the time of his birth. On this chest was set the I∣mage of the King: the kindred offred great gifts before the same. The Kings of Mechua∣can obserued the like bloudy rites: many Gentlewomen were by the new King ap∣pointed their offices in their seruice to the deceased, and while his body was burning, were malled with clubbes, and buried foure and foure in a graue. Many women-slaues and free Maidens were slaine to attend on these Gentlewomen. But I would not bu∣rie my Reader in these direfull graues of men, cruell in life and death. Let vs seeke some Festiuall argument, if that may be more delightfull. CHAP. XIII. Of the supputation of times, Festiuall Solemnities, Colleges, Schooles, Letters, Opinions, and other remarkeable things in New-Spaine THE Mexicans Acost. l.6.c.2. diuided the yeare into eighteene monethes, ascribing to each twenty-dayes, so that the fiue odde daies were excluded. These fiue they reckoned apart, and called them the daies of nothing: during the which, the people did nothing, neither went to their Temples, but spent the time in visiting each other: the sacrificers likewise ceased their sacrifices. These fiue daies being past, the first moneth began about the 26. of Februa∣rie. Gomara Gom. p.317. sets downe their monethes names in order. The Indians described them by peculiar pictures, commonly taken of the principall Feast therein. They accounted their weekes by thirteene daies : they had also a weeke of yeares which was likewise thirteene. They reckoned by a certaine wheele, which conteined foure weekes, that is, two and fiftie yeares. In the midst of this wheele was painted the Sunne, from which went foure beames or lines, in crosse, of distinct colours, greene, blew, red, and yellow; and so the lines betwixt these: on which they noted by some picture, the accident that befell any yeare, as the Spaniards comming, marked by a man clad in Red. The last night when this wheele was runne about, they brake all their Vessels and stuffe, put out their fire and all the lights, saying, that the world should end at the finishing of one of these wheeles, and it might be at that time; and then what should such things neede? Vpon this conceit they passed the night in great fears, but when they saw the day begin to breake, they presently beare many drummes, with much other mirth and musicke, saying; that GOD did prolong the time with another Age of two and fiftie yeares. And then began another wheele, the first day whereof they tooke from fire, for which they went to the Priest and made a solemne Sacrifice and Thanksgiuing. The twenty daies of each moneth were called by seuerall names, the
first Cipact which signifieth a Spade, and so the rest a house, a Dogge, a Snake, an Ea∣gle, a Temple, and the like. By this Calendar they keepe things in memory aboue nine hundred yeares since. The Indians of Culhua did beleeue that the Gods had made the world, they knew not how: and that since the Creation, foure Sunnes were past, and that the fift and last is the Sunne, which now giueth light vnto the world. The first Sunne (forsooth) perished by water, and all liuing creatures therewith: the second fell from heauen, and with the fall slew all liuing Creatures, and then were ma∣ny Giants in the countrey. The third Sunne was consumed by fire: and the fourth, by Tempest of Aire and Winde; and then mankinde perished not, but was turned into Apes: yet when that fourth Sunne perished, all was turned into darknesse, and so conti∣nued fiue and twenty yeares: and at the fifteenth yeare, God did forme one man and woman, who brought forth Children, and at the end of other ten yeares appeared this fift Sunne newly borne, which after their reckoning is now in this yeare 1612, nine hundred and eighteene yeares since. Three dayes after this Sunne appeared, they held, that all the Gods did die, and that these which since they worship, were borne in pro∣cesse of time. At the end of euerie twentie dayes the Mexicans celebrated a Feast called Tonalli, which was the last day of euery moneth. The last day of the first moneth was called Tlacaxipevaliztli, on which were slaine a hundred captiues in sacrifice, and eaten, o∣thers putting on the skinnes (as is before shewed.) Many of them would goe to the staughter with ioyfull countenance, dauncing, and demaunding almes, which befell to the Priests. When the greene corne was a foote aboue the ground, they vsed to goe to a certaine hill, and there sacrificed two children, a Gerle, and a Boy, three yeares old, to the honour of Tlaloc, god of Water, that they might haue raine: and because these children were free-borne, their hearts were not plucked out, but their throats being cut, their bodies were wrapped in a new mantle, and buried in a graue of stone. When the fields of Maiz were two foote high, a Collection was made, and there∣with were bought foure little slaues, betwixt the age of fiue and seuen, and they were sacrificed also to Tlaloc, for the continuance of raine: and those dead bodies were shut vp in a Caue appoynted to that purpose. The beginning of this butcherie, was, by occasion of a drought which continued foure yeares, and forced them to leaue the Countrey. When the Maiz was ripe, in the moneth and Feast Hueitozotls, euerie man gathered his handfull of Maiz, and brought it to the Temple for an offering, with a certaine drinke called Atuli, made of the same graine. They brought also Copalli, a sweete gumme, to incense the Gods, which cause the corne to growe. At the begin∣ning of Summer, they celebrated the Feast Tlaxnehimcaco, with Roses and all sweete flowers, making Garlands thereof, to set on their Idoles heads, and spending all that day in dauncing. To celebrate the Feast Tecuilhustli, all the principall persons of each Prouince, came to the Citie on the euening of the Feast, and apparelled a woman with the attire of the God of Salt, who daunced among a great company of her neighbours, but the next day was sacrificed with much solemnitie, and all that day was spent in de∣uotion, burning of incense in the Temple. The Merchants had a Temple by them∣selues dedicate to the God of Gaine: they made their Feast vpon the day called Miccail∣huitl, wherein were sacrificed and eaten many captiues, which they had bought, and all the day spent in dancing. In the Feast of Vchpaniztli they sacrificed a woman, whose skinne was put vpon an Indian, which two dayes together daunced with the Townes-men, celebrating the same Feast in their best attire. In the day of Hatamutztli the Mexicans entred into the Lake with a great number of Canoas, and there drowned a Boy and a Gerle, in a little boat, which they caused to be suncke, in such sort, that neuer after that boat appeared againe, holding opini∣on, that those children were in company with the Gods of the Lake. That day they spent in feasting and annoynting their Idoles cheekes with a kinde of gumme called V
When Cortes was gone out of Mexico, to incounter Pamphilo de Narnaes, and had left Alvarado in the Citie, he in the great Temple murthered a great multitude of gen∣tlemen, which had rhere assembled in the great Temple, to their accustomed solemnitie, being six hundred, or (as some say) a thousand, richly attired and adorned, where they vsed to sing and daunce, in honour of their God, to obtaine health, children, victorie, &c. In the moneth of Maie, Acost.l.. c.24. the Mexicans made their principall feast to Vitziliputzli: two dayes before which, the religious Virgins or Nunnes mingled a quantitie of beetes with rosted Maiz, and moulded it with hony, making an Image of that paste, in bignesse like to the Idol of wood, putting in insted of eyes, grains of glasse, green, blew, or white, and for teeth, graines of Maiz. Then did all the Nobles bring it a rich garment like vnto that of the Idoll, and being clad, did set it in an azured Chaire, and in a Litter. The morning of the st being come, an houre before day, all the maidens came forth atti∣red in white with new ornaments, which that day were called the sisters of Vitziliputzli: they were crowned with garlands of Maiz rosted and parched, with chames of the same about their neckes, passing vnder their left armes. Their cheekes were died with ver∣milion, their armes from the elbow to the wrist were couered with red Parrots fea∣thers. Thus attired, they tooke the Image on their shoulders, carrying it into the Court; where all the yongmen were, attired in red garments, crowned like the wo∣men. When the Maidens came forth with this idoll, the young men drew neere with much reuerence, taking the Litter wherein the Idoll was, vpon their shoulders, carry∣ing it to the staires foote of the Temple: where all the people did humble themselues, laying earth vpon their heads. After this, all the people went in procession to a mountaine called Chapulteper, a league from Mexico, and there made sacrifices. From thence they went to their se∣cond Station called Atlacuyauaya: and from thence againe to a Village which was a league beyond Cuyoacoan, and then returned to Mexico. They went in this sort a∣boue foure leagues, in so many howers, calling this procession Vpanta Vitziliputzli. Being come to the foote of the Temple staires, they set downe the litter vvith the Idoll, and with great obseruance draw the same to the top of the Temple, some drawing aboue, and others helping below, the Flutes and Drummes, Cornets, Trum∣pets, meane-while increasing the Solemnitie. The people abode in the Court. Ha∣uing mounted, and placed it in a little lodge of Roses, presently came the yong men, which strawed flowers of sundry kindes, within and without the Temple. This done, all the Virgins came out of their Conuent, bringing peeces of the same past whereof the Idoll was made, in the fashion of great bones, which they deliuered to the yong men, who carried them vp, and laide them at the Idols feete, till the place could receiue no more. They called these morsels of paste, the flesh and bones of Vitziliputzli. Then came all the Priestes of the Temple, euery one strictly obseruing his place, with Vatles of di∣uers colours and workes, garlands on their heads, and chaines of flowers aboue their neckes: after them came the Gods and Goddesses, whom they worshipped, of diuers figures, attired in the same liuerie. Then putting themselues in order about those pee∣ces of paste, they vsed certaine ceremonies, with singing and dancing. By these meanes they were blessed and consecrated for the flesh and bones of the Idoll: which were then honoured in the same sort, as their God. Then came forth the sacrificers, who began the sacrifice of men, whereof they now sacrificed more then at other times: for this was their solemnest Festiuall. The sacrifices beeing ended, all the yong men and Maides came out of the Temple attired as before, and being placed in order and ranke, one directly against another, they daunced by Drummes, which sounded in praise of the Feast, and of their God. To which song, all the ancientest and greatest men did answere, dancing about them, making a great circle as the manner is, the Yong men and Maides remaining alwaies in the middest. All the Citie came to this spectacle, and throughout the whole land, on this day
of Vitziliputzli his Feast, no man might eate any other meate; but this paste with Ho∣me, whereof the Idoll was made: and this should bee eaten at the point of day, not drinking till afternoone: The contrarie was sacrilegious: After the ceremonies ended, it was lawfull for them to eate any thing. During the time of this ceremonie they hid the water from their little Children, admonishing such, as had the vse of reason, to abstaine. The ceremonies, dances, and sacrifices ended, they went to vncloath themselues, and the Priestes and Ancients of the Temple, tooke the Image of paste, and spoi∣led it of all the ornaments, making many peeces of it, and of the consecrated Rolles, which they gaue to the Communion, beginning with the greater, and continuing vn∣to the rest both men, women, and children: who receiued it with teares, feare, re∣uerence, and other both affects, and effects of deuotion, saying, that they did eate the flesh and bones of their God. Such as had sicke folkes demanded thereof for them, and carried it with great reuerence and veneration. All such as did com∣municate were bound to giue the tenth part of this seede, whereof the Idoll was made. The solemnitie of the Idoll beeing ended, an olde man of great authoritie slept vp into a high place, and with a lode voice preached their lawe and ceremonies. This Historie deserueth the longer Relation, because it The New Catholikes of old Spaine, and old Caco∣likes of New Spaine: like in Supersti∣tion. so much resembleth the Po∣pish Chimuera, and monstrous conception of Transubstantiation, and of their Corpus Christ, Fe with other their Rites, to which Acosta also the relater compareth it, bla∣ming the Diuell, for vsurping the seruice, and imitating the Rites of their Church, whereas their Church deserueth blame for imitaring the Diuell and these his idolatrous Disciples, in their Stupendious monsters of opinion, and ridiculous, offices of supersti∣tion. But ou shall yet see a further resemblance. Next to this principall Feast of Vitzliputzli, Ac.l.5.c.2. was that of Tezcalipuca, of chiefe esti mation. This fell on the nineteenth day of May, and was called Tozcolt. It fell euery foure yeares with the Feast of Penance, where there was giuen Mexican Iubilee. full indul∣gence and remission of sinnes. In this day they did sacrifice a captiue which resem∣bled the Idoll Tezcalipuca. Vpon the euen this solemnitie, the Noble men came to the Temple, bringing a new garment like to that of the Idoll, which the Priest put vpon him, hauing first taken off his other garments, which they kept with great reuerence. There were in the Coffers of the Idoll Their Re∣liques. many ornaments, iewels, eare-rings, and other riches, as bracelets, and precious feathers, which serued to no vse, and were worshipped as the God himselfe. Besides that garment, they put vpon him certaine ensignes of Fea∣thers, with annes, shadowes, and other things. Beeing thus attired, they drew the Curtaine from before the doore, that all men might see. Then came forth one of the chiefe of the Temple, attired like to the Idoll, carrying flower in his hand, and a Flute of earth, hauing a very sharpe sound, and turning toward the East, he sounded it, and after that to the West, North, and South, he did the like. This done, hee put his finger into the aire, and then gathered vp the earth The Mexi∣cans Lent begunne not with thes, but with dust. which he put in his mouth, eating it in signe of adoration. The like did all that were pre∣sent, weeping, and falling flat to the ground, inuocating the darknesse of the night and the windes not to forsake them, or else to take away their liues and free them from the labours they endured therein. Theeues, Adulterers, Murtherers, and all other offenders had great feare and heauinesse whiles the Flute sounded, so as some could not hide nor dissemble their offences. By this meanes they all demanded no other thing of their God, but to haue their offences concealed: powring forth many teares, with great repentance and sorrow, offering great store of incense to appease their Gods. All the Martialists, and resolute spirits, addicted to the Watres, desired with great deuotion of GOD the Creator, of the Lord, for whom we liue, of the Sunne, and of other their Gods, that they would giue them victorie against their enemies, and
strength to take away many captiues for sacrifice. This ceremonious sounding of the Flute by the Priest continued ten daies, from the ninth of May to the nineteenth, vvith eating of earth, praying euery day with eyes lifted vp to heauen, sighes and grones as of men grieued for their sinnes. Yet did not they beleeue that there were Gomara wri∣teth otherwise as followeth in the end of this Chapter. any punish∣ments in the other life, but did these things to auert temporall punishments: they ac∣counted death an assured rest, and therefore voluntarily offered themselues thereto. The last day of the Feast the Priests drew forth a litter well furnished with Curtins and pen∣dants of diuers fashions: this litter had so many armes to hold by, as there were Mini∣sters to carry it: all which came forth besmeared with blacke, and long haire, halfe in tresses with white strings, and attired in the Idols liuerie. Vpon this litter they set the i∣mage of Tezcalipuca, and taking it on their shoulders, brought it to the foote of the staires. Then came forth the young men and Maidens of the Temple, carrying a great cord wreathed of chaines of rosted Mays, with which they enuironed the litter, and put a chaine of the same about the Idols necke, and a garland thereof on his head. The yong men and Maides weare chaines of rosted mais, and the men Garlands, the Maides Mitrs made of rods couered with the Mais, their feete couered with feathers, and their armes and cheekes painted. The image being placed in the litter they strewed round about store of the boughes of Manguey, the leaues whereof are pricking. They carried Their blou∣dy processions it on procession (two Priests going before with incense) in the circuite of the Court: and euery time the Priest gaue incense, they lifted vp their armes as high as they could to the Idoll and the Sunne. All the people in the Court turned round to the Place whither the Idol went, euery one carrying in his hand new cords of the threds of Man∣guey, a fadome long, with a knot at the end, wherewith they whipped themselues on the sholders euen as they doe here (saith Acosta) on holy Thursday. The people brought boughes and flowers to beautifie the Court and Temple. This done, euery one brought their offerings, Iewels, Incense, sweet Wood, Grapes, Mays, Quailes, and the rest. Quailes were the poore mans offering, which he deliuered to the Priests, who pull off their heads, and cast them at the foote of the Aultar, where they lost their bloud: and so they did of all other things which were offered. Euery one offered meate and fruit, according to his power which was laide at the foote of the Al∣tar and was carried to the Ministers chamber. The offering done, the people went to dinner: the yong men and Maidens of the tem∣ple being busied meane-while to serue the Idoll with all that was appoynted for him to eate, which was prepared by other women who had made a vow that day to serue the Idoll. These prepared meates in admirable varietie, which beeing ready, the Virgins went out of the Temple in procession, euery one carrying a little Basket of Bread in her hand, and in the other a dish of these meates. Before them marched an old man like to a Steward, attired in a white Surples downe to the calues of his legges, vpon a red iacket, which had wings in steede of sleeues, from which hung broad Ribands, and at the same a small Pumpion stucke full of flowers, and hauing many superstitious things within it. This old man comming neere to the foote of the staires made lowly reuerence. Then the Virgins with like reuerence presented their meates in order: this done, the old man returnes leading their Virgins into the Conuent. And then the yongmen and Ministers of the Temple come forth and gather vp their meate, which they carry to their Priests Chambers, who had fasted fiue daies, eating but once a day, not stirring all that time out of the Temple, where they whipped them∣selues as before is shewed. They did eate of these diuine meates (so they called it) nei∣ther might any other eate thereof. After dinner they assembled againe, and then was sacrificed one who had all that yeare borne the habit and resemblance of their Idoll. They went after this, into a holy place appointed for that purpose, whither the young men and Virgins of the Temple brought them their ornaments, and then they danced and sung, the chiefe priests drumming and sounding other instruments. The Noble men in ornaments like to the yongmen, danced round about them. They did not vsually kill any man that day, but him that was sacrificed, yet euery
fourth yeare they had others with him, which was the yeare of Iubilee and full pardons. After sunne-set the Virgins went all to their Conuent, and taking great dishes of earth full of bread, mixed with Honey, couered with small Panniars, wrought and fashioned with dead mens heads and bones, carried the same to the Idoll, and setting them down retired, their steward Vshering them as before. Presently came forth all the yong men in order, with Canes or Reedes in their hands, who began to runne as fast as they could to the top of the Temple-staires; euerie one striuing to come first to the Collation, The chiefe Priestes obserued who came first, second, third, and fourth, neglecting the rest, these they praised, and gaue them ornaments, and from thence forward they were respected as men of marke. The said Collation was all carried away by the yong men as great Relikes This ended, the yongmen and Maides were dismissed: and so I thinke would our Reader, who cannot but be glutted with, and almost surfet of our so long and taedious feasting. Yet let me intreat one seruice more, it is for the God of game, who I am sure will finde followers and Disciples too attentiue. For the Feastiuall of this Gaine God, Quetzaabcoalt, the Marchants, his deuoted and faithfull obseruantes, fortie daies before, bought a slaue well proportioned to re∣present that Idoll for that space. First they washed him twice in a lake, called the lake of the Gods, and being purified, they attired him like the Idoll. Two of the Anci∣ents of the Temple came to him nine daies before the Feast, and humbling themselues before him, said with a loude voice, Sir, nine daies hence your dancing must end, and you must die: and hee must answere, (whatsoeuer hee thinketh) In a good hower. They diligently obserued if this aduertisement made him sad, or if hee continued his dancing according to his wont. If they perceiued him sad, they tooke the sacrificing Rasors, which they washed and clensed form the bloud, which thereon had remained, and hereof with an other liquor made of Cacao, mixed a drinke, which they said would make him forget what had been said to him, and returne to his former iollitie. For they tooke this heauinesse in these men to be ominous. On the Feast day, after much honouring him, and incensing him, about midnight they sacrificed him, offering his heart to the Moone, and after cast it to the Idoll, letting the bodie fall downe the staires to the Marchants, who were the chiefe worshippers. These hearts of their sacrifices (some p.Mart.Dec.5 say) were burned after the Oblation to this Pla∣net and Idoll. The bodie they sauced and dressed for a banquet about breake of day, after they had bid the Idoll good morrow with a small daunce. This Temple of Quetzaalcoalt had Chappels as the rest, and Chambers, where were Conuents of Priests, yong men, Maides, and Children. One Priest alone was resident which was changed weekely. His charge that weeke, after he had instructed the chil∣dren, was to strike vp a Drumme at sunne-setring, at the sound whereof (which was heard throughout the Citie) euery one ended his Marchandise and retired to his house, all the Citie being as silent as if no body had beene there: at day breaking he did a∣gaine giue notice by his Drumme: for till that time it was not lawfull to stirre out of the Citie. In this temple was a Court wherin they danced, and on this Idols holyday, had e∣rected a Theater, thirtie roote square, finely decked and trimmed, in which were re∣presented Comedies, Maskes, & many other representations to expresse or cause mirth and ioy. The Mexicans Acost.l.6.c.7. had their schooles, and as it were Colleges, or Seminaries, where the Ancients taught the children to say by heart, the Orations, Discourses, Dialogues, & Poems, of their great Orators and chiefe men, which thus were preserued by Tradition as perfectly as if they had been written. And in their Temples, the sonnes of the chiefe men (as Peter P.Mart.Dec.5.l.4. Martyr reporteth) were shut vp at seuen yeares old, and neuer came forth thence till they were marriageable, and were brought forth to be contracted. All which time, they neuer cut their haire, they were clothed in blacke, abstained at certaine times of the yeare from meates engendring much bloud, and chastned their bodies with often fastings.
And although they had not letters, Acost.l.6.c.9 yet they had their wheele for computation of time, (as is said before) in which their writings were not as ours from the left hand to the right, or as of the Easterne Nations, from the right hand to the left, or as the Chinois, from the top to the bottome: but beginning below did mount vpwards; as in that mentioned wheele, from the Sunne which was made in the Center, vpwards to the circumference. Another manner of writing or signing, they had, in circle wise. In the Prouince of Yucatan or Honduras, there were bookes of the Leaues of trees, folded and squared, which contained the knowledge of the Planets, of beasts and o∣ther naturall things, and of their Antiquities, which some blindly-Zealous Spaniards, taking for inchantments, caused to be burned. The c.7. Indians to Tescuco, Talla, and Mexico, shewed vnto a Iesuite their Bookes, Histories, and Calendars, which in figures and Hieroglyphicks represented things after their manner. Such as had forme or figure, were represented by their proper Images, other things were represented by Charact∣ers; and I haue seene, saith Acosta, the Pater-noster, Aue Maria, and Confession thus written. As, for these words, I a Sinner doe confesse my selfe, they painted an Indian, kneeling on his knees, at a Religious mans feete; To God most mighty, they painted three faces with their crownes, according to that painting blasphemie of the popish i∣mage-mongers, and so they went on in that manner of picturing the wordes of their Popish Confession; where Images failed, setting Characters; Their Gomara.part 1.pag.3.69. bookes for this cause were great, which (besides their engrauings in stone, walles, or wood) they made of Cotton-wooll wrought into a kinde of paper, and of Leaues of Metl, fol∣ded vp like our broad-cloths, and written on both sides, Likewise they p.Mart.Dec.4.l.8. made them of the thinne inner-rinde of a Tree, growing vnder the vpper barke (as did al∣so the auncient Latines, from whence the names of Codex and Liber for a Booke, are deriued by our Grammarians.) They did binde them also into some forme of bookes, compacting them with Bitumen: their Characters vvere of Fish-hookes, Starres, Snares, Files, &c. Thus did they keepe their priuate and publike re∣cords. There Gomara vbi sup. were some in Mexico, that vnderstood each other by whistling, which was ordinarily vsed by louers and theeues, a language admirable euen to our wits, so high∣ly applauded by our selues, and as deepely deiecting these Nations in termes of fee∣linesse and simplicitie. Yea, in Our Virginia (so I hope and desire) Cap. Smith tolde mee that there are some, which the spacious diuorce of the wide streame notwith∣standing, will by hallowes and howps vnderstand each other, and entertaine confe∣rence. The numbers of the Mexicans are simple, till you come to six, then they count six and one, six and two, six and three; ten is a number by it selfe, which in the insuing numbers, is repeated as in other languages till fifteene, which they reckon in one terme, ten, fiue, and one, and so the rest to twenty. The Mexicans Gom.pag.38. did beleeue concerning the soule, that it was immortall, and that men receiued either ioy or paine, according to their deserts and liuing in this world. They held for an assured faith, that there were nine places appointed for soules, & the chiefest place of glory to be neere vnto the Sunne, where the soules of good men slaine in the Warres, and those which were sacrificed are placed: that the soules of wicked men abide in the earth, and were diuided after this sort: children which were dead-borne, went to one place: those which died of age or other disease went to another: those which died of wounds or contagion, to a third: those which were executed by order of Iustice, to a fourth; but parricides, which slew their Parents, or which slew their Wiues or Children, to a fift. Another place was for such as slew their Maisters or Religious persons. Acost. l.7.c.. Acosta seemeth to deny that the Indians beleeued any punishments after death, and yet sets downe an Oration made at Mutezuma's election, wherein hee is said to haue pierced the nine Vaults of heauen, which seemes to allude to this of Gomara. Their burialls also were diuers, as is shewed before: and here may  ad∣ded that hee which died for Adulterie, vvas shrowded like vnto their God of Lecherie, called Tlazonlterel: hee that vvas drowned, like to Tlalos: hee that
died of drunkennes like to the God of Wine, Ometochtli, the Souldiour, like to Vit∣ziliputzli. But least you wish mee buried in like manner, which trouble as much my English Reader, with New-Spaines redious Relations, as Old Spaines fastidious insul∣ting spirits haue sometime done in English Nations, I will aduenture further into the adioining Prouinces. CHAP. XIIII. Of lucatan, Nicaragua, and other places betwixt New Spaine, and the Straites of Dariene. IVcatan Lop.de Gom. part 1.pa.10.& gen. hist.c.52. is a point of Land extending it selfe into the Sea, ouer a∣gainst the Ile Cuba, and was first discouered by Francis Hernandes de Cordona in the yeare 1517. at which time one asking an Indian how this countrey was called, he answered Tectetan Tectetan, that is, I vn∣derstand you not, which wordes the Spaniards corrupting both in the sound and interpretation called it Iucatan, Iames Velasques Gouer∣nour of Cuba, sent his Cousin Iohn de Grijalua the yeare after, who there fought with the Indians at Campotan, and was hurt. The Spaniards P.Mart. Dec. 4.1. went to a Citie on the shore which for the greatnes they called Cayro of that great Citie in Egypt. Here they found Turreted Houses, Stately Temples, waies pasted, and faire market places. The houses were of stone or Bricke, and Lime, very artificially composed. To the square Courts, or first habitations of their houses they ascend by ten or twelue steppes. The roofe was of Reedes, or stalkes of Hearbes. The Indians gaue the Spaniards Iewels of Golde, very faire and cunningly wrought, and were requited with Vestures of Silke and Wooll, Glasse-Beades, and little Bells. Their apparell was of Cotton in manifold fashions and colours. They frequented their Temples much, to the which the better sort paued waies with stone from their houses. They were great Idolaters, and were circumcised, but not all. They liued vnder lawes, and trafficked together with great fidelitie, by ex∣changing commodities without money. The Spaniards saw Crosses amongst them, and demanding whence they had them, they said that a certaine man of excellent beauty passing by that coast, left them that notable token to remember him: others said, a certaine man brighter then the Sunne died in the working thereof. The Spaniards sai∣led thence to This towne was taken by Master William Parker. Anno 1596. Campechium, a towne of three thousand houses. Here they saw a square Stage or Pulpit foure cubits high, partly of clammie Bitumen, and partly of smal stones, whereto the image of a man cutt in Marble, was ioined, two foure-footed vnknowne beasts fastning vpon him, as if they would teare him in peeces. And by the image stood a Serpent all besmeared with bloud, deuouring a Lyon, it was seuen and fortie foote long, and as bigge as an Oxe. These things I mention as testimonies of their Art in these barbarous places, and perhaps of their deuotion also, Grijalua or Grisalua seeing a Tower sarre off at Sea, by direction thereof, came to an Iland called Cosumel, agree∣ing in priuate and publike manner of life with them of Iucatan: Their houses, Tem∣ples, apparell, and trade of Marchandise all one: their houses some where couered with Reedes, and where quarries were, with slate: many houses had marble pillars. They sound ancient Towers there, and the ruines of such as had been broken down and destroyed: there was one whereto they ascended by eighteene steps or staires. The Gouernour whom they supposed to be a Priest, conducted them to the Tower: in the top whereof they erected a Spanish Banner, and called also the Iland Santa Cruce. In the Tower they found chambers, wherein were marble Images, and some of Earth in the similitude of Beares. These they inuoked with loude singing all in one tune, and sa∣crificed vnto them with somes and sweet odours, worshipping them as their houshold Gods. There they performed their diuine ceremonies and adoration: they were also circumcised.
Gomara Gomar.gen. hist.ca.54. saith, that heere, and at Xicalanco, the Deuill vsed to appeare visibly, and that these two were great in estimation for holinesse; euery city had their Temple, or al∣tar, where they worshipped their Idoles, amongst which were many Crosses of Wood and Brasse, whereby some conceiue that some Spaniards had recourse hither when Ro∣derigo was defeated, and Spaine ouerrunne by the Saracens. In both Goma part.1. pag.36. these places they sacrificed men: which Cortes perswaded them to cease. The Temple in Cosumil or A∣cusamil was built like a square Tower, broad at the foote, with steps round about, and from the middest vpward very strait: the top was hollow and couered with straw: it had foure windowes and porches. In the hollow place was their Chappell, where stoode their Idoles. In a Temple by the Sea side was an vncouth Idoll, great and hollow, fast∣ned in the wall with lime: it was made of earth. Behind this Idoles backe was the Ve∣strie, where the ornaments of the Temple were kept. The Priests had a little secret doore hard adioyning to the Image, by which they crept into his hollow panch, and thence answered the people that came thither with prayers and petitions, making the simple people beleeue it was the voice of the God, which therefore they honored more then any other, with many perfumes and sweet smells. They offered bread, fruit, quailes bloud, and of other birds, dogges, and sometimes men. The fame of this Idoll & Oracle brought many Pilgrimes to Acusamil from many places. At the foote of this Temple was a plot like a churchyard, well walled, and garnished with Pinnacles, in the mid∣dest whereof stood a Crosse of ten foote long, which they adored for the God of raine. At all times when they wanted raine, they would goe thither on procession deuoutly, and offered to the Crosse, quailes sacrificed, no sacrifice beeing so acceptable. They burnt sweet gumme to perfume him with, besprinckling the same with water, and by this meanes they thought to obtaine raine. They could neuer knowe, saieth Gomara, how that God of Crosse came amongst them, for in all those parts of India there is no memory of any preaching of the Gospel that had bin at any time. What others thinke, and what some Indians answered, concerning it, is said before. Benzo M. Benzo libr.2.ca.15. writeth, that they did not eate the flesh of these men which they sacrificed: and that they were first subdewed by Francis Montegius, whose cruelties were such that Alquinotep a Cacique or Indian Lord aboue an hundred and ten yeares old, and a Christian, told him, That when hee was a yongman, there was a sickenesse of worms, that they had thought all would haue died: (they were not onely eiected by vomite, but did eate out themselues a passage through mens bodies) and not long before the Spa∣niards arriuall, they had two battells with the Mexicans, in which a hundred and fiftie thousand men perished. But all this was light, in respect of that Spanish burthen. Guatimala Botero libr. 5 part. 1. Guatimala or Saint Iames. comes next to our consideration, a Prouince of pleasant aire, and fer∣tile soile, where groweth aboundance of their Cacao, which is a fruit that serues the Indians for meate, drinke, and money. The city (which beareth the same name) was first at the foote of a Vulcano or hill which casteth fire, but because in the yeere 1542, Benzo and Gomara say Sept 8. 1541. on the six and twentieth day of December, a Lake hidden in the bowells of that hill, brake forth in many places, and with a terrible violence ruined the most part of the Ci∣tie: it was remoued two miles thence, together with the Episcopall Sea, and the kings Councell. But in the yere 1581 there issued from another Vulcan two miles off, or some∣what more, such an irruption of fire, as threatned to consume euery thing. The day following followed such a showre of ashes that it filled the valley, and almost buried the Citie. And yet were not all the throwes passed of this hills monstrous trauells, but the yeare after, for the space of foure and twenty houres, thence issued a streame of fire, that dranke vp fiue streames of water, burned the stones and rockes, rent the Aire with thunders, and made it a wauing and mouing Sea of fire. Before Gas.En.libr. 3.ca.6. that first eruption of waters, some Indians came and tolde the Bishop, that they had heard an vncredible noyse and murmuirng at the foote of the hill, but hee reprooued them, saying, they should not trouble themselues with vaine and superstitious feares; about two of the clocke in the night following happened that deluge, which carried many houses, and whatsoeuer stoode in the way, in which, fiue hundred and twenty Spaniards perished, and scarce any mention of the houses remained.
It is worthy recitall which Benzo H. Benzo libr. 2 ca.16. Gomar.biser. gen.ca.209. and Gomara haue recorded, that Peter Al∣varado the Governour (who by licence of the Pope had married two sisters, the Lady Frances, and the Lady Beatrice della Culva) having perished by a mischance, his wife not onely painted her house with Sorrowes blacke liuery, and abstained from meate and sleepe, but in a madde impiety said, God could now doe her no greater euill. Yet for all this her sorrow, shee caused the Citizens to bee sworne vnto her governement (a new thing in the Indies.) Soone after, this inundation happened, which first of all as∣sailed the Governours house, and caused this impotent and impatient Ladie now to bethinke her of devotion, and betake her to her Chappell, with eleuen of her Maides, where leaping on the Altar, and clasping about an Image, the force of the water ru∣ined the Chappell; whereas if shee had stayed in her bed-chamber, shee had escaped death. They tell of vncouth noyses, and hideous apparitions which then were seene. Benzo obserued by his owne experience, that this country is much subiect to Earth∣quakes. The Guatimalans, in manner of life resemble the Mexicans and Nicaraguans. Fondura Benzo libr. 2. ca.15. or Hondura is next to Guatimala, wherein were (saieth Benzo) at the Spaniards first comming thither foure hundred thousand Indians, but when I was there, scarcely eight thousand were left: the rest being slaine or sold or consumed by the mines: and those which are left, both here, and in other places, place their habitation as farre as they can, where the Spaniard shall bee no cie-sore vnto them. The Spaniards in this prouince planted fiue Spanish Colonies, which all scarcely could number a hundred and twenty houses. Nicaragua Chap.16. extendeth it selfe from the Chiulatecan mines of Fondura, toward the South-Sea. This Region is not great, but fertile, and therefore called of the Spaniards Mahumets Paradise, for the plentie of all things; yet in the Summer time it is so scorched with heate, that men cannot travell but in the night. Six moneths, from Maie to October, are pestered with continuall showres, which the other six wholly want: The Parrots are heere as troublesome as Crowes and Rookes with vs, and they are for∣ced to keepe their corne in like manner from their spoyling. The people are of like con∣dition to the Mexicans; they feede on mans flesh. To their daunces they flocke two or three hundred in a company, which are performed with great varietie of gestures, ve∣stures, and passions: Euerie man in, and, euery man out of his humour. Thirtie and fiue miles from Legeon or Lyon, an Episcopall City in this Region, is a Vulcano or flaming bill, the fire whereof may be seene (in the night) aboue 100 miles. Some had a conceit, that molten gold was the matter of this fire. And therefore a certaine Dominican cau∣sed a kettle and long chaine of iron, to be let downe into this fiery concavitie, where by the violence of the heat, the kettle & part of the chaine was molten. He makes a bigger and stronger, but returnes with like successe, and this added, that himselfe and his 2 com∣panions by eruption of fire, had almost bin consumed. Gomara Gom gen. bistor.ca.20. calles this fire Blasio de Ynnesta, and the hil, Masaya. It goes downe two hundred & fifty braces or yards. In this Countrey they vsed sodomie and sacrifices of men. Of this name Nicaragua, Gilgon∣sales, that first of the Spaniards discouered these parts, found a King with whom he had much conference, whom he perswaded to become a Christian: although his prohibi∣tion of warres, and dauncing, did much trouble him. This Nicaragua P.M.Dec.6. libr.4. demaunded them if the Christians had any knowledge of the Floud, which drowned all the Earth, with men and beasts (as he had heard his Progenitors say) and whether another were to come, whether the earth should be ouer-turned, or the heauen fall: when, and how the Moone and Starres should loose their light and motion: who moued those heauenlie bodies, where the soules should remaine, and what they should doe, being freed from the bodie, whether the Pope died, whether the Spaniards came from heauen, and many other strange questions admirable in an Indian. They worshipped the Sunne and other Idoles which Nicaragua suffered Gilgonsales to take out of the great Temple. In Nicaragua Gom.ca.206. there were fiue linages, and different languages: the Coribici, Ci∣ocotoga, Ciondale, Oretigua, and the Mexican; though this place was a thousand miles from Mexico, yet were they like them in speech, apparell, and religion: they had also the same figures instead of letters, which those of Culhua had, and bookes a spanne
broad, and twelue spannes long, doubled, of many colours. They differ, as in langua∣ges, so in religions, Of their religious rites thus writeth Gomara: their Priests were all married, except their Confessors, which heard Confessions, and appointed Penances, ac∣cording to the qualitie of the fault: they reuealed not the Confession: they appoynted the holydayes, which were eighteene. When they sacrificed, they had a knife of flint, wherwith they opened him that was sacrificed. The priests appointed the sacrifices, how many men, whether they were to be women, or slaues taken in battell, that all the peo∣ple might know how to celebrate the Feasts, what prayers and what offerings to make. The Priest went three times about the captiue, singing in a dolefull tune, and sodainly opens his breast, annoints his face with the bloud, takes out his heart, diuideth his bo∣die. The heart is giuen to the Prelate, the feete and hands to the King, the buttockes to the taker, the rest to the people. The heads of the sacrifices are set on trees, planted there for that purpose, euery tree hath figured in it the name of the Prouince where∣with they haue warres. Vnder these trees they many times sacrifice men and children of the Countrey, and of their owne people, being first bought: for it was lawfull for the father to sell his children. Those which the Pet Mart. dec.6.lib.6. & 7. Kings bring vp of their owne people, with better fare then ordinarie for sacrifice, are made beleeue they shall be some canonized Wights, or heauenly Deities, and therefore take it gladly. They did not eate the flesh of these, as they did of the captiues. When they eate their sacrificed captiues, they made great feasts, and the Priests and religious men dranke much wine and smoke: their wine is of prunes, Whiles the Priest annoynts the cheekes and mouth of the Idole with the bloud, the others sing, and the people make their prayers with great deuo∣tion and teares, and after goe on procession (which is not done in all Feastes.) The religious haue white cotton coates, and other ornaments which hang downe from the shoulders to the legges, thereby to put a difference betweene them and others. The Lay-men haue their banners, with that Idole which they most esteeme, and bagges with dust and bodkins, the yong-men haue their bowes, darts, arrowes; and the guide of all is the image of the Deuill set vpon a launce, carried by the most ancient and honourable Priest. They goe in order, the religious singing till they come to the place of their Idolatrie, where being arriued, they spread couerings on the ground, or strew it with roses and flowers, because their Idoles should not touch the ground, and the banner being stucke fast, the singing ceaseth, and the Prelate beginning, all the rest follow, and draw bloud, some from their tongues, some from their eares, some from their member, and euery man as his devotion liketh best, and with that bloud an∣noynt the Image. In the meane while, the youths skirmish and daunce for the honour of their Feast: they cure the wounds, with the poulder of herbs and coles. In some of these processions they hallow Mayz, besprinckling the same with the bloud of their pri∣vities, and eate it. They may haue many women, but one is their lawfull wife, which they marry thus; the Priest takes the Bridegroome and the Bride by the little fingers, sets them in a Chamber at a fire, and giues them certaine instructions, and when the fire is out, they are married. If he take her for a Virgin, and finds her otherwise, he may divorce her. Many bring their wiues to the Caciques or Lords to corrupt them, esteeming it an ho∣nour. Their Pet.Mart.Dec.6. Temples were low darke rooms, which they vsed for their treasury also & armory. Before the Temple was an high Altar for the Sacrifices, whereon also the Priest played the Preacher first, and then the Butcher. Adulterers are beaten, but not slaine; the adulterous wife is divorced, and may not marry againe, and her parents are dishonoured. Their husbands suffer them to lie with others in some Feasts of the yeere. Hee that forceth a Virgin, is a slaue, or payeth her dowrie: if a slave doe it with his Maisters daughter, they are both buried quicke. They haue common brothels. A thiefe hath his haire cut off, and is made his slaue from whom hee hath stollen, vntill he hath made satisfaction, which if he deferre long, he is sacrificed, They had no punishment for him which should kill a Cacique, for (they said) such a thing could not happen. The riches of Nicaragua Botero. consisteth much in a great
lake three hundred miles long, and being within twelue miles of the South Sea, doth disemboque it selfe in the North Sea, a great way off. In this lake of Nicaragua are ma∣ny and great fishes. Benzo libr. 2.ca.14. Gamara part.2. ca.32. One strange kind is that, which the Inhabitants of Hispaniola call Manati: as for these Inhabitants of the place, the Spanish iniuries haue chaced them thence. This fish somewhat resembleth the Otter, is 25 foot long, twelue thicke, the head and taile was like a Cowe, with small eyes, his backe hard and hairie, hee hath one∣ly two feet at the shoulders, and those like an Elephants. The females bring forth yong, and nourish them with the vdder, like a Cowe. I haue seene and eaten of them (saith Benzo) the taste is like swines flesh; they eate grasse. There Pet.Mart. Dec.3.libr.8. was a King in Hispaniola, which put one of them (being presented him by his Fishermen) into a lake of standing waters, where it liued fiue and twenty yeares: when any of the seruants came to the lake and called Matto Motto, shee would come and receiue meate at their hands: and if any would be ferried ouer the lake, shee willingly yeelded her backe, and perfor∣med this office faithfully, yea shee hath carried tenne men at once singing or playing. A Spaniard had once wronged her, by casting a dart at her; and therefore after that, when she was called, shee would plunge downe againe, otherwise to the Indians shee remayned officious. Shee would bee as full of play as a Monkie, and would wrastle with them: especially shee was addicted to one young man, which vsed to feede her. This proceeded, partly from her docible nature, partly, because being taken young, shee was kept vp a while at home, in the Kings house, with bread. This fish liueth both on land and water. The Riuer swelling ouer his bankes, into the Lake, this fish followed the streame, and was seene no more. There was an other strange creature in Nicaragua (they call it Cascuij) like a blacke hogge, with small eyes, wide eares, clouen feete, a short truncke or snowt like an Elephant, of so lowde a braying, that hee would make men deafe. An other there is with a naturall purse vnder her bellie, wherein shee putteth her young: it hath the bodie of a Foxe, handed and footed like a Monkie. The Battes in these partes are terrible for biting. The Inhabitants neere the Riuer Suerus are not differing from the rest, but that they eate not mans flesh. Next, is that necke or narrow extent of Land stretching betweene the North and South Seas, and (as it were) knitting the two great Peninsula's of the North and South America together. Nombre de Dios signifieth the name of GOD, occasioned by the words of Di∣dacus Niquesa, who after disastrous aduentures elsewhere, came hither, and here bade his men goe on shore in the name of GOD; whereupon the Colonie and Plantation there, was so called: It hath a bad situation; and small habitation. Baptista Anto∣nio the King of Spaines Surueyour counselled to bring Nombre de Dios to Puerto Bello. It was remoued from the former seate, in the yeare of out Lord 1584. Sir Thomas Baskervile burnt it, and went from thence with his armie towards Panama, in the yeare 1595. Darien was called Antiqua Darienis, because Ancisus vowed to our Ladie at Sivill called Maria Antiqua, if she would helpe him in those Indian Conquests, hee would turne the Caciques house into a Temple: there he planted a Colonie. It would be tedious to tell of the stirres and ciuil vnciuil brawles betwixt the Spani∣ards in these parts Vasques Valboa imprisoned Ancisus, and after recouered his credit by discoverie of the South-Sea. For whiles the Spaniards contended about the weight and shaing of their gold which a Cacique had giuen them, this Cacique being present, hurled downe the gold, not a little maruelling (as he said) that they would so much con∣tend for that, as if they could eate or drinke it: But if they liked it so well, hee would carry them where their golden thirst should bee satisfied. Hee was deceiued in the na∣ture of that dropsie thirst, which, as a fire quenched with oyle, receiues thence greater strength: but hee deceiued not them in his promise, bringing them to the South-Sea: where Valboa named one prouince, Golden Castile. And for that which hee spake of their strife, Benzo libr. .ca.23. as if they could eate or drinke those mettalles, the cruelties of the Spani∣ards
were such, as the Indians, when they got any of them, would binde their hands and feete, and laying them on their backes, would poure gold into their mouthes, say∣ing in insultation, Eate gold, Christian. This Valboa was put to death by Arias his fa∣ther in law. But now we haue mentioned the first Spaniards which planted these parts, it shall not be a misse to mention some hardships the Spaniards sustained before they could here settle themselues, which may bee an answer to those nice and delicate conceits that in our Virginian Expedition cast off all hope, because of some disasters. How the Spani∣ards dealt one with an other, and how the Indians dealt with them, you haue heard; worse hath not followed from any turbulent emulous spirit of our owne; or hostile, of the Virginian, in this Plantation. And as for famine, Nicuesa's men were so pinched, that (not to speake of those which perished) one solde Prt.Mart: Dec.2.libr.10. an old leane mangie dogge to his fellowes for many castellans of gold: these flayed the dogge, and cast his mangie skinne, with the bones of the head among the bushes. The day following one of them findes it full of maggots, and shaking: but famine had neither eies nor sent: he brought it home, sod, and eate it, and found many customers which gaue a Seuen shil∣lings and six pedce. Castellan a dish for that mangie broth. An other found two toads and sodde them, which a sicke man bought for two fine shirts curiously wrought with gold. Others found a dead man, rot∣ten, and stinking, which putrified carkasse they rosted, and eate. And thus from seuen hundred and seuentie men, they were brought so lowe, that scarse fortie (shadowes of men) remained to inhabite Driena. Much like to this was their successe at the riuer of Plate. What Iohn Oxenam, Sir Francis Drake, Master Christopher Newport, and other our worthy Country-men haue achieued in these parts against the Spani∣ards, Master Hackecluyt in his Voyages relateth. It is time for vs to pass beyond these Darien Straits, vnto that other great Chersonesus or Pe∣ruvian America. (***)
RELATIONS OF THE DISCOVERIES, REGIONS, AND RELIGIONS, OF THE NEW WORLD. OF CVMANA, GVIANA, BRA∣SIL, CHICA, CHILI, PERV, AND OTHER REGIONS OF AMERICA PERVVIANA, AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS. THE NINTH BOOKE. CHAP. I. Of the Southerne AMERICA, and of the Countries on the Sea-Coast betwixt Dariene and Cumana. THis Peninsula of the New World extending it selfe into the South, is in forme somewhat like to Africa, and both Gas.Ens, l.3.c.24. to some huge Pyramis. In this, the Basis or ground is the Northerly part, called Terra Fir∣ma, from whence it lesseneth it selfe by degrees, as it draweth neerer the Magellan Straits, where the toppe of this Spire may fitly be placed. On the East side it is washed with the North Ocean, as it is ter∣med: On the West with that of the South, called al∣so the Peaceable. It is Botero, part.1. l.6. supposed to haue sixteene thousand myles in compasse, foure thousand in length; the breadth is vnequall. The Easterne part thereof, betweene the Riuers Maragnon and Plata, is chalenged by the Portugalls; the rest by the Spaniard. From the North to the South are Ledges of Mountaines, the toppes whereof are said to be higher then that Birds will visit; the bottomes yeeld the greatest Riuers in the World, and which most enrich the Oceans Store-house. Orenoque, Maragnon, and Plata seeme to be the Indian Triumviri, Generals of those Riuer-Armies, and Neptunes great Collectors of his waterie tributes. Orenoque for Shippes is nauigable a thousand myles; for
lesse Vessells, two thousand; in some places twentie myles broad; in some, thirtie. Berreo affirmed to Sir Walter Raleigh, That a hundred Riuers fell into it, marching vnder his name and colours, the leaft as bigge as Rio Grande one of the greatest Ri∣uers of America. It extendeth two thousand myles East and West, and commaun∣deth eight hundred myles, North and South. Plata, taking vp all the streames in his way, is so full swolne with his encreased store, that he seemeth rather with bigge lookes to bidde defiance to the Ocean, then to acknowledge homage, opening his mouth fortie leagues wide, as if he would deuoure the same, and with his vomited a∣bundance maketh the salt waters to recoyle, following fresh in this pursuit, till in salt sweates at last hee melteth himselfe in the Combate. Maragnon is farre greater, whose water hauing furrowed a Channell of six thousand myles, in the length of his winding passage, couereth threescore and tenne leagues in breadth, and hideth his Bankes Caelum undiq, & undiq pontus Nil nisi pontus & aer. on both sides from him which sayleth in the middest of his proud Current, making simple eyes beleeue, that the Heauens alway descend to kisse and embrace his waues. And sure our more-straitned world would so farre be accessorie to his as∣piring, as to style him with the royall title of Sea, and not debase his greatnesse with the meaner name of a Riuer? This Southerne halfe of America hath also, at the Ma∣gellane Straits, contracted, and (as it were) shrunke in it selfe, refusing to be exten∣ded further in so cold a Climate. The manifold riches of Mettalls, Beasts, and o∣ther things, in the beginning of the former Booke haue beene declared; and in this, as occasion moueth, shall be further manifested. The Men are the worst part, as being in the greatest parts thereof inhumane and brutish. The Spanish Townes in this great Tract, and their Founders, are set downe by Pedro de Pedro de Cieza de Leon.Chron. del Peru. Cieza; I ra∣ther intend Indian Superstitions then Spanish Plantations in this part of my Pil∣grimage. Of the Townes of Eastward frō this Towne certain Negro∣slaues made a head, and ioy∣ning with the Indians, vsed to robbe the Spaniards. Benzo.l.2.c.9. Nombre de Dios, seuenteene leagues from Panama, the one on the North Sea, the other on the South, and of Dariene, we last tooke our leaues, as vncertaine whether to make them Mexican, or Peruvian, being borderers, and set in the Confines betwixt both. The moorish soyle, muddie water, and grosse Ayre conspire with the heauenly Bodies to make Dariene vnholesome: the myrie streame runneth (or creepeth rather) very slowly; the water Linschoten. P.Mart.Dec.3.l.6. but sprinkled on the house∣floore, engendreth Toades and Wormes. They Gomar.Gen.Hist.c.67. haue in this Prouince of Dariene store of Crocodiles, one of which kinde, Cieza sayth, was found fiue and twentie foot long; Swine without tayles, Cats with great tayles, Beasts clouen-footed like Kine, otherwise resembling Mules, sauing their spacious eares, and a trunke or snout like an Elephant: there are Leopards, Ly∣ons, Tygres. On the right and left hand of Dariene are found twentie Riuers, which yeeld Gold. The men P.M.Dec.3. lib.4. are of good stature, thinne haired; the women weare Rings on their eares and noses, with quaint ornaments on their lippes. The Lords marrie as many wiues as them listeth, other men one or two. They forsake, change, and sell their wiues at pleasure. They haue publike Stewes of women, and of men also in ma∣ny places, without any discredit; yea, this priuiledgeth them from following the Warres. The young girles hauing conceiued, eate certaine herbes, to cause abortion. Their Lords and Priests consult of Warres after they haue drunke the smoke of Tobacco. a certaine hearbe. The women follow their husbands to the Warres, and know how to vse a Bow. They all paint themselues in the Warres. They need no Head-peeces, for their heads are so hard Ouiedo calls these Hard∣heads Corati. , that they will breake a Sword, being smitten there∣on. Wounds receiued in Warre, are the badges of honour, whereof they glorie much, and thereby enioy some Franchises. They brand their prisoners, and pull out one of their teeth before. They will sell their children; are excellent swimmers, both men and women; accustoming themselues twice or thrice a day thereunto. Their Priests are their Physicians, and Masters of Ceremonies; for which cause, and because they haue conference with the Deuill, they are much esteemed. P.Cieza chron. Per. p.1.c.8. They haue no Temples, nor Houses of deuotion. The Deuill they honor much, which in terrible shapes doth somtimes appeare vnto thē; as I (saith Cieza) haue heard some of them say.
They beleeue, that there is one GOD in Heauen, to wit, the Sunne, and that the Moone is his wife; and therefore worship these two Planets. They worship the De∣uill also, and paint him in such forme as hee appeareth to them, which is of diuerse sorts. They offer Bread, Smoke, Fruits, and Flowers, with great deuotion. Any one may cut off his arme which stealeth Mais. Enciso, with his Armie of Spaniards, seeking to subdue these parts, vsed a Spanish tricke, telling the Indians, That hee sought their conuersion to the Faith, and therefore discoursed of one GOD, Creator of all things, and of Baptisme; and after other things of this nature, lesse to his pur∣pose, he told them, That the Pope is the Vicar of CHRIST in all the World, with absolute power ouer mens Soules and Religions; and that he had giuen those Coun∣tries to the most mightie King of Spaine, his Master, and hee was now come to take possession, and to demaund Gold for tribute. The Indians answered, That they liked well what he had spoken of one GOD, but for their Religion, they would not dis∣pute of it, or leaue it: And for the Pope, he should be liberall of his owne; neyther seemed it, that their King was mightie, but poore, that sent thus a begging. But what wordes could not, their Swords effected, with the destruction of the In∣dians. The soyle of Vraba is so fattened with a streame therein, that in eight and twentie dayes the Seedes of Cucumbers, Melons, and Gourds, will ripen their Fruits. There is P. Mart. Dec.3.l.6. a Tree in those Countries, whose leaues, with the bare touch, cause great blisters: the sauour of the Wood is poyson; and cannot be carried without danger of life, ex∣cept by the helpe of another hearbe, which is an Antidote to this venomous Tree. King P.Mart. Dec.2.l.4. Abibeiba had his Pallace in a Tree, by reason of the moorish situation and of∣ten inundation of his Land. Vasques could not get him downe, till he began to cut the Tree, and then the poore King came downe, and bought his freedome at the Spa∣niards price. Carthagena was so called, for some resemblance in the situation to a Citie in Spaine of that name. Sir Francis Drake tooke it. The Indians thereabouts vsed poysoned Arrowes: the women warre as well as the men. Enciso tooke one, who with her owne hands had killed eight and twentie Christians. They did eate the enemies which they killed. They vsed to put in their Sepulchres gold, feathers, & other riches. Betweene Carthagena and Martha runneth a swift Riuer, called Rio Grande, which maketh the Sea-water to giue place; and they which passe by, may in the Sea take in of this water fresh. In the Valley of Tunia Linschot. l.2. , or Tomana, are Mines of Emeralds. The people worship the Sunne for their chiefe God, with such awfull deuotion, that they dare not looke stedfastly vpon it: the Moone also they worship, but in an inferiour degree. In their Warres, in stead of Ensignes, they tye the bones of certaine men (who in their liues had beene valiant) vpon long staues, to prouoke others fo the like fortitude. They bu∣rie their Kings with golden Neck-laces, set with Emeralds, and with Bread and Wine. The people about Rio Grande are Caniballs, as also about S. Martha. The Tunians vse poysoned Arrowes: and when they goe to the Warres, they carrie their Idoll Chi∣appen with them; vnto whome, before they enter into the Field, they offer many sacri∣fices of liuing men, being the children of slaues, or of their enemies, painting all the Image with bloud; which done, they eate the flesh. Returning Conquerors, they hold great Feasts, with Dauncing, Leaping, Singing, drinking themselues drunke, and a∣gaine besmeare their Image with bloud. If they were ouercome, they sought by new Sacrifices to appease Chiappen. They demaunded counsell of their Gods for their Marriages, and other Affaires. For these consultations they obserued a kind of Lent two moneths, in which they lay not with women, nor eate Salt. They had Monaste∣ries of Boyes and Girles, where they liued certaine yeares. They corrected publike faults, as Stealing, and Killing, by cutting off the eares, and nose; hanging; and if he were a Nobleman, by cutting off his haire. In gathering Emeralds, they first vsed certaine Charmes. They vsed to sacrifice Birds, and many other things.
S. Martha standeth about fiftie leagues from Carthagena, at the foot of certaine Hills, alway crowned with Snow. The Indians Nic.Monard, c.53. Gomar. Hist. Gen. c.71. here are very valorous, and vse poy∣soned Arrowes. They make bread of Iucca, a Root as bigge as a mans arme, or legge, the iuice whereof is poyson in the Islands, and therefore they presse it betweene two stones: but in the firme Land they drinke it raw; and both heere and there sodden, they vse it for Vineger; and being sodden till it be very thicke, for Honey. This bread is their Casaui, not so good as that of Mais. I haue seene a Plant of this herbe grow∣ing in M. Gerards M.Gerard. Garden, the picture whereof he hath expressed in his Herball. The people are abhominable Sodomites, a badge whereof they ware about their neckes; a chayne, with the resemblance of two men committing this villanie. In Gayra the Sodomites were attyred like women, others were shauen like Friers. They had wo∣men which preserued their Virginitie: these addicted themselues to Hunting, with Bow and Arrowes, alone: they might lawfully kill any that sought to corrupt them. These people were Caniballs, and eate mans flesh, fresh and pouldered: the young boyes which they tooke they gelded, to make them fatter for their Tables, as wee doe Capons. They set vp the heads of those they killed, at their gates, for a memoriall, and wore their teeth about their neckes for a brauerie. They worship P.Messia, l.5. c.13. the Sunne and Moone, and burne thereto perfumes of Herbes, and Gold, and Emeralds. They sacri∣fice slaues. Venezvel is so called, because it is built vpon a plaine Rocke, in the waters of a Lake. The women of this Countrey paint their breasts and armes: all the rest of their bodie is naked, except their priuie parts. The maids are knowne by their colour, and greatnesse of their girdle. The men carrie their members in a shell. There are many filthie Sodomites. They pray to Idols, and to the Deuill, whome they paint in such forme as he appeareth to them. They paint their bodies in this sort. He that hath kil∣led one enemie in the Warres, paints one of his armes; the second time his breast; and when he hath killed a third, he painteth a line from his eyes to his eares: and this is his Knight-hood. Their Priests are their Physicians, who being sent for by a sicke man, aske the patient, if he beleeue that they can helpe him; and then lay their hands vpon the place where they say their paines are: if he recouer not, they put the fault in him, or in their Gods. They lament their dead Lords in Songs in the night time, made of their prayses: that done, they rost them at a fire, and beating them to poulder, drinke them in Wine, making their bowells their Lords Sepulchres. In Zonpaciay they burie their Lords with much Gold, Iewells, and Pearles, and set vpon the graue foure stickes in a square, within which they hang his weapons, and many viands to eate. From the Cape Vela, the space of two thousand myles alongst the Coast, is the fishing for Pearles, discouered by Christopher Columbus, in the yeare 1498, which say∣led all along this Coast. In P.M.Dec.1.lib.. Gomar.c.74. to c.84. Curiana they receiued the Spaniards with great ioy, and for Pinnes, Needles, Bells, Glasses, and such trifles, gaue them many strings of Pearles: for foure Pinnes they would giue a Peacocke; for two, a Phesant; for one, a Turtle-doue: And when they asked, What they should doe with this new Merchan∣dise of Pinnes and Needles, seeing they were naked? they shewed them the vse to picke their teeth, and to picke out thornes in their feet. These Indians had Rings of Gold, and Iewells made with Pearles, after the formes of Birds, Fishes, and Beasts: They had also the Touch-stone for their Mettall, and Weights to weigh the same, things not elsewhere found in India. They make their teeth white with an hearbe, which all the day they chew in their mouthes.
CHAP. II. Of CVMANA. CVMANA is a Prouince named of a Riuer, called Cumana, Gom.c.76. where certaine Franciscans, Anno 1516, built them a Monasterie, and the Spaniards were very diligent in the fishing for Pearles. About P.M.Dec.7. lib.4. that time three Dominicans went fourescore myles West from thence to preach the Gospell, and were eaten of the Indians, which hindered not, but others of the same Order founded them a Monasterie in Ciribici, neere Maracapana. Both these Orders tooke paines with the Indians to conuert them, and taught their children to write and reade, and to answere at Masse, and the Spaniards were so respected, that they might safely walke alone through all the Countrey: but after two yeres and a halfe, the Indians, whether for their too much imployment in the Pearle-fishing, or for other cause, rebelled, and killed a hundred Spaniards, slew the Friers, one of which was then saying Masse, and as many Indi∣ans as they found with them; which the Spaniards of Domingo soone after re∣uenged. The losse Gom.c.78. of Cumana hindered their Trade for Pearles at Cubagua, and there∣fore the King sent Iames Castilion to subdue them by force: which he did, and began the Plantation of New Caliz, for the Spaniards to inhabite there. Cubagua was called by Columbus, the Finder, the Island of Pearles, situate in twelue degrees and a halfe of Northerly latitude, and containes twelue myles in circuit. This little Island is exceeding great in commoditie, that accreweth by those pearles, which hath a∣mounted to diuerse millions of Gold. They fetch their Wood from Margarita, an Island foure myles to the North; and their Water from Cumana, which is two and twentie myles thence: they haue a Spring of medicinall Water there in the Island. The Sea there, at certaine times of the yeare, is very redde, which those Pearle-oysters by some naturall purgation are said to cause. There are Fishes, or Sea-monsters, which from the middle vpwards resemble men, with Beards, Haire, and Armes. The Cap.79. peo∣ple of Cumana goe naked, couering onely their shame. At Feasts and Daunces they paint themselues, or else annoint themselues with a certaine Gumme, in which they sticke feathers of many colours. They cut their haire aboue the eares, and will not suffer it to grow on any places of their bodies, esteeming a bearded man a Beast: They take great paines to make their teeth blacke, and account them women, which haue them white. They blacke them with the poulder of the leaues of a certaine Tree called Gay; these leaues they chew, after they are fifteene yeares olde; they mixe that poulder with another of a kinde of Wood, and with Chalke of white shells burned, in manner as the Easterne Indians vse their Betele and Arecca, with Chalke of Oy∣sters: and this mixture they beare continually in their mouthes, still chewing it, that their teeth are as blacke as coales, and so continue to their death. They keepe it in Baskets and Boxes, and sell it in the Markets to some, which come farre for it, for Gold, Slaues, Cotton, and other Merchandise. This keepeth them from paine, and rotting of the teeth. The maids goe naked, onely they binde certaine bands hard a∣bout their knees, to make their hippes and thighes seeme thicke, which they esteeme no small beautie. The married women liue honestly, or else their husbands will di∣uorce them. The chiefe men haue as many wiues as they will; and, if any stran∣ger come to lodge in one of their houses, they make the fairest his bed-fellow, These also shut vp their daughters two yeares before they marrie them, all which time they goe not forth, nor cut their haire: After which, there is made a great Feast, and very many bidden, which bring their varietie of cheare, and also Wood to make the new Spouse a house: A man cuts off the Bridegroomes haire be∣fore, and a woman the Brides, and then eate and drinke, with much excesse, till night.
This is the lawfull wife, and the other which they marrie afterwards, obey this. They giue their Spouses to be defloured to their Piaces, (so they call their Priests) which these reuerend Fathers account their Preheminence and Prerogatiue; the husbands, their honor; the wiues, their warrant. The men and women weare Collars, Bracelets, Pendants, and some Crownes of Gold and Pearles: the men weare Rings in their noses, and the women Brooches on their breasts, whereby at first sight the sexe is discerned. The women Shoot, Runne, Leape, Swimme, as well as the men: their paines of trauell are small: they tyll the Land, and looke to the house, whiles the men Hunt and Fish. They are high-minded, treacherous, and thirstie of reuenge: Their chiefe weapons are poysoned Arrowes, which they prepare with the bloud of Snakes, and other mixtures. All of both sexes, from their infancie, learne to Shoot. Their meat is whatsoeuer hath life, as Horse∣leaches, Battes, Grashoppers, Spiders, Bees, Lice, Wormes, raw, sodden, fried: and yet their Countrey is replenished with good Fruits, Fish, and Flesh. This Diet (or, as some say, their Water) causeth spots in their eyes, which dimme their sight. They haue as strange a Fence or Hedge for their Gardens and Possessions, namely, a thred of Cotton, or Bexuco, as they call it, as high as a mans Girdle; and it is accounted a great sinne to goe ouer or vnder the same, and he which breakes it (they certainly be∣leeue) shall presently die. So much safer is their thread wouen with this imagination, then all our Stone-walls. The P.M. Dec.8.lib.7. Cumanois are much addicted to Hunting, wherein they are very expert, and kill Lyons, Tygres, Hogges, and all other foure-footed Beasts, with Bowes, Nettes, Snares. They take one Beast, which they call Capa, that hath the soles of his feet like a French shooe, narrow behind, broad and round before. Another, called Aranata, which for the Physnomie and subtletie seemes to be a kinde of Ape: it hath mouth, hands, and feet, like a man; a goodly countenance, bearded like a Goat. They goe in Heards, they bellow loud, runne vp Trees like Cats, auoid the Huntsmans Arrow, and cast it with cleanly deliuerie againe at himselfe. Another Beast hath a long snout, and feedeth on Ants Ouied calleth it a Beare. , putting his tongue into a hollow Tree, or other place, where the Ants are, and as many of them as come thereon, he lickes in. The Friers brought vp one, till the stinke thereof caused them to kill it, snouted like a Foxe, rough-haired, which voided in the excrements long and slender Serpents, which presently died. This Beast stinking while he liued, and worse now dead, yet was good foode to the Indians. They haue one which will counterfeit the voice of a crying child, and so cause some to come forth, and then deuoure them. The like is written of the Hyena, That she will call the Shepheards by their names, and then destroy them when they come forth. They haue Parrots as bigge as Rauens, with bells like Haukes, liuing on the prey, and smelling like Muske: Great Battes, one of which was a Physician, by strange ac∣cident, to a seruant of the Friers: which being sicke of a Pleurisie, was giuen ouer for dead, because they could not raise a veine wherein to let him bloud; in the night a Batte (after the custome of that creature) bit and sucked him, whereby so much bloud issued, that the sicke man recouered; which the Friers counted for a miracle. They haue three sorts of Bees, one whereof is little and blacke, and makes Honey in the Trees, without Waxe. Their Spiders are greater then ours, of diuerse colours, and weaue such strong Cobwebbes, that they aske good strength to breake them. There are Salamanders as bigge as a mans hand: they cackle much like a Pul∣let: their biting is deadly. I might here hold you too long in viewing these strange Creatures, we will now returne to their stranger customes. They take great pleasure in two things, Dauncing and Drinking, in which they will spend eight dayes together, especially at the Marriages, or Coronation of their Kings. Many gallants will then meete together, diuersly drest; some with Crownes & Feathers, some with shels about their legges instead of bels, to make a noise: some o∣therwise, all painted with 20. colours & figures: he that goes worst, seemes best: taking
one another by the hand, they dance in a ring, some backwards, some forwards, with a world of varietie; grinning, singing, crying, counterfeiting the deafe, lame, blind; fish∣ing, weauing, telling of stories; and this continueth six houres, and then they eate and drinke: before, he which danced most, now he which drinketh most, is the most com∣plete and accomplished gallant: and now beyond counterfeiting, drunkennesse sets them together in brauing, swaggering, quarrelling: others play the swine, spew vp the former to make way for other liquor: and they adde hereunto the fume of an herbe, which hath the like drunken effect; it seemeth to be Tabacco. This perhaps will not seeme strange to some, seeing these sauage customes of drin∣king, dancing, smoking, swaggering, so common with vs in these dayes: it might in∣deed seeme strange to our fore-fathers, if their more ciuill, more sacred ghosts, might returne and take view of their degenerating posteritie: but now he must be a stranger in many companies, that will not estrange himselfe from eiuilitie, from humanity, from Christianity, from GOD, to become of a man a beast; of an English-man, a Sauage Indian; of a Christian, afiend, saue that he hath a bodie, in the diuersified pollutions whereof, he hath aduantage, and takes it, to out-swagger the Diuell. These are the Gull-gallants of our dayes, to whom I could wish, that either their Progenitors had beene some Cumanian Indians, or that they would leaue this vsurped gallantrie to those true owners, and resume spirits truly English. The Gods of the Cumanians are the Sunne and Moone, which are taken for Man and Wife, and for the greatest Gods. They haue great feare of the Sunne when it thun∣ders or lightens saying that he is angry with them. They fast when there is any E∣clipse, especially the women: for the married women plucke their haires, and scratch their faces with their nailes: The maids thrust sharpe fish-bones into their armes, and draw bloud. When the Moone is at full, they thinke it is wounded by the Sunne, for some indignation he hath conceiued against her. When any Comet appeareth, they make a great noise with Drummes and hallowing, thinking so to scarre it away, or to consume it, beleeuing that those Comets portend some euills. Among their many Idols and figures, which they honor as Gods, they haue one like a Saint Andrewes Crosse, which they thought preserued them from night-spirits; and they hanged it on their new-borne children. They call their Priests Piaces, whose maiden-head-rite wee before mentioned. They are their Physitians and Magicians. They cure with roots and herbes, raw, sod and pounded, with the fat of birds, fishes, and beasts; with wood and other things vn∣knowne to the people, with abstruse and darke words which themselues vnderstand not. They sucke and licke the place where the paine is, to draw out the euill humors. And if the paine encreaseth, they say that the Patients are possessed with euill spirits: and then rubbe their bodies all-ouer with their hands, vsing certaine words of Coniu∣ration or Charmes, sucking after that very hard; giuing them to vnderstand, that by that meanes, they call out the euill spirits. Presently they take a peece of wood, the vertue whereof none else knoweth but the Piace, & therewith rubbe their mouths and throats, so long till they cast all that is in their bellies, vomiting sometimes bloud with the force thereof; the Piace in the meane time stamping, knocking, calling, and gestu∣ring: after two houres there comes from him a thicke flegme, and in the middest there∣of a blacke hard bullet, which those of the house carry and cast into the fields, saying, Let the Diuell goe thither. If the sicke-man recouer, his goods die and become the Priests; if he die, they say his time was come. The Piace is their Oracle, with whom they consult, whether they shall haue warre, what shall be the issue thereof, whether the yeare will be plentifull. They fore-warne them of Eclipses, and aduertise of Co∣mets. The Spaniards demanded in their necessitie, whether any shippes would come shortly, and they answered, that on such a day a Caruell would come with so many men, and such prouision and Merchandize, which accordingly came to passe. They call vpon the Diuell in this manner: the Piace entereth into a Caue, or secret place, in a darke night, and carries with him certaine couragious youthes, that may moue questions without feare. Hee sits on a bench, and they stand on their feet, hee
crieth, calleth, singeth verses, soundeth shells: and they with a heauy accent say many times Prororure, Prororure: if the Diuell comes not, all this Blacke-Sanctus is renued with grieuous sighes and much perplexitie. When he commeth (which is knowne by the noise) he sounds lowder, and suddenly falls downe, by visages and varied gesture, shewing that the Diuell is entered. The one of those his associates demandeth what him pleaseth: The Friers went one day with their coniuring and coniured holies, the Crosse, Stole, Holy-water: and when the Piace was in that distraction, cast a part of the Stole on him, crossing and coniuring in Latine, and he answered them in his natiue language much to the purpose: at last they demanded whither the soules of the Indi∣ans went, he answered to hell. These Piaces by their Physicke and Diuining grow rich: they goe to Feasts, and sit by themselues apart, and drinke themselues drunke, and say the more they drinke, the better they can diuine. They learne these Arts when they are children, and are en∣closed in the woods two yeares, all that time eating nothing that hath bloud, see no women, nor their owne parents, come not out of their Caues or Cells: and the Pia∣ces, their Masters, goe to them by night, to teach them. When this time of their soli∣tarie discipline is past, they obtaine a testimoniall thereof, and beginne to professe in practise of Physicke and Diuination. Let vs burie the Cumanois, and then we haue done. Being dead, they sing their praises, and bury them in their houses, or drie them at the fire and hang them vp. At the yeares end (if he were a great man) they renue the lamentation, and after many other ceremonies, burne the bones, and giue to his best beloued wife his skull to keepe for a relique: they beleeue that the soule is immortall, but that it eateth and drinketh about in the fields where it goeth, and that it is the Eccho which answereth when one calleth. CHAP. III. Of Paria, Guiana, and the neighbour Countries, both on the Coast, and within the Land. IN the yeare 1497. (some adde a yeare more) P. Martyr. Dec.1. lib. 6. Gom.part.2. cap.84. Christopher Columbus seeking new Discoueries, after the suffering of vnsufferable heats and calmes at sea, whereby the hoopes of his vessels brake, and the fresh∣water not able further to endure the hot indignation of that now-be∣leeued Burning-Zone, fled out of those close prisons, into the lap of that father of waters, the Ocean, for refuge, he came at last to Trini∣dado. The first Land he incountered, he called by that name; either for deuotion, now that his other hopes were dried vp with the heat, or washed into the sea by the violent showers aboue-boord, and the lesse (but not lesse dangerous) which flowed from his Caske within: or else, for the three mountaines which he there descried. Once, this discouery of land so rauished his spirit, by the inexpected deliuery from danger, as easily carried his impotent thoughts into a double error, the one in placing earthly Paradise in this Iland, (to which opinion, for the excellencie of the Tabacco there found, he should happily haue the smokie subscriptions of many humorists, to whom that fume becomes a fooles Paradise, which with their braines, and all, passeth away in smoke) the other was, that the Earth was not round like a ball, but like a peare, the vpper swelling whereof, he esteemed these parts. Hence Columbus failed to Paria, and found out the Peare-fishing, of which Petrus Alphonsus, a little after made great commodity by trade with the Sauages. He was assailed with eighteene Canoas of Canibals, P. Martyr. Dec.1.lib 8. Of the Cani∣bals, see Chap∣ter 13. one of which he tooke, with one Canibal, and a bound Captiue, who with teares shewed them that they had eaten six of his fellowes, and the next day hee must haue gone to pot too: to him they gaue power ouer his Iaylour, who with his
owne clubbe killed him, still laying on when his braines and guts came forth, and te∣stified, that he needed not further feare him. In Haraia of Paria, they found plentie of salt, which the Fore-man in Natures shop and her cheese work-man, the Sun, turned and kerned from water into salt: his work∣house for this businesse, was a large plaine by the waters-side. Heere the Sepulchres of their Kings and great men seemed not lesse remarkable: they layed the body on a kinde of hurdle or grediron of wood, vnder which they kindled a gentle fire, whereby keeping the skinne whole, they by little and little consumed the flesh. These dried carkasses they held in great reuerence, and honored for their household-Gods. In the yeare Gom.cap.85. 1499. Vincent Pinzon discouered Cape Saint Augustine, and failed along the coast from thence to Paria. But why stand we heere pedling on the coast for Pearles, Salt, and Tabacco? let vs rouse vp higher spirits, and follow our English guides for Guiana. In the yeare 1595. Sir Walter Raleigh. Guiana. Sir Walter Raleigh hauing before receiued intelligence of this rich and mightie Empire, set sorth for the Discouery, and on the two and twentieth of March anchored at Point Curiapan in Trinidado, and searched that Iland, which he found plentifull. He tooke the Citie of Saint Ioseph, and therein Antony Berreo the Spanish Gouernour: Leauing his shippes, he went with an hundred men in boats, and a little galley, and with some Indian Pilots passed along that admirable confluence of Riuers, (as by the Corps dugnard) vnto Orenoque, as great a commander of Riuers, as the Emperour of Guiana of souldiers. And although wee haue before mentioned somewhat thereof, yet this, his peculiar place, requireth some further consideration. This Riuer Orenoque or Baraquan (since, of this Discouery, called Raleana) runneth from Quito in Peru on the East, it hath nine branches which fall out on the North side of his owne maine mouth, on the South side seuen. Thus many armes hath this Giant∣like streame to be his purueyers, which are alway filling his neuer filled mouth (see∣ming by this their naturall officiousnesse incorporate thereunto, and to be but wider gapings of the same spacious iawes) with many Ilands and broken grounds, as it were so many morsells and crummes in his greedie chappes, still opening for more, though he cannot, euen in Winter, when his throat is glibbest, altogether swallow these; yea these force him, for feare of choaking, to yaune his widest, and to vomit out, betweene these cleauing morsels, into the Oceans lappe, so many streames, and (so far is it from the Northerne and Southerne extreames) three hundred miles distant. The Inhabitants on the Northerne branches are the Tiuitinas, a goodly and valiant people, which haue the most manly speech, and most deliberate (saith Sir Walter) that euer I heard, of what Nation soeuer. In the Summer they haue houses on the ground, as in other places: in the Winter they dwell vpon the trees, King Abi∣beiba dwelt on a tree, in the Countrey of Dariena. Pet. Martyr Dec. 3. lib.6. where they build very artifi∣ciall Townes and Villages: for betweene May and September the Riuer of Orenoque riseth thirtie foot vpright, and then are those Ilands ouer-flowen twentie foot high, ex∣cept in some few raised grounds in the middle. This waterie store, when the clouds are so prodigall of more then the Riuers store-house can hold, whereby they become vio∣lent intruders and incrochers vpon the land, and not the violence of cold, giueth this time the title of Winter. These Tiuitinas neuer eat of any thing that is set or sowne; Natures nurslings, that neither at home nor abroad, will be beholden to the art or la∣bour of Husbandrie. They vse the tops of Palmitos for bread, and kill Deere, Fish, and Porke, for the rest of their sustenance. They which dwell vpon the branches of Orenoque, called Capuri and Macureo, are for the most part Carpenters of Canoas, which they fell into Guiana for gold, and into Trinidado for Tabacco, in the excessiue taking whereof, they exceed all Nations. When a Commander dieth, they vse great lamentation, and when they thinke the flesh of their bodies is putrified and fallen from the bones, they take vp the carkasse againe, and hang it vp in the house, where he had dwelt, decking his skull with feathers of all colours, and hanging his gold-plates a∣bout the bones of his armes, thighes and legges. The Arcas which dwell on the South of Orenoque, beat the bones of their Lords into powder, which their wiues and friends drinke.
As they passed along these streames, their eyes were entertained with a Pageant of Shewes, wherein Nature was the onely Actor; heere the Deere came downe feeding by the waters side, as if they had desired acquaintance with these new-come guests: there, the birds in vnspeakable varietie of kindes and colours, rendering their seruice to the eye and eare: the lands either in large plaines, of many miles, baring their beau∣tifull bosomes, adorned with Floras embroidery of vnknowne flowers and plants, and prostrating themselues to the eye, that they might be seene; or else lifting vp them∣selues in hills, knitting their furrowed browes, and strouting out their goggle eyes to watch their treasure, which they keepe imprisoned in their stony walls, and now, to see these strangers: the waters (as the Graces) dancing with mutuall and manifold em∣bracings of diuers streames, attended with plentie of fowle and fish; both land and water feasting varietie of senses with varietie of obiects: only the Crocodile (a crea∣ture which seemeth vassall, now to the land, now to the water, but to make prey on both) well-nigh marred the play, and turned this Comedy into a Tragedie, euen in their sight, feasting himselfe with a Negro of their company. One leuell passed hence to Cumana, an hundred and twentie leagues to the North, wherein dwell the Saya, the Assawa, the Wikiri, and the Aroras, a people as blacke as Negros, but with smooth haire. Their poisoned arrowes, like cruell executioners, doe not only kill, but with vncouth torments make death to be, as the last, so the least of their furie; especially if men drinke after they are wounded. At the Port of Morequito they anchored, and the King being an hundred and ten yeares old, came a foot fourteene miles to see them, and returned the same day. They brought them store of fruits, and a sort of Paraquitos, no bigger then Wrennes, and an Ouied. in Sum∣mar. calls it Bardato. Armadilla, which seemeth to be all barred ouer with small plates, somewhat like to a Rhinoceros, with a white horne growing in his hinder-parts, as bigge as a great hunting horne, which they vse to winde in stead of a Trumpet. They after eate this beast. Monardus Monard.c.37. saith, it is in bignesse and snout like a Pigge, liues vnder the earth as a Moule, and is thought to liue on earth. They passed further, till they came in sight of those strange ouer-falls of Caroli, of which there appeared ten or twelue in sight, euery one as high ouer the other as a Church-Tower. They had sight at Winicapora of a mountaine of Crystall, which ap∣peared a farre off like a white Church-Tower, of an exceeding height. There falleth ouer it a mightie Riuer, which toucheth no part of the side of the mountaine, but rush∣ing ouer the top, falleth to the ground with so terrible noise, as if a thousand great bells were knocked one against another. No maruell of these roaring out-cries, if we consider that double penaltie of sense and losse, which this Riuer seemeth to sustaine, the one in that dreadfull downefall, bruising and breaking his vnited streames into drops, and making it foming and senselesse with this falling-sicknesse; the other in lea∣uing behind his Crystall purchase, further enriched with Diamonds and other iewels, which euen now he embraced in his watery armes, but himselfe (such is the course and curse of couetousnesse) will not suffer himselfe to enioy. Now for the Monsters of men: there are said to be (not seen by our men, but reported by the Sauages and other) an Amazonian nation further South: which Gomara thinkes to be but the wiues of some Indians (a thing common, as you haue euen now read) shooting and following the warres, no lesse then their husbands: once, about Iucatan, about Plata, about the Riuer, called of this supposition, Amazones: about Monomo∣tapa in Africa; our age hath told, but no man hath seene this Vnimammian Nation. Yet heere they speake not of searing of the breast: and what need they, if there bee such, seeing the women are so good Archers in other places, their breasts notwith∣standing? Againe, L.Keymi. they tell of men with mouthes in their breasts, and eyes in their shoulders, called Chiparemai, and of the Guianians, Ewiaponoms, very strong; and of others headed like dogges, which liue all the day time in the sea. These things are strange, yet I dare not esteeme them fabulous: onely (as not to prodigall of faith) I suspend, till some eye-intelligence of some of our parts haue testified the truth. It were a hard taske to muster all that world of Riuers, and names of Nations in
the parts neere Guiana, which they that will, may finde in Sir Walter and Master Key∣mis their owne relations. As for Guiana, this Sir Walter hath written. It is directly East from Peru towards the Sea, and lieth vnder the Equinoctiall: it hath more abun∣dance of gold then any part of Peru, and as many or mo great Cities. It hath the same Lawes, Gouernment, and Religion; as Manoa, the Imperiall Citie of Guiana, which some Spaniards haue seene, and they call it The gilded Cit. El Dorado, for the greatnes, riches, and situation, farre exceedeth any of the world, at least so much of it as the Spaniards know. It is founded vpon a Lake of salt water, two hundred leagues long, like vnto the Caspian sea. The Emperour of Guiana is descended from the Ingas, the magnifi∣cent Princes of Peru: for when Francis Piçarro had conquered Peru, and slaine A∣tabalipa the King; one of his yonger brethren fled from thence, and tooke with him many thousands of those souldiers of the Empire, called Orenes, with whom and o∣ther his followers, he vanquished all that tract which is betweene the great Riuers of Orenoque, and Amazones. Diego Ordas who was one of the Captaines of Cortes, in the conquest of Mexico, in the yeare 1531. made search for Guiana, but lost himselfe, being slaine in a mutiny. Be∣fore this, his prouision of power was fired, and one Iuan Martinez, which had the charge thereof, was therefore condemned to be executed. But at the souldiers request his punishment was altered, and he set in a Canoa alone without victuall, and so tur∣ned loose into the Riuer. Certaine Guianians met him, and hauing neuer seene man of that colour, they carried him into the Land to be wondered at; and so from Towne to Towne, till he came to the great Citie of Manoa, the seat and residence of Inga the Emperour. He no sooner saw him, but he knew him to be a Christian (for the Spa∣niards not long before had conquered his brother) and caused him to be well enter∣tained in his Palace. He liued seuen monthes in Manoa, but was not suffered to wan∣der any whither into the Countrey: he was also brought thither all the way blind∣fold, led by the Indians, vntill he came at Manoa. He entered the Citie at noone, and trauelled all that day till night, and the next, from the rising till the setting of the Sun; thorow the Citie, ere he came to the Palace of Inga. After seuen months, the Empe∣rour put him to his choise, whether to stay or goe, and he with the Emperours licence departed. He sent with him many Guianians, all laden with as much gold as they could carry; but before he entered Orenoque, the Orenoqueponi robbed him of all, but of two bottells of gold-beads, which they had thought had beene his drinke or meate. Thus escaped he to Trinidado, and died after at Saint Iuan de Puerto-rico, where, in his extremes he vttered these things to his Confessor. Hee called the Citie Manoa El Dorado the gilded or golden, because that at their drunken solemnities (in which vice no Nation vnder heauen excells them) when the Emperour carowseth with any of his Commanders, they that pledge him, are stripped naked, and their bodies annointed with a kinde of white Balsamum, and then certaine seruants of the Emperour, hauing prepared gold made into fine powder, blow it thorow hollow canes vpon their na∣ked bodies, vntill they be all shining from the foot to the head; and in this sort they sit drinking by twenties and hundreds, and continue in drunkennesse sometimes six or seuen dayes together. Vpon this sight, and for the abundance of gold he saw in the Citie, the Images in the Temples, the Plates, armours, and shields of gold vsed in their warres, he gaue the Citie that name. Iuan Iuan de Castel∣lanos ap. Hak. de Castellanos reckoneth twentie seuerall Expeditions of some or other Spa∣niards, for this Guianian Discouery with little effect, saue that diuers lost their liues therein. How it now standeth, I know nor. Ganzalo Piçarro Lopez Vaz ap. Hak tom 3. sent a Captaine na∣med Orellana, from the borders of Peru, who with fiftie men were carried by the vio∣lent current of the Riuer, that they could not returne to Piçarro, he descended not in Orenoque the Guianian Riuer, but in Maragnon, called of him Orellana: which Io∣sephus Acosta lib.2. cap.6.& 3.c.. Acosta writeth, from the relation of one of their societie; who, being a boy, had beene in the Expedition of Pedro de Orsua for this discouery, and had sailed the Riuer thorow, that in the middest men can see nothing but the skie (as before is said) and the Riuer, and that it is seuentie leagues broad vnder the Equinoctiall. Martine
M.Fernand. de Eciz 1. ap.Hak. Fernandez maketh it seuen degrees and a halfe to the North of the Line, and fifteene leagues broad, and the Sea of fresh water to be another Riuer of forty leagues breadth: others haue written otherwise, which varying proceedeth from that varietie of armes or mouthes of Orenoque or Raleana, and Marannon or Amazones, which since haue beene better discouered, as L. Keymis. T. Masham. Master Keymis, Master Masham and others employed in this action, haue found by experience. It Lop. Gom. cap.86. riseth in Quito. Orellana sailed in it six thou∣sand miles. In all these parts their greatest trelasure is multitude of women and children. Topiawari made a heauy complaint, that wheras they were wont to haue ten or twelue wiues, now they had not aboue three or foure, by reason of the warres with the Epu∣remei their enemies: whereas the Lords of the Epuremes had fifty or an hundred, and their warre is more for women, then either for gold or dominion. Berro in the search for Guiana, tooke his iourney from Nueno reyno de Gránado, wherehe dwelt, with seuen hundred Horse, but trauelling he lost many of his compa∣ny and Horse: at Amapaia the soile is a low marish, and the water issuing thorow the Bogges, is red and venemous, which poysoned the horses, and infected the men: at noone the Sunne had made it more holesome for their vse. This Lop. Vaz. New Kingdome of Granada is two hundred leagues within land, South∣ward from Cartagena. It had that name, because the Captaine that discouered it, was of Granada in Spaine. The plenty of Emeralds in these parts, hath made that Gemme of lesse worth. The next Prouince to this is called Popayan: in both which the Spa∣niards haue many Townes. And by the Riuer of Orenoque, both may be inuaded. From these Countries issueth another great Riuer, P. Martyr. Dec.7.lib.10.& Dec.3.lib.4. called of the Inhabitants Da∣baiba (the Spaniards haue named it Rio Grande, and the Riuer of Saint Iohn) it passeth with a Northerne discouery, into the Gulfe of Vraba before mentioned. They which dwell on this Riuer obserue an Idoll of great note, called by the name of the Riuer, Dabaiba: whereto the King at certaine times of the yeare sends slaues to be sacrificed, from remote Countries, from whence also is great resort of Pilgrimes. They kill the flaues before their God, and after burne them, supposing that odor acceptable to their Idoll, as Taper-lights, and Frankinsence (saith Martyr) is to our Saints. Through the displeasure of that angry God, they said that all the Riuers and fountaines had once failed, and the greatest part of men perished with famine. Their Kings in remembrance hereof, haue their Priests at home, and Chappels which are swept euery day, and kept with a religious neatnes. When the King thinketh to obtaine of the Idoll, sun-shine, or raine, or the like; he with his Priests gets vp into a Pulpit, standing in the Chappell, pur∣posing not to depart thence till his suit bee granted. They vrge their God therefore with vehement prayers, and cruell fasting: the people meane while macerating them∣selues also with fasting, in foure dayes space not eating nor drinking, except on the fourth day, only a little broth. The Spaniards asking what God they worshipped thus, they answered, the Creator of the Heauens, Sunne, Moone, and all inuisible things, from whom all good things proceed. And they say Dabaiba They say Dabaiba was a womā of great wisedome, ho∣nored in her life, deified af∣ter death; to whom they ascribe thun∣der and light∣ning, when she is angrie. was the mother of that Creator. They call them to their Deuotions with certaine Trumpets and Bells of gold. The Bells had clappers like in forme to ours, made of the bones of fishes, and yeelding a pleasing sound, as they reported: which no doubt, was a pleasing sound and musike to the Spaniards couetous hearts, howsoeuer it agreeth with the nature of that mettall to ring in the eares. One of them, they say, weighed six hundred Pensum ex∣ceedeth the Ducat a fourth part. Pensa. Their Priests were enioyned chastity, which vow, if they violated, they were either stoned or burned. O∣ther men also in the time of that fast, likewise contained themselues from those carnall pleasures. They haue an imagination on the soule (but know not what substance or name to ascribe vnto it) to which yet they beleeued, was assigned future ioyes or woes, according to their demerits, pointing vp to Heauen, and downe to the Center, when they spake thereof. Many of their wiues (for they might haue many) followed the Se∣pulchres of their husbands. They allow not mariage with the sister, of which they haue a ridiculous conceit of the spot, which they account a man, in the Moone, that for this Incest he was thither confined, to the torments of cold and moisture, in that Moone∣prison. They leaue trenches on their Sepulchers, in which they yearely powre Mayes,
and some of their wine (to the profit) as they thinke of the ghosts. If a mother die while she giueth sucke, the poore nursling must not be Orphan, but be interred with her, be∣ing put there to her breast, & buried aliue. They imagined that the soules of their great men and their familiars were immortall, but not others: and therefore such of their ser∣uants & friends as would not be buried with them, they thought should lose that pri∣uiledge of immortality, & the delights of those pleasant places, where was eating, drin∣king, dancing, & the former delicats of their former liues. They renue the funeral pomp of these great men yearly, assembling thither with plenty of wine and meats, and there watch all night (especially the women) singing drery lamentations, with inuectiues a∣gainst his enemies, if he died in the wars, yea cutting the image of his enemy in peece in reuenge of their slaine Lord. This done, they fall to drinking of Mays-wine till they be weary, if not drunken. Yet after this, they resume their songs to his commendation, with many dances and adorations. When day appeareth, they put the image of the de∣ceased into a great Canoa (a boat of one tree, capable, of threescore oares) filled with drinkes, herbes, & such things as in his life he had loued: which some carry vpon their shoulders in procession about the Court, & set it downe there againe, & burne it with all the contents. After which, the women, filled with wine, and emptied of all modesty, with loose haire, secrets not secret, and variety of Bacchanall gestures, sometimes goe, sometimes fall, sometimes shake the weapons of the men, and conclude with beastly sleeping on the ground. The yong men exercise their dances and songs, piercing the middle of their priuy mēber with the sharp bone of the Ray-fish, bedewing the paue∣ment with the bloud. And their Bauti, who are their Physitians, and Priests, heale the same againe in foure daies. The haue in those parts Magicians, without whose aduice they attempt nothing: and neither hunt, fish, nor gather gold, except the Tequenign or Wizard thinke it fit. To end this Dabaiban Story, Martyr saith (for I wil not further engage my credit for the truth) that in Camara, which is at the head of this Riuer, there happened most ter∣rible tempests from the East, which threw downe trees and houses, and in the last acte of that tragedy, were brought (not by representation) two foule monsters of monstrous fowles, such as the Poets describe the Harpies with womēs faces; one of them so great, that her legs were thicker then a mans thigh, so heauy, that the boughes of the trees could not beare her, so strong, that she would seize on a man, and fly away with him, as a Kite with a chicken: the other was lesse, & supposed to be the yong one of the other. Corales, Osorius, & Spinosa, told Martyr that they spake with many who saw the grea∣ter killed, which was done by a stratageme; for they made the image of a man, & set it on the ground, attending in the woods with their arrowes, till she the next morning seized on this prey, and lost her selfe; the yong was neuer seene after; and happily you think, not before neither. But they added, that the killers of her were honored as Gods, and rewarded with presents. All Botr part. lib.6. these parts, form golden Castile, and the Gulfe of Vraba to Paria, yeeld Ca∣ribes or Canibals, which eat mans flesh, and geld children, to make them more fat and tender for their diet. And all the Inland parts neere Peru, and in the hills called Andes, which some call Golden Castile, they little differ. Cieça Cieça part.1.cap.15. saith, That in the Valley of Anzerma, they keepe certaine tablets amongst the reedes, wherein they carue the image of the Diuell, in a terrible shape, also the figures of Cats and other Idols which they worship. To them they pray for raine or faire weather: they haue commerce with the Diuell, and obserue such superstitions as he enioyneth them. They are great man∣eaters. At the doores of their houses they haue small Courts, wherein are their graues in deepe vaults, opening to the East: in which they bury their great men with all their wealth. The Curies are not far frō them; they haue no Temple, nor Idol. They haue con∣ference with the Diuel. They marry with their neeces & sisters, & are man-eaters. They call the Diuel Xixarama. They esteem Virginity little worth. In the Prouince of Cap.19.& d. Arma the Diuel doth often appeare to the Indians: in honor of whom they sacrifice their cap∣tiues, taken in war, hanging them vp by the shoulders & pulling out the hearts of some of them. In Paucora they haue like diuellish deuotions, & their Priests are their Oracles.
Before the house of the chiefe Lord was an Idoll, as bigge as a man, with his face to the East, and his armes open. They sacrificed two Indians euery Tuesday in the Pro∣uince of the Diuell. In the Prouince of Pozo, in the houses of their Lords, they had many Idols in such resemblance as the Diuell had assumed in his apparitions. And in those Idols he would also speake and giue answeres. In Carrapa Chap.23. they are extreame drunkards: when any is sicke, they offer sacrifices to the Diuell for his recouery. In Quinbaya is a hill which casteth forth smoke: but a more hellish smoke is their confe∣rence and commerce with the Diuel, like the former. In the Prouince of Cali they like∣wise conferre with the Diuell: they haue no Temples or houses of Religion. They make deepe pits for Sepulchres of their great men, where their armor, wealth, and food is set about them. Their lust subiecteth the neece and sister to their mariages. In Popayan Chap.32. they are man-eaters, as also in the forenamed Prouinces. They obserue the same Ca∣ninall and Diuellish Rites with the former, framing their superstitions to the Diuels di∣rection in their mutuall colloquies. They bury with their Lords some of his wiues and prouision. Some of them are great Wizards & Sorcerers. In Pasto they talke also with the Diuell, a thing common to all these parts of the Indies. But let vs leaue these steepe and cold hills, these men of the Diuell whom they worship, and diuels to men whom they deuoure, and see if in the lower Countries we can finde higer and nobler spirits. CHAP. IIII. Of Brasil. AS Guiana is bounded with those mightie Riuers of Orenoque and Marannon, so Brasil extendeth it selfe North and South, betweene Marannon & the riuer of Plata or Siluer, which three we haue already shewed to be the greatest Riuers in the World. The Westerne Borders are not so well discouered. The Easterne are washed by the Sea. Maf∣faus P. Maffaeus hist. Ind. lib.2.P. Bert.Geograp. Mag. Geog. G. Ens hist. Ind. accident. P. carric.lib.3.cap.22 & d. Bot.part.1.lib.6. hath largely described the same, whose words Bertius, Magi∣nus, and Gasper Ens haue transcribed: the summe whereof Iarric and Boterus haue in∣serted into their French and Italian Relations. Petrus Alnarus Capralis, being sent by Emanuel, King of Portugal, in the yeare 1500. vnto the East Indies, to auoid the calmes on the Guinnee shore, fetched a fur∣ther compasse West, and so discouered the Continent, which now of that red wood there plentifully growing, is called Brasil, but by him was named the Land of the Ho∣ly Crosse, because he had there erected a Crosse with much ceremony. This Brasil was soone after by Americus Vesputius, at the charges of the said King, further disco∣uered. The Region is pleasant and holesome, the hills and valleyes equally agreeing in their vnequalnesse, the soile fat and fertile: there are plentie of Sugar-canes; a kind of Balme expressed out of the herbe Copaibas, and many fruits which the Countrey naturally produceth; besides those which our Europe hath communicated. Many sorts there are of beasts, as a kinde of Swine Which feeds on grasse, sleeps in the water. Boterus. which liue in both Elements, their fore∣feet, being short in proportion to the hinder, make them slow in running, and there∣fore being hunted, commit themselues quickly to the water. Anta, resembling a Mule, but somewhat lesse; slender snouted, the nether chappe very long, like a Trum∣pet, with round eares and short tailes, hiding themselues in the day-time, The Spani∣ards call it (of the contrary) the ligh dog. The Portugals Sloth. The In∣dians, Hay. Some haue written that it liues of aire; and seldome or neuer hath it beene seene eating. and fee∣ding in the night, the flesh tasteth like Beefe: there is also the Armadillo; the Tygre, which being hungry, is very hurtfull; being full, will flee from a dogge: there is a de∣formed beast of such slow pace, that in fifteene dayes it will scarse goe a stones cast. It liueth on the leaues of trees, on which it is two dayes in climing, and as many in de∣scending, neither shouts nor blowes forcing her to amend her pace. The Tamendoas are as big as a Ram, with long & sharp snouts, a taile like a Squirrell, where-vnder they hide themselues, wil put out their tongue two foot, to gather plenty of Ants into their
mouthes, hauing scraped vp the places where they keepe with their pawes. The Portu∣gals haue there raised plenty of horses and sheepe. The men worship no God at all, but are giuen to sooth-sayings. The men and women goe altogether naked, are flat-nosed, make themselues blacke with the fruit Genipapi, weare their haire hanging from the hinder part of the head, not suffering it elsewhere to grow: in their nether lips weare long stones for a gallantrie (which being remoued, they seeme in deformed manner to haue a double mouth) they goe together by companies with great silence, the wife going before her husband. They entertaine and welcome strangers at first with wee∣ping and deepe sighes, pitying their tedious iourney, and presently dry their eyes, ha∣uing teares at command. Women in trauell are deliuered without great difficultie, and presently goe about their houshold businesse, the husband in her stead keepeth his bed, is visited of the neighbours, hath his broths made him, and iunkets sent to com∣fort him. They are ignorant of They know no numbers further then fiue, the rest they supply as they can with their toes and fingers: and if the things numbred ex∣ceed, they number by the toes and fin∣gers of many persons assem∣bled together. Stad. lib.2.c.29. numbering and letters: some Tradition they are said to haue touching Nae and the Floud. Vnder the same roofe (which is like a boat with the keele vpwards) liue many families, they lie in nets or beddes hanging aboue the ground (which is vsuall in a great part of the Indies) to auoid hurtfull creatures: they minde the day, and are not carefull for the morrow, easily communicate what they haue, are very patient of labour and hunger, feasting if they haue wherewith, from morning till night, and fasting other-whiles, when they want, three dayes together. In swimming they are miraculously skilfull, and will diue whole houres to search any thing vnder the water. They beleeue not any reward or punishment after this life en∣ded, but thinke that as men die, so they goe to the other world, maimed, wounded, sicke or whole: and therefore, bury the bodies with a net to lie in, and food for some dayes, thinking that they both sleepe and eat. They are excellent archers, and what enemies they take in their wars, they feed well many dayes, and then kill and eat them for great dainties. They dwell in houses scattered and separated from each other; their language is almost generally the same; they haue no lawes nor Magistrates; the wo∣men call certaine things by one name, and the men by another. They haue no vse of three letters It seemes otherwise by Lerius his dia∣logue of that language.c.20. in the Alphabet, L, F, R, a reason whereof some haue wittily giuen, because they haue no Law, Faith, nor Ruler. They are vnmindfull of good tarnes, and too mindfull of iniuries: impotent of lust and rage, and in summe, more like beastes then men. Thus farre Maffaeus. Let vs in the next place heare such as haue liued in the Countrey: of which Lerius and Theuet, two French-men, and Ioannes Stadius a German, haue written seuerall Treatises. Ioannes Stadius Io.Stad. Hes∣si cum picturis. a. T.de Bry in 3. parte Ameri∣cae. in the yeare 1554. was prisoner to the Tuppin Imbas, and because he serued the Portugals, should haue beene slaine and deuoured. But by GODS mer∣cie he escaped. He was the Gunner in the Fort of Saint Vincent, and going into the wood to prouide somewhat wherewith to entertaine some friends then come to him, became himselfe a prey to those men-hunters. When they had taken him, they con∣tended which of them had beene the first taker, and that controuersie ended, he was stripped naked and led away. He was giuen to one of their Kings, and this victorie by them was ascribed to their Tamaraka, or Idols, which they said had by Oracle pro∣phecied thereof. But their Kings were no other then the chiefe in euery cottage, which consisted of one kindred, and these Tamaraka were certaine rattles, as shall after ap∣peare. The manner is, that it gets them a great name, to exhibit this feast of a slaine captiue, and therefore some that haue taken, will credit some other friend with the gift of a captiue to this solemne butchery, on condition to repay him the next captiue he taketh. This was Stadius his case, who was thus tossed by exchange from one to an∣other, till at last he escaped altogether. But when he had been newly taken, the women came about him, and one while buffeted him, one saying, this is for such a friend of mine, that the Peros or Portugals had slaine; another fixing on his flesh the memori∣all of another friend of hers, and then lead him with a rope about his necke, almost strangling him, making him also to dance in the middest of them, with rattles tied to his legs: but he after grew in some credit & respect amongst them, & saw diuers others
eaten, while himselfe could not be free from feare of the like destiny. The Sauages, that they take, put on a great shew of resolution, and little regard (in seeming) that their tragedie, supported with this comfort, that their friends will reuenge it. In time of sick∣nesse or sudden dangers, they would resort to him to pray to his GOD for deliuerance; and this conceit of his GOD, which they obserued in his Deuotions, was the principall meanes of deferring his execution. Such as are mortally wounded in their fights, they would spend presently, or at least kill and dresse them, for a feast neere at hand: and one man that had liued long amongst them, and was desperately sicke, left Death should deptiue them of their cheere, they slue, and (because of his sicknesse) hurling away the head and inwards, eat vp the rest. They take great pride in this their cruelty, and when Knyan Bebe their King, hauing a basket full of peeces of mans flesh, on which he was feeding, offered Stadius a peece, who told him that it was more then beastly, he an∣swered, I am a Tigre, and I delight in these delicacies. This Stadius after escaped in a French shippe. Nicolas Durantius, Lerius hist. Nug.in Amer. a Knight of Malta, sir-named Villagagnon, in the yeare 1555. (malcontent with his estate at home) sailed into Francia Antarctica, or the Southerne parts of Brasil, vnder the Tropike of Capricorne, and pretended there to worship GOD according to the purity of the Gospell, and to fortifie, both for the habitation of his owne, and for a Sanctuary vnto such as at home were persecuted for the truth. He for∣tified & sent thence to Geneua for assistāce in this his holy intent: wherupon Richerius and Charterius, two Ministers, with diuers others, among whom was Iohn Lerius, were sent, and landed there in the yeare 1577. Lerius hath written his obseruations of these parts, as Theuct also, another of Villagagnons company, but (as Lerius testifieth) in many things falsely. The first Sauages that Lerius and his fellowes saw, were the Margaiates, which hold friendship with the Portugals, and are enemies to the French, and to the Touou Pinambaulsy, or Tuppin Imbas, confederates of the French, and as deadly enemies to the former. In the meane way they passed by the Tapemry, Parai∣ba, Ouctacates, all which, howsoeuer they exercise hostilities, and mutuall disagree∣ments, yet agree in like barbarous and rightlesse Rites. With the Touou-Pinambaulsy he conuersed familiarly about a yeare. They are in habit of bodie like the Europeans, but stronger, and lesse subiect to sicknesse, not subiect to our bodily distempers, by like intemperance, or vexation of minde, by turbulent and distracting passions of co∣uetousnesse, enuy, ambition. They are all naked, except sometimes the old men, ra∣ther to hide their disease in those parts, then their shame, couer their priuities. They weare in their nether lippe a Great at one end, and little at the o∣ther: in their infancie it is a bone: and af∣ter a greene stone, in some as long as ones finger: they will thrust out their tongue at the hole, when the stone is remoued. Pyramidall stone, which brauery weigheth downe their lippe, and subiecteth the face to great deformitie. Some also not content with this, adde two others in their cheekes to like purpose. They presse downe the noses of their Infants to make them flat. They annoynt themselues with a kinde of gumme, which they couer with the downe of feathers sticking thereto. They weare also front∣lets of feathers: in their eares they weare bones. They which will excell the rest in gallantry, and would seeme to haue slaine and eaten the most enemies, slash and cut their flesh, and put therein a blacke powder, which neuer will be done away. They vse rattles of the shell of a certaine fruit, in which they put stones or graines, and call them Maraca, of which they haue some superstitious conceit. The women differ from the men in nourishing their haire, which the men shaue off before, & make not those holes in their lips; but in their eares weare earings of the forme and bignes of a meane can∣dle. They paint also their faces with diuers colours, and weare bracelets of little bones, of which the men weare chaines or collars. They would not weare cloaths, pretending their custome of nakednes, and often washing (sometimes ten times in a day) whereto cloaths would be a hinderance: and our captiue women further then the whip forced them, would not accustome themselues to the apparell we gaue them. The women make two kindes of meale of certaine roots, which they vse in stead of bread, which they doe not put, but hurle, into their mouthes without losse. Their office is also to make their drinke of rootes sliced, and chewed in their mouthes, and thus prepared, boiled, and stirred in a great pot ouer the fire: the like drinke they make of chewed
Mayes, which they call Anati: the men would account it a disgrace to do these things, and that they would not taste so well. They call this drinke Caouin, it is thicke, and tastes like milke: I haue seene them continue (saith Lerius) drinking this liquor three dayes and nights together: they hold it a disparagement not to be able to hold out at this Bacchanal exercise, which they celebrate with dancing and singing, especially at their beastly man-feasts. The women dance apart from the men. One of them reported to our Author, that they had taken a ship of the Peros, or Portugals, and eaten the men: they found therein great vessels, which they could not tell what it was, but dranke so much therof, that they slept three daies after: it is likely that it was Spanish wine. They eat Serpents and Toads (which with them are not venemous) and Lizards: Our Author saw one Lizard as big as a man, with scales on her backe like Oisters. They haue a kind of Monkey called Sagouin, of the bignes of a Squirrell, the fore-halfe in shape resem∣bling a Lion: they haue another strange beast, called Coaty, as high as a Hare, with a little head, sharp eares, and a snout or beake aboue a foot long, the mouth so little, that one can scarsely put in his little finger; it feedeth on Ants. They take The Brasilian Petum, is nei∣ther in forme nor vertue, the same with Ta∣bacco, as Leri∣us saith. The women take it not. Petum (it is not Tabacco) not in pipes, but put foure or fiue leaues in another greater, and firing it, suck in the smoke, and therewith, in time of warre, will sustaine themselues three dayes to∣gether, without other sustenance. They weare this herbe about their neckes. CHAP. V. Of the Warres, Man-eating, and other Rites of the Brasilians. THe Brasilians exercise irreconciliable hostilitie, not to enlarge their do∣minions, but only to be reuenged for the death of their friends and an∣cestors, slaine by their enemies. The Elder men, as they sit or lie in their hanging beds, will make an Oration of the vertue of their Prede∣cessors, and of their sustained wrongs, and so excite the yonger to take armes: these Orations last sometimes six houres. Their armes are clubs or woodden swords, fiue or six foot long, and a foot broad, a finger thicke, and very sharpe. One of these men being throughly moued, would trouble two of our Fencers. Their bowes are as long as ours, the string made of the herbe Tocon, little, yet able to endure the strength of a horse: their arrowes an ell long, which they will shoot twice as fast, as our men: they haue leather shields: Their elder men lead the rankes (if they may be so called, which haue none to marshall or order them) and with great shouts, and shewing the enemies the bones of their slaine-friends, they enter into a fierce bat∣tell. Their captiues they conuey in the middest of their armie home to their territories, and thereunto the men will not sticke to giue their sisters or daughters, to performe all the duties of a wife, and feed them with the best, till they redemand the same out of their flesh: the men are employed (if it be long before the slaughter) in hunting, fow∣ling, fishing; the women in gardening, or gathering, Oisters. When that dismall day approcheth, knowledge is giuen, and the men, women, and children assemble to the place appointed, and there passe the morning in drinking; and the Captiue (although he knoweth the dreadfull issue) danceth, drinketh, and frolickes it with the best. After six or seuen houres thus spent, two or three of the strongest fasten a rope about his middle, leauing his armes at libertie, and so lead him vp and downe the Village in tri∣umph. Neither doth he for all this hang downe his head, as men fiere going to be han∣ged, but with incredible courage emblazoneth his owne worthinesse. Thus, thus, saith he, haue I sometimes bound your kindred, and thy father, saith he to one, haue I de∣uoured, and thy brethren (to another) haue I boucned and eaten: and what innumera∣ble numbers of you Touou Pinambausy haue these hands taken, this throat swallowed? Neither will the Margaiates suffer this my death vnreuenged. Then they bring him stones, & bid him reuenge his death. He hurleth them at those which stand about him,
wherof there are some foure thousand, and hurteth diuers: I saw one (saith our Author) whose legge I had thought had beene broken by the violence of one of those blowes. After this comes one, which all this while had beene hidden, with the This Clubbe they call wa∣ra Pernm, which is conse∣crated to this mischiefe by certaine cere∣monies of singing and painting. fatall clubbe, and, Art not thou one of the Margaiates? saith he: and hast thou not deuoured our kin∣dred? the other answereth, O how lustily I haue done it, how prompt haue I beene in taking them, how greedy in eating? And therefore, replieth the other, shalt thou be kil∣led and rosted on the Boucan. What then? saith he, my death shall not be This confi∣dence is as wel in the women as in the men. vnreuenged. The club ends their dialogue, with one blow striking him dead. His wife (if he had any, as they sometimes vse to bestow on their capitues) comes to the carkasse, and spends a little time and passion in mourning, but her Crocodiles teares are soone dried, and the humor fals into her teeth, which water for the first morsell. The other women, especial∣ly the elder (which are most cruell and greedy) bring hot water and wash the body, and rub it till it looke like the skin of a Pig: then comes the Master of the feast, which owed the captiue, and cuts it out as readily, as any Butcher with vs can doe a Wether. They daub the children o.Stad.lib.2.cap.9. with the bloud: foure women carry about the armes and legs for a shew, with shouts and cries: The trunk is diuided into two parts, the vpper part being cut and separated from the lower: the inwards are left to the women, which seeth and make broth of them called Mingau, which they sup vp, with their children: they eat al∣so the flesh about the head. The braine, tongue, and that which within the head may serue for meat, is the childrens share. The author of the feast hath a new name added to the former (for they haue so many names as they haue slaine captiues, the chiefe of the Cottage branding him on the arme, with an honorable marke for the memory therof) and all that day he must spend in quiet. The Wayganna Stad.l.2.c.3. are a kinde of Brasilians, which hold confederacy with no other nation, but kil all which come to their hands, and that so cruelly, that they will cut off their armes and legs while they are aliue. These liue in the mountaines. They cut them with stones, and those which haue trade with the Chri∣stians, vse kniues. Their Boucan is a grediron of foure cratches, set in the ground, a yard high, and as much asunder, with billets laid thereon, and other stickes on them grate∣wise. On this they rost the flesh, putting fire vnder, all the people standing about the same, and euery one gets a little peece of him. But me thinkes I see horror expressed in the countenance of him that reades this, and euery one weary of viewing this tragedy, loathing this inhumane feasting with humane flesh: I will therefore leaue their sham∣bles, and (which better beseemes a Pilgrime) will visit their holies and holy places. But alas, where or what are they? Maffaeus hath already told vs, that they obserue no Gods; and Lerius confirmes the same, yet sheweth that they acknowledge a Diuell, whom they call Aygnan: not that they worship him, but are tormented by him. Euen in spea∣king of him, Ler.cap.16. they tremble, and the remembrance breeds a compassion at amazement in the hearer, an amazed passion in the speaker, while he applauds our happinesse, free from such tyranny, deplores his owne miserie: he sometimes in the forme of a beast, sometimes in forme of a bird, and other-whiles deformed in some monstrous shape, doth grieuously torment them. Euen whiles the Christians were in conference with them, they would pitiously cry out, Hei, Hei, helpe, Aygnan vexeth me. Nor could this be counterfeit in the iudgement of any that conuersed with them. They beleeue the immortalitie of the soule, and that the soules of the vertuous, that is, (in their fense) of such as haue killed and eaten many enemies, shal fly beyond the highest mountains, and be gathered to the soules of their progenitors, and there liue in pleasant gardens, and perpetuall dancings and delicacies. The cowardly ghosts shal be carried vnto tor∣ment, by Aygnan, without end. They haue no name, whereby to signifie GOD vnto them, but wondered to heare what the French-men told of the Creator of Heauen and Earth. And because they are afraid of thunder, which they call Toupan, they told them that GOD was author thereof: the foolish Indians reply, that he was then naught which would make them afraid. But the feare of Aygnan made them sometimes flexible to embrace the Christian Religion, hearing that this Diuell was inferiour to the Christi∣ans GOD. So that euen in these, the most degenerate of all, which I haue obserued in this long and tedious Pilgrimage, there is some sparke left of Religion, euen in
the acknowledgement of a Deuill, and of eternall rewards and punishments. This is further confirmed by that which is written of certaine Magicians or Priests amongst them: which persuade the people, that they haue dealings with spirits, that by their meanes they haue their rootes and sustenance, and may by them haue forti∣tude. I (sayth Lerius) was present at one of their Assemblies, where six hundred were gathered together, which diuided themselues into three parts; the Men went into one house, the Women into a second, the Children into a third. The Caraibes for∣bad the women and children to depart their houses, but to attend diligently to sing∣ing: and we (sayth he) were commaunded to abide with the women. Anon the men in one house fell to singing, He, He, He, answered by the women in the other with the same. They howled it out for a quarter of an houre, shaking their breasts, and fo∣ming at the mouth, and (as if they had had the falling sicknesse) some falling downe in a swoune, the Deuill (in seeming) entring into them. The children also followed in the same harsh deuotions. After this, the men sung pleasantly, which caused me to goe thither, where I found them singing and dauncing in three seuerall Rings, in the middest of each three or foure Caraibes, adorned with Hats and garments of feathers, euery one hauing a Maraca, or Rattle, in both his hands. These Rattles are made of a fruit bigger then an Ostriches egge, out of which they said, that the Spirit would speake, and they continually shooke them, for the due consecration. These Caraibes daunced to and fro, and blowed the smoake of Petum on the standers by, saying, Re∣ceiue yee all the Spirit of Fortitude, whereby yee may ouercome your enemies. This they did often: the solemnitie continued two houres, the men ignorant of Musicke, and yet rauishing my spirit with the delight I conceiued in their Song. Their wordes sounded this, that they were grieued for the losse of their progenitors, but were com∣forted in the hope, that they should one day visit them beyond the Hills; and then threatened the Ovetacates ( Ler.c.5. which dwell not farre from them, and at enmitie with all their neighbours, as swift as Harts, wearing their haire to the buttockes, eating raw flesh, and differing from all others in Rites and Language) and now prophesied their destruction at hand. Some what also they added in their Song of the Floud, that once had drowned all the world, but their ancestors, which escaped by climbing high trees. That day they feasted with great cheare. This Solemnitie is celebrated euery third yeare; and then the Caraibes appoint in euery Familie three or foure Maraca, to be adorned with the best feathers, and sticked in the ground, with meat and drinke set before them; and the people beleeue they eate it. They minister vnto their. Maraca fifteene dayes; after which, in a superstiti∣ous conceit, they thinke, that a Spirit speakes to them while they rattle their Maraca. They were exceedingly offended, if any tooke away any of this Prouision, as the French sometimes did; for which, and denying other the Caraibes lyes, those Priests hated them exceedingly. Yet doe they not adore their Maraca, or any thing else. Stadius Stad.l.2.c.23. tells (as you heard) that they ascribed his taking to the prediction of their Maraca. He tells of their consecration, that the Letu sayth, That the Cai∣bes & the Paygi are two kinds: Thevet but one: and Sta∣dius mentions no more but the Paygi. Paygi (so hee calls them) enioyne that euery one should carrie their Tamaraka to the house, where they should receiue the facultie of speech. Euery ones rattle is pitched in the ground by the stele or stalke, and all of them offer to the Wizard which hath the chiefe place, arrowes, feathers, and eare-rings; he then breaths Petnn on euery rattle, puts it to his mouth, shakes it, and saith, Nee Kora, that is, Speake if thou be within: anon followeth a squeaking voice which I, saith Stadius thought the Wizard did, but the people ascribed it to the Ta∣maraka. Then those Wizards perswade them to make warres, saying, that those spi∣rits long to feede on the flesh of Captiues. This done, euery one takes his Rattle and builds vp a roome for it to keepe it in, where he sets victualls, requireth and asketh all necessaries thereof, as we doe of God: and these, as Stadius affirmeth, are their Gods. These Paygi doe initiate women vnto witchcraft by such ceremonies of smoke, dan∣cing, &C. till shee fall as in the falling sicknesse, and then he saith, hee will reuiue her, and make her able to foretell things to come: and therefore when they goe to the
warre they will consult with these women, which pretend conference with spirits. Andrew Thenet A. Thevet Antarct. (which was in France with Villagagnon) agreeth in many of the former reports: he addeth, that for feare of Aignan they will not goe out, but they will carrie fire with them, which they thinke is forceable against him: that the Paygi exercise poysonings, coniuration, and other things, which I know not with what au∣thoritie he auerreth against the former witnesses, whereas Thevet, sometimes taken in lying, deserueth lesse credit in the rest. When there is any tempest in the water, hee sayth they attribute it to the soules of their progenitors, and cast something into the water, to appease it. They haue a tradition, That one, in habit like to the Christians, had long since told their progenitors of diuine matters, but to so little effect, as he forsooke them; and euer since had those bloudie Warres continued amongst them. How little the Iesuites can preuaile, in bringing the Brasilians to Christianitie, Maffaus Maff. l.15. Piecre du Iarric l.3.a.c.22. ad finem. hath written somewhat, and Pierre du Iarric, a Iesuite, very largely; which is not so pertinent to our present purpose. In Marriages Ler. c.17. they abstaine onely from mother, sister, and daughter: they obserue no Marriage-Ceremonies, but vpon consent of her friends and her owne, take her home. It is a credit to haue many wiues, amongst whome is no Leah to enuie Rachels greater portion of loue: the husband may kill the Adulteresse; but for their vnmarri∣ed maidens they are not serupulous. Our Author, hearing a woman cry in the night, thought she had beene in some danger of deuouring by a wilde Beast, but found her husband playing the homely Midwife to her in her trauell, biting off the nauell-string, and pressing downe the nose. The father washeth and painteth him. They vse to put to their male infants little Bowes and Arrowes into the bed, and chat out their hope of the childs valour, in being auenged when he shall be a man, vpon his enemies. They name their children at aduenture, by the name of a Beast, Bird, or otherwise, as this child was called Orapacon, that is, Bow and Arrowes. The men are modest, in accom∣panying with their wiues secretly. The women haue not the ordinarie feminine sick∣nesse. Lerius thinkes, that humor was diuerted in their youth, seeing the mothers cut their daughters side downe to the thigh, at twelue yeares of age. But twice while he was there, did he see any in priuat brawling, or contention: if such happens, as they be∣gan, so they are suffered to end it: if any hurt, or kill other, he sustaineth the like in his owne person, inflicted by the kindred of the partie wronged. They haue their proper peeces of ground, which they husband with their Rootes and Mais. When they en∣tertaine a stranger, the Moussacat, or good-man, seemes to neglect him a while, and the guest sits him downe silent on the bed, the women sit by on the ground, and hold their hands before their eyes, weeping, with many prayses, that he is a good man, a valiant man, that (if he be a Christian) he hath brought them fine wares. The stranger must en∣deuour, in some measure, to imitate the like weeping gesture. The Moussacat is all this while whittling his arrow, not seeming to see his new guest, till anon he comes: And are you come, sayth he? How doe you? with many termes of his best Rhetoricke: and then askes, if he be hungrie; and if he be, sets his cheare before him on the ground: which kindnesse is repayed with Glasses, Combes, or the like. They are very kind both to their owne, and to such strangers as they are enleagued with. They would carrie burthen, or man, for the space of some myles, when they needed: their loue and hatred are in like extreames; the one to their owne, the other to their enemies. They haue Physicians, called Pages. They vse much mourning at the death of any, and making a round pit, burie him vpright therein, six houres after his death, with that wealth they had. In their Villages liue some six hundred persons: they remoue their Villages of∣ten, which yet carrie the same name. Stadius Sted.l.2.c.5. sayth, there are few Villages of aboue seuen houses, but those houses are a hundred and fiftie foot long, and two fathomes high, without diuision into pluralitie of Roomes; and therein liue many Families, all of one kindred. What our Countreymen haue done on this Coast, I referre the Reader to M. Hak∣luyts Discoueries.
CHAP. VI. Of the Riuer of Plate, and the Countries adioyning: and of the Magellanc Strat. s. THis Riuer wee haue alreadie mentioned; the Indians Botero. call it Parana: and Iohn Dias di Solis discouering the same in the yere 1512, for some shew it seemed to haue of that Mettall, called it the Riuer of Plata, or Siluer. It is fortie leagues wide in the entrance, and preuaileth so farre against the Oceans saltnesse, that the tast of the fresh water soo∣ner discernes his waters, then the eye can see his bankes. It ouerflow∣eth the Countrey; as Nilus in Egypt, and Orenoque, Marannon, with the other great Riuers in America. It ebbeth and floweth a hundred miles vp the streame. Sebastian Ca∣bot may rather be called the first discouerer. Dias, whome some call the first Discouerer, was, with fiftie of his companions, there slaine and eaten. But he which hath most fully discouered the Nations that dwell neere this Riuer, is Huldericus Admiranda Nauig. H.S. Schmidel, who sayled thither in the yeare 154, and continued in those parts almost twentie yeares. He sayled thither with Peter Mendoza, who car∣ried with him fiue and twentie hundred men, to discouer, conquer, and inhabite those Regions. They built the Citie Buenas aeres, so called of the holesome ayre, neere to an Indian towne, named Carendies, of three thousand inhabitants; if that may be called a towne, whose inhabitants stay not long in one place. They will drinke the bloud of the beasts they kill, for thirst. The Spaniards destroyed them, whose parts Famine seemed to take against that cruell people, which with inuisible darts so pierced their entrailes, that vile and venomous creatures were applyed to the cuting of their wounded stomackes: and when such medicines failed, three of them stole a Horse These horses so multiplied in these parts, that now they are dispersea in wild troops, and they will hunt and kill them for the Hides, and (which is a great commo∣ditie in Ango∣la) for the tailes. , minding to flee from Fa∣mine on that dead Beast, but were therefore horsed on a Gibbet; where three others, that by his example were terrified from Horse-flesh, aduentured vpon these carkasses, cutting thence large gobbets, to pay that cruellest tyrant, and greediest exactor, Hun∣ger, his tribute. Another, whose brother died, buried him in his owne bodie: halfe their companie were consumed with this plague. The Indians of Carendies, Bartennis, Zeechuvas, and Tiembus, taking this aduan∣tage, assayled their Towne of Good Aires, turning it into good fires, by shooting a∣rowes, fired at the end, thereinto. They after passed vp the Riuer, and came to Tiem∣bus, where the men are tall and great, their women alway deformed, with scratched and bloudie faces. The Tiembus could make fiue thousand men. Of the Spaniards were not left fiue hundred in a small time; and Mendoza dieth, returning homewards. The Curenda, the next people, are like the Tiembus. The Macverendas liue onely on Fish, and a little Flesh. There they killed a Serpent fiue and twentie foot long, and as bigge as a man. The Salvaisco goe starke-naked, and liue onely on Fish, Flesh, and Ho∣ney. The Curemagbas are of huge stature: the men bore a hole in their nose, in which they weare a Parrots feather. The women paint their faces with indeleble lines. The Carios Countrey is large, neere to the Brasilians in Rites and Site. They goe naked: they will sell; the father, his daughter; the husband, his wife; the brother, his sister: The price of a woman is a Hatchet, Knife, or such like. They sat such as they take in théir Warres, and then deuoure them with great solemnitie. The Lampere made neere vnto their Towne Pits, with sharpe stakes set vp in them, couered with stickes and earth: these they made for the Spaniards, but in a confused flight fell therein themselues. Here the Spaniards built the Towne of Assumption. The King of the Scherves, at∣tended with twelue thousand men, met the Spaniards, and gaue them friendly enter∣tainement, with Dauncing, Musicke, and Feasting. The women goe naked, and paint themselues as artificially as any of our Painters could doe: they weare Carpets of Cotton, with the figures of Indian Beasts.
The King asked the Spaniards, What they sought? who answered, Siluer and Gold: He then gaue them a siluer Crowne, which he said he had taken in the warres which he had waged with the Amazones, that dwelt two moneths iourney thence. Of these A∣mazones the Indians told the same things that Orellana told of, neere that riuer, which hath receiued name of this supposition. The Spaniards, with some of the Scherves for their Guides, set forth for this Ama∣zonian Discouerie, but were encountred by the way with hote waters, in which they waded vp to the waste, and so continued diuerse dayes, till they came to a Nation cal∣led Orthuesen, who were then infected with a Pestilence, caused by Famine; which Famine the Grashoppers had effected, two yeares together eating vp all the fruits which Nature or Husbandrie had prouided for their sustenance. Thus the Amazones, the Martiall and Venerean Warres of the Spaniards, wanted foode to hold out further: if there were any such people, and that they were not, as before I said, the warre-like wiues, or happily some gallant Viragoes, that by them∣selues would let the world see what women could doe: but yet I cannot subscribe to the rest of their Storie. But I am wearie of leading you any further in this discouerie of this great Riuer and the neere inhabitants, seeing little is obserued in our Author of their Religions. Some of these barbarous Nations, he saith, hanged vp the hairie skinne of their slaine enemies in their Temples, or Houses of deuotion: This people is called Icperi. To giue you a Catalogue of the names of the Indian Nations that inhabited these parts, would be but tedious: These iourneyes of the Spaniards were to see what gold, and not what Gods, the Indians had. They passed vp through the land into Peru. Betweene Peru Botro. and these more Easterly parts, are the Hills Aud, or Andes, which lift vp their Snowie toppes vnto the Clouds, and reach vnto the Magellane Straits. In them inhabite many fierce Nations, bordering vpon the Nations of Brasil and Plata. The Ciraguans, the Viracans, the Tovi, the Varai. These last exercise their children vnto Armes betimes, vnto them they commit their Captiues, for try∣all of their bloudie forwardnesse; and he which at one blow can kill a Captiue, is of the greatest hopes, and rewarded for his encouragement. To this end they name their children Tygre, Lyon, that their names might teach them the like beastly fu∣rie. At the new and full Moone they wound themselues with sharpe bones, to inure themselues to thinges of Warre. They weepe in the entertainement of a friend, as the Brasilians doc. In seuenteene degrees stands the Spanish Ci∣tie of Holy Crosse of the Mountaine. The Riuer Vapai in those Valleyes riseth and falleth, as Nilus doth. There is a Brooke at Holy Crosse of a wonder∣full nature: it is but little aboue two yards broad, and shallow withall, not run∣ning aboue a league, but is drunke vp of the thirstie sands. yet doth this brooke prouide the Citie water, and three sorts of good Fish, and that in great plentie, from the end of Februarie to the end of May. At other times there are few. They vse di∣uers meanes of shauing their heads, which, they say, they learned of one Paicume. In the womans lying in, the man keepes his bed, as is said of the Brasilians. More towards the East dwell the Itatini people, which call themselues Garay, that is, Warriours; and others, Tapuis or Slaues. The language of the Varai is common to all these Nations with the Brasilians, that as in the other world Latin, Sclaon, and Arabian, so in that New World the Varay, Cuscan, and Mexican language, will ge∣nerally serue a mans turne. The Kingdome of Tucuma stretcheth two hundred leagues betweene Chili, Brasil, Holy Crosse, and Paraguay. The Spaniards haue therein fiue Colonies. It is a plaine Countrie. The Paraguay inhabite along the Riuer, so called, whereof they take name. From Plata Southwards is the great Region of Chica, washed on the South, East, and West by the Sea. The Inhabitants are called Patagones. The Spaniards Pigafetta ap. am. which with Magellane first discouered the Straits, saw Gyants on this coast, of which he carryed away one with him to Sea, where after for want of sufficient foode he dyed.
Edward Ed. Cliffe, ap. Hak. Cliffe, that wrote Master Winters Voyage, who first, of all others, re∣turned out of the Straits by the same way homewards, because he saw on this Coast men of common stature, he excepteth against that report of Giants, as a Giant-like report, exceeding the stature and measure of Truth. But besides that some of our owne M. T. Can∣dishes Voyage ap. Hak. to.3. written by Fr.Pretty. at another time measured the print of mens feete eighteene ynches in the Sands, Oliuer Nauig.Ol. & Seb. W. in Additam.9. part. Americae. Noort in his World-Compassing Voyage, had three of his men slaine by men of admirable stature, with long haire, not farre from Port Desire, about seuen and fortie degrees of Southerly latitude, and after, in the Magellane Straits discom∣fited a band of Sauages, which neither would yeeld, nor flee from their wiues and children, which were in a Caue iust by, till euery man was flaine. Foure boyes the Hollanders carried away: one of which, learning their Language, told them of three Families, or Tribes, in those parts of ordinarie stature, and of a fourth which were Giants, ten or eleuen foot high, which warred vpon the former. Sebalt de Weert being detained fiue moneths in the Straits by foule weather, sent his men to fish for their prouision (which exceedingly failed them) who there were suddenly assailed by seuen Canoas of Giants, which they guessed to be so high as is mentioned: who being put to flight by their Peeces, fledde to land, and plucked vp Trees, in their rude manner barricadoing and fortifying themselues against the fur∣ther pursuit of the Hollanders, who were no lesse glad that they were ridde of such companie. These men, both Giants and others, went either wholly naked, or so clothed, as they seemed not to dread the cold, which is yet there so violent, that besides the Mountaine-toppes, alway couered with Snow, their very Summers, in the middest thereof, freeth them not from Ice. Yea, at that time of the yeare those Hollanders encountred an Island of Ice in the Sea, which the cold Ayre had there mounted and maintained in despight of Neptunes rage, or the Sunnes volley of shot, in his neerest approach. The Trees in these parts, and the men (it seemeth) are naturally fortified against those Colds; the one (as is said) alwayes in manner naked, the other alwayes clothed, out-brauing the Winters violence in their Summer-like Greene Liuerie, see∣ming to stoupe vnder the burthen of continuall Frosts and Snowes, and in a naturall wisdome cloth themselues, and hold their leaues the suren. Those Giantly men Th. Candish. about Port Desire, when they die, are brought to the Cliffes, and there buried, with their Bowes, Arrowes, Darts, and all their (al∣most no) substance. The Sauages about the Straits feede (as both the same Au∣thor and the Hollanders report) on raw Flesh, and other filthie foode, and are Man-eaters. It is no small credit to our Nation and Nauigation, that these Straits haue more enlarged themselues, and giuen oftener and freer passage to vs then to any other. Drake See Hak.to.3. swamme through; Winter both passed and returned; Candish passed, but returned (as Drake had done) about the World in his Circuit. The Delight of Bristol entred them, and with small delight spent six weekes in them: and Captaine Danies, companion of Master Candish in his last Voyage, three times entred the South Sea, which three times forced him backe into the Embracing Armes of the vn∣trustie Straits. Some others haue attempted, but not attained them, as Fenton and Ward, and the Voyage set forth 1586 by the Earle of Cumberland. The Land on Sir F.Drake. both sides the Straits is very mountainous, the lower Mountaines whereof, al∣though they be for their height wonderfull, yet (as wee haue said of the differing statures of the men) they haue more Giantly ouer-lookers, with Snowie lockes and Cloudie lookes; betweene them may be numbred three Regions of Cloudes. These Straits are fourescore and tenne Acosta saith 100, of which, 70 the North Sea floweth in, and the South Sea 30.l.3.c.13. Leagues through, of vnequall breadth, in the narrowest place a League ouer. The mouth is in two and fiftie degrees, and ½. The Voyage of Sir Francis so vexed the Spaniard Lopez Vaz. , that he sent Pedro Sar∣miento to inhabite there, that he might prohibite other Nations to passe that way:
but Tempest and Famine hating the Spanish insolence, whose ambitious designes alway aymed at a Plus vltra, brought them to a Plus vltra indeede, further then euer they had designed, diuerse of the Shippes (which at first were three and twentie, with three thousand fiue hundred men) perishing in the deuouring iawes of the Ocean, and others in their selfe-deuouring Mawes of Hunger, which eate them vp with not eating. The Name of IESVS, and Philips Citie were their two newly erected Colo∣nies, peopled with foure hundred men and thirtie women, which by Famine were brought to three and twentie persons, when Master Candish tooke Hernando, one of that companie, in his prosperous Voyage; another W.Magot ap.Hak. , who had maintained himselfe by his Peece, and liued in a house alone a long time, was taken by the Delight of Bri∣stol, two yeares after. The English gaue a name fitting to this distressed Citie, calling it Port Famine. The last Voyage of Master Candish proued vnfortunate, both in the losse of him∣selfe, and many men: the blacke Pinnace was lost in the South Sea: the Desire re∣turned, but lost diuerse of her men, surprised (as was Iohn Iane. thought) and deuoured by the Sauages, neere to Port Desire. The Sauages here presented themselues, throwing dust in the Aire, leaping &c. and either had Vizards on their faces, like Dogges faces, or else their faces were Dogges faces indeede. CHAP. VII. Of Terra Australis, and Chili. AS for the Land on the Southerne side of the Straits, it is Botero. called the Land of Fire, either because the Discoueres saw fire thereabouts, or because that cold Climate so much needeth Fire. More Easterly, a∣gainst the Cape of Good Hope, is the Land Terra di Vista. This Land about the Straits is not perfectly discouered, whether it be Continent, or Islands. The most take it for Continent, and extend it (more in their imagination then any mans experience, towards those Islands of Salomon and New Guinnee, esteeming (of which there is great probabilitie) that Terra Australis, or the Southerne Continent, may, for the largenesse thereof, take vp a fifth place in or∣der, and the first in greatnesse, in the Diuision and Parting of the whole World. Lopez Vaz writeth, That the Gouernours which the King of Spaine sendeth for Peru and New Spaine, haue a custome to discouer New Countries. The Licentiate Castro being Gouernour of Peru, sent forth a Fleet from Lima; which sayling eight hundred Leagues Westward, found certain Islands in eleuen degrees to the South of the Equinoctiall, with a kinde of people of yellowish complexion, and all naked. Here they found Hogges, Dogges, Hennes, Cloues, Ginger, Cinnamon, and some Gold. The first Island they named Izabella, the greatest Guadalcanal, on the Coast whereof they sayled a hundred and fiftie Leagues, where they tooke a Towne, and some graines of Gold hanged vp in the houses. They burnt their Towne, because they had in a suddaine surprise killed foureteene of their men. They spent foureteene moneths in this Discouerie, and named them the Islands of Salomon, that by that name men might be further induced to discouer and inhabit them, imagining, that Salomon had his Gold from thence. Nva Bot. part.1.vol.2. Guinea was discouered by Villalobos, sent from New Spaine in the yeare 1543, going to discouer the Moluccas. The inhabitants are blacke of hue, and wit∣tie. The Spaniards haue coasted it seuen hundred Leagues, and yet cannot tell whe∣ther it be an Isle or Continent.
Hesselius Gerardus hath largely set forth the Petition or Memoriall of P Fer. de Quir, Detecti Australis Incoge∣nit. Peter Fer∣dinandez de Quir, vnto the King of Spaine, about his Discouerie of those Southerne vnknowne Lands, for the Plantation of the same: wherein hee declareth vnto his Maiestie, that fourteene yeares space hee had busied himselfe to no small endamage∣ment of his State and Person about the same. The length thereof hee equalleth vnto all Europe, and as much of Asia, as thence extendeth to the Caspian Sea: and for the wealth and riches he calls it a Terrestriall Paradise. The Inhabitants, he affirmeth, are innumerable, some white, some like the Mula∣tos, and some otherwise, in colour and habite of bodie diuersified. They neither haue King, nor Lawes, nor Arts. They are diuided and warre one vpon another, with Bowes, Arrowes, and other weapons, all of wood. They haue their Oratories and Places of Buriall. Their bread is made of three forts of rootes. They haue varietie of fruits, Cocos, Almonds of foure sorts, Pome-citrons, Apples, Dates: there are also Swine, Goats, Hennes, Partriches, and other Fowles; and as the Indians report, Kine, and Buffals. He saw amongst them siluer, and pearles, others added, gold: and the Coast-Countries seemed to promise great wealth within Land: Many Riuers, Su∣gar Canes, Bayes, Hauens, and other commodities of Lands and Seas, making shew of an other China: the aire very holsome and temperate. He tooke possession thereof in the name of the King, and set vp a Crosse & a Chap∣pell, in the name of The Ladie of Loretto. These Regions trend euen as high as the Aequinoctiall. When this Discouerie was made he mentioneth not; only hee sueth to the King for employment therein. It is rightly called Terra Australis Incognita, and therefore I will not take vpon me to be your guide: in an other sense one Mercurius Britannicus. of our Countrymen hath wittily and learnedly (according to his wont) described this Countrie, and parallelled therewith the Countries of Europe, and hath let vs see that we are acquainted in those coasts too much, and neede no Pilot or guide to conduct vs. But let vs come backe to our Streits of Magellane, that wee may coast from thence and visit the Countries of Chili and Peru: for of the Westerne borders of Chica, girt in betweene the salt waues and cold Hills, little can bee said fitting our purpose. Hauing sayled out of the Streits, we haue a wide Sea before vs, and on our right hand the Countrie is so barren and cold, that I would not hold the Reader in any cold or tedious Narration thereof. We will hasten rather nearer to the Sunne, where we first encounter with Chili. This name Botero. some extend euen to the Straits, where we haue placed Chica and the Patagones, others G.Ens.l.2.c.4 straiten it in shorter bounds; be∣tweene Chica on the South; Charchas and Collao, on the North; Plata, on the East; and the Sea on the West: it is called Chill of the chilling cold, for so the word is sayd to signifie. The Hills with their high lookes, cold blasts, and couetous encrochings, driue it almost into the Sea: only a narrow Valley vpon lowly submission to her swel∣ling aduersaries, obtayneth roome Lop. Vaz. for fiue and twentie leagues of breadth, where it is most, to extend her spacious length of two hundred leagues on that shore: and to withstand the Oceans furie, shee paies a large Tribute of many streames, which yet in the L. Apollon.hist.Peru.l.1. night time shee can The Riuers of Chili in the night time frozen. hardly performe; the miserable Hills in their Fro∣zen charitie, not imparting that naturall bountie and dutie, till that great Arbiter the Sunne ariseth, and sendeth Day with his light-horse troupe of Sunne-beames, to breake vp those Icie Dungeons and Snowie Turrets, wherein Night, the Mountaines Gaoler, had locked the innocent Waters. Once, the poore Valley is so hampered be∣twixt the Tyrannicall Meteors and Elements, as that shee often Earthquakes in Chili, and their effects. quaketh with feare, and in these chill Feuers shaketh off and looseth her best ornaments. Arequipa Some rec∣kon this Town to Peru. one of her fairest Townes, by such disaster, in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred fourescore and two, fell to the ground. And sometimes the neighbour hils are infected with this pestilent Feuer, and tumble downe as dead in the plaine, there∣by so amazing the fearefull Riuers, that they runne quite out of their Channells
to seeke new, or else stand still with wonder; and the motiue heat failing, fall into an vncouth tympanie, their bellies swelling into spacious and standing Lakes: the tides seeing this, hold back their course, and dare not approch their sometime-beloued streames by diuers miles distance, so that betwixt these two stooles the ships come to ground indeede. The sick earth thus hauing her mouth stopped, and her stomack ouer-laied, forceth new mouths whence shee vomiteth streames of oppressing waters. I speake not of the beasts and men which in these ciuill warres of Nature must needes bee subiect to deuouring miserie. These are the strange effects of cold and earth-quakes, not strange in Chili, where we are now arriued. The people are fierce and cruell, and some (as is reported) Gyants. Almagro one of the first Conquerours of Peru, in hope of gold, passed from thence hither: but was deceiued by the Indians which led him the wrong way. In passing the Deserts of Chili, the Aire is so piercing (as before is obserued) Acost.l.3.c.9 that men fall downe dead, or else loose their members sud∣denly, in manner without feeling. Ierome Costilla the Generall, one of Acosta's ac∣quaintance, had lost three or foure Toes which fell off without any paine: many of his Armie dyed, whose bodies at his returne hee found lying there without stinke or corruption, and one Boy remayned aliue which had maintayned himselfe by eating horse flesh. The horses also were found whole as Apollonius L:Apollon.hist.Peru.l.3. writeth, and the men sitting on them, as if they had beene aliue, with the Bridles in their hand. In six and thirtie de∣grees is that famous Valley of Arauco, which defend their persons and freedome, maugre all the force and furie of the Spaniards Nuno da Silua. . These killed two of Sir Francis Drakes men, and wounded himselfe: they destroyed also three and twentie Hollan∣ders, of the companie of Cordes: both which they did in detestation of the Oliu.de Noort. Spaniards, of whom they esteemed the English and Dutch, because of their apparell. They haue destroyed many of the Spaniards: they tooke the Citie Baldiuia in the yeare 1599. and slew the Spaniards. Twice before, if not oftner, they had burnt and spoiled it. Yea Baldiuia himselfe, the first Conquerour of Chili, (for Almagro stayed not) and of whom that Citie receiued name, was taken by these Indians, his horse being slaine vnder him. They bid him feare nothing, hee should haue gold enough: and making a great banquet for him, brought in the last seruice, which was a cup full of molten gold, which they forced him to drinke, saying; Now glut thy selfe with gold. This Bal∣diuia had entred Chili with foure hundred horse, and easily conquered that part which had beene subiect to the Kings of Peru: but the other which was the richer part held out. The Spaniards sent them word they were the Sonnes of GOD, and came to teach them the word of GOD: and if they would not yeeld to them, they would shoot fire among them. The Indians would trie this argument in the field, and there the great Ordnance so well pleaded the cause, that they beleeued and subiected them∣selues. The Spaniards employed them in the Mines, whence they gathered such plen∣tie of gold that others had twentie thousand, but Baldinia himselfe had three hun∣dred thousand Pezos by the yeare. The Indians after, perceiuing the Spaniards to be but mortall men, rebelled: and whereas they had vsed to carrie grasse into the Folt for the Spaniards horses, they con∣ueyed, in the same, weapons, by which meanes, being assisted of their fellowes with∣out, they wonne the Fort, and when Baldiuia would haue recouered it, he lost himselfe as you haue heard. Euer since, this hostilitie hath continued, and the Araucans are the lifts and barres to the Spanish conquests. Their Countrie (to consider Arauco by it selfe) is but small, about twentie leagues in length: neither could the Ingas or Kings of Peru conquer it: their manner of Warre is much like the Christians, in pitched battells placing their Bow-men among their rankes of Pike-men. To speake of other Townes which the Spaniards haue built in this coast, is not our purpose: when they sacked Baldiuia 1599. they feasted the Spaniards with the like golden cups
cups powred hot downe their throats: they Ol.de Noort. cut of the Images heads, triumphing o∣uer the Spaniards Gods, as they termed them. They were then at the siege of Impe∣riall, an other Spanish Citie, hauing before taken Baldiuia. They plucke out the hearts of the Spaniards which they kill, and drinke in their sculls. CHAP. VIII. Of the Conquest of Peru by the Spaniards, and of their Ingua's or Emperours. FRANCIS PIZARRO Gomar.c.144 was the Bastard Sonne of Gonçallo, a Cap∣taine in the Kingdome of Nauarre: he was borne at Trusiglio, and ex∣posed at the Church dore, and none being found that would giue him the breast, hee was nourished by sucking a Sow for certaine daies: at last his Father acknowledged him, and when hee was growne, set him to keepe his Swine, which being one day strayed and lost, he durst not returne home for feare, and therefore went to Siuill, and thence passed to the In∣dies. In this swinish education he had not so much as learned to reade. Hee went to Vraua with Alonso de Horeda; with Valuoa, to the discouerie of the South Sea; and with Pedrarias de Ala Gouernour of Golden Castile, to Panama. In this Citie Gom.c.108. Benzo.l.3.c.1. were diuers which affected golden discoueries. Pedrarias intended Nicaragna; but Diego di Almagro, Hernando Luche, or Luques, a rich Priest, and this Piçarro now growne rich, agreed to ioyne their purses and best industrie to search Southwards, where they had heard was store of wealth. They prouided a Nauie and two hundred and twentie Souldiers, and Almagro with Piçarro, in the Anno 1525. or (as Benzo hath it) 1526. set forward. Almagro and he parting cōpanie, Piçarro, offering to land his men, was wounded and forced to retire to Panama: Almagro in an other place had better successe, the Indians vsing him kindly, and giuing him three thousand Ducats of gold. But seeking to land in that place of Piçarro's misfortune, he was set vpon by the Indians, & lost in fight one of his eyes. They meet at panama, and hauing cured their wounds, repaire their for∣ces, and with two hundred men and many slaues, set sayle, and land in an other place, but are repelled to their ships by the Inhabitants, and goe to Gorgon, a little Iland, six miles from the Continent, where Piçarro stayed, while Almagro went back for bet∣ter supply. At his returene Piçarro and his companie were almost starued, but being refreshed, and all of them now together attempting the Indian shore, were repelled with losse to the Ile, which they called Galli. Almagro is againe sent backe for new aide, the Souldiers would haue passed with him, and curse this Land and their coue∣tousnesse. Piçarro and his companie agree to search further, and hauing sayled fiue hundred miles, came to Chira, a Prouince of Peru, and taking some of the Inhabitants to learne them the Spanish tongue, returned to Tumbez. Hauing learned of the Indians the great wealth of those parts, hee set one Peter, a Candian, on shore, who was kindly entertayned of the Gouernour, who shewed him a Temple dedicated to the Sunne, wherein were vnspeakeable riches, which when he related to Piçarro at his returne, the Spaniards goe back with these newes to Panama. His two fellowes Almagro and the Priest (called after, the foole, because he had spent his estate on this businesse, and was after excluded by his companions) agreed with Piçarro to goe to Spaine to get licence for this conquest, and borrowed one thousand and fiue hundred Ducats, to set him forth. Pizarro seekes and obtaines this Facultie only for himselfe, neuer mentioning his Partners, and with letters Pattents retur∣neth to Panama with his foure Brethren, Hernando, Gonzalo, Iohn, and Martin di Alcantara, his Brother by the Mothers side. His two Partners were not a little grieued when they heard howe things passed, but after much stirre,
Almagro and Piçarro became friends and agreed to communicate Purses and Titles. Piçarro goes before with a hundred and fiftie Souldiers (taking order that Almagro should follow with all the strength he could make) and lands in Peru, a Riuer so cal∣led, which gaue name to those mightie and rich Prouinces, because the Spaniards by this way discouered them. They went by land, enduring much miserie by the way to Coache where they were well refreshed. But a disease worse then the French Poxe there warred vpon them, called Pori. Yet did 'Piçarro hold on his resolution; he passed ouer to Puna, where the Gouernour intreated the Spaniards well, till the abusing of their Wiues caused the Indians to take armes, and so made their riches become a prey to the preuailing Spaniards. There had Piçarro the first intelligence of Atabaliba. The Gouernour of this I∣land, to satisfie his iealousie, cut off the noses, the members, and the armes, of his Eu∣nuchs or Keepers of his Women. Piçarro sent to Tumbez six hundred prisoners, which the Gouernour of this Iland had taken of the partie of Atabaliba, who at that time maintayned Warre against his Brother Guascar about the Soueraignetie, and this Gouernour had taken Guascars part. This ciuill discord was much to the Spa∣niards aduantage. Piçarro Gom.c.112. Apol.l.2. Ben. l.3.c.3. sent three Messengers to Tumbez to demand peace and safe entrance, but they (notwithstanding the freedome of their Captiues) deliuered them to the Priests to be sacrificed to their Idoll of the Sunne. He taketh Tumbez and sacketh the Temple and Citie. From thence he proceeded in his way to Caxamalca: and Guascar sent some vnto him with great promises to demand his aide against his brother Atabaliba: soone af∣ter Atabaliba sent one to him, to charge him to returne to his ships. Piçarro an∣swereth, That he came not to hurt any, but for their good, as his Emperour had gi∣uen him in charge, nor could he now, (being the Embassadour of the Pope and Em∣perour, Lords of the World) returne without great dishonour before hee had seene his Royall person, and communicated to him such instructions as might bee good for his bodie and soule. As he passed the Prouince of Chira, the Lords thereof prouoked him against Ata∣baliba, who had lately conquered their Countries. And on the Riuer of Chira hee founded the Colonie of St. Michael, for the safe keeping of his spoiles, and for his ships. He marcheth on to Caximalca, and sendeth Messengers on horse-back, to giue him notice of his comming. This strange beast made the Indians afraide, but Ata∣baliba was nothing moued therewith, more moued to see those bearded men giue him so little reuerence. Atabaliba sent Pizarro a paire of shooes, cut and gilded, that (as he pretended) he might know him: others thought, that he might be knowne and designed to imprisonment or slaughter. The next day the King was carried, as in solemne triumph, vpon mens shoulders, garded with fiue and twentie thousand Indians in rich pompe and magnificence. Vin∣centius de Valle-viridi, a Dominican Frier, holding in one hand a Crosse, in the other his Breuiarie, or (as some say) a Bible, came before him with great reuerence, and blessing him with the Crosse, said: Gom.c.11. Excellent Lord, it behoueth you to know, That GOD in Trinitie and Vnitie made the World of nothing, and formed a man of the Earth, whome he called Adam, of whom we all haue beginning. Adam sinned against his Creator by disobedience, and in him all his posteritie, except IESVS CHRIST: who being GOD, came downe from Heauen, and tooke flesh of the Virgine MARIE; and to redeeme Mankinde, died on a Crosse like to this (for which cause we worship it;) rose againe the third day, and after fortie dayes ascended into Heauen, leauing for his Vicar in Earth Saint Peter, and his Successours, which we call Popes; who haue This he spake according to the Bull of A∣lexander the sixt, which had giuen the sou∣therne & We∣sterne world to the Spanish Kings. The hornes of the Bull, and not of the Lambe, are the Popish weapons. giuen to the most puissant King of Spaine, Emperour of the Romanes, the Monarchy of the World. Obey the Pope, and receiue the Faith of CHRIST; and if yee shall beleeue it most holy, and that most false which yee haue, yee shall doe well; and know, that doing the contrarie, wee will make warre
on you, and will take away and breake your Idols; therefore leaue the deceiueable Religion of your false Gods. This Preaching of the Fryer might well seeme strange to Atabaliba, which it seemes he learned of the Mahumetans, and not of the Apo∣stles. Hee answered, That he was free, and would not become tributarie to any, nor did acknowledge any greater Lord then himselfe: and for the Emperour, hee could be pleased to be the friend of so great a Prince, and to know him: but for the Pope, he would not obey him, which gaue away that which was not his owne, and tooke a Kingdome from him whom hee had neuer seene: as for Religion, hee liked well his owne, and neither would nor ought to call it in question, being so ancient and approued, especially seeing CHRIST dyed, which neuer befell the Sunne or Moone, and how (saith he) doe you know that the GOD of the Christians created the World? Fryer Vincent answered, That his Booke told it him, and gaue him his Breuiarie. Atabaliba looked on it, and in it, and saying, it said no such thing to him, hurled it on the ground. The Fryer tooke it vp and went to Piçarro, crying, hee hath cast the Gospels to the ground, Reuenge it, O Christians, seeing they will not our friendship, nor our Law. Piçarro commanded to bring forth the Standard and the Ordnance: the Horse∣men in three Bands assayled Atabaliba's people, and slew many: hee himselfe arriued with his foot-men, which layed about with their swords: all charged vpon Atabaliba, slaying them which carryed him, whose roome was presently supplied by others, till at last Piçarro pulled him downe from his litter by the clothes. All this while not one Indian fought, because they had no commandement, and therefore no Spaniard was slaine, and many Indians perished vpon the thrust, for so the Fryer had bidden them fight, for feare of breaking their Swords: neither were any wounded, but only Piçarro, by one of his owne, thrusting at Atabaliba in his taking, and wounding Piçarro there∣with in the arme. Thus are the Indians chased, their King with other great spoiles remayning with the Spaniards. The next day the Spaniards scoured about for spoile, and found fiue thousand wo∣men of the Kings with much treasure. Atabaliba was much grieued with his impri∣sonment, especially in regard of the chaine which they put vpon him. Lop.Vaz. And when they had spent much reasoning about his ransome, a Souldier named Soto (of whom you haue heard in our Historie of Florida) said vnto him, wilt thou giue vs this house full of gold and siluer thus high Gomara saith that it was a great roome, and they made a red line a∣bout it: it was all of wrought mettall in ves∣sells, &c. ? lifting vp his sword and making a stroke vpon the wall: Atabaliba answered, That if they would giue him libertie to send into his Kingdome, he would fullfill their demand. Whereat the Spaniards much marueiling gaue him three moneths time, but he had filled the house in two moneths and a halfe, a matter scarse credible, yet most true: For I (saith Lopez Vaz) know aboue twentie men that were there at that time, who all affirme that it was aboue Gom. hath 252000. poūds of siluer, and 1326000.pezo of gold. ten Millions of gold and siluer. Howbeit they killed him notwithstanding, and in a night strangled him. But God the righteous Iudge, seeing this villainous act, suffered none of those Spaniards to die by the course of Nature, but brought them to euill and shamefull ends. During the time of Atabaliba's Gom.c.15. imprisonment, his Captaines had taken his Brother Guascar, who spake with Captaine Soto, and promised that if they would re∣store him to his libertie and to his Kingdome, he would fill vp the roome at Caximal∣ca to the roofe, which was thrice as much as Atabaliba had promised: and added, that his Father Guaynacapa on his death bed had commanded him to bee friend to the white and bearded men, which should come and rule in those parts. Atabaliba hea∣ring of these things, fained himselfe sorrowfull for the death of Guascar, whom he said Quisquiz his Captaine had slaine: this hee did to trie how the Spaniards would take his death, which when he saw they little respected, he sent and caused him to be slaine indeede. This was done in the yeare 1533. The Indians hereupon hid the treasures of gold, siluer, and gemmes, that were in Cusco and other places, and had belonged to Guaynacapa, which were farre more then euer came to the Spaniards hands.
The quarrell betweene these two brethren grew about their inheritance: Guascar succeeding his Father in the rest, and Quito being assigned to Atabaliba, who sei∣zing on Tumebamba, a rich Prouince, prouoked his brothers forces against him, who tooke him prisoner. But hee escaping to Quito, made the people beleeue that the Sunne had turned him into a Serpent, and so he escaped through a hole in the Prison: and on conceit of this miracle drew them into armes against Guascar, with which he made such slaughter of his enemies, that to this day there are great heapes of bones of the slaine: hee slew threescore thousand of the Canari, destroyed Tumebamba, and conquered as farre as Tumbez and Caximalca: he sent a great Armie with Quisquiez and Calicucima, two valiant Captaines, with such successe as you haue heard, against Guascar, whom they tooke, and by his direction slew. Gomara attributeth the death of Atabaliba to Philippilius the Spanish Interpreter, who to enioy one of his wiues, accused him of conspiracie against the Spaniards, but Benzo Benzo.l.3.c.5. with more likelyhood affirmeth, that Piçarro from his first taking had inten∣ded it. For he might haue sent him into Spaine as Atabaliba requested, if he had fea∣red such secret practises: but his request and purgation were reiected, and foure Ne∣gro's which hee vsed for that purpose, strangled him at his command. Hee had many wiues, whereof the chiefe was his Sister, named Pagha. He seeing the glasses of Eu∣rope, maruailed much that they hauing so faire a thing would goe so farre for gold. His Murtherers dyed, as is said, the like bloudy ends; Almagro was executed by Piçarro, and he slaine by yong Almagro; and him, Vacca de Castra did likewise put to death. Iohn Piçarro was slaine of the Indians. Martin an other of the Brethren was slaine with Francis. Ferdinandus was imprisoned in Spaine & his end vnknowne; Gonzales was done to death by Gasca Soto dyed of thought in Florida; and ciuill warres eate vp the rest in Peru. Before the times of the Ingua's, their Gouernement Acost.l.6.c.19.20.21.22. in these parts was (as still it is in Arauco, and the Prouinces of Chili) by Communalties, or the aduise of many. The Gouernement of the Ingua's continued betweene three and foure hundred yeares, although for a long time their Signiorie was not aboue fiue or six leagues compasse about the Citie of Cusco, where the originall of their Conquests beganne, and extended from Pasto to Chili, almost a thousand leagues in length betweene the Andes and the South Sea. The Canaries were their mortall enemies, and fauoured the Spaniards, and at this day if they fall to comparisons, whether the Ingua's or Canari were the more valiant, they will kill one another by thousands, as hath hapned in Cusco. The practise which they vsed to make themselues Lords, was a fiction, that since the generall Deluge (whereof all the Indians haue knowledge) the world had been preserued, peopled and restored by them: and that seuen of them came out of the Caue of Pacaricambo, and that they also were the Authors of the true Religion. The first of these Ingua's was Mangocapa, which came out of the Caue of Tambo, six leagues from Cusco. Of him came two Families, the Hanancusco, of whom came these Lords, and the Vrincusco. Ingaroca the first Lord was no great Lord, but was serued in Vessells of gold and sil∣uer. And dying, he appointed that all his treasure should be employed for the seruice of his body, and for the feeding of his Familie. His Successour did the like: and this grew to a generall custome, that no Ingua might inherit his Fathers goods, but he built a new Palace. In the time of Ingaroca, the Indians had Images of gold. Yaguaraguaque succee∣ded. Viracocha, the next successour was very rich. Gouzale Pizarro with cruell tor∣ments forced the Indians to confesse where his body was, for the report of the trea∣sures buried with him: the body he burnt, and the Indians reserued and worshipped the ashes. They tooke it ill that this Ingua called himselfe Viracocha, which is the name of thier God, but he to satisfie them, said, that Viracocha appeared to him in a dreame, and commanded him to take his name. Pachacuti Ingua Yupangus succeeded him, who was a great Conqueror, Polititian,
and Author of their ceremonies; hee reigned threescore and ten yeares, and fained himselfe sent of Viracocha to establish his Religion and Empire. After him followed Gnaynacapa, the Father of Guascar and Atabaliba, which brought this Empire to the greatest height. The Indians opened him after his de∣cease, leauing his heart and entrailes in Quito, the body was carryed to Cusco, and placed in the Temple of the Sunne. Hee was worshipped of his Subiects for a God being vet aliue, which was not done to any of his Predecessours. When he dyed, they slew a thousand persons of his houshold, to serue him in the other life, all which dyed willingly for his seruice, insomuch that many offered themselues to death, be∣sides such as were appointed. His treasure was admirable. He vsed alwaies Gom.c.120. to haue with him many Oregioni, which were his men of Warre, and ware shooes and fea∣thers, and other signes of Nobilitie: he was serued of the eldest Sonnes and Heires of all his chiefe Subiects, euery one clothed after his owne Countrie Rite; he had many Counsellours and Courtiers in differing degrees of honour. Euery one at his entrance into the Palace put off his shooes, and might not looke him in the face when they spake to him. All the Vessells of his House, Table, and Kitchin, were of gold and siluer, and the meanest, of siluer and copper for strength, and hardnesse of mettall. Hee had in his Wardrobe hollow Statues, which seemed Gyants, and were of gold: and the figures in proportion and bignesse of all the Beasts, Birds, Trees, and Hearbs, in his Kingdome, and of the Fishes likewise. Hee had Ropes, Budgets, Troughs, and Chests of Gold and Siluer: heapes of Billets of gold, that seemed Wood cut out for the fire. There was nothing in his Kingdome, but hee had the counterfeit in Gold. Yea they say, That the Ingua's had a Garden of pleasure in an Island neere Puna, which had all kinde of Garden-Hearbes, Flowers, and Trees of Gold and Siluer. Hee had also an infinite quantitie of Siluer and Gold wrought in Cusco, which was lost by the death of Guascar, which the Indians held (as is said) from the Spaniards. He had two hundred children of diuerse women. Acosta Acost.l.6.c.22.23. saith, That he had (descended from his owne loynes) aboue three hundred children and grand-children. When his sonnes Guascar and Atabaliba were dead, another of his sonnes, cal∣led Mangocapa, continued the Warres a while with the Spaniards, and after re∣tyred himselfe to Vilia Bamba, where he kept in the Mountaines, and there the Ingua's reigned, vntill Amaro was taken, and executed in Cusco. Some rem∣nants of them haue since beene christened. The other Familie of the Ingua's, which descended of the first Mangocapa, called Vrincusco, had their Successions also and Gouernment; which, here to discourse of, were to my proposed scope impertinent. Leauing therefore the Conquerours and Conquest of Peru, let vs consider the Countrey it selfe, with such obseruations as we shall there finde tou∣ching their Religions. CHAP. IX. Of the Countrie of Peru, Naturall, Occonomicall, and Politicall obseruations. THE Kingdome of Peru extendeth P.de Citea.part.1.c.36. seuen hundred leagues in length, in breadth a hundred in some places, in some threescore, in o∣thers fortie: more, or lesse, according vnto the difference of places. Quito and Plata are the vtmost Cities thereof, the one bordering on Popayan, the other vpon Chili. It is not heere meant of that spacious Kingdome of the Ingua's, for that reached
twelue hundred leagues, whereof this of Peru was but a part. Acosta Acost. libr.3. ca.20. numbreth di∣uerse strange specialties, excepted from the generall Rules of Natures wonted course. The first, that it blowes continually on all that coast with one onely winde (and, that also differing from that which vsually bloweth betweene the Tropikes) namely, the South and Southwest. The second, that this winde (in other places vnhealthfull) is heer so agreeable, that otherwise it could not be habitable. The third, that it ne∣uer raines, thunders, snowes, nor hailes in all this coast: And yet (which is a fourth wonder) a little distance from the coast, it snowes and raines terribly. Fifthly, there are two ridges and mountaines, which both runne in one altitude; and the one in view of the other, almost equally, aboue a thousand leagues: and yet on the one part are great forrests, and it raines the greatest part of the yeare, beeing very hote; the other is all naked, and bare, and verie colde. So that Peru is diuided into three parts, which they call Llanos, Sierras, and Andes: the first ranne alongst the Sea∣coast; the Sierras be hilles with some vallies, and the Andes bee steepe and craggie mountaines. The Llanos or Plaines on the Sea-coast haue tenne leagues in breadth, in some parts lesse, and in some a little more. The Sierra containeth with equall inequa∣litie twenty leagues: and the Andes as much, sometimes more, and sometimes lesse. They runne in length from North to South, and in breadth from East to West: and in this so small a distance it raines almost continually in one place, and neuer in the other. In the Plaines neuer, on the Andes in a manner continually, though some times it be more cleare there then other. The Sierra in the middes are more moderate, in which it raines from September to Aprill, as in Spaine, but in the other halfe yeare, when the Sunne is further off, it is more cleare. The Sierras yeelde infinite number of Vicagues, which are like wilde Goates; and Pacos, a kinde of sheepeasses, profitable for fleece and burthen: the Andes yeelde Parrots, Apes, and Monkies. Some Botero. report that mon∣strous births doe sometimes proceede (as by Natures vnwilling hand) from the copu∣lation of these Barbarians and these Monkies. The Sierre opening themselues, cause vallies, where are the best dwellings in Peru, and most plentifull of Maiz and Fruits. It is strange Cieza.pa.1 ca.72. that in the valley of Pachacama, neither the higher Element yeeldeth raine, nor the lower any streame, and yet there is plenty of rootes, Maiz, and fruits. They haue large and deepe ditches, in which they sowe or set, and that which grow∣eth is nourished with the deaw: and because the Maiz will not grow, except it first die, they set one or two Pilchards heads (which fish they take with their Nettes verie plentifully in the Sea) therewith, and thus it groweth aboundantly. The wa∣ter which they drinke, they drawe out of deepe pittes. Acost.libr.3. ca.21. Comming from the Moun∣taines to the Vallies they doe vsually see (as it were) two Heauens, one cleare and bright, the other, obscure, and (as it were) a grey vaile spread vnderneath, which couers all the coast: and although it raines not, yet this mist is wonderfull profi∣table to bring foorth grasse, and to raise vp and nourish the seede; and where they haue plentie of water, which they draw from the Pooles and Lakes, yet if this moy∣sture faileth, there followeth great defect of graine. And (which is more worthie of admiration) the drie and barren sands in some places, as in the sandie Mountaine neare the Citie de Loy Reges, are by this deaw beautified with grasse and flowers. Insome places they water their fields out of the riuers. Beyond the Citie of Cusco the two ridges of Mountaines separate themselues, and in the middest leaue a plaine and large champaine, which they call the Province of Cal∣lao, where there are many Rivers, and great store of fertile Pastures. There Acost.ibi.c.16. Cieza p.1.c.103. is al∣so the great Lake of Titicaca, which containeth foure score leagues in compasse, and robbeth tenne or twelue great riuers of their waters, which they were carrying to the Sea, but heere are drunke vp (by the way) of this Lake. They saile in it with shippes and barques: The Water is not altogether sowre nor salt, as that of the Sea, but is so thicke, that it can not bee drunke. Vpon the Bankes of this Lake are Habitations as good as anie in Peru. The great Lake passeth by a Riuer into a lesse Lake called Aulagas, from whence it hath no manner of passage, except
there be any vnder the earth. There are many other Lakes in the Mountaines, which seeme to arise rather from Springs then from Raines or Snowes, and some of them yeeld Riuers. At the end of the Vallie of Tarapaya neare to Potozi, there is a round Lake, whose water is very hot, and yet the Countrie is very cold: they bathe them∣selues neare the bankes, for further in, it is intolerable. In the middest is a boyling aboue twentie foot square: it neuer encreaseth nor decreaseth, although they haue drawne from it a great streame for mettall-mills. But to returne from this plentie of water in lakes to that want thereof in the plaines of Peru. The Naturall reason which some yeeld of this want of Raine, is, partly their sandie and drie qualitie, which of themselues can yeeld no further exhalations, then to produce those mists or dewes: partly the height of the Hills, which shadow the plaines, and suffer no winde to blow from the Land vpon them, but intercept them wholly with their vapours and clouds; so that their winde is only from the Sea, which finding no opposite, doth not presse nor straine forth the vapours which rise to engender raine. This seemeth the rather to bee probable, for that it raines vpon some small Hills along the coast which are least shadowed. In the same coast also, where the Easterly or Northerly windes bee ordinarie, it raineth as in Guayaquill. The South winde in other places is Tells Nubi∣bus assiduis plu∣tia{que}, madl cit ab A.stro. Ouid. accompted a causer of raine, which here reigneth without rayning. As strange is the difference of seasons, after the Indians accompt. For in the Cieza, c.59. Sterras their Sommer beginneth in Aprill, and endeth with September: October beginneth their Winter, which not the absence, but the presence of the Sunne doth cause. Contrarywise in the Plaines, iust by in site, they haue their Sommer from Octo∣ber to Aprill, the rest their Winter. The raines in the Hills are cause why they call it Winter, and the dewes or mists in the Plaines, so that when the raines fall most in the Hills, it is cleare weather in the Plaines, and when the dew falleth in the Plaines, it is cleare on the Hills: and thus it commeth to passe, that a man may trauell from Winter to Sommer in one day, ha∣uing Winter to wash him in the morning, and ere night a cleare and drie Sommer to scorch him. About the point of St. Helena in Peru, they Cieza.c.25. tell that sometimes there liued Gy∣ants of huge stature, which came thither in Boats, the compasse of their knee was as much as of another mans middle: they were hated of the people, because that vsing their women they killed them, and did the same to the men for other causes The like doth Apollodorus, & the Poets tell of Trphon, and other Gyants. Ap.de Dcor. O∣rig.l.1.& Hygi∣nus, sab 152. . These Gyants were addicted to Sodomie, and therefore, as the Indians report, were destroy∣ed with fire from heauen. Whether this bee true or no, in those parts are found huge and Gyantlike bones. Contrarywise, in the Valley of Chincha Cieza c.74. they haue a Tradition, that the Progenitors of the present Inhabitants destroied the natiue people, which were not aboue two cubits high, and possessed their roomes: in testimonie whereof they alleage also that bone-argument. Concerning the Indians conceit of their owne originall: we haue mentioned their opinion of a floud, and the repeopling of the World by them, which came out of a Caue Acost.l.1.c.25 . They haue an other Legend that all men being drowned, there came out of the great Lake Titicaca, one Viracocha, which stayed in Tiaguanaco, where at this day is to be seene the ruines of very ancient and strange buildings, and from thence came to Cusco, and so beganne mankinde to multiply. They shew in the same Lake a small Iland, where they faine that the Sunne hid himselfe, and so was preserued Cieza, pag.1. cap.103. : and for this reason they make great sacrifices vnto him in this place, both of sheepe and men. They held this place sacred, and the Inguas built there a Temple to the Sunne, and placed there women and Priests with great treasures. Some Acost.ibid. learned men are of opinion, that all which the Indians make mention of is not aboue foure hundred yeares; which may be imputed to their want of writing. In stead of writing they vsed their Quipos Ac.l.6.c.8. . These Quippos are memorialls or registers made of cords, in which there are diuers knots and colours, signifying diuers things:
these were their bookes of Histories, of lawes, ceremonies, and accounts of there affaires. There were officers appointed to keepe them called Quipocamayos, which were bound to giue account of things as Notaries, and Registers. They had accor∣ding to the diuersitie of businesse, sundry cords and branches, in euery of which were so many knotts little and great, and strings tyed to them, some red, some greene, and in such varietie, that euen as we deriue an infinite number of words from the let∣ters of the Alphabet, so doe they from these kindes and colours, And at this day they will keepe account exactly of them. I did see (saith Acosta) a handfull of these strings, wherein an Indian woman did carry (as it were) written a generall confessi∣on of all her life, and thereby confessed her selfe, as well as I could haue done in written paper, with strings for the circumstances of the sinnes. They haue also cer∣taine wheeles of small stones, by meanes whereof they learne all they desire, by heart. Thus you shall see them learne the Paternoster, Creede, and the rest: and for this pur∣pose they haue many of these wheeles in their Churchyardes. They haue another kinde of Quippos, with graines of Mays, with which they will cast vp hard ac∣counts which might trouble a good Arithmetician with his pen in the diuisions. They were no lesse wittie, Id.lbid.c.16. if not more, in things whereto they apply themselues then the men of these parts. They taught their young Children all Artes necessarie to the life of men, euery one learning what was needefull for his person and fami∣ly, and not appropriating himselfe to one profession, as with vs, one is a Tailer, an other a Weauer, or of other trade. Euery man was his owne Weauer, Carpenter, Husbandman, and the like. But in other Artes, more for ornament then necessitie, they had Gold-Smithes, Painters, Potters, and Weauers of curious vvorkes for Noble men, and so of the rest. No man might change the fashion vsed in his owne countrey, when he went into another, that all might be knowne of what coun∣trey they were. For their marriages, they had many wiues but one was principall, which was wed∣ded with solemnitie, and than this sort. The Bridegroome went to the Brides house and put Ottoya, which was an open shooe, on her foote: this, if she were a Maide, was of Wooll, otherwise, of Reedes: and this done, hee led her thence with him. If shee committed Adulterie, she was punished with death; when the husband died she carried a mourning weede of black a yeare after, & might not marry in that time which befell not the other Wiues. The Ingua himselfe with his owne hand gaue this wo∣man to his Gouernours and Captaines, and the Gouernours assembled all the yong men and Maides in one place of the Citie, where they gaue to euery one his Wife, with the aforesaid ceremonie in putting on the Ottoya: the other wiues did serue and honour this. None might marry with his Mother, Daughter, Grandmother or Grand-childe: and Yupangui, the Father of Gnaynacapa was the first Ingua that marri∣ed his Sister, and confirmed his fact by a decree, that the Inguas might doe it, com∣manding his owne children to doe it, permitting the Noble men also to marrie their Sisters by the Fathers side. Other incest, and murther, Theft, and Adulterie were pu∣nished with death. Such as had done good seruice in warre were rewarded vvith lands, armes, titles of honour, and marriage in the Inguas linage. They had Chasquis or Posts in Peru, which were to carry tidings or Letters: for which purpose they had houses a league and a halfe a funder, and running each man to the next, they would runne fiftie leagues in a day and night. When the Ingua was dead, his lawfull heire borne of his chiefe wife succee∣ded. And if the King had a legitimate brother, shee first inherited, and then the sonne of the first. He inherited not the goods (as is said alreadie) but they were wholly dedicated to his Oratorie or Guaca, and for the entertainment of the Family he left: which, with his off-spring, was alway busied at the sacrifices, ceremonies, and seruice of the deceased King: for being dead, they presently held him for a God, making i∣mages and sacrifices to him. The Ensigne of royalty was a red rowle of Wooll fi∣ner then silke, which hung on his forehead, which was as a diademe that none else
might weare in the midst of their forehead; at their eare the Noble-men might. When they tooke this roll, they made their Coronation feast, and many sacrifices with a great quantitie of Vessell, of Gold, and Siluer, and many Images in the forme of Sheepe of gold and siluer, and a thousand others of diuers colours. Then the chiefe Priest tooke a yong child in his hand of the age of six or eight yeares, pronouncing these words with the other Ministers to the Image of Viracocha; Lord, we offer this vn∣to thee, that thou mayest maintayne vs in quiet, and helpe vs in our warres: maintaine our Lord the Ingua in his Greatnesse and Estate, that hee may alway increase, giuing him much knowledge to gouerne vs. There were present at this ceremonie, men of all parts of the Realme, and of all Guacas and Sanctuaries. It is not found that any of the Inguas subiects euer committed treason against him. Hee placed Gouernours in euery Prouince, some greater, and some smaller. The Inguas thought it a good Rule of state to keepe their Subiects alway in action, and therefore there are seene to this y long Causeis of great labour, diuiding this large Empire into foure parts. Hauing conquered a Prouince, they presently reduced them into Townes, and Commonalties, which were diuided into Bands: one was appointed ouer ten, an o∣ther ouer a hundred, and an other ouer a thousand, and ouer ten thousand an other. Aboue all there was in euery Prouince a Gouernour of the house of the Inguas, to whom the rest gaue accompts of what had passed, who were either Borne or Dead. At the feast called Raymer, the Gouernours brought the Tribute of the whole Realme to the Court at Cusco. All the Kingdome Cicza, pag.1.cap.92. was diuided into foure parts, Chincha∣suyo, Coasuyo, Andesuyo, and Condesuyo, according to the foure wayes which went from usco, East, West, North, and South. When Acost.i.6.c.15. e Ingua conquered a Citie, the Land was diuided into three Parts, the first for Religion, euery Idoll and Guaca hauing his peculiar Lands appropriated to their Priests and Sacrifices; and the greatest part thereof was spent in Cusco, where was the General and Metropolitan Sanctuarie, the rest in that Citie where it was ga∣thered, which a had Guacas, after the fashion of Cusco, some being thence distant two hundred leagues. That which they reapt on the Land was put into Store-houses built for that purpose. The second part of that diuision was for the Ingua for the maintenance of his Court, Kinsmen, Noblemen, and Souldiers: which they brought to Cusco, or other places where it was needfull. The third part was for the Comminaltie for the nourishment of the people, no par∣ticular man possessing any part hereof in proper. As the Familie encreased or de∣creased, so did the portion. Their Tribute was to till and husband the Lands of the Ingua, and the Guacas, and lay it vp in store-houses, being for that time of their la∣bour nourished out of the same Lands. The like distribution wa made of the Cattell to the same purposes, as that of the lands, and of the wooll, & other profits that thence arose. The old Men, Women, and sick Folks, were reserued from this Tribute. They paied other Tributes also, euen whatsoeuer the Ingua would choose out of euery Pro∣uince. The Chicas sent sweet woods; the Lucanas, Brancars to carrie his litter; the Chumtilbicas, Dancers: others were appointed to labour in the Mines: and all were slaues to the Ingua. Some he employed in building of Temples, Fortresses, Houses, or other works, as appeareth by the remnants of them, where are found stones of such greatnesse that men cannot conceiue how they were cut, brought, and laied in their places, they hauing no yron or steele to cut, engines to carrie, nor morter to lay them: and yet they were so cunningly laied that one could not see the ioynts; some of eight and thirtie foot long, saith Acosta, eight broade, and six thick, I measured, and in the walls of Cusco are bigger. They built a Bridge at Chiquitto, the Riuer being so deepe, that it will not admit Arches: they fastned bundles of reedes and weeds, which being light, will not sinke, which they fasten to either side of the Riuer, they make it passable for man and beast: it is three hundred foot long. Cusco Gom.c.124. their chiefe Citie standeth in seuenteen degrees:
it is subiect to cold and snow, the houses are of great and square stone. It was besieged by Soto, and by Pizarro and him entred, where they found more treasure then they had by the imprisonment of Atabaliba: Quito Gom.c.125.126 is said to haue beene as rich as Cusco. Hi∣ther Ruminagui fled with fiue thousand Souldiours, when Atabaliba his Mr. was taken by the Spaniards, and slew Illeseas his brother, that withstood his tyrannicall procee∣dings, flaied him, & made a Drum of his skin; slew two thousand souldiors that brought the body of Atabaliba to Quito to be interred, hauing in shew of Funerall pompe & ho∣nour, before, made them drunke; and with his forces scoured the Prouince of Tame∣bamba: he killed many of his wiues for smiling when hee told them they should haue pleasure with the bearded men, and burnt the Wardrobe of Atabaliba: that when the Spaniards came and entred Quito, which had almost dispeopled Panama, Nicaragua, Cartagna and other their habitations in hope of Peruvian spoiles, they found them∣selues disappointed of their expected prey, and in anger set fire on the towne. Aluarado with like newes came from Guatimala into those parts, with 400, Spaniards, but was forced to kill his horse to feede his farnished company (although at that time horses were worth in Peru aboue 1000.ducats a peece) was almost killed with thrist, was assaul∣ted Not far from Lima, on the South Sea, Oli∣uer Noort was bemisted two dayes on the Sea, with such a shower of Ashes, which made them seeme as they had been sprin∣kled with Meale. The Spaniards say they are there common. with showers of Ashes, which the hote Vulcane of Quito dispersed 240. miles a∣bout, (with terrible Thunders, and lightnings, which Pluto had seemed to steale from Iupiter, & here to vent them) and after with snowes on the cold hills, which exacted 70. Spaniards for tribute in the passage, found many men sacrificed by the inhabitants, but could finde no gold, till Pizarro bought his departure with 100000. ducats. He gaue, thankes (he said) to God for his deliuerance, but that tract, by which hee had passed, to the Diuell. This was he that afterward being bruised with the fall of his horse, (whereof he died) & asked where he was most pained, Benzo l.2.c.17. said, in his soule, as guilty to himselfe of his former cruelties & couetousnes. Let vs adde one thing more (added perhaps & more somewhat then truth) of the riches of these parts. Francis Xeres F Xeres ap. Ortel. Theat. writeth that in Cusco there were houses, whose floores, walles, and roose were couered with plates of golde. Giraua saith, that the inhabitants of Anzerma, were in their warres armed with cōplete harnesse of Gold: and that about Quito there were mines, whence more gold was taken then earth. I tye no mans credit to these reports, but sure it is, that they had these met∣tals in abundance, which the Spanish warres haue made our Europaean world to feele, more managed and maintained by Indian wedges, then Spanish blades. But let vs come from their Mines, to their Mindes, which for heauenly things were as full of drosse, as the other were of purer metalls. CHAP. X. Of the Gods or Idols of Peru, and other their opinions. THe Peruuians acknowledged a supreme Lord and Author of all things, Acost.l.5.c.3. which they called Viracocha, and gaue him names of great excellence, as, Pachacamac, or Pachayachachic, which is, the Creator of Heauen and Earth, and Vsapu, that is, admirable, and other the like. Him they did worship as the chiefest of all, and honoured him in beholding the heauens. Yet had No name in the Cuscan or Mexican tongues to sig∣nifie God. they no proper name for God no more then the Mexicans, but such as in this sort might signifie him by his attributes or workes, & ther∣fore are forced to vse the Spanish name Dios. In the name of Pachacamac, or Creator, they had a rich Temple erected to him, wherein they worshipped notwithstanding the Diuell and certaine figures. The name of Viracocha was of the greatest sound in their deuotions, and so they called the Spaniards, esteeming them the sonnes of heauen. Benzo Benzo l.3.c.21 alledgeth another cause of that name giuen to the Spaniards. It signifi∣eth (saith hee) the froth of the Sea, (Vira is forth, Cochie the Sea) because they thought them ingendered of Sea-froth and nourished therewith, in regard of co∣uetousnesse and cruelty deuouring all things: applying that name to them in re∣spect of their vvicked practises, and not for Diuine Originall. Yea, they curse
the Sea, which sene such a cursed broode into the land. (The Spaniards came thither by Sea, as you haue heard.) If I, saith Benzo, asked any of them for any Christian by that Title, they would neither looke on me nor answere, but if I enquired for them by the name of Viracochie, they would presently make answere. And there (would the father point to the Childe) goes a Viracochie. To reconcile these two wholly, is impossible; not so, to shew some reason why the same name might be giuen both to their Idoll, and the Spaniards. These might be so termed, as comming thither at first by Sea: and haply because at the first they thought somewhat more then humane to be in them, and that which at first they gaue for ho∣snour may now be continued in an Ironie, or Antiphrasis, whiles they thought them better then men, and found them little inferiour to Diuels. Viracocha their great Author of Nature, may be called by this Sea-name, See cap.12. for some especiall, Sea-rites obserued in his honour, or for the same cause that the Mythologians ascribe to Venus her Sea-generation. For they pictured Venus swimming on the Sea (as Albricus de Imag.dcorum. Albricus affirmeth) and the Poet singeth, Venus, Orta Mari: which the Mytholo∣gians apply to the motion and moisture required to generation, and to that frothie nature of the Sperme. So saith Phrnutus: Phrnuti de Nat. dier. Spe∣culum. Venus a Mari nata perhibetur quód ad omni∣um generationis cansa motu & humiditate pus sit; Et fortè quòd spusa fit animanti∣um semina: therefore (saith Fulgentii My∣tholog.l.2. Fulgentius) she is called Aphrodite: for  is froth, and so is Iust in regard of the vanitie: and so is seed, in regard of naturall qualitie. Perhaps also the first Maister of Virarochas Mysteries, which taught them first in Peru, came thi∣ther by Sea. But to returne to Acosta, Ac.l.6.c.21. he telleth that the Ingua Yupangui (to make himselfe more respected) deuised, that being one day alone. Viracocha the Creator spake to him, complaining, that though he were vniuersall Lord and Creator of all things, and had made the Heauen, the Sunne, the World, and Men, and ruled all, yet they did not yeeld him due Obedience, but did equally honour the Sunne, Thunder, Earth, and other things: giuing him to vnderstand, that in Heauen where he was, they called him Viracacha Pachayachachia, which signifieth vniuersall Creator: promising also that he would send men inuisibly to assist him agaïnst the Changuas, who had lately defea∣ted his brother. Vnder this colour, he assembled a mighty armie, and ouerthrew the Changuas: and from that time commanded that Viracocha should be held for vniuersall Lord, and that the images of the Sunne and Thunder should doe him reuerence. And from that time they set his image highest: yet did he not dedicate any thing to him, So haue some reasoned In Templis quid facit aurum? Pers. saying, that he being Lord of all had no neede. As for those inuisible Souldiours (a conceit like that which wee haue mentioned of the Turkes) hee said that no man might see them but himselfe: and since they were conuerted into stones: and in that regard gathered a multitude of stones in the mountaines, and placed them for Idols, sacrificing to them. He called them Pururancas, and carried them to the warres with great deuotion, ma∣king his souldiours beleeue, that they had gotten the victorie through their help. And by this meanes he obtained goodly victories. Next to Viracocha they worshipped the Sunne: and after him the Thunder, which they called by three names, Chuquilla, Catuilla, and Intijllapa, supposing it to be a man in heauen with a Sling and a Mace, in whose power it is to cause Raine, Haile, Thun∣der and other effects of the aery Region. This Guaca (so they called their Idols) was Generall to all the Indians of Peru: and in Cusco they sacrificed to him Children, as they did to the Sunne. These three, Vira∣cocha, the Sunne, and Thunder, had a more especiall worship then the rest: they put as it were a Gantles or Glone vpon their hands, when they lifted them vp to worshippe them. They worshipped the earth in the name of Pachaaa, & esteemed her the Mo∣ther of all things: the Sea also, and called in Mamacocha: and the Raine-bow, which with two Snakes stretched out on each side, were the armes of the Ingas. They attri∣buted diuers offices, to diuers Starres, and those which needed their fauour worship∣ped them: so the Shepheard sacrificed to a Starre, by them called Vrcuchillay, which
they hold to be a sheepe of diuers colours, and two others starres called Catuchillay and Vrcuchillay, which they fained to be and Ewe and a Lambe. Others worshipped a starre which they name Machacuay, to which they attributed the power ouer Snakes and Serpents, to keepe them from hurting them. To another Starre called Chug inchinchy (which is as much as Tigre) they ascribed power ouer Beares, Tigres, and Lyons. They haue generally beleeued that of all the beasts in the earth, there is one like vnto them in heauen, which hath care of their procreation and increase. Many other Starres they worshipped, too tedious to rehearse. They worshipped also Riuers, Fountaines, the mouthes of Riuers, entries of mountaines, Rockes or great stones, Hills, and the tops of mountaines, which they call Apachitas. They worshipped all things in Nature, which seemed to them remarkeable and different from the rest. They shewed me, (it is Acostas speech) in Cazamalca, a Hill or Mount of sand, which was a chiefe Idoll or Guaca of the ancients. I demanded what Diuinitie they found in it; they alledged the wonder, it beeing a high mount of Sand in the middest of the thicke mountaines of stone. In the Citie de los Reyes, for the melting of a Bell, we cut downe a great deformed Tree, which for the greatnes and Antiquitie thereof had been their Guaca. They attributed the like diuinitie to any thing that was strange in this kinde, as stones, or the Rootes Papas & Lallatrecas (which they kissed & worshipped) Beares also, Lions, Tigres and Snakes, that they should not hurt them. And such as their Gods be, such are the things which they offer vnto them in their worship. They haue vsed, as they goe by the way, to cast in the crosse-waies on the hilles and topps of mountaines, old shooes, Feathers, and Coca chewed. And when they had nothing else, they cast a sloue as an offering, that they might passe freely and lustily; hence it is, that they finde in the high-waies great heapes of stones offered, and such other things. They vsed the like ridiculous offering in pulling off their haires of the eye-browes to offer to the Sunne, hills, windes, or any other thing which they feare. They report of one of the Inguas that said he did not take the Sun to be a God, because he laboureth so much in his daily iourney. In fine, Ac.l.5.c.5. euery one worshipped what liked him best. The Fishers worshipped a Sharke or some other Fish: the Hunter, a Lyon, Foxe, or other Beast, with many birds; the country-man, the water, and Earth. Gom.c.121. They beleeued that the Moone was Wife to the Sunne: when they sweare they touch the earth, and looke vp to the Sunne. Many of their Idols had Pastorall staues and Miters like Bishops, but the Indians could tell no reason thereof: and when they saw the Spanish Bishops in their Pontificalibus, they asked if they were Guacas of the Christians. They worshipped also (as before is said) the dead bodies of the Inguas, prefer∣uing them with certaine Rosin, so that they seemed aliue. The body of Yupangui, the Grandfather of Atabaliba, was thus found, hauing eyes made of a fine cloth of Golde so Artificially set, as they seemed naturall, hauing lost no more haire then if hee had died the same day, and yet hee had beene dead threescore and eighteene yeares. There also the Spaniards found his seruants and Mamacomas, which did seruice to his memorie. In some Prouince Cieza.c.50. they worshipped the image of a Bull, in an other of a Cocke, and in other, others. In the principall Temple of Pachicama; they kept a she∣Foxe and worshipped it. The Lord of Manta kept a great and rich Emerald, as his ancestors also before him had holden it, in great veneration: on some daies it vvas brought forth in publike to be worshipped. They which were sicke came in Pilgri∣mage to visit it, and there offered their gifts, which the Cacique and Ministers turned to their owne profit. The Diuell in many places did appeare vnto them, and he indeed was Author of all these superstitions. They haue a Tradition concerning the Creation, Gom. hist. gen.c.122. Apollon.l.. that at the beginning of the world there came one from the North, into their countrey, called Con, which had no bones, went very light and swift, cast downe mountaines, lift vp the hilles, onley with his will and word: He said he was the sonne of the Sunne, and filled the earth with men and women which they created, giuing them fruits and bread & other things necessarie for humane life. But being offended with some, he countermanded
that former good, and turned the fruitfull lands into barren sands, as they are now in the Plaines, and tooke away the water that it should not raine (hence it came that there it raines not) onely leauing them the Riuers, of pure compassion, that they should maintaine themselues with labour. Afterwards Calueto in Benz. l.3.c.2. came another from the South, called Pachicama, the sonne also of the Sunne and Moone, who banished Con, and turned his men into Cats, Monkeyes, Beares, Lyons, Parrats, and other Birdes, and created the Progenitors of the present Indians, and taught them to husband the earth and the Trees. They againe to gratifie him, turned him in their imaginations and superstitions vnto a God, and named the prouince foure leagues from Lima of his name. Hee Cieza c.72. continued till the Christians came to Peru. Hee was their great O∣racle, and as some Indians affirme, hee still continueth in secret places with some of their old men and speaketh to them. Of this Temple we shall after speake. They hold opinion Gom. vbi sup. also, that on a time it rained so exceedingly, that it drow∣ned all the lower Countries, and all men, saue a few, which got into caues vpon high hilles vvhere they shutte vp themselues close, that no raine could get in: there they had stored much prouision and liuing creatures. And when they perceiued that it it had done raining, they sent forth two Dogges, but they returning all myrie and foule, they knew that the waters had not yet ceased: after that they sent forth more Dogges, which came backe againe dry. Then did they goe forth to people the Earth: but were mightily afflicted with multitudes of great Serpents which had sprung vp out of those mirie Reliques of the Floud: This is like Ouids tale of Pythn, &c.Met.1. but at last they killed them. They beleeue also that the world shall haue an end, but before the same shall goe a great drought, and the Sunne and Moone, which they vvorship, shall bee consumed: and therefore they make greeuous lamentations when there is any Eclipse, especially of the Sunne, fearing the destruction of it and the world. They beleeue the immorta∣litie of the soule, as wee shall more fitly see when vvee come to their Buriall∣rites. CHAP. XI. Of the Religious Persons, Temples, Confessions, and sacrifices in Peru. NO man might come to the Guacas or Idolls but Priests. These were clothed in white, and when they came to worship, they pro∣strated Apoll.l.. themselues on the ground, and holding in their hands a white cloth, did speake to their God in a strange language, that the peo∣ple should not vnderstand. These haue the authoritie in their ho∣lies, and consecrate both the things liuing, and the offerings of other things. In the sacrifices they diuined by inspection of the inward parts, especially by view of the heart, if it were of a man. And if they finde not signes answerable to their expectation, they neuer cease off from sacrificing till they doe finde them, be∣leeuing, and making the people beleeue, that God is not till then pleased with their sacrifices. They bare incredible shew, and were had in great reputation, of holines. When they were to sacrifice they abstained from women, and if they had committed any trespasse, they did expiate and purge the same with fasting: in sacrificing they did binde, and blinde their eyes, and were sometimes so transported with Zeale, that with their nailes they scratched or pulled out their eyes, as hath beene seene. Nei∣ther did the people alone admire their holinesse, but the Princes also, who would doe nothing of moment without their aduise. They also without feare or flatterie, decla∣red vnto them what they had receiued from their Oracles. The manner of their diuell
consultation was this. In Acost.l.5.c.12. the night time (commonly) they entred backeward to their Idoll, and so went bending their bodies and heads after an vgly manner, and thus consulted with him. The answere hee made was for the most part like vnto a fearefull hissing, or to a gnashing, which did terrifie them. These Oracles are now ceased. Apollonius speakes of two mighty Princes, Leu.Apol.l.1. not farre from Chili, one of them na∣med Lychengorme, they are able to bring into the field two hundred thousand men, and are very rich: but the cause why I heere mention them is that number of Priests which he saith are reported to belong to one of their Temples to the number of two thousand. In euery Prouince of Peru, there was one principall house of adoration. The ru∣ines Gom.c.121. of the Temple of Pachacama are still to bee seene. That, and the Temples of Colia, and Cusco were lined within with Plates of Gold and Siluer, and all their ser∣uice was of the same, which proued great riches to the conquerours. In Pachacama the Sunne was worshipped with great deuotion. There were kept in the same ma∣ny Virgins. Francis Pizarro Cieza.c.72. sent his brother Hernando (when he had taken Ataba∣liba) to spoile this Temple, but the Priestes and chiefe men had carried away a∣boue foure hundred burthens of Gold before he came, and none doth know vvhat became of it. Yet did he finde there some quantitie of Golde and Siluer remaining. They sacked the Sepulchers also, and thence drew abundance of the said mettals. From that time hitherto, the Temple went to ruine. The Temple of Cusco Acost.l.5.c.12. was very sumptuous, the pauement and Stones yet re∣maine witnesses of the auncient splendor and magnificence. This Temple vvas like to the Pantheo of the Romanes: for that it was the house and dwelling of all the Gods. For the Inguas did there behold the Gods of all the Nations and Prouin∣ces they had conquered, euery Idoll hauing his proper place, whither they of that Prouince came to worship it, with excessiue charge for the same. And thereby they supposed to keepe safely in obedience those Prouinces which they had con∣quered, holding their Gods as it were in hostage. In this house was the Pincha, which was an Idoll of the Sunne, of most fine Golde wrought with great riches of Stones, the which was placed to the East with so great Arte, as the Sunne at his rising did east his beames thereon, which reflected vvith such brightnes, that it seemed another Sunne, They say that at the spoile of this Temple, a Souldiour had for his part this goodly Pincha, and lost the same in a night at play, whence grew a prouerbe of Gamesters in Peru, They play the Sunne before sunne-rising. In some parts of Peru, Cieza.c.64. as at Old Port and Puna, they vsed the detestable sinne against Nature: yes, the Diuell so farre preuailed in their beastly deuotions, that there were boyes consecrated to serue in the Temple; and at the times of their sacrifices and solemne Feastes, the Lordes and principall men abused them to that detesta∣ble filthinesse. And generally in the hill-countries the Diuell vnder shew of holi∣nesse had brought in that Vice. Euery Temple or principall house of adoration kept one man or two or more, which went attired like women, euen from the time of their childehood and spake like them, lmitating them in euery thing. Vn∣der Tantum Reli∣gio potuit suade∣re malorum. pretext of holinesse and Religion, their principall men, on principall daies, had that hellish commerce. A Frier dealt with two of these Ganimedes, about the filthinesse of this Vice, and they answered that they held it no fault; for from their childehood they had beene placed there by their Caciques, both for that employment, as also to be Priests and to keep the Temple. Thus farre had they banished Nature, to entertaine Religion, and thus farre had they exiled the soule of Religion, re∣taining onely a stinking carkaffe. At Ganada in Cieza c.77. & 80. in Caimalca the Inguas built a Temple in honour of the Sunne. There were Virgins kept which intended nothing but to weaue, and Spinne, and Dye clothes, for their Idolatrous seruices. The like was in other pla∣ces. In Guanuco vvas a stately pallace of great stones, and a Temple of the Sunne
adioining, with a number of Virgins and Ministers, which had thirtie thousand In∣dians for the seruice thereof. The seruice vvhich most of them did is like to bee the tilling of the ground, feeding of Cattell, and such like before mentioned, which they were bound to doe for the Inguas, and also for the Guacas, that is, Idols, and Idoll-houses. But it were a wearisome Pilgrimage to goe and leade my Reader with me, to euery of their Temples, which for the most part had the same rites, according to that proportion of maintenance which belonged to them. Gomara Gom.c.121. reporteth that their houses of women were as Cloisters or Monasteries, enclosed, that they might neuer goe forth. They guelded men, which should attend on them, cutting off also their noses, and lippes, that they should haue no such appetite. It was death for any to be found false and incontinent. The men that entred in to them were hanged vp by the feete. These made robes for the Idols, and burned the ouerplus with the bones of white sheepe, and hurled the Ashes into the aire towards the Sunne. If they proued with child, and sware that Pachacama did it, the issue was preserued. Of these Monasteries or Nunneries thus writeth Acosta. There were in Peru, many Monasteries of Virgins, Acost..1.5.c.15. but not any for men (except for their Priests and Sorcerers) at the least one in euery Prouince. In these were two sorts of women; one ancient, which they called Mamacomas, for the instruction of the yong; the other of yong Maidens, placed there for a certaine time, after which they were drawne forth, either for the Gods, or for the Ingua. They called this house or Monasterie Aelaguagi, that is, the house of the chosen. Euery Monasterie had his Vicar, or Gouernour, called Appopana∣ca, who had libertie to choose whom he pleased, of what qualitie soeuer, being vnder eight yeares of Age, if they seemed to be of a good stature and constitution. The Ma∣macomas instructed these Virgins in diuers things needfull for the life of man, and in the customes & ceremonies of their Gods. Afterwards they tooke them from thence, being aboue fourteene, sending them to the Court with sure guards, whereof some were appointed to serue the Idols, & Idoll∣Temples, keeping their Virginitie for euer: some other were for ordinarie sacrifices that were made of Maidens, and other extraordinarie sacrifices, they made for the health, death, or warres of the Inguas: and the rest serued for Wiues and Concubines to the Ingua, or such as he gaue thē to. This distribution was renewed euery yeare. These Mo∣nasteries possessed rents, for the maintenance of these Virgins. No Father might refuse his daughter, if the Appopanaca required her: yea, many fathers did willingly offer their Daughters, supposing it was a great merit to be sacrificed for the Ingua. If any of these Mamacomas or The yong Virgin∣Nunnes. Aellas were found to haue trespassed against their honor, it was an in∣cuitable chastisement to bury them aliue, or to put them to death, by some other cruell torment. The Inguas allowed a kinde Acost.l.5.c.26. Sorcerers. of Sorcerers or Sooth-sayers, which (they say) tooke vpon them what forme and figure they pleased, flying farre through the ayre in a short time. They talke with the Diuell, who answereth them in certaine stones, or other things, which they reuerence much. They tell what hath passed in the furthest parts, before newes can come. In the distance of two or three hundred leagues, they would tell what the Spaniards did or suffered in their ciuill warres. To worke this diuination, they shut themselues into a house and became drunke, till they lost their senses: a day after, they answered to that which was demanded. Some affirme they vse certaine vnctions. The Indians say that the old women doe commonly vse this office of Witch-craft, especially in some places. They tell of things stolen or lost. The A∣naconas (which are the seruants of the Spaniards) consult with them, and they make answere, hauing first spoken with the Diuell in an obscure place; so as the Ana∣conas heare the sound of the voice, but vnderstand it not, nor see any body. They vse the Herbe Villea, with their Chica (drinke made of Mays) and therewith make themselues drunke, that they may be fit for the Diuels conference. The con∣ference with these Witches is one of the greatest lets to the proceeding of the Gospell amongst them.
Among their Religious persons, I may reckon their Confessours. They Idm.c.5. Confessions. helde opinion that all Aduersities were the effects of sinne: for remedy whereof they v∣sed sacrifices. Moreouer, they confessed themselues Verbally almost in all Prouin∣ces, and had Confessors appointed by their superiours to that end, with some Re∣seruation of Cases for the Superiours. They receiued Penance, and that some∣times very sharpely, when they had nothing to giue the Confessor. This office of Confessor was likewise exercised by women. The manner of the Ychuyri Ychuyri. was most generall in the Prouinces of Collasuio. They discouered by lotts, or by the view of some beasts, if any thing were concealed, and punished them vvith ma∣ny blowes of a stone vpon the shoulders, vntill they had reuealed all: after that they enioyned them Penance, and did sacrifice. They likewise vsed Confession, when their Children, Wiues, Husbands or Caciques vvere sicke, or in any great exployt. When the Ingua vvas sicke, all the Prouinces confessed themselues, chiefely those of Collao. The Confessors were bound to hold their Confessions se∣cret, but in certaine cases limited. The sinnes vvhich they chiefely confessed were, killing one another out of warre, stealing, to take another mans Wife, to giue poison, or Sorcerie, to doe any harme, to bee forgetfull in the reuerence of their Guacas, not to obserue Feasts, to speake ill off, or to disobey the Ingua. They accused not themselues of secret sinnes. The Ingua confessed himselfe to no man, but to the Sunne, that hee might tell them to Viracocha, of him to obtaine forgiuenesse: which done, hee made a certaine bath to clense himselfe, in a run∣ning Riuer, saying; I haue told my sinnes, to the Sunne, receiue them then Riuer, and carry them to the Sea, where they may neuer appeare more. Others that con∣fessed vsed likewise those bathes. When any mans Children died; hee was hol∣den for a greeuous sinner, saying, that it was for his sinnes, that the sonne died before the Father. Such therefore, after they vvere confessed, were bathed in the said bathe, and then came a deformed person, to whippe them with certaine Nettles. If the Sorcerers or Inchanters by their lotts or diuinations affirmed that any sicke body should dye, the sicke man makes no difficultie to kill his owne sonne, though he had no other, hoping by that meanes to escape death, saying that in his place he offered his sonne in sacrifice. The Penances enioyned them in Confessions were, to fast, to giue apparell, gold or siluer, to remaine in the mountaines, and to re∣ceiue many stripes vpon the shoulders. The Sacrifices of the Indians may be Gom.c.121 Acost.l.5.c.18. reduced into three kindes; of insen∣sible things; of beastes; of men. Of the first sort vvere their sacrifices of Coca (an Herbe of much esteeme) of Mays, Feathers, Gold, and Siluer, in figures of little beasts, or in the forme of that which he sought for: also of sweet wood, and diuers o∣ther things, whereby their Temples became so rich. They made these offerings Sacrifices and offerings. to ob∣taine a good winde, health, faire weather and the like. Of the second sort of Sacrifices, were their Cuyes, which are like Rabbets, and for rich men in matters of importance, Pacos (the great Camell-fashioned sheepe) with curious obseruation of the numbers, colours, and times. The manner of killing their Sacrifices, is the same vvhich the Mores now vse, hanging the beast by the right fore-legge, turning his eyes toward the Sunne, speaking certaine words, according to the qualitie of the sacrifice. For if it were coloured, they direct∣ed their words to the Thunder, that they might want no water; if white, to the Sunne, that he might shine on them; if gray, to Viracocha. In Cusco they did euery yeare kill and sacrifice with this solemnitie, a shorne sheepe to the Sunne, and did burne it, clad in a red Wastcoate, casting small baskets of Coca into the fire. They sacrificed also small birds on this manner: they kindled a fire of Thornes, and cast the small birds in, certaine officers going about with round stones, wherein were carued or painted Snakes, Lyons, Toads, Tygers, & saying Vsachum, that is, let the victory be giuen vs, with other words. They drew forth certayne blacke sheepe, called Vrca, which had beene kept certaine dayes without meate, and therefore vsed these words: So let the hearts of our enemies
be weakened as these beasts. And if they found, that a certayne peece of flesh behind the heart were not consumed by fasting, they tooke it for a bad signe. They sacrificed also certaine blacke dogges, which they slew and cast into a Plaine, with certaine ceremo∣nies, causing some kind of men to eate the flesh, which they did, lest the Ingua should be hurt with poyson. And for this cause they Fasting. fasted from morning till the starres were vp, and then glutted themselues. This was fitting to withstand their enemies gods. They offered shelles of the Sea to the Fountaines, saying, that the Shelles were the Daughters of the Sea, the Mother of all waters. These shelles they vsed (in manner) in all Sacrifices. They offered Sacrifice of whatsoeuer they did sowe, or raise vp. There were Indians appointed to doe these Sacrifices to the Fountaines, Springs, and Riuers, which passed through their Townes or by their Farmes, that they might not cease running, but alwayes water their grounds. Gomara Gom.qu supra. saith, that their Priests married not, went little abroad, fasted much, although no Fast lasted aboue eight dayes; and that was in their Seede time, and in Haruest, and in gathering of golde, and making warre, and talking with the Deuill: yea some of them (I thinke) for feare, because they are blindfolded when they speake with him, put out their eyes; they enter into the Temples weeping and lamenting, which the word Guaca signi∣fieth Mour∣ning. Guaca signifieth. They touch not their Idoles with their hands without cleane and white linnen, they burie in the Temples the offerings of Golde and Siluer, in their Sacrifices they crie alowd, and were neuer quiet all that day nor night: they annoynted with bloud the faces of their Idoles and doores of their Temples; they sprinckle also their Sepulchres. The Acosta qu supra. Sorce∣rers did coniure, to know what time the Sacrifices should bee made, which beeing ended, they did gather of the contribution of the people what should bee sacrificed, and deliuered them to such as had charge of the Sacrifices. In the beginning of Win∣ter, at such time as the Waters increased by the moysture of the weather, they were diligent in sacrificing to the Waters. They did not sacrifice to the Fountaines and Springs of the Desarts. And euen to this day continueth this their respect to these Springs and Riuers. They haue a speciall care to the meeting of two Riuers, and there they wash themselues for their health, first annoynting themselues with the flower of Maiz, or some other things, adding thereto diuerse ceremonies, which they doe like∣wise in their baths. Their third kind of Sacrifices was the most vnkinde and vnnaturall, namely of men: Wee haue shewed before of their butcheries, at the burialls of their great Lords. Be∣sides this they vsed in Peru to sacrifice young children, from foure or six yeares olde to ten: the greatest part of Sacrifices were for the affaires that did import the Ingua, as in sickenesse for his health, for victorie in warre, at the Coronation or giuing him the Royall Roll. In this solemnitie they sacrificed two hundred children. The maner of the Sacrifice, was to drowne and bury them with certaine ceremonies: sometimes they cut off their heads, annoynting themselues with the bloud from one eare to the other. They did likewise sacrifice Virgins, of such as were brought from their monasteries. The com∣mon sort (as you haue heard) being like to die, would sacrifice their owne sonnes to the Sunne or Viracocba, desiring him to be so content, and spare the fathers life. When they sacrificed, they Gomara. obserued the heart and other the inward parts for divi∣nation, and if they saw a good signe (after their bad construction) they daunced and sung with great merriment; if a bad, they were very heauie: but, good or bad, they would be sure to drinke deepe. They eate not their humane Sacrifices, but sometimes dried them and preserued them in coffins of siluer. It were an endlesse toyle, to reckon vp all the superstitions of Peru, in which were so many Nations, agreeing in disagreeing from truth, yet disagreeing in their diuersi∣fied errours. To let passe Pacura, which fatte, sacrifice, and eate their captiues, and euery tuesday offer two Indians to the Deuill; and the drunken Prouince of Carrapa, where they eate little, and drinke much, at once drinking in, and pissing out; the Mi∣timaes which are earely at their meate, and make but one drinking in the day (which lastes from morning till night) by Bacchus Priuiledge enioying without controll any
woman they like: The Canari put their wiues to the drudgery abroade, whiles them∣selues spinne, weaue, tricke vp themselues, and performe other womanish functions at home: The Galani make their Captiues drunke, and then the chiefe Priest cutteth off their heads, and sacrificeth them. Sansovin & Selva pa.5. Generally, in the mountaines they were more cruell, but all obserued bloudie, beastly, diabolicall ceremonies, the recounting where∣of must needes weary the patientest Reader. CHAP. XII. Of their supputation of Times, of the Feasts, Sepulchres, and other Peruvian superstitions. BEfore we speake of the Peruvian Festivall times, it is not amisse to take some more generall view of their Calendar. They Acosta libr.6.a.3. diuided their yeare into so many dayes iust as wee doe, and into so many Moneths or Moones. To make the Computation of their place certaine, they vsed this industrie: Vpon the mountaine about Cusco there were twelue pillers set in order, and in such distance, as euery moneth one of these pillers did note the rising and setting of the Sunne. They called them Saccanga; by meanes whereof, they taught and shewed the Feasts, and the seasons fit to sowe, and reape, and for other things. They did certayne Sacrifices to these Pillers of the Sunne. Euery moneth had his peculiar name and Feasts. They sometimes beganne the yeare in Ianuarie: but since, an Ingua called Pachacuto, which signifieth a Reformer of the Temple, beganne their yeare in December, by reason, as it seemeth, of the Sunnes returne from Capricorne, their neerest Tropicke. I reade not of any weekes they obser∣ued: for which they had not so certayne a rule, as the Sunnes course was for the yeare, and the Moones for the moneth. They obserued in Peru two kindes of Feasts: some ordinary, which fell our in cer∣tayne moneths of the yeare, and others extraordinary, which were for certayne cau∣ses of importance. Euerie moneth of the yeare they made Feasts and Sacrifices: and had this alike, the offering of a hundred sheepe, but of vnlike colour and forme, ac∣cording to the moneth. In the first moneth they made their first and principall Feast, therefore called Capacrayme, that is to say, a rich and principall Feast. In it they offe∣red a great number of Sheepe and Lambes in Sacrifice, and burnt them with sweete wood: then they caused Gold and Siluer to bee brought vpon certayne Sheepe, set∣ting vpon them three Images of the Sunne, and three of the Thunder, the Father, the Sonne, and the Brother. In these Feasts they dedicated the Knights of Peru. Inguas Children, put∣ting the Guaras or Ensignes vpon them, and they pierced their eares: then some old man did whippe them with slings, and annoynt their faces with bloud, in signe that they should bee true Knights to the Ingus. No stranger might remayne in Cusco du∣ring this moneth, and this Feast, but at the end thereof they entred, and were made partakers of the Feasts and Sacrifices after this manner. Acosta libr.5. ca.23. The Mamacomas or Nunnes of the Sunne made little loaues of the flower of Maiz, died and mingled with the bloud of white Sheepe, which they did sacrifice that day: Then they commaunded that all Strangers should enter, who set themselues in a certayne order: and the Priests which were of a certaine linage, descending from Liuqui Yupangui, Arite re∣sembling the Christians Communion In a deuillish Apishnesse, gaue to euery one a morsell of these small loaues, saying that they gaue it them to the end they should bee vnited and confederate with the Ingua: and that they aduised them not to speake or thinke any euill against the Ingua, but alwayes to beare him good affection: for that this peece should bee a witnesse of their intentions, and, if they did not as they ought, would discouer them. They carried these small loaues in great platters of golde and siluer, appoynted for that purpose; and all did receiue and eate those peeces,
thanking the Sunne and the Ingua. This manner of communicating they vsed likewise in the tenth moneth called Coyarayme, which was September, in the Feast called Cy∣tua. They likewise sent of these loaues to all the Guacas of the Realme, whither the people assembled to receiue them: to whome they said that the Sunne had sent them that, in signe that he would haue them honour him, and the Caciques. This continu∣ed from the time of Ingua Yupangui, whom wee may call the Perovian Num, till the Spaniards substituted in place thereof their Masse, a masse of Corruptioop∣timi pessima. Powlder trai∣tors. more monstrous absur∣dities, (in their transubstantiation, bread-worshipping, God-eating, which they can also vse to combine subiects, not to their Inguas or lawfull Princes, but against them, as our Powlder-traitours did) then the former, notwithstanding the fairer pretexts of Christian and Catholike titles. But to returne to our Capacrayme, it is strange that the Deuill hath not only brought in an apish imitation of Christian Sacraments, but of the Trinitie also in their Pagan rites. For the Father. Sonne, and Brother, called Apomt, Churunti and Intiquaequi, that is, Father Sun, Son Sun, Brother Sun, had some shew of that great mysterie. In like maner they named the three Images of the Chuquilla, or God of the Aire, whence are thunders, raines, and snowes. They had one Guaca where they worshipped an Idoll called Tan∣gatanga, which they said was one in three, and three in one. Thus doth the Deuill de∣spite the truth, which he would seeme to imitate. In the second moneth, called Camey, besides the sacrifices which they made, they cast the ashes into the Riuer, following fiue or six leagues after, praying it to carrie them into the Sea, for that the Viracocha should there receiue this present. In the third, fourth, and fifth moneth, they offered a hundred sheepe, blacke, speckled, and grey, with many other things. In the sixt moneth they offered a hun∣dred sheepe more, of all colours: and then made a Feast, bringing Maiz from the fields into the house, which they yet vse. This Feast is made, comming from the farme to the house, saying certaine songs, and praying that the Maiz may long continue. They put a quantitie of the Maiz (the best that groweth in their Farmes) in a thing which they call Pirua, with certaine Ceremonies, watching three nights. Then doe they put it in the richest garment they haue, and being thus wrapped and dressed, they worship this Pirua, holding it in great veneration, and saying, it is the mother of the Maiz of their inheritances, and that by this meanes the Maiz augments, and is preserued. In this moneth they make a particular sacrifice, and the Witches demaund of this Pirua, if it hath strength enough to continue vntill the next yeare. And if it answers no, then they carry this Maiz to the Farme whence it was taken, to burne, and make an other Pirua as before: and this foolish vanitie still continueth. In the seuenth moneth they made the Feast Intiraym and sacrificed a hundred Guanacos in honour of the Sunne they made many Images of Quinva-wood carued, all attired with rich garments, they daunced, and cast flowers in the high wayes, and thither came the Indians painted and singing. In the eight moneth they burned a hundred sheepe, all grey, of the colour of Visca∣cha with the former solemnities. In Yapaguis their ninth moneth, they burnt a hun∣dred sheepe of Chesnut colour: and likewise a thousand Cuyes (a kinde of Rabbets) to the end the frost, aire, water, and Sunne, should not hurt their Farmes. In the tenth moneth called Coyarami, they burnt a hundred white sheepe that had fleeces: and then they made the Feast Sitna in this manner. They assembled together the first day of the Moone before the rising thereof, carrying Torches in their hands: and when they saw it, they cried alowd, saying, They which did this were called Panco∣co. Let all harme goe away, striking one another with their Torches: which being done, they went to the common Bath, to the riuers and fountaines, and euery one to his owne Bath, setting themselues to drinke foure daies together. In this moneth also the Mamacomas made their loaues (as is said) of com∣municating with the Sunne, and the Ingua. The bathes, drunkennesse, and some relikes of this feast Sitna remaine still, with the ceremonies a little different, but very secretly. In the eleuenth moneth they offered also their hundred sheepe. And if they wan∣ted
water to procure raine, they set a blacke sheepe tied in the middest of a Plaine, powring much Chica about it, and giuing it nothing to eate till it rained. This Acost.libr.4.ca.16. Chica, what it is. Chica is a drinke or wine made of Maiz, sleeped and boyled, and will sooner make one drunke then wine of grapes: they haue an other way to make it, by champing the Maiz, which they hold then best, when it is done (after the beastliest manner) by olde withered wo∣men. This drunken people will spend whole dayes and nights in drinking it, and it is therefore forbidden by the Lawe. But what Law can preuaile against the Deuill and the drunkard? We neede not goe to Peru to prooue this. The twelfth and last moneth they sacrificed a hundred sheepe, and solemnised the Feast called Raymacantar Rayqnis. In this moneth they prepared what was necessarie for the children that should be made Nouices: the moneth following, the olde men made a certaine shew, together with the Children, in Rounds and Turnings, which they commonly doe, when it raineth too much, or too little, and in the time of Plague. Among the extraordinary Feasts (which were many) the most famous was that which they called Ytu. This had no time prefixed, but by Necessitie or Distresse. And then the people prepared themselues thereto, by fasting two dayes; during which they did neither companie with their wiues, nor eate any meate with salt or garlicke, nor drinke any Chica. All did assemble together in one place, where no stranger, nor any beast might be admitted; they had garments and ornaments which serued only for this Feast. They marched very quietly Procession. in Procession, their heads couered with their vailes, sounding of drummes, without speaking one to an other. This continued a Day and a Night: The day following they daunced and made good cheere for two dayes and two nights together, saying that their prayer was accepted. Euen still they vse one which is somewhat like this, called Ayma, with garments onely seruing to that end, and make procession with their Drummes, hauing fasted before, concluding with good cheere. And although the Indians forbeare sacrifices because of the Spaniards, yet they vse many ceremonies still, which had their beginning from their Ancient supersti∣tions. Now concerning their funeralls. The Indians Acost.l.5.ca.7 of Peru beleeued commonly, that the soule liued after this life, and that the good were in glorie, and the bad in paine. They vsed a wonderfull care Funeralls. to preserue the bodies, which they honoured after death: their successours gaue them garments, and made sacrifices to them, especially of the Inguas, of whom we haue spoken before. In their bloudie funeralls the woman he lo∣ued best was slaine, and multitudes of other attendants of all sorts for his new familie in the other world, and that, after many songs and drunkennesse. They sacrificed to them many things, especially young children, and with the bloud they made a stroke on the dead mans face, from one eare to the other. This cruelty is common through a great part of the East and West Indies, as in their places this Historie doth shew you: wittily auoyded once by a Portugall Witty escape , who was a captiue, and to be slaine at the funeralls of his Lord, and hauing but one eie, saw better to saue his life then if hee had had both. For he told them that such a deformed and maimed fellow would bee a disgrace to his Maister in the other life, and so perswaded the Executors, or Executioners (if you will) to seeke a new choice. The Indians haue another ceremonie more generall, which is to set meate and drinke vpon the graue of the dead, imagining they did feede thereon. At this day, many Indian Infidells doe secretly draw their dead out of the Churchyard, and burie them on hills, or vpon passages of mountaines, or else in their owne houses. They haue also vsed to put Gold and Siluer in their mouth, hands, and bosome, and to apparell them with new garments, durable, and well lined. They beleeue, that the soules of the dead wander vp and downe, induring cold, thirst, hunger, and trauell: and for this cause they vse their Anniuersaries, carrying them clothes, meate, and drinke. Pedro de Cieza Cieza pa.1.ca.62. reporteth, that in Cenu in the Prouince of Cartagena (which we heere mention for proximitie of rites, rather then of place) neere to a Temple built in
honour of the Deuill, there was taken forth an innumerable quantitie of Sepulchres, more then a million of them, old and new. Himselfe was there present. Much treasure is found in the graues. Iuan de la Torre tooke forth of one Sepulchre Rich Sepul∣chres. more then fiue hundred thousand pezos. The great men adorned their Sepulchres with Vaults and Towers, and had with them interred their women, servants, meat, chicha, armes and ornaments. He addeth, that the Deuil (in the shape of some principall person deceased) would sometimes appeare, and shew them newes out of that other world, how hee liued and fared there. And hence (it seemes) came that spoyle of so much wealth, and so many persons, for their funeralls. But take heed (Reader) that you doe not beleeue it was the Deuill that was wont to appeare in some habite of afflicted soules, and deman∣ded Dirges and Masses for their manumission out of Purgatorie: alas the Deuill was confined to the Indies, and would neuer haue beene so good a Purueyor for the Popes kitchin. And certes, if our Christian auncesters had not their wiues and goods buried in their graues, with foode, rayment, and ornaments: yet these things were also buried with them, whiles the feares of Purgatorie made them willing to endow the Priests and Monasteries, and bestow on Lights, and other rites, that which should haue maintai∣ned their houses, their wiues, and children. But how come wee from Peru to Rome? Nay, how comes Rome, if not from Peru, as more lately discouered, yet with Peru, and with, and from, other heathen nations in the world, in her manifolde ceremonies and superstitious rites? as this Relation of Peru, for their Confessions, Processions, and many other rites will shew, and one day I hope more fully to acquaint the world, when we come in our Pilgrimage to visite Christian-Antichristian Rome. And thus we take our leaue of this Continent, and must into the adioyning Sea, to obserue matters of principall note we shall there find. CHAP. XIII. Of the Ilands adioyning to America. ANd now I must obey the Spaniards Law, which will Ben.li.3.c.22. admit no stran∣gers trafficke in Peru, and are iealous of any corriuall, which shall holde longer and more familiar discourse with America, although they haue rather forced her to their lusts, then wooed her to their loues. I also beginne to grow weary of this trauell in an other World, willing to looke homewards; and therefore am now embarqued on the Pe∣ruvian cost, where the Peaceable Sea may free me of those former dangers whereto my Pilgrimage was subiect, in passing along snowie and fierie hills, deceitfull vnwhole∣some bogges, scorching sandie plaines, wildernesses, inhabited with wilde beasts, ha∣bitations peopled with wilder and more beastly men; and now by this commoditie of my Paper-barke, I may both direct my course homewards To Leigh & London too. Siluest.in Du Bartas. , and yet walke, as inten∣ding another contrary, or diuerse voyage. And euen as those heauenly Planets Planet signi∣fieth a wan∣derer. in their Wandering and yet most constant course, are guided by the generall motion of that vni∣uersall Wheele, and yet forget not their owne peculiar: so I, in my wandering Discoue∣ries propound all and euery Place of the World, to be the place of my exercise and sub∣iect of my Labour, but yet the smoke of Ithaca Ithaca was the place wher Vlysses dwelt: which (after many yeares trauell) he so much desired to see. is sweetest, and my knowing all would be but a melancholy maze, if I should not come home to fill English eares with the newes. The Reader also, by this time wearied, will be glad to heare of an end. In this Sea we may see many Ilands which Nature hath seemed to set, as Centinells, along the coast, to holde their watch, as skowts to espie, and as Garrisons to defend their Soueraigne, Earth, lest the Ocean (by secret vnderminings, or by violent and tempestuous force, should be too busie an incroacher.
The Earth The rides are stronger on the South Sa then on the Nrsh and higher by ma∣ny degrees. Pet..dec.3.l.2. finding selfe more strongly affaed then on the o∣ther, hath sommoned them all home to her borders, and placed them for her better defence in stions neere ir, not suffering them to stray abroad, as in other Seas is vsuall: so that there are almost no Ilands in this wide of Seas, the Peaceable, but neare the maine. If there be any, they are obscure, small, and not worthy our reation. As for those of Saloqi and New Guinea, with their neighbours, they are reckoned to Teira Au∣stralis. ano∣ther Continent, if they be not Continent themselues, and for the Archipelago of Saint Lazaro, these Ilands may be reckoned vnuely borderers, which whe t is vncertaine, whether they should acknowledge the soueraignetie of Asia, Terra Australis, or A∣merica, are loyall to none; and therefore, where they are best knowne, are knowne by the name of The Ladro∣nes or Ilands of Theeues. Theeues; a nane fitting their nature and disposition. Thus did Magl∣lane find them from whom (besides other things) they stole his boate, which by force he was forced to recouer. A.Pigaletta. Pe.

Cand: sh ap Hac. in Maister Candihes renow∣ned Voyage finde them, who saw also their Images of wood in the head of their boates, like the Images of the Deuill; Temple, and Saint, best fitting their devotions: and such did Olivr Nort Navig OIN. in Additament. .pa.Aineric. finde them, who came crying about him, yron, yron, offe∣ring him  in exchange for peeces of yron, and if any opportuniue offered i selfe, stealing closely, or openly, any thing they could lay holde on. They shot at them in vaine, so actie were they in druing vnder the water, and continuing there, as if they had beene ted alike to both Elements. The women also, no lesse then the men. They are a beastly people, polloing themselues in promiseuous lusts, and branded (many of them) with the markes of their inteperance; the pockes hauing eaten their no∣es and ppea. They are bowne, fae, long of slature: the men goe naked; the wo∣men weare a lease before them, so that they beare some resemblance to the Pictures of Adam and Eue. Their boates are twentie soote long, and but a soot and halfe broad, cunningly wrought. They are extreamely greedie of yron, of which mettall the Hol∣landers cast fiue peeces into the Sea, to trie them, and one of them fetcht them all our. But left these Theeues robbe vs of our intended Deuotions, and our Reader of patience in longer stay here, wee will looke backe towards the Straits, and so compasse the o∣ther side of America. Many Ilands we may see heere neare the shore, all along as wee passe. But what should we trouble the Reader with names? I haue small deuotion to them, vnlesse I had some intelligence of some deuotion in them, further then that wherein they agree with the Peruuian rites, wherewith you were last tired. In the Straits are some Ilands of small quantitie, of smaller dignitie: and who would stay there, where the Penguins Csrtaine fowles which breed on the Ilands. are your best Hosts? the rest are Giants or Man-eating Savages: and in the next, out of the slraits, but seales, who all can yeeld but an inhospi∣tall hospitalitiy. Neither hath prouident Nature in all those coasts of Chica, or Brasil, bin prodigall of her Iland-store, foreseeing that they would, either be vsurped by Seales and Sea-monsters, or other more vnnaturall and monstrous in humane shape, of deuillish inhumanitie, from the land. It seemes she hath beene the more sparing in the numbers, noblenesse, or quantity of Ilands in all those Seas, which we haue most swiftly surrowed, that she might in the great Bay more bountifully impart her plenty, and shew her ex∣celience in that kind. This is a great field, as it were, sowne with Ilands of all sorts; the Earth seemes a louing mother, which holdes open her spacious lappe, and holdes out her setched armes betweene Paria and Florida: the Ocean also, as iealous of the earths more naturall inheritance and claime vnto them, seemes to neglect his course to the Southward, and here sets in with a violent current, alway forcing his waterie forces to walke (or rather to runne and flie) these rounds, to see that the Continent keepe her hand off, and not once touch his conquered possessions; that though (like Tantalus) she seemeth alwayes to be closing her open hands, and mouth vpon them; yet are they kept by this officious watchfulnesse of the Sea, that shee can neuer incorporate and v∣nice them to her selfe. Easily can they vnfolde this mysterie, that are acquainted with the site of the Earth, Pet. Mar.dec. 3.libr.6. and the swiftnesse of the Current in this vast space of Earth and Sea, setting in at Paria, and after out againe at Florida, with admirable and incredi∣ble violence.
To begin then at Pria: (for of Orenoque and his mouth-full of Islands, and of Tri∣nidad, that hath escaped the Riuer, and betaken her selfe wholly to Neptunes Loues, we haue alreadie spoken.) Here two rowes and rankes of Islands make shew and muster of themselues: the one extending East and West, the other North and South. Of the former is Margarita, which (like many a Gallant, whose backe robbeth his belly, whose bowells emptie of necessaries, alway are croaking and complaining of superfluitie in ornament and fashion) so hath shee a Mundus m∣iebris. World of Pearles to adorne her, but wanteth water to satisfie her thirst: store of Pearles shee can communicate of her plentie; water shee is faine to borrow of her neighbours. The like wee may say of Cubagua her next neighbour, that by her store of Pearles hath wonne suiters from our, and the American world, whom shee can nei∣ther bidde eate or drinke of her Land-hospitalitie, where Grasse and Water are wan∣ting. But as it vsually comes to passe with these Fashion-mongers, which neg∣lecting necessaries, must at last be neglected of their ornaments too: So this Island which sometime was so rich, notwithstanding all her Pearles, she pawned for her diet, that the Kings Botero del lsole, l.3. fist amounted ordinarily to fifteene thousand duckats a yeare, yet now seemes almost beggered, her Pearle-fishes and Pearle-fishers, most of them gone: and now it is time for vs to be gone from her too. Little businesse can wee finde any further, in following that Westerne ranke, Or∣chilia, Oruba, and the rest, and therefore will looke Northwards, to that other Ranke wee spake of: where leauing Tobago on the right hand, wee see before vs Granata, Saint Vincent, Saint Luciae, Dominica; and then circling to the North∣west, Desiderata. Saint Christopher, Holy Crosse, and others, whose names, without other matter of Historie, would be but tedious to the Reader. These, and a multi∣tude of others vnmentioned, are called the Islands of the Caribes, or Cannibals. The inhabitants P.Mart, Dec.3.l.6. eate mans flesh, and passe to other Islands with their Boates to the hunting of Men, as other Hunters doe for Beasts. Carib signifieth stranger; for so the more innocent Indians esteeme them. At home they onely couer their priuities, but in time of Warre they vse many ornaments. They are nimble, beardlesse (vsing little Pincers to pull out the haires) shoot poysoned Arrowes, bore holes in their cares and nosthrills for elegancie, which the richer sort decke with Gold, the poorer with shells. From the tenth or twelfth yeare of their age they carrie leaues, to the quantitie of Nuts, all the day in either cheeke, which they take not out, but when they receiue meat or drinke. With that medicine they make their teeth blacke: they call other men Women, for their white teeth, and Beasts for their haire. Their teeth continue to the end of their liues without ach or rottennesse. When the men went on man-hunting, (which they did sometimes in long and farre expeditions) the women manfully defended the coast against their Enemies: and hence it is in Mar∣tyrs P.Mart. Dec.3.l.9. iudgement, that the Spaniards tell of Ilands inhabited only with women: which may be Paloephatus fab.l.1. saith the Amazones were Thracian men, close shauen, in long garments, and therefore called women: but denieth, that there was euer any such Amazonian Expedition, as Histories speake of. the true interpretation, happily, of I know not how many places in Ame∣rica, besides those of Asia and Africa, reported Amazonian. Pontius P.M.Dec.1.l.2. would warre vpon the Caniballs, but on the Island of Guadalupea his women were taken, his men slaine, himselfe forced to depart from that both Place and Enterprise. Co∣lnmbus in his second Voyage landed on this Island, where he saw their round hou∣ses, hanging-beddes of Cotton, and certaine Images, which hee had thought had beene their Gods: but by interpreters after learned, that they were but for orna∣ment, and that they worshipped nothing but the Sunne and Moone, although they make certaine Images of Cotton, to the similitudes of such phantasies as (they said) appeared to them in the night. They found earthen Vessells, like ours, also in their Kitchins, Mans flesh, Duckes flesh, and Goose flesh, all in one pot, and other on the Spits, readie to be layd to the fire. Entring into their inner lodgings, they found faggots of the bones of mens armes and legges, which they reserue to make heads for their Arrowes. They found in their Villages one Hall, or Pallace, to which they assemble, as to their Theatre, or Playing place. The inhabitants at the sight of the
Spaniards were fledde. In their houses they found about thirtie children Captiues, which were reserued to be eaten, but they tooke them for their Interpreters. Here they had Parrots bigger then Phesants, with backes, breasts, and bellies of Pur∣ple colour. They vsed to prey on Hispaniola, and S. Iohns Island, or Buriquen: and if these, in their warres with the Caniballs, tooke any of them, they were sure to goe to pot (euen in the first sense) and to be eaten. A little before Master Hawkins was there, in the yeare 1564, Nau.M.Iohn Hawkins, ap. Hak.to.3. a Spanish Cara∣vell comming to water at Dominiea, one of the Caniball Islands, the Sauages cut her Cable in the night, and so shee draue on shore, and all her companie was sur∣prised and eaten by them. In Tortuga they tolled certaine Spaniards a shore, vnder pretence of Traffique, and then eate them. Boriquen Botero, vol.2. is three hundred myles long, and threescore and ten broad, trauersed with a rough Mountaine, which yeelds many Riuers. The Spaniards haue there some Townes. These Islands are not so well peopled as in former times: and many of them are retyring places of Rebels and Fugitiues, which take this shelter against the Spanish cruelties. Hispaniola is the next Island of name, but shall haue a place by it selfe, as a Mappe and Summarie of all the other. Iamaica is almost as large as Boriquen. It is extreamely subiect to the Vracani, which are such terrible gusts of Winde, that nothing can resist them. They turne vp Trees, ouer-turne Houses, transport the Shippes from Sea to the Land, and bring with them a most dreadfull and horrible confusion. They raigne, or tyrannize ra∣ther, in August, September, and October Mar.Dec..l.2. . The inhabitants are of quicker wits then the other Islands. Cuba is more Northerly, and extendeth it selfe three hundred Leagues in length, and twentie in breadth, full of Mountaines, Woods, Fennes, Riuers, Lakes, both salt and fresh. This Ortl.Theat. Island hath had many names giuen by the Spaniards; Fer∣nandina, Ioanna, Alpha and Omega. The Woods are replenished with Swine and Kine; the Riuers yeeld golden Sands. It hath six Spanish Colonies. Saint Iago, a Bishops See, is the chiefe Towne in the Island; and Havana is the chiefe Port of all the Indies. Ouiedo reckons two things most admirable therein: one a Valley, tren∣ding betweene two Hills three Leagues, which produceth abundance of Stones, e∣nough to lade many Shippes, of a perfect round forme, like Bullets: The other a Fountaine, whence Bitumen, or a certaine Pitchie substance, floweth and floteth euen to the Sea, excellent for pitching of Shippes. In this Island the common people were prohibited the eating of Serpents, as being reserued for Royall dainties, and the Prerogatiue of the Kings Table. Columbus Mart.Dec.1.l.2. sayling by this Island, lighted into a Nauigable Riuer, the water whereof was so hote, that none might endure his hand long therein. He espied also a Cano of Fishermen, which after a strange fashion vsed to hunt Fish, and take them by the helpe of another Fish, which they kept tyed in a cord by the Boates side; and when they espied a Fish, loosed the cord; this hunting Fish presently layes hold on the prey, and with a skinne like a purse growing behind her head, graspeth it so fast, that by no meanes it can be taken from her, till they draw her vp aboue the water, and then not able to abide the ayre, she resigneth her prey to the Fishers, which leape out into the water, and take it; in recompence whereof they giue her part of her purchase. He found also in this Coast Waters, for the space of fortie myles, white and thicke like milke, and as though Meale had beene strewed through that Sea: other Waters hee found Botero. spotted with white and blacke, and others all blacke. An olde man of fourescore yeares being a Gouernour in this Island, came to Columbus, and with great grauitie saluted him, and counselled him to vse his victories well, remem∣bring, that the Soules of Men haue two Iourneyes, after they are departed from their bodies: The one foule and darke, prepared for iniurious and cruell persons; the other pleasant and delectable, for the peaceable, and louers of quiet.
Many other Islands might be here mentioned, and but mentioned: little to our purpose I finde in them. Of Acusamil, neere Iucatan, is alreadie spoken. Of the Lucaiae, or Iucaiae, the greatest thing is their great number, which some P.M.Dec.7.1. esteeme aboue foure hundred. Lucaio is a generall or collectiue name, as Zeland, Lequio, Malucco. The Spaniards had carried the inhabitants, as Martyr testifieth, into ser∣uitude, to satisfie their insatiable desire of Gold. The women of these Islands were so faire, that many of the bordering Countries forsooke their owne Countrey, and chose this for their loue. These women weare nothing till the time of their men∣struous purgation, at which time the parents make a Feast, as if shee were to be married; and after that, shee weareth before those parts Nets of Cotton, filled with leaues of hearbes. They obey their King so strictly, that if he commaund them to leape downe from an high Rocke, alledging no other reason then his will, they performe the same. But they are now, and were long since, desolate Dec.7.8. , being wa∣sted in the Mines of Hispaniola and Cuba, or by diseases and famine, to the number of twelue hundred thousand. But I am loth to wilder my selfe further in this Wildernesse of Islands (for so haue the Spaniards made them:) Dec.1.l.2. Columbus in one Voyage gaue name to seuen hundred Islands; of which I can report little, fitting this our Pilgrimage. Hispa∣niola is Ladie and Queene of them all, and (as it were) the common Store∣house of all their excellencies: and therefore wee will there make some lon∣ger stay. CHAP. XIIII. Of Hispaniola: and a touch homewards at Bermuda. HIspaniola or Spagniola Ortel.Theat. is Eastward from Cuba. It was of the first In∣habitants called Quisqueia, afterwards Haiti, & by Columbus Columbus cal∣led it Cipanga, thinking it to be that Island which Marcus Paulus call, by that name in the East. Ens, l.2. He called it also Ophir, thinking it to be that whēce Salomon had his Gold. Mart.Dec.3.l.7. Cipanga and Ophir. The Spaniards call it as we first mentioned, & also S.Domi∣nike or Dominge of the chiefe Citie an Archiepiscopall Sec. It contai∣neth in compasse fiue hundred and fifty leagues. They called the Iland Quisqueia, which signifieth Great & All, thinking that the Sunne gaue light to no other world then this and the other Ilands adioining. Haiti signifieth Crag∣gie, and such is the Iland in many places, with high Craggie Hilles, ouerlooking the deepe and darke Valleys. But in many places it is most beautifull and flourishing. It see∣meth to enioy a perpetuall spring, the trees alway flourishing, and the medowes cloa∣thed in greene. The aire and the waters are holsome. It is in manner equally diuided with foure great Riuers descending from high mountaines, whereof Iunna runneth East; Attibunicus, West; Naiba, to the South; and Iache, Northward. Some di∣uide it into fiue Prouinces, Caizcimu, Hubaba, Caibabo, Bainoa, Guaccaiarima. In the first of these there is a great Caue, in a hollow Rocke, vnder the root of a high Mountaine, about two furlongs from the Sea; the entrie is like the dores of a great Temple. Many Riuers stole their waters from the sight of the Sunne, the vse of men, and the ordinarie officers of Neptunes Custome-house, and by secret passages came and hidde themselues in this Caue. So the Islanders imagined, seeing diuerse Riuers swallowed vp of the Earth, after they had runne fourescore and ten myles, and such a Sinke or Channell of waters in the Caue. The Islanders beleeued, That the Island had a vitall Spirit, and that there it doth breath: and a hole therein is the female nature thereof (for of that sexe they deeme it) euen as Antiquitie conceited the ebbing and flowing of the Sea to be the breath of Demogorgon.
Andreas Dec.7.8. Moralis entred in with his Shippe, which was almost swallowed with the Whirle-pooles, and boyling of the water. Cloudes, engendred of those waterie conflicts, and Darkenesse, layed hold on his eyes; terrible noyse, as of the falls of Nilus, made deafe his eares, that when with labour he had gotten out, he seemed to haue escaped the barkings of Cerberus, and the obscure Vaults of Hell. Vpon the toppes of high Mountaines, the same Moralis saw a Lake, three myles in compasse, into which many little Riuers ranne, without any other apparant issue. In Bainoa is a Lake of Salt water, notwithstanding it receiueth foure great fresh Riuers, from the East, West, North, and South, and twentie smaller: and within a furlong of the Lake, on the North side, are two hundred fresh Springs. It is thought to haue a large entercourse with the Ocean, because there are Sharkes (great Sea∣fishes, which deuoure men) in the same. Here are stormes and tempests, which seeme to be the Caters and Purueyors for those Fishes, in drowning many. Diuerse other Lakes are mentioned in this Island; one whereof, partly salt, partly fresh, is fiue and twentie myles long, and eight broad. They are all in a large Plaine, a hun∣dred and twentie myles in length and breadth, betweene eighteene and fiue and twentie. There is another Vale two hundred myles long, and broader then the former: and another as broad as that, which is a hundred and fourescore myles long. Bart, de las Csas telleth of a Kingdome in Hispaniola, called Magua, which sig∣nifieth a Plaine, compassed about with Hills, which watered the same with thirtie thousand Riuers and Brookes; twelue of them were very great: and all which come from the West (twentie thousand in number) are enriched with Gold. Cotobi is a Plaine on the toppes of Hills, so high, that it is subiect to the foure seasons of the yeare. There is also another Region of the same name, most barren, and yet most rich; full of Mines, otherwise vnfruitfull; a thing common in Nature, that great Mines vndermine fertilitie; and not strange amongst men, that the grea∣test hoorders of Treasures are the most vnfruitfull, and barren in good workes. The Gold (they say) is as a liuing Tree, which rooting in the centre of the Earth, sendeth forth branches vnto the vppermost face of the Earth, and there sheweth forth cer∣taine beautifull colours in stead of Flowers, round stones of golden Earth in stead of Fruits, and thinne plates in stead of Leaues. From this Island Dec.3. l.4. was yearely brought foure or fiue hundred thousand duckats of Gold yearely. They imagine some diuine nature to be in Gold, and therefore neuer gather it, but they vse certaine religious expiations, abstaining from women, delicate meates and drinkes, and all other pleasures. There is an Island a little from Hispaniola which hath a Fountaine in it, comming by secret passages vnder the Earth and Sea, and riseth in this Island: which they be∣leeue, because it bringeth with it the leaues of many Trees, which grow in Hispanio∣la, and not in this Island; the Spaniards call the Isle, Arethusa The Isle R.Tomson ap. Hak.to.3. of Hispaniola is much infested with Flyes, or Gnats, whose pricking causeth wonderfull swelling: also there is a Worme which creepeth into the soles of mens feet, and makes them grow as bigge as a mans head, with extremitie of paine; for which they haue no remedie, but to open the flesh sometimes three or foure yn∣ches, and so digge them out. The Gnats Mart.dec.7.9. are so troublesome, that the inhabitants doe therefore build low houses, and make little dores, which they keepe close, and forbeare to light Candles. Nature hath to this disease ordained a remedie, namely, certaine creatures, called Cucuij, which is a kinde of Beetles. These haue foure lights, which shine in the night; two in the seat of his eyes, and two which hee sheweth when he openeth his wings. The people get these and bring them to their houses, which there doe them a double seruice: they kill the Gnats, and giue so much light, that men may see to reade letters by the light of one; and many of them seeme as so many candles. They had but three sorts of foure-footed Beasts, & those very little.
Now men are exhaust, and Beasts multiplied, in so strange manner, that one Deane, of the Conception, carrying a Cow thither, she was aliue six and twentie yeares after, and her fruitfull generation was multiplied in the Island to eight hundred. They are now growne wilde, as their dogges also. They kill their Kine for the Hides: fiue and thirtie thousand were transported to Spaine when Acosta returned 1587. Before the discouerie of this Island by Columbus and the Spaniards, these Ilanders of Hispaniola were fore-warned thereof by Oracle. Their Mart. Dec.1.l.9. Cacikes and Botritij (that is, their Kings and Priests) reported to Columbus, That the father of Garionebius, the present King, and another Cacike, would needes be importunate demaunders of their Zemes, or Gods, of future euents, and therefore abstained fiue dayes together from all meat and drinke, spending the time in continuall mourning. The Zemes made an∣swer, That there would come, not many yeares after, vnto that Island a strange Nati∣on, clothed, bearded, armed with shining swords, that would cut a man asunder in the middle; which should destroy the auncient Images of their Gods, abolish their Rites, and slay their children. To remember this Oracle, they composed a mourne∣full Dittie, which they call Areto, which on some solemne dayes they vsed to sing. Now concerning these Zemes (which could fore-tell that which they could not a∣uert) and the superstitions of Hispaniola, Mart.ibid. the Spaniards had beene long in the Island before they knew, that the people wor∣shipped any thing but They wor∣shipped the Sunne, and prayed to it at Sunne-rising. the Lights of Hea∣uen; but after, by further conuersing and liuing amongst them, they came to know more of their Religion, of which, one Ramonus, a Spanish Heremite, writ a Booke, and Martyr hath borrowed of him to lend vs. It is apparent by the Images which they worshipped, that there appeared vnto them certaine illusions of evill spirits. These Images they made of Gossampine cotton hard stopped, sitting, like the pictures of the Deuill, which they called Zemes; whome they take to be the mediators and Messen∣gers of the Great God, which they acknowledge One, Eternall, Infinite, Omnipo∣tent, Inuisible. Of these they thinke they obtaine raine, or faire weather, and when they goe to the Warres, they haue certaine little ones which they bind to their fore∣heads. Euery King hath his particular Zemes, which he honoureth. They call the eternall GOD by these two names, Iocauna, and Guaaonocon, as their predecessors taught them, affirming, That he hath a father called by these fiue names, Attaberra, Mamona, Guacarapita, Liella, Guimazoa. They make the Zemes of diuerse matter and forme: some of Wood, as they were admonished by certaine Visions appearing to them in the Woods: others, which had receiued answere of them among the Rockes, make them of Stone: some of Rootes, to the similitude of such as appeare to them when they gather the Rootes, whereof they make their bread, thinking, that the Zemes sent them plentie of these Rootes. They attribute a Zemes to the particular tuition of euery thing; as some∣times the Pagan and now the Popish Romanes: some assigned to the Sea, others to Fountaines, Woods, or other their peculiar charges. When the Boitij consult with the Zemes, they goe into the house dedicated to him, and with the poulder of the hearbe Cohobba, snuffed into their nosthrills, are distracted; after which, returning as out of a traunce, he telleth, That the Zemes had spoken to him, and vttereth his reuelations. They say, That a certaine King, called Guamaretus, had a Zemes, whose name was Corochotum, which often vsed to descend from the toppe of the house, where Guama∣retus kept him close bound: the cause of his breaking loose was either to hide him∣selfe, or to goe seeke for meat, or else for the act of generation: and that sometimes being offended, that the King Guamaretus had not honoured him diligently, hee was wont to lye hid for certaine dayes. In this Kings Village were some chil∣dren borne with two Crownes, which they supposed to bee the issue of this Zemes. And when this Village was burned by the enemie, this Zemes brake his bands, and was found a furlong off, without any harme. Hee had another Zemes, called Epileguanita, made of Wood, being in shape like a foure-footed Beast, which went often from the place where he was honoured, into the Woods.
When they perceiued that he was gone, a great multitude gathered together to seeke him, with deuout prayers: and when they had found him, brought him home religiously on their shoulders, to the Chappell dedicated vnto him. But after the Spaniards comming into the Island, he fledde for altogether, and could neuer be found, where∣by they diuined the destruction of their Countrey. They honoured another Zemes, in the likenesse of a woman, on whome waited two other, like men. One of these executed the office of a messenger to the Zemes, that had authoritie of Clouds, Windes, and Raine, and are at commaund of this wo∣man: the other performed the like to the Zemes of the Waters, that fall from the Hills, that being loosed, they might breake into Flouds, and ouerflow the Countrey, if the people doe not giue due honour to her Image. Let vs adde to this relation of the Zemes of Hispaniola an accident in Mart.Dec.2.l.6. Cuba. A Mariner being sicke, was there left on shore, who recouering, grew into fauour with the King, and was employed in his warres with great successe against the ene∣mie: He attributed his victories to the Virgine Marie, whose picture he had in his bosome. The King by his persuasion reiected his Zemes, and dedicated a Chappell and Altar to this Picture, whither he and all his familie resorted a little before the Sunne-set, bowing their heads, and saying, Aue Maria, Aue Maria, further they could not say. They beet the same with Iewels, and many earthen pots, some with sundry meates, some with water, round about the Tabernacle, which they offered in stead of sacrifice, as before they had done to their Zemes. Being demaunded, why they did thus, they answered, least it should lacke meat, for they beleeue, that Images may hunger, and doe eate and drinke. They told of this picture, That being carried with them into the Warres (as they vse to bring their Zemes with them into the battaile) this made the Zemes of the e∣nemie turne his backe, yea, a woman (a lye, or a Deuill) descended in the sight of them all to play the Bellona for her followers; and in a contention betwixt them, whether the Zemes or this Ladie were more excellent, two young men of each side were bound, and whether Deitie should loosen her partie, that should be their God. Both inuoke, the Deuill appeared in vgly shape, and by and by a faire Virgin, where∣at the Deuill vanished (doe you beleeue it?) and the Virgine with touch of a rod loosed her mans bands, which were found on the other aduerse partie, being now double-bound. Thus can the Deuill transforme himselfe into an Angell of Light at Loretto, in Hispaniola, and where else soeuer he can be entertained; the name of Saints, and promise of Heauen, shall further his hellish designes. They had festiuall Solemnities in Hispaniola Dec.7.10. to their Zemes, whereunto the Kings summoned their subiects by publike Criers: and they, neatly dressed after their man∣ner, and painted with diuerse colours of hearbes, resorted thither, with their armes, thighes, legges, adorned with shells, to make Musicke in their dauncing. Thus they presented themselues before the King, who sat drumming at the entrance of the gate. When they were to sacrifice, they purged themselues first, thrusting downe a sacred hooke into their throat, and by vomit emptied their bodies. After, they went into the Kings Court, and all sate in a ring about the Idoll, crosse-legged like Taylors, and wry∣necked for reuerence, praying, that their sacrifice might be accepted. The women in another place, when the Priests gaue warning, fell to dauncing and singing the prayse of their Zemes, and offered Cakes in baskets, concluding with Songs in praise of their ancient Kings, & prayers for future prosperitie. After this, both sexes kneeled downe, and offered their Cakes; which the Priests receiuing, cut in peeces, giuing to euery man a portion, which he kept vntouched the whole yeare, for a holy Relique, estee∣ming that house in danger of Fire and Whirlewinds, that is not preserued with this reserued peece of Cake. They seemed sometimes to heare a voice from their Zemes, (whether by the illusion of the Priests, or the Deuill) which the Priests interpreted by their behauior: for if they daunced and sung, all was well: but if they went sorrowful∣ly, the people went forth sighing, and gaue themselues to fasting, euen to extreame faintnesse with weeping, vntill they thought their Zemes reconciled.
Touching the originall of Man, thus they fable. There is in the Iland a Region cal∣led Caunana, where they faine that mankind came first out of two Caues of a Moun∣taine called Cauta: and that the biggest sort of men came forth of the mouth of the biggest Caue, and the least sort out of the least Caue: this Caue they name Amaianna, the greater, Cazibaagua. Before men might come out of the Caue, the mouth there∣of was kept and watched nightly, by a man whose name was Machoshael, who de∣parting further to looke abroad, was by the Sunne (the sight of whom he was forbid∣den) turned into a stone. They faine the like of others turned into trees, for going so farre a fishing in the night, that they could not returne before the rising of the Sunne. A certaine Ruler also, called Vagoniona, sent one forth of the Caue a fishing, who by the Sunnes surprisall, was turned into a Nightingale, which therefore in the night be∣waileth his misfortune. Vagoniona sore troubled with this losse, leauing the men in the Caue, brought forth the women and sucking children, and leauing the women in an Iland of that Tract, called Mathinine, carried the children away with him, which be∣ing oppressed with famine, fainted; and remained on the bankes of a certaine Riuer, where they were turned to Frogges, and cried toa, toa, as children with them vse to crie for the dugge. And hence also come those pitifull cryings of the Frogges in the Spring-time. As for Vogoniona, he by speciall priuiledge was not transformed: wan∣dering in diuers places, he descended to a certaine faire woman, whom he saw in the bottome of the sea, and receiued of her bright plates of Laten, and a kinde of stones which their Kings greatly esteemed. Another Caue they had (for the former tale is endlesse, as superstition commonly is) called Ionana boina, adorned with pictures of a thousand fashions. In the entrance were two grauen Zemes, whereof one was called Binthaitel, and the other Marohu. Out of this Caue they say the Sunne and Moone first came to giue light to the world. They made religious concourse to these Caues, as men goe on Pilgrimage to Rome, Compostella, or Ierusalem. They had a superstitious conceit of their dead: who (they thought) walked in the night, and eat the fruit Guannaba (which is like to a Quince) and that they would de∣ceiue women, in taking the shape of men; making, as though they would haue to doe with them, and suddenly vanish away. If any feeling a strange thing in his bed, made doubt whether it were a dead body, he might be resolued by feeling on his belly, be∣cause these ghosts could take all other members of mans body, but not the nauell (as some with vs imagine that the Diuell can take the whole shape of a man, onely his clawes excepted): these dead men, they say, often met them by the way, and if a man were not afraid, they vanished; but if he were afraid, they would assault him, and ma∣ny hereby haue beene taken with the losse of their limbes. These superstitions were left them by tradition in rithmes and songs from their forefathers, which it was law∣full for none to learne, but onely the Kings sonnes. They sung them before the peo∣ple on solemne Feasts, playing on an instrument like a Timbrel. Their Boitij or Priests instruct them in these superstitions: these are also Physicians, making the people be∣leeue that they obtaine health for them of the Zemes. They tie themselues to much fasting, and outward cleanlineffe and purging; especially where they take vpon them the cure of great men: for then they drunke the powder of a certaine herbe, which brought them into a fury, wherein they said they learned many things of their Zemes. Much adoe they make about the sicke partie, deforming themselues with many gestures, breathing, blowing, sucking the fore-head, temples, and necke of the patient; sometimes also saying that the Zemes is angrie for not erecting a Chappell, or dedica∣ting to him a Groe or Garden, or the neglect of other holies. And if the sicke party die, his kinf-folkes by witchcraft enforce the dead to speake, and tell them whether he died by naturall destiny, or by the negligence of the Boitij, in not fasting the full due, or ministring conuenient medicine: so that if these Physitians be found faultie, they take reuenge of them. They vsed in ministring their Physicke, to put certaine stones or bones in their mouthes, which if the women can get, they keepe religiously, be∣leeuing them to be profitable for them in trauell, and honor them, as they doe their Zemes.
When their Kings died, they buried the best beloued of their concubines with them, who also had other women buried for their attendants, together with their iewels and ornaments. They had in the sepulchre beside them a cup full of water, and some of their Casaui-bread. Hauing thus wearied you with this long stay in Hispaniola (by which ye may guesse of the neighbouring Ilands) we will hast homeward, and not touching in any Iland by the way (for we could but touch and away) we may aduenture, notwithstanding the wonted danger, vpon Bermuda. Danger hath made it now not so dangerous: nocuments haue beene documents. For while some haue bin wracked there, they haue made vertue of Necessity, and so well obserued the coast, that skill hath almost secured that which Nature had seemed to set there in defiance, both of Habitation and Naui∣gation, to both which it is now subiected by our Nation. It was called Bermuda of that ship which first discouered it: Boter. it is also called the Iland of Diuels, which they suppose inhabit there; and the Inchanted Iland: but these are inchanted conceits. Sir George Sommers hath deserued that it should beare his name, by his endeuours there∣abouts testified in life and death. He with Sir Thomas Gates, as before is said, were wracked on the Iland, which losse turned to some gaine, as if GOD would giue them this into the Virginia-bargaine. Before in the yeare 1593. Henry Henry May ap.Hak. tom.3. May, an Eng∣lishman, in a French ship was wracked thereon, and hath giuen vs some discourse ther∣of: more fully hath Syluester Syl. Iourdan. Iourdan, one of that Virginian Company, one of the company of those worthy Knights, in a Treatise of that ship-wracke, and the discoue∣ry of Bermuda. The commodities whereof he reckoneth, variety of fishes, plenty of hogges (which it seemeth haue escaped out of some wracks) diuers fruits, Mulberies, Silke-wormes, Palmitos, Cedars, Pearles, Amber-grife: But the most strange thing seemes the variety of fowle, of which they tooke a thousand of one sort in two or three houres, being as bigge as a Pigeon, and laying speckled egges, as bigge as Hens egges, on the sand, where they come and lay them daily, although men sit downe a∣mongst them.. When Sir Thomas Gates his men haue taken a thousand of them, Sir George Sommers men haue staid a while by them, and brought away as many more. Another fowle there is, that liueth in holes like Cony-holes; their egges like in quan∣titie and qualitie to Hen-egges. Other birds were so gentle, that whistling to them, they would come and gaze on you, while with your sticke you might kill them. O∣ther egges they had of Tortoises, a bushell in the belly of one, very sweet: they tooke fortie of them in a day: and one would serue fiftie men at a meale. Two were there borne, and other two married, to take the most naturall possession thereof for our Na∣tion; which now in hope of good successe hath there planted an habitation. That wracked company built there a shippe and a pinace, and set saile for Virginia. From hence and thence I am now passing in an English ship for England, where to passe a∣way tediousnesse of the Voyage, I will entertaine my Reader with a discourse of the more then tedious and fastidious Spanish cruelties. CHAP. XV. Of the Spanish cruelties in the West-Indies: and of the peruerse conuersion of the Indians vnto Christianitie. FOrasmuch as the Papists doe vsually glorie in the purchase of a new World vnto their Religion, and would haue men beleeue, that since this Scripture-Heresie hath made new Rome to tremble now, no lesse then Hannibal did her Pagan-Mother, they haue a new Alan.

Costeri Enchirid. the truenesse and Catholicisme of their Church: it shall not be amisse to obserue the proceedings of the
Spaniards in these parts. And herein we will vse the witnesse of men of their owne Romish Religion. Iosephus Acosta lib.4. de procurand. ind. salute.ca.3. Acosta, a Iesuite, writeth, that the Indians conceiue an implacal hatred against the faith, by the scandall of the Spaniards cruelties: and that they ue baptised some by force. Vega And. vega de f.& operibus q.3. accuseth them of Baptising without making them know the faith, or taking knowledge of their life. Hee that will reade what they lately haue done in Spaine with the remnants of the Moores, may perhaps satisfie himself with the reasons of Frier F. Damiao Fonseca delgiu∣flo scacciamento de Moreschi da Spagna. Fonseca in defence thereof. But for the poore Indians, Bartholomaeus de las Casas, Bar. Cal. Hi∣span. Crudeltat. a Dominike Frier, of the same order with Fonse∣ca, and after a Bishop in America, hath written a large and vnanswerable Treatise of the enormious cruelties, and vnchristian Antichristian proceedings in the new World, the summe whereof is this, that the Indians were a simple harmelesse people, loyall to their Lords, and such as gaue no cause to the Spaniards of dislike, till they by ex∣treame iniuries were prouoked: they are also docible and pliant, both to good do∣ctrine and liuing. To these Lambes, saith he, the Spaniards came as cruell and hungry Tygres, Beares and Lions, intending nothing those fortie yeares (he wrote this An. 1542.) but bloud and slaughter, to satisfie their Auarice and Ambition: in so much that of three millions of people, which were contained in Hispaniola of the Naturall inhabitants, there scarse remained at that time three hundred. Cuba, and the other Ilands had indured the like miserie, and in the firme Landten Kingdomes, greater then all Spaine, were dispeopled and desolate, and in that space there had not perished lesse then twelue millions by their tyranny; and he might truely say that fifty millions had paid Natures debt. In the Iland Hispaniola the Spaniard had their first Indian habitations, where their cruelties draue the Indians to their shifts, and to their weake defence, which caused those enraged Lions, to spare neither man, woman, nor childe: they ripped vp the great-bellied women, and would lay wagers, who could with most dexterity strike off an Indians head, or smite him asunder in the middle: they would plucke the Infants by the heeles from their mothers breasts, and dash out their braines against the stones, or with a scoffe hurle them into the Riuer. They set vp gibbets, and in honor of CHRIST and his twelue Apostles (as they said, and could the Diuell say worse?) they would both hang and burne them. Others they tooke, and cutting their hands almost off, bid them carry those letters (their hands dropping bloud, and almost drop∣ping off themselues) to their Countrey-men, which (for feare of the like) lay hidden in the Mountaines. The Nobles and commanders, they broiled on gridirons: I once (saith our Author) saw foure or fiue of the chiefe of them thus rosted, which making a lamentable noise, the nicer Captaine bad they should be strangled, but the cruell tor∣mentor, chose rather to stoppe their mouthes, so to preuent their out-cries, and to con∣tinue their broiling till they were dead. They had dogges to hunt them out of their couerts, which deuoured the poore soules: and because sometimes the Indians, thus prouoked, would kill a Spaniard, if they found opportunitie, they made a law, that an hundred of them should for one Spaniard be slaine. The King of Magua offered to till the ground for them fiftie miles space, if they would spare him and his people from the mines. The Captaine in recompence deflowred his wife, and he hiding himselfe, was taken, and sent into Spaine; but the ship perished in the way, and therein that admira∣ble P.Mart. mentioneth this graine of gold: and like∣wise the Spa∣nish cruelties; though not so largely as Ca∣sas graine of gold, which weighed in the first finding, being pure, three thousand and six hundred Crownes. In the Kingdome of Xaraqua in Hispaniola, the Gouernour called before him three hundred Indian Lords, which he partly burned in a house, and put the rest to the sword, and hanged vp the Queene, as they did also to Hiquanama the Queene of Hi∣quey. Of all which cruelties our Author an eye-witnesse affirmeth, that the Indians gaue no cause by any crime, that had so deserued by any law. And for the rest that re∣mained after these warres, they shared them as slaues. They which should haue instru∣cted them in the Catholike faith, were ignorant, cruell, and couetous. The men were spent in the mines, the women consumed in tillage, and both, by heauy burthens which they made them carry, by famine, by scourging, and other miseries.
And thus they did in all other parts wheresoeuer they came. In the Iles of Saint Iohn, and Iamayca, were six hundred thousand Inhabitants, whereof then when the Author wrote this, there were scarsely left two hundred in either Iland. Cuba exten∣deth furthest in length of any of these Ilands. Heere was a Cacique named Hathuey, which called his subiects about him, and shewing them a boxe of Gold, said, that was the Spaniards God, and made them dance about it very solemnely; and lest the Spa∣niards should haue it, he hurled it into the Riuer. Being taken and condemned to the fire; when he was bound to the stake, a Frier came and preached heauen to him, and the terrors of hell: Hathuey asked if any Spaniards were in heauen, the Frier answered, yea, such as were good; Hathuey replied, he would rather goe to hell, then goe where any of that cruell Nation were. I was once present, saith Casas, when the Inhabitants of one towne brought vs forth victuall, and met vs with great kindnesse, and the Spaniards without any cause slew three thousand of them, of euery age and sexe. I, by their counsell, sent to other Townes to meet vs, with promise of good dealing, and two and twentie Caciques met vs, which the Captaine against all faith caused to be burned. This made the de∣sperate Indians hang themselues (which two hundred did, by the occasion of one mans crueltie): and one other Spaniard seeing them take this course, hee made as though he would hang himselfe too, and persecute them in the regions of Death, which feare detained some from that selfe-execution. Sixe thousand children died, saith our former Author, in three or foure monthes space, while I was there, for the want of their parents which were sent to the mines: they hunted out the rest in the mountaines, and desolated the Iland. Neither did the other Ilands speed better. The Lucaiae they brought to an vtter desolation: and shipping multitudes of men for the mines in Hispaniola, wanting food for them; the third part commonly perished in the way; so that an vnskilfull Pilot might haue learned this way by Sea, by those floting markes of Indian carkasses. This Spanish Pestilence spread further to the Continent, where they spoiled the shores, and the Inland Countries of people. From Dariena to Nicaragua, they slew foure hundred thousand people with dogges, swords, fire, and diuers tortures. Their course Marke this way of con∣uerting Infi∣dels. of preaching was, to send, vnder paine of confiscati∣on of lands, libertie, wife, life, and all, to acknowledge GOD and the Spanish King, of whom they had neues heard. Yea, they would steale to some place halfe a mile off the Citie by night, and there publish the Kings decree in this sort, being alone by themselues. Ye Caciques and Indians of this or that place (which they named) Be it knowne to you, that there is one GOD, one Pope, and one King of Castile, who is Lord of these Lands, Come quickly and doe your homage. And then in the night, whiles they were asleepe, fired their houses, and slew and tooke captiues at their plea∣sure, and then fell to search for Gold. The first Bishop that came into these parts, sent his men to be partakers of the spoile. A Cacique gaue the Spanish Gouernour the weight in Gold of nine thousand crownes; he (in thankefulnesse) to extort more, bound him to a post, and put fire to his feet, and forced him to send home for a further addition of three thousand. They not satisfied, persisted in their tormenting him, till the marrow came forth at the soles of his feet, whereof he died. When any of the Indians, employed by the Spaniards, failed vnder their heauie burthens, or fainted for want of necessaries, lest they should lose time in opening the chaine wherein he was tied, they would cut off his head, and so let the bodie fall out. The Spaniard robbed the Nicaraguans of their corne, so that thirtie thousand died of famine, and a mother eat her owne child: fiue hundred thousand were carried away into bondage, besides fiftie or sixtie thousand slaine in their warres: and now, saith Casas, remaine foure or fiue thousand, of one of the most populous Regions of the World. Heere did Vaschus P.Mart.Dec.3.lib. Cortes accusto∣med himselfe to haue foure Kings attend on him. Dec.8.lib.3.2. He burned sixtie Kings, their heires looking on. giue at one time foure Kings to be deuoured of dogges. In New Spaine, from the yeare 1518. to 1530, in foure hundred and fourescore miles about Mexico, they destroyed aboue foure millions of people in their conquests by fire and sword, not reckoning those which died in seruitude and oppression. In the Prouince of Naco and Honduras, from the yeare 1524. to 1535. two millions of men
perished, and scarsely two thousand remained. In Guatimala, from the yeare 1524. to 1540. they destroyed aboue foure or fiue millions vnder that Aluarado, who dying by the fall of his horse, as is before said, complained (when he was asked where his paine was most) of his soule-torment: and his Citie Guatimala was with a three-fold de∣luge of earth, of water, of stones, oppressed and ouerwhelmed. He forced the Indi∣ans to follow him in his Expeditions, in Armies of 10. or 20000. not allowing them other sustenance, then the flesh of their slaine enemies, maintaining in his armie sham∣bles of mans flesh. In Panuco and Xalisco their state was much like; one made eight thousand Indians wall about his Garden, and let them all perish with famine. In Machuacan they tortured the King that came forth to meet them, that they might extort gold from him. They put his feet in the stockes, and put fire thereto, binding his hands to a post behind him; and a Boy stood by basting his rosted feet with oyle, an∣other with a crosse-bow bent to his brest, and on the other hand another with dogs; of these tortures he died. They forced the Indians to deliuer their Idols, hoping they had beene of Gold, but their golden hope failing, they forced them againe to redeeme them. Yea where the Friers had in one place made the Indians to cast away their Ima∣ges, the Spaniards brought them some from other places to sell them. In the Prouince of Saint Martha they had desolated foure hundred and fifty miles of land. The Bishop wrote to the King, that the people called the Spaniards Diuels, or Yares, for their Diabolicall practises; and thought the Law, GOD, and King of the Christians, had beene authors of this crueltie. The like they did in the Kingdome of Venezuela, destroying foure or fiue millions, and out of that firme Land, carried to the Ilands for slaues at times, in seuenteene yeares, a million of people. But why doe I longer trace them in their bloudie steppes; seeing our Au∣thor that relates much more then I, yet protesteth that it was a thousand times worse. Or what should I tell their sparing no persons, plucking the childe from the breast to quarter it to his dogges? torturing Kings with new deuises, borrowed ei∣ther from the Inquisition, or from Hell? cutting off the noses and hands of men and women that liued in peace with them? selling the father, mother, childe, to diuers places and persons? lying with the women (as one of them bragged) that being with childe, they might yeeld more money in the sale? How was Nature become degene∣rate in these prodigious monsters? Euen the Nature of things might be abashed with the sense of this vnnaturall senselessenesse. The Tygre would but deuoure his prey, and not curiously torment it; the Lion sometimes spares it; nay their dogges haue sometime beene lesse dogged, then their doggish Diuellish matters. How may we ad∣mire that long-suffering of GOD, that rained not a floud of waters, as in Noahs time, or of fire, as in Lots, or of stones, as in Ioshuas, or some vengeance from Hea∣uen vpon these Models of Hell? And how could Hell forbeare swallowing such pre∣pared morsels, exceeding the beastlinesse of beasts, inhumanitie of wonted tyrants, and diuellishnesse, if it were possible, of the Diuels? But these you will say were Nulla sides pitasq. viris qu castra se∣quuntur.Lucan, soul∣diours: let vs leaue the Campe and looke to their Temples. There perhaps you shall see their Priests reading, praying, and (this they most glo∣rie of) preaching to conuert the Indians by their word and workes. Aske Colmenero, a Priest of Saint Martha, who being asked what he taught the Indians, said that he deuoted them with curses to the Diuell, and this sufficed, if he said to them, Persignin Sanctin Cruces. You haue heard what good Diuinitie the Dominican preached to A∣tabaliba, King of Peru (which wanted not her wants of millions by their cruelties, as well as the former). They teach them (saith Acost.de Proc. Ind.sal.l.4.c.3. Acosta) a few prayers in the Spanish tongue, which they vnderstand not; and they which are more painfull, a Catechisme without explanation. Their teaching is but a iest and shadow to get money: they follow dicing, hunting, whoring; in so much that Baptisme is scorned, and the Indians are forced to it against their wils: and a sincere Io. Metell: Seq. prefat.in Osor. and vpright Iudge was wont to say, that if he came into Spaine, he would perswade the King to send no more Priests into America; such is
their dissolutenesse. They haue indeed three Archbishoprickes; that of Dominico, which hath six Suffragane-Bishops; the second of Mexico, which hath seuen; the third of Los Reyes, to which are subiect three Bishops: yet these teach the people vices by their practise and ill example; in so much that the Indians (saith Casas) are of opinion that the King of Spaine (which hath such subiects, as the Spaniards shew themselues) is himselfe most cruell, and liues on mans flesh; and that of all Gods, the GOD of the Christians is the worst, which hath so bad seruants, longing for their owne Gods, of whom they neuer receiued such ill, as now by this of the Christians. The Spaniards cannot endure the Indians to heare a Sermon, thinking it makes them idle (as Pharaeoh said Exod.5.8.17. of the Israelites) and captious: they learne them Vsury, lying, swearing, blasphe∣mie, repugnant to their Nature. Thus did a Cacique Benzo lib.2.cap.16. describe a Christian to Benzo, by the vnchristian course of the Spaniards. Christian (saith he, looking Benzo on the face) what are Christians? They imperiously demand Mays, Hony, Silke, Rayment, an Indian woman to Iye with them; they call for Gold and Siluer, they will not worke; are Gamsters, Dicers, Wicked, Blasphemers, Back-biters, Quarellers: and concluded, that Christians could not be good. Benzo said, that euill Christians did such things, not the good ones: he replied, where are those good, for I neuer saw any but bad. He was threescore and ten yeares old, and spake Spanish perfectly. Benzo saith, that they would not looke on the Christians, but curse them, and as before is said, called them Virarochie. Sea-froth. He being very inquisitiue to see what they thought of our faith, repor∣teth, that some of them taking a peece of Gold, will say, Lo heere the Christians God: for this they kill vs, and one another, for this they play, blaspheme, curse, steale, and doe all manner of villanies. Cap.1.8. A Franciscan publikely said, that there was neither Priest, Monke, nor Bishop, good in all India: and the Priests themselues will say, they came thither for gaine. A Caciques sonne which was towardly in his youth, and pro∣ued after dissolute, being asked the reason thereof, said, Since I was a Christian I haue learned to sweare in variety, to dice, to lie, to swagger, and now I want nothing but a Concubine (which I meane to haue shortly) to make me a complete Christian. These indeed are the miracles that the Spaniards worke in the Indies, saith our Author: I as∣ked an Indian once if he were a Christian; he againe asked me if he should be the Bi∣shops Groome a dozen yeares to keepe his Mule. Others of the Indians, saue a little washing and some cold ceremonies, know nothing of our religion. The Indians haue liued at more quiet with the Spaniards, since the King pro∣claimed them free; yet still hate them: and for their Christianitie, Franciscus F. à Vic.Rel.5. De Indis. à Victpria pro∣testeth, that it doth not appeare to him, that Christian Religion had beene propoun∣ded in meet sort to the Indians: Miracles he heard not of, but on the contrary, scan∣dals, villanies, and many impieties. This is the Preaching and Conuersion the Ro∣mists boast of, and gull our European world with musters of their miracles, and thou∣sands of their Profelites, which we rather pitie then enuie. How the case is altered, since that new generation of the Ignatian brood hath taught (especially the Spaniards, whose they are, and whom they serue) a better Catholicisme; let Arnauldus Arnauld. against the Ie∣suites. tell you: he saith, that they haue indeed wrought miracles amongst the Indians: among which he reckoneth Conuerting the Pagans, by butcherly subuerting and oting them out. In Hispaniola, by keeping the husbands and wiues in diuers workes asunder, the old generation being thus worne out, and a new preuented. In Peru they had publike places of torture within the Marches, wherein they might put a thousand at once, by tortures to draw forth confessions of their hidden treasures: such as escaped, hanged themselues in the mountaines, and their wiues by them, with their children at their feet. By their dogges at land they worried them: and in their Pearle-fishing exposed them to the rauening Sharkes, themselues more dogged and sharking then the brute creatures; by fire and sword consuming twentie millions of the people. I would giue the Diuell his due, and therefore would not ascribe all this to those later Locusts, the Iesuites: who are yet accounted the most cunning and zealous Architects, in setting vp the roofe of that aspiring Spanish Monarchy, these and the like bloudie foundations notwithstanding; and therefore may be called Accessories
after. As for the Spaniards, we see them, by testimony of their owne, accused of the same things. And how the Ignatians wash their hands (not from, but in) bloud, our Europe can testifie. What Diuell brought the Inquisition (his faire daughter much resembling his ac∣cursed presence) I know not: our Countrey-men, Miles Phil. Iob Hort.ap. Hak. Philips, Hortop and others, knew to their cost. But what should we speake of the Spanish crueltie to others? Looke on their dealing with each other in ciuill broyles: thus dealt they with Columbus, re∣warding him with chaines, and sending him prisoner to Spaine, by that way which hee first of all, and for Spaine, had discouered. What Roldanus and his rebellious faction did in Hispaniola, and Vaschus in the Continent, Martyr relateth. But the bloudiest butcheries passed in Peru: where Couetousnesse, which before had ioy∣ned, now diuorced the hearts of Piarro and Almagro; and after that, that neerer coniunction of the head and bodie of Almagro; See Gomara, Apollonius, Ben∣zo, &c. of these ciuill warres in Peru. reuenged in the persons of all the Piarri, which againe retorted the like vengeance vpon the Almagrists; their ghosts seeming, or some hellish Furies rather, to be loosed on that Peruuian stage, and to haue brought like mischiefes to the beholders and actors in this Tragedie. Vengeance see∣med to haue broken forth of Atabalibas tombe, armed with sword, fire, halters, chaines, yea the Spaniards themselues offered themselues her officious vassals, to be∣come cruell Executors of her bloudie Will, in mutuall executions vpon themselues. The awfull names of Viceroyes, Gouernours, and Captaines, were no lesse subiected to imprisonment and death, then the poorest souldiour. But for these ciuill vnciuill cruelties amongst themselues, they require a good Orator to describe them: and those former tyrannies vpon the Indians, are beyond all oratory and description. Thunders from heauen had need be the voice to vtter such hellish and vnheard-of massacres, Di∣uells from Hell were fittest scribes, with the firie characters of their infernall worke∣houses to register them, the reading whereof might astonish the sense of the Reader, amaze his reason, exceed his faith, and fill his heart with horror and vncouth passions. For me, I want fit words to paint them in their blacke colours, my hand with relucta∣tion trembleth at the writing, my tongue faltereth in the speaking, and wholly I seeme to my selfe surprised with distraction, and not to be my selfe, whiles the view of this Spanish Medusa transformeth me into a stone: the rather when I thinke such should our English Conuersion haue beene, if in that dismall yeare 1588. England had as well succeeded to them as the Indies: or if since, our Catholike Preachers had preuailed in their Powder-proiects, in the yeare 1605. who for a Temple, chose a Vault, that their workes of darkenesse might bee done in the darke, and their work-house might bee neerer to Hell, thence to borrow at hand supplies of diuellish deuises, and in neerer fa∣miliaritie to consult with the Diuell: for words they had prepared a sulfurous breath, the smoke whereof might darken the Heauens; the fire might rent the trembling and astonished Earth: the noise might make the Hearers past hearing, and being, toge∣ther: Once, those Hellish Cerberi by such preaching, had intended there to haue ope∣ned the mouth of Hell vpon vs, which should haue swallowed our Lawes, our Reli∣gion, our Sunne, Moone, and Morning-Starre (the King, Queene, and Prince) Our fairest Skie of fixed and well ordered lights, then shining in their greatest splendor of Parliament-brightnesse. The Giants of old were said to be the sonnes of the Earth, but these, as they were engendred of Earth, so had they incestuously violated that their mother (whether you vnderstand it in a literall or mysticall sense) and begotten in her wombe this Hell-monster of their bloudie Catholicisme; they had designed the time of her Trauell, and themselues would haue beene the Mid-wiues; the Diuels had bidden themselues as Gossips, and at that opening of the Earthes wombe in her fierie trauell, would haue sent that way into the world (to attend the babe) all the blacke-guard of Hell, Treason, Superstition, Atheisme, Ignorance, Fire, Sword, and all Confusion, in a reuolution of a worse Chaos, then that The words of Moses, Genes.1. interpreted, without forme and void: Tohu and Bohu of old could haue effected. Then should it haue beene no maruell, if Rome, France, Spaine, or any other had exercised tyrannie or cruelty, seeing all must haue come short of the first Cruelty, which our English Catholikes had executed, to open the floudgates of bloud
vnto them. And all this was the Catholike cause, & these the Preachers, or the Vshers rather to the Preachers (for the Iesuites will be angrie if we take from them their blou∣die priuiledge) of this new Catholicisme, which the Diuell (till now he is an older and cunninger Serpent) had neuer learned himselfe, not could learne others, till hee had gotten Ignatian Vshers in his hellish Schoole. But whither is your Pilgrime transpor∣ted? Friend, I draw neere my port, and leauing America behind me, still red with this bloud; now also hauing England in sight, which (as from a greater height) was neere to a more dangerous fall: and in this subiect, which is of the Spanish Cruelties, not written in hatred of their Nation, because they are Spaniards, but of their Pseu∣do-chatholike Religion, vnder shew whereof, they there did, and heere would haue executed those butcheries: and for thankfulnesse to GOD for our later Deliuerance, of which the time when I relate these things (being the returne of that very Nouember 5: day, wherein those things should haue beene effected) iustly demandeth my best testimo∣ny: I haue thus told out my Story. And now me thinkes I see the shores of England, from which my lingring Pilgrimage hath long detained me: I heare the Bells, and see the Bon-fires, with publike acclamations of thankfulnesse for that Deliuerance, all singing their Hallelu-iahs, and saying, Psal.118.24. This is the Day which the LORD hath made, we will reioyce and be glad in it. And now I see a better sight then all my Pilgrimage could yeeld, Christian Churches, without Heathenish, Iewish, or Antichristian pollu∣tions: a Royall King, truely entituled Desender of the Faith: a learned Clergie, wise and Honorable Counsellers; peaceable and loyall Commons; in a word, England presents it selfe to mine eyes, representing to my minde a Map of Heauen and Earth, in the freedome of body and soule, yea where our subiection and seruice is free∣dome (which I haue not elsewhere found in all my Perambulation of the World) I feele my selfe herewith rauished, and in a ioyfull extasie cannot but crie out: Matth.17.4. It is good for vs to be heere (in the true Church and Suburbs of the true heauen): Heere then Reader, let me rest mee, till I see whether thy kinde acceptation of this, will make me willing to accept another and neerer (but harder) European Pil∣grimage. Trin-vni Deo gloria.
