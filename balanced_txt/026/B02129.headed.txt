The Kings Majesties Speach, To the Parliament; Conveaned at Perth, The 25 of November, 1650. My Lords, and Gentlemen; IT hath pleased him, who ruleth the, Nations & in whose hands are the hearts of Kings; by a verie singular Providence, to bring mee thoâˆ£row a great many Difficulties, unto this my ancient Kingdom: And to this place, where I may haue your, Advyce, in the great Matters, that concern the Glory of GOD, and the Establishment of my Throne; and that relate to the Generall Good, and Common Happiness of these three Covenanted Kingdoms; over which hee hath set mee. And truely, I can not express the hight  that Joy, wherewith ee hath filled my Soull, from this singular. Experiment of his kyndness, non how strong and servent desyres, hee hath created in mee to evidence, my thankfulness, by studying to reygn for him and with an humble & just subordination to him; That which increasseth my hope and confidence, that hee will yet continue to deall gratiously with mee is; That hee hath moved mee to enter in Covenant with his people, (a favour which no other king can clame to;) And that hee hath inclyned mee to a resolution by his assistance, to liue and die with my people, in the defence of it. This is my Resolution, J profess it before GOD and you: And in testimony hereof, J desyre to renew it in Your presence; And if it please GOD to lengthen my days, J hope my actions shall demonstate it: But J shall leaue the enlargement of this; And what so der J should say to my Lord Chanceller; whom J have commanded, to speak to You at greater length: And lykewyse, to inform You of my sence: Not only of the folly, but the sinfulness of my way-going from this place, and the Reasons of it. GOD SAUE THE KING
