A few short ARGUMENTS Proving that 'tis every English-man's Interest as well as Duty, AT ALL TIMES To endeavor the absolute and effectual Repeal of all the Religious Penal Laws and Tests, now in force against Catholics or Dissenters, so as they may never more be revived, and the rather because thereby Liberty and Property may be better secured, than at present they are. MOST of the Authors who have Written for the Repeal of the Penal Laws and Tests, tho' they fall short of the end they aim at in convin∣cing their Adversaries, are yet too tedious for the generality to Read, and too difficult to be understood by their perplexing and obscuring the matter with divers collateral Controversies little to the point in hand, which briefly and yet plainly is comprehended in these two following Positions. First, That 'tis every Mans Duty as a Man, and every Christians, tho' they should suffer by it, to endeavor the Repealing of the said Penal Laws and Tests, how good soever they may be esteemed in themselves, so long as any tho' never so few, upon the account of Religi∣on, are aggrieved by them and refuse to take them. Secondly, That if we please, no more Danger nor Damage, than we are at present subject to, will ensue to either Person or Party whatsoever in England by the said Repeal, in either Life, Liberty, Limb, Estate, or Privilege. If then it appears by the following proofs that we ought to Repeal them, and that it may be safely done without dammage to any; It is hoped there is scarce a person so ignorant, obstinate, or imprudent in England, whe∣ther Conformist, or Non-conformist but will readily concur in such a work, tho' there were no other advantage to themselves but only their compliance with His Majesty in a settlement he so much desires; which may be the less doubted because the necessary conse∣quences are general Quiet, by every Mans security and Interest to preserve it, the en∣larging of Trade, the strengthening the King and Kingdom against Foreign attempts: In short, Ease and Riches with Liberty of being as Religious as we can or please. To prove then the first Position, there may be instanced that Golden and Everlasting Rule of God and Nature, To do as we would be done unto: If we fear a future Impositi∣on from others, let us not impose at present our Tests and Penal Laws upon others, but so provide that none may impose or be imposed upon: But further as Christians we are ob∣liged to do no Evil that Good may come on it, to Pray for our Enemies, and tho' former∣ly some may upon the score of Religion have been by others evil treated, yet must we re∣turn
good for Evil and so heap Coals of Fire on the Head of our Adversaries, the only lawful Revenge permitted Christians; and this is a Duty from which none can be exempted before God or Man: To which may be further added, that the said Golden Rule is both a higher Law and greater good than our Test and Penal Laws are, and that 'tis as much a sin both against God and Nature to break the foresaid Natural and Gospel Rules, by afflicting a few, as if we injured multitudes, for an Erroneous Conscience or unbelief only. But secondly, we may by new Laws be as well if not better secured, in every particular circumstance, than we now are by the Penal Laws and Tests; so that 'tis our interest as well as our duty, for which some Specimens follow, which may without question by the Wisdom of Parliament be higher improved. First, If His Majesty should please to consent to such Expedients as may be propounded in Parliament, to prevent for the future all false returns of Members to serve in Parliament, this would be a much better security than any yet provided, the Penalties be the same or the like as those of the Test, both for the Offending persons returning, returned, and assisting. Secondly, If no person be suffered to Enter either Houses of Lords or Commons, or any Civil or Military Employ, until he hath renounced the principle of Persecuting any for Reli∣gious Worship sake be it what it will, and likewise subscribes to undergo the Penalties al∣ready prescribed by the Test, if ever he moves or concerns in the repealing this new Magna Charta of Liberty: This is still much better security for every Religious party than any now in being. Thirdly, If all the Ecclesiastical Dignities and Preferments be by this new Law firmly Establish't to Conformists only, which now are but very precariously in the Possession of the Church of England, they will be thus much better than now they are, because they keep the same Possessions and Profits by a stronger Title, and are only deprived of a Power to do mischief. Fourthly, If all this be consented to before the Old Laws against Catholics and Dis∣senters are Repealed, or together with the same; what hazard do we run, or how is it possible the Catholics can do us any more hurt than at present, or obtain the whole or greatest share of the Government? Fifthly, Nor would it be the least security to the Nation to have such an Engine de∣stroyed as the Penal Laws and Test are, which at some time or other may by the subtilty of the Lawyers Innuendos and Explanations be converted by the Government against any party whatsoever that displeaseth them, and the safety and satisfaction we now have by the Repeal of the Statute de Heretico comburendo may incourage us to Damn all of the like nature. Lastly, If this settlement prevents such mischiefs to the Nation, as desperation may inspire into a party not backward to preserve themselves, it will be a further Collateral se∣curity to the whole.
