A MEMORABLE EMBASSY TO THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN The Earth and Sea con∣stitute a round Globe.FRom the round Shadow which darkens or eclipseth the Moon, the different Rising and Setting of the Cele∣stial Luminaries, and the various Elevation of the Zenith, or Vertical Point, infallibly demonstrates, That the Earth and Sea making one Body, presents exactly the Figure of a Globe: Which though the Surface of this mighty Ball be rough and gibbous, ma∣ny parts thereof swoln into Rocks and high Moun∣tains, others sunk into depressed Valleys, yet make an even and smooth Circumference: for the highest Tops and lowest Descents are nothing in comparison to the Magnitude of this vast Body, but seem less than Warts on the Hand, or small Furrows in a Plough'd Field. Incircling this our Terrestrial Orb at an unmeasurable distance, sparkle the innumerable Lights, in the immense expansions of the Firmament. The Description of Hea∣ven and Earth.About the Earth, the Air spreading it self into three Regions, dispenseth from the middle, all sorts of Meteors, with their several Effects upon us. The lowest Storie variety of Birds and flying Fowls make their Receptacle; the Sea and Rivers, Fish inhabit: but the Earth and Sea, and all Creatures there residing, the Creator left solely to the gubernation of Man, under whose Command they remain, so inverting the Authority of Power, placed the Mi∣crocosmus over the Macrocosme, the little World to Rule the great. The distribution of the People upon the Earth.But since the Fall of Adam, his Generations persisting, more and more in∣creasing their enormous sins, and louder-crying offences, brought Gods just Judgment upon them, who therefore destroy'd the Old World by an Inunda∣tion or general Deluge, onely preserving eight Persons, who descending from the Ark, the Waters being ceased, a new World began; in which by degrees
their numerous Progeny so multipli'd, that they were forc'd to Plant fresh Colonies, still more and more remote from the Foot of the Mountain where they first settled. But nothing more help'd to the well and equal re-peo∣pling of the desolated Universe, than the confusion of Tongues, which hap∣pen'd in the Worlds Infancy at Babel, where all the Children of that Genera∣tion resolving to settle, not minding farther Discoveries, pitch'd upon the fertile Plains of Shinar; Here must be (say they) the Center of our growing and intended Empire; this our begun, this our stupendious Work, whose aspi∣ring Tower looks down already upon the Clouds, and hereafter threatens to scale the Skies, shall be the mighty, and all-commanding Head of our Impe∣rial City, which extended over these Plains, we will inhabit, and with our Lives and Fortunes guard and maintain. But they in their vain Design and presumptuous Project, were suddenly baffled by Divine Providence, who in stead of setling, scatter'd them over the face of the Earth: for when they were at the busiest, and in the heighth of their expectation, labouring to finish this marvellous Structure, thus the Almighty disappointed their whole endeavours, all Tasks were suddenly thrown aside, each mistaking, not understanding one another; in which confusion their onely comfort was, to meet with any that spake with them the same Language: These using one Tongue, gathering in a Body, stuck together, and in several Companies fled to strange and unpeopl'd Regions; where Planting they flourish'd, and suddenly grew up to be several great Kingdoms.Since call'd Europe, Asia, and Africa, the then onely known Countrey. So this their total rout, and flying to all the Angles of the Universe, proved for the better, each by this means being sooner suppli'd; so extending by degrees their fresh Colonies to the utmost and Maritime Coast. Yet however, one Party after this dissolution remaining still upon the Spot, which though they utterly sleighted their begun Tower, leaving it to ruine and decay, yet went on chearfully with their chief City; where Nimrod first taking the Title and supreme Authority upon him, sat in his new erected Throne, first Monarch of the Assyrian Empire. Besides him, many absolute Princes were thus in process of time establish'd in their several Dominions, and the whole World seem'd to be once more totally replenish'd. When the restless Nature of Man, either unsatisfi'd with what he hath at∣chiev'd, or spurr'd on by ambition, or urgent necessity, to enlarge their Bounds for their supernumerary Swarms, gave the beginning to the Iron, or turbu∣lent Age, War and Hostility raging every where, in which those prevailing, grew high and mighty, those conquer'd, low and humble, continual vicissi∣tudes and fluctuations of People, Kingdoms subverted in Republicks, and Common-wealths, weary of such Government, turn'd again into Monarchies. The weakest Party, put to all extremities, and worst of exigencies by the pur∣suing Enemy, were enforc'd, all Land deni'd them, venturing for refuge into the wide Ocean, were soon swallow'd up; some driven they knew not whi∣ther, lighted on uninhabited Countreys, there beginning new Plantations, and perhaps, by such Fugitives the new World never heard of by antiquity, became of old to be peopled, and by that means grown since to such vast Empires, as our late Voyagers have discover'd. Here it will not seem amiss to give you an account, according as all Writers have it, how this our Old World was peopled, viz. Asia and Africa, and who were the Fathers, or chief Captains, giving Denominations to the People, and setling them in their several Plantations, beginning with Holy Scripture.
The Offspring of Japhet.Noah and his three Sons, Japhet being the eldest, his Offspring spread them∣selves over Asia and Europe. Moses recounts these to be the Sons of Japhet, Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras: Gomer, as they say, first settled his Colony along the Caspian Sea, where Strabo and Pliny place the Cemerians; the Sons of Gomer being Ashkenaz, Riphat, and Tagorma, Planted other Colonies, Ash∣kenaz laying the Foundation of the Kingdom of Media, which others contra∣dict, supposing that he settled in the lesser Asia; others, the Countrey of Hessen, or Saxony, but out of what Records we know not; and Eusebius, where ere he hath it, calls Ashkenaz the Father, or first Prince of the Gothes, whil'st the Mo∣dern Jews make him the Planter of the Teutonick Nations, or High-Dutch, and the transplanted Seed of Riphat into more Northern Regions, gave Denomina∣tion to the Riphean Mountains beyond Scythia, which afterwards took in Pa∣phlagonia. From his third Son Togarma, sprang the Togarmians, who sat down on the North-side of Canaan, beyond Cappadocia: but it appears by the Chalde Paraphrase, that Togarma peopled Germany; and the Jews affirm, that the Turco∣many, or Turks, are also sprung from the Togarmians, whereupon still the Turkish Emperor is by them call'd Togar. But Magog, Japhets second Son inhabited Coelesyria, Mada, and the Territory of Media. Javan, the third, was Father to the Ionians, who in process of time, growing great with other conjoyn'd Nations, call'd themselves Greeks, their Countrey Grecia. From these the Latines drew their original: whereupon at first, a great part of Italy was call'd Greece; and still several Names of Italian Cities do undeniably shew the Extract of the La∣tines from the Greeks, which the antient Writers affirm, by making Javan to be the Bifronted Janus, signifying Father both to the old Greeks, and new Latines, descended from him. The Sons of Javan were four, Elisha, who Planted in the Islands of the Mediterranean Sea; Tarshish, from whom Tarsus in Cilicia bears the Name; and Kittim, a Place in Cyprus, where between the two utmost Points Thro∣nus and Dades, in the Entrance formerly stood the City Kittim; and still the Point Dades bears the Name of Cape Chiti. Dedanim, Javans youngest Son, possess'd that part of Eperia, where the City Dodona was renown'd famous for the Oracle of Jupiter Dodoneus, presaging by tinckling Brass Instruments, or Cymbals, and also from the oraculous Oak it self, which (as they say) spake from its hollow womb, giving Responses. From Japhets fifth Son sprang the Tubaleans, afterwards call'd Syrians. Others, according to Josephus, set themselves down in Spain, (so believ'd) because the antient City Setubal in that Kingdom retains Tubals Name. Meshechs Progeny steer'd their Coast towards Arabia. The Antients differ in no thing more, than settling the Habitations of Tiras, Japhets youngest Son: Jose∣phus affirms him to be Father of the Thracians, in whose Countrey Pliny and Mela delineate the River Atira: Others transplant him to the European Sarmatia, ac∣cording to Ptolomy, sprinkled with the Stream call'd Tyras, and at present Nester: Some make Tiras the Builder of Tyre in Phoenycia; again, some of the Duringi∣ans and others, of Thurium, a very antient City in the entrance of Tarentine. The Progeny of Shm.Thus far Japhets Successors: next Sems, that is to say, Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram, did overspread Armenia, Persia, India, and the farther Eastern part of Asia: But especially Elam is acknowledg'd to be the Father of the Ela∣mites, from whence the Persians proceeded, extinguishing by their firm esta∣blishment of their sole Dominion, the first Name of Elamites. Ashur Founded within the built City Nineveh, the Assyrian Power: formerly the Heathen Histo∣ries bring these down from Ninus. Concerning Arphaxad, Moses saith thus:Genes. 10. And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. And unto Eber were born two sons: the name
of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brothers name was Joktan. And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobah: all these were the sons of Joktan. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Shephar, a mount of the east. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. Benedictus Arias Montanus ascribes particularly these Distributions to every one of the Children of Joktan, that is to say, to Almodad, the People of Themeotes, according to Ptolomy and Mela, transplanted into the Asiatick Sarmatia; to Sheleph, the Selebians; to Ha∣zarmaveth, the Sarmatians; to Jarka, the Arachosians; to Hadora, the Hircanians; to Uzal, the Oxiaenian Bactrians; to Dikla, the Scythians, within the Mountains of Imaus; to Obal, the Obolites, between the top of Caucasus and Paropanisus; to Abi∣mael, the Imaenses, where the renown'd Imaus hath very high Precipices; to Sheba, the famous Saces: yet others think it more advisable to bring the Sabeans to Sheba, bordering on the Persians; Ophir, call'd The Territory of Ophir, whether Solomon every third year set forth a Fleet to fetch Gold from thence. Yet after all the Distributions and Sprinklings of Mankind over the surface of the Earth, much of it confirm'd by many Authors, and also by sacred Writ, our Mo∣dern Geographers, and late Travellers, hardly make out scarce two Parts of three of the Terrestrial Globe to be yet inhabited, all the Antartick, and most of the Artick Regions, an unfrequented Desolation, and Africa and Asia full of unpenetrated Desarts, and inaccessible Mountains, and many Isles: Of which several were discover'd by the Antients, and since by our Moderns, not thought worthy the labour of Cultivation, amongst which our Japan lay a long time Fallow, till by a necessitous Calamity a few miserable Exiles, be∣ing (as they say) banish'd from their Countrey, were enforc'd to Plant there; which from such poor beginnings, and unwilling undertakers, hath insensi∣bly by degrees in few Ages, shot up from nothing, to be a most Potent and formidable Empire. But before we proceed any farther in this our intended Design, concerning a Description and Relation of Japan, (of which the Hollanders are most able to give the best account) it seems not amiss, raising our selves a little from our Seat, to look round about, and by an easie Prospect take a brief and general Survey, not onely of the new Art of Navigation, but also of those famous Na∣vigators, that boldly first adventur'd to unloose (though thought unpossible before) the Virgin Zone of this our Terraqueous Globe; so not onely finding undiscover'd Parts of the East, but also a new Western Indies, abounding in Gold and Silver, as the other in Silk and Spices; besides, giving us a farther account of a third Continent (though yet unknown) equivalent to either of the former. The Compass by whom found.The Loadstone, or Magnet, whose several Vertues, and wonderful Opera∣tions, being well known through many Ages; yet that it was a Terrella, or little Earth, having Poles respecting the North or Southern Points of the Firma∣ment, having imaginary Meridians and Parallels, being the greatest wonder, and of most use, was not found untill Flavius Melvius a Neopolitan discover'd it, about two hundred years since, to the great benefit of Mankind, and perfecti∣on in Navigation; before which without Compass or Chart, the poor Sea∣man, when stressed with Weather, the Sun and Stars, his onely Pilot, Night and Day muffl'd in Clouds, he crept along the Shore, which was the constant practice, or emboldned by the signs of fair Weather, ventur'd farther into
the Offin; their condition was most miserable, not knowing where they were, which way to Steer, or from what part of Heaven the Wind then blew: As in Virgil Aene. lib. 3. After our Ships so far had left the Coast Till all the World, but Sky and Sea was lost, A sable Cloud with Night and Tempest rose, And th' Ocean rough with horrid darkness grows; Inraged Winds make raging Waves more fierce, And through vast Floods us every way disperse; Whil'st Fleeting Tempests muffle up the Day, All Heaven becomes to Gloomy Night a prey, Perpetual lightning breaks from broken Clouds. Drove from our course, we wander through Dark Floods, Nor Palinurus knows, in such a Sky, Day from the Night, or whither he should Ply. Three Sun-less Days, as many nights we were Wandring through dismal Fogs, without a Star; But the fourth Dawn, we rising Land behold, And far off Hills, which misty Clouds infold, Sails struck, we row, our lusty Seamen sweep The azure Pavement of the briny Deep. Postquam altum tenuere rates, nec jam amplius ullae Apparent terrae, coelum undique, & undique Pontus: Tum mihi caeruleus supra caput adstitit imber, Noctem, hiememque ferens, & inhorruit unda te∣nebris, Continuo venti volvunt mare, magnaque surgunt Aequora: dispersi jactamur gurgite vasto. Involvere diem nimbi, & nox humida coelum Abstulit: ingeminant abruptis nubibus ignes. Excutimur cursu, & caecis erramus in undis. Ipse diem, noctemque negat discernere coelo, Nec meminisse viae media Palinurus in unda. Treis adeo incertos caeca caligine Soles Erramus pelago: totidem sine sidere noctes. Quarto terra die primum se attollere tandem Visa, aperire procul monteis, ac volvere fumum. Vela cadunt; remis insurgimus: haud mora, nautae Adnixi torquent spumas, & caerula verrunt. So that now, by the help of the Needle, our Modern Navigators often run safely that in ten days, which Aeneas, Ulisses, and other Antients Navigators, still fearing Shipwrack, made a ten years pudder of. And lately, by the help of this great additional, the Compass, they were able to say, By your leave, taking a long farewell of Atlas, and the Herculian Pillars, fix∣ed, and looked upon as eternal boundaries of the West and South, both to Em∣pire and Navigation, and boldly ventur'd to Plow the unmeasurable bosom of vast and unknown Seas; so with a steady Course night and day, dark or light, fair or foul, with an unwearied patience, slighting all dangers, raising new Stars, and setting the old, till they happily finish'd their long Voyages; some of them compassing the World, Girdling the Universe, making the utmost East and West joyn hands together. Thus they have, in a manner, accurately Surveigh'd the New World, Ame∣rica, inspecting it from Coast to Coast, from the East to the Western Ocean; and Magellanica, the last or unknown World, though they have not so penetra∣ted as the former, yet by Sailing the skirts of its extended Border, they Cal∣culated, by the largeness thereof, to be no less than another third part; so baf∣fling the opinion of the Antients with a finis, that were so stupid to sit down contented with the onely knowledge of a third part of the whole world. How Columbus came to the knowledge of a new World.The first Neptunian Hero, or great Sea-Captain, who had the prime honour of discovering the West-Indies, was Christopher Columbus, a Genoese; who having Marry'd in Portugal, settled in the Maderas: He being ingenious, and naturally much addicted to Novelty, still hearkening after new Projects, as well to sa∣tisfie his own Inclination, as to improve his Fortune, by chance in his Travels fell acquainted with Marcus Paulus, a Florentine, not onely a Physician, but a great Naturalist and Student in Philosophy; who finding his humor, highly
treated his curious and inquisitive disposition, with then suppos'd imaginary Stories, first discovering to him Antipodes, and making out by rational demon∣strations, that the great Celestial Luminaries, where not idle nor hudwink'd up in their absence from us, and our privation of light; nor as the antient Po∣ets tell us, that Phoebus when setting, descended into Thetis Lap; so all night, quenching his Horses fiery Fetlocks, swimming under water, till drawing near the East, he with reflected Beams colour'd the Golden Port-holes of the Dawn. But that these great and Resplendant Lights sprinkl'd, and chear'd with fe∣cundating Rays, in alternate Day, so blessing other places, that were no less than inhabitable Worlds with happy fertility, making evident, that the Earth was not round and flat like a Trencher, as other old Writers affirm'd, but Or∣bicular and hung Self-poysed, surrounded not onely with Air, but the vast expansions of the Sky. But whilest he ruminated and revolved such Notions in his Working Fancy, so it hapned, that a Vessel Bound for Africa, was driven quite from her inten∣ded Course by extremity of Weather, and many days tossed up and down in the wide Ocean, far out of sight from any Land; and at last having spent all their Provision, in a most miserable condition put in to the Haven of Madera, where the Captain and his whole Crue being utterly Famish'd with long Fast∣ing, and past all recovery by Refreshment, soon after dy'd. But the Master, whom Columbus had taken to his House, in the time of his Sickness, related unto him wonderful Stories, how he had been driven on strange and altoge∣ther unknown Coasts, being by his Calculation Westward, and so far off, that he suppos'd never any European had seen; and withal, bequeath'd to him after his Death his Journal Papers, of that his so much unfortunate Voyage: who soon after Dying, Columbus with great earnestness perusing the Writings, found what confirm'd him, as if he had been there in Person, and also gave him great Instructions of directing his Course to New Countreys not yet discovered. After this, he rested not long, till he put in Action what might promote his Business, that by the help of a better Purse than his own, he might Purchase Wealth and Honor by this his new and great Design. Proffers his Service to the King of Portugal, and the King of England.First he address'd himself to the King of Portugal, whose Maritime Countrey being opposite to his intended Discoveries, made him (as he supposed) fittest for the Undertaking; who altogether declining it, he sent his Brother Bartholomew Columbus into England, there to make his Address, and Negotiate with King Hen∣ry the Seventh, concerning these Discoveries; who famous for his great Abi∣lities and Prudence, he suppos'd the onely Prince in Christendom to imploy him in so great an Enterprise; but such was his Misfortune, that he was taken by Pirats, and kept by them (wanting Ransom) a long time close Prisoner; so that he came too late to the Court of England: For during his Captivity, his Brother Christopher Columbus made Application to Ferdinand and Izabel, Kings of Castile and Aragon, who then in very low condition, turmoyl'd in a great War, against the Granada Moors, did not hearken to his Proposals. Thus Columbus and his Cause lay seven years quite neglected; but when these Princes, had by their several happy Victories subdu'd their Enemies, he then in the beginning of the Peace, and first halcyon after so long a Storm, re∣new'd his Business, and mov'd the Court of Spain once more: The King and Queen then, though low, and their Treasure exhausted with the late Wars, yet began to listen to him, and at last were so much perswaded, that they took up
seventeen thousand Duckets upon Interest, with which they Rigg'd and Fur∣nish'd him out three handsom Vessels. With which Columbus well satisfi'd, set Sail Septemb. 1. Anno 1492.Columbus set Sail 1492. first direct∣ing his Course to the Canary-Isles; from thence stood full West with a Trading Wind into the great Ocean, where he soon after, met with no ordinary Storms or Huricanes, Winds blowing from all the Points of the Compass, which sad∣ly ruffled and shatter'd his Vessels: next falling (which Block prov'd to him worse than Aesop's Stork) into continual Calms; for there his Men growing sick and weary with lying so long at Sea, Mutiny'd, and despairing ever to see Land, nothing would satisfie them but a speedy return to save their Lives whilst their Provisions lasted: He thus put to it, was inforc'd to promise them, that if they discry'd not Land in three days, he would perform their desire. So it happen'd, that at the appointed time they saw Westward near the Hori∣zon, sprinkling Clouds, by which sign he overjoy'd, bidding them be of good comfort, and told them they should soon see Land, which accordingly they did; and soon after came to Anchor on the Coast of Florida, where Landing,Discovers Florida. taking some short refreshment, help'd by the Natives, he took a survey of the neighboring Countrey, and the adjacent Isles; and whilst he barter'd Trifles for Gold, and other rich Commodities, he took possession of the Countrey, by raising of a Fort in his Royal Masters name; in which, leaving forty eight Spaniards, Commanded by Diego Arana,Returns home. he departed thence Fraighted with great Riches, and ten of the Indians. Soon after arriving in Spain, he was receiv'd with great joy, giving a good account to their Majesties of their success, with which they were so well plea∣sed, that they furnish'd him out again; then he discover'd the great Isles Hi∣spaniola,Discovers Hispaniola and Cuba, and also Nombea De Dios, and Panama. and Cuba, and the bottom of the great Bay of Mexico. Thus Christopher Columbus finish'd fourteen years in several Expeditions, disco∣vering the West-Indies. Americus Vesputius, set forth by the King of Portu∣gal, to make a farther Dis∣covery of the West-Indies.Mean while, the fame of these his grand enterprises stir'd up, invited many other Sea-Captains to raise their Reputation, and better their Fortune in like manner; amongst which, Americus Vesputius a Florentine, was employ'd by Emanuel King of Portugal, who making larger Inspections along the Continent, got the denomination of those vast Territories, the West-Indies, now call'd America, though Christopher Columbus was the first Discoverer. Henry the Fourth, Son to the King of Portugal, disco∣vers new Countreys.But before we go on any farther with the business of Spain, we shall give you a brief account of the Portuguese; who mean while, or rather before took up the Art of Navigation, and became Sea-men, following their new Disco∣veries to the South and Oriental parts of the World: Their first Undertaker be∣ing the young Prince Henry Duke of Visco, second Son to Henry the first, King of Portugal, the eldest being Heir Apparent, and well provided by Patrimony and due Right of Succession to the Crown of Portugal after his Fathers decease, the younger Brother being of a high and magnanimous Spirit, was ambitious; if so, it might be, the enjoying of his Native Land, Birth-right had deny'd him, to raise his Fortunes at Sea, which who knew, but might prove equivo∣lent to his Brothers Kingdom; and also encourag'd to Study the Art of Navi∣gation, by several Learn'd Persons, who assur'd him by clear and many de∣monstrations, that there was much Land that might prove of great concern, altogether yet unknown, and especially in the South beyond Maretania, which could not be penetrated by Land, by reason of the vast and unpassable Desarts
and excessive heat; but finding those Coasts by Navigation, they might make a deeper inspection of the whole African Continent. His first Voyage was be∣yond Mount Atlas.Resolv'd upon this, he put in action what with mature judgement he had design'd; and getting all things ready, furnishing some Ships for that pur∣pose, set Sail in the Year 1410, and Steering on, was the first that sunk Mount Atlas lofty Crown under the Horizon, being till that time the Terminary, or Ne plus ultra, of all Southern Navigation, discovering beyond the Mount three∣score Leagues off the Coast of Africa, and so return'd, but with mean success. But not altogether daunted, ten years after having replenish'd his stock, de∣sign'd for such Adventures, he fitted out another Fleet, under the Command of Johannes Gonsalvez, a good and expert Sea-man, who first ventur'd to loose sight of Land, and Sail into the Main Ocean, where he, though encountering many Storms, prodigious Tempests, cross Tides, and unbridled Currents, yet bore up couragiously, and fighting his way through all Weathers, and other Incumbrances, reaching four hundred and twenty Leagues beyond Atlas; where weary and over-power'd, at last by such grand Opposers, viz. Winds and Tides, contented himself with the honour of so great a Discovery, return'd. These names they gave them at the first Discovery.Thus this Prince in forty Years, Discovering the Maderas, the Isle Porto San∣cto, Cape de Verd, and the Coast of Guinee; and having the honour of opening the Bosom of the Southern Sea, and making the Portuguese Navigators, being of a great age, he died in 1463. Alphonso the fifth disco∣vers the African Coast.After his Decease, the whole business of Navigation fell, and the Sea lay Fallow, unploughed by the Portuguese twenty years, when Alphonso the fifth, King of Portugal, taking hold of so well begun, and long neglected a business, the second time revived the Art of Navigation (though much against the pre∣sent humor of the People) strenuously went on: First Sailing beyond Cape de Verd, finding the Island of St. Catherine, and settled a constant Trade, which came to a good account with the Negro's in Guinee. He dying, John the second succeeding him, went on with the Work, and set out Jaques Canus,Discovers Congo. a good Sea-Captain, who first discover'd Congo, and Sailing up a River, penetrated much of the In-land thereabouts. When stirr'd up much by the rumor of Christopher Columbus's Expedition, employ'd by the King of Castile, the fame being spread over all Christendom, am∣bitious to match what Spain could do in the West with his Southern Expedi∣tion, being so well prepar'd already by their former Voyages, with great Cost and Care,A Voyage of Bartholo∣mew Diazio. he set forth Bartholomew Diazio, who Coasting Africa, reach'd at last the great Southern Point, which indeed was the Work, if he had understood it, and made right use thereof; but there being disanimated by mutinous Mari∣ners, and stress of Weather, giving a bad Epithet to the great Point, calling it Cabo Buyig, or Cabo Boyie, because there he was stopt, and soon after forc'd to re∣turn yet his wiser Master understanding it better,Cape of Good Hope, why so call'd. nam'd it Cabo de Bona Espe∣ranca, that is, The Cape of Good Hope. A strange Voyage of a Franciscan Monk.But whilst Diazio Rid before the great Southern Cape, a Franciscan Monk, call'd Anthonio, his intimate Friend, incited by a strange curiosity, Landed there, and ventur'd alone to seek his Fortune in so vast and unknown a World. I tell this Story, though not so pertinent, because of the wonder, that one Man should be so hardy, to venture his single Person, to travel through Countreys so full of Heat, Drought, and Desarts, and Peopled with such as he could nei∣ther
understand, nor they him; but thus he went, not onely through all Africa, but a great part of Asia, reaching to Jerusalem, there paying his Devoti∣on, he return'd to Lisbon, giving the King an account of his miraculous adven∣tures. Upon this the King bethought himself of a less chargeable way than Rig∣ging a Fleet, which could onely discover the Coast; to which end he employ'd Pedro de Cavillano, and Alphonso Payva, both skilful in the Arabick,A wonderful Journey of two Portuguese. as private Pil∣grims, to make Inspections of those Countreys, which were yet to them un∣known. They first came to Naples, then touched at Rhodes, after visited Egypt, and saw Grand Cair, from thence to Jerusalem; here paying due Tears to the ho∣ly Sepulchre, they parted, travelling several Ways, Payva for Ethiopia, where he died; and Cavillano to Ormus, so to Calicut in India. Here he receiv'd Messages from the King his Master, not to return till he was able to give him a good ac∣count of Africa: Thus commanded he ventur'd into Ethiopia, where the King of that Countrey became his great admirer, much taken with his Person and Parts, inviting him to dwell in his own Court, and offering him, if he would Marry, a Lady of great Fortune, and Noble Extract. From the Emperors Palace he made means to send a Letter to the King of Portugal, in which he inform'd him at large both of the Asiatick and African Countreys; and amongst the rest, described the City of Calicut, and gave a Character of the Inhabitants, who, he said, were of a swarthy, and of an Ole∣vaster Complexion, scarce knowing ought of humanity or civil address, unaf∣fable, irreligious, and ignorant of all Moral Vertue: they are proud of going naked from the Middle upwards, onely above their Elbows they wear Arm∣lets of Pearl, and a Simiter in a Belt hangs thwart their Shoulders; and about their Middle they wear Skirts, or long Bases of Purple-Silk, richly embroi∣der'd with Gold. Here the Female Sex are allow'd Polygamy, one Woman may Marry as many Husbands as she pleases, and those which enjoy the greatest number, are esteem'd there the most Noble, so there is no priority to their Children by Birth, none knowing well their own Father, but either they are all Co-heirs, or else her Sisters Children Inherit. That the Natives of Ethiopia were all Blacks, and a kind of Christians, but mix'd with an allay of Judaism and Mahumetan; and how the Emperor maintain'd a great standing-Army, to defend his Dignity and Territories, which were very vast. Emanuel King of Portu∣gal is earnest to make far∣ther Discoveries of Africa and India.Soon after this Information, King John died in the Year 1495. Emanuel suc∣ceeding him, and willing to go on with the Work of Discoveries, advised with his Peerage, what was best to be done in so high a Concern: His Council con∣sisting more of private than publick Spirits, who aim at Grandeurs, and the general good, first looking upon the difficulty, danger, and great Charge, then considering as to the Honor and Profit, they had gotten enough by the Disco∣veries in Africa already, and it were meer madness to take upon them more than they were able to perform: for sending fresh Ships and new Colonies to Plant remoter Countreys, would weaken the Kingdom, and disable their Navy, neither would these new-found Lands turn to any other account, more than to maintain those that settled there: these and the like they alledged. The publick-spirited Party, which were, and are commonly the fewest in all great Consultations, convinced them in all their Arguments, saying, That they had no cause to complain of the Honor and Profit which the Nation had already gotten in their first Discoveries, but that it should rather encourage them to proceed. The King's Treasure being better suppli'd, and the whole
Nation much employ'd, and more enrich'd by this their foreign Trade, and should they neglect what they had so happily begun and undertaken, they would not onely lose their Expence and Pains, but the whole Affair would in time by degrees moulder away to nothing. And if we should wave such hono∣rable Enterprises as these, who would attempt (discourag'd by our example) any Business that had the least face of difficulty or danger? Thus the business being highly debated, the King hearkned onely to those of his Council who advis'd according to his judgment and inclination, and with all diligence speedily set forth four Ships, well appointed with Soldiers, Sea-men, and all other Necessaries, making Vasco de Gama their Admiral, adding his Brother Paulo, and Nicolao Celio for his assistance; who set Sail on the tenth of June, Anno 1497, follow'd with great sorrow, cries and tears of the Adven∣turers Wives, Children, and their nearest Relations, being possess'd with a prejudice, that the Voyage was so long and dangerous, that they should never see them again. Having weigh'd Anchor, first they directed their Course to the Fortunate Isles, from thence to the Hesperides, and having clear'd Cape de Verd, they steer'd more Easterly till he lost all sight of Land, and lay engag'd in the wide and open Sea three Moneths together, when in ten Degrees of Southern Latitude Land appear'd, towards which he made with all possible speed, and soon an∣chor'd in the Mouth of a pleasant River, where Landing he found some of the Natives, whose Hair was short and curl'd, and they of a swarthy Com∣plexion, were naked, who never knowing what belong'd to Commerce, nor having seen any Strangers before, they made but small Traffick with them, onely trucking Spikes, and several sorts of Nails for Cattel and Fruit. Gama call'd this Place St. Hellens Bay, and the River falling in it, St. James River. Being thus refresh'd, such was then their Courage, that weighing, they re∣solv'd never to touch again, till they were clear beyond Cabo Bona Esperanca; but here they were so vexed and pusl'd with almost never quiet Weather, that they not onely despair'd of performing their Expedition,Are in great danger. but also of their Preservation; the common voice and complaint of the Sea-men was, That they run themselves like blind and mad Men to their utter ruine: This despairing fancy of theirs was more and more fermented by the continuation of still vex∣ing Storms,The Sea-men would re∣turn. especially having lost all hopes of return to see their Native Countrey, Wives and Children any more. But Gama on the other side labor'd to appease and encourage them, saying, That truly noble Souls slight all dangers, and that whatsoever they had once undertaken they would never let go, nor be baffl'd or deluded with any fear, in what face soever it appear'd: but now the worst was past, the hardship in a manner over, and after a long Race they were now ready to seize the Quarry, so purchasing not onely immortal Fame for the wondrous Atchievement, but also Riches, which would both supply their present necessity, and make them and theirs for ever. But they were deaf to all perswasions; and stubbornness, mix'd with a general conster∣nation, had so block'd up their Ears, that they in stead of inclining to the ad∣vice and encouragements of their Admiral, seeing he would not hear of any return,Conspire his Death. they conspir'd his death, concluding that it were better for one Man to suffer than so many: This Combination of theirs his Brother Paulo disco∣ver'd, and several of the Crew and Masters were brought in question, and se∣cur'd, whilst Vasco taking the charge of the Helm himself, and trusting none, Steer'd, though still charged and affronted with stirring Weather, till at last he
SEFALE doubled the great Southern Cape, not stopping till he ran fifty Leagues beyond, where he found a Bay, which he call'd St. Blasius;Discovers nv Coun∣treys. in the middle of which lay an Isle, where Landing they met with some of the Inhabitants, not unlike those where he had touched lately before, onely they cover'd their Privacies with a Shell fitted for that purpose. From hence, having refresh'd themselves, they Sail'd on, but making little way, being ruffl'd often with foul Weather, hollow Seas, and a contrary Cur∣rent, still running Westward: yet at last they reach'd the Confines of Zangue∣bar; which he so call'd from the Name of that Saint, and soon after cast An∣chor before Sofala, the chief City of that Countrey;They come to Sofala. where he found the Inha∣bitants more civiliz'd: who thought themselves very gay in Copper Hoops, or Rings, which they wore as Bracelets and Armlets, and proud of Daggers with Cotton Hilts, using a Language altogether unknown: but one of the Towns-men spake Arabick, by whom they understood, that a white People in Vessels like theirs, had traffick'd with them formerly. Vasco de Gama had ten Convicts, or condemn'd Persons in his Fleet, sent by the King, who sav'd their lives, to be put ashore where the Admiral thought fit, there to wander and seek their Fortunes, and if they liv'd, to make Obser∣vations of the Countrey, and learn the Language, which hereafter might, come to some account: two of these he turn'd ashore, leaving them there for that purpose: Mean while, staying a Moneth at Sofala, a great Sickness hap∣pen'd in the Fleet, from the alteration of Diet, which before was scarce and salt, now fresh and plentiful, of which many died. To Mosambique.The next start he made was to Mosambique, a rich City, famous for Trade and Commerce, situated in a small Isle under fifteen Degrees of Southern La∣titude. Here the Merchants and Citizens went all in Sattin, embroider'd with Gold, and wear great Turbants of fine Linnen, Simiters hanging across their Shoulders, and in their left Hand a Buckler, who being thus Habited, came in
small Boats aboard the Admiral, who civilly and kindly treated them; where Discoursing, they told him, That their King was call'd Abraham, and was the sole Monarch of Mosambique, but under him his Xeque, or Lieutenant, Govern'd the City, That he was call'd Zocacia. Gama soon after, conversing and being amongst them, got so much in theirs and the Deputies favor, that he obtain'd two Pilots, who undertook to carry his Fleet safe to the East-Indies; which kind∣ness of theirs arose from a mistake, supposing them to be Western Saracens: but afterwards understanding that they were Christians, all this sweetning and good will turn'd to rancor and hatred, the Pilots first repenting, abhorring to do any thing for Unbelievers, leapt over-board, and so swimming to Shore, deserted the whole business. The Portuguese being troubled at this high affront, conceiving their relinquishing of them was influenc'd from the Town it self, brought all their Guns to bear upon them,Fires at the City. which discharging, they hurt and slew several of the Inhabitants, insomuch that Zacocia was forc'd to call a Council; who there resolv'd to send him another Pilot, which had also pri∣vate instruction, in stead of carrying them to their designed Port, to betray and deliver them up to the King of Quiloa, making them believe that they were Abyssine Christians, who would kindly receive, and furnish them with all sorts of Provisions. This treachery they willingly undertook, out of malice and detestation they bore to Christianity. Thence weighing Anchor, Gama hasted with a fair Gale to the Port of Quiloa, suspecting nothing, to his utter ruine, which was there decreed, as before mention'd, when Providence, being now ready to enter the Mouth of the Harbor, sent a terrible Storm, but indeed a friendly one, which in spite of all his endeavors, Tacking to get in, drove him at last back into the Offin, and so much to the Leeward, that by his trea∣cherous Pilots advice, and they willing to save their lives, steer'd his Coast to Mombaza, a City, or rather a Fortress, being built on a Rock impregna∣ble, almost Moated round about by the Sea. Here Gama having no sooner dropt his Anchors, but the Inhabitants, delighting in Novelty, came flocking in great Companies aboard, who entertain'd them with all civility, whilst the Pilots, not forgetting their treacherous Design, inveigl'd the Inhabitants, having the advantage of the Tongue, first telling them that they were Christi∣ans, and that they would do God and their Countrey good Service, besides their own private benefit, being able to over-power them, to seize their Ships, and sacrifice those unbelieving Dogs. Thus concluding, they inform'd one another, going from Ship to Ship, as if upon curiosity and pleasure, resolving to put in action what they had thus concluded, when the Decks were more fill'd with the Inhabitants. This matter was the easier to perform, because one of his Ships he had burnt already, being not able to Man her, losing so many in their last great Sickness. But Gama not liking his Anchorage, being too much within, and too near some Rocks, if he by stress of Weather should chance to drive, sud∣denly, upon better consideration, gave order to weigh, and to Anchor, as he suppos'd, in a fitter place to Ride in, and to moore his Vessels. A Plot against Gama discover'd, and by what means.Now the Saracen Pilots, seeing an unexpected hurry amongst the Sailers, busie to and again about their Tackle, bending to Sea-wards, thought their Plot discover'd, and that they were carrying them clear away, leapt suddenly over-board, muttering they were betray'd, the rest of the Natives, taking the Alarm, as soon follow'd them, Diving under Water like a Flock of Sea-Fowl, not appearing till they were out of Musquet-shot, rejoycing they had so esca∣ped.
But this Rout was not so sudden, nor were they all so ready in making of their escape, but that he took thirteen Prisoners, and also carry'd away with him two of their Vessels that lay near him;Gama takes two Vessels. amongst which he found an expert and honest Pilot, who first truly inform'd him, that the City Melinde was not far distant from thence, being almost under the Equinox, and that their King was an affable Prince, receiving all Strangers with great civility. The Admiral Gama being thus encourag'd, and believing the Pilots report, follow'd his di∣rections, Steering streight on for Melinde, where they found (though a Saracen) his Relation to be true. The Melindian King having withdrawn himself, being old, from all pub∣lick Address and Business, sent a handsom Present, as a token of Amity and true Friendship, by the young Prince his Son; and soon after provided him an excellent Pilot, who conducted his Fleet in twenty days safely to Calicut in the East-Indies. Description of Calicut.The City Calicut lies on the Coast of Malabar, and though it boasts no Haven, or any safe Harbor, and yearly much troubl'd, especially in the latter end of May, with foul Weather, and overgrown Seas, raging with sudden and often violent Heuricanes, yet by its great Commerce and Trade, is a famous, rich, and well peopled Seat. It happen'd that the Portuguese arriv'd there in the midst of this their turbulent Winter, getting within two Leagues of the City; and soon after, there being a short intermission of Rain and Tempest, the In∣habitants being able, came aboard in nimble Skiffs for that purpose, and Gama, hoisting out his Pinnace, went ashore with some chosen Men, carrying ano∣ther of the foremention'd condemn'd Persons along with him; who being turn'd loose to seek his Fortune, and distinctly habited from the rest, the People flock'd about him, amongst which happen'd to be two Merchants of Tunis, one of them, whom they call'd Monzaido, being well experienced in the Spanish Tongue, and hospitable, took him to his own House, and afterward proffer'd all service and kindness to the Admiral Gama, himself discovering the Condition of the Countrey, and Inclinations of the Inhabitants. Whereupon Gama sent this Merchant, with two others joyn'd in Commission, as Envoys to their Emperor, or Zamarin, who besought from Gama, that he would per∣mit them safe Landing, that so he might present him Letters from his Master, the Great King of Portugal, which contain'd Matters of great consequence for the general good, especially desiring an everlasting League of Amity and Peace. How Gama was enter∣tain'd.The Zamarin, or Emperor, at that time resided in Pandarana, a small City two Leagues from Calicut; where Gama's Ambassadors had Audience, and their Request without any scruple or dilatory demurs presently granted them, ta∣king it a great kindness and honour, that he had made his Address on such an amicable purpose. The Emperor also out of meer kindness advis'd them to come to Anchors under Pandarana, there being a safer Harbor to protect them against the sudden violence of the Weather, and that also there he might the better, being so near in Person, establish the Overtures of the King his Master. And presently after he lent his prime Pleasure-Boat, call'd Catuales, from Pan∣darana, to fetch Gama in fitting State to his Royal Palace. But Gama,Gama goes to the Em∣peror, but not without be∣ing very circump ct. who by late woful experience was grown cautelous, considering the worst of what might happen, chose twelve of his stoutest Sea-men to attend him as a Guard, and some of his own Boats to wait ashore for his return, and left the charge of his Ship to his Brother, with Instructions, that if any mischance should be∣fall
him, which might detain him there, or otherwise, that he should speedily hoise Sail, and carry the whole Relation to his Master the King of Portugal. At that time these Indians had neither Horses, nor other Cattel to carry Men or Burthens, so that Gama was convey'd to the Palace in a Sedan. In the Way he was met by some of the Emperors Attendance, all Cloth'd in fine Linnen, who, employ'd for that purpose, march'd orderly before him to the Palace, and then conducting him by the Hand through several Anti-Chambers and Rooms of State,The description of the Zamarin's Palace at Calicut at every Door and Entry standing ten of the Emperors Guard. He entred at last the Presence, which was very large and stately, the Floor co∣ver'd with a rich and costly Stuff, interwoven with Silk and Gold, the Walls hung with more rich and curious Tapestry; round about upon ascend∣ing Steps, on several Thrones, all Princes, his Privy Council sat. The Empe∣ror, or Zamarin himself, clad in white Cotton, embroider'd all over with Golden Roses, ty'd up with handsom Knots, rich with invaluable Oriental Pearl, lay supinely at his ease, leaning upon his Elbow, on a most glorious Couch, wearing a Hat, which rather resembled a Turbant of Massie Gold, deckt with inestimable Jewels, sparkling like Stars; a great part of his Arms and Legs were neatly Hoop'd about with weighty Golden Rings, which being Buckl'd sat close; his Toes and Fingers Were cover'd with Jemald-Rings, and Armlets, set with Diamonds: Near him stood an Officer with a flat Plate cover'd with Betel, an Herb which the Indian Princes continually chew, whose Vertue keeps always a sweet Breath, and better than drinking allays Thirst, correcting Crudities, freeing the Stomach from all Qualms, and the Head from melancholy, disaffecting Vapors. The Zamarin being of a black and swarthy Complexion, his Body, tall and burley, his Limbs large and brawny, (for his Arms and Legs were naked) shew'd enough in Counte∣nance and Person, the Majesty of a King. Gama's Discourse to the Zamarin.Gama being commanded to sit, by an Interpreter declared first the occasion of his Address to his Imperial Majesty, that he was sent from his Royal Master the King of Portugal, in his behalf with Salutations, and to kiss his Hand, who endeavor'd, being a great Prince himself, to make amicable Leagues, and everlasting Friendship, with all other Foreign Monarchs wheresoever, and in the first place with him, hearing of his Majesties many singular Vertues, Magnificence and Fame, spread to the utmost Confines of the Universe, he also commanded a Fleet to be Rigg'd and set forth under his Conduct, who now having spent much time, passing through many dangers, an unmeasurable Way, toss'd with all Winds on a turbulent Sea, at last being happily Landed at this long desired Port, and having receiv'd the extraordinary honor and favor of this his publick Hearing and Address, he in the King of Portugal's Name, humbly proposes what he so much desires, that is, not onely an establishment of a well-grounded Peace, and friendly Correspondency betwixt the Princes, but also that his and your People might drive a constant Trade and Com∣merce, which might equivolently redound to the good and profit of both Nations. Thus saying, with a submiss and comely Posture he deliver'd his Letters, written in Arabick and Portuguese, with several Presents, which though not cost∣ly, yet their Novelty was such, that the Emperor was strangely taken with several of them, growing to that kindness thereupon, that he proffer'd him all Friendship,The Zamarin shews Friendship to Gama. promising him of his own accord whatever he desir'd: and then being more inquisitive, entertain'd himself by enquiring of his King, what
manner of Person, and the like, then of his Countrey, what, and where it was, and how far distant, desiring to know of his strange Adventures in his so long a Voyage thither: To all these he gave him a brief and handsom account; which no less pleasing, the Emperor caress'd him with a sumptuous Banquet after their manner; both Parties being extremely satisfi'd, Gama departed. The fame of this Negotiation was next day all the News through the Ci∣ty, all sorts of People for the most part well approving of what they heard, onely the Saracen Merchants, who were many, and there residing, drove a great and profitable Trade from thence to other Parts; they hearing of this were strangely surprised, being much troubled, lest the Portuguese should break in upon them, and carry a great part or all of this their rich Traffick into their own Channel; nay, this would not onely be destructive to their Estates, but also to their Religion, which is very catching, by this means introduced, might prove fatal to many of their Souls. The Saracen Merchants incense the Zamarin against Gama.These upon a double score, love of Profit, and hate of Christianity (to which they bore an inveterate malice) the next morning the primest of them ga∣ther'd together, and went to the Palace with a ready Speech prepared, to draw an odium upon the Portuguese; who having ready admittance, their business by their looks and behavior appearing to be serious, and of no small concern, they humbly shew'd to the Zamarin, how that these Strangers, who had in a manner surpris'd his Majesty, having no other information of what they were, or their Condition, but from themselves, were indeed not so, and that they had told him nothing but Lyes, for they were able to make out, that they were a Crew of Roving Pyrats and Robbers, and declar'd by their actions common Enemies to all humane Society; and that their King, if they had one, was a petty Prince, far off in the West, who not able to enlarge his nar∣row Territories upon the adjacent Countrey, sent these Hectoring Desperado's through all Seas, to make Booty of what they could either get by Wheedling, down-right Cheating, or the Sword: And if his Imperial Majesty be so plea∣sed to grant them a free Trade and Commerce, that then they would, being so enforc'd, leave Calicut, this their settled Staple, and seek Trade elsewhere, which sure would not redound so much to his Majesties benefit, who had so long brought in their Customs and Duties, a certain and great Revenue to the Crown, which they by no possible means, if they deserted the Place, could in many years make the like, or any considerable Return. Thus the business was agitated, and the Emperor inform'd by both Parties. The Malabars contrive to make away the Partu∣guese.When the Malabars, being by Nature fickle and treacherous, not onely per∣swaded by the Saracens how dangerous such alterations would be, but also in∣fluenc'd and encourag'd from the wavering Court, conspir'd, laying a Plot how to dispose of the Portuguese otherwise, by their utter destruction: which was not so clearly carry'd, but that Monzaido, the Tunis Merchant, and a real Friend to the Strangers Interest, scenting the bottom of their Design, inform'd Gama of the whole Intrigue; who being very sensible of the danger, made his escape sudden and privately from the City, that he might the better save him∣self and his Fleet from undoubted Ruine; so setting Sail, he left the treache∣rous Harbor for his security, where Cruising at Sea,Their Plot is spovl'd, and Gama falls upon the Malabars. he met with an Indian Vessel, standing in for Pandarana, a safer Port than that of Calicut, where the Emperor had formerly advis'd Gama to, by whom he sent Letters to the Za∣marin; wherein he gave an account, that he was enforc'd for his safety to leave his Harbor, and trust the Sea, a Plot being laid, to take away, not onely his
Life, but to seize his Ships, and make Prize of all he had; and that some had so poyson'd his Majesties Ear concerning them, gracious to him before, with lying and scandalous Tales, and other false Aspersions, that he would not ven∣ture any further Commerce, nor have to do with such a fickle and not to be trusted People; therefore desiring, That such Goods as he had there left ashore, might speedily be sent aboard, and he would not trouble his Majesty nor them any further. But the Zamarin excusing himself, laid the fault on his corrupt Officers and Attendants, who were already tryed, and condemn'd to suffer, condign Pu∣nishment. But whatever his Excuses were, there was no Restitution, and the Goods lay still as Confiscated for the Emperors Use; at which Gama being justly in∣cens'd, resolv'd by Reprisal to make up his Loss: And soon after he seiz'd on a Malabar Vessel, by chance standing into Calicut, in which were six Persons of Prime Quality amongst them: Thus the Emperor being enforc'd to release those Prisoners of so much esteem, deliver'd up all those Goods which Gama laid claim to, sending with them also an Answer to the King of Portugal's Letter. In the mean time Monzaido the Tunis Merchant (his Kindness towards the Portuguese being discover'd) made his Escape from the City (where he fear'd no less than Death, and Confiscation of all he had) for his Safety, to the Fleet; whom Gama receiving with all Civility, carry'd him after to Lisbon, where he (a Convert) receiv'd Baptism, and lived there, being turn'd a Christian, Ho∣norably, and in good State and Condition, many Years. But the Zamarin looking upon this as a high Affront, to be force'd thus to his dishonor to exchange Goods for Prisoners, and to be brought to Capitula∣tions, onely three Ships opposing his Mighty and Absolute Power; would not thus sit down, nor take it so; although his own Navy, by which, nay, with a small part, he might have vindicated his Cause, which were there then, by reason of the Annual Tempests hall'd ashore, and could by no means possible be suddenly Launch'd; yet with wonderful dexterity he Mann'd out sixty Boats, with stout and expert Soldiers, who were so Order'd and Commanded, that they were able to destroy and Swallow them all. He flying, and they pursuing, and just ready to lay him aboard, twenty to every Ship; so it pleased Providence, to befriend him with a sudden Storm, which parted the Fray; they being routed, and forc'd, not without danger, ingloriously to return; and Gama coming clearly off, loosing the sight of Cali∣cut, Steer'd his Course directly home,Gama returns home to Portugal. and in something more than two Years compleating his Voyage, Anno 1499. he Anchor'd in the Haven of Lisbon, where he was receiv'd with great joy; being the first (to his Eternal Fame and Honor) that with an undaunted Courage, passing so many imminent Dangers, found a Way by Water to the so much desir'd East-Indies. After Gama's Return, of whom the King had receiv'd sufficient Information concerning the Profit and Advantage which might be made by the East-India Expeditions, did so much encourage him, that he fitted out thirteen Ships, Mann'd with 1500 Mariners, and 500 Soldiers, under the Command of Pedro Alvaro Caprales, who had strict Order, That he should endeavour by all means to make a League of Amity and Friendship with the Emperor of Calicut; and to request the Liberty of Raising a Fort there, to the end they might there settle their Staple of Merchandise: Which if the Emperor should refuse, nor
would be drawn to by any Perswasions, then to endeavor to force him to it by Arms. Thus having receiv'd his Instruction and Commission, he departed with his Fleet out of the Haven of Lisbon, and Steer'd the same Course to St. James Island, as Gama had done before. Then he Sail'd more Westerly, and fell at last on an unknown Coast, which he call'd Holy-Cross-Land, since Brafile; where Landing, and finding it a fruitful and rich Soil, he cast up a Fort, and sent Gaspar Lemius back to Portugal, to inform King Emanuel of his New Discovery. And leaving the Charge of the New Work which he made there; to some choice Men that he took put of the Fleet, with all Necessaries to maintain it, he departed, directing his Course towards Calicut. But in the way he rancountred with such Storms, that he lost four of his Vessels; and glad he came off with no greater damage, Steer'd directly for Cali∣cut, where soon after he arriv'd. Where the Zamarin dealing also treacherously with him, they fell at vari∣ance; but Caprales play'd his Game so well, that he forc'd the Zamarin to pay him double the damage of what his Losses came to: So returning with mean Success, he arriv'd in the Haven of Lisbon, Anno 1501. The same year Emanuel plying his Business, set forth three other Ships, under Johannes Novius; who meeting with Caprales, now in his way homeward, telling him of the fickle and treacherous behavior of the Zamarin of Calicut, quite dis∣courag'd, supposing such his Labor would prove in vain, return'd with him: So that that Expedition signified nothing. Notwithstanding all these Rubs and Discouragements, his being still more and more out of Purse, and all his Endeavors turning to no account, but only feeding as it were vain Hopes; yet not one jot discountenanc'd, he went on strenuously, and set out the year following a second time Vasques de Gama, with ten Ships, conceiving by his well-experienc'd Conduct, he might be more for∣tunate, and might at last set a better face upon the whole Affair; yet he re∣turn'd with little better Success than the former had done: But howsoever, the King went on, and would not be daunted, setting forth Vincent So∣derio, next Stephano Gama, then Alphonso and Francisco Albuquerque, and after Gundissalo Coelio, with several Fleets; all which return'd but small Audits, in lieu of his vast Expences. But at last, considering the whole weight of this high Concern lay only upon his Shoulders, and some few of the Nobility; his Merchants and Private Traders, and the whole Body of the People, not at all concern'd: Neither seeming willing, then, or at any time, to be ingag'd, either in their Purse, or otherwise; he bethought himself (observing the Nation to be naturally Super∣stitious, and much inclin'd to hearken to Prophecies, and such Follies of know∣ing Future Events) of a way, a subtile Artifice, to catch the whole People, or at least the Richer sort, with a new Device, or Royal Trepan, which was thus effected. Hermicus Cajadus, a Learned and Famous Poet of that Time, being not only witty in his Art, but ingenuous, and trusty to carry on a close Design, King Ema∣nuel privately employ'd: They contriving together, what the King dictated, the Poet set down, and soon after at his leasure put it in Verse, and with as cleanly Conveyance, got the whole Matter ingraven in ancient Characters, upon three Stones; which done, he buried them on the Sea-shore, near Cape Rocha Decin∣tra, which were there to lie till Emanuel gave the Word. The day being ap∣pointed
for the Discovery, Hermicus, the better to carry on the Kings Business, invited several Friends, Persons of Quality, his Neighbors, who dwelt there∣abouts, to a Treatment at his Countrey-Farm; where when they were merry, amidst their chang'd Dishes and turn'd up Bowls, one that he intrusted, brought him strange News, which was, That where he had been digging for Stones to finish his Worships new Wall, they had found three Stones, with Inscriptions upon them,A strange Discovery. which neither he, nor any there present knew one Letter of; and sure must be of some wonderful Signification. At this they all started up from the Table, left their Feasting, and running immediately to the Place, gaz'd upon the Marbles, all admiring the strange Characters, but none understanding a Tittle thereof; reckoning by the worn and almost de∣fac'd Letters, That the Stones must have lain there many Ages. Soon the fame of this was spread through all Parts thereabouts, which came at last with great wonder to the Kings Ear; but he shew'd himself more amaz'd and strangelier concern'd than the Relater; and very earnest suddenly to see and know what they might signifie, straight commanded the Marbles to be brought to Court. The King then viewing them with greater astonishment, with much ado a good while after got them to be Read and Copied out, finding them to be a Prophe∣cy of Sybilla, to this effect. Sybilla vaticinium Occiduis decretum: Volventur Saxa Literis, & ordine rectis. Cum videas, Occidens, Orientis opes, Ganges, Indus, Tagus, erit mirabile visu; Merces commutabit suas uterque sibi, Soli aeterno ac Lunae Decretum. Sybil foretells Joy to the Western Shore, When Stones are found, with Letters graven o're. O West, when thou the Eastern Wealth shalt see, Indies and Tagus shall Admirers be; That all Parts open'd, Traffique entertain, Where-e'er Suns rise and set, Moons wax and wane. And order'd them to belaid up in his Treasury, as Holy Reliques, signifying by their Preservation, as the Palladium to Troy, the Safety, Good, and Utility of the Nation; clearly demonstrating, That the Portuguese, being the most West∣ern People, should be them, that by their Conquests at last should Command over the remote East-Indies. The Cheat thereof.This strange Discovery not only spread through Portugal, but was more than Table-talk through all Christendom; and the Inscriptions every where Copied, and Translated into their several Languages, and many Learned Com∣mentators glossing, and giving the same Opinion thereupon, That the Portu∣guese were onely destin'd for that Business. Thus by deceiving of his People, they were undeceiv'd, and brought to a right understanding of the Benefit that would accrue both to him and the whole Kingdom, by a vigorous Prosecution of the Grand Design, so lately and well begun by Vasco; in pursuit of which, they might without question make themselves Masters of the vast, and yet unknown Territories of the Ori∣ental World. Thus, and by this Superstitious Means, the Work went forward on all Hands, every one striving to be foremost, and to joyn their Stocks together, to carry on the Design; By which enabled, the Portuguese first conquer'd Goa, and there settling their Staple, from thence penetrating every way, they got seve∣ral Footings, making themselves by Conquest Masters of many considerable Places, Conquering whole Kingdoms, bringing from thence a World of Trea∣sure, and also drove the first Trade in our Japan.
Now leaving the Portuguese, with their Voyages and Discoveries in the East-Indies; it seems not amiss, nor altogether impertinent, to peruse the remain∣ing Navigators, that sought Adventures Westward in America. Next to Ame∣ricus, of whom we have formerly spoke, was Vasco Nunno Bolboa, a stout and expert Captain, who adding to Columbus his Discoveries, Anno 1513. first found the Straits of the Bay of Mexico, between Nombre de Dios and Panama; and (pas∣sing the Isthmus) the great Southern-Sea, verging both the East and West-Indies. Hernando Cortis takes Mexico.Next Hernando Cortis, not onely a Voyager, but a Conqueror, with a great Fleet and considerable Army Landed at Mexico; who with a few Spaniards, and the help of the Claxcallans, Natives, and inveterate Enemies to the Mexicans, Conquer'd that vast Empire, Peopled with Millions of Men, for the King of Spain, Anno 1520. and entring the great City Mexico, took their Emperor Monte∣zuma Prisoner in his Palace: But the exceeding Glory of this Action, and Ho∣nor of this mighty Conquest, he but a short while enjoy'd; for in the height of his Hopes and Bravery, looking out of a Window, about to appease some of his then mutinying Spaniards, a Stone hit him by chance, of which Wound, though not mortal, he soon after died. Francisco Pisaro conquers Peru.Five Years after, Francisco Pisaro, another Voyager and Conqueror, seiz'd a second Empire, being the large Territory of Peru, in the Name of Charles the Fifth. But of this he was not so soon Master, spending six Years in finishing so great a Work: yet at last he took Prisoner their King Atabalixa, who, though he us'd him not very civilly, brought him the greatest mass of Treasure that ever was heard of in one Booty since the Creation; for all the Utensils of the Court, from the Scullery and the Kitchen-Boards, to the Royal Table, were all of massy Gold; insomuch that the meanest Private Soldier shar'd no less than nine thousand Ducats, besides whatever was embezell'd away. Gets an invaluable Trea∣sure.Here Pisaro's Part was such an infinite Sum, that Arithmetick would scarce find Figures for it; the Revenues of which, improv'd by Good-husbandry at Use, might have made him the richest Person in the Universe; and if he so pleas'd, he might have easily set himself up a new Emperor, had he not been defrauded of the most part of his new acquir'd and vast Riches, by Almagro, one whom he most trusted, and his chief Companion and Confident. Spaniards kill one ano∣ther at Peru.This close Conveyance and grand Cheat of his was not kept so private, but Pisaro had intelligence of the whole Fraud; and from thence the Diffe∣rence grew so high betwixt these former Friends, that Love turning to Ha∣tred, they as Enemies stood upon their Guard. In this Contrast, and tu∣multuous gathering of Parties, Ferdinand Brother to Francis Pisaro laid a Plot, suddenly surprizing Almagro, who being not able to make his Defence, was slain: But Diego, Almagro's Son by an Indian Woman, being hot upon Revenge, like a bold Assassinate stood not to make close Contrivances, but at high Noon entred the House of Francis Pisaro, and amidst his Friends dispatch'd him: And soon after Gonsalves, Pisaro's Brother, slew Diego; who then Command∣ing All, deserted the Emperor Charles the Fifth his Master, and assum'd the Go∣vernment upon himself; which he not long enjoy'd: For the just Authority of the Emperor being carried on with great Discretion by Peter Gasca, sudden∣ly overthrew his ill-grounded Government, real Right prevailing over imagi∣nary and usurp'd Regality; such Grandeurs belonging only to Princes: Thus the Usurper being defeated, the Emperor was repossess'd. Whilest Castile and Portugal were thus busi'd, following their Fortunes, and several new gotten Interests, one in the East, and the other in the West-Indies;
enlarging their several Territories, till they at last began to Clash and Inter∣fere; and also the Portuguese then looking with an ill eye on the Golden Fleeces, rich and mighty profit that Spain brought from the West; the Spaniard on the other side, as much grugding and repining at their new and great Trade of Spices, which the Portuguese fetch'd from the East, furnishing in a plentiful manner all Christendom, which turn'd to no less account, as they suppos'd, than their Gold, when also a great discontent and no small difference arose, not easie to be reconcil'd. The Portugal laid his claim to all new Discoveries, being the first that broke the Ice, and open'd the way for such adventures; and withal, challen∣ged what ever was found, not onely in the East, but also in the West-Indies, by his Commission and Patent granted him by Pope Eugenius the Fourth, and Sign'd by his whole Consistory. But Spain on the other side produc'd other Letters, Sign'd by Pope Alexander he Sixth; in which his Holiness expresly Conferr'd upon his Majesty, in con∣sideration of the Promulgation of the Gospel, that might be by his means spread into many unknown Countreys, all that lay Westward beyond Cape de Verd, being on the main Land of Africa, the Meridian of the Isles Hesperides; so all on the other side, to the South and East, he Decreed for Portugal, and in∣deed not improperly, because so lay their business, and both being possess'd of the same Division before. Thus the Controversie being setled by the Court at Rome, that Castile might not meddle any further in Eastern; nor Portugal, with Western Discoveries, which both parties agreeing to, observ'd the Orders. Ferdinand Magellanus Sails about the World.Till Ferdinand Magellanus, one that had serv'd a long time under Alfonso Albu∣querque, in the East-Indian Expeditions; for which being not rewarded ac∣cording to his Expectation, and as he thought he deserv'd, bearing a private grudge, on this account against King Emanuel, making his Address, proffer'd his Service to Charles the Fifth;How it happen'd. telling the Emperor, that if he were pleas'd to Employ him, he would undertake, without the least breach of his Holiness Commission, by a Western Course, to find the Molucco Islands, and so make him absolute Master of the Spicy, as well as the Golden-World. He considering the great profit of such a Trade, and also by that means to lessen the Portuguese Commerce, by taking from them such a yearly Revenue, accepted of the proffer; and in the Year Fifteen hundred and nineteen, set him forth with five stout Vessels, all well appointed for a long and new Expediti∣on; leaving Sivill, he first directed his course towards Brasiel, from thence Coasting on, till he reach'd 53 degrees Southern Latitude; here he discover'd those Straits, which from his name are call'd Magellan: In the Mouth of these, one of his Ships Founder'd striking on a Rock, another of his Vessels weary, and horribly disgusting the Voyage, Weighing Anchor, stole from thence by night, and ran away directly back to Sivill. But Magellanus, passing with many difficulties these unknown Straits, open'd at last the great Southern Ocean; where also suffering much by foul weather, he came to the Island Subus, where he, and several of his prime Officers going a Shore, where invited by the Natives farther into the Countrey to a Treat∣ment; who having gotten them at such an advantage, suddenly, expected Feasts,Magellane murder'd. turn'd to bloody Banquets, and there amidst their Merriment, by the Salvages, they were all barbarously Murder'd. Those few that escap'd the Massacre, not able to Man three Ships, were
necessitated to burn one of them, being the worst; so they prosecuted their intended Voyage to the Molucco Islands; here Anchoring before Tedor, they took in their Lading of Spice, which they so long had sought for. And from thence Steering homewards, one of them receiving so great a Leak, could not possibly be sav'd by all their endeavors, but that she sunk down-right with her whole Fraight, and so rich a Burthen;Of five Ships, onely one returns home. so that of five Sail that went chearfully forth, return'd (that being so crasie) scarce one; which after three years, and so long expectation, enter'd the Haven of Sivill, with a poor Lading of tain∣ted and dammag'd Spices: But however, the name of the Ship and Master that first of all Sailing a Western Course, Girdled the World, deserves to be Registred; the Master John Sebastian Lano a Biscaner, the Ship call'd, The Victory. But now returning to our intended Japan, concerning whose Plantation from a few Exiles, we have formerly hinted, we will now inlarge. Who first peopled Japan.The Peopling of Japan, and first Plantation thereof was from China; as by their own Relations about Seven hundred Years since, proceeding first from a Grand Conspiracy and Rebellion. The time unknown.A great Minister of State, Ally'd and Interessed in a prime Family, though he enjoy'd as much as his Prince, having the whole Government and Dispo∣sure of all things at his pleasure; whilst the Emperor follow'd Ease and Lux∣ury, thought himself unhappy and dissatisfi'd,A strange accident; by which Japan was peopled. unless he became absolute Ma∣ster: This Ambition of his, was for their own Promotions fermented by all his Relations and Kindred, which were very many; So that at last they con∣triv'd a Subtle and Execrable Plot, yet very difficult to carry on; not onely the Death and Murder of the Emperor himself, but of all such of his Privy Council, and others in great Authority, that adher'd not to him, or had on several occasions discover'd their aversness against his too much present Power and growing Popularity. This their damned Contrivance, though close and clandestinely carry'd, and not many intrusted with the bottom of their Design; yet how, I know not, taking Air, a part of their horrid business came to light. Thus being disabled to Work any longer privately in their Mine under ground, whereby at one blow, and in one night they might finish the whole Bu∣siness, they were forc'd to set a fair Face on their foul Intention, by publick Vin∣dication, and wresting the sence of their Black Cause into a better Construction; so first letting loose their Band-Dogs, Fears and Jealousies, recriminating and complaining against evil Councellors, that therefore they were forc'd to stand upon their Guard; and as they call'd it, take up defensive Arms; mean while, the Imperialists being not idle for their safety, aray'd themselves against this their new-raised Militia; So Privy Conspiracy became a Grand Rebellion, and the whole Empire ingag'd in a long Civil War, many great Battels fought with various success; at last the event falling on the right side, the Emperor, by the Victory made more absolute than ever; being stir'd up with just indig∣nation, resolv'd to make them Exemplars by their sufferings, to all that dare leap at the Throats of their Soveraign Princes: First, Setting forth a severe Proclamation, prescribing all, who either were Abettors, or had been actu∣ally in Arms, where ever Detected; so that the whole Empire became a Sham∣bles, blushing with Bloud and Slaughter, by putting in Execution this his se∣vere Decree. When a more moderate Party of his Majesties Council, having also of their Relations amongst them that were in imminent danger, ready to suffer under the Persecution, humbly besought the Emperor that he would
mitigate his Just Sentence with Mercy, and sparing their Lives, onely to Banish the Rebels his Dominions, and suffer them to spend the remainder of their miserable Lives in the Desolate Isles against Corco;Japanners banish'd from China. which he granting, they were transported thither; and as we said before, from a few poor and Male-contented Exiles, began a small Plantation, which in process of time, growing up, is now become a famous and formidable Empire, standing in competition with that of China, and since call'd Japan. Inveterate malice of the Japanners against the Chi∣nesies, and their different cu∣stoms, from whence it pro∣ceeds.Whether this Story be true, or not, we are not able to assert, but that they were a Chinesy Colony, may appear by much of their Speech and Character yet remaining amongst them; and that this Tradition either true or false, causes an irreconcilable Difference, with inveterate Malice against the Chineses, as a people that have unjustly thrown them out of their Native Countrey, taking from them their Rights, Lands, and Possessions. Thus this antient Feud con∣tinuing to this day, they on all occasions fall on their Coast, entring with Fire and Sword, and all manner of Hostility; and also they so much abhor and loath the Chinesy Customs and Fashions, that rather than they would resemble them in their behavior, they have taught themselves such proposterous actions, that they are not onely unlike them, but all the world beside. Customs of the Japanners.First, As the Chineses and several Nations uncover their Heads, or bowing in their Salutation, conjoyn right Hands or imbrace, they stand Starch'd like a Statue, stiff without any Motion; and in stead of uncovering their Heads, they in a cross manner, put off their Shooes; and as they and we commonly rise up in Respect to any Person, entering the, Room, they just contrary, in stead of standing, sit down; and as the Chinesy and other Nations, when they walk abroad put on an upper Garment, a Cloak, Coat, or Mantel, they Disrobe themselves and March in Querpo, putting on their loose Vestments when they come in; and whereas we esteem bright colour'd Hair, and white Teeth, they look upon Tresses as black as Jet, and Ebbony Teeth, (both which they artificially make so) as most Ornamental, and the chief marks of Beauty; and what all Nations agree in, making the right Hand the Superior, and place of most honor, either walking or sitting, that Preheminence they give to the left: and to be clad in black, amongst them signifies Triumphs and Joy, which every where else are the Habits of Mourning and Sorrow, onely White amongst them being the Dress of Loss and Disaster: And so amongst their Women, who when they walk abroad, order their Hand-Maids and Daughters to go before them, whereas ours follow their Mistresses; and as other Women, when with Child, expatiate their bodies by unlacing, to give more liberty to their growing Issue, they on the otherside, contract, impri∣soning the Infant in a narrower Circle,Strangely different in their nature from all other peo∣ple. by pinching and girding closer their swelling Waste, supposing else they should Miscarry with what they go with∣al; and when not impregnated, they give their bodies all scope and liberty; when ours, as much straiter, and bind themselves up to recover, if possible, their former shape and slenderness. They after Delivery, in stead of Swathling and wrapping up the Child in warm Clothes, throw it into cold Water to harden; and in stead of comfort∣ing the Mother with some Cordial Broth, they keep them fasting, not suf∣fering them, a good while after their Delivery, to receive any considerable nourishment. Their manner of Diet is also opposite to ours; whereas we delight in Friends and Strangers at our private Tables, or at least admit Relations and
Concerns to sit with us, never willing to eat alone; they on the contrary have each their peculiar Boards, where they Dine and Sup by themselves in a churlish manner, and serv'd but meanly, are satisfi'd with a slender pit∣tance. A Drink in Japan call'd Chaa, held in great esteem by them.Their Drink is a Concoction made of Rice, which in strength and rellish resembling Wine, they use as if such, often taking men plentiful Doses, that they become inebriated therewith; but for their mornings Draughts, and closing up of their Stomacks after Meals, they onely following the Chinesy man∣ner, drink Chaa, which comforts, and is a great suppressor of Fumes, that rising from the Stomack after great Meals disturb the Head. It is not known how big Japan is, Linscht.The Empire or Island of Japan, if it be an Isle, is not onely one, but many; which evidently appears by those parts that border on the Sea, where the Coast discontinued with many In-lets, stands like a broken Wall, and the several falls of fresh Water Brooks and Rivulets, descending from the upper Grounds, with their mixt interweavings, both from Sea and Land, make a numerous croud of petty Isles: from which watery redundancy, arise Cloudy exhalations, that cause variety of stirring weather; as sudden Winds, cold Rain, Hail, Frost and Snow; yet these mixt changes so attemper the Air, that though under a hot Climate, they suffer not by extremity of heat in their Summer Solstice. This Countrey extendeth it self from 157 degrees to 170½ Longitude, and in North Latitude, from 30 to 38, which makes 810 in length, and 408 English Miles in breadth. Its Eastern borders onely open to the great Ocean; the South lies towards the South-Sea, where great and many Isles lie scatter'd, and make now a new Archipellago. The West side, the Sea intervening lies opposite to the Empire of China: The North-West, but at vast distance respects Tartary: The North bordering on Pedso, onely separated by an Inlet of the Sea, which runs not up above thirty English Miles, where both Lands continuing, stop the course of the Flood, and make one Continent, which Francis Cairon Embassador to the Emperor of Japan, that travelling from the Territory of Quanto, where the Imperial City Jedo lieth North-East, seven and twenty days journey to the Prominent Point of the Kingdom of Sunguar, here Sailing over a Bay or Gulf of the Sea, they came to the Countrey of Jesso, desolate and Mountainous, but full of precious and costly Furrs. The Japanners have often times ventur'd very far in. Jesso, but could never discover the end. The Emperor himself hath so much endeavour'd the knowledge of it, that he sent Persons a purpose to in∣spect and make discoveries how far his Territory extended, and supply'd them with what, not onely might serve their Necessities, but whatsoever might ac∣celerate and make more easie so difficult an Expedition. Teco borders on Japan.Yet after long searching and far travelling through rough and untracted Wilds, sometimes climbing steep Ascents, oft engaged in amazing Precipices, they found their labor in vain, and no end, onely seeing some few Salvages hairy all over with slovenly Beards. The extent thereof could never be found out by the Inhabitants.These beastial People, rather than humane, could neither give any ac∣count of the Countrey Jesso, nor of their own wherein they dwelt; so it evi∣dently appears, that Jesso and Japan are one Continent, but how far Jesso extends Northerly; and whether both may make one Isle, none hath yet in∣form'd us.
Who first Sail'd to Japan is uncertain.Who of our European Voyagers (a new way being found by doubling the great Southern Cape to the East-Indies) first discover'd this Land is uncertain. Some relate, That a Portuguese Ship by stress of Weather, not intending any such Course, was accidently driven upon the Coast of Japan, Anno 1539, but neither tell us the Ships Name, Captain, Master, or any other Particulars; so we wave this account as but a story, and not sufficiently Authentick, to have the honor of the first Discovery. Jo. Petrus Maffeus, and Jacobus Thuanus, Anthonius, Guluamus. Most set down, that it was in Anno 1542.But this seems more credible which Joannes Petrus Maffeus, and Jacobus Thua∣amus attest in the Writings of Anthonius Guluamus, how Antonius Mota, Francisco Zeimot, and Antonio Pexot, in their Voyage Sailing from Dodra to China, were forc'd from their intended design, and driven with an unwearied Tempest on the Confines of Japan; the time being more memorable, because that in that Year 1542 the King of Portugal sent Alphonso Soso, impower'd by his Commissi∣on, with like authority, as if himself were there present, his first Lieutenant or Vice-Roy, to Raign at Goa. But soon after (of which also we have no certain account) the Portuguese by several Casualties and Adventures, got good foot∣ing, and drove a great Trade there, amongst which, this in the first place being of most remark. By what means the Portu∣guese got footing in Japan.A Youth, a Stripling of Japan, being terrifi'd with the hard usage of a cruel Master, expecting upon some occasion a severe punishment, fled; taking San∣ctuary in a Monastery of the Bonsi, amongst them the prime Religious Order; where whilest he skulk'd and kept himself in private, to escape his terrible Lord, it happen'd, that a Portuguese Vessel, Commanded by one Alvarius Va∣zius, touch'd in that Harbor; who coming a Shore, and curious to see No∣velties, viewing this Religious Structure, where whilst he was gazing about, and feeding his fancy, now with this, now with that, the Youth presented himself in a sad Petitioning Posture, signifying to him by signs, that he would be pleas'd to save him a- board his new arrived Vessel from some threatning danger; he taking compassion of him, found out a means to conveigh the Youth from thence, thither that night, where, supposing the Boy not altoge∣ther safe, nor himself neither, put him aboard a Merchant that lay close by him, who was to Weigh Anchor that night; who accordingly set Sail, and car∣ried him to Malacca, whether he was bound with his Freight: The young Ja∣panner in his passage, observing their manners of Worship, and hearing them Chant and Sing at their daily Service, or else mov'd by Divine Inspiration, earnestly desired to become a Christian, as they were; whereupon the Master of the Ship made his desires known to the Fathers, then Residing at Malacca, that he might receive Baptism; but they modestly refus'd, saying, That the honor of it belong'd to the Bishop, Johannes Albuquerken, then Resident at Goa; whereupon he was transported thither, and there with much Ceremony, after Divine Service, he receiv'd in sight of the whole Congregation, Ba∣ptism, and changing his Japan Name Auger, was Christen'd Paul of the Holy Belief. Paul now well instructed in the Portugal Tongue, inform'd Franciscus Xa∣verius, Cosmo Turrensis, and Johannes Fernandes Jesuites (Fathers that had ventur'd their Lives in promulgation of the Gospel, and to make Proselites in those parts) of the whole estate of his Countrey; whereupon, being encourag'd, they Embark'd themselves first for Malacca, and from thence intending their course upon the like service for Japan.
Ariving at Malacca, they met with a Chinesy Vessel, with whom they agreed to Transport them to Japan; all which proceedings, Cluverius inform'd in a Letter to some of their Society at Conimbrica,The Contents of Xaverius his Letter, concerning his Voyage to Japan. and also that they were encoura∣ged by the information of some Portuguese Merchants in Malacca, that Traded to Japan, How that the Seed of Christianity had been already Sow'd there by some of their own Society, and that in a miraculous and wonderful manner, which in brief they related thus: Some Fathers, Portuguese, by chance arriving there, but how he knew not, a Japan Prince feigning Civility to them amongst other Entertainments, pro∣vided them stately and well-furnish'd Lodgings, where when at night expect∣ing to take their repose; the Scene suddenly changing, they were entertain'd with dreadful Apparitions and prodigious Spectrums, horrible Dins and Noise of ratling Chains, Stools, and Cushions flying about their Ears; their Clothes rent and torn off from their Bodies, and themselves fearing in like manner to be pull'd to pieces; which when all their Exorcismes and Prayers not prevail∣ing, they bethought themselves of their last refuge, which was Signing them∣selves with the Figure of the Holy Cross, and scoring them on the Walls and Posts. which so doing, on a sudden all was hush'd, and those terrible Repre∣sentations vanish'd, and all that night after, they , without the least disturb∣ance, rested well till the next Morning; which, when divulg'd about the Town, and that they night by night heard nor saw no more of those Diabo∣lical Phantomes, the whole people were almost perswaded to Christianity; in token of which, and also to keep away the like evil Spirits from their abodes, you might have seen all the Walls and Posts of their Houses every where mark'd with Crosses: Thus they reported. Xaverius Voyage to Ja∣pan.But to return again to Xaverius, and to conduct him in his Voyage to China: The foremention'd China Ship, stood to and again betwixt the Islands, so lin∣gring and loosing time, the Master being never willing to Steer that Course, and besides being very superstitious in his own perswasion, he had his God, a Woodden Idol erected on his Stern, to whom,A Ship-Idol of a Chences. when ever he consulted con∣cerning the course of his Voyage, or what else he desir'd to be resolv'd, he humbly Address'd himself with Presents, Perfuming the Image with Aloes, and Frankincense, and lighting many Tapers; Presenting him with several, Dishes, as Birds, and other light Meats for Digestion, which though it would not eat, yet he took signs and tokens from the Statues looks, though immove∣able, which wire to him Responces of his good, bad, better, or worse success. This, as in other things that are left to chance, happen'd sometimes right, sometimes wrong; but by this stirr'd up, and still following the seeming counsels of his Woodden God , and his own inclination bending him home∣ward: he perswaded Xaverius and the rest of the Fathers so much, that they being weary with lying so long at Sea, consented, and so unanimously agreed, to refresh themselves at China, hoping from thence the better to compleat their intended Voyage: So the Master upon their resolution, Steer'd directly for Canton, but the Wind proving more favorable for Chincher, a Haven further up in the Countrey, and where he dwelt; they condescending, he Steer'd direct∣ly thither, all intending to Winter there; So Sailing on till they came near Couchin, where they were inform'd, that the Pirats had taken the Harbor, and the Wind hindring to go back to Canton, he had no other course left, but was necessitated to Harbor that Winter in Japan, whither standing with a fair Gale, they soon arriv'd at Congaxima, the very place where young Paul was born, had
dwelt,Xaverius lands in Japan. and fled from his cruel Master two years before: Here Xaverius, and the rest of the Fathers Landed, the 15 of August 1549. where they were kindly receiv'd by the Young-mans Parents and Relations; and he himself, though he had deserted the Heathenish Idolatry of his Native Countrey, yet they looked upon him with great respect, because as they accounted he had been now a great Traveller,A Japauner turn'd Ro∣man Catholick, relates what he hath seen in India. and able to render an account of wondrous Novelties, which he had made observation of in Foraign Countreys; every one coming and busie about him, making several enquiries; insomuch, that the whole Town was full of the news; and at last it came to the ear of the King of Saxu∣ma, who being inform'd of it as a business of no little concern, the young Tra∣veller was commanded to attend, where the Prince himself inquisitive, ex∣amin'd him where he had been, and what he had seen, who presently recoun∣ted to him with a good confidence, That he had been in India, where the Por∣tuguese, a Potent and Warlike Nation, come from a strange Countrey, and the utmost Parts of the Western World, had by their Conquest, subduing several Nations, setled their own people in the heart of India, in great and rich Planta∣tions, and were the most formidable, and the onely Terror of the rest of the Oriental Coasts; and that the Countreys about Malacca and God, where they had also setled, either by permission or the Sword, were rich and populous places, whose several Products, by the means of the Portuguese, were become rich Merchandize to the whole Eastern World: Then he demanded of him what persons those were that Landed with him, whereupon he quick and perti∣nently answer'd, That they were also Portuguese, but of a Holy and Religious Order, who by their Examples of Meekness, Zeal, and Sincerity, sometimes back'd by wonderful Miracles, Conquer'd Mens Souls, bringing them to their Belief faster, than their Layety subdu'd their Bodies and Countreys by force of Arms. Whereupon the Fathers were presented to him, who gave at first a fair and indifferent hearing to the Disputation betwixt them and the Bonzy, and others of their Orders: But concerning the Issue thereof, and the Miracles, as they say, wrought by Xaverius, in maintaining the Truth of the Gospel, and there being seconded by many more of their Fraternity; and also the cruel Perse∣cutions which both they and their Proselites went under, are at large describ'd in the Jesuites Letters sent from time to time from Japan, and Printed by the Order of their Colledge at Lyons, Loven, Delingen, and Colen; of which more at large hereafter. But besides those Voyages which the Fathers Xaverius, Cosmus, Turrenfis, and others made to Japan at several times, is also famous the Voyage of Captain Francis Pais, in the Ship de Sancta Cruiz, from the Haven of Macau, in the Year 1588. who gives this account. A Voyage to Nangesaque, by Francoi Pais.We Sail'd through the Straights of Lanton, in six Fathom Water, and Sandy Ground, but the middle of it much deeper; on the Larboard side of the En∣trance, though straight, open'd a Bay, near which the Wind being contrary, blew almost a Storm, yet the strength of the Current so prevail'd, that we made way clearly through. At day break, We discover'd the Island Branco, well known at a great di∣stance by its steep and chalky Cliffs; after that we descry'd the Flat Coast of Loemon, known by its two Promontories on the North-East and South-West end: Then we Steer'd our Coast North-East, where happen'd several great Calms and terrible Thunder and Lightning.
A considerable time we kept in sight of China, about five or six Leagues from the Shore, after that we had Sail'd close by the Islands of The two Sisters, For∣mosa, and also by The three Kings; there appear'd, as commonly doth in those parts, before a Storm, the dreadful signs of an ensuing Tempest,Signs of bad weather. About the Cape of Good Hope, appears commonly a small black Cloud before a Tempest. which was here a Rain-Bowe onely of two colours, hoop'd in with two more, the outmost the largest; the Master being thus warn'd, furl'd his Sails, lower'd his Yards, and dropt all his Anchors, and so in a manner moor'd his Vessel, by which time it blew so hard from the North-East , bringing along a high and rough Sea, which oftentimes rak'd over us from Prow to Stern, that all our Ground-Tackle, though very good, seem'd not strong enough to keep her from Driving: Thus we lay plying the Pump, Shipping often so much Water, as was ready to beat down the Decks, so that we every Minute expected death; and that which was worse, the Wind shifting eight Points towards the North-West, furrow'd fresh Billows athwart, which beat over our Broad-side. Thus ha∣ving suffer'd four and twenty hours the utmost of the Perils, when utterly de∣spairing, not able to hold out any longer, it pleas'd God, that the Weather broke up, and the Storm ceasing, after a short refreshment we joyfully weigh'd Anchor, and proceeded on in our Voyage. And now being got about an hundred Leagues from the Island of Meaxuma, we saw with admiration a great number of py'd Fowls, black and white, by the Portuguese call'd Allcatrasses, which prey'd there on Fish. Before this Island lieth an obscure Cliff, and the Isle presenting it self in four Cantels, or Divisi∣ons, being cut thorow in the manner of a Cross: On the South-West end of it are two round Hills; the other Islands are known by several Rocks, resem∣bling Organ-Pipes; Here Sayling two Leagues along this Coast, to the height of one and thirty degrees; from thence Steering our Course to Cabexuma, which is surrounded by many Rocks, we discover'd the Mountain of Amacusa, and the utmost Point of the Island Cavallos, known by the tall Pines that Crown the High-Land. At some distance off from the shore lies a Ridge of Rocks, which as a Bar breaking the violence of the Waves agitated with Wind, make within a smooth and safe Harbor. Then we found the Bay of Nangesaque, by joyning our Land-Marks together, being a Tree, and the Roof of the great Church, where we Anchoring, Hoysed out our long Boat, and so Landed in Japan. This is our second Discoverer of any note, giving the most exact account of the nearest and best way to Japan. But two years before the return of Pais from his foremention'd Voyage, John Hugh Luschot setting Sail from the Haven of Maccaw, intending his Voyage for Japan: He relates thus; Linschot's Voyage to Ja∣pan.The 19 of June we Weigh'd Anchor from before the Island des Outcas, lying on the West side of the Entrance towards Maccaw, leaving the great Isle of Thieves to Lee-ward, which hath another longer Island full of Woods to the North∣ward of it; and the like shape presents the Isle Tonquiau, being naturally forti∣fi'd with ten Cliffs like Bulwarks, but on the North-East side opens a conve∣nient and safe Harbor: We wav'd Lamon, standing off to Sea at a great di∣stance, because many Pirats lay lurking up and down, shelter'd under those Coasts, their design especially to seize Portuguese Vessels; therefore we Steer'd directly towards the Chabaquon-Head, a High-Land, appearing a far off from the Coast of China; afterwards we Sail'd the length of the Red Stone, Varella, a Rock so call'd , and well known by its colour, which appears above Water, and may be seen beyond Port Chinogoa; Soon after we Stemm'd the Isle Lequeo
Puqueno, whose steep Coasts are about sixteen Leagues in length, under twen∣ty five degrees North-Latitude, where we Sail'd against a Current of trou∣bled white Shells, but after 15 Leagues we found ease: Then rose the Seven Sisters, Isles so call'd, from their so much resembling one another; the first appears with a sharp Spire or rising Point in the middle; and at the foot on the West Angle, a Rock opens like a Column or Pillar; on the North-East, mark'd with a black Cliff. The Seven Sisters out of sight, we rais'd the long Isle Ycoo, full of black or sable Trees; from whence we lay North-East, Sailing betwixt that and Tanaxuma through a Channel, clear from all danger of Rocks and Shelves; At the Mouth of which, appears a Mountain like Vesuvius, or that of Aetna, which vomits upwards hideous Smoke and dreadful Flames, mixt with Stones; the Ruptur'd Bowels of the Mountain, which ejected with no little Fragor, sometimes fills the adjacent Shores, Sea and Land, with terri∣ble Affrights, and wonderful Consternations. But Tenaxuma, an Isle eight Leagues long, hath on the West a good Harbor, fortifi'd naturally with Rocks; the Low-Land full of rising Hillocks, cover'd here and there with black Pines: Eight Leagues Northerly, beyond this ap∣pears the Coast of the mighty Empire of Japan, but in the mid-way, Steering to Jebuxy, we lay a good while becalm'd; yet nevertheless, the eleventh day after we set Sail from Macow, we arriv'd in Japan. But besides all these Voyagers, and the many Discoveries and Plantations of the Portuguese and Spaniards in either Indies, at last the Hollanders being thrust into an exegency of dangerous consequence, and forc'd by an overcoming ne∣cessity, also became Navigators, and undertook (to save themselves from utter ruine) that Work, by a business which happen'd thus; At first, and in the infancy of their Trade, They onely contented themselves with making short Flights, and trafficking to their neighboring Confines, as France, England, Denmark, Norway, and other Places in the Northern Ocean; with which naturally delighted, and tasting the sweetness of Profit, they ven∣tur'd farther to Spain and Portugal, then growing more bold, enter'd the Straights, seeking through the Midland Sea, at Legorn, Genoua, and Messina, what by their several Trades might be more beneficial. Here whilst the Portuguese and Spaniards made such wonderful Discoveries, they fixed and well satisfi'd, sat down and went no farther. The first reasons why the Hollanders undertook the Voyage to the East-Indies, and afterwards to Japan.But after the War was proclaim'd by Spain against the United Provinces, King Philip issuing out strict Commands, that all Goods that heretofore were Export∣ed from; his Harbors, or Imported from the Hollanders, whether the Growth of either Countrey, or otherwise, should not onely be confiscated and made seizure of, but great Mulcts, and other Punishments inflicted upon all them that durst, or were so hardy, as to infringe in the least these his special Edicts, supposing by this means sooner to reduce them to his obedience, which hap∣pen'd quite contrary: for by this time, prosecuting Magellanus's Discovery, Spain had engross'd in a manner the whole East-India Trade, so that his Ports and Harbors were the Staples of Christendom, for all manner of Drugs, Spices, and all other Oriental Growths: Thus the Hollanders being suddenly block'd up, and cut off from so beneficial Traffick which they made with Spain, send∣ing those Commodities which they fetcht from thence through most Parts of Europe, that much astonish'd, looking upon themselves as utterly undone, they began to consider, if any way were possible to be found to deliver them from their imminent destruction; at last, after several Consultations, they be∣thought
thought themselves of a means; for having furrow'd up much of the Northern Sea, knowing as far as Greenland, they believ'd it not difficult to find a new and shorter Way beyond Russia and Tartarie, through the Straights of Anian to Japan, and from thence to the East-Indies, which by surveying the Terrestrial Globe, could not be above a fourth part of that so long Voyage by the great Southern Cape; which if effected, they cast up, that with a quarter of the Charge they might bring the Indian Products to their Doors, and be able to furnish at so much lower Rates those accustom'd Places which they formerly had suppli'd. The first Ships of the Netherlanders endeavor to find out a Passage to the East-Indies behind the North, but in vain.In order to which, Anno 1549, they Rigg'd out four Ships, who Sail'd on according to design, till they encountred with huge Floats, and swimming Castles of Ice; and though they were much troubled, incumbred, and in great danger, yet against all this opposition, they reach'd the heighth of Nova Zembla; but there being no longer able to oppose, the Ice increasing, covering almost all the whole Sea, they were forc'd to return; so this their first Expedi∣tion prov'd fruitless: Yet not disanimated with their first bad success, they prepar'd that Winter, and towards the latter end of the next Spring, when those Seas might be penetrated, seven Ships more, who after sixteen Weeks, being stopt by the same impediments, return'd with the like account into the Maes. Yet though a little troubled with their unfruitful endeavors, they sat not down so, but ventur'd out two Ships more; but this third Voyage prov'd more unfortunate than either of the former, for they lost one of them, being frozen up, and the Company Wintering there, were forc'd to break up their Vessel to build a Cabbin with it on the Shore, where they several Moneths suffer'd by bitter extremities, and a Sunless Skie: the other being much crased and Weather-beaten, was forc'd to return. Thus where they ex∣pected Mare Liberum, or open Sea, they found Mare Clausum, the great Nor∣thern Bays, by which they hop'd a Passage, all blockt up with Ice. Cornelius Houtman the chief promoter of the East-India Expeditions.The usual Way, lately found by the Portuguese, though long and difficult, lay open; upon which, after small consultation, they pitch'd, and lighting on an expert Sea-Captain, Cornelius Houtman, who had been formerly there, and lately for that purpose redeem'd by them from the Turks, they furnish'd out with four Ships, who having in two years and four Moneths made little more than a saving Voyage, anchor'd in the Texel. Notwithstanding all these disasters, and small account of great endeavors, they set forth another Fleet to Trade the same way; and not onely them, but, the business working of it self, several other Merchants began to venture out Ships, freighted on their own accounts: Those and the first joyning their Stocks together, set out eight Ships under the Command of Jacob van Nek, and growing impatient, two Moneths before their return they sent out three more, under the Conduct of Stephen vander Hagen. Several Merchants in Amsterdam fit out Ships for the East-Indies, as also in Zealand and Rotterdam.In the mean time this example was every where follow'd, and this new Trade, like a new Fashion, was imitated through all the United Provinces, and none scarce look'd upon, if they were not Venturers to the East-Indies, for by this time they found great profit by it. Yet by the multiplicity of Merchants Trading there, a great inconveniency had like to have happen'd, to the ruine of the whole business; for every one employing his own Stock, and for their quicker dispatch endeavoring to out-buy one another, rais'd the Markets, and soon discover'd what value the Europeans set upon the Indian Goods: which growing mischief to avoid, the States consulted, and order'd, that all Adven∣turers
to those Parts, should be conjoyn'd and made one Society, and call'd them The East-lndia Company. The Netherland States to prevent the growing mis∣chief, make an East-India CompanyThis being publish'd, and also every one invited that could joyn their Stocks with those that had already put in, and giving great encouragements, they rais'd in short time a Bank of sixty six Tun of Gold:A Tun of Cold 1000 l. Steling and those that ventur'd 5000 l. had the honor to be call'd A Prime Partner, and so were cho∣sen in order Treasurers for the whole Company, giving annual Accounts to all the rest: which collected Treasures are kept in their respective Places, till the Fleets are ready to set Sail; but the Head of all where they are to adjust their Accounts, and pay in their gather'd Sums, were Amsterdam and Middle∣burgh, which is observ'd to this day. Increasing of the East-India Company.Since which Establishment, this Company hath not onely made prodigious improvements of their Stock, but also brought by their Conquests vast Terri∣tories under the Command of the United Provinces; for the Natives, weary of the insupportable behavior of the Spaniards and Portuguese, freely offer'd them∣selves in Leagues of Amity, to be under their Protection; and others that were more stubborn, and would persist under the Spanish Command, were sub∣du'd by force of Arms: which soon growing so considerable, it was thought fit to settle a new Government there in the most convenient Place. Staple at Batavia.Great Java, cull'd out as fittest for that purpose, they built their City in, and call'd Batavia; which they fortifi'd so well, that they baffled the Emperor of Java, lying before it with two hundred thousand Men. Here the States Governor keeps a Princely Court, and hath his Privy Coun∣cil, who by an arbitrary Power determines all business of Peace or War; and such his Limits of Dominion by their several Conquests are, that they extend from Japan to Bassora in the Red-Sea, being at least six thousand English Miles. Thus we have settled the Batavian Plantation, and given a brief account of those Voyagers which happen'd in such an Age, and one juncture of time, which laying the Ocean open, found a way for Traffick to all the Angles of the World. Embassies sent from Ba∣tavia to Japan.But before we go on farther upon our Japan Discourse, and how the Hol∣landers first settled their Staple in that Countrey, sending triennial Embassies from Batavia their chief Residence, with great Presents, it will not be unfit to relate one Embassy, which was the onely one that ever we heard of, addressed from thence to any Prince or Potentate whatsoever; for they taking so much State upon them, though they receive all with great Pomp and Civility, never make any return. The Jesuits did this to make themselvesd famous by Converting the Japanners. Histor. Jesuit. Hosp p. 139.Alexander Valignanus a Jesuit, a Person, besides his Theology, eminent both for Moral Vertues, Mathematical Sciences, and all other Learning, zealous to promulgate the Gospel, and the Faith of Jesus Christ, and altogether to eclipse, if possible, the high estimation the Japanners had of their blind Priests, horrid Rites, and dire Superstition; to which purpose Mencio Ito, Nephew to the King of Fiunga, and Michael Cinga, nearly related to the Kings of Orima and Omura, his Pupils in the European Learning, he not onely perswaded them, but brought in their Royal Unckles, that it would be worth their time to travel into Eu∣rope, where being eye-witnesses, and by certain experience to be able to give an account of the glory of the Church of Christ, and the magnificent splendor thereof: So it was, that as he design'd, it happen'd, and the young Princes with Julianus Nacaura,The Embassy from Japan to Spain and Rome. and Martinas Fura their Counsellors, and two Gentleman-Ushers, and their two Fathers the Jesuits, set Sail in the beginning of the year
St. HELENA. from Nangesaque, and after many dangers Landed at Miaco, and having stay'd there nine Moneths for a Ship, they a second time Embarqued for Malacca,Come to Malacca. where they lost one of their Ships, and were themselves pillag'd by the Mahu∣metans, and glad they escaped with their Lives; then reaching Manapur, from thence they travel by Land to Couchin: In this populous City they spent a year,To Couchin. and after hoisted Sail for Goa;To Goa. where they were magnificently entertain'd by the Portuguese Vice-Roy, Franciscus Mascaregnus. From thence Embarquing in a Portugal Ship, the first Place worth mentioning was St. Hellens,To St. Hellens. where they Landed. Description of the Isle.This Island, so call'd by its first Discoverers the Portuguese, from the Saint on whose Day it was found, being the 21 of May, lies in the Main Ocean, 16 Degrees and 15 Minutes Southern Latitude, about 510 Leagues from the Cape of Good Hope, 350 from Angola, and 510 from Brasile, being the nearest Con∣tinent to this Isle, is about seven Leagues in Circumference, appearing high above the Water, defended every where from the violence of the Sea, by steep Rocks like a Wall, with Bulwarks, and is naturally Hilly, but cut quite through with many Valleys; amongst which are two exceeding pleasant, as the Church Valley, so call'd from a small Chappel built there; on the North∣side of which is an easie and delightful Ascent to the High-lands: towards the South is the Vale of Orange, so call'd from the great plenty of that Fruit, which besides Lemons, Pomegranates, and the like, grow there in great abun∣dance, that they may Lade six or seven Vessels with them yearly. On the West-side of the Chappel is good Anchorage, but they must lie near the Shore to keep them from Driving; for from betwixt the declivings of that Rocky Coast, the Wind comes often down with great violence, and sudden gusts. The Air.The Air of this Island is very temperate and wholsom, insomuch that the Sick which are brought out of the Ships on Shore there, soon recover their health. The Valleys are not more than moderately hot, the Mountains tem∣perately cold, being continually fann'd with cooling Breezes, and the Air is re∣frigerated
frigerated with five or six Showres in a day, the Sun shining as oft betwixt; and though the Soil be naturally dry and barren, yet it is replenish'd with many Springs of sweet and wholsom Water, especially the Church Valley, through which, descending from the High-lands, glide several pleasant Streams down to the Sea, for the great accommodation of those that Anchor there, and put in forfresh, Water; yet besides this, they have two other, from whence they supply their wants. This Isle, destitute of Inhabitants, may ascribe its plenty of wild Gattel to a Portuguese Merchant, who in the Year 1512 coming to Anchor here, and ob∣serving the pleasant Situation, and the solitariness thereof, which then agreed well with his disposition, being something inclin'd to Melancholly, and ha∣ving been formerly much cross'd in his Fortunes, wearied with business, and the cunning practises of those he dealt withall, settled himself in this solitary Place, putting ashore those Sheep, Swine, and Poultrey he had aboard, which increased in a short time to a Miracle, insomuch that they suppli'd whomsoever touch'd there, with plenty of fresh Provision, and especially after King John of Portugal issued out strict Commands, prohibiting all his Subjects from set∣ling there. This Soil, though naturally (as we said before) very dry and thirsty, is much fertiliz'd, being moistned by many Springs and showry Weather, so that it bears variety of Fruits, especially Pease and Beans, of which great store are found growing every where, which when ripe, falling, sowe themselves, ma∣king such plenty. Here are also whole Groves of Orange, Lemon, Pomegranate, and Fig∣trees, which are always loaden with ripe, green Fruits, and Blossoms; and great Shades of Ebony and Rose-trees: the Wood is not easie to be wrought, because of its knottiness. The Valleys are like Kitchin-Gardens, full of Parsly-Beds, Porcelin, Sorrel, and several other Herbs good for the Pot, and also for many Distempers, especially the Griping of the Guts, a Disease very incident to such as frequent these Parts. The Woods and Hills abound with all manner of Beasts, as Goats, Deer, some as big as Stags, and also wild Swine of several colours, but very difficult to be taken. When the Portuguese first discover'd this Countrey, they found not any kind of Beast or Fruit-bearing Trees, all which they transported, Stocking and Planting of them there, which since have so spread themselves, that both the Hills and Dales are satiated with them, without any art of Husbandry. Here are also Partridges, Pigeons, Peacocks, and Pheasants, which cannot be taken either by Snares or Nets, but onely by Shooting. No Beasts or Birds of Prey, Serpents, Toads, or Frogs, have here their receptacle; but ugly Spiders and Flies, some green like Grashoppers. The Cliffs on the South-side of this Island entertain thousands of gray and black Sea-Pies, or Mews; also speckled and white Fowls, some with long, and some with short Necks, which lay their Eggs (being of a good relish) in the Rocks. These kind of Fowls the Netherlanders 1608 in a Voyage to the East-Indies, call'd them by Irony, Mad-Pies, being so tame and gentle, that they took them with their Hands, or knockt them down with their Sticks. Here the Sea-water which beats against the Rocks, remaining in a frothy foam upon them, whitened with the Sun, becomes pure Salt, and Salt-Petre.
Here are also Mountains which produce Bolus, and a fat gray Earth call'd Terra Lemnia, such as comes from Lemnos. In the South-east part of this Island is a Mountain, whose Earth being of a brightish brown, Dyes a good Red; and also one in the East, which yields a pure mixt colour, being brown above, and white below. The Sea near this Island abounds in Fish, but must be taken with Hooks, and not with Lines or Nets, because of the foulness of the Ground; Carps, but of another colour than those of Europe; Eels, about the thickness of a Mans Arm, and of a good taste; Crabs, Lobsters, of better rllish than those in England; and also very good Mussles, which stick so fast to the Rocks, that they must cut them off. This Isle, though thus flourishing, lies still uninhabited, for they say that the King of Portugal would permit none of his People to settle there, or appro∣priate to themselves, but to be left free and open, to relieve those that Sail that way. Here they Landed, and after they had refresh'd themselves, they shew'd the young Princes the Sport of Hunting the wild Boar, with which they were much delighted. The Japan Ambassa∣dors arrive at Lisbon.From thence at last, helpt with fair, and detarded with foul Weather, they Landed at Lisbon, where they were receiv'd magnificently by the Cardinal Albert Austria, Governor and Duke of Bragance. From thence they proceeded through Guadalupe, Talavera, and Toledo, to Madrid,They come to Madrid and Majorca. where Philip King of Spain entertain'd them with much splendor and kindness, and shew'd them his Court, the Escuerial, and also his Treasury, then full, his Plate-Fleet being newly ar∣riv'd. Three Moneths they diverted themselves in Castile, after Sailing to Ali∣cant, and visiting the Isles Majorca and Minorca: There entring the Haven of Pisa, they found Peter, sent from his Brother Francis Duke of Florence to meet,To Florence. and conduct them to his Palace, where they receiv'd no less welcom, and splendid Entertainments, than formerly at the Spanish Court. To Rome.Next they progress'd on directly towards Rome, the Pope sending Franciscus Gambara to his Confines, to attend and invite them to his Palace. In the Evening they were met first, and receiv'd with all civility by the Master of the Jesuits Colledge, who Lodg'd and Entertain'd them in a decent manner.Their Entrance into Rome very sumptuous.The next day they made their publick Entry, and were to be presented to Pope Gregory the third, which was perform'd with all the imaginary Grandeur that could be possible: First marched his Holiness's Life-Guard, Riding all alike suited in rich and costly Habits; next the Infantry, his Guard of Switzers; then the Attendants of the Cardinals all Clincant in Gold, and in Carnation Silks; then the Cavalcade, all the Princes and Nobility in or about the City, Riding in Order, with all the splendor that might be, with Trumpets and Kettle-Drums beating and sounding before them; then the Japan Princes well Mount∣ed, and richly Clothed after their Countrey manner, being an under Gar∣ment, Vest and Tunick, curiously embroider'd with Birds and Flowers, wide and short Sleeves, about their Necks a Scarf, two Scymiters hanging on one side, the Hilts and Scabberds Studded and Imbossed with Pearls and Dia∣monds; at last the Magistrates and Gentry of the City made up the Rear; thus attended they marched to the Palace, and entring the Presence where his Ho∣liness sat, surrounded with Cardinals and Bishops, all in Pontificalibus, accord∣ing to their Degree, with their Myters on, Crosiers in their Hands, Copes and Surplices, which exceeded, as Jacobus Augustus Thuanus affirms,Thuanus Hist. Lib 81. all the pompous
Shows that ever were seen there before. Thus attended, they addressed them∣selves, and according to the manner, though Princes, in an humble posture kiss'd with joyfulness his Holiness's Feet; then the Royal Letters of the three Kings, which were Translated into Latine, were open'd and publickly Read, the first Indorsement thus: Remarkable Superscripti∣ons of the Japan Kings Let∣ters Written to the Pope.To the most zealous Order, and chief Vicar, supplying Christs Place on Earth, the prime and holy Father, prostrated at his Feet, humbly presents These, subscribing thus: Trimus King of Bungo throws himself with all humility under the most blessed Feet of your Holiness. After the same manner were the other two directed. An Application made by Father Jaspe Gonsalvus to the Pope in behalf of the Japan mbassadors.After the Letters were Read, Jasper Gonsalvus, a Portuguese Jesuit, in the be∣half of the young Japan Princes, explain'd in ample manner the meaning of the Address, or Embassy, and at large Commentated upon the Epistles, then made a large Elogium upon the Kings, setting forth their Piety and Zeal to Re∣ligion: This done he turn'd towards the Pope, speaking also in his high commendation and praise, whatever in such an Audience was fit to be said. The Popes Answer by Anthony Buradapulius.After this was done, Anthony Burapadulius made in the Pope's behalf this Answer, which in brief was thus: That the Kings had done exceeding prudently and religiously, and were highly to be commended for thus sending their nearest Relations in an Embassy so expensive, long, and dangerous, to visit his Holiness at Rome, Gods Vicegerent, and true Successor of Peter the Apostle, the Head of the Catholick Church, and Keeper of the Keys of Heaven, by which means he hopes the whole Nation may be absolutely reduced to the Christian Faith, without which none can be saved; and happy would it be for them, changing for Salvation their abominable and heathenish Superstition, to offer in the Temple of Christ, rather than in their Dayro, or Pantheon, not of Gods, but Devils; and that they ought to give the Almighty thanks for the holy Xaverius, who by his Doctrine and pious Perswasions, brought them first to hearken to everlasting bliss and happiness, and true welfare of their Souls; which saving Faith hath already of late powerfully operated on many Nations, both in the West and East-Indies, who had time out of mind been led in Ignorance, and blinded with the abomination of Idolatry, now following Christs Banner, are profess'd Enemies to the Doctrine of Devils. Much to this purpose he spake, intimating also, That his Holiness gave them thanks, and took it as a great kindness, that they had made to him thus their Address by such a magnificent Embassy; and so all rising they were dis∣missed.The Japanners are no∣bly entertain'd in Rome. And some few days after the Pope admitted them to his own Privacy and Apartments, where they were some hours in familiar Communication with his Holiness, enquiring of them concerning the Greatness, Wealth, Man∣ners, and Customs of their Countrey, and the like. But whilst they stay'd some Moneths in Rome, and were frequently and magnificently entertain'd by the Cardinals, Officers, and Persons of Quality in the City, and were visited by the Spanish and French Ambassadors,Thuanus. spending their time in daily Caresses, and variety of noble Entertainments, Pope Gregory the thirteenth, being taken after Dinner with an Appoplectick Distemper, departed so suddenly, that they could not administer the Sacrament to him, in the 83 year of his Age; on whose Monument this Inscription is now to be seen. Inscriptions on the Tomb of Pope Gregory the thir∣teenth.Gregory the thirteenth, deserving all love and honour from his Successors, and all Persons of what degree soever, first for his adorning the City of Rome with Churches, and other publick Edifices, for his great Charity to the Poor, for many publick Schools through the Universe, for the promulgation of the Faith of Jesus, his Fatherly love to all Nations, especially for the kind Reception of the Japan Ambassadors, sent from the remotest
part of the World; and last of all, for his exact Correction of the Kalendar, or Annual Accounts. Pope Sextus the fifth gives them many rich Pre∣sents.Sextus the sixth succeeding him, shew'd also great kindness and bounty to those Royal Japanners, settling a yearly Revenue of four thousand Crowns, to∣wards the Christian Churches in Japan; two thousand for the building of publick Schools for the breeding up of their Youth in the true Belief; and also made a rich Present to the Kings their Unckles, of Swords and Crucifixes, emboss'd with Silver, Gold, Precious Stones, and other costly Curiosities. They depart from Rome, and return to Japan,So on the thirteenth of June in the Year 1585, having receiv'd these several Bounties, and Benedictions from his Holiness, they departed; and travelling through Italy and other Lands, much toss'd and turmoil'd by Sea, spending five years abroad, they Landed at Nangesaque in Japan, and from thence went directly to the Emperors Court at Meaco. These, as we said before, were the onely Addressers employ'd in an Em∣bassy from thence into Europe, or any other part of the World. Since which time the Hollanders have Traded to Japan to their great benefit, especially since the Portuguese, upon the account of the Jesuits Conspiracy, were prohibited to Traffick any longer in that Countrey, which in brief was thus: The Jesuits are banish'd from Japan because of a Plot.¶THe Jesuits having laid a Plot to deliver up the whole Empire of Japan to the King of Portugal, and having well digested the same, sent him in∣viting Letters, promising, that if he would send them eight stout Vessels well Mann'd, they no sooner mould be arriv'd, but that several Kings, and many thousands of the People their Converts, should be all at once ready to Declare for him, which would so much overpower the Emperors remaining Party, that if he then prov'd stubborn, and would not yield, they should be able to force him to his subjection: But this being discover'd,The Portuguese age ba∣nish'd from Japan. the Portuguese were presently banish'd and excluded for ever from Japan in the Year 1641, the Jesuits and principal Confederates being all put to death, suffering condign punishment. So the Trade lay in a manner open to the Hollanders, which they being al∣most solely employ'd in, made so great an advantage thereof, that they were able every three years to send Gratulatory Embassies, with several rich Pre∣sents to the Emperor. The Hollanders Staple at Firando.The first Staple they settled in that Countrey, was upon Firando, a small Isle, which on the East-side Coasts with Bongo, by some call'd Cikoko; on the North, with Taquixima; on the South faceth Goto, both also wash'd by the Sea; the West respecting the Main Ocean. The Haven of Firando, better accommodateth Japan Vessels than the Hol∣landers, which being of greater Burthen, draw more Water, especially the Mouth of the Haven being narrow, and their Ships large, is very dangerous; but within they lie safe, being Land-lock'd round about, which breaks off all force of Winds and Waves whatsoever; and though it blow to the heighth of a Heuricane, yet they Ride still in smooth Water. Description of the same.This Port they have also fortifi'd with a double Breast-work. In stead of a Palace, the Governor keeps his Residence in a mean Shed built of Planks clenched together. This Haven till of late was but little frequented; but since the Hollanders East-India Company settled their Staple here, many Mer∣chants from the adjacent Isles and other Places, come thither to Traffick with the Netherlanders, which brings much Profit to the Governor yearly, and also a
De Logie op FIRANDO. great Ground-Rent from the Hollanders; themselves having built at least forty Houses. The Store-house of the East-India Company there.The Store-house which was first order'd there for the Company, consisted of four Low Rooms, and five Upper Chambers, for the Reception of their Goods; besides Kitchen, Larder, and other Offices; lying close by the Haven, with a Key, and Stairs to the Water; but being built of Wood, which in short time grew dry and rotten, it could not preserve their Merchandise either from Fire, foul Weather, or Thieves: Therefore in Anno 1641. they began to build one more large, of Stone; which the Emperor not rellishing, supposing they might convert it into a Fort of Defiance,The Netherlanders re∣move from Firando to Nangesaque. commanded them to desist, and at the same time remov'd them to Nangesaque. A strange Idol.Near Firando, at an In-let of the Sea, stands an Idol, being nothing but a Chest of Wood, about three Foot high, standing like an Altar; whether ma∣ny Women, when they suppose that they have Conceiv'd, go in Pilgrimage, and offering on their Knees Rice, and other Presents, with many Prayers im∣ploring, That what they go withal may be a Boy, saying, O give us a Boy, and we will bear him, though a big one. But before the Hollanders left Firando, they sent their Merchandise in small Vessels to Nangesaque, where they had then a Factory, and there found in the Year 1694. a Hollander call'd Melchior Sandwoord, who Sailing with the Fleet from Mabu, through the Straights of Magellan, losing his Company, had suffer'd Shipwrack on that Coast thirty Years before. Thus the Hollanders being re∣mov'd from Firando, keep their Staple ever since at Nangesaque. Netherland Ambassadors sent from Nangesaque to Jedo.THe Ambassadors that were dispatch'd from Batavia to the Emperor of Ja∣pan, June 28. Anno 1641. receiv'd peremptory Orders, to Land only at their ple Nangesaque, and to go from thence to the Imperial Court at Jedo. The Chief in Commission for this Imployment, was his Excellency the Lord Bloc∣covius, who had joyn'd to him as an Assistant Andreas Frisius a great Merchant.
All things in readiness, and rich Presents prepar'd, they put to Sea, their Fleet consisting of three Ships and one Ketch: The Governor himself, and several others, conducted them aboard, and weighing Anchor from them, falling to Leeward, lay that night before Batavia. Description of Batavia.This City of old call'd Calappa, since Jacatra, and now Batavia, hath its last Denomination from the Batavians, which were a People driven out of their own Countrey, before the Birth of our Savior, by their Neighbors the Hessens;The Batavians from whence extracted What Tract or Land they formerly inhabited. then known by the Name of Catti, settled in the Lower Countreys, as Germa∣ny between the two Hornes, or the Arms of the Rhine, which now happens to be the United Netherlands: So that in Commemoration, and to keep up the Honor and Antiquity of their ancient Name, and first Original, they call this their New City, and Head of their East-Indian Government, Batavia. Description of Jacatra.When first Cornelius Matcleif Anchor'd at this place, Anno 1607. it was call'd Jacatra, being a mean Village; the Houses being all built after the Javan man∣ner, from the Foundation, of Straw; the Town having no other Fence-work, but Ranges of Wooden Pales, like our Parks.Power of the King of Jacatra. The Royal Palace it self was a great Huddle of Deformity, consisting of many Rooms one within another; the whole Materials that built it, being nothing but complicated Reeds, Bul∣rushes, Pleated Sedges, of which Work and Contrivance they were then proud. But the King about that time had a Design to Fortifie this his pitiful Metro∣polis with a Stone-wall. His Royal Navy consisted of four Galleys, in which, beneath his single Bank of Oars, sat his Soldiers, or Life-Guard, which attended his Commands upon the Decks. This Prince, who drove there the onely Trade in Pepper, (though by his Subjects restrain'd not to dispose of more than 300 Bags Yearly) a Commodity of which the Hollanders knew very well the Advantage, struck a League of Amity with them, annexing Articles of Traffique, to which they both agreed; which the King, being of an in∣constant and covetous Nature, observ'd so little, that he rais'd both the Prizes and Customs whenever he pleas'd: So that the Hollanders conceiving them∣selves neither certain in their Trade, nor safe in their Persons, rais'd a Fort there, for their better Security of Commerce and Defence. English and Netherlanders fall at variance before Ja∣catra.HEre also at the same time the English drove an equal Trade, not inferior to the Hollanders; who clashing in their Commerce, striving to ingross the Commodities one from the other, there arose an irreconcileable Difference be∣tween them, not to be decided but by the Sword, and Force of Arms; where∣upon soon after they engag'd all their Forces that were there present, resolving to venture all their Stakes both by Sea and Land. Strength of the Nether∣landers on Java.The Hollanders had erected there two Store, or Block-houses; one whereof they call'd Nassau, Fortifying the South-side of the Harbor; and the other, be∣ing last built, was nam'd Fort Maurice. On the North-side, along the Shore, they had rais'd a Platform, with Palisadoes to plant their Cannon on; but the Breast-work not being finish'd, they lay open to the Enemy: Also ano∣ther Eastwards, near the City, on which were planted two Great Guns, and three Sakers. The Point of the River that lay North by Fort Maurice, was rais'd two Foot high, and made defensive with Trenches. On this Point also were planted two Great Guns, and five Sakers. The North-West Point to∣wards the Sea was of the same height as the Palisado'd Platform, having a Breast-work of Wood, and a Shelter against Rain, with seven Sakers planted upon it. The other side on the West had yet no Out-works, which the Gal∣lery
of Fort Nassau supply'd, from whence the Soldiers might play with their Muskets: And in these Places they dispos'd of their whole Forces at Land. Strength of the English and Javanners against the Netherlanders.On the other side, Jacatra had by this time a strong Wall, built of red Stone, and a high Tower planted with Ordnance; which declaring for the English, put it self in a Posture of Defence. The English had onely their Store-house, and a Breast-work at the Point of the Harbor, made up of coyl'd Cables, strengthned with Pyles, and Earth well ramm'd together, to stop the Nether∣landers from entring into the Mouth of the Harbor. In this Posture, and all being prepar'd,The Netherlanders fall upon the English. the English first gave Fire; which was presently answer'd by the Hollanders, and so follow'd, that suddenly they fired the English Store-house, and became Masters of the Entry, or Point of the River; the Fort from Jacatra in the mean time playing upon the Hollanders, which were (as they say) but two hundred and forty Men, whereof eighty were Blacks. English Fleet before Ja∣catra.Whilst they were thus busie on the Shore, the English Fleet, consisting of eleven Sail, came up before Jacatra; and the Governor, to perform the Admi∣rals part,Valour of Coen. went aboard; they having seven Ships lying there, which were ready Laden, and not altogether fit for such Service yet making a Vertue of Neces∣sity, they drew out; but the Wind being contrary, which kept them to the Leeward, were forc'd to ply yet more to the Windward; so making not much way. When they were within Cannon-shot, the English unfurl'd their Red Flag of Defiance, commanding them by Sound of Trumpet to Strike, or else they would force them: So on the first of February 1619. both Fleets drawing up one to another, about twelve a clock at Noon, ingag'd, and were in hot Dispute till late in the Evening, both Sides behaving themselves with great Skill, Courage, and Resolution; till being parted by the Night, they lost sight one of another; the Dutch retreating to Amboyna; and the English, triumphing with their Victory, Sail'd back to Jacatra, where they were rein∣forc'd with seven Ships more which had not Ingag'd. So the Hollanders, in a low Condition, were block'd up both by Sea and Land: And also to make their Case more desparate, the Javanners had gotten a thousand Men for their Assistance from Bantam;The Netherlanders be∣sieg'd in their Fort before Jacatra. whose Numbers being thus increas'd, they closely be∣sieg'd the Hollanders in all their four Fortifications at once. Peter Vander Brook the Governor, Coen being gone to Amboyna with their shatter'd Fleet, had the absolute Command; who set up new Flags of Defiance on each Bulwark, and ply'd the City so smartly with his Cannon, that it struck such a terror in the Inhabitants, and Wydruk Rama the King of Jacatra, that he shew'd him∣self willing to accept of Peace;A Peace with the King of Jacatra, which after a short Cessation was agreed up∣on, and the Hollanders Articled to pay him for his Losses, Eight thousand Ry∣als.But shamefully broken. The Business seeming thus to be decided, the King desired, that there might be a friendly Interview, and to see and speak with their Governor Van∣der Brook at his own Court: But the Hollanders distrusting some Plot vail'd under this his kind Proffer, were much troubled, having found him before both fickle and treacherous;The Commander Van∣denbrook found treacherous yet at last he ventur'd, and went according as was desir'd, with a slender Train, to his, Palace; where he was no sooner come, but they seiz'd upon him, and us'd him most barbarously, threatning him with the most exquisite Tortures, and Death at last, if he would not sur∣render up the Fort; to which end, they immediately haled him, with a Halter about his Neck, under his own Guns, advising him, if he would save his life, to bid them do as the King had instructed him; but he, on the contrary, com∣manded the Besieg'd to maintain their Fort by all possible means, and never to

trust to such a false and perfidious Nation-whereupon the Javanners in the same manner haled him back to the Court. The English demand the Netherlanders Fort.Captain Thomas Dale the English Admiral, shot Arrows into the Hollanders Works, with Letters, expressing, That he himself was no way accessary to the Blood which already had been spilt on both sides; and also advising them not to deliver up their Fort to the Javanners; which being of dangerous conse∣quence to either Party, they should do well to assist them with their Additio∣nal Defence, and so save both Stakes, in surrendring to them; which if they would not, he should do his best Indeavors to save their Lives and Goods from so merciless an, Enemy, by forcing them to it; to which purpose, he had already planted sixteen Pieces of Ordnance against Fort Maurice, and would suddenly fetch up more from the Fleet. The next day he sent them a second Letter, in the same manner promising them to save their Goods as well as Lives, and give them two Months time to dispose of themselves; and those that thought fit to receive Pay, he would List with his own, and use them with the like Respect and Kindness, as if they were all one Nation: Which if they refus'd, or us'd delay, he was prepar'd immediately to fire his Guns, and at once with a general Assault to Storm them on every side. Scarcity in the Fort.They had not within the Fort, Amunition sufficient for one day in hot Ser∣vice; and the English having a great help by their Auxiliaries the Javanners, and also a Victorious Fleet ready at Sea: The Dutch being continually upon Duty, were weary, weakned, and disheartned, and also a Breach being made in their Works, which could not possibly be made up ere they were Storm'd; and as he threatned, there was no hopes of Coens Return in four Months at least. Upon these Considerations, forc'd by an inevitable Necessity, they thought it best not to refuse the English Proffer:Articles on which the Fort was to be deliver'd to the English. So they agreed to deliver them the Fort, the Guns, and what more belong'd to the Defence thereof; and to the King of Jacatra, all the Merchandise, Money, and Jewels. But the English were to furnish out the Hollanders with a Vessel of two Guns, fifty Mus∣kets, one Barrel of Powder, and six Months Provision, that so they might con∣vey themselves to Cormandel. In earnest whereof, Admiral Dale receiv'd the Governor Coens Houshold-Plate; the Fort, and all things before-mention'd, were to be deliver'd up, so soon as the Ship was ready to receive them. ¶ BUt just when they were upon Surrendring up the Fort, and going from thence aboard the prepared Vessel, according to the Articles, a won∣derful Accident hapned, which gave quite another face to the whole Businefs. A Merchant, one Cornelius Houtebraken, having admittance to Vanderbrook their Prisoner, whom they had so treacherously seiz'd upon,A strange Acciden. perswaded Cornelius to go to the Panagran, or King of Bantam, to intreat him to use what means he could to get him into his Custody, and make him his Prisoner; which if he did, he would nobly requite at their Admiral Coens Return. This Account the Merchant giving him, and he considering that there might be an Advantage, in having such a Pledge as the second Man of the Hollanders in his own Hands, bethought himself of a way to put in Execution his Design, which was thus: Whilst Rama, the English, and the Hollanders were agreed, and Articles of Sur∣render ready to be perform'd, he sent Damagon, a Prime Favorite of his, with 2000-Men, to Rama's Court Jacatra; where venturing,Damagon sets upon the King of Jacatra. and securing the Pas∣sages sages with his own Soldiers, went and presented the Panagran's Letter to Rama; which whilst he was perusing, he pull'd out a Steeletto, and seizing on him, set∣ting
the Point to the Kings Breast, said, Either resign thy kingdom to my Master the King of Bantam, or die. Rama being astonish'd, and thus suddenly surpriz'd, willinger to lose his Right and Possession, than his Life, yielded; and at the same instant, having no more warning, took his Wife and eldest Son; and so leaving his Palace, and what else belong'd to him, went like a willing Exile in∣to strange Countreys, where after he was driven to that Necessity, that he turn'd Fisher-man, going in a poor Canoo to Sea, to maintain his Wife and Fa∣mily. Bantamers besiege the Netherlanders Fort.The English seeing so great and sudden an Alteration, and the Work carried on so strangely; the Bantamers to and about the Hollanders Fort, and Vander Brook rescu'd, and carried from thence to Bantam, they plainly and evidently perceiv'd, to their no great comfort, That the Hollanders would break their Faith, and Articles concluded and agreed upon, and their Golden Dream of such Acquirements, by their Agreement, would come to nothing. Nor were they deceiv'd in their Judgment; for the Hollanders in the Hurly-burly, and sudden Alteration of Government, thought they had a fit opportunity to Fish while the Waters were troubled; and so taking new Counsel and Courage, Fortified themselves afresh, and repair'd their Breaches; and withal, high in their Hopes, ostentatiously set over the Gates of the Fort in Capitals the fore∣mention'd BATAVIA,Vander Brook calls it Ba∣tavia. which Name after they gave their City. To back this their haughty Proceedings, done as if in defiance to the English, Coen al∣so, little expected, arriv'd with seventeen Sail the 25 of March, gather'd up from the Molucco Islands, and lay before their New Batavia. The next day he set some few Men ashore,Coon takes Jacatra, and ruins it. which broke into Jacatra, pulling down the Wooden Walls, and Straw Houses: Then adding fresh Supplies, they march'd from thence to Bantam, and there demanded of the Panagran, his Prisoner, the Go∣vernor Vander Brook, with seventy others taken out of the Ship the Black Lion. The Panagran,Duc Prisoners deliver∣ed from Bantum. though unwilling, yet being threatned by them, deliver'd most of the Men that Evenning, and the next Morning the rest, with their Vice-Admiral Vander Brook. But the English seeing Coen thus arriv'd with such Recruits, and all things falling out cross to their Concern; not able to strive with these unexpected Misfortunes, with all speed getting their Guns that lay on the Shore aboard, they hoysed Sail, directing their Course to the Straights of Sunda. Peace proclaim'd be∣tween the English and Ne∣therlanders.When soon after, on the ninth of June, Peace was Proclaim'd there by Or∣der from the States of the United Provinces, between the English and the Nether∣landers; in which setled Quiet, whilest they imploy'd themselves in a constant and undisturb'd Trade, they not onely improv'd their private Estates, but al∣so this their new Plantation, raising what was an inconsiderable Store-house, at first to a sleight and undefensive Platform, then to a petty Fort, and next to a Castle with Redoubts; which in few years after, they so flourishing there, became a strong and almost impregnable City, now famous through the East∣ern World, and well known every where by the Name Batavia. ¶ BUt this their growing Metropolis, the Emperor of Java look'd upon with an ill eye, and could not well digest such their Proceedings, to build such Fortifications upon his Ground, scarce asking his leave; and jea∣lous of future Events, what a Goad it might be in his Side hereafter, that had already Eclips'd his Authority in his own Ports, by losing his Custom and Traffick; which they had ingross'd, by a new and peculiar way of their Tra∣ding
with Japan, China, Samutra, Succadanen, Siammos and other Countreys; so his displeasure and jealousie breaking out at last into open Hostility, he be∣gan a War , and to vindicate his Cause against those that so had injuriously in∣truded upon him; and Anno 1629 drew up against the New City an Army, con∣sisting of 150000 Men, and vested round within Pistol Shot of the Walls, which he ply'd with such continual Stormings, that he kept the Besieg'd with fresh Alarms, in such hot service, that they had neither time to eat, drink, nor sleep, or any minute of refreshment; but they so roughly entertain'd him, what with playing their great Guns, throwing Granadoes and Fire-Balls from their Outwork and Platforms, that it cost him daily an incredible number of men, so that at last, their Souldiers filling their Trenches and Outworks with their Bodies, the Besieg'd suffer'd more under the assaulting stench , and noi∣some smells of the Dead, than by the charge of their, living Enemy; to ease them of which, they were forc'd themselves to dig Pits, and tumble them in at such times, when they had any respite, or the least breathing while granted by the Retreat of their Foes. Strange storming of a Fort near Batavia.¶ AMongst many memorable Passages that happen'd in this Siege, that of the most remark, chanc'd to be at Fort Magdalen, the utmost Redoubt of the City, being defended onely by sixteen men, who made such stout resist∣ance, placing their Guns with that dexterity, that making Lanes through the Enemy, they lay on heaps one upon another, that they almost floated in their Goar. At last, Powder and Shot failing, and having no time granted, nor any possibility to spare any one of their men to fetch more Ammunition, the Storm being so terrible; these, so great were their Resolutions, that they un∣til'd the Roofs, and digg'd up Stones, and whatever else they could find, throwing at the Enemy, and so kept them off a great while. This also at last failing, and that they must be swallow'd up by the fresh assaults of the Javan∣ners, they bethought themselves of defensive Weapons, such as never were hear'd of before, nor, as may be suppos'd, never used in the world, throwing upon them Close-stool-pans, Jakes, and what the Common-shore did afford; which Merdurinous Arms, so Painting, and perfuming their naked bodies, was more terrible to them, than Powder and Ball, flying not onely from the ene∣my, but even from themselves, such was the loathsome stench; but more espe∣cially, when fresh men sally'd out of the City, they betook themselves to their heels in a general rout, crying in their Language, Oseitang Orang Hollanda de Bakalay Sammatay, that is, You Holland Devils fight with T— The Javans break up their Siege from Batavia.The Javanners courage began to fail, almost quite despairing of ought that could be gotten by the Leager; so Firing their Camp in three places towards Evening, the first of October 1629, they marcht off, and the Hollanders fearing Treachery, kept close within their Works;Private slaughter amongst themselves. but in the morning sent forth a Par∣ty of Foot, and Horse to explore the Enemy, and bring an account where they were, and in what condition and posture. These perceiv'd at last, that the Enemy quite deserting the Siege, were dispersed, and fled, leaving eight hundred slaughter'd bodies, many of them desolated, the rest run through; which wondrous news bringing back, every one decsanted upon; but in a few days after, they were inform'd of the cause, which was thus;
PULO TYMON The Reasons.THe Emperor in the former Siege, which was the year before, had Invested Batavia with, as he suppos'd, an innumerable Army, which having ill success, thousands of his Men were kill'd, baffled, and beaten off by a few sturdy Hollanders, return'd with a great loss, and disparagement. The Prince of Mandura, an Isle in an Inlet of the Sea, two Miles North∣ward from Java, having a Quarrel against the Emperors General, who had the sole Conduct of the former War; and being now return'd with shame and disgrace, cast out words against him to this purpose: That he had behaved him∣self indeed well, and Very handsomely, having such a numerous Army to come off so basely, with so much loss and dishonor, which had he the like, he would give the Emperor another manner of account, or never return alive. This the Emperor taking notice of, thought fit to employ such a brisk Undertaker; and raising a second Ar∣my, joyn'd him in Commission with his first General, who was a soft man, yet well belov'd of the Souldiers, who when they were thus forc'd to Retreat, as they had been before, and leave their Siege, Rallying up their scatter'd For∣ces in the foremention'd Plain, some distance from the City: This Prince coming near the former General, as he and the rest of the Captains were con∣sulting how to dispose of their shatter'd Forces, the old General said thus boldly to him; But whatsoever becomes of us, thou shalt be sure to keep the promise which thou madest so bravely to the Emperor, never to return alive from Batavia; and as he spake, ran him through the body; and the rest of the Captains and Officers about him, fell upon his Lifeguard and Followers , leaving eight hundred massacred upon the Spot. Since this beating of so powerful an Enemy, and such a numerous Ar∣my, that in probability the Hollanders would scarce have been a Breakfast for, being by Divine Providence thus totally dispatch'd , they have since enjoy'd such a serene Tranquility, that now Batavia is become the greatest and flou∣rishing City of all the European Plantations in the East: From hence, his Ex∣cellency
Lord Blockhoff, Anno 1649, on the 28 of June, as we said before, began his Voyage, being employ'd Ambassador to the Emperor of Japan; Steering first through the Straights, which washes the Head-Land of Samutra, call'd Suna∣para, and the Isle of Banca; and in eight days ran the length of Paulo Tymon, ha∣ving that Coast on his Starboard. Description of Pubo Timon.¶ THe Isle makes out a most delightful Prospect, rising from the Shore like a copped Hill, the ascent interwove with winding Valleys, full of fresh Fountains, vested with several sorts of shady and Fruit-bearing Trees: The North-East Point of this, hath a small adjacent Isle; the Straits betwixt which makes a pleasant Passage, and a safe and convenient Landing-place on Tymon. Description of the Heth Betel.Here grows wild, and to be gather'd every where, the so much esteem'd Herb Betell, on the vertue of which, the Indians believe their whole Regi∣ment of Health depends, so that scarce one is to be found that hath it not in his mouth chawing night and day; which to take off the bitterness, they com∣monly commix with Arera and Chalk; the better sort compounded with Cal∣phur de Buaneo, Aloes, and Musk, Which they say hath these Operations; first, That it makes the Breath Sweet, keeps White, Fastens, and Consolidates the Teeth; it Corroborates the Stomach, making good Digestion, and chearing the Spirits, adding Strength and Vivacity to the whole Body. They take him to be a very ill-bred and uncivil fellow, that offers to presume, come before, and speak with the Governor, e're he hath perfum'd his Breath with it. This Plant hath most Efficacy, and grows best under a temperate Climate. The Leaves are not unlike that of an Orange, but sharper, runs up, imbracing Poles, like our Hops: Some choose the ripe and golden colour'd Leaves as the best; others, those that are quite wither'd: In the first chawing it renders a reddish Juyce like blood, which they spit out, but what comes af∣ter they swallow. If the Leaves be kept close, and not much handled, they will keep their vertue a great while; with which the Javanners load whole Fleets of their small Vessels, transporting it from thence home, to their no lit∣tle profit; near the Shore it is cheap, but up in the Countrey being scarcer, is much dearer. Description of Polu Cecir de Terr.¶ FRom hence they went on in their intended Voyage, and on the twelfth day rais'd Pulo Candor, a small Isle; next Pulo Cecir de Terr, so distinguish'd from Pulo Cecir de Mere, lying Easterly to the Offin; but Cecir de Terr verg'd with a white Sand, lies before the main Continent of Cambodia,The power of the Cambo∣dian King. and is much frequen∣ted by the Japanners, Portuguese, and Couchicinessers, and Malayers. The King of this Countrey Cambodia, hath his Residence in a Palace, Fenc'd in stead of Stone, with Woodden Pales, Guarded with sixteen Elephants, who faithfully make good their appointed Stations, all Fortifi'd with twenty four Guns, made prize from several Villages belonging to Goa, and many other pla∣ces, that formerly suffer'd Shipwrack on his Coast. They are Painted blue, and stand Mounted on black Carriages. His Councellors.His Councellors, when ever they meet upon serious Affairs of State, or to decide private Controversies, repair to the Council-Table, each of them with Golden Bags, in which are three Gold Boxes esteem'd pretious, being full of Cardimum, and other rich Essences, and a pair of Siezors to make ready Pynang. They sit before the King, making a Semi-Circle; behind them are plac'd the
Tonimmes, or Common-Council, with the like Silver Bags; their Priests shaven like our Friers, sit foremost, facing the King. How the Embassadors are receiv'd.The publick place of meeting, where the King sits Inthron'd in full State and Glory, is built like an Arch, but signifies his Court and Temple, cover'd and adorn'd with Gilt and Carv'd Work; their Floors all Matted, where stand three great Idols, and three little ones. The Embassadors that make their Addres∣ses, coming for Audience, are plac'd amongst the Okina's; five and twenty be∣ing sent from the King to receive their Embassy, and make Report to his Ma∣jesty; the Embassadors, by an Interpreter, deliver their Message to the Cha∣bander, he to one of the Okinars; the Okina with his hands lifted above his head, to the King. Japanners in Camodia. The Japanners which were eight Families, driven from their Abode (for what reason we know not) setled in this Countrey, and held in much esteem by the King , because they assisted him in a Grand Rebellion against his Son, who Conspired to depose and destroy his Father, and settle himself in his Throne. Strange Rock. Leaving Cambodia, they crost over to Chiampa, and four days after they pass'd by St. John de Fix, being a steep Mountain, whose Spiry top resembles a man, large as the Colossus. Hereon, the night following, being the 15 of August, the Embassador himself, Lord Blockhoff, departed this Life, being Inbalm'd, his Bowels inclos'd in an Urn or small Chest, was with all Solemnity and Honor, as if a Funeral, discharging their Guns, and the like, thrown over-board. From thence, with their single Embassador, Andreas Frisius, though sad, they went on; and passing by Pulo Cambier, and Catao, they rais'd in view the Island Aynam, and soon after Macao, where they were cumber'd with abundance of Fishermen, which seem'd to cover the whole Sea. Description of Macao. The City Macao, or Mavaw, stands scituated on a small Isle, or Isthmus, be∣ing joyn'd with a neck of Land to the main Continent of China, lying in twen∣ty degrees North-Latitude. The middle of this narrow piece of Land, a great
Arch seems to bestride, stopping all passage with shut-up Gates, to go thorow which all Portugueses are prohibited; and whatever Merchandize and other Commodities, carry'd in and out pay Toll and Customs to the Emperor of China; but the Mandariens granted the Portuguese to Plant Henpeoao, and suffer'd them in Myacaco to Erect their City, which they built with strong Walls, and Fortifi'd with three Forts, rais'd on three Hills, being the outmost Angles of the Town. The first and chiefest St. Paulo, stands fortifi'd with thirty Brass Guns, each carrying Balls of 36 pounds weight, and is the Court and Residence of the Governor. The second call'd Nostra Signiora Del∣lapenna de Francia; And the third, Nostra Signiora de Guyle, are the Priory of the Cleusenars: These, so soon as they descry any Ships in the Offin, Steering thi∣ther from Japan, Manillas, or any other Coast, they give notice by Ringing their Bells. This City hath also four Redoubts, or strong Bulwarks on the Land side, and three Fronting the Sea: The first of these call'd St. Jago de la Barra, is so great, that it seems a City it self; where two Platforms, with well Mounted Guns make the place impregnable; under whose command the Channel lying, all Vessels must pass, entring the Harbor; Over whose Captain or Commander, being Commission'd by the King himself, the Governor hath no Authority. The second Bulwark, Nostra Signiora del bon Pelta Guardes, the South-West side of the Town, close without the Gates, stands a Powder-Mill, from whence a Wall running in manner of a Cressant, Invirons a Bay or standing Pool, re∣plenish'd with a Water to the Bulwark Francisco: Between the two Bulwarks, or Redoubts are many stately Edifices, near which stand their Land-Marks. The third Bulwark, Francisco, hath at its Foot a Platform, on which is always rea∣dy Mounted a Culvering that carries a Bullet of 48 pound weight, which when Discharg'd at random height, reaches to the Point of the Island Cavean. From this runs a Wall towards the Land to St. Johns Bulwark, near the Gate Lazaro; and from thence up Hill, to the Jesuites Colledge, adorn'd with large and handsome Buildings. Within the City, the Jesuites, Dominicans, Fran∣ciscans, Augustines, and Cleusenars have their several Cloysters; to which the three first add no small Splendor. The Bishop of this place, is under Diocess and Jurisdiction of the Arch-bishop of Goa. The Trade of Macaw.This City Macaw drives a great Trade with Tonkyn, Quinam, Champa, Cambodia, Macasser, Solos, Timos, Marillas, and formerly also Japan; to which place none dare set Sail without Commission from their Council: Their Traffick none of the meanest, being Gold, Silver, White Silks, Cloth of Tishew, Rubies, Pearls, Musk, Quick-Silver, Spiljauter, Porcelin, China-Roots, and Rubarb; the City within also abounding with all manner of Artificers. A great Storm, which drove the Fleet from Japan.After the Fleet lost sight of Macaw, on the fourth of September there hap∣pen'd a terrible Storm, and violent Rain, mix'd with dreadful Thunder and Lightning: which foul Weather was sadly guess'd at by a strange Sight, Sirius, or the Dog-Star, the greatest and brightest of all the fixed Stars, whose Body ap∣peard darting out fiery Beams, resembling Claws like a Scorpion. Three days they suffer'd under this vehement Tempest, and driving still more to the Lee∣ward, they were forc'd to drop Anchor; which coming home, and the Storm rather increasing, they were not able to weigh again, but for present safety cut their Cables, and carrying onely a fore Course they lost nine Leagues more of what they had formerly gain'd; then attempting to put out their main Course, that they might not lose any longer so much of their Way, Peter Davenson, a
stout Sea-man, and good Commander, handling the Tackle, was carried over∣board, Sail and all: Upon this a Council being presently call'd, to consult of what was best to be done in this exigency, all their Lives lying at stake, they resolv'd to lie upon a close Hale, and bear what Sail they could, if possible so to double the Point of Piscadores, from thence to bring her to their intended Course, if Wind and Weather permitted, which by that time might prove more favorable; but that Night it blew so hard, that they could scarce carry their Sprit-Sail; yet in the Morning growing calmer, they put out their Mizne to keep them from Driving to the Southwards, finding themselves in 22 De∣grees Northern-Latitude: but when they hop'd the violence of the Tempest had been spent, at Noon it began afresh, blowing from the East with greater violence than ever, in which they lost their Sprit-Sail, when despairing, and quite out of hope of any possibility of preservation, the Wind all the fore-part of the Night continuing the same fury, then believing themselves at Deaths∣door, and ready to be swallow'd up, it pleas'd Divine Providence in mercy to asswage the great violence of the Tempest, and the Wind changing, they lay more Eastward, haling close aboard their main Tackle, so got within a League of the Coast of China; under which being high Land, and shelter'd by the Spoon-Mountain, which broke off the fury of the Weather, they had smoother Water, and at last, being deliver'd from so great a danger, came safe to An∣chor at Formosa. Description of the Island Formosa.¶ THe Formosan Isle, formerly call'd by the China's, Paccande, extends it self in length from the South to the North, and in breadth East and West, being an hundred and thirty Leagues in Circuit: the Prospect shews you much rising Ground, and a Hilly Countrey, which abounds with Deer, great store of wild Goats, Hairs, Coneys, Swine, Tygers, and the Luvasey, whose Flesh hath a delightful and excellent rellish. The Woods also have no want of Phea∣sants and Pigeons. The Ground being fruitful, produceth store of Sugar, Gin∣ger, Cinamon, Coco-Nuts, and several other Necessaries fit for humane suste∣nance; besides, full of populous Villages. They are Govern'd by several Lords, not depending nor acknowledging any Superior, so that each Town being a Republick, they still have Wars and are at difference one with another, Town against Town, Village against Village, insomuch that Peace never set foot in that Isle. Of their many Villages, the prime and of chiefest note, are Sinkan, Mandauw, Soulang, Backeloang, Taffacan, Tifulucan, Teopan, and Tefurang; the last in a Val∣ley near the High-lands, where Fort Selandia stands, formerly call'd Tyovan. The Inhabitants of Te∣furang are very salvage.The Inhabitants of this Village are rude and salvage, robust, and almost of a Gigantick size,Their Customs. not black like the Caffers, and count it no immodesty to go stark naked. Their Women, well built for stowage, short, and inclining to grossness, wearing Apparel; yet twice a day they strip themselves, and are not asham'd to bathe and wash in publick. These, though a barbarous People, are kind to the Netherlanders, heartily en∣tertaining them with their own, though mean, yet wholsome Fare. Inhabitants of Soulang.Soulang breeds a needy, spiteful, inhospitable, and a bloody People. Not∣withstanding the fruitfulness of the Soil they commonly live in want, being extreme lazy, tilling no more than they suppose will supply their necessity; which often falling short, they are so hardly put to it, that when they per∣ceive Provision growing scant, they live sparingly many days, or else they
might be utterly famish'd; for in such exigencies they never help one ano∣ther: nay, they are so supinely slothful, that the Women do all the business of the Field, Plough, Sowe, and Reap, having neither Horses, nor any other Cat∣tel to help them; the Drudgery being the more, because they make it Gard∣ners work, for onely with Shoes they dig and turn the Glebe; and where their Corn grows thickest, especially Rice, they pluck it out with their Hands, and set it where they find the Blades come up thinner; and in Harvest know∣ing neither Scythe nor Sickle, which tries their patience, cropping it with a Tool like a Pruning-Knife Stalk by Stalk, a Span below the Ear; which with∣out Threshing they store up in their Houses,How they order their Rice. hanging it in the Evening in small Bundles over the Fire; and early in the Morning the Women rise and Pound so much as will serve them that day for their lazy Lord and Family. Besides Rice and other Grain, they sowe Carrots, Set Water-Melons, Pinang, Quach, Taraum, and Pting. This Isle is not stor'd with such Wines as other Places in India have, which their Trees produce; but they have another sort of Liquor, that inebriates no less than the Indian, or Juice of the Spanish Grape; which they prepare in this manner: They take a quantity of Rice, which they put in a Vessel made for that purpose, and boyl it; then turning it out, they knead it into little Balls, or Pellets; when they are well chew'd they put it into another Pot, there let∣ting it stand till grown sowre; to this they pour a good quantity of Spring-water, which being so put together, works a Moneth or two, for so long it will ferment; which done, it becomes a clear, pleasant, wholsom, and strong Liquor: the longer they keep it, the better it grows,Strange Liquor in For∣mosa. for it will hold good thirty years. The top of this Liquor is thin and clear, the bottom, or sede∣ment thick like our Pap: the thin makes their Drink with which they often Fuddle; the thick makes their Cawdle to recover, which they eat with Spoons after their Recovery. This they carry with them to the Field, and take a Dose thereof when they think fit: and thus yearly they spend most part of their Rice. The Women Fish and Till.The Women when their Cultivation, or Land-work is done, then they be∣take themselves to the Sea, and Launch out their Boats, which they call Cham∣pans, and fall to Fishing, where they catch great store of Crabs, Oysters, and Gurnets, which they Salt without Gutting, and therefore, though Pickled, keep not long, but are apt to putrifie and breed Worms; yet they like it never the worse, but look upon their Dish as the greater Dainty, the rancker the Hogoe. Their Youths, though strong and of able Bodies, spend their time in idle∣ness and sloth; and when forty years old, then they settle themselves to Lazi∣ness, as if it were a Trade or Handicraft, spending twenty years in a metho∣dical doing of nothing, in a small Hut or Hovel, dandling their Children, or Dalliance with their Wives, seldom or never stirring out of their own Limits, or Patch of Ground, unless invited either to a private or publick Feast, or Hunting-Matches, in which Pleasure they take some pains, using several,Several woys of Hunt∣ing. and indeed ingenious ways to catch the Game, sometimes practising deceit, laying Snares and Traps of complicated Rushes and Reeds so artificially, that they look fresh, as if growing and ungather'd, setting them in the Haunts of wild Boars, Lays of Deers, and the like, and so catch them, wondering who made their new Lodges and Beds so soft, and lay Meshes in other inviting places, which if they take not willingly, nor observe such allurements, they drive
them in, Where they also make them their Prey; and they trepan them into Pits, digg'd and spread over with a light Swarth, or Turf of Grass, supported with brittle Twigs laid athwart the Holes: here to make them sure from get∣ting out, they place a Snare, which suddenly arrests them, taking them Priso∣ners by the Neck or Legs, and then they with a shout fall upon the so taken Quarry. Strange manner of Hunt∣ing in Firad.Besides this, they use Hostility and open Arms, whole Villages march out together, nay, two or three Townships, joyning their Forces, taking the Field; where drawn out in a single File, they stretch a Ring, which extends four or five English Miles in compass, every one brandishing in each Hand a Javelin, some carrying three or four: thus all prepar'd, with a rally of Hounds they rouse the Prey, then contracting their wide Circumference by degrees into a narrower and narrower Circuit, closing up at last Man to Man, Shoulder; this done, if any one of their thrown Spears hit and fallen in the Body of the Game, they never lose him, for their Launces being short, not above six Foot long, and Pointed with Iron, having three retorted Hooks, stick so fast, that though flying to shelter amongst the Bushes and Shrubs, will not, when im∣peded by intangling Branches, drop out, and also having ty'd at the But-end of the Staff a long String with a Bell, so that if by chance the Beast thus im∣parked break the Pail, yet they never lose him, for they follow not onely by the scent, but by the sound, both which seldom fail. They use also Arrows, especially when they Hunt wild Deer. The remain∣der of the slain Venison,Venison how eaten. when they have Feasted themselves, they barter for Clothing and Raiment with the China's, seasoning with Salt the Humbles, to keep for their own private Store; but if by chance they kill a pregnant Doe, they unlace her, and Feasting upon the Slinck, eat up Skin and all. The Formosan Mens Ex∣ercises, and their manner of Fighting.To this their Manly Divertisements, and Exercises of Saiha, pleasing Labor, as pursuing their Game, they have also rougher work, and serious engage∣ments, which, when successful, brings no less delight to such a barbarous People, that is, a Civil War, antient Feuds, or fresh Animosities, still upon new occasions fermenting, so that Town against Town, and Village against Village all the Countrey over, are in open Hostility, either publick Slaughter, or private Murder being their Sports, which thus they carry on: First one Town begins, sending the other a bold Defiance; this is follow'd by twenty or thirty in a Party, which Row in their Boats, or Champans, to their Enemies Village, near which they lie as if in Ambuscade till Night, then growing dark, they Landing, march up and down and explore the Fields, culling out private Huts, and such like Houses, where the Graver sort, the Married People, as we said before, at their ease and pleasure dwell: Those that be thus supinely careless they suddenly surprise, and off goes their Heads, Hands, and Feet; some∣times more cruelly they slice out their whole Bodies, each one carrying a Col∣lup in triumph home, as an evidence that he had no small share in that bloody Slaughter, but, as they suppose, honorable Action: But finding no small Game, or such single Adventures, then they attempt secretly the next Village, where silently breaking into a House or two, they spare none, but salvagely kill Men, Women, and Children, carrying their Heads, Hands, and Feet home, as Trophies of their Victory: But sometimes falling short of their Design, and glad to escape to save themselves; and often, the whole Town so suddenly taking the alarm, they with as little mercy are all cut off: at other times in their flight so few appearing, that the Enemies in hopes of revenge,
are trepann'd to their Boats, where in greater and unexpected numbers they Fight so valiantly, that they put them to the Rout; yet these, though seeming Furioso's, receiving the least Wound, basely retreat and quit the Battel. Their Defensive Arms are Shields, so large,Their Arm: that they cover their whole Bodies; their Offensive, Darts and Faulchions. It often happens, that two or three Villages joyn against one or more asso∣ciated Towns: these have no Commission-Officer, or Commander, but who∣soever shews most Men, they make their General, and hath the prime Autho∣rity to Rule over the others according to their numbers. Neither are their Warlike Stratagems common, for when they intend to Attaque some Village by a sudden surprisal, for they have no Works to storm, opposite to the way that they appear upon, and ready to enter the Village; on the other side they lie in ambush, which when they charge in, giving a smart alarm, the People struck with a sudden fear, in a confused manner betake themselves to their Heels, and flying from, fall just into the Mouth of the same Enemy, who suddenly starting up, are not sparing, but oftentimes make a general slaughter, whilst the others ransack and pillage the Houses. Sometimes in the Night they break into a House or two, which leaving, their business being done, two of the Party stick fast in their likeliest way to return, so to stop the Pursuer, sharp-pointed Reeds, about half a Yard long, they making their Retreat by another im∣probable way. Each Conqueror that shares for his own part a Head; car∣ries it through his Village upon a Spear, insulting and singing in praise and glory of his god, to whom he solely ascribes his Victory; thus proudly vapor∣ing, they are joyfully receiv'd every where, and entertain'd with the best Li∣quor the Town affords. Formosans have great Churches.Every sixteen Houses have their own Chappel, to which they carry this their bloody Spoil, which afterwards he boyls till the Flesh comes from the Bone, then drying it in the Sun, they pour strong Liquor (a Custom which they never omit) upon the bare Scalp: fourteen days they keep Holy, Feast∣ing and Sacrificing to their gods,Keep great Feasts when they are Conquerors. who gave them so great and glorious a Victory. Of these Heads, who e're enjoys one, looks upon it as his greatest Treasure, prizing them beyond Gold or Silver, or the most precious Jewel, and when any sudden accident of Fire, or the like happen, this they take most care of, how to carry it with them, or leave in safety. Have no supreme Go∣vernor.¶THis Isle, as we said before, hath no King, nor supreme Governor, but every petty Village is a small Republick, Ruling it self under twelve Magistrates, chosen every second year;Strange Counsellors. whose chief Qualification is to be fifty years old: these when going out, in honor and commemoration that they were once prime Rulers, have all their Hair pick'd off from their Temples, and each side of their Heads with Tweasers; which baldness is the well known Badge of their former Authority.Their Authoity. But these Governors Power hath but small Limits, for in every Exigence all the Villages meet in the Temple there, having no Representatives, every Man speaks to the purpose according to his abili∣ties, or as he is biassed; which done, the Twelve take into their consideration, and from the general result of their various opinions, give their special Ver∣dicts, which the People as they like or dislike, ratifie or refuse. But they have absolute Power to seize the Clothes of whomsoever wears Apparel in that three Moneths, when by their Laws they are commanded to go naked, and
Pray to their Idols for Rain, being about that time always a dry Season. This also in part they inflict upon the Women that go too gorgeously in that Quar∣ter. This their Court of twelve Aldermen suffer great hardship or Penance, not being allow'd by their Laws to taste any strong Drink, as Pietang, use Sugar, or eat any Fat of their Meat, till such time as their Rice is half ripe, believing that onely preserves the sprouting Blade from the harrase of wild Beasts, as Deers, Swine, and such like. The Punishment of Cri∣minals.Their chief Practise, and special Vertues, are Theft, Murder, and Adultery, at which they are very dextrous, either by Stratagems, or down-right vio∣lence, and he that reckons up the most of such dire Actions, appears amongst them the bravest Fellow. Shw great respect one to another, and chiefly the Youth to the antient Peo∣pleThese People, though they have no superiority amongst them, neither by the honor of Birth, nor their own acquired Riches: yet the Seniors keep the Ju∣niors at a greater distance than we in Europe; the old Men exacting a greater Respect from the younger by far, over whom they exercise absolute Authority, and Arbitrary Power, without any limitation, Youth being no better than a Slave to Age; for wheresoever a young Man sees one more aged than himself (though at a great distance) starts suddenly out of the way, as if a Prince were coming with all his Train; and if he chance to call and beckon to him, then sending him of an Errand, he dare not refuse, though to the farthest part of the Isle; neither dare they once offer to come near, or intrude into any Room where Parents are together; so that to be young, is to be a Slave, and when old, a Prince, having no honor of superiority but by their years. Strange Marriage.¶ THe Males must not Marry before their one and twentieth Year, nor wear long Hair till the seventeenth. Their ceremonious Rites of Matri∣mony are onely consummated thus: The Suiter, who by the advice of his Pa∣rents or his own Affection, hath cast his Eye upon a Mistress, begins his Court∣ship or Gallanting with a Present, which his Mother, or a near Relation, car∣ries to her House, there presenting in her Servants Name, with all Complements, and manifestations of his Affection. These Gifts are commonly eight Skirts or Petticoats, as many Wastcoats, or Upper-Bodice, four hundred Armlets of pleited Rush, a dozen Rings for their Fingers, either Copper, or white polish'd Harts-horn, and so many Laces of red Dogs Hair, five Linnen Girdles, twelve Dogs hair Coverlets, thirty Chinesie Pieces of Cloth, a great Box full of Dogs-hair, with which they make a Border, or Love-shade, to beautifie their Fore∣head and Temples, which they call Ayam Maniang, and five pair of Hart-skin Stockings. These Presents are sent onely by the Wealthiest; and those that are less able according to their abilities. If what they thus present is receiv'd, the business is concluded, and Marriage presently confirm'd by the Nuptial Bed. The Formosan Men live  with their Women.Notwithstanding the concluding Ceremony, the Husband and Wife dwell not together, but live apart by themselves; but in the Night he is allow'd in a clandestine way to steal to his Enjoyments; whether making his approaches, he is neither allow'd Fire nor Candle, but with all silence and secrecy steals in∣to the Bed; neither there must he speak to his Bride, but if he want any thing, that he signifies by Coughing; upon which, guessing what it may be, his Wife administers, and her Houshold-business being done, she comes to Bed; a hard Lodging, where indeed they have no Bed, neither Pillow nor Bolster, but a Buck-skin spread upon the Floor; yet others have a Bedstead spread with Rushes. These hardships, as they suppose, makes them fitter for the encoun∣ters
of Venus, and more stirs up Loves fervor than warm dalliance in softer ac∣commodations: Neither may he linger there, but ere the Dawn visibly ap∣pear, thence he must, that so his departing with an appetite, he may be the more earnest for a second fruition: But all this while neither of them are a burthen to one another, but each provide themselves, and follow their own affairs; and if they meet by chance in the Day, they pass by like Strangers, the Husband not daring to speak to his Wife without her License.May not speak to them in the day-ime. The Charge of bringing up of the Children is left to her Care, till they are above one and twenty years of age, then their Father receives and keeps, or disposes of them as he thinks fitting. ¶ BUt the Formosan Women have a barbarous Custom (void of all Motherly affection, and humane reason,) for whoever proves with Child before 37 years of age, when the Fruit of her Womb waxeth ripe and fit for Delivery, they cruelly and in unspeakable manner destroy: for in stead of a Midwife that should assist them in their Labor, or Childbed-throws, they employ a cruel Dame, who laying them in a fit posture on their best and softest Bed,Horrible Murder of their Infants. crushes and kneads the tender Infant in the Womb, till it become like a lump of Dough, which departs from them with more extreme torture, than if they were natu∣rally deliver'd. Georgius Canidius, a Minister of the Gospel, residing in Formosa Anno 1627 re∣lates, that he knew a Formosan Woman, who was deliver'd of 16 Children in that horrible manner, her first abortion being in her seventeenth Year; and he being inquisitive to know why she thus made away what would have been her own dear Issue, and to be esteem'd most of all worldly joys by her, recei∣ved this answer from her, That her shamefac'dness and modesty forbad her to be a Mother before she was of age of discretion, being accounted amongst them 37 Year. In what Year the Formo∣san Men begin to keep House with their Wives.The Husband (as we said before) in the 40 Year of his age, forsakes his so∣litary abode, and lives with his Wife, spending the remainder of their days to∣gether in small Huts or Hovels in the Field: but upon the least jangling or fall∣ing out, they part; so that sometime they change their old for new Wives once a Moneth. If he can clearly convict her, shewing just reason for this se∣paration, he recovers her Dowery, seizing those Gifts which he presented be∣fore Marriage; but failing either in his Arguments or Proofs, the divorced Wife preserves her own Estate. Some Marry two Wives, but they are look'd upon as committing Fornication or Adultery; but of late, Custom, and the common practice, makes the offence not altogether so hainous. ¶ THeir Youth and Batchellors have their peculiar Residence; for in every Village, as we said before, 16 Houses have their Chappel,Umarry'd People have their Dwelling, apart. in which they have distinct Lodgings, as in a Colledge, where they keep their Batchel∣lors Place, though Marry'd, till such time as they go to live with their Wives. The Formosan Houses are artificial.The Formosan Houses are the handsomest, and exactest built of any after the Indian manner; for in stead of digging deep, they raise a Foundation six Foot high of firm Clay; the Walls of the Fabrick are rais'd onely with Reeds and Rushes, artificially strengthen'd with interweavings, having four Doors opening to the four Winds; but the prime Buildings have eight:Their Houshol-sluff. The Orna∣ment without, and Furniture within, are Stags Crested Heads, and wild Boars, Chinesie Raiments, and Deer-skins; and also Assagays, or Javelins, Shields,
Swords, Bowes and Arrows, Cattel, Axes, Cans, Pitchers, and Troughs, Ves∣sels of Barks of Trees, and Earthen Ware. But they pride most in the Bones, Sculls, and hairy Scalps of Enemies Conquer'd by their own Hands. They use no private,Feasts. but publick Feasts, to which every sixteen House-Parish repair, being kept in their little Temple, or Chappel, where after their Devotion to their gods, they spend the rest of their time in Feasting, Singing, Dancing, and all manner of Idolatry; and he that appears there in a Dogs-hair Coat, is the bravest Fellow. Strang ordering of their Dead.¶ THe manner of disposing of their Dead, and Funeral Obsequies, are thus: When any dies, the Corps being Laid out, after 24 hours they elevate it upon a convenient Scaffold, or Stage, four Foot high, Matted with Reeds and Rushes, near which they make a Fire, that so the Corps may by degrees dry: to which Place the Friends of the Deceased daily flock toge∣ther, and that they may keep up sorrow the better, bring along with them store of Mans-flesh, and several strong intoxicating Liquors. But before the sick Person departs, being just ready to give up the Ghost, thus they begin their inebriating grief: One beats on a Drum made of a hollow Tree, which gives notice of a Person deceased; at which Summons the Women come from all Parts near, bringing Pots and Vessels of strong Drink with them, and ma∣king themselves,Strange Dancing. and the Relations of the Deceased, Drunk. They Dance all Night before the Door after this manner: They take a Trough like a Chest, but longer and broader, and turning the bottom upwards, the Women get up, and two by two, Back to Back, move their Legs and Arms in a Dancing time and measure; which pace, or taboring tread, sends a kind of a murmur∣ing, or doleful sound from the hollow Tree; when these mounted Couples are weary, they come down, and others supply the Place: thus the Maudlin-Drunkards Dance nine days together, whilst the Body lies parching by the Fire, sending forth a very noysom stench: then having bathed the Corps▪ nine days over, they wrap it up close in a Mat, and lay it higher than before, so co∣vering it with a fitted Canopy from all light, there lying three year, till such time as nothing remains but a Skeleton, all else being consum'd to Dust; then they Interr him in his own House, with all the Ceremony of Feasts, as if lately departed. How strangely they or∣der their Sick.¶ THe ordering of their Sick is no less unnatural and preposterous, for they use them worse than if the Devil were their Doctor; for in stead of Potion or Pill, and the like, they use but one Medicine for all Disea∣ses, and that's a dry Halter, especially in the Village Teopan, for as soon as any Person falls sick, and begins to complain, lying down, and not able to walk about and follow his business, they presently prepare a tough Cord in stead of Cordial, so putting the Noose about his Neck, they hoist him up to the top of the House with a Pulley kept for that purpose, then let him suddenly fall with a Jolt, which commonly proves immediate Cure by killing of them; yet some mend upon this choking Medicine, either by the strength of Nature, or their spirits irritated by the fright. The Religion of the For∣mosans.¶ THe Formosans neither Write nor Read, using no Books, Letters, nor Characters: but yet that Law and Religion which they have amongst them, they observe without alteration, delivering it by Tradition
from Generation to Generation: for certain young Men are appointed to be in∣structed from the elder; and faithful Memories are their onely Registers and Records. First they believe the Universe, Heaven and Earth, to have been without beginning, and shall be without end; next the immortality of the Soul; for which reason they build a little Place, in which they put a Tub of Water with a Dish in it, before the Door of the Deceased, supposing the Spi∣rit thereof comes daily thither to bathe or cleanse. The next Article of their Faith is, that there are several Punishments after this life, according to the equality of their Crimes, and Rewards of eternal happiness for those that have, when living, merited by doing well: therefore they dig broad and deep Trenches, filling them with Mud and Slime; over, which they make a floating Bridge of bundled up Rushes, which leads to the most delightfullest and luxu∣rious Vales in the Countrey: over these, as they affirm, the Souls of the De∣ceased must pass, which the Wicked endeavoring to cross, the unstable Truss, or rowling Bridge, tumbles them over into their Stygian Lake: but the Just and Godly walking in safety over, enjoy there all pleasure in an everlasting Elysium. What they account sins.Those sins which they account most hainous, are but frivolous toys, built upon Superstition and sleight Observation, as not to go naked (as we said be∣fore, at their set and appointed times; to wear Clothes or any thing of Silk; Women to bear Children before their 37th Year; to fetch and eat Oysters not in due season; and to venture to undertake any business, though of little or no consequence, before they have observed good Auguries from the Notes or Language of the Birds: All these are Capital, and as they hold forth, unpar∣donable Offences; but Murder, Theft, Lying, and Forswearing, these have their Qualifications, for some may commit them, and some may not, without any scruple; but in general they are look'd upon no more than peccadillo's, and venial Offences. When they take an Oath, they ratifie it by breaking a Straw. To be a publick and common Drunkard, and to be an Adulterer and debaucher of young Women, if carry'd privately, is no harm. Though they believe the immortality of the Soul, yet they utterly deny the resurrection of the Body. Their chiefest Idols.Amongst their several gods which they worship, the chiefest are Tumagisan∣hach, who Governs and Inhabits the South, his Celestial Spouse; Taxankpada Agodales, commands the East, where when it happens to Thunder, they be∣lieve that she exercises her Tongue, the Females best Arms, scolding so loud at her Husband in the South, because he neglects his Office, not fending Rain when the Earth needs; who being netled with his Wives bitter and sharp ex∣pression, not enduring to hear her any longer, opens his Mouth, sending, and dispersing with his Breath abundance of Water. Another Deity which they worship out of fear, because Tamagisanhach, as they say, creates Men with comely Visage, and well proportion'd Bodies; this being an angry and ill natur'd Power, delighting in mischief, makes it his whole business to, spoil and misshape what Tamagisanhach hath made fair and handsom, disfiguring their Faces with Pox and Blasting, bunch∣ing their Backs, withering and crooking their Limbs, and the like, then deriding at their lameness and deformity: so this Sariafing they hold in great veneration, that he would be pleased to spare them, and do them no harm.
Their gods of War.When they take up Arms, and proclaim Hostility, they offer Sacrifices to Talafula and Tapaliape, their two gods of War. Wemen perform Divine Services.¶THeir Priests, or rather Priestesses, which they call Inibs, are Women, the whole Function of Divine Service, or Worship, belonging to them; for they not onely Pray to their gods, and Preach, but also Sacrifice: their chiefest Offerings are Stags and Boars-heads, presented in a Charger upon boyl'd Rice, Pynang, and other strong Drinks, as a Condiment: this perform'd, two of the Female Order stand up before the Congregation, and make a Ser∣mon; in which they set forth the praise and honor of their gods, going on with that vehemency of expressions, and loud declamations, that at last their Hair stands upright,Strange actions. and their Eyes rowling, seem ready to start out of their Heads; then near the conclusion of these their dire Exhortations, they fall down in a Trance, and oftentimes lie so for a whole hour, whilst the Peo∣ple gathering near them, tear their Throats, and cleave the Air with hideous shreeks and cries: when coming to themselves in a cold and faint Sweat, their Limbs trembling, their Teeth chattering, strangely discompos'd, they tell the People, that in their Trance the gods appear'd to them, unfolding mysteri∣ous things for their good, not yet to be express'd; besides two others of these Women mount the Battlements of the Temple, and standing at the gable ends, they make fresh, loud, and long Supplications to their gods: At last they strip themselves, and thus denuded, crying more earnestly to their gods, and first shaking, then taboring, or clapping with their Hands, raging as in a phanatick distraction. All the Women, following their impudent example, throw off with their Weeds all shame at once,Drunkeness a Vertue and so Tope and Deboush, till they disgorge this their too plentiful excess. Besides this their publick Worship in the Temple, they Offer in the open Streets, and exercise private and domestick Devotions, performing Family-Duties daily in their own Houses, to which those that please may repair, and joyn with them in this their Idol-Service. The Office of the Inibs.With these Inibs also they consult concerning fair or foul Weather, when they have any business abroad, also of future Events, which they seem to fore∣tell, and if bad, advise how to prevent, or at least to mitigate: They also pro∣fess Exorcism, and to drive away evil Spirits, to charm and confine the Devil, and all such deceitful Tempters; which they perform in a Rant, with loud hectoring acclamations, drawing a Japan Faulchion, with which they Fence, Strike, and Thrust, flourishing it in the Air, making them believe, that thus they Fight the Fiend, and slice Satan out in Sippets, forcing him, thus being mangled and cut almost into Atoms, to dive for his better safety into the Sea. Formosan become Chri∣stians.Yet these so salvage People, and blind with an over-grown ignorance, have lately (since the Hollanders East-India Company settled here, and built a Fort for their Defence and conveniency of Trade,) without any great difficulty embraced the Doctrine of the Christian Faith,Why they are easier Converted than other In∣dians. which was the easier introduced, the Inhabitants being their own Governors, and under no supreme Authority, who exercising a tyrannical Power, would, as other Persecutors, force them back from Gods true, to their false Idol-Worship, as at that time most part of India was, being either under Heathen or Mahumetan Governors, who with great fury obstructed the Gospel, which else might have flourish'd through the Oriental World: Besides, the Formosans kept no Books, wherein the bounds of Religion were fix'd, and a setled maintain'd Doctrine, which still caus'd
great variance and hot Disputes amongst themselves; the whole Con∣duct of their Divine Laws being left to a few frantick and ignorant Women, who know nothing but by Tradition. This made it the more easie to reduce them from their Paganism and Idolatry; and finding little in their frenzied Inibs, that might perswade them to persist in their former Superstitions, many of them, with small difficulty, became good Christians. Trade of the Netherland∣ers in Formosa.¶ THEre the Netherlanders drive a great Trade with the Chinese Junks, which come from the River Chincheo, and the City Aymoy. The Merchan∣dises which they deal for and Barter, are Transported from thence to Japan, India, and Holland. When the Vessels make a slow Return from Aymoy, lapsing the usual time when they should freight themselves with their Goods for Japan, or Batavia, then the Hollanders Sail thither; where for ten Tails, eve∣ry Tail being a French Crown, they buy a Picol of Silk, weighing a hundred and twenty pound. Why Formosa is of such great concern.¶ THis Island is of great Consequence to the Hollanders, because by this means they obstruct the Spanish Trade both with China and Japan; which Inconvenience the Castilian well observing, to prevent, Anno 1626. going ashore on the North Point of Formosa, cast up a Fort with all speed,The Castilians set upon the Netherlanders in Formo∣sa. calling it Kelang. Yet though thus setled, they rested not, but Rigg'd a great Fleet, hoping to drive the Hollanders from Tyovan: But foul Weather frustrated their Design. After that, the Portuguese undertook the like in Macaw; but had the same ill Success. This was also no small Obstacle to the Japanners, who drove a very profitable Trade in Formosa, before the Hollanders built their Fort Zelandia there; for after being much obstructed by this means, and though they complain'd at home, could set no Redress;Japanners complain of the Netherlanders. So whilst the Business was agitated on all sides, the Hollanders losing no time, but making advantage of the Opportunity, took Kelang, and made themselves Masters of the whole Isle. The Chinese War is the occasion of the loss of For∣mosa.¶ BUt whilst they thus setled themselves there, the State of China was turn'd topsie-turvey; and that long and well setled Government, fix'd and confirm'd with all the Ligatures of Strength and Cementing Policy, was utterly subverted, and quite overthrown, by a horrid and grand Rebel∣lion. This Combustion first brake out in the Province or Kingdom of Suchu∣en; and though but small at first, yet afterwards the whole Empire was in∣volv'd in the like Flames, and Publick Calamity; which thus happen'd: This Countrey hath a Tract of barren and inaccessible Mountains, which formerly were sculking Receptacles for a few guilty Persons that had commit∣ted Theft and Murder, and other such hainous Offences;Robbers in China. after it became the Asylum or Sanctuary for all sorts of petty Criminals, such as Cheaters and Bankrupts, who suppos'd the open Air better than a close Prison; then Hector∣ing Debouchers made there their Summer-Progress; next, all sorts of Vagabonds, fearing the Whip, flock'd thither; and at last, those that were pinch'd with Poverty, and not inamour'd with Labor, betook themselves also to this kind of idle Life: So growing numerous, they began to draw down in Bodies, Attaquing whole Villages, and carrying away the Booty to their Dens and obscurè Recesses in the Mountains. Thus flesh'd and encourag'd, deserting the Hills, and their former Aboads, they pitch their Camps in open Plains,
and spoiling where-ever they came, soon over-run that whole Province, and left nothing to Conquer but the Metropolis Chinghi; not questioning (such was their audacious Resolution) to make themselves Masters of that Rich and Populous City: Which they had done, and without any great difficulty, but that a Woman, a Virago, inspir'd with more than a Masculine Spirit, by her Courage, Care, and Conduct, so baffl'd them in all their Endeavors, giving them Repulse upon Repulse, that at last, with Loss and Dishonor, they were forc'd to quit their Enterprise, which had wholly dissipated their whole Army; when two Commanders of the Imperial Forces, then drawing thither from Queichew, utterly to quell this horrid Insurrection, fell at variance betwixt themselves; and the Difference grew so high, that one of them to be reveng'd of the other, quitted his Loyalty, and carry'd over his whole Brigade to the despairing Rebels; who thus reinforc'd, joyning together, set on the Empe∣rors remaining Party; in which Battel, satisfying his Revenge, he not onely slew the General his Antagonist, but they beat the Vice-Roy of Tutang, and rout∣ed his whole Army: But yet soon after, he bestirring himself, recruited so his Forces, that though he could not utterly dissipate them, he brought them to Conditions, and to pay him double the Damage of what ever they had gain'd in that Predatory War. But the Rebels, when thus languishing, having nothing left but the Moun∣tains which first foster'd them, retreated thither; when about that time, all things in a manner setled, several of the Northern Provinces of China were in∣fested with the destroying Plague of Locusts, which covering the whole Coun∣trey, devour'd what ever was fit for Humane Sustenance, bringing an extreme Famine:Great Famine. which the Rich were able to bear out; but the Poor were so driven to the worst of Exigencies, Starving, that they every where, stirr'd up by the Example of those of Suchuen,It makes Robbers. fell to pilfering and stealing; and gathering at last into Parties, to Robbery and Murder; setting, in like manner, upon whole Towns and Villages: And soon after, they form'd eight several Ar∣mies, selecting those they thought most likely, and fittest for Valour and Con∣duct, to be their Commanders; who growing skilful, (practising dayly Mar∣tial Discipline) suddenly brought these great Bodies in good Order and Array. With these marching, as they had well-design'd, several ways, they made themselves Masters of whole Kingdoms and Provinces, none being able to withstand such an universal Inundation of Arms: And thus making the whole Riches of the several Countreys which they enter'd, their Spoil, they gather'd up an inexpressible Mass of Treasure; by which enabled, as they then thought, to wage War with the whole World, having in their hopes already devour'd the vast Empire of China; all which perhaps might have been done, had they unanimously joyn'd to carry on the Work together;The Robbers in China fall at variance amongst themselves. when their eight Generals, every one of them stirr'd up by Ambition, began to contrive how he might be Lord and Master of all, and either destroy, or make the rest his Inferiors. Upon these Terms they all stood, clashing one at another in their Consultati∣ons and Councils; and at last, the Difference increasing, they divided into Factions, and began a Civil War amongst themselves, which was carried on with so much eagerness and blood-shed, that eight Generals were reduc'd to two onely, Lycunghus, and Changienchunghus. And these also not easily suffering any Equal, but both ambitious to be ab∣solute and sole Commanders, not onely of what the remaining Corrival en∣joy'd, but also of those Forces which had lost their Leaders in their late Dis∣sentions,
clandestinely plotted each others Destruction; which failing, they came to a better understanding of their present Condition, from the sad Ex∣ample of their six slain Competitors: So coming to Articles of Agreement, That Licunghus should march into, and have for his part the Spoil of the two next Southern Provinces, Xensi, and Honan; and the other General, Changihen-chungus, was contented to Plunder the two Northern Territories, Suchuen, and Huquang; whereupon both seeming well satisfied, dividing their Armies, they parted; Licungzus for Xensi, all which Territory he soon Pillag'd and Con∣quer'd; and making his way by force of Arms, broke into the pleasant Coun∣trey of Honan, where lying down before Caifung, meeting a rougher Enter∣tainment than he expected, their Cannon always thundering from the Walls, though he made furious Assaults, yet he was twice repuls'd, with the Loss of many Men: So finding that Storming would prove in vain, he resolv'd by Starving to force them to a Surrender; to which purpose, he block'd up all the Avenues with a close Leaguer, which brought the Besieg'd to that extreme Necessity and Want, that their Miseries might have been compar'd with the Calamities of any City suffering in that kind: Yet still with an undaunted Courage they held out, expecting to be reliev'd by Zung-chinus the Emperor himself, who accordingly came with his Army near Caifung. This City stands in a Valley, on the South-side of the River Huang, about three Miles distant; whose Waters using to swell very high, after great Rains falling in the Moun∣tains, they kept off from damaging the City, with a Wall, built where the Banks were lowest. This Water-fence the Emperor broke down, designing to destroy the Enemy in his Camp, lying near the City; in which he fail'd not: for such was the violence of the sudden Inundation, that Licungzus being surpriz'd, with the loss of many Men, was forc'd to raise his Siege. Destruction of the City Caifung.But this comfortable Relief, and the Joy of their Delivery from so power∣ful an Enemy, was but of a short continuance, a greater Misery soon over∣taking them, and indeed their utter Destruction; for the Waters that were friendly at first, swelling to such a height, became their deadly Enemies, scaling their Walls, beating down stately Temples and Houses, and at last (in a general Deluge) swallowing the whole City; where perish'd no less than 300000 Souls. The Robber Licungzus is Conqueror.But the Rebel Licungzus upon this Accident rallying up his scatter'd Forces the had escap'd the Flood, March'd on, carrying all before him wheresoever he went, bringing at last the Emperor to that straight of Necessity, that ut∣terly despairing, he hang'd himself in his own Palace at Peking. The Empe∣ror had three Sons; the Eldest escap'd, yet was never heard of; but the other two the Insulting Conqueror Beheaded. Now being Absolute, and Reigning as Emperor in Zung-chinus stead, looking about, saw nothing that could hinder him to settle the Empire upon himself and his Posterity, but Usanguejus, who with a Standing Army guarded the Walls and Borders, keeping out the Incursive Tartar, whereupon he sent, com∣manding him to take the Oath of Allegiance. But he, either scorning to be under a Rebels Subjection, or conceiving that it would be more for his Safety and Advantage to trust a Foreign Prince, that would undoubtedly hearken to such Proposals; and he also having the Opportunity, by guarding the Passa∣ges, mov'd the whole Business to the Emperor of Tartary;Ʋsanguejus fetches in the Tartars against Licungzus. who gladly watching all Occasions, accepted of it, and suddenly March'd in with Eighty thousand Men, to try his Fortune against Licungzus, who surpriz'd with the
News of this sudden Expedition of the Tartars, and not able to form so great an Army as might withstand him, the Enemy being near at hand, he remov'd his Court farther into the Countrey, to Sigan, making that his Imperial City; and with him convey'd from thence the vast Treasure which former Emperors had been gathering Two hundred and eighty Years.Vast Treasures of the Chinese Emperor. Eight days were spent in carrying away the Wealth through the four Gates of the City, upon Cammels, Horses, and other Beasts of Burthen, which from Sun to Sun went laden with Silver and Gold, and all manner of costly Gems, and Jewels of invaluable Worth: But in the way, this Prize of prodigious Estimation the Tartar seiz'd on. Thus gaining both Wealth and Reputation, he soon became Master of Peking,Tartars become Masters of China. Lycunghus is slain. and presently after defeated Lycunghus, with his whole Army, inso∣much that he was never heard of more. Then he Rewarded Usanguejus, who in the great Distraction of the Nation (both Parties setting up several of the Ancient Blood-Royal, deposing and killing one another) stuck to the Tartar, proving so faithful to his Trust, that he made him King of Xensi; and soon after, his Son Xunchi, being a Child, was chosen Emperor. Pyracy at Sen by Iquon.¶ BUt whilst China was thus shatter'd and harras'd by Land, arose a great Pyrate at Sea, call'd Chinchilung (by Strangers and Foreign Traffickers known by the Name of Iquon) who serv'd first under the Portuguese at Macaw, and afterwards the Hollanders in Formosa: Now setting up for himself, got a Crew of loose,Iquon's strange Rise. debauch'd Chineses, which daily increasing, with their Forces grew not onely Considerable, but so Great, that he made himself Admiral of the Sea, ingrossing the whole Indian Trade to himself; holding Correspon∣dence, and driving Commerce with the Spaniards at the Philippines; with the Hollanders, in Formosa and Batavia; and with the Portuguese, at Macaw and Japan. Through his Hands also was all the Chinese Merchandise Transported abroad, and Foreign Commodities Imported thither; by which he got such a Mass of Treasure, (Commanding at least Three thousand Vessels) which rais'd his Ambition so high, that he thought of no less than to be Sole Commander at Land, as well as at Sea. But the Tartar, not a little troubled at such his Greatness and Power, nor being able to redress himself at Sea, having no Fleet of his own; since Strength would not prevail, us'd Policy, promising him, if he would come in, and be as a Friend, to make him King of two Kingdoms, viz. Fokien, and Quantung. Thus allur'd by the Golden Bait of a Crown, little suspecting that under such fair Proffers lay worse Designs, he accepted the Overture, and brought his Fleet into the Haven, before the City Focheu; where going to Treat further concerning the Emperors Gracious Of∣fer, the King of Fokien poyson'd him at a Banquet;His death. which his Son and Bro∣thers hearing, suddenly made their escape to Sea, revenging their Brothers Death on all whoever happen'd in their way; and whilst their Fury was thus high, they fell upon Formosa. Coxenga, formerly a Clothier of Putman, afterwards Governor of Tyoan, had now the Command of the Fleet; and having a private grudge at the Hollanders, because they would not assist him against the Tartars, went with six hundred Junks, whereof some carried forty Guns, well Mann'd, and provi∣ded with all Necessaries,Coxenga lands in Formosa from China to Formosa, where he Landed several thou∣sands of his Men, who made so great a Havock and Slaughter amongst the Inhabitants,His Cruelty there. that neither sparing Young nor Old, they put them all to the Sword. The Women they stripp'd stark naked, driving them through their
Army, and Ravishing them. Such as they thought not handsom, they more disfigur'd; putting out their Eyes, cutting off their Noses, and driving them in that lamentable condition to the Fort Zelandia. Others they hew'd in pieces; to which miserable end came also three Dutch Ministers, Anthonius Hambrock, Arnoldus Vinsenus, and Peter Mus. These and the like Cruelties they us'd, and others such as were never heard of by any. The first Assault they made, was upon the Fort Kelang; which being too weak to resist against so powerful an Enemy, the Besieg'd were forc'd to a Surrender. The Chineses being encourag'd by this their good Success, march'd next to Zelandia, which was Fortified with three double Walls, standing upon an Isthmus between Formosa and the Island Baxambaya. Close by, and under the Command of the Fort, the Netherlanders had setled their Residences. This Plot the Chineses long before had in Design;The Chineses had a De∣sign along time against For∣mosa. which to effect the better, they brought their Junks into the Haven or Tyoan, a place of Free-Trade for the Chineses, many of them residing there, who against their coming, had furnish'd themselves privately with store of Arms, and cover'd their Houses with Cow-hides, and had all things in such a readiness, that upon a Moments warning, they cast up Breast-works against the Fort Zelandia; whereupon Hans Jurricaen, a Serjeant at Arms, and some of the Besieg'd, went to Coxengo, to understand and take a view of the Enemies Forces. Before the Fort stood a Bulwark, just behind the place of Execution, against which the Chineses cast up a Platform, which did much hurt to the Fort Zelandia; and also took the Bulwark before the Castle, in which a hundred Chineses were blown up into the Air: for the Hollanders, upon their departure from the same, left lighted Matches in their Store-Chamber, where the Powder lay, which took Fire just at that instant when the Chineses enter'd. But this Loss of theirs, cost the Hollanders dear: For though soon after there arriv'd five Ships from Batavia, to the Relief of Zelandia, against the Chineses; yet they had such ill suc∣cess in their first Attempt, that going ashore on Baxombaya, to Storm a Fort which the Chineses had newly cast up, they were so roughly entertain'd, that they were forc'd to Retreat,Hollanders are beaten by the Chineses. with the Loss of Three hundred and eighty Men. Upon this their so great Defeat, Coxengo sent in a Dutch Minister, one of his Prisoners, to Frederick Cojet, who Commanded Zelandia, advising him with all speed to deliver up the Town and Castle; which if he refus'd, and obstinately stood out, he would without Mercy put all his Prisoners immediately to the Sword: But the Governor would not so deliver up All, and such a Charge as he was intrusted with; and so slighting his Threats, sent his Refusal: Upon which, Coxengo finish'd the bloody Massacre which he had begun, putting all the Remainder of the Prisoners to the Sword. Yet Cojet (though much trou∣bled at the loss of so many of his Countrey-men) stoutly defended the Fort against all their Forces; till his Men wearied with continual Duty, being daily Storm'd and Assaulted on all sides, tir'd and out of heart, he not being able to hold out longer, Surrender'd.Cojet delivers up Zelan∣dia to the Chineses. The Articles were these: That the Besieg'd might in safety go aboard their Ships: That whatever Prisoners were taken since the Massacre on both sides, should be exchang'd; and the Fort Zelandia, with all the Treasure, Ammunition, and whatever else belong'd to it, to be deliver'd. Where Cox∣enga found ten Tun of Gold, forty Pieces of Ordnance, and other things of great Value. So accordingly they went aboard their five Ships, and Sail'd back, having sustain'd all these great Losses, to Batavia; where Cojet was call'd
in question concerning his delivering up of the Fort Zelandia, the State there being much troubled with the Damage that might follow, by the loss of such a considerable Place,The Japan Trade was molested thereby. from whence their Trade to Japan might be utterly ob∣structed by the Chinese Junks. Mean while the Tartar, the new Emperor of China, sent Ambassadors to the Hollanders at Batavia, offering to assist them, and help to revenge their Cause, by driving the Chinese Pyrates out of Formosa. The Netherland-Fleet proceed on in their Voyage to Japan.¶ IN the Interim, the Ambassadors for Japan, being upon their intended Voyage, came at last to the Island St. Clara, before the Southern Point of Cikako, which is a Rocky and High Land; from whence Steering North and by West, they were incounter'd the second Night with a great Storm; which overcoming, though with great difficulty, they descry'd on the seven∣teenth of September, the Fore-land of Nangesaque; of which nevertheless be∣ing doubtful, they yet continu'd on their Course, and about Noon, Weather∣ing the Point, they got to the Northward. The Land lying low, and they Strangers to the Coast, they were much troubled; and the Pilots seeing more Islands opening near the Mouth of the Bay of Nangesaque, growing more diffident, stood again to the Offin, where they discover'd two Japan-Vessels, Steering Southward; and making towards them, they were forc'd (being over-power'd by the Gale, then growing fresher and fresher) to leave their Design of Intelligence: But soon after they descry'd another Japan-Vessel, to which drawing near, and Hailing, not understanding one another, they lost that Labor also. When early on the eighteenth day, the Point of Nangesaque appear'd North-North-East, about five Leagues and a half distant; and the Island Goto, North-North-West: By which Position of the Course, they knew they were in the right Channel, which would lead them safely to the Harbor; and by Night they reach'd the Point or Promontory of Nomoo, which extends it self South-West along to the Bay of Arima. Thus they wrought themselves up within four Leagues of Nomoo, lying North and by East, in thirty Degrees Northern-Latitude, from thence plying Easterly onely with their Fore-Sail. The next Morning they enter'd,Come into the Bay of Nangesaque. with all their Sails a-trip, running up mer∣rily to the Northern Shore, into the Bosom of the Bay of Nangesaque, behind the Summit of whose opposite Coast rises a Rock resembling a Steeple; be∣yond which, seven Leagues to the Southward, stands Nangesaque; passing which, Sailing on to their Harbor, they incounter'd many Isles, and some Rocks; which all opening, seem'd courteously to entertain and give them a Passage: So by Noon they Rode before Nangesaque, having six Fathom and a half Water, and a Clayie Ground; where they found six more of their Friends, Dutch Vessels. Frisius his Entry into Nangesaque.¶ AT this time Derick Sneck was Consul there for their East-India Company; where also was Philip Shillemans, Governor of Tonking, who as soon as the Fleet arriv'd, went aboard, to wait upon, and conduct with all Cere∣mony of State Andreus Frisius, being appointed by the Council at Batavia, to succeed in the Place of the deceas'd Ambassador Bloccovius. With the like For∣mality and Honorable Respect, the Embalm'd Corps of Bloccovius was brought ashore and interr'd, to the Wonder and Admiration of the Natives.
Derick Sneck Sails to Batavia.¶ THe first of October, Derick Sneck went from Nangesaque to Batavia, whose Place Antonius Brekhurst supply'd, who was also added as Colleague to Andreus Frisius, in his Address as Ambassador to Quaeme, then Emperor of Japan, (Residing in his great City of Jedo) concerning the Free-Trade and Commerce between the Hollanders and his Subjects. According to the great Consequence of this Embassy, an answerable Train and Equipage was pre∣par'd; but being not well setled, since their coming from Firando to Nange∣saque, their Store-houses were as yet out of order; so that there was a confusion in the carrying on of their Procedure: And though Nangesaque is a more Rich and Populous City, and more resorted to than Firando, yet that Island had better Conveniencies, and fitter for the Hollander to Trade upon. Description of the Castle Firando.¶ THis Countrey produces nothing worthy, nor any thing to show, but the Castle in which Firandano, Brother to the Lord of the Island, in∣habits. The Castle stands amidst a pleasant Mead, to which they pass over a Bridge of blue Slate, which leads unto the Base Court, guarded on each side with a File of Musquetiers. The Gate is cover'd with a double Penthouse, one a good distance beneath the other: The opposite Jaumes are adorn'd with the Emperors Arms, and those of their Noble Family. The Castle standing upon a Hill, shews it self in Prospect at a great distance, because its Tower or Spire being seven Stories, tapering in a Pyramidical Form, appears afar off. Upon each side of the Castle open eight Doors, by which, on Steps cut out of the hard Rock, climbing the steep Ascent, they enter through several Doors to the Palace. Below are four Arbours of Pleasure, or Banquetting-houses, standing on square Pillars, built round with Galleries, and a Cupiloe on the top. This is all that Firando boasts.
But they were much troubled, whilest they were preparing to go upon this Embassy, being inform'd, that never any had Audience from his Imperial Ma∣jesty, if they did not open their way with rich and costly Presents before∣hand. It seems not here amiss to say something concerning the Description of the Countrey, Customs, and Character of the People; from a good Author, Johan∣nes Petrus Maffeus. ¶ THe Countrey,Jon Peter, Maffeus, Histo∣riar, lib. 12. Description of Japan. commonly call'd Japan, says he, is not one, but three Islands, whose Skirts or Margents are sprinkled round with many lesser. The greatest and wealthiest stands divided into three and fifty Provinces, or petty Kingdoms, the chief City call'd Meaco, gives its denomination to that Isle. The second Island call'd Ximus, divides it self into nine Principalities, whose most eminent Cities are Vosuquim, and Funaium. The third Division or Isle is Xicocum,Division. and hath onely four Vice-gerents, and famous for the City Tosa; so that the three Isles of Japan number 66 King∣doms, all subordinate under one Emperor. The whole Countrey extends in length almost 200 Leagues;Bigness. the breadth not answerable to the length, for the broadest part not being above thirty Leagues, and the smallest but ten; its circumference is not yet well known: and lying in a manner North and South, extends it self from thirty two, to eight and thirty degrees of Northern Latitude:Borders. The East looks towards Nova Hispania, but at 150 Leagues distance: The North Buts upon Seythia or Tar∣tary, and other unknown Countreys: The West views China, but far off, for from Liampo, a City standing on the most Eastern Point of China to Goto, being the most Western Island of Japan, where first the Ships arrive, makes sixty Leagues, and from Amaccen, on the most Western Harbor of the East-side of China, to the foremention'd Isle, is 290 Leagues. The South lies border'd with the wide washing Ocean, at great distance, unknown Territories, whence, they say, a strange People were drove by foul weather on the Coast of Japan, which setling there, never return'd. The Soil.¶ THis Climate, for the most part, is Snowy and cold, and the Soil not very fruitful; Rice, which is their general Food, and grows most plentiful there; they Reap in September their Harvest, for other sorts of Grain in many places is in May, which they Bake not to make Bread of as in Europe, but eat it soft, being boyl'd to a Pap, or Gruel: They have several warm Springs or Baths, which cure (as they say) many Distempers. Strange Mountains in Japan.¶ THe Countrey appears more Hilly than Plain, amongst which are two wonderfull Mountains, one of which Vomiting; continual Flames, with terrible smoke and fragors, a horrid Figure; fancy'd by some to resem∣ble the Devil, appears standing amidst a Circle of Fire, on the very top. The other call'd Figenoiama, reaches (as some report) several Miles, Perpendi∣cular above the Clouds, and middle Region of the Air.
¶ THis Countrey abounds in Mines,Mines. from whence the Inhabitants gather their greatest Riches; whose special care invites foreign Merchants to Trade and Barter with them. Trees. A wonderfull Tree in Ja∣pan.¶ THeir Trees or Plants which they set, either for use or pleasure, resemble ours, unless their Palms, which are of a tender and strange quality, contrary to all Plants whatsoever, for they endure no man∣ner of moisture, for if the least wet touch the Roots, they fade and wither im∣mediately, being destructive to them as Poyson; which to save and cure, they dig up, and dry the taken up Roots in the Sun, then set it in a new Hole fill'd with dry Sand, where being so Transplanted, it soon recovers, and reflourish∣eth in full verdure; those Boughs or Branches that are cut or torn off with Winds, or any other accident, they Nail on, which grows to the Body as well as if Graffed, or Inoculated. Cedars in Japan very great.Several places abound with Cedar, some of them so tall and large, that the Carpenters use their Limbs or Branches for main Timber, in their stateliest Buildings, and Shipwrights make Masts of them. Japanners live on Veni∣son.¶ THe Japanners neither breed nor keep Sheep, Swine, Geese, nor Poultry, nor eat scarce any other flesh but Venison; the Desarts are full of wilde Cattel, and untamed Steeds, of a good race: The Woods are full of Wolves, Bores, Stags and Conies. Beasts, and Fishes there.Amongst their several sorts of Fowl, they want not Pheasants, Ducks, wild Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, Quails, and Partridges. Here they have also abun∣dance of Fish, amongst which the Eells, and what they call Voom, they most esteem: Butter they know not, nor the use of Sweet Oil, but what they spend is prest out of Whales, which are often driven ashore upon their Coast. The meaner sort of People use neither Tallow nor Wax, but carry up and down to light them Branches of Pine Trees, in stead of Candles and Torches. Their shape and strength.¶ THey are something tall of Stature, and well Set, and easily endure Watching and other hardships, signs of a strong Constitution. From twelve to sixty years of Age, they are liable to Musters, Impresses, and Mar∣tial Affairs. They suffer their Beards to grow something long,Difference in Hair. and use se∣veral fashions in Shaving their Heads: Youths keep onely their Foreheads bare, the Rusticks and common sort imploy the Razor but on half their Heads; the Nobles leave onely a Tuft or Lock of Hair near the Nape of their Necks, which if any touch, they look upon as a high affront, and a great dishonor. The Japanners are a strong People.They much exercise their patience in all manner of sufferings, and are so in∣ur'd by Custom, that Hunger, Cold, Heat, and Thirst, Watching and Tra∣vel are their Play-Fellows; for as soon as born, though the weather happen to be extream cold and pinching, they carry out the Infants, and wash them in the Running Streams, where whilest they are cleansing, they let them paddle in the Water to save themselves from sinking: So soon as Wean'd, their first Lesson is the Art of Hunting, kept from their Mothers, and all Female Relations; their Schools of Learning, wherein they commence in Hardiness, are wild and unfrequented places, believing, that nothing makes them more ten∣der and effeminate, than to be near Women.
Their manner of sleeping and eating.¶ THe Floors of their Houses are Matted all over very curiously; and that they may tread the softer, stuft like a Quilt, which indeed, are rather their Couches or Beds, where laying themselves down, under their head in stead of a Down-Pillow a Log or Stone, whereon they well and quietly Repose. These Mattings are their Tables also, on which, sitting cross Legg'd, they take their Repast:Are very politick. Yet in their Diet, they are no less curious or dainty than the Chineses, and like them use two Sticks, one in each hand, with which they take up their Hash'd Service, needing neither Knives nor Forks, which they handle so dexterously; and these Tools are so fitted for their purpose, that they never let any thing fall, nor foul their Fingers; entering their Dining-Room, for the more cleanliness they pull off their Shooes. The meaner sort, especially those that live poorly, near the Coast, fare hard, eating onely Rice, Fish, and Sallets; but the Inlanders Feast daily, and feed plentifully like the Chineses. Rich Feasts.In stead of Table-Clothes and Napkins, their Dishes are serv'd up on little Boards or Tablets, being either Pine or Cedar, curiously Painted after their manner with various colours: Their prepar'd Dishes are heap'd up with va∣riety of Meat, like our Bisks or Olapotreeds, trick'd up with Leaf-Gold, the edges stuck about with Cyprus Branches: But when they Treat Noblemen, they gild the Bills, Feet and Leggs all over with Gold: They entertain their Friends and Strangers Chearfully, with hearty Welcome. During their time of Eating and Drinking, they hae several Customs which they perform with strange and Mimick Gestures, the whole Nation every where punctually observing the like: The Blood of the Grape is altogether unknown to them, but in stead thereof, they make their Wine of Rice; but above all, they are most delighted with Water heated, mixt with the Powder of Chia. Their Drink is made after a peculiar manner.In nothing they are more curious and diligent than in making this Com∣pound, which the Grandees themselves pride to prepare, when they entertain their Friends; for which purpose, to make this their special Liquor, they have peculiar places in their Houses, where in a kind of Furnace over a gentle Fire, it stands infusing, from whence when they are visited by Strangers, lifting up the lid, they take it up in Dishes, and present it hot, trowling the Cup about one to another. The Japan Treasures, wherein they consul.Their several Vessels which they use in this Preparation, are a kind of Lim∣beck, or Furnace, Tunnel, Stone, Cruses, Spoons, and Pots, in which they keep both the Herb and Powder of Chia. Their last Complement which they are most proud of, is to shew them their Wealth, boasting their accumulated Treasure: But their foremention'd Drink the Japanners esteem and value, more than we our Precious Stones, and Inesti∣mable Jewels. They also set a strange Rate upon Sword-Hilts, especially when made by some peculiar Masters. Their Houses and Cloy∣sters.Most of them dwell in Houses of clinch'd Wood, cover'd with slit Plankings, because of the frequent Earthquakes which happen there, so with falling, they suffer not much harm, and are soon repair'd; some dwell in Edi∣fices built of Stone, no less Costly than Artificial. Their Temples also are most Magnificent, with stately Cloysters, and Inclosures where their men and women are aparted.
The Japanners Tongue is very strange.¶ THe Japanners have one Tongue or Language in common, yet it is so various in Pronounciation, that it seems to be of several and distinct Dialects, for they use no Adjectives to their Substantives, as we do, but by va∣riety of words, they understand the matter to be good, bad, or indifferent, or what ever else; nay, more than this, they have several Tones, or Accents in their Speech, which are sharper or flatter like our Musical Notes, by which they distinguish their meaning: But their Princes speak by themselves in a Com∣manding manner, or in an Imperative Dialect; the Common People in a low∣er Stile; in brief, the Men and Women use not one Mode of Speaking. More∣over, Their manner of Writing is far different from their Vulgar Colloque, and they use one Character in their Writing, and another in their Printing, which are so different, that they nothing resemble: Their Books are also numerous, which are either Divine, Moral, or Heroick: Besides,As also their Character. they have one Letter or Character, which signifies a Word, nay, sometimes whole Sentence, not unlike the Chinese, or the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks, from whence the Japan Tongue is most difficult to be learn'd or understood. Their Arms.¶ THey much delight in War: Their Arms, besides Guns, Bowes, and Arrows, are Faulchions and Daggers, which they begin to wear, and exercise at twelve years of Age; their Faulchions or Scimiters are so well wrought, and excellently temper'd, that they will cut our European Blades asunder, like Flags or Rushes, the edge neither rebated nor notch'd. They have also Javelins Tipt with Gold or Silver, and their Pikes, which are longer, but lighter than ours, they know how to handle very dexterously. They often change their Apparel.They change their Clothes and Habits with their Years; when they are past their Puberty, and accounted of full Age, they wear a Coat or Tunick of various Colours, reaching to their Ankles, with which they go loose within doors; but going abroad, they tie it like long Breeches about their Legs, and gird about their middle, over which they wear a short Sleev'd Vest, by the Ja∣panners call'd Quimon. This manner of Habit, in Summer they wear very fine, and in the Winter a courser, stuft very curiously, or Quilted. Their Shooes are without Heels, in manner like Slippers, with a Horn-Ring fasten'd betwixt the great and second Toe. They carry Fans, Imbroider'd with Gold, with which they defend their Faces from the Sun, and cool when hot. Persons of Quality walk in State under an Umbrello or Canopy, but the Common sort of People go Bare-headed Winter and Summer, slighting Heat, Cold, Wind, and Weather. To be clad in Black or Scarlet, amongst them signifies Triumphs and Joy, but their Mourning for loss of Friends, and other Disasters, is White. The Customs of the Ja∣panners are opposite to the Europeans.¶ IT is scarce to be believ'd, with what (as one would imagine) study'd Op∣position they differ from us, both in their Clothing and Diet; and as for the Femelick Sense, or that of Smelling, whatsoever is most sweet, fra∣grant, and oderiferous to us of Europe, seems to them as abominable as the stench of Carrion, or what ever else is odious; And that which we account delicate, dainty, or well-season'd Dish, that they spit out, and their stomacks rise at: In like manner, what they highly commend, and seems to have a most delicious gust, that we as much abhor: We in heat of Summer affect cool and pure Spring Water, which they drink hot, liking what is muddy, better than what
is clear, and what ever Vocal or Musical Instruments, Singing or Playing, well Compos'd Airs, that are most Ravishing and Grateful to us, grace their Ears so much, that they will stop them with their Fingers, they seeming to them so harsh and dissonant. White, which through all the known world is counted the best Colour of Teeth, and though theirs being naturally Ivory, they disdain so much, that they make them artificially Ebbony, and the black∣er, the prouder they are of such a Beauty: And having the Spirit of Contra∣diction so much, that as we Mounting on the left side, they get up on the right side of a Horse; and as we vail our Hats when Saluting, they uncover their Feet, putting off their Shooes; As we rise, shewing our respect to Friends, or Persons of Quality, Saluting with Congees and the like Postures of Reverence, they sit down and take State upon them, so receiving the Addresses; and as we set a high Rate and great Value upon Pearls, Jems, and other Precious Stones, they look upon them as Whitings-Eyes, and Pebbles, admiring and gi∣ving Rates for old Iron and Earthen Ware; and as we have our Physick well prepar'd, the acerbity or other ill tastes taken off with Correctives, they take them simple in their own likeness, able to kill our Horses; and in stead of nourishing up their Sick with light Meats, fit for digestion, they stuff them up with course Feeding, not sparing to give them any sorts of Fish, either fresh or salt; and whatever the Patients Distemper be, they neither let Blood, not know the saving use of Phlebotomy. They are so grounded in these their con∣trary Customs and Manners, and so strongly opiniated in, that if any ask why they do so, they will not onely answer, but dispute very stifly in maintaining their Cause. The first quality of the Japanners are the Tori.¶ BUt though they differ thus in their common Customs, and other Opi∣nions, relating man to man, and equality of Persons, yet when they come into the solid Work of Government and Authority, they build by the same rule and policy, raising by degrees as we do. The first being the Foun∣dation or Basis of this Structure, they call Tone, which general Appellative de∣nominates several Orders and places, in which they execute Justice, differing as much as our Barons, Earls, Marquesses, Dukes, and Kings, all being subor∣dinate, and ending in a sole Monarch, the Emperor. These rule not by the Power of Riches, but by the Number of Men, for when they are chosen Go∣vernor, they give all their Lands to this their new Militia, reserving onely a small acknowledgement in Rent of being their Landlord, laying no other Taxes or Duties upon them, but to attend at Court at Festivals, and other seasons of the Year, and in War, to assist him at their own Cost and Charges. The Power of the Japan Kings, wherein it consists.So it happens, that though he be poor and boast no Treasury, yet he is ho∣norably attended in Peace at his Royal Palace; and in time of War, lends in∣to the Field a strong and numerous Army. But what is most to be admir'd, these Kings, though but Vice-Roy's, after once Elected, not wanting the suf∣frages of the People, Rule so Absolutely, that neither the Extremities of For∣tune, nor the Fear of Death, or ought whatsoever, will make them lay down their Title, or forsake the Power with which God, and their good Fortune, had intrusted them with. Resign up their Domini∣ons when grown old.But when grown old, he retires to a private Lodge, or House of Pleasure, beset with Orchards, and Gardens of delight; where whilest he Solaces him∣self, and takes comfort in Privacy, fit for his age, he orders his Son, or next Heir to take the Helm of Government, breeding him up to make him fit for that purpose from his Childhood.
The Bonzes, Japan Priests, what they are.Next to the Royal Authority, comes the Sacerdotal Order, or the Priest∣hood, Ruling all Ecclesiastical Affairs, Ordering their wicked Rights and abo∣minable Superstition. These are Shaven, both their Heads and Chins, and live single, using all the Formality and Gravity, both in their Speech, Looks, and Gesture, of those that are truly Religious: Under which appearance of Sancti∣ty, they commit all the Outrages of Lust, Avarice, and Revenge, but the blinded People, believing that they are Miracles of Piety, spare no cost to Maintain these Saint-seeming-Devils. These, amongst their other Functions, take special care in ordering of Obits, and Noble-mens Funerals, not onely as Church-men, but in the manner of Heralds, setting them forth with all Order and Ceremony, and going before the Herse, Singing new Elegies in honor of the Deceased. These are of several Orders and Societies, but they are all generally call'd Bonzi, most of them being of Noble Extract, and younger Brothers of Hono∣rable Families, forc'd by Necessity, take Orders upon them. In Japan are also several Schools and Colledges for the Education of Youth, on which are setled great Revenues for the Maintenance thereof. These Religious Persons were formerly in highest Repute amongst them, but since the Preaching of the Gospel, by which Doctrine their Vizards have been taken off, discovering them in their own horrible likeness, they have not onely lost much of their antient Reputation, but are rather abhorr'd and hated by the People, their once so much admirer. The Citizens are of the third degree amongst the Japanners.The third degre and honor are the Gentry, the Burgers, or Magistrates of Cities. Tradesmen the fourth.The next are Tradesmen and Artificers, which are exquisite in their man∣ner of Work. In the principal Towns are kept many Heralds-Offices, and Printing-Houses. Husbandmen the last.The lowest degree are Husbandmen, and those that follow Countrey af∣fairs; these by reason of their Poverty are subservient to the Rich, which in∣deed are very numerous. These People have several Vertues: First, they are generally good natur'd, of a kind and affable Disposition, of quick Apprehension, have ready Memo∣rie, and nimble Fancy, exceeding not onely many of their own Eastern Peo∣ple, but our Western, in solid Judgment, and aptness of Learning, insomuch that the Rusticks and their course-bred Children, appear rather like Gentle∣men in their courteous and civil behavior, and other deportments, than to be a Race of churlish Clowns.They are quick of Ap∣drion. They much sooner get the mastery of the Latine Tongue and any other curious Arts, either Mechannick or Speculative, than our Europeans. To be poor is accounted no dishonor,And Patient. nor are they much dif∣ferenc'd from others, by contempt, or taking notice of. They keep their House always clean neat; which done, they dress themselves accordingly, then walk abroad and make Visits. They abhor all manner of railing, or using loud and contumelious Language, Theft, vain Swearing, and such like Debaucheries. They fare covetous of good Fame, and fair Reputation,Covetous of Honor. and therefore also bear a Respect beyond belief to their Superiors, and all those under whose Authority they are.Will suer no Reproach. They are impatient in Points of their Ho∣nor or Honesty call'd in question, not enduring what tends to their affront or disparagement; and a false Accusation seems as bad to them as if condemn'd for a Criminal: therefore the meanest of them have a care to shew a Respect to one another at their meeting, never speaking ill, or calumniously in their
absence. The Nobles spend most of their discourse in praising and extolling each other,Are very faithful. commemorating still their many worthy Acts, and several Vertues: Nay, the meanest Handicraft, or Day-laborer, if any be minded to Hire or Emyloy them in such Drudgery, if they speak not civilly, and with respect to them, they will in a Huff refuse their proffers, and scorn their business. They behave themselves the most warie, and with greatest care, to avoid all Dis∣sentions and Quarrels, or the least Dispute; and if they have any antient Grudge, they never express it by their Tongue,Hide their Anger. but by their Looks, shewing onely a sad, or discontented Countenance; and rather than controvert their Cause, whether right or wrong,They never go to Law. and put to Arbitration, they will sooner lose it. They think it becomes not the Grandeur of any Person of Honor to speak much, or be talkative. Upon these accounts it happens, that there is neither Rangling, nor any Quarrels amongst the Common People passing through the Streets, nor the least Dissention betwixt Man and Wife, Parents and Children, Master and Servants; thus ordering their Affairs with all quiet and silence: and if any small Breach chance to happen, Friends make it up, and imme∣diately reconcile: And when they punish any Malefactors (which happens seldom) they forbear all opprobrious and foul-mouth'd Language.They never Scold. They have neither Courts of Judicatory, or any other Laws, as we in Europe: They lay up their private Revenges to spend in War against their publick Enemies. When they meet by chance together,Never complain of incon∣veniencies. or sitting at their private or publick En∣tertainments, none ever complains of his misfortune or trouble, either at home or abroad, nor of his Crosses or Losses in any Concern whatsoever; and have a wonderful faculty, to vail with a glad and cheerful Countenance their pinch∣ing griefs, and heart-eating sorrows: Thus they never molest or vex one ano∣ther with unnecessary and untimely Complaints, to the disturbance of the whole Company: Nay, if their Friends enquire of them what's the matter? they put it off with a well-feign'd Smile, or give a slender account of the busi∣ness, as not worth the mentioning: But if (which seldom happens) any be falsly accus'd, or scandalously reproach'd, whatever they suffer inwardly, they bear it with a setled and unchang'd Countenance,Why they are so patient. as not concern'd in the least tittle thereof. We may judge these Qualications of their springs from a greater prudence, and better temperature of spirits, considering the inconstan∣cy and vicissitudes of humane Affairs; for sure oftner than in any other Coun∣trey, alternate Fortune setting up, and casting down, raising Beggars to the Throne, and tumbling Kings from thence to the lowest step of poverty, plays her Jokes, now flattering, as soon frowning, by which, being so vers'd and practis'd in, they always remember in their greatest heighth, the lowest con∣dition, and stand prepar'd with an untroubled willingness, ready to receive any alteration, as if look'd for long before: But these you would believe not to be acquir'd Vertues by age and experience, but rather natural, which ap∣pears by their Children; for they shew by their Looks and Conversation, that they have a magnanimous Soul. But these their good Qualifications they shew not always, for they stand tax'd with as many Vices, insomuch that all which we have said before, may be thought rather to be a counterfeit and well acted Part as in a Play, than otherwise. Japan Religion is abo∣minable.¶ THeir Religion, or abominable Idolatry and Superstition, by several perswasions inclines them, not onely excellently well to dissemble
and cover their ill nature under the Cloak of Zeal, but also help'd by the inspiration of evil Spirits, their gods we may suppose they take delight in cru∣elty, bloodshed, and the like; of which their Preachers and Doctors are the Bonzies. Bonzies Doctrine.These, though differing amongst themselves, yet all agree concerning the Immortality of the Soul. Some hold forth in publick to Congregations; others of the superior Dignity inculcate their Divine Doctrine, and are as Chaplains in Noble-mens Houses, and the Families of Princes; but these Grandees to whom they belong, they little or seldom trouble with punish∣ments for Offenders in the World to come; but publick Ministers that openly Preach to the common People, always belabor the Pulpit with terrors of tortures, and eternal damnation in Hell. Amida and Xaca are two Japan gods.Besides these two Orders, there are others, who always make their Theme the praises of Amida and Xaca: These are their Saviors, on whom they build their Faith, and are to them as Law and Gospel, whom they must always im∣plore, not onely in calamity and trouble, but also in their times of Joy and greatest Felicity, That they would graciously be pleas'd by their merits to wash away their sins and offences, that so their Souls may come to ever∣lasting Bliss: these and their other supreme gods they call Frotoques.As also the Frotoques. They have also their inferior, or lesser rank, which they follow onely for worldly benefits, Praying for Health, Wealth, Children, and all transitory blessings: these they style Camis.And Camis. How they make Men gods.Though their gods are numerous, yet still they add, and make more of their Princes: for when any King, famous and much honor'd for his great Exploits and valiant Atchievements, deceases, they also, in the midst of their Funeral Solemnities, Instal, and Register in the Lift of their Deities, paying them ever after Divine Worship, as the antient Greek and Romans did so several of their eminent Hero's, they having gods much resembling these, such as Mars, Bacchus, Venus, Mercury, and others, making them first Examples,Wickedness of the Ja∣panners. after call upon them as Protectors in their hainous Debaucheries, as Lust, Drun∣kenness, and the like. Amongst other seeming Vertues, one especial ability they have, their Looks and Gestures still denote them to be the onely practisers of Piety and pure Zeal, when their Bosoms swell with projects of all manner of mischief: and where they bear the greatest, and most inveterate malice, resolving to be se∣verely reveng'd, there they Smile and Fawn, and in their Speech, Face, and Gesture, express nothing but their dear respects, love, and honor that they bear them: This is so common amongst them, that whosoever deals plain and honestly, speaks as he thinks, and performs what he promises, becomes a mocking-stock, and their onely May-game. They murder one ano∣ther on small occasions.Revenge is so sweet to them, that the first occasion of having any advantage in the very Streets, where stealing close behind the Person, drawing their Scy∣miter, if the first Stroke fail, the second dispatches him; which done the Asas∣sinate wipes his Sword, and Sheathing it, walks away unconcern'd, as if a Jest, or nothing done. Nay sometimes, having no Quarrel, in a meer Frol∣lick, they will try whether the Edges of their Blades be so tender, as to be bated, or turn upon one anothers Heads. Their cruelty on those which they Conquer.But those Towns or Villages have a sad destiny, which are taken in War by force of Arms, for they grant no Quarter, no respect of Age, Sex, or Degree, but are all promiscuously, and without mercy put to the Sword, and so left
weltring in one mothers Gore. And in like manner, any Party, or Army, when they are defeated in the open Field, of those not one escapes, either they are kill'd upon the Spot valiantly Fighting, or if they flye, are barbarously murder'd by the Countrey People; all one to them, Friend or Foe, for whom∣soever they find stragling, they without mercy dispatch, upon no other ac∣count but to strip them, and enjoy what they have: Filching and Stealing (as we said before) that they all abhor; but Robbery and Bloodshed they glo∣ry in: therefore all the whole Countrey groans under the Murders commit∣ted in Robberies by their Highway-men; and the Sea as much molested with Pyrates. Women with Child mur∣der their Infanis.¶ THeir Women also are as strangely merciless to their own Issues, mur∣dering without any Motherly compassion their tender Infants, either before their Birth, or if failing, soon after; to which purpose the Bonzies, their good Confessors, teach them a Drink to cause Abortion, which if by strength of Nature overcoming, as soon as born, they, worse than brutish Tygers, tread upon the Infants Neck, and so dispatch it; which they commonly do, either hating the trouble of Nursing them up, and giving Education, or else coun∣sell'd by ill advising Poverty, as not being able to maintain them. Poor and Needy Perish in Japan.¶ FOr Persons that are Sick, Lame, and Infirm, or Travellers, they have no publick Hospital, or other private Reception; but they are forc'd to take up their Lodgings under the cold Canopy of Heaven, fled from, and de∣serted of all Men; so that either they must recover of themselves, or else die there in a miserable manner, and when dead, thrown upon the Dunghil as Offal or Carrion. ¶ FOr all Crimes or Offences whatsoever,Punishments. they use but three Punishm∣ents, viz. Drubbing on the Soles of their Feet, Banishment, or Death, their Heads being cut off by a Scymiter, which they see not. But in some Places the Robbers being accounted the greatest Offenders, they carry and show them about in Waggons, which done, they Crucifie them and leave them nail'd to their Crosses in the High-ways near the City. Strarge Punishment for the Robels in Japan.When Persons are suspected for Treason, or Plotting Rebellion, the King sends a Party, which surrounds the House so close, that none can escape, then makes them onely two Proffers, either to kill themselves, or yield to Mercy; which if they accept, they are stigmatizi'd with hot Irons, so to be distinguish'd and known to have been Quondam-Traitors wheresoeuer they go; but if they chuse rather to be Self-Executioners,They cut up their own Bellies. they rip up their own Bellies: some of them with strange courage in a horrible manner open athwart, so that when their Bowels hang out, to be the sooner dispatch'd, they lay down their Heads, to be cut off by one of their Servants, whom they suppose hath most kindness for them: the rest of the Abetters, or Conspirators, scorning to out∣live their Captain, divide amongst themselves, making two Parties, bravely fighting, kill one another. The like they will do in many other Exigencies, and especially in private Quarrels, that concern their good Name and Reputation: Nay, their Chil∣dren themselves, when taking Pet against their Parents, or any such like un∣kindness, will desperately rip up their own Bowels.The Children rip up their own Bowels
They have no Laws.¶ THey have no Rules or Observations in driving their Trade, or ma∣king Bargains, but all is left fast or loose to the will and plea∣sure of those that Deal, taking no Cognisance of Promise, or any Signing of Contracts, or Articles of Agreement. And in Cities the antient Burgers have no more Priviledge than the new-come Foreigners. Their Tradesmen and Artificers not being imbodied in Societies, or Companies; no Guilds nor other Courts to Plead in, nor Try'd before a Judge and Jury. No Serjeants or Actions to lay hold on Debtors; but all Controversies are decided by force of Arms, and Judg'd by the arbitrary Power of their King, from whom there is no Appeal. These Monarchs have absolute Power over their Nobles, commanding and sending, without any farther Trial, when they please for their Heads. The Nobles thus domineer over the Gentry, the Gentry over the Citizens, all of them exercising the like Authority over their own Families. ¶ THeir Kings, though they keep not in Pay Strangers, nor any hir'd Soldiers,Ambassadors of the Ja∣pan Kings. onely depending upon the favor and good-liking of their Sub∣jects, yet they expect to receive from them the same Honor and Obedience, as if they had all the Countrey in Custodiam, and their whole Militia, Strangers. Either sitting in the Throne, or walking, they are still surrounded with a con∣stant Guard, which keep off all Petitioners; and if any with great difficulty are permitted to make their humble Address, the King never answers them but with a Frown or a Nod, or else by Writing. Are oftentimes remov'd.But for all this Greatness, if the People take a spleen, and rise against them, they are often left destitute, and not able to raise any Assistance. But some∣times Subjects are divided, one Party Royalists, standing for the King; the other Commons, in Defensive Arms for the People, which oft joyn Issue in Bat∣tel, and according to the success thereof, either he is depos'd, or sits better set∣led in his Throne: But when the People get the better, and proceed to a new Election, then there oftentimes happen such Clashings amongst them, in no∣minating Competitors, that thence also grows a second War; and now and then after all this pudder, to close up the Breaches, and reconcile all Interest with the Crown and Scepter, for the most part Force carrying all, and deciding by the Sword, they are forc'd to take and receive their former King again: Still the sternest and severest Princes sit fastest in the Throne, and Reign longest. But yet their Registers shew very few that many years have enjoy'd the Crown, and as few succeeding out of one Family. Japan was first Govern'd by a Dayro, or sole Mo∣narch.It is most certain that Japan in former times was Govern'd by a Dynastie of successive Princes; the last of which call'd Vo, or Dairo, Reigning long in Peace, and being observ'd to be of a mild and quiet Disposition, gave occasion to two of his Peers, or Ministers of State, they being of a rough and turbu∣lent Nature, to conspire, being indulgent to their own ambition, so to share and assume the Imperial Government to themselves; these from their emi∣nent Places were call'd Cubi: so watching, upon the first occasion,Cubi the chiefest Peers. and fit op∣portunity, they put this their Design in execution, raising a great Rebellion, and in a moment turn'd the Hinges, and dislocated the Ligaments of Govern∣ment, by which a happy and long Peace had been maintain'd, into Uprores, Tumults, and all the hatterings and harrases of Civil War; the success where∣of falling on the wrong side, the Emperor onely losing so much of his former
Authority: but soon after these Brethren in evil, usurped the absolute Com∣mand, Clashing amongst themselves, neither admitting of an Equal, in a se∣cond Civil War, one being destroy'd, the other Govern'd all. The Priviledges of the Dairo.Yet the Dairo retains to this day the Power to be the Fountain of Honor, all Titles and Degrees of Places and Dignity being deriv'd from him, from whom, all being his Substitutes, he receives Annual Tribute; a great part of which he expends in the Magnificence and Splendor of his Palace-Royal and Attendants. Who is the chief of the Japanners.He that stands foremost, at this time being the most eminent and powerful of the Japan Princes, is Texiba, the Great King of Meaco, and the Territories be∣longing thereto, commonly known by the Name Tasa, all which he keeps un∣der his Obedience by force of Arms. This Crown belong'd to King Nubananga, which Taxiba, with some of his Confederates, wrested from him, and in the hard pluck destroy'd him, his Wife, and whole Posterity. Thus much saith Johannes Petrus Maffeus of our Japan. Relation of Cosmus Tur∣rensis concerning Japan.¶ HEre we will also annex the Contents of Father Cosmus Turrensis, a Latine Letter, Dated from Firando Anno 1557, concerning the Customs and Character of the Inhabitants. The Japanners (saith he) are so capaciously apprehensive, and so tractable, not onely easily yielding to Reason, but Matters of Faith, that when they come to us, are very inquisitive and earnest to be resolv'd in some hard Questions of Religion, when we had first presented them the original and immortality of the Soul, they were soon brought to an un∣derstanding and belief thereof: And when we set forth to them, That none could be sav'd, nor Salvation granted by any, but the Father of all things, and Omnipotent Maker of Heaven and Earth; by which Arguments they were so suddenly convinced, and their former Reasons, which led them on in their blind Superstition, so totally routed, that without any farther scruple, or asking time to consider, they abominated their old Idolatry, and were converted to good Christians; which after receiv'd, they never waver'd not stagger'd from, most of them so resolv'd, that they become Champions for Jesus Christ, and were ready to lay down their Lives in maintaining the Truth of the Gospel. Neither are they obtuse, or ignorant in putting their Questions, but will smartly examine, and answer Logically, as if they were, Casuists, concerning deep Mysteries in Divinity; insomuch, that since Xaverius Landed here, which is now five Moneths, he hath been daily visited by the Bonzi and the Laiety, Conferring from Morning till Midnight, asking and disputing several Questions con∣cerning our Belief: First, What God is? What his Power? Where he dwells? Why not visible? How it is possible that the Soul hath a beginning, as we affirm, and no end? Furthermore, says he, as the Japanners account themselves most apprehensive, and also full of Fancy, so they believe they are in their serious Affairs not infe∣rior to any Nation of the World: upon which account they are so elevated in their own opi∣nion, that meeting any Stranger, they give him onely a scornful glance, and with their Hand a goby, as if too mean for their Conversation. They very well distinguish good and evil, which apperas by the Bonzi, who committing all sorts of debauchery in private, yet are so conscious of it, that these Hypocrites, Wolves in Sheeps Clothing, seem to be the onely Saints. Thus far Cosmus Turrensis. Now leaving Digression, we will go on with our Embassy we mention'd before, that Andreas Frisius, by an Order of the Batavian Council, if ought should happen amiss to Bloccovius, that he should supply his Place. But the chief of the Netherlander resident at Nangesaque found it convenient, upon de∣bate
map of Nagasaki De Logie voor NANGASACKI op t Eylandt Schisma The Lodge before NANGAQUE on the Iland Schisma
of several weighty Reasons, to joyn with Frisius in the Embassy of An∣thonius van Bronkhorst, Deputy-Governor in Derick Snoecks absence. To which purpose all Accommodations were preparing in the Store-houses of the East-India Company at Nangesaque. Description of the East-India Companies Store-house at Nangesaque.¶ IT will not be amiss in short to describe the chief Staple and Residence of the Netherlanders in Japan near Nangesaque. The Portaguese, when first they were allow'd to setle there, rais'd this Fort, or Building, out of the Wa∣ter: but after being driven out of Japan, and the Netherlanders commanded to remove from Firando, they were allow'd to supply the empty and deserted Lodge of the Portuguese. This Lodge, for by that Name it is known through all Japan, lies on a small Island, divided by a River of forty Foot wide from Nangesaque, which they cross, going over a Draw-Bridge; which by reason of Floods that happen, is an hundred and fifty Steps long. This Island, or Fortress, is defended each way round from the Water, with a strong wooden Pail: Within, in a convenient Place the Governor hath a stately and well-furnish'd Residence. Near the Gate of the Draw-Bridge stands their Sale-house, or Office, where they Vend their several Commodi∣ties. On the other side stands a pleasant Garden, beautifi'd with all sorts of Flowers. Two Streets cross-ways lead through the whole Work; on each side of which are convenient Store-houses, fitted for receiving and Packing thei Merchandise. Near an Inlet of the Sea is the second Gate, where there is a handsom pair of Stairs to carry down, or Land their Bales of Goods. The middle of the Lodge shews a plain and open Court, built round with Houses, whither the Merchants resort, bringing thither to Sell and Barter these follow∣ing, viz. White raw Silk, Pansjens, Peelinx, Gielems, Chions, Gasen, Sumongus, Flanels,Merchandise Vended at Nangesaque. colour'd Brokaeden, Sattins, China Fabitas, Damasks, Chiowerens, Hempen-Cloth, Sit-Clothes, Sowing-Silk, Silk-Pee, Namrack, Japan-Wood, black Sugar, Cambo∣dia-Nuts, Caiman-skins, red Leather, Aloes, Capox, Wax, white Sugar-Candy, Steel, Cotton, Sublemact, Cassia, Lignum, Spanish-Green, Porcelin-colour, Cam∣phire, Calemback, Musk, Chinesie-Wares, Deer-skins, Cow-Hides, Paper, Pep∣per, Elephants-Teeth, and Ager-Wood; all these are brought by the Chinesies to Nangesaque: Other Nations bring more variety. Concerning that Factory of the Netherlander Trade at Nangesaque, the Em∣peror sent these his Royal Mandates, Indorsed to the Governors of the City. Orders Written by the Japan Emperor concern∣ing the Trade of Nange∣saque.¶ KNow you People, that you shall not suffer any of our Japan Vessels to Freight them∣selves to any other Foreign Countrey; or if any such Offenders stealing away be taken by you, kill them, onely reserve the Commander, with the Ship and Goods, till our farther Order: And after this our Edict, whosoever of our Subjects return from abroad, punish them with Death. Make strict enquiry after all Priests that are spreaders of the Christian Faith: whosoever apprehends one of these Seducers, shall have an hundred Boats of Silver; and he that informs where he is, shall also be rewarded. If any Ships of ours coming in shall not obey these Orders, call to your help some of our Garrison at Omera. No Merchandise shall be engross'd to any one, but sold to many. None of our Nobles, or Soldiers, shall deal with any Strangers, but shall buy it at the second hand from the Japan Merchants. The Cargo, or Bill of Lading, shall be shew'd to our Officers before they break Bulk, or nuke Sale of any Parcel thereof. The Market Price shall be setled upon all sorts of raw Silk, and then Proclaim'd in five Cities, before the Vendition thereof: this being per∣form'd,
all other Merchandise are free to be sold at their pleasure. All Merchants, for whatsoever they Contract, shall tender Payment within twenty days. All Foreign Ships may depart by the twentieth day of the ninth Moneth. Those Ships which come in too late, shall lie fifty days ere they Land any Goods. All Merchants whatsoever shall repair from our five Imperial Cities to Nangesaque, on the fifth day of the seventh Moneth, if not, they are excluded their shares of the Silk-Market: and whatsoever Silk is carry'd to Firando, shall be sold at the same Rate as at Nangesaque. No Goods, as we said before, shall be brought to Market before the Price of Silk be asserted. This Edict was receiv'd Anno 1665, and Dated thus: In the twelfth Year of Quane, Emperor of Japan, to our Officers at Nangesaque, Sengok, Gammatane, Camy, and Sackibibare Andano Camy. This was Sign'd by five of his Privy-Counsellors, Congao Camy, Bongona Camy, Inhano Camy, Sannickino Camy, and Oyemo Camy. But now let us go on with our Embassy. The Netherland Ambas∣sadors go from Nangesaque to the Japan Emperor.¶ THe 25th of October 1649, their Excellencies Andreas Frisius, and Antho∣nius van Bronkhorst, set forth after Noon, attended with a Train of twenty Netherlanders, three Bonzies, three Interpreters, and thirty three Japanners, who being equally divided into three Vessels, took their leave of Nangesaque. This City, by the French and Portuguese call'd Nangesaqui, by the Italians, Nangasachi, stands on the Island Bungo, otherwise Cikoko. Without the Bay, about six Leagues from Nangesaque, in their Way to Jedo, lies a Fisher-Town call'd Duvos.Description of the Japan Fishers. Those that Fish here, and also in most Places of Japan, wear Boots but to the middle of their Leg, like Buskins; and have Wicker-Baskets in their Boats, whick keeps their taken Fish alive. They have several manners of Fishing, and use a kind of Casting-Net, with a long Line of Twigs at the same.Their manner of Fishing. They have also another way of Fish∣ing, and chiefly for Pilchards and Sitang, a Fish which always lies near the Ground; at the bottom of which Nets they lay their Baits. But before we
proceed any farther from Nangesaque, let us take a short view of the Situation thereof. Description of Nange∣saque.¶ THis City stands in thirty Degrees Northern-Latitude, near a con∣venient Harbor, fitter for the Reception of Merchant-Vessels, than any other Port or Haven in Japan: It is both great and populous, but without Walls or Fortifications, as most Cities in Japan are. Their Towns and Chur∣ches.The Steeples and Turrets, which appear very high above the ordinary Houses, give the Town a stately and delightful Prospect, especially towards the Sea, where they have an open view of the Streets, where are many magni∣ficent Buildings. The City is divided with several Streams, and joyn'd together with as ma∣ny Wooden Bridges. Every Street is parted by a Gate.The Streets are unpav'd, and therefore in rainy Weather very foul and cloggy; every Street hath a great Gate, which is shut every Night, and guarded with a Watch, so that growing late, there is neither Theft, Murder, nor any other Outrages committed. The Houses of Nange∣saque, how built.Their Houses are commonly uniform, but the Materials which they Build withall, differ according to the ability of the Builder. They use commonly Wood: but the poorer sort raise their meaner Habitations with Walls of Rice-Straw, Loam'd over with Clay, which closes so well, that it easily keeps out Rain and Wind; yet the richer sort Plaister their Partitions, raising the Foundation four Foot high from the Ground, with Planks cover'd over with thick Mats curiously sew'd together. They are but sleight built, four-square,Why they build them not high. and for the most part as broad as high; which to prevent the ruine by Earth∣quakes, that are frequent in that Countrey, they raise them no higher. Their Roofs are almost flat, but something sloaping; jetting out beyond the Wall four Foot, like a Pent-house; under which is an Entry, or Passage, that leads to their Gardens, which are adorn'd with artificial Rocks,Gardens. and still flourish∣ing Trees; which in a pleasant Prospect they view from their Dining-Rooms. The foremention'd Cantilivers defend those that walk the Streets both from the Sun and Rain, like our Pent-houses; these and the whole Roofs are of Planks clinch'd one over another, which carries off the Rain easily. On these stand Troughs and Tubs, fitted to receive the Water, to be ready against accidental Fires. They dwell all in the first, or lower Story, for the second and upper∣most is so low, as scarce fit to lay their Lumber in. The Towns and Cities are very subject to Fire.Their greatest and smallest Villages being being thus built all of Wood, suffer much, and sometimes unvaluable Losses by Fire; therefore the richer sort, and those that are able, build apart Stone Ware-houses, where they lay up those Goods and Commodities they most prize. Whatever Houses are burnt down, they immediately build up again in the same manner of Wood, which the Forrests plentifully supply. They seldom use Stone, because if over-thrown by Earthquake, they become a great heap of Rubbish, which they would not be troubled to remove. The Noble-mens Build∣ings are very stately.The Gentry, or better sort, have large and fairer Houses; where the Hus∣band and Wife have their several Apartments, in which they live asunder when they please; and also Rooms for his Employment, and for Address and Entertainment. Their Dining-Rooms are set forth with Cupboards of Plate, Cups and Dishes, that they shew glorious like a Goldsmith's Shop, and Gilded, giving a more various pleasure to the Eye, than our choicest European Pictures.
But the Walls of these Halls and Parlors,The Japan Structures, after what manner. in stead of Hangings, are cover'd with Paper Painted with Imagery, the Sheets being so curiously glew'd, that no Man can discern where they are conjoyn'd.Strange Shutters. Some of these Halls have artifi∣cial Shutters, which opening, show little Closets, and small Retirements; but these Doors, or Places to be open'd, are so neatly Wrought, that none can per∣ceive but it is a firm and perfect Wall: but over the half-Pace, or uppermost part of the Hall, stands a large Picture, done to the Life, under which a Pot al∣ways supply'd with sweet-smelling Flowers, gather'd fresh from their own Gardens.The chief Housholdstuff of the Japanners. Along the Walls to sit upon, in stead of Chairs and Stools, they have Chests curiously Varnish'd after their Indian manner, and Dishes which they esteem precious, standing upon them, to drink their beloved Chia in: Besides all this, they hang up upon their Walls their Scymiters, and other Arms, which they use in Battel. This is the best and richest Furniture which they have be∣longing to the Grandees, and Persons of most Quality: the poorer sort garnish their meaner Habitations,Japan Houses, how in the out-side. each according to their degree and ability. But the Frontice-pieces of their Houses are but plain and ordinary, yet they are uni∣form, and in a direct Line; their Streets being but narrow and short, of which they reckon up eighty eight;How many Streets there are in Nangesaque. reckoning as many Gates, being Lockt up every Night, and at each a strong Guard with Lights attending; where none may pass,None go through the Gates in the Night. unless he bring a Sign'd Warrant from the Governor, without which neither Doctor to his Patient, nor a Widwife to a Woman in Labor, though upon Life and Death, are admitted to go through: Nay more, if any of these Streets happen to be on Fire,In the time of Fire one Street may not help ano∣ther. they must not expect any help from others, but save themselves by their own care and diligence, for neither cries nor tears, nor loud complaints of those ready to be destroy'd and con∣sum'd to Ashes, prevail'd not in the least, nor move their Neighbors nor Go∣vernors to open and bring them assistance in this miserable condition, so that oft it happens, that the whole Ward, Men, Women, and Children, are burnt together in one Funeral Pyle. This sad Fate had like to have happen'd to some Hollanders, lodging in one of these Streets, twenty Houses all burning at once, and many People destroy'd in the Flames before their Eyes; who when they saw no hopes that the Gates would be open'd, and they must sud∣denly with the rest endure the fiery trial, brake by force through a back-side, having a Wooden Fence, so escaping that dreadful Conflagration. It often chances, that though their Locks and Keys keep out neighborly assistance, yet they keep not in the Fire, but that breaks through, and many times destroys not the next Ward onely, but the whole City, leaving it prostrate smoaking in its own Ruines; which suddenly, as we said before, they re-build in the same manner, the adjacent Forrest being ready to furnish them with several sorts of Wood and Timber, and the like Materials for that purpose. Gardens about Nange∣saque.This City also lies surrounded with large and pleasant Gardens, so delight∣ful, that the Eye seems never enough satisfi'd with viewing; where all manner of Fruit are much improv'd, growing very prosperously, especially the Chinesie Apple transplanted thither, and all sorts of Pears, where they have Walks sha∣ded with Cedar,Their Cedars. whose lofty Crowns seem to salute the Skie; the single Bodies of which make Columns for their Temples, and Main Masts for their Ships of the greatest Burthen, or Sovereigns of the Sea. Temples in Nangesaque.Their Temples also are of Wood, built commonly forty Foot square, with Spires and Steeples, curiously Carv'd and Gilt; of which they have many, and though no larger, yet pleasant and sumptuous with Imagery work: on each
corner of the Roof stands a Dragon erected, and within the Temple several Figures bigger than the Life, with terrible aspects, resembling Giants: to these, when entring the Temple, the Japanners use short Prayers, then put into an Offering-bason, being small Pieces of Copper-Coyn, by them call'd Casius. The Inhabitants of Nan∣gesaque, their Shape and Apparel.The Inhabitants are whiter than other Indians, but sallow to those of Europe; have strong and well-compacted Bodies, and are healthy of Constitution; their Noses are flat and Camosi'd; their Eyes little, especially the Womens. Both Sexes are almost Habited alike, wearing long Garments, but shorter than the Chinesies; the corners of which Coats they take up before with their Hands, carrying the right Lappet under their left Arms, and the left under the right, which thus they fasten with a Girdle; their Tunick thus ty'd up, the left corner affords them a Pocket in their Bosom, which keeps their Notes and Letters: on the left-side hangs down from their Girdle a long two-handed Scymiter. Sumptuous Apparel of the Japan Ladies.Their prime Ladies, and high-going Dames, wear stately gorgeous Dresses, their Hair is curiously sleeck'd, and neatly turn'd up; and their Gowns are much fuller, and more flowing in thick and looser Folds than meaner Women, the Stuff not onely rich and costly, but Embroider'd all over with Gold, with a large Silken Scarf about their Necks, which meets athwart over their Bosoms: a Needle-wrought Girdle, rich with Silver and Gold, doth compass and keep in their well-shap'd Bodies: on their left Hand a great Fan, with a long Handle, Painted with several Birds and Flowers, richly Gilt and Varnish'd: under their upper Garment, or Gown, which (as we said before) is so richly Embroider'd, they have seven or eight Silk Petticoats, every one a degree longer than the other, the longest trailing after them upon the Ground: But all these Clothes upon them are neither burthenous, nor trou∣blesom, though this be their daily Dress, yet they seldom come abroad, nor appear publick in their Houses; but in the Evenings, if fair Weather, they take the Air a little with their Husbands; by Day, in close Sedans, or else by Water in a Tilted Barge.
But ere we convey the Ambassadors further through Japan, it seems not amiss to take a short Survey, the better to give you a Description of this Large and Potent Empire. A short and brief Descri∣ption of Japan.¶ THis Spacious and Wealthy Isle, by the Natives call'd Nippon, and former∣ly by the Spaniards, Argantana; and in the Year of Christ Twelve hundred (according to that Famous Author Paulus Venetus) Chryse, and Zipangry, hath on the East-side California,Its bordering Countreys. and New-Granada; but at a vast distance, an Ocean of a thousand Leagues spreading betwixt. Westward, but far off, it looks upon the Isle of Corca, and Great China: Hugh Linschot reckons the nearest Promontories or Head-lands, stretching from China to Japan, to be eighty Leagues distance. The North opposes the Land of Jesso, and the Straights of Anian; and beyond all, the Coast of America. The South verges on the Philippines, Mindanao, Gilolo, and the Molucco Isles. And Latitude.It extends from thirty to forty Degrees Northern-Latitude; so that the longest day is fourteen Hours fifteen Minutes, and the shortest nine Hours forty five Minutes. Their highest Sun appears 15 Degrees at Noon short of the Ze∣nith. The Air differs not much from the Temperature of the Islands Sardinia, Rhodes, Cyprus, Candia, and Sicilia, and like that of the main Land of Portugal and Spain, and as moderate as Arabia, Syria, Persia, and China. Division of the same.¶ JApan is divided into five Provinces, Jamaystero, Jetsengo, Jetsesen, Quanto, and Ochio; besides the Isles Saykok, and Chiccock. Maffeus calls Saykok, Xi∣mum, making that seven Provinces; but Francis Cairon, being an Eye-Witness, deserves more to be credited: He affirms, That several Kings Govern there, and also in Chiccock, one King, and three Vice-Roys. That part of this Coun∣trey that is call'd corruptly Japan, boasts two Metropolitans, Miaco, and Jedo. Maffeus also tells us, That this hath fifty three Kingdoms; amongst which he names Miaco and Amangutium, saying, Miaco consists of twenty three, and Aman∣gutium of thirty Kingdoms; but of late all these petty Kingdoms are fallen into the Lap of one Sole Monarch or Emperor, who keeps his Magnificent Court at Jedo. But Japan also, besides Saykok and Chiccock, lies surrounded with several lesser Isles, as Hiu, Tacaxuma, Iquicuchi, Canga, Firando, Meacxima, Oeno, Cocyque, Beroe, Oqui, Murgan, Avans, Mettogamma, Meho, Mianisinu, Sando, being full of Silver Mines;Vulcans Isle. and Vulcania, often ejecting hideous Flames to the Sky, lying to the West, beyond the Straights of Diemon, which washes the Isles Chiccock and Tacaxuma. The Territory of Ochio.¶ OChio, the North-East Territory of Japan, borders on the vast Wildes of Jesso: For the Inlet or Bay which divides them, runs not up above forty Leagues, there ending, stopt by the Mountains of Ochio. Description of the great Countrey Jesso.¶ THe Extent of Jesso, being Mountainous, and abounding with costly Furs, is yet unknown, although the Emperors of Japan were much concern'd, taking great pains about the Discovery thereof, to that purpose im∣ploying several Persons at his own Cost and Charges, who made search over Rocks and Mountains, and almost inaccessible Places, explor'd vast and wild Countreys, very far; but found no end, though they diligently inquir'd of the People, who being Salvages, could give them no Account further than
where they dwelt. So after long Toyl and Trouble, they were forc'd to re∣turn without any Effect of their Design, as we said before. The Jesuit Lodowick Frojus, in his Letter of the eight and twentieth of Fe∣bruary, 1565. to the Indian Fathers, writes thus concerning the Inhabitants of Jesso: Against the Northermost Part of Japan, about three hundred Leagues from Me∣aco, is a very large Countrey, full of Salvage People,The Inhabitants of Jesso are horrible People. which are Cloth'd in Skins of Wild Beasts, Hairy all over their Bodies, having exceeding great Beards, and long Whiskers or Mustachioes, which they turn up with Sticks made for that purpose when they drink. They covet, and are very desirous of Wine; also Valiant in War, and therefore much fear'd by the Japanners. If by chance they receive any Hurts in an Encounter, their onely Appli∣cation is Salt Water, with which they bathe and wash the Wound, so drying it up. On their Bosoms they wear Looking-Glasses, which serve them as Shields or Breast-plates. Their Swords they tye about their Heads, in such a manner, that the Hilt thereof hangs on their Shoulders. They onely Worship the Moon. Aquita, a great City, stands in the Territory of Genuaen, bordering Jesso: Hither the Natives come in great Numbers to Trade; and also the Aquitans Travel to them, but not in such Multitudes, because they are oftentimes cut off, and murder'd by the Inhabitants. Error of the Geographers concerning Japan.¶ THe Maps of the World, our Terrestrial Globe, have till of late plac'd nothing beyond Aquita but the Ocean; though long since confuted by Hugh Linschot, proving upon the testimony of the Jesuit Frojus, who deserves to be more credited (as having resided a long time in Japan) than some of our Geographers, who set down by hear-say the Largeness and Ex∣tent of Japan, without any Proofs or Testimony; whereas it is made mani∣fest, That Japan extends it self much further than commonly drawn: More∣over, Francis Cairon, Ambassador to the Emperor of Japan at Jedo, witnesses, That the Largeness of this Countrey is not known to the Inhabitants them∣selves. Mistake of Maffeus and Cluverius.Therefore Maffeus is much mistaken, when he sets down the length of Japan to be two hundred Leagues, and its greatest breadth but thirty. And Cluverius in his Geography reckons the length to be an hundred and fifty Leagues, and the breadth seventy. Hazarts ignorance con∣cerning the Description of Japan.But none more errs in this, than the Jesuit Cornelius Hazart, in his History of the Island of Japan; which that we may the better answer, hear his own Words. Japonien, or (as others call it) Japan, by the Inhabitants, Nippon, is a Territory lying in the farthest Point of the East, being the outmost Borders of Asia; (which to prove, he quotes Isaiah, cap. 18. ver. 2.) For although to the West, to the Frontiers of China,Vide Isaiah.is no more than fifty Leagues, (says he) and to the City Amacoa, two hundred ninety se∣ven; and on the South having so vast an Ocean, no known Countrey being beyond, Japan may certainly be call'd The Worlds End: And standing divided into so many small Islands, that a Geographer of our times calls it also A World of Isles; the chiefest of which are, Niphon, Ximus, and Xicocus, consisting of sixty six several Kingdoms. The Isle of Niphon reckons fifty three, boasting also many stately Cities, of which the Metropolis is Meaco. The Island Ximus hath nine, and several handsom Towns, amongst which, Usuquin, Funai, and Cangoxima. The Isle Xicocus accounts no more than four Kingdoms: Which being taken together, Japonien is as big as all Italy. Though this his Style be ridiculous, yet his Ignorance, and so strangely false Description, is so much more, that he ought rather to be pittied and laugh'd at, as one distracted, than to be answer'd; but that we are bound in Consci∣ence
to undeceive his believing Readers.Hazart's false Descripti∣on Japan contradicted. First, he plants Japan on the West side of China. This is such a blind, nay such a stupid Mistake, that the like was never heard of: For, was there ever any Writer or Geographer, that settled Japan West from China? All agreeing, neither can it be otherwise, being an Isle, but East from China; that Empire being not onely the utmost Borders of Asia Eastward, but of Europe also; being one continu'd Main Continent, Westward to Gads Pillars, and the Atlantick Ocean. Next, admit it were, as he affirms, That Japan lay West from China; yet out of what Chinese Haven did ever any Vessel reach any Port in Japan, measuring but sixty Leagues? Where∣as it is notoriously known, That the Distance betwixt these Empires is much greater: And who can shew me in any Map or Journal of his Travels, a City call'd Amiaco, lying at such a distance from Japan, as he gives, without any proof or testimony? Next (which is very strange) he says, That Japan looks on no Countrey Southward, but the Main Ocean; or else, Lands so far off, that they are utterly unknown. What then will become of all these Coun∣treys; as, Tanaxima, Lequeio Granda, Formosa, de Philippines, Mindore, Mindanao, Borneo, Celebes, Molucco, and other Realms; besides many other Countreys which are cut off by the Ocean, and lye far and near distant from thence, and daily frequented and Navigated by Strangers, insomuch that all Geographers men∣tion the same? Which belongs more especially to you, who have publish'd in∣stead of grave Experience, your no want of Ignorance, and utter Deficiency in that Science: For what can be more absurd, than this your Description of the Principal Islands, Niphon, Ximus, and Xicocus, dividing of them into sixty six Kingdoms, and setling them all so handsomly, with a perfect Mistake, on the wrong side; not consulting Francisco Cairon, who being himself upon the Spot, took an exact Survey of Japan, which your Church-History makes truly manifest in several Pages. Japan is much bigger the Italy.Lastly, Of all Comparisons, this seems the most odious, That Japan, with all it circumjacent Isles, is no larger than Italy: For the same Cairon (whom concerning other Matters you have for the most part copy'd out, and trick'd up this your Japan-History with) tells us in the beginning of his Description thereof, That beyond Quanto, a Territory lying up high in Japan, (from whence the Emperor raises his chiefest Revenue, and keeps his Court in Jedo) it is twenty seven days Journey before you come to the Province of Sunguar, lying in the most Northerly part of Japan. At this rate, how can Italy be compar'd to Japan? Sure Father Hazart you neither know the one, nor the other: For let any one take the Extent of Italy,The Largeness of Italy. which they reckon from the Alps, and the City Aosta, passing through Rome and Capua, to Rhegio, and the Promontory de Army, he shall never make more than two hundred twenty five Leagues: And though the breadth along the Alpine Mountains reacheth a hundred and forty Leagues, yet taken generally, it proves much less; for betwixt Ancona and the Tyber gives the rate of the common breadth, which is no more than thirty four Leagues. How apt then seems this Comparison, when several Writers, Eye∣witnesses, tell you, That Miaco, lying almost in the middle of Japan, is three hundred Leagues distant from Jesso, bordering the said Isle. ¶ NOw to what concerns the Extract or Original of the Japanners, the general Opinion thereof we have already related, which was, That they (not unlike the Batavians, who by a Civil War were drove from Hessen, to the Island between the Rhine and Wael) Rebelling against their Emperor in
China, were Banish'd to the desolate Isles of Japan:The Extract of the Ja∣panners from China. Some are of opinion, that the Tartars have interment themselves with the Chine∣ses. From whence this opini∣on proceeds. But Father Martinius contradicts this Opinion in his Chinese Atlas, saying, That the Japanners are not onely Extracted from the Chineses, but also from the Tartars; because they still retain some of both their Customs: For they follow the Chinese Religion, as also the same Apparel which at this day is worn in the Chinese Territory call'd Honan. It is no wonder that this Territory could produce People enough to Plant Japan; for it contains above eight great Cities, and at least a hundred Populous Villages. Moreover, the Chinese Book of their Annual Accounts, reckons, that this Province can bring five Millions seven thousand two hun∣dred and seventy Men into the Field. But although the Japanners do so much resemble the Chineses in several of their Customs, yet they also imitate the Tar∣tars in many of their Fashions; for they not only shave their Heads after their manner, leaving but little Hair; but they use also the Letters D and R, which the Chinese Speech doth not acknowledge. Martinius opinion con∣cerning the Extract of the Japanners.Martinius moreover relates, That the Chinese Memorials make mention of Xio an Emperor, who was deluded by a peculiar Person, telling him, That Japan produc'd an Herb, which if the Emperor could get, would make him Immortal; for which he, to be assur'd thereof, sent several thither, which ne∣ver returning, by degrees Planted our Japan. A Catalogue of the great Persons and inestimable Re∣venues of Japan.¶ LAstly, Concerning the Revenues that belong to this vast Empire, it doth manifestly appear by the Sign'd Account of the In-comes of the Japan Princes and Kings, taken by Francis Cairon. The Revenues are reckon'd, according to the Japan manner, by Cockiens, of which every one makes a French Crown. The nearest to the Emperor, which had the greatest Revenue in the time of Francis Cairon's Residence there, was the King of Canga, Getchiu, and Natta, call'd Cangona Tsiunangou, living in the Castle of Langa:Every Tun of Gold is 10000 l. His Yearly Revenue came seldom to less than a hundred and twenty Tun of Gold. Surnango Daynongon, King of the Territory of Surnga, Toto, and Micauwa, inha∣biting the Fort Faytsiu; and Onwarino Daynaugou, King of the Countreys of Owary and Mino, Resident in the Fortress Mangay, have each seventy thousand Pounds per Annum. Sendayno Thiunangon, King of Massanine and Ochio, dwelling in the invincible Castle Senday, hath Yearly above sixty four Tun of Gold.640000 l. Satsumanon Thiunangon, King of Satsuma, Ossina, Fiungo, and Luchio, in the For∣tress of Cangasima, treasures Yearly sixty thousand Pound Sterling. Kinocouny Dayanangon, King of the Countreys of Kino and Iche, commanding the Strong Hold of Wake Jamma, hath Five hundred and fifty thousand Pound Ster∣ling Yearly. Near upon the like Sums have the Kings of Catto Fingonocamy of Fin∣go in the Fortress Koumamotte, and Matsendeyro Jemnosco of Sunkicen in the Castle Foucasa, and Matsendeyro Inocamy of Jetchesen, keeping the Fortress of Oecde. These petty Kings Catto Cibo of Osio, Commanding the Fort Ais; and Assai∣no Taysima of Bingo in the Burrough of Oky, have each forty thousand Pound Sterling Yearly. The Kings Matsendeyro Nangato of Sova, living in the Castle of Fangy; and Mittons Thiunango of Fitayts, in the Fort Mit; and Nabissima Sinano of Fisien, com∣manding the Castle Logioys; and Matsendeyro Sindairo of Inabafoky, in the For∣tress Tackaham, receive Annually Three hundred and ten thousand Pound Ster∣ling.
Near upon the like Revenue hath Todo Ishumi King of Ingu Iche, his Royal Fort or Palace being call'd Sou; and Matsendeyro Lonuey of Bisen, commanding the Castle Ossajamma; and Inno Caimon of Totomy, inhabiting the Strong-Hold Sawajamma; and Tosso Cauwa Jetchin King of Boyses, in his Royal Seat Cokera; and Ojesungu Dainsio, King of the great Territory of Jatsengo, Governing and Re∣siding in the Fortress Gunysauwa; and Matseddeyro Denico; and also the Lady Jetsengo, Queen of Formando, and there Residing. Revenues of the Japan Dukes.Next, The Secondary Princes, or Dukes, as we may stile them, are Mansen∣deyro Auwa, Commander of the Countrey Auwa, dwelling in Incts; and Matsen∣deyro Jutchigonocamy Duke of Conge, the Seat of his Government being Tacato; and Matsendeyro Tsiusio, Prince or Duke of Joo, Residing in his well-fortified Citadel Mats Jamma: Each of these supplies his Exchequer with Fifty three Tun of Gold Yearly. Arjama Grimba Duke of Tsickingo, Commanding the Castle Courme, falls short of their Revenues ten Tun of Gold. Revenues of the Japan Earls.Their Third Degree of Princes, which we may call Earls, are to be distin∣guish'd by their Name thus: Morino Imasack Earl of Imasacka, his principal Fort being Tsiamma; next Tory Inganocam Governor of Sewano, dwelling in Jamman∣gatta; then Matsendeyro Tosa Prince of Tosnacory, Residing in his Strong-Hold Tocosiamma; and Satake Okiou Governor of Wano, keeping his Court in the For∣tress Akita; as also Matsendeyro Simosaucamy Lord of Simosa, dwelling in the Castle Tattebays, have each of them Yearly twenty Tun of Gold. But these two Lords (such as we may term Barons) Foriwo Jamaissiro, and Ikouno Jokono∣camy, one Governing Inomo, and the other Sanike, are well pleas'd with each sharing yearly Eighteen thousand pound Sterling. But these, though of lesser Dignity, as Fonda Kaynokamy of Faryma, and Sackay Counay, Ruling in the great Territory Wano, receive each of them Annually Fif∣teen Tun of Gold. Their Knights Revenues.Those which at our Rates we may look upon as no more than Knights, are Tarasauwa Simedo commanding Fisen, Kiongock Wakasa Ruler of Wakasa, Forii Tango in the Countrey Jetchesen, Menfio Fiongo in Bingo, and Sackosbarra Eskibou Gover∣nor of Kooske, receive every one yearly Twelve Tun of Gold. Mansendeyro Tawayts Commander of the Imperial Fort Quana; and Oecken∣deyro Imasacka Ruler of Simotske, inhabiting in the Fort Oetsnomico; and Sanada Ins Governor of Sinano, residing in the Castle Koske; and Taytfibanna Finda in the Countrey Sickingo, dwelling in the Strong-Hold Imangouwa, being all Knights: Every one of these boasts no less Means than Ten thousand Pound a Year. And also the Knights Ongasaura Ouckon of Firima, Indatiu Vontomiu of Gio and Nambou, Sinano of the great Territory Ochio, and Niwa Groseymon likewise of Ochio, receive a thousand Pound less than the former. Abeno Bitchiou, Governor of the Imperial Castle Watsuky in the mighty Coun∣trey Mousayes, hath for his Yearly Revenue Eighty thousand Pound Sterling. The Knights Kiongock Oenieme of Tanga, dwelling in the Fort Tanabe; and Makino Surnga in the far-spreading Countrey Jethingo; Nackangauwa Nisien in Bongo, Matsendeyro Camba in Sinano, Nayto Samma in Fitayts: These have yearly Seventy thousand Pound.

The Habit of the Japan Lords.¶ THe Habits of these Lords are very Rich: They wear short Coats, with wide Sleeves, curiously stitch'd with Silver and Gold. Un∣der their upper Garment they wear a Silk Wastcoat, ty'd close about them with a Girdle, in which they put their Scymiters. Their Breeches are so exceeding wide and long, that they tread upon them as they go; for they hang down over their Heels. Upon the bottom of their Wastcoats, a little above the Waste-band of their Breeches, they have Pourtray'd their Coat of Arms. Revenues of their mean∣er Lords.Moreover, these following Lords, Inawa Aways of Tamba, Camy Dyrik of Iwa∣my, Cattayngiri Ismou of Jamatta, Chonda Findanocamy of Jetsesen, have yearly forty thousand Pound Sterling a Man: And Itacoura Sovodonne, Governor for the Em∣peror of the mighty City Meaco, receives above the foremention'd Forty thou∣sand

them. Instead of Powder-Horns, or Cartrage Boxes, they use small square Baskets, made very artificially of Flags or Rushes. In their Girdles they stick one short and one long Scimiter. The Netherland Ambassa∣dors go by water from Nan∣gesaque to Osacca.¶ BUt to return again to our Embassadors, Andreus Frisius, and Anthonius Brookhorst, which Sail'd from Nangesaque, the 25 of Septemb. 1649. with three great Barks Laden with rich Presents for the Japan Emperor; twenty Ne∣therlander, three Bongies, as guides to direct them in their Journey from Osacca to Jedo, three Interpreters, and thirty four Japanners, besides the beforementi∣on'd Ambassadors. In short time, they got beyond Foveunda, Zotta, and Nanatjamma, and Sail'd Northwardly between Firando, Omodackey, and Oysinocuby, Towns scituate on Bungo; then they reach'd the Islands Auwo, Fimissima, and Ginkai, and left Nan∣gago, on the left side of the Coast of Bungo. Then they brought the Island Aymissima under their Lee, and descry'd the City Assia,The City Asia. twelve Miles North-East from Aymissima. This City stands on a white Sandy shore, and is seen a great distance off at Sea, by reason of its high Mountains, which seem to touch the Clouds. After this they discover'd the famous Town Icaminangano-misacco, and the Ci∣ty Cocero, lying in an Inlet of the Sea. The City CoceroCocero at its first view is very delightful to behold, having two Suburbs, one above the City, and another below towards the Sea. Here they directed their Course Easterly into the Straits, which in the North washes Japan, and on the South Chiekok, and Tousa. On the left side of Japan stands the City Simonisicci,The City Simonysicci. within which is a small Fort, and opposite to that a strong Castle, built on a high Hill, near which is the Haven Isacka, to which belongs two Villages containing forty houses a piece. ¶ VVIthin the foremention'd Straits they met with many Islands,Islands. several of their names unknown, yet at the hither end lies Mettogamma, and next Mocko,The City Camenosacci. Mianosimi, and Camero; betwixt which, the City Cammenosacci stands on the more of Japan. In a long Tract from East to West, they saw near the Coast of Japan, the Islands Icowe, Szuwa, Caroto, Cominagari, and Jocosmi, all improv'd with Vil∣lages. Opposite to Caroto, are seen in the middle of this Channel, between Japan and Tonsa, several high Mountains, whose tops are crown'd with various Trees; here they stood due East, and had on their Larboard in the Japan Coast, the Towns Tantonomis, Mewarri, Bignatum, and Binga; On their Starboard, the In∣habited Isle Syrais: So Sailing on between Simeia and Samnic, Ousimate and Wota, Icsima and Muro, they met with so strong a Current, that their Rowers had great labor to bring them thorow. The City Muro.¶ MUro, a Town scituate on Japan, hath a very fine Haven; five Miles be∣yond which rises Firmensi,The City Firmensi. a stately City, Fortifi'd with a strong Ca∣stle; near which the Sea is often times very rough, which they left on their Larboard, and also Ahos, Takasima, and Swoja, and came to Fiongo. But when they met with Calms and wanted Wind, their Men with a Line hall'd their Barks along the shore.
Netherland Ambassadors come to Ojacc.Sailing from hence, they kept along the Coast of Amanasacci, and came on the thirteenth of January, after nineteen days travel to Osacca, and getting up the River, they came to Anchor before Anissima, the Suburb of Osacca. Soon af∣ter, three Pleasure-Boats came thither, for to carry the Ambassadors with their Goods and Retinue. Fayfena, a Japan Plea∣sure-Boat.¶THe Japanners build a kind of Pleasure-Boats or Barges, by them call'd Fayfena, which commonly have forty Oars, built before like an Ele∣phants Head, and in the Starn a fine Looking-Glass, Cabbin and Helm, after the Portuguese manner: Some of these Fayfena's have above thirty Rowers in them, which Row with such speed, and make so fresh way, that it is to be admir'd; for commonly they make a Voyage from Osacca to Nangesaque in twelve days time, lying two hundred and twenty Leagues distant from one another. Art exact description of the situation of the Cities be∣tween Nangesaque and O∣sacca.¶ FRom Nangesaque, to Fouconda, is two Leagues; from Fouconda to Zitta, eight; thence to Nanatzjamma, three; from thence to Omodakey, two; then to Oysinocubi, five; so to Firando, eight; from Firando to Auwo, six; then to Jobeco, seven; thence to Fimissima, seven; from Fimissima to Ginha, seven; so to Amissima, seven; thence to Jammangan-misacci, fourteen; from hence to Simo∣nisicci, seven; thence to Motogama, seven; so to Mocko, eleven; from Mocko to Mianosimi, eight; from hence to Cammenosacci, ten; then to Camro, seven; so to Jowe, three; from Jowe to Szuwa, two; thence to Caroto, three; from Caroto to Cammagari, five; from hence to Tantonomi, ten; so to Jourissiro, five; thence to Bignatum, five; from hence to Syzais, three; from Syzais to Fubi, ten; then to Oussimato, seven; so farther to Wota, four; from Wota to Muro, six; then to Akas, thirteen; so to Fiungo, five; and from Fiungo to the River of Osacca, is thirteen Leagues.
Frisius and Brookhorst are fetch d into Osacca.¶ UPon the first Rumors of the Ambassadors, Frisius and Brookhorst's arri∣val at Osacca, both Men and Women, throng'd in great multitudes to meet these strangers; but the greatest croud was on the Bridge, on which they flock'd, that from thence they might satisfie their Curiosity in viewing the Netherlanders; several of these Bridges were scarce sufficient to bear the burthen of such great multitudes, and often cracking so exceedingly, that they not onely threaten'd great danger to those which stood on them, but also those that Row'd under them. The Inhabitants had almost forgot that ever they had seen a people which dwelt in another part of the world, and come above three thousand Miles in a stately Embassy to their Emperor, which made the chief Citizens and Bur∣gesses of Osacco themselves to venture their lives on the foremention'd Woodden Bridges to see these strangers. Jacob Spex, and Peter Sea, on when they came to Osacca.¶ ANno 1611. The Ambassador Jacob Spex and Peter Segerszoon pass'd through Osacco with Presents to the Emperor Goyssio Samma, who at that time kept his Court in the City Soringou, to the end, they might obtain liberty for to Trade there. Their journey from Fi∣rando thither.These Ambassadors went on the 16 of June, Anno 1611. from Firando with one Bark; So Sailing by the Island Aymissima, and the City Assia, and Row'd along the Banks of Cocero, and in the Evening dropt Anchor in sight of the City Ximont∣chequi; but the Wind rising and blowing in great gusts, forc'd them to Weigh, and Row back to the Haven Isacky: Where arriving, the Wind soon after ceas'd, and they the second time Weigh'd, and Steer'd their Course to Ximont∣chequi; towards the Evening they came to Myands: So leaving Cadmenexequi on the Larboard, about midnight, they drew near Szuwa, under which Isle they came to an Anchor: From Szuwa they proceeded forward, having the Stream with them; but the Wind being against them, they got but sixty Miles in three days time, which was not without great pains and toil of the Rowers; who at last being quite tyr'd out, the Lord Spex was forc'd to put in for Vosimado, where he hired four Japan Vessels, which, by turns were to ease the weary'd Row∣ers: But they had the Wind still Easterly, and blowing often very fresh, so that with great difficulty they at last reach'd the Haven Muro, where the Sea went so high, that two of their Vessels sunk before the Harbor; but the Wea∣ther growing calmer, they betook themselves again to their Oars, to Row thorow the hollow Waves; but the Tide setting them so hard, they were forc'd to come to an Anchor at Firmensi; From hence Weighing, they pass'd Tackessima to Fiungo, and from thence to Osacca; a great part of their way, the Sea-men were forc'd to hale their Bark along the shore, which put them to great pains. On the sixth of August, the Ambassador Spex came to the River of Osacca, and Anchor'd before the City Aussima, where he hired several small Vessels, to carry him to Fussiny, because his Vessel drew too much Water for to carry him over the Shoals. In the afternoon he went through Osacca, and towards Evening Row'd up the Stream, which in many places was so shallow, that they were forc'd to put forward their Vessels with great trouble. Fidery Samma looseth his Crown.At that time there resided in Osacca a Person of Royal Extract, call'd Fidery Samma, a young Prince eighteen years old, who was strangly bereav'd of the Diadem of that Kingdom, and by reason of his great Revenue, and the gene∣ral
view of Osaka The Citty OSACCO De Stt OSACCO
affection of Nobles and Commons, stood also fair for the whole Empire; but having lost all, he retir'd thither as a private person. The journey of Francis Caron, and Henrick Hagena∣er from Firandona to Osacca.¶ SInce that time, besides several others, Francis Caron, and Henrick Hagenaer went Anno 1634. the 13 of October in an Embassy to the Emperor of Ja∣pan, who Sailing from Firando, harbour'd that night in the Bay of Tascha; the next day Sailing on till the Evening, they were forc'd by a violent showre of Rain to Anchor against the Village Jobokki; next morning proceeding in their Voyage, they pass'd the City Fagatta, and the Island Anesma, and at last came to an Anchor at Chimano Suky, where they were presented with some fresh Pro∣visions, by the Agent of the East-India Company residing there. After a short refreshment, the Ambassador Caron Weighing Anchor, with a fresh Gale from the North West, about Midnight enter'd the Straits of Camono∣siky, whose Banks on both sides are continu'd Streets, being full of Houses: here they were forc'd to produce their Pasports, which done, they left this place, and after some time met with such a hollow Sea between several scatter'd Isles, that they were necessitated to get into a small Harbor of a Fish Town. But the Weather growing calmer, they Row'd to Cammangasie, and from thence to Memarry, a handsom City, crown'd with many Spires.The City Mewarry. On the utmost Point to the Sea-ward stands a very fair Temple, whose Steeple being seen at a great di∣stance at Sea, serves for a Beacon or Light-House. Here they left the City Bignatum on their Larboard, and ran East North East by the City Oussimato, and came in the Evening to Muro, where the Bonjoyes of Nangesaque commanded the Netherlanders Interpreter to inform them, who those were that were travelling to the Emperor. Out of this Harbor, Ambassador Caron set Sail with a Train, besides his own, of above a hundred Japanners, and soon after reach'd the City Akas, where they encounter'd with a loud Storm out of the North East, furrowing up a very hol∣low Sea. The City Akas.¶ AKas, a well fortifi'd City, stands fortifi'd at one side with a Castle of De∣fence, surrounded with Stone Walls, rais'd out of the Water; from hence they set forward, and pass'd by Fiungo, and after Noon they spy'd the City Osacca and Saccaio; about Sun-set they got over the Flats, and enter'd the Bay of Osacca; where going a shore, they were receiv'd by, and lodg'd in the house of Grabbidons, President there for the East-India Company. These were the two onely Embassies that pass'd through Osacca before the Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst, who after their arrival ashore in the after∣noon, were conducted to a fair Lodging,Frisius and Brookhurst bo∣dyed in a Noble mans house in Osacca. with all conveniencies in a stately House, in which the Commanders and Governors of Nangesaque in their tra∣velling backward and forward to their Emperor, use to take up their Lodgings. The Fabrick it self was formerly the Habitation of a Japan Priest, but since al∣ter'd into a house of Entertainment for Ambassadors and Envoys. The description of the mighty City Osacca.¶ AS to what concerns Osacca, it is an Imperial City, and the Metropolis of the Territory of Quioo. Near the mouth of the River, an obstruct∣ing Rock divides the Channel, making it troublesom and dangerous for those that pass the River, runs up Northerly, branching through the middle of Osac∣ca, and also through Meaco, making many Sands and Shoals, and at last looseth it self in a spreading Lake beyond that City.
On the utmost Point or Promontory of the River stands the King's Custom-House, where all Ships must touch that pass by the same, there paying such Customs as belongs to their Cargo with which they are Freighted: this House rais'd each Story with a several Roof, shews very stately, and is to be seen far into the Sea. Mountains near Osacca.On each side appear two rising Hills, which hinder the Prospect of the East and West side of the City; onely some of the high Spires appear above. The Water-Castle of Osac∣ca.Opposite to the Custom-house stands the Kings Block-house, surrounded with a strong Wall rais'd out of the River, ready and fully replenish'd for all Occasions with well-mounted Cannon. The Emperor Xogunsama began to build this Fort; but his Son Toxogunsama, succeeding him in his Imperial Throne, Anno 1629. finish'd and Garison'd it in the space of three Years. Store-houses against Fire.Behind the same are built ten Store-houses, opposite to the Sea, with a broad Street, and a Stone Cause-way. These Ware-houses are exceeding large, and built all of Stone, that they may not suffer Damage by Fire. Imperial Turrets.There are also several Towers, in which the Emperor keeps his Treasure, collected from the Isles Chiccock, Saycock, and Tonsa. Besides these foremention'd Buildings,Water-Gate. is also seen the Water-Gate, through which the Custom'd Goods go in and out, having a great and broad pair of Stairs, which descend to the Sea, and a Guard of five hundred Soldiers con∣stantly attending the same. Somewhat further is the Emperors Ship-yard, which is of a great Circum∣ference, having many Docks in the same, wherein continually all manner of Vessels are a building, whose Hulls they make generally very broad. The other part of the City stands behind the Hills; but is divided from them by a Rivulet.The Governors House. A little way up the River from the Sea, is the Governors House, curiously built, and within full of costly Rooms, and rises aloft, in manner of a Steeple, with four Roofs. The Temple of Devils.Between this Edifice and the Block-house appears the lofty Roof of the
Temple of Infernals, within which the Japanners worship a horrible Image:Their Idols very horrible. His Head represents that of a Wild Boar, with two great Tusks sticking out of his Jaws; and adorn'd with a stately Crown, full of Diamonds, and other Precious Stones. Over his Breast hangs a Scarf, which is parted in the middle: and that which makes it the more terrible to behold, are four out∣spread Arms, of which one of the left stands upwards, holding a Ring on the longest Finger; the other hanging downwards, holds a Flower not unlike a Lilly. The uppermost Right Hand gripes fast a small Dragons Head, spit∣ting Fire; the lowermost, a Golden Scepter: trampling with his Feet upon the Belly and Thigh of another Devil, which lies along under him: He ha∣ving his Head all hairy, and a pair of Ox Horns graffed thereon, with an Iron Chain about his Neck, a Girdle with great Buttons about his Middle, a long Tail between his Leggs, and broad Garters about his Knees; the Right Arm stretch'd out, and the left bended in to his Side, is as dreadful a Spectacle as the other. These horrid Shapes they nominate Joosie Tiedebak;How they call them. and God they call, contrarily, Joosie Goesar. The Japanners honor and worship these resem∣blances of Devils with all manner of Offerings, to the end they might not receive any hurt from them. The Image of their Devil Vitziputzli.The same Opinion have the Western Indians of their Devil Vitziliputzli, whom they Worship and Reverence with great Zeal. This Vitziliputzli sits on a Silver Foot-stool, which stands upon a Bier, whose four ends have as many Props, with Serpents or Adders Heads fix'd on them. The Forehead of this Idol is painted blue, with two Streaks of the same Colour athwart his Nose, running to each Ear. His Head like a long-Bill'd Bird, is impalled with stately Plume of Feathers, the tip of the Bill of massie Gold. In his Left Hand he holds a white round Box, and five white Plumes, pleited cross-ways over one another; in the middle a Branch, which signifies Victory. On his Side hang four Arrows, which (according to the Opinion of the Mexicans) were sent him from Heaven: His Right Hand rests on a Staff, in manner of a Ser∣pent, painted with blue Streaks: Upon his Bosom appears the Face of a Man, with glaring Eyes, a high Nose, and a wide Mouth, opening before or near the Orifice of his Stomach. Thus stood he, for the most part vail'd with a Curtain; his Body almost cover'd with Chains of Pearls, Diamonds, and other Precious Stones, which hung round with various colour'd Plumes, like Labels. The Devil Tezcatlipuca.They no less fear their Demon Tezcatlipuca, made of black Jet, and cloath'd in a rich Habit: In his mouth he holds a Silver Spike, about a Finger long, in which sometimes stick Green, other times Red Plumes of Feathers; which distinguish'd Colours they wear as Favors at their several Festivals. Between both his Ears hang many Gems of great Value; and about his Neck an Em∣rauld, that covers most part of his Breast; also wearing Golden Armlets: On his Navil a costly Topaz; his Left-hand bearing a Fan of Gold, being a Plate so curiously pollish'd, that it well perform'd the Office of a Mirror or Look∣ing-glass, by the Mexicans call'd Itlachcaia, wherein they believe Tezcatlipuca sees all the Transactions of the World, by which he Judges, Determines, and Pu∣nishes or Prefers every one according to their well or ill doing: Therefore he stands ready with four Darts, to distribute upon those which commit the high∣est Offences.
The Tempell of the Idoll Canon TEMPEL VAN DEN AFGODT KANON. The Watch-house in O∣sacca is very stately.¶ BUt return again to the Description of the Imperial City Osacca: Be∣hind the Diabollical Temple, spreading it self along the Shore, stands a Watch-Tower, a more than Royal Building, rais'd extraordinary high, in the great Street which leads to the City Saccai. At some distance from this, next you may behold a large and stately Tem∣ple, in which is a wonderful Idol, being fifty Foot high: Its Head all of Sil∣ver, presented by the King of Bom, whose Countrey abounds with Mines of that Metal. Imperial Banquetting-house.On the Left-hand, at the lower end of the City, opens from behind the Hill, a fair Prospect of the Imperial Tower, crown'd with an almost unmea∣surable Spire; beyond which, about a League Southward from Osacca, may be seen another Tower, call'd Lords-Castle, where the Noble-men use to meet, both for their Serious Occasions and Divertisements. The Temple of the Idol Canon.But in the Center or middle of the City stands the much celebrated Tem∣ple of the Idol Canon, whom the Japanners believe hath the absolute Power over all sorts of Fish and Fowl that haunt the Water, he being as their Neptune, or Sea-commanding God: A few Steps from which stands the Porters Lodge, with a broad-brimm'd Roof, whose Edges shoot far out before the Walls: Near this lies a Path leading to the Out-wall, which now lies for the most part in its own Ruins; yet this Wall hath one very fair Gate, resembling a Triumphal Arch, through which they walk to a pleasant Plain, full of shady Trees: but this Pleasure is divided from them by a second Quadrangular Wall, Plaister'd with white Loam, every Quarter a pleasant Green belonging to it. Strange Porch before Canons Temple.But the Temple-Porch belonging to the first Wall, that incloses the Court, is built Orbicular, with six Angles, making a kind of Cupiloe on the top. To this sad Place many wretched People resort, who, weary of their Lives, ei∣ther suffering under Poverty, or Chronical Infirmities, or distracted with
blind Zeal, in Fits of their Religious Melancholy,Japanners drown them∣selves. here expecting to be freed from all their Sorrows, and to enter into present Happiness, by drowning themselves in this their Soul-saving Pool of their Water-God: But first they warily consult Canon himself in the Portal, seeking his Advice; from which, as their fond Fancies dictate, they either return full of Hopes, or desperately throw themselves headlong in, and for a quicker dispatch, greedily swallow the Water. As did also the ancient Germans, to the Honor of the Goddess Hertha.This kind of dreadful Sedecede, or destroying themselves, is not unlike the ancient Worship of the Teutonick Goddess Hertha, which Tacitus relates thus: That in an Isle lying not far out at Sea, a Priest waited in a Grove consecrated to the God∣dess Hertha, in which stood a close Chariot, which was profan'd if touch'd by any but this her Attendant: His Function was to know at what time the Goddess set forth upon her Holy Voyage, to visit the Seats of Joy and Everlasting Happiness; to which purpose, he made ready the Chariot, and Harness'd the Buffles to draw her; which he attended with great Zeal and Religious Diligence: And what Countreys soever she pass'd through, all War turn'd suddenly to Peace. Nor finish'd she her Progress, till the Priest had fully inform'd her, of the several Impieties raging and reigning everywhere; which done, she driving into a Lake, as weary of this World, suddenly vanish'd, never appearing more; and all the Retinue that belong'd to her, following the Chariot, in like manner drown'd themselves: From whence arose that kind of mad Zeal and frantick Desire, of thus ma∣king themselves away by Water, that so they might meet with the Pleasures of the other World. In what place the God∣dess Hertha was chiefly wor∣shipp'd.Philippus Cluverius, in his History of Germany, affirms, That the Island before∣mention'd by Tacitus, is no other but Rugau; where yet to this day, near the Promontory Stubbenkamar, stands a Thicket call'd De Stubenitz, and in the same a Lake of Black Water, so deep, that it is suppos'd to be bottomless; which though it abounds with Fish, yet is not frequented by Fishers; this proceed∣ing out of a Reverential awe or fear of this thought to be Sacred Water: Yet some less scrupulous in Points of that nature, undertook lately to leave a Boat in the foremention'd Pool, designing to Fish there the next day; and coming in the Morning, their Boat was gone, which after long search they found fix'd in an Oaken Tree: Whereupon one of the Fishermen cry'd aloud, saying, What! were all the Devils joyn'd together, to cast my Boat in yonder Tree?Strange Relation. Upon which he heard a terrible Voyce replying, All the Devils were not imploy'd, but onely two, I and my Brother Claes. But not only this Pool belonging to the Nymph Hertha, were they Diabollically perswaded to make themselves away in; but many other Places in Germany, where upon the like account Self-murder was committed, by throwing themselves headlong into the Water, raging to follow the same Goddess to the foremention'd Seats of Bliss. A farther Description of Canons Temple.¶ BUt to return again to the Temple of Canon: The same rises aloft with three peculiar Stories, whose Roofs are six-square, jetting out a great way over the Walls. Every Partition hath three double Windows; on∣ly between the second and lowest Story stands a Gallery, supported on twenty eight great Pillars. The Walls painted with all manner of Fishes, adorn much the outside of the Temple. Description of the Idol Canon.Within stands the Idol Canon, who, according to the Relation of the Bonzi, or Japan Priests, liv'd two thousand Years ago, and created the Sun and Moon. The Image appears from the middle upwards as if rising out of the Jaws of a Fish: On his Forehead sticks a Flower: From each Elbow-joynt come two
Arms; one erected, with a Ring on the Middle-finger; the other pendent, holding a Flower between his Fingers. That Right-hand which he holds aloft is clinch'd; the lowermost holds a Scepter: About his Arms, Neck, and Middle hang Strings of Pearl: From his Shoulders hang two Scarfs: Before him stands the Figure of a Youth, appearing from the middle upward out of a great Shell; who with Arms erected, prays to Canon; having a Scarf ty'd about his Middle, of which the ends hang over: On the right side stands an Altar, on which are plac'd four Images, in a supplicating posture; out of their Hands, folded together, springs Water, which runs into four round Holes made for their Feet. The Mythologie of these, and the Figure in the Shell, the Bon∣zies refus'd to declare. The Chief Buildings in Osacca.¶ ON the right side of Canon's Temple stands the Admirals House; and somewhat near this City, a stately Cloyster of the Bonzies, rising with two high Roofs or Stories, a great distance one from the other. Next this is the Habitation of the General, known by its double Roofs, and Gable Ends; hard by which stands the Temple with two hundred Images: And no less stately is the Palace belonging to the Lord-Treasurer of Japan. In the same Street stands a Watch-Tower, which is seen by Land six Leagues from the City; and at Sea, seven. The Church in which the Ima∣ges of the old Bonzies are kept as Holy Reliques, is also very curious to behold; part of it may be seen at some distance at Sea, and the other part conceals it self behind the Hills. How it is within.Moreover Osacca, like most of the other Cities in Japan, hath neither Walls nor Bulwarks; but is divided in the middle by a Current, on both sides of which are stately Buildings, made of Clay; the outsides cover'd with Boards, to keep the Water from soaking through; within full of large Cham∣bers. In the time of the Emperor Xogunsama, Anno 1614. seven Ships with Convicts went from the Haven of Osacca to Nangesaque, because they would
not desist from the Roman Catholique Religion: At that time also the Jesuits Church in Osacca was pull'd down by Sangamido, who was impower'd by the Emperor to persecute the Romanists; which was perform'd with all manner of Cruelty, all imaginable Tortures being us'd on them. Osacca is oftentimes ru∣in'd in the Japan Civil-Wars.But above all, Osacca suffer'd much by the Civil Wars which the Japanners maintain'd one against another, each striving to obtain the Imperial Crown; insomuch that the City and Castle fell now into the hands of one, and then of the other. After the Death of the Emperor Taycosama, Anno 1601. Japan was exceeding∣ly turmoyl'd in a Civil War; nine Princes joyning against Dayfusama, of whom the Chief Commander was Morindono King of nine Provinces, out of which he rais'd Forty thousand Men, many Great Persons amongst them; and had also the Treasure of the deceas'd Taycosama, and all Necessaries for War: In the interim, some of these Provincials set upon Dayfusama, who en∣tertain'd them so roughly, that Eighty thousand Men were either slain by the Sword, ripp'd open their own Bowels, or were taken Prisoners, few of them escaping by Flight. Conquest of Dayfusama.Hereupon Dayfusama carried his Victorious Army with all speed to Osacca, where Morindono was so much astonish'd at his gotten Victory, that he left the Invincible Castle Osacca, which was provided with double Stores, and strong enough to endure the greatest Siege that could be,Osacca is taken. to Dayfusama; before whose Approach, he with some of his Nobles forsook the Castle, and went to his stately Palace beyond Osacca, resolving to submit himself freely to the Mercy of the Conqueror. But the King of Sassuma shew'd much more Courage: for he, with Six hun∣dred Soldiers, valiantly fought his way through the Conquering Army of Day∣fusama, and marching on undiscompos'd towards Osacca, got thither some Hours before Dayfusama, where he furnish'd himself with such Vessels as he found, with which he Sail'd to his own Kingdom Sassuma, distant above two hundred Leagues from Osacca, to the end that he might there Fortifie himself against Dayfusama. A horrible Earthquake in Osacca.¶ BEsides this their suffering by War, this City before endur'd a far great∣er Misery, almost to an utter Desolation, by a sudden Earthquake, happening Anno 1585, the fourth of August, about Midnight; which was so terrible, that they expected nothing less than present Destruction. The first shudder or shake was so vehement, that in less than half an hours space, many hundreds were buried in the Rubbish of their own fallen Houses. The fairest Buildings first failed, coming to ground with horrible cracks; amongst which, that stately Palace, the fairest and largest that ever the Sun shin'd upon, which Taycosama built, with ample Galleries, and such spacious Courts, that therein they say he was able to Exercise a hundred and fifty thousand Men. This stupendious piece of Architect he built on purpose to shew his Power and Magnificence to Ambassadors, that were ready with an Embassy from the Em∣peror of China. The Xetherland Ambas∣sadors travel from Osacca.¶ OUr Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst, after they had taken a full Survey of the City Osacca, departed from thence the twentieth of January, Anno 1649. Early in the Morning their Goods were sent before, the Carriage requir'd eighty two Horses: And the whole Train consisted of for∣ty
four Netherlanders and Bongois on Horseback, a hundred Bearers, appointed onely to carry and look to the Presents, the Silver Vessel, great Looking-glass, and many other Rarities. The Ambassadors went in several Sedans, being attended in all by three hundred Men, and a hundred twenty eight Horses. Their Journey to Menco.With this Train the Ambassadors came about Noon to the great Village Fi∣raskatta, where they Dined; and about four a clock they travell'd through Jon∣da, which is a small City, curiously built, Fortified with a strong Castle, and surrounded with Walls. The Governor of this Place came to meet the Am∣bassadors, who having a considerable Train, was carried in a Sedan, and fol∣low'd by some of his Guards. All the way which they pass'd was on a high Bank, verg'd with Rice-Fields so far as could be discern'd. At that time it was every where Frozen very hard on the top of this Bank; and in going down the same, they Travell'd through several Villages, and the Way it self was planted on both sides with Trees. Description of the Japan Cedars.Amongst these the Cedars rais'd their lofty tops above all the others, to an exceeding height. Theophrastus relates, That the Syrians and Phenicians us'd Ce∣dars for the Building of their Ships: The same Custom is at this day in Ja∣pan, and no marvel, because the Cedar hath a Gummy Moysture, which pre∣serves it from rotting; which Secret the Japanners not knowing, oftentimes look upon the Sudor or Sweating of their Cedar Images as a great Wonder: But this is occasion'd by the moist Air, and a South Wind, which generally draws an Oyl out of that Wood. Moreover this Tree grows higher and thicker, according to the several Places it is Planted in. On the Mountains of Syria they grow so large-wasted, that four Men are scarce able to fathom one of them; but these have spiny and slender Bodies, considering their wondrous Height, whose lofty Crowns seem to mingle with the Clouds. Japan also produ∣ces Cedars, no ways inferior to those: The Leaves thereof are soft and downy, but prickly at the sharp ends. There is also a small kind of Resemblance be∣tween the Cedar and the Juniper-Tree; but the Leaf of the last is longer and
smaller, and grows nothing near so high; and the Wood thereof, being cut asunder and us'd, is soon subject to rot: And also the Cedars are of a more fragrant smell, and bear a kind of Cod not unlike the Myrtle, which being open'd, hath four white Corns or Grains, like Rice, inclos'd in them; which when ripe, are of a deep yellow Colour; whereas the Juniper-berry is black, bitterish, and unpleasant to the Palate. Gum of Cedars, of what Vertue and Use.The Gum which the Cedar produces, preserves the dead Corps from decay∣ing; and the Berries have three several tastes: for the innermost of them is of a sharp rellish, the outermost Shell sweet, and the Pulp it self between sweet and sowre. These Trees either have continually Fruits or Blossoms on them: So that whilst one Tree bears Blossoms or Green-fruit, the other Ripen. This Fruit being hot in Operation, helps all Coughs proceeding from cold De∣fluxions, the Cramp, opens obstructed Uritories; and the Oyl thereof, if the Body be annointed therewith, defends it from the biting of Venomous Crea∣tures. Furthermore, the Cedar always flourisheth, being constantly green; whose stately Branches run up in an exact Line, like the Trees themselves; but if the Branches grow too heavy for them, the Body of the Tree commonly bends, growing crooked under the Burthen: The Cod which incloses the Berries, when it begins to ripen, opens it self, and in time of Rain or Mists, drops off, leaving a round Stalk at the Boughs: This Stalk decays not till two Years after the dropping off of the Cod, which of it self requires a whole Year before it becomes ripe, and this happens chiefly in Winter. The Ambassadors come to Meaco.Along this Bank, shaded with Trees, verging the River, the Netherland Am∣bassadors going through a Town call'd Iondo, came to Meaco, where they were Receiv'd and Lodg'd in the House of a Wealthy Merchant. ¶ THis Imperial City Meaco lies in the Province of Mino, eighteen Leagues beyond Osacca. Along this River (which takes its Original from a great Lake three Hours Walk beyond Meaco, discharging its Waters through Osacca into the Sea) stands the Imperial Blood-Grove;The Imperial Blood Grove near Meaco, why so call'd. which Denomination it receiv'd from the Japan Emperor Nobunanga, who was murder'd there June 22. Anno 1582. The Emperor Nobunan∣ga would be worshipp'd as a God.¶ THis Nobunanga in the time of his Reign had erected a new City, and call'd it Anzuquiama, on a pleasant Hill, raising within it a stately Temple; which to make the more famous, he caus'd to be brought thither the most Ador'd and Venerable Idols in all Japan. Next to this Temple he Found∣ed a Sumptuous Chappel, where on a polish'd Marble he had his Imperial Arms Ingraven, and his own Statue delineated to the Life; which so soon as finish'd, he publish'd his Royal Edicts, with strict Commands, That after Proclamation, and the appointed Time, none should dare presume thenceforth to worship any other God, than that his Image in the Temple, within the City Anzuquiama, because he was Created by Heaven and Earth. Soon after he set forth second Orders, with the like strictness, That on such a day, being our last of February, all Persons, of what Degree soever, should keep holy that Day, being his Imperial Majesties Birth-day; requiring them also to repair to the Chappel at Anzuquiama, and there to worship the new god Xantai: To which he also added Promises, and Threatnings; viz. Those that did according to his Commands, adoring this his own new-erected Sta∣tue, should, if they were Poor, grow Rich; and if Wealthy, their Estates
should be augmented or improv'd, with the enjoyment of a long Life, in great felicity: And those that neglected this Duty, were to expect the contrary. A great resort of People to Meaco.This being Proclaim'd through all the Empire, the great City Meaco was much too little for so vast a Concourse of People, that in throngs flock'd dai∣ly thither: So that several Leagues were taken up round about the City, for the Entertainment of these mighty Multitudes; the Town being first cramm'd up, and many forc'd to ly aboard their Ships. A new Idol Xantai.On the Day of Celebration, the young Prince, Nobunanga's Son, first be∣gan the Ceremony, prostrating himself in a devout manner before the new Image Xantai: After, in order, the Kings, Princes, and Nobles, and other Eminent Persons, in their respective Degrees. At which time appear'd, to their great amazement, a wonderful Prodigy, a Blazing Comet; and also at Noon-day Fire falling from Heaven; seeming to signifie sudden and sad Misfortunes, all threatning and impending over the Head of Nobunanga.A Temple and Idol at Dubo. About a Mile from Meaco, in the Village Dubo, Nobunanga also built a fair Temple, in which he set up an Image, intended for his own, and to the Life resembling himself. The Idol sits Cross-legg'd in the middle of a Pedestal, rais'd with broad Margins, curiously Ingraven, his Hands lying upon his Belly: About his Neck hangs flying a loose Scarf: Chains of precious Gems and Jewels adorn his Breast and Bosom; and a tripple Chain of Pearl about his Neck, Waste, and Belly. But the greatest Ornament was the Illustrious Crown which impalled his Head, which thus Nobunanga made himself Master on. Nobunango makes him∣self Emperor of Japan.Anno 1564, the Emperor Cubo Govern'd Japan, who kept his Court at Meaco: when Twelve thousand Traytors conspiring against the Emperor, enter'd in∣to a Solemn League and Covenant, and at the first appearance surpris'd Meaco, firing the Palace in four Places.The Japan Emperor Cu∣bo is murder'd.Cubo being taken thus unprepar'd, not able to put himself in fit posture of Defence, yet made a bold Sally, adventuring with his Sword drawn, follow'd onely with Two hundred Men, to make his
view of Miako (Kyoto) MIAKO
way through; but there being over-power'd, receiving several Wounds, he was slain, and the rest all cut in pieces. So the Regicides broke into the Pa∣lace; where finding the Emperors Mother and Daughter, they made up their bloody Breakfast by such Female Murders: but the Empress her self, conceal'd in a Cloyster of the Bonzi, being discover'd, in cold Blood, acting Rebellion to the heighth, as a Criminal, they beheaded. Thus they destroy'd the whole Royal Family, onely preserving Cubo his younger Brother, because he had taken the Order of Priesthood; and that they might not suspect him hereafter, they ty'd him with a Sacerdotal Vow, and oblig'd him by the like Religious Promises; but he by this means making his Escape, he secretly convey'd himself to Vatadomo, Governor of Loca, who re∣ceiv'd him very courteously, and perswaded to his assistance Nubunanga, King of Boari; who joyning together, brought an Army of sixty thousand Men into the Field against the Emperors Murderers, who finding themselves not able to resist, they freely resign'd (some of the prime Abettors being punish'd) he in stead of putting in the next of Blood, made himself absolute Master of the City and Castle of Meaco, re-edifying the burnt Palace,Meaco taken; and the burut Palace re-built. which for the sudden perfecting he neither spar'd Cost nor Labor, employing fifteen thousand Men daily at Work; and going up and down with a drawn Scymiter, that none might be idle or lose any time, where he cut off a Carpenter's Head, for lifting up the Vail of a Woman, by chance then passing by. At last Nubunanga went on so victoriously, that in short time he conquer'd and brought under his subjection thirty several Kingdoms; also making him∣self Master of Cubo, setting the Imperial Crown upon his Head, as a Trophy of his Victories: and afterwards put the same upon his new Idol in Dubo, which represented him to the life, that so he might, whilst living be worshipp'd as a god: to which end he wanted not store of Sycophant Courtiers, and other City Flatterers, that held him up in this his vanity, making him believe, That nothing could be more just and honorable for a Person that had perform'd such wondrous Acts, and made so many Conquests by his Prudence, sole Conduct, and Valor. But others resented hainously this his vain Imagination, and proud Design; not but that several Princes they had themselves deifi'd for their worthy Acti∣ons after they were deceased, but that his ambition should aspire so high, to be both God and Man at once, and whilst he was yet living, and subject to all mortal frailties, he should blasphemiously presume to take place among the gods, and receive Offerings and Sacrifice, onely fit for Immortals, and the ever blest; unless (said they) we should make him a god for his Cruelty, his Promise-breaking and Perjury: for whatsoever Countreys were surrendred to him, trusting in the Honor of a Prince, his Oaths and Clemency, he put with∣out mercy to the Sword, as if he had taken them by Storm, and entred by violence. But more than any, King Aquechi, being a bold and high-spirited Prince, chaf'd and storm'd, and would not sit down tamely, and talk onely of this his prophane arrogance, though he had oblig'd him with many great favors and bounty, making him King of Tango, and General over his whole Army; yet in such a Point as this, the honor of Religion, and the true Wor∣ship of their ever just gods, at the stake: therefore converting the Emperors whole Forces against him, he march'd up to Meaco the two and twentieth of June, Anno 1582.The Prince Aquechi flays Nubunanga. Nubunanga being thus suddenly surpris'd and beleaguer'd with his own Forces, had no way to attempt his Escape, but being follow'd close by
the Enemy, he was, after some resistance, slain in the Wood near the River of Meaco, which from thence receiv'd the denomination of The Imperial Blood-Grove. Revenues of the Temple at Dubo.The Temple which he erected in the Village Dubo, hath a Revenue of two hundred thousand Tail of Silver yearly, every Japan Tail reckon'd to be five Shillings Sterling. But now we will return again to Meaco. Description of the City Meaco.¶ ON the side of this Imperial City is the great Mountain Duboyamma, which runs to Iondo; at whose Foot stands the Village Dubo, adorn'd with the stately Temple, erected there by Nobunanga, whose lofty Roof is seen in some Places above the shading Trees.The Idol Xaca at Dubo. Within stands the great Idol Xaca, taken for the chiefest in Japan; for which cause the Temple is constantly Lockt up, except at one time in the year; when it is open'd with great Cere∣mony, and entred first by that Order of Priesthood, call'd Foquexus. Several Opinions of the Japanners concerning their Religion.¶ THe Japanners differ so much in their Opinions in matters of Religion, that they may be divided into three principal Sects, which branch into many. The Sect Xenxus.The first call'd Xenxus, acknowledge the Life to come, a Reward for the Good, and Punishment for all Evil doers. The Bonzi are of this Opinion, and chiefly shew great Reverence to their Idol Chamis:The Idol Chamis. for whose honor they have Founded several Temples, and use his Name upon all serious Matters, or when they take the Oath of Allegiance to their Emperor: To him they bring several Offerings, praying him either to remove those troubles which are upon them, or else to grant them a victorious and happy success in all their Enterprises. Pythagorea Doctrine embraced in Japan.The second Perswasion allow also of the immortality of the Soul; but ac∣cording to Pythagoras, That the Soul should be transmigrated, according to their merits, either to worthier or baser Creatures, himself giving out, that he had once been Aethalides, Son of Mercury, who granted him a Boon to ask one fa∣vor whatsoever he desir'd, excepting Immortality: whereupon he requested, That he might know and remember what-ever happen'd to him after his death, and not be forc'd to drink Lethe, the River of Oblivion: so after Aethalides his Decease, he was transmigrated into Euphorbus a Trojan Heroe, slain by Menelaus, next Hermotius then Pyrrbus a Fisherman of Delier, and lastly the foremention'd Pythagoras the Philosopher, who broach'd this so much follow'd Doctrine. The Idol Omyto.This Sect which they style Xenxus, worship the Deity Omyto, commonly call'd Amida. The Fables which the Japanners relate of this Idol are beyond all apprehensions, and above our Faith to believe. It will be enough to relate, how they ascribe Salvation and everlasting happiness to this their god Amida,The Ido Amida. always invoking him with these words, Namu Amida Buth, that is, Save us, Bles∣sed Amida, save us; which oft repeated Prayers they number upon Beads, as the Roman Catholicks do their Devotions, the Image holding a String of Beads like theirs. The Secth Foqueux wor∣ship the Idol Xaca.The third of the Grand Sectaries being Foqueux, pay their Devotions to the Idol Xaca, to whom they use commonly thus to Pray, Namu, Mio, Foreo, Qui, Quio, which whosoever speaks best and pronounces best, seems to them so do∣ing, to be a good Omen of their future happiness; notwithstanding there is no Japanner, extracted from India, that well understands these words. These Worshippers of the Idol Xaca are Cambadagies and Cacubo's, both esteem'd very zealous and religious amongst the Japanners.
Mord des Keisers Kubo. Vermoorde vande Keyser CUBUS. The Murdering of the Emperor CUBUS
Cambadagi teaches Ido∣latry.Cambadagi taught them first to offer Sacrifices to the Devil, and use Necro∣mantick Arts; the other, Divination and Witchcraft, like the Chinese Priests. Most of these live in Hills and desolate Places, remote from all humane Society. In the Village Dubo, on the Skirts of the Mountain Dubojamma, a Mile from Meaco, stands a Temple, the Residence of the great Idol Xaca. The River which near Osacca discharges it self in the Ocean, runs through the City. The chief Building of Meaco.This City is surrounded by Suburbs, and hath a Bridge, with two Tow∣ers on each side of the River; near the Gate, through which runs the Way. that leads to Oets and Jesi, are very strong Watch-houses, both for Horse and Foot, where constantly they keep a strict Guard. Somewhat farther stands the high Tower, from whose top the Emperor may behold the great Lake near Jesi, and the pleasant Hill Pauromama. Temple of the Bozi.Next to this is another Tower, which is the Emperors Armory. On the right side of this Structure appears the magnificent Temple, dedicated to the six Orders of Bonzi, where the chief of this Priesthood call'd Xaximofins dwell, and have their Residence. The Palace of the Gayro.But in the Center, or middle of the City, stands, what out-shines all, the glorious Palace of the Dayro, whom they so much reverence, esteeming his Royal Person to be so sacred, that his Feet are not suffer'd to touch the Earth, nor the Sun to shine on any part of his Body; nor will they allow him to breathe the common or open Air; neither must the Hair of his Beard and Head be Clipt or Shav'd, nor his Nails Par'd: his Table is always plentiful∣ly supply'd, and every Course dress'd and serv'd up in new Dishes. The Emperor's Court.On the right hand is the Emperors Court, built more obscurely under the jetting side of a Mountain, and therefore scarce seen by those which travel from Osacca to Meaco, onely some of the Pinacles appear above the Hills. Great Costs and Charges did Nobunango bestow in the re-building of this Palace after the burning of the same by the Rebels. Near this is the Imperial Garden, full of Trees and odoriferous Flowers, which are so curiously Planted, that the Eye which beholds them seems never satisfi'd with so pleasant an Object. Palaces of the Japan Kings.On both sides of this Garden are the Courts in which the Kings that com∣monly attend the Emperor, have their Residence, every one striving to exceed the other in Building; so that end of the City seems all one Palace, being adorn'd with so many sumptuous Edifices. The left side of the Dayro's Palace is shaded by an exceeding high Turret,Banquetting-Turrets. cover'd with a Golden Plate; below the Court, towards the River, are twelve more large and stately Houses, which make one Seraglio,The Seraglio. in which the Dayro keeps his Concubines. Besides all other Buildings, the House of the chief Bonsjosen, call'd Eglanmith, that is, The light of understanding, makes a most glorious shew. Somewhat lower you may see the Wall built by the Emperor Dayfusama; when he extended Meaco four Leagues in circumference. No less costly is the great square Temple, with three Roofs rais'd very high, which incloseth the gilded Idol Dai Buth: to whose Worship the Japanners re∣pair and flock from all Parts both far and near. The Governors Court of Xoquansie appears also very glorious. The Em∣perors Custom-house stands near the Gate which leads to Iondo, through which the Hollanders coming from Osacca made their entrance into this City,
where all Strangers produce their Letters and Pasports, not till then being permitted to go any farther. On the left side of the Custom-house a beautiful Temple shews it self, three stately Spires rising from the uppermost Roof, which contains as many gods, or Idols, as there are days in the year. Daily in order they take down an Image, which with great Ceremony they carry to the Chamber of the Eglamnith, where, after staying all Night, the Priests next Morning waiting upon it, carry it with great solemnity to the Temple, affixing it in its former Place. The Emperors prime Herald, or King at Arms, call'd Honroccou Racclaybono, resides in another fair Court with three Roofs. Next this a Watch-house, under whose Roof two thousand Men constantly keep Courts of Guard, always ready under Duty. At the farthermost part of the City stands the Emperors Stables and Store∣houses, wherein are kept all the Furniture and Arms belonging to Horse and Man; within whose utmost Bounds they may exercise forty thousand Horse∣men. The Citizens themselves dwell also in little Palaces, with such variety of Rooms, Lodgings and Apartments, as they think fit, which when they please they divide into many more, with Partitions curiously Gilt and Varnish'd af∣ter the Indian manner, which they set up and remove with small trouble, so al∣tering their whole House upon all occasions for their conveniency. Meaco flourishes beyond all the Cities in Japan, because all others suffer much and often by Civil Wars, when this being the Seat of the Dayro, after he was degraded of his Imperial Authority, they bearing so much respect and re∣verence to his Person, that they never look'd that way, nor drew their Armies near that Place, not so much as once to disturb him.
Father progress of the Netherland Ambassadors. Oets.¶ ONe Night the Hollanders stay'd in this City, and towards Noon on the one and twentieth of January, travell'd to the great Village call'd Oets. The way which directed thither was between high Mountains, on both sides built with Houses, one side appearing a stately Fort, rais'd on the Promontory of a River. In Oets the Ambassadors stay'd some hours to refresh themselves; then going forward, they went through Jesi, a Wall'd City,Jesi. to which leads an even. Path, each side beset with pleasant Trees; at the end of which Lane stands a Village, wash'd by the Water; on whose Promontory the Castle Oets is built. The Water in this Place makes two Inlets, or Greeks, over the one a small Wooden Bridge, and over the other a Bridge of two hundred and thirty Steps long. Japan Beggars¶ THis Road is much pester'd with Beggars, as most Ways of Japan are, which commonly have a great many Children with them. These poor People carry a Dish in their Hands, in which they receive and gather Alms. The Women carry a Budget, or Bag, and a Callibash, which hangs before them, and under that their Purse. Oftentimes whole Generations of them banish'd by the Emperor from the Cities, Range all over the Countrey with their Wives and Children. The antient People and Infants they carry in square Baskets, which they make fast to the Horns of two Oxen, one going before, and another behind, the rest lead the way, and follow, Singing Songs and Sonnets of the valiant Acts of the antient Japan Hero's, and so passing by seve∣ral Houses, of which the Inhabitants, in reward for their Singing, bountifully bestow Alms upon them. ¶ THe Netherlanders departing from Jesi, came towards the Evening over a steep and scraggy Mountain into the Village Cusatz. Here grow the best sort of Canes.This Place produces the best sort of Japan Canes or Sticks: The young Sprigs, fill'd with sweet Juice, are tough and full of Joints, each distinguish'd at equal distance by a round Knot, being small at bottom, and thick on the top. These Canes they use in stead of Ropes to tie with;The use and description of them. and also make Cables of them for their greatest Ships, which last longer than those of Hemp. They al∣so make all manner of Baskets and Hampers of these Canes, which are much stronger than the Europeans that are Pleited of Twigs: and two Pieces of the said Cane being rubb'd hard together, serve in stead of a Flint and Steel for to strike Fire with. Fruit-bearing Canes.There is a sort of these Canes which bears a sharp Fruit, the Shell of a Ches∣nut colour, thorny, and full of streaks, which grow athwart one another, and is about the bigness of a small Apple, or Crab; on each Bough from the top to the bottom, in stead of Leaves, are small knotted Branches, which being ve∣ry tough, are Pleited together like a Rope: The longest of these bears the Fruit which hangs just at the end thereof in a Cluster of six or seven Cods to∣gether, each containing a hard Kernel; out of which they press Oyl, of a pe∣culiar Vertue for the curing of Wounds, and therefore much us'd by the Slaves to heal those cruel Blows, which oftentimes they receive from their Masters with those Canes till the Blood runs down their Backs. Moreover, there are another sort which grow about Cusatz, shooting up from the Roots of small Trees, which spread themselves Pleited together a great way.
¶ BEfore day-light the Ambassadors proceeded forward in their Journey, and ere the Sun appear'd,Itzibe. they were got to the Village Itzibe. About two Leagues beyond Itzibe they Ferry'd over the River Jocatangauwa; and about ten a Clock they came to Minacutz. Here a strong Castle stands for the securing of the Road which leads to Meaco. To Minabutz guides an even Way, on both sides Planted with shading Trees, and border'd with Rice-Fields as far as they could discern. Japan above all other Countreys abounds in Rice,Japan Rice. and produces much bet∣ter than any other Place in India; whose Coasts it not onely supplies, but also all Europe in a plentiful manner: they Mowe it in September, the whitest sort bearing the higest Price: that which is brown, growing in Begu and Sian, is of a far less value. In Japan, as also in all India, are no Mills to Grind any manner of Corn; wherefore they Bake no Bread after our European manner. Their Rice serves them in stead of Bread, but is boyl'd in Water, and brought to their Tables like Pap or Pudding. The Rice which is not kneaded but in Lumps, is very unwholsom, and occasions the griping in the Bowels, and weak Eyes. They also Roast their Rice after that it is boyl'd, making it in Cakes. Father Xaverius relates, that travelling through Japan, he sustain'd himself a long time by those Cakes of Rice, which the Japanners call'd Arela, carrying some of them with him in his Sleeves. The Rice when growing hath a fatty thick Leaf, not unlike those of Hous∣leek, but broader, shooting up half a Yard from the Ground, with a Purple-colour'd Flower, and a double Root. Plinius affirms, that the Indians made Oyl of Rice: but at present, not onely in Japan, but in all India, they make a very strong Liquor of it. The Mountain Coetseca∣jamma.¶ THe Hollanders leaving Minacutz, encountred with that high Moun∣tain call'd Coetsecajamma, where they found much trouble in carry∣ing over their Goods and Package; yet at last getting through Zintzsamma and Sacca, they came to Sicconoziro, where they rested all Night. An hour before day-light the next Morning, the Moon shining, the Ways and Rivers also Frozen very hard, they proceeded forward in their Journey, where afar off they espy'd a costly Edifice,Castle Cammiammi. being the Castle Cammiammi, rising aloft with very high Turrets. The Walls built of Free-stone, fortifi'd the Ca∣stle in such a manner, that it seem'd able to endure a hard Siege. Beyond this Fortress appears a large Village. About two Leagues farther they entred the Town Isacutz;PLACE="marg"Isacutz. and whilst they were there at Dinner, some Rusticks came and offer'd them Provisions to sell, being Clothed as the ordinary Citizens, or Burgers,Description of the Ja∣pan Rusticks. Riding through the Countrey on Buffles, having a Hook in his Nose, which being made fast to a Chain, and coming about his Ears, and between his Horns, serves them for a Bridle. The Women wear Clogs under their Feet, which have a Knob that sticks between their great and second Toe, to keep them close to their Feet: they wear a kind of short Boots, or Buskins, which they fasten with Strings athwart one another.
¶ FRom Isacutz the Ambassadors travell'd through Zono, Ojebakitz, Owaka,Isacutz. Jokeitz, and Tonuda, to Quana:The City Quana. In the closing of the Evening they entred the City, which above all Places in Japan is most artificially built, and sur∣rounded with strong Walls, on one side fortifi'd with a large Castle all of hewn Stone, whose Turrets are seen at a great distance. The City Piongo ruin'd by Wars and Earthquakes.¶ ABout half way between Meaco and Quano, stands more Northerly into the Countrey, the famous City Piongo, which in the War that Nobanunga maintain'd after the Emperor Cubus's death, was quite ruin'd: For when Ca∣vadonis Vocata, Brother of the deceased Cubus, who was the onely Person that was left alive of that Imperial Family, escaping from his Enemies, and flying to Vantandonus for Aid, which he obtain'd, was not onely nobly treated by him in his Castle, but also endeavor'd by perswasions to stir up his neighboring Kings to take revenge on the Emperor's Murderers; amongst whom Nobanun∣ga, King of Voari, willingly embraced this opportunity, to the end, as he pre∣tended, to help Vocata to the Crown of his deceased Brother Cubus; but contra∣ry, in a Civil War, he embroil'd the whole Countrey: for when Nobanunga had quell'd the Rebels, and made Peace with their chief Commanders, Mioxidoni, and Diondoni, he never so much as thought of establishing Vocata in the Throne, but turn'd his victorious Army against other Japan Kings; of which he brought thirty under his subjection, as is said before: and by these Conquests made himself Master of the whole Empire. Amongst which fluctuating Commoti∣ons and Turmoils of an intestine War, Piongo bore no small share; for being taken by force, it had not quite worn out the marks of Nobanunga's cruelties: and soon after, in the Year 1596. was totally ruin'd by a terrible Earthquake, that more than half the City, with Houses, Temples, and People, were swal∣low'd up in the Earth, and the remaining part thereof turn'd so topsie-turvie, that it represented nothing but a heap of Ruins and Rubbish, and miserable marks of Divine severity.
Terrible Earthquakes in Trugillo¶ THese Earthquakes in Japan are very common, as also in America; and amongst other Places, Trugillo, a City in Peru, Anno 1619. the fourth of February, was exceedingly shaken by the like Trepidation: a little before Noon the Ground began to move, and in few Minutes ran the space of an hundred and sixty Leagues, continuing very fiercely for fifteen Days; all which time a dreadful Comet hung over their Heads, which added, if possible, more terror to the Inhabitants, expecting their utter destruction, and the end of the World. Two being struck with a consternation, became dumb.Besides those great numbers that were destroy'd, and had scarce room to lie buried under the ruin'd Buildings, it is worthy our observation, how Peter Flores a Councellor, Johannes Pontinus de Leon, Secretary to the Peruan Bishop, both Spaniards, were struck with such a wonderful consternation, that they be∣came dumb, and never spake after. A strange accident.Amongst others also happen'd another strange Accident, which may serve as a fit pattern of Divine Justice: A publick Notary coming over thither, and being busied about drawing some Articles of Agreement, by which a poor Man suffer'd much injury and great damage, he having false Witnesses ready to Sign the same, one there present discover'd the Cheat, who falling out with the false Witnesses, was by them drove out of the House, and he no soon∣er being got in the Street, but the House tumbled down, killing him and his false Witnesses. Great Earthquakes in Canada.No less terrible was another late Earthquake in Canada. The first of Febru∣ary, Anno 1663. there arose a great noise and rumbling like Thunder in the Air; whereupon soon after the Bells fell a Jangling as if they had Rung of them∣selves, the Walls rent asunder, great pieces of Timber and Stones fell on the Ground, the Roofs of Houses and the Trees struck and fought one against an∣other. Near the Village call'd The Three Rivers, two great Mountains with Woods were turn'd with the bottoms upwards, Rocks and Mountains thrown into the River, so making several Channels in the same, and the Waters made new In∣roads into the Countrey. In other Places Hills were swallow'd up, whole Woods remov'd, and by Pauwels Village a Mountain was wash'd off by the Floods, and became an Island, and is still to be seen in the River. But no Countrey in the World suffers so many Calamities, and more almost total Ruines, than this our Japan. ¶ FRom Quano the Ambassadors took Shipping: for between Quano and Mia the Ocean makes a great Bay, so that none can travel by Land but with great Charges, loss of Time, and through bad Ways: for which cause they hir'd sixteen Japan Vessels, in which they Shipp'd their Goods, Hor∣ses and Men; so hoising Sail, and having a small Gale of Wind, it was Mid∣night before they reach'd Mia, the Bay being about seven Leagues over. Description of the City Mia.¶ THis City is very curiously built, and adorn'd with many Temples, and fortifi'd towards the Sea with a strong Castle. Here the Hollan∣ders stay'd a whole Night. Sacci Bonzi, Japan Priests.In this place, as generally through all Japan, they met with the Sacci Bonzi, being Japan Priests, which perform their Duties in the Temples, and serve as Chaplains in Noble-mens Houses, as we said; their Hats made of fine Straw,
with broad round Brims, the Crown like our Scull-caps, fitting just the Mold of their Heads: their Coats, which are very wide, hanging down to their Heels, of several colours, and are Selvidg'd with white: their Girdles, which are broad, and stuff'd full of Cotton, serve them in stead of Pockets for their Books and Memorials; which they use chiefly in their publick Devotions: their Shoes, like Slippers, having a Heel rais'd with three pieces of Leather: In the right Hand they carry a thick Cord, roll'd up like a Spindle; in the left, a Copper Bason, Engraven with Images, representing the Japan Idols: on which Basons they strike with great force with the knotted Rope. But this custom of theirs they use but seldom, unless they make Offerings and Sacrifices in the open Streets: for at other times, when they perform their Services in the Church, they hang the same at the Door, or Entrance of the Temple. Narromi, Siriomi, and the stately City Occosacci.¶ THe Ambassadors parted from Mia the twenty fourth of January in the foremention'd Year 1646. travelling through the great Village Narromi, and Siriomi, to the stately City Occosacci, full of curious Buildings, and fortifi'd with a strong Castle, which defends it from the sudden Onset of the Enemy. To this City leads a Bridge of an hundred eighty eight Paces long, over which the Hollanders carry'd their Goods. Here they Din'd, and in the After∣noon march'd on through Fintzara to Accasacci. The Road thither is exceed∣ing pleasant, in some places of it divided by several Rivulets; others with easie Ascents, and delightful Valleys, but each shaded with Trees. In Accasacci they rested all Night, and on the five and twentieth of January travell'd through the great Village Goo; and passing over a very long Bridge of Timber, they came to the City Josinda, having a most delightful Situ∣ation;The City Josinda. the Hills round about cover'd with a pleasant Shade, and the Ways Planted with Trees in such order, that their tops meet together, making the
whole Road one artificial Arbor, defending Travellers, not onely from the Heat of the Sun, but the Rain also. The Retinue of the Lord of Bungien very strange.About ten a Clock they reach'd the Village Ftagawa, where they met with some of the Lord of Bungien's Soldiers, who, according to the Relation of the Interpreter, came with a Commission from the Japan Emperor, residing at Jedo, to take possession of the Castle and Places belonging to Osacca. The first Train was follow'd by the Lord himself, who was carried in a Sedan; after him follow'd his Ammunition and Houshold stuff, guarded both by Foot and Horse, which Rid on stately and well-train'd Steeds, Arm'd with Bowes and Arrows, Launces, two Scymiters, one short, the other long, with a Dagger, and Helmets on their Heads, and Wax-leather Boots: The Foot as well as the Horse march'd very orderly, and in good Martial Discipline, not making the least noise, nor any one Voice heard, notwithstanding they were half an hour passing by in great Companies. About eleven a Clock the Netherlanders descending a Hill, entred the Village Siraski,Siraski. bordering the Sea, being wash'd by the same on the right side, and the left verg'd by a high Mountain cover'd with Trees. Leaving Siraski they reach'd to Arei,Arei. where the Sea makes a Bay of a League and a half broad, but is very shallow, which put them to much trouble in car∣rying over their Goods, because the Vessels oftentimes ran aground. On the opposite side of this Bay lies on a Promontory,Meisacca. the Village Meisacca. From hence Riding on in their Journey they went through several Vil∣lages, along a Road on both sides shaded with Trees, which brought them in the close of the Evening to Fannama.Fannama. The City Mitzke.Before day-light leaving this Village, they cross'd the River Terui, and vi∣sited Mitzke, a City curiously built, and fortifi'd with a fair Castle. From hence they reach'd Teucarai; where Dining, they went on through Kakingaw to Nisaca: near which is the Mountain Conay, a League and a half long. The Way that goes over this Mountain is pleasant, being Planted on both sides with Trees.
The Pallace of the Bousi. on a high Mountain.From the top of this Hill they saw a steep Ascent, which on the left side as they went had a sumptuous Edifice, rais'd and adorn'd with many Turrets and double Roofs, which appear'd Spiring above the shading Trees. The Japan Interpreters related, That it was one of their chiefest Universities or Schools in Japan, and the Residence for their most Learned Priests which seldom or never come abroad,Bonsi seldom come abroad. being continually busied with instructing and teaching their Youth there; every year on a Set-time repair thither from all parts of the Countrey divers other Priests, for to dispute with those that reside there about Religion and Philosophical matters; which Disputation is very strange, for often one of the Assembly or Priests is wanting on a sudden,One a year lost. whom they say, (if you will believe them) they never hear more of. Horrid self-murder com∣mitted in Japan, to the ho∣nor of their Idols.The Japan Interpreters being demanded how it happens, reply'd, That the Devil carry'd them away: Yet others think, that they sacrific'd themselves to the honor of the Idols Amida or Xaca, who they look upon as favorers of Sede∣cedes or self-slaughter, upon which account many make themselves away com∣monly after this manner. A few days after they are possess'd with this Frantick Zeal, mad to see their gods, and be where they reside, they go up and down craving Alms, and what they get they put in their wide sleeves, desiring the people to let them know their Commands, and what Commendations they should car∣ry from them to their Deities, on whom speedily they were resolv'd to attend; which frenzy the people look upon as true Devotion, and a Religious under∣taking. This done, they take with them new whetted Sythes, which they say, must clear the rough and untrodden ways, leading to Everlasting Happiness: Then they enter a Boat, which they prepare for that purpose, tying great stones about their Necks, Arms, Middle, and Legs, and thus they either leap over, or sink down-right, by pulling out a Plug, with the Boat under them; if he leap over, his friends that follow to see the horrid spectacle, presently throw Fire into his Boat, not allowing it to be fit for any Profane or common use after.
Great honor shown to them that drown themselves for their gods.¶ FAther Lodowick Frojus relates, That in his way to Miaco, coming to the Island Heu, in the Village Fore, where six Men and two Women had thus drown'd them∣selves, to whom the people had Built and Dedicated a Chappel, near the Shore, in memory of their so great Merits, and Devout destroying of themselves: The Walls of the Chappel with∣in were hung round with Clift Sticks, wherein were Verses stuck, with Elogiums, highly extolling the Religious Magnanimity of these miserable Desparadoes, which thus ventur'd by water to visit their God Amida. This place by Travellers and others is daily frequented, there entring to pay their Devotions to these Water-Saints, and tells us also, That passing another time that way with his Brother Lodowick Almeida, meeting with some antient Women that came out from their Worship, each having a Garland of Roses in their hand, which they seem'd to tell over, muttering Prayers, as we our Beads, fell foul, and railing bitterly at them, as profane, irreligious Fellows (though they might perceive by their Habits they were Stran∣gers) that durst presume to pass by, and not entering, pay there their due Devotions. How they carry themselves before their drowning.Also Gasper Villela, in his Letter from Saccai, dated Anno 1562. relates, that he saw several of these wilful Murders, which he thus sets down: The Japanners (says he) when they are heated with a frantick Zeal, raging to be delivered from this vale of misery, and be suddenly transplanted to Eternal Happi∣ness, which they believe to be in the bottom of the Sea, or else in some Subterranean world, where those gods reside, that dispence eternal rewards and everlasting happiness, for transi∣tory merits in this mortal life: First they get up upon a Bench or Form, the better to be heard, where they Preach and Inculcate against the short and uncertain Pleasures of this World, and how the best of Earthly joyes are mingled and imbitter'd always with grief and sorrow, and that so short and uncertain a Life to be taken away oftentimes on a sudden, without any warning, were better to make a resignation of, than to be snatch'd away at pleasure of those that gave it; This being the Theme or Argument which they always insist upon, there they and others keep commiserating people, being in a manner as frantick as they, bestowing great Alms upon them, and have always an audience thronging about them. The last day, for to close up all, they make their Rehearsal of all the Sermons, being a Repetition of what they formerly deliver'd; which done, they drink off a chearing Bowl of lusty Liquor; then dres∣sing themselves up in their best Habits, stuffing their wide Sleeves with Stones, and hanging weights of Iron about their Necks, they enter the Boat, in which they lay a sharp Scythe, for to Mow off, as we said before, the Thorns and Briars which grow in the way to Bliss. I saw (says Villela, in his foremention'd Letter) one that had seven Associates, which did all throw themselves into the Sea, with like joy, as at the Celebration of a Marriage, that I stood astonish'd with admiration. Jamam-Buxen converse with evil SpiritsMoreover, the Japanners are much inclin'd to Sorcery and Witchcraft, the chiefest pretenders to that Art, they call Jamam-buxen, that is, Souldiers, or Knights of the Round Valley, which they believe have familiarity with Evil Spirits. These Sectaries, to purchase fame of Zeal and Piety, watch, never letting their Eye-lids close in two, nay, sometimes three days and nights together, ta∣king small sustenance, whilest they seem to do wonders, that is, removing in a dexterous manner, by such their Diabolical Arts, Bodies from their Graves, none knowing how,Strange actions. or when they were carry'd thence. Nay, more by confederacy, they will seem to raise the dead, and having some who lye stiff before them, like bodies laid out, that at a certain word in their Imprecations start up alive, and when these by their Disciplining, Fasting, and Watching three Moneths to∣gether, have thus Massarated themselves, they invite some of their intima∣test Friends with them, so going aboard their Vessel, fitted for that purpose,
sink and drown themselves all joyfully and lovingly together.Drown themselves. Why the Japanners ear no manner of death.But nothing more their Religion prompts them to, than a sleighting scorn of all the Terrors and Pangs of Death, looking upon those that shrink at such fears, as Vulgar and Ignoble Persons, not fit to be convers'd withal, because they all believe, that Death is the certain way to Happiness; which Opinion hath been anciently receiv'd in Japan, and very old in many other places, espe∣cially amongst the Gauls, Brittains, and Germanes, and several other Nations, That the Souls of those that fear'd not Death, whether offering themselves for the publick good, or the honor of their gods, should immediately so dying, be translated into Paradice. Strange self-murder of the Goths, Herods. lib. 4.¶ HErodotus says, That the Goths, held for the valliantest amongst the Thracians, believe themselves immortal, and that they never die, but leaving this world, they go to their God Zamolxis, upon which account, every fifth year by Lot they choose an Am∣bassador, whom they send to this their God-amighty in such manner as followeth; First, Having well instructed him in his Message, and made fit for so honorable an Embassy, then they lift him up by the Arms and Legs, placing under him three Arrows, with the barbs up∣wards, which done, they let him drop upon the Points, by which, if he be so well transpierc'd that he dies suddenly, then they believe that they have made a good choice, but if so it happen that the sharps missing the Vitals, he die a lingering death, they judge him to be a vi∣cious liver, and not fit for the undertaking; so presently go to a second Choice, giving him the like Instructions. The Grave Philosopher Seneca also hints thus concerning the Immorta∣lity of the Soul, When the time comes that separates the Soul and Body, leaving the Material Substance on the Earth, the Spirit reascends to God the Donor. Then also he makes the Soul thus a Speaker; Now free from Earth, I dwell in the Air, or Ethe∣rial Sky. This his Description of Dying and leaving this Mortal Life, sig∣nifies his Opinion of a better and Immortal Residence. We must remove, (says he) for death which we fear, destroys us not, but gives us another and a happier Life, which hereafter, we shall assuredly know, and rejoyce at our so blessed a change. This Doctrine of a second Life, though wanting the pure light of the Gos∣pel, most of the antient Heathens believ'd, of which our Western and Eastern World have given notable Testimonies. Strabo tells us, That one Mandanis a Brachman,Strabo lib. 15 Geograph. being presented to Alexander the Great, and he Courting him with fair Promises, and rich Presents to be as his Com∣panion and Councellor, look'd upon him, though he had Conquer'd the whole World, as a con∣temptible Fellow, he being fully satisfi'd from their own Principles of future Hopes,Disputes of the old Brach∣mans concerning the e, and after death. for his Just and Meritorious Life, to receive the great Rewards of Everlasting Beatitude, said, O Alexander, I despise your Gifts, neither need I any,The saying of Mandanis. to receive them from one that is poorer than he that is in the greatest want; being hungry, and still unsatisfi'd with all the Plunder and Spoil which thou hast got. Neither fear I your threats, since I by dying, already worn out by Age, shall remove to a far better and happier life than thou canst expect in the World which thou hast here unjustly gotten, or in the World to come. Cicero de Dvinat po. Calamus the Indian burns himself.Cicero also tells of the Indian Calamus, Who making a fire under a Gilded Bed, cover∣ing himself over with Straw, kindled the same, and so by degrees felt the extremest of all tortures, burning to death; a brave and noble departure (as he says) out of this World; the day of whose death, Alexander the Great appointed to be kept holy, and not long after he follow'd him. Next he tells us of Hercules, who with conjesting Trees, which he had him∣self torn up by the roots, erected his own Funeral Pyre, where laying himself
down, and there consum'd to Ashes the greatest of Hero's, they after his mag∣nanimous departure, reckon'd him among the number of Gods. ¶ FUrthermore, as to what was said before by the Japan Interpreter con∣cerning the vanishing of one of the Bonzi, which annually meet in the Castle on the Mountain Conay,The Bouzies are often car∣ry'd away none know whe∣ther. the like happens (as they say) in several other meetings, in which some of them vanish from thence, or are snatch'd away, how and by what means we know not. Villela relates in his foremention'd Letter, That this Romance, or Hocus-Pocus of conveying bodies, is generally believ'd to be real amongst the Japan∣ners, but always lookt upon as a bad Omen: And in his time, he says, there dwelt one of the Bonzi in the City Sacci, who being very rich, liv'd as vicious a life, and being seventy years old, lying on his death-bed, could not endure to hear of death; but one day, at high noon, he was taken away on a sudden in the presence of all his friends, and was never heard of after. The Netherland Ambassadors leaving the Palace of the Bonzi,Village Cancia. they Rode to∣wards the Village Cancia, where they rested that night; in the morning, the Ways being frozen very hard, they went on in their Journey, and in a short time they reach'd the swift Current Oyengauwa,River Oyengauwa. which they crost very easily, be∣cause it had not Rain'd there in a long time, for in wet seasons, the Floods are so high, and the Current so strong, that none can pass it but with great trouble. There the Emperors Faul∣koners met the Ambassa∣dors.Stepping on the opposite shore, they spy'd three of their Emperors Faul∣koners after their Game, the Ambassadors Sedans, in honor to the Emperor, were set down on the ground, the Horsemen alighted, and the whole Train stood still, till the Faulkoners were past by them: Then travelling through the Villages Simanda, Torisjeda, and Ocambe, over several steep Ascents and Decli∣vings, they enter'd Mirice. Surunga, a great City, but ruinous and uninhabi∣ted.¶ SOmewhat farther, they came to Surunga, a great City, but desolate, be∣cause since the death of the Emperor Toxogunsama, who was Crown'd Anno 1629. the Inhabitants deserted it, resorting to other places for Trade. The Emperor taking some distastes against his Brother, forc'd him to rip up his own Belly; which cruel Execution they commit in the following manner: The manner of the Japan∣ners ripping up their own bellies.¶ THe Criminals sit according to the Eastern manner, in an open place before a Temple, being bare from the middle upwards; behind him stands one with a Cordial, if he should faint, and six Priests that give him Spiritual Comfort, and take care of his Funeral; before him sits one with the Knife that must perform the cruel Office; on each side at equal distance, stand twelve of his best Friends and nearest Relations; on both sides are great multitudes of Spectators. This cruel Execution is oftentimes inflicted upon many without any cause; for they judge those liable to the same punishment that have any Re∣lation to the Criminal. Francis Cairon tells us of a passage that happen'd about Jedo, during his resi∣dence there. A Noble Man commanding a Lordship of the Emperor, for∣ced his Tenants to pay him more Rent than the Emperor had order'd; by which means he inrich'd himself: But the people not being able to bear the burthen any longer, they joyn'd together and went to the Council, com∣plaining of the Lord of their Manor, which they strictly examining he was
found Guilty, and Condemn'd with all his Family to be their own Execu∣tioners, ripping open their own Bellies. He had a Brother a Servant to the King of Fingo, two hundred forty seven Leagues distant to the Westward from Jedo: an Unkle in Satsuma, twenty Miles farther: a Son by King Co∣nocoumy: a second Son, who dwelt Eastward from Jedo, one hundred and ten Leagues, serving the King of Massama: his third Son, in the Imperial Ca∣stle Inquano: his youngest Son being Marry'd to a wealthy Merchants Daugh∣ter in Osacca. Two of his Brothers being of the Emperors Life-Guard. All these were forc'd in one day and hour, for their Brother or Fathers foremen∣tion'd offence, in a miserable manner, to rip up their own Bowels. The manner of cutting their bellies.Which Executioners work is perform'd thus: First, they cast up how ma∣ny hours it may be ere the Messenger of Death brings the sad news to their re∣motest Relations; which being the utmost time, appointed no Reprieve be∣yond, both the nearest and farthest on one day, and just at noon, obeying the strict sentence, they become their own cruel destroyers. But one of them, a Merchant in Osacco, prevented self-slaughter, being struck with so great a terror, that he dy'd immediately after the tidings; and his one∣ly Daughter, who would have made her self away, though not Condemned, had she not been carefully look'd after, starving her self, dy'd on the eleventh day: But how the Women escap'd in these destroyings of Families, he is si∣lent in. ¶ CAsper Villela in his Letter from Firando, dated the 13 of October 1557. says thus concerning this manner of punishment:Those that are to be ript open have two choices left them, either to cut their bellies, or fight to death. When the King Condemns any to this Execution, he sends a Messenger to him, who acquaints him with the day on which he must die, the Condemned Person never flinches nor seeks to make an escape, but humbly requests that the King would be so pleas'd, that he himself might perform his Maje∣sties Command, which if granted, he takes for the greatest honor which at that time he is ca∣pable of. At the appointed hour, he attires himself in his best Rayment, and so rips up his
own Bowels; but if the King order his Death by the common Execution, then he puts him∣self in a posture of defence, guarding his House with his Children, Friends, and Servants; the King's Officers coming at the expected hour with a strong Party, begin the Assault and Battel, with discharging of Arrows; then drawing nearer, they come to pushing of Pikes, and chosing up with their Swords, entring, (the Kings Party being always too strong) cru∣elly massacres him and his whole Family: and the rest of his Relations that were not there, nor engag'd, are all stigmatiz'd with a hot Iron. This severe Law neither exempts the highest nor the lowest, but Lords and Peasants, Citizens and Soldiers, suffer thus without mercy all alike. This false Witnesses have, or any that are taken in a Lye before a Magistrate, inflicted upon them, insomuch that most Punishments amongst the Japanners are san∣guinary. The Kings that are convicted of speaking Treason against the Em∣peror, are onely banish'd to Faitsinchina. Description of the Faitsinchina.¶ THis Faitsinchina is a small Isle, about a League in circumference, ly∣ing Easterly from Jedo to the Offin, fourteen Leagues; whose Cliffy Borders are so steep, and the Sea fathomless, that they want Cable to Anchor there; so that no Vessel can come near the Shore safe, but after this manner: When the Weather is calm, and the Water smooth, they venture in small Ves∣sels, who drawing near the Rocks, some of the boldest and activ'st of them ty∣ing Cords about their Middle, leap from their Vessel, lighting among the Cliffs, not without great danger, and climbing to the top where they have Crains, or the like Engines planted for that purpose; with which they hoist up their Vessels some Fathoms above the Water,A strange contrivance to preserve Ships. so that they impend in the Air, where they seem as at safe Anchor, being free from the beatings of Waves and Weather, which else would immediately bilge them upon the un∣hospitable Shore, where many were lost ere this Invention was found. This spot of Ground is for the most part barren, little of the Isle fit for Cultrature, boasting onely a few Mulberry-Trees. Banishment of Japan Kings.Here the greatest Persons suffer under Exile, where without all hope of any return, or ever to be redeem'd, they live in a miserable condition; for in every angle of the Isle stands a strong Tower, where Souldiers keep Watch and Ward; which Monethly, if Wind and Weather serve, are reliev'd; nor are they longer to remain, lest by their continuance they may grow acquainted with the Royal Prisoners, and be inveigl'd by Bribes, or otherwise to help, or at least connive at their escape. These, though Kings, have no Princely Fare, onely a little Rice, Roots of Trees, wild Herbs, and some other unsavory Food, which they cook them∣selves: and that which adds more to their misery, is bad Drink, and unwhol∣som Water. Their Houses are onely poor Huts, too sleight Defences to keep out Wind and Weather: And also they are set hard Tasks, to Spin and Weave so many Pieces of Silk yearly, the Growth of the Place, their own Silk-worms furnishing them with Materials. The Emperor's Court was formerly in Surunga.But our Ambassadors stay'd not long in Surunga, where formerly the Japan Emperors used to keep their Court, and afterwards the Emperor's Brother; but since Toxogansama's Brother ript up his own Bowels, they remov'd the Court from thence: which was the chief occasion of the deserting and desola∣tion of this City; for most of the Inhabitants went from thence to settle in other Places.
The City is much ruin'd.On one side of the City stands a large Castle, whose Ruines manifest suffici∣ently its former greatness and splendor. The Metherland Ambas∣sadors enter Jesare, and find there an antient Man, who told them that Spex had formerly been there.¶ LEaving Surunga, they travell'd to the Village Jesare, where they Lodg'd all Night. Here they found an old Man, who told them that the Ambassador Jacob Spex, thirty years before their arrival, Lodg'd in his House, passing through that Village in his Journey to Jedo, after he had presented the Emperor Goysssio Samma with several things, and treated with him about permitting the Hollan∣ders to Trade in Japan. Spex's Journey from Meaco to Surungo and Jedo.Ambassador Spex entring Meaco the tenth of August Anno 1611. receiv'd ten of the Emperor's Horses, and a Present from the Governor Itakara Froymondonne; thence Riding on seven Leagues farther, he rested one Night in Cusatz; the next Day Dining in Sutsifama Sutsifamme: in the Evening he arriv'd at Sesqui∣noso, travelling from thence the next Morning to Jokeitz; and Ferrying over the Bay which washes Mia, about Sun-set (having that day suffer'd much by the extreme heat of the Sun, insomuch, that one of his Train died thereof by the way) they entred Naromi, where he order'd him to be interr'd: Then Riding through Occosacca to Josinda, they posted to Futsigeda and Merico, and towards Evening came to Surunga. Makes his arrival known in Surunga.The arrival of the Netherlands Ambassadors, Spex and Peter Segerszoon, was immediately made known to the chief of his Imperial Majesty's Council, being Cosequidonne, and Ikoto Siosabrandonne, with entreaties that they might be permitted, so soon as possible, to the Presence and Audience of the Emperor. The Ambas∣sadors receiv'd in answer, That they were heartily welcom from so far a Coun∣trey, and troublesom a Way, through which they had travell'd thither; and without all peradventure their arrival would be very acceptable to the Empe∣ror: to which end they would prepare all things in readiness against the next Morning for their Audience. Which Cosequidonne perform'd, bringing the Ne∣therlanders the next Day to the Imperial Palace, but could not be admitted, the Emperor being busied, receiving and looking over some grand Accounts of his Vice-Roys, so that they were forc'd to stay and wait his leisure. What happen'd to the Portuguese Ambassador be∣fore the Emperor.Where whilst they tarried, they nnderstood something of the business of the Spanish Ambassador, who had been newly dispatch'd from thence before their coming, who had first address'd himself in Person, and afterward in Wri∣ting to his Majesties chief Councellor Cosequidonne; and when he was presented to the Emperor, humbly he laid his Presents down before him on his Throne near his Footstool, being ten Pieces of Cloth of Gold Tissue, a Golden Bowl, and a Watch, which the Emperor receiv'd; but the Ambassador (his Majesty not replying a word in answer to his Addresses) was commanded to with∣draw: notwithstanding he entred the Court with a stately Train, he himself richly Habited, wearing a Gold Chain about his Neck. His business to the Emperor was to excuse the death of the Japanners, three years before condemn'd to die at Maccau; also to make a Complaint of a great Spanish Carvil burnt at Nangesaque; by which some lost above ten hundred thousand Ducats, laying the whole blame upon the Emperors Officers there.The Emperor's Answer. Soon after the Great Mi∣nister of State, Cosequidonne, answer'd him, That the Sea-men, and chiefly the Captain and his Officers, refus'd to take any Cognisance, or give them any an∣swer in point of satisfaction concerning the inhumane Murder of his Imperi∣al Majesties Subjects in Maccau, which plainly evidenc'd, that where they
were able, they minded neither Right nor Justice, but did then, and would here∣after when they could, carry all other Transactions before them by force and violence; and that the Captains surly and stubborn answers, so opposite to the Laws of all Nations, shewing such a sleight respect to his Imperial Majesties Demands, without granting the least redress, forc'd his Majesty to take satisfa∣ction by retaliation; therefore where the Sword of Justice would not reach, he made up his Audits by Fire, burning their Ship. Errors committed by the Castilian Ambassador be∣fore the Emperor.Many Errors did the Spaniard commit in this his Embassy: first in visiting the young Prince at Jedo before the Emperor; then entring the City Surunga, with forty Musqueteers, and flourishing the Spanish Colours, firing his Musquets, sounding Trumpets, and beating of Drums at the end of every Street: The like folly he committed in his Speech to the Emperor, making these four Propositions: First, That the Castilians should have free liberty, according to their manner, in any or all of his Majesties Ports and Harbors. Secondly, To Trade in all Maritim Parts of his Empire. Thirdly, That the Emperor should absolutely prohibit the Hollanders from trafficking in any of his Dominions; to which purpose his Royal Master, the King of Spain, would be ready with a strong Fleet to joyn in his Assistance, utterly to drive them from his Imperial Territories. Lastly, That the Castilians should not by any of his Subjects be obstructed in their Trade, but to have egress and regress to what Towns and Markets soever, to sell their own, and buy the Countrey Commodities. These were the Proposals he deliver'd first by word of Mouth, and afterwards in Writing, waiting five days in Surunga ere he deliver'd this his Message to the Emperor; and before he went away, the Gifts which he had presented to the Minister of State Cosequidonne, were returne'd. Spex and Segerszoon are appointed to come before the Emperor.But whilst the Ambassadors, Spex and Segerszoon, attended some hours in the Court; Cosequidonne sent them word, That the Emperor could not give them Audience that day, he being busie about other Dispatches, but to morrow he would use his utmost endeavor to bring them to a Hearing; so the following part of the day the Ambassadors spent in addressing themselves to the High Treasurer Ohoto Sionsabradonne, a Person lookt very much upon, for his great Prudence,Presents given by Spex to the Emperors Privy-Council. Affability, and his endearing Conversation; whom they presented with whole Pieces of Scarlet, fine Damask-Linnen, and seve∣ral other Stuffs, with many curious Flasks, a Carbyne and a Powder-horn, which he accepted, shewing great civility and kindness, proffering them his assistance in what ere he could; and the rather, because he had lately heard (as he said,) that a Peace was concluded betwixt the King of Spain and the United Provinces for twelve years; for before, the Hollanders in time of War, lookt more after Spanish Prizes, then full freighting of their Vessels with such Merchandise as was proper for their Countrey, which now he hop'd they would do. Moreover they visited also the chief Minister of State, Cosequi∣donne, to whom they presented Gifts no way inferior to the foremention'd, but he modestly refusing told them, That they must needs have had great trouble in bringing them so long and tedious a Voyage. Spex deals under-hand with Cosequidone.Enquiring of them the Concern of their business to the Emperor, they re∣ply'd first, That his Imperial Majesty would be graciously pleas'd to excuse the staying away of their Ships so long from Japan, and also an Answer upon the Emperor's Letter. The Reasons which they alledg'd thereto seem'd of so great consequence to Cosequidonne, that he undertook to deliver them himself to the Emperor, saying, He doubted not but that his Majesty would be very well satisfi'd with them: the Ambassadors answering. That thev did not in
the least question it. Cosequidonne also enquir'd of them what business else they came about; which they declaring, said, To entreat his Imperial Majesty, that he would be pleas'd to grant the two Letters Patents, whereby the Nether∣land Ships hereafter might be under the protection of the Emperor, and grant them liberty to drive a free Trade in all his Majesties Ports; and that they might unlade their Goods at Firando without Waiters or Overseers; and to shew their Commodities to the Merchants, always preserving such Rarities as the Emperor should fancy for Royal use: all which Cosequidonne, approved of, not doubting but that the Emperor would grant their Desires: At last, dis∣coursing with them about some Affairs of the United Netherlands, he took his leave of the Ambassadors, promising them, that after Noon he would bring them to the Emperor's Presence. So having conducted them into the Street, one William Adams, President, and residing in Surunga for the Netherland East-India Company, being with him, was call'd back to take the Presents,Cosequidonne refuses the Ambassadors Presents. and re∣turn them with thanks to the Ambassadors, saying, That it was not his custom to receive any Gifts from Strangers. Having also refus'd the Presents made to him by the Spanish and Portuguese Ambassadors, nay all that ever were proffer'd to him by any Foreign Merchants. Moreover saying, The Ambassadors, Spex and Segerszoon need not doubt of his good will, for it would be neither more or less whether he kept the Presents, or return'd them again, onely it was not his custom. Whereupon William Adams reply'd, That it was no Present, but an antient use amongst the Netherlanders, to requite such grand favors as he had been pleas'd to shew them, and therefore humbly desir'd him to accept of them. Then inviting them again into his House he receive'd them, saying, He had done more than ever he had heretofore, it being a thing quite contrary to his Nature. Here Spex and Segers∣zoon appear with their Pre∣sents before the Emperor.In the Afternoon, according to Cosequidonne's promise, they were admitted to the Emperor's Presence: where, upon a Table, they laid their Gifts, being several Pieces of Scarlet and Crimson-colour'd Cloth, black Flannel, Crimson-colour'd Kersies, Water'd Camlets, Sattin wrought with Gold, fine Damask Linnen, Nurenburg Carpets, curious Flasks, several Pounds of Lead, a French Fewsie eight Foot long, two hundred Pieces of Steel, two Carbynes, and as ma∣ny Powder-horns, and five Elephants Teeth. His Discourse with them.After they had made their Obeysance before the Emperor, his Imperial Majesty bidding them welcome, askt how many of their Countrey-men, being Soldiers, were in the Molucco Istands? If the Netherlanders Traded to Borneo? If the best Camphire was to be had there, and how it was got? Where the choi∣cest Aula and Calamba were to be found? If any sweet-scented Wood grew in Holland? What sort yielded the best Price? How they were enter∣tain'd after the Emperor had discoursed with them.To which Demands the Emperor by means of an Interpreter had respective Answers made him; where upon the Ambassadors withdrawing from the Pre∣sence, being led out by Cosequidonne, and Sionsabrondonne, who wish'd them joy of that unusual Honor and Friendliness which the Emperor had shewn them; the like he never did to the greatest of the Japan Kings, though they oftentimes bring Presents to him, to the value of thirty thousand Ducats: and also the Spa∣nish and Portuguese Ambassadors were dismissed without hearing the Emperor utter one word. William Adams being call'd back, he saw the Emperor busie in viewing the Presents, saying, I see these Hollanders are Masters both of Arts and Arms. The whole Negotiation of their Embassy they got translated into the Japan
Tongue, leaving the Schedule in the custody of their Patron Cosequidonne, to the end they might be the sooner dispatch'd at their return from Jedo, whether they were advis'd to go and visit the young Prince, the Emperor's eldest Son, which the Spanish Ambassadors (as we said before) had done. Depart for Jedo.On the eighteenth of August, Anno 1611, they set forward; to which purpose Cosequidonne procur'd them the Emperor's Pass, with ten Horses, and a Manda∣tory Letter, to will and require all his good Subjeds to help them with all Necessaries, and ever else they had need of in their Journey; and also Letters to his Son, then waiting upon the Prince at Jedo: But in their first days Journey there happen'd such a Tempest of Thunder, Lightning, and Rain, that they were necessitated to fall short, and, take up their Lodgings in Jesare; being the same Village, and the same House, where the Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst, Anno 1649, the twenty seventh of December, were enter∣tain'd in. The next morning setting forward, whilst the Wind blew hard and cold, they went through the Village Okis, and a little Grove, and also through Jui, passing over several Streams. The Way from Jui lies along the Shore of a Bay,A strange Rock. near a Mountain; where in one Place going over a steep Rock, the Tract was not above two Foot broad, having an amazing Precipice on one side, and Towry Cliffs on the other; the Sea always roaring, with thundring Billows breaking against it; the Ways beyond also difficult and troublesom, full of Salt-pits,Japan Salt-pits. the more dangerous, being digg'd after their Countrey manner, where the Japanners make their greatest store. Description of the mise∣rable condition of the La∣zers in Japan.On both sides of the Ways in some Places, behind the Towns and Villages, appear scatter'd Huts, rais'd up with Pleited Rushes, and Roof'd with clinch'd Planks; in which are confin'd poor Lepers, which live in a miserable conditi∣on, their whole Utensils, or Houshold-stuff, being a Bag, or a Basket; yet some have a Bolster, or little Pillow, which is to them a Bed: Before their Door, in stead of a Bell, hangs an old Bason, which they beat upon when Travellers pass by, so craving their Charity and Alms, which falling short, they many times suffer the extremity of Hunger, not being permitted to ap∣proach near any Town, Village, or any Place frequented by People, upon pain of Death, because their Leprosie is no less catching than incurable: thus being banish'd from all society but themselves, they linger out their wretched and contemptible Lives. It seems that this Disease reigns more in the Eastern Countreys than in the Northern. Herodotus tells us, that the Persians suffer not any Communication with those that are struck with Leprosie, accounting that this infliction falls upon them for some horrid Sin, and foul Impiety; but more especially for some hainous Offence committed against the Majesty of the Sun. From Jui they pass'd through the Village Cambaro, to the swift Streams of Fusikaw. Mountain Fusinojamma.Here they saw Mount Fusinojamma, where the Horses were unsadled, and their Goods put into small Vessels: a considerable time they spent thus in crossing the River, so that it was Noon before they reach'd the Village Jussiwarra: where whilst they were at Dinner they were told by the Inhabitants, That the Hill Fusinojamma, which they saw in their Way, rising so high into a Spire, might be discern'd thirty Leagues off, its lofty Crown always cover'd with Snow;Janambuxi, a sort of Japan Priests. and how that some Mountain-Priests, which they call Janambuxi, once a year travel thither, spending eight hours in climbing to the top, and often
three thousand in a Company; where tarrying sixty Days, they masserated themselves with Fasting, and all manner of Hardships: And whilst they thus afflict themselves in their damn'd Devotion, the Devil, as they say, ap∣pears to them in a horrible manner. After this terrible Apparition of their god and Master, in four hours they joyfully descend the Hill, supposing they have perform'd an act of wondrous merit; and soon after they are advan∣ced to the Order of the Janambuxi, which they signifie by white Knots hang∣ing about their Necks,Their Habit. and a little black Cap onely covering the Crown of their Heads, their Hair beneath being Curl'd. Thus distinguish'd, they range over all the Empire, carrying in their Hands a Copper Bason, which they Tinckle, to intimate their coming. Thus in all Places they Offer their Ser∣vice, which is to Conjure for stoln Goods, which thus they perform: How they find out stoln Goods.They take a Boy that is is but a Stripling, and set him on the bare Ground cross-Legg'd; then they call upon their Master, their black god, the Devil, with distracted mutterings, thundring loud Charms, and horrible Im∣precations, That he would be graciously pleas'd to enter and possess the Child, that from thence, as from an Oracle, they might, have a Response to their Question: Whereupon soon after, as they relate, the Youth suddenly begins to froth and foam at the Mouth, rowling and gogling his Eyes, skrew∣ing his Neck and Body into hideous Postures, like Convulsion-fits; then by these signs knowing the Boy to be possess'd, he asks where the Goods missing are? Whether lost or stoln? Which way they went? and, Where to be found? Whereupon the Boy answers directly, giving them an account what became of them, and how they shall be recover'd. The Priests call'd Ja∣nambuxi are sent for to the Sick.Besides these Janambuxi, there are another sort of Mountain-Priests, which haunt and frequent solitary Villages and Towns; whose Office is to visit the Sick, when they are sent for, by whose Bed-sides they sit Night and Day, mut∣tering strange Words and Incantations, which none there understands; and the harder, because all Expressions belonging to Religion, have a distinct Di∣alect
by it self, and in Writing, a more difficult Character than any other. Hendrick Hagenaer a Hollander, says, That he hath himself seen several of these Jam∣maboos, wearing a long Cord, with white Bobs like Buttons, about their Necks; rolling their Eyes, and distorting their Faces, in a wonderful manner. A Strange Accident that hapned to a Jammaboos.During the said Hagenaer's Residence there, it hapned that a Sick Person sent for one of these Jammaboos, who according to their manner, spent a consi∣derable time in muttering or reading to himself; and whilst he was thus ear∣nest in his Devotion, he, and those that were there present, seeing no Mouth open,This is a common trick of those that can speak in their Bellies. nor any Lips stir, heard a Voyce, saying, Why do you molest me? I brought not this Sickness upon the Diseased: I am but a Minister, that am sent from your Enemy with this Distemper: First appease and satisfie him, and I have done, and shall trouble him no more. The strange Language us'd in the Japan Religion, from whence extracted.That which is said concerning the Jammaboos using a peculiar Dialect in Matters of Religion, to the end they may not be understood by the Common sort of People, it is certainly believ'd, That they have borrow'd the same from the ancient Celtian Druydes, who brought this Practice first from the Gothes, a People inhabiting Ascania (being Swedland, Norway, and Schoonen) who long before, under their Commander Taunasis, to mend their colder Quarters, broke into Aegypt, where they slew the King of that Countrey Vesofis, after that run∣ning over a great part of Asia, and fought several Battels with the Persian Mo∣narchs Xerxes, Cyrus, and Darius, not fearing to ingage Alexander the Great; so making their way by the Sword to India and China. Thus these Druydes, their Northern Priests, grew familiar with the Indian Brachmans, and they with the Japan Bonzies,Laertius vit a Phil. Studying each others Doctrine. Diogenes Laertius relates, That the Indian Gymnosophists and Druydes always taught in obscure and mysterious Dia∣lects, admonishing their People in the first place to honor the Gods, to do nothing that is base and wicked, and to contemn their Life, being call'd to Service of their King and Countrey. Pomp Mel. In Geogr.Pomponius Mela says, That the Druydes instruct and teach their Disciples their whole Doctrines in private, divulging onely to the Common People the Immortality of the Soul; which Science they are bound by an Oath to keep secret. Seldinius tells in what Words they Swear, which are these: I charge you by the Circle of the Sacred Sun, the un∣constant Motions of the Moon, and by the Power and Influence of all other Celestial Lumi∣naries, That you never make known to the Vulgar what I shall inform you withal; nor ever forget your Master, nor the Benefits you have receiv'd from him: And in so do∣ing, the Gods will not onely defend you, but grant also what-ever you shall desire. But those that break this Sacred Oath, the Gods will cast them out of their Possession, and in stead of Blessings, will overwhelm them with all sorts of Miseries and Misfortunes, and an unhappy end. Xaverius affirms this, saying, That a Brachman Youth and he being alone together, told him, That his Master, before he would instruct them in his Do∣ctrine, made them take the foremention'd Oath, binding them never to discover those things which he should teach them. Moreover, concerning the Druydes manner of Instructing their Youth, Caesar relates thus:Cas Bell. Gall 7. They learn them (says he) divers Verses, which they keep in me∣mory, some spending twenty Years in the right understanding and expression thereof; judg∣ing it not lawful to write them down, but thus to be preserv'd by Tradition. He says also, That they use a Greek Character. The Druydes, Brachmans, and Benzi, generally agree.And whereas the Jammaboos use a peculiar Dialect in Matters of Religion, far different from their common Language; the like Custom had the Druydes in former times: For besides their Teutonick, which was the general Tongue of all those Northern Nations, speaking about Divine and Philosophical
Matters, they us'd the Runian Tongue,Runian Tongue, what kind. strangely different from their Vulgar Language. Description of the Har∣bore-Bonzi.¶ THe Japanners that belong to the Groves, or Forest-Priests, also range all over the Countrey in great Companies. These Itinerary Mini∣sters they call Harbore-Bonzi, which ran after the Netherland-Ambassadors, cra∣ving Alms: But for the most part they reside in Woods, and dark Recesses under Ground, by which they are so overgrown, and look so strangely shabby with Clotted and Elf-lock'd Hair hanging down over their Shoulders, matted and unkemb'd Beards, that Strangers are often afrighted at the sight. Their Caps, being round, are made of pleited Rushes; on the top they wear a Tuft of a Black Horses Taylor Mane; about their Middle, a Girdle stuff'd with Cotton: Their upper Coat also of Cotton, with short Sleeves: The under Garment, or Vest, of Deer-skins; a Bag hanging by ten Strings at their Girdle: In their Left-hand they carry a large Staff, lopp'd from the Setang, a Tree bearing Fruit like our Medlars: Their Shoes they fasten by tying them round about their Ancles with Leather-Thongs; the Soles have four Nails dri∣ven in them, with such broad Heads, that when many walk together, they make a noise like a Troop of Horse. At the thirtieth Year of their Age, they begin to Study Necromancy. Gengues, or Soothsayers.¶ THe Ambassadors also met with another sort of Juggling Wizards or Fortune-tellers, call'd Gengues, who pretend to discover Thieves and Stoln Goods. These People dwell in small Huts on the tops of Hills. They are scarce to be distinguish'd from one another by their Faces, being so much Weather-beaten, never hiding them from the heat of the Sun, Cold, Hall, Rain, or Wind; but going continually bare. Marriage is permitted amongst them, provided they take one of their own Sect, and Family of the Gengues. Furthermore, What is written concerning these Conjurers, by Father Lodo∣wick
Frojus, in his Letter from Meaco, dated February 26. Anno 1565. I shall here recite; but leave the Reader to his choice of believing or rejecting it. The Gengues (says he) have a Horn growing upon their Heads;A strange Relation of the Gengues, by Father Frojus. whom their Master the Devil oftentimes commands to climb to the top of a steep Mountain, where they are to ex∣pect him at the appointed time: Thither they flock in great Numbers; and coming to the Place, the Evil Spirit, according to his Promise, appears to them about Noon, but most com∣monly towards the Evening, passing oftentimes backward and forward through the whole Assembly of the Gengues; who soon after, inspir'd with mad desire to follow this their wicked Seducer where-ever he goes (though through Fire and Brimstone) where he vanishes they throw themselves after, which is always at the steep Precipices of the Mountain; thus desperately destroying themselves, falling down Headlong: Which thus happen'd to be dis∣cover'd. An Old-Man being thus Possess'd, and mad to follow the Devil, his Son used all means to disswade him; yet he would not hearken, but thither he went, his Son going with him; then both scaling the top of the Mountain, the Spirit appear'd to them, Habited Richly, like some Great Person, whom the Father Worshipp'd, falling on his Knees in a most sub∣missive and humble manner; but the Son, drawing his Bow, shot at the Spectrum, which suddenly vanishing, turn'd into a wounded Fox; which running away, he trac'd by the drops of Bloud discolouring the Grass, where on the edge of the Precipice Reynard vanish'd; but he looking down after him, saw abundance of Bones, and Skeletons of Dead-men, which there broke their Necks, so conquering Hell by violence, running headlong to the Devil. Japan Soothsayings and Conjurings, whence pro∣ceeded.But the fore-mention'd Charms and Conjurations, Fortune-telling, and other Diabolical Arts, used by the Japan Janambuxi, Jammaboos, Harbore-Bonzi, and Gengues, have their Original from Asia: The Japanners have learn'd these Ne∣cromantick Arts and cunning Delusions from their Ancestors, which brought them from the Places of their first Original. Above two thousand Years ago, the Black-Art was us'd through all the Eastern World, being perform'd after di∣vers ways and manners. Who knows not, That in Asia they use, for the per∣forming of the foremention'd purposes, Water, Drinking, and Looking-glas∣ses, Oyl, Rings, Fire, Children, and Birds? What was more common to those that would know Future Events, or re∣gain Lost or Stoln Goods, than to run to the Conjurers or Fortune-tellers; which Office the Priest generally perform'd?Conjuring with a Bason. Sometimes they us'd a Bason full of Water, in which they threw several Pieces of Gold and Silver, and also Precious Stones, mark'd with peculiar Letters: Then standing over this Ba∣son, muttering their Charms and Incantations, calling upon an Infernal Spi∣rit, at last asking what they desir'd to know; and according to his Demands, a Voyce, as it were from under the Water, made Responses to his several Questions. With a Cruse.At other times these Jugglers also use a Cruse, filling it with clear Water, and placing lighted Wax-Candles round about: Then calling upon Satan, they inquir'd of him concerning those things of which they desir'd to be satis∣fied: Then standing still, a Child or great-bellied Woman went to the charm'd Cruse, so taking a view of the Shadow which the Water presented, by which Appearance the Spirit answer'd their Desires. With Glasses.Looking-glasses also serv'd them as Instruments to the performing of their Diabolical Arts,Glasses a known Cheat. wherein, after they had ended their Charmes, they saw such Shadows, by which they were answer'd to their several Demands. The Em∣peror Didius Julianus us'd the like Glasses,Julian the Apostate. seeing several things in them that hap∣pen'd to him afterwards.
With Fountains.The Greek Writer Pausanius tells us of a Fountain before the Temple of the Goddess Ceres, in which Fountain by a small Cord they us'd to let down a Looking-glass, wherein if those that were Sick did look, and saw a Dead Corps, there was no hopes of their Recovery; but if a live Person, they were certain to live and recover. With Oyl and Red-lead.When they are desirous to know Future Events, then they take Oyl, with some Red-lead, mixing them both together: Then they take a stripling Youth, painting his Nails therewith, and holding them in the Sun, which makes such Shadows, that by them they know what they desire. Wit a Gold Ring.They also take a Gold-Ring, and shaking it in the Water, judge by its Mo∣tion what they desire to be inform'd of. With Stones.Sometimes throwing three Stones in standing Water, by the manner and position of the Circles, they answer the Question propounded. With Water.Varro a Learned Roman, tells of a Youth skill'd in Magick, that in a Re∣sponse of a great Question, read fifty Verses out of the Water, foretelling (but in ambiguous sense) the various Successes of the long War betwixt the Romans and Mithridates King of Pontus. With Wheaten-Cakes.Near the Lacedemonian City Epidamnus, was a Pool sacred to Juno; to which, to be resolv'd of doubtful Matters, they us'd to resort, where they threw in Wheaten Cakes, made for that purpose; which if they sunk, were a good Omen; but if they floated up and down, they look'd thereon as a Sign of ill success. With a Pot.It was also very common to put a Roll upon their Heads, on which a Pot of Water; then muttering certain Words, if the Water boyl'd over, that sig∣nified good; but if it stirr'd not, bad luck. But discovering of Thieves, finding Lost or Stoln Goods, and the like, which the Japan-Priests, the Janambuxi and Gengues pretend so much to, was common two thousand Years ago through all Asia. Amonst many other of their Experiments, this was most us'd by the Ancients:With an Ax. They strike an Ax in∣to a round Post, so deep that it sticks; then amidst their Mutterings, they name the several Persons who are most suspected: but at the first mention of the guilty Person, the Ax trembles, or leaps out of the Post. With a Sieve.Our Foolery of the Sieve and Shears is also much approv'd amongst them, for a most certain Discovery of a Theft: And as we use for a Charm St. Peter and St. Paul, they repeat these non-sensical Words, Douwima, Touwima, Entimemaus. With an Asses Head.They also do Wonders, as they believe, with an Asses Head broyl'd upon the Coals: And the like Vanity, concerning Predictions, they observe with a Cock,With a Cock. which thus they perform: In a smooth Floor they lay so many single Letters, cut in Paper, that make up their Response with the Negative and Affirmative, laying on every one of these a Barley-corn, and scattering a few others pro∣miscuously betwixt them; then they bring a Cock fresh and fasting, who falls to work, picking up the Corns as his Choice directs him; which done, they gather up the Letters from whence the Corn hath been taken, and of those, by setting and spelling of them several ways, they make a Judgment. With Mandrakes.What did they not ascribe to the Mandrake-root, by throwing it into the Fire; and Meal-cakes?Vid Virgil, & Hemes. What Observations made not the Augurists out of the Flight and various Voyces of Birds? Others, of Howling of Wolves,With Birds. and Barking of Dogs, Swarming of Bees, Voyces in the Air, Numbers, Lots, and Dreams? Of Spirits, and imaginary Spectrums? Of their certainty of Future Fortunes, by Physiognomy and Palmistry? The appearing of Blazing Comets, and their Astrological Predictions, by the various Configurations of the Cele∣stial Bodies.
Who first found out Soothsaying and Conju∣ring.The Greeks having all their Learning from the East, say, That Zoroaster was the first of the Magi that studied and brought to light Magical Conclusions, whether Natural or Diabolical: For such and so abstruse were some of their Practices, that not being able to make out the Reason, most Ages have sup∣pos'd, That many of them have been perform'd by Demons and Cacademons, Evil Spirits; which after was brought by Osthanes (who follow'd Xerxes won∣derful Army) into Europe: Which Juggling Art Democritus describes at large, finding the Original Practices in Phenicia, Apollonica, Captidenes, and Dardanus: So that Antiquity concludes, That the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Persians, and other Eastern Countreys (under which we may reckon China and Tartary) were the first Soothsayers and Magicians: So that we need not wonder, that Japan at this day (continuing still under Idolatry) nurses great store of Sorcerers and Wizards, who without dispute came thither from China, the Place of their first Original. Netherland Ambassadors proceed in their Journey.¶ BUt the Netherland Ambassadors, Frisius and Brookhurst, having refresh'd themselves with a good Dinner, and delighted in hearing the strange Relation of the Japan-Priests call'd Janambuxi, who ascended the top of Fu∣sinojamma, they left the Village Jussiwarra, and rode along a Sandy-way through Farri. The Common Road being very dusty, they cross'd over to a Meadow wash'd by the Sea, which directed them to a great Village call'd Nomatz. Thence going on, they came to Missima, lying at the Foot of Mount Faccone. The Way that led thither was exceeding pleasant, both sides being shaded with Trees.Missima burnt. In this City, which was destroy'd by Fire but eight Months before, and since rebuilt in that time, the Ambassadors lodg'd one Night. Ambassadors hire fresh Horses.The next Morning they hir'd divers Horses to carry the Netherlanders and their Retinue over the Mountain Faccone: for their other Horses were much tired, and these fresh ones better us'd to Travel the craggy Paths of Faccone, being kept for that purpose. Thus fitted, about seven a clock they ascended the Mountain; and passing through several Villages, not without great trou∣ble and danger,The Village Faccone, of what kind. about Noon they enter'd Faccone, scituate near a Navigable River, on a Mountain, and surrounded by many others: The River destitute of Fish, is seventy and eighty Fathom deep, and in some Places ninety and a hundred. The Gate of Faccone, why so strong Guarded.After Dinner, they rode through a Gate at the end of the Village, which was Fortified by a Castle, where all Persons were stopp'd that were carried in Sedans, or rid on Horseback, except the Japan-Nobility: And on each side the Gate stands a Watch-house, with four Rooms being square and open; the Walls hung with Arms, being Muskets, Pikes, and Scymiters. The Soldiers fit on the Ground cross-legg'd.Description of the Japan Sentme's. They use a Game or Play among them, not unlike our Draughts, which requires great Leisure and Study: In this Exercise they spend much time in their fore-mention'd Watch-houses; or else they smoke Tobacco, exercise their Pikes, Fence with their Swords, or shoot at a Mark. At one end of the Watch-house hangs a great Lanthorn, with fine Painted Linnen, in stead of Glass or Horn: at the other end a Flag, with the Empe∣rors Arms, and those of the Governor of the Castle. At each end stands a Sentinel, one being Arm'd with a Musket, and the other with a Pike.
Strange manner of Notes to be bought for the De∣ceas'd.¶ MOreover, along the River, on whose Banks stands the Village Fac∣cone, are also three Temples of the Japan-Priests, to which they re∣pair from all parts of the Countrey, where for a small piece of Money, about the value of Three-pence, they buy a Ticket, which they stick upon the Stones that lie near the River; by which means, as they imagine, the Souls of their deceas'd Friends have free egress and regress to drink of the Water of the said River. THey also spend two days in August in Remembrance of Departed Souls, which thus they perform: Towards the Evening they light many Torches, being curiously painted;How the Japanners visit the Souls of the Deceas'd with Dishes of Meat, and other things. with which walking round about the Town or Village (some out of Zeal, and some as Spectators) when grown dark they proceed out of the City, where, as they fancy, and verily believe, they meet with the Departed Souls: Here, though they see nothing, they generally cry aloud, saying, Ah, welcome, welcome: Where have you been this long time? Where have you been? Sit down and refresh your selves; you must needs be weary and tired with such a Journey. Which said, they prepare a light Treatment of Rice, Fruits, and other Provisions; and the meaner sort of People bring warm Water, after they have been there an Hour, as if they had waited on them at their Collation; then making Excuses for their mean Fare, they invite the Deceas'd Souls to their Houses, saying, We will go before, and prepare your Lodgings, and provide better Cheer against your coming. Then two days being past, they all go out of the City with Torches, that so they may light the Souls of the Dead, to the end they should not stumble by the way; and after they have thus conducted them out, every one returns home, throwing Stones against, and chiefly on the tops of their Houses, to the end that none of the Souls may hide themselves; for if they stay longer than two days, they take it as an ill Omen. Moreover, they seem also to be very careful of them, fearing
that if they should stay behind, and go alone, they would easily lose their way to Paradise, or be destroy'd by Tempestuous Weather. Distance of the Japan-Paradise.¶ BEsides this their vain Folly of Entertaining the Dead, they reckon Para∣dise exactly to be Eleven hundred thousand Leagues (neither more or less) distant from them; which long Journey, the Souls, that are Aerial Bodies, finish in three Years time: Wherefore they set two days apart, bringing them Provisions, and entertaining them in their Houses, that so they may be re∣fresh'd, and the better able to proceed on in their Journey.Cleansing the Graves. At the same time also they make clean all the Graves, in which Office the Bonzis's assist them, but are well paid for their Labor. None, though never so poor, but will en∣deavor to get so much Money, as to pay their Priest for the cleansing of the Graves of his Deceas'd Friends and Relations. A dangerous way for the Netherland-Ambassadors.¶ THe Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst, parting from the Village Fac∣cone, soon after encounter'd with a steep and craggy Mountain, where getting to the top, they ran exceeding great hazard in descending the same, the Path not being above two Foot broad, and full of Stones, having a steep Hill rising on one side, and a Precepice on the other, that a weak-brain'd Person was not able to look down, without danger of being taken with a Dizziness; for one of the Ambassadors Train looking upon the Descent, was taken suddenly with a Vertigo, and so dropp'd over the Pummel of his Saddle, that he fell from his Horse, where he had miserably perish'd, but that holding fast by the Reyns, his Horse dragg'd him up, where he soon after recover'd;They enter the City Oudauro. and in the Evening they reach'd Oudauro, a stately City, one side thereof being adorn'd with a sumptuous Palace, surrounded with Stone Walls, having also many Spires, which are seen at a great distance. The Japanners re∣siding here relate,An Earthquake in Oudauro. That a few Years before a terrible Earthquake had shaken the Countrey exceedingly all thereabouts; besides what damage the People sustain'd by the loss of their Houses, Steeples, and Churches; also swallowing up a strong Castle; the Ground gaping very terribly, so devouring the Fort, and the Hill whereon it was rais'd, which stood in the same place where the new Castle is now built. It is no wonder in Japan, for whole Cities or Countreys to be swallow'd up; or turn'd topsie-turvey,A Japan City swallow'd up. and shuffled into Ruins and Rubbish. At the Foot of the Mountain Faccone stood formerly a famous City, which in few Hours, both Men, Beasts, and Buildings, was swallow'd up together in one destructi∣on; in place whereof, onely a great and almost fathomless Lake appear'd, by which the Netherland-Ambassadors pass'd. The Opinion of the Ja∣panners concerning Earth∣quakes.Concerning the Reason of these Earthquakes, or from whence they pro∣ceed, the Japanners themselves are of several Opinions. Most of them hold and affirm, That a great Sea-monster or Leviathan beats the Shore with his Tail, every blow of which shakes the Neighboring Countreys. The Ancient Greek and Latin Philosophers differ also much concerning the Reason of Earthquakes, which are the most terrible of all Humane Afflictions. Concerning which, hear Plato and Seneca, in their own Words; the first in his Athenian Antiquities:Plato in Timeo. A terrible Earthquake hapned, which a Day and a Night mov'd the Ground towards a Brook, which is now call'd the Mediterranean-Sea, in which were all your Ancestors swallow'd up,Sonec Nat. Quest. and also a whole Isle, then call'd Atlantis. Seneca saith, You see whole Countreys remov'd out of their Places; Main Continents divided into scatter'd
Isles: So the Sea also parted Calpe from Abile, Barbary from Spain, and likewise Sicily from Italy:As we hold England from France, Ireland om Wales. In our time several whole Countreys and Fields have been so shuf∣fled, that the Boundaries and Situations were never found again. This happens (says he) by Winds inclos'd in the Bowels of the Earth, which pen'd up like a Cholick, striving for vent, rumbling up and down, in getting passage, it not onely shakes but tears up the Su∣perficies. They say of old, That Ossa and Olympus were but one Mountain; but since divided, as now they stand, by an Earthquake. Moreover Pliny tells us,Plin. Lib. 1. cap. 91, 92. That the steep Mountain Cybotus, with the City Curite, and also the famous Cities Supylum and Tantalis in Magnesia, Galanis and Gamales in Phenicia, the Mountain Phegium in the Moors Countrey, the Cities Pyrha and Antissa in the Lake Meotis, Elice and Bura in the Corinthian Bay, were all drown'd and swallow'd in like manner. Pausa∣nius relates, That Elice and Bura sunk thirty seven Years before the Birth of Alexan∣der the Great. The Reasons of Earth∣quakes are adjug'd to be several.Also of the Cause of Earthquakes, the Variety and several Manners of its Aguish Fits, Writers differ much. Democritus tells us, That abundance of Rain soaking through the Crannies and Porous parts of the Earth, swelling its Belly like a Drop∣sie, rises and recoyls towards the Superficies, to disembogue it self; but wanting vent, beats, seeking a Passage against the upper Ground, which causes that Trepidation. Thales held, That the Earth being a floating Ball, danc'd upon the then more troubled Waters, the cause of its Shaking. But the more Modern Opinion, which seems most likely, is, That these Shakings of the Earth arise from a Sulphureous and Nitrous Matter, which either by Fermentation, or some other Accident, taking Fire in the Bowels of the Earth, blows up like the springing of a Mine; which sudden Bounce in like manner shakes all Parts about it, and opens the way, that in a Train it explodes other like Combusti∣ble Matter: And after, as many times it happens, it makes Breaches, whence Flashes of Fire breaking forth, tear the Surface of the Earth. The right opinion of Ari∣stotle concerning Earth∣quakes.The most Learned agree, That these Tremblings rather arise from imprison'd Winds in the vast Caverns of the Earth, whose former Passages being stopp'd by accidental falls of Earth, and Internal Ruins, seek a Vent else-where: Or whether it be that the Winds descending nearer the Center, finding no way back; or whether the thirsty Earth, being in Nature dry, sucks up abundance of Moysture, which either by Subterranean Heat, or the piercing Warmth of the Sun-beams, are rarified into more stirring Vapors, which wanting room for its Activity, breaks through the very Adamantine Dungeons of the Earth; which violent Ruptures shake the Superficies, being also torn and rent in like manner. Thus holds Aristotle also, demonstrating the same with several Philosophical Arguments, saying, and proving by Experience, That the greatest Earthquakes happen always in serene and calm Weather, which falls out in September and March, when commonly the Air is most turbulent; these Meteors seeming to have left the middle Re∣gion of the Air, and got into the middle Bowels of the Earth. Which he makes more apparent, saying, That the Earthquakes never cease, till the Winds break forth through the erupted Earth again: And that those Countreys that have most Excrescencies, being more Mountainous, and nearest the Sea, are oftner troubled with this dire and sad Infliction; whereas the Champaign and Inland Countreys scarce ever hear of a Terrene Trepidation. The differences of Earth∣quakes.Some Philosophers reckon up three sorts of Earthquakes; others seven. The first is, That the Earth tosseth like a Boat upon the Sea, which subvert∣ing, quite overthrows so many fair Buildings. The second seems like a Knock∣ing, or great strokes under the Ground, which makes the Superficies recoyl and fall, inclos'd Vapors then seeking a Passage. The third, a Ripping and Renting of the Earth into yawning Graves, in which are swallow'd up and buried oftentimes whole Cities. But he that Dedicated his Description of the
World to Alexander the Great, reckons four more: The first is a double Trem∣bling, that meets and dashes Terrene Billows one against another: The se∣cond, a Breaking of the Ground in all parts: The third, onely a Rumbling under Ground: The fourth, shuffling the Earth in a wonderful manner, which turns all things topsie-turvey. How long they continue.Concerning the continuance of Earthquakes, sad experience hath taught us, that some will last forty days together, without little or any intermission, ac∣cording to the easiness or difficulty of the vents which keeps in longer or short∣er the shut up Commotions. The signs before the Earth∣quakes.There are also several signs that are fore-runners of these miserable effects; for growing near (as we said before) the Air is generally very calm, because those Vapors that commonly disturb the Air, are confin'd in the close Bowels of the Earth; and if any Cloud appear, it seems like a thin stroke or white Line athwart the Sky, which happens commonly after Sun-set, and in fair Wea∣ther. But the Sea is troubled, swelling very much without any apparent cause of molestation; and the Water that had been fresh in standing Lakes, grows Salt and Brackish. Pliny H st. 19.Pliny relates, That Pheraecides a Grecian Philosopher, after he had taken such Water out of a Pit, foretold the Lacedemonians of the Destruction of their City, then threatned by an approaching Earthquake; Another sign is, that the Rep∣tilia, or all creeping Animals that live under ground, forsake their dark Recesses, and frighted, seek up and down for other abodes; The Sun, no Clouds ap∣pearing, grows dark, and shines pale and dim. The events that follow on an Earthquake.The Earthquakes themselves amaze the beholders in such manner, that they often bereave men of their Senses; for who would not be astonish'd, and for ever after stupifi'd into folly or frenzy,Stange inconveniencies in Japan, occasion'd by Earth∣quakes. to see Houses, Towns, Cities, nay whole Kingdoms turn'd into one Sepulchre? great and new Islands, thrown up in an instant in the Sea? Mountains remov'd, and seeming routed to run several ways; the sollid and firm Continent, turn'd into a crue of segregated Isles, and other Lands, the Sea quitting them, are joyn'd to the main Land? Fire, and Streams of burning Sulphur are vomited out of the Earth, and burning Coals, Ashes, and heaps of Rubbish spread over Sea and Land, for the space of many Miles; common Roads turn'd into Rivers; then the sickness and mortality that happens after, falling on-those that escape, from the dire infecti∣on of noysome Parbreaks belch'd from the Earth; of which dreadful Calami∣ties, no Nation suffer more than the Japanners. ¶ ANd that we may have a better sence of the miserable condition of those that suffer in this worst of extremities, take a brief account from Eye∣witnesses of two that happen'd nearer our own doors; The first happen'd about 160 years ago at Bononien;Horrible Earthquakes at Bononien. the second in Ragusa, near Illiria. Philippus Ber∣naldus, a learned Person, liv'd Anno 1505. in Bononien, where on the last of Octo∣ber, about eleven a Clock at night, a horrible noise awaken'd him, and all the City; soon after, Chimneys and Walls tumbled to the ground, yet in few hours, it beginning to cease, they were a little comforted; but three days after about the same hour in the night, it broke forth with such violence, that the Inhabitants expected nothing but their utter ruine, hideously roaring, and thundering underneath, and rouling like a troubled Sea above the Earth; great and small Buildings falling with dreadful cracks into a heap of Ruines; dark∣ness
increasing, made the terror the greater. Half of Prince Bontivoly's Palace fell with such force, tumbling down, added so to the Earthquake, that it shook the whole City. The Walls of St. Jaques, St. Peter, and St. Francis Churches were rent from the top to the bottom, the Steeples and Pinnacles, and other Towers coming all down headlong at one blow, not one Chimney in the whole City or Suburbs left standing, yet by degrees, after the great violence abated, eve∣ry night, some sudden trepidations gave them new alarms of fresh terror; therefore the Inhabitants forsaking their own houses, liv'd in Tents in the Corn Fields, at least a moneth after; most of whom fell into Burning-Feavers, of which many dy'd. After the second Earthquake, began a third, which also beginning in the night, lasted forty days, doing great mischief, after the unvaluable damage they had suffer'd before. Moreover, Boroaldus relates, That his friend Falcus Argelatus was struck with such a Consternation, that loosing his Senses, in a desperate manner cut his own throat, who not performing speedily the work, he frantickly ran up a pair of Stairs, and threw himself headlong out of a Window, and broke his own neck, whereof he dy'd. An Earthquake at Ragousa:Not long since, Ragousa was in like manner terribly shaken by an Earth∣quake. This Trepidation began on the sixth of April 1667. in the morning be∣tween eight and nine of the Clock, it being a clear and Sun-shiny day. In the twinkling of an eye, the whole City was shaken, the Legier George Crook, being sent by the States of the United Netherlands to take his Residence at Constantino∣ple, had also a house at Ragousa, which tumbling down, kill'd him, his Wife, Minister, Child, and two Servant-Maids. Jacob Van Dam, who was President for the Netherlanders at Smirna, was in the same house, but in a lower Room. He with six others got under a Stone pair of Stairs; he was no sooner out of his Lodging, scarce half Cloth'd, but it tumbled down, with three Stories more, darkness struck them with fresh terror; after which, when growing clear, Van Dam came forth from his shelter, and went to Crook's House, where calling as loud as he could, and hearkening if possible he could to hear any body answer him, he concluded that they lay all swallow'd under the Rubbish and Ruines. Neither durst he tarry long there, seeing the Walls totter, fear∣ing he might suffer under the like Calamity, never standing still, till he got quite out of the City; all the way terrifi'd with imminent danger, Stones and pieces of Timber still falling in a terrible manner, both before and behind him, the ground trembling under him, and gaping in several places about him, that hundreds of swallowing Gulfs appear'd in the Streets. Thus he, with six more of his Company, with much trouble and terror scap'd out of Rogousa, lo∣sing one by sudden death in the way; but when they had clear'd themselves of the Town, the Countrey prov'd no less difficult and dangerous, great heaps of torn up Rocks and Rubbish, filling the Paths, so that they being put to a stand, could find no way to get farther, whilst looking behind them, they saw the City in several parts of fire, and three Store-houses of Powder (a dreadful thing) when e're they catcht, would utterly destroy the miserable remainder of those yet alive. Thus for a night and a day this misery lasted, without any intermission, whilst the people that escaped lay in the Fields, without either eating or drink∣ing; and few of these that thus escaped, but were either hurt or struck with sickness, and had not a Venetian Ship that lay in the Harbor afforded them
Bread, they had perish'd with hunger; which Vessel also ran as dangerous a Risk, for the water forsaking the Haven, left them three times on the bare Sand, and that often times failing, hideously gaping, was ready to swallow them up; then the Sea returning with such violence, that it was a wonder but they had been bilged upon the Shore, besides many others suffer'd that lay there, living in a most sad condition, under beams lighting across amongst the Piles, that were hurt and maim'd, languishing, starv'd to death, no possible help to remove the great heaps of Timber and get them out. Van Dam at last got aboard of a Ship, where the terror was a little mitigated, a Magazine of Powder being very near, expecting every minute the blowing up; when two days after, on the eight of April, three hundred Turks and Moor-lacks on Horses and Mules, descending from the Mountains, after some small resistance, entred the City, there making havock and bloody slaughter where e're they went; so clearing the way with a great booty gather'd up amongst the Ruines, return'd. On the sixth day, the Earthquake beginning to abate a little, Van Dam went towards the City, to look after his Goods, and several Presents which the Am∣bassador Crook had in custody for the Grand Seignior. The City was yet in a miserable condition, the Earthquake still continu'd, though not so furiously as before, the Fire also not quench'd, and the Streets full of Theeves and Robbers; the Ways and Paths cover'd with dead bodies, of which some were Burn'd, others lying in their own Blood, which occasi∣on'd a horrible stench: Yet Van Dam found at last some Labourers, whom he employ'd to dig out his Goods from under the Rubbish, promising them one half for getting the other. Two days they spent in prosecution of the design, but nothing appearing, they were quite disanimated, and gave over; of six thousand House-keepers, remain'd scarce six hundred alive, sixteen thousand be∣ing Burnt and lost by the Subterranean Fires breaking forth. A farther journey in Ja∣pan.¶ BUt now to return to our business, the Netherland Ambassadors stay'd a night in Odauro; and after they had view'd the place, where the old Castle was sunk, and a new one rais'd upon the Walls of the former, they went on in their Journey, being the thirtieth of October, crossing several Rivers, and through many Villages to Hedo, and from thence to Osa; next they Ferry'd over the Rivers Barueuw, and Sanamicauwa; over which being got, they went through Firaski, Banio, Tamra, and Fovissauwa, all fair Villages. Description of the Temple Toranga.¶ THis way they met with nothing worthy their observation, but a large Temple, dedicated to one of their gods call'd Toranga: On the four corners of the Roof lay four large Oxen, Carv'd to the life, curiously Gilded. The Roof on each side jutting out above six Foot beyond the Walls; the Tem∣ple it self built Quadrangular, in each Square stood four Figures, painted ac∣cording to the manner of their Antient Hero's, whose several Atchievements are by their poor People sung up and down in the Streets; above which are Windows of pleited Rushes, the upper part fasten'd to the Roof, and the low∣er to the Pictures; a white Plaister'd Wall being between the Temple, is sur∣rounded with a Stone-Wall, like a Breast-Work, Plaister'd; in the inside, near the Front, joyns the House of one of the Bonzi, whose Cupulo appears in Pro∣spect like the Steeple of a Temple.
Tempel int Koninekryck Vaccata Temple in the Kingdome VACCATA Description of the Idol Toranga.¶ VVIthin stands the Idol Toranga, who had formerly been a great Hun∣ter in Corca, and commonly dwelt in the Metropolis Pingjang; some Centuries before the Chinesy King Hiaovus, subdu'd and brought under his subjection half the Island Corca, which had never before tasted the cruelty of the Tartars, nor heard of the Spoils of Sandaracha, with which the Japanners and Chineses furnish their Houses: Otherwise Toranga, the Japanners Mars would have releas'd Corca from those troubles with which they were molested a long time. Toranga finding not work enough in Corca, went over to Japan; at which time there was a grand Rebel that molested many of the Kings, putting all to the Fire and Sword where ever he went; which Toranga understanding, immedi∣ately takes up Arms, sending for aid from Corca, then call'd Leaotung. Every Territory supply'd him with men, and chiefly the Province of Kinks, in which the City Pingjang is scituate, produc'd many stout Souldiers, which they sent over to Japan. The other seven Territories being Hoanchai, Kiangyen, Civen∣lo, Kingxan, Changoing, Caociubi, and Pingan, rais'd also many Forces for Toranga; at last he Mustering all his Forces together in Jamam, brought it to a Field-Battel, where he got the day, slew the Rebel, and also eight Kings that were joyn'd with him; alluding to which,How Tonga became a god. their Idol Toranga stands fighting with a Humane Figure, having nine Arms, in each hand a several Weapon, viz. a Sword, Club, Stilletto, Scimeter, Battel-Ax, Bowe and Arrow, setting his right foot on the middle of a Copper-Dragon spitting fire, his left on the Tail; betwixt these two Images, in contest appears more backwards upon a Wall, where his Arms stands Ingraven, a White Steer, and under several Japan Characters, beneath a white Stag, with a Mans Head Crown'd; Both which the Cereans Worship and Adore with great Veneration; all these Images stood on a stately Altar, curiously Carv'd, underneath were several square Seats. This Toranga is taken for one of the first Emperors of Japan, who by his victo∣rious Arms, had brought all those several Kingdoms under his own subjection,
and for his Heroick actions, in process of time, the Japanners have Registred him amongst their gods. Idol Basanwow.¶ IN like manner, Basanwow was also Worshipp'd formerly as a god, by the Germanes: Trithemius relates, That Basanwow, youngest Son of Diocles King of the Sicambrians, following his Father in the Wars, made many glorious Con∣quests, subduing the People of Frier and Meats, and slew the powerful Lord Thaboryn, so making himself Master of his Countrey; and in the Sixteenth year of his Raign, he was so arrogantly ambitious, that he design'd and affected to be honor'd as a God; to which purpose he Summon'd a Parliament, amongst whom taking place in his Imperial Throne, richly Habited in all his Parliament Robes; he on a sudden, as was neatly contriv'd, was drawn up, and the Roof like a chang'd Scene closing again, so he in all his glory vanish'd, none ever knowing after what became of him, so they all voted him (nemo con∣tra dicente) ascended into Heaven, and so from that time forward, he was rank'd amongst the Tutonick Deities, and honour'd as a god. ¶ BUt the Ambassadors leaving this Temple of Toranga, proceeded in their Journey from Fovissawa through Toska and Fundage, to Cammagawa, where they rested a night; the next morning being very cold, they Rid along the Sea shore; about Noon they met with a Noble Lady, being the Empe∣rors Neece,Great state of the Empe∣rors Neece. who was travelling to Meaco, there to Marry with a near Relati∣on of the Dayro: Her attendance were very rich in Apparel, several Persons of Honor riding on stately Horses, with Gold Embroyder'd Saddles, their Bri∣dles beset with Pearls and Diamonds; her other Servants ran a Foot before in very Costly Liveries; her Guard also were arm'd with Bowes and Arrows, and some with Pikes and Muskets. Description of the Japan Waggs.Besides the Men, she had also many Ladies of Honor that attended her, sit∣ting in Chariots drawn by Oxen and Horses, which were led by some of their
Servants, with Reins made of Gilded Chains; the Chariot having two Wheels, near which were steps like a Ladder to enter the Chariot, which as ours hath four, theirs have eight Angles, every corner above adorn'd with a Dragon Couchant; the outside of the Coach curiously Painted and Gilt in several Panes, with a Frame neatly Carv'd, are Pannel'd with several Pictures. This sumptuous Train was above three hours before they all past by the Hollanders, who stood still to see them. The Ambassadors Frisius and Brockhurst reckon'd up by Leagues from place to place.Then Riding on through the Village Cawasacca, and the City Sinagawa, on the last of October, they entred the Imperial City Jedo; having undergone a long and tedious Journey, since their departure from Osacca, for from Osacca to Firaskatta, is five Leagues; from thence to Jonday, three; so to Fissima, three; then to Meaco, three; from thence to Oets, three; from Oets to Cusatz, three and a half; so to Itzibe, three; then to Minacutz, three and a half; thence to Zint∣zamma, three; so to Sacca, two; from Sacca to Sicconosory, two; then to Cammi∣ammi, one and a half; thence to Isacutz, two and a half; from hence to Jokeitz, also two and a half; so to Quano, three. Then the Ambassadors cross'd a Bay seven Leagues broad, to Mire; from thence to Narroma, a Mile and a half; then to Siriomi, two Mile and a half; so to Ocosacci, three; then to Fintzawa, one and a half; from hence to Accosacci, two; then to Goi, half a League; from Goi to Josenda, two and a half; so to Ftagawa, one and a half; from thence to Suriski, one and a half; so to Arei, one; then to Meisacca, over a Bay, one and a half; from hence to Fannama, three; so to Foucorais, one and a half; then to Cacingaaw, two; from thence to Nisaca, one and a half; from Nisaca, to Cancia, is the like distance; so to Simanda, one; then to Fovisjeda, two; from hence to Ocambe, one and a half; then to Mirico, two; from Mirico to Surunga, one; so to Jesare, two and a half; then to Okis, one; thence to Jui, two; from hence to Cambaro, one; so to Jussiwarra, two and a half; then to Farry, two; from thence to Nomatz, one and a half; so to Missima, one and a half more; then to Facanne, four; from thence to Odaura, is also four; from Odaura to Oiso, is the
like distance; from hence to Fraski, two; so to Fovissaunea, three; then to Tos∣ka, two; from Toska to Fundaga, one and a half; thence to Cammagawa, three; so to Cawasacca, two; from hence to Sinagawa, three; from Sinagawa to Jedo, is also three Leagues; so that their whole Journey from Nangesaque to Jedo, was Three hundred forty five Leagues; five and twenty Leagues reckon'd to a de∣gree. But Nangesaque and Osacca,How far Nangesaque lies from Jedo. are Two hundred and twenty, and Osacca and Jedo, One hundred thirty five Leagues distant one from another. Frisius and Brookhurst come to Jedo.No sooner were the Ambassadors enter'd Jedo, and entertain'd in the house where the Agents for the Netherland East-India Company have their Residence: but they sent to the Chief Governor Sickingodonne, and the Masters of the Cere∣monies Sabroiseimondonne, to inform them of their Arrival. The Street through which they Rid, when they enter'd the City, before they came to the Inn, was at least four Leagues long, both sides closely Built with Houses, and parted or divided with Fifty three Gates, which are lock'd up every night, for at every Hundred and eighty Paces distance stands a Gate. Description of the Impe∣rial City Jedo.¶ THis City stands in Thirty five Degrees, and Thirty eight Minutes Northern Latitude, near a Bay of the South-Sea; Before it are seve∣ral Banks and Shelves, so that none but small Vessels can come near; and though the Water be very shallow in this place, yet it produces great store of Flounders, Gurnets, Plaice, Roaches, Eels, and excellent Oysters, but cannot be bought but at great Rates: As also, all other Provisions are dear, the City being very large, and exceeding populous. After what manner the houses are built in Jedo.Most of the Houses are built of Clay, the outsides cover'd with Boards, serving as a defence against Rain; besides the innumerable small Buildings: the great Houses of the Nobility adorn the City very much; every one of these large Edifices have several stately Entrances, amongst which one exceeds all the other in Beauty and Art, which is never open except for the Emperor: For when a Noble-man builds a House,Strange gates at Jedo. he makes one Gate or Arch, which is cover'd over with Planks, it being artificially Carv'd with Imagery, all Gilt and Varnish'd after the Indian manner, and are also kept so close cover'd, that none may or can look upon them, but in one Moneth of the Year, which is when the Emperor is pleas'd to Dine in the new Edifice, then they open their ample Gates, through which none but the Emperor passeth, and after that they shut them up again, because none should be so much honor'd as to Tread in the same place where the Emperor had been before, for he never but once makes a Visit. Streets in Jedo.This City also stands in the Territory of Quanto, and like most Cities in Japan, without Walls. The Streets are generally of a good length, every one being sixty Ikins long, which is One hundred and fifty Paces; at the end of which stands a Gate that is Lock'd and Guarded every night; at every end of the Street is a Gate, which is a Ward within it self, having two Head-boroughs or Constables, that look to keep all things in good Order in these their Precincts, and deliver up an account Weekly of all Accidents in the same to the Chief Warden of the City. This dividing Street from Street, is not onely observ'd in the Cities of Japan, but also in all their Towns and Villages.
view of Iedo (Edo) IEDO
Inhabitants are free from Custom.¶ ALl the Inhabitants here are free from paying of Taxes, onely giving a certain Sum of Money to their Landlords, for the Ground-Rent of their Houses; most of which are built of Wood, and therefore Jedo and all other places are very subject to Fire, often-times whole Cities so being consum'd, yet they still Re-build them of the same Materials: Every Street hath also a large Store-house, built of Stone, which in the Fire time, they preserve all their Richest and most considerable Goods; they all dwell in the lower-most Rooms of their Houses, the upper being scarce big enough to hold their Lumber. The Mountain Tacajama.As you come from Sea to Jedo, the Mountain Tacajama stands on the left side of the City, rising with its shady top towards the Clouds, from which al∣so descends a River, running along under a Woodden Bridge by several Houses into the Sea. On this Rock stands also the chiefest of the Emperors Towers, at whose Foot is a fair Temple, Dedicated to the Emperor;Emperors Temple. for which reason none upon pain of death dare presume to enter the same, but onely his Impe∣rial Majesty, his nearest Relations, and the chief of the Bonzies. Village Tonquarba.¶ THe Village Tonquarba lies in a pleasant Grove, on the right side of the Mountain; somewhat more Easterly, the City Algirham is shaded and surrounded by many tall Cedars, a Castle belonging to it, onely appearing above the Trees; about half way between Tacajama and Tonquarba, flows the River Toncaw through Jedo, into the South-Sea:The River Toncaw. Without the City is a large Stone-Bridge, with nine Arches crossing the foremention'd River. Near this Bridge stands the Palace of Toerodono, Chief Ranger of Quanto. Palaces and Churches in Jedo.Near the City is another Stone-Bridge which crosses the River, that on one side washes the Village Tonkoujamma; opposite against which stands the Castle of a Noble-Man rising aloft, with four Galleries like a large Turret; Some∣what more Westerly stands another stately Building, of one of the Emperors Chief Officers; on the top of whose Frontispiece stands a Square Turret. At the upper end of the City, close by the River Toncaw, appears an exceeding large Watch-Tower, being Four-hundred fifty eight Foot and a half high, Guarded with twelve hundred Souldiers. On the East side of this the Emperors Magazine, a large Structure; in the West, rang'd in order, stand several. Temples of their Idol Fotoques, one con∣secrated to Camis, and another to their Evil Natur'd god, which we call the Devil: In the middle of the City rises a most delightful Banqueting-House, in which the Emperor Chiongon Toxogunsama us'd to Recreate himself. The Emperors Garden.Moreover, those that view the West part of Jedo, will first see the Palace of the King of Bungo, to which is joyn'd his Imperial Majesties Garden, which is so exceeding pleasant and delightful, that those famous Orchards of Semira∣mis being reckon'd amongst the Seven Wonders of the World, are much inferior to it; Nature and Art striving to out-vye one another. Next to this, stands the Palaces of the Lords of Chiecow and Firando, His Im∣perial Majesties Councellors, Bungono, Nognicono, Vonemo, Ingando, Cambano, Ri∣mo, Cuno, and Texinucano: The Camies also Resides in a very sumptuous Build∣ing. Somewhat farther is another fair House, in which Utrandono, the Emperors Groom-Porter dwells; Southward from thence is the Temple of Xaca; close by which stands the Custom-house; near this are several large Buildings for
the Emperors Generalissimo; somewhat farther, a Wall'd Plain, where two thousand Horse may be drawn up and Mustred. The Temple of Xantay, to what end, and by whom built.Amongst other Temples, is also very Beautiful, that which is consecrated to the Idol Xantay, having three Roofs one above another: The Emperor Nobu∣nanga, after he had brought thirty Kingdoms under his Subjection, and by that Victory obtain'd the Imperial Crown, spar'd no Cost in the building thereof, that by that means his Name might be ever after kept in memory: He would also have been honor'd as a God, and with more Zeal than any other of the Ja∣pan Deities; but being murther'd by the Prince Aqueche, Anno 1582. with his Death the Ceremony of his Service, a Divine Worship was utterly ceas'd, and his Temple consecrated to Xantay. Temples full of Images.Not far from thence you pass by the Court of the Chief Governor of the South part of the City Jedo, which being built long in Front, hath in the mid∣dle a Portall with a square Tower: Farther into the City are two Temples of the Ickoisen, almost touching one another, both full of little Images: Next to these are two more, that belong to the Priests, which they call Bulgru; within these are no manner of Statues found, except one representing the shape of a horrible Monster. This City hath also several other fair Buildings, in that part which is be∣yond the Mountain Tocajamma, for there is a strong Garrison wherein are Quarter'd Three thousand five hundred Souldiers: On one side of which is the Palace of the Mayor, or Chief Governor of that part of the City, to whom all the Inferior Officers are to render an account weekly, of what hath happen'd in that time in their several Wards. The Watch-Tower which is seen at a great distance, both by Sea and Land, and the Garrison, with the Chief Governors Court, make most ways a Trian∣gular Prospect; somewhat farther stands a Temple Dedicated to all sorts of Beasts, with a very high double Roof. On the North side of which appears a large Court, in which four of the prime Bonzies live together, having also three Temples built in a Row. The Temple of Camis, and Fotoques.¶ AT last appears the Temple Consecrated to the Idol Camis, and Fotoques; which Names are not peculiar for one, or two, but general; for the Japanners call all their gods, to whom they Pray for future Bliss in the world to come, Fotoques; and those from whom they expect Transitory Happiness, as Health, Wealth, and a fair Race of Children, that should enjoy what they are possess'd withal after their Deaths, they call Camis. The Emperors Seraglio.In the List of Superior Deities, many of their Princes and Emperors, for their great Atchievements, when living, have been Registred by their Subjects, and after departure Worshipp'd as their gods, as the Antient Greeks and Romans heretofore. But on the other side of the Imperial Garden, stands the Seraglio, for his Wo∣men, being in thirty large Divisions, which the Japanners call the Chandran; nearer the Sea are more Palaces belonging to the Kings, Quicougeu, and Date, and beyond those the King of Saxuma, hath his Court much resembling Quicou∣geu his Palace, onely the last hath a large Porch, built Arch-wise high, like a Steeple.
TEMPEL met Duysend BEELDEN.
¶ BUt that which Crowns the City, and appears above all the rest, is the Empresses Magnificent Palace, which they call Miday, rising aloft with three Galleries, or Stories according to their manner, one surmounting the other. The King of Figens Court makes also a stately show: But on one side of the Empresses Palace are Houses, being large built, all of Stone, wherein lies the Inexhaustable Emperial Treasures, and heap'd-up Mountains of Gold, and Silver, not to be valued within the compass of Arithmetick; the Riches of St. Mark, and the Golden Mines of Potosi, with the whole Revenues of all the European Kings cast up together, would scarce Ballance the unimaginable Audits, and vast Accompts thereof. Phaiglerodano Cammangon, the Empresses Brother, being the King of Jamay∣stero, dwells here also in a sumptuous Palace, near which are three Courts, be∣longing to his Unckles, the first being the King's of One way, the second of Mito, the third of Cinocuni, all three Brothers to the Emperor Xogunsama, surnam'd Conbosama; These three Palaces stand very near one another, the largest and fairest, is that in which Cinocuni Resides, having two Roofs one above another. Xogunsama, Son to the Emperor Daifusama succeeded his Father in his Throne, Anno 1616. Other Palaces in Jedo.Near this place also stands a fair Building, belonging to two Brothers of the King Amanguci. Somewhat farther is the Court of the King of Tacata; and next that the Residences of the Kings of Zanuaquq, Fanga, and Omura. About the middle of the City are five Palaces more, in which reside the Princes Amacusa: Beyond these, the King of Arima hath a large Court: The Temples of the two Emperors are also very beautiful; on the North end is a Light-house of Five hundred ninety four Foot high:A Light-house for ships to steer into the Harbor. Some distance from hence is a fair Cloy∣ster for Widows; And near this, the Palace, in which the Chief Governor of the East part of the City resides; Six Streets farther, a Temple Dedicated to the Idol, with four Heads. But that which exceeds all the Buildings at this end of the City, is a stately Cloyster, whose height, largeness, and magnificence deserves no small won∣der; in this Colledge, the second, and third Son of the Emperor have their Education, bred up to several Arts and Eastern Learning: Towards the East end of Jedo appear two fair Temples, both Dedicated to their god Amida.The Temples of Amida. But distinguish'd, by calling the one onely Amida, and the other, The Golden Amida; At the farthest end of the City, opposite to the Village Tonquerba, is the Court of the Emperors Chief Custom, and Collector in the East part of Jedo. Description of the costly City Amida.¶ THe Temple of The Golden Amida is no small Ornament to this City, the Idol which is terrible to behold, stated on an Altar; in the mid∣dle of the Isle the Altar is Plated all over with Silver, on which stand two Gol∣den Cups, one before, and another behind the Idol, who sits himself Mounted on a Horse with seven Heads, every Head signifying an hundred thousand of Years, his own like that of a Dog with long ears, in his hands a Golden Hoop, holding the middle in his Mouth betwixt his Teeth; but nothing can be more costly than the Skirts of his Coat, from the middle downward, Stud∣ded and Emboss'd with Pearls, Diamonds, and other Pretious Stones: At the bottom of the Altar are many Japan Characters Ingraven, which are the Hiero∣glyphicks or Mysteriouss Signification of the several Attributes of this their
Idol to be esteem'd one of the chiefest of all their Deities, therefore they ac∣count it a Blessing, when they have occasion but to name him. The Empress worships Amida.¶ FAther Lodowick Frojus relates in his Letter from Canga, an Island in Japan, dated Anno 1565. That the Emperor Cuba his Royal Consort, had built a Chappel in her own Palace, Dedicating it to Amida, in which she daily attended with a great Train of Ladies, there paying her Devotions to his Statue representing a comely Youth, Crown'd with Gold, that Reflected Rayes, like Sun-Beams; for when the Emperor Cu∣bus was slain by the Rebels Diandono and Mioxindono, and the Empress making her escape took Sanctuary in a Monastery near Miaco, where being discover'd, the Priviledge of the place not protecting, they sent an Executioner to take away her life; she preparing to obey the hard Sentence, call'd for Pen, Ink, and Paper, and Wrighting to her two Daugh∣ters which were also Imprison'd in the next House; Informing them, That she was to be un∣justly Murder'd, but she rejoyc'd, and would be glad to Imbrace Death, because she doubt∣ed not, but that Amida had found this means to bring her to a better Habitation, and the sooner to enjoy that Paradise, where her Dear Husband, so lately Murder'd remains; ex∣pecting by her company the full accomplishment of both their Happiness. Then Sealing the Letter, she thank'd the Bonzi for his kind entertaining of her in their Colledge, and draw∣ing near to Amida's Altar, where kneeling, she lifted up her Hands, and call'd twice on the god for to forgive her her Sins: Then the Bonzi laid his Hand upon her Head, as a Token, that she had Absolution from all her Offences; then going from thence into a pri∣vate Room, she lifted up her hands again to Heaven, and cry'd, Amida, Amida, which said,Was beheaded. she was Beheaded. Images of Amida, are di∣vers.Furthermore, it is to be observed, that there are several Images Represen∣ting this god; for whereas he sometimes is made (as we said before) with a Dogs Head, riding on a Seven-Headed Horse, another resembling a Naked Youth, with Holes in his Ears, sitting on a large Rose, Carv'd of Wood, and in a strange Shape, with a Fantastick Cap on his Head, slit before, with two large Buttons on the top, with a comely and youthful Countenance; in his
Ears hang two Rings, one within another, about his Neck a Scarf, his Breast cover'd with an Oval Plate curiously Engraven, over his Shoulders and Back hangs a Coat of Feathers neatly Wrought, and joyn'd together, in his Hands a String of Beads, his Breast and Belly exceeding large, sitting on a great Cushion, before him stands several Japan Letters, Engraven on a square Stone. They also place oftentimes near their god Amida, another Idol with thre Heads, which are cover'd with one flat Cap, or Bonnet, joyn'd close together, their Chins Hairy, about the Neck a Pastboard Band, on each side four Arms and Hands, the Breast and Waste girded with five Strings of Pearl; the Belly appears like the Body of the Sun, darting Rays, with several Chara∣cters in the middle; the Walls are all hung with rich and costly Japan Habits, and before them many burning Lamps. A very stately Temple with a thousand Images near Meaco.But besides these two Temples of Amida in Jedo, there is a most famous Chappel about a League from Meaco, being of more antiquity, erected by some of their antient Emperors, and since by the Modern enlarg'd and beautifi'd, being four hundred and twenty Foot long, having two great Porches, with Portcullises in the middle: where entring you may first see a large Seat, on which sits an Image, bigger than the Life resembling a Giant, with Holes in his Ears, Bald-headed, and shaven after the manner of the Indian Brachmans; over this huge Figure hang several Cups, on both sides divers shapes of Armed Sol∣diers, Morisco Dancers, Exotick Wizards, and other dreadful Figures, with an∣tick Gestures: Their Wind and Thunder also are personated in terrible Figures. Then they enter the Chappel, ascending on seven Steps, having five hundred Idols on each side fix'd to the Wall, all representing Canon the Son of Amida, with amiable Looks, each having thirty Arms, two of which are of ordinary size, but all the other very small, and in every Hand two Arrows, on their Breasts are engraven seven little Faces, on their Heads Golden Crowns, with Strings of Diamonds. Moreover, not onely the Chains, Bells, and other things belonging to these Images, but also the Statues themselves are all Massie Gold, wrought by the Goldsmith, insomuch that the beholders Eyes dazle at the glory and splendor of Canon's Chappel. To which most People from all Parts of Japan repair to perform their Devotions, and the rather, because there are many more Temples near it, to which they also resort upon the same ac∣count. Description of an Uni∣versity in Japan.¶ ABout two Miles from the aforemention'd Chappel is a famous Univer∣sity, built at the Foot of a Hill, and divided into several Halls, Col∣ledges, Cloisters, surrounded by a pleasant Stream: near which are many Chappels; in some of which they worship a horrible Image, representing, as we suppose, the Devil. On the top of the Hill appears three great Temples built of Wood, on exceeding large and thick Pillars; the Ground Pav'd with polish'd Marble. Of the Idol Xaca.In one of these stands a very large Image of their god Xaca, having many lesser Statues plac'd on both sides of him; at his back hangs a Piece of Parch∣ment, to which are joyn'd two thousand broad Seals, near which stands forty Representations of two-year-old Children; on each side of the Temple are two foul and horrible Monsters Arm'd with great Clubs. All these Images and Seals are richly Gilt.
In the second Temple, or rather a Theatre, for there they keep all their Commencements, promoting of Students, according to their several Merits, to Places and Dignities, which they perform thus: The Proficient and the Master of this Ceremony are placed in the middle of the Stage, with Penons and Flags hanging over their Heads, where the Graduate in a formal manner beseeches a Prime Doctor to put him in Orders, and prefer him according to his Deserts; which done he takes Place as he is advanced. The Temple for the Por∣cupine.This Edifice is dedicated to the Porcupine, amongst them the Embleme of Learning; but they erect no Altar nor Image for him, as for other gods, but onely hang the dead Animal up in the Roof of the Hall, that when the Stu∣dents implore this Deity to fill them with Arts and Sciences, they may lift with their Eyes, their Hearts also to Heaven. The third exceeds the other two in heighth and beauty. Palaces for Scholars.Here are other several Halls, adorn'd with large Image, which make up their University; where Scholars Study and have their Residence: in each of them are fair Libraries,Japan Library. stuft with innumerable Catalogues of Books, where with a Skrew, or turning of a Wheel, what Book soever they desire to see, presents it self. Many Churches in Ja∣pan.¶ THe Number, Magnificence, and wonderful Riches of dedicated Places and Temples for Divine Worship, are beyond admiration, and al∣most incredible. The greatest have dwelling in them, to perform the Rites and Ceremonies, twenty Priests; the second Rate, fifteen; others, ten; and the least, two. Make bad use of them.But these Structures, built for religious intentions, and commonly in the most luxurious and pleasantest Situation of the whole Isle, are made by their dissolute and gormandizing Priests, the Academies of all Debaucheries, and especially the Schools of Gluttony, Drunkenness, and Lust; who in their Frol∣licks in open view of all their Idols, in a gallanting humor, will not spare to prostitute their wanton Mistresses; and for their more conveniency, lay them at the Feet of their gods, and make them Bolsters for their Adulteries. Hendrick Hagenaer relates, that he saw six Temples near Osacca, at whose Doors stood large Images of Wood, holding Boxes in their Hands, into which the Japanners throw Pieces of Copper, by them call'd Caxa. A strange Chappel.There is also a Chappel, through the middle whereof runs a Stream, into which the poor Women throw several Written Papers. Description of the stately Cobucui.¶ THe manner of building these Japan Temples is very stately. Lodowick Almeida, an Eye-witness, gives a large description of one, call'd Cobucui, in the City Nareau. This Temple (saith he) hath Portico's, behind each a large open Court, surrounded with fair Galleries, supported with Co∣lumns; at the first entrance are broad Stone Stairs, with half Paces; on the uppermost stand two great Images, very artificial, each having Keys in their Hands, intimating that they are Porters of the Temple; behind the third Por∣tal appears the Temple it self, to which they ascend upon Marble Steps: whose two-Leav'd Doors seems to be guarded by two mighty Lyons, Carv'd to the Life; in the middle Isle, towards the upper end are three Images, bigger than the Life, each ten Foot and a half high, representing the god Xaca, and his Children standing on both sides of them; the Floor is all cover'd with square Marble;Exceding great Pillars in the Temple of Xaca. but especially seventy Pillars of Cedar, neatly Carv'd,
of an incredible heighth, which so adorn the Temple, that they strangely amaze the beholders: The Accounts of the building this Edifice say, that each of these Pillars cost 5000 Ducats: The Walls Painted with various Images, and several Plants and Flowers, also much illustrate this House for their Divine Worship; the Roof is cover'd with Tyles made of Clay,And also strange Tyles. not temper'd or mix'd with Sand, but beaten very thin, each being two Inches thick, and have upon a Ground of black Paper several Shapes in antick postures, which are so curious, that they exceed one another in art and beauty:An exceeding Roof. The vaulted Roof being Arch-wise, may last five hundred years without the lest Repair; and notwith∣standing it is very heavy and large, yet it jets nine Foot over beyond the Walls without Supporters, insomuch that our European Builders would think it impossible, that so great a weight could hang over in that nature without falling. The Dining-Room where∣in the Bonzi eat is very costly.On one side of the Temple stands the Colledge of the Bonzi, which is as glo∣rious to behold, and as strong, being an hundred and twenty Foot long, and thir∣ty six Foot broad;And also the Places where they sleep. their Lodging-Rooms about the same are reckon'd to be an hundred and eighty; besides many stately Halls, whereof one stands on twenty four Cedar Columns, in which is the Library of the Bonzi, full of the choicest Japan Books. Here are also several fair Stoves in deep Vaults, and provided with all Necessaries. Their Kitchins are very curiously furnish'd, their Kettles made of the best Copper, are two Foot and a half deep, three in circumference, and two Inches in thickness; before these runs a Rivulet of fresh Water. In the Nights they hang up twenty four Lanterns with lighted Candles in their Chambers. Before this Colledge, or Court of the Bonzi, is a Pool that abounds with all sorts of Fish; of which if any one should adventure to steal, he is without mercy put to death. This Temple Cobucui, hath been built above seven hundred years: The like Temple is also in Jedo, in which the Idol Xaca, of an exceeding huge stature; may be seen.
This Image was erected formerly by the Widow of the Emperor Taykosame, who caus'd it to be made hollow, pouring it full of melted Copper, and the out-side to be Gilt very costly. Description of the Idol Xaca.¶ THe Head of this their god Xaca hath the likeness, or Face of a middle∣aged Man, with a thin Beard, the Hair of his Head cropt above his Ears, his Cap folded like a Scarf, about his Neck are Chains of Gold, inter∣laid with Diamonds, about his Middle a Scarf woven of Gold and Silver, his Hands he holds forth, but a little asunder in a praying posture, about his Wrists are Strings with long Tassels, and sits cross-Legg'd, on a great Golden Plate, before and behind him are two large Vessels, in which they put their Offerings; the Golden Plate whereon he sits, covers a square Altar, on whose Brim hangs twelve Pots by Gold Chains, in which both Night and Day they burn In∣cense, which are still supply'd with odoriferous Gums; the Altar being square, stands on a broad Foot, cut with several Japan Characters. What Xaca was for∣merly.But this their god Xaca, whom they worshipp'd when living, was a great Proficient in the Pythagorean Doctrine, which of old was most generall, and a Religion most spread through all the World, and much follow'd by the Greeks and Latines; from whence the Grecian Fables of Transformation took their rise, who (according to Plato) generally believ'd,Plato 17.10. de Legibus. that Orpheus after his death be∣came a Swan; Thamyras, a Nightingale; Ajax, a Lyon; Agamemnon turn'd to a Crane.Ambros. Lib. De Bono Mors. Cio. Ambrose relates they also believ'd, That the Souls of their Learned chang'd into Bees or Nightingales, because that whilst living, they had pleas'd the Peoples Ears with their sweet and eloquent Language; but the Souls of the malicoius turn into Serpents; Thieves and Robbers, into Wolves; Cozeners and Cheaters after their Death become Foxes; every one changeth into such Creatures, as best analogizeth with their several Vertues and Vices. Plato and Pythagoras, according to Herodotus, first taught the Egyptians this Doctrine. Zamolxis spread the same amongst the Northern Goths; for which they worship him as a god. The Druides spread it all over Gaul and Germany: and the West-Indians, I know not how, are much of that belief: And Jose∣phus tells us,Joseph. L. 18. Ant. G. 11. that the Pharisees amongst the Jews were much biassed with this Perswasion. Julian fondly imagin'd, That the Soul of Alexander the Great in∣form'd and gave life to his Body, and therefore sleighted all dangers. This their god Xaca, saith Father Kircher, the Indians call'd Rama; the Tunkmensers, Chiaga; by the Chineses, Xen Kian. The Chineses derive him from India, in the Province of Tien Turk Gnoe. Moreover, the Japanners have this Tradition concerning Xaca,The Dream of Xaaca's Mother. That his Mother dream'd, that she saw a white Elephant issuing out of her Mouth, and went into her left Side. Why the white Elephants are of so great esteem in India.From hence proceeds that great esteem which the Indians, and chiefly those in China, Lai, Tunchim, Siam, and Pegu, have of white Elephants, for they are kept and attended on like Kings, and feed on all variety of high Fare, and in Golden Dishes. The Nobility visit them in humble and submissive postures. No other Quarrel than a white Elephant caus'd a great War, Anno 1576, between the King of Siam and Pegu, in which the Siams were so defeated, that they not onely lost their white Elephant, but were utterly subdu'd, and brought under by the King of Pegu: But this Yoke the succeeding Princes did soon shake off, and were Masters of two white Elephants, which in short time after dying, caus'd great lamentation to the King and People of Siam, judg∣ing
them to be sent from Heaven, as an evidence and earnest of future bles∣sings. Xaca Murder'd his Mo¦ther.But the first piece of divine service which this their god Xaca in his huma∣nity perform'd, was offering his Mother, which he himself kill'd, lifting up his right Hand towards Heaven, and his left pointing to the Ground, said with a loud voice, Behold, neither Heaven nor Earth affords a greater and more holier Saint than I! This done, he withdrew to a dark Recess under a Mountain, where he spent his time in Study, Writing many Books, and (as the Chineses say) Instruct∣ed eighty thousand Disciples; but out of this number he selected first five thousand five hundred, and out of them drew one hundred, and at last he re∣duced that hundred to ten, which he made great Masters of this so much fol∣low'd Science: And then dying, he left them a great Legacy,He dies. being all those Books that he had Written in the Cave: and that there should be no dispute hereafter concerning the Contents of these Written Volumns, he Seal'd them, and Indorst with this positive Superscription, Thus I Xaca have Written the Truth. His Opinion concerting the transmigration of the Soul.Amongst others of the Pythagorean Assertions, he maintains, That the Soul is transmutated eighty thousand times into several Bodies and Shapes, and that under six vile transformations they committed all sorts of wickedness and im∣piety, and at last turn'd into a white Elephant, by the Indians call'd Lothan hoe Laenses, then they attain'd to the City of rest, and everlasting happi∣ness: but before they come thither they Flye with Birds, Graze with Oxen, Crow with Cocks, Swim with Fishes, Creep with Serpents, and grow with Trees. Hermias a Learned Chri∣stian.Of this their Opinion the Learned Hermias saith thus: When I view my Body I am afraid thereof, for I know not by what Name to call it, whether a Man, a Dog, a Wolf, Stier, Bird, or Serpent, for they say that I exchange into all these several Shapes; which live either on the Earth, or in the Air, and in the Water; neither wild, tame, dumb, prudent, or foolish; I flye in the Air, I creep on the Earth, I run, I sit, and sometimes I am enclos'd a Prisoner in the Bark, of a Tree. The Japanners and the Chineses, which are of Xaca's Religion, believe that the Soul changes into Trees or Plants. A strange Story of a Tree that spake.Philip Marimus, in his Japan Voyage relates, That in Cochinchina, Anno 1632, a Tree of an hundred and twenty Foot high, and a proportionable thickness, was by a Storm blown down to the Ground, which a hundred Men could not move; whereupon being conjur'd, as they say, by one of their Exorcists, to know the reason why it could not be stirr'd, it answer'd, I am a Chinse Pince; my Soul having been transmigrated into several Bodies a hundred Years, at last is setled in this Tree, from which as an Oracle I am to tell you of Couchin China, that a woful War is ready to fall upon you, under whose pressure you shall suffer extremely. This Story, whether fabulous, or an Illusion of the Devil, is believ'd both through all China and Japan, insomuch that ever since they put Dishes of Rice to the Roots of great Trees, that the Souls dwelling within may not languish by long fasting: and therefore they feed Animals and living Creatures also, that they may not suffer by Hunger. Within Camsana (if we may credit Bollandus) stands a Cloister of the Bonzi,Of a Clovster in Cam∣sana Bolland. Vit. San∣ctor. A. . L. an. 15. C. 4. near which is a Hill shaded with pleasant Trees, thither one of the Priests car∣ry daily at a set time two great Baskets, full of all manner of Food, when drawing near the Hill he Rings his Bell, at the found of which is summon'd all sorts of Creatures, that in an incredible number come flocking from their se∣veral
Shelters and Recesses, to which he throws his Alms, and so scatters, that they are generally satisfi'd; which done, in the same manner he Rings them back again, and they fairly retreat to their respective Receptacles. These Animals they believe are animated with the Souls of formerly famous Persons, which reside in several Creatures, analogizing in their different kinds and natures with the humor and disposition of those Hero's when alive. From whom the Japanners have the Opinion of Trans∣migration.It is without contradiction, that this Learning of Transmigration took ori∣ginal in Egypt: And from them Plato and Pythagoras receiv'd that Doctrine, which they Preach'd into Greece, the Seminary then of Philosophy; which at last spread through several Angles of the World: The Gothes had it in the North, the Germans and Gauls in the West, and at the same time the Chineses and Japanners in the East, who receiv'd it from the Indian Brachmans. The Brachmans also affirm, amongst a world of strange Fancies, that some Men for their Crimes, after Death become aerial Spirits, fantastick Shapes, unsubstantial Bodies, wandering up and down so long, till they have suffer'd enough to expiate their Offences. These Spirits are not permitted to Eat the least Blade of Corn, Herb, Grass, nor any thing whatsoever, but onely what they receive by Alms; to which purpose they throw Meat to Daws and Pies nine days together after their Friends departed Souls, that so the wandring of their deceased Relations may pick up something with them. These Spirits sometimes also appear in humane Shapes, but are not to be fear'd, because they are harmless. The Brachmans believe there is a Hell.Moreover, the Brachmans also acknowledge a Hell, by them call'd Jamma Locon, from whence the Souls, after great punishments, are released, and ap∣pear again in the World in several Shapes. But besides their Jamma Locon, they make mention of a deep, dark, and dis∣mal Pit, by them call'd Antam Tappes, which (as they say) is full of Thorns, Vultures, and Ravens, with Iron Beaks and Claws; Mastiff-Dogs, Stinging-Wasps, and Hornets, which heavily afflict and torture the Wicked condemn'd to that Dungeon, in a most horrid and petulant manner, without any cessa∣tion; and that which is worse, their punishment (as they say) never ends. And also a Life after this.They also hold two Conditions of such as are Saved, entring into happi∣ness, some of them travel to an inferior Heaven, call'd Surgam, where no sins are committed; nor death suffer'd to enter; yet the Dewetas (for so they call those that after death are believ'd to go to Surgam,) when their time of resi∣dence there is expir'd, travel from thence, Soul and Body again conjoyn'd; but what becomes of the Body in their return, the Brachmans have not well made out, onely they affirm, That some come back to the World, and are rege∣nerated and born again, and those Feast on all manner of Delicacies, and enjoy fair Women, but without Issue. But this they have not well anvill'd out nei∣ther; for some, they say, never remove from Surgam, but bear Children there, which they number amongst; the Stars; this they hinted from the antient Astronomers, that often (as we do sometimes) discover new Stars in the Firma∣ment. Their Opinion of Heaven.But those which worship and obey Wistnou, keeping themselves from all Offences, are transported to Weicontam, where God sits on a most glorious Throne: But they say there are two Weicontams, calling one Lela Weicontam, which is a most pleasant and delightful Heaven; but the first onely call'd Weicontam: From thence none return again to this World. Great Disputati∣ons
one the Brachmans maintain about their Second Heaven, Lela Weicontam: Some affirm, That the Souls remove from thence to another Elizium: Others maintain the contrary. The Sect Foqueux worship Xaca.Moreover, concerning Xaca, it is well known, That all the Japan Bonzies worship him; but chiefly those they call Foqueux: For as they are of another Sect, so among themselves they are of other Opinions. This Sect is so call'd from a Book written by Xaca, which treats of attaining to Salvation by saying these Words, Namu, Mio, Foren, Qui, Quio; though no Japanners understand the true meaning thereof, being Indian Words. The manner how the wo∣men ourn themselves.¶ THe Funerals in India, if Married People, and the Husband die first, are commonly double; for the Women burn themselves with their Husbands, because they will not live after their deceas'd Lords; so perfecting the Celebrations of the Funerals: Which they willingly expose themselves to, in Honor of their God, whom they call Rama; which they perform thus. When the Wife promises her departing Husband that she will die with him, then she must lose no time; but the same day, where her Husband lies burning in the Funeral Pyre, she must leap in, and be consum'd with him. This dread∣ful Ceremony is strictly observ'd by the Brachmans and Wiensjaes: But the Set∣teraes and Soudraes go farther; for there the Women also burn themselves, though their Husbands die in other Countreys, although it be many Years af∣ter their Deaths, yet as soon as they receive the sad News, they shrink not from the Fiery Trial of their Affections, but by burning dispatch themselves. Some of the Men also are as mad, who in the Worship of their Xaca, dig a large Pit without the City, in which making a great Fire, they desparately leap thereinto, where they are in short time consum'd to Ashes; whilst the Woman sits on a Stool, dress'd up, and richly clad, before the Door of their House; and if she be extracted from the Settera, or Soudra, she hath in one Hand a Lim∣mon, and in the other a Looking-glass, calling continually on the Name of their God, Naraina, or Rama, which is Xaca; sometimes chewing Betel, amongst which they mix an intoxicating Herb, that bereaves her of her Sen∣ses; so taking away all manner of fear of what she is to suffer. But if she belongs to the Brachmans, or Wiensjaes, then they hold red Flowers in their Hands, first dedicated to the Idol, whose Picture they hang about their Necks: Then after she hath taken her Farewel of her Friends, she either goeth out of the City, or is carried in a Sedan, her Countenance being chearful, looking merrily, which she denotes by several Gesticulations of her Hands and Body, crying aloud to the Sound of Trumpets and Drums, Rema, Rama, Saltae; Rama, Rama, Saltae; that is, God Rama, Rama, make me happy. And thus being led through the chief Streets of the City by some of her nearest Friends, and at last approaching near the Place of Execution, where her Husband was burnt, she withdraws to a neighboring Pool; where after having wash'd her self, she puts on a yellow Garment, and gives her richest Apparel and precious Jewels to her chiefest Relations, and to the Brachman-Priest, which makes her Funeral-Sermon, before the Fire, to whom she also makes great Presents: The Pit wherein she is to leap, is like an Oven full of glowing Coals, being hung round about with green Mats, to the end she might not be affrighted at such a horrid Face of Death. At one end thereof lies a Mount, or Heap of Earth, thrown out of a small Hill, on which she takes her last Farewel of her Friends; All which, to perpetrate this dreadful Self-murder, encourage
her to be her own Destroyer; whilst she having thrown her beloved Pestle and Mortar, and other Housholdstuff which she us'd daily, into the Fire, they put a Jar of Oyl upon her Head, letting some fall upon her Body. The Mats being remov'd, the Virago leaps in; and after her, her nearest Relations stand∣ing round about, contribute to the Flames, each throwing in a Fagot, the soon∣er to dispatch their wretched Kinswoman. Difference in burning wo∣men.Thus the Widows end their Lives, that are of the Settrean, Weinjaen, or Sou∣draen Families: But the Brachman Women suffer a more cruel Death; for they are laid close by their Husbands, on the Funeral-Pyre; then the People build a Pile of Wood over them, placing about their Heads Oyl, Rozin, and Turpen∣tine: This done, the Women standing in order round about, make doleful Ullula's, mix'd with loud Shrieks and Lamentations; during which Clamor, the Brachman-Priest lights the Pile, which kindling by degrees, brings a linger∣ing and terrible Death. Women buried alive.Besides this way of ridding themselves of the old Females, they have ano∣ther way of destroying themselves, which they perform thus: They take the Relict, and lead her as it were in Triumph, amongst the Sound of Pipes, Drums, and Trumpets, to a Pit digg'd square like a Cellar, where stands the Body of her departed Husband; to which descending on Earthen Steps, set∣ting her self down on a Bank, she takes the dead Body in her Arms, then per∣fuming the Corps with Frankincense and Myrrhe; which done, the Mourners begin to throw the Mold into the Pit, which she rakes greedily towards her with her Hands, and so having cover'd her self at last with Earth to the Chin; then hanging a Cloth before the Entry of the Pit, they give her Poyson in a little Dish, and then on a sudden break her Neck backwards. Die of Hunger for the Honor of Xaca.Thus also the Japanners, both Men and Women, make away themselves, frantick with mad Zeal, in Honor to their God Xaca: For those that are his greatest Admirers, upon no other account than honoring him, dig their own Graves, covering the tops, leaving onely a small breathing-hole; wherein they famish themselves to death. These kind of Self-murderers, or Sedecedes, happen frequently in and about Jedo, and in several other Places of Japan. ¶ BUt to return again to our Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst, who had inform'd the Lords Sickingodonne and Sabrosaymondonne of their Arrival on the last of November, and staid till the twenty ninth of the following Month in the House of the Chief President for the East. India Company, be∣fore they could be permitted to offer those Presents which they had brought to his Imperial Majesty:Netherlanders are com∣manded to come to Court. They had order to prepare themselves against the next Morning, to appear before the Emperor: Whereupon the Japanners went to a Troo (for so they call a Bath) that they might cleanse themselves; for none must presume to approach before the Emperor otherwise. But when the Netherlanders had got all things in a readiness against the ap∣pointed time,e disappointed. they were countermanded, because the Emperor was indispos'd; therefore they could not as then be admitted to Audience: And the Emperor continuing ill for two Months, they were forc'd to dispence with the time, and bear it patiently. On the sixth of April they receiv'd Orders, that the next Morning they should bring their Presents before the Council, and the young Prince; for his Imperial Majesty was not fully recover'd of his Sickness. So about nine of the Clock the next Morning, the Ambassadors were carried in a large Sedan to the Palace, their Attendants following them on Foot. The
s Kysers hof te JEDO. das Schlos zu Jedo. The Emperors Court at JEDO.
Streets through which they pass'd were exceedingly crowded with People; and coming to the Palace, they went up four Steps,Come to Court. which brought them into a large and spacious Hall, half the Floor neatly rubb'd, the other cover'd with fine Mats, in which some Lords kept a Guard. Through this Hall the Amba∣sadors and their Retinue were led into several fair Chambers,How they were receiv'd. divided from one another by Partitions; where waiting an hour and a half, first the Lord Frisius, and then Brookhurst, were admitted the Presence of four of his Imperi∣al Majesties Privy-Council, who by Commission were to represent the Empe∣ror, as if in Person. Before these the Ambassadors laid down their Pre∣sents; and soon after, before the young Prince the Emperors Son: Which be∣ing deliver'd, and after some small Discourse,Depart from the Court. they had leave to repair to their Lodgings: Onely a Merchant, one Cornelius May, and a Dutch Goldsmith, staid behind, to inform a Japanner how they should order the Materials that belong'd to the Silver Ship, which was one of the Presents, when they would make it ready to Sail. Two Hours they spent in this Instruction; which done, they also went to their Lodgings. Description of the Impe∣rial Palace at Jedo.¶ THe Residence or Palace of the Emperor deserves no small Admira∣tion: Round about the outermost Wall are large Rails, several Foot from the Moat that surrounds the Palace; betwixt which, is a broad Path, al∣ways throng'd with People, and thousands of Coaches and Sedans, continu∣ally going and coming. The Walls are built of Freeze-stone, very high and thick, with Battlements on the tops: The outermost Wall is surrounded with a broad and dry Trench, and over the same a Bridge, with several Arches: The Gate made strong with thick driven Iron Nails, is built four-square, two Stories high; each Square or Story having a peculiar Roof, jetting several Foot over the Walls; on each side of the upper Square hang two long Flags or Pennons, with the Emperors Arms: The Gate is continually Guarded by a strong Watch. Round about the inside of the Out-wall are an innume∣rable company of little Hovels, for the Soldiers: These Huts are built exactly in a Line, and border a second Moat, which is not without several Creeks, because the second Wall juts out in many Places, being a Bulwark, with many Towers, in all which are strong Guards kept, as on the Out-wall. In the second Gate is also a great Watch kept, to which joyns a third Trench,Hath three Moats and Walls. over which leads a fair Stone Bridge, at the end whereof a third Gate opens, between another Stone Wall, very sumptuously built. Strange Wall of the Pa∣lace.This is not a plain straight Wall, but rather a Bulwark; with Redoubts and Out-works, and several Flankers, Towers, and Watch-houses; yet uni∣form, answering one another: So that it rather seems a Fortification, than a Wall. When you are past the third Gate, you enter into a spacious Quadran∣gle, where before you, but as far as you can discern, appears the Emperors Banquetting-house, with stately Turrets, surrounded with Trees and strong Walls: On the Left-hand it is indented; but on the Right, smooth and even, running along a Hill, on which the Emperor's Temple stands. Nearer the third Gate are several lesser Courts: The first being square, hath many fair Lodgings about the same, supported on twenty eight Cedar Columns, being open underneath like Piazza's; over which Rooms a Roof shoots out sloap∣ing, and hath a second Story on the top, Wall'd round about, over whose four Corners jets another Roof. Next this Court, is a second, in which seve∣val Lodgings, resting on four Columns, which face the Entry: Behind these is another new stately Building, inclos'd within a Wall.
The Emperors Garden.¶ THese Outward or Base-Courts are more delighful, by the Pospect of the Emperors Garden, which wants not any thing that Nature, Art, and Cost can afford, the Walks Arbour'd with Trees, the Beds of Flowers curiously divided one from the other, borders on the side of a Hill, whose top is crown'd with a Temple, in which the Emperor pays his daily Devotion. The Palaces of the Em∣perors nearest Relations.But on the left-hand of the foremention'd third Gate, are many beautiful Hou∣ess; the lowermost Roof of which, adorn'd on all Corners with great Golden Balls, hath on it several Rooms and Balconies, from whence they have a large Prospect of the foremention'd open Court, and the three double Bul∣warks. Between this first Palace, and the third Inner-wall, are daily drawn up the Emperor's Guard, being three thousand Men, which keep constant Watch there. Next to this first Palace joyns a second, which exceeds the other in length, but is nothing near so high; the Roof also adorn'd with Golden Balls. Between these two Palaces stands a sumptuous Fabrick, like a Tower: All which Places are the Residences of the Emperor's nearest Relations. Description of the Em∣perors Lodgings.Behind these, appears the most magnificent and stately Residence of the Emperor, adorn'd with three exceeding high Turrets, each being square, rising aloft with nine Stories: Above every Story the Roof jets over so much, that it seems to lessen the Rooms; the middle Turret being the biggest, on whose top glister two large Dolphins, cover'd with a Golden Plate, lifting their Tails up to the Sky: Opposite against which, stands a spacious Hall, on gilded Columns; the Cieling curiously carv'd, and gilded; the Roof also shines like Gold. In this Place his Imperial Majesty always sits, when he gives Audience to Forreign Ambassadors, or any of his Substitute Kings or Princes. On one side of this Hall, the Women belonging to the Court have their several Lodgings. ¶ AFter the Lords Frisius and Brookhurst had had their Audience on the se∣venth of April, before four of the Chief Councellors, and repair'd back to their Lodgings,Fresius and Brookhurst come to Court a second time. they were on the next day, by Orders from Sukingodonne, and Sobrosaymondonne, fetch'd again to Court in two Sedans, their Retinue fol∣lowing them on Horseback; and entring the Palace, they staid a while in the foremention'd Halls. Frisius was first admitted to come before the Council, and soon after Brookhurst, where at that time they treated on nothing; onely the Council presented the Netherland-Ambassadors with several Silk Habits, which the Emperor had given them in return; and then were Licens'd to depart to Nangesaque. They visit the council with Presents.But before they left Jedo, they visited (according to an antient Custom) seve∣ral of Majesties Privy-Council, propining them all with Rich Presents: So on the sixteenth of April all things were made ready for their Departure. But had they not staid so long for Admittance to the Emperors Presence, they in∣tended to have visited the famous Sepulchre of his Majesties Father, which stands four days Journey beyond Jedo,Stately Tomb of the Em∣perors. on a pleasant Hill, the Foot of which is surrounded by a Wall, having a large square Portal in the middle, with strong Gates, on each side of which stand two fair Chappels, built against the Wall, each a Story high; the Edges of the upper, deck'd with Golden Balls: On the left side is a broad Passage, Pav'd with Free-Stones, Rail'd in on both sides, which leads to a Pair of Stairs four Steps high, where they
ascend to the second Gate, which is adorn'd with Gilded Balls: Here the Hill is again surrounded with second Walls, which on the left hand is border'd by a long Temple, and the right side shaded by pleasant Trees. About a Stones cast from the Trees, appears a Chappel; and passing along a crooked Path, a third Gate, flank'd with two Stone Walls, leads to the Entrance behind the Hill, where the Imperial Tomb stands Erected, which indeed is a most glo∣rious and Magnificent Piece: Four Towers rise up towards the Sky, joyn'd together by several stately Buildings which are between them: Within the highest Tower lies the Imperial Corps Interr'd, before which four hundred and fifty Lamps burn both Night and Day. The Emperor visits his Fathers Tomb every year.¶ HIther the Japan Emperor comes, with a great Train of Nobles, to make Offerings to his Deceas'd Father, which he first Consecrates with a long Prayer, in the Chappel before the first Gate, of which, the Front of the lowest Story rests on four square Pillars, half way plaister'd in the Walls, which between the Walls is curiously painted: The Doors double; on both sides of which, and in the middle, stand six Zuilen, two and two together. On the Edges of the broad-brimm'd Roof hang gilded Images: The lower∣most Story hath a Second Building, divided into five Rooms. Copper Candlestick.Within this Chappel hangs a Copper Branch or Candlestick, which the East-India Company presented by Francis Cairon, to the Emperor of Japan, the third of May, Anno 1636. This Candlestick hath thirty Branches, weighing seven hundred ninety six Pounds: And besides this, Cairon presented also to the Emperor two great Persian Alcatives, one Piece of Black Velvet, twelve Fowling-Guns, and fourteen Pieces of all sorts of Cloth. The Privy-Coun∣cellors Samuchedonne, Oiendonne, Actwadonne, Cangadonne, Taikimondonne, Jusdonne, Chi∣madonne, Bongodonne, Triussima, Bitchioudonne, Okradonne, Neysiendonne, and Deysien∣donne, got every one of them peculiar Presents: besides the Inferior Officers at the Emperors Court.
¶ MOreover, The Japanners are exceeding ambitious of perpetuating their Name, sparing no Cost in their Sepulchres. The Funeral-Rites of their Nobles are thus Celebrated.Strange kind of Funerals us'd in Japan. An Hour before the Corps is carried out of the House, the nearest Relations of the Deceased walk before towards the Funeral-Pyre, being all clad in white Silk, which is generally their Mourning Habit: Then the Women follow, both Married and Unmar∣ried, covering their Faces with a Vail of several Colours. Men of great Estates are commonly carried in Herses of Cedar, curiously Carv'd. The Bonzi's Ceremony with the Dead.At a considerable distance follows one of the chiefest Bonzi, the Minister that performs the Funeral-Rites, in a great Coach, which shines, being all Silk and Gold: Thirty Bonzies more run about the Coach; they wear broad-brimm'd Hats; over a fine Linnen Surplice, a Black Cloke, co∣ver'd with a gray upper Garment, each carrying a long Torch lighted, made of Pine-Branches, which (they say) lights the Defunct, that he may not mistake or miss the Way. These thirty are follow'd by two hundred more, who call aloud upon that God or Idol which he most Worshipp'd, when alive. They also beat on great Copper Basons, and carry two large Baskets, full of Artificial Paper-Roses, of divers Colours, which they tie at the end of a long Stick, shaking them as they go in such a manner, that the Roses fly out of the Baskets; that being a sign, as they say, That the Soul of the Deceas'd is already gone to the Place of Everlasting Happiness. After these, follow eight Youths, young Bonzies, in two Rows; who trail after them long Canes, with Flags, each Inscrib'd with the Name of his Idol: They also carry eight Lanthorns, with lighted Candles, which in stead of Horn are cover'd with fine Cotton: Near these Lanthorn-carriers walk two Youths, in gray Clothes, which carry also Pine-Torches, which they light when they come out of the City, and with these kindle the Fire that must consume the dead Body. The remaining Ceremo∣ny.Next before the Corps walk a great number of People, all in gray Clothes, their Heads cover'd with little three-corner'd Caps of black shining Leather, on which they pin small Papers, written with the Name of his Idol: And that it may be more conspicuous, a Man follows, which carries in a Frame, in large Characters, the Name of that God he had so much ador'd. The Corps it self.Then follows the Corps it self, which is carried by four Men, on a Bier, cover'd with a Bed very richly adorn'd, on which sits the dead Body, with his Head bent forward, and his Hands folded together being cloth'd all in white; over which hangs a Paper Coat, being a Book concerning the Mysterious De∣votions belonging to his Deity, and full of Prayers, That he would be pleas'd in mercy to save him. After the Corps, follow the Sons of the Deceas'd, in comely Habits, the youngest Son carrying also a Torch of Pine, to kindle the Funeral-Pyre. Last of all, comes a second Rabble of Common People, suited with black Caps, as the former. How the dead are burnt in Japan.When coming near the Pyle, they stand in a Ring, and soon after make a hideous Noise, the Bonzies striking with great force on their Copper Basons and Kettles, and all the People calling aloud on the Name of his Idol, which con∣tinues a whole Hour; during which they prepare the Pit, being square, and Rail'd about, and hung with Mats: Towards the four Points of Heaven are four Entrances, being the East, West, North, and South. The Pit is cover'd over with Canvas, and on each side of it stands a Table, with all manner of
Fruits, near the Table, Pots smoking with Perfumes and Frankincense; no soon∣er they approach near the Inclosed place, but they throw a long Rope over the Corps, on which every one lays their hands, and call on the name of their Idol, several times together, then they walk three times about the inclosed place. At last they set the Bier with the Bed, and Corps on the Funeral-pyre, to which, the Bonzi who Conducted the whole Train, steps forth and Mutters se∣veral Words, which none of those that are present can understand, and takes a burning Torch which he Waves three times over the Head of the Dead Body, signifying by those Circles, that the Soul of the Deceased had never beginning, nor shall ever have an end; when done, he throws away the Torch, which two of the nearest Relations to the Deceased, whereof one stands at the East end of the Bier, and the other at the West, as a Ceremony, reaching it over the Corps to one another thrice together; then they throw it on the Pyle, whilest others pour on Sweet Oil; then setting Fire, which kindles so suddenly, and grows to that height, that the Body is consum'd in a moment. Strange Custom when the body is burnt.In the Interim, his Sons and kindred walk towards the two Tables, where setting Fire to the Pots, with Perfumes, they fall on their Knees, and Worship the Deceased, then, as they believe, to be in Heaven; This finish'd, their Bonzies are rewarded according to their several Services, and the Chief Orderer of the Funeral receives at least twenty Duckets, and the other Officers lesser Sums. After the departure of the Friends and Bonzies to their several Houses, then the Common People, and those which were Habited in Grey, make merry about the Fire, with such Food, as stands on the Tables. On the next day, the Children and Friends of the Deceased repair again to the Funeral Fire, where they gather the Ashes, Teeth, and Bones in a Gilded Pot or Urn, which they carry home, and covering it over with a Cloth, set it in one of the chief Rooms of the House. Make repetition Sermon, after what manner.Thither all the Bonzies come, to make a Repetition of the Funeral Sermon; On the seventh day they begin their Visit, and set the Urn with the Relicks on the Ground; others set down a square Stone, on which is Engraven the Name of the Idol: After this, the Sons go daily to their Father's Grave, on which they strow Roses, and place hot Liquor, and set several Dishes of Meat about it, so that their Father's Soul may be refresh'd. Bon, a dead Fast.But besides these Funerals, which commonly cost those that are able at least three thousand Duckets, and the ordinary Citizens generally two, or three hun∣dred: They keep on one day yearly a general Feast through the whole City, which they call Bon, dedicated to all the souls of their deceas'd friends, on which day each hangs a Lanthorn and Candle at his Door, and all visit the Graves of their several Relations, great multitudes carrying out of the City Chargers full of Variety of Cates, with which they Treat (as they believe) their departed Spi∣rits, then inviting them home to their Houses; of which we have already spoke at large. Description of a mourn∣ing Japanner.¶ MOreover, it is worthy our Observation, how the Japanners behave them∣selves after the Burying of the Inurn'd Relicks; they mourn two year very strictly, abstaining all that while from all manner of Pleasures and De∣lights: Their Habits expressing great signs of Sorrow, wearing Caps on their Heads, flat on the top, square before like a Cap, and spreading broad behind, hanging down like a Vail to their Hams; their Coats exceeding wide, which they fold athwart their Breasts, and hold their Hands in a sad Posture within their Sleeves; this Coat may neither be Lac'd nor Embroider'd, but is only ty'd
about with a broad Girdle; below their Coat, their Breeches appear, hanging over their Feet like a Sack; all their Clothes are made of brown Linnen, with∣out being ever Bleach'd. The corps of poor peo∣ple misused.The Funerals of the Poor People are no way to be compar'd to those of the Rich, for not one Bonzi follows their Dead, they having no Money for to sa∣tisfie them for their Labor, without which they will not budge one Foot, so that they onely take care for to provide Food for the Departed Souls; and the more, because most of them, either publick or private, are against the Immor∣tality of the Soul; therefore the Dead Bodies of the Poor (of which there are very great numbers in Japan) they throw in the night time, in some private place or other, or else upon the nearest Dunghil. Departure of the Nether∣land Ambassadors from Je∣do.¶ BUt to return again to our Ambassadors, upon their departure from Jedo, where having found no opportunity nor time to visit the Emperors Tomb in Niko, whose Lustre was made the greater, by the Branch'd Candle∣stick given by the East-India Company, to the Japan Emperor, as being Cast of Copper, and brought from Holland, such a long and tedious Voyage. The Lords, Frisius and Brookhurst taking their leave, from Jedo proceeded on in their Journey to Nangesaque, on the 16 of April, Anno 1650. and having pass'd Sinagawa, Rokna, Cawasacca, Cammagawa, Fundaga, and Moska, they espy'd the fa∣mous Temple of Apes; the whole world shows not the like, if you look upon the strangeness of the Building, and the manner of the celebrated Rites, it is notoriously known, that Egypt was full of the like Superstition, and mad Wor∣ship, holding for their gods, which they held in great Adoration, all sorts of Beasts and Monsters: All Writers commonly affirm, That their chief gods were Apis, and Osiris, the one, a living black Ox, with a white Head, broad Back, and shaggy Hair, which was to live no longer than the set time limited by the Egyptian Laws; then a general Fast-day was order'd to be kept very strictly, on which the Ox call'd Serapis,Strange dealing with the Ox Apis. was Drowned in a Consecrated Lake; on
whose death, as being their god Apis, all Egypt Mourned, both Old and Young Lamenting, with striking on their Breasts, tearing the Hair off their Heads; but when they found another of the same Colour, and shape, the whole Coun∣trey rejoyc'd thereat, setting him in the same place; they generally Feasted, but this their dumb god could not answer as the Delphick Oracle, nor the Dodan Oak, nor Jupiter Ammon, but by eating Fodder out of their hands, that was a good Omen to the Inquirer that proffer'd it, but if he refus'd, that they look'd upon as ill Fortune; for which cause, when he refus'd the Food which Caesar Germanicus proffer'd him, he after despair'd, expecting his utter Ruine. Osiris, what manner of Ox.But their Osiris was a Grey Ox, with a Dogs head, holding in one Foot a Scepter, Emblematically expressing his Omnipotent Power and Godly Au∣thority. The Ancient Egyptian Kings, us'd to offer Men and Women on the Grave of Osiris; yet this cruel Sacrifice in process of time was chang'd, Offering onely a red Ox, by reason it suited best with Typhon's Colour, which they say, slew Osiris. Of this also hear what Pliny says, In Egypt an Ox is worship'd for a god,Plin. lib. 8. Cab. which they call Apis, who gives Responses of good or bad Fortune, by taking or refusing the Food which the Injur'd presents with his own Hands; who taking a dislike to that which Ger∣manicus proffer'd, refusing, would not eat, who soon after unfortunately dy'd: This Apis is continually kept private, but when he appears publickly, he is accompany'd with a great number of Children, singing Elodiums to his praise, which he seems to understand and ac∣cept of. Strabo says thus, In Heliopolis stands a Dedicated Temple to the Sun, and Ox Mne∣vis,Strabo Geog. lib. 17. which is fed in an inclos'd corner, and by the People Worshipp'd; as at Memphis is their Ox Apis. Herodotus tells us, That the Egyptians Worshipp'd a Cat,Herodot. in Euterp. which if she dy'd in their Houses, they Salted and Bury'd her in a stately manner, carrying her to Bubastis, to be Inter'd there in the Holy City: The like Cicero, Diodorus, Siculus, Plutarch, and Juve∣nal testifie. As to what Clemens Romanus, or rather an unknown Writer by his Name,Clem. Rom. l. 5. Retognit. Writes concerning the foremention'd Worship, deserves peculiar Observa∣tion: Some Egyptians, says he, have learnt, That an Ox, call'd Apis, must be Wor∣shipped and Ador'd; others, a Goat, others Cats, some an Egyptian Bird, call'd Iphis, which feeds on Serpents; others held of a Fish, call'd Ajun, and many other such Ridicu∣lous Creatures, that I am asham'd to name, for a God. Clemens Alexandrinus relates, That the Saitae and Thebans Worshipp'd a Sheep,Clem. Alex. Adm. ad Gent. and the Lycopolitans, a Wolf; that those of Leopolis honor'd a Lion, as being the King of all four footed Beasts; for which reason also the Persians Picture their god Mithra, which presents the Sun, with a Lions Head. Plutarch tells us the reason why a Lion is Dedicated to the Sun,Plut. lib. 4. Symp. 4, 5. viz. Because Lions, amongst all Beasts with Claws, bears onely one young one; and that they are very watchful, and sleep little, and their eyes shining, being open when they sleep: And at last, because the Leontines when the Sun passes through the Sign of Leo, find all their Fountains and Pits full of Water. Strabo writes of the Mendesiers,Stran. Goe. l. 17. Aelian de Animal. l. 10. c. 23. That they promoted a Goat and Buck to Religious Honor. Aelianus relates, How the Coptists eat their tame Goats, but to their wild ones they shew'd great Adoration, because they were a delight to the goddess Isis.
Other Egyptians reckon their Goats amongst the number of their gods, be∣cause that according to Diodorus Siculus, it hath Genitals like a man; for which reason the Greeks and Latins honor'd their Priapus. Herodotus relates,Herodot. In Euterp. That the Mendesiers show'd much sorrow upon the death of a great Goat-heard, in relation to his Imployment, they holding Goats in great Veneration. The Egyptians and Greeks also Picture their Idol Pan with a Goats Face and Feet, notwithstanding they believ'd, that he was like the other gods. Women make themselves common with Goats.The same Herodotus relates also, That the Mendesier Women make themselves common with Goats, that so they might obliege them, and be big, and bear Children, by their Sacred Seed. Strabo witnesseth, That the Athribites held a small Creature brought forth, by a Mouse, Rat, and Weasel, for their god. Plutarch tells us the reason why these miserable People Worship such a vile Beast as their Creator; Because it is Born in a new Moon, and his Liver decays at the decrease thereof. Strange things done by the Indian Mfee.The Indian Rat is Dedicated to Latona, and Ilithya, or Lucina, which main∣tains a continual War with the Viper and Crocodile, with both which Egypt is much troubled, and therefore the Rats are accounted worthy of Religious ho∣nor, because they destroy both. But not all the Egyptians Worship the Indian Mice, for some Adore the Crocodile, and despise the Mice, because they break the Crocodiles Eggs, and also kill them; for when the Crocodiles lie beaking with open mouth in the Sun, the Mouse leaps in, and there gnaws their Bow∣els asunder, and makes his way out through their Bellies. These Worshippers of so opposite a Religion, one Adoring the Rat, the other the Crocodile, are not onely at variance among themselves, which often grows to War, but they prosecute and destroy the Creatures where ever they find them; the Crocodilians destroy all the Rats and Ingnumons where ever they find them; and those that put their trust in Rats, destroy without mercy all Crocodiles. Besides Strabo,Juvenal. sat. 15. Cicero, Diodorus Siculus, Juvenal, Plutarch, and Aelianus, wit∣ness, How the Egyptian Ombits worshipped the Crocodiles with as great Zeal, as the Greeks and Latins did their gods; but the Apolletick Egyptians curs'd their Crocodile, because Tiphon transform'd into a Crocodile, slew Osiris; and also because the Daughter of Psammymitus King of Egypt, was likewise devour'd by a Crocodile. Moreover he relates,Strab. Geog. lib. 17. How that the Psyli, a People in Cyreen, and the Egyptian Tentyrietes have a private Charm against Serpents, and the other against Crocodiles, which they can both order according to their pleasure.Crocodile by whom ta∣ken, without prejudice. The Tentyrietes dive without any fear, to the bottom of deep Lakes and Rivers after the Crocodiles, and kill them with great ease; to which end, when they were to shew this amongst their publick Shows in Rome, they leapt into the Water, and fetch'd them up to the open view of the whole Concourse. The same Strabo relates also of Arsino, formerly call'd the Crocodile City, That the Priests there feed those Beasts with Cakes, Flesh, and Wine, which was brought as an Offering by strangers, and laid near a Consecrated Lake. Maximus Tyrius dissert. 31. Miracle of a Crocodile.¶ MAximus Tyrius relates, That an Egyptian Woman feeding and breeding up a young Crocodile, was accounted holy by the Egyptians, because she Nurs'd a Deity, and therefore both she and the Crocodile were daily Worshipp'd by many of the Egyp∣tians. This Woman also had a Son, about the same Age as the Crocodile; a long time the Youth and the Serpent agreed playing together, but at last growing old, and fierce with hunger, he prey'd upon the Boy, and eat him up; the Mother being much amaz'd at
this sad accident, yet she esteem'd her Son happy, because the Crocodile which she held for a god, had devour'd him. By this ignorance of the Heathens, appears plainly Gods Wrath and Di∣vine Judgements, men Adoring in the presence of a Never-dying and Om∣nipotent God, that which is not onely Mortal and Frail, but much Inferior to themselves: But who can give us a better account, and the reason of Wor∣shipping of Beasts, than the never-failing School-master of the Heathens? I will here set down the whole words written in the first Epistle to the Romans;Rom. 1. v. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Be∣cause that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shew'd it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse. Because that when they knew God, they glorifi'd him not as God, nei∣ther were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was dark∣ned. Professing themselves to be wise, they became Fools: and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed Beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to unleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipp'd and serv'd the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. There is scarce one living Creature either on the Earth, Sea, or Air, which the Heathens do not worship. Strabo saith thus of the Egyptians,Strab. Geogr. lib. 17. There are some Beasts which they serve joyntly, three of them inhabiting the Earth, as an Ox, a Dog, and a Cat; Of flying Fowls, the Hawk, and the Bird Ibis; Of Fishes, those call'd Lepidotus, and Oxyrinchus; Besides these, there are also other Creatures which they serve; For the Saiten and Thebans, adore a Sheep; the Latopolitans, the Fish Latus, which swims in the River Nyle; the Lycopolitans, a Wolf; the Hermopolitans, the Baboon, whose head is like that of a Dog; the Babylonians, living near Memphis, an Ape; these Apes are like Satyrs, half their bodies like Dogs, the other half resembles a Bear, they are bred in the Moors Countrey. The Thebans Worship a Crane; the Leontines, a Lion; the Mandesiers, a Ram; others Worship other Deities, about which they maintain great and hot Disputations. Out of these Testimonies of the Greek and Latin Writers, of which some li∣ved before, after, or about the time of our Saviours Birth; and the undisputa∣ble Testimonies written by the Apostle St. Paul; we may easily Conjecture, that not onely the Idolatrous Worshipping of Beasts is very Ancient, but chie∣fly with ugly and deform'd Baboons, and Monkies, nay there is scarce one Beast which the Heathens worshipp'd more than the Ape. Not far from Toska through this Village, the Netherland Ambassadors, Frisius, and Brookhurst travell'd. In their return to Nangesaque, on the 18 of Aug. 1650. stands The Temple of Apes, famous through all Japan, the Structure is no less Arti∣ficial than Costly. Description of the Tem∣ple of Apes in Japan.¶ IN the middle Isle stands a high Woodden Altar, the undermost part about half a mans heighth is square with two Ledges; on the top of this stands a second Square; but a third part less than the undermost, whose top being broad, with handsome Mouldings, which jet out of each corner; every side of the Altar curiously Carv'd, and a great Copper Bason lies on the lower Square of the Altar; near which stands a Bonzi, which strikes on the
same with great force, to the end, that by that noise, the Congregation may be stirr'd up to a greater Zeal in their Devotion, who prostrate themselves, lying on their Knees, Elbows, and Fore-heads on the ground; on both sides of the Temple, the Walls of which are full of Neeches, in which sit several living Apes, to which the Japanners make their Oraisons; above the Neeches jet out like Evens, but are square, and stand straight; on the top of which, many Apes Carv'd in several Postures, some lying all along, others sitting, and standing upright, are plac'd: Against the Walls, also several square Pedestals curiously Graven, against which the nethermost seem to be Apes, the rest be∣tween each of these Pedestals, are several larger Neeches, in which are other Carv'd Apes; but next to the Bonzi which Plays on the Bason, stand several Inferior Ministers, that help him to perform this his Divine Service: At the farther end of the Temples sit on a broad Ledge, not far from the Roof above all the other, several Figures of Monkies, before which are daily plac'd great Dishes full of variety of Meat. It deserves no small wonder, that these Temples of Apes were not onely before the Birth of our Savior, for the Hermopolitans, and Babylonians (according to the testimony of Strabo) Worshipp'd Baboons and Monkies, above eighteen hun∣dred years since. The Religion of Apes ve∣ry antient, and spread over Asia.¶ ANd how far this shameful Worshipping of Apes is spread over Asia, may hereby appear; for it is not onely usual in Japan and China, but also in the Territory of the Malabaers, and the Wild Countrey, between Macaw and Pegu, and the Island Cylore, where they set up Apes for their gods. The famous Italian Balbus, relates in his Voyage from Macaw and Pegu, How that amongst the Indian Idols, which they call Pagods, he found that they generally Wor∣shipped Apes, and also living Baboons, which they Chain'd in their Varralloes, for so the Indians call the Isles of their Temples.
Who discover'd Ceylon.It is worth observing what the Learned Vossius, hath taken out of Linschot: The Island Ceylon, which the Portuguese Writer, Johannis Barruis affirms, with se∣veral pregnant Reasons, to be the antient Taprobana, discover'd by Francois Al∣meida his Son, who was to pillage the Saracen Merchants, which Trade along the Maldivian Islands, from the Molluco's to Arabia, but missing of them, set up∣on Ceylon: after which the Portuguese General Soarius obtain'd leave of the King of the Western part of Ceylon, that he might raise a Fort there near the Sea-side; but whilst they were busie in building the same, the King being inveigl'd by the Saracen Merchants, that they would be a great hindrance to them in their Cinamon-Trade, he set upon them with some thousands of Men,Wars between the Ceylo∣nians and the Portuguese. which pro∣ved at first a sharp Assault, because the Portuguese never in the least suspected to be so treacherously surpriz'd. But the General Soarius soon after putting his Men in order, they made such a valiant Resistance, that they forc'd the King to pay for his falshood towards them, an hundred and twenty thousand Pound of Cinamon, twelve Diamond Rings, and six Elephants yearly. For a defence against the Islanders, the Fort Colombo was well fortifi'd; yet it was not so strongly built, but that it decay'd and fell to the Ground, which made Lupus Brittus to be sent thither with several Workmen to repair the Fort; where arriving, and being busie to prepare Mortar, Stones, and other Neces∣saries for the re-building, the Saracens again spurring up the Ceylonians against the Portuguese, they a second time Sally'd out upon them; but first the City Colomba refus'd to sell the Portuguese Provisions, after that they slew all those that they found stragling from the Fort. The Portuguese being thus troubl'd Sally'd out of their Castle, and fell into the City Colomba, upon which the Ci∣tizens deserted the same, leaving their Wives and Children in possession, so that Brittus without the least resistance became Master of the City, but strictly forbad all his Men from committing any outrages, onely he caus'd the Wo∣men and Children to be ty'd to the Threshold at their Doors; which he did partly to, manifest, that he intended no cruelty to the Ceylonians, and partly, that if possible, by that his kind dealing with them, he might gain their Affecti∣ons. This Conquest had almost prov'd the utter ruinie of the Portuguese; for those that fled from Colomba fetch'd all the Forces that they could possibly get together, and being spurr'd on by their Affections towards their Wives and Children, set, like hungry Lyons, upon the City: Thus the Portuguese seeing utter ruine threaten them, they saw no other way to release themselves but by firing the City, which the Townsmen perceiving, left to Storm, and endea∣vor'd all of them to quench the Fire, and to unbind their Wives and Children; during which time most of the Portuguese got into their Castle, which else would have been taken by the Natives. But this business rested not so, for the Ceylonians soon gather'd twenty thou∣sand Men together, and besieging them in their Fort, rais'd Works about the Fort, with six hundred Iron Mortar-pieces fix'd on them, in the day-time throwing Darts, which wounded two hundred Paces distance,Remarkable Arms of the Ceylonians. and in the night-time Granado's, which burnt their Huts. The Besieged, though few in number, yet wanted all manner of Necessaries, without which they were not able to subsist a Day, and being driven to the worst of Exigencies, they made a Vertue of Necessity, and Sally'd out with three hundred and fifty Men, which Fought so valiantly, that with small resistance they beat their Enemies from their Works: But the Enemy was not so baffled, but drew up one Company for a Field-Battel, having two hundred and fifty Elephants in the Front, with
Wooden Towers, Planted with Cannon on their Backs, their Noses, or Snouts, Arm'd with sharp Scythes, which whisking to and fro, they could Mow down all those which came near them; behind these follow'd the Cingalessers, being the Foot well Arm'd, the right and left Flank Wing'd each with an hun∣dred and fifty Horse: At first sight the Portuguese were struck with a general consternation, and even ready to quit the Field, when one of the Enemies Ele∣phants being wounded, retreated disorderly, routing those that were next him, so opening a Breach, at which the Portuguese falling in like a Torrent, suddenly dissipated their whole Army, and making great slaughters, became Master of the Fieldl; and at last the Portuguese, recruited with fresh Supplies, took the City Ceylon, destroying all with the Sword and Fire, Anno 1654. Pico de Adam.¶ ON this Island is one of the highest Mountains in India, call'd Pico de Adam, or Adams Hill; for the Congaleans affirm, that Adam was Created there, the print of whose footsteps hewn in Stone, as they say, are to be seen yet. On the top of this Mountain stands a magnificent Temple, held then to be full of Treasure and other Rarities of an inestimable value, the hope of which Booty drew the lucrative Portuguese thither, but found nothing according to the report, or their expectation, onely a Golden Cabinet, inchased with Pre∣cious Stones and Diamonds, in which lay inclos'd an Apes Tooth. An Apes Tooth valued at seventy thousand DucatsIn what esteem or adoration the Ceylondians had this Relick, may appear by the trouble, charges, and proffers, which, they made for the redemption thereof; for they in solemn manner sent Ambassadors of special Quality, who made Address to the Portuguese, tendring seventy thousand Ducats to be re-possess'd of the same. The Portuguese would fain have been nibling, and at sharing of so vast a Sum for so pitiful a trifle: But Gaster the Bishop utterly withstood it, affirm∣ing, that nothing could be more impious or contradictory to the true Belie∣vers of the Christian Faith, than to uphold by any means, directly or indi∣rectly, any thing whatsoever belong'd to the maintenance of false Worship and Superstition of the Heathen, and therefore order'd the Tooth to be burnt, and the Ashes to be thrown into the Sea. But besides the Congaleans,Strabo Geog. 1.17. the Hemopolitans also (according to Strabo) wor∣ship an Ape. ¶ IT deserves no small admiration, that the Japanners, and other Heathens stoop to such vile Creatures, and worship them as their God, being themselves Men, and Aspirers to greater excellencies: Yet we may find, that the Antients, upon seeming good Reasons, held several Beasts, and despicable Creatures in such great adoration, having by long practice made observation, by their Looks and Postures foretelling future Presages, and present Discove∣ries, which have oftner hit than otherwise. Cicero affirming this,Cicero 1.2. de Nat. Deor. saith thus: The Egyptians are falsly aspersed concerning the worshipping of Creatures, for they adore none but upon good accounts, and some benefit or other which they receive from them: as in the first place the Bird Ibis, a great destroyer of Venomous Serpents. I could also say something on the nature of the Indian Mice, Croco∣diles, and Cats, but that I am not willing to enlarge this Discourse, yet I will conclude, that the Heathens worship their Beasts for benefits which they receive from them. Lucan also tells us, That the Egyptians had found out more than the Moretani∣ans had done heretofore; for they divided the Heavens with the Stars into
twelve Houses, in which Signs are several Constellations, look'd upon by their Learning, or help of Imagination, to personate, as fix'd there, several sorts of Creatures, as Gods, Hero's, Men, Monsters, and several sorts of Fishes. And therefore the Egyptians have divers Worships, for their Soothsayers us'd not onely the Planets, which are as their gods, but make their Responses from the Configuration of the several Signs, which are inferior Creatures. First,Lucianus de Astrol. they worship a Ram which they have from Aries: they touch no Fish which resem∣bles the Sign Pisces; neither will they kill a Goat, because of Capricorn; and the Bull, for the sake of Taurus, they hold in the like estimation. The Apes re∣quiring a peculiar Worship, the Inhabitants Consecrated a peculiar Prayer. Lucan saith, That the Lybians worshipp'd the famous Jupiter Ammon, in the manner of a Ram, as being one of the twelve Celestial Signs, to whom the Heathens came from all Parts to know future Events. Moreover, he saith some of these Worshippers of Beasts did not adore them as gods, but because they were Consecrated to their Deities, and for their good Deeds shewn either to the gods or men; and therefore at Delphis, according to Aelianus, a Wolf was religiously honor'd, because he gave direction of the sa∣cred stoln Gold, buried in the Mountain Parnassus. The Ambraciots worshipp'd a Lyonness, after the Tyrant Phayllus was de∣vour'd by one big with Young. Aristotle tells us, That the Citizens of Troas worshipp'd the Mice,Arist. Rhetor. L. 2. because they gnaw'd their Enemies Bow-strings when they were at War with them. Moreover, some of the Heathens, and also the Japanners believ'd, That the Souls of Men by death were transmigrated into Beasts, and therefore they wor∣ship not the Beast it self, but the Souls of Men which resided in them. Apollonius Tyancus perswaded the Alexandrians,Philostr. in Vit. Apollon. That a tame Lyon which he had was the Egyptian King Amasis; for which reason the Priests made Offerings to this suppos'd Amasis, adorning the Beast with Golden Armlets, and Collars, and in that manner sent him to the farthermost Parts in Egypt, Singing before him religious Hymns and Praises of their god. In Leontopolis they erected a stately Temple, because Apollonius said, That it was not fitting that the powerful King Amasis, whose Soul was transmigrated into a Lyon, should go a begging from Door to Door for his Food. But chiefly the Apes seem to afford the best Residences for humane Souls, because they resemble a Man both in outward Shape, and within,Humane Bodies. as Aristotle affirms: wherefore Physicians, when they want humane Bodies, often Anato∣mize an Ape. Galen calls an Ape an imperfect resemblance of a Man,Arist. L. 2. Hist. Anim. Coel. Resp. L. 3. C. 10. as Coelius Rodignius relates of him. What more resembles Humane Shape, Than the vile ridiculous Ape? Tulp's Description of an Ape.¶ THe Lord Nicholas Tulp tells us of a Baboon sent from Angola to Fre∣derick Prince of Orange, which was call'd by the Indians, Ourang Outang, was as tall as a Child of three years old, and as big as one of six, neither Fat nor Lean, but well in case, with strong Thighs, Bald before, and over∣grown behind with black Hair, his Face also hairy, resembling a Toothless old Woman, the Ears like those of a Man, on his Belly an indented Navel, the Hands and Feet perfect with Fingers and Toes, so that his foremost Parts were altogether Man, who often walkt upright, and would carry a handsom Burthen: when it Drank it lifted up the Lid of the Pot with one Hand, and held the Ear with the other, and when having Drunk, orderly wip'd its Lips:
when he went to sleep he commonly laid his Head higher than his Body, neat∣ly covering himself like a young Maiden in her Bed. Moreover, the foremention'd Tulp relates, That the King of Sambaces, told Samuel Blomert, that the Baboons in the Island Borneo dare encounter with Arm∣ed Men, and will set upon Women; and if by their kindness and courtship they cannot vitiate, they will force them. Therefore by reason of the great resem∣blance of Apes and Men, the Japanners are of opinion, and chiefly those that believe the Pythagorean Doctrine concerning Transmigration, That the Souls of deceased Kings and Emperors reside in Apes. The Bonzies call'd Neu∣gori, how they live.¶ THe Netherland Ambassadors left the Temple of Apes near Toska, and came on the eleventh day after their departure from Jedo, on the seven and twentieth of April to Meaco, the chiefest City for Trade in Japan: wherein are erected several Cloysters of the Bonzi, in which the Penitentiaries are Lockt up, that will take their leave of this World: yet account it no sin to com∣mit all manner of Vices without the least regret; in which wickedness those exceed, which have promoted Cacubaw to be a god. The Sect call'd Neugori are divided into three Degrees or Sections, for some of them Pray continually, others study and exercise themselves in Martial Discipline, and the rest make daily a set number of Arrows. And because they acknowledge no Superior, nor chief Commander, they carry on business in great disorder: The oldest give their Votes first, which if any one oppose, the business falls, so that all jangle and disagree: which Consultation the Bonzies break up till the Evening; and when grown dark, they decide their business with the Sword, and often kill one another, though their Religion strictly forbids them to hurt a Mouse, or kill the smallest Flye. The Netherland Ambas∣sadors take a survey of Meaco.¶ FUrthermore, as to what concerns Meaco, it is much adorn'd by the Pala∣ces of the Emperor Cubus Taikosama, and also that of the Payro. In this City the Ambassadors stay'd till the thirtieth of April, and being in∣vited
on a Day by the Master of the House where they lay, and one of the Bongois, to view some of the chiefest Buildings in the City, they were carry'd with several other Merchants in Sedans, often standing still to admire the cost∣liness and magnificence of their several Temples and Towers; after which being scarce satisfi'd with viewing the beauty of the various Edifices, they were carry'd to a Musick-Lecture, where the Master of their Lodgings had provided a handsom Collation for them; which done, they in the dusk of the Evening return'd to their House. Description of the Em∣peror Cubo's Palace.But amongst those famous Buildings which they view'd, none seem'd so rich and stately as the Palace of the Emperor Cubo. Lodowick Frojus, an eye-witness, relates, That he had not seen the like Fa∣brick, neither in Europe, nor all India. The Gardens which encompass it are surrounded with Cedar, Cypress, Pyne, and Orange-Trees, besides many others, whose Names are to us un∣known; which are all Planted in such a decent order, that they represent ma∣ny fair Arbors; the Lilies, Roses, and other Flowers which deck the Garden Beds, also amaze the beholders, not onely for their sweet Smells, and various Colours, but also their strange manner of Setting them. The Governor of Mea∣co's Palace.The Governor's Palace of Meaco merits also observation; behind whose Privy-Lodgings is a marvellous Garden, which is not onely artificially adorn'd with Imagery, Trees and Plants, but a River in the middle, cut through Rocks, and runs up above nine thousand Paces. This River, or Lake is shaded on both sides with all manner of delightful Trees; the middle every where sprink∣led with Isles; which are all conjoyn'd with Stone-Bridges. The Cloysters of the Bonzi in a Grove.Not far from the City appears a pleasant Grove, which shadeth fifty large and spacious Cloysters of the Bonzi, where most of the Royal Youth have their Education, sent thither to ease their Parents of the charge of bringing them up; yet all pay great Admittances, which are to be disbursed in the enlarging and beautifying of their Colledges, each striving to outvie one another in greatness, lustre, and conveniency. Lodowick Frojus viewing one of them saith thus: I went, being led by some that had newly embrac'd the Christian Faith, through a Door curiously varnish'd, into a Cloyster of the Bonzi: behind the fore Gate was an open Court, Pav'd with black square Stone, and surrounded with a large Gallery, the Walls underneath being also Varnish'd, shine very curiously; next to this Court lay a stately Garden, where neither Art nor Cost had been spar'd, several rising Grounds, or Mounts being made in the same of polish'd Marble, neatly joyn'd together: the tops of these Hillocks crown'd with Trees, were all made passable to one another with Stone-Bridges: the Ground underneath being a course and glittering Sand, mix'd with small black Shells, betwixt which were Planted all sorts of Flowers, which grow in such a manner, that not one day in the year but some of them flourish'd in their full beauty; so that there seems to be a continual Spring there, and a per∣petual Paradice. The King of Devils Tem∣ple.Within this Wood also stands a Temple dedicated to the Prince of Devils; his Image very terrible to behold, grasping a Scepter in his right Hand, two other horrible Representations standing on each side, that on the left holding a Book, wherein is registred (as they say) all the Transactions of Mankind, the other seems to Read what the former hath Written. The Walls every where are Painted with various and exquisite tortures and torments of Hell, which (as they believe) are inflicted for the manifold sins and offences committed by all sorts of People, of what degree soever.
There is scarce a Temple in Japan which hath greater resort than this, the People bringing great Sums of Money thither to buy Pardons, and purchase Indulgences, to quit Scores, and clear them from the Punishments that they may be condemn'd to for their sins after this mortal Life. Yet above all the Buildings in Meaco, the Dayro's Palace is the most magni∣ficent, and of greatest splendor, excelling most of those Fabricks that in anti∣ent times were accounted famous.The fore-Gate of the Dayro; Court. The Portico through which the Dayro goes forth and enters, makes a stately Frontispiece, before which an Arch'd Por∣tal, whose Roof jetting beyond the Walls, hath on each Corner a Golden Ball, adding more lustre; near which on each side a large Gallery, and in each of them four ample Apartments with Vaulted Cielings, each Room having nine Windows on every side, serve for Courts of Guard, fitted for a Garrison of Sol∣diers: on the outermost Wall, between the upper and lower Story, are curi∣ous Imagery, Varnish'd after the Indian manner, and next the Roof of the Gal∣lery hangs out a Flag, or Ensign, with the Dayro's Arms. Description of the Bul∣warks.To this joyns the Wall which surrounds the whole Court, being full of Bulwarks and Battlements, hath also many fair Watch-houses, built in the in-side: But within the fore-mention'd first Gate is a large and spacious Court, Pav'd with Free-Stone, which when the Dayro is carry'd through, is always throng'd with a concourse of People; he sits in a large Sedan,The Dayro's Sedan. carry'd by fourteen Men very richly Cloth'd; the Sedan of a long square, rises sloaping from each Corner, and ends in the middle in a small Golden Pyramid; the four sides are Window'd with a thin Silk, through which he may see whomsoever he please, yet cannot be seen by any: This Sedan rests on long Poles, which the Bearers carry on their Shoulders; before him Rides his Life-guard, on each side of him thousands of Japanners pro∣strate their Faces, that so in his passing by they may worship him. His sumptuous Train.Behind the Dayro's Sedan follows a Coach drawn by two Horses, whose Heads are adorn'd with stately Plumes, Caparison'd with Furniture, Embroi∣der'd with Pearls and Diamonds, and led by two of his Servants by their Reins; between the Horses and the Coach go two Men, one carrying a large Fan, with which to cool, he continually agitates the Air; the other carrying a great Umbrello. This Coach (in which the Dayro's Royal Consort sits) is follow'd by above twenty Chariots, each having two wheels, and are drawn by as many Horses, which are led by the Reins of their Bridles: In these the Dayro's Concubines are carry'd: they can see all Passengers through their fine silken Windows, making every angle of the Chariot transparent like the Dayro's; on each side attends in great Trains their Maids and Ladies of Honor, which are also ac∣company'd by divers of the Dayro's Attendants , all Cloth'd in rich Apparel, which make a glorious and delightful show. Moreover, on each side of the foremention'd open Court stand several Pa∣laces, built after divers fashions, but all of them so rich and beautiful, that Art seems to have play'd so well her part on them, that they requir'd no less than an Emperor's Revenue for the erecting of them. Hs Kitchins.Behind are the Kitchins of the Dayro, from whence the several Dishes with variety of Meats, which are daily above a hundred, are carry'd between the Seraglio and the Garden, to the Dayro; they are very large, having several Officers belonging thereto, whose Table-expences amount yearly to many Tun of Gold.
The Dayro's Court in Miaco. das Sehlos des dairo ze Miaco. Hof van den DAYRO le MIAKO
A pleasant Garden.Behind these also is an exceeding pleasant Garden; inclos'd with high Walls; which have in some Places large Towers full of spacious Rooms; and that which makes it the more delightful to behold, is a round Palace, which in the middle of the Garden rises aloft with high Turrets, the Trees all very artifici∣ally Planted in rank and file, the Flowers and other Plants stand divided in several Beds; and many other Curiosities in this Place are sufficient testimo∣nies, that Nature, Cost, and Art, have joyn'd all their Forces together to exceed that famous Temple in Thessalie, and the Gardens of Adonis, at large describ'd by antient Poets. Description of the Day∣ro's Court.In the midst of all these sumptuous Edifices and delightful Gardens, stands most intimate, the Palace where the Dayro hath his Residence; which rising aloft with several Roofs towards the Sky, is environ'd by a stony Wall, adorn'd with many Images; whose Entrance ascends on fifteen broad Copper Steps, guarded at the bottom on each side with two Watch-houses built uniform, being square, have a large Door, several wide Windows, and the Walls very neatly Painted, the Roof jetting over at the four Angles of the Wall, and ta∣pering aloft, is cover'd with gilded Boards, the Ridge alfo adorn'd with golden Balls. The Garden thereof.Next these Watch-houses lies his private Garden, enclos'd with a peculiar Wall, at whose corners are Banquetting-houses, built with eight Angles; the Roof of which rising Canopy-wise, ends in a sharp Pinnacle. The delight∣fulness of this Garden can scarce be express'd. Very costly fore Cate.Concerning the Palace it self, on the top of the foremention'd Copper Steps appears the Portico, supported on each side with eight stately Columns, cover'd with golden Plates, curiously Engraven; the middle Roof jets out a little over the other; this also adorn'd with Imagery. The Arch is exceeding costly, being richly gilded on each Corner, the Floor cover'd with polish'd Marble, which shines like Glass. Behind this Porch appears a high and spacious Court, which being so exactly Pav'd, and the Stones so closely laid; that it amazes the beholder. Description of the Front of the Palace.Next this joyns the Palace it self, whose Gable-end jets out beyond all the other Buildings; the Gate thereof being very broad, hath on each side great square Pillars, Carv'd with several Images: the Walls which joyn to the Gate are Grav'd with all manner of Fruitage, and cover'd with a gilded Roof, whose Edges are adorn'd with Golden Balls, and especially at each Corner with two Dragons Couchant. Above the first Roof is a second Story, which resteth on sixteen Columns; on whose Floor are five spacious Halls, each of which hath five double Windows in the Front, the uppermost part of them shelter'd under the Roof which jets over them, on the Corners of which also lie Couching Dragons, all Gilded. Over this a third Story, having in the middle a broad and high Window, and on each side two more, distinguish'd from the middlemost, being made round on the top; the Roof of this Story ends in a square Turret, which is also cover'd with another Roof, the Edges of which jetting over, and curiously Wrought, ends on the top sharp like a turn'd Spire. Roofs Tyl'd with Gold.But on the right and left side before the Front, are the costly shining Roofs, built before the Palace on ten great Pillars, cover'd with Golden Plates: the Tylings of this Roof are Plates of massie Gold, joyning to the undermost Windows of the second Story, so surrounding the whole Palace. The Dayro's Halls.Behind these Golden Tops are the lower Halls in which the Dayro resides;
the magnificent splendor of which is too glorious to describe, the Windows are cover'd with the finest of Silks, the Walls Varnish'd after the Indian man∣ner, the Floor Pav'd with Marble, over which are Mats spread, no less curi∣ous than costly. Over those Halls on the second Story are several Rooms built after the same manner, whose Roofs not jetting out so far as that which comes over the Front, the Windows are seen very plain. On the right and left side of it the lowermost Roof is adorn'd with many Golden Balls. The upper Stories be∣ing several Foot narrower than the other, are cover'd with a flat Roof, under which are many large and convenient Apartments. In what manner the Ja∣pan Emperor comes every sixth year to visit the Dayro.THe Japan Emperor comes every sixth Year a hundred and sixteen Leagues to Meaco to Visit and Complement the Dayro: which Pro∣gress is publish'd every where by his Gests through all the adjacent Countreys, that the Ways may be mended, and all other preparations may be ready against the coming of their great Master and his magnificent Train, where are twenty eight Places appointed and prepar'd for his Reception, whereof twenty are Strong-holds; where for the better safety the Emperor takes up his Lodg∣ings. Conraedt Cramer being dispatch'd from the Netherland East-India Company to the Japan Emperor, was present in Meaco upon his Imperial Majesties coming thither, Anno 1626; whose splendid Train and Reception he describes thus. ¶ ALthough the Emperor had been busied before in preparing all things in readiness for his great Progress to Complement the Dayro at Meaco, yet he permitted the Netherland Ambassadors to his Presence, granting them publick Audience; whereas on the contrary, those of Siam and the Portugal Agents were deny'd, and could not obtain that liberty and favor. Whereup∣on his Excellency Lord Cramer, after having made his several Addresses to the Emperor and his chief Councel, had Licence to depart, and would have re∣turn'd back to Firando, had not the Lord of that Island, and Cacusymondonne, a Courtier of the Emperors, entreated him to stay and see the splendid and mag∣nificent Train, and Ceremonies of State us'd at the Emperors coming to the Dayro. The Ambassador Cramer went in the Evening with his whole Retinue to a House near the Imperial Palace, where he had hir'd a Place to stand in, by which the Emperor and Dayro were to pass the next day, being on the five and twentieth of October, where whilst he stay'd with his Servants treating about Price, the People began to flock in such great Multitudes, and the Crowd still more and more increasing to get Places, that the Ambassador finding it impossible to get home to his Lodgings, was necessitated to stay there all Night: Early in the Morning the Streets swarm'd with an incredible number of People, which between the Emperor's and the Dayro's Court were all strow'd with white Sand, and Rail'd in on both sides, all along Guarded with Soldiers of his Imperial Majesties and the Dayro's,Japan Guards, how Armed. Cloth'd in white Vestments, with Head-pieces Varnish'd with black Wax; and Arm'd each with two Scy∣miters and a Pike, by them call'd Nanganet. These Guards were up and down still busied in clearing the Way for Coaches and Horses, through the People, which two days before came flocking from all Corners of Japan in great num∣bers, there getting on Scaffolds, and staying all Night under the cold Canopy
of Heaven, to see the Emperor pass by the next Day, when all the Windows and Roofs were cover'd and throng'd with Spectators. Great Ceremony obser'd when the Emperor and Dayro meet.By break of day the Train began to march. The first that pass'd, were several Servants or the Emperor's and Dayro's, with many Palanquino's, or Porters, who carried Gifts, that were to be Presents, in square Wax'd Chests, cover'd with the Dayro's Arms in Gold, unto the Emperor's Court, a strong Guard attending them. After these, follow'd forty six Sedans, of white Wood, about a Fathom high, in-laid with Plates of Copper, and curiously painted, in which the Ladies of Honor belonging to the Dayro's Wives were carried each by four Men. No sooner were these pass'd by, but there follow'd twenty one Sedans more, cover'd with black Wax, and gilded, which were also carried by four, on their Shoulders: These Ladies of Honor, being richly Habi∣ted, sate in great State. After them came twenty seven large Sedans, which were carried by a hundred and eight Men: Their Servants that follow'd were alike cloth'd in White Liveries, and of the same number. In these Sedans, fair to the Eye, having gilded Doors and Windows, were some of the Dayro's Nobles, belonging to his Court; but before every one of these, a tall lusty young Man went, holding by a long Pike an Umbrello of white Silk, embroy∣der'd with Gold. The Dayro's Nobles, how habited.Next these, came a Cavalcade of twenty four of the Nobility on Horseback, wearing on their Heads a small black wax'd Cap, with a black Plume; and Coats with wide Sleeves; and their Breeches made of the best Sattin, were long and narrow, of several Colours, richly embroyder'd with Gold and Silver: By their Sides hung gilded Scymiters, Bowes, and Arrows, girt to their Waste with Needle-workt Scarfs, whose Tassel'd Fringes hung over on each side of the Horse; their Boots drawn on straight, being black, were gilt with golden Bars; bravely mounted on gallant Horses, proud of their little Heads, short Ears, and gaunt, yet Well-truss'd Bodies:Stately Horses. Insomuch that the meanest there, seem'd to excell the most generous and bravest Steed that ever Europe boasted or bred: Their Saddles were all wax'd or gilded; the Seats em∣broyder'd with Silver and Gold, or else richly spread over with Tygers Skins; their Mayns, like ours, were curiously pleited with Silk, Silver, and Gold Ribbons: Their Caparisons. that cover'd their Breasts and Buttocks, were a kind of Net-work of Crimson Silk, full of Tufts, and dangling with the Motion of the Wind; on their Foreheads a golden Horn, resembling our painted Unicorns: Their Shoes, to take away the noise of trampling, were of interwoven Silk, instead of Iron: Each Steed led by two Grooms: Two great Umbrellos, made of fine Linnen, cover'd over with red Cloth, with a Silk Fringe round about it, being carry'd before, serv'd to cover each Horse; which was farther attended by eight Pages, or Servants, all in white Liveries, and Arm'd according to their manner with two Cutlesses; being thus attended, they Rode on from the Dayro's to the Emperors Palace, without any disturbance in good order. Unvaluable rich Coaches.After these follow'd three rich Coaches, each drawn by two black Bulls, cover'd. with red Silken Nets, and led by four Footmen in white Liveries; these Coaches were each four Fathom high, two long, and one broad, being adorn'd with Waxen Figures, and Enammell'd with Gold; on each side being three Windows, and two before, which were hung with rich Curtains; the Entry behind open'd like the Gate of a Princes Palace, steps ascending with Turrets on each side, the Windows beneath shaded with black Wax, the
Rounds of the Wheels Gilded, the Spokes neatly Turn'd, and Inlaid also with Gold and Mother of Pearl; which moving, call glancing Beams like a Look∣ing-Glass reflecting the Sun, a novel and most glorious sight. These Coaches, or rather Towers, each of them carrying in State the Day∣ro's Principal Wives,Each Tail valu'd at an En∣glith Crown. are valu'd at seventy thousand Tail apiece. The Train of Pages all cloth'd in White which attended these Ladies was numerous, each of them carrying a Gilded Foot-stool, and a pair of Wax Slippers. But besides their Attendance of Pages, these three (as we may call them) Empresses, and also a Train of Ladies which follow'd them in twenty three Sedans, made of white Wood, and Plated with Copper, each having an Um∣brello, two Pages, and four stout men to carry them. Dayro's Courtiers.¶ THese being pass'd by, appear'd a second Cavalcade, sixty eight of the Dayro's prime Gentlemen, bravely Mounted, and compleatly Arm'd, their Horses seeming in beauty to out-vie the former; these Marching by two, and two, were attended by a great Train of Servants, Slaves, Pages, and a Guard of Pikes. Presents.Then follow'd the Presents, being carry'd in great State by several Lords of the Countrey; The first were two Gilded Scymeters, the Pommel, Handle, Hilts, and Chase all Massic Gold; a curious Fire-Lock, much esteem'd with them; a Sun-Dial, imbellish'd with Gold and Pearl, there a great rarity; two stately Golden Candlesticks; two large Pillars of Ebony; three square Pollish'd Tables of the same Wood, the corners Tipt with Gold; three Desks; two mighty Chargers of Massie Gold, attended with a pair of Wax Slip∣pers. Coaches of the old and young Dayro.The second Cavalcade being pass'd, there follow'd two more Coaches of like bigness, but exceeding the former in Riches, having the Emperors Arms on the top, Cast and flourish'd round, in a Plate of Massie1 Gold. In the first sat Sadosienminamo Tonofindelanda the Emperor himself; and in the other, the Heir Apparent, or young Emperor Oeudesienminamo Tonoynemijtsamma; fourscore Lords march'd two and two on foot before these pair of Coaches, all gallant men, Arm'd with Scymiters and half Pikes, which are the Empe∣rors Gentlemen-Pentioners, or Life-Guard, which the Japanners call Sambreys: But just before the Emperors Coach march'd eight men, who with Ebony Staves, and Steel Battoons, like our Whifflers, clearing the way: Two beau∣tiful Horses richly Trapp'd were also led before, the Coaches, about which a Guard of eight Archers, Arm'd with Pikes, Bowes, and Arrows. The Emperors retinue.Next in good Order march their Imperial Majesties Brothers, then all the Princes and Nobles of Japan follow'd on Horseback, to the number of an hun∣dred sixty four, Cloth'd and Arm'd like the former, but much richer, accord∣ing to their several Births and Qualities: The chiefest and most Eminentest of these Grandees, and those that next follow'd the Emperors, were Owarny, Cam∣mysamma, Quijne Deymangon Samma, Massamenemoet, Nocammy Samma, and Myttot∣chonango Samma, all the old Emperor's Brethren: Then came Matsendeyro Thuy∣quesnocammi Samma, the great Lord of Langa; Matsendeyro Mutsnocammy Samma Lord of Satsuma; Matsendeyro Jondonne; Matsendeyro Symoutsquedonno; Matsendeyro Quonnenochwuchoo; and at last came Turagano Deynangono Cammy Samma, being the young Emperors eldest Son: These ten Lords Rode immediately behind their Imperial Majesties Coaches, each by himself, attended by a numerous Train of Gentlemen, Pages, and Guards of Pikes, &c.
t Ziedende water van SINGOCK das sicdende wasser zingock. The boyling water of SINGOCK
The rest of the Lords follow'd two in a Rank, the primest of them taking the left hand, which in this Countrey is the upper and chief Place; Ouway∣donne, and Wouta-donne, the first the Emperors chief Councellor , and the last his Sons, were their appointed Leaders, which were attended by four hundred in white Liveries. Sumptuous Train of the Dayro's.Then came six new fair Coaches, though not above half so big as the for∣mer, and onely drawn by one Ox, but proportionably beautiful; In these sat some of the Dayro's Inferior Concubines, who were again follow'd by a Caval∣cade of sixty eight Gentlemen on horseback, attended with many Servants and Slaves. There was yet another Coach, wherein the Dayro's Chief Secretary Rode, accompany'd with thirty seven Gentlemen on horseback; then follow'd the Norimans or Sedans, in which were carry'd several of the Dayro's Grandees, whereof fifteen were of Ebbony Inlay'd with Ivory ; thirteen more shining with black Wax and Gold; and eighteen all glistering like Mirrors, with a deep Varnish, of black Wax; these were follow'd by six and forty great Gil∣ded Caroches, which with their attendance follow'd the Sedans: No sooner was this Train pass'd by, but there came fifty four disguis'd like Mascurades, being the Dayro's Musicians, Playing on several Instruments, as Pipes, Tabors, Cimbals, Bells, and some strung Instruments, unknown to us. Description of the Empe∣rors Sedan.¶ AFter these Merry Boys, follow'd the Dayro himself, sitting in a great square Edifice, surrounded with drawing Doors or Windows on each corner; on the top stood a Gilded Ball, and a Cock of Massie Gold thereon with wings display'd: This Moving-house being nine foot high, was very beautifully adorn'd on all sides with Carv'd Imagery, each Angle plated with pure Gold, and the Roof of it imitating the Heavens , with Sun, Moon, and Stars. Fifty of the Emperors Nobles Cloath'd in long white Robes, and Waxen Head-pieces carry'd this Ambulatory Palace , supported on long Poles. Forty Gentlemen Accouter'd like the Antient Greeks or Romans, Arm'd with European Head-Pieces, and Pikes Gilded at the ends, carrying in one hand a Shield, stuck full of Arrows, had each of them an Umbrelo carry'd over them, and went before, being the Dayro's Life-Guard: These were again follow'd by thirteen great Waxen Chests, carry'd by the Pallaquin Porters:. And lastly, The whole Procession was clos'd with four hundred Persons all in white Vestments, Marching six in a Rank in very good Order. Great tumult in Mecae. after the Dayro was past. ¶ BEfore the Dayro's Train were all past by, the Evening came on, and innumerable company of People of all sorts; the Scaffold and Houses which had been fill'd with Spectators, had disgorg'd their burthens into the Streets, so that the multitude was so immensly great, that many disorders happen'd, and several were crowded to death; many were so squeez'd, that they burst asunder, others falling, were sure never to rile, being immediately trampled under Feet; horrible was the general cry of the common People: The Horsemen making their way by force through the Foot, which tumbled down one over .another, in great number on both sides; so lying prostrate, for the Horses to tread o're, the Streets flow'd with blood: Amongst this miserable Croud were also many Thieves and Robbers, which with drawn Scymi∣ters made their way through, cutting of Purses, Stealing, Murthering, and Robbing as they wen't, immediately killing without mercy all those that offer∣ed
the least resistance, so that in many places several fell down dead, and over these tumbled others; and the following multitudes still pressing forward, of∣tentimes made a Mountain of Men heap'd one upon another, whereof those that were uppermost were happy, for those which were underneath were sure never to rise; the noise all night was so great, as if the City had been in an up∣rore, and the insolencies grew to that height, that many persons of Quality, who could not get out of the throng, or near retiring to their Houses, were set upon, and many of them spoyl'd and Murder'd; among others, the Lord of Firando's Secretary saw his Servant Robb'd, and a rich Cabinet of his taken from him before his Face, whilest he had much ado to defend himself from the violence of these Assaulters. The Ambassadors escape strangely.¶ THe Ambassador, Conrade Cramer, stood and saw from his Scaffold ma∣ny of these Cruelties and Outrages committed; and seeing himself in no safety to stay there all night, but that he and all his Retinue would be sure to perish before next morning, he also ventur'd amongst the Croud; the press being so great, that he was born up by the People most of his way, being but seldom able to put a Foot to the Ground; yet at length, so it pleas'd Pro∣vidence, that he and all his Followers got without any considerable loss into their Lodgings. How the Dayro is treat∣ed by both their Majesties. ¶ THe Dayro and his Wives lay there three days and three nights in the Emperors Palace, where they were serv'd by their Majesties, their Brothers, and the greatest Princes of the Court. Those which were plac'd by the Emperors, as Stewards to prepare the several Dishes for the Dayro, was the Lord Chief Justice of the Countrey and City Miaco; and also the Lords Ivocomasamma, Coberytothomysammay Nacamoramokumonsamma, Mannosabroyemonsamma; every Meal consisting of one hundred and forty Services; and for to attend the Dayro's three Principal Wives, were plac'd Ouwandonie, Head Councellor of the old Emperors; and also the Lords of the Councel, Farimadonne, Queniemondonne, Sioyserondonne, and Chirotadonne. This Feasting being done, the young Emperor gave the Dayro these follow∣ing Presents; being three thousand Boats of Silver, each of them four Tails and three Marses; two rich Tables, cover'd with Golden Plates; two hun∣dred Japan Gowns; three hundred Pieces of wrought Sattin; twelve thousand Pound of raw Silk; one great piece of Calombac; five great Silver Pots full of Musk; and ten beautiful Horses, with all their Furniture; but those which the old Emperor gave him were much less: Thus ended the glory of that Trium∣phal Procession. Sumptuous Palace of the Emperor Taicosama.¶ MEaco, by the Japanners call'd Cabucoma, is divided into upper and lower Meaco's, the lower spreading towards the Fort Tutzumi, is so costly built, that one Range seeming one House, is at least three Miles in length. The Dayro hath his Residence in the upper Meaco, where is also seen the most Splendant and Magnificent Palace, Erected by the Emperor Taycosama, Anno 1586. hung round about with a thousand Mats, edg'd with fine Damask wrought with Gold. The Walls of some of the Rooms all over are Plate with Gold; the greatest part of the Palace is built of curious Wood, and cost∣ly Marble; before the Palace appears a spacious Court, wherein stands an Im∣perial Theatre, where Comedies and Tragedies are Acted.
Japauners expert in act∣ing Plays.At which the Japanners are very exquisite, having no want (as they say) of good Poets, whose Theme being either Divine or Moral, they boast sufficient, and well Written Plots; their Commick punish (like ours) Vice, prefer∣ing Vertue; their Tragick, setting forth the great, though unfortunate Acts of former Saints, and antient Hero's. They also adorn their Stages with Scenes , shifted according to their various and chang'd Arguments, and be∣twixt every Act appears a full Chorus of Musicians, Singing and Playing like the Antient Greeks and Romans, on several Instruments; but no place else∣where in Japan exhibits the like Shews or Presentations of the business concern∣ing the Stage, than in this Theatre. Description of the Japan Races.¶ BEfore this Palace of Taycosama, they have a piece of Ground taken in for a Course, or Race, being a Match betwixt a Man and a Horse; about the Walls stand thousands of Spectators, on a more eminent Seat, Rail'd in, sit cross Legg'd by themselves, several Drummers; on the tops of the Rails hang ready fitted to their hands great Copper Kettles and Basons; some also lying on the ground, on which they Beat and Taber with such force, that the hide∣ous din and shrilness of the noise, often deafs the unwilling hearers: At the end of this Lane stand two strong Posts, having a great Rope made fast from one to the other; behind this, at a small distance, stands a square Pillar, on which a Flag or Ensign waves, fast on a Staff; one mans Office is to imbrace this Post with his left hand, and with his right points on the Breast of another, who hath on his Breast hanging about his Neck a square Board, Painted with a Griffin; he also lays his right hand on the top of the Post, and his left on his Scymiter; next to him stands a third, side-ways, which holds a long knotted Whip in his right hand, which gives the Signal to the Racers; behind these three stand others with black Head-Pieces, adorn'd also with a Sable Plume, which are the Judges of the Course:The Prize which they run for is common∣ly two pair of Wax'd Boots, made fast to Woodden Clogs, Plated with Silver;
he that runs hath a thin Silk Habits, Lac'd close about the middle, their Slceves reaching down to their Elbows, their Breeches being wide, are ty'd up about the middle of their Thighs like Trunk-Hose; on their Legs they wear Bus∣kins of Silk; when they are ready, the Drummers beat, and the signal being given, they start, the Race being betwixt a Man and a Horse, they thus per∣form; The Man holds the Horse, by a single Rein drawn out, with which he must not straiten, nor hold in the Horse, who runs at his full speed, and the men by him, when drawing near the Goal, the foremention'd Posts and Cord, the Horse and he must leap over at once together; which done, with equal dexterity, he gains the propos'd Reward or Prize, which if he fail, making a feeble or no performance, he not onely looseth the glory of the Victory, but also all manner of Court-Preferment. ¶ BUt as to what concerns the Dayro, he is the onely, true, and lawful Heir of Japan, and was formerly held in such Veneration by the Japanners, that they honor'd him as a god; and by this his great respect, he kept the Empire a long time in Peace and Quietness, till Anno 1550. During the Dayro's Govern∣ment, Japan never tasted the inconveniencies of a Civil War, which after his removal from the Throne,Civil Wars were terrible in Japan, the reasons there∣of. brake out in that nature, that scarce any Coun∣trey in the World was ever a greater Stage or Blood-shed: The salvage cru∣elties which they us'd against one another, in that grand Commotion are un∣expressable; the Conquerors turn'd their new-gotten Provinces top-si-turvey, killing, not sparing Infants in the Cradle, destroying and burning both Towns and Villages, of which some to this day lie bury'd in their own Rubbish, by which they sufficiently testifie the Destructions which were made by their Ci∣vil Wars, in which Japan was turmoil'd above fifty years. The occasion and beginning was thus; The Dayro, who is accounted so ho∣ly, that the Sun must not shine upon him, nor his Feet touch the Earth, nor his Hair or Nails ever suffer'd to be cut; (which Custom hath been in use from many Ages to this day) had a hundred and eighteen years ago two Sons, of which the second, according to an antient Law, supply'd the place of Cap∣tain-General, to be ready on all occasions to quell all manner of Insurrecti∣ons, either by substitute Kings or Subjects. The eldest expected after his Fa∣thers Decease, to possess the Throne, during whose life he held no Command. Their Mother, out of her affections to both, prevail'd so far with the Dayro, that the General-ship should be so divided betwixt both the Brothers, that they might Command their Forces Alternately, each his Trienial. But the youngest, when the time came that he should Resign his Commission to his eldest Brother, refus'd, and privately chose several Princes of Japan for to assist him if need should require; by which means he Fortifi'd himself so strongly, that he car'd for no Forces whatsoever, no, not his Father himself, who im∣mediately chose another General, granting him Commission, not onely to subdue, but kill his Rebellious Son. Soon after, several of his Substitute Kings raising all their Forces, brought a mighty Army together in the Field, with which they went on so successfully, that in short time, they utterly defeated and destroy'd the Rebel, and all his Forces. Insurrection against the Dayro.This was the first Rebellion and Insurrection that was made against the Dayro; but by the death of his Son, the War was no way finish'd: For the con∣quering
General, taking that opportunity, as having all the Forces under his Command, after the Decease of the Dayro, made himself Emperor of Japan. Against him the young Dayro arose, notwithstanding the new Emperor al∣low'd him all his former Revenues, and shew'd him the same Respect as had formerly been shown to his Father. At last the Dayro march'd towards the new Emperor, whom by means of a chosen General (by the Japanners call'd Cubo) he defeated and slew. This Conquering General, not regarding the miserable end of the new-slain Emperor, aim'd also at the Crown, making himself absolute Master of all the Forces. The Inland Wars in Ja∣pan are very cruel.From hence proceeded a bloody War, Kings and Princes dividing the Countrey, appropriating Territories and Provinces to themselves; which was not done without much trouble: for by this means, not onely Countrey against Countrey, and City against City, but also petty Villages had peculiar Wars one with another; those which were Conquer'd, were sure not to find the least mercy: for they neither spar'd Houses nor Temples, nor indeed poor Infants, consuming and destroying all by Sword and Fire, so that in short time whole Cities lay bury'd in Ashes. Mioxindeu opposeth Cubo.This new Cubo overcoming all, at last setled himself on the Imperial Throne; which was but for a small time: for when he thought himself surest, not thinking of the least Insurrection, Mioxindono, whom he had entrusted with all his Forces, joyn'd in conspiracy with Dajondono, Lord of Nara, who had gotten an Army (as we said before) of twelve thousand Men, which they drew up close to Meaco. Soon after Mioxindono, accompany'd with a strong Life∣guard, enter'd the City, under pretence to congratulate the Emperor for some prime favors which he had pleas'd to shew him. And to that purpose, that he might the better bereave the Emperor of his Life privately and without distur∣bance, he invited him to a Banquet in the Cloyster of the Bonzi near Meaco, where he intended to put in Execution his bloody Design. But the Emperor Cubo scenting the business, suspected it the more, because he had information that the Army was drawn up near Meaco, made all things in readiness for his escape, who being on the Way was perswaded and call'd back by some of his Council, telling him that they could not perceive any such danger in the busi∣ness, accounting it ignoble for an Emperor to flye from a Prince which was his own Subject. But in the interim Mioxindono entred the City Meaco with all his Forces, and drew up towards the Palace, but before he committed any hostility, he sent to the Emperor Cubo, demanding to send him the Heads of some of his No∣bles, whose insupportable Greatness (as he pretended) stood in his way; which if the Emperor would grant, a Peace should immediately be concluded, and he would suddenly withdraw his Forces, and depart from the City. The Herald brought a Letter, in which was written the Names of those Grandees which Mioxindono would have Executed: An antient Courtier being sent from Cubo receiv'd the Paper, which not without many reproaches to the Rebels he tore to pieces; and returning again to the Emperors Presence,One of the Emperors Courtiers stab, himself. drew out a Stilletto, with which he desperately Stabbing himself, fell dead on the Ground at the Emperor's Feet. The Revenge of a Son ta∣ken for his Father.After the same manner six more made away themselves: But the Son of the old Courtier seeing his Father weltring in his own Bloud, on a sudden ran
out amongst the Rebels, where having wounded and kill'd several of them, he himself was slain. Whilst Mioxindono set the Palace on Fire in four places, Cubo rather chusing to fall by the Sword than be consum'd by Fire, clear'd himself from the em∣braces of his Mother, and rush'd out with two hundred resolute Men with drawn Scymiters. Cubo being foremost fought valiantly, and receiving three mortal Wounds,The Emperor slain. fell down dead: the remaining part fighting bravely, were soon all cut off, dying upon the Spot, laying themselves in a heap one upon another, after they had shewn a sufficient testimony of their great Resolution and true Valour, not one falling without slaughter of the Enemy. But most remarkable was the behaviour of a tender Youth, scarce to be call'd a Man, who astonish'd the Foe with his desperate fierceness, having wounded several, and slain many of them, made his way to the Emperor's Corps; which looking upon with great grief and anxiety of spirit, vented his Passion thus: Why should I live, my Master thus Murder'd by accursed Traitors? I have done what I could for my Honor, his dear Love, and my Allegiance: Which as soon as said, he threw away his Sword, and with a Dagger cut his own Throat; notwithstanding which Wound, though mortal, to dispatch himself the sooner, he stabb'd himself to the Heart. Miexindono takes Cubo's Palace.In the mean while the Enemy, where the Flames had not possess'd, took possession of the Palace; where finding the Emperor's Mother and Daughters, them they cruelly massacred,Horrible Murder. excepting onely two, which kneel'd down igno∣miniously, begging Quarter of the Murderers, who secur'd them in a strong Prison near the Palace:Then they broke into the Treasury. The Court-Ladies, most of them being of high Extraction, fled into a Hall not yet touch'd by the Fire; where by their loud shreeks, and lamentable ejaculations, they were dis∣cover'd by the Soldiers; who breaking in, stripp'd some of their Clothes, ra∣vish'd others, and made an inhumane Massacre of the rest, not sparing any for Tears, Youth, Beauty, or whatsoever is taking in the Female Sex. Others observing the horrible inhumanity of these Butchers, rather deliver'd them∣selves to the merciless Flames, than the unmerciful Murderers. But the Em∣press with some of her Attendants making her escape, got into a Cloyster of the Bonzi who soon after being discover'd, was in like manner, without the least pity or reluctation, dispatch'd. Thus the Palace being utterly destroy'd, and most of them that belong'd to it burn'd with it, Mioxindono commanded those two hundred, who made that brave and desperate Sally, and by which he had lost many Men, to be thrown into the Flames, where they were with the Palace consum'd to Ashes. The Bonzies prevail'd so much with the Conqueror, that they obtain'd leave to bury the Emperor Cubo in a Cloyster of their own. A strange Action of a Friend of Cubo's.Frojus relates in a Letter from Canga, an Isle in Japan, Dated Anno 1565, that a Favorite of the Emperor's hearing of his miserable misfortune, hasten'd with all speed to Meaco, and viewing the Place where formerly the Palace stood, with bitter Execrations and Curses he cry'd out against those inhumane Trai∣tors that had Murder'd his Lord and destroy'd his Palace: From thence go∣ing to the Tomb where the Emperor was bury'd, he ript open his own Bow∣els, falling athwart the Grave, hoping so to be united with him in everlasting happiness in the other World. Cubo's Sisters marder themselves.Of Cubo's Royal Family there remain'd onely his two Sisters, and as many Daughters alive, his Sisters having long before betook themselves to a Cloy∣ster:
These, though they were under the sanctuary of the Bonzi, suffer'd ma∣ny great Calamities, which not being able to endure any longer, desperately became their, own Executioners. His two Daughters were Entertain'd by an ordinary Citizen. Yet besides these, Canadonus Vajacata, youngest Brother to the deceased Em∣peror, had also escap'd the cruelty of his bloody Persecutors, who spat'd his Life because he was one of the Religious Order belonging to the Bonzi: but that they shouldnot be in fear of any Insurrection that might happen by his means, theyorder'd him to be kept close Prisoner:The Emperor's youngest Brother being kept Prisou∣er breaks forth. from whence breaking forth at last, he went to Vatadono, Governor of Loca, as we have beforemen∣tion'd Vatadono and Nebunun∣ga assist the Emperor's Bro∣ther.This Vatadono stirr'd up all his neighboring Princes, and chiefly Nobunanga, against the Emperor's Murderers, to the end they might aid Vajacata, as being the next Heir to the Imperial Crown. This weighty Concern took good effect; for Nobunanga brought an Army of sixty two thousand Men into the Field, and with thefe Forces made so great a progress, that Vojavata obtain'd his desires, and became chief Governor of all Japan. ¶WHen the Rebels (as we said before) were destroy'd, and the decea∣sed Cuba's, Brother set on the Throne, Vatadono. went with a great part of the Army to Saccai, and Nobunanga with Vojacata to Meaco. Vatadono be∣ing in Saccai, held correspondency with Lodowick Frojus; for whom he got so much Liberty by the new Emperor and Nobunanga, that the banish'd Jesuits might freely return again to Meaco. But this business afterwards prov'd much to his disadvantage and inconvenience: for he had appointed a publick Dis∣putation to be held in the presence of Nobunanga, between a famous Bonzi, call'd Nichioxines, and Lodowick Frojus, concerning the Japan Religion, and also about Martial Discipline: Bun Nichioxines fell so much short with his Argu∣ments about the Immortality of the Soul, which every one obferving, prov'd to his great disgvace and dishonor; which he seemingly bore with patience, but in his heart conceal'd bitter malice, resolving to take revenge of Vatadono, who soon after fell into a great Sickness: which opportunity the Bonzi ma∣king use of, went to Nobunanga, and accus'd Vatadona with many false Aspersi∣ons; to which purpose he had corrupted Witnesses, ready to affirm what-ever he said; which Nobunanga believing,Vatadono lost Nobunau∣ga's savor by means of a Bonzi. bred an inveterate hatred against his old Friend, which at last broke out so far, that so soon as Vatadono had recover'd his Health, he banish'd him from his Court with shame and disgrace, and abated him twenty thousand Ducats annually of his Revenue. A Whole Year he wandred up and down, despised by all the Bonzies, who bore an irrecon∣cilable malice against him.Become friends again. At last being permitted to the Prefence of the Emperor and Nobunanga, ht made his Case so clear, that he was not onely pro∣moted to his former Dignity, but also was presented with ten thousand Ducats above the foremention'd twenty which were taken away from him. Vatadono's Wars with the King of Iquenda.¶ VAtadono enjoy'd these his great Revenues but a small time; for he soon after dy'd by this following Accident: He had built two Forts on the utmost of his Borders, near the Territory Iquenda, which the King of that Countrey could no ways digest, and therefore would have them both to be pull'd down; and because he Govern'd a great number of valiant Men, he
was the bolder in that his Command. Vatadono, though he thought himself able to Engage with the other, yet stood amaz'd at his peremptory Command, to pull down that which brought him in so much Revenue yearly. These Orders were sent before, which the King of Iquendo follow'd himself, and lay down before the Forts with a considerable Army; in which at that time Dario Tacajam a resided, who immediately sent information to Vatadono, being then at Fort Tacacuquim, of his present Condition; whereupon he Muster'd up all his Forces which were near him, and with those he march'd to Encounter the Enemy; who had information how in considerable all his Forces were, for he could number of all that he had rais'd not above two thousand Men; but his Son follow'd him with five hundred more. The Enemy, which was ready to take all advantages, hid most of his Men behind a Mountain, and so enticed Vatadono to Battel, by shewing onely a few of his Men, near the Place where the rest lay ambuscado'd; for he feared that else he might have gotten into some Fortification or other, and so have worn out the time till fresh Forces might come to his assistance: This Plot of the Enemies prov'd very successful for Vatadono, who wore a Scarlet Cap, given him by the Portu∣guese, as soon as he drew near the Enemy, he lighted from his Horse, and with one of his Companies assaulted the Enemy very fiercely,In the Enceunter Vatado∣no was slain whilst on a sudden those that lay in Ambuscade appear'd from behind the Hill, and set upon him with great eagerness on all Corners, yet keeping close together fought very valiantly for a considerable time; but seeing no likelihood of those fresh Sup∣plies over which Vatadono's Son was Commander, and how unequal the Match was, return'd back, and took possession of the Fort Tacacuquim. A Contest between No∣bunanga and he Emperor, and the reason.Mean while the Emperor and Nobunanra fell at variance: for the one boast∣ing continually his Merits, that by his sole Conduct he had set the Emperor on his Throne: which proud vaunting of his he not being able to bear, Princes especially not enduring the good Deeds that have been done for them to be cast in their Dish, also judging himself to be under Tutorage, and not absolute, whilst he boasted and vain-glory'd that he was an Emperor of his own making. These Murmurings and Mutterings at last broke forth into open Flames, and Civil War, the Emperor Mustering all the Forces he could possibly get to∣gether against Nobunanga, with which he thought to make a sudden end of the business, and the better because Nobtmanga was gone to the Kingdom of Boari: But he hearing of the Emperor's great Preparations, rais'd also (scarce to be believ'd) another as vast an Army; with which he March'd directly to Meaco: and though he sent Messengers daily, with all humility imploring and pro∣posing Peace,Nobunanga destroys all. offering Articles of Agreement, yet destroy'd the Imperial Ter∣ritories with Fire and Sword where-ever he came; so that in a short time a hundred Villages, and several Cities, lay waste, being bury'd in their Ashes. But the Emperor disdain'd the Proposals, relying solely upon the Forces which were promis'd him, which incensed Nobunanga the more; and therefore he re∣solv'd to Storm Meaco, and taking it, to spare neither Woman nor Child: his first Vengeance he design'd should be the upper part of the City, where most of the Nobility resided: which to prevent, and to mollifie his fury, they sent him proffers of great Sums of Money, that so he would be pleas'd in mercy to spare them; all which Nobunanga refus'd: yet he gave strict command through his whole Army, that they should not commit the least outrage in the lower Meaco; but the upper part of the City he gave them free leave to Plunder. Upper Menco Miserably burnt.But before his Army drew near Meaco, several Conspirarors had already set
Fire on many Places of the City, that so they might enrich themselves with Plunder before the Enemy came thither. In one Night almost a third part of the upper Meaco lay in Ashes, whilst Nobunanga came in on the next Day, and destroy'd all what was remaining. This Fire consum'd at least eight thousand Houses, twenty Cloysters of the Bonzies, and the two famous Temples of Amida and Xaca, besides eighty lesser Temples. Bonzies burnt.Into one of these, sixty of the poor Bonzies, which gather'd Alms at Meaco, for the re-building, of the decay'd Temple, Consecrated to the Idol Dalbud in the Province of thematis. taking their refuge there, were consum'd by the Fire. The lower Meaco escaped this destruction, for not one Soldier durst offer to enter there, Nobunanga having on pain of Death charged them all to the con∣trary. But whilst one Corner of upper Meaco burnt very fiercely, the Fire drawing near the lower City, in which was the; Temple of Yzum, the Bonzies began to be much concern'd for that Idol, and the more,A strange Idol call'd Yzum. because it was his Of∣fice to conduct the Souls of the Deeeased to a place of punishment, from whence after being purifi'd by Fire, he brings them to the place of happiness ptepar'd by Amida. This Image is terrible to behold, holding in its right Hand a Trident. The Bonzies thus highly concern'd for this their Deity, entreated him by Re∣sponses to signifie to them, whether the Fire would consume his Temple, and if he would be remov'd to another place: they imagin'd from the Statues fix'd looks, that he would be remov'd, and secur'd from the Fire: Where∣upon they immediately prepar'd all things in readiness, the Bonzies with ma∣ny others bringing the Image with great State and Ceremony to a pare of the upper Meaco, which lay a great way beyond the Fire: But Nobunanga soon after setting all parts of the upper City on Fire, their god Yzum was also burnt there; and his Temple standing in lower Meaco, though not protected by its Deity, being spared by Nobunanga, was preserv'd. The Emperor besieg'd by Nobunauga.But the Emperor looking from a high Tower on these horrible outrages, saw with an undaunted courage the richest part of the City involv'd in Flames and utter ruine, whilst he expected daily fresh Forces to relieve him, with whose help he resolv'd to satiate his Revenge: but before any came, Nobunanga had so straitned the Royal Fort with a strict Leaguer, that the Emperor began to hearken to Terms of Peace, Nobunanga threatning, that he would surren∣der the Crown to the Dayro, to whom it antiently and justly belong'd. At last Articles of Agreement were Sign'd,Makes Peace.with no small diminution of Power and Honor to the Emperor. Persons of Quality were sent from both Sides as Pledges to confirm the Agreement: all which, as soon as the Empe∣ror's promis'd Assistance came, he broke. Nobunanga makes him∣self Emperor.But this help prov'd his utter ruine, for Nobunanga, highly incens'd the breach of Peace, march'd up again with all his Forces to Meaco, defeating the new-come Party, took Vojocata the Emperor, and soon after assum'd to himself the Imperial Dignity. This absolute Conquest brought him thirty Kingdoms, Anno 1573. But no sooner setled in the Imperial Throne, but he met with as many, or rather more difficulties and troubles to break through than his Predecessors: for who-ever thought well of him at first, and were helps to his great advance∣ment, finding that he took no care of keeping his Promise, but suddenly broke the soletm Oath taken at his Coronation, to protect the People according to
the antient Law, and be as a Nursing Father and Mother to them: but in stead thereof he prov'd to be a greedy devourer of his People, tyrannizing by arbitrary Power, making his Will a Law, and grew more hated and detesta∣ble by his ambition of aspiring to be a god: to which purpose he set his own Imperial Crown on an Image representing himself, in the Temple at Dubo, as beforemention'd. Loses the love of all the Poeple because of his per∣scuting the Bonzi.But most of all the People were instigated against this Emperor by the Bonzi, who suffer'd extremely by his means in Vojocata the former Emperor's Reign; of which hear two principal Examples, which were thus: ¶ THe Mountain Frenoiama having very high Precipices, lies two Leagues Eastward from Meaco, eight hundred years since a Japan King built here three thousand eight hundred Temples, and by every one a Cloyster for the Bonzi, and that they might there without any molestation follow their Devotion and Study, he remov'd all the Rustick Inhabitants from thence with their Cattel, lest any noise should disturb them in their Retirements. At the Foot of this Mountain Frenoiama he built two Villages, calling them Upper and Lower Sacomotum, from whence the Bonzi fetch daily their Provisions:They had also a third Part of the Revenue of the Kingdom of Vomis allow'd them.Strange Temple and Cloysters. These Edifices from time to time grew more and more in splendor and magnificence, because that continually some of the Emperor's Relations, or at least a King's Son, was kept there, which made it so famous, that all Matters of consequence were decided by these Monks, and all Disputations concerning their Religion were held in this University, and there, as in the chief Academy, all Scholars Commence. But in process of time, and chiefly by the Wars, this vast number of Tem∣ples which stood on the top of Frenoiama, were reduced to eight hundred; and also the wanton and luxurious lives of the Bonzies, being given over to all De∣baucheries, made them break out into all manner of outrages, and dissolute courses, oftentimes throwing away their Books, taking up Arms: and whilst they grew formidable to maintain a War, they made the High-ways, and all Places dangerous by their several Murders and Robberies;The Bonzi become villa∣ous Murderers. nay, they grew so impudent at last, that without the least regard to the Dayro, by the Japanners honor'd as a god,Commit great outrages ic Meaco. they set upon, and Storm'd Meaco, in the Year 1535. burning the whole City to Ashes; and not onely slew all those which escap'd the Fire, but tender Infants in the Cradle. This barbarous piece of Cruelty remain'd unpunish'd a long time; until thirty six years after they receiv'd a. sufficient reward for their bloody inhuma∣nities: A great War arising between Nobunanga and the King of Nechier, the Bonzies furnish'd the Nechiers with all manner of Provisions and other Necessa∣ries, and blockt up the Passage and Avenues against Nobunanga: which he ta∣king very hainously, resolv'd to be reveng'd to the full: and accordingly to put his Design in execution, he return'd to Boari, which he Commanded as being King,Nobunanga crucifies the Bonzi. and there drove all the Bonzies out of their several Abodes, Nailing all he could find on Crosses. Goes to Erenoiama.But not thus satisfi'd, he rais'd a new Army, with which he march'd to∣wards the Mountain Frenoiama. The Bonzies not being able to make resistance, hung down their Heads, sending Commissioners, offering great Sums of Mo∣ney for a Pacification: but Nobunanga being incens'd, and full of wrath against them, would by no means accept of their Proffers, but march'd on: Then
they endeavor'd to perswade him, by telling him of the Sanctity of the Place, and Reverence which was to be shown to the gods, whose Temples and Altars stood upon Frenoiama, which had been kept unviolated many Ages. But Nobu∣nanga told them, that he scorn'd their proffer'd Money; neither fear'd he those gods they worshipp'd, that had committed so many inhumane and horrid im∣pieties, but by the help of better Powers would deal with them according to their merits. So left utterly out of hope, they desperately prepar'd themselves for resistance, and so fight it out to the last. ¶ On the top, or highest Spire of this Mountain stands a stately Temple, dedicated to Canon, Son of the famous Amida. This Image hath thir∣ty Arms, and as many Hands, in each two Arrows, a Face representing a hand∣som Youth, on his Breast seven humane Faces, with a Crown of Gold, richly inchas'd with Pearls, Diamonds, and all sorts of Precious Gems. The Japanners come hither from all Parts of the Countrey, paying there their Devotions, because they believe that he grants them a long and happy life. A great Fast fet Idol Canon.Every year the Bonzies keep a great Fast to the honor of this their god Canon; which Day draws such a concourse of People that repair thither, that it would seem fabulous to recite. In Osacca stands also a Temple of Canon; but the Image of the god quite an∣other Figure, which is a custom amongst the Japanners, never to make the same Deity alike. Bonzies fortifie them∣selves.The Bonzies chief place of Defence was on the top of the Mountain, near Canon's Temple: Thither they Muster'd all those that were able to bear Arms; and there they fortifi'd themselves as well as they could, whilst Nobunanga burnt the two Villages, the Upper and Lower Sacamotum, from whence they had formerly all their Provision: And as the amazing Flames and Smoke ascend∣ed the Sky, he and his Army march'd up the Hill, having before block'd up all
the Passages of the Descents with strong Guards, that not one of the Bonzies might escape, then giving a general Storm to their Fort, which they defended aslong as they could; but being over-power'd, they shrinking from their Sta∣tions, were as soon possess'd by the Enemy; who falling in like a Deluge, made a speedy Execution:Are all slam. those that escap'd the Sword Were burnt in the Temple, and others that escap'd away by the Declivings of the Hill, were cut off and hunted up and down like wild Beasts by the Guards. Yet this general Massa∣cre little appeas'd the wrath of the Enemy: for soon after he also fir'd four hundred Temples, with their Cloysters and Colledges. Four hundred Temples burnt.We may easily conjecture how terrible the Mountain Frenoiama smoak'd, ha∣ving so many Temples and Cloysters, towards the Building of which in. seven hundred years more than the King's Revenues have been from time to time be∣stow'd on the same. This destruction is reckon'd to have happen'd Anno 1571. The Vehisamidono erects a new Order.This done, Nobunanga march'd through towards Meaco, and fifteen Miles beyond the City he set upon the famous Bonzi Taquieno Vehisamidono, who having lately rais'd a new Sect to the honor of Xaca, and to that end put away his Wife, and his Head and Chin, according to their manner, Shaven, having four hundred Scholars under his Tuition; for whose Education at his own Charge he had built a stately Colledge, which got him great applause and affection amongst the People; of which growing proud, he boldly and bitterly in∣veighed against Nobunanga in the presence of the Emperor Vojocata, saying, That Nobunanga, though aspir'd to such a heighth, would suddenly fall and drop like a rotten Pear from the Tree: of which Nobunanga had information, and happening to light upon him in his way homewards, though the Emperor much perswa∣ded him, yet he utterly destroy'd him and all his Relations, levelling his Cloy∣sters, and banishing nis Wife and Children; but all this was not enough to sa∣tisfie his revenge. The famous School Fa∣cusangin.He had a long time observ'd the famous School Pacusangin, which the Bon∣zies had been Masters of, and possess'd it in peace and quietness six hundred years together. To this School, or University belongs several Cloysters, and a thou∣sand Habitations, no less convenient than costly, which also to destroy he wanted some fair pretence, to hide his unsatisfi'd revenge; yet at last he found a way that answer'd his desire. Some Robbers having pillag'd the Kingdom of Boari, carry'd their Booty to the Facusangin Bonzies; which opportunity he neglected not, for having his Hands at liberty, and a Peace being concluded between him and the Empe∣ror, he thought it the best time to satisfie his spleen:Is ruin'd by Nobunanga, and all the Boinzies slain. whereupon he unexpe∣edctly fell upon Facusangin, and destroy'd all the Bonnes, setting most of their Houses on fire, Anno 1573, which was the same Year that Nobunanga became Emperor. These were the occasions that set the Bonzies so much against his being chosen Emperor, by whom stirr'd up, none more oppos'd than Xinguien King of Cainochuno; who having banish'd his Father, and also imprison'd his eldest Brother, set himself on the Throne; and wanting just Claim, he betook him∣self to other practices, that might better strengthen and improve his Title; and therefore the Cloak of Religion must be his Royal Robe, seeming Sancti∣ty his Scepter, and so shaving his Head and his Chin close, he took the Order of the Bonzi, performing all their Ceremonies and religious Duties, punctual in all the stiff Formalities of well-dissembled Holiness, attended constantly by six hundred Bonzies; the rumor of which spread round the Countrey, the Japan∣ners
not being accustom'd to see a King play the Priest, and Officiate at Divine Service, and that thrice a day, straight believ'd (so had he gain'd upon their Affections) that he, and onely he, was appointed to re-establish the shaking Church, and restore to its Pristine Glory (now almost utterly defac'd) their Ancient Religion: On which great Multitudes from all Parts resorted to his Palace, he giving out, That he would Re-erect the destroy'd Temples and Cloysters on the Mountain Frenioama, and also the famous Temple Consecrated to Canon. These Promises and fair Pretences tickl'd the Ears of the Vulgar; for Fre∣nioama was always held to be the Supreme University for the Education of their Youth, both in the Mysteries of Religion, Study in Philosophy, and other abstruse Learning. Here also stood Canon's Temple, highly esteem'd, and so venerable amongst the People; to whose Feast yearly great Multitudes, from the several Territories round about, use to resort, invited by the hopes of the propos'd Rewards of Everlasting Bliss, for all such as repair annually thither. He also boasted, That he would out-do, if possible, the Renown'd Xaca himself, in Vindicating and Establishing their pure and ancient Religion, under which their Ancestors liv'd happily, ever since they first Planted in Japan. His Letter to Nobunan∣ga.Thus the Business prepar'd, and a good Ground-plot laid, by this time his Admirers in several Places offer'd themselves and Forts, their Lives and For∣tunes, to serve and be under his Conduct: So that suddenly he grew as pow∣erful and as great a Prince as the Emperor; of which Nobunanga being sensi∣ble, and perceiving his Power daily to encrease; and also not a little sha∣ken with a ranting Epistle from the high-flying Xinguen, who subscribed thus: Taindino Taxuxamon Xinguen; that is, Xinguen the King of Kings, and Patriarch of all Religion: The Emperor contrarily subscribing thus; Dainoquin Tennomavon Nobunanga; which is, Nobunanga, the Great Commander of Devils, and Prime Leader of Wandering Spirits. Besides Xinguen, appear'd also the Prince Aquechi, bred a Soldier, who after slew Nobunanga before Meaco, in the Imperial-Blood-Grove,Nobunanga slain. so call'd (as we said be∣fore) from his Death. Amongst his Captains, was a Prime Leader, of a Noble Aspect, call'd Fax∣iba, whose Extract, Life, and Right to the Imperial Crown, we will here relate. Faxiba, from whence he got that Name.¶ THis Name Faxiba the Emperor Nobunaga had given him, when he led a puissant Army of the Emperors against the King Amanguci; for when he was ready upon his March, he entreated him to give him a new Name; which Nobunanga granting, whereas formerly he had been call'd Toquixiro, he denominated him Faxiba, which is to say, Fly above the Wood; by which the Emperor express'd his hopeful Success: for the King of Amanguci, against whom Faxiba was to fight, bore the Name of Maridono, which two first Syllables signified A Wood, and the last, Lord: By which also Nobunanga would have them to understand, That his new foremention'd Ge∣neral should by Conquest of his Enemy, fly like a Bird over the Wood. Serves a Rustick to cut his Wood.This Faxiba, formerly call'd Toquixiro, was of a very mean Extract, being Servant to a Rustick; his business to cut Wood from a neighboring Hill, and carry it home. This was hard Labor, the Mountain being very steep and craggy; and his Master consum'd daily much Fewel, who on a time had laid on more than he was us'd to do; which Toquixiro observing, took some of the
Wood from the Fire, putting the remaining Sticks up in such order, that a few of them cast an exceeding great heat. His Master taking much notice of this his handsome contrivance, to make a greater and better Fire with much less Fewel, judg'd hi Servant was fitter for other Employment, than to be his Slave. Whereupon he not onely commended him, and freed him from his bad Service;How he gets out of his Service, into the Emperors. but giving him Money, bid him seek his Fortunes in the Wars, or elsewhere; not doubting, but the Gods had better things laid up in store for him. Soon after this, Toquixiro began to have a more elevated opinion of himself, and his swelling Thoughts aiming at something higher, he travel'd big with hopes to Meaco, where at first he got into the Service of a great Merchant, and soon after he was preferr'd to a Noble-man, a Prime Favorite of the Emperor Nobunanga's; who one day happening to go with the Emperor a Hawking, and Toquixiro being amongst the Faulconers, and others of the Court-Retinue, it chanc'd that one of the best Hawks, flying at his Game, hung tangled about the Bough of a high Tree, by the Vervils; and when none of them were able to climb the Tree, Toquixiro's Master bid him see what he could do, which he perform'd so well, and with such comely agility, and taking dexterity, that the like having not been seen before, the Emperor and all his Train admir'd the Man that so much out-did all the rest, especially Nobunanga himself; so that he took him into his Service, and preferring from place to place, he came to great Dignity; insomuch that the rest of the Courtiers that saw him rise before them, and grow more and more in the Emperors favor, spited him extremely, their former Love turning into hatred, and never rested contriving Plots, not onely to bring him down in his Pride and Greatness, but utterly to ruine him: When an Accident hapned pat for their purpose, which they were not negligent to lay hold on; and thus it was. A very rich Scymiter, pla∣ted with Gold, which the Emperor highly esteem'd, being stoln from the Court, and much inquiry after, his Enemies insinuating, whisper'd, that no body could steal it but Toquixiro,Is accus'd with Theft. having, as they said, often prais'd, and taken more than common notice of it: This buzz'd about, his Greatness ha∣ving left him few Friends to shake off the Aspersion, it was the general Talk, and most of them being willing, believ'd; when an Intimate of his advis'd him to fly; for when once it came to the Emperors Ear, there was no way to avoid an ignominious Death. He being of a quick Apprehension, took his Friends Advice, and absented; but he was no sooner miss'd, than his Enemies taking hold of the Advantage, made the Business no more doubtful, but all were satisfied, that he, and no other, was the Thief; the Emperor sending every where to apprehend him, that he might receive condign Punishment for his so hainous Offence. Whilst he thus absconded, in a miserable condition, fearing every minute to be taken, and so die without mercy, he secretly went up and down amongst the Goldsmiths, inquiring cunningly after such Plates as those that were on the lost Scymiter, as if he would buy such Golden Plates: So by great accident he lighted upon them: Then with a kind of Authority, being a Courtier, he question'd and threatned the Buyer; who frighted, to save his own Life, found the Seller, and so from hand to hand, at last the Thief himself;Manifests innocence. whom bringing to the Court, he was clearly acquitted of all, and had the honor to be Executioner himself;Cuts off the Thieves Head. so cutting off the Malefactors Head, laid it with the recover'd Plates at the Emperors Feet, who straight re∣ceiving him into former Favor, still advanc'd him the more, vexing those by that means that had so falsly accus'd him.
Toquixiro at last obtaining to be a Governor,Is made a Governor. manag'd his Affairs with such Moderation and Prudence, that he got the Love, Applause, and Estimation of all that were under his Concern, which straight preferr'd him to a higher Place, and of more Dignity. ¶ THe Impregnable Castle which held out against Nobunanga and all his Power, long after he was chosen Emperor, still sallying out with strong and bold Parties, fetching in Booty, and often doing much damage and mischief round about in several Places, now suppos'd altogether impossible to be taken in; Nobunanga considering the Activity and Subtlity of this his Fa∣vorite, he thought once more to Attaque it:Leads an Army into the Field. So making Toquixiro General of the Forces appointed for that purpose, and Commissioning him at large, set him upon the Work, though with small hopes of carrying so considerable a Business: But beyond his expectation, and all others that scoff'd at it, as a ri∣diculous Undertaking, he behav'd himself so well, and shew'd himself so great a Master of Arms, that without much ado, what had remain'd a Goad so long in the Emperors side, and had baffl'd him so oft,Takes the Castle of Nan∣gafama. he took in. Thus the Emperor encourag'd with his Success, sent him out against the King of Amanguci, whom with the like good Fortune,Subdues the King of A∣manguci. and without any great difficulty, he subdu'd. Thus being one of Nobunanga's Chief Lieutenants, after his Defeat at Meaco, being slain in the Imperial-Blood-Grove, he took upon him the Authority of Protector of his third Son, an Infant of three Years old, whom he kept in a Castle, shewing him all possible Reverence, due to so hope∣ful and great a Prince: For Nobunanga's eldest Son was slain with his Father, and the second ran distracted. The Deceas'd Emperors Wives Brother, call'd Xibatadono, being the nearest of his Relations left alive, stomach'd much at the Proceedings of Toquixiro, and oppos'd him in what he might; whom to remove, being such a Block in his way, he resolv'd, if possible, to destroy, and immediately sat down and vested the Fort wherein he resided with a close Siege. Xibatadono finding him∣self thus suddenly surpris'd, and so straightned that there was no means left to escape, call'd a Council of all his Friends, thus saying, You all know our hard Con∣dition; and for my part, rather than yield to the cruel Tyrant, I am resolv'd to end this wo∣ful Life by Self-slaughter: All my Request is, That after Death,Self-murder committed by Xibatadono, and by all the Besieg'd. you will see my Fune∣rals in Fire, and that nothing be left of me for that inhumane Rebel to boast of. As for your selves, make what Agreement you can for the Preservation of your Lives. But there was not one in all the Company, but approving of his Resolution, were resolv'd to follow his Example. Xibatadono return'd them all Thanks for their Fidelity towards him: But before he took leave of this World, he made them a Funeral-Feast, loading his Tables with all Varieties, the Roofs resounding with Vocal and Instrumental Musique, such as the Place afforded; Bowls of their beloved Chiaw, and Wine still handed about. So after they had Treated to the height, they rose, first fil∣ling the Hall with Combustible Matter, as Bavins, Brush-wood, and the like, which firing, and the Flames at last ascending through the Roof, then the bloody Banquet began. Xibatadono first fell upon his Wife and Children, and their Servants, running them through, or otherwise mortally wounding them; who was follow'd by the rest of his Captains and Officers, in like manner dispatching their Relations and Retinue: Then throwing their Bodies into the Flames, and standing upon them, they ripp'd up their own Bowels.
Toquixiro takes Xibatadono's Fort.Mean while Toquixiro seeing the Smoke of the Castle ascending towards the Sky, and thinking that the Fire had hapned accidentally, thought to take hold of that Opportunity, and so presently order'd a general Storm; where find∣ing no manner of Preparation, nor Resistance, neither at the Gates, nor on the Walls, entring, he saw onely some Bodies, not yet quite consum'd, broyling on the Coals: Which much represented the Misfortune that hapned to the an∣cient City Saguntus. ¶ THis City Hannibal Storm'd in three Places, and chiefly against a low part of the Wall, which he set upon with several Engines for that purpose: But the Besieg'd bestirr'd themselves so valiantly against the Assail∣ants, that they made great Slaughter amongst them: Hannibal himself, being wounded in the Thigh with a Pike, was forc'd to Retreat, and the Army rest∣ed till their General was cur'd; who then mustering his Forces, afresh Be∣sieg'd the City closer than before,Strange destruction of Saguntus. a hundred and fifty thousand being daily in Arms, against whom the Saguntines were forc'd to keep Watch on all Corners. The Enemies Battering-Engines had by this time made Breaches in the Walls in several Places; three Towers undermin'd, also turn'd topsie-turvey: So that the City lay in a manner open and undefended, and the Soldiers which fill'd the Breaches were naked and without shelter, having neither Battlements nor Breast-works against which Hannibal drew up his whole Army. Hope spurr'd on the Assailants, and Desparation kept the Defendants in their Stati∣ons; so the Storm was very fierce, long, and well maintaind: Hannibal, if his Men did their parts, not doubting but to carry the City, made a fierce Assault; the Saguntines making good their Breaches with Throngs of Soldiers, match'd with equal Valour the Carthaginians, in so close a Body, that the Enemies Ar∣rows never mist a Mark. The Saguntines answer'd them with thrown Javelins,Strange Darts. carrying Wild-fire; which were so terrible, and did such Execution, that Hannibal was forc'd to Retreat. Thus both Parties being tired, there hapned a short Cessation: Onely the Saguntines labour'd day and night, to make up the Breaches of their ruin'd Walls. Soon after Hannibal giving the Plunder of the City to the Soldiers, made a more fierce and general Assault. Saguntus is divided in the middle.But the Saguntines having divided the Town, rais'd a new Wall with the old Houses. Here they made fresh Resistance against the Enemy, it being then eight Months that they had suffer'd so great a Siege. In the interim, their Wants began daily to increase, and their Hopes of being Reliev'd by the Ro∣mans vanish'd; the Enemies never ceasing from Storm: For though Hannibal went with a part of his Army against the Oretans and Carpetans, which he much fear'd; yet Maharbal, Hamilcar's Son, went on so fiercely, that none could ob∣serve the Generals absence, pulling down the new Wall in three several Pla∣ces, and setting upon them with such fury, that he made himself Master of some of their Fortifications. The Business seeming thus to be finish'd, the Be∣sieg'd besought that they might Treat with Hannibal concerning Peace: But the disturb'd General was too much incens'd to give ear thereto; yet by the Entreaties of the Spaniard Alorcus, they obtain'd so much at last, that Hannibal would permit the Saguntines to depart, and inhabit in such Countreys as he should appoint for them; but that they should leave all their Gold, Silver, and other Treasures behind. With these Proposals of Agreement Alorcus went
over the Walls into the City; at whose coming, all the Council gather'd: Thither the People also repair'd from all Corners, to hear the News. The chiefest of the Council, without giving any Answer upon the propos'd Arti∣cles, departed and went away, bringing their greatest Treasures into the Mar∣ket-place; where setting Fire on them, they also stabb'd themselves,The Saguntines burn themselves and their City. and fell in the Flames. This occasion'd a sudden Alteration, which was agitated by a great Cry from the Fortification; for a Tower having been storm'd and shaken a long time, fell to the Ground, which making a great Gap in the Walls, a whole Band of Africans, seeing the Guards fled to the Market-place, throng'd in: Of which Hannibal having sudden notice, immediately enter'd the City, without any resistance, with several thousand Men: But the Citizens, in like manner as Xibatadono, in a moment set Fire on all their Houses, chusing rather to be burnt with their Wives and Children, than to be slain by Hanni∣bal's Sword. Thus Toquixiro having Conquer'd Xibatadono's Castle, he return'd to Meaco, where he not only chang'd his first Name Toquixiro, but also his second, Faxiba, which Nobunanga had given him, calling himself Cambacun∣dono, that is, Supreme Lord of Japan; and after that, Anno 1504. took upon him the Name of Taicosama, that is, Mighty Emperor. Policy of Taicosama.¶ BUt though he had thus brought under his absolute Subjection the whole Island, yet he warily consider'd how to prevent future Inconvenien∣ces, and what might happen to his prejudice under his new Acquirements: For several of his Substitute Kings being of Ancient Royal Blood, would not easily submit themselves to an Emperor of so mean an Extract; and that if any of them should but once appear against him, it might shake his new-laid Foundation, and the whole Fabrick of his Government, the rest of the Princes being ready to follow their Examples, which might suddenly cause a general Defection, and so his utter Ruine: To prevent all which, he had need to be very circumspect. Whereupon, after serious consideration, Taicosama thought no way convenienter, than to employ these Princes, and busie them where they might spend their Time, and show their Valour in some Foreign Countrey. Which Design to effect, the neighboring Corea gave him a fit Opportunity. Description of Corea.¶ THis Countrey is divided into eight Territories, namely, Kinki, Hoan∣chai, Kyangyven, Civenlo, Kingxan, Changoing, Kaokiuli, and Pingan. On the North it joyns to Niuche in Tartary; the South respects the Island Fungma; the West is wash'd by the Stream Galo, and the remaining part the Ocean bor∣ders. The Chineses call it Chaosie. Its Length extends to two hundred and se∣venty German Miles, and its Breadth thirty. The Province Kinke is adorn'd with the Metropolis Pingjang. The whole Countrey is exceeding Populous: The Towns very many; most of them built square, after the Chinese manner, whose Fashions, Language, Letters, Religion, and Government, the Coreans follow; which is no wonder, because the Chinese Emperor Hoavus subdu'd them two hundred Years before. The Transmigration of the Soul into all manner of Bodies,Their Religion. is firmly be∣liev'd amongst them. Their dead Corps are laid in Coffins, curiously adorn'd, and not buried before the third Year after their Death;Strange customs. but to keep in the ill scent which might get through the crevices, they glue the Coffins close up with
Lime or Clay, call'd Cie. The Chineses account them barbarous, because they give their Women so much liberty, suffering them walk in the Streets, or come in the company of men when they please; and also, because their Marriages are perform'd without the liking of any of their Friends and Relations, the choice thereof being onely left to the Bride and Bridegroom. The Soyl of this Countrey being very fruitful, produces Rice, and Tares twice a year; no place affords better Paper and Cie, by some call'd Sandaracha, than this Isle: This Sandaracha is much us'd by the Chineses and Japanners, for they Plaister all their Walls with that Lime. Great wars in this half Island.¶ MOreover, Corea hath oftentimes been destroy'd and ruin'd, and lately in the Year twenty seven, it suffer'd extremely, both by the hands of their Enemies, and supposed Friends. The Chinesy General, Maovenlung, had an Army that quarter'd here against the Tartars; his Souldiers being spread over all parts of the Countrey, and lying idle, committed many outrages on the Coreans, which at last grew so unsuffer∣able, that they call'd in the Tartars for their Aid, who imbracing this proffer with great eagerness, contriv'd a subtil Plot, which redown'd to their great advantage; for the Tartars Army came marching with a Van-guard of Coreans in the Front, on purpose to surpress Maovenlung, by mistaking them to be all Coreans; which as contriv'd, happen'd, for by this means, the Tartar fell sud∣denly into the Chinesi's Quarters, and e're he could rally his Forces lying about, he suffer'd great losses; but after a while gathering, and being drawn up in a Body, he gave them so sharp an Entertainment, which put them to a stand, the event thereof doubtful, on what side the Victory would fall; yet at last, the Tartars press'd so upon them, that Moavenlung lost ground, and retreated so by degrees, that getting near the Sea, he sav'd most of his Men aboard of seve∣ral Ships that lay there: This Victory cost the Conqueror dear, and being the more displeas'd, because Moavenlung had thus got off from him; which to re∣venge, fell treacherously upon the Coreans. The four Northern Territories bordering next to Tartary, he had already miserably ruin'd, when the King of Corea rais'd an Army to oppose the Tartars (who then design'd to Besiege the Metropolis Pingjang) chusing a convenient place for Ambuscade, to surprise them in their March, and, as design'd, sud∣denly sallied out upon them, suspecting there no Opposition; both Sides fight∣ing very fiercely: Yet the Coreans, for all their Advantage, had been utterly defeated,A cruel battel betwixt three enemies. but that Moavenlung accidentally fell into their assistance, being new∣ly Landed, galling the Tartars in the Rear; who seeing themselves block'd up, as in a Sack, steep Mountains on each side, before them the Coreans, and behind the Chineses, would not stand still in this exigency or danger, for they saw no way to get out, but what the Sword must make, whereupon they ga∣thering fresh courage, a cruel fight began, the like scarce ever heard of by An∣tiquity: The Tartars at last made their way through the Chineses, and fled Northerly towards the Kingdom of Niuche, leaving behind him (as they say) on the spot fifty thousand men; neither had the Chineses, nor the Coreans this Victory for nothing, for the first bought it with ninety thousand men, and the other with seventy thousand, insomuch, partly, that neither could boast their victory, or pursue the flying Tartar.
Taicosama sends a mighty Army of Japanners to war against Corea.¶ TO this Peninsula, Anno 1595. Taicosama sent his new-rais'd Army, being minded to free himself from the powerful Kings in his Countrey, which he fear'd might joyn their Forces together, and remove him, being of mean Extract, from the Imperial Throne, he pretended that Japan would be mightily inrich'd, if Corea could be joyn'd to that Crown, and such a weighty matter might easily be performed, being able to raise an Army that should conquer five such places as Corea; Whereupon the Kings which he fear'd most, were sent for to come to the Emperor, who giving them several Commands, Imbark'd them with sixty thousand men for Corea, where Landing, they found more work than they expected, so that the War continu'd a long time;The war lasts seven years. during which, Taicosama sent them friendly Letters, and fresh Supplies, yet it pleas'd them not to be absent so long from their own Countrey, Wives and Children, and to be amongst their Enemies, without seeing any hopes of being releas'd; for none durst return home without the Emperors Licence. Description of the Phili∣pines.¶ DUring the War in Corea, Taicosama's mind was also busi'd with other matters of Consequence; he sent in the beginning of his Reign a Letter to the Governor of the Philipines, who was the King of Spain's Viceroy, and kept his Court within the City Manilla. The Castilians discover'd these Islands, Anno 1564. and made themselves Masters thereof with little trouble; because the Inhabitants belonging formerly to China, deserted that Govern∣ment, and since liv'd wildly without any Laws; but though the Chineses lost their Government there, yet for the fruitfulness of the Islands, they still Tra∣ded thither, sending yearly twenty Jonks, or more, Bartering Cotton, Silk, Pur∣celine, Brimstone, Iron, Copper, Mille, Quicksilver, Gunpowder, and Linnen, for Buffles, Deer-Skins, and Civet Cats. A Letter of Taicosama to the Governor of the Phili∣pines.¶ BUt concerning Taicosama's Letter, the Contents of it were thus: Japan, which hath so long been shaken by a Tempest of War, is now calm and settled in quiet, which ceased not before the gods fix'd him in the Imperial Throne, being the labor of ten years: Now I have leisure, I will fall upon the Chineses, and if you perform your duties, acknowledging me with all humbleness, to be that which I am, your Chief Commander, you shall not receive any damage by the Japan Arms, which else I will send to you, and endeavor to possess the Philipines to your utter destruction. The Governor of the Philipines stood amaz'd at this strange Letter, very well knowing the Power, Pride, and Ambition of Taicosama, whose Friendship, if he would preserve, he had no other means but to answer him with all respects; for which purpose, he sent Lupo de Liano, with Missives to signifie to the Em∣peror, That the Philipines Governor had receiv'd a Letter from his Imperial Majesty, but without being Sign'd by his Royal Hand, therefore he had not the confidence that he could willingly have wish'd for, especially, because the Jesuites in Nangesaque (who held some Correspondency with him) had given him no manner of Intelligence thereof. This Answer, not onely displeas'd the Japan Emperor, but he was much startled thereat, because no Transactions, nor ought else, private or publick, that was worthy of information could happen,Hazart. Church Hist 5.6.9. but as Father Hazart says in his Church History, the Jesuites gave Intelligence of to their Concerns abroad, which they well observ'd, and left no stone unturn'd, that might improve their in∣telligence.
This jealousie of the Emperor was fomented by an Apostate Castilian at Saxuma, who being revolted from his Religion, became a severe Persecutor of the Christian Faith; insinuating to the Emperor, that the Jesuites would never be obedient, longer than needs must, to his Commands; and the whole Design was, to introduce their Doctrine amongst the Japanners, which was no other, but to ferment Sedition to such a Rebellion, that first might tread down all subordinate Authority, and at last supplant the Emperor himself, and so bring the whole Nation under the Subjection of that Catholick Tyrant, the King of Spain. A second Embassy from the Philipines to Taicosama.Upon which, Taicosama sent another Mandatory Letter to the Governor of the Philipines, which, the Ship being lost by the way, he never saw; but soon af∣ter hearing thereof, sent a second Embassy over. The Chief in Commission was Peter Gonsalves, his assistance four Franciscan Monks, Bartholomew Ruiz, Fran∣cisco de Sancto Michael, Peter Baptista, and Gonzales Garcia, Anno 1593. they had their Audience before Taicosoma, presenting him with Gifts of great value; which pleas'd the Emperor so well, that his former jealousies being quite blown over,The Franciscans built a Church in Japan. he granted the Friers leave to build a Church and Cloyster near Meaco, provided, that they should not meddle with his Subjects, nor perswade them neither in private or publick concerning matters of Religion, all which they promis'd, and in a years time rais'd a Church, Consecrating it to the Vir∣gin Mary of Portiuncula; but however, notwithstanding all this, they busied themselves clandestinely and often in publick, to raise Proselites, which Do∣ctrine spread every where in short time amongst the Japanners, who imbrac'd Christianity with such eagerness, and came flocking to them in such multitudes, that these four were not able to perform their Functions at the Ceremony, be∣longing to their Conversion and Baptism; for which cause they sent for assi∣stance to the Manilla's; from whence soon after came the Franciscans, Augustin, Rodrigo, Marcello Ribadeneyra, and Hieronimo de Jesu, with Letters and Gifts from the Governor of the Philipines to Taicosama, to whom the Presents were ve∣ry acceptable; but the Letters unpleasing, seeing they answer'd him not to what he had written. Franciscans build Cloy∣sters in Japan.Peter Baptista, was the chief of the Friers which so spread their Religion, that they built another Cloyster, calling it Bethlehem in Osacca. Moreover, they obtain'd liberty of the Governor of Meaco to build a third Cloyster at Nangesaque, under pretence of two sick Brothers, Peter Baptista, and Hieronimo de Jesu, which could not agree with the Air about Osacca, so that for their health-sake, they were necessitated to remove: These two went and resided in a Chappel Dedicated to Lazarus, standing near Meaco, between two Alms-houses, which were govern'd by the two Brothers of Mercy. Thither a great number of people flock'd daily from the City to see them perform Mass, and hear their Disputations. A Japan Nobleman, erects an Order of the Vir∣gin Mary.¶ AMongst whom came a Noble Person, call'd Didacus Gonnoi, who soon after imbracing the Roman Religion, was a great Promoter of it in the Territory, near the City Macava; insomuch, that he Indow'd a Brotherhood with Means, and built a Colledge, Dedicating the Society to the Holy Virgin, who also invited the Heathens to the hearing of the Gospel. Why Taicosania permitted the Friers to be in Japan.Taicosama seem'd to wink at this nestling of the Monks, sent from the Philipines to Japan, because those Islands brought him in yearly a great Revenue; and amongst other Rarities which came from thence, were certain Pots or Cruises,
call'd Boioni, which might be had there at a mean Price, but by the Japanners va∣lu'd above Gold, because no Vessels whatsoever preserves their Liquor, mixt with the Powder Chia, better than these Cruises: This Drink the Noblest men in the Countrey make with their own hands, in a peculiar place of their Houses, built for that purpose. Trades in Cruises.Taicosama sent two Persons to the Philipines, to buy up all these Pots, being certain to make vast profit thereof. But these his Factors found in the City Manilla several Japan Christians, which bought up all those Vessels, with inten∣tion to dispose of them again in Japan. Taicosama being inform'd thereof, took all those Traders, and seiz'd upon all their Cruises which he could light on, and forbad them upon pain of death, not to bring any more thereof into his Dominions; so they escaping narrowly with their lives, were again re∣leased. Promotes his Brothers Sons to high dignities.¶ BUt before Taicosama began the Wars with the Coreans, he Promoted his Brothers Sons, having no Children of his own, to high Dignities and Honor; the eldest, whom he alotted to be his Successor, he Crown'd King over five Kingdoms; the second over three, lying near Meaco; and to the youngest, he gave two; preserving fifteen for himself, with the Supreme Com∣mand over all. The remaining Provinces and Territories were divided amongst his Courtiers, Generals, and nearest Friends, with Proviso's, to pay an Annual Tribute to the Emperor. But those Princes which were not remo∣ved, were oppress'd by Taxes, that they were scarce able to rebel, living conti∣nually in fear, on one time or other to loose life and all. His intention about the common War. And indeed it was so design'd, for he had no other intention to make Wars with the Coreans, but that those Kings which he sent thither might be ruin'd there, or at least so much Work to do, that they should not disturb him in his Dominions; or if they should in any time Conquer Corea, then he would give them the Conquer'd Territories in exchange for those in Japan, that so he might be absolute Governor over his own Empire at home. Pretends to give over his authority.And that none might suspect this his Design, he pretended that he would no longer Administer, but give over his Imperial Authority to his eldest Nephew of twenty five years of age; Whereupon he nominated him the Quabacondono, which name is onely given to those that are Heir-apparent: But this was but dissembled, for though he Nominated him, yet he no ways intended, nor did part with his Authority. But the Kings and Princes which he imploy'd for Corea, never scented in the least that he had laid this Plot for their destruction, and the enjoying of their Estates, pretending nothing, but the care of theirs and the publick good; so that they went chearfully abroad, with an Army of sixty thousand men,Japan Forces goes to Co∣rea. and soon after follow'd a hundred and forty thousand more, which Forces Land∣ing in Corea, in a short time carrying all before them, made themselves Masters of the Metropolis Pingjang, and most part of the Island; yet oft they met with repulses and great obstructions for the Chinese Auxiliaries,Chineses assist the Coreans. which still came fresh and fresh, maintaining a doubtful War six years, and drove them at last towards their Landing-place,Beat the Japanners from Corea. where they were sorely gall'd by twelve well man'd Fortresses, that oft Sally'd out upon them; so that they were forc'd to make a dishonorable Peace, the relinquishing of all their Conquest in Corea.
Thus ended the War, which exhausted Taicosama's Treasure, and spent him a hundred thousand men, amongst which, his second Nephew, whose youngest brother dy'd before. Quabacondono commits great outrages in Japan.The eldest made Quabacondono, was yet living, he being witty and quick of apprehension, yet was most inhumanely cruel, for his greatest delight was Butchering of Men in a humane Shambles, which he had thus contriv'd him∣self, in a place near his Palace, in the middle of an open Court, inclos'd with a Wall, and strow'd all over with white Sand, stood a great Table, whereon, when he wanted Criminals, who ever he had a picque against, or had a desire to see how he would die, where laid according to his Fancy, then began his sole Delight and chief Recreation, This he Quarters with great Art and Dexte∣rity; which done, rips up his reaking Bowels, yet alive, and when percei∣ving with the effusion of Blood and Spirit before his last Gasp, to feast his Cruelty, chops off his Head; That he binds to a Post, so that he may not stir, then takes his Bowes, Arrows, and several Guns, taking aim here and there, where Wounds are not Mortal, and when he perceives him full of Torture with Bullets and Arrows hanging in his Legs and Thighs, then to Crown his pleasure, shoots him in the Breast and Belly, whilest dying, to close up the Tra∣gedy, he claps a Brace of Bullets into the Head: But when thus he hath satia∣ted his Cruelty upon Men, to renew his delight, he takes a Woman with Child, and in stead of Butchering, Anatomizes alive, viewing the Infant in the Womb, and making inspection through all the Labratories of Nature, concerning the Formation, Production, and the Birth of Mankind; and (as they affirm) what ever infliction hath been exercis'd by the most cruellest Tyrants, he hath so much exceeded, that he may be call'd The Prince of such Bloody Butchers; Phalaris Bull, and many other of the like inventions,Cruelties of Phalaris. Of Atreus. Of Tullia. seeming to this but easie torments; be∣sides, he excell'd all those Masters of Cruelty, because he troubled none with the horrid Office, but was their Salvage Executioner himself. The reasons from whence the malice proceeded be∣tween Quabacondono and his Unkle TaicosamaBut this inhumane Monster, not long Raign'd thus, perpetrating such un∣heard of Murders, for his Unckle Taicosoma, though he had chosen him his Succes∣sor, declaring him Heir-apparent, and already put him in possession of five Kingdoms, suddenly this his sweetning and love towards him turn'd into hate, upon several occasions; for though Quabacondono was Elected by his Unckle, and stil'd Emperor, this his great Name bore but small Command, for he ad∣ministred in all Affairs of State himself, keeping the Reins of Government in his own hands, whilst the Favorites and flatteries about the young Emperor weary'd his Ears, insinuating, that he was but a Nominal Prince, and how the People mock'd at his great, but empty Name, which signifi'd just nothing, calling him Emperor without Empire; and that the blindest might see Taicosama's aims, who had twice intended to send him to Corea, where he might ei∣ther be dispatch'd, or lingering in such a long War, loose all his Interest at home, but incourag'd him, not onely with the Conquest of that Isle, but that he would enable him with Forces to Conquer the main Land, China, and there make himself an Emperor: But the business of Corea falling unsuccessful, what e're he flattering, pretended, or secretly intended, the whole design fell, and came to nothing. But concerning the practices of both these Princes, Unckle, and the Nephew, and their Plots of destroying each other, since the Relation stands for an attest∣ed truth, we shall at large give you the whole account.
Taicosama hath a son in his old age.QUabacondono's Fears and Jealousies daily increasing on several occasions, but more especially exasperated thus: Taicosama being without any Issue, on which account he made him Heir-apparent, and had Invested him in all his own Regalities, now had a Son, who by Birth and Laws of Nature might possibly sway the Empire after his Father Taicosama's Decease; whose Genethliacon, or Birth-day was kept with all the Joy and Celebration that could be imagined in Festivals, and Thanksgiving to their gods through all the Cities in Japan, that Quabacondono, beyond all expectation, had an Heir in his old Age: This stung him to the heart, being evidently bereav'd of the Empire; but that which more imbitter'd his grief, were his three Sons, the hopes of his Family, which he had already design'd to bear the Chief Com∣mands under him in the Empire: His hopes thus vanishing like a Dream, all that he could bethink himself of, for present redress, was to cast out, that this Son was none of his begetting, and that they might well have spar'd their Fe∣stival Rejoycing, if the truth were known: The Emperor Taicosama being in∣form'd that this Fame was of his Nephew's broaching, stirr'd up private Ani∣mosities the more, so that the whole Nation sat as in a Theatre, expecting on the Japan Stage the Bloody Tragedy, either of the Unckle, Nephew, or both. Strange custom in Japan, when the Emperors give o∣ver their Government.¶ DUring these private Grudges, the time came on in which Taicosama, ac∣cording to the Japan manner, was to give his Nephew Quabacondono a Visit; for it was an antient Custom, that when the Chief Governor volunta∣rily deserts his Authority, investing another, being grown old and retiring to privacy, that not onely he, but all the substitute Kings should address them∣selves, and honor him with a Visit; which Confirmation of his Authority, the manner of which being so expensive and Magnificent, it will not be amiss here to relate. The Emperor preparing for his Progress, and the Nephew to Entertain his expected coming, sent Huntsmen by thousands to ransack the wide Forests for Venison; as many Fishermen searching the Sea, Ponds, Lakes, and Rivers for Scaly Banquets. How the Japanners keep their feasts.¶ THe Japanners at Meals sit cross Legg'd on the ground one behind an∣other, each at a peculiar Table, which being square, are a Foot and a half high, and according to the conditions of the People, more or less, Costly; some made of white shining Wood like Glass; some richly Varnish∣ed; other Wax'd, after the Indian manner; and some Inlaid with Gold, ac∣cording to the greatness of the Feast, or the number of the Tables; at ordina∣ry Dinners, or at the first Course, three Tables set before every one with great Variety, Dish'd up all Gilded: At the last Course, they bring three Tables more full of Salt Meats to rellish their Cups. At the Emperors Feast, a great Golden Bowl call'd Sacansuchi, is carry'd about,Cup call'd Sacansuchi. out of which the Princes are invited to drink. Quabacondono had prepar'd against this Feast thirty thousand of these Tables, of several fashions, both for Men and Women: The Women sit out of the sight of the Men in a Hall apart. On the other side, Taicosama was ready for the accustomary Visit to Quabacon∣dono, who in like manner was ready to receive him.
Taicosama puts off his journey.When an eminent Person that had the Emperors Ear privately inform'd him, That these gallant Preparations vail'd a secret Plot for his Ruin; This warn∣ing wrought so on Taicosama, that he put off the Journey, which Quabacondono resented very ill, having prepar'd all things in a readiness, which were now lost, and all his Cost and Charge bestow'd in vain; and besides that, he sus∣pected some mystery that should thus suddenly retard him, being ready for his intended Progress. Mean while, he carry'd himself so cunningly, and with such humility, ta∣king no notice of his Jealousies or Discontent, that he made him change his Resolution; so that he set forth eight days after the first appointed time on his Progress; for if he had not gone, it would have been look'd upon as ill-na∣tur'd, and that he sleighted the company of the several Princes, which were to be also at the Feast. The Progress was perform'd in the following manner: Goes to visit Quabacon∣dono. Sumptuous train of Man∣docorosama, Taicosama his Consort.¶ TAicosama sent his Empress Mandocorosama before him, which then resi∣ded in Fissima, three Miles from Meaco: In sumptuous manner she led the way, before her went a great number of Nobles, marching in order, more than an hour passing along; these had several Files of Musqueteers, being their Guard walking before them, their Arms being Varnish'd, glitter'd against the Sun like Gold; behind the Nobles were carry'd three great Wax'd Chests, with the Empress Mandocorosama's Apparel; after these came fifty more that bore Vestments of her Ladies of Honor; these were follow'd by six∣teen brave Horses, Loaden with Gold, cover'd with Sumpter-Clothes Im∣broyder'd with Pearls, Plumes waving on their Heads, the Richness of which amaz'd the beholders: Which Gold was an accustom'd Present from the Emperor and Empress to the young Emperor. Next, march'd in a Cavalcade bravely Mounted, fifty prime Lords belonging to the Court, each attended by thirty Pages; then came eight Quirosols or Sedans, each carry'd by thirty two
men, in these the prime Ladies of Honor sate, which were follow'd by Man∣docorosama in a Sedan, carry'd on the shoulders of Persons of great Quality; this Sedan, or rather, Moving-house, was so curiously Wrought with Carv'd Work, that the Artists not onely got great Reputation for their several hands, but an incredible Sum of Money for their Reward of well-doing, from the Empress; in this she sate so private, that she could be seen by none, but her self might see whom she pleas'd, then follow'd a hundred Sedans more, of the same fashion, but of less value, in which sate several Queens and Princesses, gaudily drest, attended by a hundred and fifty Ladies of Honor, all gallantly mounted, with Silken Vails, each of them attended by a great number of Lac∣quies, and a Groom waiting, with two led Horses. And lastly, The whole Procession was clos'd by the several Maids of Ho∣nor, carry'd in little two-Wheel'd Chariots, which as the Print represents, are shod at the ends with Plates of Silver and Gilt; the Spokes of Cedar, Carv'd and Gilt, the Fellies of the Wheels shod also with Copper; the Seat in the Stern, fitted to hold one in great State, spread with Tapistry, which hangs down be∣twixt the Wheels; the empty part before fashion'd like an Oval, is open, she having a stately Canopy over her, defends her from Rain and the Sun, and when she pleases, she draws her ty'd-up Curtains to keep off the Wind, being driven along by a lusty Man, with two Poles athwart his shoulders: With this Train, Mandocorosama enter'd the Burrough Jurazu, presenting to Quabacondono a great Mass of Gold, and other inestimable Jewels; which kindness of hers was bountifully rewarded by Quabacondono, who was also very liberal in bestow∣ing the like rich Presents on her. Sumptuous train of Tai∣cosama, going to Quabacon∣dono.The following day, Taicosama came from his Castle, from whence, a little before, most of the Japan Nobility went to Juraru; the ways between Taicosa∣ma's Palace and Juraru, were Guarded on both sides by Souldiers, each standing two strides from the other, Arm'd with a naked Scymiter; these belong'd, and were under the Command of the Lord of Mino, Grand-Son of the slain Em∣peror Nobunanga, and therefore the just Heir to the Crown: Between these Guards, past first three hundred Persons of prime quality, every one having their several Escutchions, with all their Emblasonings, carry'd before them, with clusters of Pages and Lacquies; after these came several Princes, some of which carry'd the Swords, others the Daggers and other Arms of Taicosama. These were again follow'd by Taicosama,Taicosama's rich Chariot. who sat on a rich and magnificent Chariot, which had cost him several Tun of Gold, for the sides and middle were adorn'd with unexpressable Imagery and Carv'd Work, and also the four Seats cover'd with Massie Gold, were much to be admir'd; with the Axeltree on which the Wheels turn'd, and the Spokes and Fellies were all of Silver. This Chariot was drawn by two black Oxen with Gilded Horns, their bodies spread over with Purple Clothes, Embroyder'd with Precious Stones. Taicosama us'd these Oxen, not for want of Horses, for several thousands serv'd him in this Train; but as a testimony, that he observ'd the Antient Customs, establish'd many Ages before by the Dayro's, which were always drawn by Oxen, when ever they went to any grand Entertainment, still attended by a Guard of Nobles. Thus attended, Taicosama entred Meaco, where he was met by a thousand, all Persons of Quality, sent from Quabacondono; who as soon as ever they drew near the Emperors Chariot, light from their Steeds, those before Taicosama do∣ing the like; these dividing to each side, standing close up, made a Lane for
the Chariots to meet. Soon after Quabacondono appear'd in his open Chariot, no way inferior to that of Taicosama, being follow'd by the Cunghi Lords, all related to the Dayro, each attended by their several Trains. In the most eminent Streets they drew near, making a stop, whilst Quaba∣condono dispatch'd the Vice-Roy of Meaco, to congratulate Taicosama's Aggress, who sent the Lord of Tangi, to Complement the Messenger sent from Quaba∣condono.Quabacondono meets him. Both meeting and Saluting betwixt the Chariots, and having done their several Congees, the Lord Tangy's Coach return'd; whereupon the Vice-Roy call'd after him, saying, Quabacon vonariscens cu Banazi, that is, Quabacon wishes that your coming to his House may be in the presence of Millions, and last ten thousand Ages; which was answer'd by Taicosama in his Coach with a loud voyce, Sachighe Icatei Icarei, which signifies, Let him drive before, and I will immedi∣ately follow. The whole Train enter the Castle Jurazu.At the end of this Ceremony, the Lords which Guarded one side of the Street, re-mounted their Horses, and follow'd Quabacondono to Jurazu. Taicosama staying some small time, also went on in a good Order: Before the whole Solemnity was past, the Sun had almost finish'd his days Journey. The Master of the Ceremony, to whom the whole Care and Conduct of this Feast was committed, was Genefoin, Governor of Meaco. When Taicosama came before the Castle Jurazu, Riding over the Bridge to the inner Court, there being welcom'd by all the Princes, where he deliver'd his Presents to Quabacondono; who seem'd not able to express the high esteem and value thereof: And that he might no way be indebted to his Unckle for these his great Favors, he return'd his kindness by giving him also many rich Gifts. Sumptuous Entertain∣ment there.Three days did this great Reception and Entertainment last, nothing being wanting that either delighted the Eye, Ear, or Palate: the Tables still cover'd, and full of all manner of Varieties, which the Earth, Sky, and Sea could af∣ford, Dish'd up with all the skill their Cookery could invent, to invite the Palate, and add fresh appetite; Vocal and Instrumental Musick, according to their manner, every where, and in every Room; each day their Theatre throng'd with the primer sort, where they had several Comedies prepar'd by the Learned, and those who were skilful in Poesie, for the present Entertain∣ment,Description of their Tilt∣ing. not wanting variety of Scenes according to the Argument; also in run∣ning at a Carv'd Head (to which sport came the Emperor and all his Nobi∣lity,) some running at it with a Spear, others striking at it with a Bill, and some shooting at it with Bowe and Arrows, or Guns, in manner as appears by the following Sculp. But whilst these Jollities and continual Feastings were perform'd to the heighth, with all the Pomp and Decorum imaginable, the Emperor Taicosama had but little rellish thereof, still alarm'd with fresh fears and jealousies, which Melancholy and Age made greater and more imminent than they were; and though there were something of reality, yet he startled at as many shadows, which often his troubled Fancy presented, expecting hourly some Bloody Plot should discover it self to the danger of his Life: to prevent which, for his better safety, being very subtile, he set private Guards and Watches of those whom he could trust, who still shifting Places, kept all Passages to the Empe∣ror's Lodging, so that none could stir upon any Conspiracy or private Design, but they would as suddenly perceive their Motion, whilst the old Man, a cunning and experienc'd Dissembler, shew'd not the least sign of suspicion, but
with all complacency and kindness, even to doting, courted and flatter'd his young Nephew, seeming not able to forbear to pour out his dear affection, and how much he lov'd him, which appear'd evidently by what he had done, and should be more manifest by what he would do for him; and also told him, that he did assure himself of the like returns of his affections and kindness to∣wards him, since nothing could be more impious and inhumane, than for him to contrive any thing detrimental to his Honor, or dangerous to his Person. The young Emperor was no way wanting in his Expressions, and soft re∣turns to his Unckle, wishing on himself, with many Execrations, some mis∣chief might befall him, or any that ever harbor'd the least thought which migh be prejudicial to his dear Unckle and kind Father, who by his adoption had made him Heir to his Empire, and already possess'd him with five weal∣thy Kingdoms, and now had confirm'd all this by the honor of his Visit. Thus both vizarding their intentions, they play'd a hard and wary Game, whilst all the Court and City saw through the young Man's subtile glozings, that he had no less design, when ever opportunity presented, than the utter ruine and destruction of his Unckle; which his intention on the second Night of this great Entertainment, was verily believ'd to have been put in execution, by an accident that then alarm'd the whole City, which was this: A strange Accident in Jurazn.The Royal Theatre being much too little for so mighty a Concourse as at that time repair'd thither, Noble-men, Princes, nay, Kings themselves, if co∣ming late, were forc'd to return back again, the House being cramm'd so full, and many that were within so thrust and crowded, that they rather suffer'd torture, than any delight from the presented Comedy: to remove this incon∣venience, that there might be nothing wanting at so high an Enterview, and Meeting of so many Princes, there was immediate order given to erect ano∣ther Theatre that Night against the next Day, ample enough to contain so great an Audience: The multitudes of Workmen which were thus suddenly emploi'd, bussling up and down with Lincks and Torches, making every where a con∣fus'd
hurry and noise, which awaked the Court and all Meaco, every one start∣ing from their Beds, believing that what they so much fear'd, was in agitati∣on, at least the death of an Emperor: but day-light approaching, the mistake vanish'd, finding that all this stir was onely about a new Theatre. So this magnificent Feast ended as silently as it began, without any other disturbance than the error of that Night. A sumptuous Banquet prepar'd by Fidandono.From thence both the Emperors were invited with their whole Retinue, to a Dinner prepar'd by Fidandono, one of the greatest Princes in Japan; which was perform'd with such wonderful abundance and Magnificence, that you may compute the extraordinary Charge by the Leaf-gold, which onely trick'd up their Dishes, amounting to above four thousand Crowns, but the charge of their Potations rose much higher; foreach Draught that he drank to the Emperor, which must be nine, the first costing him by way of Present ten thou∣sand Crowns, the second more, so increasing, till the last, doubling the first, came to twenty thousand Crowns; so that the whole Charge of the Treat∣ment seems incredible, being scarce to be reckon'd: all this was to keep in, and preserve his favor with the Emperor. And also by Gietazo.Next day the Emperor Taicosama Progress'd to Gietazo, Governor of eight Provinces, where he was Entertain'd with no less State than by Fidandono. Taicosama comes to Fis∣sima.At last returning to his Court at Fissima, where he invited his Nephew Qua∣bacondono to a Feast, who accordingly came at the appointed time; where he got so much praise and applause by his Dancing, and other more manly Exer∣cises, that Taicosama grew more jealous at this his rising popularity in his own Court. Amongst other great Men and Princes in his Palace was Gefonio, Nephew to the late Emperor Nobunanga, whom Taicosama privately incited, by commending of his agility in the like Exercises, that so encourag'd he might get the same and praise from his Nephew: But he being more wary than to stir up any displeasure from Quabacondono, whom he suppos'd would succeed in the Imperial Throne, perform'd his Exercises rather worse than better, so keeping in favor with the young Emperor: which Taicosama obser∣ving, call'd Gefonio aside, and changing his note, commended now his Pru∣dence beyond his Activity, telling him that he was much troubled, that the Son of such a Father, rais'd to that Dignity and Honor which he now enjoy'd, should be sent thus by his Nephew as an Exile, under the pretence of Com∣manding an Army, to the utmost Confines of his Empire; but he would for his Unckles sake prefer him on the next opportunity to a nearer Employment, and make him a Governor of more Provinces than one; and for the present, as a testimony of his favors, he desir'd him to accept of ten thousand Bags of Rice. But Quabacondono being sumptuously entertain'd in Fissima, would no ways be behind in repaying such Favors to Taicosama: And having erected a stately Palace at Fissima, where he prepar'd a rich and costly Banquet, invited his Unckle Taicosama thither; who fearing to deny the Request, yet put it off from day to day, under a pretence of indisposedness. which continu'd so long, that Quabocondono observing it to be onely an excuse,Quabacondono parts dis∣contented from Taicosama. return'd much displeas'd to Jurazu: This stirr'd up in him distrusts, and thoughts of self-preservation, and his Unckles destruction; but all this he kept secret, as if he seem'd not to have the least thought thereof, spending much of his time in seeing Sports and Exercises, inviting whoever were famous for Dancing, Fencing, Wrestling, Archery, Martial Discipline, and the like, with several Prizes and Rewards to
the Victor, whilst he exercis'd himself in that cruel and bloody sport of Butchery, in publick showing his dexterity and skill in mangling humane Bo∣dies as we said before; and also more insinuating himself with flatteries and doing good offices, into the favor of several Japan Princes:Endeavors by Scirabin∣go's means to obtain the King's Favorites. To which purpose he employ'd his prime Favorite Scirabingo, whom he sent every where to in∣veigle the Princes to take the Oath of Allegiance, and Sign it with their own Hands, and that they would be ready upon the Command of Quabacondono, to raise and bring as many Men into the Field, as his occasions should require: Whereupon Scirabingo dealt first with Achiromar, King of nine Provinces; but he refus'd, saying, Why should I take an Oath of Allegiance, never being suspected in the least that I ever would revolt: Yet several others took the Oath, and deliver'd it Sign'd to Scirabingo. All these Writings were committed to the custody of an antient Matron residing in Quabacondono's Court. But Achiromar who refus'd the Oath, gave private information to Taicosama concerning the Proposals made to him by Scirabingo, in behalf of his Nephew Quabacondono. Quabacondono refuses to come to Taicosama.This Plot seem'd to be of great concern to Taicosama, thinking it fit to lose no time, seeing his Life and all he had lay at stake: whereupon desiring Qua∣bacondono in a friendly manner to come and speak with him about a business of great consequence; but he subtil and conscious of his own private Designs, mi∣strusted some greater matter, and of imminent danger to his Person lay hid, so humbly crav'd his excuse, pretending to be troubled with fits of the Spleen, and overflowing of the Gaul. Requires Answers on five Demands to his Nephew.But Taicosama would not take it so, but sent five Princes, his Favorites, which then resided at his Court, to Quabacondono, impowering them to demand an Answer to his five Queries, which were these: First, How it could be, that one so infirm, as he gives account of himself, could be able daily to perform ro∣bust Exercises, onely fit for healthy Persons in their full strength and vigor? Secondly, How it suited with the honor of an Emperor, to cut and mangle in publick his innocent Subjects? Thirdly, Why he kept so many Soldiers in Arms, thereby disturbing the Empire with fears of some great and sudden alteration? Fourthly, Why he doubled his Life-guard, being Musqueteers, with a thousand Men? Lastly, Why he dealt in private with the Japan Princes, to take the Oath of Allegiance to be faithful to him? Closing with a desire to know if he had any thing to alledge against him. Mean while Taicosama sent a subtil Negotiating old Lady, well stricken in years, to Quabacondono's Court, to prie into affairs, and gather what she could from the present Humor and Discourse there, but especially concerning their opinions of the five Queries. Quabacondono's Answer.The Commissioners presenting the Queries to Quabacondono, he not asking long time to answer, told them, That he was much troubled with the rising of the Spleen, and overflowing of the Gaul, and by the advice of his Doctors he was order'd to lay all business aside, and affairs of State, and follow bodily Exercises for his recovery; That playing the Executioners part was prescrib'd also for his Health, and that none suffer'd by his Hand, but such as were noto∣rious Malefactors; That his Soldiers and double Life-guard were not to em∣broil in War, but to preserve the Peace of the Empire, but more especially to defend his dear Unckle, now grown old, from sudden Insurrections that might arise from the already-murmuring People; and lastly, That the Oath which he requir'd of the Princes, was to keep them in Unity amongst themselves, and better under the subjection of his Imperial Majesty.
Whereupon the Commissioners reply'd, That Taicosama would without all doubt be well satisfi'd with, these his Answers, if he would but be pleas'd to Write and Sign them with his own Hand; which Quabacondono perform'd, and sent with all speed to Taicosama: who as soon as he receiv'd and read the Pa∣per, cry'd out aloud, saying,O apparent testimony of my dear Nephew's innocency! how deceitful is this wicked World! who could believe that scandalous and backbiting Tongues, still buzzing Tales, should raise such misapprehensions between me and my always-faithful Quabacondono? These emphatical Expressions of the old and cunning Dissembler were be∣liev'd to be real, and immediately sent in Writing by his Friends to the young Emperor, which so lull'd him asleep, that he dream'd of nothing less than the secret displeasure of his Unckle: which Taicosama did to no other end, but to get time to strengthen his Forces, which were then too weak to encounter with his Nephew, who was in a ready posture of defence; so that he could not do any thing but by fair means,Raises Forces privately. till such time as his Militia (which he privately rais'd through all Japan) were drawn to Fissima. And indeed he carry'd his De∣sign so closely, that Quabacondona had not the least information of it, little suspect∣ing any thing, because the Princes from all Parts made daily Addresses to him, with joyful Congratulations for the happy and undoubted Reconciliation betwixt him and his Imperial Unckle, whose affections were such, that he would (now growing old) soon establish the sole Government upon his dear Nephew. During this kind correspondency between both, Taicosama had information, how that the Princes which he had commanded, were marching on in their Way from Vacaza to Fissima. And now the time came which he had so long expected to perfect his Design:Threatens Quabacondo∣no exceedingly. whereupon he sent Messengers to Quabacondo∣no, with strict Commands to come to Fissima, and there to answer to whatever should be objected against him; which if he refus'd, he would take such a course, that the present World should tremble thereat, and his Successors stand amaz'd when ever related: for first, he would utterly destroy the Castle Ju∣razu, and all other Buildings rected by Quabacondono, with Fire; and whoever he found that made the least resistance, should perish without mercy by the Sword; and if possible, utterly eface, and cut off his Memory from the Earth. Quabacondono saw himself now in the Trap, and that it was then altogether too late to make the least resistance, since Taicosama had gotten so great an Army together, which he was not able by any means to withstand; so no way but pa∣tience,Quabacondono surrenders himself to his Unckle, and is by him banish'd to the Cloyster Coja. he with a small Train deliver'd up himself to the mercy of his Unckle: the Ways being all beset with strong Guards, about Noon he came to Fissima, and passing by the Palace he took up his Lodging in a private House; but in the Evening he receiv'd Order from Taicosama to retire to the Cloyster Coja, built on the craggy Mountains in the Kingdom of Chinocuno. This Coja was the Residence for all banish'd Princes, before the barren Island Faitsintchina, fourteen Leagues at Sea Eastward from Jedo, was made fit for that purpose. The same Night Quabacondono, being accompany'd with Taicosama's Life∣guard, was convey'd to the place of Exile. The faithfulness of Sa∣condono to the banish'd Emperor.Amongst other Nobles belonging to Taicosama was Sacandono, of eighteen years old, Son to the Vice-Roy of Meaco; he being inform'd that Quabacondono was forsaken of every one, and as a banish'd Person was in his Way to Coja,
immediately Mounted, and posted after him to proffer his Service to Quoba∣condono; but coming amongst the Emperor's Guard, he was stopt, and command∣ed to return, if he did intend not to incur his Majesties displeasure: but he nei∣ther regarding their advice, nor fear what they threatned from the Emperor, said, Should I leave my Prince, though he be forsaken by every one? No; now is the time for me to manifest my Love, Duty, and Loyalty: There is no Touchstone like Danger to prove a Friend by: Who will not help those that are in Prosperity? and who forsakes not a Friend in Adversity: He is not worthy the name of a Friend, that in his assistance will undergo the worst of Fortunes, and smile at Death it self: which having said, put Spurs to his Horse, and Riding post, by midnight found the young Emperor, who exceedingly rejoyced to see one so kind and faithful to him; but that he might not prejudice so good a Nature, as to bring Sacandono to his utter ruine, which would not ought avail him, he seriously perswaded him to return. But soon Taicosama had information of all this; and had it not been for the good Service of his Father, he had undoubtedly perish'd in his prime. Quabacondono is shaven, and changes his Name.But Quabacondono since his departure from Fissima Lodg'd one Night in Tama∣mizu; where he was forc'd, according to the Japan manner, to have his Beard and Head shaven, and his Name exchang'd for another; for in stead of Quaba∣condono, he call'd himself Doi, that is, I will clear my self by Reason: At last co∣ming to the Cloyster Coja, he was conducted in by Mocusico, one much esteem'd by the Bonzies. In his Way thither he met with several of his Retinue disguis'd like Beg∣gars, that they might not be known by any of Taicosama's Guard. All these express'd their grief with tears, not daring to utter their minds in words. Ten of his chief Favorites went him into the Cloyster, where being but meanly Treated, he told them, saying, Not long ago I could have given you Provinces and Kingdoms: my Fall hath been the undoing of many. And now for my self, of all my Pomp and Magnificence I have scarce so much left as to keep you and me alive. O incon∣stant Fortune! thou hast rais'd me on purpose to the heighth of Greatness and Glory, that so my Fall might be the greater, and I more wretched. Is liept close Prisoner.These Complaints he had free liberty to utter in the fatal Cloyster Coja, for no other priviledge was allow'd him, insomuch that he could not speak nor deliver the least Note to any Person whatsoever; and the business was so far gone, that he lost all hopes of ever obtaining his Liberty. Mocusico Conjures for Quabacondono.Mocusico, the Head of the Monastery, repair'd to his Idols, and with Charms performing peculiar Ceremonies, with great zeal begg'd of the gods, that Quabacondono might once more be restor'd to the Imperial Dignity; but none ever were slower in their assistance than these their deaf deities: for it happen'd that this came to Taicosama's Ears, who the sooner resolv'd on Quabacondono's Death, which fell out on the fifteenth of August, Anno 1595. It's certain that Quabacondono, being weary'd with his misfortunes, did a long time before resolve to be his own Executioner; but his Friends observing his intention from his discontented Countenance, and strange Carriage, sometimes walking up and down like a Frantick, anon sitting exceeding pensive and me∣lancholly, stil when in private muttering to himself, and fetching heavy sighs, then breaking out with strange Expressions, showing the deep sense he had of his present Condition; but they endeavor'd by all means to appease him, and bring his Mind to a more equal temper, to bear his Sufferings like a Man, chear∣ing him up with this perswasion, That his Unckle would after a while grow mild, his high displeasure cease; and that it was impossile for him to be so un∣kind
to such a Nephew: He had oftentimes before been displeas'd, and was as easily reconcil'd; what madness would it be for him to bereave himself not one∣ly of Life, but of the Imperial Throne? and though he had no hope of it, yet he ought not to despair; and fortune was so unconstant, that oftentimes the meanest were rais'd to high Dignities: and that it behov'd a Prince to have and bear a noble courage in his greatest calamity, and not suffer any sorrow whatsoever to take possession of his heart; and that without dispute Taisacoma could not live long, at whose Decease they doubted not but to be released, and he restor'd to his former Honor. The Japanners were now curb'd and kept in fear, but so soon as they could be freed thereof they would not be so forget∣ful, but remember that Taicosama had given the Empire to Quabacondono, to whom it belong'd in his Life-time, and therefore was most justly his after the Emperor's death. Quabacondono and all his Company are commanded to rip up their own Bowels.Thus chearing him up with future hopes, they kept him a while from lay∣ing violent hands on himself, when soon after Taicosama sent a Messenger, to command him and his Company, according to the Japan manner, to rip open their own Bowels. No sooner had they receiv'd their Condemnation, but they all prepar'd themselves to die. The first that cut up his Belly was Quaba∣condono's Page, being a Youth of nineteen years of age; who whilst he was struggling with Death, Quabacondono, after he had embraced him, chopp'd off his Head, which he set in a Charger on a Table: The like he perform'd to two more of his Servants. The next that was to do the cruel Office on him∣self, was the Bonzi (Biuscirtus, whose Grandmother was sent by Taicosama to Quabacondono's Court as a Spie; and because she had carry'd her self well in that business, her Son Biuscirtus he commanded to be sav'd: but he refus'd the Em∣peror's mercy, saying with an undaunted courage to him that brought the Or∣der, I scorn to take any thing from that Bloodhound that should deserve my thanks, for I will rather chuse to die with Quabacondono, than to live in slavery under such a grand Tyrant: this said, he desperately stabb'd himself; but suffering much under
the agony of a lingring Death, Quabacondono gave him present ease by chop∣ping off his Head; which was no sooner done, but with the same Weapon he stabb'd himself. One onely remaining, slew himself with his Masters Scymi∣ter. The Execution was no sooner finish'd, but the Bonzies, performing their Office, consum'd them together in one Funeral Fire. Taicosama destroys all the Confederates of Quaba∣condono.But Taicosama rested not thus; but following his Blow, hunted and de∣stroy'd all those his Friends and Intimates that had been Abettors with Quaba∣condono in this Conspiracy. The first with which he began, were three Per∣sons of great Quality, that were fled to a Cloyster of the Bonzies: The next was Scirabingo, who made the Kings to Sign the Oath of Allegiance to Quaba∣condono, for which Crime he was judg'd to suffer a cruel Death: But none was more lamented than Chimura, who had done Taicosama great Service, both in War and Peace; but because he had held private Correspondence with Quaba∣condono, he was also condemn'd to be his own Destroyer. Chimura's Son hearing of his Fathers Misfortune, who was then in Saicoure, wrote to him, That a Wise-man might easily look Death in the face, especially if he suf∣fer'd innocently; and that it was no trouble to leave this World, for a far more happy Life, which would last for ever: And thither he was resolv'd to accompany him, as his Fa∣ther; for he would not live after his Death, of whom he had receiv'd Life. So whilst he expected to hear the sad Tydings, he call'd for a Chest of Scymiters, out of which chusing the best, he girded it about his Waste. In the interim the News of his Fathers Death, and Taicosama came to him together; the Emperor proffering him Life, notwithstanding he was Chimura's Son, who ought, accord∣ing to the Japan Laws, for his Fathers Crime, to suffer Death. But the Youth return'd Taicosama Thanks, telling him, That he was bound in Conscience to take Revenge of the horrible Slaughter committed on his Father Chimura; and seeing no possible Means to effect such his Design, he would rather die than live, want∣ing satisfaction for his Fathers Death. Thus said, he immediately deserted the Court, and went to Meaco, where going into the Temple, there offering his Devotions to the Idol Fotoco, ripping up his Belly, he Sacrific'd his Life before the Altar. Not long after, Taicosama particularly order'd Chimura's Consort to be Beheaded in the Temple of Amida. Cruel Persecution of Tai∣cosama against the Wives and Children of Quaba∣condono.¶ IN this cruel manner proceeded Taicosama against all Quabacondon's, not on∣ly his Ministers of State, or whoever he had a kindness for, but his Wives, Children, and Relations; not leaving to persecute them, till they all suffer'd miserable Ends: In Meaco he brought one and thirty Ladies, partly Noblemens Daughters, partly Persons of Honor belonging to Quabacondono's Consort, and part of them his Concubines, which last he fetch'd from the Ca∣stle Jurazu: All these he convey'd in Coaches to the place of Execution, with their Children, whose innocent Shrieks and Tears, mingled with the doleful Lamentations of the Spectators, would have made a Tyger relent: But there was no room for Compassion; for no sooner arriv'd they at the fatal place of their Deaths, but the Executioner first shewing them Quabacondono's Head, to which they ail reverently bow'd, began the Slaughter, first with the Children, that were one by one beheaded; next the Women, thrown to the Ground, were inhumanely slaughter'd, and their Bodies cast into a deep Pit, over which the Tyrant built a Structure, which he call'd The Temple of Beasts. Murder committed by Scirabingo's Widow.After that he condemn'd the Widow and Children of Scirabingo to suffer Death; but when the Coach that brought her stopp'd before the Palace, the
Widow, to free her self from the opprobrious Insultings of the Tyrant, and the Shame of her undeserved Death, first stabb'd her three Sons, and one Daughter, and ere the Fact could be thought of, sheath'd the same Dagger in her own Bosom, and immediately fell breathless on her murder'd Children. These savage Barbarisms perpetrated on Rational Creatures, he rag'd next upon inanimates, falling upon the Castle of Jurazu, which he pull'd down to the Ground, with three hundred Palaces more, carrying the Timber and Stones to Fissima. ¶ BUt this was not Taicosama's first Persecution of the Christians, having be∣gun before, in Anno 1587. if Father Cornelius Hazart may be credited upon this occasion.The first occasion why Taicosama persecuted the Roman Christians. The Commander Domingo Montero came from Portugal into the Haven of Firando, with an exceeding stout Vessel, in the forementi∣on'd Year: All the Inhabitants admir'd its Beauty and Largeness, that the Fame of it came to Taicosama's Ear; who being desirous to see it, command∣ed the Ship to be brought to Facata, where he then resided; in order whereto, he directed the Governor of the Jesuits to write his Pleasure to Montero; who so soon as he receiv'd the Letter, went with all speed to Facata, telling the Em∣peror the danger of the Voyage, by reason of the abundance of blind Rocks, Shoals, and Shelves, that lay in the way between Firando and Facata. This Tai∣cosama seem'd to accept as an Excuse; but indeed took it exceeding ill to be thus deny'd his Request, and resolv'd of a speedy Revenge: For on the next day he publish'd Edicts, That all the Jesuits should depart Japan in twenty days, because they endeavor'd to bring a new Religion amongst them, contrary to the Japanners, which had been establish'd there many Ages. The Emperor would have done this long before, but that he staid till he had subdu'd the Kingdom Ximo, in which most of the Christian-Teachers resided. Five Franciscans and three Jesuits crucifid.But it rested not here: For Anno 1596. he proceeded cruelly against the Christians, without distinction, commanding Gibonoscio, Governor of Nangesaque, to take five Franciscans, and three Jesuits, and having Crucified, run them through with Spears. Hazart reports, That the Franciscans were Gonsal∣ves Garcia, Philip de las Casas, both Mexicans; Peter Baptista, Franciscus de Saint Michael, and Martin de Aguirre, three Spaniards: The Jesuits, Paulus Mi∣ki a Japanner; Joannes Goto, and Jacobus Kisai. ¶ AS to what the same Hazart writes concerning the Miracles wrought by these Priests,Hazart, Ch. Hist. l. 6. c. 2. let him believe, who according to St. Augustine, desires and depends upon new Miracles for establishment of Religion, already confirm'd by Wonders:Several Miracles. However take it as related; That Peter Baptista being sent Am∣bassador from Manilla to Tauglama, cur'd a Japan Maid of the Leprosie by touching of her; and that at the same time the like Fiery Tongues descended from Heaven, upon the whole Congregation present at the Cure, as formerly fell on the Apostles in the Feast of Pentecost: That Philippo de las Casas, sailing from Manilla to Mexico, and by stress of Weather driven upon the Coast of Japan, by the way saw in the Air a White Cross, which soon after turn'd Red, and at last was cover'd with a black Cloud. This Cross, they say, had the same shape as that on which he was afterwards Crucified. That Franciscus a Saint Michael immediately cur'd a dumb Japan Woman, and afterwards an Indian, mortally wounded by the Sting of an Adder, by signing them with the Cross. But concerning the Opinion of these Relations,Erasm. Argin. lib. Conf. August. Erasmus says thus: What shall I say of you, which endeavor to delude the Common People, by telling them strange
Wonders and Miracles wrought by your Fraternity? Certain I am, some have judg'd, that by these fair Relations and handsom Stories they stirr'd up the People to Zeal and Piety; but I hardly give credit to such Tales. I will here annex some other Testimonies, extracted from the primest of the Catholicks. That famous Melchior Canus, Bishop of the Canaries,Cani Loc. Theol l.  c. 6. one of the Chiefest in the Council of Trent, says, I must needs speak it with sorrow, That the Lives of the Learned Heathens, describ'd by Laertius, is with more Uprightness, than that of the Christian Saints.— Most of our Writers follow their own Imaginations, and relate so many Fictions, that I am asham'd thereof. Nicholas de Lyra, the younger Brother, who flourish'd about Anno 1320, saith,Lyr. in Dan. ca. 14. In the Church too many Delusions and vain Fantasies are admitted, affirming variety of Wonders, perform'd indeed by the Priests, and their Associates, for Profit sake. So also Cornelius Agrippa tells us,Agrip. de Vanit. Scient. cap. 97. That the Writers of the Saints Histories seem to surpass one another in Fabling; declaring a new Doctrine, and Teaching the Word of God with too great mixture, onely for Lucre and Profit. And Josephus Acosta, who had been through most part of the Western Indies,Acost. lib. tit. 4. cap. 12. de Proc. Indor. Saute. cries out, saying, What is our Preaching? What is our Faith? We do no Miracles: There are no Wonders of our own that we can producce, to confirm the Words of the Gospel. Taicosama falls sick of the Bloody Flux.¶ BUt to return: Taicosama, now wearied with murdering, fell sick of the Bloody-Flux, in the latter end of July, Anno 1598; first vomiting up his Gaul, with some Blood; afterwards in his Stools appear'd the Excoriatings of his Guts; at last pieces of corrupted Flesh came from him, with a horrible stench, and great pain. On the fifth of August greater Signs of Death appear'd, he being continually in a cold Sweat; and seeing thus his End to approach, yet seem'd not the least dismay'd, still ordering his Imperial Affairs as when in perfect Health; his chiefest Care being onely for Fideri, to set the Crown on his Head: And after serious consideration, he found it convenient to make use in this weighty Concern of Ongosschio, King of eight Provinces, and in great esteem with the Japanners, whom he sought by all means possible to oblige; and to that end, sending for him to Fisstima, when he came into his Presence, the Emperor now very weak, faintly declar'd his Mind to this effect. His Speech to Ongosschio.Death sits on my Lips, but I fear it not, since it is incident and common to all Men: The greatest of my trouble is for my Son, but six years old, and therefore not in conditi∣on to take present Possession of my Empire: His Age requires a Guardian, one no less Faithful than Prudent, and who will, when he attains to his fifteenth Year, with the usual Ceremonies, according to the Japan manner, establish him in the Throne. I therefore have thought none more fit than your self, by reason of your admir'd Wisdom, to under∣take so grand a Concern. And here I leave you my Empire and Son, that you may restore it to him when he is fifteen years old. If those former Favors, which I do not doubt but you acknowledge with Thanks, do not bind you to a faithful performance of this Trust, yet I hope your Care will be the more, when my Son shall marry with your Daugh∣ter, by which means the Empire will ever be Commanded by our Race, and both our Succes∣sors sway the Japan Scepter. Here Taicosama's Voice failing, he was necessitated to leave speaking; but soon after recovering his spirits a little, which Ongosschio observing, made this Reply: Ongosschio's Answer.Most Illustrious Prince, When Nobunanga was slain, I was onely King of the Pro∣vince Micaua: but since the Gods have set you on the Throne, you have added se∣ven Kingdoms more to my first; all the eight call'd by one Name of Quanto; for which
I can return Thanks to none but your Majesty: Besides many other Favors receiv'd, which (considering my own unworthiness) makes me with admiration gratefully to record your ex∣ceeding Bounty: The greatest of my Performances can never sufficiently make known how much I own my self oblig'd; nor can my greatest Services declare such suitable Resentments as I would readily upon a fair occasion shew. However, all my Abilities shall be laid out to yours and your Sons Service, in such manner, that had I a thousand Lives, I would freely and with much joy sacrifice them all for the sake of Taicosama and his Seed: And indeed have made it my sole Study, since your Majesties Sickness, to use all Care and Diligence for the promoting of Fideri, before you your self made your Will known to me. But since (most Mighty Prince) you have bestow'd two Favors more upon me, which so much exceed the former, that I am amaz'd thereat, I should be most un∣worthy, if I did not spend my Endeavors in the Service of Fideri, over whom you have chosen me as Guardian, not without having the Chief Command over all Japan for a time; and also to be his Father-in-law, by his Marrying of my Daughter. These Words Ongosschio utter'd with a passionate grief; and having ended his Speech, the young Prince Fideri and Ongosschio's Daughter came before Tai∣cosama lying on his Death-bed,Marriage concluded be∣tween Fideri and Ongosscio's Daughter. there to be joyn'd in Marriage, according to the Japan-Customs: And notwithstanding the Emperor lay striving with Death, yet their Wedding-Solemnities were perform'd after the ancient manner, onely narrow'd into the compass of one day. Taicosama takes the Oath of Allegiance of the Kings.After the Feast ended, Taicosama requir'd all the Kings and Vice-Roys to swear Allegiance to Fideri, and that they would establish him in the Throne in his fifteenth year; and mean while give due Obedience to Ongosschio, as being his Guardian till of Age. Ongosschio seal'd this Oath with his own Blood: And Taicosama, to oblige those which had sworn, gave them all, according to their several Qualities, many rich Presents: And this Bounty extended so far, that several of his old Servants got great Riches by it. Besides Ongosschio, he chose four Councellors of State, to assist him in the Government, and present∣ly after appointed Asonodangio, a Person highly esteem'd in his Favor, to be Pre∣sident of the Council; and in the mean while, to leave all Officers in their respective Places, and to break no manner of Laws or Orders establish'd in his Life-time. Then he advis'd the Council to be Faithful and Loyal amongst themselves, without which no Government could subsist long: And for the preservation of such a Unity and Peace,Makes Marriages to keep them all in peace. he made several Nuptials upon his Death-bed, joyning those of the Noblest Houses in Marriage together, taking several Kings Daughters, and bestowing them on other Kings Sons. Why he inlarg'd the Castle of Osacca.He enlarg'd also the Castle of Osacca, and built therein many Palaces, in which the chiefest Lords, with their Families, were to reside: For expediting which Work, thousands of Artificers were imploy'd. And to the end he might obtain his desire, he commanded, that his Death might be kept private for a time; which he did, because Japan upon the Decease of the Emperor being subject to many Civil Wars, the foremention'd Castle should be fully finish'd; and that the Kings which were far from their own Countrey, and without any Forces, might be kept there as in a Prison, till the Council were fully setled in their Authority. Would be honor'd as a God after his death.¶ BUt long before, Taicosama had taken great care to make himself Immor∣tal: For which purpose he in his Life-time built a Temple, reckon'd amongst the stateliest in Japan; in which he erected a Golden Image, represent∣ing
him to the life, which stood on Marble: His Body he order'd to be put in a Coffin, without burning, according to the common Custom. When he serv'd for a Day-laborer, he was call'd Toquixiro; after that, Faxiba; and at last, coming to the Imperial Throne, Taicosama: But at his Death he desir'd to be made a Came, which is a Supreme Deity, and would be styl'd Xin Fachiman, that is, The new God of War, by reason of his many valiant Exploits. This was his Request when he lay on a Flock-bed, cover'd with Silk Japan Quilts, mise∣rably tormented, and consum'd to nothing but Bones. Is carry'd into a higher Chamber.At length he desir'd to be carried (out of the hearing of any Noise) into an upper Chamber, in the Castle Fissima, that he might lye quietly, without any disturbance: So taking leave of all the Princes, and his Son Fideri, admonish∣ing him from that time forwards to call Ongosschio Father, and shew him due Reverence and Respect, being now deliver'd into his Custody, and he chosen as his Guardian: And also gave order, That few Nobles should come in his Chamber, and his Physicians should not stir from his Bed-side; and, if possi∣bly they could, to study for some Medicines to preserve his Life. Causes a great sorrow.Upon this parting, all the Courtiers began exceedingly to lament, seeing their Emperor, by whom every one expected to be preferr'd, carried away, never after to be seen alive. The Noise and Cry was so great within, that it was heard without the Castle, whose Gates were strongly guarded; but this coming to the Peoples Ears, gave supition that Taicosama was dead. The report of his death occasions great Uproars a∣mong the People.The Report of which spread up and down the Countrey like Wild-fire: Whereupon the Thieves sally'd out from their several Recesses, robbing and pillaging whom ever they met; and in some places the People began to Muti∣ny, not much unlike the Roman Tumults, whilst the Cardinals are about the Election of a new Pope. But the chief Insurrection here was in Osacca, Mea∣co, and Fissima, insomuch that the Great Council were too weak to quell the Re∣bellion. This Rumor of Taicosama's Death was credited the more by the Com∣mon People, because the Council had guarded the Fort of Fissima round about with new Soldiers, and Listed Forces in all Parts, wheresoever they could get them. How it is found not to be true.Ten days together this Belief continu'd: But the Emperor in this interim growing somewhat better, sent two of the Council to Osacca, with Orders to get the Castle finish'd, that was to be built there, with all expedition; and also gave to the several Princes design'd to go from Fissima thither, divers Bags of Rice, and great Sums of Money. About the Out-walls of this Castle,The Castle of Osacen a strange Fabrick. containing three Leagues in Circumference, a thousand Men wrought daily, all which were paid off every Night. Within stood above seventeen thousand Merchants and Artificers Houses, which were all pull'd down in three days time, and every one commanded, upon forfeiture of their Goods, to carry away their own Rubbish, and to clear the Ground: Which done, a new Field was alotted them, to build new Houses on, according to a Platform stak'd out by Surveyors; and whosoever was backward in Building, should lose his Ground; where none might raise a House under two Stories high. These Orders once publish'd, the Work went on day and night; insomuch that a new City and Castle appear'd at once. This Building stopp'd the Rumor that went of the Emperor's Death: for every one might well judge, that the Council would not take so great a Work upon them.
Taicosama is trouble for his Son Fidery.¶ MEan time, on the third and fourth of September, Taicosama seem'd more and more to recover; so that he spent his time in the firm Establishing of the Empire on his young Son Fidery: But on the fifth of Sep∣tember his Sickness began again to increase;Grows worse. whereupon all the Gates were strongly guarded, to the end the noise of the Emperor's Death might not be spread amongst the Common People. Thenceforward the Distemper in∣creas'd daily, till the fourteenth of the same Month, on which day he lay a considerable time without any appearance of Life, so that he was judg'd by all his Attendants to be dead: But at last fetching a deep Sigh, he came to himself;Is distracted. yet in few Hours after lost his Senses, so that he began to talk idly; but they might understand by his distracted Expressions, that the Establish∣ment of his Son Fidery did still trouble him, of whom he spoke till his last gasp,Dies. which was Anno 1508, the sixteenth of September, being sixty four years old, and after fifteen years Reign, having succeeded Nobunango, slain before Meaco by the Prince Aquechi. Aquechi aim'd first at the Crown.This Prince being encourag'd by his many Victories, aim'd at the Crown; but being treacherously slain by a Day-laborer, left the place for Taicosama, who knew exceeding well to take the advantage of such an opportunity. No∣bunanga had three Sons: The eldest, Voxequixama, lost with his Father, the Bat∣tel, and his Life: The second, Oxiacen Fongedonu, was distracted: And for the youngest Son, being but three years old, Taicosama took upon him the Autho∣rity, pretending to be his Guardian, and to rule the Empire in his behalf, and for his advantage, till he attain'd fitting years to Govern; but soon after, tasting the sweetness of Power and Sovereignty, he got so many Forces to∣gether, that Nobunanga's Son was forc'd to be contented with the Kingdom of Mino, and deliver up his just Title of the Imperial Crown to Taicosama. Taicosama's death is kept private.¶ ONgosschio and the Council kept the Emperor's Death very private, binding all those that knew of it by Oath not to divulge it; but a blabbing Courtier forgetting his Oath, accidentally told it, and as a Re∣ward for his Garrulity, was immediately Crucified. This his Punishment kept all others so in awe, that every one held his Tongue, and lock'd up the Se∣cret; yet not long after it was discover'd. Ongosschio and the Coun∣cil clash.In this small time the Council fell at variance with Ongosschio, whose De∣sign of getting the Empire they all observ'd: Whereupon they consulting together against him, decreed, That he should not be Guardian over Fidery any long∣er, but should return, and satisfie himself with his eight Kingdoms. The Councel∣lors seeing the Government lay too heavy upon them, chose four Eminent Princes more to their Assistance; and being thus strengthned, they seem'd not in the least to fear Ongosschio, who was not idle during their new Election. It is the Custom among the Japanners, that Noblemen upon several Acci∣dents change their Names;Japanners oftentimes change their Names. according to which, Ongosschio was call'd Jyavasu, and Giciasu: but putting off those three, he exchang'd the same for Dai∣fusama, which Name we will observe in his following Story. Taicosama is made a god.¶ ANd now, as if free from fear or danger, they were busie in Creating Taicosama a God. The Temple and his Image being ready for that purpose, his Corps was Interr'd in a Vault, with all Funeral Solemnity, and his Name chang'd into Xin Fachiman, as he had before design'd.
This Exchanging of Names, when Men are Registred amongst the number of the Deities, was formerly very common, both with the Greeks and Romans: For Romulus was call'd Quirinus; Juno, Matuta; Leucothoe, Albunea; Melicerta, Palaemon; Leda, Nemesis; Circe, Marica; Nersilia, Hora; Rhea, Mother of the Gods; Idaeda, Dindymeda; Philena, Pissinuntia; Cibele, Berecynthia. To Create Princes for Gods, for their Valiant Exploits and Noble Atchieve∣ments, took not its Original in Japan, but was a Custom above two thousand Years since; which the ancient Father Lactantius Firmianus witnesses,Lactant. de Fals. Reg. lib. 1. ca. 5. saying, Those whom the ignorant and foolish People call Gods, worshipping them, none can be so weak, as not to imagine them to have been Men. If any shall ask, Why are they believ'd to be Gods? Because they were the Greatest and Powerfullest Kings, and are for Commemo∣ration Consecrated, for a Reward of their Valiant Acts, or for their Bounties, or No∣ble Arts found and invented by them; and because belov'd by their Subjects. St. Augustine tells us, That the great Gods, which Cicero calls by peculiar Names,Aug. de Civic. Dei, l 8. c. 5. as Jupiter, Juno, Saturn, Vulcan, Vesta, and several others, which Varro endeavors to make Governors of the World, are all found to have been Men. Moreover, Diodorus Siculus says,Diod. Sic. Hst. lib. 1. That Julius Caesar was for his valiant At∣chievements in the Wars call'd a God: His Successor Augustus promoted him above the Stars. Of which,Manil. Astron. lib▪ 4. Marcus Manilius the Latin Poet saith thus: Himself makes Gods, and a fresh Numen treats: The Stars admire Hero's should take their Seats Amongst them; but not we, who understand Augustus, the Worlds Lord, did so command. Pliny in his Panegyricks sung before the Emperor Trajan,Plin. Panegyr. Consecrated Hea∣ven to his Predecessor Augustus: Nero made Claudius a God, on purpose to mock him: Titus made Vespasian a Deity, and Domitian, Titus; the one to be the Son of a God, as the other a Brother. Common amongst the Ancients to make Men Gods.It was common amongst the Greeks to Worship deceas'd Heroes for Immor∣tal Deities: As the Lacedemonians did Agamemnon, General of the Army that lay ten Years in Siege before Troy; and with him, his Brother Menelaus, the Spar∣tan King. The Arcadians reverenc'd Aristaeus, because he taught them first how decay'd Bee-hives might be supply'd with fresh Bees. Far more strange things did the Lybians, as Arsenius Monembasiensis witnesseth,Monemb. Apophthegon. who worship'd Psaphon for a God, that was a Man of mean Condition, but had a peculiar Art to teach Birds to speak, of which he learn'd some to say,The Birds make a God. Psaphon is a God; which when they could perfectly do, he let them fly one after another: These Words being often heard in the Air, were at last so taken notice of, that many People flock'd together from all parts of the Countrey to hear them. And to win a firm belief to his Design, he spar'd no labor, still teaching fresh Birds the like Words; which having taught them, he let fly. The Carthaginian General, Hanno, having had private Information thereof, endeavor'd by the same Art to be esteem'd as a God: But he,Aelian. Hist. li. 24. c. 30. as AElian wit∣nesses, bestow'd his Labor in vain; for having not taught them perfectly, they in stead of saying, Hanno is a God, when they were let loose, sung their own natural Notes. The Argives honor'd Perseus as a God, for his Noble Exploits. The Epidaneans worshipp'd Aesculapius, because he had found out many Mysteries for Curing
of Distempers; which not long after the Greeks follow'd, and at last also the Romans, which after built him a Temple without Rome. The Athenians ador'd the Soothsayer Amphilochus,Liv. lib. 45. whose Temple, as Livy re∣lates, though very ancient, yet was pleasant to behold, being surrounded by Fountains and Brooks of Fresh-water. Moreover most of the Athenian Kings are Registred among the number of the Gods. In like manner they chose Triptolemus for a Deity, because he first invented Plowing and Sowing; and Euricthonius, because he was swallow'd up by the Earth, with a Chariot and four Horses.Cicer. de Nat. de Or. li. 3. Erechteus they promoted with his Daughters above the Stars, be∣cause the Father obey'd the Oracle at Delphos, presaging the Victory to the Athenians against the Thracian Eumolpus, if the King did Sacrifice one of his Daughters; and the Virgin, because she died willingly for her Countreys sake in the Village Hyacinthus, was made a Goddess. Theseus also, having fought valiantly against Taurus, which was Minos the King of Creta's General, had a Temple erected in the middle of Athens, in which his Bones were worshipp'd. The same Honor was done to Codrus, because he went in Beggars Weeds into the Peloponnesian Army, there wrangling with the Soldiers, till he was kill'd, that by his Death the Conquest might fall on the Athenians side, as the Delphian Oracle had foretold.Curt. lib. 7. Therefore Augustus says, The Athenians worshipp'd Codrus as a God, because he went and sought his own Death for his Countreys good. The Thebans ador'd their King Liber, he being the first that press'd Wine out of the Grape: And besides Liber, his beautiful Ino, with her Son Melicerte, because they both leap'd from a high Rock into the Sea. This Custom is still held in use amongst the Japanners; they being taken there for Saints, who for the Honor of Amida, Xaca, or any other of the Japan Gods, hanging great Stones about their Necks, drown themselves, as we have before related. Furthermore, there were formerly few Kings, and chiefly over Egypt, Per∣sia, and India, which if they had us'd no Tyranny, were either in their Life-time, or at least after their Death, worshipp'd as Gods. Cleo, Shield-bearer to Alexander the Great, says thus in Curtius's History; The Persians worship not onely their Kings for Gods with great Zeal, but very circumspectly; for Hercules and Bacchus themselves were not install'd amongst the Gods, before they overcame the Malice of their Maligners. To Create Kings Gods,Colnitz Comp. Georg. lib. 2. cap. 13. is a present Custom amongst the Tartars. The fourth part of Tartary is Catay, or Kitay, in whose Metropolis Cambula, the Re∣sidence of the Great Cham, so great a Trade is driven in Silk, that scarce a day passes, wherein there come not above a thousand Waggons laden there∣with, to Market. Kitay is divided into seven Provinces, namely, Caimul, Engimul, Caindu, Tendac, Thebet, where they make use of Coral in stead of Money;Menly in for the women. Carazan, noted for its strange Custom, the Men lying-in forty days after their Women are deliver'd of a Child; and lastly, Tanguth, in which Territory Printing was in use above a thousand years ago. The Jesuit, Father John Gruberus, as Athanasius Kircher tells us in his China-Book, travell'd through Tanguth, where he was kindly receiv'd by the King, whom the Tartars call Deva,Images of the Tartars Han and Deva, by them worshipp'd as Gods. and commanded to Pourtray the Image of Deva, and also of Han, who was formerly King of Tanguth, and Father of fourteen Sons, and for his great Prudence and Justice was worshipp'd by the Inhabitants: Both these are to be seen standing on square Altars. Han is of a sallow Complexi∣on,
on, a Chesnut-colour'd Beard mix'd with gray Hairs, goggle Eyes, with a Furr'd Cap on his Head. But Deva appears with a young Visage, without a Beard, the Hair of his Head close shaven. Over both their Heads hang three burning Lamps. Strange Customs us'd by the Romans when they made Gods.The Romans made strange Preparations, when they gave the Heavens to their Deceas'd Emperors. They built a Funeral Pile, like a Tent, adorning it with Gold, Ivory, and costly Pictures; and being sharp on the top, they plac'd a Crane upon it, building it as it were with three Stories, which they stow'd full of rich Gums and sweet Perfumes. Under the lower Story stood a rich and stately Bed of Silk, with Coverings of Purple, embroyder'd with Gold; on which lay the Image of the Emperor. The Consuls, Knights, and other Persons of great Quality, attended the Bier to the Funeral Pyre, singing Eulogies, and shewing great Reverence to the same. The Tent was set round about on Fire, and the Smoke and Flame thereof made the Crane fly up directly into the Air, and thereby was judg'd to carry the Soul to the Gods, whilst the Flame purified the Body from all Corruption. This done, the Senate made a firm Law, That the Emperor from that time forward should be honor'd as a God. ¶ BUt to return from this Digression: Whilst the Council and Dai∣fusama were busie to make Taicosama, according to his earnest desire, a Xin Fachima, or God of War, they fell at variance amongst themselves. The Council strengthning their Party, by chusing four more to their assistance; and Daifusama travelling, as we said before, to Quanto. The Difference in short time grew to that height, that it could no ways be decided but by the Sword: Whereupon both Parties rais'd all the Force they could possible. The Council studied at last to stop all the Ways towards Meaco, and Listed many Soldiers in Isci and Mino, two Kingdoms bordering on Voari, so to get that Kingdom from Daifusama, having already subdu'd three strong Places in Mino.
Here stood also the invincible Castle Guifu, over which Ciunangodono, a young Man about two and twenty years of age, had the chief Command, in the Name of the Council. The Council intend to subdue the Kingdom of Voari.This Person had information, that Gibunoscio had ready at hand seven thou∣sand of Auxiliaries from the Council; with which united Force he intended to fall upon Voari, and there to face Daifusama's Army. Daifusama subdues the Fort Guifu.But while the Council assembled, whose Results upon Business and Debates before were so slow, losing much time, Daifusama being twenty thousand strong, drew towards Guifu. Before the Fort rais'd a high Mount; behind which lay the greatest strength, as a Reserve: Seven hundred drew close under Guifu, and attaqu'd the Garrison; Ciunangodono, full of resolution, sally'd out of the Fort against the Enemy; who after some opposition made them to re∣treat: a while after he fell unawares into the midst of the Rere-guard. The Besieged being too weak for so great a multitude, retreated back towards the Fort; but the Enemy pursuing them so close, that they press'd into the Fort with the Retreaters. Here he made great slaughter and havock amongst them, the Sword sparing none. In this extremity Ciunangadono got into the Tower of the Fort with some others,Ciunangadono taken Pri∣soner. where not being able to make any great resi∣stance, he was forc'd to yield. The Conqueror bringing the captive Governor to the Fort Vaori, left a strong Garrison in Guifu, and march'd with his victorious Army towards Gibu∣noscio. By the Way two thousand Soldiers fell among Daifusama's Party, and afterwards a thousand more, which were all so routed, that not one was left to carry tidings of the overthrow to Gibunoscio.Daifusama kills three thousand Men. The business thus standing, the King or Sassuma and Augustine Tzunocamindo∣no brought some of their Forces before Gibunoscio; which as soon as Daifusama discover'd, he rally'd his Men, and march'd down along the Shore of the River Jocatangauwa, to hinder their coming over. He discern'd on the other side of the River the new Auxiliary Forces by their Colours, under the Command of two stout Generals, wherefore he remain'd on the other side of the River, fear∣ing also that some Ambuscado's might be in the way, for he could not ima∣gine that Gibunoscio would else stand against his Army, being full as strong again. While the Forces on both sides lay in this posture, doing little, watching all opportunities of advantages, Faction having divided all Japan into Parties; first clashing in their Disputes as they were affected, and soon after taking up Arms one against another. In the Kingdom of Bungo, Quambioiendo gat information from the Army of Daifusama, by a Messenger sent from his Son Cainocamo by Water, of the Victory obtain'd; whereat encourag'd, he fell with eight thousand Men upon Francis∣co. This was the Son of the deceased King of Bungo, who had been long kept in hold by the command of Taicosama in Meaco, but was now released by the Council, and sent away with four thousand Men to Bungo, in hopes the Sub∣jects there might joyn with him as their lawful King against Quambioiendo; but it fell out quite contrary: for Francisco had scarce set Foot in the Countrey before he was overthrown and taken, not being able to stand against an Army stronger than his own: and within few days by this Rout, the whole King∣dom of Bungo assur'd to Daifusama. Thus the Grand Council met every where with oppositions.
Canzviedono overthrew Fingo.¶ THe Kingdom of Fingo being under two Lords, Canzviedono possess'd the one half, and Augustine Tzunocamindono the other; the first was of Daifusama's part, the second of the Council, who lay at that time along the River Jocatangauwa against Daifusama, when Canzviedono fell into his Countrey, and wasted all with Fire and Sword, and closely besieg'd the chiefest Fort Uto. Dissention among the Council.Furthermore there arose a great Dissention among the Lords of the nine Kingdoms, call'd by one Name Scimo; some declar'd themselves for the Grand Council, others for Daifusama, and many were willing to stand Neuters. The Princes Arimandono, and Omurandono, first joyn'd themselves with their Forces to the Grand Council; but being order'd to march with their Parties nearer to Meaco, they fell off and sided with Daifusama. The Grand Council had sent several Forces through the Empire to encoun∣ter with with those that joyn'd with the King's. The business growing thus to a Head, Forces Mustering from all Places, they were resolv'd to put it upon the Dye, and try their Fortune in the event of a Set-Battel,They joyn their Strength together. designing the Place of Rendezvouz for their best advantage to be in the Plains of the Kingdom of Mino; where not long after their whole Forces were drawn together, being about fourscore thousand Men, much too strong for Daifusama, who had scarce thirty thousand. The Council miserably perplexed the whole Business and Affair, by tedious Controversies and scrupling Delays, being thirty Days in making ready before they set upon the weak Enemy; who in that time made benefit of their tardi∣ness; for Daifusama sent his Son away with a part of the Army towards Con∣gueraso, and the rest he carry'd to Oari; to which out of Mino and other Coun∣treys he added so many as now made up fifty thousand Men, with which he not onely fac'd, but first engag'd the Council. The shameful and hor∣rible overthrow of the mighty Army of the Coun∣cil. The Battel was scarce begun, but Ciunangodono, Nephew to Taicosama's Wife, by whom came the Kingdom of Cicugen, deliver'd out of the Prison in Voari, where he was put when he quitted the Fort Guifu, revolted with his Regi∣ment, and went over to Daifusama: after him follow'd three other Regiments with their Princes, who contrary to the Design of the Council, took this op∣portunity to do Service to the other Party. Hereupon there arose aloud mur∣muring, and a voyce through the Army, crying Treachery, Treachery; and withal a sudden disorder, that the Officers neither could keep them in Rank nor File, deserting their Colours, and crowding, trod one another under foot. The Van-guard thus totally routed, fell into the Main Body, and disorder'd them also, Morindono, who had the left Wing, wheel'd off, not striking one Stroke, and fairly fled away; and the Rear seeing the Van routing the Main Body, fearing they would both fall foul upon them, threw down their Arms, each one shifting for themselves, so that in few hours the Field was clear: but though they ran thus early away, yet they escap'd not so, for most of them pe∣rish'd by their own Weapons, or the Enemies, who suddenly pour'd himself in amongst them. Amongst those which were taken by Daifusama, was Gibu∣noscio, and Augustine Tzunocamindono: the first acknowledg'd, that he had not the heart to rip himself up; the second refus'd self-murder, being a Christian; but most of the rest that fled, not knowing where to shelter themselves, were their own destroyers. Daifusama prosecutes his Victory.Daifusama made no small use of this Victory, the Field lying cover'd with
threescore thousand Bodies who oppos'd him. Being thus crown'd with suc∣cess, he march'd on, and first took all the strong Holds in Mino; and then en∣tring with his Army into the Kingdom of Omi, the fame of his Victory came before him to the Castle of Savoiama, belonging to Gibunoscio, whose Brother at that time was Governor there; who much startled at the sad News, and see∣ing no possibility to withstand his Forces, he bethought himself of a Delivery by a Happy Dispatch, for so the Japanners call Self-murder; on which having fully resolv'd, he first distributed what Treasure was in the Castle to the Sol∣diers, bidding them take that and shift for themselves: next killing his Wife and Children,Horrible Murder with∣in the Castle of Savoiama. he set fire on several places of the Castle, and at last was his own Executioner. Daifusama was afraid of Morindono.The Conqueror finding the Fortress all in flames, suppos'd it no fit place to make a halt, no longer than to look upon it, but that he might loose no time, march'd directly for Morindono, having brought off the left Wing from the last Battel intire; and having re-inforc'd himself with forty thousand more, fear∣ing this gather'd Cloud now impending, and ready to break upon his head, therefore he march'd speedily from thence to be further from the danger, since the fortune of War is doubtful; for the Conqueror was sufficiently wary, least any slur, or the least accident should happen or cast a blemish on so signal a Victory. His great strength.But that which troubled Daifusama more, was the strong Castle of Osacca, not to be parallel'd in all Japan; so that a great Army lying down before it might easily be moulder'd away, e're they could make the least advantage, to hope thereby to obtain the place; and what made it more difficult was, that Morindono kept there the Treasury of the whole Kingdom; there were in custo∣dy all the Hostages, even those that held with Daifusama, and Fideri himself, Taicosama 's Son.The strength of the Ca∣stle of Osacca. Moreover, there lay within the Castle so much Provision of Victuals, and Ammunition for War, that the Garrison might hold out a Siege of many years, without the least want or distress. The contrivance of Mo∣rindono.Yet notwithstanding all these advantages, Morindono possess'd with a strange Consternation, utterly deserted it without being once summon'd by the Enemy, and retir'd to his Palace near Osacca, from whence at least he might make an escape to his own Kingdom, and set himself at more distance from his Enemies, of whose mercy there was little hope. Daifusama gets the Ca∣stle of Osacca.¶ IT seem'd almost incredible to Daifusama, that he should become Master so easily of such an impregnable Hold, which had it stood out, had stopt the whole Course of his Victory, that lingering there, had probably ruin'd him and his whole design; so with this, whatever could be desir'd fell into his hands, all places striving who should first submit to the Conqueror, who durst not so much as offer, or once think of opposing him, now ready to as∣cend the Imperial Throne. Fideri, the onely Block to stop the ambitious As∣pirer in his Enterprise, that Rub remov'd by his Death, there was no other obstacle to hinder him from being sole Emperor of Japan:And therewith all Japan. Such was his success, that he sleighted Cangueraso, as if no body, who was yet in Arms, and raising Forces in behalf of the Grand Council, on the utmost borders of Quanto, and also the King of Sassuma,The dexterity of the King of Sassuma. of whose Valor he had sufficient proofs in the last Battel; for being quite out of hope of Rallying his Forces, to give the Enemy another Charge, made his way onely with sixty Men through the main Body of the Army, with which, hasting to Osacca, where with an addition of
five hundred Men, he took Shipping, Sailing to Sassuma, a hundred and fifty Leagues from Osacca, where he setled himself, daily Mustering up new Forces, to be able for a second Ingagement, in behalf of the Parliament. Daifusama spares Morin∣dono.But Daifusama sending for the Cowardly Morindono, who appearing in a des∣picable manner, looking upon him as no dangerous Foe, gave him his Life, but took from him, for his kindness, nine Kingdoms, and seven inestimable Silver Mines, so that besides his eight Kingdoms of Quanto, and nine from Morindono, he subdu'd all those Territories which Taicosama formerly pos∣sessed. And although Ciunangodono, in the late Battel happening between the Council and Daifusama, revolting, went over to him; by that means throwing so great a Victory into his Lap, yet he was so far from making any kind return, or ac∣knowledging in the least so high a benefit, that on the contrary, he dispossess'd him of the Kingdom of Cicugen, and secur'd him in the Cloyster Coja, being a Pri∣son for Prime Persons, and kept by the great Master of the Bonzi, where Quaba∣condono three years before did Execution upon himself; where also he and many other Persons of Quality suffer'd in like manner. The Castle of Ʋto defen∣ded it self stoutly.¶ WHile Daifusama thus domineer'd every where, nevertheless, Canzviedono fell into a part of Fingo, belonging to Tzunocamindono, and there stor∣med the Castle of Uto, yet spent all their labor in vain, for the Garrison behav'd themselves exceeding manfully; their Assaults were repuls'd with great Losses, and their Sallyings forth, daily weaken'd the Besiegers, so that they began to loose their courage: Canzviedono endeavor'd by all ways and means to make known to them, that the Grand Councils Army was overthrown, and the Ca∣stle of Osacca taken; that Daifusama Triumph'd victoriously every where, and that their Lord Augustin Tzunocamindono, for whom they fought couragiously, was Executed. But the Garrison in the beginning of the Siege, had sworn to one another, upon pain of Death, not to receive any Letters or Messages from the Enemies; wherefore being mutually agreed, they cast all the Arrows which had written Papers wrapt about them instantly, without reading, into the fire. The Jesuites were sought to for the delivery up of Ʋto.Canzviedono was amaz'd at this stubbornness, who could not remove his Seige with Honor nor Advantage, and his Power and Policy being spent in vain, he then at length apply'd himself to the Jesuites, (as the Jesuite Valentine Carvaglio, writing from Nangesaque, the five and twentieth of February, in the Year sixteen hundred and one, to Claudius Aquaviea, Chief Governor of the Society of Jesuites makes mention) to whom he sent Letters to Nangesaque to this purpose: Since it was known to all the world, the downfal of Daifusama's oppressors, and Tzu∣nocamindono's Death, which could no ways be made known to the Besieg'd in Uto; by which, their ignorance of that Affair they held out so obstinately, as if their Councils Cause were not ruin'd, and their King slain: Therefore my desire is, that you send a Jesuite to me at my Leaguer, that he may unfold the present State of things to the Garrison, in which are five Jesuites: If they were obedient herein, they should no way find him unthankful for it; else they were to expect Daifusama's displeasure. They are cast down at this demand. But the Jesuites were amaz'd at this Command, and chiefly, that there should be a change of Government (as Japan was many times subject to such alterati∣ons of State) therefore they besought with gentle Intreaties to put it off, saying, They were Spiritual Persons, and taught the way to Heaven, and transitory Affairs was
not their concern, especially the business of War; and if they should so do, they might seem rather like mad men, than Councellors. Canzviedono did no ways accept of this their excuse, but threatned to put the five Fathers in Uto to death; and furthermore, to banish all the rest out of Ja∣pan, as being Daifusama's Enemies: So at last the Garrison receiv'd all infor∣mation concerning the Transactions between the Emperor and Council; by which they judg'd it better to make an agreement, being not able to stand out alone; so that Canzviedono, after being sufficiently weary'd out, obtain'd his desire. Ʋto yields. As also the Castle of Gi∣atusciro.The Besieg'd delivering up the Castle Uto into his possession; and not long after, according to that example, also the Castle Giatusciro, of which Mimazaca, a grand Favorite of Tzunocamindono's, had the chief Command, who having had certain intelligence, that his King being slain by Daifusama, for whom should he then fight for any longer? All hopes of assistance on their part being utter∣ly lost; What then could he effect alone? none being to be found that were in Arms against Daifusama, but the King of Sassuma, who was a hundred and fifty Leagues distance from Giatusciro: For all which reasons, he thought it best to deliver up the Castle to Canzviedono, upon good and honorable Articles; and coming to an Agreement, had liberty to go with fifteen hundred Men by Ship∣ping to the Haven of Sassuma;And Gianava. after that, Canzviedono subdu'd the Castle of Gia∣nava, by which he got the whole Kingdom of Fingo into his possession, whereas he had onely half of it before. Daifusama becomes Ma∣ster of Japan.¶ DAifusama being thus become Master of all Japan, he Tyraniz'd not af∣ter his obtain'd Victory,Rages not after the cu∣stom of the Japanners. as other Emperors had done before him, which was, to defile their Conquests with cruel Massacres, without sparing any that had formerly obstructed them, and with razing of Towns, Castles, and Cities, of which sufficient testimonies are to be seen to this day, by many places lying bury'd in their own Ruines, Houses, Churches and other stately Edifices hid in Ashes, being destroy'd by raging War. But Daifusama took a more gen∣tler course with his Captive Enemies, which he took in the Field-battel fought between him and his Parliament,He put three eminent per∣sons to shameful death. or grand Councel: Onely upon three Emi∣nent Persons he took Sanguinary satisfaction; for though he spar'd others, yet he Condemn'd Gibunoscio King of Onu, to die an Ignoble Death, for leading the Grand Councels Army against him; Tzunocamindono, King of half Fingo; and Ancocugio, whom Morindono had us'd for his Councellor; being taken Pri∣soners by Cainecamio, were first entertain'd according to their Dignity, but soon after put into the Custody of a cruel Commander, and at last close Prisoners in Osacca, where they receiv'd their Sentence of Death, being set upon lean Mules, and led through the Streets of Osacca in great derision; then they were carry'd in Carts to Meaco, crouded all about with great multitudes of people, some seeming to pitty the disasters of such Noble persons, whilest others laugh'd and mock'd at their misfortunes.Sentence of death was ex∣ecuted against the Kings Gi∣bunosciro, Tzunocamindono, and Ancacugio. Gibunosci riding in the first Cart, was follow'd by Ancocugio, and on the hindermost sate Tzunocamindono; before each went a Trumpeter, who cry'd aloud, that these Traytors to their Countrey were Condemned to shameful Deaths, because they were found to fall off from the King of Tensa. The stout courage of Tzu∣nocamindono.Tzunocamindono seem'd not the least dismay'd or daunted, but bore up with a Manly Courage under all these Contumelies; but the other two, testifying their Innocency, complain'd against such cursed Authority: Whilst they drew
near to the place of Execution, several Bonzies coming from a place not far from thence, not onely admonish'd them, but us'd many ridiculous Ceremo∣nies, to purifie them from all their Crimes, that so they might appear in the other Life before Amida, without polluted or unclean Souls; which comforted the Condemned not a little, to be assur'd of an Immortal Life in this Mortal. But Tzunocamindono rejected the Bonzi, and acknowledged himself to be a Chri∣stian, who abhorr'd such abomination. Being upon the Scaffold, the Supreme Bonzies came to them, who is not us'd to go forth, but when great Persons are to suffer, attended with a considerable Train of Japan Priests, and Xaca's Consecrated Book in his hand. After much juggling, when Gibunoscio and Ancocugio were just ready to die, he offer'd them the Book to kiss; but Tzunocamindono charg'd the Supreme Bon∣zi of Blasphemy, declaring his Christianity again; and pull'd out from his Girdle, a small Picture of Jesus, and the Virgin Mary, which the Portugal Queen Catherine, Sister to the Emperor Charles the Fifth, had presented him by the Jesuites. He kissed a Portraiture with the Image of Jesus, be∣headed after the two others, and bury'd by the Jesuites. This Picture he took in both his hands, and looking stedfastly upon it, said his Prayers, then offer'd his Neck to the Executioners Sword, who struck three times before he could cut it off: In the same manner the two others were Exe∣cuted, whose Corps were presently burnt; but Tzumocamindono was in Mecao, by the Jesuites, wrapp'd in a long Shroud, Burying him with all the Ceremonies us'd by the present Romish Church. The horrible Murder of Trunocamindono's Son.Leaving one Son of twelve years old behind, to whom Morindono, to∣gether with his Officers, gave free leave to dwell close by Firoscima; but a few days after the Beheading of Tzunocamindono, he sent for the Child to Osacca, where he then was: The Halberdiers that fetch'd him, knowing of Morindono's bloody intent, discover'd it; Nevertheless, though the Child was terrifi'd at that sentence of Death, he desir'd not to live, having nothing in the world to trust to, since his Father was put to so shameful a death: He acknowledg'd a Christ, by whose Death, a door was open'd to Heaven for the Dead; there he should find his Father, when he put off this Body: No sooner came the Youth within Osacca, but Morindono caus'd him secretly to be Beheaded, and sent the Head to Daifusama, to obtain his favor; but he abhorr'd the deed, and would have taken vengeance on him for it, had not Morindono been secretly in∣form'd of his displeasure on which he reported, that the Youth had first ripp'd up his own Belly for grief of his Fathers death. Daifusama spared many of his enemies, as also their Allies and Kindred.Besides these three, since Daifusama's Conquest, he scarce put any to death in cool blood, but went on in a milde way, that thereby he might draw the minds of the people to him, and settle the Empire upon his Son, according to the Laws of the Countrey; Tzunocamindono's Wife and Children should have suf∣fer'd death; as also many other Widows and Orphans, whose Fathers and ally∣ance were in Arms against him, but he spar'd them all. The courage of Acascica∣mon.¶ NOne more disorder'd, and did more mischief to Diafusama's Army, than Acasicamon, and Sassuma; for Acasicamon retreated not, but rush'd into the midst of them, and made great execution, judging it better to die by the Sword of the Enemy, than to lay violent hands on himself: Where, whilest he was hemm'd in, and no hope of escape,A wonderful accident in the stress of the fight. he broke into a Regiment led by Cainocami, who knew him by his Behavior and Arms, and crying aloud, said,
Save him,The Speech of Cainocami. Souldiers, save him, for be shall be my Prisoner; upon this Command, they stood all still, and he going towards Acasicamon, embrac'd him about the neck, and shedding many Tears, said, My dear Friend, how hard have the Fates been to me to make us Enemies? that we should thus, in a lamentable dissention, which shakes the very Foundations of the Empire, Fight one against another, because you led the Parliament Forces, and I the Kings; you have gain'd honor enough, though you are defeated by ma∣king your way thus through the Conquering Army. Which said, Acasicami, so soon as he was able to speak, reply'd thus, If you are my true Friend, as I believe, now or never shew it, and presently dispatch me with that Sword, with which you would spare my Life. But Cai∣nocami on the contrary, set him upon his own Horse, and assur'd him his life. Daifusama distributes Kingdoms, and rewards to those that fought for him.¶ FUrthermore, Daifusama thought it convenient to distribute his Bounty and Rewards on those that had fought for him against the Council, gi∣ving some great Kingdoms for lesser ones; others had larger or smaller Territories; so that all Japan was in confusion: Some remov'd from their Houses, Cities, and Towns, with their new King and Government, the Inha∣bitants going from their antient Habitations to other Countreys, appointed by Daifusama. Nangoioca receiv'd for the small Fort of Tango, the Kingdom of Bungo: Facuscimadono, the Castle Firoscima, and the Countries thereunto be∣longing: To some Christians of Noble Extract, Daifusama gave several Livings in the Kingdom of Mimaraca, because they had bore Arms, and fought vali∣antly for him: He releas'd also the five Jesuits without Ransom, which were put in Prison by Canzviedono, when the Castle of Uto was rendred up, giving them free Conduct to Nangesaque: To Cainocamio, the Son of Quamboiendono he be∣stow'd the Kingdom of Cicugen. Lives in quiet.Since that time, Daifusama had rest and quiet, and rul'd Japan with Imperial Command, as Guardian of Fideri: He remov'd the Court from Fissima to Su∣runga, and chang'd his Name of Daifusama,He chang'd the name of it again. into Goyssio Samma: Anno sixteen hundred and eleven, he was visited by several Ambassadors from Europe and other places. The Portuguese and Castilians behav'd themselves so ill, that Goyssio Samma seem'd to be much displeas'd thereat;Spex and Segerssoon were very acceptable to Daifusa∣ma. Jacob Spex, and Peter Segerssoon ha∣ving far more free Audience from the Emperor, and their Presents being kind∣ly accepted. A Copy of their Embassy written in Japan Language, and left with the Chancellor Cosequidonne, so that they might have a quicker dispatch at their return from Jedo; being instructed, that it would be fitting to Comple∣ment the Emperors Son there, which the Castilian Ambassadors had done be∣fore them, but committed a great error therein, by visiting the same before their Father. Their journey to Jedo.On the eighteenth of August, in the foremention'd year, they made their Journey thither: Cosequidonne prepar'd all things necessary for them in that Ex∣pedition: But the Netherland Ambassadors going by day-break out of Surin∣ga, came by noon to the Village Jesare, where they lay that night, in which happen'd such a dreadful Tempest of Thunder, Lightning, and Showres of Rain, as if the world had been at an end, which constrain'd them to stay till the next day. About thirty years after, the Ambassadors, Frisius and Brookhurst lodg'd there as their Landlord told them: In the morning they departed from thence in foul Weather, and came to Missina, and thence through Fovisauwa and Toska into Jedo. eir strange adventure do.Here, by means of one William Adams, they made their coming known to Sa∣dadonne, President in the Council of the Emperors Son, and excus'd themselves,
that for two years (when they had visited the Emperor at Suringa) they had neg∣lected to pay their respects to the young Emperor; which was,The Emperors Son is de∣sirous to see the Nether∣landers. partly because they knew not the way, and partly, for their speedy return, upon which the safety of the Netherlanders Ships depend. At which, Sadadonne seeming to be sa∣tisfi'd, said, That the Emperors Son had Information, that there were Ships come out of remote Countries, into the Haven of Firando, two years since, and he desir'd to see those People, whose Warlike Deeds, and rational Managements of Affairs, were known all over India; therefore they need not any way doubt, but they should be welcome: Besides, that they might loose no time, he prepar'd all things, to get them Audience before the Emperors Son. Moreover, proffer'd to do them all the kindness the Hol∣landers themselves would require. The next day the Ambassadors repair'd to the House of Sadadonne, and pre∣sented him with five Ells of Crimson Cloth, two Pieces of Black Lute-String, one Piece of Black Damask, five Pieces of White Sattins, three Glass Flasks, one Carbine, and a Powder-Horn. These Presents were thankfully accepted, though with intimation, that it was against their Custom; but being the first time that he had seen the Netherlander Rarities brought so unmeasurable a distance thither, not without great labor and charge, they should be accepted: Further he acquainted them, That last night he had made known their coming to the Emperors Son, who seem'd to be well-pleas'd thereat. The discourse between Spex and Sadadonne.This their Discourse together continu'd above half an hour, Sadadonne en∣quiring of them concerning the State, and the Affairs of the Netherlands, and wondred, that a Countrey of so small a compass should manage such a War against the greatest Prince in Europe, the King of Spain, and compelling him to an Agreement, settle Plantations in many places through the world: During this their Discourse, he Treated the Ambassadors with such Dainties, as the Coun∣trey would afford and though he was very feeble with age, and troubled with the Gout, and at that time scarce able to go, yet he led Spex and Segerssoon out at the Gate, promising them in the after-noon to conduct and procure them an Audience in the Castle; which Sadadonne perform'd,The Netherland Ambas∣sadors appear before the Emperors Son at Jedo. for at two of the Clock they came before the young Emperor, at whose Feet they laid two Pieces of fine Stammel, one Piece of Carsey of the same colour, fifteen Ells of Green Flower'd Grogarin, nine Ells of Crimson, Flower'd Black, one Piece of Damask, one Piece of Cloth of Gold Tissue, five Norenburg Carpets, one Piece of Sattin Flow∣er'd with Roses, one Piece of Lutestring, three Elephants Teeth, an hundred Bars of Steel, one Musket, two Carbines and Powder-Horns, five less Flasks, and some Pounds of shot. The Emperors Son thank'd the Ambassadors for their Presents, and they were joyful that he had accepted of them, whose favor to obtain, the Hollanders had endeavor'd long before; then bowing his head, the Emperor retiring, or∣der'd Spex and Segerssoon to be conducted through the Palace, without the Ca∣stle, by Sadadonnes Gentlemen, with a Command for Horses, Letters of Con∣duct, Souldiers, two Japan Coats, and several other Presents; both to Spex and Segerssoon, and his Protection wheresoever they went. Were very lovingly en∣tertain'd.Afterwards, the Ambassadors were invited to a Dinner by the Governors Brother of Firando: and while they were resolving to take Shipping to Sail to the Haven of Wormgouw, Sadadonne prepar'd a Galley for them, and a Bark for their Goods: Never any Europeans whatsoever were receiv'd more kind∣lier at Jedo than they; for the Spanish Ambassador, though he had a little before
made his entrance there with great Pomp, yet waited many days before they were admitted to Audience, where also they met but with a cold Entertainment. The five and twentieth of August, Spex and Segerssoon set Sail in the prepar'd Vessels, and arrived in the Evening in the Haven of Wormgouw, where they lodg'd in William Adam's House, and found a Ship, which Sailing along the wea∣ther Shore, had narrowly escap'd a great Storm, which else would certainly have been cast away on the North of Japan. The Pomp of the Spani∣ards in Mexico, to enter∣tain the Japanners.This Vessel brought the Japanners back, which some time before Sail'd over with Roderigo de Riduere to New-Spain, where they were so sumptuously enter∣tain'd, that it cost the King of Spain above fifty thousand pieces of Eight, bear∣ing all their Expences from Acapulco to Mexico, where they were receiv'd in great State. How New Guinee was discover'd.Two Netherlanders Sailing in the Ship, inform'd them, that the Castilians from Manilla, had discover'd on the unknown South Countrey New-Guinee, lying under a temperate Climate, and Inhabited by civil people, full of all sorts of Provision, besides Nutmegs and Gold; two of the Inhabitants being stoln from the Coun∣trey, were carry'd to Madrid, so to learn the Language, and give them further information concerning the discover'd Coast of New-Guinee, which seem'd to be of great importance to the Castilians, who promis'd themselves great advan∣tages, in sending Ships from the Manilla's thither, wherefore they left several men ashore to make further inspection into the Countrey, and also in time to People it with their own Nation. The Captain of the Ship sent three of his Officers to Complement Spex and Segerssoon, and soon after several Messengers to invite them to a Collation; but the Netherland Ambassadors, judging that he ought first to give them a Visit, they excus'd themselves. The request of the Casti∣lians to the Emperor of Ja∣pan.They also were informed, that the Spaniards were very earnest with Goyssio Samma Emperor of Japan, to obtain leave for to sound the Japan Havens, be∣cause many Ships richly Freighted, Sailing over from Manilla to New-Spain, were oft-times loft at Sea, suffering by stress of Weather, which if they might Harbor upon the Coast of Japan, they would escape the like danger; but they durst not adventure, because they knew not the depth and sounding of the Ha∣vens. Lastly, they requested, that they might build Ships in Japan, because Wood and other Materials, nor experienc'd Ship-Wrights were so easily to be had in Manilla and New-Spain, as there. The description of the habit of a common Citizen of Japan.The Netherland Ambassadors having notice thereof, went on their way through Oiso and Justivarra, and Surunga; about noon, on the nine and twenti∣eth of August, they took Horse there amongst a great throng of People. Their Habits, as of all other common Citizens very costly: Their Crowns shaven after the manner of Friers, their Hair ty'd up behind in rowls, with Fillets; when they are Marry'd, one Lock hangs down by the Roll. Their Coats are ty'd with Girdles, broad as our Belts, of several Colours, in which, below the left Breast sticks a Cutting-Knife, by them call'd Siakkin; a two-handed Sword also sticks in their Girdle, thrust under the left Arm, the Handle co∣ver'd over with a Shaggerine or Fish-skin: Their Coats are made with very broad Borders, and Embroyder'd with variety of colour'd Flowers, all walk∣ing with Canes in their hands; in stead of Shooes they wear Clogs, not unlike the Carmelites in Brabant, made fast with a string about the great Toe, by which they draw it along when they lift up their Foot.
But Spex and Segerszoon arriving at Mexico,The Netherlands return again to Surunga. made their return from Jedo known by William Adams to Cosequidonne, who also immediately sent one of his Gentlemen to welcome them thither, and to enquire concerning what success they had in their Journey; whereupon they made Answer, They could never be thankful enough to Cosequidonne, for his kindness shew'd them, he being the means, that all things in Jedo happen'd according to their desire. Furthermore, the Japan Emperor, as William Adams understood from Cosequidonne, had enquir'd about the Lading, which the Netherland Ship had brought to Firando; upon which, the Ambassadors rested not, but instantly drew an Inventory of all her Lading, which they sent by William Adams to Cosequidonne, with a request, that he would speedily dispatch the desir'd Letters of License, that the Netherland Ships might Trade without any molestation in Japan: In answer whereof he brought them word, That the Letters of License lay ready, onely they wanted the Imperial Signet, which should be ready on that day, or at farthest, on the morrow. Where whilst they staid waiting for it, they saw in their Lodging one Jacob a Japan Christian; being Captain of Junck, who formerly had been kept by Wittert, Governor of the Manillies, and complain'd much of the injury done him by the Netherland Mariners, who gave out, That they prejudic'd onely the Ca∣stilians and Portuguese, but indeed, they made a prey also of the Japanners, and said, If this misdemeanor should come to the Emperors Ear, it would be bad for the Netherlanders. Cosequidonne in the mean time, towards the Evening, sent twenty Japan Shifts to Spex, and ten for Segerszoon, to demonstrate (as the Messenger express'd it) his affection towards them. The last of August, Williams Adams receiv'd the two re∣quested Letters of License, with the Imperial Seal; instantly, the Ambassadors caus'd them to be Translated out of the Japan Tongue, into Low-Dutch, and found them word for word, which were to this effect: The contents of the Ja∣pan Letters of License.The Holland Ships that Sail'd to Japan, be they Anchor'd in what Haven soever,
none under our Command shall any way disturb them, but on the contrary, shew them respect and afford them all manner of assistance. The Ambassadors were much troubled at the expressions in this License, be∣ing not full enough to their desire and intentions, wanting the chief and grand concern, viz. That they should not be molested with Searchers and Cu∣stomers, in the Delivery, Lading, and Sale of their Goods, which were vexatious to all Merchants whatsoever, especially as they found, to the Netherlanders, the chiefest being Saphidonne,Saphidonne suppress'd the Netherland trade in Japan. who exacted Fees, Duties, and Customs more than any, being very greedy and troublesome, of which, were the Emperor inform∣ed, would cost him his life, though his Sister was one of the Emperors Con∣cubines. The condition of the Ne∣therlanders with their Let∣ters of License.But it was very difficult to lay the Plot for the destruction of this Saphidonne, who was so eminent a Person; and certain they were, that the Emperor would enquire why the Netherland Ambassadors should insist so particularly upon him, that by vertue of the Letters of License, their Goods should not be stop'd nor seiz'd by his Majesties Officers of the Custom; also they would run no less danger, to request the amending or augmenting of a Letter Grant∣ed by the Emperors Favor. Yet at last they concluded to venture on one of them, whereupon, on the first of September, Spex and William Adams made their Address to Cosequidonne; Spex thanking him for the speedy procuring the Letters of License; who ask'd, if there were not enough inserted in; they answer'd, Yes: onely there wanted the Emperors permission, for the Netherland Ship to deliver and sell the Goods without the disturbance of Waiters and overseers; whereupon, Cosequidonne assur'd them, that none should in the least molest them; wherefore he had sent a Letter to Saphidonne, commanding him not to hinder the Netherlanders in the delivery or sale of their Merchandize, for he had receiv'd certain informati∣on, that Saphidonne, according to his own pleasure, and not in such a manner as he ought, seiz'd their Goods, and hinder'd their sale, of which they had never complain'd, but for great reason. Spex requested Cosequidonnes own Hand-wri∣ting to make use of, if they should hereafter suffer more injury by Saphidonne; and also, if he found the business of so weighty a concern, to procure from the Emperor his Imperial License, to deliver and sell, without molestation; but Cosequidonne judg'd it to be needless, so long as William Adams staid, in Surunga, to whom he might write over concerning any miscarriage, against which there should speedy order be taken. The cunning management of Spex with Cosoquidonne.But Spex fear'd much, considering that time run away e're any Order could come from the Court, for if they could, not be fully Laden in nine Moneths time to come away, that then they were necessitated to lie five Moneths at Pa∣nama, not without great damage to them. Cosequidonne apprehending the weight of the matter, then promis'd, that if the Ambassadors Journey reequir'd speed, William Adams might stay, to procure of the Emperor the desir'd License of free-delivering and Trading: Spex thank'd Cosequidonne for that singular courtesie, and presently caus'd a Petition to be drawn in the Japan Tongue, to that purpose; which the same Evening, William Adams deliver'd into Cosequidonne's hands, who immediately reading it over, order'd William Adams to wait in the Morning at the Court, and there deliver the Petition himself, that his Im∣perial Majesty would be pleas'd out of his special favor to grant them their request.
The Netherlanders ob∣tain'd of the Emperor their request, to the admiration of every one.It happen'd just the very next day, that Sicusabrondonne, who especially fa∣vor'd the Netherlanders, was present at the business: These two persons talking together, went and found Goysio Samma the Emperor, and finding him in a good humor, deliver'd the Petition; which being Granted, Sign'd, and Seal'd, William Adams presently convey'd it to the Ambassadors, with a com∣mand from the Emperor, That the Netherland Ambassadors should go on their Journey without molestation, and next year bring new Merchandize thither. Sicusabrondonne, and Cosequidonne, sent each of them a Nobleman for Spex and Segerszoon, about this Express, which never any Nation before could presume to, commanding them not to stay longer, but come the following year with new Netherland Commodities, else they would perhaps incur the Emperos dis∣pleasure. They were maintain'd freely for their Journey.William Adams was order'd to conduct them down, and to take care for all things in behalf of the Emperor, necessary for their Journey. The Ambassa∣dors humbly thanking them for their so great Bounties, assur'd them, that they would never be found ungrateful, or to fall into the Emperors just dis∣pleasure: After, having taken their leave, they took Horse, and rode through Cacingam, and by midnight arriv'd at Arei, defended by a Castle. The City Astanamia.¶ TWo Miles further lieth Astanamia, a fair City, whose Inhabitants drive a great Trade in Timber; all the Streets and Lanes are full of great Wood-yards, their Houses built all behind; by the way lives a Broker, who deals for the Merchants. The journey of the Am∣bassadors.¶ BEtween Mia and Quano, the Sea makes a Bay into the Land, seven Leagues broad, over which Sailing, after having Landed, they refresh'd at Quan∣to, a handsome City, also fortifi'd with a strong Castle. In the Evening they ar∣rived within Cammiammi; by Day-break, mounting on Horseback, and going on their Journey, they were surpriz'd about Noon near Znitzamma by a Thun∣der Shore, but not stopping, though the Weather continu'd foul, in the Evening they came to Vitzibe. In Oets the Ambassadors parted, for Spex and William Adams travel'd to Meaco, to deliver Cosequidonne's Letters to Itacura Fovimendonne, and once more to present him with four Ells of Crimson Cloth, two Pieces of black Lute-string, one Piece of Strip'd Silk, and some Pounds of Lead: After many Apologies, he took the Presents, rather, because the Netherland Ambassadors otherwise might doubt of his affection to them, than that ever it was accustom'd so to be. Af∣ter their departure, Spex took some Wax-Work along with him, which in his Journey thither he had bespoke; and went on to Fissima, where Segerszoon and John Cousins were arrived with their Goods: Here meeting one another,They meet again. they went all aboard of a Bark, in which they Sail'd to the Suburbs of Osacca, where the Wind blew so hard against them, that they were forc'd to Land, not being able to get further. They travel to Saccai to observe trade.In the mean time they went on to the City Saccai, famous for Trade, being three Leagues from Osacca, to enquire out the manner of their Dealing, and very happily met there with Melchior Zantfoort, who suffering Shipwrack on that Coast, staid in this City, where he had narrowly observ'd all their Cu∣stoms, of which he inform'd Spex, who gave them such satisfaction, that they no way repented their Journey thither.
They come to Firando.Thence from Cussima, the Suburb of Osacca, they went on their way, and on the nineteenth of September, Anno sixteen hundred and eleven, they came to an Anchor before Firando, where they were honorably entertain'd by old Foyesam∣ma, and the young Governor Donnesumi; and after the reading of the Letters deliver'd, written by the Council in Surunga and Jedo, and especially the Empe∣rors, the two Waiters were immediately Commanded from the Netherland Ship, call'd The Brake, then lying in the Harbor. The Governor of the Countrey of Firando is the cause of the Trade of the Netherlanders in Japan.Foyesamma obliged the East-india Company exceedingly in this Embassy; for he not onely provided Spex and Segerzoon with a Gentleman to recommend them at Court, but also, Anno 1603. fitted out a Jonk at his own Cost and Charge, to carry Quackernaek and Melchior Zantroort (who lost their Ships on the Japan Shore) to Patane, there to declare the benefit of the Japan Trade to the Netherlanders. This Voyage cost Foyesamma about two thousand Pieces of Eight. Afterwards, Anno 1609. when the first Ships, being the Red Lyon with Ar∣rows, and the Griffin, that came from Batavia to Firando, he furnish'd the chief Merchants, which sought for a free Trade by the Emperor with a Galley of fifty six Oars, which was out two Moneths, and return'd so sadly Weather-beaten, that she was soon after broke up. Mean while the foremention'd Ships left great store of Pepper at Firando, which Foyesamma bought in at the dearest Rate, because Saphedonne, the Emperor's Governor in Nangesaque, should not ingross the Pepper-Trade to himself; so that no other Merchant durst proffer any Price for it: but Foyesamma losing above twelve hundred Pound thereof, the Charges and Damage which he suf∣fer'd for, or by the East-India Company was very great: Neither were his Losses repair'd, though he receiv'd the year before out of ten Chinese Jonks, above four thousand weight of Pepper in Presents. Presents made to the Governor of Firando.The Netherland Council at Firando taking this into consideration, that Foye∣samma might not be discourag'd for his great Favors, and his noble Underta∣king, they thought it fit to present him with some rich Presents, though their small Cargo could scarce allow of the same; yet they were as bountiful as they could, and gave the old and young Governor and his Unckle such Gifts, that they were all kindly received. And this was the second Embassy which the Netherlanders sent to Daifusama the Emperor of Japan. Why Daifusama promo∣ted the Foreign Trade.Daifusama, first call'd Ongoschio, and at last Goyssio Samma, was exceedingly pleas'd with such foreign Courtesies. He also endeavor'd by means of the Outlandish Trade to enrich and employ his Subjects, and therefore all Stran∣gers were protected by the Emperor, and secur'd from all Affronts; yet not long after a bloody Persecution of the Christians began in his Empire. Persecutes the Roman Christians.The Jesuit Cornelius Hazart mentions several Martyrs, as Johannes Gorosaimon, Simon Giffioje, Magdalena, Agnes, Melchior Bujandono, Damianus, Leo Xiquigemo, Mi∣chael and Martha, besides several Children, which were either beheaded, burnt, or Nail'd on Crosses. Moreover, as to what is related concerning Fayaxinda, his Wife Martha, Daughter Magdalena, and his young Son Jacob, besides Adrian Tacafaxi, Joanna, Leo Canyemon, and Paulus Danyemon, I leave to the pleasure of the Reader to believe. Father Hazart relates their Martyrdom thus: Hazarts Relation of some Martyrs.¶ HAlf a Mile from Arima stands a House in a Valley, built on eight Pil∣lars, cover'd with Straw, and the Walls of Wood. On the seven∣teenth of October, Anno 1613. they were led out of the City; at which time it
was present death to be a Christian, and yet twenty thousand Christians came to∣gether, and divided themselves into several Companies, carrying lighted Tor∣ches, and wore red Caps, walking six and six in a row, in the same manner as they go in Procession in Rome and Antwerp, strowing the Paths which they pass'd with Coral and Bays, to the honor of all the Saints. The Martyrs went forth from amongst the Company into the foremention'd House, where every one embrac'd a Wooden Pillar; but whilst the Executioner was tying them fast one after another to the Posts, Leo Canyenon, none knew how, got upon the top of the House, and call'd from thence with a loud voyce, saying, Brothers, this day appears the power of Faith in Jesus Christ, whilst we gladly endure the Flames, which can scarce devour our Bodies; but we shall be rais'd out of the Ashes, to be preserv'd at the day of Judgment from everlasting Fire in a most blessed Life: Brothers, be constant to the Law of God, and account him above your lives and fortunes. Thus having finish'd his Discourse he descended, and suffer'd himself to be ty'd to the eighth Pillar. When they were all bound, the Jesuits Commander, Gasper, shew'd them the Picture of Jesus ty'd to a Post, and miserably Whipp'd in the Synagogue; and calling upon them said, Look how much you resemble our Saviour when he suffer'd un∣der Pontius Pilate: This is he for whose love you die, who exprest his affections before∣hand when he dy'd for you, to live in him that arose alive from death: He will crown you in Heaven with glorious Crowns. The Executioners staid for the finishing of Gas∣per's Speech, then setting the Stakes about the Straw-house on fire, the Martyrs standing about three Foot from it, that so they might roast by degrees. Mean while the Strings with which Magdalen, Fayaxinda's Daughter was made fast being burnt, she fled, not from the Fire, but went and took many glowing Coals, placing them on her Head like a Crown. The Cord of Jacob's young Son was also burnt, and he ran to his Mother Martha, who bid him call upon Jesus Maria. Thus much in short of what Hazart relates, with many Circum∣stances of Words and Deeds describ'd at large. Daifusama persecutes the Roman Christians.But it is very well known, that Daifusama did persecute the Christians very severely, and by strict Edicts commanded all his Substitute Kings to prosecute and punish them according to the Laws; so that in the Kingdom of Bungo they were burnt, and in the Province Chicuin hang'd up by the Legs. And here Orbedono sat in the City Facata representing the King, at the en∣trance of one of their Temples, with four Judges, holding a great Book, in∣dors'd thus, A Catalogue of the Names of those that deny'd Christ: In which every one were to subscribe that return'd again to their former Faith; and those that would not were sure to suffer intolerable punishments and death. Amongst great numbers were onely Thomas and Joachim that did not apostatize from their Christianity; therefore they were immediately Hang'd on a Tree by the Feet on two Boughs, that the uppermost his Head, touch'd the lowermost his Feet: thus they hung half a Day, and a whole Night, the Japanners deriding them as they pass'd by, looking upon them as Fools that would suffer so cruel a Death for a strange Religion; but they not regarding their Discourse were soon after beheaded. Cruelties us'd against them in Xiqui and Arima.In the Island Xiqui the Christians were carry'd about naked, Nail'd on Cros∣ses, beheaded, and with many other exquisite tortures put to death. But above all the Apostate King of Arima exceeded them in their tortures, having amongst other things two sharp Pieces of Wood, between which their Legs were put, and after beat close together, which occasion'd such a grievous Pain, that most forsook the Roman Faith.
Hazart Church Hist.The Reasons which stirr'd up Daifusama to this cruelty, and chiefly since the Year 1613. the Jesuit Hazart saith, are chiefly four. The first Reason why the Japan Emperor persecu∣ted the Christians.The first was Daifusama's suspecting the Spanish Forces, which spread daily more and more over India, insomuch that great Islands and vast Provinces did already bow to them. In the West they had subdu'd a whole new World, call'd America; and still not being satisfi'd with so great a Conquest, was come through the unknown South-Sea, and had there made himself Master of seve∣ral Territories in the East; the Molucca Islands, the Castle Malacca, and the far-spreading Philippines being all under his subjection, from whence he might, when he pleas'd, send over his Forces to Japan; not that they are so near that the Philippines may be seen from Japan, as Hazart without reason sets down, their nearest Promontories being at least two hundred Dutch Miles distant from each other, but that Japan being already full of Foreigners which were up in Arms, and also well stor'd with Christians; who knew, but that together in a short time they might deliver it up to a Christian Prince? The second Reason.The second Reason Hazart tells us was this: A Ship lying at Anchor in a Japan Haven, one Yamondono, a Gentleman of that Countrey, desirous to see the same, went Aboard, where he found the Master looking over the Map of the World: Yamondono entreated him to instruct and inform him concerning the Territories, Mountains, Rivers, Cities, and Havens therein. Nothing more amaz'd him, than to see the Spaniards have Command over so great a part of Europe, America, and Asia, and that they still held their Possession. But the Master being examin'd farther, told him, That his Countreymen drove a Trade with all the World, and that no People suffer'd any damage by them, but what wrong any did them they righted by Arms; with which they had subdu'd many Kingdoms. Yamondano desir'd to know if they did not send their Ministers beforehand, to gain the hearts of the Inhabitants by Preaching the Doctrine of Christ, and to stir them up against their Heathen Governors, to the end that when any Insurrection should happen, they might by a con∣junction with the male-content Natives, enable themselves to a more easie Conquest: The Master acknowledg'd that was the Design of their Priests: which Yamondono laying up in his mind, soon after sent word thereof to the Emperor; who slept not upon so weighty a Matter, but resolv'd suddenly to free himself of the Popish Clergy, as his Predecessor Taicosama did, Anno 1587. commanding them all in twenty days to depart from Japan. Fathom the Japan Har∣bors.This News of Yamondono was back'd by another casual Information given to Daifusama, That a Spanish Pilot had fathom'd, and with a Plummet sounded the depth of several Japan Harbors, which was suspected to be done for no other end, but that they intended to Land in some of those Places, and to sub∣due Japan, as they had done many Provinces both in the East and West. The third Reason of the Persecution Hazart lays upon the English and Hol∣landers.The third Reason of the Persecution, Hazart lays the blame thereof upon the English and Hollanders, who reported that the Spaniards had aim'd along time to make themselves not onely Masters of Europe, but the West part of the World; and to that end, not many years since they had made great slaughter in Peru, Mexico, France, Netherlands, and other Places, that no Age ever heard of so many and so cruel; That they sent their Priests beforehand to prepare the ways, and under a cloak of Religion to draw the People to their humors, ex∣torting great Riches from them; and making them believe, that the Pope hath an absolute and unlimited Power, to dispose of all Kingdoms and Provinces, ac∣cording to his will and pleasure, and that Subjects therefore are not ty'd to be
always obedient to their Heathen Governors, but might release themselves when they saw a convenient opportunity; That the Jesuits crept in every where, and by subtile Plots and Contrivances sought to dethrone Princes, cau∣sing many Murders and Uprores where-ever they came; for which cause seve∣ral Christian Princes oftentimes, banish'd them from their Courts and Coun∣treys. In France stood a long time an Iron Plate, whereon was Engraven all the Villanies for which they were banish'd out of that Countrey. The Sor∣bonne in France presented some years past a Writing to the Court, wherein they shew'd, that the World never bred more traiterous and bloody Villains than the Jesuits. The Cities Antwerp, Padua, Bruges, Tholouse, Bourdeaux, Prague, and other Wall'd Places, oftentimes for their horrid and abominable actions have thrust them forth. And had not the wisdom of the Venetian Governors been deluded along time by their dissimulation of Zeal, they had not so long been pester'd with them: But quickly the English, Scots, and several other Kingdoms, had rid their hands of them by banishment. This Hazart, being himself a Jesuit, sets down as the most prevailing Reason and Motive that stirr'd up Dai∣fusama against the Roman Christians, and chiefly the Priests. The fourth Reason.But the last Fast Fault he lays upon the Japan Prince Portasius, who being King of Arima, pretended to be highly in Favor with the Emperor, because his Son had married Daifusama's Niece, and therefore sought no small share of the Province Figen, which by Inheritance he laid claim to: For the obtaining this his desire, he sent Paulus Daifachi, an expert Courtier, and great Favorite of the Emperor's, with many rich and costly Presents, to deliver to Daifusama; which he refusing, were imbezell'd away. Upon notice whereof, and ob∣serving the Protractions us'd in his Business, Protasius was displeas'd with Dai∣fusama's Dealings, and apprehended some danger therein. The best way for prevention whereof, and to know where the business halted, he resolv'd in Person to go to the Emperor; to which purpose he went accompany'd with his Son Michael and Daughter in Law: But both of them had a wicked design in their Heads to Murder Protasius, because he would not, according to the Japan Custom, being over-grown in years, resign up his Province. Protasius having receiv'd a denial concerning his business, was banish'd, and Daifachi came to a miserable end, being condemn'd with his Wife to Ride on gall'd and sore Horses through the Streets of Surunga; and on the one and twentieth of April, Anno 1612. ty'd to a Stake surrounded with Fire, at three Foot distance from him, and so by degrees was roasted to death: His Wife obtain'd some fa∣vor, having with patience view'd her Husbands deplorable end. This Protasius had been a chief promoter of the Roman Religion in Arima, which was ill resented by Daifusama, and the more because he did not deliver up the Crown, being antient, to his Son, as the Japan Custom was, but kept the Authority in his own hands. The fifth Reason why Daifusama persecuted the Christians in JapanBesides these Reasons of Hazart, I find a fifth the occasion of the Persecution in Japan, mention'd in the daily Annotations, or Journal of the Embassy of Frisius and Brookhurst, namely the Portuguese Priests (as the Japanners say) had formerly great priviledges allow'd them, insomuch that they Preach'd their Doctrine, and spread their Religion, as if they were Natives of the Countrey, whose Faith was grounded with the peopling of Japan. They built also Churches, Cloysters, and Schools, planting religious Orders, as in one Place, The Society of the holy Virgin, by Didacus Gonnoia, besides many others, as well Franciscans and Dominicans, as Jesuits, had spread themselves all over Japan, and
by their Masses, Confessions, Purgatory, and such like, got an incredible sum of Money of the poor innocent People, bringing every year little less than a Tun of Gold out of the Countrey, insomuch that where ever they came, they generally undid all the People; yet notwithstanding they charm'd them in such a nature, that their Word amongst them was a Law. They had now also got∣ten a Bishop at Nangesaque, and were Plotting to depose the Heathen Emperor from his Throne, and to set the Crown on the Head of a Christian Prince, un∣der whom they might have free liberty of publishing their Doctrine; but the Letter being discover'd, in which the King of Portugal had advice to make him∣self Master of Japan, the Emperor was so exceedingly enrag'd thereat, that forthwith he determin'd without mercy to destroy all the Portuguese. Of which not long after receiving informations,A bloody Battel be∣tween the Japan Christians and Heathens. the Japan Christians drew together for their own defence; by which means they form'd a considerable Army of betwixt seventy and eighty thousand Men: Against whom the Imperial For∣ces drew into the Field, but were shamefully beaten and routed; yet soon af∣ter being again reinforc'd with fresh Recruits, they were commanded to fight to the last Man, and destroy the Christians without mercy: whereupon ensu'd another Battel, with resolution either to Die or Conquer; a long time the Vi∣ctory was doubtful on whose side it would fall, but at last the Christians were worsted. Cruel destruction of Ja∣pan Christians,Soon after follow'd inhumane Cruelty and Murdering, whereby not onely the Portuguese and Japan Christians were to suffer, but the Heathens swore revenge to the fifth and sixth Generation; nay, so far proceeded their malice, that whole Streets were carry'd to Execution, if onely one Christian had resided in it. The foremention'd Examples did Daifusama follow in cold Blood, behead∣ing all the Christians: But because that did not seem a Death cruel enough to terrifie them, he afterwards commanded them to be crucifi'd. The Romans us'd in former times,Dogs Crucifi'd betwixt the Temples of Sumanus and Inven∣tus, to Nail a living Dog on a Cross made of Box, tying a Goose on the top of it: This was done in Commemoration of the Senones coming from Gaul with a victorious Army, making themselves Masters of Rome, wasting the City, and putting all the Inhabitants to the Sword, except onely a few that escap'd into the Capitol, where they defended themselves manfully, frequently beating off the Senones; who having made divers attempts in vain, at length in a dark Night stole up the Hill; the Guards and Sentinels, tir'd out with Duty, and faln asleep, were like to have been surpris'd, had not some Geese which were Grazing upon the sides of the Hill, afrighted by the approach of the Enemy, by their loud Gagling, wak'd the Sentinel and Guards, and consequently sav'd the Capitol. But the Romans in process of time crucifi'd Men in stead of Dogs, of which the Slave which Plautus presents in his Comedy, says thus: I know the Cross must be my Grave,Plaut in Milite. threaten no more; my Ancestors carry'd it before my Fathers, Grandfathers, and great Grandfathers time. But the Romans us'd not to crucifie Slaves,Who were Crucifi'd, and wherefore. unless they had committed great Crimes; as for example, if any one complain'd falsly against his Master to a Magistrate, or if he went to Soothsayers to enquire of his Master's death, or if they ran away: However, this kind of death was ordain'd for Malefactors, whose Condition was mean, and Crimes very hainous; but the better sort of Criminals were beheaded, of which the Roman Law saith thus:Paulus L. V. Cent. 13. It is thought fitting that all Murderers, if extract∣ed of a good Family, shall be beheaded, and the meaner sort crucifi'd, or thrown to wild
Beasts. When the Roman Priviledge was debarr'd by the tyranny of the Em∣perors, oftentimes, especially in the Army (where Law gives place to Arms) several Commanders, as Captains, Majors, Field-Marshals, and others, were Nail'd to the Cross. But besides the Romans,Thucyd. .1. most known Countreys have cruel ways of Execu∣ting their Malefactors, which the Greek Writer Thucidides testifies of King Ina∣rus, who being taken by Conspiracy, was crucifi'd by the Egyptians. Crucifying usual in all Countreys, Rerod. Thebia.Herodotus relates, That Polycrates subdu'd the Island Samos, and all Greece, re∣joyced at his victorious Arms: his good fortune continu'd so long, that doubt∣ing it would at last prove cross, as an endeavor to prevent the turn thereof, he threw a Precious Stone into the Sea, which not long after he found in the Belly of a Fish, that being boyl'd was brought to his Table. But Polycrates died not so happy, for the Persian Orcates by subtilty taking him Prisoner in Magnesia, fulfill'd that which Polycrates his Daughter dream'd the Night before her Father went away, to wit, that she saw him taken up into the Air, and wash'd by Jupiter, and dry'd again by the Sun; which Orcates perform'd in crucifying Polycrates, when the Heavens pour'd down upon him, and the Sun scorch'd him in such a manner, that his Fat dropp'd and ran down by the Cross. Plutarch. in Vit, Herod. in Coll.In like manner did Alexander the Great crucifie the Physician Glaucus, and two thousand Tyrian Slaves; and Xantippus the Athenian, the Persian Artyacta. They perform'd this bloody Office themselves purposely to delight the Spectators, who satisfi'd their Eyes by beholding them shrink up their Bodies, working of the Sinews and Veins, and pleas'd their Ears with the doleful cries of the miserable Wretches, dying by degrees. The Germans and Gauls us'd this kind of punishment to Traitors and Rebels: But nore were more expert at it than the Africans; and amongst them the Car∣thaginians, oftentimes so using their Generals, if they came off vanquish'd, not∣withstanding they had fought valiantly, nay sometimes though they came home Victors; for if any thing of misdemeanor could be found against them, they died without mercy. Divers ways of Cruci∣fying.But they do not observe in all Places one manner, or way of Crucifying: for first, the Crosses differ'd in shape, and when great numbers were con∣demn'd, they oftentimes made Trees serve for that purpose. At other times they us'd single Poles, on which they Nail'd their Hands and Feet one over another. Others were made of two Pieces of Wood, or more: sometimes both Pieces are of an equal length, joyn'd together exactly in the middle, so that the hindmost part of the Crucifi'd comes just to the Place where it is joyn'd, and his Hands and Feet being stretch'd out, are made fast by four great Nails. The Church Histories tell us, That the Apostle St. Andrew suffer'd in that manner. Tertullian adds hereunto the Actions of Jacob,Tertul. de Bapt. c. 3. which laid his hands across when he blessed Ephraim and Manasseh, whereby he signifi'd, that future bles∣sedness should accrew to Mankind from the Cross of our Saviour. At other times the Crosses were made of two unequal Poles, the longest of which being set in the Ground, and the shortest fastned towards the top, so that a small part of the longest appear'd above the other, on which was Writ∣ten the Crime for which they suffer'd; or else they carry'd the occasion of his Death on a Board before him to the Cross, or by a Cryer made it known to all the Spectators. Some Crosses had more than two Pieces of Timber; for
besides the upright and thwart Poles, there was a crooked Piece of Wood, in which the cross Pole rested: or on the upper end of the longest were two Pieces of Timber nail'd cross one above another: or else from the middle Piece hung two other Pieces of Timber downwards; or else the long Pole had two Sticks nail'd across, one above, and the other below; on the uppermost of which they made fast their Arms, and on the undermost the Feet. This last was in use amongst the Japanners.How the Japanners make them fast. But in stead of nailing they ty'd them, sometimes laying the Cross down on the Ground, and there raising that and the Crucifi'd up together. At other times they first made the Cross fast in the Ground, setting three Ladders against it, on the middlemost of which the Suf∣ferer ascended, being pull'd up on both sides by Ropes made fast to his Hands. Sometimes they tie the Condemned to a cross Pole by his Hands, and then by two Ropes with a Pulley hoise him up to the top. The Japanners also torture their Crucifi'd after another manner than the Romans, Greeks, Syrians, Persians, Africans, and other People. The Romans and Greeks caus'd them to be Whipp'd with Scourges full of sharp Rowels, ei∣ther ty'd to a Pillar in the Court-house, or else all the Way till they came to the Cross. The like relates Philo, how that the Roman General Flaccus caus'd a great ma∣ny Jews in Alexandria to be nail'd to the Cross, which had before, in the open Court, been miserably Whipp'd. And Curtius relates,Curt. l. 7. That Alexander the Great resolutely caus'd the Sogdian Arimazes to yield up and withdraw from their invincible Rock, with thirty thousand Soldiers; of which he took the chiefest Commander, and Crucifi'd him at the Foot of the Rock. How the Japanners Cru∣cifie.Moreover, others strip them stark naked as they were born: but the Japan∣ners tye them on two cross Pieces of Timber with their Clothes on. This Custom was also us'd by the Romans, though but seldom. Concerning the Apostle St. Andrew,Abdias Hist. Apol. l. 3. the Historian Abdias relates, That the Vice-Roy Aegeas in Edessa, gave strict command to the Executioners not to nail him to the Cross, but to bind him, that he might be the longer dying: for at other times they use great Nails, whose number was left to the pleasure of the Executioner; most commonly they drove one through each Hand near the Wrist, and the Feet near the Leg: but at other times they strike several through their Hands, which they doe chiefly when they fear that the Nails will not hold,Cruelty us'd in Cruci∣fying. but slip through the Hands, by which the whole weight of the Body hangs. The Martyr Agricola being made fast with divers great Spikes, died under the Executioners hands. This cruelty seem'd less barbarous than that, when they made a great Fire under the Cross, so burning the Malefactor, or choaking him up with the Smoak. This kind of Death thousands of Christians suffer'd, while they were persecuted above three hundred years:Tertul. Apol. Cult. wherefore, according to Tertullian, they generally went by the Name of Takkebos-Men, because they were burnt by the Boughs of Trees on the Cross. The same Death the Martyr Polycarpus died.Euseb. l. 4. c. 17. It is remarkable what Eusebius Writeth concerning him: when the Executioners would nail him to the Cross, he said, Let me stand loose in the Fire, I shall be able, by Gods assistance, to en∣dure it with patience: whereupon they onely bound him to the Cross without Nailing. It was accounted also a merciful Death to the Crucifi'd, to let Lyons, Ty∣gers,
Bears, and other Beasts of Prey, eat them from their Feet upwards: which manner of cruelty Nero us'd to the Christians. But commonly the Hea∣then endeavor'd to make them undergo a long and lingring Death, therefore sometimes tying them with their Heads downwards, Nailing their Arms athwart underneath, and their Feet on the upper part of the Cross. The Martyr Victorinus being thus Crucifi'd by order of the Emperor Nerva,Martyrl. Sep. 5. Mai. 3. liv'd three days, and Timotheus and Maura, nine, admonishing one another to be constant in their Faith; so that they oftentimes dy'd of Hunger, whilst the Blood slowly dropping from them occasion'd great faintness, and at last death: nor did their tyrannous rage end with their lives, but remain'd barbarously sal∣vage to their dead Bodies, which they permitted no Burial, but left exposed as a Prey for the Fowls of the Air. Thus was the Sentence pronounc'd against the Martyrs Claudius, Asterius, and Neon: Let them be Nail'd to the Cross, that their Flesh may be devour'd by the Ravens. Those that were not by excess of Scourging before-hand tir'd out, liv'd a long time on the Cross: whereof some, according to Seneca, did spit on those that stood gazing on them. Others,Just. l. 22. as Justinus witnesses of the Carthaginians concerning their General Bomilcar, rail'd at those that had caus'd them to be Crucifi'd. Bomilcar unhappily lay in Sicily in the Field against Agathocles, from whence returning, he was taken in the Market-place in Carthage, and Nail'd to a Cross, and from thence, as from a Stage, he related the treacherous dealings of his Subjects, charging sometimes Hanno, then Gisgo, and at last Hamilcar with several Crimes, of which he wish'd them to clear themselves. Whilst these cruel ways of Crucifying were us'd, it happen'd sometimes, though very seldom, that by the favor and compassion of the Princes, the Cru∣cifi'd were taken off, and recover'd. Josephus in sua vita.Josephus relates, how that going from a Village to the Roman Army, he saw a great many Jews hanging on Crosses; amongst which were three that had for∣merly been his intimate Friends; and seeing them in that miserable condition, he immediately went to the General, Titus Vespasianus, to beg of him that he would grant him leave to take them down, which he permitted; but of those three, onely one was preserv'd alive. To Rack the Crucifi'd for a quicker dispatch, was perform'd on the two Murderers which suffer'd with Christ; but that is not according to the Roman, but the Levitical Law, as you may read in Deuteronomy:Deut. 21. Vers. 22, 23. If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day (for he that is hanged is accursed of God) that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. Ambrosius gives us his opinion thereof: It seemed, says he,Ambr. in c. 3. in Rom. to be enough for a condemn'd Person that he is hang'd up, and dies on the Wood: for if he should hang longer, his Death would suffer more shame than his Crime had deserv'd, and would be a continual disgrace to his Posterity, when his Death should daily be reported up and down. Rack the Crucifi'd.But Racking was not usual with the Romans, who sought by long torturing to make their Death the more miserable, so delighting their Ears with the Cries and Shreeks of the poor dying Wretches: Yet the Spectators seem'd not satisfi'd by beholding onely the misery of these poor condemn'd Creatures. How it is.The Roman Emperors Dioclesian and Maximinus began first to Rack the Cru∣cifi'd, which they perform'd in this manner: They held an Iron Anvil un∣der
their Legs and Arms, whilst another with a great Mallet broke their Bones all to pieces. Why the Heathens and Japanners Crucifie the Christians.It is thought that the Heathens in antient times, and the Japanners under Daifu∣sama's Government, chose that Death on purpose for the Christians, because they believed in a Crucifi'd Christ: Wherefore Daifusama also gave them charge to run them through the Sides with two long Spears, because our Saviour was transpierced. And whilst the Heathens sought thus to disgrace the Christians by Crucifying them, they took it as a great glory, dying the same Death as the Son of God had done for their Sins. Concerning this kind of Punishment, and the Cross it self, several Authors have Written at large, especially Minutius Felix, Maximus Taurinensis, Tertullia∣nus, and others;Justin. Apol. 2. I will out of all select onely two, viz. Justin Martyr, who says, View all things in the World, can they be Govern'd, or any ways us'd without the Sign of the Cross? The Earth is not Plough'd without it. The Diggers perform not their Labor, nor other Handicrafts, unless they have a Cross amongst their Tools or Instruments. Man differs no way in his shape from a Beast, onely that he is upright, and can spread his Arms into the form of a Cross. Hieronymus says,Hieronim. in Mar. c. 11. The fashion of a Cross represents the four corners of the World. The Birds when they flye in the Air take upon them the shape of a Cross. A Man Swim∣ming, or Praying, shews also like a Cross. It is also worthy our observation what Ruffinus,Ruff. l. 2.2. c. 29. Sozom. l. 3. c. 15. Sozomenus, and Suidas have publish'd, namely, That in the time of the Emperor Theodosius the Great, the Idol Temples were all pull'd down. In Egypt was also destroy'd an antient Temple, dedicated to the famous Se∣rapis: The Walls round about being pull'd to the Ground discover'd several Stones Engraven with strange Characters, which onely the Priests of Serapis could Read, many of which were made like a Cross, signifying the Life which was to come. Lactantius Firmianus relates,Lact. l. 4. c. 13. That the Oracle of Apollo long before our Savi∣ours Birth, roar'd out this Verse of Christ's Suffering, By Nails and Crucifying Pain, A bitter Death he did sustain. It seems no wonder that Daifusama, according to the example of the Roman Heathens, for the Reasons aforemention'd, when he perceiv'd that the Behead∣ing of the Christians seem'd too easie a Death, he Crucifi'd them. The Spanish Forces the occasion of the Japanners persecuting the Christians.But among the five Occasions which made Daifusama persecute the Christians, was the suspected Forces of the Spaniards, who made themselves Masters of di∣vers Places in the World, as the far-spreading Coasts of Guinee, and Angola in the Confines of Africa; and to the West, a whole new World, divided into New-Spain, Mexico, Peru, Chili, and Chaca, besides many brave Islands which they had Conquer'd. And since Anno 1581. the Portuguese fell under the King of Spain, all those vanquish'd Territories in India were likewise become their Acquests; so that they could in a short time bring great Forces from Goa, Ma∣lacca, Macao, and other Places, to Sea. But chiefly the Spaniards in the Philippines were most suspected, as being too near the Japanners, they not desiring such Potent Neighbors, who but a few years before had Landed there, and since endeavor'd continually to enlarge their Dominions. But this business requires our farther Description.
Who first discover'd the Philippines.¶ AT the time when Lodowick de Velasco, in the Name of Philip the Second King of Spain, bore the Chief Command over Mexico, he receiv'd Orders from Madrid, Anno 1564. to Rig out a great Fleet, and with them seek to discover some of those Islands that lay to the Southward of Japan, where formerly Ferdinand Magellanus first Landed, when he girdled the Universe, by Sailing round about it. The Fleet set Sail from the Haven Nativitad, under the Command of Mi∣chael Lopez de Legaspi; who making his way through the South Sea, discover'd those Islands, which from Philip the Second are call'd Philippines; where setling himself in the City Manilla, he soon after built a great Church, and three Cloy∣sters; the first for the Augustine Monks, the second for the Franciscans, and the third for the Dominicans. The Spaniards possess'd these Islands quietly, till a Fleet from China gave them disturbance, and the first occcasion of War. The Spaniards in Ma∣nilla are set upon by a Chi∣nese Pyrate call'd Limahon.One Limahon, born in a City of China, by name Trucheo, a Person of mean Extract, had a long while made the Seas dangerous; for in a short time a great Company of Pyrates and Robbers joyn'd with him, to the number of two thousand, with which he Ransack'd and Pillag'd all the adjoyning Countrey: Therefore the King of Cuytan rais'd all the Forces he could possible, to take Li∣mahon; but he having notice of it, retreated to a Sea-Port Town, not having a sufficient Army to encounter the Vice-Roys Forces. At the same time the Harbour lay full of Ships, which his Men taking, and setting Sail with them, stood off to Sea; making all Prize whatever he met with: And being forty Sail, all well Mann'd, on a day he descry'd another Chinese Pyrate, call'd Vintoquiam, who had twenty Sail more than he; yet Lima∣hon resolv'd to set upon them, and had such good Success, that he conquer'd and made himself Master of fifty five Vessels more, Vintoquiam himself hardly escaping with five. Thus being encourag'd, he resolv'd to set upon all Sea-Port Towns and Villages; by which means, all China was in an Uproar, and in few days the Vice-Roy of Cuytan set out a hundred and thirty Vessels to Sea, Mann'd with forty thousand Seamen. Limahon having notice thereof, made Sail toward the desolate Isle Touzuacotican, to hide himself from the Navy, Conducted by the Knight Omoncon. Limahon's Actions.Whilst he lay lurking there, he seiz'd on two Ships, richly laden, and bound from Manilla to China: The Prisoners which he took gave him information, That there were not above seventy Spanish Soldiers in Manilla, the rest being imploy'd to discover the adjacent Isles; and how that the Countrey was fruit∣ful and populous, and the Inhabitants unprovided for War, neither were they us'd to be disturb'd by it. This News was very acceptable to him; where∣upon he steer'd his Course thither, and Sailing beyond the Islands Illocos, ran in sight of the New City Fernandina, built by John de Salzedo, and there fell upon a Spanish Galley freighted by Salzedo to fetch Provisions, which he set on fire, and without mercy put all the Men to the Sword. Salzedo affrighted by so great a Fleet, which steer'd directly towards Manilla, immediately sent thither fifty four Spaniards, to make resistance against the Enemy, and to give them at Manilla notice of the Invasion, to the end they might prepare all things in rea∣diness against their coming. But Limahon, who was forc'd to Victual at the nearest Islands, came after Salzedo, whose Fleet was stor'd with all manner of Provisions, arriv'd at Manilla in the Evening, on the last of October, Anno 1574.
And had the Wind blown any thing hard, that Night would have laid Ma∣nilla in Ashes, and drown'd the Inhabitants in their own Blood: For Limahon sent in the darkest part of the Night four hundred Men on Shore, which he commanded to spare neither Fire nor Sword: But the Sea going very hol∣low, they could not possibly Land till next Morning at eight of the Clock. About a League below the City they leap'd ashore, and march'd up along a plain Field in good order, with two hundred Musqueteers in the Front, and as many Pike-men in the Rere, towards the City Manilla. The Countrey Peo∣ple discovering them, brought the News to the Spaniards, of which not one would believe it, every one thinking it onely to be an Uproar made on pur∣pose by the Natives. Storms Manilla.Mean time the Chineses came to the first House of the City, in which the Field-Marshal Martin Goyty had his Residence, which they fir'd, and slew him, with all his Family, except his Wife, which fled desparately wounded into the City. By her every one might see how the Business was; whereupon some Soldiers ran disorderly to encounter the Enemy, but being all slain in a short time, made the rest more wary, who marching up very orderly against the Enemy, forc'd them to retreat, and at last drove them back to their Ships. Limahon hearing this News, weigh'd Anchor, and Sail'd to the Haven Ca∣bita, two Leagues beyond Manilla. At this time Guido de Labassares was Gover∣nor of the Philippines, in the place of the Deceas'd Michael Lopez de Legaspy. La∣bassares saw no likelihood to keep off so great an Enemy with Pallisadoes, with which Manilla at that time was onely defended; and to fly from thence, would be too great a Reproach and Disgrace for the Spanish Nobles: Therefore they thought it convenient to leave the City, and on a Hill not far off, with all speed to throw up a Platform:The Spaniards raise For∣tifications. Two Days and Nights all those were imploy'd that were able, to finish the Work, ramming Poles into the Ground, against which they nail'd Planks, throwing Earth against them, and Barrels with Sand. Four Iron Guns (for so many they had in the City) were planted on a Point of the New Fortification. It so fortun'd, that Limahon made some stay in the Haven Cabita, whilst Salzedo brought fifty four Spaniards to Labassares Assistance. Limahon burns Manilla.The Fort was scarce finish'd, and Salzedo enter'd with his Men, when Li∣mahon dropp'd Anchor at break of Day before the City Manilla, and put six hundred Men on Shore, which ran into the City, and set the same on fire: That done,Storms their Fortifi∣cation. they march'd towards the new Fortification, where they met with so stout Resistance, that in short time two hundred of the Chineses were slain, and as many wounded;Is beaten off. where on the contrary, the Spaniards lost onely two Men, an Ensign call'd Sancio Ortiz, and another nam'd Francis de Leon. The Pyrates being thus roughly entertain'd, durst adventure no more; wherefore they Sail'd back to Cabita, and from thence forty Leagues up the great Stream Pangasinan,Goes to live near the River Pangasinan. where he found a pleasant and fruitful Countrey, and a convenient place to hide himself from the Chinese Forces. So Sailing up a League into the Countrey, he rais'd a Fort on a Promontory, and forc'd the Inhabitants to pay him Tribute, as their Prime Lord. From hence he sent Ships abroad continually, which Cruising too and again about that Coast, let not one Vessel scape they met with, reporting, That he had utterly routed the Spaniards from the Philippines. These Tidings, by many believ'd for Truth, caus'd no small Consideration in Labassares: For the Natives being kept in by the Valour of the Spaniards, might upon this News break forth, and by their great numbers easily over∣power
and cut off a few, unless he re-establish'd their former Authority: Which to prevent, he judg'd it fit in open War to set upon the Pyrate: So gathering all their Forces and Vessels together, from the Islands Pintadoes and Philippines, they set forward. Salzedo besieges Limahon.In the Fleet were two hundred and fifty Spanish Sea-men and Soldiers, and two thousand five hundred Indians, being all under the Command of Salzedo, who brought the Fleet about break of day, Anno 1575. the twentieth of March, into the River Pangasinan, the Mouth of which he block'd up with Vessels chain'd to one another, and put his Men ashore, with four great Guns. Scouts being sent to learn how Limahon's Forces lay, found them all unprovided, he not suspecting the least danger from the Spaniards, which he thought had so much to do in repairing their Losses, that they could not think of taking Re∣venge. This Intelligence was very pleasing; whereupon immediately Gabriel de Ribera march'd by a private Way to Limahon's Fort: The Commanders Peter de Chaves, and Laurence Chacon, Rowing with small and nimble Skiffs up the River, to the end they might also fall upon the Pyrate by Water, when Ribera set up∣on him at Land. Salzedo himself lay in Ambuscade, for a Reserve. Chaves and Chacon found Limahon's Fleet unmann'd, at an Anchor under the Fort, which they presently fir'd, as also the Houses and Pallisadoes ashore,Burns Limahon's Fleet. and fell so fu∣riously upon the Chineses, that above a hundred of them were slain, and Lima∣hon escap'd very narrowly into the Castle. A Skirmish between Salzedo and Limahon.Here he took a little breath, and sent out the valiantest of the Besieg'd, which oppos'd the Spaniards, who now tired with Fight, and enfeebled with ex∣cessive Heat, and other Labors, were necessitated, notwithstanding they had fresh Supplies came to them, to retreat, with the loss of five of their own Men, and thirty Indians, besides many wounded. The next day very early Salzedo drew up his Men in good Order before the Castle, daring the Pyrate to a Battel. Limahon fortifies himself.He having been busie all Night, had planted three great Guns, besides ma∣ny smaller, on his Bulwarks, and lin'd all his Curtains with Fire-arms; in∣somuch that Salzedo thought it dangerous Storming, but judg'd it fit to be∣siege the Fort at distance; and the rather, because most of Limahon's Provisions, and other Necessaries, were burnt with the Ships, so that he could neither escape, nor hold out long. Three Months Salzedo lay before the Castle, during which time the Spanish Ships went to and again, from thence to Manilla for Provisions, and other Necessaries; when Michael de Loarcia saw just without the Haven Bulian a Vessel from Sangley, which he chac'd, and overtook: In the Ship hapned to be a Chi∣nese, call'd Sinsay, who had a long time drove a Trade in Manilla; he de∣sir'd them not to fire a Gun, before they did very well know what Vessel it was: Whereupon boarding one another, they inform'd Sinsay, That they had the Chinese Admiral Omoncon aboard,The Chinese Admiral Omoncon comes to the Spa∣niards. who had left his Fleet to inquire after Li∣mahon. The Admiral being then inform'd by them of the whole Business, went to Salzedo's Army, whence having been courteously receiv'd, he departed for Manilla, (for it was judg'd that Limahon could not possibly escape) where he staid some time; but because the Business lasted longer than he expected, and so long absence from his Fleet might be inconvenient, he Sail'd thither, re∣solving in a short time to return, and fetch Limahon to China. With Omoncon went also Martin de Herrado, and Hieronimus Marius; the first
extracted from Pampelona,The first Europeans that went to China. the other a Mexican, both Augustine Monks; and with them, Peter Sarmiento, and Michael de Loarcia, which were to bring back the Adventures that should happen to Herrado and Martin, to the end such a weigh∣ty Concern might immediately be written to Madrid, because the Empire of China would prove very advantageous to them: And these were the first which are known out of Christendom to have set Foot therein. The manner of the Chi∣nese Sailing.Omoncon set Sail from the Haven Bulian, and steer'd his Course according to the Chinese manner, after a Compass with twelve Points; so Sailing from one Island to another, not daring to venture far into the Offin: Wherefore he ex∣ceedingly admir'd, when Sarmiento told him, That the Spaniards Sailing from Mexico to the Philippines, Steer'd through the Southern Ocean, without seeing Land in three Months time. Omoncon reckon'd himself to be near China, by the depth of the Water, which about seventy Leagues from the Shore is eighty Fathom, and then grows shallower by degrees, as they approach the Coast, At last he discover'd the stately City Tutuhul, beautiful to the Eye, by reason of its many Towers and magnificent Buildings, lying in the Territory Chinchy. At the Mouth of an Inlet stood a Sentinel, on a high Rock, who gave sudden notice to seven Ships, that lay at an Anchor behind a Promontory, that he discry'd a Sail afar off at Sea: Whereupon weighing with all speed, they chas'd Omoncon, who bore up to Tutuhul; and though he was commanded by several Guns to strike, yet he went on, and regarded them not. The Governor himself was gotten into a nimble Skiff with Oars, which Omoncon fetch'd up by degrees; and they per∣ceiving the Colours, took in their Sails, and lay by to receive the Governor, whom Omoncon courteously entertain'd,Omoncon courteously re∣ceiv'd. and proceeded on his Voyage to Tansu∣sa, a pleasant and strong City, fortified with Walls. Here, betwixt firing of Guns and Musquets, he put the Augustine Monks ashore, having had free leave and permittance from the Governor of Tansusa; to which purpose, according to the Chinese Custom, a small white varnish'd Board was brought him from the Governor, sign'd with his own Hand; the Letters which were written upon it were these, Permit the Strangers to Land freely. Why the Spaniards are forc'd to go from China.But after the viewing of several Chinese Towns, and other Curiosities, they were commanded to depart, the Chineses suspecting, that the Spaniards having Plantations in most Countreys, were come over purposely to make an Inspe∣ction there. This Jealousie began to increase the more, because the Rumor was, That Limahon (who was said to be block'd up in the River Pangasinan, that it was impossible for him to escape) destroy'd and ransack'd all along the Sea-coast, and had there ruin'd and pull'd a City down to the Ground. It is certain, that Limahon had prepar'd some small Vessels in his Castle, and in a dark Night made his escape between Salzedo's Watch: Yet he was falsly accus'd concerning his Pyracy; for Toacay, a Friend to the other noted Pyrate Vinto∣quiam, and Limahon's Enemy, had and did still invade the Coasts of Chinchy. ¶ MEan while the Grand Council of Chinchy assembled together, before whom the Spaniards appear'd, to give an Account for their coming to China; who reply'd so well, and gave them such Reasons, that having before been kept close Prisoners, they obtain'd Liberty. It being then New-Moon, at which time all the Soldiers in China must ap∣pear in their Arms, the Spaniards had leave to go out of the City, to the Field
where the Militia was drawn up, namely,Brave Exercising of their Militia near the City Ancheo. twenty thousand Pike-men and Mus∣quetiers, all prepar'd for an Encounter upon the Sound of Trumpet and beat of Drum, in a moments time ready to Engage, spreading the Army in a larger Circumference, or contracting it into narrower Limits. Here, like Skirmish∣ing, they fired at one another with Powder; then falling in, they endeavor'd to break their Ranks, and defeat the whole Army; the Pike-men fiercely en∣countering one another, sending their broken Pikes in pieces into the Air, to testifie their Masters Strength. Those that were not expert in Exercising, were soundly beaten by their Commanders, that by such severe Correction they might learn to do better. Four Hours were spent in training them up in their Martial Discipline; of which the Spaniards gave Testimony, That the like Exercise and Soldiers were not to be found in any Countrey in the World besides. ¶ AT last the Spaniards, receiving Commands from the Chief Governors, were forc'd to set Sail from the Haven Tansusa; and to get in the Winds way, they steer'd their Course towards the Islands Laulo and Chautubo. The last is full of Villages, the chiefest call'd Gautin,Gautin, a place of de∣fence and safe Harbor a∣gainst Pyrates. fortifi'd with five Towers rais'd of Free-stone, which serv'd for Light-houses, and sheltering places against Pyrates, which generally frequent and molest those Coasts. This Island of it self is Sandy and Mountainous; yet the Soil produces great store of Rice, Wheat, and all manner of Roots, besides many Oxen and Horses. The Inhabitants acknowledge no Supreme Authority. Afterwards they came to an Anchor before the Island Corchu, and next at An∣con, much more fruitful, though uninhabited, than Corchu.Strange accident hapned in the Island Ancon. The Chineses re∣late concerning this Island, That Ancon was formerly very Populous, but by a strange Accident became desolate; which was, That a Chinese Fleet was so separated by a great Storm upon the Coast of Ancon, that the Admiral could by no means get them together again; whereupon judging that the Ships were run ashore upon the Island, and the Seamen destroy'd by the Natives, he fell eagerly upon the innocent People, slew a great number of them, and carry'd the Remainder to China; whose Innocency, though at last it was made mani∣fest, yet they return'd not to their old Habitation, chusing rather to live up∣on the Main-Land, than go home and expect the like Misfortune. ¶ FRom Ancon the Spaniards Sail'd over to the Island Plou, where they re∣ceiv'd Information from a Fisher, That Limahon had gather'd up in the Night the Timber and Planks of his burnt Fleet; and that within the Fort, being Besieg'd by Salzedo, he had made Boats, and was fled to the Island Tocoa∣tican. The Chinese Admiral Omoncon, who Sail'd with the Spaniards to Manilla,The Chineses are very much concern'd at Lima∣hon's Escape. resented these Tydings very ill, crying out to the Spanish Seamen, Is this your Faithfulness? Do the Spaniards sell their Honesty for the Gifts of a Pyrate? How was it possible else that he could have escap'd? You reward my Courtesies well, that have open'd China for you, which is lock'd up from all Strangers. But the Spaniards sought to asswage his anger, telling him, That without all peradventure, the Governor of Ma∣nilla would give him such satisfaction, that Omoncon should no ways distrust the Fide∣lity of the Spaniards. They are at variance a∣mongst themselves, whether they should set upon Lima∣hon.Mean while they got sight of the Island Tocoatican; whereupon they had se∣veral Disputes: Omoncon would there fall upon the Pyrate Limahon, who be∣ing, as he suppos'd, tired out by a long Siege, and unprovided, might easily be
taken Prisoner, or slain. Others withstood this his eager Design, telling him, They must not account that thing done, which was to be decided by Arms, and in the Hands of wavering Fortune, and might as well have a bad as good Event. They had to deal with Men that were encourag'd by desperate Designs, and those that would fight till the last drop of Blood: And their own Fleet, laden with Horses and Goods, was more fit to proceed on in their Voyage, than to engage with an Enemy. The Command which they receiv'd from the Vice-Roy was, to carry the Spaniards back to the Manilla's; and Limahon, if they took him either living or dead, to deliver him to the Vice-Roy in China. The last Arguments seeming of greatest concern, they left Tocoatican on their Star∣board; and from the Haven Plou, in which they were kept three Weeks by contrary Winds, they Sail'd by the great Island Tangarruan, to Manilla; where the Chineses being nobly entertain'd, not long after return'd home well sa∣tisfied. Limahon dies of grief.¶ BUt Limahon finding himself too weak to make resistance, if the Spanish or Chinese Fleet should happen to come and invade him in the Haven of Tocoatican, Launch'd all his Boats into the Sea, and row'd towards a desolate Island. Here his Condition was very mean; and he who former∣ly had been a terror to China, had now scarce Roots and Plants to feed upon: Which taking to heart, he fell sick of excessive Grief, which in a short time cut off the Thred of his Life; which his Associates seeing, every one sought for a Place where he might be most secure. The Spaniards went a e∣cond time to China.¶ IN the interim, the Spaniards went on very succesfully in their Plantati∣ons of the Philippines, and made a second Voyage to China, Sailing thi∣ther Anno 1578. with the Franciscans, Peter de Alfaro a Sevilian, John Baptista an Italian, Sebastian de Francisco Barca, and Augustine de Tordesillas, and three Soldiers, being Franciscus de Duennas, John Diax Pardo, and Peter de Villarol; besides four Manillians, and a Chinese Youth taken in the War against Limahon, and since in∣structed in the Spanish Tongue. At last the Spaniards got Footing in China, and together with the Portuguese Crown, gain'd vast Territories both in the Eastern and Western Indies. The Japanners fear the Spaniards.¶ THe Island Malacca, Macao, and Manilla, lay too near Japan, to free them from jealousies of the neighboring Spanish Forces; and the more, because Japan foster'd an innumerable company of Christians, which made it their dai∣ly endeavor to spread that Religion through all the Countrey, and one of their prime Governors had already embrac'd the Faith of Jesus Christ. This was the chief Reason that made Daifusama seek their Destruction. Daifusama seeks to settle the Crown on his own Fa∣mily.And whilst he was busie with this his bloody Design, being over-grown in Age, he was exceedingly troubled for his Successor. And though he had pro∣mis'd to Taicosama by an Oath, and Seal'd it with his Blood, That Fideri, when he attain'd to the age of fifteen Years, should possess and enjoy the Imperial Throne; yet now, forgetting all ties of Oaths, or other Obligations, he resolv'd to dispatch him out of the way (notwithstanding he had married his Daughter) or else he could not deliver the Scepter to Conbosama, and so esta∣blish the Crown in his own Line. This Plot requir'd to be hid under some fair Pretence: Whereupon seri∣ously debating the matter, he at last accus'd Fideri, That in the last Civil War
he had chosen to be on the side of the Opposers, and had privately conspir'd to take the Government from him; and that he took an Imperial Authority upon him, before he was Crown'd Emperor; and also endeavor'd to take away his Father-in-law's Life. Besieges Fideri with a great Army.These Complaints and Accusations he sent before, whilst he with all his Endeavors rais'd a mighty Army in the Kingdom of Surunga. Fideri kept his Court in the Castle Osacca: Thither Daifusama march'd with his new-rais'd Forces, and Besieg'd Fideri. Three Months did he valiantly withstand all their fierce Assaults; but at last, growing too weak, sought upon reasonable Articles to deliver up the Castle:Fideri's Request deny'd. But the Emperor would not hearken there∣to; for he desir'd nothing more than the Life of Fideri. And he understand∣ing his bloody Design, said, How was it possble that a Father-in-law could thus forget all Natural Affections, and desire to make his own Daughter a Widow, and his Grandchil∣dren Orphans? The cries of the Innocent would move a stony Heart to have compassion. If Daifusama judg'd that he was not just and faithful, and did not deserve to wear the Im∣perial Crown, notwithstanding it was his Father Taicosama's Will and Pleasure, and though he was the just and lawful Heir to the Throne, yet he would freely resign up his Interest, and be contented with the least of the Japan Kingdoms, nay a mean Lordship. Why should he thirst after Blood? Why persecute his own Relations? If Daifusama fear'd any Rebellion, he might easily keep Fideri so low, that he should never dare as much as think of enjoying the Japan Empire. Why Daifusama resolv'd to kill Fideri.These mild and courteous Entreaties Daifusama regarded not; for he saw it apparent, that if he left him alive, the Crown would fall to him, he being now come to full Age; and the rather, because Fideri was exceedingly belov'd amongst the Common People, every one acknowleding him as the true and lawful Successor of his late Father Taicosama. Therefore he resolv'd to dispatch him, or else his Family would be in danger to lose the Japan Scepter. Fideri sent his Consort, Daifusama's Daughter, to her Father, humbly to beseech him to spare Fideri's Life, who would immediately become his Vassal; but she was not permitted to have Audience. Storms the Castle Osacca.Daifusama had by this time pull'd down the Out-walls of Osacca, and thrown them in the Moat, and rais'd a Platform therein, notwithstanding it was three hundred and ninety Foot broad, and three and thirty deep. The upper Breast∣work, made strongly of Clay, and Plaister'd on the out-side, was some Rods distant from the other. Next, those Walls which he had undermin'd fell to the Ground, and through a Gap made by Storming, he broke into the Castle:Takes the outmost Castle But in the inclos'd Place, where several Palaces were built, he met with some Resistance; yet the Opposers being over-power'd, were forc'd to yield. This made Daifusama absolute Master of the outer Castle: But now his Career was stopp'd at the second Moat, being of the same depth as the outer∣most, but only two hundred and fifty Foot broad. The chief Bridge over that Inner Lake hath Rails of massy Gold; the Gate is also cover'd with Golden Plates. Over this Bridge Daifusama sought to force his way,Storms the inner Castle. which with little difficulty he did, because the Besieg'd neglected to make resistance.Takes it. The Gate being broke open, made room for the Enemy, which had soon taken hold of Fideri, had he not suddenly hid himself on the inner Mountain, inclos'd with Walls, and of a noble Aspect, by a Palace whose Roof is cover'd with Golden Tyles, into which he fled, with his Mother, Consort, and a considerable num∣ber of the Prime Nobles.
Daifusama's cruelty to his Son-in-law.Daifusama had by this time secur'd them in the inner Palace; and to the end he might destroy all those at once, which oppos'd him from setling the Crown on his own Stock, he caus'd great Heaps of Wood to be laid round the Palace, which being lighted, immediately set on fire and burnt the Court, with Fideri, and the Chief of the Japan Nobility, to Ashes; so that not the least appearance of any of them was ever seen more. After this, all those were to suffer, which had at any time been familiar, or had any Correspon∣dency with Fideri. This cursed Tragedy was acted in Japan, Anno 1616. ¶ NOt long did Daifusama enjoy the benefit of his bloody Tyranny; for dying within ten Months,Daifusama dies. he left the Japan Crown to his Son Con∣bosama:His Son is made Empe∣ror. The beginning of whose Reign became remarkable by two eminent Passages, not easily to be forgotten. Horrible storm and flood in Japan.The first was a mighty Storm, which began and so increas'd more and more every Hour, that in the Havens the Ships broke their Cables, and dri∣ving on the Shore, were split in pieces. Those at Land also were not free from danger, the Wind blowing up great Trees by the Roots, casting down pieces of old Walls, shaking the Houses and Temples, and tumbling them down on a sudden: In the Streets the Houses often falling down one against another, slew those which stood there for shelter. Several in the Countrey were lifted up from the ground, and carried a good distance from the Place whereon they stood. The Sea also rag'd with impetuous Billows, that clogging the Rivers with the Surges, the Water finding no vent, overflow'd the Banks, so drowning the adjacent Countreys. Where the Rivers were inclos'd with Banks, those were all broke by the swelling Waters. The Sea beat with such violence against its bordering Coasts, that it wash'd away whole Towns and Villages; and the Salt Water flow'd into the Countrey for several Miles toge∣ther. After these Tempests, and violent Motions of the Wind and Water, fol∣low'd
another Mischief, no way inferior to these;Persecution against the Christians. being a Bloody Persecuti∣on against the Christians, rais'd by the Emperor, through the Advice of a Japan Councellor call'd Safioie, which made it his onely endeavor to destroy the Chri∣stians. The Reason pretended to move them to it, was this. After Antonius Mota, Franciscus Zeimot, and Antonius Pexot, Sailing from Dodra to China, were driven by stress of Weather on the Coast of Japan, so discover∣ing the same accidentally, the Portuguese got still greater Footing, to drive their Trade there. A Japan Youth, as we mention'd before, call'd Angar, to escape Death, whereto he was condemn'd, fled, as Father Tursellinus tells us,Tursell. in vita Xaverii, lib. 3. cap. 12. with a Merchant nam'd Georgius Alvaresius, to Malacca, and from thence travell'd to Goa. Francis Xaverius, Cosmus Turrensis, and Joannes Ferdinandes, being perswa∣ded by him, took upon them the Voyage to Japan, where Xaverius staid three years and a half, at the Charge of John the Third, King of Portugal, who spent above a thousand Ducats on that Voyage. It will not be amiss to annex here the Letter written by Xaverius, from Co∣cin,Xaver. Epist. ad Ignat. Loyolam. the twenty ninth of January, Anno 1549. to Ignatius Loyola, Master of the Je∣suits Order. Since I am here inform'd by credible Witnesses, that Japan lies not far from China, and the Inhabitants thereof, having neither Saracens nor Christians amongst them, are very desirous of Novelties, whether Natural or Spiritual; I am re∣solv'd, so soon as possible, to travel thither. In the Colledge of the Holy Hope, in Goa, is a Japan Youth, by Name Angar, of a quick and noble Apprehension, who sends a large Letter to you. He hath learn'd in eight Months time to speak, write, and read Portu∣guese, and sufficiently understands the Mysteries of our Christian Faith. I hope, by God's help, to bring many of the Japanners to embrace the Christian Religion; for I am assuredly promis'd, upon my arrival, to speak with the King, and have leave to visit their Schools or Colledges. In another Letter Xaverius writes thus:Xaver. Epist. 1550. I have oftentimes disputed with the Bon∣zies, which far exceed others in Wisdom; and chiefly with him who is accounted the Lear∣nedst among them, and higly esteem'd for his Age, being eighty years old. He is as their Bi∣shop, and is call'd Nitrix, that is to say, according to the Japan Tongue, A Heart of Truth: With him I have Discours'd, and find him oftentimes wavering in his Arguments concerning the Immortality of the Soul: Sometimes he acknowledges the same, and at other times he denies it. It is almost incredible, how strangely he affects me; and how most of the Bonzies, and several others, take delight in our Conversation. The most they wonder at, is, That we should come from Portugal to Japan, being above six thousand Leagues distance, on purpose to treat with them about Matters of Religion. The Christian Religion hath but small success a∣mongst the Japanners▪ Tursell. in vita Xaverii.Yet for all this, the Christian Religion went on but slowly; partly because Angar, according to Tursellinus, could not well describe the Articles of the Chri∣stian Faith in the Japan Tongue, and withal writ so badly, that the Japanners could not make any sense thereof; and also the Japan Tongue being exceeding difficult, Xaverius could not easily learn the same: Yet in Cangoxima were those that affected Christianity, insomuch that there was some hopes of a few that would embrace the same; but this soon vanish'd. The King of this Coun∣trey had kept Xaverius a considerable time, and permitted him to Preach the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, and Baptize those that believ'd therein; which he did, not that he was any way concern'd for the Christian Faith, but because he was inform'd, that the Portuguese Merchants Ships brought very rich and costly Commodities from Europe and Goa, which might prove very advantageous to Cangoxima, if they came thither. But because the Portugals in the interim came constantly to an Anchor at Firando, the King of Cangoxima was much displeas'd,
and chiefly had a bad opinion of Xaverius, because that he being of great esteem amongst the Portuguese, could easily perswade them to remove their Sta∣ple or Factory to Cangoxima. The Bonzies watching for such an Opportunity, stirr'd up the displeas'd King the more, because Xaverius had spoil'd their Hea∣thenish Doctrine,The King of Cangoxima is enrag'd against the Chri∣stians. and declar'd their abominable and wicked Lives. Whilst thus the Progress or the Christian Faith was stopp'd, there was publish'd an Edict, That none should Apostatize from their Fore-fathers Religion, which was establish'd in the Empire of Japan. Xaverius observing, that no good was to be done, parting from thence, went to Firando, where he converted about a hundred Persons, which he per∣form'd in this manner: First reading to them the Grounds of the Christian Faith concerning the Trinity, and of our Savior Christ, and that by his means we must be all sav'd. Angar had translated these Articles out of the Portuguese Tongue, into the Japan Language; but not without great Mistakes. This done, Cosmus Turrensis had a regard over the new Christians, whilst Xaverius and Joannes Fernandez travell'd to Amungucium,How and what the Jesu∣its learn'd in Japan. where they found several Inquisitive Peo∣ple, as well amongst the Nobles as Commons; but were never the better: for they being not able to speak the Japan Tongue, their best way then was to read twice a day at the corners of the Streets, Angar's Translation of the Christian Belief; which Doctrine seem'd very strange to many, some jeering thereat. The Children and Boys running after the Jesuits, mock'd them with what they had said, and chiefly with such Words as they could not pronounce plainly, because of the difficultness of the Japan Tongue: Yet others invited them in∣to their Houses, and besought of them farther Instructions. Their Deeds in Amangu∣cium.Xaverius and Fernandez having spent some days in Teaching the Amanguci∣ans, they were commanded to come before the King, who demanded of them, Of what Countrey they were, and why they came to Japan? Whereupon they an∣swer'd, That they were come from Portugal, a place above six thousand Leagues di∣stant from thence, to the end they might declare God's Laws, and Preach the Gospel, in which the Savior Jesus Christ was describ'd, without whom none could be sav'd. The King desir'd them to declare the Grounds of that never-heard-of Religion; which Xaverius perform'd, by reading Angar's Translation; at which the King laughing, order'd them to depart. Yet after this, Xaverius and Fernandez gave not over, but Preach'd along the Streets in the foremention'd manner: But seeing their Labor bestow'd in vain, they resolv'd to travel to the Metropolis Meaco.Xaverius travels to Me∣aco. Two Months and much Mo∣ney did they spend in this their Journey, suffering also much by Robbers, and extreme Cold: Yet having a Japan Convert in their Company, whom they had Baptiz'd Bernard, they hop'd with less difficulty to perform their Business, ha∣ving an Interpreter with them. But they soon found their expectation fru∣strated; for after long Preaching, and using all possible means, yet they could not be permitted to the presence of the Cubus;Why they could effect no∣thing there. and also the Citizens at that time being up in Arms against a crue of Rebels, had neither Time nor Ears to hearken after a New Religion. They give Presents to the King of Amangucium.Thus seeing that nothing could be done here, they return'd back with mean success to Amangucium, and there presented the King with a curious Watch, and many other Rarities, which the Portuguese Vice-Roy of the East-Indies, and the Bishop of Goa had sent them, to give to the Cubus in Meaco: But having no Audience there, they bestow'd the Presents on the King of Amangucium, who was desirous of nothing more than Foreign Rarities; yet he
proffer'd them in return of their Gifts a great Bag of Silver and Gold; but the Jesuits modestly refusing it, desir'd onely that he would be pleas'd to per∣mit them to Preach the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, which he granted. Why he put himself in rich Apparel.Mean while Xaverius, observing that the Japanners valu'd a Man according to the Richness or Meanness of his Habit, having hitherto gone in poor Ap∣parel, found that he was little or not at all regarded; therefore resolv'd to put on a rich and stately Coat, that so he might be better regarded, and because the Japanners out of Curiosity would look upon him the more: And indeed it prov'd so; for teaching therewith in the Streets, he had a far greater Con∣gregation than formerly: Then the People began private Disputations amongst themselves, concerning that Religion; and chiefly the Bonzi were at variance amongst themselves, concerning the Articles of the Christian Faith. A strange accident by which a Japanner became a Christian.¶ THe first Converting of these Heathens in Amangucium, was occasion'd by a strange Accident, which Tursellinus relates in this manner. Jo∣hannes Ferdinandez standing in the Street, surrounded with a great number of Peo∣ple, read the Book of Angar's Translation, which a Japanner passing by, heard; where∣upon he made his way through the People, and spat Fernandez full in the Face; which be suffering with patience, wip'd off, and proceeded without the least sign of anger, in reading of his Doctrine. One Auditor amongst the Crowd, seeing his admir'd Patience, was amaz'd thereat, and as if inspir'd, judg'd in himself, that without doubt it must be the True Religion, which was taught by so mild a Person; and afterwards being better In∣structed by Xaverius, was the first which receiv'd Baptism in Amangucium. Several others follow'd his example, amongst which, Bernard Eenoog, afterwards by Xaverius made a Jesuit. King of Bungo shews great kindness to the Chri∣stians.¶ WHilst the Christian Religion went on thus prosperously in Amangucium, Xaverius was sent for by Jacotondono King of Bungo, in whose Har∣bor a Portuguese Vessel was come to Anchor. He covetous of Lucre, proffer'd the Portuguese all Civility and Kindness, sending an Embassy to Goa; and pro∣moted the Christian Faith at Amangucium. His Brother, though with great resi∣stance of the Council there, being accepted of as their King, interceded also for the Christian Religion. Notwithstanding all these Favors, yet Xaverius found great opposition by the Bonzi, insomuch that he Baptiz'd not one in the Province Bungo, onely In∣structing some in the Christian Doctrine. The King seem'd also to have a great inclination to the Christian Belief; but fear'd, if he should become a Convert from the Japan Heathenism, that his Subjects would rebel against him: Yet though he remain'd a Heathen, he provided for those Jesuits that came after Xaverius a convenient Colledge, and gave free leave to Balthazar Gago and Jo∣hannes Fernandez to Preach the Gospel. Insurrection in the King∣dom of Bungo against the Christians.These Actions of the King of Bungo were ill resented by his Subjects, who took up Arms against him: But soon after Jacotondono took the chief of the Rebels, which were commanded speedily with their Relations, Wives, and Children, to be executed. Yet after that, a Company of fresh Rebels rising again, the King brought an Army of sixty thousand Men into the Field, and after various Successes, became Conqueror and absolute Master, getting also by that means Facata, Fiuago, Amangucium, and the Island Taso. Anno 1554. he sent from Bungo to Goa a Portuguese call'd Antonius Ferreira, sending his Arms to the Vice-Roy, with which he had subdu'd Fiuago; as also a Letter, entreat∣ing
his Friendship, and that he would be pleas'd to let Xaverius come over again. Miracles wrought by Xa∣verius.But Xaverius had two years before been kill'd in China, not far from Canton, after having several times laid Tempests, asswag'd Earthquakes, rais'd twenty five dead Persons to life again, if we will believe those Relations which have been divulg'd thereof. Embassy from Goa to the King of Bungo.The Vice-Roy of Goa rested not upon this Business, but dispatch'd with all possible speed the Jesuits Melchior Nugnez, and Ferdinand Mendez Pinto, to Jacaton∣dono: With a Train of forty Portuguese, richly clad, they made their appear∣ance before the King, who told them at large how many Inconveniences and Troubles he had undergone in his Kingdom, since he permitted the Christians to set footing in his Dominions, insomuch that not long since he was necessitated to slay thirteen Princes, with sixteen thousand of their Confederates, in one day, besides a great number which he had banish'd; and withal, he saw it ap∣parent, that there would be no end of Blood-shed, if he did in the least uphold them in their Proceedings in Japan; which before he did, he would first see bet∣ter Times. In vain did Nugnez use the Perswasions of the uncertainty of a Mans Life, and the certainty of Eternal Damnation for Unbelievers. Thus Jacatondono cutting off all hopes of being Converted,Depart fruitless. Nugnez departed returning fruitless to Goa: And after that, the King declin'd it daily more and more, building in the City Usuquin a stately Cloyster for the Bonzi, be∣stowing great Revenues upon the same; and sent for the most Learn'd of the Pagan Priests, which had been Tutors to Princes, and betook himself to be of their Order;King of Bungo becomes 2 Bonzi. and daily Study and Endeavors, obtain'd so much of their Learning, that he surpass'd the best of them. Yet notwithstanding all this, he molested not the Christians; but his Wife, on the contrary, persecuted them with Fire and Sword. Divorces his Wife.This her Cruelty so displeas'd the King, that he divorc'd her from him, and took for his Consort a Princess of a mild and affable disposition, whose Daugh∣ter was Married to a Christian Prince call Sebastian. The King thus Wedded, was oftentimes admonish'd of the Christian Religion, which his Consort and Daughter embrac'd; to which he began now to hearken, and receiv'd Bap∣tism of Capriales;Is Christned Franciscus. and in Commemoration of Xaverius (who preach'd the Gos∣pel seventy years before in Usuquin) took the name of Franciscus. But he chang'd not only his Name, but also his manner of Life; for though he was not fifty years old,Resigns up his Kingdoms. yet he resign'd up all his Kingdoms and Dominions, and retir'd to the Territory of Fiungo, where on a pleasant Plain he resolv'd to build a New City, and to People the same with none but Christians, to the end they might there all together live after God's Laws and Ordinances. Travels to build a new City.The fourth of October, Anno 1578. he set Sail with his Fleet, the Pennons and Flags of white Damask, embroyder'd with red Crosses, spreading from their Masts and Yards. The Jesuits Capriales, Lodowick Almeida, and John the Ja∣panner, with a considerable number of Christians that were to inhabit the new-built City, were Shipp'd aboar'd. Upon his departure, Franciscus command∣ed his eldest Son, whom he appointed his Successor in all his Dominions, That he should no ways molest the Christians, but rather assist them in all things. His Son is kind to the Je∣suits.The New King promis'd to perform his Fathers Command faithfully, and indeed did more than he promis'd; for he pull'd down the Temple of the Idol Camis and Fotoques, and allow'd the Jesuits Means, giving them also a place
to build a stately Church in Usuquin, and crost the Bonzies in all their under∣takings, acting all things after the Christian manner. Against which re∣sisted many Princes in Bungo, being back'd by Riogozes King of Ximo, which were too hard for the young King, oftentimes loosing many Men in Skirmi∣shes: Cities and whole Dominions were taken from him, either by Riogoze's Forces, or mutinous Subjects; in short, it was so decree'd, that Jacatondono his Son should be Disinherited of all his Jurisdictions. Most of the Loyallest Sub∣jects Voted, that Jacatondono should Re-possess his former Authority,Why he is in great dan∣ger. to the end, that the Crown of Bungo which was near lost, might again by his Prudence be settled before it was quite Demolish'd. Mean while, Jacatondono, now call'd Franciscus, expecting daily that he should be forc'd out of his new Christian City in Fiunga, march'd Arm'd into the Fields; and his Necessity requiring Policy, he came forth, no less Prudent than Circumspect;Franciscus re-possesses his throne. four Councellors having by their ill advice order'd their Affairs badly, those he drove first out of the Countrey; then getting a considerable Army together, he march'd against Chicacuro, the head of the Rebels: Both Parties lay Encamp'd one over against the other; Franciscus inviting them dai∣ly to fight, by Embattelling his Men; but Chicacuro; who had no very good opinion of his People, would not hazard his Life in the hands of wavering Fortune; during which time, most of his Men quitted his Army,His Conquest. and went over to Franciscus Camp, insomuch, that all left him but eight hundred, which being slain, brought Peace and quietness to the Kingdom of Bungo. After which, the Conqueror went again to his new City Cuchimochi, but liv'd not long after to enjoy the advantages of his gotten Victory: For being upon his return from the Japan Emperor, he was taken with the Plague at Usuquin, of which many dy'd at that time; yet notwithstanding, though the Distemper threatned nothing but death, yet he was desirous to be carry'd to Cuchimochi, and being come within nine Miles of the place, his Sickness so increas'd, that he was necessitated to stay at Sucuma, where soon after he gave up the Ghost,Dies. Anno 1587. The Jesuit Laguna had the ordering of the Funeral-Solemnity, to which an incredible number of people came flocking from all parts of the ad∣jacent Countreys. The Corps was carry'd by four of the chiefest Peers;Is bury'd. on both sides went meaner Lords, carrying Banners with red Crosses; next follow'd the Queen and her Daughter, and then a great company of Noble-men clos'd up the whole Train. ¶ BUt besides the Province of Bungo, several others have embrac'd the Chri∣stian Religion, which happen'd thus: When Xaverius, Anno 1551. in No∣vember, travel'd from Japan to Goa, he took with him two Christian Japanners, Mattheus and Bernard, which were sent to salute his Holiness in Rome; But Mattheus dying at Goa, Bernard us proceeded in his Journey alone, and was the first of the Japanners that kiss'd his Holiness Feet: He in his return home-ward, dy'd at Conimbrica in Spain. Xaverius himself travel'd to China,Xaverius leaves the Je∣suits in Japan. there to Preach the Gospel, for the Japanners cry'd continually, that the Chineses, from whom the Japan Religion was Extracted, did not imbrace the Christian Faith. There stay'd behind in Japan, Cosmus Turrianus, and Joannes Fernandez; be∣sides two Japan Converts, being Paul of the Holy Belief, and Lawrence One-Eye; by whose extraordinary diligence, the Christian Religion was imbrac'd by many of the Commonalty (the Jesuits teaching them the Commandments, and the Gospel of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and the Holy Trinity) in Cangoxima,
Firando, Amangucium, and Bungo. Xaverius a little before his death, sent from Goa to Japan, Balthazar Gago, Edward Sylvius, and Peter Alcacova; after that went over thither, also Casper Vilela, Lodowick Almeida, Gonsalves Fernandes, Franciscus Capria∣lis, Lodowick Frojus, Joannes Baptista Montanus, Organtinus Brixiensis, Peter Diasius, Arias Blandonius, Arias Sanctius, Duartes a Sylva, Melchior Mugaez, Franciscus Perezi∣us, and others. These effected so much in few years, that Christianity began now to increase wonderfully, and as an effect of their Zeal, they built several Towns, Cloysters, and Churches, being every where highly respected, and much esteem'd: These successful Progresses gave hopes of a happy Event, espe∣cially, for that now Cosmus Turrianus, and Edward Sylvius, besides many Citizens in Amangucium, Converted two Bonzies of Meaco; and indeed, Christianity so prevail'd both in strength and number, that the Rusticks near Amangucium be∣gan to dispute with the Bonzi, of which, some falling short in the Arguments of their Religion, were forc'd to flie for shame. Not long after, Turrianus built a great Church in the City, intending there to perform in publick all Divine Services; Some of the Courtiers were by this time also become Proselites; and amongst the rest, the King's Treasurer Am∣brosius Eunadus Faisumius, who soon after Dying, was Inter'd in the following manner:Edvard. Sylv Epist Bungo 1555. Besides the Jesuit Edward Sylvius, above two hundred young Christi∣ans went to his Burial; a great Cross was carry'd before the Corps, and a considerable number of Torches round about, which turn'd the day into night, not without great admiration of the Inhabitants, by whom the Funeral Solemnities were perform'd quite contrary. Fasumius his Widow feasted the Poor four days together after the Funeral,A new Almshouse in Fu∣naco. distributing much Houshold-stuff, and many Clothes among them. Moreover, Turrianus built a double Alms∣house, or Hospital in the City Funaco; one side being for those that had the Le∣prosie, which came flocking thither from all parts of Japan (that Countrey being very subject to that distemper) the second partition was for other sickly Persons; over both these, Turrianus made a Japan Christian Master, one that was experienc'd in Physick. How the Japanners kept their Feasts.¶ THe Province of Amangucium, was beyond all other Dominions, full of Christians, because the King embrac'd that Faith, and promoted the same; the People upon Festival days, flock'd to the Temples in great num∣bers, where the Jesuits represented the Sufferings of our Savior, hanging a large Vane on the top of the Church, with a Crucifi'd Man in the middle; which done, all the lights were quite put out, and every one having stor'd themselves with Whips and Scourges, disrobed the upper part of their bodies, and Disciplin'd themselves so long, till the fiftieth Psalm was read out. On Palm-Sunday,Also Palm-Sunday. they distributed Consecrated Branches, and went in Procession, having a great Cross carry'd before them, locking the Church-doors round about; without stood a Jesuit, holding a Cross in his hands, saying aloud, Open, O ye Eternal Gates; whereupon those within answer'd, Who is the King of Honor? At last, walking two by two into the Temple towards the Altar, a Jesuit Cele∣brated Mass. At other times they walk'd about the Churches with Torches,Casp. Vilela Epist. Eirando 1557. when hiding a Man in a Grave, they plac'd two Arm'd Portuguese, and two Youths with Helmets on to Guard the same; then the Man arose out of the Grave, so representing the Resurrection of Christ. In the middle of the Church stood the great Altar, on both sides of it were built several Chappels, all hung with stately Pictures and
rich Tapistry, shewing the Crucifying on Golgotha, the Resurrection,Several representations in Japan, to establish the Ro∣man Religion. and As∣cention from Mount Olivet; round about the Walls were plac'd a great number of Wax-Candles; before the Altar, in the corner of the Chappel, hung a black Cloth, behind which stood a Jesuit, in the Habit of a Priest. Nine times they sung Kyrieeleyson; which done, the Cloth was suddenly drawn aside, and there appear'd on the Altar the Cross, and other Images, with many Ornaments, then also the Jesuit came in open view, whereupon the Bells Were rung; then their Singers, with Garlands about their Heads, and lighted Torches in their Hands follow'd the Host, who was carry'd through the Church under a rich Canopy. The Province and City Amangucium suffer many inconveniencies.This manner of Worship the Japanners were mightily taken withal, and chiefly in the Province Amangucium, where the Catholick Religion was no way less exercis'd, than in the middle of Spain or Italy; notwithstanding the City Amangucium had suffer'd much for it, being in the space of five years twice pull'd down to the ground, and was scarce Re-built, when Anno 1557. the Drossaert Mo∣ridono laid the whole City the third time in Ashes: the King with all the Chri∣stian Nobility and Souldiers, flying to a Castle five Leagues from Amangucium, was slain there with all his Retinue. ¶ IN other places the Jesuits enjoy'd themselves in Peace and quietness, and receiv'd yearly Revenues of the Lords of the Countreys, for the promo∣ting and teaching their Doctrine. In the Royal City Facuta,The Jesuits build several Churches in Japan. they had built a stately Church, and in Firando, one to the honor of the Virgin Mary, to which they got three more of the Bonzi which fled from thence. In Meaco they bought a large House, which they turn'd afterwards into a Church; in Cangoxima they nestled first of all. The King of Vocoajura proffer'd them a piece of ground, twenty Miles in circumference, where no heathen Japanners, but onely Christians were per∣mitted to live. Within the City Saccay Villela built also a stately Church; and another not altogether so costly, was erected in the City Ximabra: But those built by the Jesuits at Nangesaque, exceeded all the other in splendor and mag∣nificence. The Japan King of Omura becomes first a Christian.¶ AMongst the first of the Japan Kings that receiv'd Baptism, was Xumitan∣da King of Omura, whilest the poor and needy also imbrac'd the same Faith; because (that according to the Testimony of John Peter Maffeus) the Roman Priests taught them, that every one according to their Abilities, must assist the poor with Alms; this King at his Baptism took to him the Name of Bartholomew. It seems that the Jesuits brought this manner of changing of Names out of Europe to Japan, according to a Custom us'd amongst the Popes, who leave off their Christian-Name when they take upon them the Supreme Government of the Church.Changes his name. The first original of this exchanging of Names, Onuphrius and Cardinal Baronius, ascribe to Pope John the twelfth, but most to Sergius the se∣cond, who would be call'd so, when he was chosen Pope, Anno 844. upon the dislike of his own Name, which before was Bocca de Porco, as Platina, Stella,Bocca de Porco. or Swines∣snout. Suffrid. Epist. 1. Suffridus, and Aeneas Sylvius testifie. Civil Wars against Xumi∣tanda King of Omura.But Xumitanda soon found great opposition, for his relinquishing his old Hea∣thenism, for the Bonzies the prime Actors in this Plot, stirr'd up Gotondono, base Son of the Deceas'd King, against Xumitanda, pretending for a reason, that he
broke in pieces his Predecessors Image, which before his Conversion, he was wont to Perfume with Incense. By this seeming zealous Pretext, Gotondono soon got great Aid, for every one was much inrag'd, that the Old Religion should be banish'd from Omura, and a New one brought in by the Portuguese: Whereupon, the Rebels joyning in a Body together, set Omura on fire, and storm'd the Palace; but the King throwing a Tyger skin athwart his shoulders over a white Silk Suit, on which was Embroider'd the Name Jesus, with a Cross of Massy Gold on his Breast, and a Garland of Roses about his Neck, made his escape, both through the Enemy and Fire, to a Castle near the Sea-shore. But Gotondono pursu'd him closely, and getting several Ships from Goto and Firando, Besieg'd him both by Sea and Land. How he escap'd great danger.Xumitanda could not possibly have escap'd, had not his Father Xengandono, by a subtile Policy, made the Besieg'd fall at variance, and fight among them∣selves, for when he proffer'd the King of Arima's Daughter in Marriage to the chief of the Rebels, he immediately sided with Xumitanda; by which Conjun∣ction, being enabled, he Sally'd out, and slew the greater part of the Enemy; and from thence forward, for a considerable time he rul'd in Peace and quiet∣ness, till Isafay his Brother-in-Law made private Combination with the Lord of Firando, who sent a Fleet to Sea, whilst Isafay laid the City Omura in Ashes. Xumitanda at that time resided with a small Train,Obtains many victories. in a Castle scituate near the Sea: Thither Isafay march'd with all speed, and had undoubtedly slain the King, had not some unexpected Forces happily come to his assistance; with which he March'd to meet the Enemy, and after a sharp Conflict, utterly routed them: The Ships belonging to Firando, being separated by stress of Weather, were lost. The last that rose against Xumitanda, was Riogoses, King of Ximo, who also coming off with great loss, paid dearly for his Insurrection. But Xumitanda,Promotes the Jusuits. after having erected forty Churches or Chappels for the Jesuits, and banish'd Paganism from his Dominions, insomuch, that a little before his death, not one Heathen was to be found in the Province; Omura, according to the annual Observations, kept by the Jesuits in Japan, dy'd Anno 1587. Far less trouble did the King of Arima find, when besides those of Bungo and Omura he al∣so embrac'd the Christian Religion. Those were the three Kings, which Anno 1582. sent to his Holiness at Rome, the Ambassadors, Munico Ito, Michael Cinga, Julianus Nacaura, and Martinus Fara, as we have already related at large. The Japan Ambassadors which went to Rome, prov'd very beneficial to the Jesu∣its.¶ COncerning the return of these Japanners, Linschot saith thus: The Ja∣panners went to Sail from the Haven of Lisbon, in the Ship St. Philip, (which in its return home, was taken by the English Admiral Drake, and was the first Ship that was lost in the East-India Expedition; about which were several opinions at that time, because the Ship was by the King of Spain's Name) and whilst I was at Goa, they came thither Cloth'd in Cloth of Silver and Gold, in a most costly manner, after the Italian fashion, and were receiv'd with great joy by the Jesuits, who had finish'd that their great Design; to that purpose, Publishing a Book in Spanish, containing the Voy∣age and Travels of the Japanners, as well by Water as by Land, and their se∣veral Receptions by the European Princes. Going from Goa to Japan, they oc∣casion'd no small admiration in their Countreymen; the Jesuits desir'd this (as they pretended) for two several Reasons: First, To make the Japanners the willinger to embrace the Christian Faith, and also, that they might be
Eye-witnesses of the glorious and excellent Cities, which none could possi∣bly perswade them to believe: But indeed, the chief reason was to make their Order famous, and also to get a Mass of Treasure thereby; for they kept most of the Presents that were given to the Japan Princes for themselves, and they obtain'd likewise an Order from the Pope, and the King of Spain, that no Portugal, nor any other Christian, might settle in Japan without their License; so that the Jesuits turn'd out other Friers, keeping onely a few Priests and Portugal Artificers, without which they could not possible be. To others, of what Estate or Degree soever, their admission into the Coun∣trey was on this Proviso, That as soon as ever their business was finish'd, they should depart; but if they were minded to stay longer, they should buy that liberty for Money of the Jesuits, for they were most Eminent and Powerful in all places of Japan, where the Doctrine of Christ was Preached. They make the Japanners believe what they list; they are honor'd by them like gods and Saints: They also obtain'd leave of the Pope, that they might out of their Order chose a Bishop over Japan, notwithstanding it is against the Law of their Order; He that was sent to perform this Office, was coming from Por∣tugal, but dying by the way, another was Elected in his place; in short, the Jesuits endeavor to get all things here under their Command. Thus far Linschot. The manner how the Je∣suits spread the Christian Religion in Japan.¶ IT is also worthy our Observation, how the Jesuits spread the Catholick Religion over most part of Japan: Xaverius began first, telling them of the Creation of the World, and how God had Created all things, and that the Son of God, in the fulness of time, had taken upon him Mans Nature, and Dy'd on the Cross, was Bury'd, rose again, and Ascended up to Heaven, from whence he will come to Judge the Quick and the Dead. This Doctrine Translated out of Portugal in the Japan Tongue, Xaverius read the easier to the Japanners, because it was written in Portugal Characters. Cosmus Turianus, and Joannes Ferdinandez Preach'd most of the Miracles which Christ wrought, and taught the Auditors to make Crosses with the right-hand, and to begin at the Head, In the Name of the Father; and so Sign themselves down to the Breast, In the Name of the Son; and then from the left shoulder to the right, In the Name of the Holy Ghost: They also instructed them to Pray on Gar∣lands of Roses, telling them over knob by knob, and saying, Jesus Maria. A strange way how the Japanners became Chri∣stians.Paul of the Holy Belief us'd a Picture, representing the Image of the Virgin Mary, and the Child Jesus sitting in her Lap, which he held before the King Cangoxima, to the end, to make him loathe the Heathenish Idolatry. Other Jesuits shew'd them, that the Angel Michael was the Guardian over Japan, unfolding to them the occasions of Thunder and Lightning, gapings of the Sky, Rain-bows, Storms, Hail, Snow, and such like Meteors, grounded on Nature. ¶ THe Italian Joannes Baptista Montanus, relates in a Letter written from Bungo, Anno 1564. That when he set foot on Japan, being sent thi∣ther by Cosmus Turrianus to the King of Bungo, who had above a year and a half desir'd to have a Priest, he was courteously receiv'd by him; yet the King remain'd still amongst the Sect of the Bonzies,None taught the Japan∣ners better than the Jesuit Montanus. which deny'd the Mor∣tality of the Soul, but shew'd a great respect to all Christians. Moreover Mon∣tanus relates, what course he took in Converting the Japanners in Bungo:First, He contradicted with strong Arguments the Japan Religion, shewing them,
that it was impossible to attain Salvation thereby: When they understood this, then he told them, That one God had Created all things of nothing, and made Men according to his own Image, to govern all: But the wicked that run headlong and wilfully to the Devil, had no share therein; and that our Sins had brought Death upon us; and how Men were still inclin'd to wickedness, acting against the Laws of God and Man, nay, against God himself; and since our Sins provok'd so Omnipotent a God, they deserv'd Everlasting Punishment: But the second Person of the Holy Trinity had taken upon him Mans Nature in the Virgin Mary, to the end, he might in Mans Nature (which could onely suffer) die for our Sins a most cruel Death, and by reason of his God-head, prepar'd for us after this transitory Life, an Everlasting Being, where there is the fulness of all Joys. Then he explain'd them the Laws, Customs, and Mysteries of Baptism, and at last, answer'd the Bonzies to their several Contradictions, which they made against the Chri∣stian Religion. Trojus converts the Ja∣panners after a ridiculous manner.Trojus hung a Cross about the Necks of those that were Baptiz'd, giving eve∣ry one a string of Beads, and a Consecrated Piece of Wax, on one side the Name Jesus, surrounded with a Thorn Crown; on the other, the impression of three Spikes; a great Box full of those Wax-Meddals (in Rome call'd Agnus) Trojus brought with him from Goa to Japan; the value of which was esteem'd the grea∣ter, because the Pope himself had Consecrated them. An antient Woman in Tacata, after many intreaties getting one of those Meddals from Trojus, shew'd it to every one she met, insomuch, that the common report went, that a great piece of Sanctity being sent from Rome, was to be seen at Tacata; upon this news, whole Vessels with people came from Firando and the adjacent Coun∣tries, if possible, to get some of the same Meddals, or at least see them. Which Trojus observing, seem'd to be very bountiful, distributing above fifteen hun∣dred pieces of the Consecrated Wax amongst the people; at large declaring to them the Mysteries thereof. The Jesuits made Japan songs.Some of the Jesuits made Japan Songs, containing the Histories of the Old and New Testament. When on Christmas they kept holy the time of our Savi∣ours Nativity, and before Easter for his Suffering; then they sung to one ano∣ther all that the Prophets had foretold of the Birth and Sufferings of our Savior; then walking about, they carry'd under a Canopy a Picture, which they would have honor'd as Christ, being the true God and Man; before which walk'd a Jesuit clad in a Priests Habit, with a Garland of Roses about his head, singing in a Japan Tune and Language. Tell us Maria, what you mean't, And what you look'd at, as you went? To which an old Japanner striking on a Water-Cruse, answer'd in Rhime: My Lord they've taken from me, therefore I In piercing Sorrow, overwhelmed lie. Sometimes the Jesuits represented on Stages made in their Chappels,Acted Plays. the Transactions of the Old Testament: Then they Acted the Children of Israel's departure from Egypt, and Pharaoh's Destruction in the Red-Sea, in which they us'd many strange Arts, never heard of, or seen by the Japanners: Then they play'd Jonas his part, curiously representing the Sea, Waves, and Ship. Then
they amaz'd the beholders, shewing them the fall of Adam, Abraham's Offerings, Joseph's Flight, Samsou's Death, and the like Scripture-Histories. Vilela, in October and November, cover'd a stately Tomb with a black Cloth, Preaching over it, and describing the Day of Judgment, the tortures of Hell-Fire, and the happy condition of God's Children. Troj. Epist. 1565. Histor Conc. Erid. l. 5.Anno 1565. the Jesuits in Meaco and all the adjacent Countreys kept a Jubilee, first commanded by Pope Pius the fourth, to the end the Council of Trent might have happy success; though the Pope seem'd jealous of the Council, judging, as it appear'd by his advising with the Cardinal Moronus, that by such a Church-Congregation, no good was to be expected for the Popes Authority. Mean while, the year of Jubilee in Japan was Celebrated with all Solemnity, the people flocking from all parts of the Countrey to keep the same. A strange accident amongst the Japanners with San∣ctifi'd Corn, and Veronica's Cloth.Moreover, the Jesuits distributed Consecrated Water on the Sabbath, re∣porting every where, that they receiv'd Sanctifi'd Corn from Goa, and Veronica's Sweating-Cloth; for which cause, several people hired Vessels to carry them to Meaco, some that liv'd above seventy Leagues off came thither, and chiefly from Amangucium, and Facata, came great numbers; notwithstanding the Inha∣bitants at that time were much in trouble, both Cities being burnt down, and the people were busi'd in re-building their former Habitations. Those that de∣sir'd any Blessed or Sanctifi'd Corn, Fasted and Pray'd eight days before-hand; then applying themselves to some of the Portuguese (not daring to speak to the Jesuits themselves) to intercede for them, and procure some. Among others, was Bartholomew King of Omura, who also came for Sanctifi'd Corn, which he receiv'd of the bountiful Father Turrianus, who caus'd it to be laid in Gold for him, presenting him also with an Ave Mary, made of Sea-Horse Bones; both which the King hung about his Neck, not without imagining it to be highly Sanctifi'd by them. But the greatest care of the People, was to see Veronica's Handkerchief, in which the Icon of our Saviour Face was Imprinted. Jacob Frecensis,Aubert. Eiri. Ber. Relig. Annales 1249. a Coblers Son, but afterwards call'd Pope Urban the fourth, found Veronicas Cloth, when he manag'd the Laudanian Arch-Deaconship, giving it to the Cloyster of the Cistercian Monks, in the Bishoprick of Laudun, Anno 1249. where to this day it is constantly reverenc'd; yet notwithstanding, this went for the same Cloth in Japan, perhaps multiply'd by the same Miracle as our Sa∣viours Cross, whose pieces would make up a Ships load, and yet they affirm it to be the same Cross on which our Saviour dy'd in Golgotha, if you will be∣lieve all related thereof. Remarkable arguments by the Japanners against the Christian Religion.It is to be admir'd, that the Jesuits brought their design so forward in Japan, having so many grand Oppositions. It is very well known, that the Japanners are of a quick apprehension, and much given to Disputations, which the Jesu∣its found sufficient testimonies of, by their several contradictions: When Xa∣verius first Preach'd in Cangoxima, and amongst other things, terrifi'd them with Hell, where the deceas'd (had it not been for our Saviours suffering) are conti∣nually tormented in such a nature, that after the expiration of many ages, they have no hope of any deliverance, or ease of their Torments, because, that in the Flames they blaspheme God, and suffer everlasting Punishment for their sinning against an Omnipotent Judge: Whereupon the Japanners reply'd, say∣ing, Do you, O Xaverius, place our Parents and Predecessors, Children and nearest Relations in an unquenchable Fire? do those burn there, that recei∣ved their lives out of our Loins? do they die to live there for ever, and there live to be always dying, for whom if we had a thousand lives, would wish to
die as many times? are those which brought us into the world tormented by Diabolical Fiends, without any cessation? cannot God help them? how can it then be possible, that he is Omnipotent? or will he not help them? how is it then that he is merciful? and what enjoyment can Heaven be to us, if we should be transported thither through death, having so many Re∣lations, Children, Fathers and Mothers, who weep and roar continually for their insufferable torments? And what Reasons can there be given, that the merciful Creator should take delight in punishing everlastingly the poor Creature? Xaverius tells us, That he convinc'd and resolv'd them on all their Argu∣ments and Demands, but gives us no account with what Reasons he satisfi'd them; onely he relates, that he shed abundance of Tears when he spake of the damn'd condition of the deceased Japanners. Moreover, when Xaverius told them, That there was a beginning of all things: they immediately reply'd, That that beginning must be either good or evil, and did God create both good and bad at once? How can he be God, and confine all good in himself, and be the onely occasion of all good out of himself? If he be good, from whence are these bad Devils? Did God create them bad? where then is his abundant goodness? Or did he give over those to evil, which he could have kept from it? Was Man created to serve God in holiness? why doth he suffer the Devil to tempt him to wick∣edness? Why is Man left to himself, that cannot subsist without the Spirit of God? How can it also agree with Gods goodness, to create Men unable by their weakness, to be condemn'd for their sins, and by their damnation for ever miserable? And why are there such Laws ordain'd, that no Creature on Earth is able to perform, the least breach of which is eternal damnation? insomuch that upon necessity the whole Race of Mankind, by the power of that Law, must be cursed, he being born in sin. The Japan Religion was establish'd on better grounds of Gods Mercy, in that they had no everlasting Hell. The Worshippers and Servants of Amida, Xaca, Canon, and other Japan gods, exchanged by death their transitory Life for everlasting Salvation: and if it happen'd that after death they suffer'd some torments for their sins committed in this Life, that continu'd but a short time, according to the Crime. Arguments of those Ja∣panners that intended to be Christians.These were generally the controverted Questions which Xaverius was to answer: but after these arose a new stop in the way. The Japanners, who by this time gave some ear to the Jesuits, could no ways understand why God did make himself known to none but those Strangers which came thither from Portugal? they told them, That their Forefathers liv'd very retir'd; but those which for Theft, Adultery, Murder, or neglect of the Japan Religion, as it was taught them from time to time, could not be admonish'd in their Life∣times, must they according to the Japan Christian Faith be therefore tortur'd in everlasting Flames? who must bear the blame of that spoil? Had the Portu∣guese Preach'd the Gospel sooner in Japan, then they should have been sooner sav'd: O miserable Parents and Children, which died before the Jesuits came hither! A Letter of Fernandes conceining the Japan con∣tradictions.But the better to understand the daily oppositions and contradictions of the Japanners, we will give you some Extracts of a Letter, Written by Johannes Fer∣nandes, from Amangucium to Franciscus Xaverius, Anno 1551. wherein he says, That since the departure of Xaverius, the Japanners came daily slocking to the Jesuits
Houses, troubling them continually with several Questions; particularly they desir'd to know of what Materials God had made the Soul? as for the Body, they knew that the Earth, Fire, Water, and Air had joyn'd it together. Moreover, they demanded of what Shape and Colour the Soul was? What manner of Creatures the Devils were? Why they tempted Men to sin, and chiefly aim'd at his destruction? How they came to be so wicked, since God created all things good? They enquir'd what God was, and where? If he could not be seen? Why he had block'd up the way to Heaven with so many troubles, where good∣ness onely resides? The Bonzies curse the Jesuits.Mean while the Bonzies spent their time continually in their Temples and Cloysters, in railing against the Jesuits: They Preach'd publickly before the People, That the Christians were Cannibals, or Men-eaters; That the Devil had spoken from a Brazen Image, prognosticating that Amangucium should in a short time be utterly destroy'd for their wickedness, in embracing the Chri∣stian Religion. Not long after they say, that themselves saw in the Night a of Fire descending from Heaven on the Palace of Amangucium,Terrible Fire. which sud∣denly burning, made their foretelling true; for the City burnt eight days to∣gether, and then Murder and Cruelties spared neither young nor old, not so much as the poor Infants, which were Sucking at their Mothers Breasts. Those which sought not to escape by flight, died a most miserable death: whereupon the general Cry of the Bonzies was, That the unknown God of the Christians must be a most horrible Monster, by whose Religion, if it took foot∣ing in their Countrey, Japan would be utterly destroy'd. The Reason why the Ro∣man Religion went on so prosperously in Japan.Notwithstanding these grand oppositions, yet there is no Countrey, either West, North, or South, that hath been discover'd by Navigation, which hath taken so large an impression of the true Faith, as Japan: notwithstanding the Blood-Baths which were made there, the cruel Persecutions, the barbarousness of their Tortures, the meekness of the Sufferers, the infinite numbers of Miseries which happen'd in so short a time, that can scarcely be paralell'd by any other People in the World: for which cause we will relate the way by which the Christians in Japan went on so successfully. The first Reason why the Jesuits spoke for the Poor.The Jesuits soon after their arrival were much frequented by the poorer sort of People, which are very numerous in Japan, the Countrey being so exceeding populous, that they seem to undo one another, the Nobles living on the gain of their Subjects, who bring them in so much, that they scarce know their own Revenue, whilst the meaner sort undergo extreme Poverty; and the more, be∣cause Compassion is banish'd from the Countrey, and nothing less found there than Charity to the Poor, The Jesuits Preach'd against their hard-heartedness, teaching them, That the Christian Religion requir'd bountiful hearts towards the Poor, that Men should have compassion of one anothers miseries; he de∣serv'd to be forsaken in his misery, which will not act for his Neighbors re∣lief: what is it that can happen to one, but it may happen to another? who will forget a poor Man, that is himself subject to all frailties? This Doctrine the poor Japanners embraced the more willingly, because it pleaded for their po∣verty; but yet it took a deeper impression when the action it self follow'd: for when the Jesuits had gotten some of the Princes to embrace their Religion,Build Alms-houses. which allow'd them great Revenues, they immediately built Alms-houses, dividing them into two several Apartments; in one of which those that were infected with the Leprosie had their Lodgings, and in the other those that had other Sicknesses: great multitudes came flocking thither, and at the entring of the Alms-house received Baptism. Thus the Jesuits numbers increased dai∣ly
to their great Cost and Charge, none but poor and needy People coming to them out of necessity, were Baptized. The Letters may be seen wherein they make heavy complaints, that the Japan Christians consisted most in diseased and decrepid poor People, which were Converted onely to be Maintain'd by them.Bonzies are cruel to the Poor. And these came the more because the Bonzies never regarded them, neither bestowing Alms, nor taking care of their Burial, or to provide such things as their Religion requires after death, to the end they may live in joy and happi∣ness with their gods Amida and Xaca. But it is no marvel why the Bonzies neg∣lect the Poor, and bestow their labor for the Rich, when we consider their self-endedness; and therefore they are so carless, because they leave nothing behind them for the Bonzies. It was also very pleasing to the poor Japanners, when the Jesuits told them the way to heaven was much more troublesom for the Rich to pass than the Poor, and how that earthly Treasures were as Weights and Clogs to hold Mens Souls from getting into Heaven; and those that found not Riches in this World, should obtain and enjoy the more in the World to come. Covetousness of Prin∣ces the second Reason.Besides these winnings upon the Poor, Covetousness induced and won up∣on the Princes, whose Dominions border'd the Sea: for the Portuguese sending several Vessels richly Laden from Goa, Malacca, the Philippines, Macaw, and other Places, to Japan, great benefit did those Territories reap where these Ships came to an Anchor. The Kings of Bungo, Arima, Cangoxima, Amangucium, and Firando, had the most convenient Havens; and every one of these sought to be∣reave another, and ingross the Trade to themselves; which they could not do without the Jesuits: for who ever got them for their Friends, might command the Portuguese Vessels where they pleas'd, the Commanders not daring to Un∣lade but by their directions: for which cause the Jesuits always against the time of their Countrey-mens coming went to Sea, to meet with the Ships, so to order them to Anchor in such a Princes Haven, whose Favor they wanted for the promoting of the Catholick Belief. Lodowick Frojus relates,Epist. Eroj. Firand. 1564. That he was forbid to Preach in Firando, notwith∣standing the King seem'd to have some inclination to become a Convert. I will set down something which this Place requires, of Frojus his Letter. In the interim, says he, two Portuguese Vessels were seen to steer hither, whose Commanders durst not come into the Haven of Firando without my Orders and Licence, which the King observing, and instigated with the hopes of Profit, excus'd himself, that he had not Enter∣tain'd and Complemented me before that time; and withall earnestly entreated me, that I would not forbid the Portuguese from coming to an Anchor at Firando: for which Courtesie he would in few days give order for me to have the same Priviledge in Preaching as heretofore: Whereupon the Portuguese upon my permittance came into the Harbor, and to the King, asking him if he would fulfill his Promise, to let them at their own Charge re-build the Church which he had pull'd down? But the King endeavor'd by putting us off to gain time, and at last deceiv'd us. At this time the Ship call'd The Holy Cross ap∣pear'd on the Coast; I my self being at Sea discover'd her first, and going Aboard perswaded the Commander, Peter Almaida, to drop Anchor in the Road a League and a half from Firando: soon after Almaida himself came on Shore, and threatned the King, that he would depart with his Ship from thence, and Sail to some other Port, if he did not perform his Promises to me. The King desired some days to consider; but at last being fearful if he should delay the time any longer, that Almaida would weigh Anchor and go to another Port, which would be to his great damage, he granted me free leave to come again to Firan∣do, and re-build the Temple.
The like footing the Jesuits had in other Kingdoms; where they obtain'd liberty of the Princes to Preach, upon condition to cause the Portuguese Trade to be brought thither. This was the Reason for which the King of Cangoxima gave free leave to the Jesuits to instruct the Natives in Christianity, and to build Churches and Cloysters for the same purpose. But afterward being inform'd, that two Por∣tuguese Vessels were gone to Unlade in the Haven of Firando, he forbad the Je∣suits from any farther proceeding, he laying all the fault on them, they having the sole Command of the Ships, to cause them to Unlade in what Harbor they please. The third Reason why the Roman Religion met with such good success in Japan.Besides these two former, there is a third Reason why the Christian Faith took so soon footing in Japan, which was the ignorance of the Japanners in Natural Philosophy; for which cause they were much amazed when the Jesuits told them concerning the Weather, and all sorts of Meteors; How that the Fire which was either kindled in the Air, or Crevises of the Earth, made horrible Representations; That the Air, or Region under the Moon produced flying Sparks, flaming Torches, burning Lamps, and falling Stars; That in the Harvest-time, when the Earth is neither Frozen by extremity of Cold, nor dry'd up by excess of Heat, abundance of Vapors arise, which cause those Ignes fatui, or as the Vulgar call it, Jack with a Lantern.The Jesuits teach them Philosophy to their great admiration. They declared also the Generation and significations of Comets, that when they appear'd bloody, duskish, or bright, with a long Tail, they either signifi'd Drought, excess of Heat, Storms, Earthquakes, Famine, or Deluges. And likewise they decla∣red the occasion of Thunder and Lightning: whereof some being inclos'd in the Clouds, doth rattle and make a noise onely; other breaks forth, battering all that they meet with, or set it on fire; and that in the Night it Lightned more frequently than in the Day-time, and chiefly in the heat of Summer. They told them the reason of the appearing of Rain-bowes, whether they pro∣ceed from the Sun or Moon, and though commonly appearing after Rain, yet must be look'd upon as a Divine Token, that God will no more destroy the whole World in a general Deluge. Moreover, they shew'd the reason of the opening of the Skie, and Circles about the Moon; That white Clouds, and also red in the Evening, were signs of fair Weather, but in the Morning foreshew'd Storms, and abundance of Rain; That the Clouds, which were the Receptacles of Thunder, bred Rain; and besides Water, also sometimes sent down, to the admiration of Men, Milk, Blood, Frogs, Stones, and such like. They also taught, That Snow was a thin Cloud, which in the falling Freezeth into that Nature as it comes upon the Earth; That Hail detaining some warmth, is sooner subject to Cold; but the higher it Congeals and Freezes in the Air, the smaller it is, and the lower the bigger, and chiefly in the Summer-time, because of the great difference betwixt Cold and Heat. They inform'd them with the occasions of Dew, Mists, Fogs, and Ice; That a timely Thaw and Mizling Rain brought great Profit; That the Heat in Winter, remaining in the Caverns of the Earth, preserved all manner of Roots, and that the Dew in the Summer moistens the Ground, and nourishes the Plants; whereas otherwise the Sun would scorch the Grass and other Products, and untimely Frosts kill the early Buds. They also instructed them, That the Fountains and Rivers had their original from the Sea, and passing through the Caverns of the Earth, lost their saltness; unfolding to them also many My∣steries of the depths and shallowness of Waters, and the ebbing and flowing of
the Ocean. But especially they discoursed at large of Earthquakes, be∣cause they frequently infest Japan, sometimes shaking it like a Skiff toss'd by the Waves; at other times lifting it up and down, and swallowing whole Vil∣lages, Towns, Cities, nay, great Tracts of Land, leaving in their steads unfa∣thomable Pits; all which wrought strange effects in the Japanners. But they were much more concern'd, even to admiration, when the Jesuits told them be∣fore-hand the Moneth, Week, Day, Hour, and Minute, when the Sun or Moon would be Ecclypsed; the first by the Moons passing before the Sun; the second by the interposition of the Terrestrial Globe betwixt the Sun and Moon. Japanners are desirous of Learning.These Discourses concerning; Lightning, Thunder, Clouds, Rain, Hail, Fountains, Floods, and other natural Motions and Meteors, delighted the Ja∣panners the more, because they are much addicted to learn knowledge of Myste∣ries. Johannes Fernandes relates, That they came daily to his House, spending the time in asking all manner of Questions concerning God and his Divine Works. The fourth Reason may be known by the Bonzies.The fourth Reason of the happy and prosperous success of the Catholick Re∣ligion in Japan, may be drawn from the Bonzies, who not onely taught wicked and abominable Doctrine, but lead also very debauch'd and vicious Lives: What Lodowick Frojus writes in a Letter from Firando to the Indian Jesuits con∣cerning their abominable Religion,Their wicked Religion. may serve for a pattern: He tells us of a Gentlewoman that was ninety years old, who had paid her Devotions in seve∣ral of the Japan Temples, and bestow'd great Revenues upon some of them; this Bounty of hers was requited by the Bonzies with a Paper Coat, which they esteem'd very highly, for the Life of Amida was at large written therein; and it was accounted an extraordinary and peculiar favor to purchase such a Coat with a great sum of Money: for the Woman dying in the same, was im∣mediately transported to the happy Place of Amida's Residence, without suffer∣ing any pain to cleanse her from her former offences. But Johannes Fernandes being fetch'd to a sick Person, of kindred to the foremention'd Gentlewoman, discoursed with her, laying open the vainness of the Paper Coat; against which he us'd so many arguments, that she tore and burnt it. The other wickednesses of their Religion appears by murdering themselves to the honor of Amida,Their Cruelties. Xaca, and Canon. The Bonzies live very debauch'd.And no less abominable were the Lives of the Bonzies, whose Debauche∣ries, Drunkenness, Whoring, Murdering, and other outrages, were known to most People: nay, they accounted it no sin to Rob upon the High-ways, and go a Pyrating upon the Sea, oftentimes venturing to set upon whole Towns and Villages, burning the Houses to the ground, and putting the Inhabitants all to the Sword, not so much as sparing the poor Infants: for which their Cruelties the Emperor Nobunanga burnt their Cloysters; and as many as he could get of the Bonzies, caus'd them to be nail'd on Crosses, to die a lingring Death. This made the way clear for the Jesuits, who told them they were come above six thousand Leagues over the Sea to Japan, to no other end, but to teach them the right Road to Salvation. The fifth Reason is the alliance of the Japan Reli∣gion with the Catholick.At last the little difference which was between the Japan Religion and the Catholick, made an easie way for the Jesuits to settle it Xaverius relates, that the Bonzies themselves told the first Jesuits, That haply they might prevail among the common People, for that betwixt the two Re∣ligions was but small difference; yet then they declared onely the Doctrine of
the Trinity. But after they got greater footing, they perform'd all their Church-Ceremonies in publick, at which the Japanners much admir'd; and furthermore Preach'd the Roman Doctrine. And certainly there was a great resemblance of the Japan Religion to the other; according to which the Dayro in Meaco governs himself not much unlike the Pope at Rome. Moreover, the Japanners have an infinite number of Cloy∣sters, full of Priestesses, and Nuns, who punish themselves for their sins, and account Marriage unlawful in some of their religious Orders. They are per∣swaded, that the more largely they shew their Charity to the Cloysters, the soon∣er they shall go to Amida's happy dwelling; so that their Bounty in those par∣ticulars makes them equal in their future happiness: for the Heirs of the De∣ceased, with Gifts and Presents, beseech the Bonzies to deliver them by their means from their Pain. They all Read their Prayers by Beads. Concerning matters of Religion, none may Judge but the Dayro and a Cloyster. They ac∣count it great Piety in any to visit the Tombs or Shrines of the Japan Saints. These were the chiefest Reasons why the Catholick Faith went on so success∣fully in Japan; which nevertheless for divers causes before-mention'd met with such oppositions, that at this day there is scarce one Christian to be found in the Countrey. Nobunanga, Taicosama, and Daifusama, as we have already menti∣on'd, begun to persecute them; but being continually busi'd with Civil Wars amongst themselves, they found their hands so full, that their Cruelties gave some little intermissions. The first Persecution of the Christians.But when Conbosama took possession of the Imperial Throne, he feard none, since Fideri was burnt with the chiefest of the Nobility by his Father Daifusama. Thus suspecting no manner of Insurrection. Anno 1617, he began anew to raise Persecutions, endeavoring totally to subvert Christianity and utterly root out all its Professors, with the greatest torturing that could be thought on: there∣fore when to be nail'd on Crosses, and run through the Sides with two Lan∣ces, seem'd too easie a Death, and to be beheaded was far easier: Therefore he
resolv'd to make them feel a more painful and lingring Exit; and that he per∣form'd by roasting them to death in this manner:Christians are Roasted. First a great Post was dri∣ven into the Earth, placing several Pyles of Wood about it, and onely leaving a Gap or Passage open towards that Corner from whence the Wind blew, through which those that were to suffer pass'd to the Stake, to which they were bound by the Hands with a Rope of twelve Foot long; and about the same di∣stance the Wood lay about the Post, excepting onely where the Gap was left, to the end the Wind might blow away the Smoak, that the Martyrs might not suddenly be choaked up, and so die sooner and easier than those bloody Perse∣cutors desir'd, so that they were roasted by degrees, and died, if it were possible, a thousand Deaths in one, undergoing the miserablest torture that could be imagin'd.Burning of Men very an∣tient. This kind of burning of Mankind had a long time before been us'd in the World, but never in so cruel a method as in Japan. The Holy Scripture tells us of Juda, that he condemn'd his Daughter in Law to be burnt, because she had committed Adultery;Gen. 38.24. of which Moses saith thus, Bring Thamar forth and let her be burnt. The Rabbin Jews affirm, that Thamar was the Priest Mel∣chisedech's Daughter, and therefore for her Uncleanness was to be burnt by or∣der of the holy Law,Levit. 31.6. which saith, If a Priest's Daughter play the Whore, she polluteth her Father, therefore she shall be burnt with fire. But the Rabbin Jews are very igno∣rant in their reckoning of Time, in which they commonly make great mistakes, as taking Thamar to be Mechisedech's Daughter, not onely without testimony, but also against apparent truth: for there is above two hundred years diffe∣rence betwixt the Age of Melchisedech and Thamar. Anno 2490 after the Cre∣ation, Abraham and Melchisedech met one with another, and Judah committed Adultery with Thamar a hundred and ninety years after that meeting. Luther is of opinion that Judah perform'd the Office of a Priest amongst the Canaanites,Luthers opinion concern∣ing Thamars burning. and that a Daughter in Law was held to be as an own Daughter; and therefore Thamar was condemn'd to be burnt, being a Priest's Daughter. But most judge the chief reason of her condemnation to be for committing Adultery, being found with Child when she was promis'd to Shelah, Judah's third Son. According to the Laws of several People, all Adulterers were condemn'd to die; and chiefly the Roman Emperor, Opilius Macrinus, burnt all those alive that were accus'd of that Crime. The Antients worshipp'd Fire.¶ IT is worthy our labor to set down the great Reverence the Antients shew'd to the Element of Fire. When the Royal Consort and Daughter of Julianus the Emperor appear'd in State, they always had holy Fire carry'd be∣fore them. The Roman Emperors also themselves ever follow'd such a Fire: which Custom they learn'd of the Persian Mace-bearers. The Romans, when any Marriages were solemniz'd, made the Bride and Bridegroom touch Fire and Water, which they set on an Altar. Nimrod, by some call'd Ninus, the first of the Assyrian Monarchs, commanded Fire to be worshipp'd as a god, in Ur, a City in Babylon, so call'd from that kind of religious Worship. Hieron. Quaest. in Genesis.St. Jerome relates, and besides him the Rabbins, Salomon Jarchy, and Moses Ger∣vedensis, That Abraham was condemn'd to be burnt, because he would not worship the Fire in Ur, according to the Chaldeans example, and when he stood in the midst of the Flame, Divine Providence preserving him, he fled to Canaan. But St. Jerome looks upon the Story as not authentick, but one of the Jews Fables. Persians worshipp'd Fire.The Persians also (according to the testimony of Julius Firmicus, Maximus
Tyrius, Hilarius, and Isidorus, fell down daily on their Knees, worshipping Fire as an Image of God. Concerning whom also the famous Historiogra∣pher Socrates relates a strange Story, That Maruthas, Bishop of Mesopotamia,Socrat. Hist. 7. c. 81. be∣ing dispatch'd from Constantinople to Isdigerdes, King of Persia, got exceedingly into his Favor, for his great Holiness and obliging Carriage; which the chief of the Persians could no ways digest, but look'd upon with great envy. Isdiger∣des us'd daily in his Chappel to worship Fire; under which they digg'd a Cave, and privately hiding a Man in it, order'd him to call to the King as he was kneeling before the Fire, telling him, That he would certainly lose his King∣dom if he shew'd favor to the Christian Bishop. This voyce Isdigerdes took as an Oracle, and thereupon resolv'd to put away Maruthas, notwithstanding he had cur'd him of an intolerable pain in his Head: But Maruthas discovering the Cheat to the King, soon after obtain'd free priviledge for the Christians in Persia. Ammianus Marcellinus farther adds,Ammian. Mart. l. 23. That they reported the Fire was faln from Heaven, preserv'd on everlasting Hearths. Strabo the Greek Geographer averrs,Strabo l. 15. That the Cappadocians built several Tem∣ples for their consecrated Fires; in which about the middle they erected an Altar, and set the Fire upon it. Rabbi Benj. in Jouthasins.Rabbi Benjamin, in his famous Hebrew Book of Travels, on which several Learned Men have Commented, says, That he Sail'd from Haanlam, now call'd Zeilan, to the Asiatick Isles Chenerag, inhabited by such Idolaters as were call'd Dug-Bijim; where he found their Priests to be the greatest Sorcerers in the World. The Greeks and Romans worshipp'd Fire.But these were not all, for the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, also worship∣ped Fire: Amongst the Greeks the chiefest were the famous and Learned Hip∣pasus the Metapontine, and Heraclitus the Ephesian: wherefore the greatest Offer∣ings were not sacrificed without Fire by the Heathens. Lastly, the Vestal Virgins in Rome, and the like in Greece at Delphos and Athens, as its Priestesses, tended the Everlasting Fire. The Northern Tartars, and also the Lituanians, worshipp'd Fire for a Deity; and Alexander Gaguinus affirms, That the Lituanians,Alex. Gaguin. de prise. Lituan. Relig. till they embraced the Chri∣stian Religion in Anno 1230. continu'd the same sort of Worship. The Chaldeans, Medians, and Assyrians, offer'd Sacrifice to Fire, presaging by the Flames thereof future Events. Those Priests that belong'd to the Temple of Diana Echatana, whose care it was to look after the consecrated Fire, were not permitted to have any con∣versation with Women. The antient Britains worshipp'd Minerva, their Temple being famous for an unquenchable Fire, that wasted not into Ashes but into Stones. Corps, by whom and why burnt.¶ THe Massagetes, and also Thales, one of the Learnedst among the Gre∣cians, maintain'd, that the Custom, formerly us'd in most Parts of the known World, which was to burn dead Corps, was to be esteem'd wick∣ed, because the Fire, being the greatest of the gods, was corrupted by dead Bodies. But others maintain'd the contrary, holding it best to cleanse and purifie the Body by the Flame, that so it might neither rot, nor occasion any noisomness or stench: which Opinion was held by most of the Eastern People, as also amongst the Germans, Spaniards, Gauls, and Britains.Plin. l. 8 c.  But this Custom of burning the Dead was a long time after entertain'd by the Romans: for which Pliny gives this Reason, because their Enemies would oftentimes dig
the dead Bones out of the Graves, carrying them away as Trophies; which to prevent, they follow'd that fashion of the Germans and Indians: but whether that were the true reason or no, sure we are, that the first among them re∣corded to be burnt, was the Consul Sylla, which he himself commanded, fear∣ing to be serv'd in like manner as he had done to his Competitor Marius, whom he digg'd up out of his Grave. After the Romans had once throughly entertain'd this Custom,Pli. l. 12. c 18. none were equal to them, for the magnificent preparations of Funeral Pyles, furnishing the same with the sweetest Perfumes, for which they bestowed great sums of Money. The Emperor Nero, according to the foremention'd Pliny, burnt more Per∣fume with the dead Corps of his Empress Poppea, than all Arabia Felix could produce in one year. When Germanicus's Lady travell'd with the Ashes of her burnt Husband through Calabria, Apulia, and Campania, to Rome, the Inhabitants of those Places through which they pass'd, came to meet them all Cloth'd in Black, and the Nobility in Purple, every one burning, according to their abilities, all manner of Perfumes,Tacit. 3. Aunal. and other sweet Scents, such as Tacitus says are commonly thrown on the Funeral Pyles. But the Heathens burnt not onely their Dead, but their Living also, for cer∣tain Crimes. The Egyptians stuck the Body of one that had murder'd his Father, full of sharp Canes, then cutting him in many places, they at last threw him on a great heap of Thorns, which being set on fire consum'd him. Other Nations have condemn'd less Offenders to be burnt, partly because that punishment is exceeding painful, and partly by the Fire to cleanse them from their offences. The Murders of the Em∣peror in Fissima.¶ AS soon as Conbosama, after the decease of his Father, possess'd the Impe∣rial Throne, he began his Reign, as we in part mention'd with ex∣ceeding Tyranny: for travelling through Fissima, he commanded the Gover∣nor Ingandono to cause all Christians, Men, Women, and Children, to be roasted to death. During the Civil Wars, since the Dayro lost his sole and unlimited Autho∣rity, every King in his own Realm play'd the Master. And seeing they endea∣vor'd, as we said before, to bereave one another of the Profit which the Portu∣guese Vessels brought them, seeking to invite them to their Harbors, they were forc'd to keep fair correspondence with the Jesuits, they having the sole Com∣mand of the Trade and Vessels, and so accordingly to grant them free leave to Preach the Catholick Doctrine. But after Daifusama became Conqueror in many Battels, reducing the whole Countrey of Japan under his subjection, the Kings Authorities and Power were all limited; so that they all depended on the Emperor, and were strictly com∣manded for no sinister ends to permit the Christians to teach their Belief. Being thus order'd, all of them were forc'd to obey, making great search for the Roman Priests, of which he took at last Peter ab Ascensione a Franciscan, Johannes Baptista Machada a Jesuit, Alphonso Navarre a Dominican, and Ferdinand a Santo Jo∣sepho an Augustine, and caus'd them all to be beheaded in Omura. Why the Christians were burnt.But this way of Execution seeming too mild (the Christans in the least not dreading it,) the Japanners began to destroy them with Fire; the preparatory
solemnities whereof they perform'd after this manner: The day before,How the Japanners are us'd to proclaim it the day before they burn the Chri∣stians. a Waggon was drawn through the City by two Oxen, in whose fore-part stands a Copper Bar, neatly Turn'd, and made fast in the bottom; at the top of the Bar hangs a great Copper Bason, by them call'd Gom, near which stands a Servant with a Mace of Iron, with which at the end of every Street he strikes on the Bason, at the noise whereof all the People come running out of their Houses, and when a great multitude have assembled, after silence pro∣claim'd, a Cryer that Rides before the Oxen on Horseback begins to Read out of an Edict. Each House near the Place where the Execution is to be, must procure a certain quantity of Wood, either more or less, according to the number of those that are to be burnt: This done, the care to see it perform'd is left to the Master-Warden, who is to answer for it if any thing be wanting. Behind him that stands knocking on the Bason sits one of the Emperors Ser∣vants, and also a Tradesman on a Carpet spread all over the Waggon; the first holds a scollop'd Flag, on whose top hang two Tassels; the other holds a long Cane, at the end of it hangs a bunch of Grapes made of Brass, whereto is ty'd a String full of Knots; the Waggon guarded on each side with a Fyle of Pike-men and Musqueteers, and the like Guard marching before and behind; at the end of every Street they all stand still, where the Cryer tells them aloud what every House is to do. Afterwards, at the Place of Execution, as many Posts are driven into the Ground as there are Persons to die, and great heaps of Wood are laid almost round about; at last, at the appointed time the Pri∣soners are brought, and the Fire kindled, where (as we have already related) by the distant Fire they were lingringly roasted, so dying a long and most mi∣serable death. Why the Japanners throw the Ashes of the burnt Christians into the Sea.When Peter de Zuniga an Augustine, and Lodowick Flores a Dominican, born at Antwerp, were to be burnt in Nangesaque, besides twelve others that were be∣headed, there came in the Night several Portuguese, who had cut from the half∣roasted Bodies of Zuniga and Flores, great pieces of Flesh, which they preserv'd
as holy Reliques, insomuch that the next day little or nothing was to be seen of either of their Corps: This being very ill resented by the Governor of Nangesaque, to prevent the same another time, on the next Moneth, being Au∣gust, Anno 1622. when they had condemn'd Carolus Spinola the Jesuit, and Fran∣ciscus de Morales the Dominican, Hyacinthus Orfanel, and Alphonso de Mena, caus'd their Bodies to be thrown into a deep Pit full of Wood, there burning them to Ashes, which being rak'd together, was carry'd a good distance from the Shore, and there scatter'd abroad into the Sea by the Wind, to the end there might no∣thing of them remain. But besides the foremention'd Jesuit and Dominican, others were also burnt at the same time, amongst which was a Brusseller, who coming within the Pyles of Wood would not be ty'd with one Hand to the Post, but falling down on his Knees held fast about the bottom of it, and so died; others which stood upright, scorch'd and burnt by degrees, till at last they died through excess of most intolerable pain. Hyacinthus Orfanel stood most in the Wind, and was least hurt by the Flame,rsanel was sixteen hours  burning. so that he was full sixteen hours miserably tormented before he gave up the Ghost. Two of the Company were ty'd out of the Wind, which made the Flames strike so vehemently upon the Posts, that the Ropes burnt with which they were ty'd, by which means they got loose and fled through the burning heaps of Wood, desiring that they might apostatize from the Christian Religion: But Xuquendaino sitting on a costly Carpet, sur∣rounded by Japan Nobles and Souldiers to see the Execution perform'd by or∣der of Goneocu, Governor of Nangesaque, commanded those that fled to be dri∣ven back, and push'd into the Fire, with Pikes and Staves, judging it was not out of zeal that they would embrace the Japan Religion, but because they could not endure the pain of the Fire; so that it was then too late for them to consider that which they might have done before. After this Camilius de Constanzo the Jesuit was in like manner burnt neat Firan∣do, and Paulas Navarrus in the City Ximabara. Horrible Persecutions in Jedo.¶ AMongst other Persecutions, that was very terrible which happen'd at Jedo, Anno 1623. Cornelius Hazart in his Church History, and the Letter from Japan to Mutius Vetelesius, Governor of the Jesuits at Rome, differ much in Relation of this unhappy Accident. The Letter deserving more credit than Hazart,How it happen'd. gives this account: Daifusama caus'd a Noble-man, call'd Fara Mondo∣no, to have his Toes and Fingers to be cut off, and to be burnt in the Fore∣head, because he inclin'd to the Christian Religion; but being receiv'd into Favor, and restor'd to his former Dignity by the Emperor Conbosama, who was his near Relation, he left not to practise in private the same Religion: But be∣ing betray'd by his Servant to Jenoquidi Cambioie, Governor of Jedo, was by the Emperors command condemn'd. Soon after, by means of tortur'd Christians, were discover'd the Jesuits Hiero∣nimus ab Angelis, and Franciscus Galves a younger Brother. The Life of Hieronymus b Angelis.¶ AB Angelis Sailing with Carolus Spinola to the East-Indies, was necessitated by a fault of their Vessel, to fall upon Brasile, and immediately after to Sail back to Portugal: in which his Voyage homewards he was taken by the English; but making his escape from them, not long after, coming again to Lisbon, he Sail'd again for India, and at last came to the Empire of China, where he stay'd a considerable time, and then went to Japan; where being chief Go∣vernor
of the Jesuits Residence in Fissima; he stay'd some years in that City: then travelling to Surunga, where the Emperor at that time kept his Court, pur∣posely to erect a Temple: he laid his Design so cunningly, that he taught the Roman Religion in private there: and having also order'd all things accord∣ing to his hearts desire, when within Jedo he was about buying of a House to make a Temple of, he was discover'd, and forc'd to fly to Surunga, and imme∣diately after to Nangesaque. But when, Anno 1614. a considerable number of Christi∣ans were banish'd from Meaco and Osacca, to the cold Countrey Sangaer, in the Northermost part of Japan, by command of the Emperor Daifusama, Ab Angelis travell'd thither, and at last back again to Jedo; where he undertook again his former Design, to buy a large House, in which he might perform Divine Ser∣vice: But being busie about these his intentions, he was sought for by Cam∣bioie's Life-guard; of which having notice, he privately made his escape, and the Soldiers out of Revenge raged against those where he Lodged; which co∣ming to his knowledge griev'd him exceedingly, that for his sake they should come to any inconveniency, who had receiv'd and Lodged him in their House: whereupon he travell'd thither, and went to Cambioie, accompanied with Simon Jempo a Japanner, who had spent his youthful days amongst the Bonzies; but em∣bracing the Christian Religion, Serv'd the Jesuit for a Dogico, that is, A Clerk. Ab Angelis told the Governor, that he was a Priest sent from Sicily to Japan, there to Preach the Roman Doctrine. Galves makes his escape, but is taken again.The younger Brother Francis Galves, being inform'd that he was discover'd, fled to Camacura, a Mile beyond Jedo, where he thought to escape but was overtaken. Mean while forty seven Christians were taken in Jedo; which were all condemn'd by Conbosama, with Ab Angelis, Galves and Jempo to be burnt: the fourth of December, Anno. 1629. their Sentence was put in execution. The Executioners put strong Cords about the Necks of the Condemned, and ty'd their Hands behind their Backs: Ab Angelis Rid on a Horse, with a Letter on his Breast, on which his Name was written in great Characters; behind him came Jempo and fifteen others on foot: Franciscus Galves and Fara Mondono were also bound on Horses, every one follow'd by a train of Martyrs.Fara Mondono, the Ne∣phew, condemn'd to be burnt. But before Fara Mondono Rid a Cryer, or Herauld, who when the Drummer left off beating on the Copper Bason, Read out of an Edict these words: The whole World might apparently behold and guess, how much the Emperor Conbosama abhorr'd the Christian Religion, condemning his own Nephew to be consum'd by Fire, because he had embraced it. Not far from Jedo towards Cami, stood fifteen Stakes, three of which were some∣what nearer to the City than the other, all surrounded with great heaps of Wood, about one Fathom and a half from the Posts. The Soldiers, though they surrounded the place of Execution, to keep off the multitude of Specta∣tors, which were innumerable, yet could not hinder their sight, the Stakes be∣ing all driven in a plain Field, near which lay a high Mountain, that swarm'd with People: and several of the chief Nobles had built Scaffolds in the hanging of the Hill, to have the clearer view of the Execution, in this manner perfor∣med: First they made fast seven and forty of them,Fifty Romans burnt near Jedo. tying their Hands to the tops of the several Stakes, and their Feet to the bottom; their Names were Leo Taqueua Gonfiqui, Fanzabusus Quaxia, Chesaiemon, Simon Jempo, Peter Xixabucus, Johannes Matagaremon, Michael Quizaiemon, Laurentius Cacuzaiemon, Laurentius Gagi∣qui, Matthias Juraiemon, Matthias Quisaiem, Thomas Jofacu, Peter Santarius, Peter Saiemon, Matthias Xigigemon, Ignatius Chorimon, Simon Muam, Decius Joccuno, Isaacus, Bona Ventura, Quidairi, Johannes Xinocuro, Hilarius Mongazaiemon, Franciscus Quisaie∣mon,
Saximononia Jinxiquir, Johannes Chosaiemon, Romanus Goniemon, Emanuel Buye∣mon, Peter Quicheiemon, Quisaburus, Peter Choiemon, Andreas Disuque, Raphael Quichaie∣mon, Quizequi, Anthony, and thirteen others, whose Names are not express'd in the foremention'd Japan Letter. Ab Angelis, Galves, and Mondono, saw their Com∣panions burnt first.Whilst the Fire flam'd round about, and the Martyrs made a doleful and terrible noise, Fara Mondono, Ab Angelis, and Galves sat still on their Horses, to the end they might first behold the miserable conditions of those that suffer'd. And when Fara Mondono was first ty'd to the Stake, and next Ab Angelis, and at last Galves, there were some of the former that yet struggled betwixt life and death. But Hazart relates farther, That two Noble-men being amongst the other Spectators, lighted from their Horses, and crowding through the People, Watch, and Pyles of Wood, one ran to Galves, the other to Ab Angelis, and holding them about their Necks, suffer'd themselves to be burnt with them. But of this I have no great testimony, onely the foremention'd Japan Letter mentions two Women, who when they saw the forty seven miserably roasting, they forthwith went to the Judges, and declared themselves openly to be Chri∣stians, whereupon they were immediately carry'd to Execution. Farther Cruelties in Jedo.But these Cruelties ceased not thus, for Maria Jageia, Mother of Leo Gonfiqui, who was burnt among the last, had Lodged Ab Angelis in her House: for which cause she with thirty six more that had entertain'd Christians, or Let them Hou∣ses, or were their Security for the Rent (amongst which were also Heathen Japanners) were condemn'd to the Fire.Unheard-of wickedness committed upon Children. Nay, it rag'd after a most unheard-of barbarity against Children; for leading them with the sound of Instruments to the Place of Execution; they were before their Parents Eyes either be∣headed, or split in the middle, or cut in small Pieces, and with all other imaginable Tortures put to death. An Edict against the Ro∣mans.Immediately after it was proclaim'd in Jedo, and other adjacent Countreys, That if any one could give information of a Christian, or him that entertain'd them, or Let them Houses, should have for a Reward, the Mansion of him that Let it, besides thirty Pieces of Gold worth fifteen hundred Crowns. Upon this, Murdering began to spread it self as Wild-fire all over Japan. Are slain at Scondai.In the City Xenxai, Didacus Cervalio the Jesuit, with sixty Christians, were dis∣cover'd in Myne-diggers Apparel, all which were put to death in Scondai, in the cold Winter Nights, putting them to Freeze up in the Water. At Omura.In Omura, Peter Vasques the Dominican, the Franciscan Lodowick Sasandra, and Sotello, and one Michael Carvalho a Jesuit, were condemn'd to be Frozen to death in like manner. At Arima.In Arima, Vincentius Caun, a Native of Corea, fell into the hands of the Perse∣cutors, who broke his Fingers with Iron Pincers, setting him up to the Throat in cold Water, and at last burnt him. At Farina.At Farima the Christians were onely banish'd. At Fingo.In Fingo, Michael Maxima was miserably Scourg'd with Rods, and hoised up to a high Post,The Strappado. and so on a sudden let fall to the Ground; that done, cold Wa∣ter, mix'd with blood, was pour'd down his Throat, which they made him disgorge by trampling on his Belly, then laid they him in the heat of the Sun, and at last carry'd him to the boyling sulphureous Waters at Singok, and so long wash'd therein, that he gave up the Ghost. At Tiroxima.In Tiroxima dy'd on Crosses, and by the Sword, Joyama, Sintaro, Xobara, Schi∣zaimon, and others.
In the Province Figen the greatest Persecutor of the Christians was Nobexima Cami, who was one of the Spectators at Jedo, when Conbosama burnt fifty Chri∣stians. Persecution in NangesaqueIn Nangesaque they also sometimes burnt a Portuguese and a Japanner, for Re∣ligion: but the Governor Gonrocou seem'd not to delight so much in Murder as other Commanders, who aim'd by their Cruelties to exceed each other; he being most commonly troubled with a Distemper, that would scarce let him rest either Night or Day: So that he regarded the Christians but little; being also very intent in desiring his Nobles to let him resign up his Authority. Kauwaytsdo is made Go∣vernor of Nangesaque.This at last was granted him, and Kauwaytsdo sent by the Emperor to suc∣ceed, not without great trouble and amazement to the City Nangesaque, and especially to the Christians; because Kauwaytsdo was a stern and high-spirited Person; and the rather, because heretofore Nangesaque had always been Go∣vern'd by ordinary Merchants, who by the Command of the Emperor had their Residence there, to the end they might buy all things necessary that the Imperial Court requir'd. Whereas the Japan Nobles are so exceeding proud and high-minded, that they look upon all Tradesmen as Dogs; which made every one stand in fear of Kauwaytsdo the New Governor. Begins instantly to mur∣der the Christians.Anno 1626. in June, he came to keep his Court at Nangesaque. The second day after his arrival, he commanded fifty three Stakes to be drove into the Ground, and according to the custom, to place Piles of Wood round about them. The next day after were led thither the Japan Bishop Franciscus Parquero, Balthazar de Torres, who had lain a whole Year hid in a Cave under the Floor of a House; Baptista Sola, Overseer of the Jesuits Cloyster at Arima; besides five Japanners, which had lodg'd the Priests; and as many Portuguese, namely, Albemen Josse, and his Son of fourteen Years old, Diego de Costa, Johan de Costa, and Balthazar de Solse, the last two being Pilots. The Portuguese became Apo∣states, embracing the Heathen Religion; but the rest remain'd constant. After that, five Men and three Women more were burnt, because they had also en∣tertain'd the Priests in their Houses: One of the Women saw first her Child of six years old Beheaded. Finds out a cunning way to make them apostatize from the Christian Faith.But Kauwaytsdo found more Work in this his Murder, than he expected; for he saw, that he must destroy at least a thousand more, before he could root the Christian Religion out of Nangesaque: Therefore he bethought himself of another way. Forcing the Christians to declare by Oath what they were worth, and what Moneys they had out, either in the Hands of Portuguese, Ja∣panners, Chineses, or their own Servants, whether upon Interest, or otherwise; all which he kept, and seiz'd upon for his own use. Besides thus depriving them of their Estates, he threatned them also with intolerable Tortures, and a horrible Death, if they continu'd to persist in the Romish Belief: But if they would Apostatize, they should reap great Benefit: Which indeed those that did, immediately receiv'd; for Kauwaytsdo gave them the Houses and Estates of those that were burnt, and also forc'd the Chineses, which come yearly with above sixty Vessels to an Anchor before Nangesaque, to Lodge in their Houses, for which they should pay them Ten in the Hundred of whatever Commodi∣ties they sold; by which means many poor People on a sudden rais'd them∣selves to considerable Estates. Moreover, the Portuguese Merchants might nei∣ther lodge with the Christians, nor drive any Trade with them. Many embrace the Japan Doctrine again.In October, Kauwaytsdo commanded all those that had Apostatiz'd from Christi∣anity, to come before him; who being all cloth'd in rich Habies, made above
fifteen hundred. He speaking to them very courteously, promis'd to shew them more and greater Favors. Cruelty us'd in Mongy.¶ MEan while the heat of Persecution in several Places increas'd. A Mile from Nangesaque stands a Village nam'd Mongy, belonging to Bonge∣mendo Governor of Arima, where seven Men and five Women were put to death: Being brought before the Executioners, they were first Stigmatiz'd with hot Irons in the Foreheads, and immediately after demanded, If they would renounce the Christian Religion? Which refusing, they were again burnt on both Cheeks: But still remaining constant, they were stripp'd of their Ap∣parel, and their Legs and Arms stretch'd abroad, with great Scourges so out∣ragiously beaten, that they lay a considerable time for dead: Then being ask'd anew, If they would not change their Opinions; which they deny'd, with detestations of the Japan Idolatries; whereupon the Executioners began their Tortures afresh, burning their Privities, and other tender parts of the Body, with glowing Irons, and cutting off their Fingers and Toes. It seems a matter worthy no small admiration, that a Child of six Years old, being amongst these twelve Martyrs, endur'd all the foremention'd Tortures with inexpressible Courage. Thus punish'd, they were cast into Prison. Mean while the number of the discover'd Christians amounted to one and forty, which all patiently endur'd the foremention'd Afflictions; insomuch that at last the Executioners seem'd to be more wearied and tir'd than the Sufferers; of which seventeen, having large and heavy Stones ty'd about their Middles, were carry'd a good distance into the Offin, and there thrown over-board; amongst which number, was a Man and his Wife, and three Children, the one seventeen, the other thirteen, and the youngest six years old; who being terrifi'd with such strange Preparations, began to cry when the Executioners laid hold of him to tye the Stones about his Waste; whereupon they asking the Parents if they would have the Child to live, and they replying No, it was drown'd with the rest. Japan Children very hardy, enduring the great∣est Tortures.¶ IT is very common in Japan, to put to death or destroy Children for their Parents Offences: Yet the Parents have an unlimited Power over their Children, of either Life or Death, and it is at their choice to let them live, or cause them to suffer with them. But there was scarce a Japan Child, that went not willingly to encounter Death, and endur'd their Tortures with exceeding Courage. In the City Usacca two Youths, the one ten, and the other five years old, voluntarily died with their Father Alexius Morifoibioye; and a Sister, being an Infant of four days old, was Decollated. On the Island Necaie a whole No∣ble Family were all condemn'd to the Slaughter, amongst which, several Children. Japanners have little knowledge of the Christian Religion.These Examples manifest sufficiently, that the Japanners are not only of No∣ble Hearts, but constant Resolutions, enduring the greatest Tortures in their Infancy with inexpressible Valour, for a Religion, the first beginning whereof they scarce understood: For besides reading the Pater Noster, Ave Maria, and some Prayers to the Saints, they have little or no knowledge of either the Old or New Testament: Therefore we may judge the Japan Martyrs to be very Zea∣lous and Constant. Far more holy were the Sufferings of these Infants, if they had understood
the Grounds of the Christian Faith, than the Child which Romanus (being tor∣tur'd in Antioch by Asclepiades) call'd from amongst the Multitude of Specta∣tors, Anno 304. The Story in brief this. Asclepiades told the Martyr Romanus, That he believ'd in a Christ that was nail'd on the damn'd Cross: Whereupon Romanus answer'd, That he was ready to contradict such Blasphemy, did not Christ forbid him to strow Pearls before Swine. Mean while Asclepiades had a desire to understand of a Child, Whether the Heathen Gods, begotten and born according to the course of Nature, famous for their Lusts, Adultery, and other Debaucheries, were to be worshipp'd; or whether that Honor belong'd to the Savior: To which end, Asclepiades commanded a Child before him from amongst the Mul∣titude, asking him his Opinion concerning the Gods; who gave him so ex∣cellent an Answer, by rendring an Account of the whole Christian Faith, that he being displeas'd thereat, persecuted him with all imaginable Tortures. Af∣ter having most miserably whipp'd the poor Child, he caus'd him to be Be∣headed before his Mothers eyes,Unusual death of a Chri∣stian Child. Psal. 116. v. 15. who sung whilst the Executioner prepar'd the Ax to perform the cruel Office, the words of the Psalmist, Precious in the sight of the Lord is the Death of his Saints. The Japan Children died with more Holiness under the Hands of their Exe∣cutioners, if they had understood Gods Word in the Old and New Testament; than the Waldensian Youths, of which the Sorbonne Doctors at Paris gave Infor∣mation to Lewis the Twelfth, King of France, That they had lately receiv'd no better Instructions concerning Religion, than they had heard from the Wal∣densian Youths. A strange way how the Japanners harden their Children to be constant in the Christian Belief.Now the Japanners harden their Children against a cruel Death, not with instructing them in the Gospel, but by terrifying them with unusual Cruelties, which Hazart witnesseth, relating, That Johannes Catouneme, a Nobleman in the Kingdom of Deva, had a Son aged seven years, whom he daily instructed to be constant. I will set down Hazart's own Words concerning it. A little before Ca∣touneme was taken Prisoner, he said to his Son, If it were so that you saw the Execu∣tioners coming, would you suffer your self to be burnt alive, or deny your Faith? Whereupon the Child ask'd, Father, what would you do? To which he reply'd, I would suffer my self to be burn'd: Whereon the Youth again made answer, So will I too. Then said his Father, Come hither, I am resolv'd to try if you will be so constant as you say: Take and hold this Coal in your hand, till I command you to throw it away. The Child immediately opening his Hand, the Father laid a glow∣ing Coal in the same: The Youth held it fast, without shewing any concern thereat, not∣withstanding his Hand was burnt to the Bone, yet he threw it not away till his Father gave order. When they ask'd him, If the Fire had not hurt him; he made answer, Any one that is ready to burn alive, as I am, must not make any scruple to hold a burning Coal in their Hand, for so short a time as I have done. And who can find more of the Aged Japanners,Ignorance of the Japan-Christians. in any Observation kept by the Jesuits themselves, that they either said or did more, whilst they were under the Exe∣cutioners Hands, than to hold a Crucifix, and the Picture of the Virgin Mary, repeating the usual Prayer, Jesus, Maria. Horrible Tortures with the boyling Waters of Sin∣gok.¶ BUt besides their burning them by degrees, the Japanners us'd also the Waters of Singok, that is to say, Hell. These Waters being Sulphure∣ous and hot, flow from the Foot of an exceeding steep Mountain, with such force and noise, that it strikes terror and amazement to the Beholder. It rush∣es forth between the Rocks, and sends its noysom and choaking Vapors up to the Sky.
Hither several of the Christians were brought from Arima, and their naked Bodies wash'd over with this boyling Water; and when notwithstanding the Torture, they refus'd to deny their own Religion, and embrace the Japan Ido∣latry, they were carried bound to the top of the Mountain, and thrown down from thence into the scalding Stream. A Priest is a great help o the Japan-Christians in heir Sufferings.In Nangesaque the Governor Kauwaytsdo, since his return from Jedo, proceed∣ed unmercifully in his Persecutions, especially against the Priests. Amongst others that were condemn'd to the Fire, was also a Japan Priest, Thomas Soyse, by whom was found a Catalogue of some thousands of Christians, Which liv'd very privately about Nangesaque, Ombra, and Arima, who not long after fell in∣to great Miseries. Kauwaytsdo himself stood amaz'd to see so great a number of them, as would make no end of murdering; and the Multitude which he was to con∣demn to death, exceeded his Commission which he had from the Emperor: So that he thought on a new way, There were already, according to the Catalogue found by Soyse, a great number condemn'd; amongst which were two ancient Persons, which in the time of the former Emperors had been Governors of Nangesaque, and in great esteem at Court, for their Quality, Riches, and Nobility. These Kauwaytsdo sent with a Train of eleven of his nearest Relations, and Brothers-in-law, to the Imperial Court at Jedo.Cruel Persecution of them. The remaining Numbers he drove out into the Mountains near Nangesaque, and plac'd a Guard round about them, that the Banish'd might neither come into the City, Villages, nor any Houses, to beg for Provisions: Neither would he suffer them to build themselves Huts, nor make any other Shelter, to keep them from the Heat of the Sun, Rain, or other Weather; so that at last most of them perish'd for want. Their Houses are nail'd up.In Nangesaque their Windows and Doors were nail'd up; so that they and their whole Families were starv'd to death, if not reliev'd by their Neighbors; which though it was straightly forbidden, yet some found ways to give them Sustenance through private Holes.None may employ them. None durst imploy any Tradesman that was of the Christian Religion; nor carry any one to Sea, unless he became an Apostate, and believ'd in the Japan Doctrine. Many seeing themselves in that necessity,Many Apostatize. forsook their new-gotten Religion, and embrac'd the old; as also divers of those which were in the Mountains, whose Bodies were misera∣bly swoln by Heat, Cold, Rain, Wind, Trouble, and Hunger, and continually tormented by the Cries and Lamentations of their Wives and Children, for∣sook at last the Doctrine Preach'd to them by the Christian Priests; yet some re∣main'd constant their very last. Forty two Japan Nobles are banish'd.Soon after Kauwaytsdo took five Persons of Quality, with their Wives and Children, who (being strangely preserv'd, whilst their Lord Fideri the Law∣ful Heir of the Japan Crown was burnt, as we have before declar'd) had em∣brac'd the Catholique Religion; which being known, they were Shipp'd aboard a Portuguese Galley that sail'd for Macaw, with a Proviso, That they should im∣mediately depart for Goa. If the Portuguese did not perform that Command, they should lose both Life and Goods, if ever after they hapned to Anchor in any Japan Harbor. The banish'd Japanners, with their Wives, Children, and Retinue, amounted to thirty two; of which in few Weeks none remain'd but one old Woman. It is easie to be judg'd, that they dispatch'd them by Poyson, that so the Portuguese might rid themselves of such troublesom Companions, and likewise obtain thanks from the Japan Governors, who were fearful to
condemn the foremention'd Persons, either for their high Extract, or their great Relations. ¶ WHilst the Portuguese were thus busied, Kauwaytsdo, according to his Custom, went to Jedo to the Court; during whose absence, those that were driven into the Mountain had some liberty, and were permitted pri∣vately to come into Nangesaque, to visit their Friends, and lodge in their Straw Houses. But at the return of Kauwaytsdo to Nangesaque, the Banish'd, being three hundred eighty four that remain'd constant, were sent to Arima,Horrible Cruelties us'd against the Japan-Christi∣ans. where they were most inhumanely us'd; their Bodies wash'd with scalding Water, stigmatiz'd with red hot Irons, beaten with sharp Canes or Reeds, at Noon∣day set naked in the Sun, at Night in the Cold, and also in Tubs full of Ser∣pents; Children destroy'd after a horrible manner, before the Parents Eyes: and when some were almost ready to give up the ghost, by reason of their endless Tortures, Physicians were provided to revive them again, to the end they might afresh feel their Cruelties. These kind of Afflictions some endur'd thirty, forty, nay sixty days, before they would Apostatize. Amongst all the rest, five remain'd still constant, whose Flesh being putrifi'd and rotten, stunk, though living, like Carrion; and being thus miserably tir'd out by their fesh Tortures, they at last fell down dead under the Executioners Hands. The Emperor Conbosama dies.¶ THe foremention'd Blood-baths had their beginning in the Emperor Conbosama's Reign; after whose Decease, Anno 1631. his Son Toxogun∣sama succeeded, not without too apparent Testimony of inveterate malice to the Christians; for soon after he began to Persecute them. In Nangesaque he plac'd a new Governor call'd Onemendonne, whom the Em∣peror Conbosama had long us'd as Judge and Overseer of the Japan Empire, to the end he might be very vigilant, to see that no Insurrections should happen any where. Onemendonne, being a stern, fierce, and cruel Man,Onemendonne Governor of Nangesaque tyrannizes much. was sent to Govern in Kauwaytsdo's Place, who notwithstanding his inhumane Cruelties, yet seem'd mild, and of too good a Nature, to destroy all the Christians at once; which he thought to be easier, because Kauwaytsdo deliver'd him a Cata∣logue, in which were written not onely their Names, but also their Dwelling places. The common report was, That Onemondonne came marching on with seven hundred Japan Soldiers; but it prov'd to be scarce four hundred, amongst which were several Noblemen with their Attendants, which at Night lodg'd without Nangesaque, and in the Day-time came and attended at Court. Onemendonne at his coming set up several Posts in the City, piling,Erects Burning-posts. according to the Japan manner, great Heaps of Wood about them. None knowing cer∣tainly for whom it was done, some judg'd it to be for the Governor Moor, Hieronimus Masleda, and four Portuguese, which a considerable time before had been Condemn'd: Others thought, that those Japanners which had entertain'd any Priests, should be burnt; for such was their Malice, that not onely those that lodg'd a Priest under their Roof, keeping them in private, were put to death; but also the two next Neighbors, notwithstanding they were Heathens, assuredly known to be so, and perchance ignorant of the Entertainment. But though Onemendonne drove so many Stakes up and down in the City, yet nothing else follow'd, than that the thirty Noblemen, with some Soldiers,
made strict search in all the Streets of Nangesaque for the Roman Priests;Strict Watch in Nange∣saque. which was the easilier perform'd, because Nangesaque is divided into eighty eight Streets, which in the Night are all lock'd up with Gates. Every Street having its peculiar Name, hath also an Overseer, or Master-warden, under whom are those whose Business it is to look and watch over five Houses, and in the Morning to give an Account to the Master of that Ward, what hath pass'd in those Houses, who afterwards returns those Accounts to the Chief Overseer of the City, who Governs all things, except the Matters which are brought before him are of such grand Concern, that he dares not take them upon him; then the Prime Governor decides them. Onemendonne caus'd strong Watches to be set all about the City Nangesaque, both by Land and Water; the Gates of the Streets to be lock'd up early, and not open'd till day-light. How they search'd for the Christians.After that, the Soldiers ran up and down from Street to Street, breaking into the Houses wherein the Christians (according to the Catalogue written by Kauwaytsdo,How treated. and deliver'd to Onemendonne) dwelt, asking them, If they had not yet forsworn: If they said Yes, the Soldiers noted them down; if No, they perswaded them to Apostatize; which refusing, they were commanded to ap∣pear before the Governor, who without hearing them plead, lock'd them in a large Store-house built of Stone: First the Master of the House was secur'd, whilst his Wife, Children, and the rest of the Family were instructed; who when they would not deviate from the Christian Religion, they were also sent to Prison, an Account being taken of all their Goods, and their Windows and Doors nail'd up, and seal'd. Inhumane Tortures done with the Water of Singok.Onemondonne having gotten a considerable number together, sent them to the boyling Water at Singok. At this place several great Pieces of Timber lie at the foot of the Rock, reaching over the Water, on which small Huts were built, the Floors whereof were bor'd full of holes, and the Roofs cover'd with Grass, Turf, and other Materials. In these Hovels he lock'd them in the Nights: By each man was plac'd a Sentinel, whose Business was to take care and see, that if any by reason of the Sulphurous smell which arose from the under running Water, should fall into a swoon, or be in danger of suffocati∣on, they should be taken out of their Houses, the rest remaining still within. In the day time the Executioners us'd small Dishes, with which taking up Wa∣ter out of Singok, they pour'd over their naked Bodies, onely preserving their Heads, fearing that else they might die sooner than the Torturers would have them: For the Water, by reason of its corroding quality, eats through Skin and Flesh, to the Bones. There are several other boyling Springs and Rivers; but none so venomous as this at Singok. The Reasons of the Hot Watters are sought after.The Learned have spent much Labor and Time to find out the Reasons of these boyling Springs. Some are of Opinion, That a Fire under Ground heats and causes the Water to boyl, as if a Pot hung over a Flame: But that Opi∣nion is not grounded on Reason; for it is the nature of Fire, being inclos'd in Caves under Ground, to break forth with great rage, if it hath the least vent. Here also it is to be observ'd, That the Fire dries up the Water, or the Water extinguishes the Fire, so soon as the one gets the Mastery of the other: So that without contradiction, the force of the Fire must either dry up the flowing Waters, and consume the Earth underneath to Ashes; or else the Water, which has pass'd through it so many Ages, must needs have quench'd the Fire. For who will believe that Water and Fire are of one force and pow∣er under Ground, and so agreeable in Nature, that the one should not extin∣guish the other.
Moreover, where is there any scalding Waters, by burning Sulphurous pla∣ces? yet if it be any where it must be there: The Italians reckon little less the fifty boyling Waters, but not one of them by which any fire hath been found. The Mountains Vesuvius, Aetna, Hecla, and others, which continually belch out hideous Smokes into the Air, and sometimes horrible Flames, yet produce no manner of hot moysture. The best reason of the hotness of the waters.But the wisest Philosophers judge the occasion of the heat in Sulphurous Wa∣ters, to proceed from the swift motion with which it pours down from steep descents into the Crevises of the Earth, and so still running forwards, that it becomes hotter and hotter; for experience learns us, that a quick motion occasions heat. This reason seems to our stupid judgments to be nearest the truth, yet we must herein acknowledge a great ignorance, and a Bridle for our understanding, which seems to be wanting, and stops as amaz'd at such mysteries. Who can disclose the reason, why the Fountain near Matilga, a City of the Garamantes, hath from Noon to Midnight Water boyling hot, which from Mid∣night to Noon is as cold as Ice? as Augustin, Isidorus, and Pliny witness: why the Fountain Consecrated to Jupiter Hammon, as Diodorus, Salinus, Amianus, Lucre∣tius,Plin. lib. Hist. 5. cap. 5. Wonders of waters. and Pliny, thus relate, changeth also hot and cold: of which Ovid saith, Horn'd Hamon's Water, in the Morning hot, And at the Evening, boyling like a Pot, Yet from what reason, to the Learn'd unknown Grows Chill, like Snow, and cold as Ice at Noon. Who will dive with his judgement into the Mysteries which the Territories of Epirus manifest by a strange Fountain, which not onely lights a Torch when held to it, but also puts out one that is lighted? What man will find out the reason, that a Lake in a Jewish Plantation (if Isidorus deserves to be credited) drys up,Sabbatical River. or rather stands still every Sabbath day? And why the Fountain of the Hill Anthracius, when it overflows, signifies Plenty, and by its scarcity of Water, (as is to be seen by Pliny) foretels Famine? Those that are tortur'd with Singoks water Apo∣statize.¶ BUt to return to those miserable Wretches at Singok, who when they be∣gan to pant for Breath, by reason of their unsufferable Pain, were deli∣ver'd up to Chirurgeons to prolong their Lives, to enable them to more suffer∣ings; for so soon as they recover'd any strength, they were sure again to be brought to Singok: They spent most part of August in this cruel Persecution, insomuch, that all those which resolv'd to be constant, became Apostates, ex∣cept one Youth, who scarce had attain'd the eighteenth year of his age, was the onely person that dy'd under the hands of the merciless Torturers. Horrible cruelties infli∣cted on the Japan women.The Women generally suffer'd more than the Men, for besides dropping Singoks Water upon them, they drove the Maids stark naked along the Streets, forcing them to creep on their Hands and Feet, and causing them to be pub∣lickly ravish'd: The Widows they stripp'd of their Clothes, provoking their Sons to commit Adultery with them; some Women they held fast by their arms and legs under Stone-Horses; so committing all the outrages of Sodom; they forc'd the Children to pour Singoks Water on their Parents, and the Pa∣rents on the Children standing close together betwixt Stakes drove round about
them; some of the Women suffer'd no less by shame, than other by torture, their Privities being stuft full of Flax and Hemp, with which also they ty'd up the young Mens Members; and the Daughters were forc'd to set fire of the heaps of Wood which were to consume their Fathers. Several hundreds went in companies, ranging up and down in the Woods, all Stigmatiz'd on their Fore-heads, every one being commanded on pain of death not to give them any sustenance. Tortures with water.In several places near the Sea-side, many Inclosures were erected, in which they lock'd up whole Families, which at low Water sate dry, but at the time of Flood, above half way in the Salt-Water; these having leave to eat and drink,Of Children with their Parents. liv'd generally twelve or thirteen days: Moreover, the Parents were hoodwink'd, whilst their Children which were miserably tortur'd night and day, cry'd, Fathers and Mothers take pity of us, forsake the Christian Religion, it is im∣possible to endure these cruel Torments; which doleful cry took such deep impressi∣on into some of their hearts, that for meer grief they dy'd. Several had their Nails par'd off,Inhumane cruelties. others had their Arms and Legs boar'd thorow with Drill-Irons, which occasion'd great pain; also they fill'd some of their Bellies with Water, which they pour'd into them through a Tunnel; then being laid on their backs on the ground, the Executioners stamp'd upon them so vehemently, that they made them disgorge the same through their Mouths, Noses, and Ears. After these kind of Cruelties, they us'd another more barbarous, placing the Martyrs on a Bench, bending their Arms across on their breasts; they made their bodies fast behind to a Post, and then drove betwixt the Nails of their Hands and Feet sharp Spikes; which tortures they renew'd five, six, or more days together: Moreover, they plac'd some Women in a large Coope full of Snakes and Serpents, which crept into their Privities, eating up their Bowels. Hanging them up by the legs, an intollerable pain for the Japanners.But amongst all the tortures, the most cruel was hanging them by their Legs on a Gallows, with their Heads down in a Well, over which a Gibbet was plac'd, and at the end thereof, a Block was made fast, through which a Rope was drawn, and ty'd to the Legs of the sufferer, who being thus ty'd, was let down with his Head into the Well, so low, that his Feet appear'd just on the top thereof; In the Heads of those that hung, several Wounds were cut cross-wise, to the end, the bloud might by degrees drop out, and not over∣whelm their hearts; some liv'd five, six, nay more days, before they gave up the Ghost. Francis Caron relates, That he spake with those that had hung three days in that horrible manner, but at last forswore the Roman Religion, not being able to endure this pain, which exceeded Fire, and all other imaginable cruelties; their Bowels sinking down into their Throats, seem'd to force all their intrails out of their Mouths, the Blood also dropping out at their Eyes, Mouths, Noses and Ears. The first that was kill'd after this manner.The first that was thus Martyr'd, if Hazart deserves to be credited, was a Japanner, one Nicholas Kean Fucananga, who dy'd in the Well, on the fourth day, being the last of June,And the next. Anno 1633. After that, several others were put to death in the same manner; as Emmanuel Borges, Joseph Reomuy, Ignatius Kindo, Antonius Giannonius, Joannes Kidera, Joannes Zama, Benedictus Fernandez, Paulus Saito, Joannes de Acosta, Julianus Nacaura, Antonius de Souza, and Sebastian Viera; of which, some were Italians, and Portuguese, but most of them Japanners; of whom, some hung
three, others six, seven, nay, nine days before they gave up the Ghost: Nacaura being carry'd to the Well, cry'd aloud, That he had kiss'd his Holiness (Pope Gregory the thirteenth) his Feet in Rome, being sent thither by the Kings of Bun∣go, Arima, and Omura, Anno 1582. Most of the Japanners Apostate.¶ THis Persecution brought those that remain'd constant to a miserable end, and the faint-hearted to Apostacy; insomuch, that in sixteen years time, scarce one was to be found of four hundred thousand. How they Apostate.Roger Gusbrechtzoon, an eye-witness, relates, That Anno 1626. there were in Nangesaque above forty thousand Christians, of which in three years time, not one was to be seen, for most of them had sign'd it with their own bloud, taken from their little finger, to shew and perform due Worship to their gods, Amida and Xaca. The Apostates are in danger of their lives.Mean while, an account was kept of all Apostates, and those that sav'd their lives by betraying of Christians, against which a private plot was laid, to de∣stroy them all at once, just like the French in the Island of Scicily, who when the Evening Bell rang for our Savior's Resurrection, Anno 1282. were Murder'd in such a rage, that the Scicilian Women big with Child by French-men, were all slain. ¶ TOxogunsama having by this time sufficiently extinguish'd Christianity in Japan, sent a special Edict against the Portuguese Traders in Macaco, in which (it being Sign'd by the Camy's, which as much to say, as Councel∣lors of State, Cangano, Sanuquino, Voudino, Cambuno, Runo, Bungane, and Teuxumano) Anno 1639. He forbad strictly, that no Shipping should come from Macaco to Japan, and if they should offer against his Command to come thither,The Japan Emperor ba∣nishes the Portuguese. their Ships should be broke up, and the Seamen punish'd with death, because that the Portugese sent privately Priests over thither to teach the Catholick Religion; so making the Subjects to rise up against the Emperor, as two years before, seventy thousand Christians were in Arms near Arima, between the Hills, and in a well fortifi'd Valley; but being so rudely entertain'd, most of them dy'd by the Sword. Macaco sends an Embas∣sy to the Japan Emperor.¶ IN the interim, the Inhabitants of Macaco were much concern'd, seeing that profitable Trade of Japan was forbidden them; and therefore they thought it convenient, to send an Embassy thither, to inform the Emperor, that the Portuguese never sent any Priests thither, nor that they had the least knowledge of the Insurrection at Arima. The Ambassadors, Lovis Paez Pacheco, Roderigo Sanches de Paredes, Simon Vaz de Paiva, and Gonsaho Monteiro de Carvalho, spent a whole years time in their Preparation. In the middle of Summer, Anno 1640. they set Sail with sixty nine Officers, coming in the Haven they were fetch'd in by the Governor Babasuro Zayemon, their Guns immediately ta∣ken out of the Ships, and a Guard set to look after their Seamen. The Emperor condemns the Ambassadors and their retinue to be beheaded.Immediately, Zayemon sent word thereof to the Emperor, who sent two Persons of great Quality, accompany'd with as many Executioners, as there were Portuguese come from Macaco to Nangesaque. The Princes, Canga Chuminim∣bu and Novaga Manximbioye sent for the Portugal Ambassadors, asking them, Who made them so bold to Land in Japan, contrary to the Emperors Commands? Where∣unto they answer'd, That the Emperors Edict onely forbade the Trade; their Ship brought no Merchandise thither, but were onely come on an Embassy, to Treat with the Em∣peror concerning his Prohibiting of their Trade. The two Japan Princes gave no re∣ply
to their answer, but read the Sentence which Toxogunsama had pronounc'd against the Portuguese. Contents of the Procla∣mation.The Contents were, That since the spreading of the Christian Religion in Japan, (apparently contrary to the Emperors Edicts,) Wickedness, and Debauchery was grown to a great height in that Empire, therefore necessity forc'd them to execute great Punishments upon them, and at last to give a stop to all private Dealings with the Portuguese, on For∣feiture of his Majesties high Displeasure; Those, that notwithstanding his Commands, ven∣tur'd to come to Japan, where to this day, many Priests were privately kept, whose design was nothing else, but to stir up the People against their Just and Lawful Governors, to turn the Empire into a Blood-Bath, and bring it under the Subjection of a Foreign Tyrant: And though the Portugal Ambassdors inform'd them in Person, that they neither sent, or kept any Priests in Japan, yet the Macaco Letters make no mention thereof, therefore what was said, they dis-own'd, and suspected them not without great reasons; and for that cause, the Emperor Prosecutes such Malefactors that offend his Authority, Condemning them all to the Sword, except some of the meanest Seamen which were spared alive, to the end, they might give an account of this Adventure to the Portuguese in Macaco; and also that those should expect the same that durst hereafter adventure to Anchor in any Ja∣pan Haven. The Edict being read, and Translated out of the Japan Tongue into Por∣tuguese, the Condemned were carry'd on a Hill near Nangesaque, being in all sixty one Persons,Sixty one beheaded at once. some Portuguese, Castilians, Chineses, Bengaloisians, Cafrians, Mali∣ans, extracted from the Islands Solor and Simor, Malabaer, Achenen, Lanannen, and Macassacren, which were Beheaded by sixty one Executioners: Their Bodies were bury'd betwixt four Walls; the Crime for which they dy'd, was Engra∣ven on the Wall; twelve were sav'd alive, which Sail'd to Macaco, being com∣manded to carry the news thither, that if the Spanish King Philip, nay, the Chri∣stian God himself should Land in Japan, they should bow their Necks under an Executioners Sword. Their tormenting with Ropes, after what manner.¶ BUt besides the foremention'd inhumane Cruelties, every Persecutor in∣vented still newer and newer ways of tortures; sometimes making fast four Ropes near the four corners of the Fire, tying the Christians in the mid∣dle, so hoisting and retching their Bodies with the Ropes, pulling them up a great height, then on a sudden let the Cords go at once, that the Tortur'd fell with great force to the ground, which in a manner bereav'd them of Life; whereupon, the Executioners ran to them with all speed, pouring Cordial Li∣quors into their Throats, by which means they reviv'd again; but no sooner did these miserable Wretches breath, but they were afresh afflicted. With Canes fill'd with sulphur.At other times they fill'd hollow Canes with Sulphur, and other strong burning Ingredients, shutting their Mouths close together, and putting one end of the Reed or Cane into their Nostril, and set the other a fire, which made not onely the skin come off from their Faces, but scorch'd their Heads inwardly:With sharp Reeds, lighted Torches, and Scourges. They also cut their flesh with sharp Reeds or Flags, tearing the Wound open to the Bone; then burning the body with lighted Torches, inso∣much, that the Skin shriveling together, hung like Lappets: Others were stript stark Naked, and ty'd by their Arms and Legs, cruelly beaten with Japan Canes. Cruelties against the Mo∣thers.Mothers of young Children suffer'd above all others, for the Executioners with great violence struck their Childrens Faces against theirs; and the more the Children cry'd, the more the Mothers were tortur'd: To others they ap∣ply'd
green Flags, which making very hot, they laid them on their naked Bo∣dies, till all their Skin from Head to Foot was burn'd black; they also put glowing Coals into their Hands, which if they threw away, should be a sign of their denying the Christian Religion, according to the Verdict given by the Japan Judges.And Children. The Children had their Flesh torn from their Bones with hot Pincers, and their Ears and Noses cut off. In Ximabara, Bungodono kept fifty Christians Prisoners, which in a disgraceful manner, were led through the Streets of the City to a Plain near the Sea-side; against seven of them he was very severe, namely, Thomas Chibioius, Paul Nagata, Leonardus Sacuzaiemon, Joannes Gonzaiemon, Jenixus Dines, Maria, and Clara, Nagata's Wife, because they had been instruments to the spreading of Christianity; there∣fore, in the foremention'd Field were digg'd seven Pits, three Fathom deep and six wide, at an equal distance one from the other, in each of them stood a thick Post, with a piece of Timber nail'd on the top thereof, like a Cross: the Condemned sate down whilst their Arms being stretch'd out,A cursed way of Executi∣on. were made fast to the cross piece, their Necks were lock'd betwixt two thick Planks made hollow in the middle, so that their Heads appear'd immoveable above them: Bungodono was one of those that perform'd this Office; first Sacuzaiemon's right Arm was leisurely Saw'd off; then they began to file the Necks of those that were made fast with sharp tooth Canes, strowing Salt into the Wounds; five days they continu'd their filing, without unbinding them, or letting them have the least rest. The Executioners releasing one another, the Physicians were al∣so ready, which thorow small Tunnels pour'd Cordial Liquors down their Throats, to the end they might be the longer dying. The remaining three and forty, stood the first and second day as Spectators, but on the third and fourth, they were ty'd Hand and Feet, and plac'd on a sharp piece of Wood, with a great Stone in their Laps, close by the Martyrs. Against the Evening, they were carry'd through the City to their Prison, the Japanners shouting and hallowing at them, when any chanc'd to fall from their sharp piece of Wood. In the Jayl, their Tortures began with lighted Torches, pieces of sharp Canes drove betwixt their Nails, Pails full of Water pour'd thorow Tunnels into their Bellies, and trampling On their Bellies to make them disgorge it; but in a short time, all the forty three became Apostates,The tortur'd Apostatize. except Michael Xozaburo, a Youth of Conga. The seven also which were near Ximabara remain'd not constant, for on the first day, five forsook their Bap∣tism, and on the last night Nagata also deny'd the same; onely Thomas Chibioius endur'd all their Tortures full seven days; when on the last of May, Anno 1630. the Executioners being tired with their bloody work, Saw'd off his Head. The others were let loose out of the Pits, but Nagata, Sacuzaiemon and Gonzaie∣mon, though they had renounc'd, yet by order of Bungodono were slain. Clara dy'd soon after those Tortures which she had endur'd, by the excessive pain, being so bereav'd of sence, she never came to her self again; and Gonzaiemon repenting of his Apostacy, had his Head cut off by a Woodden Saw,Some recal the renoun∣cing of their Religion. and cut thorow in the middle with a Scymiter. Horrid Prison in Japan.¶ NOt far from the City Tomioca, in the Island Xiquo, the Governor Tobioio had erected in a Field a large Prison, with several Apartments for Men, Women, and Children; but so little, that every Prisoner was forc'd to sit on his Knees, not being able to rise up, nor stir himself the one way nor the other; the Walls and Roof being stuck full of sharp Canes and Spikes, so that
many for want of sleep and continual pain, gave up the Ghost in the Prison. In Amacusa they nail'd up their houses, so starving them to death. Emperor Toxogunsama dies.¶ ANno 1653. The Emperor Toxogunsama dy'd without Issue, so that Daifu∣sama his Family ended all in the second Generation. The next to the Crown was Prince Quane, who was immediately after Toxogunsama's death set on the Throne, under the tuition of five Overseers, Congono, Bongono, Inhano, Oyemo, and Sannikino. The Christian Religion was now fully rooted up, where∣fore those strict Edicts heretofore Issu'd out against them, began to be forgot∣ten; it seem'd as if the Emperors Overseers had a greater mind to a foreign Trade,The Peers govern more mildly. and therefore Govern'd a quite contrary way to that of the Emperors. They first wink'd at those Sanguinary Laws, so letting them decay by degrees, by which means many Traders suddenly came ashore. The Spaniards also had no small hopes to regain their former Trade, and the Japanners themselves had leave to Trade in other foreign Countreys, which liberty they had been debar'd of a long time. Jesuits intend to return to Japan. Haz. Church Hist. fol. 182.But chiefly the Jesuits took fresh courage, who immediately spread them∣selves over the neighboring Provinces of Japan, as Tunquin, Councina, and other places, to the end, they might be near at hand, that as soon as any fit oppor∣tunity presented, they might Land on Japan, and go on afresh with their for∣mer design; but it hath to this day had no success, for the Overseers of the Emperor Quane kept strict Watch against their incroachings, though they seem'd not so eager in erecting the foremention'd Blood-baths, according to those strict Edicts publish'd by Toxogunsama. Toxogunsama a great So∣domite.¶ IT deserves farther our Observation, how Quane obtain'd the Japan Crown; Toxogunsama having no Issue, he being exceedingly inclin'd to the Sin of Sodom, when he had attain'd to some years, acknowledg'd no Successor that was sprung from his Seed; for which cause, not without great reasons, Civil Wars were to be fear'd, if the Emperor should die without Issue. The Dairo himself seem'd to be concern'd about this business, wherefore he chooses two beautiful Maids nearly Ally'd to him, which he sent to Toxogunsama, to the end, he might choose one out of the two, to honor and make her a Miday, which is as much to say,Marries. as an Empress. The Emperor chose her which he judg'd for the most beautiful, yet he went on in his old way of Sodomy, which the Empress took privately to heart, yet bridled her self with patience, that she might not incur the Emperors displeasure; when her dislike of his actions should be known to him. Mean while, the Empresses Guardian, or Foster-Mother came to hear of it, who being held in great Respect for her Age, faith∣ful Services, and Noble Extract, found her self necessitated to watch for a good conveniency, and to stir up the Emperor to love his Consort; It happen'd, that on a time she found Toxogunsama in a fit Humor, in which she thought the time was come wherein she might effect her Design,The Empress Guardians discourse to the Emperor. saying, How can your Imperial Majesty take such a contrary course of Love? What benefit will such shameful Conversation with Men bring you in the end? Leave that wicked course, and seek to get a Successor, that may be sole Governor over Japan, keep the Empire in Peace, against all Civil Wars; it being the occasion of great Blood-shed, when every one may according to his Ambi∣tion aim to be Chief? Hath Nature also ever brought a more Beautiful Creature into the World, than your Empress? Would not the World rejoyce
with Toxogunsama, if Toxogunsama's Stock did not die; but that the Japan Government might remain amongst his Issue many Ages. The Emperor being incens'd with anger against her presumption, was si∣lent, but sent for his chief Builders, and commanded a Palace to be erected like a Castle, with strong Walls, deep Moats, great Gates, and many stately Rooms. He locks up the Em∣press.Not long after, this Edifice being finish'd, he sent the Empress thither, with her Sister, Mother, and Retinue, there to keep her from the sight of all Men. And though it look'd so ill to the Empresses Fostress, yet it concern'd the Emperor's Guardian to unite him in Marriage: To which end she sent into all Parts of Japan for the most beautifullest Women, which she cunningly at several times brought before Toxogunsama.Matries an ordinary Mans Daughter. Amongst many others he fix'd his Eye on an Armorer's Daughter, which soon after was with Child by him. Her mean Extract occasion'd great murmuring and dislike amongst the Peers of the Empire, Courtiers and Ladies of Honor; therefore they privately con∣spir'd to murder the Child in its Birth, that there might not one of so mean a Mother ever come to Reign over Japan.The Emperors Child is Murder'd. This their resolution was at last effected, but kept from the knowledge of the Emperor, who else would have punish'd such a Crime with the greatest severity. By this Accident Quano succeeded, he being the nearest in Blood to Toxo∣gunsama. Thus far we have spoken of the Persecutions of the Japan Emperors, and their Transactions till Quano's Reign. Frisius and Brookhurst travel for Nangesaque.¶ THe Netherland Ambassadors, Frisius and Brookhurst, Anno 1650. took their leave, and travel'd for Nangesaque. They came on the twenty seventh of April to Meaco, where they stay'd three days and a half;Come to Meaco. which they spent, upon their Hosts Invitations, in viewing the greatest and most eminent
Houses in the City, which are already describ'd in their Journey to the Court: they were carry'd in Sedans amongst great throngs of Men, Women, and Children, who out of curiosity flock'd together to see them. Apparel of the Japan Women.¶ THe Women, both Marry'd and Unmarry'd, go very neatly dress'd in their Hair, Combing it daily, and smoothing it with Whites of Eggs, insomuch that it shines like Glass, and is black as Jet; behind hangs a Braid, or Tuft thereof, over their Shoulders, and one Lock on their Forehead: by the bigness of their Heads they are known from all other People: Both Men and Women wear long Semarrs, which reach down somewhat below their Knees, and are made with wide Sleeves, turn'd up very broad, fac'd with Silk or other Stuffs: about their Middle they tie a broad Girdle, curiously embroider'd. There is scarce any Woman that hath not a Fan with a long Handle when she comes abroad. Description of the Tem∣ple of Daiboth.¶ AMongst other stately Temples which the Ambassadors Frisius and Brook∣hurst view'd in their Journey, was the Temple dedicated to Daiboth, being no less costly than large and artificial: on each side of the Gate stood two great Images, representing two horrible Fiends, with Stilletto's in their Hands, and Hangers by their Sides, the one looking fiercely upon the other, seeming just ready for an Encounter. Through this Passage they enter'd into a square Court, with a Gallery round it, supported with Stone Columns; on the top of each Pillar hang curious Cabinets like Lanterns; before the second Gate are two exceeding great Lyons hewn out of Stone, between which the Passage leads into the Church; wherein there appears a terrible Image, sitting like a Taylor with his Legs across under him, yet is of that heighth, that it reaches the Vaulted Roof of the Church: it is made, according to the relation of the Japanners, of Wood, and Plaister'd over with Mortar, and that cover'd with Copper, double Gilt; the Hair upon the Head shews black and curl'd like a Negro's. The bigness of this Idol may be judg'd by his Hands, which far exceed those of an ordinary Man, yet are but small in proportion to the other parts of his Body: the whole Statue represents a Woman sitting in a Ring of darting Beams richly Gilded: within the Beams of this Circle are ma∣ny smaller Images of several shapes and fashions, and on both sides several other hewn to the Life, with shining Radii about their Heads, just as the Saints are drawn in Print, all richly Gilt. The Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst were each of them carry'd in a Se∣dan by Japanners into the Temple, before, behind, and on both sides, went a great Train, consisting in Servants that belong'd to the East-India Company, and all degrees of Japan Men and Women, which altogether press'd into see them; two Trumpetters stay'd at the Entry, where they sounded all the time of their tarrying there. This noise brought a great number of People toge∣ther, whilst Frisius and Brookhurst view'd with admiration the wonderful great Image. The Altar on which it sits is rais'd a little from the Ground; over which hang several burning Lamps. Hither the Japanners come daily to their Devotion, some laying themselves flat on the Ground, others bowing their Heads down to the Earth. Description of the Ox-Temple.¶ BUt besides Daiboths Temple, there is also to be admir'd the Ox-Temple: which Beast is made of Massy Gold, with a great Knob on his Back,
and a Golden Collar about his Neck imboss'd with Precious Stones, butting his Horns against an Egg, whereon he stands with his Fore-feet, his hindmost resting on Stone and Earth mix'd together; under which and the Egg appears much Water, kept in a hollow Stone, which hath for its Basis a square Altar; whose Foot is Engraven with many Japan Characters. The Bouzies false Rela∣tions concerning the Ox.Strange Stories and Fables do the Bonzies relate to the Japanners concerning this Ox, namely, That the World before the Creation was inclos'd in a great Egg, the Shell of which consisted of Brass: With this Egg the World drove on the Water, till at last the Moon by her piercing light drew up some of the bottom thereof, which afterwards growing together became Earth and Stone; on which the Egg lay fast, and the Ox finding it, butted so vehemently against the Brass Shell, that breaking it, the World came forth: But the Ox blow∣ing very much, being heated with such hard Labor, his Breath entred into a Calabash, which grew to be a Man. The Calabash the Bonzies call Pou, and the first: Man Pourang, because he owes his original to a Calabash. The Devil King of the Oxen.Gasper Villela relates, that the Devil in his time possess'd the Japanners, that he was the King of Oxen, and that he would not leave off punishing them till they had built him a Temple, and worshipp'd him in the shape of an Ox; for which reason in some of the Japan Kingdoms it is present Death to kill an Ox. It deserves no small admiration,Rom. 1.23. that the Heathens which chang'd the splen∣dor of a never-dying God into the likeness of mortal Man, Birds, four-footed Beasts, and creeping Animals, but chiefly, and most of all chose the shape of an Ox; which made the Indians flock by thousands to the mountainous Province of Nakarecit, belonging to the great Magor, to offer to the Cow Matta, standing in a costly Temple, on a far more rich and costly Altar. The Floor and Cieling of the Temple consisted of Golden Plates fastned together, the Altar Inlay'd with Pearls and Diamonds: But the Sacrifices themselves above all are to be admir'd at; for the Indians cut off their Tongues, burning it before Matta. The Romans and Greeks were much concern'd in the use of an Ox. On the Hill Aventinus in Rome, the Temple dedicated to Diana was hung full of Ox-Horns. Those that were banish'd from Athens to Argiva, were said to keep the Ox, because a great Copper Ox was erected there, and worshipp'd. The Thracians and Egyptians offer'd Wine out of Ox-Horns when they pro∣mis'd Marriage, or made other Obligations to one another. The antient Romans had a long time no Coyn'd Silver nor Gold; but made Money of Ox-Hides. They also made a Law, That no Judge should lay a greater Fine on any Criminal than thirty Oxen, every Ox being reckon'd at four Shillings. Julius Obsequen. de Pro∣dig.And how common is it amongst the Latine Writers, to ascribe the Lan∣guage of a Man to an Ox; for an Ox spake in Sicily when the Roman General Marcellus broke up the Siege before Nola, and routed Hannibal in the heighth of his Victories. Another Ox made a noise in Privernum, when Hannibal fled from Mar∣cellus. The same is ascribed to this Beast among the Romans, when Scipio subdu'd the resisting Spaniards. At Formii an Ox cry'd out, O Romans, look to your selves, when Antiochus came down with a mighty Army.
In Campania another Ox spoke whilst the Romans made themselves Masters of Sardinia. At other times the distinct Language of an Ox was a bad Omen:Volater. l. 25. for in Frusimo an Ox was heard to speak when the Roman General Cneius Octavius was slain by the Guardian of the young King Antiochus: and also another when the Romans receiv'd a great Overthrow near Numantia: and another when the Cim∣brians march'd with Victorious Arms to Italy; about which Speech a Council was call'd, that sat under the azure Canopy of Heaven. In Sinuessa Cows brought forth Horses, which signifi'd the destruction of Posthumius in France. In Rome an Ox ran up Stairs, and leap'd down from the highest Story, let∣ting them know by that, that the Romans should be miserably beaten by Han∣nibal near the Lake Thrasimenes. An Ox also in Essium breath'd Fire. Moreover, the Roman Priests offer'd a white Ox of five years old, fetch'd from the Menanian or Felician Fields, to Jupiter, in the middle of every Moneth; but the Egyptians a red Ox to Typhon: and Pythagoras, who else forbad the kil∣ling of Beasts, because humane Souls transmigrated into their Bodies, a grey Ox to the nine Muses. Where Oxen may not be kill'd on pain of Death.The Greek Law-giver Solon forbad very strictly the killing of an Ox, either for Sacrifice or otherwise, according to the opinion of the antient Greeks, who accounted the killing of a Man to be a less sin than killing of an Ox: wherefore Prometheus underwent great reproach, because he was the first that cut an Oxes Throat: and Homer the Greek Poet says, That the Sun was ex∣ceedingly enrag'd against the Mariners of Ulysses, that did not scruple to eat Ox-Flesh. At Chusa, an Egyptian City, Venus was formerly worshipp'd with Ox-Horns on her Head. Columella relates, That the antient Latines condemn'd him to die that had kill'd an Ox. Oxen highly esteem'd by the Indians.And what the Opinion is of the Oxen on the Coasts of Cormandel, Malabare, Calicut, Gusaratte, and in other Indian Territories, Abraham Rogerius relates from the Mouth of the Brachman Padmanaba; these are his words: That as amongst all Beasts, the Cows; amongst all Fowls, the Bird Garronda (which is a red Sparrow with a white Ring about the Neck;) amongst all Trees, the Ranasettou; so amongst all Men the Generation of Brachmans was most acceptable to God. Moreover, Padmanaba relates, That the Inhabitants of Cormandel are divi∣ded into four Tribes, or Families, namely the Brachmans, Settrea's, out of which the Kings are chosen, Weinsja's, divided in Comytis and Sitti-weapari, and lastly the Soudra's. The Settrea's and Soudra's eat Fish and Flesh, that of Oxen onely excepted; but the Brachmans and Weinsja's eat no Food that ever had liv'd, ac∣cording to the Commandment in their Vedam, for so those Heathens call their Law-Book. Why those Souls are the happiest that assume the Bodies of Oxen.These four Tribes hold the Pythagorean Transmigration, making the Soul wander into other Bodies, and esteem that Soul the most happy that enters in∣to a Cow; for which they give this Reason: Eswara, who next to Wistnow is their prime and chief Deity, hath a Consort call'd Parvatia, by which he begat five Sons, viz. Viegneswara, Vierrepadra, Beirewa, chief Judge over Men, who af∣ter Death changes the Wicked into evil Serpents, Comara Swami, and Nandi, which are also call'd Baswa and Basanna. Handi is an Ox, and Wahanan, that is, A Bearer, whereon Eswara is carry'd.
The interring of Oxen very sumptuously perfor∣med.Rogerus witnesseth, that he hath seen a dead Ox to have had a more statelier Funeral than a Person of Quality; sounding of Trumpets is usual where any one dies, covering the Ox, and offering Frankincense before him. In like manner the antient Egyptians made great Sorrow when one of these Creatures dy'd. In the time of King Ptolomy the Wise, an Egyptian bestow'd all his ready Mo∣ney on the Funeral of a dead Ox, and borrow'd forty thousand Ducats of the King to make the Funeral the more stately. The Learned Julius Scaliger is of opinion,Scal. Exer. 258. l. 1. that the Eastern People have learn'd the worshipping of Oxen from the Egyptians; As formerly, says he, the Ox Isis was by the Egyptians held for a god, so at this time the Ox call'd Tambaran amongst the Indians. Julius Maternus, who liv'd in the time of the Emperor Constantine the Great, affirms, That the Egyptian Apis being a black Ox, with a white Head and shag Hair, represented the Patriarch Joseph. And Ruffinus in his Church-History saith thus: Some say,Ruff. l. 2. Hist. Eccl. that the Image of Apis is erected to the honor of Joseph, for his distributing the Corn, by which he assisted the Egyptians in the time of Famine. It seemeth that the Name Joseph is changed to Apis, because the People should serve a more supreme Deity, and not worship a Man. Augustine, or the Writer of the Wonders of Scripture, relates, That the Egyptians placed an Ox by Joseph's Burying-place, because it is the usefullest Creature in Tilling. and Joseph's explaining Pharaoh's Dream, in which he saw seven fat Oxen climbing out of Nylus, and after that seven lean ones: There is a great Mystery in it, that the Oxen should just come out of the Nyle; for Egypts scarcity and plenty depends on the same, according as the River flows more or less over the Countrey. Pliny saith,Plin. l. 5. c. 9. That Egypt suffers Famine when the Nyle is eighteen Foot above the Ground; nay, that they want still, though it be nineteen and a half; but one and twenty brings them plenty, and four and twenty abundance. Moreover, Joseph explain'd not onely the King's Dream, but gave him ex∣ceeding good Counsel, That the fifth part of the Growth the Subjects should give to the King; and Store-houses were built for the reception thereof. Furthermore, to represent the plenty and scarcity of Egypt, nothing was more convenient than fat and lean Oxen: Therefore the Romans, in honor to the Overseer of their Provisions, Lucius Minutius, erected a Gilded Ox without the Portcullis'd Gate, because he brought down the Price of the Corn, and sold it to the People, as Livius relates it.Livius lib. 4. According to the fruitfulness of the Year, Bread is either cheap or dear. But, as the Greek Historiographer Diodorus relates,Diod. lib. 1. the Oxen have brought the most Profit to the Sowers of Corn, by helping them to till the Land, and do all other necessary business belonging to Husbandry:Varr. l. 2. E. H. c. 5. therefore the Learnedst of the Romans, Terentius Varro, calls an Ox a Companion for Men in Husbandry, and a Servant useful to advantage the Growth of Corn. The Ancients did so much esteem an Ox, that they condemn'd those to death that kill'd one. Ealianus adds hereunto,Aelian. l. 5. c. 14. That there was amongst the Athenians this Law establish'd, An Ox which draws either Plough or Waggon you shall not kill, because he is a Laborer and Companion in humane Society. But Pharaoh, being amaz'd at Joseph's wisdom and understanding, shew'd
him exceeding great honor, insomuch that he made him Vice-Roy over all Egypt. He also gave him a Ring, which he put on his Finger, not onely for a testimony of his honor, but also to Seal his Letters Patents; and chang'd his Name Joseph into Saphenath Paneah, which Onkelus saith, signifies A Man to whom Secrets are disclos'd;Hieron Quaest. Hebraic. but Hieronimus saith, in the Egyptian Tongue it is Preserver of the World, because he deliver'd it from the threatning Famine. The King also gave him Asnah to Wife, she being the Daughter of Cohen, Governor in On; so that Joseph receiv'd all imaginable honor in his Life-time. It was then customary amongst the Egyptians, to preserve the Memory of those Princes which had done Service for the Publick, and to Posterity, by erecting their Images: But they thought there could be no better Representa∣tion to express Joseph's noble and beneficial Deeds than an Ox. And without doubt this honor in the beginning was not common, for otherwise Joseph would not have permitted them to make an Idol of him, or suffer'd himself to be worshipp'd; which the Priests perform'd by keeping an Ox, which was shewn to the People to put them in mind of Joseph's goodness in the time of the seven years Faminc. Joseph worshipp'd in the shape of an Ox.After the expiration of of some years this private Honor became a publick Religion, for valiant Men that had perform'd noble Exploits and Atchieve∣ments in their lives, were by the Greeks interr'd in stately Tombs, with their Images and Characters Engraven and set on them, and a peculiar Worship ap∣pointed them. What wonder is it then if the Egyptians, who were wont to ac∣knowledge their deceased Princes as gods, which in their Lives had Govern'd their Subjects with wisdom and prudence, invented a method for worshipping of Joseph, who when he liv'd was call'd Saphena Paneah, that is, Preserver of the World: And so great was the impression his goodness left upon that People, that after-Generations without contradiction believ'd, and have shewn more honor and reverence to Joseph than to any other. Quintus Curtius relates concerning the same,Curt. lib. 4. of Calisthenes contradicting the Sicilian Standard-bearer Cleo, who would have Alexander the Great whilst alive, to be worshipp'd as a Deity; saith he, For to be taken for a god is very requiste: for always their Successors requite noble Hero's with such thanks: divine honor oftentimes follows a Man, but never accompanies him: The humane frailty of Hercules and Bac∣chus was hid from mortal Eyes, when Fame once carry'd them to Heaven. Hereto is added, That Joseph enrich'd many of the chief Egyptian Princes; and without doubt rais'd his Relations to the highest Dignities, and therefore was in great esteem and favor and by that means the easier, according to the Japan manner, worshipp'd under the form of the Ox Apis, in the chief City Memphis, which would not be inferior to Heliopolis; wherein, according to Plu∣tarch, the black Ox Mnavis was religiously ador'd. The original of the word Apis.But the original of the Name Apis the Learned Gerard Vossius looks for in the Egyptian word Ap, which is to say, Father, for so Joseph was call'd: nay, Pharaoh caus'd to be proclaim'd before him the Name Abrech, which Rabbi Salo∣mon Jarchi says is Father King; though Hieronimus embraces that Opinion of Rabbi Judah and Jonathan, which explain Abrech to signifie a A Tender Father; Tender because of Joseph's Youth, and Father because of his Wisdom, Prudence, and Fatherly Care he had for Egypt in the time of Famine. Lastly,Jun. in Deut. 33.17. it is worthy our observation, that Moses when he blessed the twelve Tribes of Israel, the Progeny of the House of Joseph, he divided to Ephraim and Manasseh, whom he likens to a first-born Ox, according as Franciscus Junius saith, Joseph is represented in Egypt.
The Japanners Ox-Re∣ligion from whom.By all this it appears plainly, that this kind of worshipping of Oxen had its first original in Egypt, and so by degrees spread it self amongst other Hea∣thens, and at last reach'd the far distant Japanners; not unlike an infectious Dis∣ease, that runs from City to City, and from Countrey to Countrey, till at last the Contagion becomes Epidemical. The Japanners Opinion concerning the Egg in which the World lay is very an∣tient.¶ BUT concerning the Egg, in which, according to the Bonzies, the World was inclos'd, before the Ox broke the brazen Shell, the Eastern Peo∣ple have had many strange Opinions before the Birth of our Saviour, so that the Japanners conceit thereof is very antient: for the famous Sorcerer Zoroa∣ster, a Scholar to Azonaces, taught amongst the Persians and Medes above two thousand years past, That all things had two beginnings: the good acknow∣ledg'd Oromasdes, extracted from the purer Light, for an increase of the World; all bad things proceeded from Arimanius, and himself came from Darkness; That Oromasdes made the Stars and good gods, and laid them together in an Egg; but Arimanius created the Devil, and broke the Egg; from whence arose not onely envy between Arimanius and Oromasdes, but also a mixture of the good with the bad. The most antient Heathens, as appears by the Phoenician Writer Sanchuniathon, represented the World by an Egg. The Inhabitants of Thebes in Egypt worshipp'd the Creator of all things, in the shape of a Man spitting forth an Egg out of his Mouth. A strange Representati∣on of the Creator of the World in the Temple at Meaco.¶ MOreover, besides the Ox-Temple in Meaco, there is also to be seen the stately Chappel dedicated to the Creator of all things; who is re∣presented in a very strange manner. In the middle of the Temple is a great Pot full of Water, surrounded with a Wall, seven Foot high from the Ground; in the middle of which appears an exceeding great Tortoise, whose Shell, Feet, and Head, stands in the Water; out of its Back rises the Body of a great Tree, on the top of which sits a strange and horrrible Image, under whom are laid twelve Cushions, reaching a good way over the Tree. The Statue placed after the Japan manner, with the Legs under the Body, hath a Golden Crown on its Head, which together with the Breast is as black as Jet, the Hair like that of a Negro, but the Crown runs up taporing, and ends with a sharp Point turn'd, and beset with Pearls, the whiteness of the Eyes shines exceedingly above the black∣ness of the Body, about his Neck is a double String of Pearls, and a rich and costly Diamond ty'd to the same; the Coat that covers the Body is open before, insomuch that the Breast appears naked down to the Belly, which is cover'd with a Cloth ty'd close with a Girdle; on its Breast hangs a String of Oriental Pearl, and under the left Arm a Scarf of Gold pleited; somewhat lower hangs another on the right Side; the Edge of the Coat is also beset with Precious Stones, and hangs in a Bag over the Belly, betwixt the Knees: the Image hath four Arms; one of the left Arms he holds upright, and about its foremost Finger a great Golden Hoop; from the Elbow of this Arm appears a second, of which the Hand is clenched together holding a Lilly; somewhat below the right Shoul∣der is another Arm, the Hand of which grasps a Cruise, from whence Water issues continually; the other right Hand holds a Scepter. The Idol is all over black, which Colour among the Japanners signifies Joy.Brazen Tree whereon the Creator sits. The Tree whereon he sits, is of Brass; in which were inclos'd all the Materials of which (according to the Bonzies relation) this Idol was made; about the middle of this Tree an
exceeding great Serpent hath wreath'd it self twice, whose Head and Body is on the right Side held fast by two horrible Shapes, the remaining part thereof to the Tail, two Kings, and one of the Japan Sages stretch forth. Why the Japanners wor∣ship Snakes.Without doubt the Japanners have left some Place for the worshipping of Snakes in their Religion, as also for evil Spirits, because they should not pre∣judice them; so that both of them are feared, because they are hurtful. And indeed India breeds Serpents whose Stings,Hist. Indic. l. 2. as Johannes Petrus Maffeus affirms, are mortal. Serpent Porphirus what kind.The Serpent Porphirus hath a white Head, and Purple-colour'd Body, but no Teeth, his Breath exceeding poisonous. Those that catch him hang him up by the Tail, putting two Kettles under his Head; in the one they catch the Droppings that come from his Mouth, in the other the putrifying Matter that comes from the decaying Body: The first Poyson in a moment bereaves Men of their Lives in a most terrible manner; for all the Limbs of the Body are miserably tortur'd, the Eyes turn in the Head, and the Brains drop out of the Nostrils; the second operates two years after it is taken. Moreover, some Serpents are so exceeding poisonous, that those that tread on the Ground, on which in few hours before these venomous Creatures have crept, will immediately fall down dead. Serpent Polpoch very ter∣rible.The Serpent Polpoch, so call'd because it makes such a noise, bites with its Mouth, and stings with the Tail, climbs on Trees, hides its Tail in the Mouth, and winds it self about Travellers, whose Flesh thus bruised rots in three days; insomuch that those hurt in that manner die like a Man that is laid asleep by drinking two much Liquor. Strange power of small Snakes, or Serpents.There are also little Snakes no bigger than a Quill: these set upon Men sleeping, and can by no means be taken off; they creep in at the Wounds, and eat so long till they have quite devour'd him: which without doubt is the onely reason that the Japanners have learn'd from the Indians to worship Ser∣pents, that they might not be hurt by them. A long time before the Birth of our Savior, the Egyptians adored an Adder; and the Indians,Dissertat. 38. according to the relation of the antient Writer Maximus Tyri∣us, a Serpent. This kind of Idolatry may be said to be deriv'd from China, the native Countrey of the antient Japanners; and from Tartary, bordering on China, which brought it thither; for it is known, that not onely India, but also all the North shew'd a great reverencee to these poisonous Animals many Centuries past. Julius Scaliger relates,In Arist. Hist. Anim. l. 2. That in the Kingdom of Calicut, Serpents with very great Heads, not much unlike those of Swine, were worshipp'd by the Kings as gods. In Sarmatin. Euxopaen.Alexander Guaginus also relates, that the Lyflanders believe Adders and Ser∣pents to be gods; for which reason they shew'd them all honor imaginable, every Master of a Family, noble or ignoble, keeping one in his House, which they worshipp'd and fed with Milk and Cocks-flesh: It was held for a certain ill Omen, if any misfortune, or ill happen'd thereto, and the unfortunately wicked Offender that hurt the Vermin, was generally cut Limb from Limb. The Prusians,Antiquit. Boruss. l. 1. according to the account of Erasmus Stella, liv'd several Ages, without acknowledging any Religion, till at last they became devoted adorers of Serpents. The same ignorance is at this day a Custome amongst the Samogithes: if any
ill happen to them, they presently judge, that it proceeds from their House-Serpent, which hath not been well treated. Sigismund, Baron of Herbenstein, tells us, that he came from Muscovia to Troki;Comment. Muscovia. where his Host, in whose House he had Lodged the Year before, told him, that at that time he had bought some Bee-hives of a Servant to a worshipper of Serpents, who by many convincing arguments was become a Christian; for which cause he slew his Serpent, which till then he had religiously worship∣ped; but afterwards going to the Field to view his Bees, he found by their Hives a Man with his Mouth wide open to his very Ears, and of strange shape: This deformed Creature cry'd out, I have laid violent hands on my god, the Serpent, and am therefore thus purnish'd, and if I do not return to my deserted Religion, I shall suffer ten thousand times more. Of whom the Japanners have learnt to worship Serpents.It appears that the Japanners, and also other antient and later People have erected the Images of Serpents in their Temples, because Eve was deceived by a Serpent: for who will contradict, that the Heathens do not hide Gods Truth under their seeming Ignorance, and shew through their greatest darkness a glimmering of light, although by the Devils policy, and falsness of Man-kind, the glory and splendor of the holy Bible hath been more and more darkned? which the Greek and Latine Poets have neatly adorn'd, and chiefly that which they relate of the never-sleeping Dragon, that kept the Golden Apples in the Garden of Hesperides, which Hercules slew at last, bringing away the Golden Fruit to his Father Eurystheus. Is not this a likeness of the Serpent in Eden, whose Head our Saviour bruis'd to pieces? and doth it not represent the Reli∣gion of the antient Greeks? According to the testimony of the Greek Writers, Hesychius, Clemens, and Plutarch, the Greeks say they cry aloud on their Feast-days,Clem. in Protrept. Plut. in Alex. Eva, Eva, pointing together at a Serpent. And what a pudder the Ophites, which came forth Anno 132. made about a Snake, may be seen in the Church-Histo∣ries.Ophites what kind of He∣reticks. They Preach'd that Christ was the Serpent that deluded Eve, and after∣wards entred into the Virgin Mary in the shape of a Snake. They kept not the Sacrament without bringing forth by Charms a Serpent out of her Hole, and sometimes out of a Box, judging the Bread to be vile, and not holy, if the Viper had not tasted, or at least touched it. The Serpent under the Japan Creator of what kind.BUt to return again to the Japan Serpent about the Tree, whereon the Idol of the Creation fits: This Snake stretches its Head to the right side of the Idol, where two horrible Fiends stand on the edge of the Wall that incloses the Water and Tortoise before mention'd. Description of a Japan Devil.The foremost Spirit hath two hairy Feet, a long Tail, a Scarf wrapt under his Arms, which hangs on his Back; about his Neck a rich String of Pearls; with both the Hands holding the Serpent close by the Head; the Ears are great like an Asses that stand upright; but Headed like a Dog with a long Snout. In former times Anubis, a famous Deity amongst the Egyptians, appear'd with a Dogs Head, because Isis made use of Anubis, that thereby she might seek for her lost Husband Osiris King of Egypt, who was murder'd by his Brother Ty∣phon, and at last in Syene found him in several Pieces. Another very terrible.Moreover, between the Image with the Dogs Head and the chief Idol, stands a second Shape, likewise laying hold on the Serpent, Clothed in a Coat, cut sloapingly above the Knees, a Scarf about his Neck, made fast on his Breast, the longest end thereof hanging over his right Arm: His Head is most
like unto that of a Roe-buck, holding its Mouth wide open, with large Ears, and a pair of Harts-horns. These two Monsters, as they say, us'd all their Force and endeavor to hin∣der the Creation of the World.Why the Japanners offer them Sacrifice. The Japanners offer Sacrifice to them when Herbs and Plants are in their first Growth, to the end they should not hurt the tender Plants. The worshippnig of the Devil brought from China to Japan. Maff. Histor. Indie. l. 6.¶ It seemeth that this worshipping of evil Spirits was brought from China to Japan; for the Chineses worship the Devil, not for any good they de∣sire of him, but because he should not hurt them. The Images of these Devils rest on horrible Dragons; that spit forth Fire from their gaping Mouths, and are made after a terrible manner. Of them they desire to know the event of such things as they take in hand; which they do thus:Strange dealings with evil Shapes. They have two Woodden Buttons as big as Acorns, which are split in the middle, and strung on a piece of Thred, which they throw down at the Feet of one of these evil Spirits: if they both fall with the flat sides down∣wards, or one on the flat, and the other on the round side, that they look up∣on as a bad Omen: for which cause they rail exceedingly against their Deity; but immediately after, as if they repented, they again flatter him, and sue for pardon, by offering Sacrifice: and whenever their lot falls out unlucki∣ly, they fall from Words to Blows, throwing the Image into the Water, or burn some part off from his Body: then they fall again to Praying. This kind of scolding and worshipping continues so long, till both the Buttons fall flat on the Ground; whereupon they all rejoyce, thanking the evil Spirit, presenting him with all manner of Dainties curiously drest, as Ducks, Geese, Rice, and Swines Heads, accounted one of their best Dishes, and a Can of Wine: When they have laid a little scrap of the foremention'd Dishes on the Altar before the Image, as the Tip of the Hogs Ear, the Claws of the fore∣mention'd Fowls, and some drops of Wine, they fall upon the rest themselves, and eat it up with a great deal of mirth and good appetite. There are also Priests amongst the Chineses, establish'd by Lanzis, whose Mother went big with him eighty years. These draw on yellow Paper hor∣rible Shapes of evil Spirits, which they stick on the Walls of the Houses; then they run all over the House, making a noise, as if they were Devils themselves; and by this means they pretend to banish the Devil. The worshipping of evil Spirits spread far and near, Vertoman. l. 5. Navigat.¶ BUt this worshipping of evil Spirits is not onely usual in Japan and China, but also in the East and West-Indies. The Calicuters believe, That Tamarini, Creator of the World, hath resign'd the Government thereof, that he might live the better at ease; but that he hath given the Command thereof to the Devil Deumam, whose Image being made very horrible, is religiously worshipp'd by the Brachmans, that he should not prejudice them. Practis'd in the time of Moses.This adoring of diabolical Fiends hath not onely spread it self over a great part of the World, but also is very antient: for in Moses his time this wicked∣ness had gotten great footing; he speaks of it in Levit. 17.7. And they shall no more offer their Offerings unto Devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. And again in Deut. 32.17. They offer'd unto Devils, not to God. Furthermore, many Heathens so respected this diabolical Worship before the Birth of our Saviour, that they took Infants out of their Mothers
Wombs, burning them to the Honor of the Devil;Lut Pharsal. lib. . of which Lucan saith thus. The unripe Fruit, ripp'd from the tender Womb, 'Gainst Natures Laws, finds a too cruel Tomb, On Wooden Altars, cover'd with their Gore, To shew how highly Devils they adore. But on the left hand of the Japanners Creator, two Kings and an ancient Phi∣losopher hold the remaining part of the foremention'd Serpent to the Tail. The nearest King towards the Image wears a Crown with three Points,The first King that holds the Japan-Serpent and turns up behind, under which hangs a Golden Scarf; about his Neck is a double String of Pearls; on his Breast, a costly Diamond, tied with a Silk Ribbon; his Coat is open below the Belly; his Face represents that of a young Man, and looks upon the two Evil Spirits, that stand on the right side of the Image. This King resided some time near the Sea, and joyn'd with the Devils, to hinder the Creation of Heaven and Earth. The ssecond King hath four Heads.The same Intentions that King had which stands next: He likewise grasps the Serpent with both his Hands; a single String of Pearls hangs on his Breast; his Coat covers above half his Legs; a Scarf hangs over his Right Shoulder; he hath four Heads, each with a picked Beard, and all cover'd with one Gol∣den Crown, like a Bonnet, on which are several Tops, some smaller than others, all running with a Point upwards. These four Heads signifie four thousand Years, which this King liv'd. An ancient Japan Philo∣sopher.The old Philosopher with his right Hand holds the Body of the Serpent, with his left grasping the Tail: His Coat just covers his Knees; his Beard long, and parted in the middle; his Face represents that of an Old Man; be∣hind on his Head appears the Image of a Dragon, looking towards the right side, and towards the left his contorted Tail; on his Forehead he hath a gol∣den Circle.
Gods with many Heads in Japan.But as to what concerns the Four-headed Idol, the Japanners have divers Gods with several Heads; for they oftentimes make Xaca with three, which they cover all with one Cap: Sometimes they represent Canon the Son of Ami∣da with seven Heads on his Breast. Father Gruber relates, That he found several Temples in Necbal, a Province in Tartary, in which were Idols with divers Heads; and in some Places, six Heads without Bodies were set on a Table, with three Ascents, on the lowermost of which three of them were plac'd in a row; on the middlemost, two; and on the top, one; each standing betwixt the Vacancy above the other. On both sides stood Ves∣sels, all of Oval fashion, for the burning Incense; and flat Dishes, with Offerings to the Heads. But to come to our Description: Between the foremention'd Ancient Phi∣losopher, and Four-headed King, an Image appears representing the Sun, ri∣sing out of the Water, cloth'd in a Vest, part of it seeming under the Water; over his left Arm a Scarf, and in the same hand many sharp Spikes; his Beard long, and on his Head a Crown of golden Rays; his right Hand arm'd with a Steeletto, or sharp Iron Bodkin, with which it seems to prick and push the Tortoise, on which the Brazen Tree, and the Creator (as they call him) rest, to cause it to turn; which moves so slowly, that they say it comes but once about in a thousand Years. Nothing is less to be admir'd, than that the Japanners worship the Sun also in their Temples; for no Idolatry whatsoever can boast to be so old, in which they did not worship the Sun; whose Adoration was more Venerable, and spread it self further than any Idol whatsoever; concerning whose Antiquity, Job speaks thus;Job 31.26.27. If I beheld the Sun when it shined, or the Moon walking in brightness: And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand. Here this Adoration of the Celestial Bodies, after the manner of the Heathens, is appa∣rent, according to which, the first Worshippers of the Sun kiss'd their Hands, in token of Honor;App. Met. lib. 4. though afterwards, according to Apuleius, they bent only their foremost right Finger towards the Thumb, whilst they turn'd themselves round,Deut. 4.19. and pray'd to the Rising Sun. Moses also saith; And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto Heaven, and when thou seest the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, even all the Host of Heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them. But notwith∣standing Gods Commands, the Israelites have chiefly learn'd the Sun-worship from the Syrians, which call'd the Sun Bahal, that is to say, Lord; the Phenici∣ans, Beel-Samen (according to Philo, from the Ancient Writer Sanchoriathon) which is, Lord of the Heavens: The Inhabitants of the Phenician City Accaron, gave the Sun the Name of Baal-zehaim, signifying, The Lord of Offerings; but afterwards that Name was chang'd to Baal-zebub, that is, The God of Flies, to whom in bad Times,De Abstinent. Animal. lib. 2. as droughty Seasons, when those Insects, ushering great Sicknesses, rage, they offer'd their Children. The Ammonites understood the Sun likewise by their Moloch or Milcom, to whose Honor the Parents carried their Sons and Daughters betwixt two Fires, or caused them to be led by Priests to be cleansed; and at other times they were burnt in that Image of Moloch, which was divided into seven Copper Caverns, which when they are made red hot with the Image, the Officer, according to Rabbi Simeon, throws into the first Division fine Flower; in the second, a Turtle-dove; in the third, a Sheep; in the fourth, a Ram; in the fifth, a Calf; in the sixth, an Ox; and in the seventh, a Child. These seven Chambers represent the seven Pla∣nets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna: Therefore the Sun of old receiv'd the chiefest Offering, being held for the most eminent God.
The Emssenians in Syria Apomena built for the Sun,Saturn. l. c. 23. by them call'd Heliogaba∣lus, that is, God of the Mountain, an exceeding great Temple. Macrobius relates,  That the Assyrians ascrib'd to the Sun, call'd Adad, the chief Command over all, and made the Goddess Adargatis his Vice-Roy. Adad's Image shot its Beams downwards, and Adargatis upwards: By the first they gave to under∣stand, That the Power of Heaven consisted in those Sun-beams that reflected on the Earth; and by the second, That all things were drawn up from the Earth. The Arabians offer'd to the Sun daily, on Altars made on the Roofs of their Houses, Frankincense and Myrrh. The same and no other was the Idol Chamis, and Baal-Peor of the Moabites and Midianites. Hieronymus saith,In Esai. 15.2. That in the City Nabo was the Consecrated Idol Chemosh, which was also call'd by a second denomination Baal-Peor. The City Baisampsa, near the Red-Sea, was exceeding famous amongst the Arabians, it being consecrated to the Sun; Sampsa in the Arabian Tongue, as Ste∣phanus witnesses, signifies The Sun: So that Baisampsa is as much as to say, The House of the Sun.Why three peculiar Feasts to the Sun. The Persians held the Sun for their Chief and Supreme Deity, to whose Honor they kept three Feasts yearly, because they observ'd in him Prudence, Benignity, and Omnipotence; and also to express the three Operations of the Sun, by Heat, Splendor, and distinguishing of the Times; or lastly, for its altering the Days, as in Harvest and Summer long, and short in Winter. The Armenians, Massagetes, and Persians offer'd to the Sun a White Horse. Ovid. l. 1. East.To Mithra, for so the Persians call the Sun, that precious Gem call'd Mithri∣dax is consecrated, because according to Pliny and Isidore, the Sun-beams shi∣ning upon it, give it various and still changeable Colours. The Egyptians worshipp'd the Sun under the Name of Osiris: Heliopolis, or The City of the Sun, was most famous amongst them, wherein the Ox Mnevis was dedicated to that Deity.Saturn. l. 1. c. 21. But this Statue of the Sun was in the time of the Egyptian King Sene∣muris carried from thence to Assyria; Apias, an Agent to the Assyrian Standard∣bearer Delebores, brought it thither, which Macrobius describes thus: It is (says he) of massy Gold, without a Beard; in the right Hand it holds a Whip, after the manner of a Rustick; the left Hand holds a Sickle, and an Ear of Corn. Strange Sacrifice to the Sun.The Moors also took the Sun for the chiefest God, calling him Assabin, and offer'd him Sacrifice in the following manner. Their Priests onely had the Liberty to gather Cinnamon, with a Proviso, That they should first kill to the Honor of Assabin forty four Oxen, and as many Goats and Rams; neither should they seek to gather the Cinnamon, but either before or after Sun-set. The Cinnamon-sticks, brought together, were divided by the Priests in Holy Ground. That part which remain'd for the Merchants, was by them carried away as soon as paid for: Then the Priests took every one their part; but if any was imbezilled in the sharing, it was instantly known; for if justly di∣vided, the Sun-beams fir'd the Fragments and broken Pieces that were neglect∣ed and left scatter'd behind, otherwise not; as Theophrastus, Pliny,Heophr Hist. Ph. l. 9. c 5 Plin. l. 12. c. 19. Solin. c. 31. and Solinus aver. The Suns Feast.The ancient Greek Writer Proclus describes a Solemn Feast amongst them, in honor of the Sun, which thus they perform: They hang upon a great Pole store of Laurel, and all manner of Flowers, in the first Quarter of the Moon; then they plac'd on the top of the Staff a great Copper Ball, from which hung many lesser; the middle of the Pole adorn'd with three hundred sixty
five Garlands; the bottom cover'd with a Womans Vestment died yellow. The uppermost Ball signified the Sun; the lesser, the Stars; and the number of Garlands, the Days of the Year. There are scarce any People that have not been guilty, or at least made themselves so, of that Idolatry of Worshipping the Sun: For the far-distant Massagetes worshipp'd the Sun,Herod. lib. 1. as Herodotus relates. The Germans also were ra∣vish'd with the Worship of this Celestial Luminary, before they embrac'd the Christian Religion.Geothic. Rer. lib. 3. cap. 2. Moreover Olaus Magnus relates, That the People in the most Northern Parts of the World pray'd to the Sun, when after a six Months Night it appears above their Horizon, and brings Light and Comfort: And what is more common among the Western Indians, than the Worship of the Sun? For which cause they mock'd at the Spaniards, when they told them of a Savior; telling them, That they had a better God, which appear'd every Morning in Glory. Josephus Acosta relates peculiarly concerning the Peruvians,Hist. Mor. Var. Jud.That they men∣tion'd Viracocha for their Prime Deity; and next him, the Sun; and for the third, Ictillapa, signifying Thunder, a Man arm'd with Stones and a Sling. All three of them are worshipp'd after one manner, viz. with Hands lifted aloft, making a noise like the Smacks of Rusticks, and then praying for what ever they want. In Lusco they offer'd living Children to the Sun. Eastern-Indians have a long time us'd to worship the Sun.Amongst the East-Indians the Sun was Religiously worshipp'd long before the Birth of our Savior. Ctesias relates of them, That they travel yearly fifteen days to an appointed Place, to keep a Feast in honor of the Sun, praying, That it would please him to grant them thirty five days cool Wea∣ther, that they may not be scorch'd, whilst they are coming, worshipping, and returning home.Benjamin Tudelensis the Jew relates also of the Inhabi∣tants of Haaulam (if the Learn'd Vossius takes not Haaulam to be Zeilan, or ra∣ther SumatraAfter seven days Travel I came to Haaulam, which is the be∣ginning of the Kingdom where they worship the Sun in stead of God: A People deriv'd from the Astronomer Chus. The Sun is worshipp'd by them on several great Altars, built in all Places about two Miles distant from the City. They commonly run to meet the Sun early in the Morning, to which stand dedicated several Images on all their Altars, seeming by Necromantick Art to dart Beams, which when the Sun rises, seem to crackle; at which time both Men and Women offer their Sacrifices. Furthermore, it is requisite for us to know how the Japanners, and besides them, many other ancient and late Heathens, amongst their other Deities, wor∣ship the Sun.Arist. de Coelo. lib. 1. cap. 3. The general Opinion of all Men, as Aristotle, Simplicius, Themi∣stius, and others witness, is to place the Omnipotent Godhead in the upper∣most Region that surrounds the Earth;Why the Japanners wor∣ship the Sun. for which cause, those that pray lift up their Hands to Heaven: And since the Heavens represent nothing more glorious than the Sun, that is held for the onely and chief Deity, whether it be for its Beauty and Splendor, or its Bigness, being one hundred and sixty times greater than the Terrestrial Orb; or its quick and sudden Motion, by which it runs ten hundred thousand Miles in an Hour, as they held, the Earth being the Center; or its fecundating Power, whose Warmth preserves all Plants, and is the Breeder and Fosterer of all Living Creatures; or its neces∣sary Light, beneficial for all Humane Affairs; or measuring of the Days by a Motion from the East to the West; or the Seasons of the Year, by a Course from the South to the North, or from the North to the South; or whether
it be, that one Sun performs so many excellent Effects: All these taken to∣gether, amaze the Heathens, who with great admiration wonder at the Myste∣ry thereof, and so honor one of the Celestial Luminaries, in stead of him that Created it.In Symb. Aposs. Thomas Aquinas compares these Idolaters to Countrey Peo∣ple, that entring a Princes Palace, take the first gay Courtier they see, for the King, to whom they make Legs, and shew Reverence, as if he were the same, being deceiv'd by his outward Apparel. But the Japanners differ from the Ancients in their representation of the Sun, which they drew resembling a Beardless young Man, in his prime and vigor, because the Sun neither grows old by Time or Labor: For which rea∣son the Youth at Athens, Rome, and Italy offer'd to the Sun their Hair, when they were first shaven. The Japanners would perhaps signifie the Suns Age by its Beard. Furthermore, the Tortoise which the Sun pricks to turn round, was Religiously worshipp'd long before the Japanners came from China;Plin. lib. 9. cap. 11. fox Pliny relates, That the Troglodites have horn'd Tortoises, which guide themselves in the Water with their Horns; and where-ever they happen to come ashore, they are ador'd as Holy. Netherland Ambassadors leave Meaco.¶ But to return again to the Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst; They de∣parted from Meaco, Anno 1650. the thirtieth of April: But before they left the City, they view'd the great Temple consecrated to Dayboth, and the Cloysters inhabited by the Bonzi, as well without as within the City. A Japan King, about nine hundred years since,Incredible number of Cloysters belonging to the Bonzi. built on the Mountain Fronojama three thousand eight hundred Colledges, of which Nobunanga laid a great part in Ashes: But the Mountain which lies opposite to Meaco had formerly seven thousand such Buildings, in every one of which liv'd ten, fifteen, twenty, or more Priests. One of these Cloysters exceeds in Riches and Beauty all the rest. The Kings, when they prepare for War, promise great Sums of Money to them, for their Enlargement and Maintenance; which they punctually pay, after they have gotten the Victory. To this place poor People, driven by extreme Necessity, take their flight. Every Cloyster hath an Overseer, whom they call Ninxir, that is to say, The Heart of Truth. The Bonzies Employ∣ments.The Office of the Bonzies bred up there, is to Bury and perform the Obse∣quies of the Dead, especially of the Rich; reading and praying before the Statues of their Gods every fifteenth Day, or once in three Months, preaching in publick, and unfolding the Mysteries of their Divine Worship. These are the Seminaries in which they are bred; and here the Masters,How they teach their Youth, according to their manner, give them their Lessons to perfect, and Themes to inlarge upon; the whole Argument consisting in the several Articles of their Faith, and also what they shall say in their Spirit at the last gasp, and how to answer Death and the Devil, when they appear to them most terrible: So setting them their several Tasks, commanding them to perform their Exercise well, and punish∣ing those that are negligent and dull in their Duty. Will not refer their Do∣ctrine to any Princes.They keep up their Doctrine to such a height, that they suffer not Kings, nor the Emperor himself, to decide any Controversie, or intermeddle with any Matter concerning Religion. Father Tursellinus, writing the Life of Xaverius, tells us, That Xaverius had a Hearing granted him before the King of Bungo, to declare at large what he could say concerning the Christian Religion, and to dispute the Articles of
their Faith with any of the Japan Doctors; to which the King listning, and seeming to be taken with several Reasons unfolding divers Mysteries, a Bon∣zi call'd Faciandono (standing by, and perceiving the King to be pleas'd too well, highly offended, broke out in a great rage, saying, That in Matters of Re∣ligion Kings were not competent Judges, being altogether unexperienc'd in the Divinity thereof; and if he pleas'd, he would by the Defence that he should make, utterly con∣vince him in all his Arguments, that had so lately tickled his Ear. So the King being silent, hearkned to, and gave them leave to speak. Whereupon Faciandono be∣gan, after having studied a considerable time, to discourse upon the Grounds of their Faith, and the several Tenents and Mysteries of Religion; to prove the Truth of which, there needed no more than the exemplary Lives of the Bonzi, whose Zeal, Piety, and strictness of Holy-living, must be above all others acceptable to the Gods; first, for their Chastity, and their abstaining from Fresh-fish; their pains and diligence in the Schools, in instructing of Youth in their Divine Knowledge and Philosophical Learning; for gi∣ving to those that pleas'd to receive, after their Deaths, besides Eternal Bliss, ten times as much as they lay down in this World, of which none doubts, or is so impious to question, but at sight to have present payment; for rising at all Hours in the Night, their Watching, and Nocturnal Prayers to their Gods, for the Health, Safety, and Preservation of the People: But that which advanc'd them to the height of Religious Dignity, was their usual Conversation, when rapt up into the Heavens, with the Sun and Moon, and all the Celestial Luminaries. Then he turn'd his ranting Discourse, and fell upon the King; which he not taking well, but much displeas'd at his endless Railing, wanting not much of distraction, the King command∣ed Silence, telling him, That he well remembred one of the Bonzi, a special Pat∣tern of Piety and Sober Life; but he was fitter in his judgment to serve the Devil, and the Fiends of Hell, than be any ways instrumental in the Worship of the Ever-just Gods, Eternal haters of all Debauchery. But Faciandono no ways daunted with this smart Expression of the Kings, but rather more discompos'd, in a rage re∣ply'd thus; Well Sir, the time will come, when such will be my Power and Authority over Mortals, in the other World, that I shall dispose of them at my Leasure, and how I please: And you King of Bungo, though you look so big in all your Greatness now, then shall address your self to me, scarce regarding such a Trifle as a King, or any Prince whatsoever. This arrogant return of his was very ill resented; yet Facian∣dono raising his Voice, ranted higher, saying, May Fire from Heaven consume thee, thou King of Bungo, that darest offer, or once open that thy Mouth, to Blaspheme the holy Priest of the just and ever-living Gods. ¶THe Bonzies are divided into twelve Sects, though some lessen the number. Amongst all of them, those are least esteem'd, that ac∣knowledge Combadaxis for the Learnedst Man.What the Bonzies of Combadaxis Sect are. The Combadaxis-Bonzi have se∣veral Cloysters in the famous Territory of Coja: They lock up themselves in their Habitations, and shave off the Hair of their Heads, as a sign that they for∣sake the World, and take a Holy Life upon them; under which pretence, they act all manner of Debaucheries. Besides a great number of Servants, there dwell in those Parts above six thousand Bonzies. If any Woman dares approach that place, she is immediately punish'd with death. Combadaxis himself liv'd about eight hundred years ago,Combadaxis a great delu∣der. who though a very Villain, yet by his dissimu∣lation and eloquent Language, obtain'd the Name of a Saint. He is held to
be the Inventor of those Characters which the meaner sort of the Japanners use. When Combadaxis attain'd to a great age, he buried himself in a deep square Pit, commanding strictly, That none should open the same; telling them, That he died not; but being wearied and tir'd with the Troubles of this Life on Earth, he went to take rest for a hundred thousand years under Ground; after the expiration of which time, there would a most exceeding Learned Man, call'd Mirozu, appear in Japan; and with that Mirozu he would also re∣turn. Round about his Grave burnt an innumerable company of Lamps, sent thither from all the Japan-Territories; for every one that is of Combadaxis Sect, imagines and believes, That by the giving of those Lamps they shall ob∣tain Earthly Riches; and after death, find Combadaxis to intercede for them in the other World. Bonzi-Neugori much ha∣ted.¶YEt above all others, the Bonzi-Neugori, that have promoted the Deluder Cacubau to the Dignity of a Numen are the most hated; their chiefest Residence, Fatonochaiti, being a meer Den of Murderers: For they live with∣out a Superior, and determine on nothing but with a general Vote; so that oftentimes differing in their Consultations, they fall at variance, and go toge∣ther by the Ears, insomuch that they kill one another. Their strange Conversa∣tion.These Neugori bring up a considerable number of Youths to Thieving and Defrauding of the People: Such as exceed the rest in Wit and Cunning, are chiefly instructed about the Descents and Exploits of the Japan Kings, and State-Affairs; being also exercis'd in Martial Discipline, and taught the Art of Rhetorical Speaking. And thus instructed, they travel to the remotest King∣doms, where they give themselves out to be the Sons of Japan Kings or Prin∣ce, living in another part of the Empire; being the rather credited, because they appear in Kingly Apparel, and carry themselves exceeding Stately: And when they have brought their Game to the height, then they ask for Money, as wanting Bills of Exchange to furnish them for their present Occasions. It is very seldom but they find one or other that will disburse Money for them, upon giving them a Note, not without promise of great Interest. So soon as they have thus fill'd their Purses, they return with the Booty back to their Cloysters: For which cause,Are every where kili'd, if known. if the Neugori from Fatonochaiti are known any where, they are without mercy Ston'd to death. Notwithstanding this hatred which the Japanners bear against them, yet they are afraid of them, because they are very expert in Arms. Their Order is divided into three Sects; some observing their Religion; others make and deliver daily five Arrows a Man; the third sort exercise them∣selves continually in War, not unlike the Knights of Malta;Maintain War. so that they often raise Rebellion against their Princes. Anno 1561. they brought thirty thou∣sand Men into the Field; and Encamping themselves between Meaco and Sac∣cai, fought a great Battel against the Cubus, and getting victoriously into Mea∣co, set the City on Fire. Yet not long after, Success making them negligent and careless, they were surpriz'd, and expell'd with no small Loss: Yet were they not so routed, but that they since encounter'd with the Powerful King Nobunanga; but with such ill Fortune, that most of them were slain on the Spot. The Bouzi-Ikkois are highly esteem'd.¶ ALl the other Bonzies are held in high esteem; and chiefly the twelfth Sect, call'd Ikkois. Their Governor is carried in a Sedan, Kingly Ho∣nor shewn him, and worshipp'd by his Followers.
These Bonzies have great Priviledge beyond the other; for they have leave to be merry, and eat all manner of Food that the Sea and Earth affords. Some of their Temples receive a yearly Revenue out of the Emperors Trea∣sury, or else from the Customs and Tolls growing due in that Countrey where they are founded: Others are maintain'd by the ordinary People. Every one contributes to the Maintenance of his Chappel and Priest to which he belongs; for every Sect of the Bonzi have their Congregation. They never trouble each other about Differences of Religion; nay, the Citizens never dispute about their Opinions in matter of Faith, though their several Sects differ much one from another. Most of their Temples are Houses of Good-fellowship; for which reason, many of them are built in the most delightful Places; where they come often∣times together,The Recreation of the Bonzi. no otherwise than to a Drinking-Club, in the presence of all their Gods. Common Strumpets are brought thither: Conceal'd Adultery the Bonzies wink at. Yet other Bonzies live more retir'd, coming sometimes at Midnight, on certain Hours, together, to say their Prayers; and in order, taking it by turns, perform their Offices, which they read out of the last Book of Xaca, call'd, Foquequium, before their Altars. In the Evening every one hath his Task set him, to get by Heart against Morning, and to declare it to the Head Bonzies. ¶ BUt the Bonzies of the eleventh Sect exceed the rest in a strict and retir'd Life; for they abstain from Women, and all manner of Food that ever lived; and if it be known to the Magistrates, that any of them hath transgress'd,Strange Punishment in∣flicted on some Criminal Bonzies. or broken his Vows, the Criminal is put into a Hole, and co∣ver'd half way with Earth, being made fast in the same; and every one that passes by, though it be a Nobleman, must give a cut with a Wooden Saw on the Neck of the half-buried Priest: So that generally it is the fourth day be∣fore he comes to his End. Why the Bonzies are high∣ly esteem'd.¶ A Retir'd and Abstinent Life brings the Bonzies into great esteem; and therefore several of their Sects live onely on Pot-herbs, Water, and Rice. Besides, many Bonzies are of Noble and Princely Extract; for when the Fathers are over-charg'd with Children, fearing to leave them but small Shares, they put some of them into Cloysters, to the end their Goods at the time of their Death may go the farther, and that so they may keep up their Family. The Bonzies Sermons.¶ THe Doctrines which the Bonzi teach, are commonly Reprehensions against Worldly Care, by which the ordinary Man is so taken up, that he minds nothing of the Laws tending to Salvation; for which the Bon∣zi proffer their Service, to take upon them their Offences, and sue for their Pardon from the Gods; so that none shall be damn'd, how great soever their Sins are; for the Gods will deliver them from the Flames of Hell-fire: Yet with this Proviso, If they set a high esteem on, and are bountifully liberal to the Bonzi that intercede for them. Women and poor People can scarce be sav'd.This Promise of Salvation is only to Rich and Eminent People; but for the Poor People, there is no Redemption from Hell. The Womens Conditi∣on is also very bad, not withstanding they give great Presents to the Bonzi, be∣cause by their natural Purgations they are stain'd with many filthy and grie∣vous Sins, so that it is very hard for them to attain to Salvation.
Bonzi give Bills of Ex∣change.The Bonzi also, in their Publick Preachings, declare, That those that give them any Money, shall receive the same again, with ten times the Interest, in the Life to come. And since few there are that misdoubt so great a gain, the Bonzies have labor enough to make them Bills of Exchange for their Mo∣ney, which they preserve very carefully; and chiefly, all dying Persons give strict charge, that they bury the foremention'd Bills with them, that so they may receive both Principal and Interest in the other World; and also because the Devil flies from all such Papers. Description of the Bon∣zies Preaching.The Bonzies make their Sermons in a handsom manner; for he that Preach∣es, stands on a high Pulpit, hung round about with a rich Japan Cloth: The Ascent thereof is made on the right side, not without curious Rails and Steps: On the left side sits an Idol, with his Legs under him, after the Japan manner, on a high Altar, either of Amida, Xaca, Canon, or any other, according to the Sect of which the Bonzies are. Next to the Idol, are those that bring Offer∣ings, being all manner of Dainties; which after performance of Service, they and the Bonzies together devour. Both the Idol and Offerers sit on a high Seat, rail'd about. Over the Pulpit is a square Covering, which rests forward on two thick Pillars, made fast behind in the Walls. On the top also hang on both sides of the Preacher two burning Lamps, each hanging by four Strings, and with as many Lights. Before the Pulpit stands a square Scaffold, rail'd in on three sides, and three Foot in height; in the middle of which stands the Pulpit: On this Scaffold sit or stand the Readers or Servants to the Bonzies: In the Pulpit lies the Holy Book of Foquequium; and near it, a Shell. The Priest getting into the Pulpit, looks a considerable time about him: In his right Hand he holds a broad golden Fan; his Head is cover'd with an Umbrello of Silk, not much unlike a Straw Hat. Before he speaks aloud, he makes a great shew in silence of his intended Design. Lastly, he rings the Bell, as a Sign commanding Silence; after which, none makes the least noise. Then the Priest begins to read some Rules out of their Law-Book Foquequium, on which he makes a long Sermon. Bonzi speak well in their Sermons.Gasper Villela, well-experienc'd in the Japan Tongue, relates, That he hath oftentimes admir'd the excellent Language of the Bonzi, which are no ways inferior to any Greek or Latin Preachers, either in their compleat Behavior and elegant Style, or for their curious Words, and moving Arguments to their purpose. The Nobleness of their Discourse borrows also a little from the Lustre of their Apparel; for the Minister standing on a rich Stool, is cloth'd in Silk from Head to Foot; about his Middle is ty'd a broad Gir∣dle. The Applications to their Sermons are commonly these, or the like:After what manner they end their Sermons. It is requisite to bestow good and plentiful Gifts on the Cloysters, because Priests reside in them, that intercede for Men to the Gods, by their Prayers and Pious Works; so that in this Life they receive Worldly Blessings by their means, and in the Life to come, ten times more than they bestow on the Bonzi. Description of the Audi∣tors in the Japan Temples.The Auditors flock in great numbers to their Churches, which are generally cramm'd full to the very Doors. At the sound of a Bell they all fall on their Knees, and pour forth a Prayer with great Zeal; this continues a whole Hour. Their Hands and Beads they lift up towards Heaven, (for they are us'd by them, crying often very loud, Namu Amida ambut, that is, Amida give Salvation; which Prayer is onely us'd by that Sect which acknowledge Amida for their God and Preserver. Others call upon Xaca, Canon, or any other Idols; yet the greatest number believe in Amida: Wherefore the Poor, when
they ask for Alms, cry, Ichinem Amida but Sucumet Muriro zai; that is, Who∣ever calls upon the Holy Name of Amida with an upright Heart, shall be sav'd. During the time that one of the Bonzi preaches, the rest sit one by another on the Steps of the Altar, with their Hands wrapp'd in their Coats, and their Eyes cast downwards. All the twelve Sects affirm, That none can be sav'd without the Holy Book Foquequium; but as for other things, they differ in their Opinions. Those that shew Reverence to the Idol Canon, Amida's Son, would be taken for the most Pious and Religiousest Persons, going with their Beads in their Hands, and praying in all places without ceasing. The Bonzies Sects differ amongst themselves.Moreover, the Bonzi, according to their several Sects, wear different Ap∣parel; some going in Black, others in Gray; between which two, great Con∣tests and Quarrels oftentimes arise. And as there are a vast number of these Bonzies in Japan, so there are also an incredible company of the Clerks be∣longing to them: For every one hath free liberty to be of either of the twelve Sects, when he betakes himself to the voluntary Retirements of a Cloyster. And also the Japanners.In like manner, all the Japanners embrace and hold with that Sect which they fancy best; so that oftentimes in one Family, the Father is of one Sect, the Children of another, and the Mother differs from both. Some hold, That there are three hundred and fifty Commandments; yet all agree, That there are five Principal ones, which observ'd, make Men capable of Salvati∣on; namely, Not to murder, Not to steal, Not to commit adultery, Not to lie, and, To abstain from Wine.In what they all agree. All of them believe and affirm, That their Gods suf∣fer'd willingly long and painful Tortures, that they might free every one that really believes in those Sufferings, and worships them with Zeal, and an upright Heart. In their Devotions they use (as Xaverius relates) long Strings, with round Knobs or Beads; and at the end of every Prayer, they turn over or let fall one of them.
¶ FUrthermore, the Japan Idolatry is mixt with many pleasant, or rather ridiculous Fantasies; as amongst others things they affirm,Xaca, how often born. That Xa∣ca was Born eight thousand times; which Opinion seems somewhat to agree with the Doctrine of the Bramines,Wistnow born ten times. whose Supreme Deity Wistnow took upon him to have been bom eight times, and that first he appear'd in the shape of a Fish call'd Matsja, to pursue a Raetsjasja, who was fled into the Sea with four parts of the Heathens Law-Book, but he was overtaken and kill'd by Wistnow. The second time he took upon him the shape of a Tortoise, because the Moun∣tain Merouwa was thrown into the Ocean, that Amortan, that is, Dispeller of the Poyson Callecote Wisjam might be found; but the Mountain weigh'd so exceed∣ing heavy, that it began to sink, which forc'd Wistnow to transform himself into a Tortoise, that he might bear up the World on his back; but though the Tortoise carrys the World on its back, yet he is carry'd by the Hog call'd Sers∣ja, and Leesja is bore up by the Sea: The third time, Wistnow appear'd like a Hog, wherefore a Hog growing out of the Earth, in the famous Temple Adi Warraha in the City Trinottam, was religiously Worshipp'd. The fourth time he appear'd like half a Man, and half a Lion: The fifth time, by the name Wai∣nana, on purpose to subdue the Devil Belli, and soon after he became Paresje Ra∣ma, Dajerratha Rama, Cristna, Bouddha, and the Horse Celki: His chiefest appear∣ance was when he became Cristna; for as the Bramine Padmanaba related to Abraham Rogerius,The Gate to Paganism, 2, k. 3. That Wistnow appear'd in all his other shapes but with part of his Godly Glory, as a spark of Fire which flies from a great Coal; but that in Cristnaes shape he appear'd in full Splendor, with all the Host of Hea∣ven attending him; insomuch, that the Heavens were empty and without a God. Little Japan gods.¶ THe Japanners have besides their chief, also lesser Deities, which they call Fotoques and Camos; the first were Priests, which many Ages before taught their Doctrine: The second valiant Hero's, who by their Noble Atchievements, or new Inventions, made their Names famous. The Fotoquis procur'd such things as were necessary to Salvation, and the Camo's Temporal Blessings. Their gods Nequiron, and Denichi Maristines, preside matters of War:Difference of their gods. but Daibut, Tamondea, Besamondes, Hemocondis, and Zajolis, busie themselves in or∣dering the Course of the Heavens. The Sects of the Bonzies are twelve.¶ THe Sects into which the Bonzi divide themselves, Xaverius reckons nine: But Caron in his Description of Japan, sets down twelve: The Xingovini Bonzi, honor the Idol Dinichi; the Jenxuani,serve Fobem; the Foquexa∣ni, their Mion; the Jondaxuenses, Amida; the Xintani, Quoquium; the Baracacque spend their time in Study; the Icoxuani teach, That there is nothing more re∣quisite to Salvation, than the Merits of Amida; so that nothing can be more to his prejudice, than for any one to depend on their own good Works, for so much as a man ascribes to himself of Salvation; so much he bereaves of the honor of Amida, who alone merited Salvation. Icoxi Bonzi.Over the Icoxuani, or Icoxi, a prime Bonzi, hath the Command, who com∣monly, though addicted to all manner of Vices, yet is highly esteem'd by the People; insomuch, that they often fall down, crying before him, entreat∣ing him to Intercede for them, and sue for a Pardon and Forgiveness of their Offences. The Neugori place Cacubau for their Chief and Supreme Deity, and
are divided into Praying, Arrow-making and Fighting-Persons. The Legi-Oxi judge the Hamacuten Clerks to be of the same Order. The Jamambuxi, who af∣ter sixty days suffering all Inconveniences, are Install'd by the Devil himself, who appears to them in a horrible manner, on the top of the Mountain Fusino∣jamma; their Prayers the common People buy for great sums of Money: But the twelfth Sect of the Bonzies are the Ikkois,Ikkoi's Bonzi. whose Respect and Power exceeds all the other: Then Gengues, Harboribonzjj, and Jammoboos, are also Japan Priests, extracted out of Asia, and experienc'd in Necromantick Arts; but because of their poor and mean condition, and their solitary life, they are not accounted amongst the Bonzies. The Feast Gibbon, how kept.¶THe Deceits and Fictions of the Bonzies may be plainly discern'd by the Feast-days which they chiefly observe. In August, the Japanners have a Holiday which they call Gibbon, (which word signifies A Man) and is Consecrated to Men. This day is kept in the follow∣ing manner. They erect Scaffolds in every corner of the City, according to the number of Handicrafts-men; when the day is come, the multitudes flock together, no otherwise than to a great Feast, fifteen, or sometimes twenty Wag∣gons cover'd with rich Silk Clothes lead the way, every one of which is drawn by forty Men. In every Waggon sits a great number of Youths, singing and playing on Drums or Pipes; the Men and Women of every several Trade or Company, buy their own Waggon: Soon after, more Waggons follow with Arm'd Men, in like manner cover'd with Silk Clothes, on which are Painted the Valiant Exploits and Noble Atchievements of antient Japan Hero's. This Train passes along slowly by their Temple: Against the Evening, two Sedans are brought out of the Temple, in one of them sits the Idol whom they Wor∣ship, and in the other his Consort: The bearers of the first Sedan seem'd to swoon under it, being so exceedingly oppress'd by the presence of the God-head; but soon after appears the Sedan in which the Idols Goddess sits, she being ad∣vised by Messengers, that her Husband comes to meet her with his Concubine, the bearers of the Sedan run to and again like Distracted Persons, by which they express the great sorrow which the Goddess receives by her just anger for the Idol her Husbands Adultery; and whilst the bearers of the Sedan run thus madly up and down, the People cry aloud after them, pittying the condition of the Goddess, comforting and Praying to her on their bended Knees: At last, the three Sedans are brought together, and are set down in their Temple, which done, Gibbon's Feast ends. The bloody feast of Ma∣ristenes.¶ FOr their God of War, Maristenes, they keep a bloody day in Lent; after Noon, they all flock together, every one having the Picture of his Image Painted on his shoulder; upon a sudden, they divide themselves in two Parties, the Boys beginning first to throw Stones, which done, the graver and older Persons of both sides go forth between the Youths, their first business then is to exchange a Bullet or two, then drawing nearer to one another, they pull out their Japan Scymiters, and fight so long, till one or other of them lea∣ving the Field, betakes themselves to flight. Amida's feast, how kept by the Icoxi Bonzi.¶ THe Icoxi Bonzi keep yearly a Feast to the honor of Amida, to which flock such multitudes, that many times several are crouded to death in the Cloyster-door, nay, some fall down wilfully to be trampled to death, thinking,
that by that means they shall go to Amida: At night, a Bonzi makes a Funeral Sermon over the departed, extolling, and highly applauding his gallant Reso∣lution, whilst the multitude make a doleful Lamentation over the Corps. Description of the Japan Wrestlers.¶ BUt besides these strange Customs belonging to their Religion, the Japan∣ners have also several bodily Exercises, amongst which, Wrestling is none of the meanest: The place wherein they Wrastle is surrounded with a square Rail, about which the Spectators stand, and look over it, reaching up to their middle; on a Hillock, under a square Roof, supported by four Pillars, the Judge of the Field hath his Seat: The Wrestlers put their Hair under a Net, made in the fashion of a Cap, which they draw close, and make fast on the Crown of their Heads, from whence hangs a small String over their Backs; their Bodies from the middle upward are quite Naked, onely about their sides and Backs they wear a Copper Plate, with the Emperors Arms Ingraven there∣on, open on their Breasts, and made fast about their Middle with two Cords; the like kind of Plates they tie also on their Skins; their Breeches are ty'd up betwixt their Legs with two Strings made fast to the Plates. Thus Accouter'd, they fall very eagerly one upon another, he that Throws his Antagonist, goes to the Hill on which the Judge stands, and receives Silver or Golden Plates, sometimes mark'd with the Emperors Arms, and sometimes not. It may not be contradicted, but that the Japanners have the same intention in these Exercises, as formerly the Greeks and Romans had, which was to make them expert in War, and accustom their bodies to labor;Art. Gymuast. l. 5. c. 5. for Hieronimus Me∣curialis cites out of Hypocrates, That Wrastling warms and strengtheneth the Flesh, Sinews, and Nerves. Theodorus Priscianus judges this Exercise also to be good against a bad and cold Stomach: and Oribasius reckons it a notable re∣medy against the Dropsie. Other Physitians (on the contrary) are as much against it, especially, if done with eagerness; but the Wisdom and Custom of Antiquity may well over-poise their single and more novel Opinions.
De Legib. And to prove, that Wrestling is very antient, Theseus King of Athens, Train'd up all his young Soldiers to die War, first with that Exercise. Plato sets down Antheus and Circion,Who were the first Wrest∣lers, for Inventers of that Art, in which, those employ'd them∣selves, which afterwards gave proofs of their Experience in Races. Besides the Heathens, the antiquity of this Recreation appears by Moses, who relates, That the Patriarch Jacob Wrestled with God, and became Lame thereby: Therefore the Children of Israel eat not of the Sinew which shrank,Gen. 32. v. 32. which is upon the hollow of the Thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's Thigh, in the Sinew that shrank. Stately bridge in Meaco.¶ THe Ambassadors, Fristius and Brookhurst, Riding on the thirtieth of April, Anno 1650. from Meaco, were amaz'd at the costly Bridge over which they pass'd out of the City. This Bridge, being two hundred and thirty Paces long, leads over the River which cuts Meaco in the middle, and rests on large Columns, hewn out of a Rock; the top being very strait, is Wall'd on both sides with Stone, Adorn'd and Beautifi'd with great Brazen Balls. The Ambassadors Din'd that day in the delightful Village Fissima, where they hired four Barks to Sail down the River to Osacca, passing by the City Jonda,Castle of Jonda. defended with a strong Castle, continually supply'd with fresh Water by two Mills. Over the River lie two Artificial Bridges, not unlike that of Meaco. It appears, that the Antient and Modern World hath spent much time with no less Art than Charges, to make the Waters flow faster than their ordinary Course.Bridge of Trajanus. Famous is that Bridge, which the Emperor Trajan laid over the Danou, the greatest River in Europe. Paulus Jovius relates, That in his time there were yet remaining of it thirty six Arches, hewn out of square Stone, eve∣ry one a hundred and fifty Foot high, sixty broad, and a hundred and seventy Foot distance one from another. Slaughter-Bridg of Caligula.And who hath not read Writers, of the Slaughter-Bridge, made by Caligula? This cruel Tyrant caus'd the In-let between Baja and Puteoli, be∣ing three thousand and six Paces long, to be laid over with Vessels, two and two ty'd together, and made fast with Anchors, which Ships he cover'd with Planks, and the Planks with Earth: Over this new Way he Rode to and fro, the first day on a stately Horse, on his Head a Garland Pleited of Oak, his Body cover'd with a Cloke of Gold, in his Hand he carry'd an Ax: The second day he sat in a Chariot, Darius the King of Parthia's Son walking before, and the Roman Nobility following him: On the third day, a considerable number of Spectators came flocking thither, which were all thrown into the Sea. Wonderful Bridge at Peru.The Art of the Americans of Peru, deserves also our Observation; for be∣tween Chicuito and Callao in Peru, is a Lake no less broad than deep, over which leads a Bridge of Rushes, Pleited together in such a manner, and made so fast on both sides, that great Loads may pass over the same without any danger. From whom the Ja∣panners learn'd to make Bridges.¶ But it appears, that the Japanners brought the Art of making Bridges from their Native Countrey China; for there is scarce any place in the World that hath gain'd so much Reputation in that particular as the Chineses, either for their Curiosity, or great number; insomuch, that some eminent Cities, as Nanquin, Hancheu, and others, reckon every one above ten thousand Bridges, in all which there is a Vie of Art, and curious Workmanship.
The Bridge Cientao.In the Territory of Xensi, between the Cities Hanchen and Siganfu, lies that marvellous Bridge Cientao: to the building of which Changleang, General to the Emperor Lieupang, employ'd several hundred thousand Men, besides his whole Army, some cutting a Way through the Mountains, some securing and making even the Valleys, other carrying Timber cross the River, and ram∣ming in Pillars of exceeding bigness, and supporting them by lesser Arms on both sides. Chogan's Bridge.The Bridge that leads betwixt two high Mountains over the River Fi, near Chogan, merits admiration, consisting of one Arch, four hundred Yards broad and fifty Rods high, the Sides strengthned with Stone Curtains. Bridge on Chaina.In the Countrey Junnan, the Emperor Mingus rais'd a Bridge about sixteen hundred years since, of twenty great Iron Chains, made fast betwixt two Rock sover a mighty Water-fall; which Chains he cover'd with huge Tim∣ber, and large Planks, which (when any great weight passeth over it) moves to the amazement and terror of the Traveller. Gangin-Bridge.The Bridge in the Town Gangin is also very famous for its Foundress, who after the Decease of her Husband, Parents, and nearest Relations, spent all her Treasure that she had on the building of it; and the Work being finish'd, she leap'd into the River and drown'd her self. Loyang-Bridge, above all wonderful.But the Bridge Loyang in Civenchau, the second Metropolis in the Territory of Fokien, exceeds all the former, being three hundred and sixty Rods long, and one and a half broad, cost the Governor Cayang fourteen hundred thousand Du∣cats, and would have cost twenty times more, if the Chinese Laborers were not forc'd to work on all Structures for the publick good for nothing, onely the neediest have some small matter for their daily Labor. All the Bridge consists of black shining Stones; and is not supported by Arches, but rests on three hundred great Pedistalls, made like a Ship, sharp before, purposely to break the steep of the Water: on whose uppermost part lie from Pillar to Pillar five large Stones of an equal bigness, every one eighteen Paces long, two broad, and of like thickness, and make up the number of fourteen hundred. The Defences on both sides are adorn'd, besides other curiosities, with Lyons hewn out of Stone, standing upon high Pedistalls: This is the form of the Bridge from the City to the Castle; but on the other side of the Castle the remaining part is somewhat smaller. Bridge Tiensen.The Bridge Tiensen, near the City Liping, made over the River Tanki, con∣sists of one Stone. Of this kind of wonderful Stone China it self is able to produce more than all the rest of Asia, Europe, Africa, and America; therefore we may easily guess from whence the Japanners learn'd the building of artificial Bridges. ¶ THe Netherland Ambassadors leaving the City Jonda, got about the Evening beyond the handsom Village Firaskatta, and about two a Clock in the Morning to Osacca. Description of the wild Japan-Bonzi▪Along the Way which they came, resided many wild Bonzies, which gene∣rally go two and two together, wearing tatter'd and torn Apparel, through which in many places their naked Bodies appear. They never Shave their Beards, nor Cut the Hair of their Heads, so that they appear like wild and sal∣vage Men. But though they Cut not their Hair, yet they Pare their Nails, because they may not be so much like the Dairo, who neither Cuts his Hair nor his Nails. On their Heads they wear six-corner'd Caps, wrought like a
Net, two Points sticking upright, two before, and as many behind. They are always provided with Table-Books to Write in, a Cloth, a Calabash, and a Chain of small Horns, by which they tell over their Prayers. Their Temples stand on the very top of the Mountains, to which commonly a craggy bro∣ken Ascent leads. These wild Saints are in great esteem with the Japanners, generally spend∣ing their time amongst sick and dead Persons, with whom they sit whole Nights muttering in their holy Language (which differs quite from the com∣mon Japan Tongue,) without ceasing their Prayers to reconcile the Sick and Dead with their gods Amida, Xaca, Canon, or any other Idol, which in their life and prosperity they served. A large Description of the strong Castle in Osacca.¶ THe Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst being got to Osacca, went and addressed themselves on the third of May to the Governor and Com∣mander of the Castle, to present them (according to the Custom) with several Presents. By which means they had an opportunity to view the Fortress, be∣ing three Leagues in the outermost Circumference; it stands about two Mile to the Southward of Osacca, on a Hill belonging to the City, so that it looks down on all the other Buildings, and is the glory of the Province of Osacca; for here the richest Merchants reside, the meanest of which commonly poffess thirty thousand Crowns. The Castle is built of blew Stone rarely polish'd, and each a Fathom long; the Walls are rais'd to an equal heighth. Depth and breadth of the Moats.The Retinue of the Netherland Ambassadors relate, That standing on the Edges of the Walls, and looking down on the Moat, their Eyes dazled, that being also exceeding deep: The Ground of the outmost Trench being cover'd with three and thirty Foot Water, is three hundred and ninety broad. The same depth hath the inner Moat, but wants a hundred and forty in breadth. Who made the Castle Osacca so big, and why.None hath bestowed more Cost and Charges towards the building of this Castle, making it the eighth wonder of the World, than the Emperor Taicosama,
who falling sick in Fissima, troubled himself exceedingly for his young Son Fideri, his sole design being to settle him in the Throne, and make him Mo∣narch of the Japan Empire. Amongst many other cunning and subtile Inventions to bring the fore∣mention'd Design to pass, he caus'd the Castle of Osacca to be made much larger, and more invincible; whilst his Sickness grew daily to a greater heighth, he set thousands at work to finish this new Structure. Within the Walls stood above seventeen thousand Houses, which in three days time were all pull'd down: the Rubbish every one was commanded, on forfeiture of their Goods, to carry away in four and twenty hours: Those whose Houses were pull'd down, had Ground provided in a spacious Field to build on, according to the Marks made by Surveyors in a direct Line. The new City went on with no less speed than the enlarged Castle, about which Taicosama was exceedingly concern'd, sending Messenger after Messenger to forward the Work. He had by this time chosen five Councellors of State, who with Ongoschio should be Guardians of Fideri, binding them all by Oath, That when Fideri came to be fifteen years old, they should Crown him Emperor; but because his Decease might occasion some Insurrection, the Japan Kings being ambiti∣ous of higher Authority, he thought if convenient to get them out of their own Provinces, and by securing so disenable them; to which purpose the Castle in Osacca was the most convenient Place, whether they were commanded to remove their Courts from Fissima. The Charges of so great a removal were born by Taicosama. Civil War in Japan.But though Taicosama had order'd all things with so much prudence before his Death, yet notwithstanding soon after all Japan was turmoil'd in a Civil War. The Councellors of State took up Arms against Ongoschio, who be∣ing Conqueror in a Field-Battel, march'd with his victorious Army to Osacca, where the Castle, that (being nobly stor'd with all manner of Ammunition and Necessaries) might have endur'd the greatest Siege imaginable, was by the cowardly Commander thereof, Morindono, treacherously deliver'd up, that otherwise would have proved an invincible Fort. Description of the migh∣ty Out-works of the Ca∣stle Osacca.After which time Fideri kept a most magnificent Court there; but was at last set upon by his Father-in-law Daifusama, and burnt with the innermost Castle; which Loss at last was renew'd and made good, for the Edifice was re-built much costlier than before, according to the splendor in which at pre∣sent to admiration it may be seen: The Out-work is rais'd from the bottom of the Moat with gray Stone a Foot above the Ground, and built with Inlets according to the Bulwarks. Near the three Gates they appear higher and higher: and the Stone-Walls about the Moat rise above the Water a hundred and eighty three Foot; on whose top stand Breast-works of Clay, Plaister'd on both sides with Mortar. The chiefest Fortifications have on their Out-points large Towers three Stories high made of Stone; two of the Stories have peculiar Roofs, that jet over the Walls; but the uppermost is smaller: yet the Chambers are very pleasant and convenient to discover any Enemy at great distance. In these Towers, being sixteen in number, lies an incredible store of all manner of Ammunition, as Darts, Armor, Helmets, Shields, Javelins, Battel-Axes, Swords, Pikes, Daggers, large Knives, Skeans, Match, Bandileers, Bowes, Mortar-Pieces, Builets, Musquets, Fire-hooks, and other Japan Arms.
The Way towards the Gate of the Castle after what manner.To the chiefest Gate leads a Cawsie, made over the Moat, on both sides fortifi'd with a Stone-Defence, joynd to the Out-works, and reaches to the top of the Wall, being even with the Gate; whose Square is cover'd with a Roof that runs taporing behind and before: Passing through this Porch you enter into a Quadrangular Court, on all sides Fenced with a high Wall; on the left-side stands a great Tower, and within on the righ-side of the Entry through the Gate a fair Watch-house; from hence a Way leads under the Tower through an Entry into a spacious Court: on the left-side thereof is a long square Inlet, whose Entrance inwardly faces the interior Castle. An Inlet in the Castle full of Palaces.Here are divers Palaces, which Taicosama caus'd to be built, forcing the Japan Princes to remove thither. They are very large, within full of spacious Rooms, and without shewing several Courts, being no less convenient than costly: But on the right-hand of the first Plain lies a third, two of whose Walls are those that belong to the Castle: The third Wall parts this square Inlet from another long one: The fourth stands near the spacious Palace; and here the Gate ap∣pears which leads to the Plain, where several sumptuous Edifices are erected. A long Inter with dou∣ble Walls.Next you come to a long Inlet with double Walls, the outermost rising from the Moat, hath many handsom Palaces, whose Roofs appear above Osacca: they being built on the upper Ground of the Works, the inner Wall runs half way between the outermost, and another which surrounds the first Moat of the inner Castle. Adjoyning to this appears another Inlet, not so long as the first, yet adorn'd with several large Fabricks, though inferior to the other in beauty. Above this lesser Court the out-Wall hath two Indentings; in the last stands a square Platform, with a very strong and neat Watch-house; from the Plat∣form a Wall runs direct against the Breast-work, which goes through the Moat, rising in heighth from the Out-works to the second Gate;The second Front-Gate. which is not much unlike the first, and looks inwardly on a square Plain, inclos'd within a Wall, having on the left-side a Corps de Guarde close by the Wall, and on the right a a high Turret on the Breast-work. Somewhat farther appears a long Plain, encompassed with Buildings, but of an ordinary sort. This Plain is within fortifi'd with a double Bulwark, and without with one of the sixteen Towers. Ware-houses.Over the Bridge next the Wall, stand two Store-houses, the one bigger than the other: on the sides of which a Wall runs cross, beginning at the outward Fortification, and ends against the inclosure of the inner Moat. Not far from the Front of the little Store-house are two opposite Gates, to which you go betwixt two Stone-Walls, one rais'd against the inner Trench, the other parts three by-Ways from the common Road between the two Gates. The first of these Streets is the largest, and adorn'd with several fair Edifices; from which you go into another also full of curious Buildings; the Way that goes out of it brings you into the foremention'd Road between the two Gates; the third lies before the third Gate likewise square, and hath a great Bank, or Cawsie, over which they pass to the outward Gate. This Plain, or Court boasts on the right-side of its Entrance on the inner Wall, a stately Hall, under which you go to the inclosed Street; whose right-side Wall reaches a considerable way farther than the left, and ends near a Gate not far from the Bridge of the inner Castle. This Gate being exceed∣ing high, they go down a sloaping Bridge to that spacious Plain, where, as we said before, most of the Palaces are seen in a Wall'd Street. On each

side of the Bridge stand Ware-houses of Stone,Store-houses against Fire. built for safeguard against Fire; whereof two are built against the inner Moat, seven against the outer Wall, and behind five more, which all serve to keep the Emperor's Treasure from any Casualties of Fire. Description of the inner Castle.The inner Castle, surrounded by a Moat of two hundred and fifty Foot broad, and thirty three Foot deep, with great Banks on each side strengthned with Breast-works; that rise higher and higher towards the Gate, which being Plated over with Copper, gives Entrance to a broad Street, ending near a square Market-Place. But the second Gate lies on the other side of the Forti∣fications, where the Trench is not fill'd up, but an exceeding costly Bridge lies over it, the Rails being Plated over with Gold, and the Gate also,A Gate Plated over with Gold. inso∣much much that they are valu'd at several Tuns of Gold. Within this Gate appears a spacious Court inclos'd with Stone-Walls; on the right-side thereof stands a small Gate, through which they pass to a large Wall'd Street, and at the end of that to another more stately, Fronting a long Plain, wherein stand three great Store-houses against Fire, in which the chief∣est Treasure of the Emperor is kept. Treasure of the Japan Emperor.The Riches stor'd up here can scarce be numbred; for if the Japan Emperor, according to Caron's account, spends Annually on his Lords in his Courts and Life-guards above two thousand four hundred Tuns of Gold, and yet hoards up continually, we may easily conjecture, that the Treasures hid in this Place are unvaluable. The Wall of the inner Castle.The Wall of this inner Castle appears above the Water one hundred sixty three Foot, being raised of gray Stone, and strengthned with twelve Forts, in each of which a strong Tower. Here lies stor'd up all manner of Ammuni∣tion, either for Horse or Foot, either to lay a Siege, or endure one. Third Fort.Near the Center of the Burrough appears a third Fort; which is seen above all other Buildings, the Foundation being raised on a blue Stone-Wall, built square after the manner of a Castle, surrounded with Bulwarks: the Stones being very large are neatly joyn'd together, rising from the upper Ground of the Castle, little less than two hundred Foot. The Emperors Banquet∣ting-house.In this Place stands also the Emperors Banquetting-house: the lower Story consists in spacious Arched Galleries, built; the first Roof jetting ove the Windows and Entrances; over the first Story are five more, each one as you go higher growing less than the other, so that on the second Story are seven great Halls; as also on the third, but much lesser: the fourth numbers six; the fifth, five; and the sixth, four. The first and second Roofs are cover'd with Stone, the third and fourth with Lead, the fifth with Copper, and the uppermost with Tyles of Massie Gold. An open Place of Re∣creation.After the same manner is the Roof adorn'd of another open Place, wherein the Emperor recreates himself, which standing on one side of the Tower joyns on the top to a stately Seraglio, full of the Emperors Concubines. Two Places.But on the other side of the Tower appear two Royal Buildings more, erected against the blue Wall: the Floors in each of them are cover'd with a thousand Mats, every one six Foot and a half long, and four and a half broad; before the Palaces is a square Court Wall'd in, where upon one side appears a Gate beautifi'd with two Golden Balls, which leads to the Stables,Stabies, all co∣ver'd with Golden Plates. Not tar from thence stands another Gate, through which they must pss before they can come into the inner Castle.
There are also several pleasant Gardens,Gardens. with delightful Banquetting-houses near the two foremention'd Palaces; in which the Emperor walks oftentimes when he keeps his Court in the Castle of Osacca. A pleasant Mount.Hard by the Gardens is an artificial Mount, with a curious House on the top; in the Front whereof are six Store-houses against Fire: in three of which the Emperor keeps his Silver, and in the other his Gold. These kind of stately Buildings are another testimony of the Japanners Ex∣tract from China; for indeed no Place in the Universe boasts so many marvel∣lous Structures as that mighty Empire of China. A strange Mountain of those that make the Devil their Father-Confessor.¶ NOt far from this famous Castle is that high Mountain, on which the Jamabusci climb yearly, to perform the following Service to their black god Goquis, that is, the Devil, appearing to them in humane shape. They walk one by one towards Goquis, and repeat their sins in such a mournful note, that they are heard by the whole Company; and whilst they thus spend their time, a Sword hangs pendant in the Air; according to Peter Davity's Descripti∣on of Asia. This kind of presentation occasions a strange alteration amongst the Spe∣ctators, some Laughing, and others Crying: those that have confess'd right return with the multitude; but those that conceal their sins, are by Goquis thrown down the Hill, so breaking their Necks. The Netherland Ambas∣sadors departure from Osacca.¶ THe Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst having dispatch'd their Affairs in Osacca, took Shipping the sixth or May about the Evening, but the Wind being Westerly, they made little Way; yet at last getting out of the River, they entred the Sea, and left Sacai on their Larboard, and near it the great Temple, built by the Dairo, and in the City the Temples built by the Saccaians to the honor of Daimaogini. A strange Feast of the Idol Daimaogini.This Daimaogini is held for a Saint, having been a Companion of an ancient Japan Emperor. His Feast they keep holy in a detestable manner in July; the me∣thod this: First they block up the greatest Streets of the City with Timber and Planks, onely leaving one place open about two hundred Paces, into which the ordinary People may not so much as look. In the afternoon the Idol Daimao∣gini is brought forth amongst a vast number of Men. The Idol Riding in the Front on Horseback, with a naked Scymiter in his Hand, betwixt two Youths, the one carrying Daimaogina's Bowe and Arrows, the other his Hawk; after these comes a handsom Cavalcade in several Divisions, with peculiar Marks; then a Company of Foot, who by Promise are oblig'd to tend upon their Idol on that Day: these Dance and Sing after the former, often crying aloud, Xenzaira-quu, Manzaira-quu, that is, A thousand years of joy, ten thousand times ten thousand joys: next these come the Bonzies, Singing Eulogies in praise of their Idol; then all the Nobility of Saccai, well Mounted in good Order; in the last Rank six Witches Clothed in Linnen, and accompany'd with a great number of Women, which continually mutter Charms and Incantations amongst themselves; then the whole Procession ends with a considerable num∣ber of Armed Men. So at last the whole Train marches to the Street that is inclos'd with Planks, from whence they fetch Daimaogina's Settle-bed; which being Gilded all over is brought forth on the Shoulders of twenty stout Men, with continual Singing variety of Sonnets, the chief being the beforementi∣on'd Xenzaira-quu, Menzaira-quu; so soon as the Settle-bed is seen, they throw
Gotzenhaus ausserhalb Sackai De Groote TEMPEL Buyten Saccay The great TEMPLE without Saccay.
Money amongst the common People to scramble for, and religiously wor∣ship the Bed. Description of the great Temple near Saccai.¶ THe Temple near Saccai, built by the present Dairo's Father some years since, is a most excellent Piece of Architecture, Art, and Cost, seeming to have made a vye which should out-do the other in fitting it. The Situati∣on on boasts a most delightful Plain, one side bordering fertile Valleys, the other shaded by a pleasant Grove of lofty Cedars, both large and delightful: at some distance appear the tops of those Mountains, at whose Foot the City Saccai is Founded: betwixt the Cedar-Grove and the Temple flows a pleasant Stream, that runs through a great part of the Temple: then you discover a large Porch, whose Doors Varnish'd with Wax after the Indian manner, lead the Way to the Brook; at the entrance on the right-side stands a spacious Gallery on five Columns; betwixt each Pillar appears a large Window; looking through that nearest the Gate you see a second Portico, through which goes the Way to the Temple; under the Windows a thick Wall, Rail'd on both sides, affords a stately Walk, each side verg'd with pleasant Trees, that yield a most delight∣ful Prospect: the Roof of the Gallery cover'd with Copper Tyles, are kept so bright and clear, that they give a dazling lustre when the Sun shines bright; on the left-hand of the Water-gate stands a stately Hall, built on three Ranks of great Pedistalls five Foot from the Ground, the out-parts having each a thick Ledge on which the Walls are rais'd; which being adorn'd with Flower-work and three-corner'd Windows, makes a lovely sight to the Eye. Houses and Gardens belonging to the Temple.On one side of this Hall is a Garden full of all manner of Plants, Flowers, and Herbs, kept in order by the skill of choice Gardners, wherein are two Walks between Copper Rails curiously Painted, that reach from the fore∣mention'd Hall to the Brook, along which a crooked Wall, sloaping on the top with several Windows, reaches to the end: between this Wall and the Copper-Rails, a Way leads towards the Treasuries and Habitations of the Priests: Of which Buildings three stand in a Row, each Front facing towards the Cedar-Grove, the Roofs jetting a great way over the side-Walls, are sup∣ported by six Pillars; under which are five Walks like Piazza's; behind these three appear several other Houses of the same fashion, but much bigger, wherein reside Japan Priests to perform their Service in the Temple. Over these Houses may be seen the top of the first Gate, being exceeding large, and artificially cover'd with thick Copper Plates. A stately Turret.Close by stands a stately Turret, almost three hundred Foot high, being eight Stories one over another, with eight Angles; every Story boasts many spacious Rooms and other Apartments, from whose Windows is a most delightful Prospect of several Villages, Mountains, Woods, Champain-grounds, and the City Saccai: between the Turret and the Gallery along, the Rivulet, stands the stately Temple, within curiously adorn'd with Imagery; on whose top appears a square and very large Chamber, the Floor being on the Roof of the Temple Pav'd with Free-Stone, on each side thereof four Pillars, and be∣tween each Pillar three Windows: the octangular Roof rising to a Point in the middle is all cover'd with Massie Gold. The Riches of the Tem∣ple near Saccai.The Dairo, at whose Charges this Edifice was erected, settled a Revenue of two hundred thousand Tail of Silver on the same Annually, every Japan Tail valu'd at five Shillings Sterling.
¶THe Dayro, according to the Japan Chronicles, hath always bore the chief Commands in that Empire: But since Anno 1550. his Throne being shaken by Civil Wars, which were occasion'd by the Dayro's youngest Son, brought it at last to that effect, that the Dayro had nothing left him, but only the Name of Chief Commander in Ecclesiastical Affairs; the Em∣perors keeping all the other Power, without any Limitation, in their own Hands: Only they go once in five or six years to Meaco, where, as a token of their Obedience, they present the Dayro with many rich Gifts, and drinking out of a Silver Cup, then breaking it in pieces, preserve them in their Poc∣kets; which Custom amongst the Japanners is a token of great humility: Wherefore not onely the Dayro, but nine of his nearest Relations, esteem them∣selves above the Emperor. Apparel of the DayroThe Dayro goeth clad in a black Coat, with a red Cape or Coller, o which hangs a Cloke full of great Pleits: On his Head a Bonnet, about which hang divers Tassels. In his Palace are three hundred sixty five Idols, of which one is set every Night before his Bed, to take care of his Welfare. If notwithstanding the Idol,Scourging of Idols, why. any disaster befal him, then the Idol that watch'd that Night is soundly beaten with Sticks: which Punishment sufficeth not; for besides, he banishes him a hundred days from his Palace; after the expi∣ration of which time, the Idol returns, and takes possession again of his old Station. Chief-Priest Ninxit,The same Custom the Chief-Priest Ninxit otherwise call'd Jaco, or Xaca, maintains: He being chosen amongst the Bonzi, keeps House in Meaco, and hath also three hundred sixty five Images, like the Dayro; and the Power to make and elect Tondes, that is, Bishops. Dayro's Seat.The Dayro in the day time sits with his Legs under him, on a pretty high Seat, having a Hanger on one side, and on the other his Bow and Arrows; in each Hand a Silk Towel or Handkerchief; his Forehead painted black and white; sometimes wearing a black Shirt, over which one of Purple, and upon that a Silk Coat.How he may be depos'd. The Dayro's Honor and Dignity may be taken from him (but none dare bereave him of Life) if he touches the Earth, pares his Hair or Nails, or kills any one. His Councellors are generally call'd Bungies, with whom he orders all Matters concerning Religion, and giving Titles of Ho∣nor, of which the Japanners are very covetous, buying their Nobility with great Sums of Money;His Riches, from whence he hath them. from whence it proceeds, that the Dayro, though he possesses neither Lands nor Customs, yet is accounted amongst the richest in Japan; for the Chiefest Princes continually have their Envoys at his Court, and in Person come yearly to visit him with great Presents, that thereby they may obtain newer and greater Titles of Honor, which make them in higher respect and esteem amongst their Subjects. His Women, and de∣lightful Recreation.The Dayro also hath twelve Wives, besides a great number of Concubines: Each Wife hath a costly Palace, which standing six in a row, face each other. Against the Evening, the Meat is prepar'd in those twelve Palaces, in new Earthen Pots; and both Vocal and Instrumental Musick, delighting the Ears of those present: But to that Palace where the Dayro is carried, thither they bring all the prepar'd Dishes, and eleven of his Wives walk thither, amongst the Musicians and Ladies of Honor, to wish Joy to her with whom the Dayro doth intend to sleep that Night; and all things which delight the Eye, Ear, and Palate, are there prepar'd for his Entertainment.
Bringing up of the young DayroWhen the Dayro hath a Son by one of the twelve Women, he immediately chooses eight Young and Beautiful Women out of the Noblest Families, who being accounted worthy to be Nurses and Foster-Mothers to so great a Lord as the Dayro's Son, receive with great Ceremony Titles of Honor and Dignity, which the foremention'd twelve Women, and nine prime Lords give them. This done, a sumptuous and costly Banquet is prepar'd; on the next day, they choose forty out of the eighty, to which they shew more Honor than before, and yet greater Favor is shown to ten which are taken out of the forty; the which ten they reduce to three, and shew them far more Respect than either of the former: But on the third day, they elect one out of the three, which they settle with such State and Ceremony in her place, that it is scarce to be express'd, all the Dayro's Court, being as it were in an uprore: their Feast and other various Pastimes being over,Strange election of a Nurse. the new Nurse receives greater Titles than any of the eighty before had done. And thus being thought worthy to Suckle the young Dairo, Milk is squeez'd out of her Breast into the Infants Mouth, which Ceremony being ended, the Child is put into her Arms. Farther relation of Fri∣sius his going by water.¶ But the Netherland Ambassadors, Frisius and Brookhurst, left Saccai and the Dairo's Temples, and Sail'd towards the South-Sea along the Coast, by Ammanasacoi, and the Village Fiungo, formerly a stately City, where the Empe∣rors sometimes kept their Court, but since, exceedingly ruin'd by Fire. Then leaving Swria on their Star-board, they Sail'd along the Shore, and pass'd by Takessima, Akas, Firmensi, and Muro, where they Landed in their Journey, and after having been nobly Treated in the Town,Japan Baths. they refresh'd themselves by going to a Bath, much esteem'd and us'd by the Japanners, as formerly by the Jews, Greeks, Persians, Romans, and several other Nations; and chiefly the Ro∣mans,And also the Romans. who set a great esteem upon their Baths, in Rome being an incredible number of them; so that there were not onely publick Baths, but scarce any one Person of Quality but had one for his own Conveniency; and if the Baths any where decay'd, or grew foul, Officers were appointed for their cleansing. Afterwards, the Emperors spent great Sums of Money on their Baths, and the more, because the Romans had great need of them, they having little Lin∣nen to shift themselves withal; so that they had them not onely for Pleasure, but also for Necessity, to wash off their Sweat, and other gather'd Dirt; the bottoms and Walls of those Baths were generally anointed with Perfumes, the Water coming into some of them through Silver and Golden Pipes. Marcus Agrippa built an hundred and seventy Baths, all which were free for any one to Bathe in, but not in the night. The Emperor Adrianus command∣ed that none should Bathe before eight in the Morning, except in time of sick∣ness: Alexander Severus took off that Roman Law of not Bathing in the Night, and not onely permitted it, but provided Oil for the Lamps in the Baths. An∣tonius the Philosopher parted these places, that the Men and Women should not come together: In like manner, amongst the Carthaginians the common People were lock'd out of the Noble-mens Baths. But this distinction was not observ'd by the Romans, who one among another flock'd thither, insomuch, that the Emperor himself often Bath'd amongst the Vulgar Rout, as Titus Ve∣spasianus relates. The concourse of the ordinary Baths was sometimes so great, that the Attenders of them being quite tyr'd out, took the Seed of wild Lupines (which occasions the Head-ach) throwing it in the Fire, so to drive the multi∣tude from thence, with the stink thereof.
¶ THe Netherland Ambassadors leaving the foremention'd Places on their Starboard, steer'd between the Islands Jessima and Wota, and sail'd close by the City Oussimato. And here we cannot pass by, without a particular Ob∣servation of what is often seen in this Voyage, viz. a Fight betwixt the Scorpi∣on and Pismires, of both which Vermine the Japan Barques are generally very full: Nay, the Scorpions in some Countreys increase so exceedingly, that the People are necessitated to quit their Habitations.Plin. lib. 8. cap. 30. Pliny relates, That a great Province of the Moors, Cinamolgi, lies waste by reason of the abundance of Scorpi∣ons. Nicander reckons,In Theriacis. That there are eight sorts of these Animals, all which have a Sting sticking out of their Tails, wherewith they offend others, and defend themselves. If, according to the Arabians, they wound the upper part of the Body, a Swelling appears, and a continual rising of the Stomach; but if they sting the lower part of the Body, the Belly swells immediately with Wind. If it be a Man that is hurt, he is troubl'd with a continual Priapismus, and the Poyson con∣geals in his Groins.De Loci Affect. lib. 3. on. 6. Gallen tells us, That a Person stung by a Scorpion met him ac∣cidentally, whose whole Body was as cold as Ice, and yet seem'd to drop with Sweat. This Animal preys on Flies, and sucks up the fattest Moisture of the Earth: And, according to Aristotle, is accustom'd to kill their Dams, so soon as they are able to shift for themselves: Yet they are not mischievous and hurtful in all places; for there are some in Italy and Egypt which afford good Food. The sting of a poysonous Serpent is cur'd by a House-Mouse, cut open in the mid∣dle, and laid upon the Wound; and also a roafted Locust, drunk up in Wine; likewise a Barb, and a Crey-fish. Moreover, it is a testimony of Divine Goodness, that a Scorpion, and most of all other Poysonous Creatures, being kill'd, and their Flesh laid raw on the Wound which they made, cures it in a short time: Fasting-spittle hath also a great Operation to dispel this Poyson. The ancient Father St. Ambrose relates concerning this Creature,Hoxaem, lib. 6. cap. 6. That he kills a Lion, and is himself destroy'd by Pismires. But to return to our Story. Strange Battel between the Pismires and Scorpions in the Voyage to Nange∣saque. ¶IN the Voyage between Osacca and Nangesaque, it is often seen with great admiration, that a Scorpion being surrounded with an innumerable Army of Pismires, who storm him on all sides, biting his Feet so extremely, that not being able to bear it, nor seeing any way to escape, at last kills himself with his own Sting, running the same into his Head, of which he immediately dies; whereupon they joyn all their Forces to carry him away: In which Work, it is pleasant to behold how they help one another; some shoving the Prey forward with their Feet, while others haul it along with their Mouths, and the remaining part creep under, to bear it on their Backs; always having fresh Supplies, to release those that grow weary. God represents in this small Animal the exact Image of Vertue; wherefore the Holy Scripture admonishes the Slothful to take Example by them. And indeed their Care is exceeding great; for they make their Nest with so many crooked Entrances, that it is secure from all hurtful Creatures: The Earth which they scrape out, they stop before their Holes, to keep out Rain: These Holes are divided into three Partitions; in one the Males and Females live to∣gether; in another the Females breed up their Young; and the third serves them for their Storehouse, wherein they lay their Provision. Majolus relates, That near Barleta, a City in Terra di Barria, he found a strange Nest of Pismires, under a great piece of Timber, which being easily
taken away, there appear'd a City, with four Corners,City of Pismires. almost four Foot long, and one and a half broad, lying so direct, as if it had been made straight with a Line; a Street going through the same long-ways, was a Fin∣ger broad, and one deep, made in a Clayie Ground; three lesser Streets also, which came into the foremention'd middle-way, of the same bredth and depth; at one end thereof a Market-place, and at the other end a Stile made of Egg-shells. On the other side of this Pismires City appear'd several deep Pits, so full of Corn, that it lay scatter'd on the Ground about them. Along the Ways the Pismires pass'd to and fro, like the Inhabitants of a Populous Town. Towards the South-West, exactly in the middle of the longest Wall, was the Gate, through which some came in loaded with Corn, others went out empty to fetch their Burdens, the eldest of them creeping before, who also climb the Blades, biting off the Corn, whilst the young ones stand below, and pick every Grain out of the Ear; that which is too heavy for them to carry, they shove before them; those that are empty, make way for those that are loaden; and that the Corn should not sprout, they bite that end that uses to shoot; and if accidentally it happens to be wet, they bring it forth, laying it to dry in the Sun, which is a certain sign of Fair weather. Moreover, they labor continually, resting neither Night nor Day. Hist. Anim. lib. 6. ca. 50. A conceited Passage of the Pismires.Aelian relates, That Cleanthes once observ'd some Pismires which carried away a dead one to the Hole, from whence it was us'd to come forth when living; and coming before it, stood all still, they belonging to another Hole; upon which, some Pismires that were in the same, came immedi∣ately to the Strangers, and went several times in and out, as about Business of great concern; at last bringing out a rotten Pear, as a Ransom for the dead Prisoner, and a Reward for their Labor, they took the Deceas'd with them, to bury him, as it is very common amongst them. By this Spectacle Cleanthes concluded, That Beasts could speak, and especially the Pismires: about which Opinion. Pythagoras, Cicero, Celsus, and other Learned Heathens, have often held great Disputations. Farther Voyage of the Ambassadors.¶ BUt to return again to our Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst, who pro∣ceeding forward in their Journey, and Sailing by the Islands Fibi, Si∣meia, Samnik, Syrais, Caroto, Szuwa, Jowe, Camro, Mianofimi, Moeko, and Mettagamma; left on their Starboard, upon the main Coast of Japan, Binga, Bignatum, Mewarri, Tantonomi, Jocosimi, Caminagari, Cammenosacci, Simonisicci, and Ximontchequi. In this Voyage they met in several Places, and chiefly about the Islands, divers Japan Fisher-men, who have generally their Wives with them: The Men com∣monly have the Crown of their Heads shaven,Japan Fisher-men how cloth'd. onely a Ring of Hair just about their Heads, not unlike the Roman Priests. Their Coats they fold over their Breasts, being girt with a broad Girdle, in which they stick a great Cutting-knife. On their Shoulders they carry a Yoke, at which hangs on each side a long and square Vessel, wherein they carry their Water, and also keep their Fish alive when they bring it to sell. The Women wear a Scarf wound about their Heads, with a Tuft hanging down on their Foreheads; their Breasts cover'd with a square Cloth, interwoven with several Flowers of Silk; about their Necks a long Cotton Cloth, that hangs down their Backs; their Coats both full and long, hanging down to their Ankles; their Shoes, or ra∣ther Soles onely, are made fast behind with a kind of Strap, and betwixt the two great Toes with a Knob.
Frisius and Brookhurst ar∣rive at Nangesaque.¶ THeir Excellencies Frisius and Brookhurst at last Sail'd through the Straights, where on the one side, upon the main Coast of Japan, lies the City Simonisicci, and on the opposite Shore, the great Island Bungo: So Weathering the Point, they got into the Bay Kokero; thence getting into the Corean Sea, they run between the Island Simissima, and the Bongian Village Assia, by Jobeco, Auroo, Firando, Nanatzjamma, Zetta, and Foucunda, into the Haven of Nangesaque, on the twenty second of May, Anno 1650. where they found their Countrey-men all in good health, and were inform'd of the strict Customs and Laws of the Japanners,After what manner the Netherland Ships sail to Nangesaque. about the Netherland Ships; who when they come between the Priest-Mountain, and the low Cliffs call'd the Hen and Chickens, pas∣sing by the Emperor's three great Block-houses, must discharge their Guns three times, at which the Japan Barques, full of Soldiers, come aboard, taking an account of the Ships Crew, setting them down by their Names, and also their Age and Conditions, which they are again demanded at their going away: therefore every one must well observe how he hath describ'd himself; for being found in a Lie, is as much as their Lives are worth. How the Japanners deal with them.So soon as they have dropp'd Anchor before Nangesaque, they must again discharge their Guns, strike their Flags, and untie their Boats, which driving away, the Fishermen lighting upon them, make use thereof till such time as the Ships are again ready to set Sail. Moreover, two Japan Skiffs, with two Soldiers in each of them, are order'd to lie one at the Stern and the other at the Head of the Ship, who keep Watch there day and night, never so much as entring into the Vessel, except in stormy Weather. The next day after the Vessel comes into the Haven of Nangesaque, the Bon∣joisen goes aboard, who sits down on a rich Carpet, brought over for that purpose from Batavia; then enquiring after the whole Cargo, they rip open Packs, Bags, and Chests at their pleasure; for the performing of which Offi∣ces, they use Servants, call'd The Companies Porters, not one Netherlander daring
any ways offer to touch the Goods, nor bear the least Command in the Ship; the Captain and Merchant of the Vessel being forc'd to stand and look on all things with patience, a Japan Seaman bearing the chief Command: The fore∣mention'd Porters receive for their daily Labor ten Styvers, for which they work from Sun-rising, till it sets again behind the Hills of Nangesaque. These People carry a little Board on their Sides, with the East-India Companies Arms carv'd thereon: Every one of them receives a Ticket from the Bonjois, sign'd with Japan Characters, which they shew to the Watch at the Gate through which they go to the Netherlanders Store-house: The foremention'd Ticket serves them also as a Priviledge to unlade the Dutch Merchandize, and other Materials; yet a Netherland Commander hath the Liberty from the Bonjois to chuse one, whom he will have to work on such a day. They chiefly observe when they are unlading a Vessel, if they can find any Crosses, or other Church-Ornaments us'd by the Catholicks; for if they find the least of them, the Dutch not onely lose their Ship and Goods, but their Lives also. They likewise make strict Search for Dutch Money and Books; therefore when they draw near Japan,Insupportable Pride of the Japanners. every one puts up his Money and Books, and marking and sealing it with their own Names, deliver it up to the Captain, who putting it all together into a Barrel, seals it up. When they have unladen the Ship of all the Merchandize, then the Japanners search their Guns, to see if they be not charg'd, and weigh the Anchors, that nothing of any Privacy be ty'd to them, and carry all their Match, Powder, Muskets, Pistols, Pikes, Hangers, and all other Ammunition ashore, with the Barrel of Money and Books; the Hollanders not once daring to ask whither it goes. Seal up the Hatches.The Hatches are also seal'd with the Emperors Arms on a Paper, made fast upon a Straw Knot, in such a nature, that no Netherlander is able to untie it: Over the Seal they nail a square Cover, made of Boards, that none may acci∣dentally tread on the Emperors Seal. When the Ship is ready to depart, the Seals which are on every Hatch are taken off, and the Straw Button shewn to a Bonjois, to see if the Seal be not broke. If the Steward of the Ship hath oc∣casion for Water, Wood, or any other Necessaries, he makes a sign; where∣upon an Interpreter, who hath twelve Guilders a Month and his Diet allow'd him, in the Netherlander Store-house, on the Isle Disma, before Nangesaque, comes aboard, asking what they want; and receiving answer, he goes to one of the Ports in the Stern of the Ship, and lying on his Knees with his Head against the Boat, without seeing those that are in it, he desires that which the Ships Crue want; and having deliver'd his Message, the two Watchmen send the Interpreter to the Governor of Nangesaque, who immediately gives order for a Boat to bring them Water and other Necessaries. Formerly the Japanners us'd to take off the Rudder from the Ship; but of late they have left that Cu∣stom. When the Netherlanders Goods are brought into the Store-house, they are receiv'd by a Bonjois, with the foremention'd Tickets. The manner Trade be∣twixt the Netherlanders and Japanners.In October are their Days of Sale; when a Catalogue of the Goods that are brought over, is set up in all places of Nangesaque: These Market-days they proclaim by going up and down, and beating on Kettles and Basons; at which noise, great numbers come flocking together. Apparel of the Inhabi∣tants on the Island Bongo,¶THe Inhabitants of Nangesaque, and those of the Island Bongo, differ not only in their Speech, but also in their Apparel, from the other Ja∣panners. The Bongian Men cover their Heads with a loose Cotton Cap; their
Coats not so long as those in Japan, theirs being like the Polanders: The Lap∣pets of these Coats they fold one over another on their Breasts; about their Middle a broad Sash, of which one end hangs down to their Knees. The Women go in their Hair braided, one Lock thereof hanging over their Shoulders; their Coats or Flower'd Cotton, ty'd above the Hips with a broad Girdle, reaching down half way of their Legs, and being open before like a Gown, under which another Coat appears, curiously Em∣broider'd. ¶BUt to return: On the Day of Sale the Packs are cut open; on the Monday all the Goods may be seen, the Store-house of the East-India Company being then open'd;What Merchandize they barter. and in Silver Vessels are plac'd Deer-skins and Buff-skins, all manner of Cotton Cloth, the finer the better, Quicksilver, Scarlet Cloth, Speckled-wood, all manner of Drugs, Brimstone, Ambergreece, Musk, Toquin-pelings, and divers other Merchandizes. The foremention'd Dish∣es are plac'd on a Counter,Where and how shewn. standing in the Gallery which goes quite through the Netherland Store-house on the Island Disma. This Ware-house hath three hundred convenient Rooms, to hold Goods, standing all next the Ground, which are seal'd up every Night with the Emperors Arms, in the presence of a Japan Burgomaster, who, during the time of Trade, diets with the Agent for the Netherland East-India Company, and is serv'd with Silver Vessels, by Japan∣ners. The Japanners who are imploy'd in this Business being three hundred, are paid by the Netherlanders. Description of the Gal∣lery before Nangesaque.The foremention'd Gallery being square, is twelve Foot high, resting on turn'd Pillars of Speckled-wood, a pair of broad Stairs leading up to it, and at the end thereof a Hatch; the Floor of the Gallery cover'd with Tapestry. Round about the Table on which the Goods are to be seen, stand Stools of Speckled-wood, with Cushions of Silk, on which the East-India Companies Arms are Embroyder'd: Before the Japan-Merchants go to sit down by this
Table, they pull off their Shoes, that they may not soil the Tapestry with Dirt. This Table stands in the middle of the Gallery. When the several Merchandizes have been view'd on the Monday, they Con∣tract for them the next day; on the Wednesday the Goods are deliver'd, and weigh'd in the Emperors Scale; on Thursday the Water-gate of the Netherland∣ers Store-house is open'd, before which above a hundred Barques lye daily to lade and unlade; on the Sunday the Japanners rest, as well as the Christians. This Trade lasts a whole Month, during which time, it is just like a Fair on the Island Disma; the Japanners making Booths of Sail-Cloths,What the Japanners bring to sell. wherein they sell Camphire and Camphire-wood, Japan-Cabinets and Coats, China-Roots, Porcelane, and all manner of rough and wrought Silver. When the appointed time of Trade is expir'd, the Ships must immediately stand off to Sea, notwithstanding great part of their Goods lye on the Decks unstow'd: Nay, if there blow a contrary Wind, and a Storm, yet they must away, so soon as their Ammunition is brought aboard again. If the Seamen are not quick in weighing their Anchors, immediately a hundred Soldiers are sent to every Ship, to cut their Cables, and carry them out beyond the Priest-Moun∣tain, whether it be Night or Day, making no distinction. In the like hurry the Ambassadors Frisius and Brookhurst came from Japan, and at last arriv'd safe in Holland.
A Second and Later DISCOURSE Concerning the EMPIRE OF JAPAN. Japan Kingdoms.JAPAN divided into five Provinces, viz. Jamaystero, Jetsengo, Jetsesen, Quanti, and Ochio, besides Saykok and Chiekok, therein reckons these several Kingdoms, ac∣cording to Peter Davity; that is, Nangato, Inami, Suno, Isxumi or Juxumi, Aqui, Foqui, Inaba, Bichu, Mimazaca, Fa∣tima, Tanqueina, Tamba, Tango, Barosa, Xamixiro, Xamato, Inzumo, Quiy, Jechigen, Bonni, Inga, Xma, Ixe, Mino, Can∣gan, Noto, Jetchu, Fitaqui, Ximano, Boari, Micava, Cay, Jenchingo, Deva, Chaneuque, Tuttomu, Furanga, Izu, Mucazi, Ximonojuque, Sangamie, Xila, Bungo, Figen, Arima, Omura, Saxuma or Sucuma, Fingo, Chicugen, Chicungo, Buigen, Tosa or Tonsa, Quiloo, Aba or Ava, Sanoqui or Samuqui, Ho or Hyo; besides the Islands Sado, Voqui, Ceuxima, Iqua, Abagi, and Iniunoxima, each of which makes also a Kingdom, Chief Cities in Japan.Nangato hath for its Metropolis the City Amanguei bordering the Sea, and reckons ten thousand Houses. The chief City of Mino is Guefu; and also Fu∣namaca, of the Kingdom Boari. The Kingdoms that lye Northerly, belonging to Saykok, are Buge, Figen, and Chichugen; the Southern, Fiunga or Finga, Bonzumi or Ozumi, Saxuma, Bungo, and Chungo. Finga is divided betwixt two Lords; the first Governs over Emacusa, and the other over Xiqui. But as the Domini∣on of Nangato is oftentimes call'd by the Name of its Metropolis Amanguei; so also, for the same Reasons, the Kingdom Bonni is call'd Concor, in which is very famous the strong Castle Saojama. Moreover the Islands Firando and Goto be∣long to Saykok. The Kingdom of Bungo boasts (besides other eminent Places) the Towns Vozuqui or Uzuqui, Funay, and the Fort Ximabara. Next to Bungo, joyns the Territory Figen, famous for its Metropolis Riosoge. The Dominion Arima borrows its denomination from the chief City; besides which, are also the Towns Arye, Ximaga, Canzula, Chingia, Saigo, and Facirao. This Realm
Arima is by an In-let of the Sea, commonly call'd The Bay of Arima, divided from Fingo, whose most eminent Cities are Uto, Cateuxiro, Nonzuy, Consura, Ton∣do, Xiqui, Catatinova, Fondi, and Amacusa. The Metropolis of Omura is also call'd by the same Name as the whole Realm; besides which, there are the Towns Coru and Sonuguy. Saxuma is famous for the City. Cangoxima, Mye, and the Invincible Castle Cogiro. Chicugen contains the eminent City Facata, inha∣bited by many rich Merchants; and also the Towns Chinsuchi, and Xataqua. In Chicungo stands the great City Corumi, fortified with a strong Castle: In Quiloo, Osacca: In Quanto, the Imperial Residence Jedo: In Caquinay, that famous City Meaco. Unlimited Power of the Japan Kings.¶EVery King hath an unlimited Power within his own Territories; on∣ly such as are too much oppress'd, may appeal to the Emperor for Ju∣stice: Nay, every Master hath the same Authority over his Servants, and eve∣ry Father over his Children; and yet all Persons, even the Kings themselves, are in such subjection under the Emperor, that he doth with them what he pleases: So that the Subjects must do what their Governors are desirous to have them, and expect to be put to death when they think fit. Pride of the Japan No∣bles.¶NO Persons whatsoever are so ambitious of Honor, so high-minded and proud, as the Japanners; for not only their Kings, but Cunixes, that is, Dukes; and Tones, which are like our European Barons; nay, ordinary Noble∣men, account themselves too good to answer any one with Words, scorning al∣most to give the least Signal by Beck or Nod, for what they would have to be done, but sometimes write it down in Paper; not valuing in the least to be belov'd, nor fearing to be hated by their Subjects. When any Person is remov'd by the Emperor from one Command to ano∣ther, his Subjects are always remov'd with him. It seldom happens that the Crown remains long in one Family, because for small occasions, according to the Emperors pleasure, they are deliver'd to others.Not. Pol. It seems strange which Justus Lipsius relates of the Japan Emperors, that at their Coronation they promise by Oath,Strange Oath of the Ja∣pan Emperors. To provide Necessary Rains and Sun∣shine, and also to prevent Storms and Floods, hurtful to the Plants. ¶IN the more barren parts of Japan, the Inhabitants are valianter than else∣where. Firando and Goto produce much Salt, which they barter for Rice. The Breeding of their Children in Japan.The Japanners breed up their Children not only mildly, but very prudent∣ly; for if they should cry whole Nights, they endeavor to silence them by fair means, without the least snapping, or using hard Language to them. Before their Youths come to be seven years old, they put them out to School, where being tutor'd by the Bonzi, they learn to Write and read till they are fourteen; of which their Writing is the most troublesom,Strange manner of Wri∣g having four several sorts of Characters, which differ not onely in shape, but signification; some Letters and Words being us'd in Writing to Noble-men, others to the Common-peo∣ple; one Form of Speech in their Verses, and a far differing Dialect in Prose. The Teaching of Youth,  what manner.Their Teaching is perform'd without rashness; for there is no Japanner that will do any thing by foul means: But they provoke the Children with Ho∣nor to strive one against another; which seeming to be born in them, they seek with their utmost Endeavors to exceed one another in Learning. In their
twelfth year they begin to wear Swords.How they wear their Hair The Hair of their Foreheads the Children pull out with a pair of Pinchers; the Burgesses half their Hair; the Noblemen shave their Heads quite bare, leaving a Tuft behind, as a sign of his Nobility; if they differ about Buying or Selling Commodities, their Chil∣dren decide the difference. Japanners are very man∣nerly¶ABove all things it is much to be admir'd, to see the Noble and Ignoble, Citizens and Rusticks, Youth and Age, so mannerly and of a civil Deportment and Carriage, as if they had been bred in an Emperors Court. They abstain from Beef and Mutton, as the Europeans do from Horse-flesh, feeding most on Rice, Fish, and Venison, and are very Moderate in all things to prolong their Lives, and indeed they attain to a great and healthful Age.Live long. Women with Child destroy their Fruit,Child-bearing women de∣stroy their fruit. when they have not wherewithal to bring up their Children, the Bonzies not accounting such Murder for Sin. They have not the least Pity or Compassion on Strangers:Are unmerciful▪ They wonder at those Christians, that preserve any from Perishing in Want: They never disclose their Troubles: They break not easily out in a Rage, but being once anger'd, will never be reconciled: None can justly accuse them for Deceit, for if any one chanceth to give more than is their due to have, they will restore it again to the Donor: Their excellent Arts may appear by their Coats, Wax'd-Chests, and Cabbinets. Marry'd men much more priviledge than the women.¶THe Marry'd-Men have much more liberty than the Women; for a Man may without the least Regret be common with a Whore, and can send his Wife upon any Offence home to her Friends: But this kind of Divorcing their Wives, is onely customary amongst the Common-People, for when a Noble-man begins to have an Antipathy against his Wife, he puts her not away, because of her Quality, but provides her in his House with all Ne∣cessaries, and delights himself with those which he fancies best: But the Wo∣men being thus kept in awe, do all things possible to please them, and the ra∣ther, because that for a small Offence, and meer Trifle, viz. but speaking with any other Man in private, they are by their Law to suffer Death; from whence it proceeds, that Marry'd Women here are generally very Honest and Chaste. A strange passage that happen'd in Firando about a chaste Woman.¶A Passage which happen'd in Firando, Anno 1646. on August 15. may wit∣ness the same. Jacatai, a Person of Quality, having Contracted Mar∣riage with a young Lady; and soon after the Wedding, having some occasions, went to Meaco; a Noble-man having formerly been deny'd in his Courtship to the young Marry'd Woman, (under a Pretence, that he would never Marry) observing this opportunity, came with a considerable Train of Servants to his late Mistress, and forc'd her to satisfie his Lust: She thus Injured, resolv'd on Revenge, desiring him to stay with her, giving him also hopes of more such Enjoyments as he had lately had: In the Interim, Jacatai return'd home, for whose Welcome they prepared a noble Feast on the top of the House; she had also order'd, that her Gallants, Friends, and he should be invited thither: Where, whilst they were in the midst of their Mirth, Jacatai's Wife standing up, related, that there was a Woman in Saccai that had been lately Ravish'd; asking, what Punishment she deserv'd? whereupon, all those there present judg'd the Villain that had committed the Fact to suffer death, and not she that
was Ravish'd? Which said, she cry'd aloud, I am she, and there sits he that did it, I pray, take my Life, that the shame of suffering such a Dd, may not stain other honest Women, nor one so base as I be found amongst Men. Every one startled thereat, and chiefly her Husband, who proffering his Love to her, promising also from that time forward, never to remember the Fact, she having been forc'd to it against her power. These kind speeches satisfi'd her not, but she said, Will you, because of my Dishonor take no Revenge on me? then I will take it my self; which she had no sooner said, but leaping from the top of the House, broke her Neck. The Ravisher amongst the Croud of his Friends, got down Stairs into the Street, where ripping up his Belly, fell down on the dying Woman, so to ac∣company her in death, whom he lov'd so exceedingly in his life time. No less strange passage happen'd in the Realm of Fingo.¶ABout the same time, almost the like Passage happen'd in Fingo: A No∣ble-Man residing there, was Marry'd to a Lady so exceeding Beautiful, that the King of Fingo being Enamor'd of her, could not rest before he had sa∣tisfi'd his desires by enjoying her. But because her Husband stood in his way, he resolv'd to dispatch him; which Murder put in Execution, the Widow was presented to the King, she having information, that her Husband was kill'd by the King's order, told him, O King, I account my self happy, that I have this Body to serve you, if your Love to me be real, pray let me have one proof thereof, which will be by granting me two Requests; First, That you will please to grant me thirty days to be∣moan my Murder'd Husband; and afterwards, that you will plepase a Feast at your House, that there I may take my leave of the Deceased's Friends: All which the King grant∣ing, provided a noble Dinner in one of his Royal Banqueting-Houses, where when they were all in the height of their Mirth, the Widow rose from the Ta∣ble, and stepping towards a Belcony, said, I will not satisfie his Lust that Murder'd my Husband; the words being scarce utter'd, but she leap'd down, and so bruis'd her self, that she dy'd on the spot whereon she fell. Japanners are very wicked.¶THe Chastity of the Japan Women is as much to be prais'd as the Mens Vices, who openly perpetrate all manner of Villany, to be abhor'd; for they stick not to hold the Sin of Sodomy a Vertue:Punish whoredom in women after a cruel man∣ner. In the mean while, pu∣nishing Whoredom both in Marry'd and Unmarry'd Women, after a cruel manner: The Lord of Firando caus'd Anno 1636. three Maids of Honor to be taken from his Female Retinue, and put in a Chest alive, which was drove full of Iron Spikes; because the one had committed Adultery with a Noble-man, and the other two knowing of it, kept it private and would not disclose it. Another, not much unlike the foremention'd Passage happen'd about the same time: A Man coming home out of the Countrey, found another Man with his Wife, whom according to the Japan Custom, he immediately ran tho∣row; which done, he ty'd the Woman to a Ladder, and on the next day, in∣vited all her Friends, who coming, sat down whilst he unty'd the Woman, putting on her a Death-Garment, and a Box in her hand, commanding her to bring the inclos'd Dainty to his Guests, and there to open it, which she per∣form'd, and opening it, found the Members of the Murder'd man curiously deck'd with Flowers; upon the sight of which, falling into a Trance, the en∣raged Husband immediately cut off her Head. Women of quality are in great esteem.Women of Quality are highly esteem'd amongst them, and especially those that are sent by the Emperor to be Wives to some of his Princes; for it belongs solely to his Majesty to make Matches betwixt great Persons. When the Em∣peror
gives a Noble Lady in Marriage, the Bridegroom makes daily great Feasts, causing a Palace to be built for the Bride, wherein she may keep her Court, being provided with a great Train of Ladies and Maids of Honor, the number of which amounts to fifty, a hundred, or two hundred, as the Bride∣groom is more or less able. These Womens Lodgings are curiously Varnish'd with Wax, Gilt, and adorn'd with Imagery. Stately progress of the women.Once a year, the foremention'd Woman visits her Friends in great State; her Ladies and Waiting-Maids following her in above forty or fifty Sedans: Which being curiously Varnish'd, and In-laid with Gold, are carry'd in good order, two Fathom from one another; both sides thereof attended by Foot∣men and Pages in handsome Liveries. The Sons which she bears, succeed their Father in his Dominion, but if she die without Male issue, it generally falls to another Family, on whom the Emperor pleaseth to beslow it, for no base Son, begotten on a Concubine, can Inherit. Delightful places in wo∣mens Palaces.In the Womens Palaces, nothing is wanting that Art or Cost can procure for their Delights, there being pleasant Ponds well stor'd with Fish, fine De∣coys for Wild Fowl, Gardens full of Trees, and all manner of Plants and fra∣grant Flowers, wherewith the Beds and Walks are made exceeding Delightful to behold. There are also daily Comedies Presented, and both Vocal, and Instru∣mental Musick heard from Morning to Night, so seeming to be in an Earth∣ly Paradise, to which no man can have access, but onely her nearest Relations, and that but very seldom. Degrees of Ladies and Maids of Honor.Upon the least Misbehavior or Offence, their Waiting-Maids and Servants are in danger of their Lives, so that they must be very Circumspect in all things, and chiefly the Women to be in no company with Men: These Women serve their Lady and Prince with the greatest Humility and Submission that can pos∣sibly be exprest; every one of them know their Office, according to which they are Cloth'd; so that some wear Red Clothes, with green Girdles, and Head-Attire; others Yellow Apparel, and about their Middle a Violet Girdle, and Ribbons for their Head; others again wear White Coats, and Red Girdles, yet all agree, in being richly Embroyder'd with Gold; every Order or Degree commonly consist in sixteen Maids of Honor, over which is the Mother of the Maids, who keeps them all in good Decorum: None of all these but is of a No∣ble Extract, and exceeding well brought up. Every one of them receiv'd in∣to Service before their fifteenth Year; when they attain to eight and twenty; or thirty, then their Prince bestows them in Marriage, to one or other of his Courtiers; and those that stay above, they are generally made Overseers of the rest. Japan Nobles spend great sums of money.¶BUt their Countrey Governors, notwithstanding they have great Reve∣nues, have also extraordinary ways for Expence; for besides the Charges of the Women, they must defray others far greater, viz. the Emperor maintains a strange Custom amongst his Peers, by which his Pomp increases, and fear of their Insurrection vanishes, which proves very fatal to the Princes. The business thus: Keep their Courts half the year in Jedo.The Emperor keeping his Court in Jedo, all the Kings and Princes residing to the North, and East from Jedo, must exactly on the set-time, take up their Habitations in the Emperors sight for six whole Moneths, so to add a Lustre to his Imperial Greatness, and are also at his pleasure, either to loose or keep their Dominions: At their coming and going, they give great Presents to the
Emperor; When the half-year is expir'd, then those Princes from the West and South part of Japan repair thither also, so that half of the chief Nobility in Japan are continually at the Emperors Court. Those their Charges are Augmented the more, because every King, Prince, Duke, or Baron will strive to exceed one another in State, during their Residence there; So that they ge∣nerally come with as great a Retinue of Guards, Servants, Souldiers, Horses, Gentlemen, and others, as possibly their conditions can bear; the meanest Lord keeping a thousand Servants in his Palace at Jedo. They also spend much Money on their Buildings, in Repairs or Inlarging them. The Liveries which they give to their Pages and Footmen, and the sumptuous Banquets with which they Treat one another, cost them also very dear. How the Emperor op∣presses his Subjects, that they cannot rebel against him.¶ ANd though most of them spend all their Revenues, yet the Emperor still oppresses them by fresh Taxes, that being poor, they cannot be able to resist him; Commanding them to build here new Castles, there inlarge a Fort, yonder a strong Hold, all at their own Cost and Charge, whereby every one knows partly what it will amount to. It is to be admir'd, if thus Com∣manded, how each will strive to out-do the other, in Building larger, cost∣lier, and with more speed, not sparing any Charges towards the promoting of the Work. Rerenue of the Princes.By this means and several other, the Revenues of the Nobility are common∣ly wasted, which consist not in Custom or other Imposition, but in the Ground-Rent of the Houses, which they yearly raise, either more or less, according to the bigness of the Building:Are known to the Empe∣ror. Each House must at a set time provide a man to serve their Lord. Moreover, because Japan produces Copper in one place, Gold, Silver, Iron, Tin, Lead, Rich-Wood, Purcelaine, Hemp, Cotton, Silk, Camphire, Rice, and other Commodities in another: Every Lord hath out of the several Products particular Revenues, which the Emperor knows to a Pe∣ny; for he keeps a trusty Steward of his own in every Lords House, without whose knowledge none of these Lords can act any thing. The King keeps wise men to advise him.It deserves no small wonder, that the Noblest Princes amongst others of their Retinue, keep some particular Persons of an exceeding quick apprehen∣sion, and brave understanding, who are daily to observe, and freely to disclose all Errors committed by their Prince, with whom they are continually, and chiefly at Feasts and other Merry-meetings, noting down all, what is worthy of Praise in his Lord, or deserves Laughter. Their names.The Princes, whose Jurisdictions spread themselves far and near, call their Lands by the name of their Residence. They all have three Names; for in their Infancy they have a Child's Name; in their Manly years another; and when grown, they assume a third: Their Sur-name they put before the other, because they preserve and detain that from their Predecessors. Strange custom of the Ja∣panners, who murder them∣selves at the death of their Lord.¶ WHen a Lord dies, generally ten, twenty, nay, thirty rip up their own Bellies to die with him: The number of these Self-Murderers is ei∣ther more or less, according to the Ability of the Person. Many of them ob∣lige themselves to it in their life-time, for when they have receiv'd any Fa∣vors from them, after an humble return of Thanks, they say, Most Noble Lord, the number of your Faithful Subjects is great, How have I deserv'd to receive such Ho∣nor? From whence doth this Requital proceed? This Body which already is yours, I give you, and promise to die by a violent Death, so soon as you give up the Ghost. To the
Confirmation of which, the Lord drinks to his Servant in a Bowl of Wine; after which, the Servant at the Death of his Master, cannot recall his Pro∣mise, for all Obligations Seal'd with a Cup of Wine, may not be broke. The cutting of their Bellies is perform'd in the following manner: He that is to perform the Office, invites his nearest Relations into a Temple, the middle thereof cover'd with Mats, where they have a Noble Treat, at which are some of the prime Bonzies; after having Eat and Drunk their fill, he cuts his Belly athwart, so that his Bowels and all his Entrails come gushing out upon the Floor: Some that are a little wiser, besides ripping open their Bowels, cut their own Throats, and the more they Massacre themselves, the greater Ho∣nor they gain. This kind of Dying with their Lords is very ancient, for it was a Custom in Gallia, before the Birth of our Savior: Julius Caesar relates, That the Soldurii bound themselves to their Lords, in like manner as the Japanners. Japan servants suffer themselves to be bury'd alive under a Wall.Moreover, they maintain a second Custom of Self-Murder: When a Prince, by the Emperors Command, or for his own safety, is to build a Castle or strong Wall; his Servants intreat him to let them have the honor to lie under the Foundation, imagining, that such Walls built on living Men are invincible;And why. so that there is scarce any great Building to be found, but the Foundation there∣of is laid upon one Man or more. Strange manner of execu∣tion in Japan.Each Lord is Judge over his own Servants; there is scarce any Crime, but they suffer death for it; as for Stealing the value of a Farthing, or Playing for Money, for which Offences, he onely that hath committed them dies, other∣wise, for greater Faults, his nearest Relations also die with him: Those Crimes which they account great, are to break the Emperors Command, viz. unjust Dealings of Judges plac'd by the Emperor, falsifying his Coyn, setting Hou∣ses a Fire, running away with Marry'd Women; for all which Offences, a whole Family is destroy'd; yet the Women making their innocency known, often escape with Life. The Goods of the Condemn'd are deliver'd to Offi∣cers which preserve the same, to repair Temples, Bridges, and mend the High∣ways: Their Punishments are several, according to the greatness of the Crime, ripping open their Bowels being onely granted to Persons of Quality, and for small Offences; for at other times, they Burn them, Roast them alive, Boil them in Oil or Water, or else pull them asunder by four Bulls, with their Heads hanging down: But when the Emperor dies, all Criminals are set at liberty through all Japan, in one day and hour; and the Poof and Needy re∣ceive Money, that they may take something in hand whereby to live. Very remarkable Voy∣age of Henry Schaep.¶ THe Japanners very False and Treacherous, which their Qualities may partly appear by what happen'd to Henry Cornelizoon Schaep a Merchant, and a Factor William Bylevelt, sent in the Bresken's Ketch, with the Fly Boat Castrecom, by the East-India Council at Batavia, to discover by the East of Japan, the Northern Coasts of Tartary. The River Polisange, the West-most part of America, and the rich Gold and Silver Islands. On the third of February, Anno 1643. the two Vessels set Sail. The Ketch Breskens, happen'd about the latter end of July to get into an Inlet on the East Coast of Japan,Falls on Japan. lying in forty Degrees North Latitude before a Village inhabited by Fishers. The Sea-men obtain'd liberty to Barter some Netherland Commodities for Rice and other Provisions.
Are kindly entertain'd there.A Japan Noble, happening to come Aboard, invited the Captain and other Officers to his House to a Dinner, where according to promise, he kindly en∣tertain'd them, furnishing them with all manner of Herbs and other Provisi∣ons, and free liberty to come ashore, and go when they plea'd. Against the Evening, the Noble-man return'd again Aboard, with the Governor of the Village, bringing a Bale of Japan Rice with him; for which, receiving thanks, was entertain'd by the Captain in his Cabinet, with Arak, Spanish Wines, and Tent; and as a return for his Rice, gave him a pair of new Shooes, and Silk Stockins, with which he seem'd to be highly satisfi'd: After having eat and drank sufficiently, the Captain Henry Cornelizoon Schaep, William Bylevelt, Sieward Johnson the Purser, Peter Gerritszoon the Cooper, Henry Elsfoort Gunner, Jurian Sholton, Abraham Spelt, Hans Slee, and two Youths, Jacob de Paw, and Aert Bastia∣enszoon, accompany'd with the Japan Gentlemen, went ashore: The Captain taking with him some Linnen, and a few ordinary Clothes, to Barter for Pro∣visions for the sick Sea-men. The Noble-man carry'd them all again to his House, which stood close by the Shore, entertaining them with Japan Wine; after which refreshment, Schaep desir'd to see the Village, and to buy some ne∣cessaries, which the Noble-man not onely granted, but went himself with them in Person, bringing the Netherlanders to the Governor of the Town, who like∣wise drank to each of them three Cups of Japan Wine. A Japan Nobleman be∣trays the Netherlanders.From thence he carry'd them by a way, on one side wash'd with the Sea, and on the other side border'd with Fields full of little Cucumers and Radi∣shes; and having walk'd half an hour, they came near a Hill, from whence they had a most delightful Prospect of Vallies, Rice Fields, and Pasture-Ground, in which, some Cows and Oxen were Grazing; about a stones cast from them was a Rusticks House, towards which they walk'd altogether, and went in to rest and shelter themselves from the Sun; where sitting down, they desir'd something to drink; on which, the Noble-man made signs to them that he had given order for it already, and that it would immediately be brought them; but staying an hour and nothing coming, the Netherlanders would have taken their leaves, and been gone aboard. A cunning Plot of his.Whereupon, he again signifi'd to them to stay a little longer, for he saw some Horses coming thither, on which they might ride back to the Village, which the Sea-men refused, saying, Their Legs were able to carry them. But he con∣tinu'd earnest in his Request, whilst the Horses approach'd the Houses, so that he forc'd them to get upon them; every one being Mounted, were on each side held by three Japanners, under a pretence of Civility, to hold them fast on their Horses: In this manner they rode down the Hill, through the Vallies in∣to the Countrey, by which they suspected not without great reasons, that it was some treacherous design; which fear was augmented, because one of the Japanners desirous to see Captain Schaep's Hanger, which he giving him, would not return it, but kept it under a pretence to wear it for his sake. The Netherlanders are surprised, and all taken Pri∣soners.The Netherlanders drew nearer and nearer to a River, where on the opposite side, abundance of People were riding on Horses, whither they were led, which sight so amaz'd the Netherlanders, that they fell from their Horses, and would have return'd the way which they came, but looking about, saw them∣selves beset by a great number of Japanners, some thought to escape towards the Sea with some Japan Boats that lay in the River: But none of them could possible get away, for twelve Japanners with drawn Scymiters fell on every Hol∣lander, throwing them on their Bellies to the ground, tying their hands behind
them, and putting a Rope about their Necks; thus misused, the Japanners ask'd, If Captain Schaep and his Company would appear before their Emperor; and Worship him? which they willingly accepted, signifying to them, that the Hollanders were at peace with the Emperor, and carry'd him yearly great Presents in Jedo; and that their Governor liv'd at Nangesaque, who drove a great Trade there. Japanners use the Pri∣soners after a strange man∣ner.The Japanners understanding these their signs, carry'd them to a Brook, where they wash'd off the Dirt from their Faces; which no sooner done, but they saw the Governor of the Town, whom they had Treated aboard, coming toward them with a great Train of Servants, Colours, and Pikes; three stately Sumptre-Horses, being led before. This Company the Sea-men thought were come to Execute them, so that they expected nothing but death; but when drawing near, the chief of the Netherlanders were set on Horses, and the rest on Stiers, (which the Japanners use very much in stead of Horses) and carry'd up into the Countrey. Travel to Jedo.They had ridden full two Leagues, when they entreated the Japan Gover∣nor to permit them to write a Letter to the Sea-men, that they might stay at Anchor, and wait for their return from Jedo; the Governor making no reply to them, commanded their hands to be unty'd, and onely Pinion their Arms together, and leave the Rope about their Necks. About Sun-set, having rid five-Leagues through bad way, they came into a Village: The Captain, Merchant, and Boys Lodg'd in a Rusticks House, the rest were kept three and three together in other places, and meanly treated. Here they observ'd the Noble-man and the Governor to give order, That they should give the Prisoners a little Rice, Salt-Fish, and Japan Wine:Are meanly treated. No delight could they take in this Diet, yet were forc'd to shew no Melancholy, that it might not in the least appear by their Looks to be troubled at their going be∣fore the Emperor. In the Interim, they found an opportunity to signifie to the Noble-man that they were Hollanders, being in a League of Amity with the Japan Emperor, and that yearly eight Ships came Loaden with rich Mer∣chandize
to Nangesaque: But all these Sayings could not procure them the least Liberty, for though the old Cords were taken from them, yet new ones were put on; And the Gentleman going away, set a strict Watch about the House, so that they expected nothing but Death the next Morning. Receive Orders to Write to their Ships.On which, an hour after the Sun was risen, the foremention'd Gentleman came to them prepar'd for a further Journey, bringing along with him an Ink-horn, and a little piece of Paper, commanding them to write to their Vessels, and order them not to stir from thence, but remain there till their re∣turn, which would not be till thirty days; whereupon the Letter was sent containing to this effect: We were yesterday treacherously betray'd, and already carry'd five Leagues up in the Countrey to make our appearance before the Emperor in Jedo; which Journey requires a Moneths time, mean while entertain the Japanners with all Civility; take great care of the Ship and Goods, and also send us some Clothes for fear we should want. The Letter finish'd and deliver'd, they went on in their Journey, the Com∣manders, as before, Riding on Horses, the rest on Oxen: The Captain and the Merchant asking their Companions how they had been entertain'd? reply'd, But meanly, and that they had their old Ropes also exchang'd for new. Japanners make Wood∣den Crosses.Moreover, the Japanners had Woodden Crosses, which they shew'd to the Hollanders, so to find out if they were Papists, but observing them not minded, they threw them away. The remaining part of the Way was very narrow and troublesom: about Noon they drew near a Rusticks Hut, where they Lighted and refresh'd themselves. A Japan Village full of Boards, with Chara∣cters Engraven thereon.Towards the Evening, having pass'd eight Leagues, they came into a great Village, where at each Corner of the Streets several Boords were nail'd up full of Japan Characters, with thirty Golden Knobs round them. The Troopers, Soldiers, and Servants, told the Hollanders, That every one of them should have Gold from the Emperor for every Christian they brought him, according to the Contents written on these Boords. Are visited by several Japanners.In the middle of this Town the Hollanders were Lodged. The Noble∣men before mention'd came to comfort the Prisoners, commanding their Landlord to provide store of Meat for them; which accordingly was perfor∣med. But when the Prisoners, after having refresh'd themselves, thought to take some rest, a great number of Japanners, each wearing two Swords, came thronging into their Inn: amongst the Men also came store of Women, which did not a little amaze them, expecting every Minute in that barbarous Coun∣trey to be slain; but indeed was to no other end than out of curiosity to view the Hollanders: and chiefly the Women took great delight in seeing the Youth Jacob de Paw; whom they made to shew his naked Bosom: They came in great numbers till midnight, asking several times if they were Papists? making Crosses with their Fingers, pointing towards them that they should kiss and worship them: But the Prisoners slighting seem'd to abhor them: at which the Japanners taking great delight, cry'd Hollande, Hollande. They desire their Names for a Remembrance.Next Morning came many more to view the Hollanders, troubling them very much, by making them write their Names, which they would keep in re∣membrance of them. Amongst the Spectators were some, who by their fierce angry Looks, and strange Gestures, seem'd to threaten death to the Hollanders, turning up the Whites of their Eyes, and making a horrible noise; whilst they thought that
he bloody Council was gather'd to give their Sentence, which they expected every Minute, especially because it was almost Noon, and they heard not the least talk of going farther. Whilst they were in this fear, the Noble-man came in, and bid them be of good cheer, and not trouble themselves about any thing, but prepare for their Journey; and after Dinner Mounting, they went for the most part Westerly through pleasant Valleys, by murmuring Streams, Rice-fields, and several Hamlets, from whence came great numbers that follow'd to see them.Rusticks come to see the Hollanders. Lodge in a small Village. An hour and a half before Night they entred a small Village, having tra∣vell'd six Leagues, where the Captain, Merchant, and two Boys, were Lodg'd in one House together; the rest were quarter'd in other Places; where the Noble-man and Governor of the Village before which their Ship lay, came to Visit them, commanding them to be unty'd,Are unty'd. and the Ropes to be taken from them, being now assur'd that they were Hollanders: whereupon they bowed their Heads down to the Ground, thanking them for so great a Civility. The Governor also shew'd them a Letter yet Seal'd, which they suppos'd to come from their Ketch Breskins, and gave them also a Cup of Japan Wine. Here the Noble-man also told them his Name, which till then he had kept private, be∣ing call'd Ontido Consaimondonne; upon whose departure and the Governors, they order'd their Servants to untie all the rest of them. The Prisoners thus deliver'd of so great a Burthen, began to take cou∣rage, and hope for a good Event, and also to take their Rest in quiet, whilst great Companies of Spectators came thronging in and out to see them. But about Midnight, the People going home to their several Habitations, they just laid themselves to sleep, when some of the Japanners came in Arm'd with two Scymiters and a Quarter-staff, which startled both the Captain and the Mer∣chant out of their Sleep; but being inform'd that they were some of the Watch, they rested all the remaining part of the Night without any disturbance. A Letter from their ShipOn the first of August, Consaimondonne deliver'd to Captain Schaep two small Packs, made up in Mats, with a Letter from his Ship, which advis'd him, that they had receiv'd information by his Letter concerning their carrying away, and the whole Circumstance thereof; on which they thought it con∣venient to Ride a little farther from the Shore. Observing a sudden change amongst the Townsmen, which come daily Aboard of them; and withall, that they would stay as long as possible they had whereupon to live. Consaimondonne order'd the Captain to answer their Letter, and withall advise them, that Consaimondonne had given order to the Villages to furnish them with Rice, fresh Waters, Fish, Wood, and other Necessaries; therefore they might stay without repining at it. Captain Schaep's letter to the Ketch Breskins.Soon after the Captain Writ again a second time what Consaimondonne com∣manded him; and withall added thereto, That they should remain where they were, though he stay'd away four Moneths, that he might not be taken in an Untruth by those Princes before whom he was to go, but that their Ketch was Dutch built, and belong'd to the Hollanders; or else the East-India Trade, and his Life, besides all those that were with him, would be in great danger. The Hollanders proceed in their Voyage.The Letter being Seal'd and deliver'd to a Priest, the Captain and Merchant Mounted on two stately Steeds, the Saddles curiously Varnish'd. Every one held now the Reyns of the Bridle in their own Hands, and were attended with two Servants, which made them to admire their Civility. The fair City Fitachi.After they had travell'd six Leagues they came to a great Wall'd City,
standing in a most pleasant and delightful Soyl. They could no ways under∣stand the Name of it; but thought it must upon necessity have been Fitachi, known to be seated in that Tract of Land. The spacious Streets presented stately Houses, and in the Houses curious Shops. Hollanders are kindly en∣tertain'd,The Hollanders were at last Lodg'd in a brave House, standing at a Corner of a Street; where Consaimondonne came to see them, and gave order to prepare a noble Dinner; and immediately after order'd them to put on those Clothes that were sent them from Aboard in the Straw-Mats. Thus Clothed, Consaimondonne took Captain Schaep, the Merchant Byleveld, the Pursor Siward Johnson, the Gunner Henry Van Ebsfoord, and the two Youths with him through the City: and had not the Soldiers clear'd the Way, it had been impossible for them to have pass'd for the great Concourse of People which came flocking from all Corners to see them; so that the whole City out of Novelty was in an uprore. Palace of the King at Fitachi.Thus being led through many Streets, they came at last into a great Mar∣ket-place, and through a pair of great Gates into a stately Court, with several Avenues, which all came out at a costly Ascent of six Steps, leading into a spa∣cious Hall; where entring, they found a high Table standing in the middle thereof; on which lay two naked Scymiters cross one another. Several Japan∣ners sitting in rich Apparel, with their Legs under them, kept Watch there. Here the foremention'd Governor came to the Hollanders, and order'd them to pull off their Shoes, and immediately after went with him and Consaimon∣donne up several broad Steps; then entring into a stately Gallery, very artifi∣cially built, the Governor commanded them to kneel and wait for the Kings coming: Where whilst they stay'd in that posture, they saw several Courtiers richly Habited,Hollanders appear before the King. Saluting and Complementing one another. At last the King appear'd in a very stately Hall at the end of the Gallery; whither the Hollanders were conducted and placed right against him one by another. The King, whom they guess'd to be about forty years old, spake to them with no less State than Friendship, Hollande, and immediately gave order, that all sorts Flesh, Fish, Fruit, and Japan-Wine, should be brought before them. But they, surpriz'd at such abundance of Kindess and great State, could not eat any thing; which Con∣saimondonne and the Governor observing, thought that their refraining from their Meat was for fear of being poyson'd; who to clear them of that doubt, went and eat a little of every Dish: at which they also fell to, and drank each of them two Cups of Wine. Strange Entertainment.After Dinner they were remov'd to another part of the Chamber, and pla∣ced next the King: Who ask'd them if they were Christians? making Crosses with his Finger, shewing he would have them to imitate him, and kiss and worship the Crosses. Whereupon they signifi'd to his Majesty that they were Hollanders, who yearly coming with great Ships, drove a Trade at Nangesaque, and brought great Presents to the Japan Emperor. Mean while each Hollander was commanded to drink two Cups of Wine more. No sooner had they drank about, but an antient Japanner came out of a Corner, and whispering Capt. Schaep in the Ear, said, Are you Portuguese, Castilians, French, English, Danes, Switzers, or Cretensers? This Japanner speaking very good Portuguese, Cross'd himself several times also, which he desir'd the Hollanders to perform: But they shew'd by their Behavior that they abhorr'd all Crosses whatsoever. At last the King caus'd the Picture of the Virgin Mary, with the Child Jesus in her Arms, Engraven in Copper, to be brought before them, to see if they would
worship it; but the Hollanders desir'd, if he would suffer them, that they might break it in pieces. Whereupon the King laughing, threw it away, and com∣manded one of his Servants to carry it to another Place: At which the Purser Sieward Johnson unbuttoning himself, shew'd his Breast, and the several Wounds which he had gotten at Ceylon by the Portuguese, mortal Enemies to the Hollanders; at which the King was exceedingly delighted. At last they re∣turn'd back to their Lodgings, where, on the next day, Consaimondonne came to Visit them, giving order, that they should have their foul Linnen wash'd; and was ask'd by Captain Schaep, When they should go to Jedo? He answering Jedo, Jedo, pointed on his Fingers, signifying fifteen days; and immediately call'd for a costly Banquet, where they had plenty of Peaches, Apricocks, Apples, Nuts, Venison, Wine, and many other Dainties. These Entertainments lasted till the twelfth of August, when in the Night a strange noise awak'd the Hollanders, not without being much frighted thereat: for a Japan Secretary watch'd over them in their Chamber; who being call'd, went out, but soon returning, wak'd them all, and bid them put on their Clothes, and wash themselves. In an instant the whole House was all in a hurry, the Men and Maid-Servants being all busie, sweeping of Chambers, shaking out Mats, and sprinkling their Halls with Water. The amazed Hol∣landers ask'd their Watch, what those kind of Preparations in the Night might signifie? Whereupon they were answer'd, That some Ladies and Persons of Quality were coming to see them, which satisfi'd them a little, sitting up three hours by as many great Wax-Candles. Then the King of Fitachi entring the Chamber nodded to the Hollanders, and sitting down, commanded Captain Schaep and the Merchant to play on the Tables, which they had made to pass away their time withall; and whilst they were busie about their Game, two Japan Knights, accompany'd with a Bonzi, entred the Chamber. The Habit of the Japan Knights.The upper Coats which they wore (by them call'd Korrekorre) were of seve∣ral Colours, very richly embroider'd; underneath which hung another, on the
Skirts of which, their Arms were curiously wrought. Their Breeches exceed∣ing long, trail'd after them on the Ground; and also in their going they trod upon them: Their Scymiters very great, hung on their left sides; of which the Handles being at least two Foot long, were cover'd with Gold Wyre, and in-laid with Precious Stones; the Scabbards also richly Embroider'd: Their Heads all shaven, except one tuft of Hair, left in the nape of their Necks. There are great numbers of these kind of Knights in Japan, who never come abroad, but they are attended by five, ten, fifteen, or more Servants, which car∣ry after them Fans and Umbrello's. Examination of the Hol∣landers by a Japan Bonzi.But the Bonzi which went in with the two Knights, speaking good Spanish, and a little English, ask'd the Hollanders, if they were French, English, Danes, or Swedes? What Place they came from? What they were freighted with? Why they came so much to the Northward from their Coast? Moreover, Whether any of them understood the Portuguese of Spanish Tongues? Amongst the Hol∣landers were some that spoke Portuguese; but they thought it better not to ac∣knowledge it, so to prevent further Examinations: Therefore speaking no∣thing but Dutch, they told him, That they set Sail from Batavia to Ternata, and from thence steer'd their Course to Tayoan; but being overtaken by a great Storm out of the South-west, they were driven to the Northward, and after four Months hapned to come to an Anchor in a Japan Haven, there to refresh themselves; which they were indeed forc'd to, most of their Seamen being sick. The Hollanders understood plainly, that they took them for Dutchmen, but such as no way concern'd the East-India Company; and that many of them had been formerly sent from Micau, or the Manillas, with Priests to Japan. Moreover, the Japanners inquir'd of them, If they were not come through the Straights of Le-maire, or the Waygates? Upon which they answer'd, No; but from Batavia, over Ternata. A whole Hour they spent in these Examinations, when at last the two Knights commanded, That every Hollander should have a Glass of Wine fill'd them; which done, the King, Knights, and Bonzi taking
their leave, went away: But in their going out, the Bonzi stepping towards the Captain and Merchant, whisper'd them in the Ear, That he could speak Spanish, eat Hens, Egs, Fish, and all manner of Japan Dainties, and that two days hence he would again come to visit them; which Promise and Sayings occasion'd many troublesom Thoughts in them: Wherefore they advis'd one another to observe well what they spoke, if they should be Examin'd one by one. The Hollanders travel to Jedo.¶ON the fourteenth of August, 1643. they receiy'd Orders to pack up their Clothes, and make themselves ready for their Journey to Jedo; two Noblemen, besides several Servants, being also ready. One amongst the Com∣pany told them, That Mosysuoque Chyoboyedonne was sent to supply the place of Oritido Cansaymondonne (he being gone home) to conduct them to Jedo. At last came the Bonzi and the Knights, that two days before, in the Kings presence had examin'd the Hollanders: In their Company was also the Lord of the Vil∣lage before which the Ketch Breskens lay at an Anchor. Soon after, a large Table was cover'd, and fill'd with all manner of Varieties: The Cups with Wine going freely from one to another, and their good Journey being also drank round, the Captain and the Merchant went each into a Sedan, and their other Men mounted on Horses, having Paper-Cloaks given them to keep off the Rain. Their Ferrying over, and Entertainment.After having rode four Leagues, they came to a quick Stream, which be∣tween two pleasant Shores flows with a great swiftness: Along the way which led towards the Ferry stood several Crosses, on which hung divers Men, after a most horrible manner; some being Rack'd, others run through with Spears, others had their Bones broken, and all died lingering Deaths, Being all Fer∣ried over, and Landed on the opposite Shore, they entred into a delightful Village, where they staid and din'd after a Princely manner. The two Knights which came with the Bonzi told them their Names, the one being
call'd Isy Cavova If a Jemondonne, and the other, Poechy Chennemondonne; which they gave the Hollanders great charge to remember, and gave them their choice, either to ride, or be carri'd in a Sedan: But all mounting, they rode most South-West, and after a Journey of eight Leagues, about the Evening they enter'd into a great Village, where they were nobly entertain'd: Jemondonne and Chennemondonne bidding the Hollanders welcome, ask'd them if they were not tir'd with riding? And setting a Watch about the House, left them for that Night. Japan Cocks carried long Journeys.The next day at the Rising of the Sun they Travell'd further towards the South-West, through a Hilly Countrey: By every Hollander went two Japan Soldiers, and seven Grooms, each of them carrying a live Cock, tied behind them on the Horse in a Straw Basket, which sometimes they took out, and carried on their Hands. This day they travell'd eleven Leagues, taking fresh Horses seven times; and in the dusk of the Evening they enter'd into a small Village, where they found but mean Entertainment. A Bonzi cunningly exa∣mines the Hollanders.Here the foremention'd Bonzi coming to them, ask'd several Questions, viz. What Employment Schaep and Byleveld follow'd? Who had the Command of the Ketch Breskens in their absence? How it was call'd? How many Seamen they had aboard? What store of Provision and Ammunition they had, and what they were laden withal? From whence they came, and whether they design'd to go? To all which the Captain an∣swer'd as little as possible could be, fearing to be trepann'd into an inconve∣niency by the Bonzi, whom they took to be an Apostate Castilian, because he spoke not only Spanish and Portuguese, but also broken English and Low-Dutch. The Hollanders Answers to his Demands.But they warily answer'd, That Schaep was Captain of the Ship, and Byleveld a Factor; That the Mate bore the chief command in his absence; That he had fifty Men aboard, which came with him from Batavia to Ternata, and were going to Tayoan; but since by dark stormy Weather, and a great Storm out of the West, they had lost their Ad∣mirals Ship, call'd Castrecom, they were at last driven to Japan, where they came to an An∣chor, because the Japanners were at Peace with their East-India Company; and the more, because their Ship being much Weather-beaten, and most of the Seamen sick, the Ship wanted mending, and the Men refreshment. All which the Bonzi noted down. Their further Journey to Jedo, how.At break of day they went on in their Journey; and after nine days Tra∣vel, they came into a Village about a League distant from Jedo: The Way thi∣ther sometimes pleasant, by Rice-fields, and Groves of Cedar-Trees; some∣times by spacious Plains and Commons: and in other places troublesom, for its craggy Ascents and steep Precipices; and also dangerous, by means of the quick Floods and deep Lakes, over which both Horse and Man were forc'd to be Ferried: But on the Shores of all such dangerous Passages, are generally small Villages built, which make them so much the safer, because upon all Occasions the Inhabitants are ready to assist in any thing. Their remarkable Enter∣tainment.¶ EVery where, both in Town and Village, the Hollanders found noble En∣tertainment, the Burgers and Merchants accounting themselves highly honor'd when they entertain the Emperors Prisoners; and besides that, they discours'd with a People that were come from so remote a Countrey, many hundred Leagues from Japan, at whose Habit and Custom they stood all amaz'd; every one desiring a Note from the Hollanders of their Names, with which they accounted themselves fully satisfied for their Expences in entertain∣ing them: Yet notwithstanding this kind usage all the way, the Netherlanders were continually guarded by six Bonjoises, and a hundred and thirty Soldiers.
Description of the Ja∣pan Musicians.¶ DUring these nine days Travel, they met with several of the Japan Musi∣cians, which go up and down the Countrey, to delight and entertain all such young People as are desirous of Musick, and chiefly to inquire out Weddings, or where any great Feasts are kept, being all Whores and Vaga∣bonds one amongst another. The Women sit with their Legs across under them: On the top of their Heads is a black Paper Roll, from whence falls a long Scarf over their Backs: Their Tunicks, with Embroider'd Collars, are open before, betwixt which space appears a pleited Girdle: In their Hands they hold two Sticks, plated over with Copper, on which they play ve∣ry curiously. Behind the Women sit Men, on high Stools, with their Legs across: These are also cloth'd in short upper Vests, open before; their under Garment made all of one piece; their Breeches hanging over their Feet; their Doublets tied about them with two pleited Girdles, one about their Breasts under their Arms, and the other about the Waste; in the lowermost stick their Swords: They hold in each Hand a Whip, the Ends whereof being tied together, have a hollow Block, with Bells in the middle, which waving to and again over their Heads, makes a noise pleasing to their Ears, keeping Time with their Feet on the Stool. On both sides of the Women that sit, others stand bare-headed: Over their right Shoulder lungs a broad Belt, to which, coming under their left Arm, a round Wheel with Copper Bars is made fast, which they turn with their right Hands by an Iron Handle, whilst they strike with the other on the Bars with a Bell, to which Musick they dance very neatly. Before these, sit others, with their Faces muffled, in their left hand holding a great Umbrello, and in the right a Fan, acting several Antick Postures. The Hollanders come to Jedo.¶ THe Hollanders being sometimes thus delighted, came within a League of Jedo, where the Lord of the Village before which their Ketch
lay took his leave, telling them, That their Seamen had weigh'd Anchor, and were gone to Sea; but he knew not the time when. This caus'd great fear in the Netherlanders, who thought they should certainly be taken for Spies, that came to make Inspections into the Countrey; and according to the Japan Cru∣elties, expected nothing but Death. In the Afternoon they enter'd the Imperial City Jedo, where they were Lodg'd in the usual place of Residence for the Holland Ambassadors, when at a set time they come thither from Nangesaque, to present the Emperor with many rich Gifts. Here they were inform'd, That it was not the City Fitachi, but Namboe, from whence they went on the fourteenth of August, after having staid there fourteen days; and also, That the Haven wherein they rode at Anchor before the Fishers Village, was part of the great Inlet Namboe. They rode one day with another ten or eleven Leagues, and saw by the way above a hundred close-built and populous Villages. In this their Journey from Nam∣boe to Jedo they chang'd their Horses eight times. Are very jealous of a Japan Nobleman.But the Hollanders had scarce sat half an Hour to rest themselves, when Oritido Cansaimondonne, who took leave of them in Namboe, and they thought long before that time to have been at his own House, came into their Cham∣ber, to the great amazement of the Hollanders, they being always fearful to be unjustly dealt with, thinking by that means Oritido might inrich himself with a part of their Ship and Goods, if they should be condemn'd at the Court; which they fear'd the more, because they being Strangers, had none to plead for them, and declare their Innocency. Consaimondonne seem'd to be highly displeas'd, that he saw the Hollanders lodg'd in the usual Inn for the Netherland Ambassadors, fearing that he might be deceiv'd and frustrated in his expecta∣tions; yet he shew'd a fain'd Friendship. Captain Schaep asking him concern∣ing the two Letters given him in Namboe to deliver, receiv'd no Answer; which made him judge, that he had detain'd, and not deliver'd them. Hollanders are command∣ed to come to Court.¶ AGainst the Evening, Captain Schaep, the Merchant Byleveld, and the Youth Jacob de Paw, were commanded to appear before the Gover∣nor Inovii Sicungodonne, and Sabrosaimondonne Governor of Nangesaque, whither they went, accompanied by their Landlord, and two Servants. Thus being carried to the Commander Sicungodonnes House,How entertain'd there. into a stately Hall, after a lit∣tle stay, they were led into a Princely Chamber, where fitting down a while, they were afterwards commanded to draw near Sicungodonne and Sabrosaimon∣donne: Both shewing a friendly Countenance, said, O Hollande. Next to them sat the Spaniard, an Apostate Priest, which had accompanied the Netherlanders from Namboe. Are examin'd about their Journey.This Bonzi, by the command of the two Lords, question'd them, From what Place they put to Sea, and whither they intended to Sail? Why and to what end they came so far to the North? Why they put into the Haven Namboe? The Hollanders mixing broken Japan, Portuguese, and Dutch together, answer'd them to most of their Questions: Then the Spaniard fetching a Map of India, commanded the Hol∣landers to shew them their Voyage in it, viz. both what they had already Sail'd, and did intend; which being perform'd, they receiv'd each two Cups of Wine, and leave to depart. On the next day all the Hollanders appear'd before the same Lords; and whilst they stood in the foremention'd Hall, the Lords being not ready to come forth, they saw several Japanners, which also came thither for Audience;
amongst which, were two which spoke very good Portuguese,The Japanners seek ac∣quaintance with the Hol∣landers. and said that they were Merchants, and liv'd in Nangesaque; that they knew Mr. Elsrake, Overt∣water, and other Netherlanders in their Store-house on the Island Disma; asking them also, if none of them could speak Portuguese; and, if they had no ac∣quaintance with those Persons which they had nam'd? The Hollanders signi∣fied to them, That they were not experienc'd in the Portuguese Tongue; but that they had seen Elsrake and Overtwater in Batavia. These Merchants seem'd to be much concern'd at the trouble into which the Hollanders had brought themselves. After they had thus waited two Hours, came the Secretaries belonging to Sicungodonne, accompanied with some Portuguese and Spanish Priests, which had apostatiz'd from the Christian Religion:Are anew examin'd. These inquir'd again concerning their Voyage, asking them also what they intended to do in the Bay of Namboe? In what Latitude the Inlet lay? Which they a second time shew'd them in the Chart that they brought, according to which, it lay in thirty nine Degrees; That they lost their Admiral in the Night, before an unknown Countrey, in a dreadful Storm; and that afterwards they endeavor'd to get up to Nange∣saque, but through contrary Winds were driven to the Northward. During this Discourse, Captain Schaep, the Merchant, and the Youth, were led to a spacious Gallery from the other People, where Sicungodonne and Sabro∣saimondonne sat in State, having just before been busie about Trying of Priso∣ners for their Lives: But being set down before the two Lords, they were ask'd nothing of any consequence; only each of them being commanded to drink a Cup of Wine, they had leave to return to their Lodgings. In their going out, they saw in an open Court of the Palace four old, yet strong Se∣dans, made very fast round about; in each of them sat a Prisoner,Roman Priests Prisoners. being Por∣tuguese Fathers. Strange Passage which frighted the Hollanders.But the remaining seven of the Hollanders, which were examin'd by the foremention'd Priests, were not a little afraid: For whilst they sat there, two great Chests of Portuguese Coats, Clokes, Surplices, Books, Writings, and also Iron Hand-cuffs, Fetters, Chains, and other Instruments for Torture, were brought into the Hall; every one of them judging, that they were fetch'd thither on purpose for them; being ask'd also, at that very instant, if they were not Roman Catholicks. This their fear was the more augmented, because the Hollandeas had scarce rested half an Hour in their Lodging, but they were commanded by Sicungodonne to return again to the Court; by which they judg'd, that the condemn'd Priests had accus'd them of something that might be prejudicial to them. Japanners deal severely with four Jesuits.Entring the Palace, they found the Executioners busie in torturing four Je∣suits, of which, according as they guess'd, the youngest might be forty, the other fifty, sixty, and seventy years old: They were Habited after the Japan manner, yet might easily be distinguish'd from them. The Executioners us'd them very barbarously, lock'd their Hands in Iron Cuffs; their Feet they load∣ed with weighty Chains, and Pinion'd them up in such a manner, that they could not stir one Limb. This Sight did not a little terrifie the Hollanders, who were again strictly examin'd concerning their Voyage; and chiefly the Spanish Priest which came with them from Namboe, ask'd, If their Ship Breskens had not taken in some Por∣tuguese Priests, either at the Manilla's or Macau, and put them on Shore in the Bay of Namboe at unseasonable hours? If they were not Roman Catholicks? Both which
Demands Captain Schaep answer'd with No: Sieuward Johnson opening his Breast, shew'd them also the great Wounds scarce whole, which he had recei∣ved from the Portuguese at Ceylon, and therefore would never desire a move joy∣ful Day, than to revenge himself on the Portuguese Nation: in which Rela∣tion Sicungodonne and Sabrosaimondonne took peculiar delight. The Names, Age, and Offices of the Hollanders are written down.Then the Hollanders return'd again to their Quarters, where at Night they were visited by the Spanish Priest, and two Commission'd Lords, which were to write down every Man's Name, Age, and Office; so that they writ down in a Book Henry Cornelison Schaep Captain, aged thirty two years; William Byleveld Merchant, four and twenty; Sieuward Johnson Purser, thirty three; Peter Gerritson Cooper, twenty six; Abraham Pieterson Spelt Gunner, twenty two; Henry Elsford Mate, twenty; Jurian Sholten, also his Mate, twenty seven; Hans Slee Boatswain, twenty; Aert Bastianson a Youth, fifteen, and Jacob de Paw, a Boy of fourteen years old. Two Japanners disco∣ver themselves.The Two Lords making themselves known, told them, That they had served their East-India Company for Interpreters, and that one of them was call'd Kitsbioye, and the other Phatsiosaimon, and were sent from Nangesaque to conduct the four condemned Jesuits thither. They told them moreover, that there were two Dutch Interpreters coming from Firando to Interpret for them before the Magistrates, who would for that purpose be in Jedo within thirty days; at last telling them, that they should Lodge in the House with a Priest that had apostatiz'd from the Christian Religion; yet they should no ways be daunted, for there was not the lead danger in their Concern; and they ought the less to fear, because they assur'd them of the Lords Sicungodonne and Sabrosai∣mondonnes Favors, and Sicungodonne had given order to their Landlord, that he should not let them want for any thing. After this nothing happen'd to them of any remark in nine days time, onely that the Interpreters now and then visited them. Hallanders are exceed∣ingly frighted.But the first of September seem'd to put an end to their Tragedy, so that they all prepar'd themselves for Death; for the Interpreters Kitsbioye, Phatsiosaimon, Siovan, and a considerable number of the Emperor's Guard, carry'd the Hol∣landers out of the City Jedo;Description of the Ja∣pan Horse and Foot. the Foot wearing little round Helmets, wrought like a Shell on the top, their Coats being of Mayl, hung half way over their Bellies, ty'd about their Middle with a Sash; in every ones Girdle stuck two Scymiters, one long, and the other short, which below the Handles have round Shells of Ebony-wood, by which they hang; their Breeches like the Noble∣mens hung over their Feet; on their Shoulders they carry'd Musquets not unlike the Europeans, onely the Cocks thereof struck from them, and instead of Bandileers or Powder they had square Baskets pleited of Rushes. But others belonging to the Emperors Life-guard Rode on Horses; which being train'd up daily by skilfull Riders, Curvetted all the way they went, with rich Ca∣parisons Edg'd with costly Fringe, their Heads also cover'd with a rich Cloth: but in Service they wear Helmets adorn'd with Plumes of Feathers, and Scarfs coming under their Arms, and made fast on their left Shoulders; a thick silken Cord with two Tassels hangs about their Necks, and on their Backs a great Bowe; under their left Arm a Quiver full of Arrows; in their Girdles stick two Stilletto's, or long Daggers, with their left Hands guiding the Bridle, in the the right holding a great Lance, their Legs cover'd with Wax'd Boots. Hollanders prepare for Death.The Hollanders thus Guarded on all sides both with Horse and Foot, were carry'd out of Jedo.
Close by the City is a great Palace about the bigness of a small City, which entring, after having past several Avenues, they came before a dismal and dark Prison; before the Grates of which the four condemned Jesuits sat loaden with great Fetters and Chains, with some other Japan Christians; from thence they were conducted into a spacious open Court, in which stood Gibbets, Crosses, Gallows, and great Wells full of Water. The Place swarm'd with People, and chiefly one Leaded Entry Pav'd with Free-stone, was continually full of all manner of Courtiers, private Officers, Executioners and Hang-men, which passed to and again, expecting Commands. At last the Jesuits and the Japanners were brought out of their Dungeon, to come before the chief Magistrate of Japan. And whilst the Judges were busie in examining them, most part of the Day was spent: Mean while the Hollanders stood in the open Court next the Guards, which had brought them from their Inn thither, where they saw all Passages; and that they might not faint in so great a Crowd, they had Sweet∣meats given them to eat; which they judg'd was by Sicungodonne's order. At last they were led through a small Gate, to a very pleasant Place, having on one side a Woodden Gallery cover'd with Mats; through which passing and entring into a Princely Hall, they were commanded to kneel before Sicungo∣donne, sitting on a high Throne surrounded with a great number of Councel∣lors, who by the Interpreters ask'd the Hollanders these following Questions: Questions ask'd the Hol∣landers, to which they re∣turn Answers,From whence, whither, and when they put to Sea? Why they Anchor'd in the Haven Namboe? The Hollanders answer'd, That they set Sail the third of February, Anno 1643. from the Road before Batavia, and steer'd their Course towards Ternata, from whence they weighed Anchor the fourth of April; but afterwards driven by great Storms, were necessitated to Anchor in the Haven Namboe. Then Sicungodonne ask'd them if they were Christians, though no Papists? If they did not desire to speak with the four Jesuits in private? Their Answer hereupon was, That they were Christians, but no Papists; and
believe in one God, Creator and Governor of Heaven and Earth; for which Religion they were ready to die; and had nothing to say to the Jesuits, but held them for their greatest Enemies. The other Questions which they were ask'd were these following: How many Netherlanders, Chineses, and others, liv'd in Batavia? Where their Governor kept his Court? How many Ships hath he in his Service? What Places do they Sail to? Do all manner of Artificers live in Batavia? Do Shoe∣makers, Taylors, Weavers, and other Handicrafts reside there? The Hollanders told them, That there liv'd about twelve hundred Hollan∣ders in Batavia, besides three thousand Chineses, and a considerable number of Malabars, Javans, Bandaneesen, Amboiners, and Mardikers, and also all manner of Handicrafts, resided in the City: but the number of the Ships which Sailed to Persia, Ceylon, Cormandel, Malacca, Siam, Molucco-Islands, Tayoan, and other Places from Batavia, was unknown to them. They were also ask'd, If the Hollanders saw any way by which they might Conquer Nangesaque,Are silent in one Que∣stion. as they had done Quilang? But making as if they under∣stood them not, this Question was not answer'd. Sicungodonne enquir'd of them also, Why their Ketch Breskens had fir'd her Guns several times in the Haven of Namboe, which had frighted the Fisher∣men, and all the Countrey People thereabouts? Also if they had not a Mini∣ster aboard? The Hollanders acknowledg'd, That the hady fir'd with bare Powder on the intreaty of some Japan Gentlemen which came Aboard of them to view the Ship; and that they had not the least intentions to scare the People, which they not once thought of, being accustom'd to do the same before Firando, when any Gentlemen desir'd it: but out of fear they deny'd that they had a Minister Aboard. At last they were ask'd if they could not swim, as they had seen many Hol∣landers do at Nangesaque? This Question amaz'd them much, not knowing why they should ask it; yet they reply'd, That some could swim, and others not. Sicungodonne leaving off to make any farther Examination, gave the Hollanders leave to go to their Lodgings; where they rested till the three and twentieth of September, without any farther molestation. Then the Secretary told them, that their Landlord was gone to the Lord Sicungodonne's House, to ask for some Clothes for them, because the cold Weather began to pinch, and they were us'd to go warm Cloth'd. Sicungodonne promis'd to furnish them with Coats. He also signifi'd, that the imprison'd Jesuits and Japanners, not being able to endure the exquisite Tor∣tures, had deny'd Christianity. The next day the Interpreters Kitsbioye and Fatsiosaimon, with the Renegado Priest Siovan, came and brought for every Hollander two Japan Coats made of Cotton by Sicungodonne's Order. Which kindness the Hollanders knew not how to return sufficient thanks for. A new fear arises amongst them.Mean while understanding by some of the Servants, that the next day they were to appear before some of the Magistrates, they were exceedingly afraid, and the more, because they very well knew the two Dutch Interpre∣ters expected from Firando, could not yet be come to Jedo. And whilst they sorrowfully sate considering of these Matters, the Walls of the House be∣gan to shake, the Timber to crack, the Roofs to rent, the Doors and Windows
flying open, and the Ground to move under them: At which the Japanners signifi'd to them, that a horrible Sea-Monster struck his Tail so vehemently against the Shore, that he made all things to shake and tremble. The Japanners Opinion concerning Earthquakes is antient.But under this kind of ignorance seems to lie hid the antient Opinion of some Greek Philosophers, which gave to Neptune the Name of Ennosigaeus, that is, A shaker of the Earth, because it creeps into the Crevices thereof, and breaks the Foundations with its swelling Waters. This Opinion Thales and Democritus Abderita affirm'd with these Arguments, viz. Because that in Earthquakes new Fountains often broke forth, and great Places lay hid under almost fathomless Lakes and Plashes of Water. But others with much more seeming Reasons attribute tke Earthquakes to the Winds inclos'd in the Caverns of the Earth. Agellius puts both the said Reasons together; Who are not, saith he,Nost. A. A. l. 2. c. 19. sufficiently instructed by Nature, whether the shakings and gapings of the Earth are occasion'd by the power of imprison'd Winds, or inclos'd Waters, swelling within the Earth: Wherefore the Romans order'd a solemn Day of Humiliation to be kept, when any great Earthquakes happen'd; but they express'd not of what God they sought for help, because they knew not whether it were Aeolus, Commander of the Winds, or Neptune, Lord of the Seas, that shook the World. Japanners are much ter∣rifi'd at an Earthquake.The Japanners are exceedingly terrifi'd at Earthquakes, knowing by dear Experience, that Mountains have sunk into deep Pits, Villages turn'd topsie∣turvey, Cities and whole Territories swallow'd up; therefore when the inner parts of the Houses began to crack, the Walls to totter, the Mats which cover'd the Floors to move, and other Houses here and there began to tumble, every one ran to seek for a Place of safety, their amazedness was so exceeding great; which indeed was no wonder; for who would not be afraid when the firm Earth affords no sure Foot-steps? when it falls in under Towns and Villages? An enemy may be repuls'd by high Bulwarks, and inaccessible Ways; against great Storms, Harbors are sure Guards; Fire follows not those which flye from it; raging Sickness, though it empties Cities, yet swallows them not up: but the Earthquakes hide oftentimes under heaps of Rubbish, or almost bottomless Pits, Mountains, Cities, nay, whole Territories, without leaving the least Mark behind; so that whole Generations of People are buried with the Ruines of their Habitations. Why the Hollanders were less afraid.The Hollanders seem'd to be less afraid than any, because they not onely knew of their Mortality in what Place soever they were, but that they might easily suffer an involuntary Death, not yet knowing how they should come off, but that they were at the pleasure and dispose of a barbarous Nation. It would be no great matter of difference to them, if some merciful Japanner (if such a one might be found any where) cover'd their Bodies with Earth, or if the Earth it self perform'd the Office: for without doubt they should suffer a far more easie Death under than upon the Earth. Strange alteration in Japan by an Earthquake.Most part of the Evening this Trepidation continu'd, onely giving several shakes: for at other times Japan feels greater sorrow by these Earthquakes, because it often happens there, that the Earth sinks, or makes terrible gapings, Rivers swelling overflow, cooling hot Springs, and making hot cold; that Flames break forth from the Mountains, or on the contrary, that burning Mountains are quenched by Earthquakes; that plain Countreys become Moun∣tains, and Mountains turn into Plains; that Islands are blown up out of the Sea, and others sink under Water.
The reasons of Earth∣quakes descrid d after di∣vers manners.We must acknowledge it to be a great Wisdom, which is not onely satisfi'd by the outward appearance of such horrible Motions, but also searches into the Secrets of Nature, to find out the Reasons of such Trepidations. The Ja∣panners (as we said before) ascribe it to the Water, or rather (according to their Custom and idle Fancies) to a Sea-Monster. But those that ascribe it to the Water, differ in their Opinions: Some maintain (according to Thales Milesius) that the Earth swims upon the Sea, and is moved by it almost like a Ship. Others say, That the Earth is cut through by continual flowing Streams, by immense Lakes, inhabited round about by a People which know not one ano∣ther, and by Fountains that never cease to spout forth Waters through undisco∣verableble Springs, which all have their original under the Earth, and either flow gently there, or else descend into some deeper Caves, and gather together again in several Places, by which means swelling they lift up the upper Grounds, so shaking the Earth, and all that which it bears. But Anaxagoras makes Fire to be one reason of Earthquakes; so that the Fire hath the same operation in the Earth as in the Air, when it drives the Clouds and rents them with Thunder. Amongst the Modern Philosophers some are of Opinion, That the dreadful gapings and Hiatus of Earth is occa∣sion'd by Fire, not unlike a Myne, in which Powder being laid and set on Fire, blows up the Earth, according to the Invention which the Biskainer, Peter Na∣verius, being taught by Francis George of Scenen, try'd first upon the Castle Ovi, close by Naples. Pliny also saith,Lip. 2. c. 79. That the shaking of the Earth is like Thunder in the Air. Moreover, it cannot be deny'd, but that the Earth feeds. Fire under it, which appears by the continual Smoak, and sometimes by the Flames which ascend the Skie from several Mountains,Burning of Mountains. whereof Vesuvius in Italy; Aetna, in Sicily; in Island Hecla, and in Japan, Siurpurama, lying eight Leagues beyond Meaco, near the great Lake Meacosche, are sufficient testimonies. The reason of the sinking of Cities.It is not therefore improper which some believe, That the sinking of Cities and Countreys proceeds from the Earths being consum'd by the Fire, which requires Food; not unlike a House, which (the Pillars and other Timber being devour'd by Flames) wanting Supporters tumbles down. Some also hold, that the Fire in the Earth produces continual Smoak, which finding no Vent, forces and breaks its way out; so that if the Smoak be very strong, it rents and cleaves the Earth asunder; but if it be weak, it causeth onely a shaking of the upper Grounds. But Anaxagoras judges the Earth it self to be the reason of her own unfirm∣ness; for he saith that it is nothing without which moves it, but great Pieces within falling, either loosned by moisture, or consum'd by Fire; or the Winds which rage under Ground, blown down, or else being decay'd by Age, like an old Building, of which the Foundation being rotted, and not able to bear the Superstructure, tumble down. These Pieces are the great occasion often∣times of a general sinking, or at least, a shaking of the upper Grounds, by the blow which they give in the fall. Winds the reasons of Earthquakes.This Opinion is contradicted by Archelaus, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and most of the chief and Learnedst Geographers, which ascribe the Reason of Earthquakes to the Winds, viz. The Earth produces always Mists, either dry or moist, which rise so high up into the Air, that not able to get farther, they descend again, and creep into all the Crevises of the Earth, which when they have fill'd up, and the one Wind seems to force in upon another, makes it seek for Vent:
which kind of striving occasions those violent Emotions oftentimes bursting open, and swallowing up all that is on the top. Several Opinions con∣cerning it.Yet some are of another Opinion concerning the Winds, judging that it is with them as with a humane Body, which is moistned by Blood, and mov'd by the Spirits or Vitals, which get in and out by some little Pores, but gather in far greater Places, so long as the Body is of a good Temper, the Pulses beat temperate: But if it meets with any stoppage inwardly, then the Breath is stopp'd and troubled, and sometimes strange Convulsions produced; so like∣wise the Winds in the Earth being molested, and wanting Vent, make a rum∣bling and terrible motion, till at length they force out their way. It hath often been observ'd by the Japanners, that the greatest Earthquakes have happen'd in calm Weather when the Winds are shut up into the bosom of the Earth. But amongst all others (according to our Judgment) the famous Philoso∣pher Epicurus seems to come nearest the truth, who is of Opinion, That Earth∣quakes may proceed from the falling of the Earth into deep Pits, or its consu∣ming by Fire, whether the sulphurous Grounds occasion the Flame, or whe∣ther a collection of fiery Spirits changes into Fire, and breaks forth like Light∣ning, or inclosed Winds have the greatest force. But the Dutch Prisoners in Jedo were not so much in fear for the Earth∣quake, as for a far more terrible Death than to be kill'd by the fall of a House; for they knew the Japanners cruelty: neither could they expect any good in their preparation, being order'd to come before some of the Council; so that they spent the whole Night with melancholly thoughts without sleeping; yet in the Morning the Earthquake and their fear ceased both on a sudden, at their coming the Interpreters Kitsbioie and Phatsiosaimon, who brought them informati∣on of the occasion of their being commanded to come forth that day, was only to return the Council thanks for the Presents of Japan Coats; and accordingly the Interpreters conducting the Hollanders to the Presidents Palace, they made humble returns of their thanks. Strange dealings of the Councellors with the Hol∣landers.But the Councellors delighted themselves with asking the Hollanders, If they knew not where their Ship Breskens was at that present time, having weighed Anchor, and was gone from the Haven Namboe? If they took the Roman Reli∣gion to be the onely true Faith? Whereupon Captain Schaep answer'd, That he did not know whether the Ship was gone to Batavia, Taiovan, or Nangesaque; and that they abhorr'd the Papists Religion. After this every Hollander received two Cups of Wine, which having drank, they were commanded to shew them some antick Postures, to make wry Fa∣ces, and look asquint, to go splay-footed, and swing their Arms to and again, which the Japan Lords took great delight to see: when they were at the heighth of their Pleasures they were commanded to depart. Costly Buildings in Jedo.Being conducted back to their Lodgings by the two Interpreters, they saw in the Way which they pass'd several Palaces, in which Beauty and Art seem'd to strive with each other; being built exceeding high, the Roofs in the Front jetting over before, each Corner supported by Gilded Dragons and Bulls, all the Front adorn'd with Carv'd Imagery, the Windows richly Trimm'd with Gold. The Dutch Prisoners are much troubled, and why.In the interim the Hollanders were exceedingly troubled, because they had not told the Design of their Voyage at Court, which was to Sail for Tartary,
and the River Polysanga, to discover the Western America, and the Gold and Silver Islands, which Mr. Elserak might possibly have told to the Governor of Nan∣gesaque: Wherefore if they should be accus'd with Untruths, they had nothing to expect but a miserable Death. After serious Consideration of so weighty a Matter, they found it convenientest not to acknowledge that they they un∣derstood Portuguese, in which Language they were examin'd by Kytsbyoye and Phatsyosaymon, before Sicungodonne; and also resolv'd to give a full and true Relation of their intended Voyage, when the two Dutch Interpreters should come from Firando. A Letter to the Dutch Prisoners.Mean while they receiv'd a Letter from Nangesaque, subscrib'd by John van Elserak and Peter Antonizon Overtwater; the Contents as followeth. This Instant, being the tenth of September, we are advis'd by the Go∣vernor of Nangesaque, That Captain Schaep and the Merchant Byleveld, coming to an Anchor before the Territory Mansany, were entic'd ashore by the Japanners, and carried Prisoners to Jedo, they not knowing what People you were; but understanding now what Nation you are of, you will with∣out doubt in a short time be set at Liberty. Here all things are well. Five of our Ships lye before Disma at an Anchor, which have made a Voyage from Batavia hither in a very short time. The East-India Company will reap great Advantages this Year. Agree amongst your selves, and doubt not. We expect your coming hither. We should have written more at large, were not the Letters sent by the Governor of Nangesaque's Post. Whilst we are busie concluding, we receiv'd a Letter from Jedo, written by Kytsbyoye, That there are ten Prisoners of you, all lodg'd by the East-India Companies Interpreters, and well entertain'd. We hear also, that the Ketch Breskens hath weigh'd her Anchor, and is gone from Namboe. Their Discourse with the Interpreters.The day after the receipt of this Letter, Kytsbyoye, Phatsyosamon, and Syovan, being told by Sicungodonne, That Elserak had inform'd the Governor of Nange∣saque, that the Council in Batavia had fitted out two Ships the third of February, Anno 1643. to discover a place of great Trade in Tartary; this place being al∣ready known by eminent Writers: And also a Native Tartar was in one of the Ships, which would assist in promoting that Undertaking; and Elserak believ'd, that Breskens was one of those two Vessels. This being told to the Holland∣ers by the Interpreters, they acknowledg'd it to be really true; but because they had lost their Admiral Castrecom by a Storm in the Night, they did not proceed in their Voyage; and chiefly, because he carried six Tun of Rice for the Ketch Breskens, for want of which they were drove to a great strait, and their Provisions growing very short, they concluded either to Sail, if possible, to Nangesaque, or Tayoan, or else to return back to Batavia. This their Resolu∣tion they were not able to perform, being driven by Storm still further and further to the Northward. Japan Maps, after what manner.¶ WHilst they gave this Account, Syovan fetch'd a Map Printed on Japan-Paper, like unto a half Globe, which contain'd in a small Circum∣ference the Provinces of Japan and Amboyna, Molucco Islands, Manilla, The South Sea, Borneo, Celebes, Malacca, Formosa, Corea, and other Territories lying in that Cor∣ner of the World. They found also in the same Map the Countrey which they lighted upon in forty two Degrees, spreading East-North-East from the North-West part of Japan, sixteen Leagues off at Sea: But they could see no Passage that went through betwixt that and Japan; so that they took that Coast for
the Countrey of Jesso, which joyns to Japan: For the Inlet betwixt Sungaer and Jesso washes not through, reaching scarce forty Leagues upwards, being there stopp'd by the Mountains, which spread themselves over the Japan Province Ochio. Description of Jesso.¶ THe Bigness of Jesso (full of Mountains and rich Furs) is, as we said before, unknown; notwithstanding the Japan Emperors were so much concern'd at the Discovery thereof, that they sent Persons thither on purpose, if possible, to learn how far Jesso extends it self: But they travelling over high Mountains, and deep Valleys, a vast way into the Countrey, could find no end, but brought Information to the Emperor, That the Inhabitants were a Wild and Salvage People. So after a toilsom Journey, they were forc'd to return with no Effect. The Hollanders found Jesso to be in forty seven Degrees, seeming to spread it self a vast Way to the North-East. This Map shewn by Syovan, represented Jesso to lie a hundred Leagues from Japan; notwithstanding it joyns with the Province Ochio to Japan. Moreover Jesso spreads it self so far, that it borders the Northern America; so that the Straights of Anian, generally by Geographers plac'd between Kataya or Kitai, and the Northern America, is not found in the foremention'd Map; and accordingly no Passage from the Frozen Sea, into the South Sea, which was always held infallible: Wherefore several Europeans, and chiefly since the Year 1380. have sought a way by the North, through the Straights of Anian, to Sail to the East-Indies. The first Undertaker of this, was Nicholas Zenet; being afterwards fol∣low'd by Gaspar Cortez, who discover'd a new River; and going again a se∣cond time, never return'd. That of Michael Cortez, Gaspar's Brother, undertook again that Voyage, with as bad success. King Henry the Seventh ventur'd also to open a Passage through the Straights of Anian to the East-Indies. Of Gabottus.Sebastian Gabottus a Venetian, taking the Business in hand not long after, re∣turn'd fruitless, and brought his Ship through a thousand dangers, being sadly damag'd by the Ice, into an English Haven. Of Varasanus.Yet all these unfortunate Expeditions terrified not John Varasanus, who rela∣ted such pleasing Stories to Francis the First King of France, that he Equipp'd a Vessel at his proper Charge, which Anno 1524. set Sail for the Northern Ame∣rica: But Varasanus going ashore, with most of his Men, on the Promontory of Brittain, was there destroy'd by the Salvages, and scarce Men enough left in the Ship to carry her back to France, with the News of this Accident. Of Gomez.Notwithstanding this sad event, Sebastian Gomez a Spaniard went the Year af∣ter, steering his Course towards the North-Pole, where he suffer'd a considera∣ble time by extremity of Cold, and great floating Castles of Ice, which so op∣pos'd him, that he was forc'd to return with like bad success. Of Willoughby.England not satisfied with that fruitless Voyage of Gabottus, prepar'd a second time for the Voyage, Anno 1553. for which purpose, Sir Hugh Willoughby, a little before the death of Edward the Sixth, got a Ship, wherewith he Sail'd to seventy two Degrees, through the Ice, where he died of Cold; but a few being left alive, brought the Tidings of their unfortunate Success to the King. Of BorSomewhat better Success had Stephen Burrow, in his Voyage; who setting Sail three years after Willoughby, discover'd in the North Galgoivia and Nova Zemla; but then was hinder'd by the Ice from going further to the Straights of Anian.
Of Forbisher.After that Martin Forbisher set out two small Vessels; but because he came after the time, and too late in the Year, was forc'd to leave the Frozen Ocean, and return. Yet he was not so satisfied; for Queen Elizabeth took such a liking to Forbisher's Design, that she gave him a Vessel of three hundred and sixty Tuns, with two Ketches, and stor'd them with six Months Provision. The twenty sixth of May, Anno 1577. Forbisher set Sail from Harwich: On one of the Islands of Orkney he went ashore, but found all the Inhabitants fled from their Huts, in the middle of which they had their Hearths without Chimneys: On one side were the Peoples Lodgings; on the other, a place for their Cat∣tel; and in a Corner lay some dried Fish, and a few Oats. After having Sail'd six days, since they left the Haven of the Orkneys, he met for a whole Month with several great Trees, which without doubt had by extraordinary Floods been wash'd up, and so carried into the Ocean: This was the less dangerous, because he had continual day-light. At last Forbisher Landed on the North of America,The Northern Americans are very wild. in sixty eight Degrees; where he found a Gigantick People, with long Hair, who endeavor'd subtilly to murder him, they being exceeding Sal∣vage: Their Clothes made of Wild-Beasts Skins, of which the Tail hangs be∣tween their Legs: Their Tents made of Whalebone, are cover'd with Hides, and the Entrance faces the South. They use Bowes, Arrows, Slings, and two sorts of Skiffs, whereof the biggest, carrying seventeen Men, is made of several pieces of Wood joyn'd together, and on both sides cover'd with Lea∣ther: The little ones are also cover'd with Leather, and not unlike a Weavers Shuttle; in the middle of which is a Hole, for one Man to sit, who ties the upper Covering of the Boat about his Middle, and with one Oar makes ex∣ceeding swift way through the Water. The Soil is very barren of any kind of Fruit or Grain; only it feeds abun∣dance of Deer, Hares, Wolves, Sea-Bears, and Hogs, not unlike a Wolf: The raw Flesh of these Beasts serves the Inhabitants for Food. It seems that this Countrey is exceedingly troubled with Earthquakes; for in many places were seen pieces of Hills, and in other places whole Moun∣tains, that were strangely rent from one another. The fourth of August, Forbisher returning, came safe on the seventeenth of September into Milford-Haven, and brought besides his Ballast of glittering Stones, a Salvage Man, his Wife, and Child, who signified so much to them, that the Mans Name was Calichoe, the Womans Egnoge, and the Childs Nutive; yet though notwithstanding they were fed, according to their Custom, with raw Flesh, they liv'd not long after being brought from their Countrey. Besides Forbisher, Arthur Petreus and Charles Jackman discover'd some Coast higher,Davises Voyage. belonging to Nova Zembla: And John Davies Sailing North-West to sixty one Degrees, entred a Channel which to this day bears denomination from him, but it is not known how far it extends. After that,Hudson's. Hudson ran into an Inlet or Bay beyond Davises Straights, and found a great Sea in the Heart of the North-America. Thomas Button Steering after Hudson,Button's. also directed his Course Westerly, and discover'd a great Inland Sea in the Heart of the North America, lying in fifty seven Degrees. Thomas Jacobson's.King Charles the First also fitted out two Sail, under the Command of Tho∣mas Jacobson, Anno 1631. and Sailing into Hudson's Straights, he Steer'd Southerly to fifty Degrees; but there stopping, return'd with no other Success, than cal∣ling that vast and barren Countrey of America, lying between Hudson's Straights and Button's Inland Sea, New Britain.
All these, besides Peter Jackman, have sought for the Straights of Anian, Sailing Westerly through the Northern America. William Barenson'.But William Barrenson thought to find the Passage behind Russia and Tartary, and so through Anian to reach the Empire of Japan, which that way is judg'd to be but twelve hundred thirty five Leagues from Holland. On the fourth of June, 1594. he set Sail with four Ships, and got through marvellous great Flakes of Ice, to the height of eighty seven Degrees, where they saw several Bears, either swimming towards their Ship, or running over the Sholes of Ice. They found also very many and large Sea-Calves,Sea-Calves, what Crea∣tures. being Amphibious Crea∣tures, living both in the Water and on the Land: They have a Mouth like an Ox, out of which stick two Tusks, each half a Yard long, which are ac∣counted as good as Ivory: Their Skins of so great a hardness, that no Sword, Pike, Battel-Ax, or other Weapon whatsoever, can pierce it, nor kill them, un∣less hit in the Temples of the Head. The time began to expire, when William Barrenson Steer'd his Course through the Waygates, by him call'd the Straights of Nassaw, Sailing close by the Promontories and Capes of Nova Zembla, when he discover'd a Cross, plac'd on a high Point; where Landing, he found several Mens Footsteps, and six Sacks of Rye-Meal: A Musquet-shot further, stood another Cross, by three Houses, built after the manner of the Norwegians: In these they saw only some Tubs of Salt Meat. The fifteenth of August the three Ships which had Sail'd more Easterly came to their Admiral Barrenson, having been much cumber'd and troubled by the Ice, but since gotten through the Straights of the Waygates, and Sail'd sixty Leagues into the Tartarian Sea, which was very salt, full of Whales, and the Bottom not to be reach'd by our Line. And although this was all they did in that Expedition, yet they hop'd for a good Event. Hemskerk's Voyage.The States of the United Netherlands taking the Business in hand, fitted out the Year after the first Voyage seven Sail, under the Conduct of William Ba∣renson and Jacob Hemskerk: In seven Weeks time they got into the Waygates, where fifty four Men went ashore, and travelling two Leagues up into the Countrey, found a Track of Foot-steps of several Men, Hedges loaden with Train-Oyl and Furs, and a Hill, whereon were plac'd several hairy Images, before which lay Ashes, and the Bones of burnt Deer, which without doubt had been kill'd there for Offerings. After that, Hemskerk receiv'd certain In∣formations b Skiff from Pitzore, loaden with Sea-Calves Teeth, Train-Oyl, and Geese, being to load in the Russia Ships which Sail through the Waygates and Tartarian Sea, by the River Oby, to the City Ugloita in Tartary, where they Winter. The Pitzoreans signified moreover, That the Waygates would be froze about ten Weeks after that time. At last, nine of the Sea-men that went up into the Countrey, met with twenty Samoyedes, going five and five together: They being ask'd concerning the Scituation and State of Nova Zembla, in∣form'd them, That beyond a Promontory lying about five days Journey from thence, towards the North-East, was a great Sea, which spread it self to∣wards the South-East several hundred Leagues: So without making any fur∣ther Discovery, the Fleet return'd home, after a Voyage of four Months and sixteen Days. Thus having had no better Success for two several Expeditions, the States of the United Netherlands prepar'd a third Fleet, promising great Rewards to those that could open a Passage for Ships to sail to Japan by the North;
at which Amsterdam seem'd much concern'd, though nothing had been effected in it: Whereupon they set out two Ships, the biggest of which was Com∣manded by Hemskerk,His second Expedition. and William Barrenson Chief Pylot; and the other, by Cornelison Riip. Both of them Sail'd through vast Seas of Ice, to eighty De∣grees, where they discover'd a Grassy Countrey, full of Cartel; whereas No∣va Zemla, which lieth seven Degrees more Southerly, hath neither Grass, nor any Cattel, unless Foxes and Bears. They found in a Bay of this Green Coun∣trey two Islands, and on them, divers Egs of Sea-Fowl. Till the eight and twentieth of June they Sail'd backwards and forwards, along this Coast, to see if they could find any Way that led through; but the Ice increas'd at last so upon them, that they were forc'd to return. Hemskerk and Riip also could not agree to go any further: At last they concluded, That each of them should Sail where he pleas'd. Riip endeavor'd in eighty Degrees to find a way into the Tartarian Sea; but being forc'd to leave his Design, return'd to Holland with no other Success. Hemskerk, on the contrary, inspected all the Coasts of Nova Zembla; so getting to the Island Orange, lying before Nova Zemla, at the utmost Northern Point, where he was hemm'd in by the Ice, which according to their Plummet, was twenty Fathom thick under the Wa∣ter, and twelve above. The Ship driving against these Mountains of Ice, receiv'd a great Leak in her Prow. September began by this time to come on apace, at which time the Sun begins to hide it self there for three Months: The Place desolate and unhabitable, the Cold insupportable, Firing scarce, no Houses nor Provisions to be found any where; so that they had all expect∣ed Death, had not some of the Seamen travell'd up two Leagues Southerly into the Countrey, where they found a sweet River, full of Trees, and Planks driving in it,Is very remarkable. which serv'd them for a Hut, which they built not without great danger of Bears, and exceeding trouble, by reason of the extraordinary Cold; not having finish'd it before the latter end of October. After that, they were miserably tormented, within by the Smoke, and without by Bears, North-East Winds, and Mountains of Snow, betwixt which they were forc'd to pass, to carry their Firing into the Hut: Thus they spent their time till May, which drawing near an end, and also their Provisions growing scant, they prepar'd their Boats; and though grown weak by their Wants and Suffer∣ings, yet they stood out to the Offin. In these Boats they pass'd through the wide Ocean; and when the Waves went too high, they hawl'd them on the Ice, where they were assaulted by the Bears. In this their Voyage home, Wil∣liam Barrenson died, and several others; twelve Men only escaping with Life, through a thousand dangers coming at last to Kilduin, from whence they Sail'd to Amsterdam. The Straights of Anian not mention'd in the Japan Map.So that all the Voyages which have been made, to Sail to the East-Indies by a Westerly Course, through the Northern America; or Easterly, along the Coast of the Samoyedes, and Tartary, through the Straights of Anian, have been of no effect. And if the Map shewn by the Apostate Japan Priest Syovan be right, then all Voyages to the East-Indies, if Sail'd Northerly, would be in vain; be∣cause no passage is found therein between Catay and America, from the Northern Ocean (which the Samoyedes call Marmare) to the South Sea. In the same Map, Jesso was made to border on America, and Tartary lay to the In-land, and separated from those Coasts: Wherefore Syovan ask'd the Dutch Prisoners, How they could have saild to Tartary, since it lay so far Southward from the Sea? And on the North though it be wash'd by the Sea,
yet they could not put in there, because there is no Channel runs between Tar∣tary and the South-Sea. Hugo Grotius his mistake concerning the Inhabitants of America.By this plainly appears the Mistake of the Learned Hugo Grotius, who saith, That America was Peopled out of Norway, over Yseland, Friezland, Greenland, and Estotiland, through vast and Icy Seas. For if there be no Water-pas∣sage betwixt America and Cataya, then the Peopling of America may more pro∣bably be from Cataya, than from Norway. Without all doubt, one People or Nation have driven another from their Countreys, the Weaker still giving place to the Stronger. The Passages of Ancient Times manifest this suffici∣ently. It cannot be denied, that the spreading of Mankind over the Earth after the Flood, must be sought for on the Armenian Mountain Ararat (which the Turks call Agri Dagh; and the Armenians, Messis Saur) on which Noah's Ark landed. Armenia it self borders on the North with Colchis, Iberia, and Albania; on the West, with Cappadocia; on the South, with Mesopotamia; and the East is wash'd by the Caspian Sea. The Generations of Mankind increasing and multiplying, sought in all places for newer and greater Habitations: Those which sprang up in the North-East, took Tartary and Catay into possession, from whence they spread themselves further over America: And that this hapned many Ages ago, may appear by those Europeans that discover'd America; for they found this Coun∣trey, and all the Islands, which lie scatter'd up and down in great numbers, so exceeding Populous, that they might well stand in competition, for the Num∣ber of Inhabitants, with Europe, or any other part of the World; but are so different in their Language and Customs, that the one hath not the least re∣semblance with the other; whereby it may partly appear, that as they remov'd their Stations presently after the Confusion of Tongues that hapned in the Valleys of Shinar, the Passage from Catay to America, about the North, is very easie; whereas that from Norway thither, is much farther, and more trouble∣som, between Flakes of Ice, and under a Cold Heaven: For no where Ame∣rica borders on Asia, but near the Straights of Anian, if such a Channel were found; but more probably on the Territory of Catay. However, the first Plantations of People belong originally to Asia. Forbisher found the Northern Americans to be broad Fac'd, with long and black Hair, Camosie Noses, woolly Beards, and of a swarthy Complexion: Their Religion, worshipping the Sun, which they call'd Hyout. By all which, they seem to be rather of a Tartarian Extract, than from Norway. Syovan's Arguments to the Hollanders concerning their Voyage to Tartary.These Reasons perswaded Syovan, that it was impossible for the Hollander to Trade by Shipping into Tartary, because the most Southerly part of that Coun∣trey lay a great distance from the South-Sea; and the North was not to be Sail'd to out of the South-Sea, because the Straights of Anian was not menti∣on'd in the Japan Map. Whereupon Captain Schaep replied, That Tartary,Schaep's Answer concern∣ing the Tartarian Trade. so call'd from the mighty River Tartar, is wash'd on the North by the un∣navigable Ocean Mamare; the West border'd by Muscovy; the South jutting against the Caspian Sea, Bactriana, India, and China; the East borders America, and is divided into five several Territories, which are these, viz. The Wild Tar∣tary, whose Inhabitants keep no constant Place of Residence, removing daily, according as the Pasture for their Horses, Cows, and other Cattel lasts; yet although they range thus up and down without Law, they have their own In∣closures, beyond the Limits of which they may not go: These Parks or Forests
are call'd Zarolhia, Casane, Nagaia, Schibanoka, Casakka, Astoacan, Baskirda, and Tumen, all being under the Emperor of Russia, besides Tumen the Tartarian Pro∣vince, Zagatai is very famous for the Inhabitants call'd Kircasii, and the Cities Sakasba, Bichend, and Samarcande, the native Countrey of Tamerlane. The Pro∣vince Turchestan hath the Cities Taskent, Cotam, Cascar, and Jarkem. The fourth Province call'd Cataia, under the great Cham's Jurisdiction, is divided into seven Territories, viz. Tendue, Camul, Engimul, Caindu, Thebet, and Carazan, where the Men in stead of the Women, when deliver'd of a Child, keep their Beds two and forty days; the seventh Territory is Tangud, where Printing was us'd a thousand years ago. The Tartarian River Polisange.Moreover, Captain Schaep signifi'd to Siovan, That the River Polisange came flowing out of the Tartarian Territory Cataie into the South-Sea. The Banks of this River Polisange, whose original is a hundred Leagues from the Sea where it disembogues, are adorn'd with the famous Trading Ci∣ties, Quinsen, (in which Paulus Venetus saith are twelve thousand Bridges, under which great Ships may pass with all their Sails spread) Jangio, Brema, and Cam∣baly, whither the chief President of the East-India Company in Batavia had sent the Ship Castrecom and the Ketch Breskens, to discover that River, and all the other Cities: but he being separated from the Ship Castrecom, whom he fear'd was lost, he found himself necessitated to put in for some other Part, and leave off that Design. At last Captain Schaep told him, That since he understood not the Portuguese Tongue, and much less the Japan, he would give a full Rela∣tion of all his Adventures to the Emperor's Privy Council so soon as the two Dutch Interpreters came from Firando to Jedo. Upon which Answer Kitsbioie, Phatsiosaimon, and Siovan, departed from the Hollanders. Hollanders advise amongst themselves.Mean while the Hollanders concluded with one accord to declare to the Council that which they had oftentimes said before, viz. That since the eleventh of June, when they came for fresh Water into the Haven of Namboe, and put out again, they stood direct into the Sea, plying it up by a Wind two hundred Leagues, to Weather the South-Point of Japan, that so they might at∣tain to forty Degrees Northern-Latitude; and at last being toss'd and driven up and down by a Southern Storm, they were necessitated a second time to put in for Namboe, Furthermore they found it convenient not to declare their in∣tentions of going to the Gold and Silver Islands. Whilst the Holland Prisoners tarried in the Dutch Inn in Jedo, they were vi∣sited by some Japan Nobles; amongst which also Phoechychemon, Isicauwa, and Joaiemon; who comforted them, asking them if they were entertain'd with good Meat, Drink, and Clothes against the Cold of the Night: Phoechychemon fetch'd a Paper full of Itsibos, which is a sort of Japan Gold-Coyn, giving it to Captain Schaep, and withall promis'd him more if he desir'd it, then giving him a Roll of the Mens Names belonging to his Ship, which he had requir'd of him be∣tween Namboe and Jedo: he desir'd him to Transcribe two fair Copies of it, which he promis'd to keep in memory of the Hollanders: Captain Schaep taking the Scroll, assur'd him to prepare the Copies according to his desire against his next coming. The two Dutch Inter∣preters arrive at Jedo.On the last of September in the Evening, the two Dutch Interpreters came from Firando to Jedo, and immediately visited the imprison'd Hollanders; the eldest of them was call'd Tosaimon, and the youngest Maniekebe, both seem∣ing to bear an affection to the Hollanders, advising them how to carry them∣selves before the Council, viz. That they must answer quick and short upon
any Question that was ask'd them, in which the Japan Lords are us'd to take great delight. They also told them, that they were not to Lodge in their Inn, as they had been misinform'd, but that they should be Entertain'd in Tonno∣samma's House, Lord of Firando. The Hollanders are Exa∣min'd before the Council concerning their Voyage to Tartary.The next day their long-expected Examination began before Sicungodonne in this manner: The Interpreters, Tosaimon and Maniekebe, propos'd the following Questions by order of Sicungodonne, to Captain Schaep, the Merchant Bylevelt and Jacob de Paw: When, and with how many Sail did you come from Ba∣tavia, and since from Ternata? Whether did you design your Voyage? How came your Ship so far to the North? Why did you stand to and again before the East-Coast of Japan? and why dropp'd ye Anchor in the Haven of Namboe? Their Answer.To which they answer'd, We set Sail from Batavia on the third of February, Anno 1643. and steer'd our Course for Ternata, with two Ships call'd Castrecom and Breskens; the fourth of April we weighed Anchor from Ternata to Sail to Taiovan, and from thence to Tartary, that there we might discover a Place for Trade, according as we had been inform'd: But Sailing on with this inten∣tion, were driven by a great Storm that happen'd in the Night on an un∣known Coast; after which we lost the Ship Castrecom, judging that she may be split against the Rocks; yet we sought for it along the Japan Coast, though we had little hopes of finding it: mean while we suffer'd under a great incon∣venience, by reason of the scarcity of our Provisions, because the Ship Castre∣com carry'd six Tun of Rice for our Pink, to be put aboard of us when our need should require it; therefore because she could not be found, we were forc'd not to proceed in our Journey for Tartary, and according as Wind and Weather would permit to Sail to Taiovan, Nangesaque, or Batavia, so soon as we were furnish'd with fresh Water, which we had great want of on the East-Coast of Japan, and therefore stood directly thither. The tenth of June we entred into the Mouth of the Haven Namboe; where we came to Anchor, and were courteously receiv'd by the Inhabitants, and instantly furnish'd with what Wa∣ter we requir'd; so that on the next day we stood again to Sea, and steer'd directly Easterly, that we might first Weather the South-East Point of Japan; at last we laid it over due West, but by Southern Storms and contrary Cur∣rents were so driven towards the Japan Shore, that we fell a whole De∣gree to the Northward from our intended Course, having then according to Calculation, Sail'd about two hundred Leagues from Namboe: Thus toss'd by Tempests, and the Vessel requiring necessary repair, and the Seamen weakned by four Moneths endurance on the Offin, and most of them sick, some speedy refreshment was necessary; for obtaining which the Haven Namboe was the nearest to Sail to; and having before been kindly entertain'd there, we re∣turn'd thither, but staid with our Sails hal'd back till some of the Inhabitants came to us in Boats; of whom we ask'd leave to Anchor in the Haven be∣fore the Village: which Request was granted by the Chief of the Town; so that upon his leave our Men row'd ashore to fetch him Aboard; who desir'd to barter some of our Merchandise for Provision, of which they had great store. Questions ask'd the Hol∣landers by the Council, on which their Answer is re∣quir'd.Moreover Tosaimon caus'd them to be ask'd where Tartary lay, or the City whither they were sent? and also if ever any European Ships Sail'd to those Places for Trade? Whereupon the Hollanders answer'd, That to their know∣ledge never any Europeans had Sail'd to Tartary; and they had likewise no Map
nor Chard to direct them thither, but had Orders from the Governor of Bata∣via, which was, That when they came beyond the utmost North-part of Japan, to steer their Course North-west to forty five Degrees, where the River Poly∣sange disembogues into the South-Sea. On the Banks of which River stand the Cities Brema, Jangio, and Cambaley, all three famous for Traffick; but because they never got to above forty Degrees, they received no other information, neither could they say any more concerning it, but what had been told them in Batavia, Their other Questions were these: If they should discover Tartary, what would they do to understand the Inhabitants? Captain Schaep reply'd That they had three Sea-men Aboard of the Ship Breskens that understood and spoke the Muscovitish and Polish Tongue, which most of the Tartars understood: and in the Ship Castrecom a Native Tartar. Tosaimon ask'd, How they came by that Tartar? What Age is he? What Office performs he? The Russians (said Schaep) making an Inroad into Tartary, amongst the Pri∣soners which they took was a Youth, whom they sold to an English Merchant, that carry'd him Amstredam, to where he learn'd to speak Dutch, Write and Cy∣pher, and at last was entertain'd in the East-India Companies Service; so that he was sent as an under-Book-keeper to Batavia: which Office he supplies to this day, and is twenty years old if the Ship Castrecom be safe, and not cast away. The Hollanders Answer to Sicungodonne.Sicungodonne then caus'd them to be ask'd, Why they stood so long off and on upon the Japan Coast? If they did not do it to discover their Creeks and Harbors? Why they fir'd their small and great Guns before Namboe? Their Answer was, That the Officers of both their Ships calling a Coun∣cil, agreed before Ternata, making a Letter of Obligation; in which both were bound, that if by Storm, Current, Mist, or otherwise, they should be separa∣ted between Ternata and Japan, that they should look one for another on the Japan Coast, and in dark Weather now and then to fire a Gun, that by that sign they might the easier find one another; but notwithstanding this Agree∣ment they Shot but once, which was in thirty seven Degrees and a half, out of a sixteen Pounder, for their Boat to come Aboard again, that was sent to a Japan Fisher-man, to enquire concerning the Ship Castrecom. In the Haven of Namboe they had fir'd several times onely with Powder, which was done upon the entreaty of some Japan Lords that came to see the Ship. Manikebe inter∣rupting him said, Why have you not made it known heretofore that you in∣tended for Tartary? Schaep answer'd, That it was through ignorance of the Japan and Portuguese Tongue in which they were Examin'd, so that it was im∣possible for them to answer and give an exact account of things they under∣stood not; and since that the Lord Sicungodonne himself telling them that they would be strictly Examin'd before the Council, so soon as the Dutch Interpre∣ters came from Firando to Jedo, made them refer answering punctually till then. After that the Hollanders had one days rest: the third of November they were again carry'd out of Jedo to the Court, where in twenty eight days they had one Hearing; at that time having no Watch upon them but the two Interpre∣ters, and having waited two Hours they return'd to their Lodging, the Coun∣cil not meeting that day by reason of the abundance of Rain that fell till the ninth of the said Moneth, all which time the Hollanders stay'd in their Inn, and
then were again carry'd to the Court,Appear the second time at Court to be Examin'd. notwithstanding the great Showers of Rain had made the Ways almost unpassable. Entring the Court with the Inter∣preters, they were carry'd into a Place where they never were before, which caused no small suspicion in them; which was augmented, because the Nobleman Phoechichemon fetch'd the Captain and the Merchant from the rest of the Hollanders, which he left half an hour standing in the Rain to wait for the Council, which were then at Dinner; at last they went for shelter under a a Portal, from whence they enter'd into a spacious Hall, where Phoechichemon being busie about filling them some Wine, the News came that the Council sat; whereupon they immediately went thither, and Captain Schaep and the Mer∣chant were commanded to kneel by a Woodden Gallery; before which Sicun∣godonne sat in a Princely Throne, who again ask'd those Questions which had been demanded of them at his House concerning the two Ships, Castrecom and Breskens; to which the Hollanders answer'd as before they had done. Behind Sicungodonne the Council was placed, which they could not have a full sight of. New Questions put to the Hollanders by the Coun∣cil.Their Examining began thus afresh: When, where, and wherefore did you come on the Japan Coast? How could you entertain any good thoughts, when you stood to and again from our Shore, and firing your Guns. Captain Schaep answer'd, The one and twentieth of May, in the heighth of seven and thirty Degrees and a half, we had sight of Japan, and there lay off and on, so to find our Admiral, whom we had lost, according to our Agreement before Ternata; and notwithstanding it was concluded on in a dark Night, the the better to give one another notice to fire a Gun; which was not done above once, and that onely for to give their Boat warning to come Aboard, which was sent to a Japan Fisher-man, to enquire for their Admiral Castrecom, and they staying somewhat longer than ordinary, Shot according to their Custom to command them Aboard. But Manikebe ask'd them, Out of what insight did not your People declare that you were Hollanders when you went Aboard of a Japan Fisherman, ten Leagues beyond Jedo, exchanging Rice for Fish? and hence you could not but know, that the Emperor of Japan keeps Guards on all the Promontories and Points of Land along the Sea-Coast, to watch for the Portuguese Ships, who commonly put their Priests ashore in such private Places; Why did you not whilst you Cruised on the Coast send some of your Officers ashore, that might tell our Magistrates you were Hollanders? your neglecting of this Duty made the Inhabitants of Namboe suspect you: The Emperor also resented it very hainously, that you should offer to fire several Guns on his Coast, which is certainly reported to the Council, though you deny it, for which Crime you are liable to be punish'd. The Hollanders Answer.These Questions Schaep answer'd thus: The Japan Fishers receiv'd full sa∣tisfaction for their Fish: and moreover they entertain'd them with all civility, giving them Arak, and what else they desir'd, by which they might well judge we were Friends and no Enemies; besides, we inform'd them as well as we could possible, that we were Hollanders; but whether they understood it or not, be∣cause not being able to speak the Japan Tongue, we know not. Furthermore, we have not the least knowledge concerning the Emperors Watches, nor of that Order of coming ashore to make themselves known: and as for often Shooting they were altogether ignorant of, because they fir'd but once, and that was for the Reason aforesaid: and as for what happen'd, and was done
in the Haven of Namboe, was upon the entreaty of some Japan Lords; so that if any other great Guns have been heard to fire, they must needs have been from the Ship Castrecom, or some other Vessels. Tosaimon's Examination.Whereupon Tosaimon again reply'd, Since you are Hollanders, to whom the Emperor grants a free Trade, why did you not freely ask for Masts, Yards, Rice, Provision, and other Necessaries, of which you might have had enough in the Haven of Namboe? Why did none of you go before the Magistrates then? Did the Governor of Batavia command you to put in for Japan, or did you come thither of your own accords? What Officers have the chief Com∣mand of the Ketch Breskens and Castrecon? Who will certifie the Emperor that your Voyage was for Tartary, and not rather to Land Portuguese Priests, be∣cause at present there is Peace concluded between the Portuguese and the United Netherlands? Schaep's Answer.Captain Schaep answer'd, When on the first time they entred the Haven of Namboe, hundreds of Japanners came flocking Aboard of them to see the Ship, who being kindly entertain'd by us, granted that we should furnish our selves with fresh Water, which then was all we defir'd, and also told them that we were Hollanders: after which being toss'd by Tempest, we were a second time forc'd to stand for Namboe, but entred not the Harbor before we had leave from the Governor; who also granted us to buy all manner of Necessaries for the Ships: for which purpose coming ashore, we were carry'd Prisoners to Jedo, without the help of Witnesses to certifie that we were Hollanders; and accordingly the Emperor's Friends. Furthermore, they had no absolute Com∣mand from the Governor in Batavia, nor the Indian Council, whether to put in for Japan, nor to keep off from it; but to make a Letter of Agreement be∣fore we came from Ternata, to the end that if their Ships should be separated by Storm, or otherwise, they might the easier find one another again: by both their Ships Councel before Ternata the Japan Coast was judg'd to be fittest for that purpose, because it lay in their Way. The Command over both the Ships belong'd to the Merchant, Captain, and Pilot. Lastly, although the War between the United Netherlands and the Portuguese be laid aside for some years (concerning which a Writing was made by the Prince of Orange and the States, under which the East-India Company are comprehend) yet notwithstanding that the Portuguese Priests were sworn Enemies to them, because of an irreconcileable difference in their Religion: wherefore they would willingly suffer the cruel'st Death that could be imagin'd, if they could any ways be accused to have put any Priests on the Japan Coast. Manikebe's Examina∣tion.Manikebe ask'd moreover, Whereabouts Tartary lay? How they could find it without a Map? How they came to know that such Cities for Trade were seated there? How can your People (said he) be without Maps, whereas you have those of the whole World, where Tartary is also? Without doubt the Pilot of the Ship Castrecom hath a Map of Tartary; and would you not be ama∣zed to see such a one sent from Nangesaque. Schaep's Reply.On these Questions Captain Schaep again made this answe: We could not get a Map of Tartary any where, but had Orders from the Indian Council, that when we had Weather'd the utmost North-Point of Japan, to steer North-west, and if we could meet with no Land, to keep on till forty five Degrees, then stand to the Norch-east to six and fifty Degrees Northern Latitude, where the River Polisange disembogues into the South-Sea. On the Banks of this River are erected several famous Cities for Trade, accordingly describ'd in credible
Books; but because no European Ships have ever Sail'd thither, we could not find a Map of that Coast, and therefore would not regard any Chard that should be made by Art which was not real: and from thence it proceeded, that the Hollanders, though they have Maps of the World, yet they place no Sea-Coasts therein, but what are discover'd by Navigation. They could also with real truth affirm, that the Ship Castrecom was unprovided of such a Map; and if a Map of Tartary might be seen from Nangesaque, it must without doubt be one of the Inland-Countreys, and not of the Sea-Coast, because to our knowledge never any European Ship Sail'd thither to discover them. Enquiry after the Religi∣on in Holland.Manykebe ask'd moreover, Are the Hollanders not Christians, and believe in the same God that the Portuguese do? What Fast-days do they keep? Keep they not holy the day on which the Cross was found? Are there no Popish-Priests in Holland? What difference is there between the two Religions of the Hollanders and Portuguese? The Answer thereupon.These Questions were thus Answer'd, The Hollanders are Christians, and ac∣knowledge the Trinity, by which the World and all things therein were Crea∣ted about six thousand years ago, and is yet preserv'd and govern'd: They keep no Feasts, but one day in seven, call'd, The Lords-Day, on which they rest from all manner of Labors, and go in great companies to their Churches. In private there liv'd some Roman Priests that had small Congregations, for which they were often times punish'd by their Judges, by reason of the great difference between the Roman Religion, and that Opinion which the Hollanders embrac'd, who abhor the Pope and all his Doctrine, and are onely bound, neither to add nor diminish to one Book or Word Written by God himself, through his Apostles: As for any farther difference, they were not able to give them any account, because from their youth they had been brought up at Sea; and it was the least of their business to enquire after the Roman Religion, being well satisfi'd with the knowledge of the true Faith which their Forefathers had embrac'd. Japanners enquire con∣cerning the manner of the Dutch Sea-fights.Moreover, Sicungodonne caus'd them to be ask'd, What Design those Ships had that Sail'd yearly from Batavia, and Cruis'd about the Cape Spirito Sancto, and before, the Manilla's? If ever they Engag'd and Conquer'd any Spanish Ships on that Coast? If a small Ship can overcome a great one? If they carry'd no Breast-Works or other Defences from Shot in their Ships? The manner of a Sea-fight? What use they made of their Hangers, Battel-Axes, Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Muskets, Harnesses, and Helmets? Captain Schaep told them, That the Councel at Batavia sent Ships to Cruise before, the Manilla's, and there to wait for the Spaniards Plate-Fleet, which came yearly thither through the South-Sea; but yet had miss'd of it till that time, onely some years ago they met with one Ship which was sunk. The manner of a Sea-fight was thus; When two Sail of an equal bigness, discover one another, every one seeks at first to get to Wind-ward of the other; so soon as one hath his desire, he falls down upon him that is to Lee∣ward, Fires at him, afterwards claps him Aboard, sends a Company of his Men over into the Ship, with Hangers, Granadoes, Fire-Balls, Pistols and Bat∣tle-Axes; upon which, both Parties Engage so fiercely, that either the one Par∣ty or the other, is for the most part slain: The Ship to Lee-ward being Smo∣ther'd by its own and the Enemies Smoke, hath his Enemy Aboard before he is aware. But a great Ship is very hard to be taken by a small one, except it be well-Man'd and a good Sailer, and in a dark Night, claps the great Ship
Aboard, putting Men enough in her to Master her; and whilst both Ships Fire Bullets, Croes, and Iron-Bars, none are Shot-free, but what stand on the Bal∣last; for the Iron-Balls which flie to and again, not onely batter all they touch, but kill most of the Men with the Splinters which flie from the sides of the Ships: Lastly, Harnesses, Helmets, or any other Iron Armor was not us'd Aboard, but in their Battels on Shore. Concerning the taking of Quelang.Sicungodonne proceeded asking, How have you Hollanders Conquer'd the Fort Quelang? Lay there any Guns on the Castle, or not? By what Nation was it Besieg'd? The English which Traded formerly in Japan, with whom are they at Peace, and drive a Trade? Whereupon Bylveld answer'd, None of us both, said he, hath ever seen Quelang, but of what we have heard we shall relate; The Fort was well provided with Guns, when the Hollanders made Trenches to the Moat of the lower Castle, where they threw up a Plat-Form, from whence they fired so fiercely with Half-Canon and Morter-Pieces, that the Be∣sieg'd dishearten'd, quickly Surrender'd. After which, the upper Castle made but little Resistance, so that the Soldiers having leave to depart with their Lives, Surrender'd: It was Garison'd by Spanish Souldiers, and Inhabited by Spaniards. As to the English, they drive a great Trade in many places in India, viz. in Surrat, Cormandel, Macassar, and Bantam, are friends with France, Spain, Por∣tugal, Germany, and Holland, and imbrac'd the same Doctrine that was taught in Holland; yet some Popish Priests also liv'd privately amongst them. The Hollanders are strict∣ly examin'd.Till this time, their Examinations pass'd without any great suspicion of Danger; but now, Sicungodonne broke forth in a great Rage, and caus'd them to be ask'd by the Dutch Interpreter Tosaymon, How durst the Hollanders in the Ketch Breskens drop a Popish Book in the Bark of the Japan Fisherman, with whom they Barter'd for Fish some Miles beyond Jedo? They should immedi∣ately make known the Contents of the Book, and what Design they had in so doing, or else their Executioners knew a way by Torture to make them relate the truth, of which they might see several Examples by the Japan Priests. Captain Schaep and Byleveld, testifi'd both together, That they had not the least knowledge of the Book of which they were accus'd; But if such a thing was done out of ignorance by any of the Sea-men, they would according to their Ship-Laws, for an Example to others, have him punish'd severely. Toysaman interrupting them in their Answer, said, It is a Popish Book full of Pictures of Saints, and though you Hollanders seem to testifie your Innocency in this Business, it shall not be a sufficient Excuse for you. Sicungodonne also said, The truth hereof will in a short time appear; to tell apparent untruths before the Japan Council is a Crime so great, that no punishment whatsoever is sufficient for it. Schaep and Byleveld reply'd agan, That they would willing∣ly suffer Death with all imaginable Tortures, if they could any way accuse them, to have err'd from the truth. After these Examinations, the Councel rising, parted; and Schaep and Byle∣veld came again to the rest of their Company, which they found sitting in a great open Court under a Pent-House, observing, and seeing many various Passages, all sorts of People walking by them, amongst which were some Wo∣men accompany'd with Boys that carry'd Dishes of Meat to sell.Description of a Japan whore. The Women Apparel'd in Japan Coats, that trail'd after them on the Ground, and folded over before in such a manner, that the Nipples of their Breasts were bare; about their middle, a broad Girdle adorn'd with Flowers; their Sleeves large and wide, through which appear'd under the right Arm another Sleeve, all
Slash'd, which hung out on the top of the left Arm; their Hair hanging loose about their Head, onely one Lock behind ty'd full of all sorts of Ribbons, which the Hollanders understood afterwards to be common Whores, which ge∣nerally sit in open view under a Pent-House before their Doors, on three corner'd Stools, with Dishes of Meat in their Laps; on both sides of them stand two Pots cover'd, being full of Meat and Drink; so inviting those that pass by to a good Entertainment, and their kind Embraces at a cheap Rate. Strange entertainment of the Hollanders by the Ja∣panners.But the foremention'd Sea-men, who waited with a longing desire to know how the Examination between their Captain, Merchant, and the Councel pas∣sed, were exceedingly amaz'd; when both the Captain and the Merchant were a second time fetch'd from them, without having time to speak one word, and were carry'd by Phoechemon through a little Door, at the end of the great open Court, which made the Sea-men judge, that so pittiful an Entry must needs lead to a place of Torture. The same thoughts had Captain Schaep and Byleveld, and expected a resera∣ble day, for no sooner being pass'd through the Door, but they came into a lit∣tle Yard, wherein stood three great Tubs full of Water, they well knowing that the Japanners us'd them as their greatest and chiefest Tortures: When the Exe∣cutioner lays the Sufferer on his Back upon the Earth, so tying him fast, and pouring this Belly full of Water, makes him disgorge it by stamping on his Breast and Belly; but soon after their fears vanquish'd, being carry'd to the Interpreters, Taysoman and Manyckebe, in a Princely Hall, where by Phoc∣chychemon they were entertain'd with Wine, Rice, and other Dainties, and in the Evening carry'd to their old Lodging. The next day they were again Examin'd, and Schaep and Byleveld being brought before Sicungodonne, were commanded to answer to all those Questions which had been ask'd, and they had answer'd to before; which was done, one∣ly to see if they agreed in their Story: But besides the former Questions, these were added.
Questions of the Japan∣ners.The Japan Councel can no way believe, but that your People have a Map of Tartary; perhaps the Pilot hath it, and you do not know of it; for there is no Ship that comes to an Anchor before Nangesaque, but what hath a Map: How is it possible to Sail blind-fold without this great and necessary help? After what manner could you Sail to Tartary without it? To these Questions Schaep Reply'd thus: Honor'd Sirs, As to what was said Yesterday, that we had no Map of Tartary in our Ship, is very certain, and nothing but truth: We are also assur'd, that the Pilot hath no such Chart. Concerning the Ships that An∣chor before Nangesaque, their business is clear contrary, for they may easily have Maps, because they come along a Navigable Sea, of which Maps are made ready to their hands. But because no European ever Steer'd for Tartary, therefore the Sea-Coast thereof cannot possibly be mention'd in any Map; however,The manner of Sailing by a Compass. our Ketch is furnish'd with Compasses, which are a great help to us, for when we come from any known place, we can by taking an Observati∣on of the height of the Sun, and the North-Star, (yet not without a Compass) return to the place from whence we came. Furthermore, our Order was from the Indian Council at Batavia, That when we came so far as our Maps directed us, which is to thirty nine Degrees, and Weather'd the utmost North-Point of Japan; then to Steer according to the Globe, of which we had two in the Ship, and so to make a Map of our own Discoveries, Steering North-West to find Tartary, in forty five Degrees. Japanners have a Duth Globe.Schaep added moreover, And if it please his Lordship Sicungodonne to produce a Globe, we will shew you where Tartary lies, and also the River Polysange, and the rich Cities for Trade, seated along its Banks; that we may plainly shew you whether we design our Voyage: Sicungodonne caus'd immediately a Globe (which had formerly been given him by Master Elserak) to be fetch'd; but still looking grimly upon them, did not Command the Hollanders to shew him any thing in it, onely shew'd it them afar off; and going on in his Discourse, said, For what reasons did you not tell the Councel, that your People want∣ing a Map of Tartary could make use of a Globe, of which you had two Aboard? Schaep Reply'd, We answer'd on all things that were propos'd; but con∣cerning the Globe or any other helps in Navigation, they were not Examin'd about. Tosaymon in Sicungodonne's Name ask'd them again, Why did you Fire your small and great Guns before our Coast, which is taken exceeding ill by the Emperor: and though you deny it, yet it is told us for certain truth? How often did you shoot in the Haven Namboe? Byleveld's argument a∣gainst Japanners.Byleveld Reply'd, That they could not help it if any false Accusation came against the Hollanders; yet they would testifie upon Oath, that they fir'd but once on the Japan Coast: And being Anchor'd upon free leave of the Gover∣nor in the Harbor Namboe, several Persons of Quality came Aboard to see them, and entring into the Cabbin, they found their Pistols and Muskets lying in their usual places, which they taking up, wonder'd that they would go off with∣out Fire, wherefore out of curiosity, they pulling the Tricker Fir'd: After∣wards upon their Entreaty, the great Guns were shot off about fourteen times with nothing but Powder. But Tosaymon said, How could the Japanners Discharge your Fire-Locks, when as they know not to handle them? What kind of Arms are those Fire-Locks and Pistols? We are also inform'd, That the Hollanders shot their Guns off themselves, and not the Japanners, who are too ignorant to learn those things in so small a time.
To which Schaep Reply'd, It is a small Art to Discharge a Pistol, for we our selves Charg'd them, and afterwards Deliver'd them; these Arms strike with a Flint on a Steel, which making Fire, blows up the Powder in the Pan, by which means the Piece goes off. Tosaymon said, That he had seen such kind of Arms in the Netherland Ships Riding before Firando: Upon which Sicungodonne caus'd a Dutch Pocket-Pistol, which had formerly been given him, to be brought into the Court, and ask'd Tosaymon, If those that he had seen were like that? who told him, that they were of the same fashion, but longer. Then Schaep proceeding on, said, It need not seem strange, that the Japanners can use the Hollanders Arms, there being nothing else to be done, than to pull the Tricker towards them with the foremost Finger: Whilst these Examina∣tions pass'd in Sicungodonne's House, there sat a Japan Priest next the Hollanders, who oftentimes would accuse them, and tell it to Sicungodonne. Further accusation against the Hollanders.Moreover, Manykebe ask'd them, Why did you resist with Hangers drawn when you were taken Prisoners? Did you not expect that the Emperor would resent it very hainously, for you to come as Spies, and make Inspections into his Coasts? Why did you not make known that you were Hollanders? Have none of you ever been in Japan? Do you know Mr. Elserak, Overtwater, Kocke∣bakker, and Caron? Will not Caron come again from Holland to India? Their answer to it.These Questions were answer'd by Schaep, who said, Believe most Honor'd Sir, that we are falsly accus'd of making refistance, when under the pretence of Friendship we were Betray'd, and misus'd like the worst of Villains. Why should we resist, being in a strange Countrey, and beset round about, and saw not the least place to escape? Should eight Hollanders go to make a way to their Boat, which without doubt was Guarded with hundreds of Soldiers; none of us were provided with Arms, but onely I with a Hanger, which we did, be∣cause we knew our selves to be Friends to the Japan Emperor, therefore we ex∣pect to be releas'd from our Imprisonment, being kept without any cause? And who would accuse true Friends for Spies, because by order of a Letter of Agreement, we sought for our Admiral Castrecom on the North-Coast of Japan which was in our way to Tartary; and had we known that our Cruising there would have been so ill taken, we would rather have chosen to have perish'd with hunger in the Ocean, than incurr'd the Japan Emperors Displeasure. Moreover, We have declar'd several times, that we were Hollanders, but we cannot help it that it is deny'd, or that being not experienc'd in the Language, we could not make them understand it. None of the Prisoners have ever set foot on Japan before this time; but I have been twice in Firando, from whence about three years ago I carry'd Mr. Francis Caron to Batavia; and I spoke with Elserak and Overtwater, a little before my coming from Batavia: I also knew Kockebakker, who at this time lives and is Marry'd in Holland: Concerning Ca∣ron's return to India, I know no certainty. Sicungodonne requires and obligation from the Hol∣landers.At last, Sicungodonne ask'd them, If they were willing to Sign an Obligation, in which they should be bound to be ready at all times upon the Emperors Command, to appear before the Councel; and if ever they were found guilty of bringing over Portugal Priests into Japan, then the Obligation to be forfeited: And for performance of this, not onely they then present should be Bound, but also the Netherland Governor in Nangesaque, with all the Goods belonging to the East-India Company, on the Island Disma with them; Captain Schaep and the other Prisoners embrac'd this proffer freely, being all very well assur'd, that
they never had any thoughts to bring over Romish Priests in their Vessels Bres∣kens and Castrecom: For, said they, being sworn Enemies to all their Profession, should we venture our Lives and Fortunes, to accommodate those we always hated? And therefore they doubted not but the Governor at Nangesaque would without any scruple embrace this Proffer, there being not the least danger in it. After this proffer, and their acceptance of it, Sicungodonne rose up, going some Paces from the Hollanders, setting himself down at the end of the Galle∣ry, where he drew a Draught of the foremention'd Obligation; whilst the Letters that were written the tenth of September, by Elserak and Overtwater, from Nangesaque,Dutch Letter translated into the Japan Tongue. were deliver'd to Schaep and Byleveld, that they might be interpre∣ted into the Japan Tongue, and given to the Council; about which they had great trouble, to make Tosaymon understand the Contents of the Letter, the In∣terpreter having but little knowledge of the Dutch Tongue; so that he spent most of the time in asking to whom the said Letter did belong; for the Japan Council doubted, that the Prisoners belong'd to the Netherland East-India Com∣pany: Wherefore Tosaymon,Examination concerning. Elseraks Letter. by Sicugodonne's Order, strictly examin'd them to whom the Letter was written; whereupon he was answer'd, To Captain Schaep the Merchant, and the other Prisoners: But, said Tosaymon, Have Else∣rak and Overtwater given you no advice in their Letter, how you should carry your self, and what you should answer before the Council. On which they replied, That the Letter contain'd nothing but their sorrow for our Imprison∣ment, which they had heard from the Governor of Nangesaque; the Arrival of five Netherland Ships in the Rode before Disma; their hopes of making good Advantage that Year; an admonishment of being at peace and quiet amongst our selves; and a strict charge of carrying our selves with great re∣spect to the Japan Council. Sicungodonne shews him∣self courteous to the Hol∣landers.These Contents were translated by Tosaymon, who instantly gave it to Sicun∣godonne, and he deliver'd the Obligation to Tosaymon, that he might translate the same into the Low-Dutch, so that they might sign and return it to him again. Sicungodonne also sent one of his Secretaries to Schaep and Byleveld, who told them, That to morrow he would carry the Obligation to the Council, and intercede to them for their Discharge, though he could not certainly pro∣mise that their Liberty would be granted instantly: For which kind Proffer, the Hollanders thank'd him, and Sicungodonne in whose Name he was sent. Then Schaep and Byleveld went with the Interpreters Tosaymon and Manykebe to their Inn. Stubbornness of the In∣terpreters.These did not any way repeat, or as much as speak of what had pass'd all that day; which was partly out of high-mindedness, and partly out of ex∣ceeding Pride, of which both were guilty: Onely snapping at them, said, If you did not mistake in speaking before the Council and Sicungodonne, you had long before this time been releas'd. Yet notwithstanding their sharp Lan∣guage, they gave them not the least Counsel to mend their Faults; so that Schaep and Byleveld were ignorant where the Mistake was: And though they besought earnestly, that Tosaymon and Manykebe would be pleas'd to tell them wherein they offended, yet they got no answer, both only giving them the hearing, sometimes scornfully denying their Request, and at other times, without giving any answer, they went out of the Chamber; which occasion'd great trouble to the Hollanders. But the Obligation written by Sicungodonne, being sign'd by Schaep and Byle∣veld,
and deliver'd to the Secretary Inowy Sycungono Cammysamma, was to this purpose: Henry Cornelison Schaep, and William ByleveldThe Obligation sign'd by the Hollanders. witness, with the Hol∣land Prisoners, That they fir'd some Guns from their Ship Breskens, accord∣ing to the Hollanders Customs, not knowing it to be forbidden to do any such thing on the Japan-Coast; wherefore they sue for Pardon for that Fault. They testifie moreover, That they Sail'd from Batavia to discover Tartary; and excuse themselves, that they are not guilty of ever having carried or brought Portuguese Priests into Japan: But if in any of these they shall be found false, and tax'd with Untruths, they shall on the Emperors Command come hither, from what part of the World soever they are in, that they may appear before the Japan Bench, and receive Sentence of Punishment, accord∣ing to their Deserts. Notwithstanding this Obligation, which was again deliver'd to Sicungodonne, yet they had not their Liberty granted them; but on the second day the two Interpreters, Kitsbyoye, Phatsyosaman, and the Apostate Priest Syovan, came to their Inn, asking if they had not a Map aboard of their Ship Breskens? If they had not fired in the Haven Namboe? Byleveld told them, That they had Charts of the Sea-Coasts of Java, Ternata, Tayovan, and Japan; but none of Tartary: And al∣so, That upon the entreaty of the Japan-Gentry, they had fired several times in the Haven of Namboe, and once before the Coast, for their lost Admiral Castre∣com.O false Hollanders! cried Kitsbyoye;The Dutch Interpreters interpret wrong for the Hollanders to the Council. How false and basely have your Words been interpreted? Tosaymon and Manykebe have interpreted to the Council, That your People never carried any Maps in your Ship; and that you never shot, either on the Japan Coast, or in the Haven Namboe: There∣fore the Japan Lords suspect the Business, and your Answers to be nothing but Lies.Schaep and Byleveld now well observ'd what the reason was that the Interpreters kept themselves at such a distance with them, and still snap∣ing at them, said, You relate Untruths before the Council: Therefore they humbly besought them, That Kytsbyoye, Phatsayosamon, and Syovan, which now under∣stood the Business, would take the trouble upon them, to intercede for them to the Lord Sicungodonne, for the Mistake which had been made by the Dutch In∣terpreters: Which Request they all three granted; and going from them, bid them be of good courage. Private dealings amongst the Interpreters.And indeed they seem'd to be much concern'd thereat; for on the next day they came again to the Hollanders Lodgings, where finding Manykebe, they told him, That he, and chiefly Tosaymon, had falsly interpreted for the Hollanders to the Council; and therefore it was high time that Manykebe his Brother were made acquainted therewith. But Manykebe laid all the fault on Tosaymon, at whose command, as being Chief Interpreter, he was forc'd to be silent. At last, the news thereof coming to Tosaymon's Ears, he neglected not to speak to the Hollanders concerning it; and excusing himself, said, That the fault was not in him, but Sicungodonne, he having faithfully translated Word for Word, which Sicungodonne sometimes told the Council quite contrary: Yet it appear'd sufficiently by Tosaymon's, Countenance, that he was not without fault; there∣fore Schaep desired him, That for the future he would have a better care, and observe the Questions and Answers, that the Japan Council might come to a right and true understanding of the whole Business, and free them from fur∣ther danger: Which he promising to perform, took his leave. Why the Hollanders are kept longer Prisoners.After this, the Interpreter Phatsyosamon brought them word, That the Em∣perors Mother was fallen exceeding sick; wherefore the Court would not hear
any Causes whatsoever, till such time as she was recover'd: Therefore they must have a little longer Patience, if they got not leave to go for Nangesaque so soon as they expected. See many Novelties.The next day Manykebe, Syovan, Kitsbyoye, Phatsyosamon, and their Landlord, brought a considerable number of Japanners into the Chamber where the ten Hollanders sat, which out of curiosity came to see them, holding a great Dis∣course amongst themselves, which the Hollanders (they speaking the Japan Tongue) could not understand; only they now and then heard them mention the Names Elserak and Overtwater: Manykebe at last interpreting to Schaep, said, That one of the Japanners there present was lately come thither from Nange∣saque, and at his departure from thence, spoke with Mr. Elserak and Overtwater, and several other of their Countreymen, which he left all in good health: But no other Account would Manykebe give him; for when Schaep ask'd him any thing concerning their Releasment, he refus'd to answer him, and scorn∣fully commanded him to be silent. The Youth Paw is exa∣min'd.Since this Visit, the Hollanders had many that came to see them; and the Youth Jacob de Paw was by their Landlords Son carried to Sicungodonne's Pa∣lace, under a pretence, that some Japan Ladies were desirous to see him: But returning at night, related, That he had seen no Ladies, but Sicungodonne's Se∣cretary, and the Dutch Interpreters Tosaymon and Manykebe, who examin'd him concerning their Shooting in Namboe, and how often they fired? and if the Japanners discharg'd any Pistols or Firelocks on board of the Ship? All which the Youth answer'd as the rest had done before. A Meeting of the Japan Council, before which the Hollanders appear.The nineteenth of October the four Interpreters had a Meeting in the Hol∣landers Inn, where the ten Dutch Prisoners were brought before them, and told by Tosaymon, That they should make themselves ready to morrow Morning, an Hour before Day-light, because a Meeting was agreed on by the Council at Sicungodonne's House to have another Hearing about their Business. They an∣swer'd, That they would gladly be ready; though in their Hearts they su∣spected Danger, because they were commanded to appear so soon, which they had never done before. But at the appointed time, going thither accompa∣nied with the four Interpreters, the Apostate Priest Syovan, their Landlord, and his Son, they staid above an Hour waiting in a Princely Hall, which look'd out into an exceeding pleasant Garden: But being carried out of this Hall to the usual Waiting place, they staid till Noon. Mean while Sicungodonne's Se∣cretary treated them with Pieces of Bread, and two Cups of Wine apiece; and being carried into the Place of Audience, they were commanded to sit down on Mats by four Jesuits,The Hollanders are plac'd next four Jesuits. who look'd exceeding pitifully; their Eyes and Cheeks strangely fallen in; their Hands black and blew; and their whole Bodies sadly misus'd and macerated by Torture. This Company amaz'd the Hollanders, who were not able to judge the Reason of their being plac'd by the four Jesuits. These, though they had Apostatiz'd from the Christian Faith, yet declar'd publickly to the Interpreters Kytsbyoye and Phatsyosamon, That they did not freely Apostatize; but the insufferable Torments which had been inflicted up∣on them, had forc'd them to it. The Council ask'd them at large concerning their Opinions, and the Power of God; on which one answer'd faintly, but the rest were much more resolute. The Hollanders fearing to give any occasion of suspicion in the Council, durst not seem to take notice of their Questions and Answers; yet because
they sat close by the Jesuits, and Kytsbyoye interpreted the Japan Questions into Portuguese, which some of the Hollanders understood, they heard, amongst others, these following. Questions put to the four Jesuits by the Council, and their Answer.O despairing Jesuits! What Confidence can you repose in your God, who hath so shamefully forsaken you? Is he the Creator and Governor or all Things? Why doth he not release you from your Troubles, by which your Bodies seem rather to be Anatomies than Living Creatures? Cannot the Japan Emperor do with you whatever he pleases, without asking leave of the Christian God? One of the Jesuits answer'd; "It is apparent that God hath forsaken us in this World, as the Children thereof; yet he hath never forsa∣ken those that trust in him, because he helps us in our greatest Extremities, when a tortur'd Person is not sensible of his Pain, the Soul being rapt with Heavenly Contemplations; and considers, that these Temporal Torments last no longer than Life. The third Jesuit said; God visits us, for our ma∣nifold Sins, with great and several Afflictions; yet the Soul remains un∣touch'd by any Executioner. When the Soul leaves the Body, she goes to Purgatory, where (though not without great pain) she is long cleansed and purified, till she is fit to go to a Heavenly Elizium, there to enjoy all Happi∣ness. God therefore forsakes not his Children, because he brings them to Everlasting Life, notwithstanding the way thither is very troublesom. It is true, that these poor and miserable Bodies are in the Emperor's Power, which he would not have, were it not granted him from God: Also all Humane Authority ceases over Man, when the Soul is departed out of the Body. The last Jesuit concluded the propos'd Questions after this manner; Without the True God, is no Salvation; and without his Will and Permit∣tance, nothing either good or bad can be done. The Japan Council not well experienc'd in the Romish Religion, wanted Questions to ask them, and therefore call'd for Syovan the Apostate Priest, who was there ready for that purpose. So soon as he saw the Jesuits, he look'd very
fiercely upon them, notwithstanding he had formerly been one of their Or∣der, and in a scoffing manner laid,Syovan despises the Je∣suits very shrewdly.Now fie upon you Jesuits, that make this World in an Uproar. How you vapor of your God and Salvation? Are none sav'd but Jesuits, or those that embrace your Opinion? In what con∣sists your Interest in Heaven? Is it because you privately dissemble with, and defraud all Princes; and gathering, hoard up the Worlds Treasure? Had you remain'd still in your usual Pleasures, the Japan Prisons had not har∣bor'd such a crue of Antichrists; nay, Japan had never shed so much Blood: for thousands, by your Delusions, were taken from their Worship of the ancient Gods Amida, Xaca, and Canon, and embrac'd the Christian Religion, for which they suffer'd the cruellest Deaths. Was it under a pretence to win Souls? Why did you then carry so many Tun of Gold yearly out of Japan? And why did you plot to bring Japan under the Subjection of the Spanish Tyrant, and so to order all things according to your pleasure? But now, what is the Power of the Christian God? Look upon your miserable Bodies; can he not help you? Where then is he Omnipotent? Will he not help you? Where is his Mercy? O foolish thought of Salvation! You are distracted, to continue thus in your stubborn humor, imagining to receive great Re∣wards from God, and great Esteem of your Successors, in suffering wilfully your Bodies to be thus tormented. I ask once again, Why doth not your God help you? Certainly your Life is not in his Hands, but in the Empe∣rors of Japan, who when he pleaseth can punish and torture you more than ever he hath done yet. This the Hollanders understood very well, because Syovan spoke with a loud Voice; and they also were us'd to his Stile, by reason of their conversation with him in their Inn.To the great satisfaction of the Council. But whilst Syovan rail'd thus at the Jesuits, he seem'd exceedingly to please two of the Japan Council, Sackay Sammoccysame, and Mat∣sodairo Ysossamma, with his Discourse, and chiefly when he spoke of Amida and Xaca. ¶ IT is worthy our Observation, that not only the Japanners, but also all other Heathens, nay, such Pagans that acknowledg'd one God, yet gave not Divine Honor to the very true God: For understanding by the Light of Nature, that there must upon necessity be a God, that Created Heaven and Earth, and requir'd to be Worshipp'd, they ascrib'd the Godhead to the Crea∣ture; not unlike the blind Man,John 9. v. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. of which St. John the Evangelist makes men∣tion; for he, when he saw the Son of God, of whom he had receiv'd sight, ask'd him, who was Gods Son? because him whom he saw, he knew not who he was.Ignorance of the Anci∣ents concerning God, and especially the Japanners. So in like manner all the Heathens look to this day on the Invisible God, openly in his Visible Works: They hear him calling with a loud, yet silent Voice, I am the Creator of the World, the Preserver and Governor, to whom all Di∣vine Worship belongs: But they shut their Eyes from seeing, and stop their Ears from hearing, no otherwise than if they dream'd; and following their own Imaginations, put the Visible Creature in the place of the Invisible Creator. And so the Japanners acknowledge a God; and yet Amida, Xaca, Canon, and other Idols (whose Beginning and Original they deny not) they give Divine Wor∣ship and Honor to. But this Error is very ancient: The Apostle Paul saith thus of the Heathens; Professing themselves to be wise,Rom. 1. v. 22, 23, 24, 25. they became sools: And chang'd the Glory of the uncor∣ruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed
Beasts, and Creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own Bodies between themselves: Who chang'd the Truth of God into a Lie, and worshipp'd and serv'd the Creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever, Amen. Gods Truth is chang'd into Lies, when Divine Worship is shewn to any thing but to the real God: For it is a Truth, That there is a God; and to say that the Creature is God, is a Lie. Alexander ab Hales saith thus concerning it; To keep Gods Truth,Alex. ab Hales, p. Sum∣mae. q 30. de Adorat. a. . is to serve God; to change his Truth into Lies, is to serve the Creature in stead of the Creator: For the right Worship consists in the Service of the onely true God: Therefore if the Idolaters serve the Creature in stead of the Creator, they change the Truth into Lies. The Reasons of Idolatry.It seems that Man, because he saw not God, therefore most wickedly made that God which he saw: For since it is just and right, to give to every thing its due; yet the Heathens have given that Worship to the poor Creature, which belong'd only to God: so not only bereaving God of his Honor, but also ascribing this Honor to that which never was, nor ever can be God. What the Learned Hea∣thens thought of God.Those which were somewhat wiser than the Vulgar, had not such foolish thoughts of God as the Common People; yet they suffer'd themselves to be carried away by the general Example, judging it to be sufficient to think of a God, whether it was the right or no, that govern'd Mankind. The one seem'd not to be concern'd to seek after God by the Light of Na∣ture, because they pursu'd their Pleasures, and made their Bellies their Gods; as the famous Roman and Greek Gluttons, which search'd both Sea and Land, to find Dainties for their never-satisfied Appetites. Other Heathens were too busie in purchasing Honor, or else too covetous; and others were too poor to lose time from begging for their Living:Why they sought ∣ter God. So that they found so much to do on Earth, that they never studied for Heavenly Enjoyments. Few were earnest to seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him,Acts 15.2 though he be not far from every one of us: In the interim, they became vain in their imaginations,Rom. 1.21, 2 and their foolish heart was darkned: Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools; onely observing the Vanities of the Heathen Religion, neither caring nor desiring to know which way to turn. However, this Truth is very evident, That God inlightned the Pagans with some Beams, Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them,Rom. 1.19, 20. for God hath shewed it unto them; (as the Apostle speaks) For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead. The Truth stirr'd them not up to the working for Salvation. The Creation of the World manifested sufficiently Gods Good∣ness,From ignorance of God proceeds Wickedness. Wisdom, and Power; and requir'd therefore, that Men should be at his service, as well for his exceeding Greatness, as Goodness, and certain assu∣rance of everlasting Salvation, which was prepar'd for all those that fear'd God: But the World would rather idly and scornfully, without earnest Ob∣servation, look upon the Works of God, and give no Honor to the Creator; nay say, That no God created it: Therefore they thus forsaking God, he forsook them, and according to his Judgement gave them over to Wickedness, of which the Chiefest and Learnedst Heathens were no way clear. The chiefest of the Learn∣ed Heathens very wicked.How highly do the Greeks esteem the sweet-flowing Xenophon? What a great deal of Judgment lies hid in the famous Tabble of Tebes? And who hath so famous a Name, for Constancy, Temperance, Patience, and Learning, as Socrates? Plato is so admir'd, that Greece ascrib'd the Name of Divine to him.
But all these Plutarch accused,De Educat. that they were inclin'd to the foul sin of Sodomy, and using Catamites:De Vita Contemplat. And Philo the Jew chides Plato, Socrates, and Xenophon ex∣ceedingly for that very thing. The Prince of the Latine Poets, Virgil, seems to take pride in the like Acts, in his second Eclogue. Catullus, and that brave Orator Cicero, stand also accus'd thereof; so that though formerly the Learnedst Heathens, if by an easie light of Nature they have exceeded the Common People in a little knowledge of God, yet they have at once deny'd God by their foolish Works.Japanners are given to the sin of Sodomy. And at present the Japanners, though otherwise they are exceeding wise, account Sodomy, and unnatural Communication with Mankind, no sin; which is no wonder, because they know not the true God, nor worship him; so that they are given over to their own inventions,Rom. 1.27. Men with Men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in them∣selves that recompence of their error which was meet. The true Worship is a Duty from Mankind to God; but Idolatry is com∣mitted so often as a Man adores with Zeal (which is onely due to God) that which is not God. The Spiritual Workings are three sorts.These kind of religious Instigations are observ'd to be three, being either outward, or outward and inward joyn'd together, or onely outward. The inward workings embrace above all the Love of God, Fear of God, Trust in God. The mixt workings are all religious Worships, which remain inward, because they proceed from the Heart; and outward, because utter'd with the Mouth. The Praying with the Heart and Mouth consists in Thanksgiving for received Benefits, and partly intreating for continuance of old Mercies, and for the obtaining of new. The outward Zeal appears by the Behavior in religious Matters; to which belongs the building of Temples and Altars, kil∣ling of Sacrifice, keeping Feast-days; or else by the actions of the Body, either bending down their Bodies forward, or lying flat on the Earth, bowing their Heads, folding and kissing their Hands: which Ceremony is perform'd to express they acknowledge God as the Donor of all good things, and Redeemer from all bad. Common Civility.But it is quite otherwise in the respect and honor that is shewn from Man to Man;Genes. 33.3. for so Jacob bowed himself seven times to the ground till he came near to his Brother Esau:Chap. 23.7. and Abraham also stood up and bowed himself to the people of the Land, even to the children of Heth. But this honor may be chang'd into a religious Worship, as may appear by Nebuchadnezzars Image. Japan Idols what they are.And so it is with the Japan Idols, who formerly were Kings, or other noble Persons, that either kept their Countrey from Invasion of Enemies, or for their several Victories and other Atchievements, prudent Government, or else for the inventing of some noble Art by which they reap'd much profit, in their Life-times were highly honor'd, and after their Decease, and in process of time were worshipp'd as gods. Amongst which number are Toranga, a Huntsman in Corea, who slew eight Japan Tyrants, and therefore is represented with as many Arms and Hands Arm'd with Clubs, Swords, Dagger, Scymiter, Pole-Ax, Bowe, Pike and Gauntlet. And also Xaca, who was the first that taught the Japanners the Pythagorean Doctrine concerning the transmigration of the Soul: The Place of his Birth is said to be in India. Likewise Han and Deva, both Kings of Tanguth, were for their prudent and
wise Government in their Life-times, after their Decease religiously worship∣ped by their People. So is also Canon, Amida's Son, with thirty Arms and Hands, in each two Arrows. In like manner their new Idol Xantai in the City Anzuquiama, erected by the Japan Emperor Nobunanga, that he might be worshipp'd in that Image. Something belonging to the Japan Religion is strange.Concerning these Japan Idols something is very remarkable, namely, That the Japanners ascribe a beginning to Amida, Xaca, Canon, Xantai, Toranga, and other Devils; whereas the true God is without beginning; so that upon neces∣sity they must acknowledge an ever-being God; but they worship him not, and are so ignorant of his everlasting Essence, that they have not a word where∣by properly to express God. The same Joseph de Acosta ascribes to the Inhabitants of Peru, a part of the West-Indies, who (if the Learned John de Laet may be credited) are Extracted from Tartary, bordering on the North of America. Moreover, the Chineses acknowledge their original to be from the Tartars, and the Japanners from the Chineses: All of them have their own Names for their several Idols; but they cannot properly name the true and ever-being God.Peruans and Japanners cannot name God. The Persians, saith Acosta, believe in a Supream God, by them call'd Viraco∣cha, and also Pachacamac and Pachaiahacu, that is, Creator of Heaven and Earth. They gave him also the Title of Usapu, signifying Wonderful; but yet they can∣not find a word whereby they may properly express, as many other People, the Name of him whom they serve in chief; so that whereas the English call him GOD; the Hebrews, EL; the Greeks, ΘΕΟΣ the Latines, DEUS; the Peruan Tongue will not bear any of the words. Wherefore the Spaniards be∣ing sent to Peru to Preach the Gospel then, taught them them the Spanish word Dios, signifying God, which they use now every where. The same Peruans serve the Creator in the stately Temple Pachumac; yet make Offerings to other petty gods. The Japanners also know of an everlasting Being; but, as we said, want a Name, and worshipp'd him not: whereas on the contrary, thousands of Tem∣ples are erected in Japan for their Deities Amida, Xaca, Canon, Toranga, and others; nay, there is scarce any Countrey on the Earth able to stand in Competition with Japan for Temples. Jesuits Answer to Sio∣van's Reply.¶ TO return again to our Relation, when Siovan had reply'd to the four Jesuits sitting by the Hollanders, he ask'd them also, Why doth not your God help you? How comes your Life in the Hands of the Emperor of Japan, if it be at the dispose of your God? To these blasphemous Discourses the wisest of the Jesuits said, Notwith∣standing these words come from Siovan, yet they ought to be reproved; and I tell you, that we believe, that without Gods permission none can hurt one Hair of our Heads, neither is there Salvation for the immortal Soul without God; and to forsake him, either for worldly ends, or cruel torments, must upon necessity be a great sin: mean while God denies not mercy to those, that in the last hour beg it, if they are penitent, and depend on their Saviour Jesus Christ. It seem'd as if the Jesuit would have said more, but that the Councellors Sackay Sammoccysamma, and Matsodairo Ysosamma gave a sign that the four Jesuits should be led from thence, and the Hollanders put in their place, opposite
to the two Councellors, when Sammoccysamma began to speak with a stern Countenance in these words: Examination of the Dutch Prisoners by a Japan Coun∣cellor.You Schaep and Byleveld acknowledg'd your selves to be Commanders, and chief of the Ketch Breskens, how then comes it that the Ketch is gone to Sea out of the Haven of Namboe without Officers? Do the Hollanders keep such small Command over those that are under them? Their Answer.Byleveld answer'd, That the Pilot in the Captain and Merchants absence, according to their Custom, bore the chief Command in the Ship, which the other Seamen ought to obey. But the Pilot must give an account concerning his Command, therefore they knew not how he could answer it before the Indian Council at Batavia: for he, notwithstanding their earnest entreaties by Writing, desiring him not to weigh Anchor from Namboe, yet on the con∣trary set Sail, without staying for his Captain and the Merchant. The Rea∣sons that mov'd him thereto may be better guess'd than poke for truth. Per∣haps he was fearful of further danger, seeing us thus violently carry'd away; by which he might judge, that the Hollanders were not priviledg'd to come on the North of Japan, though the Emperor gave them leave to Trade to Nange∣saque. Moreover, none in the Ship to our knowledge was ever in Japan to know it; wherefore the Pilot might think, that we could sooner get from Jedo to our Countreymen at Nangesaque, than to the Ship in the Haven of Namboe. Father Examination and Answer concerning the State of Portugal.Samoccysamma reply'd, This present Emperor did not onely grant free leave of Trade to the Hollanders; but also his Father and Grandfather were no less Courteous to them: But how comes it, that after a long War with Portu∣gal, sworn Enemies to the Japan Empire, you have made Peace with them? which dealing the Japan Emperor cannot but suspect and dislike. The King of Spain's Power related to the Japan Councel.Byleveld answer'd, That the Spanish King, had upon the Decease of a Por∣tuguese King, made himself Master of that Countrey by force of Arms, and en∣joying it a long time in Peace and Quiet, seem'd by his growing Power to bring an unavoidable trouble on Europe: In Italy he possess'd the Kingdom of Naples, and Sicily over against it: he was serv'd by the mighty Dukedoms of Millan, Burgundie, and a part of the Netherlands; all Spain belong'd to his Crown, besides many vast Countreys in Africa, and the East and West-Indies, and chiefly the great Provinces of Peru, Chili, Chica, Mexico, and other Places in America. This great Potentate (whose Dominions the Sun views over all the Earth where-ever it Rises or Sets) Holland, with the help of some others, hath engag'd and maintain'd a no less bloody than stout War against this seventy years together, both by Water and by Land, and so behav'd themselves, that to the admiration of all People, they have won from this so powerful Prince in all Parts of the Earth; several Fortresses, Cities and Countreys, being taken from him, and many great Fleets spoil'd at Sea. The Portuguese, who unwillingly bore his Yoke, look'd after their antient Freedom, that so they might be Govern'd by a Native King; so getting courage by the Spaniards downfall, and the more, because he depended on the Hollanders assistance, which they proffer'd freely in that weighty Concern, not out of love to the Portuguese, but by that means to disable the King of Spain; so that Holland, though they sent Aid to the Portuguese, yet they bore an irreconcileable hatred to them; wherefore there was no Peace concluded, but onely a Cessation for some years. Moreover, the East-India Company are under the subjection of the States and the Prince of Orange, who sending advice thereof to Batavia, made us forbear our Quarrel. Mean while the Japan Emperor, whose Favors are
esteem'd most highly by the Hollanders, shall find them to be true and Loyal Friends. Japan Councellors make enquiry after the difference of Religion between the Portuguese and Hollanders.But Sammoccysamma went on in his Examination; The Portuguese Priests (said he) teach, That they can help themselves and others by Prayers and Offerings to I know not what, not onely in this Life, but also in the other: Do you Hollanders also believe that you can reap any benefit by that means? Most mighty Lord (replied Schaep) how should we be so foolish to expect good from those that prosecute our Souls and Bodies: for indeed very great is the difference between the Portuguese and Dutch Clergy, which in the time of the Popish Priests were murder'd by thousands: and at present, since they can∣not destroy us by violence, they condemn us to everlasting damnation, ac∣counting us Vagabonds, that must for ever burn in unquenchable Fire; so that if they could save us, they would not: But how can they? Why do they not help themselves? Ought they not to use that Art, and rid themselves from so many tortures? We believe that the Emperor of Japan can give us free leave that we may go for Nangesaque. Which Discourse of Schaep caused all the Japan Lords to laugh. But during this Examination, a Secretary sat next to Sicungodonne, who took an exact ac∣count of, and set down all the Questions and Answers that pass'd between the Councel and the Netherlanders. Description of a Japan Inkhorn.They write in this manner: The Inkhorn is like a long Box, out of the Top of which appears the Mouth of a long Flask, cover'd with a Wax Lid to keep it from breaking: the Box is divided into three Partitions, one is the Place in which the Writing-Pencils lie inclos'd, of which the top is made fast with Pins; at the bottom of the Box, in which the Flask stands, is a place wherein they preserve their Cakes of Ink, which are sometimes red, but generally black, and cost much Money, because they use them but little. These Cakes must be mark'd with the Emperor's Arms; and try'd by his Officers; and if they are
found to be good, they set certain Letters upon them, without which mark upon pain of death they may not be put to Sale or us'd. Japanners are great Ar∣tists in Writing.Hereby it plainly appears, that the Japanners have great skill in the noble Art of Writing, which like a Master domineers over Death, because it not onely shews on Paper the Transactions of Man, and communicates to us the Knowledge of others in the Mysteries of God and Nature, but also preserves things against the wearing of Time to all Posterity, therefore the antient Greek Philosopher Anaxagoras judg'd, that Man was the wisest and strongest of all Creatures, because he had Hands which would write things that Death could not blemish; for Learned Books last many Ages, and by that means in∣structed their Successors. Japan Pencils, after what manner they are made.But the Japan Pencils are made of Copper or Silver, and at one end eight square, and flat on the top, on which every ones Arms are Engraven for to Seal their Letters withal; under the Seal is a round hollow Joynt, full of black or red Powder, according to the colour of their Ink; about the middle Images are Engraven, which serve for Ornament, and below appears the Pencil, with which they Write in this manner: The foremention'd Box hath a round Case on one side for the Pencil, and on the other side a long square place, wherein are four Indentings; at the end thereof are eight Copper or Sil∣ver Pins; in the four holes they pour their Water for to make their Ink with, which they make either black or red, according as they please, and dipping the Pencil first into the Water, they rub it on the Seal'd Cakes of Ink. How they Write.They Write quite after another manner than the Europeans; for the Japan∣ners take not the Pencil with which they Write between their three Fingers, but in their whole Hand, so that the upper end thereof appears between the Thumb and Fore-finger, and the middle part they grasp in the Palm of their Hand, and after that manner they make exceeding good Letters, and Write very fast with their Pencil: their Paper not unlike the European, is somewhat browner, but smoother, and the one side which is not written, represents Silver Checker-work on a blue Ground. Several ways of Writing.Here also is to be observed their four several ways of placing their Letters: The first and oldest hath always been us'd, as also to this time by the Hebrews, Chaldeans, Syrians, Arabians, and Egyptians, Writing from their right Hand to∣wards their left; whereas on the contrary, the Latines, Greeks, Cels, and other Europeans Write from their left to their right. The antient Greeks had another way of Writing, as may be seen by the famous Laws of the wise Solon, which was, where the first Line ended the second began directly and upright, and where the second ended there began the third, and so accordingly the rest, not unlike Roads in Countreys, which take a beginning where others end, and of∣tentimes are cut through one another.Genial Dies. l. 2. c. 36. Lastly, the Chineses, a great part of the Indians, and all the Japanners, begin on the right-side, and so Write from the top downwards. Alexander ab Alexandro relates, That the antient Moors in like manner in for∣mer Ages, placed their Letters one amongst another; and also the Mexicans according to Acosta. Great care hath been ta∣ken at all times to promote the Art of Writing.Moreover the Antients have much tir'd themselves in this Art, every one in∣venting a new way: first all publick Acts were Engraven on Plates of Lead; but peculiar Accidents of single Persons noted on Linnen. Egypt was the first that afforded Paper, made of Plants pasted together. In Rome also were us'd a long time Tablets cover'd with Wax, of which two, three, or five were
sow'd together, being either of a Saffron, or Egg-colour, Green, or Purple on three doubles they writ Letters; on five doubles, Titles and Offices of Ho∣nour; and on the double ones, peculiar Secrets. The Grecians sometimes us'd the Bark of a Lint-tree in stead of Paper. Attalus fitted Goat-skins to Write on in the City Pergamum from whence to this day all over Europe it is call'd Pergamenum, or Parchment. The Brachmans, antient Philosophers amongst the Indians, made use of fine Linnen, on which they drew black Letters. Inventers of Characters, and chiefly Chineses and Ja∣panners.Moreover Cadmus brought the Grecian Characters from Phaenicia to Greece; Radamanthus furnish'd the Assyrians; Memnon and Anubis, the Egyptians; Hercules, the Phrygians; Carmenta, the Latines; every one with several Letters or Chara∣cters. But the Japanners Extracted from China, Write antienter Characters than any other Countrey. The Chinese Chronicles make mention of Fohi, who was the first King of China, and Reign'd about three hundred years after Noah's Flood, that he inven∣ted Letters, which he made of Serpents, Snakes, and the like, strangely tangl'd and wound up together: wherefore his Book of Astronomy is by the Chineses call'd Fohi Xi-lum-zu, that is, Fohi's Book of Serpents.Strange Characters us'd by the antient Chineses and Japanners. After that several Kings in China found divers strange Marks for Writing: Xum-num invented the Pictures of Husbandry; Xan Hoan, of Birds; Chuem Kim, of Oysters and Worms; another, of Herbs and Plants; Choan Ham, of Birds Feet; Yao, of Tortoises. Besides these kind of writing Marks, the antient Chineses and Japanners us'd in their Writing several Marks of Peacocks, Herbs, or Quills, and several other Fancies, invented by the Emperor Co, or from the Stars or Planets, and also Fishes. Besides these, also there are other peculiar Characters, of which some are us'd onely in writing of Law-business, others in Letters and Super∣scriptions. They have also particular Characters to express Peace, Joy, Darkness, Clearness, and Disputations, and resemble not in the least the other Japan Marks for Writing. Original of the Chinese and Japan Characters.The Learned cannot agree when they enquire after the original of this Art: for some acknowledge the Assyrians for the first inventers; but most ascribe the honor to the Egyptians: But if the Chineses and Japanners us'd Marks for Writing three thousand six hundred eighty nine years ago, according to the Book of Serpents of their first King Fohi, then they knew it before the Assyrians and Egyptians; yet it cannot be deny'd, though the Chineses and Egyptians express their meanings by the placing of Beasts and Plants, without making any Letters, that there is a great difference, because the Egyptians not onely in their common Conversation, but us'd the same Marks in their religious Matters: therefore none might learn them but those that were commanded, and had leave from their Governors. And also the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks signifi'd not onely the thing it represented, but also the hidden property, and sole operation of the written Matter; whereas on the contrary, the Chinese and Japanners Writing express and describe the Transactions of Men, and other natural things, and shew plainly the whole Matter without any farther Mysteries. Strange Language call'd Quanhoa, why invented.Moreover, the Chineses have a general Language call'd Quonhoa, which the have made themselves: for China being divided into great and mighty King∣doms, whereof the Governors, or Mandarins, must give a yearly account to the Emperor at his Court at Pechin, or Nanchin; and every Chinese Territory having their peculiar Language, which is different from their Neighbors, therefore they found out that Language call'd Quanhoa; which is not onely us'd amongst
the Courtiers, but also in all manner of Contracts, and is spoke by most, but chiefly by the best bred Chineses, by reason this Language hath very short Sen∣tences: for though it contains many Letters, yet it hath scarce three hundred twenty six Words which begin all with one Letter, and end with one of the Vowels, a, e, i, o, u, or m, x, n; from whence it proceeds, that one word often hath more than twenty several significations, and according to the soft or loud pronunciation of it, signifies either this or that. Five several People can understand it when they Read it, but not when they Speak it.The chiefest thing to be admir'd in this Mandarine Tongue, is, that when Written it is understood by all, the Chineses, Japanners, Coreans, Tonchinensers, and those of Couchinchina, but they cannot speak it; for then the one Countrey can∣not in the least understand another. It is with the Mandarine Tongue as with our ordinary Ciphering, which signifies all one thing quite over Europe, and when pronounced, is not understood, but by their own several Nations, because they all give several denominations to their Figures. Japan Tongue very loftyLastly, concerning the Janpan Tongue, the same sounds no less lofty than brave, and expresses sufficiently the high ambition of the Speaker, being full of Vowels and Consonants;Some words thereof. for a small Example these may serve; Mos Resoucq gusarr, Give a Candle; Curi gusavimass, Come here; Sass Massio, I drink to you; Itum takka Massio, Much good may it do you; Icoramors, How much for that? Doukye Gousarri mass, Whether will you go? Mis cosmis, Eat Rice; Souw Meore∣mas, Drink Water; Gekyo, donne or samma, Lord and Master; Nanto Moss, What say you, Friend? Mada sutta, Stay a little; Imo gusarrimas, I come presently; Emingosamma, A Gentlewoman; Bobbo, A Womans Hymen Ring; Ksou, Vine∣gar; Warrangusar, Bad; Surry warrangusar, This is bad; Kataskanongusarrimas, I humbly thank you; Katania, A Custom; Konatta samma gattinnakka, Your Lord understands it wrong; Konatta samma gattinde gusarr, Your Lord under∣stands it right; Wataxix gattinde gusarr, I understand it; Wataxix gattinnakka, I understand it not; Arygattinnakka, He understands it not; Phnyx ikomassio, To come Aboard and Sail; Meditongusarimas, I humbly wish you a good day. Farther Examination of the Hollanders by the Ja∣pan Councellors.¶ TO return again to our Examination. After Schaep had answer'd to Sammoccysamma's Question, If the Hollanders believ'd that they could be Sav'd by the Portuguese Priests? He said, That the Priests ought to use their Art to deliver themselves from such insufferable torments as they en∣dur'd; which made all the Japan Lords to laugh. In this Hall for Audience lay a new Japan Drum, on which the Councellor Matsodairo Ysosamma commanded the Youth Jacob de Paw, which was also Exa∣min'd, to Beat on it; who being not altogether ignorant in that Art, first beat a March, and then an Alarm, with which he seem'd exceedingly to please the Lords: and presently after they rose up all together, and went out, and the Hollanders got leave to go to their Inn. Description of a Japan Lady.On their Way home they met with some Ladies of Honor, attended by a great Train of Servants; of which some carry'd wax'd Devices, others Hand∣kerchiefs, and variety of Sweet-meats in Dishes; on the sides went their Waiting-maids with Fans; at some distance follow'd two of their Maids of Honor, every one holding a crooked Stick, between which hung a Silk Ca∣nopy, to be carry'd over their Ladies Heads. These Women, when they walk abroad, are very richly Clothed, their Hair curiously adorn'd with long Ribbons ty'd together, hanging down their Necks; by their left Temple appears a Golden Bodkin, at the end of which hangs a
costly Diamond; their Ears on both sides above the Hair garnish'd with Pearls; about their middle they wear a broad Girdle, Embroider'd with Ima∣gery; a Japan Coat hanging loosly over their under-Garments, made of thin Silk, and according to every ones Degree or Quality, so that some have five, six, ten, twenty, nay, a hundred Coats one over another. Whilst these Persons of Honor engag'd the Hollanders eyes on their Way homewards, Schaep and Byleveld had some Discourse with the Interpreters Tosai∣mon and Manikebe concerning what had pass'd in Sicungodonne's Palace. The Hollanders asking, Why they were placed next the four Japan Priests, which was never done before, and also for what reasons the Councellors Sammoccysamma and Ysosamma went away so suddenly? Whereupon Tosaimon told them, That Sam∣moccysamma had been incensed against them, and told, When he saw the Hollan∣ders, he must judge by their presence, that they were guilty of bringing over Japan Priests; and chiefly when they should be placed next the four Portuguese Prisoners. Which Answer occasion'd no small joy in the Hollanders, who were in all haste to make ready and go to the Emperors Palace before the chief Court, the appointed hour of their Audience being at hand. Two Jesuits recall their Apostacy.Afterwards the Hollanders heard from the Servant of the House, That two of the four Roman Priests had recanted their denying of the Christian Faith to em∣brace the Japan Religion: wherefore Siovan, who was ready to go for Nangesaque, receiv'd a Command to stay in Jedo till farther Order, his Presence being re∣quir'd when the two other Priests should be carry'd to their torture. The four Interpreters are puzled to translate two Letters.Isaiemon, one of the Gentlemen th came with the Hollanders from Namboe to Jedo, ask'd them for the List of their Men in the Ketch Breskens; which they giving him, he immediately got it Translated into the Japan Tongue by Mani∣kebe. The four and twentieth of November, the Interpreters Tosaimon, Manikebe, Kitsbioye, and Phatsiosaimon, were exceedingly puzled, the foremention'd Coun∣cellors giving them two Letters all of one Content, but the one written in Low-Dutch, and the other in Portuguese, by the Governor of Batavia, to Sabrosai∣mondonne,
at Nangesaque. The Letters came from Batavia the four and twentieth of April, Anno 1643. of which Samoccysamma was desirous to know the Contents, and if they differ'd one from the other, The Interpreters having spent a consi∣derable time in Studying to Translate them, but could not, it was thought con∣venient to command the Hollanders to assist them in it. None were more puz∣zel'd than the Interpreters, Tosaymon and Manikebe, because of their little know∣ledge in that Tongue, and yet would be accounted good Interpreters. The Hollanders being better able to Correspond with the Portugal Interpreters, Kyts∣byoye and Phatsayosaymon, who both understood Portuguese very well; so that at last they read them over so often, that they found both the Letters to agree, and be all of one Content, and Translated them into the Japan Tongue. Hollanders receive tidings.The next day after Manikebe visited the Hollanders in their Inn, and amongst other Discourse he related, That the day before he had been with Sicungodonne and other Japan Lords, of whom he understood, that they should stay in Jedo till Elseracks coming thither. Wherefore they desir'd him, because the Nights began to grow cold to speak to their Landlord, that he would let the ten Pri∣soners have six Blankets Quilted with Cotton; which Manikebe took upon him to do, and spoke to their Host, who not onely promis'd them the Blankets, but all other necessaries that they requir'd. Moreover, Manikebe told them from Sicungodonne, That they should not be melancholly nor troubled, but be chearful and merry, for Mr. Elserak would shortly set forth on his Journey thither. Phatsyosamon told them also, That he had receiv'd tidings from Nangesaque, wherein he had advice of the Arrival of a Holland Ship, Laden with Skins, Pepper, and Speckel'd Wood; and also that a Dutch Flie-Boat accidental∣ly took Fire, yet the Flame being suddenly quench'd, sustain'd but little damage. Soon after, the Apostate Priest Syovan went for Nangesaque, and came to take his leave of the Hollanders, who would willingly have given him a Letter which they had made ready some days before, to deliver to Elserak; but Syovan excusing himself told them, That he had receiv'd Orders from Sicungodonne, Commanding him, not to carry any Letters for the Hollanders: Therefore they desir'd him, since he durst not carry their Letter, that if he should meet Master Elserak any where by the way, to relate the whole circumstance of their condi∣tion to him by word of mouth; which Syovan promis'd, according to their re∣quest, to perform. On the first of October, the Interpreters, Kytsbyoye, Phatsyosamon, and Ma∣nikebe came again to the Hollanders, and brought them advice of a Holland Ship, that engaging with the Quinammers, was burnt; and also that Sicungodonne per∣mitted the Hollanders to cut and shave their Hair, which till that time was for∣bidden them. Hollanders are frightned by the Emperor.¶ AFter some days, Tosaymon brought the Hollanders sad News, so that they did not long enjoy themselves, for the loss of their over-grown Hair. The Japan Emperor not being fully satisfi'd, (notwithstanding the great Testi∣monies and circumstantial Inferences which the Hollanders made concerning the carrying of Priests) about the concluded Peace with Portugal; and that during the time they were at Wars with the Portugals, they had never Sail'd about the North of Japan. The Emperor also took it for no small offence, that the Hollan∣ders should Steer to the rich Golden Islands, lying South-East from Japan, a great
distance off at Sea, but yet under the Jurisdiction of the Japan Emperor. This Design was not mention'd when you were brought Prisoners in Jedo, therefore the Emperor, to have a true account of the whole Business, hath or∣der'd you to be kept close Prisoners till Elserak comes thither, that then your innocency in carrying over Portugal Priests, and your Design of discovering the rich Golden Islands, may plainly appear. Byleveld ask'd Tosaymon in what degree, and whereabouts these Islands might lie, because none of the Hollanders knew the Japanners rich Gold Islands? The rich Japan Golden-Islands, where they lye.Tosaymon told them, That they lay sixty Leagues at Sea from the Promonto∣ry of Jedo; by which Schaep and Byleveld judg'd it to be the same Coast where they lost the Ship Castrecom, on May the 19. in the Night, namely, about fifty six Leagues East-South-East from Jedo. Description of a Japan Gentleman.Whilst they sat pondering on this News, Schaep and Byleveld were call'd by their Landlord into a stately Chamber, where they found the Interpreters, Kitsbyoye and Phatsyosaymon with a Lord, holding a Paper written full of Japan Characters, and a square Wax'd Chest, fitting in great State on a Carpet, in an Embroyder'd Coat Lin'd through with Ermins, and bare headed, his Hair being ty'd behind on the top of his Head; the Coat open before was Clasp'd about the middle of his Breast with a Golden Hook; between the opening of his upper Garment appear'd a Flower'd Suit, of which the Breeches hung quite over his Knees, almost to his Feet; in his left hand a Fann, the top thereof adorn'd with a Gilded-Rose; on each end his Servants were pulling out the Carpet, that the Fringe thereof might hang even over a square Seat; in which manner, most of the Noble-men sit at their Doors, whither they are brought through their Houses on the Carpet; but when they go forth, they are carry'd in Sedans. Strange Treaty of a Ja∣pan Nobleman with the Netherlanders.But this Lord open'd at last his Wax'd Chest, out of which he took, first a Dutch Can and a Rommer, then a red Strip'd Serge, a Glas'd Chinese Pot, a Piece of Sail-Cloth, and Ternatish Tobacco, a remnant of white Damask, a string
of French Beads, Red and Yellow mix'd together; all these he shew'd Piece by Piece to the Hollanders, and also to Tosaymon and Manykebe, who observing them all, ask'd the Hollanders: His Examination, and their Answer.Do you Schaep and Byleveld know these Goods which are shown you? Were they exchang'd by Ketch Breskens for Fish, Herbage, or other Provi∣sions? Schaep answer'd, I look upon the Goods to be Netherland Wares, of which we have some in our Ship, except the Chinese Pot, Beads, and Serge. In the In∣terim, I have not the least knowledge, that ever any belonging to the Ship Breskens exchang'd these Goods: But to be certain thereof, it will be necessary if his Lordship please, that the other eight Prisoners may also be examin'd concerning it; thereupon the aforesaid Goods were likewise shewn to them, whose answer agreed with that of Schaep and Byleveld, but they desir'd Tosaymon to ask his Lordship, where, and at what time this exchange was made for the said Goods with the Japanners. Whereupon the Lord answer'd, This exchange was made the five and twen∣tieth of August, and on the same day, when the Hollanders were brought Pri∣soners in Jedo, on the East Coast of Japan, without being able to say how far it was Northward, out of a Ship about thirty Fathom long, and twenty five Foot broad, with sixteen Guns between Decks, three in the Gun-Room, and four small Pieces on the Quarter-Deck; on which also sat a Parret, made fast with a small Chain, and a Smith at work: Most of the Sea-men wearing Silk Clothes and Gold-Rings, which exchang'd the shewn Goods with the Japanners. But whilst the Fishermen went a Shore to inform their Governors, according as the Custom is of the strange Vessel, which they had discover'd at Sea; the Ship Steering on its Course, was seen no more; from which Description the Hollanders concluded, that the Flie-Boat Castrecom was not lost, which till that time they believ'd, for they doubted not, but that it was Castrecom, with which the Japanners had Barter'd their Fish. Moreover, this Lord caus'd them to be ask'd these Questions, How long and broad are the Ships Castrecom and Breskens? How many Guns do they carry a∣piece? What Boats do they Towe after them? What Guns are in their Boats? Description of the Ships Castrecom and Breskens.Schaep answer'd, According as we guess, Castrecom is nine and twenty Fathom long, and four and a half broad; when it Sail'd from Batavia, they carry'd fifteen Guns, amongst which is reckon'd a small Gun for the Boats use. But at Ternate, Castrecom took four Iron Guns out of Breskens, so increasing their number. Castrecom also had no other Boats than a Pinnace and Long-Boat that could carry four small Guns: Breskens was about a hundred and eight Foot long, and five Fathom broad. Their Boat carry'd as many Guns as Castrecom, but we took our Guns out of the Boat into the Ship, so soon as we had sight of Japan. Remarkable Questions  Japan Gentleman.Tosaymon receiving Order to examine them further, ask'd, What Yards or Masts did Breskens loose in the Storm? Had you no Instruments to Play on, and also a Parret and a Smith in the Ship? How many Youths and Officers in Silk Clothes and Gold-Rings had you Aboard? Doth not Breskens Tow a Boat and Pinnace after her? Or are they hoysted into the Ship? The Hollanders Answer.Byleveld answering first, went towards the Wall of the Room, against which hung a Picture, representing several Portuguese Vessels, and pointing at them, shew'd, that they had lost all their Top-Masts in the Storm, and a small Boat
was by one Sea wash'd off from the Deck. They had one Violin, and a Flage∣let on Board, but no Smith, onely the Gunners Mate serv'd them for Armorer. The two Parrets which they brought from Ternate to present to some person or other in Tartary, dy'd before they got sight of Japan; if the other two in Castrecom be living we, know not. Breskens also carry'd four Boys, but they knew none that wore Silk Clothes and Gold-Rings, but onely three of the Officers whose Silk Apparel was lock'd in their Chests. But in Castrecom, the Commander, Pilot, Merchant, Purser, and Chyrurgeon wear Silk Clothes and Gold-Rings; and they have a Flagelet, Bag-Pipe, Cittern, and Violin. Lastly, Our Boats are hoysted in, and ty'd upon the Deck, when ever we Sail into the main Oce∣an, but drawing near the Shore, we Tow both Boat and Pinnace. Why the Japanners place one Letter under the other.The propos'd Questions the Lord read out of the Written Paper, but set down between every one of them (a Blank-Line being lest) the Hollanders An∣swer, with exceeding quickness, every Character signifying a whole Word, the number of their Words and Letters being equal, and amount, according to Athanasius Kircher, to eighty thousand: And this is likewise the reason, why the Chineses and Japanners place one Letter under another, because every one of them signifies a whole Sentence. This manner of Writing confirms the foremention'd Opinion of the Americans Original, and their coming through Cattay from Tartary, over the Straights of Anian, (if such a passage be found out of the Icy-Sea into the Southern Ocean, for the Mexicans shew no uncertain Testimonies of their Extract from Tartary, which the Chineses also acknowledge, and the Japanners in like manner, that they came from China. But the Mexicans write likewise with their whole Hand, and have Characters that signifie a whole Word, placing one directly under the other, and where they want Letters, they fill up the place with Strokes or other Scrauls. Hist. Moral. of the West-Ind. 5, 7.Joseph Acosta relates, That in the Mexican Territory Jucatan, Bound Paper-Books are highly esteem'd by the Indians, for they Treated on the Dividing of Time, the Course of the Stars, Description of Beasts, Herbs, Medicines, the Antiquity of the Mexicans, of War, Peace, and Politick Government, Written down in Characters and Strokes after the Japan and Chinese manner. Acosta com∣plains not, without great reason, that a Spanish Divine finding one of these Books, and looking upon the strange Characters to be for Conjuration, caus'd it to be burnt; and for the same reason the Spaniards where ever they Conquer'd and could get any of the Mexicans Writings, burnt them, which indeed deserv'd rather to have been choicely preserv'd. Strange way of Writing and Cyphering without Let∣ters or Figures.But though Mexico drive a great Trade and keep all their accounts in those Characters, yet their Neighbors the Peruvians knew not the Art of Writing, and understood neither Characters nor any other Strokes resembling Letters; but us'd divers colour'd Strings with Bedes, which serv'd them as well as Books. These Strings they call'd Quipos, and those authoriz'd to keep the Quipo's, Quipo Camayo, whose service is like the Book-Keepers or Clerks in Europe; for these Qui∣po Caymayo's must give an account of all things, as concerning Marriages, Obli∣gations, Accounts, and Contracts, and what else happens between Man and Man; in Demanding or Suing for Debts, they deliver their Quipo's to a Judge which makes a testimony, as if a Debt-Book should be brought before a Magi∣strate in Europe. It is no less to be admir'd, that the Peruvians without being able to Write, exceed all Arithmeticians in expert certainty; their Cyphering they perform with little Beads, laying here three, yonder eight, then raking
one away, lay it upon another, and so exchanging two or three after the same manner, by which they know exactly how to bring the most difficultest account to a right adjusting. ¶ BUt to return again to our Holland Prisoners, who when the Lord that had read their Questions, and writ down their Answers was gone, they ask'd the Netherland Interpreters, In what Degree of Latitude and Longitude the Territory of Matsymay lay, before which the said foremention'd Ship was seen, but they told them they knew not. The Hollanders were not a little suspi∣cious of this answer, and the more, because they understood of some of the House-Servants, upon promise to be silent, that some of the Men of the fore∣nam'd Vessel were taken and brought up Prisoners. The next day the Hollanders came again into the fair Chamber of their Land∣lords, and there found, besides the four Interpreters, the same Lord that the day before had read their Questions to them out of a Paper, and understood that he was call'd Bongyo; next to whom sate three other Japan Nobles, which they had not seen before, of which one look'd very stemly upon the Hollan∣ders, being a Man as they judg'd, about two and forty years old, tall, and with a great and flat Face, of an Oleaster Complexion, and an indented Nose, who the day before had been in the foremention'd Ship, and was come there to see if any of the ten Prisoners were like unto those which he had seen. New Examination by the foresaid Noblemen.And Bongyo ask'd the same Questions he had done before, putting one before the other, by that means, if he could, to Trappan the Hollanders in a lie. And lastly, added these new Questions to the former; Of what Stature and Age are the Commanders, Pilot, and Merchant in the Ship Castrecom? How many Sea∣men in the Ship Breskens wear short Hair? How many Men did Castrecom and Breskens carry when they Weigh'd Anchor from Batavia? Schaep answer'd these Questions thus: The Head-Commander is scarce one and forty, is a handsome tall Man, with brown Hair, and a neat Beard. The Pilot about twenty six years old, of a middle Stature. The Merchant three years younger than the Pilot, hath no Beard; as for those that wear short Hair, we cannot give any certain account; but as we guess, there were between fifteen and twenty in the Ketch Breskens. Moreover Castrecom and Breskens carry'd six∣ty Men apiece, when they set Sail from Batavia. These Answers being again written down by Bongyo, he role up to be gone, onely stay'd a little while discoursing with the other three Nobles, who look'd very sternly upon the Hollanders to their no small amazement; wherefore after Bongyo's departure, with the other Nobles, they enquir'd of Tosaymon and Ma∣nykebe, if they knew not in what degree the foresaid Ship was seen, and where the People were taken Prisoners? And also, if no new trouble by their being taken might happen to them? Tosaymon answer'd, That the Ship Sail'd with a small Gale along the North∣ern Shore of Japan, Southerly. The Boat which it Tow'd had Mast and Bolt-Sprit, and carry'd four Stone-Guns, and a small Boat was ty'd fast to her side: And said Tosaymon, How can any new trouble arise from hence? It must needs be for your delivery, when the Prisoners taken out of Castrecom, witness that you were sent to Tartary; for their Relation concerning the same, if they agree with yours, will affirm it to be truth. Why the four Jesuits are set at liberty by the Japan Emperor.After that, the Hollanders understood from Phatsyosaymon and their Landlords Sons, that the Emperor kept the four Jesuits in Prison, till Elseraks coming thi∣ther,
(two of these four were Italians, the third a Castilian, and the fourth a Portu∣gal) that by him they might be carry'd over to Batavia: So escaping with their Lives from a terrible Death, because they stagger'd in their Religion, and dis∣cover'd a Secret, at which the Japan Emperor seem'd to be highly concern'd; the Plot was, that let it cost what it would, Money or Blood, the Jesuits would a new undertake their ancient Design in Japan: It was absolutely concluded, yearly to send Roman Priests to Japan from the Manilla's, and in short time, two Native Japanners should be sent thither, and be receiv'd in the Jesuits Orders, by which means they promis'd great matters to themselves, because they not one∣ly understood the Japan Tongue exceeding well, but were of the same Nature and Disposition of their Countrey-men, and therefore might be more private from the common Persecution, being less suspected than Out-landish Priests. By this means they thought for time to come, to play their Game, and the more, because the Christians in all places, as if they arose out of the Ashes of the Martyrs, began to Live afresh: So that the Emperor was puzzel'd, seeing no small danger to threaten his Crown; wherefore, he contrary to all those that had been his Predecessors, was at the Examination of Christian Prisoners, or Portugal Priests himself, out of meer fear of an Insurrection. ¶ THe five and twentieth of October, the Gentleman Isycauwa Isajamondonne brought word, That Elserak on the ninth of that instant, was come to Osacca, and was to appear in five days at the Emperors Court, being com∣manded by the Emperor to come with all speed to Jedo, without staying to bring the usual Presents with him, but let them alone to come after. Isycauwa told them also for certain, that they should once more be examin'd concerning their Voyage, and then be set at liberty. The Hollanders remove their Lodgings, and why?The next day, Kytsbyoye, and Phatsyosamon told them by Manykebe, That the Hollanders were to remove from their Lodgings, to go to a House of their Land∣lord's Son, because that place was order'd for Elserak to lodge in, by the Lords Sicungodonne and Sabrosaymondonne, because the Emperor and Councel had com∣manded, that Elserak should first be examin'd alone concerning the Voyage to Tartary, that so they might discern if what he said agreed with what Schaep and Byleveld had so often testifi'd: Whereupon, the Hollanders were carry'd to their new Lodgings, being not a little frighted to fee their Lodging Room seem more like a Prison than otherwise; but soon after, the Master of the House and his Family bidding them welcome, and withal giving them some Wines, they were again comforted. Hither the two Interpreters came to them, proffering their Service to them, to give a Letter in private to the Ambassador Elserak; Schaep and Byleveld were a long time doubtful what to do in this Affair, whether or no they durst repose so much confidence in them. Lastly, They ventur'd to advise Elserak in a Let∣ter, that which they had suffer'd concerning their Voyage to Tartary, when be∣ing busie about finishing the same, Orders came from the Magistrates, that the Hollanders must instantly appear in the usual Court: But the Counsel not sit∣ting, they return'd home without being heard. Japanners Coats of Arms. The Emperors.On their way home they met with one of the Emperors Officers, with his Imperial Majesties Arms, made of Silver and Gold, hanging on his Breast by a String, each end Clasp'd; the Arms it self were six Silver Stars on a Yellow Field, in an Oval Compass, plac'd at an equal distance one from the other, the Edges about adorn'd with Spots of Gold; in the middle of the six Stars are the
four Marks of the Emperors Authority: Moreover, they found at the ends of several Streets, Poles sticking out, with exceeding long Pennons, with two Slits at the end, and being Yellow, turn on the Pole, which runs thorow six Copper Holes; the hinder part of this Pennon represents In a Square the Emperors Arms richly Embroyder'd: In the four corners stood the Marks of the four chief Councellors: There is scarce a City, Town, or Village in Japan, but they have their Arms and Seals belonging to them; of which I will pick out as a pat∣tern some of the chiefest Places. Of Osacca.¶ OSacca bears in a Square Field a Wild Bores-Head of Gold, above which stands the Emperors Arms, four Silver Blocks plac'd sloaping towards the four Corners of the Field, and distinguish'd by the Marks of the Emperors chief Governors of the Castle, City, and Haven of Osacca. The Seal of Miaco is eight Square,Miaco. hath in the middle a Half-Moon, on the left side the Japan Flower, call'd Toxanpinang, and on the right a Snails Shell, underneath stand three Stars, on the top of the Shell are the Dayro's Arms, and below it the Emperors. Quano,Quano. a known City, lying at the Bay of the Japan Sea, where the Ferry is to Mia, uses for a Seal three round Balls, and as many long Blocks, in a round Field, mix'd one among the other; about the Edges are the Marks of the Go∣vernor, two Deputies, and two of the Councel. Saccai hath a Scollop'd Flag,Saccai. the Ground of the Arms a dark Green, distin∣guish'd by Golden Flames, a White Space five Square made in the Flag, close to the Stick, represents a Semi-Circle, parted in the middle, the one half White, the other Black, surrounded by the Emperors Arms, but separated by three round O's, and the City Mark.
The use of Seals and Coat of Arms is very ancient.¶ IT seems, that Signets or Arms, whether in Flags for Ornaments, or on Stamps, or in Rings, to Seal Writings withal, are very ancient. Cicero relates in his Disputation against Cataline, That shewing Seal'd Letters to Lentulus, He ask'd him if he knew the Seal? Which Seals the Romans made of Wax, but the People in little Asia, of Chalk, which in the Island of Crete, now call'd Candy is very plentiful, from whence Chalk in several Languages bor∣rows its Denomination. But these kind of Seals are much older than the anci∣entest Romans, for Thamar receiv'd a Seal Ring from Judah,Gen. 38.18. as a Pledge of Pay∣ment for his enjoying her. Moses also saith thus of Joseph,Gen. 41.42. And Pharaoh took off his Ring from his Hand, and put it on Joseph's Hand, that as a Chancellor, he might with the Kings Seal, seal his Letters. Hesychius, and Isaac Tzetzes relate, That the oldest Lacedemonians us'd to Seal with pieces of Wood eaten by Worms, before the Art of Ingraving was in∣vented. Hollanders are again brought before the Japan Judgen.¶ THe Hollanders being brought back to their new Lodgings, had but lit∣tle rest, for the next day the Interpreters Tosaymon and Manykebe con∣ducted them to the place of Audience, without Jedo; before the inner Gate the Prisoners stood still, except Schaep and Byleveld, who being commanded to en∣ter, were amaz'd at the stateliness of an exceeding pleasant Garden, through which they were led: At the end thereof was the Entrance into a Princely Hall, wherein was a most artificial Gallery, where the Councellors sat in such splendid State, that no European Princes might compare to them. So soon as the Hollanders approach'd, they were commanded to kneel. Sicungodonne, as before, gave the Word, saying, You Captain and Merchant shall in this instant speak the Truth; for if Elserak's Relation, who is hourly expected here, doth not agree with yours, you shall no way escape the most cruel Tortures. Schaep reply'd, Nothing hath been said to our knowledge, but what is truth; and we will at present give you a further account concerning what your Ho∣nors please to demand of us. New Examinations of Sicungodonne.Whereupon Sicungodonne ask'd them the following Questions: Do you not know the Goods shewn you by the Gentleman Bongyo in your Inn, the eighth and ninth of this Month? Have you also not seen the Ship on the North of Japan, out of which those Goods were exchang'd? What did you think, that she stood to the East, when the Wind favor'd to go from the Northern Coast of Japan, to Jacatra. Lastly, he ask'd, If they could not guess to what place those Ships belong'd, which some days ago sail'd along the Coast of Sat∣sammoo? Byleveld's Answer.Byleveld answer'd: Concerning the Goods which were shewn to us, we have so much knowledge of them, that the like is aboard our Ship Breskens; but because we know not that an Exchange was made between the Seamen belonging to her, and the Japanners, therefore we believe that the Goods came out of Castrecom, which we judge to have been cast away in May, by a Storm which arose in the Night, before an unknown Land. The said Ship stood to the East, the easier to Weather the South-East Point of Japan, and so to shorten their Voyage; judging the Wind always to blow good in that Lati∣tude in the middle of September. But concerning the two Ships, they could not say any thing of them, for a certainty; but that perhaps they might be Castre∣com
and Breskens, both returning to Batavia, by reason of the Imprisonment of their Chief Commanders. More strange QuestionsTo the foremention'd Questions, Sicungodonne added the following: Can you, Captain and Merchant, give no Relation concerning the Forces, consist∣ing of Land and Seamen, which the Prince of Orange sent for Aid to the King of Portugal? Why they mutinied for want of Pay, and so occasion'd a Civil War? Have you no Advice concerning the Event thereof? Do the Hollanders not sell the Portuguese Commodities? What signifie those Crosses and several Strokes, with which the Wrappers of the Dutch Packs are mark'd? Are there no Ave-Maries nor Woodden Crosses found in the Dutch Ships? Byleveld's Answer.ByleVeld answer'd again: The Entertainment of the Dutch Forces in Portu∣gal, and their Transactions there, was not known in Batavia, when we came from thence; neither are the Portuguese so much at Peace with the Hollanders, as to sell one anothers Commodities. Moreover, the Crosses and Marks on the several Packs and Bales, signifie nothing else, than the Arms of the Hol∣land Towns in which the inclos'd Goods are to be had. Lastly, the Woodden Crosses and Ave-Maries belong to the Roman Church; and therefore they never carried them in their Ships. Byleveld had no sooner ended, but Sicungodonne ask'd again; Is (said he) your God the same as the Castilian and Portugal? What is his Name? Who did ever see him? Where hath he convers'd? Whereby do you believe your God to be the True God? Difference of Religion.¶ IT plainly appears by the Religion of the Japanners, that they embrace the Errors of the most foolish Heathens,Rom. 1.23. changing the Glory of the uncor∣ruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man. This foul Doctrine was embrac'd by the Anthropomorphites in Christendom, about the time of Arius and the Nicene Council. The first Teacher was Audius, deriv'd from Mesopotamia, a Man who liv'd a very lend Life, yet in short time got many on his side; and remaining a little while by the Church, at last forsook it, and rais'd a new Opinion, which much puzzl'd the Ancient Fa∣thers; and chiefly they were contradicted by Theophilus Bishop of Alexandria,Frb. Inst. Theol. 1.36. and Epiphanius at Salamina; but Epiphanius disputed so indifferently, that he gave no satisfaction to the Learned. And indeed, against this foolish and fleshly Opinion of God, the Learnedst Heathens have disputed.Lact. de Irac. c. 11. Lactantius relates of the ancient Philosopher Pytha∣goras, That he believ'd God to be a Spirit without a Body. Plato affirms, That God is the greatest Good, above all things in Nature; he himself being full of all Perfection,In Somis. Scip. wanting nothing. And Macrobius saith, Plato when he would speak of God, durst not say what he is; concluding, That he cannot be known of Man what he is: For God is call'd Suprema Ratio & Ens En∣tium, and is also the first Original of all things. Here is added the Relation of the great Orator Cicero,De Nat. Deor. in these Words: In his Book of the Laws, saith Plato, I can better say what God is not, than what he is: Do you ask me what or how God is? I will use Simonides for my Interpreter, of whom when the Tyrant Hiero ask'd the same Question, he desir'd one day to think upon it; and on that day asking him again, he requir'd two days; so still increasing the number of the days: Hiero wondering at it, ask'd why he did so? Because, said he, the longer I study, the more difficult I find it to resolve.
Seneca also writes thus to Lucilius,God is close by, he is in you: So say I, O Lucilius, a Holy Spirit is within us,Ad Luci. that takes an account of all our good and bad Actions: This Spirit according as it is treated by us, so it deals with us, but none is a good Man without God. The opinion of the learn∣edst Heathens concerning God.The Learnedst of Heathens acknowledg'd in God the greatest Perfection, which consisted in three things. To the first belong'd his Eternity, which can be measur'd by no Time, be∣ing a Life without End. So that the Heathens observ'd by the Light of Na∣ture, how it was with God, to see to that which he was not before, or not to see after that which he was once. Secondly, They ascrib'd to God a Freedom against all Power, because he hath an irresistible Power, which is as Mighty and Omnipotent as God him∣self. Disown God to be a sub∣stance.Lastly, They believ'd that his Godly Nature suffer'd no Connexion to or with himself; for where there is such a Connexion, there must needs be some∣thing equal, or alike, to connect: but in God is no want of any such connect∣ed Assimilation; for if there were, then the Cause of such Want must precede the Connexion, and consequently be before God: but God is the First Causer of all things. And on these grounds they could find, that God was not Sub∣stantial, and Frail; much less consisted of Soul and Body: Which if the Learn'd Anaxagoras, Master of the famous Socrates, had not understood, he would not have call'd God a Spirit, and said, That all things proceeded from the Power of an Everlasting Spirit. The contrary opinion of the Japanners.But the Japanners go not so high; notwithstanding the inexpressible Good∣ness of God, and their own Consciences, should lead them to an Everlasting Being; yet they ask foolishly for a visible God, that converses with Men on the Earth. Byleveld's Answer.¶ BUt to return to our Story: Byleveld gave Sicungodonne this Answer; The Castilians and Portuguese acknowledge a Trinity, as well as the Hollanders; but they represent him in the shape of an Old, a Young Man, and a Dove; which the Hollanders hold to be abominable: For they ac∣knowledge God to be an endless Spiritual Being, of whom none may or can make any Likeness, neither by Images, or Imaginations of the Heart. Moreover, God hath given himself divers Names in the Greek and Hebrew Tongues; but the Hollanders call him God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: And because he is an Incomprehensible Spirit, he can be seen by none; from whence it always proceeds, that a Man can no way see his own nor anothers Soul: Yet the Invisible God is Visible in the Works of his Creation, Pre∣servation, and Governing of all things. Also Gods Son took upon him the Nature of Man in a Woman, when he was born in Bethlehem, travell'd through Palestine, did great Miracles there, and at last not far from Jerusalem died a cursed Death on the Cross, to redeem and save those from everlasting Damnation that believ'd in him; all which is written down in two Books, the first written by the Prophets, in the Hebrew Tongue; the other by the Apostles, in the Greek. These Prophets and Apostles were great Saints, to whom God gave the Spirit of real Truth: And these Books were translated out of their Original Tongues, into Dutch, by Persons experienc'd both in Greek and Hebrew.
Sicungodonne ask'd further,Sicungodonne's other Questions. Do your Feasts agree with the Portuguese and Castilians? How are they call'd? Do the Hollanders keep Fast-days? Are they not taught by Priests and Ministers, as the Spaniards? What are those Priests? Have they a yearly Income out of the Countreys Revenue? Do they, med∣dle with any State-Affairs? Is the Prince of Orange under any Bodies Ju∣risdiction? or Governs he Holland alone? Captain Schaep answer'd,Schaep's Reply. The Hollanders, said he, keep the first Day of the Week, like the Spaniards, on which every one rests from their Labor, and goes to Church to hear Divine Service: Only on some extrordinary Occasion, Fast and Prayer-days are order'd to be kept, that the Inhabitants may humbly beg of God for his merciful Assistance. Besides, at such an ac∣cident they abstain not from Meat and Drink; but take it, and give Thanks to God for it. Distinction of Diet is never observ'd by them. Moreover, the Holland Teachers are call'd Ministers, which are Men that from their In∣fancy have been brought up to learn the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew Tongues, and in Publick Churches Preach to the People out of the foremention'd Books, which every one may peruse, that thereby it may appear if their Doctrine agree with them. They are paid but of the Countrey-Exchequer, Marry, and go Cloth'd like other Citizens; but concern themselves with no State-Affairs. Concerning the Prince of Orange, he carried an Army against the Spaniards, Besieging every Year his Cities and Fortresses, according to the Advice of the States General, assembled in the Hague, and sent thither from the Seven Provinces of the United Netherlands, of which Holland is the Chiefest. Sicungodonne proceeded;More Questions. If your God and the Spanish God be all one, wherein is the Difference of your Religion, and whose Opinion is the eldeft? Schaep reply'd,And Answers. The Hollanders depend on One God, and a Perfect Savi∣or; but the Portuguese and Castilians place Gods Vicegerent on Earth, and Saints and Saintesses, which assist the Savior in his chiefest Business of Sal∣vation, in praying for those that are dead. Moreover, the Hollanders Religion is older than the Portuguese or Castilians, because it agrees with the two Prophetick and Apostolick Books, without adding to, or diminishing from them: So that although the Portuguese brag, that their Religion was publickly embrac'd and taught in the Churches in Holland, before the Hol∣landers banish'd the same from thence; yet the Hollanders Opinion hath been before the Portuguese: For that Faith which is now embrac'd, was the first that Holland entertain'd; and although oppress'd by bloody Persecutions, yet flouris'd again at last. Lastly, Sicungodonne ask'd, Is Java a great Island? Who possesses it? What kind of Inhabitants are there? What Colour, and what, Names? Description of Java. Captain Schaep reply'd, This Island is divided into Great and Little Java: The biggest is separated by the Straights of Sunda from Sumatra, and spreads it self in length a hundred and fifty Leagues, but much less in breadth, yet broader in some places than in others. According to the Relation of the Inhabitants, a River flows in the middle of it, which turns Wood into Stone. The Mataram, an Enemy to the Hollanders, possesses the greatest part thereof to the East: The King of Bantam, oftentimes at Alliance with the East-India Company, Commands a vast Tract along the Straights of Sunda. Betwixt both of them lies Batavia, where the President and Chief Governor
of the Indian Trade keeps his Court for that Company residing in the United Netherlands. The Inhabitants of Java are barbarous, and not to be trusted▪ of strong and well-timber'd Bodies, broad and thick Cheeks, great Eye-lids, little Eyes, small Beards, black and short Hair, and of a yellow Comple∣xion. After this Answer, Schaep and Byleveld were commanded to depart; and be∣ing conducted out to their Countreymen the other Prisoners, who had with a longing desire staid to hear the Success, found with them four and thirty Ja∣panners, Prisoners; of which, some sat Hand-cufft,Strange Japan Prisoners▪ others had their Arms tied together under their Coats; and talking, seem'd as if they rail'd and complain'd against their hard usage. Soon after they were carried to the place of Audience, from whence the Hollanders were come. Schaep ask'd leave of Manykebe to go to his Lodging, but was forc'd to stay. Manykebe told them, That those Japan Prisoners, which were by two and two led to the place of Audience, had Christian Parents; wherefore they had a long time been kept in Prison, and miserably tortur'd; which appear'd sufficiently by their thin Cheeks, hollow Eyes, and deform'd Faces, seeming rather like Sceletons than living Men. News of Elserak's arri∣val.Whilst they staid here, Phatsayosamon's Servant brought News of the Am∣bassador Elserak, that on the Morrow against Noon he would come with his Retinue to Jedo. This was told to Sicungodonne by the Masters Son of the Dutch Inn: upon which News, the Japan Council rose. The next Morning, being the first of December, Schaep sent privately for the Interpreter Kytsbyoye, to whom he gave two Letters, inclos'd one within the other, containing their several Examinations before the Council, to deliver to Elserak, that he might take notice thereof, and govern himself accordingly. Comes to Jedo.About Noon Elserak came to Jedo, with whom neither the Holland Prisoners, nor the Dutch Interpreter Tosaymon and Manykebe, might speak, before they were once more Examin'd: Wherefore they were again commanded on the next day to come to Sicungodonne's House, where they staid at the usual place about an Hour. Here sat a white lean Man, between forty and fifty years old,A remarkable Japaner, and his Policy. in rich Apparel, with a square brown Beard, who look'd like a Dutch Minister; his Hands loaden with great Hand-cuffs, which being taken off, he was very busie with Sicungodonne's Servants, taking Pen, Ink, and Paper, and writ very fast, and sometimes broke forth in earnest Discourse, not without strange Mo∣tions of his Body. Manykebe told the Hollanders concerning this Man, That he had impeach'd above six hundred Christians that liv'd in Meaco; yet was kept in Fetters till they were all Examin'd. Schaep and Byleveld are strictly examin'd.Mean while, Sicungodonne's Secretary, bringing Pen, Ink, and Paper, sat down by Schaep and Byleveld, beginning thus: You Captain and Merchant, are strictly commanded to write down every thing concerning your Voy∣age, since you left Batavia, to the day you came into the Haven Namboe, where you were taken Prisoners. If heretofore any thing hath been forgot∣ten, you may yen delare it; for every thing being writ down, it will be compar'd with what Elserak and the Governor of Castrecom (who is com∣manded to come hither) shall say: So that if you err from the Truth, you Prisoners will not onely run the hazard of your Lives, but also the East-India Company will suffer a considerable Damage on the Island Disma. Schaep answer'd, They were very well contented to suffer all their Tor∣ments, if they could be any ways tax'd with Untruth: But since they had
always answer'd their propos'd Questions with candid Sincerity (which they were still ready to do) they fear'd not the least danger. Questions of the Japan Secretary.Whereupon the Chief Secretary proceeded to their Examination, asking them, At what time did the Ships Castrecom and Breskens set Sail from Ba∣tavia? Did any other Ships set Sail with them? When dropp'd you Anchor before Ternata? Did Castrecom and Breskens arrive there together? Did they both weigh Anchors together? Where, and when lost you Castrecom? Did Castrecom never appear since? What Countrey do you judge it to be where you lost Castrecom? Did you meet with no Land between this and Ternata? Whither did you Steer after you miss'd Castrecom? When did Breskens light on the Japan Coast? When entred the Ship the Haven of Namboe for Water? When went it away? When entred it the Harbor of Namboe the second time? Byleveld's Auswer to him.Byleveld reply'd, saying, The third of February, in this present Year, Ca∣strecom and Breskens left Batavia, steering their Course to Ternata, with inten∣tion to seek for Tartary. When we went to Sea, we had no Company but Castrecom, with which Ship we Anchor'd, after five and forty days Sail, un∣der the Castle Maleyen: The fourth of April we proceeded on in our Voy∣age, and kept continually close together till the nineteenth of May, when in the Night we were driven by stress of Weather on an unknown Coast, lying in about four and thirty Degrees, where we lost Castrecom: We cannot give any Relation what Coast it was, because we hapned to fall upon it in the Night, and had as much as ever we could do, to keep our Ship from running ashore; in which endeavor we had such good success, that in the Morning the Land was seven Leagues astern of us, so that we could not discern it perfectly. We discover'd no Land betwixt Ternata and the said Coast. Moreover, so soon as we mist Castrecom, we ran towards the North-East Point of Japan, to look for him, according to the Letter of Agreement made at Ternata. We came on the Japan Coast the nine and twentieth of May, where after twelve days we entred the Haven Namboe, but went away again the next day, so soon as ever the fresh Water which we came for was Shipp'd aboard, and stood directly East into the Offin, so to Weather the South-East Point of Japan, having as we judg'd Sail'd two hundred Leagues, when the violent South-winds, and as strong Storms from the North, so distress'd us, though we had sometimes sight of Japan, that we fell a whole Degree more Northerly than we expected. Lastly, after being toss'd to and again seven and forty days, we were necessitated to Anchor a second time in Namboe; yet not before we had leave from the Magistrates, who permit∣ted and gave us leave to furnish our selves with all manner of Refreshments and Necessaries; on which Promise going ashore, we were taken, and brought Prisoners to Jedo. More Questions.Then the Secretary went on thus: What Complexion, Stature, Age, and Names, have the Captain, Merchant, and Pilot of the Ship Castrecom? Hath none of them ever been in Japan? Doth Elserak know them? What Freight had Breskens to Trade withal in Tartary? Where, and at what time did you speak with Elserak concerning this Voyage? Doth he know any thing of the Breskens Lading? Schaep's Reply.Schaep answer'd, The Captain of Castrecom, whose Name is Martin de Uries, is of a middle Stature, brown Hair and Beard, aged one and forty years; the Pilot, Peter Williamson Knetchtyens, a short thick Man, is about six and
twenty years old; the Merchant, Abraham Pittavny, tall and slender, hath yel∣low Hair, but no Beard, and is three and twenty years of age, Moreover, de Uries had some years ago been in Japan, and also Knechtyens, who was then Quartermaster, and the other Mate; but Pittavyn had never seen Japan be∣fore: And without doubt Elserak knows Martin de Uries, because they Sail'd together from Tayovon to Batavia, where he also may have seen Pittavyn: But as to what concern'd Knetchtyens, they could give no farther account, but that as before, he had once been in Japan. Concerning Breskens Cargo, they could tell every Piece they had, because it most consisted in small Bales, either of European or Indian Commodities, with which the East-India Company would try what Goods the Tartars most desir'd: But the chief Lading was Cloth and Pepper. Moreover, we spoke with Elserak the day before our departure from Batavia; but whether he knows exactly our Ships Lading, we cannot tell; yet we believe that he hath spoken with the Indian Council. A Tartar in Castrecom.Lastly, The Secretary ask'd them concerning the Age, Stature, Name, and Office of the Tartar which Sail'd in Castrecom, and was to serve them in Tartary, in the promoting of the New Trade: On which he receiv'd this Answer. The Tartar, nam'd David Cason, aged one and twenty years, brown and thick, supplies the Place of Under-Factor. Obligation requir'd from the Hollanders.This done, the Secretary rose up, only asking them if they were willing to sign a Writing, by which they might give assurance, That Elserak, without a mistake, would certifie the exact time of Breskens and Castrecoms setting Sail for Ternata? Which proffer Schaep and Byleveld willingly accepted: But whilst the Secretary was busie writing the propos'd Note, Sabrosaymondonne, Deputy-Governor of Nangesaque, pass'd through the Hall where Schaep and Byleyeld sat, looking upon them with a smiling Countenance, for which they bow'd their Heads to the Ground. The Imprison'd Holland∣ers hear no news of Elserak.Mean while the Evening coming, the Hollanders obtain'd leave to go to their Lodging, where they staid three days, without hearing any News of Elserak, only that he had appear'd, with the Merchant Paul Cornelison Veer, before the Japan Council, and at Night return'd home very joyfully. Elserak and the impri∣son'd Hollanders appear to∣gether before Sicungodonne¶ THe fifth of December the ten imprison'd Hollanders were again carried to Sicungodonne's House, which the Captain and Merchant entred, but the rest staid at the Door, through which soon after pass'd the Ambassador Elserak, with all his Retinue, and asking, for Schaep and Byleveld, was answer'd by the Seamen, That they staid waiting in the next Room.Strange Transactions there Elserak conducted thither, yet saw them not, because he walk'd amongst some Japan Servants to the place of Audience, without standing still to look for them; where sitting down, there appear'd Sicungodonne and Sabrosaymondonne, with a considerable Train of Nobles. After some Courtly Ceremonies, Schaep and Byleveld were brought in; whereupon Sicungodonne, speaking to Elserak, ask'd if he knew those Men to be such Persons as they pretended? and likewise, If he would willingly be bound for them, that they were sent with the Ship Breskens to Tartary, and were no ways guilty of the bringing over Portuguese Priests to Ja∣pan, or any other bad Design against this Nation? Elserak answer'd, Honor'd Sicungodonne, I know the Captain and Merchant very well; this is Henry Cornelison Schaep, and he William Byleveld, who came from Batavia the third of February, not to carry over Priests, which are sworn Enemies to the Hollanders; but to seek a new place of Trade in the Tartarian
River Polysange, without any prejudice to the Empire of Japan: Which Truth to affirm, not only I, but all the East-India Companies Ships, which Annually Trade to Nangesaque, will freely be bound. Upon which proffer▪ Elserak was answer'd, That he should perform his Promise, by Sealing a Writing to morrow before the Emperor, or at least the Chief Councellor of State; which he willingly accepted. Elserak tells the Holland∣ers of their Discharge.Then Sicungodonne and Sabrosaymondonne conducted the Ambassador Elserak to the Portal, where the remaining Hollanders sat, to whom Elserak said, Men, you are redeem'd.Their great joy. It is not to be express'd what an alteration these Words caus'd in them, having from Hour to Hour, and after divers ways, strove as it were with Death, and been a long time doubtful betwixt Hope and Despair: For what could they expect of a barbarous Japanner, but a merciless Death? Not know∣ing but that the Interpreters might interpret false, either out of their own ill nature, or else their ignorance in the Dutch Tongue: And the more, because they knew the strictness of the Japan Magistrates, who pass the Sentence of Death for the least untruth. The Tears which flow'd from their Eyes, ex∣press'd sufficiently their exceeding Joy; and the sudden News, made them doubtful to credit it: Yet they bow'd their Heads to the Ground, after the Japan manner, and thank'd Sicungodonne and Sabrosaymondonne, for their kind In∣clination toward them during their Imprisonment. Must leave Elserak's Re∣tinue.But whilst the Dutch Prisoners were wish'd Joy by their Countreymen of their Liberty, Elserak was call'd back by Sicungodonne, and after some Discourse, return'd to his Retinue, being commanded, that the ten Prisoners should walk before in the Streets, and for some private Reasons, not go amongst his Atten∣dants. Schaep and Byleveld enter∣tain'd by Elserak.But Elserak invited Schaep and Byleveld to Supper with him; and coming to his Inn he receiv'd them with all Friendship. At the Table several Discourses pass'd, of what had hapned to them on their Voyage, and since they were ta∣ken Prisoners at Namboe. After Supper, Schaep and Byleveld return'd to their Companions in their new Lodging, whither they were remov'd to make room for Elserak and his Retinue; who on the next day invited his two Guests again, giving them Clothes and Bedding, which they had great need of in Winter. Receive order to stay in their Inn.And whilst they were thus busie, an Interpreter call'd Sioske came in, who commanded the Captain and Merchant to return to their Lodgings, and to keep in there, till Elserak had made his appearance at the Emperors Court: Which Order was sent from Sicungodonne and Sabrosaymondonne, so that they im∣mediately obey'd. In the Evening they heard that Elserak had been at Court, and was return'd home: But because Sioske told them, That after two Hours time they should again see Elserak; which Promise failing, and Elserak himself sending them no word concerning his Success at Court, they were in great fear that the Business had met with some new hinderance or other;Hollanders are again ve∣ry much troubled. which trouble increas'd, because they heard not any thing thereof all the next day, doing how it stood with their Releasment, or the Ambassador Elserak. A great Earthquake at Jedo.¶ THey were possess'd with these melancholy Thoughts, when on a sudden the Earth was shaken, the Timbers and Roofs of Houses tumbling down to the Ground, the Walls falling one towards another, and much harm in those places where the Motion was greatest. It is approv'd of by the most Learned Philosophers, and Experience hath
taught us, That the greatest Earthquakes happen in March and September, be∣cause those times produce the greatest Vapors; whereas in the Summer, the Earth being open'd by warmth, affords free passage for the Winds that lye in its Caverns. In the Winter time the Ground is lock'd, and the Warmth too weak to occasion great Shakings. Moreover there are reckon'd three sorts of Earthquakes. The greatest is a Gaping, which often swallows up Houses, Villages, whole Countreys, and Islands. The great Lakes and bottomless Waters in Japan, hide under them formerly famous Places and People, and thereby testifie enough how this Em∣pire is plagu'd by such Evils. For the second, the Learned reckon that which shakes the Earth, heaving it up and down, and shakes that which is on the top thereof, in such a manner, that all things tremble and fall down. The third and smallest is, when the Ground moves to and again, like a Boat on the Waves. Such a one was this that hapned at Jedo whilst the Hollanders were there. The fore-running Signs thereof.It hath also often before, as well as now, been observ'd, That a little be∣fore the Earthquake the Air was very calm, the Winds being lock'd in the Bosom of: the Earth: The Air is also colder than at other times it us'd to be in that Season of the year, which hinders the breaking forth of the Winds: There likewise appear'd a long thin Cloud in the Sky: The Sea rag'd ex∣ceedingly, notwithstanding there was no Wind stirring: All Pools and sand∣ing Waters stunk very much; and the Water it self tasted of Brimstone. This the Learned Gerard Vossius ascribes to the Fire which is under Ground, and lies hid in deep places, under Mountains, Islands, and Seas, by which the Earth also is shaken many Miles together; so that not only, Cities, Villages, Territories, but whole Countreys, are totter'd, and turn'd topsie-turvey by it. This Fire vomits out many sulphurous and burning Vapors, which Experi∣ence hath taught us, because the Earth often rending asunder in Earthquakes, sends forth hideous Flames. The Fountains also smell sulphury, because the Spirits ascending, mix themselves with the Water. By this Sign Phracides, Master to Pythagoras, the Lacedemonian, foretold of an approaching Earthquake, which he judg'd would be terrible,Plin. lib. 2. cap. 79. because the Wa∣ters tasted exceedingly of Brimstone. Hereto is added, That the Countreys in which Burning Mountains are found, are most subject to such Damages. Josephus Acosta relates the like of America; and our daily Experience of Campania, Sicily, and other Places, where∣in Mountains either vomit forth continual Smoke, or hideous Flames, confirms this Opinion. Burning Mountain in Ja∣pan.About eight Leagues from Meaco, near a great Lake, lies the Mountain Si∣urpurama, which sends forth horrible Smokes and Flames, that ascend into the Sky; and below, several Sulphurous Streams. Sicily is at the present less troubled with Earthquakes than formerly, because the Vent or Hale of Mount Aetna being burnt wider and wider, affords a freer Passage to the Vapors and the Fire. Before the burning of the Mountain Vesuvius, where Pliny died, a great Earthquake hapned. It is also obferv'd by the Japanners, That the Mountain Saperjama burns vehementest after an Earthquake.
¶ THe eighth of December the imprison'd Hollanders were inform'd by the Interpreter Phatsyosamon, That Elserak was that day to appear before the Japan Emperor, and his Council; and that then they should have their free Liberty: But no sooner was Phatsayosamon gone, but the Hollanders had or∣der to dress themselves.Hollanders appear in the Emperors Castle. Their Landlords Son conducted them along, with∣out telling them whither, or what they were going about: So passing from Street to Street through Jedo, they came at last to the Emperors Castle, which is surrounded with four Moats, over which they pass'd through ten stately Gates; and coming within next to an Arch, whereof the Floor was cover'd with Mats, they receiv'd order to stay, till they were call'd to appear before his Imperial Majesty. Soon after, they saw the two Interpreters, Tosaymon and Manikebe, coming thither; and also, amongst other Courtiers, a Gentleman call'd Pochycennemon∣donne, who shew'd them a great Wooden Portal, through which they should be carried to the Emperor Owysamma. Magnificence of it. And whilst they staid waiting at the foresaid Place, they saw with admira∣tion a great many Lords,Civility of the Courtiers. Secretaries, and other Nobles, which continually pass'd to and fro, shewing such Reverence one to the other, that they exceed∣ed the most Complimental People in that kind. At last Pochycennemondonne brought the Hollanders over a broad Court, pav'd with Free-stone, through the Portal which he had shewn them, before a rich gilded Gallery, where they were commanded, after the Japan manner, to kneel, with their Faces bow'd down to the Ground. Soon after they espied the chief Councellors of Japan, and the Ambassador Elserak, in the fore-mention'd Gal∣lery. Sicungodonne speaking in the Emperors behalf, said to Elserak; Not∣withstanding the ten Hollanders here present deserve to be punish'd, because they Cruised several days on the Japan Coast, as if they had some private Design; and also for Firing their Guns in the Haven of Namboe, to the great amazement of the good Inhabitants: Yet since they manifest their Inno∣cency, and since your Words agree with theirs, the Emperor sets them at li∣berty, and gives the Hollanders to you, upon Proviso, That you be bound for them,Hollanders are set at li∣berty by the Emperor but upon provisoes. if at any time certain Information be brought against them, That they design'd any thing against the Japan Empire. Which Elserak accepted, as also the Hollanders, who were commanded by Sicungodonne to promise, That they would be ready to come from Holland, to appear before the Magistrates of Japan, if they at any time should be accus'd, that they had any Design upon that Empire. Lastly, Sicungodonne said, Well, the Emperor Owisamma discharges you from your Imprisonment; Be at liberty. Exceeding joy of the Hol∣landers.They seem'd by this saying to be rais'd from death, and were amaz'd, part∣ly at their delivery from so long and dangerous an Imprisonment, and partly at the inexpressible Glory and Riches which they there beheld. No Age nor Countrey makes mention of any Royal State, which doth not come much short, if compar'd to the Splendor of the Japan Emperor. Alexander the Great, after he had subdu'd most part of Asia, and was become Master of the Persian Power, would have denied Humane Frailty, and was ambitious to be honor'd as a God. In the interim, sitting amongst his Guests, he was fill'd with Meat and Drink, and reverenc'd by them with bowing Heads, and smoaking Myrrh, when after Meals he withdrew behind his Hangings.
The Emperors THRONE des Keisers reichssthl.
How highly is Solomon's Ivory Throne and his Riches esteem'd? Of which the Holy Scripture saith thus:1 Reg. 10. v. 16, 7, 8, 19, 20, 21. And King Solomon made two hundred Targets of beaten Gold: six hundred Shekels of Gold went to one Target. And he made three hun∣dred Shields of beaten Gold, three Pound of Gold went to one Shield; and the King put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Moreover the King made a great Throne of Ivory, and overlaid it with the best Gold. The Throne had six Steps, and the top of the Throne was round behind: and there were Stays on either side on the place of the Seat, and two Lions stood beside the Stays. And twelve Lions stood thereon, on the one side and on the other, upon the six Steps: there was not the like made in any Kingdom. And all King Solomon's Drinking-Vessels were of Gold, and all the Vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure Gold, none were of Silver, it was nothing account∣ed of in the days of Solomon. But though Solomon's Riches and Splendor could not be parallell'd in those Times; yet were he now in being, he could not compare to the Japan Empe∣ror. It cannot be describ'd,Great Splendor of the Japan Emperor, when he gives Audience to Ambas∣sadors, or his Substitute Kings. in what a proud and haughty manner he gives Audience to Foreign Ambassadors, and his Substitute Kings, which come by turns from the Eastern and Western parts of Japan before his Throne. Along the inner Wall of the Court stand stately Watch-houses, built like Galleries. In the Front thereof hangs the Emperors Flag, under which stands a Pike-man, who keeps Sentinel. In the Gallery sit the Soldiers, who spend most of their time with a Game call'd Pifango, not much unlike our Draughts, which requires much Consideration and Care. They also smoke strong To∣bacco. Along the Walls, upon Wooden Hooks, lye their Muskets and Pikes. The lowermost Edge of the Roof is adorn'd with Golden Balls. Before the tenth inner Gate stand the Overseers of the Court, which receive the Presents of the Japan Kings and Foreign Ambassadors, brought thither on Horses and Wains: Their Servants open the Goods. At the Gate stand two of the Emperor's Deputy-Secretaries, which write down and take an account of every Piece of what shall be shewn to the Empe∣ror; which done, they are put into the Store-houses that joyn next the Gate, which are built secure against all Fire. On the corners of the Roofs lie Couch∣ant Dragons, all gilded, whose foremost Feet lye upon Golden Balls. Here is generally great crowding; some carrying the Presents in, others carrying them out, and others putting them in good order in the Store-houses. Through the said Portal appears the Rail, by which the Imperial Throne is separated from the open Court. One side of the Throne is guarded by Musketeers, and the other by Pike-men. Just before the Throne is a large and spacious Field, about which stand high Watch-Towers, built on the Out-wall of the third inner Court. Next the Towers are stately Gates, both sides thereof guarded with Watch-houses, built long-ways on square Pillars. More inwardly ap∣pear exceeding high Towers, which the thick Walls of the second inner Court bear, not without marvellouss Art and Charges. Before every Tower is a Watch-house, shut round about: The lower Edges of the Roof are adorn'd with Golden Balls. In this place the Chief of the Nobility keep Watch. On the sides you walk through the Gates of the second Inner-Court. The Emperor sits under a Pent-house of his Banquetting-Turret, from which a Way through a Door leads to the Throne, whose Supporters on both sides, and upper parts, are adorn'd with curious Imagery of massie Gold. Right before the Door, behind the Emperor, sit four Lords, which are nearest al∣lied to him in Blood: As many of the Chief Council stand on the right side
of the Throne; and on the left side, four Nobles of State: All of them drest in Princely Apparel, sit so low, that they can just look on the Ground of the Throne. Behind the Councellors, Nobles of State, and Lords allied in Blood, stand about three hundred of the other Nobility of Japan, which encompass the Throne like a Half-Moon. Costly Roof of the Japan Emperors.The Roof under which the Emperor sits, is cover'd with Plates of Gold: At each of the two Corners lies a great Dragon Couchant, of massie Gold. The Cieling represents all manner of Imagery, wrought in Gold, and in some places adorn'd with Precious Stones. This Covering rests on four thick Co∣lumns, no less beautiful than marvellous: The first is adorn'd with the Pi∣ctures of the Heavenly Luminaries; the second, with all manner of known Beasts which live on the Earth; on the third are wrought Fishes, and all other Creatures that reside in the Water; on the fourth, are inlaid Fiery Dragons and Serpents of Gold. How the Japan Kings honor the Emperor, like Slaves.Between the two outward Pillars come one half Year all the Kings that in∣habit the West part of Japan; and the other, those of the East, and one by one throw themselves down, with rich Presents, on the second Step upwards that leads to the Throne: For by three Steps you ascend to a square place, whose utmost Corners bear the two foremost Pillars. Right forward rise the Steps which ascend to the Throne, which being seven in number, are all cover'd with rich Tapestry. By the King that lyes with his Face flat on the Ground, are two of his Nobility, in the same posture, on the first Step; and behind them, the Kings Private Guard-Man lies, in the humblest posture that may be. No Japan King, how powerful soever he be, may bring into the Emperors Inner Court above three Servants. The Emperors Apparel▪The Emperor sits in a Suit embroider'd with Gold, with his Leggs cross∣ways under him: This Coat, which covers his Under-Garment, is clasp'd toge∣ther a little below his Chin, and the rest open before, so that the Lappets there∣of hang on each side of his Breeches. Between the gaping of it appears a broad Girdle, stifned with Gold, and beset with Pearls and Diamonds. On his Head he wears a little Golden Crown, which rises aloft with three spiring tops. Japan Government, how.¶ BY this Splendor and State may easily be judg'd the ground of the Japan Government, namely, To bring the Power of the Empire into one sole Monarchs Hands, of whom all Persons are in fear. Their Emperor never appears, but he is dreaded for his Power, and reve∣renc'd for his Magnificent Splendor, which so dazzles the Eyes of the Behold∣ers, that no Subject, nay Prince, or King, that doth not fear and tremble at his Authority; much less dare they offer to Plot or Rebel against him. And indeed, who would not be terrified, where the Sword being drawn, punishes the least Offence offer'd against the Supreme Power; and destroys not onely the Malefactor and his whole Family, but his Relations to the third Genera∣tion? Who would not be afraid of such a Commander, before whom the pow∣erfullest Kings in Japan fall down on the Earth? So that Japan is by his Strict∣ness and great Power kept in good Order; whereas otherwise these People are subtile, and stout enough to plot and undertake great Designs, and in their Performance to undergo the greatest Torments, and look upon the cruellest Deaths.
Joy wish'd to the releas'd Hollanders.¶ AFter the Imprison'd Hollanders were by Sicungodonne discharg'd in the Em∣perors Name, they receiv'd Order to go to the place where they wait∣ed first, being wish'd Joy for their happy deliverance by Poechennemondonne, be∣sides other Persons of Quality that attended the Court. Lastly, the Ambassa∣dor Elserak's Retinue came also to wish them Joy, and desir'd them all in his Name, and likewise the Merchant Paul Cornelison Veer, to go to the Dutch Inn, whilst he took leave of some of the Council, to wash away the Sorrows they had suffer'd during their Imprisonment in Jedo. Elserak's Journey from Jedo to Nangesaque.¶ THe four and twentieth of December, Elserak went with his releas'd Hollanders out of Jedo, and riding that day seven Leagues, lodg'd in Cawasacca: From thence he travell'd as followeth: From Cawasacca, through Cammagowa, Fundaga, Taska, where he din'd, Fovissauwa, Tamra, Banio, and Firaski, he came against the Evening to Oiso, being twelve Leagues Journey: Going from thence, he found a troublesom way through the Mountain Toukery; so that he travell'd scarce six Leagues, and lodg'd in Odauro, a stately City at the Foot of that Mountain. The next day he went as far again: For after having din'd in Faukeney, where on the hanging of the Mountain lies the pleasant Vil∣lage Faccone, he came late in the Evening through Jammakak and Scabary, to Missima: From Missima he travell'd to Nomatz; and from thence, through Farri Jussiwarri, over the River Fisicaw, to Cambaro, where he refresh'd himself; and viewing Ini and Okis, staid at Jesares, having travell'd thirteen Leagues that day. Then they view'd the famous City Surunga, the Town Miriko, the Villa∣ges Ocambe, Tovisjeda, and Simanda; and crossing over the River Oyengauwa, lodg'd in Kaneia. Elserak's Journey far∣ther.Next day the Ambassador Mr. Elserak travell'd along the Foot of the Mountain Comi, whose Top is crown'd with lofty Cedars, and saw in the way as he pass'd the Villages Nisaca and Kakingow, refresh'd himself at Foucorai, saw many Rarities at Mitske and Nagaisum, lost some time before he could be Fe∣ried over the River Terni, met with divers Woods and Forests between Terni and Tannama, where staying a Night, he went by Day-break to the Villages Mei∣sacca, Arei, Straski, and Itagawa; and dining in Arei, he afterwards view'd the beautiful City Josinda: Then leaving Astanamica on the left Hand, he travell'd through Goi, and staid that Night at Accosacci. On the first of January, Anno 1644. going on forwards, the first Village he came to was Fuitzawa, from whence he came to the great City Occosacki; so pas∣sing on through the Villages Siriomi and Narromi, to Mia. This City lying in a Bay of the South-Sea, is very Populous, and hath many stately Buildings. Op∣posite to it, lies Quano, where he rested, and afterwards went through the Vil∣lages Tonuda, Jokeitz, Owaka, Oiebakits, Zono, Isacuts, the City Cammiammy, and lodg'd, after having travell'd eleven Leagues, at Siceonosiro. Then he Posted thirteen Leagues further, and by the way saw the pleasant Village Sacca, Fer∣ried over at Jocatangauwa to Sintzamma, scituate on the Shore of the River; and having pass'd by the Foot of the Mountain Coetsekajamma, din'd at Minacutz; from whence travelling on, he pass'd another Ferry at Jacatungauwa, and so through the Village Itzibe, came and staid a Night in Cusatz, shaded in the middle of a pleasant Grove, through which he rode to the River Osacci, which brought him into the great Lake of Meaco, on whose Shore, in the middle of a Bay, lies Jesi, a considerable City; and about two Miles further, on a Pro∣montory,
Oets, border'd by the foremention'd Lake. In Oets he eat fresh Cod, whose taste agreed with those in England and Holland. Towards Evening Elserak enter'd the City Fissima, famous for the stately Palace in which the Emperor Taicosama kept his Court. Taking Shipping at Fissima, he left Meaco, and sail∣ing by Sonda, saw Achas on the right side, and Firaskatta on the left, and at last landed at Osacca, sixteen Leagues distant from Fissima: So that Elserak in twelve days time had travell'd a hundred and forty Leagues; for so far Jedo lies di∣stant from Osacca. The redeem'd Hollanders also spent twelve days in going a hundred thirty two Leagues, from Namboe to Jedo. But Elserak staid six days in Osacca. ¶ NOt far from this City (as generally through all Japan) were seen several Burying-places, or Tombs, on which the Japanners bestow great Cost and Charges, as indeed most People do in Europe: Wherefore the Heathens ac∣counted them barbarous that misus'd dead Corps: Of which the Greek and Latin Writers accuse the Lotophagi,The strange Dealings and Cruelty of some People, us'd to their dead Corps. which threw their Dead without Chests or Coffins, into the Sea; judging it to be all one, if they rotted in the Earth, or whether they were consum'd by Fire, or decay'd in the Water. The Sabeans cast their deceased Friends, nay their Kings dead Bodies, on the Dunghils. The Taxili, Iberi, and Brachmans gave departed Corps to the Crows and Ra∣vens to eat. This Custom also was observ'd by the Barchaei; but onely to Va∣liant Men, that were slain in the Wars: Those that died a natural Death, they burnt. The Parthians gave the Flesh of the Dead to Dogs, onely burning the Bones. The Hyrcanians in their Life-time bred up great Mastiffs, that when they died they might be eaten by them. The Essedons brought their de∣parted Friends Bodies out at their Doors, where calling their nearest Relations together, they cut the Corps asunder; so mixing and boyling it amongst Sheeps Flesh, they eat it, as a Solemn Funeral Feast. The Massagetes carbona∣do'd their Dead also, and eat them. The ancient Jeren accounted it Religious to feed upon the Flesh of their Deceas'd Friends, Parents, and Relations. The Dervices slew all their Men and Women before their Altars, when they came to seventy years of age. The Hyperboreans made Feasts for their dead Bodies, hanging Garlands about their Necks, at last throwing them from the Rocks into the Sea. On the Island Code, those that attain'd to sixty years were forc'd to drink Poyson, because their Provisions should not grow scarce. The Caspians, so soon as their Fathers and Mothers were seventy years old, lock'd them into a Chamber, or drove them to desolate and uninhabited Wil∣dernesses, that there they might die of Hunger. Remarkable Ceremonies us'd about the burning of Beasts.¶ BUt although these People wanted Humanity, acting such unnatural things with their Dead; yet others have bestow'd vast Charges on their Funerals; nay some have not stuck with prophaneness to erect Monu∣ments for their Beasts, of which Lacys was one, who with great Ceremony Entomb'd a Goose, that whilst it liv'd would not go from him. Alexander the Great made a sumptuous Feast at the Death of his Horse Bucephalus. The Emperor Angustus, and after him Adrianus and Commodus, built every one for their dead Horses a stately Marble Tomb. Cimon and Xantippus, famous Gene∣rals amongst the Greeks, Interr'd their Dogs with Funeral Ceremonies. And nothing was more usual and common amongst the Egyptians, than to take dead Cats, Crowes, and Cranes, and having Salted and Imbalm'd them, to wrap them in fine Linnen, and in a Coffen Interre them.
Japan toomes or burning places
Of Men.Yet far greater Cost was bestow'd on the Burying of Men. How famous is the Tomb which Artemisia erected for her deceas'd Husband Mausolus? The Stones thereof were all Marble; it contain'd in the Circumference four hun∣dred and eleven Foot, and five and twenty in Height, surrounded by twenty six curiously ingraven Pillars. The famous Architects, Scopas, Briar, Timothe∣us, and Leocares, had scarce finish'd every one their Parts, when Artemisia died, after having burnt the Bones of her Husband to Powder, and drank them up, and spent all her Revenues on the before-mention'd Structure. Who hath not heard of the famous Pyramids, which were the Burying-pla∣ces for the Kings of Egypt? of which three are yet remaining: The greatest is square, and runs up sloaping; yet on the top so broad, that there may stand fifty Men: The breadth from one corner to another, at the bottom, being three hundred twenty four Paces, and rising aloft with two hundred and fifty Steps, every Step five Foot high, and each Foot nine Inches long. At each of the four Corners is a low Descent, to which none can go but stooping. Pe∣ter Belloon relates, That he found this Pyramid, Anno 1548. built within after this manner: Creeping through a narrow Passage, with a Wax Candle in his Hand, he came into an empty Room, where turning on the left Hand, they found a spacious Place, to which a curious Gallery led the way: The Gallery was pav'd with great Free-stones, curiously polish'd, without Steps, so that he was forc'd to support himself by the Rails on both sides, after which man∣ner he ascended sixteen Paces; at the end of which appear'd a handsom square Chamber, in which stood a Chest of twelve Foot long, five high, and as ma∣ny broad, without a Cover, hewn out of one entire piece of black Marble, wherein the Egyptian King lay Interr'd that built this Pyramid: Besides these, he found several other Apartments, and also a Well fill'd with Stones. Moreover, the Athenians made so much ado about the Burying of their Dead, that they condemn'd ten Commanders, because they neglected to do that Office to two departed Soldiers. The Hebrews neglected not to bury their Enemies. The famous Roman Orator Paulus accounts it Death for those that dig up dead Bodies out of the Ground. Alexander the Great kept so magnificent a Funeral in Babylon for Hephestion, that the Charges amounted to six hundred Tun of Gold. Furthermore, the Ancients bestow'd great Sums of Money on Pillars, Ima∣ges, Coffins, Imbalmings, and other strange Ornaments, with which they adorn'd the Burying-places, every one according to his Capacity. This anci∣ent Custom is yet observ'd amongst the Japanners,Japanners burn their Dead. where the Bodies being burnt after the Roman manner, they lay the Ashes under stately Tombs. It is certain, that the Romans have not always burnt their Dead; for their ancient Law commanded, Bury none in the City, nor burn none. Cornelius Sylla, a Roman General, was the first that order'd his Body to be burnt, fearing some might out of revenge do to him what he had done to Marius, whose Bones he digg'd up, and threw into the River Anienis. After that, the Romans us'd only Funeral Pyres; which Custom decay'd and became void in the Emperor An∣toninus his Reign, he commanding again, That the Dead should be buried in great State, and have costly Tombs erected over them. Their remarkable and strange Ceremonies used about the Dead.The Roman Pride in those Affairs, the Japanners have taken an exact Pattern by: for when a Person dies, they set the Corps on a Bier, with his Head bow'd forwards, and his Hands folded together, in a praying Posture, clad in
White, over which hangs a Paper Coat, pasted together, whereon is written the Religion of that Idol whom the deceas'd honor'd and worshipp'd. In this posture four Men carry it out of the City to the Fire; then a great number of his Relations and Friends, which attended the Corps, stand round about the Fire, and call a whole Hour together on the Name of the Idol, whether Amida, Xaca, Canon, or any other, to whose Service in his Life-time the Departed was most devote; whilst the Bonzies play, making a horrible noise, by striking on Copper Kettles and Basons. The Pit wherein the Fire is made, is square, hung round about with Mats, and hath an Entrance that opens towards the four Winds: The Pit it self fill'd full of Wood, which is cover'd with a Sail. On both sides thereof stand Tables, fill'd with Meats, all dress'd in Blood, and Vessels fill'd with Perfumes; and next them, lie great Heaps of Sweet-wood. When the Bier with the Corps approaches, they fasten a long Rope about it, on which every one that can come near lays his Hand, and call all together on the Name of the Deceased's Idol. Thus they carry the Body three times about the Pyre, on the Shoulders of four Men: At last setting the Bier with the Corps on the Pile of Wood, the chief Bonzie waves a lighted Torch three times over the dead Bodies Head; which done, he throws it away; but it is taken up again by the nearest of the Deceaseds Relations, of which one stands on the East, and the other on the West side of the Bier. Three times they give it from one to the other over the Corps; then they set Fire on the Pile of Wood, whilst others that stand next to them pour Oyl and Essences thereon; so that the Flame suddenly ascends the Sky, and consumes the dead Body to Ashes. Mean while, the Children and nearest Relations go to the Tables, kindle the Vessels with Perfumes, and shew Worship to him that is burnt: Which done, every one returns home; onely the Common People that follow'd the Corps, make themselves merry about the Fire, with the Meat that stands on the two Tables by the Funeral Pit. The next day the nearest Allies return again to the Fire, and there gather the Ashes, Teeth, and Bones into a gilded Urn, which carrying home, they set in a private Chamber, and cover with a rich Cloth. Seven days together they mourn, accompanied all the time with some of the Bonzies, who receive great Rewards for the time they spend in such Services. On the seventh day the gilded Urn is Interr'd without the City, in the place where the Body was burnt; which done, they spare no Cost nor Charges in erecting a stately Mo∣nument. Description of the Japan Burying-places.First great Stones are laid over the gilded Urn, sometimes three-square, sometimes after an oval fashion, and at other times with several Corners. The Sides thereof are Ingraven with curious Imagery; either a Lion-Ram∣pant, making towards a Japanner, that holds his Swords in his Hand, ready to resist him; or of Armed Men, deeply engag'd in a Battel; or else of Flow∣ers, which are commonly the Graves of Women. On these Stones are square or round Marble Pillars, on which are ingraven in Japan Characters, his Birth∣day, his Life, Imployment, and other Atchievements, and the time of his Death, whose Bones lye there Interr'd. Next these Graves are to be seen the Representation of the Idol worshipp'd by the Deceas'd, which are generally cut to the life out of Marble. Then are there Men and Womens Pictures, sitting after the Japan manner, with their Legs across under them, every one dress'd in fashionable Apparel; the Men
holding their Hands together in a praying posture: The Women, on the contrary, hold theirs asunder, and look side-ways over their Shoulders. Description of Siquani, the deceas'd Childrens Idol.¶ MOreover, you do not onely meet with very costly Tombs in Japan, but also large Temples dedicated to their Gods that rule over the Dead. Not far from Osacca is a stately Temple, where the Idols Jene and Siquani are worshipp'd by all Mourners. This Idol Sequani sits on a round Pedestal, cover'd with a Scollopp'd Cushion adjoyning to which, a silver Parrot ap∣pears on a Pearch. The Face of the Image represents a Youths; the Hair of the Head ty'd behind with a String of Pearls, one Lock being curl'd, standing upright: His four Arms are cover'd with wide Sleeves, full of sparkling Stars: About his right Arm a Serpent is twisted, whose Head he holds aloft in his Hand: From the Elbow of this Arm grows another, which embracing a young Child, squeezes it against his Breast: In his left Hand he holds a Scymiter, in a ready posture to fight: Half from the left Arm appears a second, with the Hand downwards, holding a round String with Beads. The Child looks stedfastly towards the Sword, with his Hands folded together, and with his Legs across under him, sits on Siquanies wide Breeches. But the Idol Jene is held in great Adoration by the tenth Sect of the Bonzie. He sits in State on a High Altar, which is curious to behold; for at every corner stands a square Pillar, a little distance from the Altar, and is joyn'd Arch-wise to the uppermost Ledge thereof, which is engraven with Stars, and other Curiosities, and the Spaces betwixt, full of Japan Characters. On every corner of the Altar stands a flat Dish; onely behind the Idol, towards the right side, stands a deep Platter, in which Perfumes are continually burnt. The Plates serve to hold the Money which the People offer. In the middle, Jene sits on a round Scollop'd Cushion, being represented with four Bearded Faces, the Heads whereof are all joyn'd together behind: He wears a Golden Crown, with seven Spires, on whose tops are round Balls full of Diamonds. On his Breast hangs a double String of Pearls, and at the end thereof a Rose of Diamonds: His left Arm he holds aloft, and his folded Hand grasps a Staff, which he sticks into a Sun: From this Arm hangs a second downwards, in the Hand holding a pleited Garland. In the uppermost right Hand is a Japan Plant; but that which points downwards, thrusts a Golden Staff into the Smoke over the Perfuming Vessel. Idol Jene rules over an∣cient deceas'd People.This their Idol, as they say, rewards Good and Bad after Death: To him are the Souls of aged and married People committed: Wherefore those that mourn for their Fathers, Mothers, Wives, Husbands, or any other near Rela∣tions, come in great numbers to this Temple, to offer for the Departed Souls on Jene's Altar. Jene's Temple.Moreover, this Temple is always kept lock'd; for the Image stands in an open place, under the azure Canopy of Heaven, between the Temple and the Bonzies Habitation, which look after the performance of their Divine Service to Jene. Before the Temple is a square Portal, on whose Roof at each end rise two Spires, of an exceeding height. On one side lies the Temple-Grove, which with pleasant and shady Trees takes up a great deal of Ground. This Ceremony and Custom of the Japanners, us'd about their Funerals; the burning of their Dead out of the City, costly Burying-places, and Offer∣ings for the Deceas'd Souls, acknowledge a great age, and were us'd by most
of the People that inhabit the Earth; for long before the Birth of our Savior the Celtes us'd to burn their Dead: So did the Germans, Belgians, Gauls, Spani∣ards, and Britains. The Indians and Romans also had the same Custom. Of the Teutonicks and Gauls,Lib. 5. Histor. the Greek Writer Diodorus Siculus relates, That burning their dead Bodies, they threw Letters into the Fire to them, which they be∣liev'd were read by the Departed.In Hispani. Appianus Alexandrinus tells us of the Spani∣ards, That they plac'd the dead Body of their General Variatus, richly adorn'd, on a great Pile of Wood,Lib. 15. Geog. and burnt it. Strabo and Solinus acknowledge, That this Burning of the Dead hath been a Custom amongst the Indians above two thousand years; but without any particular Ceremony or Charge: Whereas the Romans, on the contrary, spent vast Sums of Money on Perfumes, Sweet∣wood, Clothes,Lib. 12. Cap. 28. Pots with Silver and Gold, and other Riches. Pliny makes mention of the Emperor Nero, who cast into one of those Fires more sweet-smelling Herbs, and costly Perfumes, than the whole Countrey of Arabia Felix could produce in a Year:Gall. Lib. 6. These are the Words of Julius Cesar; The Gauls throw all into the Fire, which was acceptable to them in their Life-time, as Beasts, nay, Servants and Hirelings, which were known to be belov'd by them, were burnt with their dead Lords. Moreover, though the Lacedemonians, according to the Laws of Lycurgus, bu∣ried their Dead in the City, and near the Churches, yet it was forbidden by other Grecians. In a Field not far from Athens was the Burying-place of the Athenians, full of Posts and Pillars, on which, the Names of the Deceased were Ingraven. In the time of the Consul Cnejus Duillius, the Romans made a Law, by which every one was commanded to bury their Dead, either near the Flaminian or Latin way, or elfe in his own ground near Rome. Nay the Emperor Adrianus order'd, That any one that made a Grave in any City belonging to the Power of Rome, should forfeit two hundred Crowns; yet notwithstanding, sometimes the Ashes of some Generals that had Conquer'd their Enemies, were
bury'd in the Market-places, which honor was done to the Emperor Trajan in Rome. Elseraks Voyage from Osacca to Nangesaque.¶ BUt the Ambassador Elserak, after six days stay in Osacca, took Shipping on the tenth of January, Anno 1644. and at Evening came to Anchor be∣fore the Village Sangya, three Leagues distant from Osacca, where he was forc'd to stay two days, by reason of contrary Winds, and then setting Sail, ran in the Dusk of the Evening into the Haven of Fiungo; after that, he had a fresh Gale, with which he pass'd by Swoja, Tackessima, Akas, and Firmensi, about Sun-set they were opposite to Muro; but Sailing on all Night, he reach'd to the end of fifty Leagues in twenty four hours. In the Morning he discover'd Bignatum, where he Anchor'd. Then he left Mewarri, Tantonomi, Jocosimi, Caminagari, and Camro on their Starboard, and the little Islands Syriais, Caroto, Szuwa, Jowe, and the mighty Island Tonsa on their Larboard. Apparel of the Inhabi∣tants of Tonsa.¶ THe Inhabitants of Tonsa differ a little in their Apparel from the other Japanners, the Men wear a long Cap, whose top hangs over their Faces, about their Shoulders a loose Furr'd Cotton Coat, over a Silk under-Coat, their Middle girt with a broad Girdle, in which they take great Pride, it being richly Embroyder'd, one end whereof hangs over their Belly almost to the ground. The Women of any quality carry continually a Fan in their Hand; on their Shoulders having a thin Cotton Cloth folded together, and made fast on their Breasts; which hangs behind half way down their Coats, their Girdles also of Silk or Cotton, according to their Estates, are Pleited together: As for their remaining Apparel, it is like that of all other Japan Women. Elserak arrives at Nan∣gesaque.¶ THe sixteenth of January, about midnight, Elserak came to an Anchor before the Village Camenosacci, from thence he Sail'd to the little Island Mocko. Then the Wind coming contrary, and in regard he could gain but lit∣tle by Rowing, he Rode three days at Anchor; then setting Sail again, he en∣ter'd that Evening the Haven of Simonisacci, and the next day drop'd Anchor at Aymissima; here he stay'd but little time, but went on so successfully, that late in the Evening he came up with Firando, which passing by, he ran into the Channel of Zetta, and on the four and twentieth of January Arriv'd at Nange∣saque, where on the Island Disma he found the Servants of the East-India Compa∣ny in good health and condition. Advice to the East-India Company, concerning the redeem'd Hollanders.John Van Elserak the Ambassador, thus come to Nangesaque, sent advice of the ten releas'd Hollanders to Cornelius Vander Liin Governor in Batavia, who found the business to be of so weighty a concern, that he Writ to the East-India Com∣pany in the United Netherlands, that setting out the Ketch Breskens, to discover Tartary, it fell upon the Japan Kingdom Nassame, where they fired several Guns in the Haven of Namboe, for which the Commanders of the Ship going Ashore in their Boat, were taken Prisoners, and carry'd to Jedo, and were at last (not∣withstanding they were to suffer Death according to the Japan Laws) released. The Emperor, who had (during the Hollanders Imprisonment in Jedo) been ve∣ry sick, was on Elserak's Arrival there, restor'd to his former health, whom he found very well disposed, and in a good humor towards him, which prov'd ve∣ry luckily for the Imprison'd Hollanders. The Emperor granting them his Par∣don, because he found, that their offence was committed rather out of igno∣rance than wilfulness.
Find it convenient to send an Embassy, in return of thanks to the Japan Em∣peror.¶ THe East-India Company took this Letter into serious consideration, and at last concluded to requite the Japan Emperor by a peculiar Embassy for his Mercy shewn to the Imprison'd Hollanders, and his usual civility to their People and Commerce at Nangesaque. To make the Embassy the more accepta∣ble, they sent the Emperor for Presents, two Brass-Guns that carry'd a Shot of forty Pound weight, with Rammers, Spunges, and Charging-Ladles, a great Looking-Glass in an Ebony Frame, surrounded with small Looking-Glasses in Silver; nine Pieces of fine Cloth, of several Colours; one great Prospective Glass, inclos'd in a Gold Enammell'd Case, and one Surratish Alcative. On this Order from the United Netherlanders, Cornelius Vander Liin, Governor in Batavia, rested not, but Consulting with the Lords Francis Caron, Charles Reinerson, and Garret Demmer, concluded on the following Order, the seven and twentieth of June, Anno 1649. according to which Orders written down, the Ambassador Peter Blockhoffe, sent to Japan in the Ketch Robin, was to carry himself: The Contents these. Orders given by the In∣dian Councel, according to which the Ambassador must carry himself to the Japan∣ners.¶ STeer your Course directly for Japan, and put not in for Formosa, nor any other Countrey, because it is already late in the Year, that you may not loose the usual Trade-Winds. In your Voyage, examine the Ships Company for Papist-Books, Pictures, or any other Trifles belonging to the, Roman Religion; and the more, because the Japan Councel strictly Examin'd if the Ship Breskens had not brought Portugal-Priests from the Manilla's: When you come near the Japan Shore, you will get Waiters on Board, which you must entertain civilly. The Order which the Japan Governors or Comman∣ders give you, and also what the Interpreters and Servants to the East-India Company, on the Island Disma, counsel you, you shall observe, and not fol∣low your own Inventions. When you are ready to go to Jedo, Clothe your Men in Blue Serge, which Apparel let them wear all their Journey, except when you go to any Japan Lord, or thorow a great City; then let your Attendance put on their Pink Colour'd Cloth Suits: When you go to speak with the Emperor or Com∣plement any of the Councel, then let your Retinue wear their best and rich∣est Liveries, being White and Red. Be careful that you are not curious to see strange Novelties, except you are invited to it by Persons of Quality: At your first Arrival at Nangesaque, make the reason of your Embassy known to the Governors there, and ask Advice of Dirk Snoek, and Antony Brookhurst, and follow the counsel of the Japan Interpreters. You must learn the Words of the chief cause of your Embassy perfect, that you may say them by Rote; because when you appear before Persons of Quality, they privately Write them down, and after∣wards modestly ask the same Question again, to see if the last agree with the first. Moreover, excuse your self to the Japan Lords, that you are a Stranger, and by that means, not knowing their Customs, entreat their favorable assistance thereof for the East-India Company, and Governor at Batavia, depend solely upon their Friendship: Shew them the Inventory of the Presents sent to the Emperor; with Intreaties, to find a means to convey them to him; proffer the Governor of Nangesaque some of them.
If you should be ask'd at Nangesaque, or in the Emperors Court, or else∣where, In whose Name you perform this Embassy? What Authority and Power the East-India Company hath? What their Employment? If they have the Government in their own Hands? If the Presents came from the Ne∣therlands or from Batavia? If they are onely sent to the Emperor, or also to his Councel? Give them a short Answer to all their Questions; As for ex∣ample, The East-India Company consists of the Eminentest Persons of the se∣veral Cities in the United Netherlands; Drive a vast Trade through all the World, with the great Stocks that are laid up by the Company; They keep not one constant Government, but change sometimes: Add here, That you were sent thither by the said Company, to officiate in that Embassy, and to give the Presents made in the Netherlands to the Emperor; besides several Pieces of Cloth that were to be given to the Japan Lords, according as the Governor on the Island Disma shall judge, what every one likes best: When you speak, use but few Words, when with silence you cannot give satisfacti∣on; for otherwise Silence is no where so great a Vertue as in the presence of the Japan Lords. Present those Lords high that use to give Gifts to the East-India Company, though you give away all the European Clothes. Concerning the Peace concluded between the United Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal, which they very much fear'd would be ill Resented by the Ja∣pan Emperor, the Spaniards and the Portuguese being his mortal Enemies: You may tell them, That according co the Relation spread some time since in Ja∣pan, all Christendom being tyr'd out with a long War, were now inclin'd to Peace; so that France and Spain had made a League of Amity with the Empe∣ror of Germany, in which League were included, Denmark, Poland, and Italy; onely France and Portugal were at Wars against Spain, yet so, that two Medi∣ators were chosen for the deciding of the Differences, which without perad∣venture would be done in a short time, having already by woful experience tasted the Cruelty of a long War; whilst the Turk, a sworn Enemy to all Christians, had made himself Master of several Fortresses, Cities, and Territo∣ries. The Peace which the Christians make amongst themselves, is onely to joyn their divided Forces, and so United, ingage the Turks Army which con∣stantly lies on the Christians Borders. The remaining Orders which Blockhoffe was to observe were these: You must well consider of your Words before you speak them, and excuse your self, that being a Merchant you cannot give any great account concerning State-Affairs. The Japanners are subtle enough to know, that you do not come thither to give them an account of the Netherlanders Government; in which Relation, some sought to gain Praise, but indeed had like to have spoil'd the business of the East-India Company by it; for indeed the Japanners despise a Common-wealth, and esteem no Government but sole Monarchy. When you are invited to Dinner to any Noble-man, be sparing in Drink∣ing, and also of your Words; speak little, when with silence you cannot give satisfaction; onely the returning of Thanks for good Entertainment, or Benefits receiv'd, repeat six or seven times over: Keep no Feasts, because the Conversation with Japanners is dangerous; yet if any Person of Quality hath a mind to Netherland-Meat, and desires to Eat thereof, refuse him not, but provide all things fit for his Entertainment, without sparing of Cost; and then go you and sit at the lower end of the Table, and thank your Guest for the Honor he hath done you by his Company.
But to Citizens and Merchants observe your Authority as beseems your Office; follow the Advice of the Interpreters, which continually bear you company, and tell you how you must converse with Persons of Quality, and the rather, because the Interpreters are Politick-men, on which you may de∣pend, and because their own welfare consists upon the good Estate of the East-India Company. What Feast the Ambassa∣dor must prepate for the Japan Lords. In the Interim, when you are return'd from Jedo to Nangesaque, and the Presents accepted by all Persons, then prepare a stately Dinner for the prime Japan Commanders there; you must on your Return at Jedo, Miaco, or Osacca, furnish your self with Wine, Salmon, Habberdine, Carps done in Rice, and a Crane, although he cost seventy Tail (every Tail is an English Crown) all which Meats must be well Salted, and Dress'd after the Japan manner; of which the Interpreters take great care. So soon as you Land at Nangesaque, you shall bespeak for your self and every one of your Retinue, three pair of Buskins, and six Pair of thin Shoes of Drefs'd Buck-Skin, to use in your going and coming from Court; for the Japanners lay costly Mats on their Floors, which never are trode upon with Shooes; Boots and Spurs are not us'd in Japan. Your self shall wear no Weapon, but your People must every one wear a Silver-Hilted Rapier, which they are carefully to preserve from Dirt and Rain, that the beauty thereof may not be gone when your People Wait in the Emperors Hall, whilst you are admitted to private Conference with the Emperor. In Osacca furnish your self with Umbrello's made of Yarn, every couple of your Retinue must have one of them, but each an Oyl'd Paper Cloak against the Rain, which in dry Weather are laid in Woodden Chests: You shall likewise buy in Osacca as many Wax'd Lethern-Portmanteaus as your Goods require: The Blankets, Cushions, and Quilts are in the day time Pack'd up, and carry'd on Horses, but at Nights spread on a Floor in your Inn to Sleep upon. From the Accounts kept by those that Travel yearly to the Emperor, you may guess what you have to pay for the Meat which you have in your Inn; namely, to give them twenty Guilders when they ask ten, and a hundred when fifty. Moreover, Peter Blockhoffe shall have the upper hand of all the Japan Go∣vernors on Disma; and next the Merchants Dirk, Snock, Anthony Brockhurst, and Andrew Frisius shall keep their places according to their old Custom; but Blockhoffe is not to concern himself with the Trade, though it be requested from him by the Japanners; for he may excuse himself, that he comes onely to officiate an Embassy to the Emperor. The usual Presents must be double-divided, because last year, by an accident, they were not parted. Before you go from Nangesaque to Jedo, desire the Governors there to give you Letters of Recommendation to Sicungodonne, which when you give him, shew him the same Request as you did the Magistrates at Nangesaque; and humbly desire him, that he would be pleas'd to direct you, how, in what manner, and to whom the Presents must be given. Tell him that his Name is famous in all the Netherlands for his courteous Services shown to the East-India Company: Upon the delivery of the Presents, none shall appear be∣fore the Emperor, but Blockoffe and Frisius, your Retinue must stay in the Hall, as you will understand from the Interpreters.
There hath oftentimes by the Emperors Command been Order given for a Mortar-Piece, which through urgent Occasions hath been neglected; but now acquaint him, that you have brought a Man (Experienc'd in that Art) thither for the Emperors Service; besides the foremention'd Presents for his Imperial Majesty, you have good store of fine light colour'd, black and red Cloth, besides Crown-Serges, ordinary Serge, and Damask, to bestow plen∣tifully on his Nobility. Excuse your self, that you give not richer Presents, because the East-India Company know not what was most acceptable to his Majesty and his Councel. Before you appear to the Emperor, you will be Examin'd, What your Embassy is for? Reply, For nought else, but to thank the Emperor for his kind Delivery of the ten Hollanders, and to Extol his great Favors shown to the East-India Company in Japan. Andrew Frisius is order'd to be your Secreta∣ry, who is to keep a Journal of all daily Observations and Passages of Re∣mark, which deserve to be Register'd. John Hakkins shall be your Gentleman-Usher, and to prepare the Silver Vessel. Take special care that none of your People debauch themselves with Drinking or Whoring, but punish them severely; let your People keep their Nails Cut, their Hair Comb'd, and wear clean Linnen, and Wash themselves in all places they can conveniently. The Load-stones which you have, the Physical Herbs, Spectacles, Prospective-Glasses, Tent, Wine, Cheese, Dutch Butter, Brazile Wood, Italian Earthen Ware, Barrels for Guns, and Multiply∣ing-Glasses, give some to every one that asks for them: The red Beads, give now and then to Noble-mens Children, their Servants, or your Landlords, as a thing to remember you by. Concerning the Lord of Firando, who is Indebted twenty five Thousand Guilders to the East-India Company, you must seriously advise about it with the Interpreters, if we should not incur the Displeasure of the Nangesaquean Magistrates; if the said Lord be Discharg'd from the Debt, because being Impoverish'd by Fire, he is not able to Pay. It would at least be a Courtesie that would Obliege the Lord of Firando; yet if the Interpreters should ad∣vise the contrary, Blockhoffe must follow their counsel, but give order, that the said Lord hereafter be no more ask'd for the Debt, as heretofore they had done yearly. Your best Apparel, Silver-Work, and all things else which are for a shew, let them not be seen in the Streets, at your Table, nor Lodging-Rooms, un∣less to some Noble Japanners: Intreat by all means, that the Ship Robin may continue in the Haven of Nangesaque, till you have done your Embassy to the Emperor; that then you may come directly, without touching at Formosa or elsewhere, in her to Batavia, and from thence to Holland, with the Fleet which goes thither in December, that the East-India Company may be inform'd by your self, concerning your Affairs with the Japan Emperor. Remember your self likewise, that you never come before any Person of Quality with your Hat off, but to Common People you need not so much observe that State. Lastly, Because Blockhoffe went sick Aboard, Andrew Fri∣sius had strict Order, that if Blockhoffe should happen to die by the way, to preserve his Body by Embalming, that it might be seen by the Japanners that were so minded: For the making of the Coffin, the Master of the Ship had Wood provided for that purpose.
Frisius sent to succeed Blockhoffe, was to observe all the foremention'd Orders exactly: Mean while, Blockhoffe dying on the way between Batavia and Japan, Frisius and Brookhurst Officiated the Embassy, according to the Relation given you in the first Part. An Embassy of Zacha∣rias Wagenaer, to the Em∣peror of Japan.¶ SInce their being at Jedo, the Splendid Embassy of Zacharias Wagenaer is ve∣ry remarkable: The East-India Company are much concern'd for the Trade of Japan, notwithstanding they in Traffick, deliver and receive Goods through all India, and farther. For the Javan Cities Bantam, Molassery, Charga, Bayas, Cuconu, Cherelas, Charita, Cheregin, Labnan, Buanium, Iscbongoir, Parmam and Punctam, Truck for Cormandel Cot∣ton against Pepper, Cubebes, Storax, and Cardamoms. Jortam lying opposite to the Island Madura, hath a safe Harbor against all Winds, and affords abundance of Rice, and Cotton-Yarn. Banda, and the Islands Lontor, Gounongapay, Pouloway, Pouleron, and Rossangayn; near which lie three uninhabited Isles, Poulomon, Poulocapel, and Pouloswangay in five Degrees Southern Latitude; all these produce plenty of Coco-nuts, Lemons, Oranges, and chiefly Nutmegs and Mace; so that they can deliver yearly three Thousand five Hundred Sokkels of Nutmegs and Cloves, every Sokkel reckon'd a Hundred Pound of Holland Weight, and Twenty Pounds of Nutmegs to one of Mace. The Trees whereon this Fruit grows, bear thrice a year. The chiefest Plant, by the Bandances call'd Eyer Ponte, which signifies White Water, is ripe in July and August. Whilst they gather their Nutmegs, the Water is as white as Milk. The second Fruit, by them call'd Monson Java, is ripe in March; the third and smallest, nam'd Conarg, in October; so that there is scarce any time in the year but the Trees bear either ripe, or at least green Nuts. These Islands barter for Jortan and Baleian Linnen, Cormandel Clothes, wove after the Maleian manner: and amongst Provisions in scarce Times, they ra∣ther desire Rice than Silver or Gold. Ternata is eight Leagues in circumference, hath besides several Villages un∣inhabited in times of War, three Cities, Gammalamme, the Residence of the an∣tient King of Ternata; Maleye, now call'd Orange, and Tacomy, nam'd William-Stad. To Ternata belong also the Isles Machian, Motier, and Meau, all like Ternata pro∣ducing abundance of Cloves, for they afford yearly two thousand Bars, every Bar reckon'd to six hundred twenty five Pound; for which in Barter they re∣ceive Cotton, Linnen, and Rice. Amboina was formerly taken by the Spaniards from the King of Ternata; but Steven vander Hagen, a Dutch Admiral, Conquering Amboina, brought it under the subjection of the Holland East-India Company. The Cloves which grow here are commonly gather'd green in August, and dry away at least twenty Pound in a hundred. Batsian, taken from the Spaniard by the Vice-Admiral Simon Horn, abounds with Clove-trees, yet few Inhabitants to look after the gathering of them. Achyn, the chief City for Trade in the North of Samutra, barters Pepper, Diamonds, Gold, and Tin, against Negapatan, Surat, and Aracan Cotton, as also against Elephants Teeth and Rice. Before Achyn lies the Island Amacau; where they find Ambergreece. On the East-side of Samutra lie spread a vast way in the Ocean the Islands Jamby, Palmbam, Andregiro, and Campar.
Towards the South against Samutra, lie Priman, Passaimanticos, Baros, Bedi, Dampin, and Manancabo; all surrounded by the Ocean, and yield great store of Pepper, but the Island Jamby is the chief of them all, and produces, as most of them do, besides Pepper, Benjamin, and Camphire. Queda and Pera, lying about Malacca, in seven Degrees Northern-Latitude, produce likewise good Pepper, which they exchange for Negatapan Cotton and Rice. Manair, before the Promontory Comoryn in the Straights, between Ceylon and Cormandel, affords Pearls. Ceylon yields Cinamon, Ginger, Ivory, Saffron, Pearls, and some Pepper. Bisnager, Narsinga, and Cormandel, produce Diamonds, Pearls, Cotton, fine painted Linnen; with which, and Cotton together, the Portuguese us'd formerly to lade a Carrack at St. Thomas's, to go to Malacca, where the said Commodities are changed with the neighboring Indians for Provisions; and when by contra∣ry Winds the Carrack stay'd behind, Malacca generally suffer'd Famine, as it hap∣pen'd Anno 1602. when the English Admiral Lancaster Conquer'd a Carrack, and barter'd away the Cotton at Bantam against Pepper. Moreover, Malacca uses to vend Opium, Flannel, Serges, red Cloth, Coral, Rose-water, Saffrons, red Kersies, Glasses both to Drink in, and Look in, and Paper. The Islands Nicuber, lying in seven Degrees Northern-Latitude, between Ceylon and Sumatra, afford abundance of Amber-greece, given in exchange for Rice, and all manner of Provisions. The vast Kingdom of Pegu is twelve Degrees Northerly of Nicuber: The chiefest Cities for Trade are Martabam, Fatty, Consuim, Cabban, Camland, Ava, and Berma; where they drive a great Trade with Rubies and Civet, in exchange for Masulipatan, Palicatan, and Bengala Linnen, Drugs from Cambaya, Silk, Stuffs, Mace, Nutmegs, Saffron, Rose-water, Copper, Quicksilver, Vermillion, and Coral. Cambaya and Borneo produce Benjamin, Rice, and Pepper. On the North of Cambaya lies the Golden Lais; on the East, Campa; where Calambak, which is the same as Aloes, is weighed against Silver. Here also is good Timber for the building of Ships. Bengala hath that Name from its Metropolis, cut through in the middle by the mighty River Ganges, and hath besides Bengala the Cities Satigam and Cati∣gam, lying Northward from Pegu in twenty Degrees, it produces Cotton-Clothes painted with Flowers, white Linnen, Ginger, Sugar, Wax, Rice, and Precious Stones. The vast Island Borneo boasts of the Towns Banjarmassing, Lave, and Sukkedan: where against Copper, Iron, Quicksilver, Gold, Glass, Woollen Clothes, Cot∣ton, Paper, and Chinese Money call'd Papis, they exchange rich Diamonds, the best Camphire, Mirabolans, Sugar, Wax, Rice, Cinnamon, Tortoise-shells (ve∣ry much desir'd on the Coast of Cormandel) and the Bezoar Stone. To the East of Borneo lies Patany, famous for the abundance of Pepper it produceth, and great Trade there driven with the Chineses, Siammers, and Pe∣guahs, Trucking for Cotton, woven after the Maleian manner, Bengala Clothes, Woollen-Clothes, and Ryals of Eight. Cochinchina jets Eastward against Bengala, and sells Gold, Pepper, Aloes, and ordinary Silk-Stuffs, for Silver. The Island Agano, ten Leagues from Cochinchina produceth abundance of Pearls.
Meaco, Chincheo, Liampo, and Hitium Fenquoso, the chief Cities of the Province of Matquiem, afford Pearls, Gold, Copper, Steel, Iron, Lattin, Tin, Lead, Quicksilver, Vermilion, Musk, Civet, Amber, Brimstone, Rhubarb, China, Camphire, Ginger, Sugar, Porcelin, raw Silk, Cotton, Linnen, and Precious Stones: in Barter for which they receive fine red Coral, Silver, Drugs which grow on Cambaya, Wood from Timor, English Clothes, Opium, Talicatta Cottons, Holland Linnen, Ivory, Pictures with Landskips, Spanish Wine, Crystal Glasses, Carpets, and all sorts of Kersies. On the Islands Lequeo and Pequeo is much Gold. Timor and Solor produce Sandal-Wood, for Silver and Cormandel Linnen. Siam affords Benjamin, Rubies, Gold, and abundance of Provisions; which they exchange for all manner of Netherland Commodities. Lohor, bordering to Siam, brings Aloes and Porcelin to Market. Cambaya borders upon the Coast of Malabare: Here is the best Indigo, ei∣ther wrought or unwrought Cotton, Sugar, Ginger, Mirabolans, Wheat, But∣ter, and the Plant Ingawa, which are Truck'd against Ivory, Sandal-Wood, Tortoise-shells, Malabarian Cardamoms, Chinese Silk, Maldivian Coco's, Quicksilver, Allom, Benjamin, Porcelin, Musk, Netherland Kerfres, and Saffron. What Commodities are Vended in Japan.To Japan the Chineses carry in their Jonks, raw Silk, white and red Gilems, Glasses, Flannels, Sattins, Flaxen Linnen, Liquorish, white and brown Su∣gar, Cambodian Nuts, Caimans Skins, red Leather, Allom, Wax, Steel, Cotton, Sublimat, Cassia Fistula, Spanish-Green, Tee, Porceline-colour, Camphire, Calembak, Musk, Chinese Mats, Buck-skins, Combs, Cow-hides, Paper and Chinese Books. Concerning the Trade which the Hollanders drive in Japan, the following Matter shall at large declare. Orders given to the Ambassador Wagenaer to observe in his Embassy to Japan.¶ BUt to return: Zacharias Wagenaer being dispatch'd by the Governor Maetsuiker and the Indian Councel at Batavia to Nangesaque, on the eleventh July, Anno 1656. to dispossess John Bouchelion, he receiv'd the follow∣ing Orders: Bear always with the high Ambition and Pride of the Japanners, that you may preserve their Favor: Sicungodonne the chief Speaker for the East-India Company at the Emperor's Court, desires to have Looking-glasses, Crystal Eyes, Perspective-glasses, and Spectacles; take care that they are deli∣ver'd to his hands: without leave and consent of the Governor of Nangesaque do not go to Jedo: You may make ready for your Journey the fifteenth and twentieth of December, Sicungodonne having assur'd us, that before New-years-day, by the Japanners call'd Songuats, and agrees with the thirteenth of February, you shall have Audience at the Emperor's Court. In Osacca Present the Go∣vernor Makido Sandosamma, whose Father is a great Favorite of the Emperor's. Of Sandosamma you must desire a free Pass; he is a courteous Gentleman, and uses to speak with all the Holland Ambassadors that pass through there, which is against the custom of his Predecessor Souwosamma, who would ne∣ver see them. Forget not to Present also the new Council in Jedo. The In∣terpreter Phatsiosaimon, who with the remaining Interpreters accompanies the Embassy, must enquire of Sicungodonne what is best to be done. Forget not to Complement the old Governor of Nangesaque, who being grown antient hath retir'd from all Courtly Employments; and thank him for his former Courtesies done to the East-India Company; and also Present him with some Tent, which he hath desir'd. Enquire by the Interpreter
Schescymon of Sicungodonne, what is best to be done with the stately Surattish Alcatiff, of late repair'd, and now on the Island Disma? If it would be fit to be Presented to the Emperor? The Water-Engine which his Imperial Maje∣sty hath ask'd for, will be ready to be sent the next year.Dutch Seed and Plants grow in Japan Moreover, we have receiv'd advice, that the Dutch Seed and Plants grow very well in Sicun∣godonne's Garden, and are much admir'd by the Japan Councel. Take great care for the young Siam Apple-trees, that the Roots thereof be now and then water'd in the Ground, that so they may come safe to Sicungodonne's hands. Let also your Head Chirurgeon, Hans Hunke, go with the Embassy to Jedo, that he may inform the way how to ufe the Dutch Medicines against some Ja∣pan Sicknesses, according to the Request of Sicungodonne: in whose House are remaining eight Fowling-Pieces and a Pocket-Pistol, which for some reasons were the last year judg'd to be unserviceable; let Sicungodonne keep two of them for himself, and give order what shall be done with the rest. The Presents which are to be given to the Emperor, his Councel, and other Per∣sons of Quality, are by times, as the Hollanders Landlord and Interpreter think fit, divided at Jedo, because thereby they may raise the value and esteem of them, and an Inventory thereof deliver'd to Sicungodonne, who looking it over, alters it divers times. Moreover,Goods requir'd by the Japan Lords. there hath been chiefly de∣sir'd by Jaabaminosamma, Lord of Odoura an Astronomer, three Pieces of white Velvet, and two costly Perspective-glasses; the Councellor Botsokey, a green Thrum Blanket; the Councellor Matsondeiro Issinocamy, five Pocket Looking-glasses, one Reading-glass, and three Spectacles; the first Coun∣cellors Son Jusiensamma, a Piece of English Dy'd Damask, one Piece of white Velvet, and three Pieces of black Cloth-Serge; Mito Siovangosamma, the Em∣peror's Uncle, five Strings of red Coral, and three pair of Spectacles: of all which give to every one their desir'd Commodities.The Emperor's Pre∣sents. For the Emperor we have sent with you besides, rich Pieces of Plush, Padaways, two great Cop∣per Globes, a rare Looking-glass, and a live Casuaeris. Description of the Bird Casuaeris.This Bird is taken on Banda, and much bigger than a Crane, hath brown Feathers, but neither Wings, Tongue, nor Tail; his Breast is arm'd with an Oval Shield, exceeding hard, his Neck like that of a Turky, onely that his moveable Combe being red and blue, hard and stiff, of the thickness of a Mans Finger, stand upwards athwart his Head, his Feet yellowish, are most like unto those of an Ostrich. The most to be admir'd in it is, his devouring and evacuating that which he hath eaten, swallowing not onely all that comes before him, but also glowing Coals, which come cold from him again. Wagenaer arrives at Nan∣gesaque.Wagenaer arriving at Nangesaque took possession of Bouchelion's Place; who going Aboard of the Fly-boat call'd The Evening-Star, set Sail on the second of October, Anno 1656. for Batavia. After which Joffiesamma, the new Governor of Nangesaque, went to visit the Governor Wagenaer in the East-India Store-house on the Island Disma; where he took great delight in the Garden behind the Store-house, being planted after the Dutch manner. Mean while Wagenaer pre∣pared himself to Complement the Emperor, the Governor giving him his own liberty, when he pleas'd to go; so that he concluded to set forth on his Jour∣ney the seven and twentieth of December.Is forc'd to put off his Journey because of the foolish opinion of the Ja∣panners concerning Day. But the Interpreters having a Cu∣stom to make the Hollanders Requests known to the Governor Sacquemondonne the chief Magistrate, their Journey was put off, Sacquemondonne telling them, that the twenty seventh of December was by the Japanners accounted amongst the un∣lucky Days: Which Opinion hath long reign'd amongst the Heathens.
The Romans and Greeks accounted those fatal Days on which their Coun∣trey or City suffer'd any mischance: yet some of them despised this foolish Fancy; for Lucius Lucullus led his Army against Tigranes on the sixth of Novem∣ber, by the Romans accounted unfortunate to begin any weighty matter upon; yet it so fell out, that Lucullus with small Forces routed a great Army. The Macedonians reckon'd the Moneth of June to be fatal: notwithstanding Alexander the Great sleighted that idle Opinion, when in June he encountred with the Persian King Darius. Ventidius also was no way daunted to venture against Pacorus the Parthian, on the same day whereon Crassus with a great Power of the Romans had been defeated by the Parthians. But Sacquemondonne had another opinion concerning the Times; he thereby seem'd to be careful of Wagenaer, and thought it convenient to put off the unfor∣tunate Day till the tenth of the Japan Moon, which agrees with the last day of the European December: But the Governor still putting it off from time to time, Wagenaer did not set out of Nangesaque till the ninth of January 1657.Wagenaer's Journey for Jedo. leaving the Government of the Island Disma to John Odgers and Meindert Mestecker,Left Orders concerning the Netherland Store-house ordering them to take care that the Store-house should be carefully look'd after, to keep out the Rain, and other Water from spoiling the Goods; that the Book-keep∣ers should keep no Fires in their Chambers, so to prevent all danger that might happen, having understood before his departure, that a great Fire had been at Jedo; that the Chinese Jonks which come to Coxenga with Fleets consist∣ing of thirty Ships at a time from Anhay and Chincheu to Japan, may easily be prohibited, because they had dealt like Enemies with the Japanners, by Sailing to the Manilla's; by which means the East-India Company would reap great be∣nefits; for when the Chineses come often thither, then the Japanners raise their refin'd Copper Bars, and their Camphire to a high rate. The Camphire Trees grow most in the Japan Province Satsuma. Is forced to stay at Osacca.Whereupon Wagenaer taking Shipping arriv'd in twelve days at Osacca; where in two days he provided all things necessary for his Journey by Land: but when ready to set forth he receiv'd Order to stay in his House, the Day ap∣proaching on which the former Emperor died, which was kept very strictly through all Japan: After that, Wagenaer having already hir'd eighty five Foot∣men, and six and forty Horses, to carry the Presents, and their other Luggage to Jedo, had leave to depart. Japanners Marry many Women.¶ AS the Japanners with great state and sorrow keep the Day of the Empe∣ror's death, so likewise their Ceremonies of Marriage are perform'd in as great state and splendor, with unexpressible joy. It is the Custom in Japan, as in most Parts of Asia, to Marry several Women; which Custom the Japanners have brought from China, where a Man is not bound to one Woman. This unlimited lasciviousness took place in Asia many Ages since. And who knows not that the Persians and Medes, nay the Israelites themselves, and mongst them the wisest of Kings, Solomon, were given over to that wanton Lust. Where a Woman hath many Husbands.But if this Crime deserves to be punish'd, then we may condemn the foul Custom observ'd by the antient Arabs, Nebatheans, and Britains, namely, that one Woman was common to a whole Family; to which when any one went, he set his Stick up at the Door, as a sign, that at that time none might come in and concern himself with her, on punishment of Adultery. Some Moors, as also the Garamanties and Liminiri, Lay with the Women by the
hundred, and after five years the Children begotten out of such a mixture were distributed, every man taking one which was most like him. The Troglodites gave the betrothed Brides first to be known to the Bride∣grooms nearest Relations and Brothers. Of some People about their Marriage.Yet though the Japanners take as many Women as they will, yet they hold one as their true and lawful Wife, which onely sits with her Husband at Ta∣ble, whilst the rest are like Servants. The Children also which he gets by his Concubines, at his Death get but very little of his Estate: for those that are born of his lawful Wife inherit all; Which Custom is also deriv'd from China; where the Emperor, before the Tartar made himself Master of that Empire, Marry'd besides his Empress, thirty other Women, being the most beautiful that could be found in all his Dominions of China: all which remain'd in the Palace till the Emperors Death; when his Successor, after the Burial of the deceased Emperor, Clothing the thirty Women in rich Apparel, carry'd them to his second Palace, there placing every one on a stately Throne: whereon sitting with their Faces cover'd, thirty Chinese Princes chosen by the Emperor, entred the Hall, every one of them taking one of the said Women by the Hand, and instantly Marry'd them. Strange kind of Marri∣age observ'd by the Ja∣panners.The Chineses and Japanners observe chiefly, that the Brides and Bridegrooms differ not much in their Age, Estate, and Extract. The Betrothed are in the Morning early carry'd in costly Coaches, drawn either by Oxen or Horses from their Houses out of the City, accompanied with all manner of Vocal and Instrumental Musick to a high Hill, attended by a great number of People, and sometimes are so crowded, that they are forc'd to have Soldiers with them to clear the Way: After the Bridegroom's Coach▪ follow several Wayns loaden with Presents, with which he buys the Bride. Which Manner they have like∣wise brought out of China: for there the Man gives to the new marry'd Wo∣man divers Marriage Goods; which she delivers to her Father or Mother, as a requital for the bringing of her up; so that the chief Riches increase from the number of their Daughters, and chiefly when they are beautiful. The antient Babylonians bringing their Daughters to Market at a certain time of the year, sold them to those that proffer'd most: the Price was set ac∣cording to their Beauty, those that were handsomest yielding the best Rate; and ordinary Faces were sold for lesser Sums: yet the homeliest also went off; for the Money which was bestow'd for the fairest, was given as Portions for the hard-favor'd; so that they in stead of being bought, they purchas'd Hus∣bands for themselves. Far more shamefully did the Phoenician Maidens order their affairs, when they went into the Temple of Venus to proffer their Virginities to sale, and with that Money so gotten, bought them Husbands. The same Custom was observed by the Cyprian Maids, who for Money pro∣stituted themselves so long to Strangers, till they had gotten Wealth enough to purchase Marriage with some of their election. Nay, the Armenians had a Law, according to which the Maids in the antient Temple dedicated to the Goddess Anetis, whose Image was made of Massie Gold, should at a set time prostitute themselves in common to all Men; after which there were none but desir'd her in Marriage, that had been so consecra∣ted to the same Goddess. The antient Indians brought their Daughters into the Company of fine Youths, that they might chuse one out of the number, which in Strength,
swiftness in Running, Wrestling, and well-timberdness of Body exceeded the other. The Cathaians observe the same manner, but upon inviolable promises, that she will be burnt with her Husbands Body, if he chance to die before her. The Indian Women also leap into the same Funeral Fire; and those that out of fear do not go in to be burnt with their Husbands, are accounted dishonest. The Laxamatees, near the Lake Meosis, may not Marry before they have slain an Enemy: and also the Carmani may not betroth themselves before they have brought an Enemy's Head to the King. Roman and Greek Brides must bring Portions, but in Japan the Bridegrooms.The antient Romans and Greeks maintain'd quite another Custom than the Japanners; for with them the Brides were to bring Portions to the Bridegrooms: wherefore the Roman Consul gave the Daughters of the famous Generals, Cneius Scipio, and Martus Curius, their Portions out of the Treasury, because being poor they could not be Marry'd according to their Birth. The like did the Athenians to the Daughters of the valiant Heroe Aristides. But Solon and Lycurgus, both Greek Law-givers, commanded strictly, That no Bride should bring Money into the Bridegrooms Pocket. The Germans took no Marriage to be lawful, unless the Man produced his promis'd Estate: Which Law was also observ'd by the Biskiners. The Egyptians never Marry'd for Estates; for if the Woman brought any Riches to the Man, then he, according to their Laws, was to be her Slave. Moreover, the Lacedemonians durst not seem to Marry for Money: where∣fore those were severely punish'd, that at Lacedemon Courted Lysander's Daugh∣ters, and after the Decease of their Father forbore their Suit; which the Judge interpreted thus: That they had not Courted the Persons, but their Money. Just so it is in Japan, where the Man Marries not onely a Bride without a Portion, but must give her divers Goods for Marrying of him: Which Cu∣stom is likewise Extracted from China; where the Bride brings no Money to her Bridegroom, though she carry all manner of Housholdstuff to his House, as Stools, Chairs, Umbrello's, and other things, sufficient to fill up a small Street; for it is all bought with the Money which the Bridegroom hath given her. Confirming of Marria∣ges in Japan very remarka∣ble.Furthermore, the Japanners celebrate their Marriages in the following man∣ner: When the Bride approaches one side of the foremention'd Hill, she gets out of her Coach, and ascends the Steps that lead to the top thereof: On the other side the Bridegroom gets up; both their Attendants wait below, onely their Parents, with some Musicians ascend the Hill also by divided Steps; for in the middle thereof is a broad Rail, or Partition, both sides thereof on the top adorn'd with Golden Balls, by which those that get up, hold fast. The Bridegroom takes the right-hand of the Bride when he goes up the Stairs, and is follow'd by the Musicians: On the left-side the Bride walks up, accompa∣ny'd with her own and his Parents; on the top of the Hill their Parents stand behind the Bride, and the Musicians at some distance behind the Bridegroom; the Fathers and Mothers stand two and two under a Canopy, held over their Heads by their Servants; the Musicians on the one side are very busie, sitting flat on the Ground, and Play on a kind of Dulcimers, Citterns, Viols, but differ∣ing both in shape and sound from the Europeans; others stand before great Cop∣per Basons hanging by Chains under a sharp Roof, which rest on two Pillars; on these they strike with thick Pestles, according to the time of their several Tunes. Between the Parents of the Betrothed and the Musicians stands a most
Iapanische traugeprauge Ceremonie van haer TROUWEN. Ceremonie of theyr Merridge
beautiful Tent, whose Cover on the top is made of Oyl'd Paper, and under∣neath of Japan Silk, hanging over an eight-square Frame; the top whereof ri∣ses up sharp, with eight Balls, one lesser than the other; the Covering rests on eight Pillars; in the middle of them stands a stately Altar, on which sits their Wedding Idol; which spreading his Arms asunder,The Japanners Wed∣ding Idol. holds in the hands a strong Copper Wyre coming like a Semicircle under his Chin. This Idol is represented with a Dogs Head, by which the Japanners would express the faithfulness and constancy that belongs to a Marry'd Life; and by the Copper Thred, the strong tye of Marriage. Such was the beginning of Idol-Images, by whose deform'd shapes some realities of things are shewn, by their agreeing with the signs and the signifi'd matter. How they are Marry'd.Before the Idol with a Dogs-head stands a Bonzi, or Japan Priest, on his right-hand the Bride, and on his left the Bridegroom, both holding lighted Torches in their Hands; the Bride lights her Torch by one of the eight Lamps which stand round about the Tent, but not without great mutterings of the Bonzi; which done, the Bridegroom lights his by the Brides; whereupon a joyful shout is made, all with a loud voice wishing joy to them, whilst the Bonzi gives them his Blessing. The antient Romans and Greeks us'd Torches at their Ceremonies of Mar∣riage made of Pine-branches, which were carry'd before the Brides in the Night by five Youths: But among the Greeks the Brides Mother carry'd it. Moreover, the Blessing which is spoke by the Bonzi, is of a very antient Ex∣tract: for the Israelites observ'd that Custom when the concern'd Parties in Beth-hillula, that is, A House of Praise, flock'd together, and sung joyful Hymns before the Bride and Bridegroom, the chief Priest taking a Cup full of Wine, said, Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, which hast created joy and mirth, give love to the Bride and Bridegroom, a Brotherly inclination, peace, and quiet dwelling. I pray, O Lord, let there immediately he heard in the Cities of Juda, and in the Streets of Jerusalem, the voice of the Bride and Bridegroom. The voice of joy and the Nuptial Bed is sweeter than any Feast, and Children more acceptable than the pleasing harmony of delightful Songs: then he gave the new Marry'd Couple the Cup. Jews and Japanners Marry under the blue Ca∣nopy of Heaven.The present Jews also agree with the Japanners in this Point, performing the Ceremonies of Marriage, not in their Houses, but under a Tent, that so they may renew the Promise made to Abraham concerning the multiplying of his Seed. Therefore the Bridegroom goes out with the Priests, and the Bride fol∣lows, accompany'd with Vocal and Instrumental Musick, and Acclamations of the usual Baruch-habba, that is, Blessed is he that comes. The Bride coming near the Bridegroom, runs round about him, who follows after her; then both are strowed with Wheat, thereby to express the multiplying of their Seed; where∣fore the Guests cry whilst strowing, Increase and multiply: then they suddenly turn all their Faces towards the South. The Rabbies, or Jewish Teachers bles∣sing the Bride and Bridegroom, command them to drink out of a Flask with a narrow Neck, if she be a Maid; if a Widow, out of one with a wide mouth: then he thanks God for the perfecting of the Marriage, and gives another Glass to the new Marry'd Couple to drink out of it; which done, the Bridegroom breaks the Glass to pieces against the Wall or Ground, partly thereby to re∣member the ruine of the Temple in Jerusalem, and partly to shew the vanity of all transitory things. Further relation of the Japannrs Marriage.During the time that the Japanners are thus busie in perfecting the Marriage, there is no less stir amongst their Guests below about the Hill; some sitting
near the Wayns in which the Money lies for the Brides Portion; others make a great Fire, in which they throw all the Brides Play-things; others hold a Spinning-wheel aloft, and others a Bundle of Flax. This they seem to have borrow'd from the antient Romans, who carrying the Bride in the night-time on a Wayn to the Bridegrooms House, immediately gave her Flax, that so she might instantly learn what was to be done in Houshold affairs. Lastly, the Bonzies kill'd two Siam Oxen just before the Stairs that ascend up to the Hill, and some Sheep, which they sacrifice as a burnt-offering to their Nuptial God with a Dogs-head, that thereby they may receive his Blessing. The Romans differ'd herein from the Japanners, that they worshipp'd not one peculiar Idol for Marriage, for they acknowledg'd several; so that a peculiar Deity was worshipp'd at their several Ceremonies of Marriage. The Idol Jugatinus was call'd upon when a Maid and Batchellor were betrothed to one another; Domiducus, whilst the Bride rode to the Bridegroom; Domitius, when the Bride entred the House; the Goddess Minturna, that the new Marry'd People might live long together; Virginiensis, when the Maiden Girdle was unty'd; Mutinus, when the Bride, being Chaste and Bashful, sat on a Mans Privacies made of Wood; Subigus, whilst she undrest her self; and Prema, the Goddes∣ses Mother, so soon as the Bridegroom was laid in Bed. Japan Weddings, how kept.But after the finishing the foremention'd Ceremonies, the Bride at the giving of joy to the Marriage, being put into her Coach, is carry'd to the Bridegrooms House, her Ears all the way thither delighted with Vocal and Instrumental Musick, whilst the Youths are busie in the Bridegrooms House, in hanging out of Pendants and Flags from the Roof, strowing the Floors with Flowers, and every where, within and without about the Roof, hanging of Garlands. The Wedding generally lasting eight days, costs them great sums of Money. How the Japanners Be∣troth their Children to one another.Moreover, the Japanners often betroth their Children whilst they are yet in the Cradle, which afterwards they inviolably perform. They also Marry ve∣ry young; but yet not so soon as the Muscovia Maids, which commonly enter the state of Matrimony in their tenth and eleventh Year, no otherwise than as if they were Egyptian Mice, which, as Pliny saith, come big with Young into the World. Joseph Scaliger relates, That a French Youth, aged eleven years, got his Neece of nine years old with Child. Hieronimus, that antient Father saith, That he saw a Girl that was big by a Boy scarce nine years old. Pope Gregory makes himself an eye-witness, to have seen a Girl of seven years old, to be with Child by a Youth which was but two years older. And if any doubt the truth of these famous Persons, none will question the sacred Scrip∣ture, which saith plainly, That Achaz at the end of his eleventh Year had a Son, whom he call'd Hezekiah: for Achaz was made King in his twentieth Year, Govern'd Juda sixteen years; so that he died in the thirty sixth year of his age: at which time his Son Hezekiah was five and twenty years old; which being substracted from his Fathers thirty six, there remains no more than eleven when Hezekiah was born. But besides the Nuptial God with a Dogs-head (which seems to be derived from Egypt, where there was scarce any Idol found but what had a Beasts Head; for Osiris in former times was there represented with an Ox-head; Pan, with a Bucks; Ammon, with a Rams; and Anubis, with a Dogs;) the Japanners also like the Chineses worship the Goddess Pussa, who is ador'd not onely for to
increase the Generations of Mankind, but also gives helps to Beasts, Plants, and Tres.. Description of the Japan Goddess Pussa.The Bonzi relate this Story concerning the Goddess Pussa: Ten Ages ago three celestial Virgins nam'd Angela, Changela, and Fecula, descended from Heaven to bathe themselves in a pleasant Stream; who whilst they washed in the Brook spi'd a Tree, under whose Leaves, being longer and sharper than those of a Holm-Tree, hung a black Fruit upon long Stalks; which Fecula tast∣ing, found so exceeding pleasant, that she could not be satisfi'd with eating. The like Story Homer relates of three Sea-men belonging to Ulysses's Fleet, which going ashore where the Lotus grew, would not return, they being so much delighted with the tast of that Fruit. Several Operations are ascribed to this Plant, as being good against the fall∣ing of the Hair, the Bloody-Flux, Womens monethly Disease, Falling-sickness, and giddiness in the Head, as Dioscorides, Theophrastus, Pliny, and Galen have it. But Fecula, say the Japanners, finding her self with Child by eating that Fruit, saw with sorrowful Eyes her two Companions, Angela and Changela, ascend again to Heaven, whereas she was forc'd to stay till she was Deliver'd: after nine Moneths she had a Son, who when he was wean'd she laid on a small Isle, commanding him to watch for a Fisher-man, who would bring him up, whilst she ascended to Heaven; from whence she sometime since descended with Angela and Changela. No sooner had she spoke these words, and took her Journey towards Heaven, but a Fisher-man found the Youth, and carry'd him to his House; where he grew up in such a manner, that at last he Govern'd all the Countrey far and near, and gave Laws to several Kingdoms. After this accident Fecula receiv'd the Name of Pussa, which the Japanners worship in the following manner: Worshipping of Pussa, after what manner.On the shore of a River stand thick Posts, made of the conjoyn'd Bodies of the Lotus Tree; on the sides whereof appear black branches, not unlike Ele∣phants Teeth; the Posts are adorn'd with great Gilded Flowers. On the left-side
lies a flat Shell, on two thick Branches, in which Shell Pussa's Son kneel∣ing, represents the Posture of Praying. On the top of the Branches lies sloap∣ing a Cushion, on one end whereof stands a Flower-pot, on the other a crook∣ed Branch juts out: In the middle sits Pussa, but is onely seen from the Waste upward; her Face representing that of a most beautiful Woman, surrounded with darting Sun-beams: Under a Cloth that hangs before her Breast appear sixteen Arms, whereby they express, That China and Japan have been happily govern'd sixteen Ages by this their Goddess Pussa. Their Worship to this Dei∣ty is thus perform'd: Two Japanners stand up to the middle in Water, just be∣fore the conjoyn'd Bodies of the Trees on which Pussa sits; whilst a Boat made fast a little from the Shore, hath a Ram-Goat hanging over her Prow; to Sa∣crifice which, a Bonzi stands ready in the middle of the Boat, before a Table, attended by two Servants, with a Hanger in his Hand. ¶ BUt to return again to our Embassador Wagenaer, who staying in Osacca, was amongst others visited by two Brothers Merchants, from Saccai, who told him, that about three Months thence they would send four Vessels laden with Copper to Nangesaque: Wagenaer reply'd, That they should be wel∣come; but the East-India Company would not buy their Copper so dear this Year, as they had done the last: Whereat they looking one upon another, laugh'd scornfully. Wagenaer arrives at Jedo.Wagenaer proceeding in his Journey, came the sixteenth of February to Jedo, and first made his coming known to Sicungodonne, and Joffiesamma the Governor of Nangesaque, with Intreaties of a quick Dispatch to deliver the Presents to the Emperor. Sicungodonne and Joffiesamma return'd him for Answer, That he should on the fifteenth of Songats (which is the Japanners New-year, the which fifteenth agrees with our twenty seventh of February) appear before the Empe∣ror. Soon after, Sicungodonne sent not onely for the Inventory of the Presents, but the Presents also, and lock'd them up in his Store-house, built against all Casualties of Fire. Appears before the Em∣peror.The Ambassador Wagenaer being carried to the Imperial Castle at the ap∣pointed time, waited in a Hall above two Hours, when afterwards he was brought before the Emperor, who sat on a high Throne, in a very splendid manner, to whom he proffer'd the Presents, in which his Imperial Majesty took great delight, and chiefly to see the Dutch Pistols, a Sword, and a curious Flower'd Box: The costly Alcatif was little regarded, because the often un∣packing had spoil'd and made it full of Holes. Presents to the Japan Council.The next day Wagenaer deliver'd the other Presents to the three Chief Coun∣cellors; the fourth, Kannicfaesamma, being over-grown in Years, had quitted his Office, so that he receiv'd no Presents: But the rest of the Nobility re∣ceiv'd their part of the Presents, according to the usual Custom; all accepting them very courteously by their Stewards. What the Presents and Journey amount to.These Presents amounted to above fourteen thousand three hundred Guil∣ders. The Charges of the Journey were much greater; for it cost for Hor∣ses, Guards, Interpreters, and Expences in Inns, and for other Conveniences, almost sixteen thousand Guilders. The remaining Goods Wagenaer sold for three thousand Tail, every Tail being an English Crown. The Japan Nobility buying these Goods, paid much less than they cost: And none was more sa∣tisfied than Sicungodonne, saying, He had never seen such choice Goods. It was always his Custom to invite and entertain the Holland Ambassadors

in his Garden not far from Jedo; but by reason of the excessive Cold, he in∣vited Wagenaer to a Feast in his Palace, which whilst it was preparing, Sicun∣godonne sat down next to Wagenaer, near a Window, before a great Cole-fire, and inquir'd of the Chyrurgeon Hans Hunko about the preparing of the Euro∣pean Medicines which he had brought for him. ¶ IT was at this time, the second of March, Anno 1657, when on a sudden all Jedo was in confus'd hurry, every one crying Fire: And soon after they saw from Sicungodonne's Palace, toward the North end of the City, a ter∣rible Flame rising towards the Sky, which by strong North Winds was driven directly into the City, the Sparks flying over Jedo:Sicungodonne goes cut to give order about the Fire. At which Sicungodonne ex∣cus'd himself, that he could no longer enjoy the Ambassadors Presence, it being his Office in such a Calamity to order all things requisite to restrain its inlarging: Yet he sent his three Secretaries to entertain Wagenaer in his ab∣sence; but he desir'd leave to depart, that he might see how his Affairs stood in the Hollanders Inn, which was granted him; and mounting his Horse, he posted home; for the Fire, though it was near a League from him, yet he saw it come on like a Sea, which impetuously breaking in,A great Calamity in Jedo. overflows both Fields and Banks: Wherefore he gave warning to all those where he pass'd by. Wagenaers Transactions in his Inn.But coming at last to his Inn, he found the Merchant Assistant Cornelius Mulock, and the Japan Servants, busie packing up the Papers in Chests that lay on the Table, and also the remaining Presents, their Plate, Clothes, and Let∣ters, to secure them in the Scone Store-houses built against Fire, by the Japan∣ners call'd Goddon. Every one rested, when they heard that the Wind was turn'd, and that there was no danger of the Dutch Inn, so that the Japan Ser∣vants forbore carrying away the Goods: But between four and five a clock, the Street in which the Hollanders Inn stood swarm'd with People, and little Wains, in which they carried their young Children and aged People: Where∣upon Wagenaer himself got on the top of the House, and saw plainly, that the Fire, as far as he could discern, was spread more and more, and was also dri∣ven towards them by a strong North Wind: He ask'd therefore their Land∣lord Ginnemon, Whether he thought it best to carry the Goods of the East-India Company and secure them in the Goddon, or else to Joffiesamma. Ginnemon judg'd the Goddon to be sufficient, having not long since endur'd a great Fire: And here already a great part of the Goods lay; but the Bonjoises judg'd it fit to carry the Cabinet with the East-India Companies Money, to Joffiesamma Governor of Nangesaque; and that which was in the Goddon should remain there, because the Doors and Windows were already plaister'd up with Clay, and all things that were too near the Goddon pull'd down: Yet Wagenaer would rather have carried them out of the Goddon; but whilst he disputed with Gin∣nemon, the Flame laid hold on the Verver Street, which was but a Musquet∣shot from the Hollanders Inn; it was therefore time to fly for safety. Ginne∣mon sending his Mother, Wife, and Children before, who amongst a great Crowd of People got out of the Street. The Ambassador Wagenaer, Ginne∣mon, and the rest belonging to the Ambassador, also forsook their Inn, which since the last Fire was not quite finish'd; and getting out of Doors, they found themselves in great danger; for the Streets being full every where with Wains,Wagenaer and his Reti∣nue are in great danger to be burnt. Chests, Trunks, Houshold-goods, and People thronging between them, that they were not able to pass either one way or other. Here they lay heap'd, being tumbled one upon the other; there they were squeez'd betwixt the
Goods; yonder with a hideous Cry they throng'd their way through; some being trodden to death, some their Breath squeez'd out of their Bodies, and others crawling over all. Mean while the Fire approach'd, the Sparks and Smoak whereof was rea∣dy to choak them: Nay, the Smoke so darkned the City, that the Afternoon seem'd rather to be midnight; onely now and then the Sun pierc'd through the thick ascending Cloud, and the Night seem'd to come on six Hours too soon. None could have known whether to have fled, had not the Flame lighted them: And the horrible Cry of those that were in danger, calling to others that were somewhat safer, to fly further, enough to deafen the Hearing, Wagenaer and his Retinue found themselves straitned on all sides: Before them the Street was fill'd with Goods and Men, that lay heap'd one upon ano∣ther: On one side the Flame had pass'd them; on the other, it went some∣what farther from them; behind the Fire pursu'd them very closely, whilst they stood in a thick Smoke, full of innumerable Sparks, which were driven by the North Wind like Flakes of Snow: The Fronts of Houses sometimes tumbling forwards into the Street, so covering in a glowing Grave both Men and Goods, which by reason of the Throng could not get away. Sometimes falling sidelong or inwards, they seem'd to cover the Flame, so as at present to keep it from seeking any farther Food: Here crack'd the Wainscots and Partitions, which suddenly taking Fire, hastned the ruine of the Floors and Walls. The Roofs cover'd with little Wooden Shingles, generally took Fire first; unless sometimes one House burning set fire of another, either about the middle, or the bottom. There the Timber and whole Stories tumbled down; yonder great Splinters of burning Wood flew into the Streets; in another place the Roofs fell through into their Cellars; elsewhere the Ground was shaken by falling Towers. These kind of Falls, and several Blows, would have been more distinctly heard, had not the miserable Cry of Young and Old, or those that lay scorching in the Flames, or fear'd being burnt, dead∣ned the sound thereof. It may easily be guess'd in what an exigence of danger the Holland Ambassa∣dor was with his Retinue; which they perceiving, at last strove to save them∣selves, by helping one another over the Heaps of Goods and Lumber: So stepping over Men, Chests, and all things that lay in their way, to get farther and farther out of the Press; and breaking through Fences, Pales, and Walls: In which Work had not the Bonjoisen and the Interpreters been great Assistants to them, none of the Hollanders had escap'd with Life from the Fire. At last getting into an open place, not without extraordinary danger, they went to seek for shelter against the cold Night. They judg'd it convenient to go to Joffiesamma his Palace; but the Way thither being exceedingly crowded, the Ambassador Wagenaer went to the Lord of Firando's House, being not far di∣stant from them.Wagenaer can sind no Lodging. Their Request of Lodging there was modestly denied, notwithstanding the said Lord was indebted a considerable Sum to the East-India Company, which had not yet been demanded of him. After this, Wa∣genaer went to four places more, but could not be admitted: So that walk∣ing most part of the Night to and again in Jedo, he got at last Westward out of the City,Gts out of Jedo into a Hut. near the River, where he knock'd at the Hut of a poor Rustick, who gave him leave to come in; but found neither Fire nor Candle. Mean while it froze exceeding hard; and soon after several that were fled from the Fire came also thither, and inform'd Wagenaer, that half an Hour after his depar∣ture, the Hollanders Inn was laid in Ashes.
The next day views the Fire.At day-break Wagenaer went again into the City, where he found all the South part of Jedo lying in Ashes, and the Fire raging with more fierceness than the day before; the Flame about Noon taking hold of the Emperors Castle: Here the great Gates were burnt from the Hinges; Half the Watch-houses tumbling into the Moats, were there quench'd, and the remaining part thereof became Fewel for the Fire. About the Evening the Imperial Palace also began to kindle: The Flame never appear'd more terrible,The Palace is burnt. than when it blazed out of the high Turrets; for it seem'd to threaten the Sky. This Spoil went on so ragingly, that the Emperor and his Council had scarce time to secure themselves in the Play-houses built on the North side of the Castle. In two days time the Imperial City lay all in Ashes, above a hundred thousand Houses being burnt to the Ground. Wagenaer searches for his melted Silver.The fourth of March, Wagenaer requested of the chief Bonjois, that he would be pleas'd to order some of the Soldiers that attended the Embassy, to search if they could find any Silver under the burnt Goddon. The Bonjois approving of it, provided him Men, with which Wagenaer and Verschuren went to the place where the Hollanders Inn stood. Approaching the City, of which nothing remain'd but the Eastern and Western Suburbs, he saw, with admira∣tion, as far as possible he could discern, a great Plain, smoaking in several Pla∣ces, where two days before had stood a little World of Houses; the Ground heap'd with whole and half-burnt Timber, and abundance of Ashes, accord∣ing as the Building had been greater or lesser: All the Ways, far and near, miserable to behold, which but a little before were adorn'd with Habitations for above a Million of Souls, stately Palaces, fair Towers, sumptuous Tem∣ples, and the Imperial Castle, no ways inferior to all Amsterdam: Now nought but a bare Wall surrounded the Plain, whereon Jedo the Metropolis of Japan stood but eight and forty Hours before. The Ambassador could scarce go ten Paces, but he saw several strange de∣form'd Bodies, of which some had been squeez'd flat under the Timber of Houses, some stifled in the Smoke, and others had their Limbs burnt off; and not a few were so strangely handled by the Flames, that it was impossible to know them by what Limbs they had left. In some places they lay three or four one upon another, being either crowded to death, smother'd, scorch'd, or burnt. In the Street along which they pass'd to the Hollanders Inn, the Ambas∣sador Wagenaer told above three thousand dead Corps. At one of the outmost Points of Jedo, lies a corner of the City, that is se∣parated from the other by strong Walls and great Gates: Thither a great number fled, thinking they should there be safe; wherefore those within lock'd the Gates: But it was not long before the Flame took hold of those Houses that stood along the Walls, so that in that small place above eight hundred were destroy'd, besides the Emperors Prisoners that were carried thi∣ther. The Japanners reckon'd the number of those that died by that Calamity,Above a hundred thou∣sand People burnt. to be above a hundred thousand. Wagenaer, accompanied with twenty Bonjoises, Verschuren, and Ginnemon, whose House within three Years had been twice burnt, came to the ruin'd Goddon, that there they might if possible dig up some of their Plate; but so soon as the Ashes were stirr'd, it made such a Smoke and Heat, that they could not proceed any farther: Wherefore they return'd with no success; yet they left a Watch there. Wagenaer lost in the said Goddon six thousand six hundred forty three Guilders,
in ready Money, which was lock'd in a Cabinet, besides a great deal of Plate for his Table,Wagenaer sav'd some Goods. and that which remain'd of the Presents; yet most of the Trea∣sure was sav'd; for Wagenaer, upon the advice of the Bonjoises, trusted not the same in the Store-house; but putting most of the ready Money into a Trunk, sent it to Joffiesamma, though not without danger: Wagenaer's People having much ado to get through the Crowd, and afterwards sought all Night through the City for their Lord, being troubled for him, and their rich Burthen. Mean while not one of all the Ambassadors Retinue came to any mischief, but onely his Japan Cook Siobe, which sometimes serv'd him for his Interpreter, who being hemm'd in by a broken Wall, Was there smother'd to death, and when found, was decently buried. The burning of Troy, Rome, and London, not to be compar'd to Jedo.¶ WHo will now compare the Destruction of Troy with Jedo, though one of Virgil's Master-pieces to describe? Or Rome, suppos'd to be fir'd by Nero, which Suetonius relates rag'd six Days and seven Nights? But a Stone yet to be seen near St. Peter's Church in Rome, hath an Inscription, which signi∣fies, that it burnt nine Days? Or the deplorable Fire of London, which made so miserable a Devastation, in few Days the whole City within the Walls swallow'd up in a Deluge of Fire, in which perish'd so many thousand Hou∣ses, and almost a hundred Churches, amongst which, St. Pauls, the stateliest Cathedral in the World? But yet, if we consider, this was nothing to the burning of Jedo, where there were an hundred thousand Houses burnt, besides above as many Inhabitants, and an infinite number of Palaces and Temples: So sudden and over-spreading was that dreadful Conflagration. ¶ MOreover, the Ambassador Wagenaer and his Retinue, by Joffiesamma's Order, were Lodg'd in a more convenient House than where they shelter'd themselves the first Night after the Fire, from the Cold: Yet he suf∣fer'd not a little; for whilst his European and Indian Provisions and Necessaries were burnt, he was forc'd to buy all things at a dear Rate; and indeed he was in danger of his Life;Wagenaer is in danger of his life in Jedo. for the Multitudes being almost starv'd, rang'd up and down like hungry Wolves, by thousands in Companies, with their Wives and Children, lying under the cold Canopy of Heaven. His Landlord Ginnemon was very earnest, though he had been presented with a Piece of black Stammel and Cloth-Serge, which he preserv'd from the Fire, that he might keep the melted Silver, Copper, and Lead that should be digg'd out of the ruin'd Goddon: The Bonjoises, Interpreters, and Joffiesamma, were not backward in interceding for him; wherefore Wagenaer was necessitated, though he had great need thereof himself, to give the digg'd up Metal to Ginnemon. ¶ BEfore Wagenaer went from Nangesaque, his Interpreter Fatsiseymon un∣dertook to desire of Sicungodonne to grant longer time for the Ships that Sail'd from Nangesaque to Batavia, that they might not be hastned so upon their going away, which was to their great damage; or at least, that their Hatches might be lest unseal'd. Gunemon, Sicungodonne's Interpreter, took also upon him to entreat the same of his Lord but he going to secure his Mother from the Fire, was burnt with her. Moreover, Fatsiseymon durst not venture to speak about the prolonging of time, because of this great Calamity that had lately hapned.
Japan Nobility go away without paying WagenaerIn the interim, all things were lost; for those Persons of Quality that had the Goods that remain'd or Wagenaer's Presents, were spread up and down in the Countrey, none having paid him a Penny, but Ando Ockiosamma, and Mito∣samma; and he could not see any way to find his Creditors, whilst he was in danger of his Life amongst a company of hungry People: Wherefore he humbly besought Sicungodonne, that he might have leave to depart. The Em∣peror granted this his Request; yet told him by his Council, It was conve∣nienter to stay somewhat longer, at least ten days, because the Ways were very dangerous, the People that were burnt out ranging all over the Countrey, and making Prey of whatever they found; and also because the Emperor would furnish him with Rice and other Provisions for fifty Men. The next day Wa∣genaer receiv'd, by Order of his Majesty, six Bags of Rice, which the Bonjoises took as a Heavenly Gift, and for so great an Honor, as the Emperors had ne∣ver shewn to any Ambassador in the World: So that they concluded, That the Hollanders, above all other Nations, were in great favor at Court. But Wagenaer was left solely at his own choice, either to go, or stay; and whilst he was doubtful of both, he at last resolv'd to be gone to Nangesaque, because Joffiesamma, which had shewn him very great Favors, urg'd him to be gone, saying, The ways were not so dangerous as it was reported: And what need you fear, since the Holland Ambassador goes not without Bonjoises, which Guard conducts you in the Emperors Name; therefore what Man dares do do you harm, being under their Protection? Joffiesamma added moreover, The Return (said he) for your Presents, and Payment for the Goods sold, I will keep for you, when they are paid, and deliver you them at Nangesaque. Wagenaer travels out of Jedo.Upon this Promise and Advice, Wagenaer set forward on his Journey the ninth of March, and found great trouble to get out of Jedo; for the Bridges were every where burnt, onely in some places part of an Arch appear'd above the Water; yet he could scarce get over any where; therefore they judg'd it convenient to find a Way through the Emperors Castle,Through the burnt Castle. where the Ambassador saw all thing ruin'd, the Stones in great Flakes flown asunder, the high Tow∣ers levell'd with the Ground, the Sentinel-houses in Ashes; but the Marble Bridge over the first Moat was not so spoil'd, but that they might go over it. Little less than an Hour was Wagenaer riding through the Castle, before he could get out on the other side; but having gotten thus far, he rode round about the East side of Jedo, and at last came into the right Road. The Journey prov'd better than the Councellors foretold; for he got on the seven and twentieth of March, without any hinderance, to Meaco, where he was presented by the great Judge, Makino Sandosamma, with five Japan Coats of Silk, and ten Boats of Silver. The next day getting to Osacca, he took Shipping there, and on the seventh of April arriv'd safe at Nangesaque,Arrives at Nangesaque. and also found all things in good condition on the Island Disma. ¶ BUt not long after there arose no small Inconveniences, occasion'd by three Reasons. The Hollanders are at va∣riance with the Japanners about the Chineses, and a Fly-boat. First, The Japanners that liv'd in Nangesaque took a great dislike against the Hollanders, on this occasion. Frederick Coyet, Governor in Formosa, sent a Ship call'd the Red Fox, under the Command of a Merchant nam'd Daniel Six, to Tamsuy and Quelang, for Coals and Buff-Skins; which Ship sailing again from Quelang to Tayovan, was by a Westerly Wind and strong Current drove to the Northward, so that they could neither reach Quelang nor Tayovan, but were a
long time toss'd up and down in the Bay of Arima; till at last their Provisi∣ons beginning to grow very scant, the Captain was forc'd to make a Vertue of Necessity, and ply it up to Nangesaque. The arrival of this Ship out of the Season, occasion'd strange Thoughts in Quienmonsamma Governor of Nange∣saque, who was not satisfi'd with his making strict inquiry after Six his Voy∣age, though he was to answer and give an account, When he set Sail from Tay∣ovan? When he arriv'd at Tamsuy and Quelang? What Trade he drove in those Places? How far distant Tamsuy and Quelang lay asunder? At what time, and from whom the Hollanders took Quelang? With how many Soldiers the Garri∣son was Mann'd? What Profit the Adjacent Countrey brought? What Peo∣ple inhabited it, White or Sallow, Valiant or Cowardly? These Questions ask'd by Quienmonsamma, and answer'd by Six, were written down, and sent to Jedo: After which, no farther Inquiry was made about it; but Six had free liberty as others, to sell his Coals and Buff-Skins. Second Reason of the Japanners dislike.To this first, hapned a second Occasion, thus: A Chinese Jonk sailing from Cambodia to Japan, met near Tayovan with the Ketch Domburg from Batavia, who took several Pounds of Wax out of the Jonk, which the Men belonging to it reported at Nangesaque, to the great disgrace of the Hollanders, that it was done by force, and that they were Pyrats: So that it little avail'd what the Holland∣ers said for their Defence, That Hans Parys and Poynts, the Commander and Merchant of the Ship Domburg, were secur'd in Prison by Peter Coyet, to suffer condign Punishment, after Examination of the Crime. The third.The third Reason, being the chiefest, was occasion'd thus: The Pink Breu∣kelen took not long after a Chinese Jonk betwixt the Islands Aur and Candor, and put in the Ship Urk eleven Chinese Prisoners, three Pieces of Scarlet Cloth, eight Hangers, sixteen Barrels of Tin, and, besides some Trifles, four small Brass Guns. Urk being by a strong Current driven past Tayo, fell upon the Japan Coast before Satsuma, there Cruising to and again, till at last the Lord of that place sent a small Japan Vessel with a Pennon, call'd Faisena, which conducted the Ship Urk to Nangesaque; where dropping Anchor, the Governor caus'd the Chinese Prisoners,Japanners deal strangely with the Ship Ʋrk. and also seven and twenty, as well Commanders as Sea∣men, to be fetch'd from aboard, and brought ashore, which he deliver'd into Wagenaer's Hands,The common Japanners are against the Hollanders. he being bound for them all. Mean while, the Common People mutinying, threw Stones against the Doors and Windows of the House in which the Hollanders were, crying, There lies the Hollanders thieving Ship, which comes vaporing here with her stoln Goods: The same Design had the Red Fox; but because it did not take, she under a pretence brought Coals hither to sell. Moreover, they told what a cruel Death those Pyrats deserv'd. But the Go∣vernor quieting them, sent the Interpreters to and again with Questions writ∣ten down to the twenty seven Hollanders, whose Answers on every Particular being also set down, were sent to Jedo. Then the Chinese Goods which they had taken were also fetch'd from aboard, at which the People in Nangesaque cried, Fie, Dutch Pyrats: What Death is cruel enough for such Offendor? And though the Chineses gave Wagenaer a Receipt, that they had receiv'd satisfaction for all the Goods which Urk had taken out of Breukelen, yet they came again some days after, and complain'd that they wanted more Goods: Against which, it avail'd not that Wagenaer shew'd them their Receipt: Wherefore the Magistrates of Nangesaque gave order, That the Ship Urk should be search'd a second time, for the Goods which the Chineses requir'd.
Chineses fetch their Goods out of the Ship ƲikThe eighteenth of October they went to work: The Chinese Interpreter Ki∣oube, and also the Netherland Interpreters, going aboard the Ship Urk, caus'd Packs and Chests to be open'd, in the presence of the Merchant Meindert Janson Mestecker. They search'd all things very narrowly, till at last they found in the Sea-mens Chests six and twenty little Bales of Cotton, two Bales of Tee, two fine Mats, a Copper Bason, four Chinese Coats; two pair of Breeches, as many Stockins, a Girdle, a Silk Cushion, a Hair Net for the Head, and a red Silk Sute. The Searchers, as Trophies of their Victory, went ashore with the foremention'd Goods, where thousands of Japanners and Chineses waited for their return; they holding them aloft, carried them amongst a great Crowd of People to the Governors, who a considerable time look'd upon them, and at last gave them again to the Chineses. Wagenaer's Excuse is not taken.Wagenaer endeavor'd in vain to excuse the Deed, by telling them of the in∣nocency of the Indian Consul at Batavia, who severely punish'd Pyracy: But the Magistrates took not this his Testimony, thinking, that if it had hapned only once, it might have been excus'd; but since so many Complaints of the robb'd Jonks were brought in daily, it could not be otherwise, but that the Holland Ships had order at Batavia for the performing such Pyracy; or at least, the Indian Consul wink'd at it. But Wagenaer afterwards bringing this News to Batavia, the Consul look'd upon it to be nothing else but the insufferable peevish disposition of the Japan∣ners, which appear'd sufficiently,Japanners set the Chine∣ses against the Hollanders. because Saujoe the Owner of the Jonk made not so much ado as they, which were no ways concern'd with it; and the more, because the Jonk was not coming to Japan, but going to China. And since the Chineses found such Interceders of the Japanners, they thought themselves incou∣rag'd by them to bring all manner of false Complaints against the Hollanders. Wagenaers Proposal con∣cerning the Japanners seve∣rity.Wagenaer also propos'd to them, That by a Letter he would inform the Ma∣gistrates of Japan, that the Hollanders would rather part from them in Friend∣ship, and remove their Staple from thence, than endure the Complaints of the Chineses, who every time they came, had Audience granted them for the false Reports and Tales they told of them. Or else, to prevent farther trou∣ble, it would be convenient to give strict order to all Ships, That they should let all Jonks, either Coxenga's or Tartarians, pass in quietness. Mean while, some experienc'd in State-Affairs judg'd, that if the Japanners ob∣serv'd, that the Hollanders were in earnest to remove from thence, they would then be better natur'd; for they would not only miss the Netherland Presents, and their great Trade; but also that of the Chineses, whose Traffick would be spoil'd by the Pyrats that should be sent from Formosa and Batavia: And Japan also might fear, that the Hollanders joyning with the English, Portuguese, and Spaniards, would do no small mischief to that Empire. ¶ WHilst this Controversie was at the highest, between the Hollanders and the Chineses, the second Governor of Nangesaque, Joffiesamma, came home from Jedo, the twenty second of September, and brought no more than thirty Imperial Coats, and sixty Boats of Silver, from three of the Council, which indeed was but a small Return for the Netherland Presents. Moreover, there was not one Penny receiv'd of all the Debts due from the Nobles at Jedo, nor any News from Sicungodonne.
Remarkable Discourse betwixt Kiemonsamma and Wagenaer.¶ AFter that, there hapned a remarkable Treaty between Kiemonsamma and Wagenaer, which proceeded from this occasion: A Japanner call'd Bozy∣mon had written from Batavia, That many died daily there of Hunger, wanting Provisions, because those of Bantam, being at Wars with the Holland∣ers, prevent any Relief from coming to them; and also, That the Condition of the East-India Company in Canton was but very mean. This Letter was given to Kiemonsamma; who thereupon sent for Wagenaer to come to him, that from his mouth he might receive better Information concerning that business, asking him, From what occasion the War arose between Bantam and Batavia? What hopes they had of Peace? What space of Ground was between the two fore∣mention'd Places? Wagenaer replied, That as for the Famine, War with Bata∣via, nor the Affairs of Canton, he had not the least Advice; which not being mention'd in his Letters from Batavia, he look'd upon it to be onely a rais'd Report. Moreover, Bantam lay about nine Leagues from Batavia. Kiemonsamma ask'd again; Why do there come so many Frigats of War to Nangesaque, whereas heretofore none but Flyboats came to an Anchor there? The Emperors Order was to take the Rudder from all Dutch Ships, so soon as they came before Nangesaque; which could not be done to the great Ships, without cutting a hole in the Cabbin; to prevent which inconvenience, he had permitted that they should keep them on; but hereafter they would do so no more, but follow his Order. Wagenaer replied, That most of their Flyboats were gone, so that they were forc'd to take what Ships they could get. Netherland Interpreters.¶ SHortly after this, the Magistrates of Nangesaque made some alteration amongst their Interpreters on Disma; for dismissing the old Kitsobe of his Imployment, they gave the Place to his Son Sinkits, who spake good Portu∣guese, for Chief Interpreter; to whom they gave for an Assistant one Firandees Josseyemon, otherwise call'd Brasman, reasonably well experienc'd in the Dutch Tongue. These to be paid by the Ottena, that is, Overseer of the East-India Companies Store-house, who besides fed with no meaner Diet than Quails the Interpreters Mangale, Scheseymon, Fatsimon, Sitsibe Nisfyoye, and Josseyemon, with out whom no Business can be done, for their Voyces must be in it. The Emperor sends for two Globes.¶ MEan while, News came from Jedo, That Sicungodonne demanded for the Emperor a Globe and Sphere, the former being burnt in the late Fire, with all the other Presents. He thought also to get great esteem with the Engine; wherefore he commanded strictly, that none should see it, but that it should be sent with all speed to Jedo: But the Magistrates of Nangesaque little regarding Sicungodonne's Commands, shew'd it daily to Persons of Quality, who, to try it, play'd Water out of the same. The Emperors Sentence concerning the Ship Ʋrk.With this Advice, came other Orders from the Emperor, concerning the Ship Urk, out of which the Chineses took their Goods. The Orders being these, were read to Wagenaer and Bouchelyon in Joffiesamma's Hall: The Frigot Urk shall with the other Ships go for Batavia; the eleven Chinese Prisoners in a Jonk to China: The Goods and Jonk taken by the Ship Breukelen must be re∣stor'd to the Owner. If the Hollanders at any time hereafter plunder any more Jonks that are coming to Japan, they shall for ever be banish'd from the Empire. Moreover, Wagenaer, whom Bouchelyon was to succeed in his
place, and was ready to go for Batavia, should make the Japan Emperor's Edicts, read to them, known to Coyet Governor of Fermosa. Strange Request of Todo.¶ BUt a little before Wagenaer's departure, Todotaychosama, a mighty Lord of that Countrey came and proffer'd a great Sum of Money for an Ostritch, which was brought thither from Batavia with the last Ships; but the Magi∣strates of Nangesaque forbad the selling of it, judging it convenient to send this strange Bird to the Emperor for a Present, which indeed did not please Bouche∣lyon, because of the great Expences and Charge which the Carriage of them thi∣ther amounts to. Lastly, Todo desir'd by the Interpreters, to have six Turkies, some Singing Birds, two white Harts, as many Apes, and one Pair of the least flying Crocodiles: He received for answer; that care should be taken to en∣quire for them in all places. ¶ THe Interpreter Scheseymon brought also Tidings,Ambergreece.That the Lord of Sat∣suma had a Piece of Ambergreece that weigh'd a hundred and thirty Pounds, which he valued at fourteen thousand Tail. Moreover, the Japanners also at several times brought small pieces of Ambergreece to sell in their Hand∣kerchiefs. Its Original.Concerning the Original of this Amber are several Opinions, for some think, that it is either the Spawn or Dung of a Whale; others look upon it to be a Spungy Earth that grows in the Sea under the Rocks, by the beating Waves wash'd off in Pieces, which by reason of their lightness, Swim above the Water. But those that seem to come nearest the truth, as the Learned Ber∣nard Paludanus judgeth, approving of Linschot's Opinion, hold Amber to be a sort of Pitch, arising up from the Ground, and hardned by the Sun, and is found not unlike Brimstone or Coral: But its Original from a Whale hath not the least appearance of truth; for if Amber should proceed from the Spawn or Dung of a Whale, it would needs be found most in those places where the greatest number of Whales frequent: But it is known to the contrary, that Green-Land, Spitsbergen, or elsewhere, where these Sea-Monsters abound, never produce any Amber; whereas on the contrary, Soffala, Mosambique, Melinde, the Maldivian Islands, the Promontory of Comoryn, the Province of Satsuma in Ja∣pan, and other Indian Countreys, produce Amber, before whose Coasts seldom or never any Whales are seen to Swim. Which is the best Amber.The best Amber is Grey, with White Veins, wherefore it is call'd Amber∣greece; that which is Black yields not the Price of the Grey; the best is known when Try'd, by putting a small Stick into it, upon which it yields much Oyl. The Indian Nobility use abundance of Amber in their Meats, to provoke Letchery. Paludanus ascribes to Amber, that with its pleasant Smell, it strengthens the Heart and Brain, takes off Watery Humors from the Stomach, cures Falling-Sickness, and Risings of the Lights; and is generally good for all Ancient and Decrepit People. Why the Japanners make but little Camphire.They were also inform'd on the Island Disma, concerning Camphire, that the Workmen of Satsuma had given over preparing of it, because of the small profit they reap'd by it, wherefore most of them were gone to dig in the Silver Mines. The Chinese. Camphire which is made in Cincheu, as also the Japan in Sat∣suma, differ much from that which Borneo produces; for one Pound of Bornean would yield sixty times as much more (by one that hath skill in Camphire) as the Japan or Chinese Camphire grows on Trees, not unlike Nut-Trees,How it is made. being
a Gum, which Swetting, drops from the main Body of the Tree: The drops are white, and distinguish'd in four sorts; The Indians use also several Sieves, so to have every sort by it self; thorow the finest falls the worst, and thorow the greatest and coursest the best; the filthiness and Dross they take from it with hot Water, Sope, and Lemon Juyce, which dry'd in a Pan becomes whiter than before: The East-India Company were to exped no more Camphire from Satsuma, because there they had given over preparing it fit for use. The making of Wax.But in making of Wax'd Merchandize the Japanners proceeded as formerly, wherein the Art of the Workmen is to be admir'd; but much more the Pis∣mires which make the Wax. The Workmen beat the Wax to Powder, and melt it, then mix with the melted Wax all manner of Colours, according as they think best; and then pour it upon long round Pieces, which Pieces they stick on Wood made hot, about a Nail thick; then Polish it over with Straw or dry Broom: After which manner they make their Chests, Tables, Boxes, and other things, which Japan and China furnish Europe with in a plentiful manner. Concerning the Original of Wax, the Antient Philosophers contest amongst themselves, and chiefly the Arabians; some think as Rasis and Serapio, That Wax falls from Heaven in Arabia on a Sorben Tree: Garcias ab Orta, That upon the Piguan Sticks lying in the Mud, which the Rivers flowing over the Countrey, and after returning to their own Limits, left behind, grow great Pismires, which produce abundance of Wax: About the Pismires, Garcias relates the truth, but the other Relation is but fancy; the Hollanders which have, and do Inspect India sufficiently, find the business thus; In Pegu, a Province which lies between Aracan, Cambodia, Ara, and China, grows a great Tree full of round Leaves, green above, and white below, of a sharp Taste, the Blossoms with∣out scent,Of what Beasts, and how strangely Wax is made. and the Fruit call'd Jujubes. This Tree in the Summer time swarms with great Wing'd Pismires, which constantly suck upon the Gum of the fore∣said Tree, by the Indians call'd Ber, and as the Bees do the Honey, they make the Wax round about the Boughs; when the Branches are fill'd therewith shining of a Red colour then they are cut off, and laid a drying; the less Wood there is within the Wax, the better it is, which being peel'd from the Sticks, detains some of the Shell or Bark thereof; the Branches are like Hasel but have a thicker Peth, and represent deep and Scollop'd Scars under the Shell; the Wax is generally mix'd with the Wings of the foresaid Pismires. Japan Councel treat con∣cerning the Hollanders Jour∣ney to Jedo.¶ MEan while, Zacharias Wagenaer made a short Voyage to Batavia, but soon after return'd again, that he might officiate a second Embassy to the Emperor of Japan; whilst he prepar'd all things for that Voyage, Anno 1656. much ado had been in a Dancon, (for so a Consultation of the Grand Councel is call'd by the Japanners) about the usual Journey from Nangesaque to Jedo; for some thought it fit, that from that time forward, the Holland Ambas∣sadors should travel thorow Bungo by Land to Cocero, and there to Ferry over to Simonisicci, so to shun the danger of the Sea, which the Hollanders endur'd the year before on the Coast of Facata. The Chief Counsellor in Sinosamma urg'd on the business, but yet durst not take upon him to give order for it; therefore it was thought fit to acquaint the Emperor, and have his Consent therein, but Joffiesamma advising to the contrary, saying, it was not fit to trouble the Empe∣ror about such trivial things; the Councel proceeded no farther with it, but let the Hollanders come their usual way by Water. Wagenaer therefore Ship'd his
De Stadt SACCAI The Citty SACCAI
Presents, and other Goods in a hired Barque, two Bengala Oxen in a smaller Ves∣sel, and set Sail the second of February from Nangesaque: Before his departure, amongst others, he gave these Orders to the Merchant Ernest of Hoogenhock, and Cornelius Mulok, that they should constantly see Divine Service perform'd every Evening, at which their smallest Youths should be present. Wagenaer's troublesome Voyage.Wagenaer toss'd by contrary Winds, and great Showers of Hail, found a no less dangerous, than long and tedious Passage by Water, being sometimes ne∣cessicated to Ride several days, one after another, at Anchor; his Barque seeming more like a Prison, than a Ship, because none could stand upright in it, but must either lie or sit; so that most of the People by that means grew very Lowsie: The Cold Weather also did them no great good, whilst their Provi∣sions grew very scant. Thus having been toss'd forty four days at Sea, he drop'd Anchor the seventeenth of March before Osacca. Description of the state∣ly Japan City Saccai.¶ HE Sail'd close by Saccai, which made a fine Prospect into the Sea. This City lying in the Kingdom of Quio, five Leagues below Osacca, is one of the stateliest Cities in all Japan: The Inhabitants exceeding most of the Ja∣pan Nobility, few but raise their Generations either to Kings or Princes: In the Civil War which sufficiently harras'd Japan, since the Deposing of the Dayro, Saccai stood in fear of none; when other Cities and Fortresses in great num∣bers were utterly ruin'd, no Conqueror whatsoever durst meddle with Saccai. On the West, the City lies towards the Sea, and is for the most part Surroun∣ded with a Moat, full of Water, except where it rises up against the Mountain, where it is secured against any Enemies Invasion whatsoever, not onely by an exceeding high Wall, rais'd from the Ground with Free-Stone, but also Forti∣fi'd with an invincible Castle, built on the highest top of the Mountain;The City of Saccai. this Castle reckons fifteen Bulwarks, to which is no passing, but by a narrow and dangerous Path. This keeps the whole City in awe, and defends the Wall which is built against the Mountain. Another Castle.On one side of this Castle stands another, in the hanging of the Mountain, yet is equal in height; for being built of Free-Stone, it rises up fifty Foot. On the other side, near the upper Castle, stands the Royal Palace, inhabited by the King of Quio, in which Province Saccai is built.The King's Palace: The Palace appears with two high Towers above the City, the biggest is nine Stories high, whereof one is lesser than the other, so that at last it ends in a Pinacle. Island Pyenes.In the Sea before the Haven, lies the Island Pyenes, which hath round about a Level Shore, generally crowded with People, because those that offer them∣selves to Canon come thither, not without great attendance of Servants, and Friends. The Bonzies of the seventh Sect walk before the Multitude, Taber∣ing on great Copper Kettles, conducting the Consecrated to Canon, to a Japan Sioen, (that is, a Barque, but built after another manner) made fast to the Shore.Japan Sioen. The Sioen hath three Masts, and as many Sails, from the Masts and Yards blow long Vains and Silk Pennons. Moreover, the Sioen is Wax'd all over, and adorn'd with Golden Imagery:How the Japanners drown themselves. The Consecrated leaping and Dancing at the noise of the Basons, at last enter the Vessel, which putting off from the Shore, hangs great Stones about his Neck, Middle, and Legs, and then to the Honor of Canon, jumps into the Sea before the Haven of Saccai, after having sat two days before speaking with the Idol, in the Portal of his Temple. This Self-Murther is not always done out of pretended Zeal, but sometimes because they are weary of Life, by reason of their Poverty or incurable Sores or Distempers.
On this Island Pyenes (of which the middle is seen at a great distance, by reason of two high Hills) is a great Temple, Dedicated to Canon, built of Stone on the hanging of the Mountains, and no ways inferior to that belong∣ing to the same Idol in Osacca. Moreover, round about the Island lie several handsome Sioens, and other small Vessels for the purpose aforesaid. Opposite to Pyenes appears a Water-Castle, built on a Promontory, being the Foot of a steep Hill, which lies at one end of Saccai. This is a most Artificial and stately Building, a large Tower of two Stories high, and flat on the top, standing in the middle of strong square Walls, towards the Mountain two great Paths direct the way, at the end of which is another Square Tower, the top cover'd with a broad Roof, that jets over the sides. By this Water-Castle no Ships must pass, before they pay Custom to the City. Haven of Saccai.Behind this Fort, the Sea makes a Bay before the City, and Washes over against the Water-Castle the Foot of a Rock; near which others are of an in∣credible height.Walls, Moreover, the Haven comes just before the Wall of the Ci∣ty, that consists of Free-Stone, rais'd out of a deep Moat full of Water, except where it rises up against the Mountain; for Saccai being built on the hanging of a great Hill, the Moat is dry half way; and although the Wall by its strength and height is a sufficient Defence of its self, yet it is Fortifi'd by the two Ca∣stles that Crown the top of the Mountain. Not far from the Walls that face the Water-Castle, is the stately Palace, inhabited by the Vice-Roy of Saccai, which having an exceeding high Turret in the middle of it, is seen at a great distance.Saccai is built of Stone. All the Buildings, both within and without Saccai, are of Stone, which the Neighboring Rocks afford them in plentiful manner. This City is kept in such good order,Strange Orders observ'd there. that neither Robberies, Dissentions, or Quarrels at any time disturb the Inhabitants; and if any Disturbance hapneth, each Street Locks up their Gates, and the causer of it taken by an Officer, is carry'd before a Magistrate, where he is sure to be severely punish'd; yet notwithstanding this strict Order in the City, every one hath liberty to decide his Quarrel with a drawn Scymiter, a Stones cast from the Wall. The great Temple of Sac∣cai full of all manner of Images.¶ BUt above all things in Saccai, is most remarkable the Temple, which ex∣ceeds all others in Japan, both in costliness and bigness; Dedicated to the strange Gods of Aracan, Pegu, Cambodia, Tayovan, Couchichina, Borneo, Philippines, Corea, China, Siam, and one terible Idol, borrow'd from the Salvage Inhabitants of Jesso. Such a Temple of all sorts of Images stood formerly in Rome, which being call'd Pantheon, was Built by Agrippa the Emperor Augustus Son-in-Law, to this day the Foundation of that Temple (which Pope Boniface the third, about the year six hundred and seven, being impower'd by the Emperor Phocas, Conse∣crated to the Virgin Mary and the Apostles) is to be seen,Temple Maria Rotunda. and call'd, Santa Maria Rotonda, and is held (as the experienc'd Artichect Sebastian Serlius relates) for the handsomest Building to be found any where, and serves as a Pattern to raise other Edifices by, notwithstanding there is not the least glance of its first Beau∣ty remaining; for being Burnt in Titus Vespasian's time, it was Re-built by Domitian, and afterwards set on Fire by Lightning in Trajan's Reign, and Erect∣ed again by the Emperor Adrian; the Roof was cover'd with Silver Tiles Gil∣ded, which the Emperor Constantine's Son took off, and carry'd with him to Sicily, where they fell into the Hands of the Saracens, that carry'd them to Egypt. In this Pantheon stood the Gods, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus; and besides other Idol-Images, those of Augustus and Agrippa.
Temples with divers gods where in former tunes.Pausanias the Greek Historiographer relates, That in Athens and in other pla∣ces of Greece also, stood a general Temple for all manner of Gods: The same is found by Zozomenus the Ecclesiastical Writer, who relates, That in the Vil∣lage Bethelia, where he was born, was a very ancient Temple, built on a Hill, that look'd over all the Village, and being Dedicated to all manner of Deities, was call'd Bethelia, agreeing with the Greek word Pantheon, both signifying, A Temple of divers Gods. Strange Image of a Queen in Saccai, borrow'd of Siam∣mers.¶ BUt besides the other several Images in the famous Temple of Saccai, the Queens Image of melted Jems, which they had from the Siammers, de∣serves no small admiration, and will be worth our labour to search after the Original thereof: When the Queen to the King of Siam dies,A remarkable Funeral of the Queen of Siam. her body is kept a whole year, wanting six days, notwithstanding it stink, and putrifie before they lay it into the ground: Then the time being come to Burn the Corps in the Market-place, they place a most Artificial and Royal Throne about three hundred Foot high, whose inside consists of exceeding thick and long Poles, pleited about with Rushes, but without surrounded with Mats and cloven Reeds, curiously Painted and Gilt; the whole Edifice shewing like one entire Piece: Round about this Throne stand several Turrets, each about a hundred and twenty Foot high, with a Gallery leading from one to the other: Just be∣fore the Throne, is a Tower three times higher than the other, saving four Portals resting within on great Pillars, curiously Engraven with Fruitage, and stand in order like our Church-Pillars; after which manner also they stand within the Throne, on whose Pillars lies a Roof six Fathom from the Ground, under which, about the middle of the Square inner-part, stands a very splendid Ascent, twelve Foot high, not onely adorn'd with Gilt Imagery, but also beau∣tifi'd with green Glass; on this the Corps is burnt. This Edifice stands about six Musquet Shot from the Palace; between both, a Way is made of Rushes Pleited, and Painted Red, which keeps off the Mul∣titudes which flock to see the Funeral in incredible numbers: Along this Fence stand little Huts, the Roofs of which rest on four Turn'd Pillars, the sides sepa∣rated by Gilded Silk Curtains, within lie Iron Pots, Rice, and yellow Cloth for Priests. Before the Corps come forth, their Players Act publickly in the Market-place, whilst several heavy Golden Balls, some great and some little, are brought thither: The Street between the Palace and the Funeral Pire is full of Sledges that stand in two Rows, on which appear strange deform'd Creatures, artificial∣ly made of Rushes; some representing the shape of Elephants, Dragons, and Tygers; others, half Men and half Beasts, Rhinocerots, every ones Back repre∣senting a Seat like a Throne, on four Square Pedistals curiously Painted, some of which Seats are fill'd with Sandal-Wood to burn the Corps: These Pleited Monsters are made fast with Ropes one to another, by which they are drawn forward through thousands of people. Out of one of the foresaid Houses along the Rail of Red Rushes, comes forth the Siam Bishop, and sets himself down on one of the artificial Tygers: Behind the Bishops, the Sons of the King of Siam get upon the back of one of the Elephants: The youngest Son rides just before the Chariot, whereon the Corps of his deceased Mother lies, his Elephant being made fast to it by Cords of fine Linnen, full of Gold Rings, at least an Inch thick. The Corps it self stands on a Throne eighteen Foot high, which rests on a Chariot six Fathom long.
Every thing represents either Art or Splendor; for the Chariot and the Throne whereon the Corps stands, is cover'd with thick Golden Plates, and adorn'd with Imagery, Inlaid with Mother of Pearl, and green glittering Glass. The Coffin sharp on the top, and standing upon one end, is of Massie Gold, Emboss'd with Rubies and Diamonds. The artificial Elephants, Tygers, Rhi∣nocerots, Dragons, and other deformed Creatures, are drawn along with the Corps by all sorts of People, but distinguish'd by their several Caps. Behind the Deceased Queen, follows the King of Siam, Riding on a She-Elephant, Cap∣parison'd in white Linnen, adorn'd with great Tassels of Gold; he that leads the Elephant, holds a Golden Hook, beset with Precious Stones; The King Appa∣rel'd in White, hath a great Hat on his Head, made fast under his Chin, the end of Which hangs over his Shoulders: Behind the King sits a prime Lord, with his Head and Body bent forward, which reaches him a Hanger of an In∣estimable value: And lastly, When the Corps with all the Riches is thrown into the Flame, after some time, the Ashes of the Queen, and the melted Gold are gather'd out of the Fire; the Ashes preserv'd in a great square Tower, Pla∣ted without with Gilt Tin; but the melted Gold serves to make an Image, representing the deceased Queen, which when made, is put into the Temple, and Religiously Worshipped;When the Siammers must be Shav'd. And after the Queen is Burnt, the Siammers may let the Hair of their Heads grow, for as long as she was yet standing on the Earth, they were necessitated to Shave their Heads every Fortnight. An exceeding strange ad∣venture that happen'd at the Funeral of the King of Si∣am's Daughter.¶ WIth such a Siam Idol the Temple in Saccai is adorn'd; but to give you a somewhat nearer Relation concerning the Original of this Inesti∣mable Image; it will be necessary to add hereunto the strange adventure that happend on the three and twentieth of February, and the following days, Anno 1649. which the Governor John Van Muiden, at that time residing in Judia, the Metropolis of Siam, as Agent for the Netherland East-India Company, being an Eye∣witness, relates thus: I was, says he, with the rest of the Netherlanders, by the Interpreters call'd to Court, to see the Splendid Funeral of the King's Daughter, Born by his Royal Queen: But because the Messengers came somewhat too late, the Corps was already carry'd to the Funeral Pire; but going thither, we got upon a Scaffold, which by the King's Order was built for us, not far from the Fire. In the middle of the Market-place in Judia, in sight of the Royal Palace, stood five Turrets rais'd of high Masts, hung round about with Gil∣ded Mats; four Towers more of the same height and shape, made an exact Quadrangle: In the middle of the four was another Erected much larger and higher; for whereas the four were but twenty Fathom high, the middlemost was thirty, all Plated with Gold, and Emboss'd with Precious Stones, Dazel∣ling the Eyes of the Beholder. Within the biggest Tower stood an exceed∣ing costly Altar, rais'd six Foot from the Ground, on which the Corps of the King's Daughter was to be Burnt, and was now brought thither, after it had been Embalm'd, and stood six Moneths in State in her Fathers Court. The Corps its self was Apparel'd in Majestick Robes, with Gold Chains, Arm-lets, Neck-Laces of Pearl, and other Precious Jems; on her Head she wore a Crown of Gold; the Body sat up-right in a Praying posture, in a Chest of Massie Gold an Inch thick; her Hands folded together, and her Face up to∣wards Heaven. Then the greatest Mandarines or Siam Lords, with their Ladies stept to the Corps, and every one shewing a very mournful Countenance,
were all Clothed in fine white Linnen, without any Gaiety,Very rematkable Fune∣ral. and Strew'd an Handful of Flowers or Perfumes on the Deceased; after which, the Golden Chest with the Corps was set on a high Throne, Erected on a stately Cha∣riot, and Presented before the chief Peers and Ladies of the Land; where∣upon the Princesses make first a doleful cry, then wringing their Hands, and Shreeking aloud, calling also several times together on the Name of the De∣ceased, shew all the Postures of a hearty sorrow. Mean while, the Cha∣riot which was drawn by the Prime Nobility, began to approach the fore∣said five Towers: Before the Corps, the King's eldest Son, the Deceased's eldest Brother Rode on an Elephant: On both sides his two second Brothers, whose Elephants were Caparison'd in White, every one having a long Scarf in their Hand, whereof one end was made fast to the Coffin, so seeming as if they drew the Body along: On both sides of the Chariot, also walk'd four∣teen of the King's Children on Foot, Clothed in fine White Linen, and a green Bough in their Hand: Just behind the Chariot follow'd all the Princes and their Princesses in great State: On both sides of the Way, through which the Chariot pass'd stood stately Scaffolds, each standing twenty Fathom from the other, on which the meaner sort of Mandarins, or Lords sate, who when the Corps came before them, threw several Suits of Clothes amongst the throng of People, and also Oranges stuck full Ticols and Masees, which is a sort of Siam Silver Coyn, the first valu'd at about two Shillings, and the last at six Pence. The concourse of People was so exceeding great, that ma∣ny were throng'd to death: But so soon as the Chariot stopp'd before the middlemost of the five Towers, the Corps was taken down by the primest Lords, and not without great Ceremony (whilst the Musicians Sung and Play'd all manner of doleful Tunes) was placed on the Altar in the fifth Tower, and surrounded with Sandal and Agor-Wood, sprinkled with the sweetest Perfumes, and best of Essenses. Princesses that must either cry or be beatn, where that Custom is us'd. Then the whole Train of the King's Children and prime Lords return'd to Court; but the Princesses stay'd two days and two nights with the Corps: where sitting round about the Altar, they may not during that time stir a foot from thence, but must cry continually without ceasing; to which every one uses her utmost endeavor, thereby to express her exceeding for∣row; for if otherwise they forget this Ceremony, they are immediately, without regard of their Quality, miserably beaten with short thick Cords by Women order'd by the King for that purpose. On one side, at some di∣stance from the five Towers stood a brave Scaffold, cover'd with thick gilded and oyl'd Paper; on which the chief Priests of Siam sat Praying for the Deceased; sometimes ceasing, they gave Alms amongst the common People, as abundance of Clothes, Pots, Pans, Beds, and other Houshold∣stuff; and also Carpenters Tools, Axes, Saws, Augers, and the like. But besides this prime Scaffold, there were several less for the ordinary Priests, whose numbers amounted to above a thousand; which were also employ'd either in Praying, or distributing of Alms amongst the People. In a spacious Place round about the five Towers stood twenty more, out of which after Sun-set, for fourteen days together, rare and artificial Fire-works were shown. The King burns his Daughters Corps.The five and twentieth of February the whole Train that attended the Fu∣neral two days before, appear'd again in a far more splendid manner. The King himself being present Rode on a young Elephant to the Altar on which
the Corps stood; where dismounting he set fire on it with a lighted Toch; which suddenly grew to that heighth, that the Flame took hold of all the five Towers, and burnt not onely his Royal Daughters dead Body, but all those Riches with which she sat in the Gold Chest, when after some hours the heat gone, and the Place grown cool, he caus'd a search to be made amongst the Coals for the Bones,Strange wonder of a piece of Bloody Flesh. Ashes, and melted Gold, himself holding a Golden Urn in his Hand, and receiving the gather'd Bones into it, when a piece of raw Flesh all bloody, which the Fire had not consum'd, was found; at which the King being exceedingly amaz'd, ask'd his Council Oja Sabartiban, which stood next to him, and help'd him to gather the Reliques that were left, what he thought concerning it? Sabartiban answer'd, Most mighty Lord, your great under∣standing easily apprehends the meaning, the business being so very apparent. The King struck with a consternation, ran immediately like a distracted Person to his Palace, saying, Now I see it plainly what I so long doubted, namely that my Daughter was poyson'd. Wherefore he suddenly seised on all the Women, not excepting any that ever Serv'd the Princess in her Life-time, and committed them all to safe Custody; nay, he took all those in his whole Dominions, that at any time convers'd with her. The eight and twentieth of February he began his scrutiny: three hundred Ladies of Honor, and other great Persons of Quality which had ever been in Company with the King's Daughter whilst she was living, were driven through a huge Fire, that (according to the Siam Law) they might be try'd, if they were guilty or not, which they knew by the Flames hurting or preserving them. This Trial was perform'd not without great Charms and Incantations; yet all of them passing safe through the Fire without receiving the least hurt, were again set at liberty. Mean while there was great suspicion, that the youngest Daughter to the former King (for the present King had in a Rebel∣lion bereav'd his Predecessor both of his Life and Crown) might have committed the Fact; because being this King's Concubine, she had sometime shew'd her self very much dissatisfi'd, because he shew'd such exceeding kind∣ness and great respects to his eldest Daughter, and regarded not hers, who also acknowledg'd him for her Father: and indeed the suspicion grew the greater when the King was inform'd, that this his Concubine was observ'd to laugh, whilst every one present at the Funeral bewail'd the death of the Deceased: For this jealousie the Princess, with a great Train of her Ladies of Honor, was forc'd also to go through the Fire, all of them passing through without be∣ing hurt, except the Princess, who was very much burnt on both her Feet: therefore she was immediately loaden with Silver Fetters, and committed to a Prison where none were suffer'd to speak with her. On the second of March she had publick Audience before all the Mandarins, or Lords; where, whether out of fear of exquisite tortures, or terrifi'd with the King's anger, she freely said, If the King will promise upon Oath, that he will immediately Execute me, and keep me no longer alive, to be a scorn and derision to the World, there will need but little trouble to find out the mystery of his Daughters death. The Mandarins which remembred the former Condition and State of this Princess, when her Father was King of Siam, were no less amaz'd at her noble courage, than inwardly prick'd with compassion to find out a means for her Deliverance; but the fear they had of the present King quenched all such motions: They reported that which she had said to his Majesty; who immediately promis'd upon Oath, that the
Princess after real confession should not live an hour to be despis'd by the World. Upon which she confessed, That not without help of her Nurse she had prepar'd a Poyson, which was so Charm'd, that one piece of his or her Flesh that took it should not be consum'd by Fire, whene're the so poyson'd should be burnt. This Compound by a mistake the King's Daughter greedily swallow'd, which thus prepar'd was intended for her Father, that the death of so bloody a Tyrant, (who like a Villain treache∣rously took the Scepter out of my Fathers Hand, that was lawful King of Siam, and oppress'd the true Royal Family) might satisfie my Revenge for my Fathers Death, and to deliver those of Royal Blood from insupportable slavery. No sooner was this Relation of hers carry'd to the King, but he caused a great piece of Flesh to be cut out of the Princesses Side, which he forc'd her with great threatnings to eat up; and whilst she was swallowing the last Bit, some of his Executioners, appointed for that purpose, fell upon her with drawn Swords, and left not off till they had chopp'd her into a thou∣sand pieces, which they afterwards threw into the River Judia. Not long after the Princesses Brother, Son to the depos'd King of Siam, was also Executed, he being in the former Insurrection spar'd alive, because he was suppos'd to be frantick; but at his Death appear'd the contrary, he also subtily contriving with his Sisters to destroy the King, and make himself Master of the Crown; and had not the Business been untimely betray'd, he had no small hopes to repossess his Fathers lost Kingdoms. Strange Image in Siam.When the fore-mention'd Funeral Ceremonies were ended, the King caus'd an Image to be made, on which he bestow'd not onely all the melted Gold in the middle Tower, but also all the Presents (amounting to several Tun of Gold) which the King's Daughter had receiv'd from the Mandarins. This Image, representing the Deceased, was placed in the chiefest Temple to be worshipp'd; and such a kind of Image stands in the great Temple in Saccai. Wagenaer's farther Jour∣ney to Jedo.¶ WAgenaer having Sail'd past Saccai, came on the seventeenth of March to Osacca, where he found Provision exceeding dear and scarce, occasi∣on'd by a great Storm which had spoil'd all the Corn about the Courttrey; so that the Carriage of Goods on Pack-horses, amounted to much more than at other times. Wagenaer presented the Governor Faitosamona and Tambesamma, who furnish'd him with thirty Men to carry the two Bengael Oxen and their Carrs. Whilst Wagenaer spent five days in Osacca, preparing all things necessary for his Journey by Land, news came from Meaco, that forty Streets were burnt down in that City, and not a few of the Inhabitants destroy'd by the Flame. Description of the City Jonda.From Osacca, Wagenaer took his Journey through Firaskatta to Jonda, which is a small Town lying in the Territory Jamaisiro, at the River which runs through Osacca, and lies eight Leagues distant from thence. There is scarce any Place in Japan, that for pleasantness surpasseth Jonda: for if you look for curious Buildings, here are stately Turrets, large Churches, and very neat Houses: the Windows are clos'd with bright glittering Shutters: their Chambers are big∣ger or less, according to their several Partitions, the Walls painted with all manner of Imagery on gilded Paper, and edg'd above, below, and on all sides, with black wax'd Ledges: the Doors of the standing Partitions are also adorn∣ed like the Walls: at the upper end of the Chamber hangs generally a Picture;
before which stands a Flower-pot; which kind of Furniture is us'd in all Japan. Near Jonda lies an Imperial Castle, surrounded with a Stone Wall, raised out of deep Moat, within it a stately Palace, whose Turret may be seen at a great distance. The Countrey about it is Woody on one side, and abounds with Deer and wild Boars: on the other side appear pleasant Meadows, which produce store of Rice, and all manner of Plants. No Place affords more Swans, Geese, Ducks, Pheasants, Pigeons, Partridges, Woodcocks, Quails, and all manner of Fowls than this. The River yields Breams, Place, and ex∣ceeding good Salmon, all which Fish come up the River out of the Sea: but those that are taken at Jonda are much better than those which are taken at Osacca. It is to be admir'd, that their Salmon here, though the Heart be cut out, will live several hours afterwards, and that the Heart cut out dies not till a night and a day after. But though this Salmon be acceptable, and of a plea∣sing taste, yet the Head thereof is very unwholsom, for those that eat much of it are subject to get a Fever. Wagenaer arrives at Jedo.Wagenaer got on the one and twentieth of March towards the Evening to Meaco, and presented there the Grand Judge Mackino Sandosamma; from whom he got a free Pass to Jedo, where hearriv'd in safety thirteen days after he left Meaco, the foul and rainy Weather making the Journey longer than at other times; so that the usual time on which the Emperor us'd to give Audience be∣ing past, the Ambassador was forc'd to stay a considerable time before he could be admitted to the Emperor's Presence. Mean while he understood, that Si∣cungodonne had the year before, because of his great age, given over following all publick Employments; and that the Emperor had given his Place to a prime Courtier call'd Hootye Auwanno, Cammisamma: Yet nevertheless Wagenaer sent an Inventory of all the Presents to Sicungodonne, that he might order the dividing of them; but the Interpreters went not to Sicungodonne, but to Joffie∣samma, Governor of Nangesaque, who Read the Inventory over several times, and approv'd at last of the dividing of them, onely he would have the Ambas∣sador to add two Pieces of black Cloth to the Emperor's Presents; and since Joffiesamma would have it so, Wagenaer was forc'd to let the two Pieces of black Cloth go. Moreover he judg'd it unhandsom to leave out Sicungodonne, not∣withstanding he was retir'd from Courtly Employments, considering he had been so great a help to the Hollanders on all occasions heretofore. Whereupon Wagenaer commanded the Interpreters a second time to give the fore-mention'd Inventory to Sicungodonne; but he sent it back without Reading of it, and mo∣destly excus'd himself, that hence-forward he could not serve them in their Bu∣siness; yet he was satisfi'd that they still acknowledg'd him. Sicungodonne's new Successor Hootye Auwanno would not concern himself with the Hollanders this first time; therefore they were forc'd to Govern themselves according to Joffie∣samma's humors, who was a stern and churlish Person. Wagenaer found no small trouble about the securing of his Presents; for the Inn wherein he Lodg'd being nothing else but a Hut cover'd with Straw, ha∣ving not been re-built since the Fire; and indeed all the Houses in Jedo were made after such a manner, that it seem'd rather a large Village than a City. The Store-house behind the Hollanders Inn lay still buried in Rubbish. But Joffiesamma proffer'd Wagenaer his Goddon, and a Chamber in the Palace to di∣vide the Presents in, when they should be given to the Emperor; and although Wagenaer consider'd the removing, yet he durst not deny the Proffer, but Pack∣ing up their Goods sent them thither.
Mean while there came Orders, that the Councellors and Japan Princes were to appear before the Emperor on the eight and twentieth of the new Moon, by them call'd Ninguats; which time agrees with our ninth and tenth of April: Joffiesamma acquainted Wagenaer with it two days before, ordering him, that he and his Retinue should be in handsom Apparel, and come to Court on the ap∣pointed day by nine of the Clock in the Morning: The day being come, Wagenaer rose very early, and fetching the Presents from Joffiesamma's House, carry'd them to Court, where he set them in publick view.Appears before the Em∣peror. But that which most troubled him were the Bengael Oxen, many hundreds of the Japanners ha∣ving waited all the day before to see them; and indeed they made so great a Crowd, that it would have been impossible for him to have gotten through them: to prevent which trouble, the Oxen that stood in the Hollanders Inn were cover'd with red Flannel with silk Tassels, Roses, gilded Bells, and all manner of Ribbons. Before day-break they were led to the Court by the In∣terpreters; where Wagenaer met them at the appointed time: he stay'd two hours in the Emperor's little Palace, which stands Westward from the greater, in which the Emperor resided since he was burnt out of the biggest two years before. What they did with them before the Emperor.In the interim Joffiesamma came into the usual Waiting-Hall, and taking Wagenaer by the Hand, led him through a stately Gallery to the Throne, where he found the Emperor standing upright, and looking more earnestly on the Presents, and chiefly on the Bengael Oxen, than on Wagenaer, who lay with his Face flat on the Ground; but he lay not long before he was commanded to rise, and return to the Hall from whence he came; where staying with his Reti∣nue, a Person of Quality came to them, and ask'd in the name of the Councel, that two Hollanders would come into the open Court, that there they might shew to the Councel (amongst which the Emperor was also present) how they might Harness the Oxen, put them into the Care, and drive them, for the Emperor taking great delight in them, would see them Draw every day: and also besides the other Presents, the rich Alcatiff, wove of Gold and Silver was very acceptable to him; so that the Emperor spent two hours time in viewing the Presents and the Bengael Oxen: after which Wagenaer had leave to depart; which word being brought by Joffiesamma, Wagenaer thank'd him for his quick dispatch with the Emperor. The next day he deliver'd the remaining Presents to the Councel and Magistrates of Jedo, and to the other Persons of Quality, to whom the East-India Company are us'd yearly to present: all of them receiv'd whate're was brought to their Houses by their Servants, none of their Masters ever appearing. Joffiesamma gave the Ambassador timely notice, that the Emperor had cho∣sen two new Councellors that Year, Inoube Cattwatsisamma, and Itacera Auwanna Cammisamma, therefore they ought no ways to be forgotten, whereupon they also had Presents given them. What the Journey to Je∣do cost the Hellanders.This Journey cost very dear, being occasion'd by many inconveniences, for not onely did their Voyages by Water last longer than ordinary, by reason of contrary Winds, but also their Journey by Land, because of the flabby and rainy Weather: Moreover, they were forc'd to stay in Jedo thirty days where all manner of Provisions ever since the Fire were very scarce, and sold at an exceeding dear Rate; and were necessitated to Present the new Councellors, which was more than they expected. Those that remain'd, Joffiesamma advis'd them to carry back to Nangesaque, judging it not convenient to sell them it Jedo,
because it would occasion discontent and envy amongst the Japan Nobility, and chiefly if one should be more kindly us'd than the other. The Hollanders (said he) should make the Inventory of their Presents at Nangesaque, and bring no more to Jedo than what they intended to give away. But Wagenaer inform'd Joffie∣samma, that some years ago the Hollanders receiv'd express Orders, that besides the usual Presents, they should bring also some Merchandise to sell, partly to give to new elected Lords, and partly to accommodate other Persons of Qua∣lity asking for them for Money; which Answer satisfying Joffiesamma, he per∣mitted that Wagenaer should sell the remaining Goods; who made use of this liberty, and sold the Goods for 550 l. Moreover he judg'd it fit for the future to make the Inventory of the Presents at Nangesaque, according to Joffiesamma's advice; and the rather, because that for the time to come they could be no more instructed by Sicungodonne, to whom till then the Hollanders left the divi∣ding of the Presents. Mean while this antient Interceder for the Hollanders seem'd to have a great respect for them, he being exceedingly pleas'd that they had brought him his desir'd Commodities, as Pitch, the best Dutch Sail cloth, and Garden-Seeds, for which he paid according to what they demanded. He requested, that as soon as possible some European Medicines might be sent him: which Wagenaer promis'd faithfully to perform. And Sicungodonne told them, that he would promote all things that might be advantageous to the Hollanders in their East-India Trade: in Which he could do much, he being a great Favorite at Court, and very intimate with the Councellor Enimosamma, through whose hands the greatest Concerns of the Japan Empire pass'd. Japan Nobles are bad Pay-masters.But as for the Money which the Japan Nobility were in arrears since the Fire, which was then two years, the Hollanders had no news of it, notwithstand∣ing a Japan Secretary, call'd Nimon, employ'd by Wagenaer several times de∣manded it, for it availed not: The Debtors being most of them Persons of great Quality, it was dangerous to Dun them; also a Servant scarce durst bring such a Message to his Master, except he be in a very good humor in∣deed. But amongst other Nobles Oenemidonne deny'd that he had bought any Goods, neither could the Interpreters be perswaded, or hir'd by Wagenaer to demand Payment of him: they pretended to be indispos'd, and not in a ca∣pacity to ask for Debts: Yet Wagenaer sent him a Letter to put him in mind; which he receiv'd, and promis'd to pay: but when sent to according to his promise, he deny'd himself, his Servants telling those that came that he was gone up into the Countrey. Wagenaer receives order to fetch the Emperors Pre∣sents, in return for his, from the Court.Till this time the Emperors Presents, which he return'd the Hollanders, us'd to be sent them to their Inn, but now they receive Order, that they should come to Court to fetch them; and there likewise have leave for their depar∣ture. Whereupon Wagenaer went to the Court on the nine and twentieth of April, and stay'd an hour in the Waiting-Hall, when by Hootye Auwanno, Sicun∣godonne's Successor, he was led to an exceeding costly Chamber, and within twenty Paces before four of the Councel: behind which sat several Persons of great Quality. Auwanno gave order to an Interpreter to ask in the Emperor's and Councels Names these following Questions:What is propos'd to him there. In case the Hollanders ever heard that the Spaniards in the Manilla's, or the Portuguese in Goa, had any trea∣cherous Design upon Japan, if they should come to have timely notioe of it, whether or no they would make it known to the Governor of Nangesaque, that they might prepare for Resistance? with which they would exceeding∣ly
get into the Emperor's favor, who would requite such a Courtesie, by granting them a free Trade, without any molestation in Japan. Moreover, Auwanno added hereto, That the Hollanders for the future should be very careful, that they Boarded no Chinese Jonks, that Traded to Japan, so by Robbing them to make the Seas dangerous: the Emperor as yet knew no∣thing of the Jonks that not long since had been taken by them; but if they did not give over Pyrating, the Hollanders would be sure to repent it; for his Imperial Majesty would no ways suffer that the Chineses, who were peacea∣ble Neighbors, should be disturb'd in their Trade. Wagenaer's Answer.Wagenaer reply'd, The Hollanders do account themselves highly obliged to the Japan Empire, therefore they would do all things that might be ad∣vantageous to Japan; and whenever they had the least knowledge, that the Spaniards and Portuguese should Plot against it, they would certainly make it known at Nangesaque. Concerning the Chinese Jonks which were robb'd, the Fact was done by rude Sea-men, and without the least knowledge of the Councel at Batavia; wherefore the Criminals should be severely punish'd for an example to others. Emperors Presents.This Answer pleasing the Council exceeding well, they caus'd thirty of the Emperors richest Coats to be brought on three long Boards: Auwanno said, Your Presents, O Holland Ambassador, are most acceptable to the Emperor; wherefore he hath given you these in return, and also gives you free leave to go to Nangesaque. Which said, Wagenaer was by Joffiesamma conducted to the Guard-Hall, where he wish'd him much joy of his quick Dispatch, and the Em∣perors Favor; and also proffer'd to do him all the Service he could, if he re∣quir'd any thing to his Journey. Hollanders Presents are not accepted, and why.Moreover, the Kings of Ouwarri, Cunocuni, and Mito, the Emperor's Uncle, and also the Councellor Minosamma, ask'd for some Strings of Blood-Coral, and six Cast of Loopen, the form of which was drawn on a piece of Paper, and given to Wagenaer. Minosamma requir'd also a Perspective-Glass, which be∣ing accordingly sent, was return'd again, the same being, as he pretended, too dark; but indeed the fault was in the bad Informations of his Servants, who knew not how to use it. And just so it was with the costly Book of Plants of Rembert Dodoneus; for although the Flowers, Trees, and Herbs were extraor∣dinary handsom to the Life, yet Minosamma sent it back again, because he look'd upon the Prints to be too small, and not well drawn; so desiring a bigger Book, and one that was handsomer painted. And as little was the Globe esteem'd, which with all the Art imaginable was made for the Emperor of Ja∣pan in Amsterdam, because they knew not the meaning thereof; yet some of them could find the chiefest Kingdoms in Europe upon it, and pointing to them with their Fingers, name them: But as for the representation of the Planets, they have many strange thoughts; for most of them think, that certainly such Men and Beasts do invisibly stick to the Clouds; others, that they inhabit the Heavens. Wagenaer's Journey from Jedo to Nangesaque.¶ THirty days Wagenaer spent at Jedo; and going out of this Imperial City on the fourth of May, he came in fourteen days time safe to Osacca, out of whose Haven he set sail the twentieth of the same Month, the Wind and Weather favoring him, and got to Simonificci, where he dropp'd Anchor eight days after he left Osacca. The Interpreter and Bonjoises forbad their Pilot to sail into the Straights be∣tween
Bungo and the Main Coast of Japan, towards the Corean Sea, layings That the time of the Trade-Wind was gone, therefore they should lye longer on the Sea; and that they could not possibly get forward, the Winds blowing continually against them: The Hollanders might, according to the Advice of the Council, travel over-land to Nangesaque, and so chuse a certainty for an uncertainty; and they were sure to be safer on Shore, than at Sea. Yet Wagenaer was doubtful, because new Inventions bring new Inconveni∣encies and Charge; wherefore he thought it best to go the usual way by Wa∣ter, and not through Bungo, which would increase their Charge, that was great enough otherwise: Yet it avail'd not that Wagenaer seem'd to dislike the Proposal of the Bonjoises and Interpreters; but they went against his will their own way, Ferrying over from Simonisicci to the City Cokero, lying on Bungo, in an Inlet opposite to Simonisicci; and landing at Cokero, whether Wagenaer would or not, he was forc'd to follow them. His dangerous Journey though Bungo.The Journey was dangerous, because of the Rivers which run between the Rocks, through which they were forc'd to wade: The steep Banks and doubt∣ful Depths made it the more troublesom. With these Dangers also came In∣conveniences; for the Island Bungo, otherwise call'd Cikoko, is but poorly stock'd from Cokero to Nangesaque; so that scarce any thing of the meanest Pro∣visions were to be had there. Wagenaer travell'd in that manner five days, leaving Jammanganomisacci and Assia on the right hand, and passing through the Kingdoms of Facata and Fisen, along a dirty way, made so by the continual Showrs of Rain that fall there. In the City Fisen he refresh'd himself, where he got abundance of all manner of Provisions, and chiefly was entertain'd with a dainty Fish, not unlike a Salmon, being taken in the River Day, which washes the Castle Daymats. Description of the city Fisen, and the stately Castle Daymats.This Castle is very beautiful to behold: The Governor thereof hath a Banquetting-house, built in the middle of the River, on thick Pillars, between which the Stream sets very swift; in it are several delightful and spacious Rooms; the lowermost jutting Roofs are all adorn'd with Golden Balls; un∣derneath them lye several Pleasure-Boats, to shelter them from the Weather. The Burrough of the Castle Daymats affords a Habitation for the Custom∣ers which receive the Custom from the Ships which pass up and down the River, and the Revenues of the adjacent Countreys; so that there is a con∣tinual Concourse of People in this Place, not an Hour passing but one or other is carried in a Sedan to the Water-gate; others ride thither on Horses; some rouling of Packs and Barrels, others loading them on Carts drawn by Oxen. Between this Burrough and the River Day, lies a Plain very convenient for Landing or Shipping of Goods which are to pay Custom, The Burrough it self hath three Gates; the chiefest lies on the Shore, where the Entrance be∣gins under a Roof, with two Trap-doors, between two Walls that rise higher and higher to the second Gate, made fast in the Wall on each side; the top of it appears a little above the Bulwarks: These Bulwarks have many Redoubts; on some of the outmost of them are square Watch-houses, two Stories high; within are several fair Houses, inhabited by the Customers. From the Burrough a way leads up the Hill to the Castle, inclos'd between thick and high Walls, above which appear the Roofs of very stately Buildings. The fair Portals are four in number; but six Turrets exceed all the rest ill Splendor, five whereof rise aloft each with five Stories; the sixth surpasses
Lordship and Castle DAMATS the other, being one Story higher; and the Costliness of it, dazling the Eyes of the Beholders, can scarce be describ'd. Mid-way between the Burrough and the Castle, stands a handsom Temple, in which the Bonzies daily perform their Service. The City Fisen lies for the most part hid in a Valley behind the Castle, and appears with several high Temples and Turrets, with above twenty thousand lesser Buildings. ¶ WAgenaer travelling through the Province Omura, left Auwo, Tabra, Ay∣noro, Oysinucobi, Omodakey, Nantsjamma, Zetta, and Focunda on the right hand, and came on the second of June, five days after he Landed on Cokero, to Nangesaque, where he had News from Formosa,News from Formosa. That the Tartars and Coxengans were upon concluding a Peace; wherefore he lay before the Nankin Coast, to hasten the Confirmation of it. There was also News from Tayovan, concern∣ing the Chinese Interpreter Cabessa Pingua, that privately he demanded the Cu∣stom in Coxenga's Name, from the Jonks which Traded to Formosa; which be∣ing known, he was committed to Custody, and after having receiv'd some small Punishment, releas'd; but yet was since fled, with his Wife and Chil∣dren, to China, where he serves Coxenga for Toll-gatherer in Annay, and without doubt will plot no great good for the East-India Company. The said Pingua is run above seventy thousand Ryals in debt in Formosa. Moreover, Wagenaer staid till the first of November for the Ship the Black Bull, which was very richly laden; but because she did not come, he was fain to make a Market with Tonquean Silk, European Piece-Goods, as Cloth, Serges, Perpetuanaes, and Siam Furs, and promise upon an Obligation, That the Cargo in the Bull, when she came to an Anchor before Disma, should be laid up for the next Year. The staying away of this Ship, was occasion'd because at that time less Profit was made in Japan by eight Tun of Gold, than at other times.
The manner of the Hol∣landers selling their Goods in Japan is remarkable.¶ THeir Sale is after this manner: In November the East-India Company have free leave to Trade. On Munday they shew their Goods; for then the Store-house on Disma, before Nangesaque, is open'd: A great long Bench stands in the middle of the Gallery, which below hath three hundred Rooms for the stowing of Goods. Above live the Servants to the East-India Company. On the Bench stand Silver Chargers, in which lye all manner of Merchandizes, viz. Drugs, Pepper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamon, Buck∣skins, Buff, and other Skins; also Tonkian Peeleng, Musk, Europeans Clothes, Serges, Looking-glasses, Speckled Wood, Quicksilver, Brimstone, and Hats which are worn by the Nobility of Japan. Towards Evening all the Store-Chambers are seal'd with the Emperors Arms, in the presence of one of the Magistrates of Nangesaque, who sits with the Holland Merchant during the time of Trade, at the chief Table. The Service here is attended by three hundred Japanners, daily employ'd by the East-India Company. The foremention'd Gallery is square, and rests on Pillars of Speckled Wood, twelve Foot high; a winding pair of Stairs leads up to it, the Floor thereof being cover'd with rich Tapestry: Round about stand Stools, on whose Silk Cushions the Arms of the East-India Company are embroider'd. When the Japanners enter the Gallery, they pull off their Shoes. On Tuesdays they contract about the Price, the next day they deliver; then the Water-gate of the Holland Store-house is open'd, where all November they lade and unlade their Goods, into above a hundred Barques. Upon Sundays they rest, because the Hollanders following their Devotion, permit no Work to be done. The manner us'd by the Japanners in selling their Goods.Mean while, in the same Month also, is kept an Annual Fair, where the Ja∣panners erect Booths of Sail-Cloth, in which they sell Copper, Silver, China Roots, Camphire and Camphire-wood, curious Porcelan Plates and Dishes, Silk, Japan Coats, on the outsides embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and quilt∣ed with Cotton, wrought Plate, Rice, Tobacco, wax'd Cabinets and Chests. Whilst thus they set their Commodities to sale, they make themselves merry with Sakje, a Drink made of the best Wheat, having a strange smell, but as strong as Spanish Wine. The foremention'd Magistrate is Security for all that is sold. The Silver and Copper weigh'd in a Scale, and mark'd with the Emperors Stamp, is deliver'd in Chests. Generally the East-India Company take at one time of Sale, for their Commodities, six hundred Chests of Silver, and two thousand of Copper; yet sometimes they take a great deal more or less: Every Chest of Silver amounts to a thousand Crowns. Remarkable Passage of Martin Remei.¶ IN the interim Wagenaer prepar'd the Ship the Singing Bird to go for Bata∣via, but was hindred one day by Accident: Martin Remei, a Native of Formosa, coming as Chyrurgeon from Tayovan, with the Ship Nieuport, to Nangesaque, had leave to inhabit ashore, in the hinder part of the Hollanders Store-house on the Island Disma, with three Factors; but was miss'd in the Morning, on the thirteenth of November; yet they found at last a Letter in his Bed, that he rose to bereave himself of Life, because a Japan Whore, with whom he had lain three days, was gone away, by which means she had be∣reav'd him of his Pleasures. Wagenaer sent in vain to search all corners, either to find him living or dead: whereupon he made the Business known to the Magistrates, who gave immediate order, impowering some Bonjoises and In∣terpreters, and also their own Servants, to search all Houses and Skulking-places:
Whereupon they search'd the Ships, Jonks, and Japan Vessels; and indeed all Nangesaque was in an Uproar about it. Wagenaer caus'd his Men to Fish round about Disma, and was not a little troubled that he could not find Remei: For the Governors reported, That it was a Portugttese Priest, brought from China thither, that kept himself private with some yet undiscover'd Chri∣stians. But this Opinion soon vanish'd, when Remei the fifteenth of November, about the Evening, was brought bound on the Island Disma, to the great joy of those that kept the Watch when he made his escape; for they would all of them have lost their Lives for their Negligence. This Remei was gotten over the Walls in the Night, and at low Water to the East side of the Haven before Nangesaque, where he hid himself under a long Chinese Straw Sail, till such time Hunger forc'd him to come out: But be∣ing instantly taken, was carried Prisoner to the Governor, who sent him to Wa∣genaer, and he kept him in safe custody, and sent him afterwards to Tayovan, there to suffer punishment according to his desert. It hapned that at that time the Governor was in an exceeding good humor, who otherwise deals very severely with those that get ashore out of the Hol∣landers Ships: Wherefore the Japanners take a List of the Names, Ages, and Offices of the Sea-men, to the smallest Youth, so soon as any Ship approaches the Harbor of Nangesaque; and if any one of them should be found wanting when they are going away, both Ship and Men would thereby happen into a great inconveniency, unless they could prove, that the Person which was wanting died a natural death, or with the Magistrates leave of Nangesaque, staid behind on the Island Disma. Another Exploit of a Dutch Chirurgeon.Two Years after, hapned almost the like Accident. The Chyrurgeon be∣longing to the Admiral Vollenhoven leap'd over-board in the night, to swim aboard of a Jonk, that so out of Curiosity he might make a Voyage to China; which the Pilot made known to the Commander Indiik, who acquainted the Magistrates with it, which immediately sent Soldiers and Servants to make search for him; and if he should not be found, they threatned the Hollanders to let their Ships drive ashore, where with Goods and Men they would set them on Fire. On the third day he that fled Was fetch'd out of a Chinese Jonk, bound Hand and Foot, and thrown into the Emperors Prison, whence he escap'd not without great trouble, and Sums of Money; and was also for ever banish'd from Japan, upon pain of Death. Sad Accident of a drunk∣en Sea-man.¶ BUt it fell not out so well with a drunken Sea-man belonging to the Grave∣land, who took oft the Emperors Straw Seal with which the Hatches were seal'd; when on the Morning the Interpreters coming aboard, with the Workmen that brought the Balast, which consists of little Chests full of Cop∣per, weighing a hundred and fifty pound weight, observ'd that the Emperors Arms were torn from one of the Hatches: They immediately made it known to the Bonjoises, which continually sit on the Prow of the Ship, upon a costly Carpet: The Bonjoises seal'd the Hatch again, and immediately inform'd the Governors, who instantly sent twenty of the Emperors Soldiers aboard, to demand the Man which had so presumptuously spoil'd the Emperors Arms, or else they would carry all the whole Ships Crew to Prison: Whereupon he that was guilty discovering himself, was carried ashore before the Magistrates, who cutting him in at the left Shoulder, made their Sword come out under his right Arm.
How the Japanners cut their Servants in the mid∣dle.¶ In this bloody Office they use no Executioners; but every one that buys a new Hanger, tries it either by cutting a Man, Woman, or Child through with both his Hands. This kind of Exercise happens often, and chiefly when any Christians stand condemned; for they take them, and hang them up by the Feet on a Gibbet, with their Heads downwards into a Well, in which they cut several Holes, that the Blood may so drop out by degrees. Near the Gibbet on one side burns a continual Fire; on the other side waves a white Pennon, taken in every Evening, and put forth in the day-time, till the Malefactor be dead and burnt. But the nearest Relation to the so tormented Christian, as also three of his Neighbors, die, without sparing either Wives or Children, by the forementi∣on'd way of cutting them in at the left Shoulder, so bringing their Sword out under the right Arm. Chinese Merchant, can∣not sell their Goods.¶ AFter this, the Chineses in Coxenga's Name complain'd again, about the taken Jonk which was call away before Tayovan; but were order'd to go to Batavia, to seek for redress there: Upon which, they gave out, That if they should come in Batavia, they should be murder'd; which Report of theirs was but little regarded. And they had not much better Success with their raw white Silk, of which they sold not one pound at Nangesaque; whereas, on the contrary, the East-India Company exchang'd al their Tonquean and Ben∣gala Silk, for good Silver; the Japan Merchants having agreed to bestow all their Moneys on the Hollanders, before they bought any thing of the Chineses. Mean while they finding nothing to do, were necessitated to depart from thence with their Merchandize, not without great damage: and should they but one or two Years more meet with such a bad Market, it would without all peradventure weaken and dishearten their great Navigation, and hinder them from sending yearly fifty loaden Jonks to Japan, to the great prejudice of the East-India Company, who in many things are forc'd to give way to the Chineses. ¶ WHilst Wagenaer was preparing for his Voyage to Batavia, he receiv'd twenty one thousand seven hundred and sixty pieces of the best white Porcelan. A Month before the delivery of them, another Person had brought a considerable Parcel of Porcelan to sell on the Island Disma; but be∣cause they were too full of Flowers, most of them stuck on his Hands. The Japanners have some few years been more eager in making of Porcelan than heretofore;Japanners make great store of Porcelan. so that not onely the Hollanders, but also the Chineses vend a great deal thereof. The best place for this Commodity is the Lordship Fesen, of the Earth of which place they make it, being finer and whiter than else∣where. The Japanners grow every Year more and more experienc'd in this Art; so that they make their Porcelan better and better. Wagenaer contriv'd a small Flower to be made on a blue Ground; but was exceedingly amaz'd, when not long after he saw all the Shops full of them. But whereas Fesen produces the best Porcelan in Japan; so in China, the Vil∣lage Sinktesimo. It is worthy our observation, That the Earth, which is not un∣like fine Sand, of which they bake their Porcelan, is digg'd up near the Me∣tropolis Hoeicheu, lying in the Territory of Nankin, where they onely knead it into Balls or Pellets,How it is made. which seal'd with the Emperors Arms, are sold at a cer∣tain price, and sent to Sinktesimo; for this Village onely, by a hidden Power
or Operation in the Waters there, makes the best Porcelan. Those that bake, are Rustical Clowns, brought up to that Trade from their Infancy. They prepare the Earth two several ways: Sometimes they work it so soon as it comes from Hoeichen, after the same manner as our European Potters prepare their Clay for their Pots and Pans. At other times they let it lye so long, till it is grown as hard as a Stone, which they afterwards stamp to Powder, sift it through a very fine Sieve, then mixing it with Water, knead it into Balls, and at last press it into a Wooden Frame, according to what fashion they please: Then they are first dry'd in the Wind, and put into an Oven, which fifteen days together is continually hot, and afterwards kept close as many days more, that so they may cool by degrees, or else they would: break all to pie∣ces. After thirty days the Oven is open'd, in the presence of one of the Em∣perors Officers, who narrowly looks on every Piece thereof, and, according to the Laws of the Countrey, takes away every fifth Piece of Porcelan to the Emperors use. The rest the Potters at Sinktesimo sell to the Inhabitants of Uci∣engen, a Village lying at the Lake Poyang, on the left hand Shore of the River Can. The Place is above two Miles long, rich for Traffick, and replenish'd with handsom Buildings; every Year so full with those that Trade in Porce∣lan, that one can scarce pass the Throng. The River lyes generally full of Barques, wherein they load, and so transport it over all the World: From hence appears the old mistake of their Opinion in Europe, believing,Great mistake. That the Stuff of which they made the Porcelan was the Powder of Sea-Cockles, or Egg-shells, or else of Earth which their Fore-fathers prepar'd, and kept it a hundred Years after under Ground; so their Succeffors valu'd it according to its Age. How the Japanners car∣ry the Dutch Ships out of their Haven.¶ WAgenaer setting sail in the Ship Hilversom for Batavia, so soon as ever his Guns were brought aboard, and the Rudder hung, was forc'd to be gone, notwithstanding a great part of his Goods lay upon the Deck. The Japanners hold it for an ancient Law, That as soon as ever the Hollanders Ammunition is brought aboard, whether in the Night or Day, contrary or fair Winds, they must go to Sea; but if by reason of contrary Winds they cannot get beyond the Priest-Mountain, they have above a hundred Watches about their Ship, which cutting their Cables, tow them out of the Haven of Nangesaque. In the Corean Ocean, generally, from September to April, a Nor∣therly Trade-wind blows so fresh, that they can scarce carry out their Top∣sails. The Bank Pracellis, for∣merly a Kingdom.But this Ship Hilversom ran once in this Voyage no small danger, falling by Night on the Tail of Pracellis, which is a Riff or Bank lying about twenty Leagues from the main Coast of Cambodia, being above a hundred Leagues long, and forty broad. The Indians relate, That it was a Kingdom in former Ages, but sunk by Earthquakes. On both sides of Pracellis lye two Shoals, call'd Bruers Sand, and Alkmaers; wherefore it is very dangerous here for Shipping: and this is the place where in Anno 1660. the rich laden Ship Ter∣goes was split all to pieces. Wagenaer would fain have put for the Piscadore Islands, to find out the long∣miss'd Ship, the Bull; but durst not go too near the Shore because of the Ha∣zie Weather: Yet Anchoring at Pool Timon,Miserable condition of the Ship call'd the Sea-Knight. he found there the Ship call'd The Sea-Knight, miserably torn and shatter'd by foul Weather, most part of her Masts being gone, and the Fore-castle and Cabins well-nigh wash'd away by
the Sea: The Merchant Henry Baron, and a great many of the Sea-men, seem'd more like Skeletons, than Living Creatures: Baron was struck with a lame∣ness in his Hands, and the Palsie in his Feet; so seeming to hasten to death, while he was yet living; which made Wagenaer earnestly to ask him concern∣ing the State and Condition of Tonkin, that after his Decease he might relate the same to the Council at Batavia.Strange Sickness in Ton∣kin. The Sea-men related, That there hapned that Year a great Sickness in Tonkin, which suddenly took away abundance of People, and seiz'd upon the healthfullest Persons in a Minutes Time, first a Giddiness taking them in the Head, of which they fell on the Ground, and died both senseless and speechless in few Hours; after which manner, the Netherland Agent in Tonkin, Nicholas de Voog, died also. This Tonkin Sickness was not unlike the Plague in England, first known in King Henry the Sevenths Reign, Anno 1486. which after forty three Years spreading over Germany, swept away an innumerable company of People in a short time.:Plague. After which, the Plague began again in England, and chiefly in London, where Anno 1550. died a very great number in a few Months. It is said, That a Master of a Family having twelve Children, besides his Wife and Ser∣vants, was well and hearty at Dinner, yet all of them dead before Night. Those that got the Sickness, died in few Hours; but if suddenly they sweated out the Poyson, they recover'd by Degrees. Wagenaer arrives at Ba∣tavia.¶WAgenaer furnishing the Sea-Knight with some Provisions, went on his Voyage; but missing the Straights of Banka, he hapned to come amongst several unknown Islands, where he drove up and down three Hours, before he got on his right Course again. This, and the other trouble of get∣ting over the Tail of Pracellis, arose from the difference amongst the Officers of the Ship, every one willing to Steer a several Course, notwithstanding the strong Currents deceiv'd many; yet in December, Anno 1659. Wagenaer arriv'd safe at Batavia, and went ashore with Henry Indiik and Ernest of Hoogenhoek. Indiik made Governor of Disma.But Indiik staid but a small time in Batavia, bein sent back to Japan, to take the Place of John Bouchelyon; and accordingly he set Sail in the Calf Frigat, accom∣nied with the Hearn and Sparrow, on the six and twentieth of November, Anno 1660. The Charge and Command of the East-India Companies Treasure in Japan was committed to Indiik, whom the Secretaries Sannemondonne and Mootef∣nostrydonne complemented (according to the Custom, being establish'd in his new Employ) in the Governor of Nangesaque's Name, desiring him to take special care of his Fire and Candles, to prevent all dangers that might accrew thereby; and took also a List of the Netherlanders Names that remain'd on the Island Disma, the number whereof were nineteen, amongst which were reckon'd Indiik's Son and Daughter, besides the Blacks which were in the Ser∣vice of the East-India Company. Apparel of the prime Japanners.¶ THe Apparel of the Secretaries, as also of all other Japanners of any Quality, is very costly: Their Heads are shav'd bare on the top, and round about hangs short Hair like a Circle, having behind a Lock tied with a Ribbon: The Upper-Coat or Tunick, by the Japanners call'd Korekorre, is of divers Colours, adorn'd with Silken Flowers, and being very wide, hangs open before, and reaches down to their Knees: About their Middle they wear a Girdle, embroyder'd with Silk and Gold, in which stick two Hangers, the one bigger than the other; the Scabbards of them embroyder'd,
and the long Handles cover'd with Gold Wyre: Their Tunick they clasp up behind on the top of their Girdles, that every Mans Coat of Arms, which hangs at the bottom of his Wast-band, may be seen: These Scutcheons are made square, and richly embroyder'd; and their Under-Coat, being quilted with Cotton, is tied with the aforesaid Girdle: Their Breeches very wide and long, trailing above a Foot after them, and they tread on them before as they go. No Japanner of any Quality comes ever abroad without an Atten∣dance of three or four Servants at least, whereof one carries a round Umbrello after his Master, who walks before in an exceeding proud posture, with a Cane in his Hand; another carries before on his Shoulders a Stick, at each end whereof hangs a square Wax'd Box, in one of which is his Lords Slip∣pers, and in the other his Inkhorn. The Servants are Cloth'd in short Coats, tyed about their Middles with a Cotton Girdle; walk on Clogs, made fast with a Button between their first and second Toes, and go bare-headed; their Heads also shaven, and a tuft of Hair tied up behind with a piece of Fillet. But the Secretaries that came to Complement the new-elected Governor, after some Entertainment, return'd home. The Hollanders Burying-place in Japan.¶ NOt long after, Indiik had leave to Interre the Body of the Deceas'd Mer∣chant Francis Reynerson: The Corps put in a Coffin, was carried under a Black Cloth through Nangesaque, by the Book-keepers, Interpreters, and other Servants of the East-India Company, to a Barque, in which they carried it over to the other side of the Haven before Nangesaque, and there buried it on a Hill, being the Place for that purpose, given by the Japanners to the Netherlanders. News of Coxenga's De∣sign upon Formesa.Mean while the Ottena (for so they call the Japan Governor of Disma, where∣on the Hollanders Store-house stands) brought Information from a Chinese Jonk, that was come with a rich Cargo from Zaetsin to Nangesaque, That Coxenga not long after their departure had a considerable number of Soldiers, ready to send
under the Conduct of a valiant Chinese General, and two Mandarins, of which one was his Uncle Sauja, to Formosa, there to take Tayovan and the Fort Zealande from the East-India Company, or at least to pillage the Countrey. The Jonk also brought news, That the Chinese Admiral Itchien coming with a great many rich Merchandizes to Japan, had by a mighty Storm lost all his Upper-works, and with much ado sav'd his Life: And that in Tonkin, since the last great Sick∣ness there, which swept away many thousand People, after the manner afore∣mention'd, a second Plague had hapned, which did no less mischief; for the Waters breaking up in all parts of the Countrey,Strange poysonous Wa∣ter. had poyson'd all the Soil, and sent forth malignant Vapours, which destroy'd both Men and Beasts. ¶ FUrthermore, Indiik engag'd the Servants of the East-India Company not onely to come and hear the usual Evening and Morning Service; but also to be present at the hearing of the Sermons, and singing of Psalms on the Sunday. And whilst they follow'd their Religion thus undisturb'd, Tsoemangy Ficojemon came to Nangesaque, to Officiate as Governor in the deceased Kaynussio's Place: Wherefore Indiik was not negligent to wish Ficojemon Joy, by the In∣terpreters and Ottena, of his new Office; desiring that himself might have the Honor to Complement and tender him some Presents; which being grant∣ed, Indiik went thither, proffer'd his Presents, and desir'd Ficojemon's Favor, who modestly receiv'd the Presents, promis'd his Assistance to the promoting of the Netherland Trade,Ficojemon visits Indiik. and not long after came with great Attendance to visit Indiik on the Island Disma, where he took great delight in the Garden be∣fore the Store-house, Planted after the Dutch manner, and chiefly in the strange European Commodities, and also in the Presents which were to be sent to the Emperor. Indiik thought to entertain him with Preserv'd Persian Fruits, Brandy, and Tent; but he neither tasting the one nor the other, took his leave and departed. A sad accident at Nan∣gesaque.¶ SOon after, Ficojemon met with some trouble, by means of a Citizens Daughter, who hang'd her self in the Night in Nangesaque: He made strict Inquiry after the Reason that provok'd her thereto, which at last he dis∣cover'd to this effect. A Chinese Commander of a Ship being enamour'd of the Maid, had upon great Promises, and by the assistance of a Japanner, crop'd her Virgin-Flower; which she afterwards seriously considering with her self, and fearing that if she should be with Child, then her Crime would be pub∣lickly known, and bring her into utter disgrace; to prevent the same, she laid violent Hands on her self: But the Criminals being taken, and put in Prison, ran great danger of their Lives; yet at last, by many Intreaties, a milder Sen∣tence pass'd on both; the Chinese being for ever banish'd from Japan; and the Japanner, to the Islands Goto; and his Goods seiz'd upon by the Law, were most part of them given to the Parents of the foremention'd Maid. Jeffiesamma's cruelty.¶ NOt long after this Accident, Joffiesamma shew'd the People a Pattern of his Cruelty, by cutting asunder two of his Servants, for a small Of∣fence; the one thirteen, and the other fifteen years old. A Fire in Nangesaque.The Night after hapned a Fire Nangesaque, which in four of the eminent'st Streets consum'd a hundred Houses, which undid many great Merchants; for they putting all their Goods in the Stone Store-houses, judging them to be ve∣ry safe, they were all burnt.
¶ THe nine and twentieth of November, Nangesaque was also shaken by an Earthquake, which sometimes seeming to abate, soon after made the whole Town tremble, which was chiefly on the third of January, in the following year; when this Trepidation threatned no small danger in the night. The Joynts of the houses beginning to gape, the Timber and Walls tumbling down, which occasion'd a general out-cry in the City; yet with the day-break, the noise and Earthquake ceased; but the whole City was in a hurry, occasion'd by five and twenty Roman Christians,Cruelty us'd to Roman Christians. that after intolerable Tortures, yet remain'd constant in their Religions, and were now going to be led out of Nangesaque, there to be hung with their Feet upwards, and their Heads flea'd downwards, so to die a lingering death; when they had hung a day and a night in that miserable manner, two of them desir'd, that they might appear before the Magistrates of the City of Nangesaque; who thereupon, coming to the place of Audience, heard that they were not able any longer to endure the unsupportable torture, but were ready to renounce their Christianity, and imbrace the Japanners Doctrine; on which promise,How the Japanners de∣ny Christianity. being let loose, they spat at a Woodden Cross, then stamp'd upon the Picture of our Saviour Christ and the Virgin Mary, to the great grief of their Brother Suf∣ferers, which refus'd to be releas'd on these terms, but pittifully crying, said, Surely we shall soon depart out of this Wretched World, and go to Paradise, where we shall be out of the Power of the Japan Tyrants, and enjoy Everlasting Beatitude. Seventy four Christians beheaded.And when these foremention'd had hung seven days in that manner, with their Heads downwards, there were seventy four more new discover'd Christi∣ans brought thither, which were all to be Beheaded; these cry'd as loud as their faintness would permit them, Remain stedfast in the Christian Faith, we shall e're long meet in Heaven. The seventy four, amongst which were not onely Women and Children, but also sucking Babes were altogether Beheaded, their Heads set on Iron Pins, and their Bodies thrown in a deep pit; Indiik being an Eye-witness, admir'd at their Constancy, and the more, because the Martyr'd Japanners had so little knowledge of the Christian Religion; but the Netherland Interpreters inform'd him, that several of them gave themselves out to be Christians,Why they suffer them∣selves to be Executed. that with their Wives and Children, which for want of Provisions and chiefly Rice, they were not able to maintain, they might die together, and so be rid of the Mise∣ries of this World. Freezes hard in Japan.¶ THe fourth, fifth, and sixth of February it Froze so hard, that the Ice would bear the weight of three Men. Moreover,Fire at Miaco. News came to Nangesaque, that the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same Moneth, a Fire happen'd in Miaco, which consum'd not onely seventy Streets to Ashes, but al∣so the Dayro's stately Palace. Indiik's Journey thorow Bung.¶ THe second of March, Indiik Travel'd to Cokero, where the Lord of Omu∣ra sent him Vessels to Ferry over from Tokits to Smongy. In both these Towns the Streets were Swept very clean, and the Citizens all abroad to re∣ceive and fetch in the Dutch Ambassador. Upon one side of Smongy appears the Famous and Magnificent Palace Onnays, the enterance into it is by broad Steps,Description of the Palace Onnays. cut out of the middle of the two bordering Rocks; on the sixteenth Step, the Stairs are divided, and ascend on each side of the Gate, behind which, they again

This Gate hath three large Entrances; on the four corners of the Roof, lie Couchant Dragons all Gilt; this inner Gate opens in the middle of a long Gallery, which hath eight square Windows towards the Front, and as many within: The lowermost Edges of the jetting Roof are adorn'd with Gil∣ded Balls: The Gallery on the right and left side look upon two stately Tur∣rets, which rise aloft with three Stories, one lesser than the other, in which are kept the Treasures of the Palace; on one side is a no less curious than pleasant Garden, full of variety of Trees and Flowers; behind the Treasuries are two other Towers of the same make, in which his Wives and Concubines live. The Town Coyo.In this part of Japan, the Town Coyo, Consecrated to a Bonzi call'd Conbodaxi is very famous, being held for the Burying-place of the Prince of Bungo; or if they chance to be Interr'd elsewhere, there must at least a Tooth of theirs be found at Coyo. Indiik's Voyage.¶ BUt Indiik Sailing from Cokero to Simonisicci, he found the Barque there which he had sent before thorow the Corean Ocean with his Goods: So go∣ing Aboard on the seventh of March, in the Haven of Simonisicci, in seven days he arriv'd in Osacca. The Hollanders Landlord Icubia Serojemon and the Interpre∣ters, made Indiik's arrival known to the two Governors, before which he ap∣pear'd, and brought Presents the next day, which by both were kindly accepted: And Indiik provided with Horses,His Journey by Land to Jedo. came thorow Firaskatta, Jonda, and Fis∣sima
to Miaco, where the old Host Koffe Sabrojemon carry'd immediate News thereof to the Grand Judge Mackino Sandosamma, which that Evening permitted him Audience, kindly accepted the Presents, and gave him a new Letter of Conduct; wherefore he neglected no time, but went on his Journey, and Lodg'd afterwards in Cusatz, and next in Sacca; and forcing over from Quano, he got late at night to Mia, where he rested. Moreover, he found the House for the Hollanders Entertainment in Occosacci Lock'd and Guarded, because the Master thereof being fall'n out with his Neighbors, was in danger to be slain by them. Leaving this Town, he Lodg'd in the Village Accosacci, Ferry'd over the Bay between Arei and the Village Mei∣sacca, and was forc'd by reason of the great Showres of Rain to stay in Fanna∣ma, he design'd to Lodge the next night in Caneia, but finding the usual Inn there Guarded, notwithstanding it was almost dark, and Rain'd hard, he went on, and Ferrying over the River Oyengauwa, refresh'd in Simanda. At Merico he was again forc'd to pass by the old Inn, no body being at home, the Master thereof being gone to Surunga, there to release his Son, who was committed to Prison for fighting with one of the Villagers. Arrives at Jedo.The eight and twentieth of March, Anno 1661. Indiik, after he had left Siman∣da, and Lodging at Jesare, Missima, Odauro, and Toska, came to Jedo, in which City were yet many empty Streets, though they went on very vigorously in Building; and in regard the Bridges were not yet repair'd, Indiik was forc'd to Ride a great way about, before he could come to the usual House of Enter∣tainment. Which no sooner being enter'd, but he sent the Interpreter Fatsiseymon and his Landlord Ginnemon to the Lords Joffiesamma, and Hootie Auwanno Camisamma, who was chosen in Sicungodonne's place to Negotiate the Hollanders Affairs at Court, to acquaint them of his arrival: Fatsiseymon and Ginnemon brought an∣swer, that the foremention'd Lords were joyful for the safe and speedy Journey of the Hollanders, and that on the morrow, they would acquaint the Councel of their coming; and Order'd moreover, that Indiik should get the Presents rea∣dy with all speed, for they knew not how soon he might be admitted to the Em∣perors presence. Sicungodonne's Secretary demanded in his Masters Name, Who dy'd two days before Indiik's entrance into Jedo, for the Goods which Sicungodonne had desir'd and given Order for the year before;Joffiesamma goes to meet Indiik. but Fatsiseymon going again to Jof∣fiesamma, desir'd in Indiik's Name, some private Conference, which was permit∣ted. Mean while, Joffiesamma told him, That he understood of the Councel, that the Emperor not long ago, out of his own accord should ask, Will not the Hollanders come shortly, for it grows late in the Year? Upon which the Councel reply'd, They are expected suddenly. This enquiry of the Emperors, Joffiesamma judg'd to be an exceeding great favor, that the Hollanders should find place in the Emperor's Memory; but soon after he chang'd these kind Speeches, for when the List of the Presents for the Emperor, and other Persons of Qua∣lity was shown him, that according to Indiik's Request, he might either order them to be added to, or else diminish'd; he began to reckon up the Price of them, and what every Piece amounted to; which done, he flew out in a Rage, saying, What do the Hollanders lessen their Presents yearly; at this rate it will in a short time come to nothing? what is this else but a parcel of course Cloth? This answer Fatsiseymon carry'd home, which would have seem'd very strange to Indiik, could he have credited the Interpreter; but because he was known
to be a great Lier and a Cheat, whose whole business was onely to get all what he could, therefore he knew not how to order his Affair, and the more, be∣cause the Presents, besides divers Rarities amounted to full as much as the last years Presents.Indiik nobly entertain'd in Joffiesamma's house. Yet Indiik was advis'd to add three Pieces of Scarlet more to the List, which pleas'd Joffiesamma, who permitted Indiik to speak with him; whereupon going thither, he found Gekdonne Joffiesamma's Son, who courteously Saluted him in a stately Hall; which Duty, all the rest of the Family perform'd. At last Joffiesamma came forth himself, and bade Indiik kindly welcome, telling him that he was just going to Court about his Business, that he might procure him a quick dispatch from the Emperor: So taking his leave, Commanded his Secretary Sannemon to entertain the Ambassador and his Retinue, he being a good Companion, let them not want Wine and variety of Meats. Joffiesam∣ma's Lady also caus'd several Flasks of her own Liquors to be brought to them, being the Juyce of Plums and other relishing Fruits: They took great delight in the Ambassador Indiik's Son, to whom they gave some Presents for himself, and his Sister, and desir'd him to come and visit them every day. Description of the stately apparel of a Japan Wo∣man.¶ EXceeding costly is the Apparel of the Japan Gentlewomen; for as Joffie∣samma's Wife came forth to see the Hollanders, so most Ladies of that qua∣lity go after the same manner. It deserves our admiration, that the Japan Wo∣men exceed all other Females that are known in the World, for broad Faces, and great Heads; their Hair Wash'd everyday with the Whites of Eggs, shines like Jet: The Maids are distinguish'd from the Marry'd Women, by a Coyfe which they wear on their Fore-heads; whereas the Marry'd Women wear a loose Lock before, and another ty'd behind; they all go bare Headed in what Weather soever; but yet the primest Ladies wear an Embroyder'd Cap on their Heads, which is Peeked on the top; their Hair from under it, on both sides covers their Shoulders, behind hangs a Lock Brayded with Silk Ribbon: A large upper Gown, folded on their Breasts, is not onely rich for the Silken Ima∣ges
thereon, but also the broad Selvedges Embroyder'd with Gold: This Coat or Gown which hangs loose about the upper part of the Body, and their Arms, is Girt about their Waste with a broad Tabby-Girdle, on which they bestow great Charges; from the Girdle downward it hangs close about them, but un∣der this Coat Trail after them sometimes eight or twelve Coats more, most of them Party-Colour'd, and full of Embroyder'd Flowers: Sometimes they wear Clogs, which they make fast with a Button and Loop betwixt their great and second Toes; and at other times, the Ladies of Honor use curious white Bus∣kins, (by the Japanners call'd Taepis) but the Noble-men wear them also white and red. Moreover, all Gentlewomen of great Quality, whether Widows, Maids, or Marry'd Women never walk abroad without some Servant-Maids to attend them, of which every one knows her particular Office. A Marry'd La∣dy never comes forth into the Street, but is carry'd in a Sedan, or else in a co∣ver'd Boat, in which she takes her pleasure upon the Water; in the Evening onely she goes to walk, but not without her Husband. How the Japanners make merry.But Indiik being Nobly entertain'd in Joffiesamma's House, took his leave: Cam∣bedonne Chief Commander of the Palace Ficojemon, being newly erected to be Deputy-Governor of Nangesaque, bore Indiik Company in the Street, and forc'd him to follow, and go a second time to be merry with him; Indiik not daring to deny the Japanners Civility, went thither, and entering the Palace, was cour∣teously welcom'd, according to the Japan Custom, and desir'd to fit and Smoke Tobacco, Drink Tee, and Wine, out of Dishes with one Foot. Moreover, there was no Cost or Charges spared in preparing variety of Meat, and at Meals their Ears were delighted, not onely with Vocal, but Instrumental Musick. To∣wards night, Indiik got home, though most of his Men were overcome with the strong Liquors. The Japanners know no Drinking-Houses, yet they have conve∣nient Inns for Travellers, whilst the Nobility and other People entertain one another in their own Houses, and never quarrel, but when they are Fuddled; but those that are soberest, take care to see those that are inebriated asleep. Fire in Jedo.The next day Indiik return'd the Governor Joffiesamma thanks for his kind Entertainment by two Interpreters, and desir'd to know what was done in the Hollanders Business at Court. Joffiesamma not giving the Interpreters any particu∣lar answer, sent one of his Gentlemen to Indiik, telling him, that two days after, being the second of April, he should appear before the Emperor; where∣upon Indiik unpack'd all his Goods, laying every Parcel by it self; and whilst they were all busie in the night about this Business, a sudden Fire broke out not above a Musquet Shot from the Hollanders Inn. The Master thereof made great lamentation, his House and all his Goods having been burnt thrice in four years time; but Indiik suddenly sever'd all the Goods in the Stone-Ware-house, stopping up all the Windows and Doors of it with Clay, every one looking to save himself, when the Fire, after having destroy'd twelve Houses, the Weather being very Calm, was quench'd. The Holland Ambasador Indiik appears before the Emperor.The day being come to appear before the Emperor, Indiik sent his Presents yearly to the Court, following them himself with a Bonjois, and coming before the Gate of the Emperor's Palace, went into a Watch-house, where he found Joffiesamma and divers other Persons of Quality; here they stay'd an hour: Jof∣fiesamma, at last going from thence, soon return'd, and conducted Indiik over some fine Mats into the Palace, and passing thorow a Gallery into the Guard Chamber he met Hoetie Auwanno, who courteously saluted Indiik, and told him by Joffiesamma, what honor he must shew to the Emperor: But whilst they were
busie about this Injunction, Orders came, that the Ambassador should come in, Auwanno and Joffiesamma,A remarkable passage happen'd to Indiik with an unknown Courtier, went before, brought In∣diik to the Presents, which were laid in good order over against the Emperor; Indiik kneeling down, the three which brought him in fell down behind him: Then Matsendeiro Biesecusamma the Councellor Insiens Brother, said the usual Word, Hollanda Capitein; at which saying, which is their Complement, Indiik lifted his Head from the Ground, but before he could raise himself to see the Emperor sitting on a high Cushion, Joffiesamma hit him on the Back with his Hand, as a sign, that he had not yet leave to lift his Face from the Ground. Indiik's Son entertain'd in the Japan Court.But soon after; Indiik was order'd to rise, and go to the Guard-Chamber, where several Courtiers wish'd him Joy for the Honor which he had receiv'd by appearing before the Emperor. They were scarce turn'd about to be gone, but a Gentleman came, that taking the Ambassadors Son by the Hand, led him, with the Interpretor Fatsiseymon and the Merchant Nicholas de Roy to the place where Indiik had shewn honor to the Emperor, where the Councel stood yet altogether, and ask'd the Child's Age, where Born, and his Name, on which they were answer'd, that he was six year and a half old, born in Siam, and was call'd Garret. The Youth seeing the rich Cushion, ask'd the Interpreter, If the Emperor did not sit there sometimes? Which the Councel observing, ask'd what he said, which Fatsiseymon Interpreting, they admir'd at it: They also saw him very earnestly looking on the Gilded House, and rich Sieling over the Emperors Throne; first one, and then the other, taking the Child by the Hand, led him through the Emperors Chambers, and at last sent him again to his Father, who then had leave to depart. Indiik's other business in JedoAfter that Indiik spent two days in dividing of Presents to the four Councel∣lors of State, and other Persons of Quality, and was visited by many, so that he found enough to do for a whole day, to speak and Complement all those that came to see him, and Entertain them with Tent and Brandy: Amongst others came Ficojemon's Son, with a Commander of two hundred Souldiers, on whose Knee, being hurt, the Hollanders Chyrurgeon laid a great Plaister, and pour'd some Oil into his Sons Ear, to cure him of a pain which he had been long troubled with: Sicungodonne's Secretary also fetch'd the two Globes which his deceas'd Lord had desir'd. Appears a second time in the Emperor's Court be∣fore the Councel.The tenth of April, Indiik came again to Court, to receive the Emperors Pre∣sents of Return; and staying about an hour in the Guard-Chamber, Auwanno and Joffiesamma conducted the Ambassador to a very stately Chamber, in which the four Councellors of State fate against Gilded Partitions. Sacaja Outusamma. fat on the right hand of them, all next Isen; then Bonge and Monisamma: The chiefest Councellor being Outasamma,His discourse with them. spake, saying: Holland Ambassador, it is not unknown to you, how acceptable it will be to the Emperor to hear of you, if the Portu∣guese have any Design upon this Empire; as on the contrary, the Emperor is not pleas'd that the Trade of the Chynese Jonks should be molested by your People. Indiik answer'd, That the Councel need not to doubt of the Hollanders Fidelity, who would do all things to preserve the Japanners Favor; wherefore they every where employ'd Persons to observe the Affairs of the Portuguese, that if they should have the least knowledge that they had a Design upon Japan, to acquaint the Governor of Nangesaque with it. Moreover, the Governor of the East-India Trade had given strict Orders, upon Pain of great Punishment, That none should any way molest the Chinese Jonks; Indiik commanded to withdraw, was soon after fetch'd in again. Outusamma ask'd him again, If he would promise
to tell the Governor of Nangesaque, when at any time he should meet with any Portuguese between Batavia, Formosa, and Japan, whether at Sea or on any Islands or main Land, before the Chyneses brought advice thereof? Indiik promis'd to perform it to the utmost of his Power. Then being order'd a second time to withdraw, and call'd in again, he saw thirty Imperial Coats lying on curious Wax'd Boards, before which he lay down on the ground: When Joffiesamma said, Your Presents, 0 Holland Ambassador, are very acceptable to the Emperor, wherefore he Presents you with these Coats, as a return for yours, and gives you leave to go for Nangesaque. How Indiik receiv'd the Japan Presents of return.Which said, Indiik being instructed by Auwanno, crept towards the Coats, and laying a Skirt of one of them on his Head, so returning thanks for them, went away. The Coats pack'd into three Chests, were sent to the Hollanders Inn: Moreover, Indiik return'd all the Japan Nobility thanks for their several favors in their own Palaces; but not finding Auwanno at home, he deliver'd his Mes∣sage to the Secretary, that in Indiik's Name he would be pleas'd to return his Lord hearty thanks for his speedy dispatch, which his Secretary telling him so soon as he came home, sent Indiik three Silk Coats, and proffers to do him all the service he could. After this, several other Coats were brought by Noblemens Servants, as returns for their Presents, which they had receiv'd from the Hollanders; all which the Merchant Nicholas de Roy modestly receiv'd , whilst the Ambassador Indiik took his leave in several places; his Son going twice to Outusamma's Pal∣lace, who took the Youth, and set him in his Lap, feeding him in the presence of divers Persons of great Quality. Is entertain'd by a Japan Priest.Indiik was now ready for his Journey, having onely the chief Priest at Asa∣xen's Temple to take his leave of, whose favor was very requisite to obtain, he being brother to Otta Bietchonsamma, chief Councellor of State: This Person was exceedingly pleas'd, when Indiik, besides several other European Commodi∣ties, Presented him with a curious Woodden Ship, which he afterwards hung in the Church, in memory of the Hollanders. Moreover, he entertain'd the Am∣bassadors after a very stately manner, carry'd him thorow the Temple, where he shew'd him the Mysteries of the Japan Religion, and gave him in return some Silk Coats, and four Boats of Silver. Lastly, Indiik sent to Auwanno, the Hollanders Solicitor, several curious Glasses, and desir'd that he might take his leave: Auwanno accepted of them, but as for the taking of his leave, he had not time for the present, for he expected every hour, several Persons of Quality to visit him, so that he could scarce in one word wish him a prosperous Journey; whereas at other times he would not let the Holland Ambassador ever have gone without Treating him at his Palace; so parting, and going home, Indiik reckon'd with his Landlord, paid the usual Prizes for Diet and Lodging, and Ware-house room; but he desir'd that he would please to lend him a thousand Taile upon Interest, to build and furnish his House again, his Habitation being thrice Burnt down in four Year. But Indiik deny'd his Request, pretending that his Journey (because of the scarcity of Provisions) would amount to a great deal of Money, so that he knew not whether he should have enough for himself; but yet to obliege him, he pre∣sented him with three Pieces of Perpetuanaes, which were spoiled in the Dye. Departs from Jods.Indiik after having been Nobly Entertain'd, left Jedo on the fifteenth of April, accompany'd by his Landlord to Cawasacca; after which, he Lodg'd at Toska, Odauro, Missima, Kaneya, and Fannama, where he Ferry'd over a Bay of the Southern
Ocean to Arei, then Lodg'd in the Village Accosacci, and Miaco, in which City the Hollanders were very nobly Entertain'd in a new Inn;Comes to Miaco. here he staid till midnight, the Water being so low, that he could not Ferry over. Mean while; the Goods and Horses were Ship'd Aboard; two hours before day, Indiik came to Quana, and the five and twentieth of April to Miaco. Description of the Fiery Mountain Siurpurama.¶ HE left, eight Leagues beyond this City, near the great Lake, the famous Burning Mountain Siurpurama, afterwards Inspected by the Holland Ambassador Seldere. This Mountain is of an excessive height, Vomits forth Smoke and Flames: The Smoke alters its course according as the Wind blows, and beats down sometimes in such a manner, that it not onely makes the ad∣jacent Countreys at Noon-day seem'd Clouded with Night, but also Smothers Men and Beasts. Next this Mountain is another, but not so high; three Sulphurous Streams come flowing from them, which sometimes over-flowing, rushes into the Vallies, making a great Smother and noise, which also filling, seek their course another way, often warning down great Pieces of Rocks and Stones: All these three Streams running down on the Champain spreads it self a Mile and a half in length, but much more in breath: The Countrey round about the Moun∣tains is so excessive hot, that none can stand long there, but it will burn their Feet. Description of the Sul∣phur, of which Gold, Silver, and other Mettals are made.¶ THis Sulphur, taken for a fat, yet fine Matter, made in the under Grounds, producing with mixt Quicksilver, Copper, Silver, Gold, and other Mettals: The chiefest Philosophers affirm, That there are two sorts of these Vapors that lie hid under ground; the one being dry and more Ear∣thy than Watery; the Earthy Vapors afford Materials for Free-Stone, and the other of Sulphur and Quicksilver, being mixt both together, make Silver, Gold, and all manner of Mettals. Moreover, let it not seem strange to any, that those Vomitings of the Mountains often send forth firm Bodies, as Stones, and pieces of Rocks; because those kind of Vapors are very thick and often Smother the Miners, or if they escape with Life, are afterwards trou∣bled with extreme Sickness. These Vapors also are sometimes Waterish, and mixt with Earth, for if they were all Water, they could not melt, and if all Earth, they could not cleave and stick so hard together. This Sulphur is the Food of that Fire, which burns on the top of Siurpurama; and it Represents an undeniable testimony of Fire under the Ground, by which the Earth is warm'd as much underneath, as the Sun by its Beams heats it on the top. Blefken's Voyage to Island.¶ But besides Siurpurama, are reckon'd amongst the Burning Mountains He∣cla in Island,Burning Mountain Hecla. an Eye-witness, Dithmar Blefken, describes Hecla thus: On the North of Island lies Hecla by the Sea-shore, and Vomits up sometimes be∣sides terrible Flames, blackish Water and Flint-Stones. Anno 1568. the twenty ninth of October, this Mountain gave such a terrible blow, that it made the whole Countrey of Island shake; at which every one expected utter Ruine, the noise ratling in the Air, as if a thousand Pieces of Canon had gone off; the Flames seem'd to Fire the Skie; the Ground trembled, and the Smoke so darken'd the Island, that sometimes they were not able to distinguish one thing from another; sometimes the Flames chang'd the darkness into light: The boyling Sulphur∣ous Waters flowing above six Leagues space over the Countrey.
Burning Mountain on Ternata.¶ No less terrible was the breaking forth of a Mountain on Ternata: A Fleet under the Command of Paul van Caerden, coming to an Anchor there, saw the Fire as it were burning above the Clouds, after which follow'd a great Smoke, that turn'd it self round in the Air. The first Ships that Sail'd from Holland,Near Panarucan. under the Command of John John∣son Miller, and Cornelius Houtman, were not a little afraid, when they came near the City Panarucan, because of a Mountain that sent forth dreadful Flames, and made great Claps, like Thunder. America, according to Joseph de Acosta, hath several Burning Mountains;Arequipa. par∣ticularly, one call'd Arequipa, very Sandy, and two days Journey high. In Mexico, near the Village de Los Angelos, lyes another,Los Angelis. whose Foot carries thirty Leagues in Circumference, and from an unmeasurable high top, both at Sun-rising and setting, casts out abundance of Ashes and Smoke; which last rising upright, spreads it self in the Air like a Plume of Feathers, till at last it vanishes, after which appears a thick black Cloud. Some Leagues distant lyes another call'd Tlaxcala,Tlaxcala. Hist. Nat. b. 3. l. 24. on which are continually Lightnings seen, and Thunders heard. But the Mountain Guatimala exceeds them all,Guatimala. whose spiring top shooting up to the Clouds, is seen a great distance off in the South-Sea. The three and twentieth of December, Anno 1586. it vomited forth whole Rivers of Fire and burning Matter, which afterwards descending, was found to be nothing but Ashes and burning Stones; and thus it continu'd six Months. Mean while the Earth also was so shaken, that it turn'd the City Guatimala topsie-turvey, and buried in its Ruines thousands of People. About the same time,De Los Ryes. the Mountain near de Los Reyes threw up so much Ashes, that flying about the Countrey, it turn'd the Day into Night, insomuch that for several Miles none could go out of their Houses. Acosta relates,Ignorance of a Spanish Priest. That a Spanish Priest thought to get Gold out of one of the Burning Mountains in America; for which purpose, he caus'd Iron Pots and Kettles to be made, to catch the several Matters that came flowing from it; but they no sooner touch'd the Flame, but they melted. In Sicily the Mountain Aetna, now call'd Mongibelle, hath been famous,Aetna. lying on a Promontory near the Mid-land Sea: An Eye-witness, Thomas Fazellus, de∣scribes it thus: AEtna (says he) hath on the South and West sides of it great inhabited Villages, planted with extraordinary good Grapes, and all manner of other Fruit-Trees: The Ground pav'd with Pebble-stones, falling from the Hill in abundance: In some places Fountains spring up, in others flow delightful Rivers, which the Fire often swallows, or stops up with heaps of burnt Stone. There are also great Mill-stones found in the hanging of the Mountain, which were cast up Anno 1537. in a terrible Fire. The upper∣most part of this Mountain smokes continually, and sometimes Flames break through it, seen above a League in compass; the inner parts are consum'd by the Fire; a little below the top lyes Snow continually, which melts not in the hottest Summer; but when the Flames strike downwards, it floweth over, and pours down into the Valleys like a boyling Stream. In the fore∣mention'd year, the highest part of Aetna fell into the Hole; so that at present it gapes wider, but is not so high as formerly. The Hole from whence issue the Smoke and Flames, emits a continual thundering noise from its fathom∣less Bottom; and the other little Vent-holes always roar.Philippus Cluverius
says, That he saw Stones ejected thence above sixty thousand Paces off; and that it also spoil'd a Way with its burning Sulphurous Streams, of four Leagues long, destroying all things before it. Moreover,Vesuvius. Vesuvius in Italy is also very well known, which sometimes boyls over in that manner, that it fires Campania. Amongst other times, this Mountain burnt very terribly the sixth of October, Anno 473. the Ashes thereof flying as far as Constantinople, The Roman Empire for several years together, according to Joseph Scaliger, kept a Fast-day in re∣membrance of that dreadful Conflagration. ¶IT is very well worth bur Labor, to make an Inquiry, Why those Coun∣treys in which Burning Mountains are found, are generally very fruit∣ful? as appears by Campania, in which Vesuvius vomits continual Smoke and Fire; Sicily, famous (as we said before) for Mount Aetna; and Siurpurama, in the Japan Kingdom Voari. The nature of the Earthy Fire.It seems without contradiction, that there is Fire under Ground, which spreads it self through the Bowels of the Earth, no otherwise than the natural warmth of a Mans Heart diffuses it self through all his Body. This Truth appears plainly, because the Earth commonly smokes in the Winter time, and the Snow which falls on the Ground that is newly Plowed, melts instant∣ly: From the Water and Earth Vapors or Mists are drawn up by the Sun and Moon into the Air, where being cleansed, they fall down again in Hail, Rain, or Snow, which never sink above ten Foot deep into the Ground. The Heat of the Sun, warming the moist Earth, makes the Soil fruitful; but the Fire in its Bowels yields no small help, thereby as it were thrusting up the Seed and Plants. The warm Fountains that spring out of the tops of the Mountains,Warm Fountains. are no despicable Testimonies; for the Water being driven upwards by the Heat, forcing its way, spouts out; not unlike a Still, in which the purer Spirits or Moisture goes upwards, and through a Pipe come dropping from it; or like the Fumes which rise from the Stomach up into the Brain, where gathering Substance, Nature discharges them through the Mouth or Nose. Warm Baths in Japan and other places.Also the warm Lakes or Baths do greatly testifie, that they are heated by a Fire inclos'd in the Earth; for if it were otherwise, how could the Japan Wa∣ter at Singok be of such force, that being pour'd on the Body, it should scorch the Flesh to the Bone? How could the Italian Pool near Parma, as Fallopius re∣lates, draw Flames to it, so that the Water being set on Fire, cannot be put out but by throwing Cloth over it, or else by a stiff Gale of Wind? Sulphur Mountain in Ja∣pan.It deserves peculiar observation, That Siurpurama, without ever ceasing, should for so many Ages together pour down Sulphurous Streams, between decay'd Stones, that all the Ground thereabouts is chang'd into a kind of Sulphur. Italy, about Mutina, gives us a sufficient Testimony hereof: If the Pits out of which they dig Sulphur are fill'd up with Earth, it will in the space of four years be converted into Sulphur. Necessity of the Earthy Fire.Lastly, This Earthly Fire is necessary for the making of Minerals, which being boyl'd by the Heat thereof, are molted and cleansed. The same Fire occasions also Earthquakes; wherefore sometimes upon the sinking of the Ground, which consum'd underneath falls in, terrible Flames break forth. To conclude: By the abundance of Earthquakes, and richness of the Soil,
may easily be conjectur'd, That Japan hides great store of Sulphur in the Bow∣els of the Earth, which there serves for the Food of that Subterranean Fire. Indiik's further Journey.¶ BUt Indiik leaving Siurpurama on his Larboard, came the fifth of April to Meaco, where by his Landlord he immediately made his Return known to the Governor Mackino Sandosamma, which presented Indiik with some Silk Coats, and gave him leave to depart: After which, he was carried by the Master of the House where he lodg'd to see a Comedy, wherein the Japanners are very neat and exact: The Players richly attir'd, represent on the Stage all the Transactions of Mankind so well, that they are no ways inferior to any of our European Comedians; and indeed Indiik would have judg'd better of them, could he have understood the Japan Tongue. But Indiik having deliver'd a hundred Japan Silk Coats to his Landlord, to keep for the East-India Company, and seen the great Temple of Dayboth, and also several other Temples, left Meaco, and lodg'd in Fissima, where taking Shipping, he came to Osacca. From the City, his Landlord, with a great Train of Friends and Servants,His Voyage. conducted him in two Pleasure-Boats to the Mouth of the River Osacca, where the Barque which had the Hollanders Goods aboard lay at Anchor: The Wind blowing fresh from the West, they could not make Sail. Mean while the Pleasure-Boats lying on each side of the Barque, the People went aboard her, and made merry with the Japan Wine which they had brought with them to drink at the Ambassadors departure. His Journey through Bungo.The third of May weighing Anchor, on the eleventh with Rowing and Sailing they pass'd by Simonisicci, and came to Cokero, where Indiik staying a Night, hired Horses and Men to travel through Bungo by Land to Nangesaque. Description of the Bath at Orismo.After he left Cokero, he came on the fourteenth day to Orismo, where he took great delight in a Stove or Bath, which was cover'd with a very handsom Roof: The Water came running through Copper Cocks into the Bath, from a Brook so hot on one side, that none can put in their Fingers without scald∣ing: But that which is no less strange, and a remarkable Privacy in Nature, is, that the same Brook on the other side flows extreme cold, in one Channel with the hot Water. When they prepare a Bath, the Master thereof first lets the hot Water run in, which he afterwards tempers with the cold, as those that bathe require. This Mystery of Nature is grounded on the Earthy Fire, by which the Waters being heated in deep Pits, spring upwards like a Fountain: But some Rivers have several Avenues and narrow Passages under the Earth, and so of∣ten lose their heat before they come to the top; when as others detain their warmth, because they flow through wide Channels, nearer the Subterranean Fire, from whence they rise up directly: It therefore happens (though very seldom) that two Fountains, of which one produces warm, the other cold Water, occasion'd by the foremention'd Reason, flow in one Channel, because each by its swift Course detains its own Property: And so it is with the Brook that in Orismo affords Water for the Bath. Baths very ancient, and several.It appears that the Japanners make use of the Profit which Nature bestows on these Waters, according to the Custom of several other People, after divers ways: For though Bathing was customary in former Ages, yet every Countrey observ'd a several way therein.
The ancient Biscayners took not Water, but stinking Piss, with which they wash'd their Gums and naked Body. The Scythians us'd Women, which pour'd Water on Mens Bodies, and after painted them with red Stones. The Dardanians and Illyrians permitted a Man to Bathe but thrice in his Life∣time, viz. at his Birth, Marriage, and Death. The ancient Germans made use of a River, in which they swam every day; though sometimes they went before Meals into a Bath, which was formerly observ'd by the Romans, as at this day by the Turks. Two remarkable Won∣ders in the Bath at Orismo.It will not be amiss to make some inquiry, why any one that before he bathes himself makes warm but having bathed, it comes cold from him; which happens because the Body before bathing is cold, but warm'd by bathing, makes the Urine cold. It is also a strange Mystery, that those that when they go to bathe are no ways thirsty, by bathing become exceeding dry; and on the contrary, those that are desirous to drink when they go in, shall have no mind at all to it when they come out: The Reasons whereof may proceed hence, viz. Thirst is occasion'd by Drought; wherefore those that begin to bathe when adry, the Body draws through the Pores, by the inward force of the Vital Spirits, the thinnest Moisture, by which the Drought is quenched: But those that do not go thirsty into the Bath, force out their Drink by sweating, so that the Bo∣dy within becomes dry, and occasions Thirst. The Romans at first had dark and pittiful Baths; but when by their Power they had made great Conquests, they became Teachers of all Magnificence; which amongst other things they express'd in their Baths, the erecting and ordering of which,Riches of the Baths. amaz'd the Eyes of the Beholders. A Roman (says Seneca) thought himself very poor, if the Walls of his Bath were not made of Alex∣andrian Marble, and adorn'd with Numidian Ledges; a Thesian Stone inclos'd the Water; the Floor consisted of pure Silver, imboss'd with Pearls and Dia∣monds; and the Edifice rested on stately Pillars, being hung round with Pi∣ctures, drawn by the Hand of the most excellent Masters. Moreover, they were attended by Barbers, Chyrurgeons, Men to rub them and help them out and in, some to keep their Clothes, and other Servants. ¶GReat delight the Holland Ambassador took in this strange Bath at Oris∣mo: But at length going forward in his Journey, he was nobly en∣tertain'd in the Provinces of Facata and Figen, the Lords of which Countreys provided Horses and Men for him, causing all the Streets of the Cities through which he pass'd, to be clean swept against his coming. The Governor of Oene∣warimet rode out of the City to meet and fetch in the Ambassador, in this or∣der: In the first Rank march'd five Japan Soldiers, which the Governor fol∣low'd on Horse-back, holding a Standard in his Hand; behind him came the Emperors Overseer and Warden, one after the other, under two Umbrelloes, made fast on long Sticks, each carried by three Men: These were follow'd by three Chariots, guarded on both sides with Japan Horse and Foot, in the mid∣dlemost whereof the Holland Ambassador was carried. Description of the City and Lordship Oenewarimet.¶ OEnewarimet is a small City, lying upon the River Dony, abounding with Fish, scituate on the hanging of a pleasant Hill, all over shaded with Trees. The River washes most part of the City Walls, which are full of Re∣douts,
De Stadt OUNEWARI CASTEEL. The Citty Ounewari with the Castle and planted with high Trees, that appearing above the Wall, glister in the Water. The River runs in a Bay before the City, and flows very swift under a Stone-Bridge to the Corean Sea: The Bridge very broad, built of Free∣stone, and rising in the middle, hath eight curious Arches, and Stone Rails on both sides: On one side stands the Custom-house, on the Shore opposite against the City, where the Ships must come to an Anchor, and pay Custom; and for denying of any Goods in the Ship, 'tis present Death. The Bridge ends on a Promontory, on both sides wash'd by the River Dony, which leads to the City. The Gate and Wall, built betwixt the Houses of a broad Street, hath in the middle a large Hatch, through which you pass into the Town. Not far from thence stands a fair Temple, inhabited by the Bonzi. But besides this Street, are several others, that lead along by the Foot of a Rock, which is exceed∣ing steep: The Stairs which lead to the top of it, are cut out of the Rock, on which stands an invincible Castle, the Walls and Towers whereof may be seen at a great distance, the highest of which is five Stories, one smaller than the other; the second, much bigger, hath two stately Halls, the uppermost of which is as big as the lowermost: From one side of this Castle you may be∣hold the pleasant Vallies, planted with Rice; and on the other side, delight∣ful Hills, over-grown with Trees, which in several Places shade little Vil∣lages. Indiik arrives at Nangesaque.¶ THe sixteenth of May, Indiik came safe to Nangesaque, and found the Ser∣vants of the East-India Company, on the Island Disma, in good health. Soon after the Watch on the Nomoan Hills, told the Governor of Nangesaque, that they descry'd two Sails not far from the Shore: Whereupon Indiik having leave to send some small Vessels to discover the Ships, sent Ernest Hoogenhoek, with three Sloops, who saw that it was the Frigat Graveland, and the Fly boat call'd the Vinke, which were Steering for Nangesaque: They brought a Letter with them, written the eighteenth of May, 1661, in the Fort Zelandia, sign'd by
Frederick Cojet, John Oetjens of Waveren, Thomas of Ypre, and David Harthouwen: The Contents these. A Letter from Cojet, con∣cerning Coxenga's Onet upon Formosa. Coxenga coming with three hundred Sail, extraordinarily Mann'd, through the Lakjemonian Straights, Landed in Formosa the thirteenth of April, and in∣stantly made himself Master of the whole Island. The Fort Provincia yield∣ed upon the first Assault of the Chineses: The Hollanders that liv'd up and down Formosa, are all cruelly murder'd: The City near the Castle Zealandia lies in Ashes in several places, but plunder'd in all: The Fort Zelandia was closely besieg'd: From the Hector Frigat, which engag'd with several Jonks, and was blown up by her own Powder, none were sav'd: The Ships Grave∣land and Mary found themselves unable to engage with Coxenga's Fleet; wherefore they fled from them: The Ships de Vink and Immenhorne come hi∣ther from Kelang, if they should want Provisions, or by their Enemies be forc'd to put to Sea again, they shall come to Japan, to fetch all things that you can send to our Assistance, with Provisions, as Rice, Meal, and Japan Wine; for our Store in the Castle begins to grow very scarce. Indiik immediately made this sorrowful News known by an Interpreter to the Governor of Nangesaque, whilst the Ships Graveland and the Vink came to an Anchor before Disma. The Governor desir'd to have the whole Business of Formosa in Writing: And that he might have a true Account thereof, Indiik order'd, that the Merchant Nicholas Loenius, the Minister Mark Massius, and the Captain of the Graveland should come ashore, and relate the whole Circum∣stance. Chineses Storm the Fort Zelandia.Indiik understood moreover, That Coxenga fired day and night, from a Plat∣form with twelve Demiculverins, against the Fort Zelandia; and that already Waveren's House was shot down, and a great Breach made in the Wall: yet the Besieg'd remain'd not in his debt; for Cojet sallying out with a Select Par∣ty, made himself Master of the Platform and the twelve Guns, two of which he carried into the Castle, and the rest he made useless; and that they had Crui∣sed to and again before Tayovan till the tenth of June; but because they could do no good to the Fort Zelandia, and their Provisions also growing very scarce, they judg'd it convenient to Sail to Japan, and in their way to touch at Quelang, not onely to refresh themselves, but fetch all the East-India Compa∣nies Concerns from thence, they lying bare to Coxenga, whose Forces were daily expected there; for which reason, Graveland Anchoring there the thir∣teenth of June, loaded all whatever he could in seven days time: Moreover, he took in a hundred and seventy Men,The Inhabitants of Que∣lang remove. with three married Dutch Women, eleven Quelangois Children, and eight and twenty Slaves of both Sexes. The Women and Children were Landed on Disma, because of the disorder in the Ship Graveland. The Relation of the Condition of Formosa, translated into Japan, and sent to Jedo.Furthermore, Indiik deliver'd this Relation, translated into the Japan Tongue, to the Governor or Nangesaque, That Coxenga had above nine years ago design'd with the Tayovans and Chineses that inhabited Formosa, to betray and take the Fort Zelandia from the Hollanders; but the Plot being discover'd, the Traytors were all executed: And the Chineses also, sent under the Conduct of one Fayet to Storm Zelandia, had little better Success; for the Besieg'd sallied out so fortunately, that few of them were left to carry the News of their Ad∣venture to Coxenga: Fayet himself was also found slain amongst the rest: Other meaner Soldiers being taken and carried Prisoners into the Castle, consess'd that they were employ'd in Coxenga's Service, who notwithstanding this Re∣pulse,
gave not over from prosecuting his Design; of which Coyet being in∣form'd, was very vigilant, and the more, because a great Chinese Trader call'd Pinequa, being not onely much in the East-India Companies Debt, but also se∣veral Merchants in Tayovan, ran away privately, which was not onely pre∣judicial, but dangerous, because they knew the whole Estate and Condition of Formosa; so that it very much troubled Coyet, who well knew that he would relate the whole Condition of the Fort Zelandia to Coxenga: Also he might easily guess, that Coxenga, who had for several years had a Design upon For∣mosa, would take hold of such an opportunity to accomplish his desire. The Jealousie grew the greater, when News came from all Parts, that Coxenga Listed great numbers of Men, and prepar'd a great Fleet to Conquer Formosa. Coyet observ'd all things very narrowly, and sent a Letter with a Chinese Jonk to Coxenga, in which he desir'd, That he would please to send him word to what end he made such mighty Preparations for War, and against whom he design'd them: To which Coxenga, acting the Politician, cunningly answer'd, That Coyet ought not onely not to believe those that brought him such News, but to keep them Prisoners, and make them confess the Truth by Tortures. And the better to cloke his Intentions, he now and then sent twenty or thirty Chinese Jonks with Merchandize to Tayovan: Yet notwithstanding all this, Coyet still suspected him, writing all things particularly to the Council at Ba∣tavia, who with all speed sent twelve Men of War to his assistance, which about the middle of September Anchor'd before Zelandia; three of which Coyet sent to Coxenga, to observe all his Transactions, and have an answer of every Par∣ticular. These Coxenga entertain'd exceeding courteously, protesting to them, That he had a very great kindness for the East-India Company, of which Coyet might certainly assure himself. By these fair Carriages deluded, he now be∣lieving all things which had been reported false, sent the Fleet to another Place, onely two great Ships, and as many small ones, which he sent to fetch in the Lading for the great ones, staid behind. Coxenga had no sooner receiv'd the News of the Men of Wars departure from Zelandia, but he sent with all speed three hundred Jonks, Mann'd with four thousand Men, to Formosa; and Sailing in the Night through the Lakjemonian Straights, Landed many of his Men in the Morning on Formosa, which immediately stopp'd up the Inland Channel, and lay between the Fort Zelandia and Formosa: Whereupon Coyet sent three hundred Soldiers to prevent their Landing; but they quickly found themselves surrounded, so that they were forc'd to fight to the last Man, and purchase their Deaths dearly from the Chineses. But they having fresh Sup∣plies, Storm'd the Castle Provincia, standing on Secam, opposite to Formo∣sa, which being but weak, was not able to resist long against such a Powerful Enemy. The fifth of May they robb'd and burnt the Town before Zelandia, which being guarded by eleven hundred Men, some of them fired upon them from two Platforms, on each were Planted twelve Demiculverins. Of the four Ships that remain'd before Tayovan, the greatest, call'd the Hector, was with a hundred Men blown up: The Ketch Mary hoised all her Sails, and went directly for Batavia: The other two, being the Graveland the Vink, Sail'd to Quelang, to carry the News of the War thither; from whence return∣ing to Zelandia, they Cruis'd up and down along that Coast, but at last stood for Nangesaque. Moreover, Loenius related, That Coxenga had not conquer'd the Fort Zelandia when he came from thence, and also that Cojet had sent the Vessel call'd Immenhorn, under the Command of Jacob Sas, to Torrissima, to fetch
the remaining Goods of the Ship call'd the Harp, which had suffer'd Ship∣wrack on that Coast; but Sas found them not, the Goods being sent before in small Vessels to Satsuma, where the Lord of the Countrey keeps his Court. The Governor of Nangesaque immediately sent this Relation, written in the Japan Language, to the Emperor at Jedo; but whilst it was on its way thither, a Jonk richly loaden, from whose Yards and Masts wav'd several blue Pennons and Flags, came to an Anchor before Disma: The Captain thereof, a Chinese, being commanded to appear before the Governor, related, That Coxenga was in Tayovan, and was Master of all Formosa, and that a hun∣dred and forty of the Besieg'd sallying out of Zelandia were so beaten by him, that onely seven of them escap'd with lise; and that he had also burnt three Holland Ships, and drove two from the Coast; likewise, how eleven days af∣ter his departure from Anhay, new Forces would be sent to Tayovan, to supply Coxenga's Army there. Indiik desires leave to take the Chinese Jonks.Hereupon, Indiik entreated of the Governor Ficojemondonne, in a Letter, That since Coxenga had dealt so treacherously with the East-India Company, and set upon them unawares, that he would please to grant him leave to seize upon all the Jonks he could meet with at Sea, or elsewhere, belonging to Coxenga: Up∣on which,But is aeny'd. Ficojemondonne sent this Answer, That he durst not take upon him to grant so weighty a Concern; but that he must write about it to Jedo, and ex∣pect an Answer from the Emperors Court; but he could not think that the Emperor would any ways grant that the Chinese Trade to Japan should be at all molested; the more, because Japan should not lose the rich Commodities, and chiefly the Drugs which China furnish'd them withal: But if the Hollanders would take revenge on Coxenga, they might do it at Formosa, and not interrupt his Jonks at Sea, which Traded to Japan. His resolute Answer.Upon which Indiik sent Ficojemondonne this Reply: How could the Court in Jedo take it ill from them, to do all the hurt they could to their Publick Ene∣my, which the Laws of all Nations permitted? Shall the East-India Company be every where ruin'd by Coxenga, and not take revenge? The taking of Cox∣enga's Jonks, must be perform'd according to the Councils Order Batavia; and the Japanners would not in the least be prejudic'd by it: for the Jonks from Canton and Nanquin brought over abundance of Chinese Merchandize and Goods, so that Japan might easily dispence with Coxenga's Jonks; and they would also without doubt forsake Coxenga and submit to the Tartar, when they observ'd, that they were debarr'd from the Trade of Japan by the Hollanders Private Men of War. Thus it remain'd for a time, Ficojemondonne sending in Writing a true Re∣lation of all the Transactions in Formosa, and Indiik's Request for the taking of Coxenga's Vessels to Jedo. Mean while, News was brought that the Watch on the Nomoan Mountain had descried two Ships: Indiik had leave to order Camphador Rjfje to prepare three Vessels, with which the Merchant Hoogenhoek should put to Sea; who found that the discover'd Ships were the Goree and Diemermeer, richly laden from Batavia. Hoogenhoek was also inform'd by them, That a third Ship, be∣ing the Buyentkerk, aboard which was Derick van Lyer, Indiik's Successor, would shortly follow, though yet out of sight. All of them soon after came to an Anchor before Disma. Indiik also agreed with the Copper-Merchants for the Price of the Copper, who had rais'd it higher than formerly, because the Miners Provisions and
Maintenance was dearer this Year than heretofore, by reason that now Rice was very scarce. Hollanders give the Chi∣neses Letters of Conduct.The Chinese Jonks which were not under the Command of Coxenga, came now and then to Nangesaque, but not without a free Pass from the Holland Go∣vernors that resided in China, Siam, and other Places. On the fourth of August a Jonk that came from the Haven Faisoos shew'd a free Pass, granted by the Ambassador Jacob Kaysar; and another from Siam, that had the like Letter sign'd in the Netherlanders Treasury in India, by John van Rich: The Contents these; Since Anachoda Mamet Mousoen is ready to set Sail with the Jonk Opta, belonging to Sinorat Governor of the Moors in India, and desires our Letter for his Security, that he may not be taken for one of Coxenga's Ships; there∣fore we could not refuse him so reasonable a Request: The Jonk freighted with Speckl'd Wood, Seraean Rice, several Packs of Linnen, Brown Su∣gar, Clap-Oyl, Namrak, Cambodia Nuts, Mann'd with three and twenty Moors, and four and fifty Chineses, bound to Japan, all Netherland Vessels are desir'd not to molest. Adventure of Harmas Klenk to the new Gover∣nor of Tapoan.After which the Advice-Boat brought news, that there was a Ship about the Point making towards Disma, which approaching the City Nangesaque, strook its Flag, which afterwards pull'd up again, blew from the Main-top, with a pendant waving under it. Indiik judg'd by these signs, that there was some Person of Quality in the said Ship; wherefore going into a Barge, he Row'd aboard, where coming he was no ways deceived of his expectation; for the Frigat carry'd the Lord Herman Klenk of Odesse, sent Governor to Tayoan, in stead of Frederick Cojet. Moreover Klenk inform'd him, that he weighed Anchor from Batavia the two and twentieth of June 1661. accompany'd with the Ship Lornen, in which was Jacob Casenbroad, chosen by the Indian Councel for Deputy-Governor of Tayoan, but had lost sight of one another the first day of their coming out. After that he chased a Portuguese Vessel, her bigness about an hundred and twenty Tun, coming from Cambodia to Macau, the Com∣mander of her call'd Lewis Baretto Lenel, being overtaken near Siampa, deli∣vered, both Ship and Goods without firing a Gun; out of which Klenk took the best Goods, and seventeen Portuguese, and put seven Chineses and eleven Blacks aboard of it; then anchoring before the Golden Lyons Island, he took in Provisions and fresh Water. He had news by the Inhabitants of the miserable condition of Formosa; but reaching Tayoan on the thirtieth of July, Cojet imme∣diately sent the Pilot Sicke Peterson in a Chinese Boat to him, to advise him, that it was no ways convenient for him to stay near Tayoan, because he might easily be taken by Coxenga, who had three hundred Sail ready upon any occasion, but to steer directly to Japan; whereupon Klenk deliver'd the Pilot the Papers sent by the Indian Councel, to carry them, though not without great danger, into Zelandia, and sent with him the seventeen Portuguese, then stood for Quelang, where he sent a Letter by some Chineses to the Governor of the Countrey; but receiving no Answer, proceeded in his Voyage to Japan; where by a great Storm in a dark Night being driven too near the Shore he ran great danger, being out of all hopes to get off, which God mercifully preventing, came safe with his Ship on the twentieth of August to Nangesaque. The Governor Ficojemondonne granted the new Tayoan Governor to come ashore that Night, the Frigat having Ship∣ped so much Water, that a great many Goods were damnifi'd by it. Klenk is nobly enter∣tain'd.Indiik being inform'd by the Interpreters, that Ficojemondonne had observ'd the Honor and Respects which were shewn to the chief Governor of Tayoan, he to
make his Reception the more splendid, sent for several Servants from aboard to increase the number of their Train, which the Japanners saw with great cu∣riosity. Chineses Relation con∣cerning Coxenga's Onset on Formosa, and how he murder'd his Uncle.After this the Netherland Interpreters were inform'd by the Chinese Traders at Nangesaque, that Savja Coxenga's Uncle had a long time had a private Design upon Formosa; and at one time he told some of his bosom Friends of it, who re∣lated it to Coxenga; he approving the Plot, resolv'd to put it in execution: Soon after the Business began, but Savja found himself deceiv'd: for he made no other account than to make himself Master of all on a sudden, when Storming the Fort Zelandia he lost abundance of Men, scarcity of Provisions, and sickness began also daily to increase in the Chinese Army, of which many dy'd. From these Inconveniences arose private Contentions, insomuch that Savja design'd to go privately with some Jonks from Formosa, and leave the farther manage∣ment thereof to Coxenga: but this also being discover'd, brought Savja to a mi∣serable end; for Coxenga being exceedingly enrag'd thereat, notwithstanding his Uncles good Service done, caus'd him in spight of a great part of his Army, to be chopp'd to pieces. The Lord of Facata vi∣sits Indiik.Soon after these tidings came the Lord of Facata with a great Train of Courtiers and meaner Servants to see the Ships Graveland and Hogland; where he was much delighted in seeing the Sea-men Dance and Leap over-board in∣to the Water to swim: And coming on Disma in the Netherlanders Store-house, Indiik shew'd him several European Rarities, and thank'd him for the honor which he did him in his Journey from Jedo through his Lordship to gesaque. Then conducted him to Klenk, the new Governor of Tayoan's Resi∣dence, where the Organs and other Instruments were play'd upon; and accor∣ding to his Request, the two Ladies Loenius and Boer were brought into the Chamber. And at the Lord Ficata's going away, the Ships Vallon hooren and Newport from Batavia fir'd several Guns. The next day Indiik receiv'd from the Lord of Facata's Servants four Casks of Sekje, or Japan-Wine, and two great Boxes, in one of which lay a Sea-Cat, the other was full of dry'd Cockle-shells. With the Bones of the Sea-Cat stamp'd to Powder,Strange operations of the Bones of a Sea-Cat. and mix'd with Spittle, the Japan Goldsmiths make Quicksilver malleable. It is remarkable to see how Iron, Lead, Steel, Tin, Copper and Silver swim on Quicksilver, whereas Gold onely sinks, and becomes of a Silver colour, which can onely be taken away by Fire; but not without a great Slink and smell to the by-standers. When the Japanners gild their Silver, they wash it over with Quicksilver, temper'd with the Bones of a Sea-Cat. Hollanders take Chinese Jonks.Indiik was inform'd that a Chinese Jonk, was taken about Poclo Cantacon, where she was declar'd free Prize, and thirty Hollanders put aboard of her by order of the Admiral Jacob Caeuw, whom they were to follow: but be∣cause the Water went very hollow in a Storm, the Fleet was forc'd to leave Caeuw, and steer to the Islands Piscadores: the Jonk endeavor'd to follow the same Course; but being driven to Leeward by South-west Winds, was necessi∣tated to stand directly for Nangesaque; before which Road the Dutch Comman∣der of her threw ten of the imprison'd Chineses over-board.Throw the Men over-board. The arrival of this Jonk occasion'd no small fear amongst the Chinese Traders at Nangesaque: but Ficojemondonne took but little notice thereof, because he was certainly inform'd of the treacherous dealings of Coxenga in Formosa: The conquer'd Jonk car∣ry'd four hundred Tun of excellent Rice. The Chineses in the Town stuck not to report, that they would have satisfaction for the Jonk, and also prevent the
Hollanders from using the Rice, that so for want of Provisions their Vessels might leave the Japan Coast, and so secure the Chinese Trade from future dan∣ger. But Indiik little regarded this their Discourse, because he was assur'd, that the Governor of Nangesaque would not concern himself in the Business, but re∣fer it all to the Court Jedo, where the Hollanders were full as well belov'd as the Chineses. The Lords of Firando and Arima visit the Hollan∣ders.After this the Lords of Firando and Arima, with a great Train visited the Dutch Governors Indiik and Klenk, by whom being kindly entertain'd, they sent them several Presents for their noble Treatment. Ficojemondonne also gave order to unlade the taken Jonk, in which was found, besides the Rice, a hundred sixty four Sacks of Salt-Petre, and a considerable Parcel of Tin and Lead; by which the Japanners trepann'd the Chineses in a Lye, who desir'd that the Jonk might be restor'd to them, because it was Freighted for Japan; of which the contrary appear'd: for the Rice being for Coxenga's hungry Army, the Salt-Petre to make Powder, and the Lead for Bullets, were no Commodities ever brought by them to Japan. Another rich Chinese Jonk taken.Not long after came also a Ship call'd The Red Hart from Tonquin, laden with the Goods of a Chinese Jonk, taken about Aynam, being richly laden with Pepper, Lead, Tin, Rice, Elephants Teeth, Alcatiffs, Linnen, and Rice, carry'd one and twenty Portuguese, fourteen Moors, and ten Chineses, which were left in the empty Ship to go whither they pleas'd. Mean while Sacquemondonne, one of the chief Magistrates in Nangesaque, visi∣ted Indiik in the Netherlanders Store-house in Disma, bringing a Saddle and Bridle with him, which had been lent by Harman Klenk to the Lord of Facata: the Magistrate desir'd in the foremention'd Lords behalf to have one made by it, that he might keep the same; for he could not find a Japanner that was able to match it. Indiik look'd upon this as a feigned Message, and onely a Business to search into the Hollanders intentions in taking the Chinese Jonks. But Sacquemondonne coming to Indiik said thus to him:A Discourse between Sacquemondonne and Indiik That he had long sought an opportunity to have some private Conference with him in the Island Disma, but till then he could never find a time to do it in, yet now both hapned: for the Lord of Facata had given him occasion, and the Governor leave: the honor of the Visit shewn by the Lords of Firando, Arima, and Facata, was grounded on real affection which they had for the Hollanders; and that it was to no other end, but to bewail their misfortunes which they had suffer'd by Coxenga 's means: this honor was a certain testimony, that the East-India Company was exceed∣ingly belov'd at the Emperors Court; for if his Imperial Majesty did not esteem the Hollanders, no Japan Lord would so much debase himself as to visit them, much less to send them Presents: and also Indiik could no ways be ignorant of the great Interest the Nangesaquean Governors had at Court, and their Fatherly inclination every where, express'd in the promoting of the Hollanders Trade, who being now at variance with Coxenga, had leave to do what mischief they could every where: But since he was the last time com∣manded in Jedo, in the Emperors Name by the Councel, not to pillage any Chinese Jonks, or molest that Trade, he could not but be suspected for diso∣beying their Orders: and fear'd that there would some inconvenience arise from plundering the Chinese Jonks; and if there could be no other way found by which the Differences between Coxenga and the Hollanders could be de∣cided?
Indiiks's Discourse with the Nangesaquean Magi∣strate.Indiik reply'd in the presence of Klenk and Lier, saying, The Visits and Presents of the Lord of Facata, Firando, and Arima, are sufficient to make the East-India Company think themselves obliged for the honor and bounty shewed to them: The Governor of Nangesaque's Favor, by whose means all things happen at Court according to the Hollanders desires, they esteem'd and priz'd exceedingly; and there could be no greater piece of ingratitude, than not to acknowledge it; wherefore they made it their whole study to respect, honor, and oblige the Governor of Nangesaque. Moreover they could not deny, but that they had promis'd the Councel in Jedo, not to take any Chinese Jonks; but those Promises were grounded upon the Peace then between the Hollanders and Coxenga; but since they had understood from the Itziban and Nibanfue (which in the Japan Tongue signifies the first and second Ship) that Coxenga without proclaiming a War, and without the least cause, had treacherously faln upon Formosa with forty thousand Men, that hath quite alter'd the case. All Peoples Laws granted free leave to resist force with force; so that a man doth not do mischief enough, though he useth his whole endeavors to spoil; and this is grounded on the Law of equal revenge. The whole Estate of Tayoan had been twice deliver'd in Writing to the Go∣vernor of Nangesaque, who had sent them to their Emperors Court; by which the Court was inform'd of the Hollanders Design to do all the mischief they could to Coxenga, which cannot be ill resented, because it is not contra∣ry to the foremention'd Promise. Moreover, there is also another way to make Coxenga change his bloody War into Peace, which hath already been made known to Ficojemondonne: for if by order of the Japan Emperor, the present, and hereafter the following Goods and Moneys taken out of the Chinese Jonks, should be kept by the Governor of Nangesaque, till Coxenga had satisfi'd the damage which he had done to the Hollanders, he would then soon come to an Agreement: Yet if this Proposal should be dislik'd by the Em∣peror, another way might still be found; for the Holland Men of War to spoil his Trade to the Manilla's, Nanquien, Japan, and other Places, so by that means impoverishing, force him to an Agreement; for what will that trea∣cherous Robber do, when the Havens to which he Trades are block'd up by the Hollanders? Father Discourse with SacquemondonneThe Magistrate Sacquemondonne observing Indiik's Answer, said, That the Hollanders had right in the taking of Chinese Jonks, but no Answer being come yet from the Emperor, they must forbear a while, that they might not incur the displeasure of the Court at Jedo. Indiik answer'd again, The East-India Company joyn all their Forces to∣gether to please and serve the Japan Empire, but if they should suffer such wrongs as Coxenga's, they would soon be ruin'd by not seeking to subdue their Enemies, who like a small Fire, at first is easily quench'd, but let alone destroys whole Cities. It is too late to seek revenge when an Ene∣my, by neglecting of time, grows still more and more powerful, and some∣times grows to that heighth, that he no ways values his Antagonist. How is it possible to subdue Coxenga, if his rich laden Jonks come home safe and un∣molested from all Places? is he not thereby enabled to do more mischief? who will give a mad Man his Sword to be slain by it himself? Sacquemondonne acknowledge, that all Indiiks Discourse was grounded on Reason, but was suspicious of the Chinese Jonks which lay richly laden in the Bay of Nangesaque: for if the Hollanders did not observe the Emperor's Com∣mands,
what could then be expected, but that they would be all made Prize by the Holland Ships, of which there then lay a considerable number there? Indiik soon resolv'd him of this doubt; The Holland Ships (said he) are to put to Sea on a set-day, their going away is certain, before the Chinese Jonks weigh Anchor. The Hollanders went on directly to the Place where they were sent, without looking after any. It might be true, several of their Fri∣gats Cruised to and again before Tayoan, and several Havens of China, waiting for the Jonks, and that which was done by those Ships he could not answer for, having no Command over them, as over those that lay at Nangesaque. Sacquemondonne taking great delight in this his Relation, promis'd to give an account thereof to the Governor of Nangesaque; and taking his leave, thank'd Indiik for his kind Entertainment. Discourse with the Han∣gesaquean Governor.Not long after Joffiesamma came home from Jedo, whom Indiik bad welcome by the Interpreters; which he kindly accepting, told the Interpreters, That he had receiv'd the news of Coxenga's treacherous Design on Formosa, which made him think that he should not have found any of the Hollanders Ships at Nangesaque; but before he came from thence he was inform'd to the contra∣ry, and now was very glad to see them himself. Moreover, he gave them leave to begin and make Sale of their Goods on the twenty eighth of September. And it seem'd to be no ill sign, that seven of the Japan Watch-Barques Row'd ashore, onely leaving three amongst nine Holland Ships, and one Jonk taken from the Chineses, whereas at other times a Barque full of Soldiers was always ty'd behind every Ship. Indiik visits the Gover∣nor.The twenty seventh of September, Indiik went with Klenk and Van Lier to visit the Governor Joffiedonne, and to congratulate his Return from Jedo. He also told him that Klenk was sent to be Governor of Formosa by the Indian Councel at Batavia; but finding all the Ways towards the Fort Zelandia block'd up by Coxenga's Vessels, that it was impossible for him to get in, came thither. Joffiedonne said, That he had seen the Relation at Jedo, written by Indiik con∣cerning Coxenga's treacherous Design, and that he long'd to see the event of the War in Formosa. Lastly Indiik told him, That Van Lier there present was sent to succeed him, hoping that he would be pleas'd to acknowledge him so: which Joffiedonne not onely accepted, but also promis'd to do all what he could to promote the Hollanders Trade. Strange adventure of the Sperwer Frigat, cast away on Quelpaerds-Isle.¶ SInce Indiik's departure, Anno 1661. from Nangesaque to Batavia, came thi∣ther in a small Vessel eight Hollanders, that had suffer'd Shipwrack in the Ship Sperwer; the remarkableness of the Accident merits our Relation. The Sperwer Frigat Sailing from Batavia the tenth of June 1653. Landed Cor∣nelius Keysar on Taoyan, to succeed Nicholas Verburg in his Place of Government: from thence the Frigat steer'd her Course for Japan; but overtaken by a great Storm, hapned in the night-time, to be driven near a small Island: the Cap∣tain thereof looking out at the Window spy'd the danger; wherefore he us'd all possible endeavors to come to an Anchor behind the Island, so to be out of the way of the hollow Seas; the design fell out according to his desire, but the Ship lying betwixt the Island and a great Riff (which breaking the Sea made it very rough) were forc'd to Ride very short at Anchor: the Day discover'd the Chinese Coast, which was so near them, that they could see People in Arms
stand on the Shore, seeming to stay there longing to see a miserable Shipwrack: two days the Storm continu'd, then growing calmer they weighed Anchor to get out of sight of the Chineses, which like hungry Wolves watch'd for a Prey, shewing themselves in great numbers: afterwards the Ship was driven by the Current between China and Formosa; but soon after the Storm blowing afresh, they were not able to carry out the least Sail till the Gusts were more favora∣ble: mean while the Ship being so miserably toss'd sprung a Leak, so that they could scarce keep her free with Pumping; sometimes a Sea beat over her in such a manner, that the Water could scarce find ways to run out again, seeming as if it would sink immediately. With these inconveniences came far greater; for towards the Evening a Sea wash'd away one of the Galleries, and soon after another the Head, so loosning the Boltsprit; yet they had not been in such great danger, had not the Ship rowl'd so extremely, and the Seas follow'd one another so suddenly: they judg'd it convenient to hale up their Mizin, and Sail before the Wind; the second Watch they discover'd Land, but the Ship in the dark was got within Musquet-shot of the Shore before they could see it: the steep Shore suffer'd the Ship to run against a Rock, which with three blows broke it into a thousand pieces, and of sixty four Men escap'd onely thirty six, most of which were miserably wounded by the sharp Rocks; those that lay in their Cabbins, being tir'd with watching, died all: amongst those that were sav'd was the Captain, Reinier Egbertson of Amsterdam. From the Wreck they sav'd one Barrel of Flower, one Barrel of Salt-Beef, some Pork, and a Rundlet of Tent, which prov'd very happily for the wounded. Moreover, they gather'd up as many Pieces of the Ship as would make them a Booth to defend them from the Weather; for they knew not in what Countrey they were, how call'd, or whether inhabited or not, because the Skie being Clouded for seve∣ral days, they could take no observation. On the second day after they suffer'd Shipwrack they saw a Man, whom they beckning to come to them ran away; soon after came three other, of which one carry'd a Musquet, the other two Bows and Arrows, which also fled from them; but one of the Sea-men running after them unarm'd, got some Fire, which they wanted extremely. Against the Evening their Tent, or Booth, was surrounded with above a hundred Men, wearing Hats made of Horse-hair. The next day came a small Army, being about two thousand Foot and Horse, while the Hollanders were making of a bigger Tent. The Commander of them fetch'd the Book-keeper Henry Haemel, with the Pilot, Quartermaster,Strange usage by the Core∣ans of thirty six Shiwrack∣ed Hollanders. and a Boy, out of the Booth, which were all four thrown down on the Earth before the General, at which the whole Army made a kind of strange noise. The Hollanders that remain'd in the Tent, believ'd certainly, that their Companions were put to a miserable death; but they us'd them not so cruelly: for the Coreans onely put an Iron Chain about their Necks, to which a great Bell was made fast under their Chin. Then some of the Offi∣cers went into the Booth, and had a great deal of Discourse which the Hollan∣ders understood not; but they signifi'd to them that they intended to go to Japan, but suffering Shipwrack they were come ashore there to save themselves. The Chineses look'd upon those Goods which they had sav'd, and finding onely a little Meal, Salt-Beef and Pork, they brought some Rice boyl'd in Water, which was a great refreshment. Not long continu'd their joy that they were not in a barren Countrey; for whilst they were eating, a great many of the Soldiers came running towards their Tent, every one holding a Rope in his
hand, which made the Hollanders think that they should be bound and kill'd: but this fear soon vanish'd, when the Coreans ran with all speed towards the Wreck, every one laboring to hale the Wood ashore, which burning they carry'd the Iron away. In the interim the Pilot taking an observation, found that it was Quelpaerds-Island where they had lost their Ship, and were in thirty three Degrees and thirty two Minutes Latitude. Moreover, the Coreans still busied themselves in haling ashore the Pieces of the Wreck, and burning it for the Iron; and lastly they set the whole Wreck on Fire, which might have cost them dear: for two Brass-Guns deeply loaden went off, but it so hapned, that the Muzzles of them lay towards the Sea: this Blow struck such a fear amongst them, that every one fled, and coming to the Hollanders, desir'd to know of them if it would do the like again; but they informing that there were no more Guns that were Charged in the Ship, they went on with their work. Moreover, the Hollanders visited the Governor of Quelpaerds-Isle, and present∣ed him with a Bottle of Tent, which pleas'd him so well, that he became very kind to them, sending them boyl'd Rice twice a day, and bid them come and see the punishment which would be inflicted on those that had robb'd the wreck'd Vessel. The Iron they had stole was tied to their Backs, and they themselves laid upon the Ground, receiv'd several Drubbings on the Balls of their Feet with a Stick about a Fathom long, and as thick as an ordinary Boy's Arm, so beating them unmercifully. Their Journey through Quelpaerds-Island.After this was over, the Hollanders had order to be gone with all their things; so travelling with a Guard of Foot and Horse, they went that day four Leagues, and Lodg'd in a small Town call'd Tadjunch, in an old Store-house: from thence they went to the City Moggan, where the Governor of Quelpaerds keeps his Court; here on a great Market place three thousand Armed Men were drawn up in Battel aray: The Governor caus'd Henry Hamell, with the Pilot and Quartermaster to come to him, and ask'd them where they were going? at which Hamel cry'd several times, Japan and Nangesaque; at which the Gover∣nor nodding his Head seem'd to understand it. The remaining Hollanders were also carry'd four and four to the Governor, Examin'd, and Lodg'd in a House, in which, as they afterwards understood, the Kings Uncle had a long time been kept Prisoner, and at last died there, because he endeavor'd to depose his Nephew. Every day they had their allowance of boyl'd Rice, wheaten Flower, and another strange Food which they could not eat, wherefore they liv'd most upon Rice. The Governor, a Man aged about seventy years, and of a noble Aspect, signifi'd to them, that he would Write to the King, to know what should be done with them, but it would be a considerable time before he could have an Answer; for the Place where the King kept his Court was thir∣teen Leagues over-Sea, and above twenty Leagues from Moggan: But whilst they waited for it, the Hollanders had fresh Meat allow'd them, and also leave for six at a time to walk abroad by turns. The Governor oftentimes invited them to his Palace, bidding them write their Names; and cur'd those that were wounded at their Landing; and also prepar'd several noble Dinners for them: In which kind Hospitality-the Heathens far exceed very many Chri∣stians. Strange adventure of a Hollander.But amongst several strange Adventures, that is most remarkable which hapned to the Book-keeper Hamel, Pilot, and Chirurgeon: These, as former∣ly, carry'd before the Governor, found a Man sitting by him with a red Beard,
and being ask'd if they knew not such a Man? they answer'd, That he seem'd to be a Hollander; at which the Governor fell a laughing: at last the red-Bearded Man discovering himself, ask'd them in the Dutch Tongue, what Peo∣ple they were? and whether they were going? at which the Hollanders were allamaz'd, but Hamel answering, said, That they Sail'd from Amsterdam to Batavia, and from Batavia to Japan; but since they left Formosa they were over∣taken by a mighty Storm, which drove the Sperwer Frigat, already torn and shatter'd, against the Rocks of the Island Quelpaerds.Hamel also ask'd him what he was? and although he had almost forgot his Native Tongue, yet he told him That he was born in a Village call'd De Riip in Holland, and nam'd John Johnson Welterre, and that Anno 1626. he Sail'd in a Ship from Amsterdam to the East-Indies; afterwards by order of the Indian Councel in Batavia Sail'd in the Ouwerkerk Ketch to Japan, but by contrary Winds forc'd upon the Coast of Corea, fresh Water began to grow very scant; wherefore (said he) I was commanded, with my Countreyman Derick Gerritson, and an Amster∣dammer call'd John Peterson Verbaest, to go ashore, to see if we could find any fresh Water: no sooner had we set foot ashore, but we were all three sur∣rounded and carry'd up into the Countrey to the King's Court, where ever since we have had Meat, Drink, and Clothing, but could never obtain leave to go with some Vessel or other to Japan: and though he had for several years entreated leave of the Court to depart, yet they had always one An∣swer, which was, That the King did not give leave to any Strangers to go out of his Kingdom: which Sentence all Hollanders, or what else soever they be, are sure to undergo. Moreover (said he) my two Companions died seventeen years ago, at the time when the Tartars invaded Corea. All which Discourse being Interpreted to the Governor, was written down and sent to the Court. Mean while the time came, in which the old Governor was to give place to the new; for every three years they observe change of Government amongst the Coreans. The old Lord had a very great inclination for the Hollanders; for before he went away he provided them against the next Winter, giving every one a Coat, a pair of Buskins and Stockings. He also return'd them the Books which he had taken from them; and gave them good store of Train-Oyl to burn in their Lamps at Night, promising them also at last, that he would use all the means possible at Court to obtain leave for their going to Japan. But the new Governor prov'd quite another Man, for he carry'd himself very strange to the Hollanders; and since the departure of the first Lord in the be∣ginning of January, Anno 1654. they wanted Provisions, being ty'd to very small allowance, which made their imprisonment very insufferable: wherefore since they had yet liberty to go out by sixes at a time, they searched daily if they could not find any Vessels lying near the Shore, with which they might in the Night make their Escape.Remarkable passage of five Hollanders. The last of April six Prisoners endeavor'd in the Night to get over the Wall; but discover'd by the Barking of the Dogs, which wakened the Watchmen, their Design took no effect. After which time the Pilot and five more resolv'd on the like Escape: These going out upon a Day which fell to their turn, found some distance from the City Moggan, hard by a small Village, a little Vessel with all Necessaries thereto belonging, where going aboard they hal'd it over a Bank in sight of the Villagers, which at first were amazed to see them; but afterwards observing that the Hollanders were in earnest they put off to Sea, gave notice thereof to the Owner, who with a Gun
charged came running after them in the Water, whilst they were busie setting up the Mast and Sail; but not being acquainted with the Corean Vessels, both Mast and Sail fell over-board; yet they got it up again, and put all things in their right place; when placing the Mast it broke out, so that it fell all again into the Sea, by which means they lost all hopes of escaping, driving more and more to the Shore, and exactly towards a Barque full of Armed Coreans, which they boarding, the five Hollanders leap'd over into the same, for the sixth could not get in; by this their leaping the Arm'd Barque shipp'd so much Wa∣ter, that they had enough to do to keep her from sinking: but when Landed, they carry'd the five Hollanders to the Governor, who caus'd them all to be loaden with Fetters, hung a Board about their Necks, on which he nail'd one of their Hands, and stripping them laid them on the Ground upon their Bellies, so ty∣ing them fast to four Posts, sent for the remaining Hollanders thither to see them: thus laid, the Governor caus'd the Interpreter Weltevree to ask them, If they had agreed upon their Escape without the knowledge of their Compani∣ons? or if they knew of their Design? How they durst venture to go in so small a Vessel without Water, Bread, or any other sustenance, through so vast an Ocean to Japan? The fetter'd Hollanders answer'd, That their Compani∣ons had not the least knowledge of their Design. Moreover, they would ra∣ther run all hazards whatsoever for their liberty, nay rather die, than undergo so many miseries, and at last be starv'd to death: which they had no sooner said, when an Executioner, standing in the middle of them, with a Stick a Fathom long, a Finger thick, and round on the top, gave every one twenty five blows on their bare Buttocks, that none of them in five Weeks were able to stir out of their Cabbins. Hollanders carry'd to Corea, and their chief Ad∣ventures.But whilst they lay in that misery, Orders came from the Corean Court, that the Hollanders divided into four Jonks should be sent fetter'd from Quelpaerds-Island to Corea: upon which the Governor began his Cruelties afresh, linking both their Feet and one hand together, fearing else they might conquer and carry away one of the Jonks, which indeed would have been hazardous if they had gone aboard unbound; and the more, because the Coreans are gene∣rally Sea-sick. Two days they were toss'd up and down at Sea, and not get∣ting the least Ground because of contrary Winds, they return'd to Moggan, where the Hollanders were put into their old Prison. ¶ THis Quelpaerds-Island reckons fifteen Leagues in its Circumference; hath on the North-side a convenient Harbor for Ships, and lies opposite from the South Promontory of Corea thirteen Leagues; the Passage to which is very dangerous, because the Water is full of blind Rocks, and no anchorage to be found betwixt that and Quelpaerds Haven; so that those Ships that are by a Storm, either out of the East or South-east driven from the Coast of Japan thi∣ther, are easily lost. This Island affords store of Provisions, is full of People, Horses and Cattel; in the middle a high Mountain, crown'd with Trees, seems to touch the Clouds: the lesser Hills have barren tops, yet the Valleys abound in Rice, Wheat, and Barley. Their remarkable Jour∣ney there.¶ AFter five days time, the Wind changing, the Hollanders as before, were again Shipp'd aboard of four Jonks, and getting to Corea at Sun-set, were carry'd ashore at the Sun-rising; where being furnish'd with Horses,
they all met together in the City Heinan, whither they came in four several Companies; for the four Jonks Landed them all in several Places. Whilst they Lodg'd in Heinan, the Governor Paul Johnson Kool died, having never en∣joy'd his health since he suffer'd Shipwrack. The Commander of their Guard gave order to bury the Corps: after which the Hollanders travell'd through the Cities Sansiang and Tiongop, and also by the great Castle Jypansangians, built up∣on a Rock: then they past the Town Tunge, and the great City Sendy, where some years ago the King of Corea kept his Court, but was now onely the Resi∣dence of a Vice-Roy. Going from hence they Lodg'd in Jesorn, the last City in the Territory Thielado. Lastly, after they had travell'd seventy Leagues, and besides the foremention'd Villages, pass'd through Lynjin, Jesaen and Consio, they came into the Royal City Sioor; where not long after they were Examin'd at Court by the Interpreter Weltevree; whereupon the Prisoners declaring their whole Adventure, at last begg'd that they might have leave to go for Japan, that they might once more see their Wives and Children: which their Request was deny'd, receiving this Answer, That the King never suffer'd any Stranger to go out of his Countrey, therefore they must not think of any thing, but to die in Corea. Soon after every Hollander receiv'd a small Board, with the King's Arms burnt on it, and every ones Name, Extract, and Office which he was to per∣form, Carv'd on the same in Corean Letters. Weltevree bore the Command as Sergeant over them all. An expert Soldier taught them to handle the Corean Arms, and whilst they were busie in learning this Martial Discipline, the Tar∣tars, according to their custom, came to fetch in his Revenues from Corea: whereupon the King sent the Hollanders to the strong Castle Nanna Sansiang, built on a Rock seven Leagues beyond Sioor, to which in time of need the King takes his flight. A strange undertaking of two Sea-men.When the Tartars went the second time out of Sioor, the chief Pilot Henry Johnson an Amsterdammer, and the Gunner Henry vander Boss also went out with them, under a pretence to cut some Wood for Fewel, but their Design was to intermeddle themselves with the Tartarian Horse, that if so they might find a Way home through Tartary: they stay'd therefore till the said Horsemen with the Corean Money were half pass'd by, then running amongst them, but were known by some Coreans that follow'd after, and re-taken, put close Prisoners, where not long after they dy'd. Their Companions could never be certainly inform'd if they dy'd a natural death, or whether they were Executed. During this time, news was brought to the King's Court, that another Ship was lost on Quelpaerds Island, wherefore three Hollanders that best understood the Corean Tongue were sent thither, because Weltevree being over-grown with Age, was not able to Travel. Lastly, The King grown weary of the Hollan∣ders, resolv'd to make them away by Murder, but the King's Brother begging their Lives, (as Weltevree inform'd them) they were sent to the strong Castle Thiellapeing, where they found the three Hollanders sent to Quelpaerds Island, here being a House provided, in which the thirty three Hollanders were Lodg'd. The Governor seem'd to have some small inclination for the Hollanders, but his Successor a hatred, forcing them to fetch Fuel three Leagues off, over the Hills, and kept those Clothes from them, which they were promis'd at the Corean Court, so that they endur'd extream cold, and were also very much plagued with Lice, which almost kill'd them; yet it happen'd at last, that half of the Prisoners had leave by turns to go a begging, whilst the other half staid at home, for the Coreans seldom deny any requir'd Alms, and chiefly the Priests, which
being there in great abundance, are very charitable. These kind of People en∣tertain'd them very courteously, the more, because they began to speak the Co∣rean Tongue, and related to them the Affairs of Europe and India, in which they took great pleasure. ¶ANno 1660. A new Governor succeeded the old one of Thiellapeing, he be∣ing of a quiet and mild disposition, Protested oftentimes, that if it were in his Power, he would release the Hollanders instantly.Famine in Corea. In the second Year arose a great Famine in Corea, the over-dry Seasons having so scorch'd the Ground, that thousands of People dy'd of Hunger, some eating Wild Herbs, others Barks of Trees; and had not the Valleys afforded them some Corn, most of the People had been Starv'd. The Hollanders bore no small share in this general Calamity. Their allowance which was given them by the King's Or∣der, being exceedingly pinch'd. In the interim, Order came from Court, that the two and twenty Hollanders, (for the rest dy'd of hardship) were to be divided into three Towns, twelve should go and live in Saysing, five at Sutsen, and as many more at Wammon, and whilst they suffer'd either more or less inconveniencies, according to the Dis∣positions of the Governors, which chang'd every three year, who either us'd them kind or cruelly, there appear'd two Blazing Stars, or Comets,Blazing Stars. about the latter end of 1664. The first appear'd in the South-East, the second in the South-West. These Signs struck the Coreans into a great Consternation, because the same were seen just before the Tartars Invaded them, and also when the Ja∣panners sent over their Forces thither. The Coreans therefore enquir'd of the Hol∣landers, What those Planets Prognosticated? What the Europeans thought of them? They answer'd, That experience had sufficiently taught, that those Stars were always very Prodigious Signs, generally threatning War, Famine, or Sickness. The King exceedingly amaz'd, Fortifi'd all his Towns, Castles, and Bulwarks, with double Watches; and forbad strictly, that none living near the Sea-side should burn Lights at Night. Remarkable passage of eight Holland Prisoners.¶ BUt the Hollanders at last found a way to make their escape, they having a long time before gather'd some Moneys together, for which they in∣tended to buy an old Fishermans Barque; it being subtilly contriv'd, to make their Landlord believe, that they would now and then go to the small Islands before Corea, to fetch Cotton from thence, of which he should have his share. This Proposal was very well approv'd of by the Coreans, so buying a small Ves∣sel, he gave it to the Hollanders, who, what e're they could catch, whether Sails, Anchors, or Provisions, in the Night carry'd them Aboard, and whilst they were thus busie, preparing for their departure, the Chyrurgeon Matthew Bokken, Cornelius Derickson, and John Pieterson de Uries, came from the City Sutsen to visit their Countreymen in Saysing. These being made acquainted with the Design, forwarded it with all diligence, and indeed it fell out very fortunately, for De Uries was exceeding well experienc'd in the Art of Navigation. The fourth of September, Anno 1666. they began their Voyage eight of them, being Henry Ha∣mel, Goverard Dionys, John Pieterson de Uries, Garret Johnson, Matthew Bokken, Corne∣lius Derickson, Benedict Clark, and Dionys Govertson, first clambering over the Walls of Saysings, and getting Aboard, Weigh'd Anchor about Ebbing Water, and set∣ting of the Moon, they furnish'd themselves with Water at a small Island near Corea, and in the dark, Sail'd thorow all the Jonks of War: In this passage they
strook Sail, that so they might not be discover'd, and fell to Work with their Oars, till they lost sight of Corea; so Steering South-East, they went right be∣fore the Wind, and in a short time got to the Westward of Goto, where the Wind blowing very fierce, they came to an Anchor; here whilst they Rode fast, a small Vessel with six Men, every one Arm'd with two Swords, came Sailing by them, and put one of her Men a Shore, which causing some suspicion in them, made them Weigh Anchor, and endeavor to put off again to Sea; but the foresaid Vessel prevented them, by making signs, that they must strike their Sail, and come farther up into the Haven; at which the Hollanders cry'd, Hol∣lande, Nangesaque, whilst they were Tow'd to the Shore, and surrounded with a great many Boats. The Japanners took two Men out of the Corean Barque, which went a Shore where all things were in an uprore; and about Midnight, a great Barque came Rowing close by their sides, which inform'd them of the Arrival of the Holland Ships at Nangesaque, which made them take fresh courage, as well as the Japan∣ners, furnishing them with Provisions for nothing; who also cover'd the Core∣an Barque, which had no shelter with Mats against the continual Rain. The four∣teenth of September, after thirteen years Imprisonment, they came to their Coun∣treymen on the Island Disma, to their great admiration. Zelderen's Journey.¶ BUt the Journey which Van Zelderen made from Nangesaque to the Empe∣ror, is better worthy of our Observation; who having kept his day of Sale in November, with all manner of Drugs, Scarlets, Hats, Looking-Glasses, Elants or Buff-Skins, Musk, Cotton, and other Commodities in Silver Dishes, plac'd on the long Table, standing in the middle of the Gallery in the Hollanders Store-house, which is (as we said) divided into three hundred Rooms, and four Streets, standing on the Island Disma, by a narrow Channel, separated from the City Nangesaque; above Stairs live the Servants belonging to the East-India Company, below lie the Merchandizes in several Apartments, the Locks of which are Seal'd up with the Emperors Arms, in the presence of a Nangesaque Magistrate, who daily Dines in the Store-house, at the first Table, where he is serv'd all with Plate. Mountains about Nange∣saque.¶ Moreover, Nangesaque lies between exceeding high Mountains, which are cut thorow very artificially with Walls, so that the Water in the In∣clos'd Parks is at that command, that every one lets in what he pleases, because they can either stop, or let in the Water which comes running down the Hills. But though Nangesaque in this Point is much Indebted to Art, much more she ought to thank Nature, that the Soil about it abounds with Rice, Wheat, and all manner of Plants.Their Citizens Martial-Discipline. About October, the Nangesaquean Citizens are always up in Arms, and March thorow the City, every Precinct makes a particular Com∣pany, before which, the Arms of every ones Employment are carry'd, not without great State: None dare Discharge a Gun for fear of Fire; a Souldier is held in very great esteem amongst the Japanners, for he may visit a Merchant in his Shirt, and if he should not be Saluted by him with bowing his Head and Hands to the Ground, he is sure to be soundly beaten. But much more abominable and horrid is the Custom of Murthering Children, especially Girls, for the Parents that think their Children troublesome to them, throw the Females (ty'd to a bundle of Straw) in the Water, and drown them. The Boys are deliver'd to the Emperors Officers, which Train them up in Martial Discipline.
view of Cangoxuma (Kagoshima) CANGOXUMA
¶ BUt the Holland Ambassador prosecuting his Voyage to Jedo, was over∣taken by a stiff Gale out of the North-East in the Corean Ocean,Description of the migh∣ty City Congoxuma. that running right before it with her Fore-Sail, he soon arriv'd in the Haven of Con∣goxuma, and dropt Anchor before the Beacon-Hill, which was first, with the Approbation of the Japanners, built by the Portuguese, at the time when they drove a free Trade there. Congoxuma is the first City, where the Portuguese Landed, and got footing in Japan, by the means of a Japan Youth, call'd Angier, who fearing the cruelty of his Persecutors, secur'd himself in a Japan Cloyster, where he made his escape to Malacca, whither he Sail'd in a Merchant-Man, Commanded by the Portugal George Alvares, Anno 1547. The Jesuit Francis Xaverius coming acquainted with him there, he not long after went with him to Congoxuma, where being kindly Entertain'd by Angier's Friends, he had an opportunity to Plant the Roman Re∣ligion. After this, the Portuguese made this City Congoxuma their Staple, for which it lay very convenient in the Kingdom of Saxuma; the foresaid Beacon square on the top, with a Turn'd Ball, stands on a thick Cedar Pole, supported with two great pieces of Timber, which on the top are fasten'd to the Pole with great Iron Hooks; a high Ladder, of which the Rounds jet out beyond the sides, stands against, and leads up to it; below is a Watch-house, and on the other side several Houses built on the hanging of the Mountain; onely in some pla∣ces the tops of the Houses appear above the Hills. This Beacon, Sea-men can discover about seven Leagues off at Sea, because the Rock on which it stands is of an excessive height; at the Foot thereof, a little towards one side is a Fishers Village, and before that, good Ground to Anchor in, close under the Shore. Reception of the Hol∣land Ambassador.¶ THe Holland Ambassador Sail'd in a stately Jonk towards the City against a swift flowing River, which comes along thorow the mid∣dle of Congoxuma, from a Harboring Mountain, and runs into the Corean Ocean. The speedy Current of the Rhone in France, or the Donaw in Hungary, flow but slowly in comparison of this, which passeth thorow Coxenga. The Jonk in which the Ambassador was, had two Masts, between which stood a Tent, or rather a Cabbin on six Pillars, the edges adorn'd with Gilded Imagery; before on her Bow, hung two Anchors. Thus he Sail'd in, between steep and high Rocks, of which, some terrifi'd the Beholders as they were passing by them. Within the Harbor appears a strong and Artificial Water-Castle, built by On∣goschio, the Emperor Chongon's Grand-Father, when he design'd to take the Crown from Fideri Taicosama's Son; because Congoxuma was a place of great concern to him; for this City is not onely the Key of the Province Saxuma, but of all Bungo. This Water-Castle rais'd out of the Sea with Free-Stones, is square, with many Redouts, like the European Bulwarks. Here is kept a strong Garrison, where the Ships pay Custom. Moreover, the Stone-Causey made up out of the Sea, and along the Rails on both sides Plated with Copper, de∣serves no small admiration. This Causey leads from the Water-Castle, to two great Watch-houses, the Out-walls of which rest on the said Causey, and have an excellent Prospect of all the Haven, each of them Garrison'd with five hundred of the Emperors Souldiers, which have a continual eye with those in the Water-Castle on all Transactions, because the King of Saxuma hath often∣times
boldly taken up Arms against the Emperor, refusing to pay him the usual Tribute, but still been brought to reason; yet notwithstanding his bad For∣tune, he would now and then take fresh Courage, and receive more Losses: between the Watch-houses and the Mountain, on the North-side of the City is a convenient Harbor, in which the Jonks and other Vessels in great numbers come to an Anchor, or are moor'd to the Shore: Close by are the City Store-Houses, built on a Stone-Wall, rais'd out of the Water, in the middle whereof is a large square Gate, with the Stairs of Free-Stone, that descend into the Ha∣ven, at which all the Goods and Merchandizes that are brought to Coxenga, are Landed and carry'd into the City. The Store-houses on the North-side of the Gate; consists of four spacious Halls; but that which is on the other side hath a double Roof, and fourteen large Rooms, besides Garrets. Between the North Store-house, and the Watch-houses, the River flows out of the City into the Haven, and is adorn'd on one side with brave large Custom-houses, in which, Art shews its Master-piece, no Charge having been spar'd in the building of them; here the Ships must pay a second Custom, which brings in a great Re∣venue yearly to the Emperor. Japan Temple, in which ley wash their dead.¶ BUt opposite to these Toll-houses, appears a stately Temple, in which the Bodies of Dead Persons are plac'd, for some days before they are burnt, after the Japan manner. The Bonzies belonging thereto, get vast Sums of Money, especially from the rich People, for cleansing of the dead Bodies, that they may appear the more acceptable to their Gods, Amida, Canon, or any other whom they chiefly serv'd in their Life time. This kind of Custom of keeping the Dead Bodies Unbury'd for some time, to cleanse and then to burn them, hath been in use a long time in the World; for the Ancient Romans and Greeks observ'd such a Custom with their Dead,In Phenissis. before the Birth of our Saviour. The Greek Tragedy written by Euripides brings in King Creon, saying: I will withdraw, that so Jocasta may From her Sons body, cleanse the filth away. I understand that the Dardanian Illyrians (saith Aelian) are wash'd three times,Aeliani var. Hist. l. 4. c. 1. once when born, a second time when Marry'd, and lastly, when they are dead. The Jews also observ'd this Washing of Dead Bodies, St. Luke saith of Tabytha, And it came to pass in those days,Act 9.37. that she was sick and dy'd; whom when they had wash'd, they laid in an upper Chamber. The Embalming of Dead Bodies is full as Ancient. Tacitus, Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Pomponius Mela, Cicero, Sextus Philosophus, Lucian, and other Ancient Greek and Latin Writers ascribe the first Embalming of the Dead to the Egyptians; with which Opinion the Gospel agrees; for Mo∣ses relates, that the Patriarchs Jacob and Joseph were Embalm'd by the Egypti∣ans: And Joseph commanded his Servants the Physitians to Embalm his Father:Gen. 50.2, 3, 26. and the Physitians Embalmed Ifrael. And forty days were fulfilled for him (for so are fulfilled the days of those that are Embalmed) and the Egyptians mourned for him three∣score and ten days. And Joseph died being a hundred and ten years old, and they Embal∣med him, and he was put in a Coffin. Sextus Philosophus tells us,Pyrrbn. Hypothes. 6.24. That the Egyptians took out the Bowels of the de∣ceas'd Bodies, and fill'd them with Balsom, and other Perfumes, to preserve them from stinking and rotting, and kept them in their Houses, letting them at the Table with them:Syl. Ital. l. 12. Of which the Latin Poet Sylvius Italicus saith thus:
Egypt Embalms her Dead with rich Perfumes, And then at Feasts gives them the chiefest Rooms. Nay, they oftentimes gave the dead Bodies of their Parents or near Rela∣tions as a Security to their Creditors, which if they did not release whilst they liv'd, might not (saith Lucian) be buried. Moreover they us'd for their Embalming Salt, Cedar-Oyl Honey, Wax, Myrrhe, Chalk, Lime, Asphalt, and Nitre. The Washing of Bodies was perform'd by the Roman and Greek Women. Plato brings in Socrates saying,In Phadono. It is convenient before I drink the Poyson that I wash my self, that I may not leave any thing to do for the Women, to wash me after I am dead. The Japanners seem also to have learnt from the Romans, That the prepara∣tions for the Burial are to be perform'd in the Temples, for all things necessa∣ry for Funerals were to be had for Money in the Temple of Libitina, Goddess of the Dead. And according to the establishment of the Roman King Numa Pompi∣lius, every one was bound to throw certain Sums of Money into the Treasury of Juno Lucina, when ever they had a Child born, and also when any one dy'd, into a Pot, Consecrated to Venus Libitina: But the Embalming of Dead Bodies was perform'd by Men. Moreover, not far from this Temple, towards the City, are several Stone Store-houses against Fire, in which the Treasures of all the Province of Saxuma are kept, and are once a year, by the Emperors Forces fetch'd to Osacca; be∣tween these Buildings and the Water-Castle stands a fair Temple, to which the Countrey People come daily in great numbers, there to Pray for a Blessing on their Plants, Trees, and Cattel, to which they shew Reverence, almost like the Romans and Greeks, who in former times us'd to honor their Idol Pan with a Goats Face and Bucks Feet, as a Deity plac'd over all Herdsmen and Hunters; and also to the Fauni, they attributed Horns, and Horses Feet, to whom they sa∣crific'd a Goat; as likewise Milk to Sylvanus, God of their Forests; And in like manner, to Bacchus, the God of Wine; the Deform'd Priapus of the Gardens; Ce∣res, the Corn Deity, and Oreades, of the Mountains. Further description of Congoxuma.But on the South side of the River, which flows thorow Congoxuma, the City spreads it self, running up against a high Mountain, and is hid, for the most part, behind the Rock, on which the Beacon stands. Then again, on the hang∣ing of a Hill, about the middle, in the South part of the City, stands a large Temple, whose Roof appears above all the Houses, exceeding costly within. The King of Saxuma going thither, was made, and receiv'd into the Orders of the Bonzi, so to save his Life, which he had forfeited, because he refus'd to pay Presents, and rebell'd against the Emperor. Moreover, in the East part of Con∣goxuma, near the foot of a Mountain, is the place of Execution, Inclos'd within a Stone Wall. Whilst the Holland Ambassador staid to refresh himself here, being every where kindly entertain'd, he saw eleven Japanners, and three Portuguese, being Christians, Nail'd on Crosses, and Roasted by a gentle Fire. Four Leagues from Coxenga, towards the North-West, appears a Mountain, whose top reaches above the Clouds, and is taken for the highest in the World, except the Mountain Tereyra, on the Island Tenariff, for it is a general Opinion, that that is nearest to the Heavens, and Vomits forth Fire and Brimstone above the Clouds.
¶ THe Holland Ambassador finding the Weather fairer, and the Wind grown calmer, proceeded on his Voyage, and past at last by the Vil∣lage Umbra, and in the like still Weather, reach'd Mongy, where he came to an Anchor: When soon after the Inhabitants came to him with all manner of Provision; from thence, Sailing between several small Isles, which in great abundance lie scatter'd before Dungo, he got so much ground, that against the. Evening he Sail'd into the Bay of Nanatzjamma:Zeldron's further Jour∣ney. But now, his Voyage going on more slowly, the Ambassador Anchor'd on the eleventh day in the Haven of Cammenosacci; over against which lies an Island inhabited by a considerable number of Fishermen: Here the Seamen exchang'd Silk Peelings for Silver Flower-Pots of Wyer-Work, made so artificially, that no Countrey in the World can make the like; here they also got all manner of fresh Pro∣visions. Not long staid the Holland Ambassador at Cammenosacci, but Weighing An∣chor in the Night, Sail'd between the small Islands Camro, Jore, and Szuwa, and Anchor'd near the Village Caroto, lying to the South of the main Coast of Japan. The Inhabitants of this place furnish'd them with exceeding good Locusts, which kind of Food was us'd above two thousand years ago amongst the Indi∣ans and other Eastern People, and held in great esteem. Aelian relates,l. 14. de Animal c. 13. That the Indian King had always a certain Dish of Worms, that grew in a Plant, and were Roasted. John Manardus relates, That in India he saw the like Stuff, mixt with Rice, which Food the Inhabitants love extreamly. Sir John Mandevil saw three hundred years ago, the Princes on the Island Ta∣lache, making good Cheer with Wood Worms. This kind of Food also was accounted a great Dainty amongst the Romans,l. 17. c. 19. and chiefly those Worms that grew in Oaken-Trees, which being taken, and brought up with Meal, were accounted a very choice Dish. Moreover, The Souldiers which went with the Emperor, Charles the Fifth, from Ferrara to Tunis, (as Brasavolus relates) observ'd, that the Africans liv'd on raw Locusts. Besides the Locusts, the Holland Ambassador got for his Retinue, a Cow, which was kill'd in the Village Caroto, and some Goats, which thereabouts are taken in abundance. Thus refresh'd, he Sail'd about the Islands Caminagari, and Jocosima, to Tantonomi, a Village full of fair Buildings, and Populous, lying on a Promontory of the Main Coast of Japan; where they Ferry over to Tonsa, and where one of the Emperors Custom-Houses stands, which brings in above forty thousand Rials of Silver yearly. Description of the City Mewarry.¶ THe Ambassador hasting his Voyage, reach'd the high Point of Mewar∣ry, where he was quite becalm'd; four Sea-men and a Japan Inter∣preter had leave to go a Shore here, where they found a City built on Hilly Ground, round about which lay many pleasant Meadows that abound with Corn and Rice, but chiefly with Plum-Trees, the Fruit whereof Preserv'd, were sent all over Japan, to use in their Drink, Tee, and Tzia. The Citizens of Mewarry look'd very strange upon the Hollanders, having seldom or never seen any of them before. The Japanners Opinion of the deceased Souls.Some of his Retinue desir'd of the Japan Interpreter to see some of the Tem∣ples in Mewarry, which were sixteen in number, but it was not a convenient time,
because the Inhabitants there that day kept a Festival, for the departed Souls. The whole City was in a Hurry, every one was in his best Apparel, carrying his Idol out of the City, to the Graves of their nearest Relations; where the Idol being set down, both young and old fell on their Faces to Worship it, and Pray'd very earnestly, that Amida, Xaca, Canon, or any other god (for every one serves whom he list) would be pleas'd to shew Mercy to the Souls of their De∣ceas'd Friends, that they might not be tortur'd with those that dy'd wickedly, in the boyling Waters of Singok, but that they might be carry'd, and remain in the place of Everlasting Happiness. Moreover, they believe, that the Souls of the Deceas'd, for some years, wander up and down about their Graves. This Office of Sacrificing and Praying for the Dead, is generally perform'd by the young Men out of the City; and when they have done, every one takes up his Idol, and go one after another into the City, after the manner of a Pro∣cession: But in their return, they talk to themselves, as if they had a Soul that walk'd with them, with which they hold a very serious Discourse. And thus they continue till they come to their Houses, where they prepare all manner of Dainties for the Soul; some place the Dishes with Meat under their Pent-Houses, others upon the Roof, where they let it stand about half an hour, then fetching it in, and setting it up very safe, the young Men run Hooting and Hollowing out of the City, striking in the Air with Boughs of Trees, so (as they say) to drive the Souls of the Deceas'd back again to their Graves: Then taking Breath, they return home, where they spend the whole Night in all manner of Lasciviousness: But this Ceremony which they use to the Souls, are observ'd several ways in Japan, for in other places (as we have at large de∣scrib'd before) they throw Stones against, and on the top of the Houses, so to drive the Souls back to their Graves. Furthermore, The King of the Province Mewarry keeps a brave Court in this City: Next to which is a Seraglio, wherein, a considerable number of Ladies are kept for his Concubines. Against the Evening, the four Hollanders and the Interpreter being Aboard again, they made Sail, and Steer'd between several Isles to Binga, a fair City, which appears with several Turrets and high Tem∣ples: Against the Evening, they Stem'd with the Island Sinoja, and in the Morn∣ing had sight of Fibi, when a stiff Gale out of the North drove them more to the South-ward; so that soon after they came near Margan Rocks, which rise very high out of the Sea; on the highest of them lies a curious neat Town; below which the Rock is very artificially hewn out, for a convenient Haven against all Winds whatsoever: Here the Ambassador drop'd Anchor, and when grown somewhat calmer, stood out again, but could not reach beyond Fibi, how∣ever, at Night he got to Dasacci; and although the Storm began to blow afresh, yet next day he got to Ousimata, from whence he Sail'd over to Wota, where he lay at an Anchor all Night, and in the Morning Weighing, got to the Banks before Muro, where he ran a ground, the Barque giving a great blow, and had without doubt burst asunder, had not the Wind blown off from the Shore, so that ha∣ling out all their Sails, they at last got off, and afterwards judg'd it convenient to fall down to the Island Jesima, so to get into a deeper Water. On Jesima, as also on all the other little Islands, stood a Beacon,Beacons. built four and twenty years before, upon an occasion (which the Japan Interpreter related) being at the time when the Islands of Bungo and Saykok rebell'd against the Emperor, and made the Water between Japan and Tonsa very dangerous by their Piracy; wherefore the Islanders, so soon as ever they descry'd any Ships from their Beacons,
gave notice thereof to the Main-Land, by fireing them in the Night, or making a great Smoke in the day time; whereupon they immediately Guar∣ded the Sea-Shore, and sent off several Vessels well Man'd; since which time they observ'd the same Custom with their Beacons, either in bad Weather, or when any one endeavors to make his escape, that hath by some means or other incur'd the Emperors displeasure. On which occasions a certain sign is given, so that he who thought to save himself by flight, seldom es∣capes, notwithstanding he suddenly gets into some Haven or other; for the Water between Bungo, Tonsa, and the Main-Coast of Japan, from Simonisac∣ci to Osacca, is full of little Islands, on every one of which stands a Bea∣con, Guarded and continually Watch'd by two Men, that have three Shil∣lings a day. Pleasant Scituation of Swoja,The Holland Ambassador, after he left Jesima, Steer'd his Course Easterly, and drop'd Anchor in the Haven which washes Swoja; where going Ashore, he found the Countrey thereabouts so exceeding pleasant, that the whole Earth cannot shew a finer spot of Ground. How much have the Romans cry'd up the Countrey about Capua, which yields Fruit twice a year, where there is a disputable difference, whether the Ground be Fruitfuller that produces Corn or Vines? The Greeks also spent much time in describing the famous Tempe in Thes∣salie: But certainly both Tempe and Campania, may not be compar'd to the plea∣santness of Swoja, which is on the South Wash'd by the Ocean, that makes a con∣venient Harbor, having against Northern Storms a high Shore; against Eastern, the Promontory of Saccai; and against Western, the mighty Island Tonsa; and the high Rocks on the South-Shore break the violence of the Waves, when at any time a South Wind blows the Billows against the Shore. Moreover, round about the City, the Countrey is exceeding delightful, because of the several Growths with which it is adorn'd. In some places the Ground being Hilly, is Crown'd with shady Trees; in others the Valleys abound with all manner of Plants; there are Plow'd Fields; here pleasant Meadows full of Oxen and Sheep. The City Swoja it self, very curiously built, hath many great Store∣houses, in which the Merchandize from all places are laid, to be transported thence to Osacca, Saccai, Miaco, and other places of Trade. The Ambassador Zelderen unladed some Hart and Buck Skins here, whilst the Sea-men went to see the Neighboring Town Akas, because the Citizens of Swoja related a strange Story of an accident, which for the most part ruin'd that Town. And indeed, when they came thither,Ruine of the Town Akas. they found above half of Akas lying desolate, some Houses being faln in, others sunk into the Ground, yet others appear'd with some part of them lying on the Earth, but the other part stood in a pretty good condition. The Inhabitants whereof told them, That not long since, a terrible Earthquake shook the Earth two days together, then the Flames broke forth betwixt the crack'd Earth, as if it would have devour'd all things; and lastly, there arose such a Fog, that choak'd many. Not far from this, lies a Sulphurous burning Mountain, whose Subterranean Fire having consum'd the Earth, at last broke forth. The Emperor Toxogunsa∣ma allow'd them some of his Revenues, to Re-build that part of the Town which was so harras'd. ¶ THe Holland Ambassador leaving the Haven of Swoja, Sail'd within a Musquet Shot of Fiungo, then ply'd up to reach Sacca, but the Wind blowing hard out of the North-East, he was driven back to Avans, where he

run great danger, having much to do to save himself from running against a high Rock, which they could not have scap'd, had not the Wind come about to the North-West; wherefore Haling in all their Sails, they Steer'd towards Saccai, where they came to an Anchor. This is not onely a handsome, but an antient City, surrounded with a strong Wall. The Japan Emperor hath in all his Fortifications plac'd Overseers, whose Offices are to look after the repairing of the Walls, and putting in new Stones so soon as they see any one begin to decay: Whilst they Rode here at Anchor, the Ambassador Zelderen saw a Japanner,Japanner drowns him∣self. who having great Stones ty'd about his Neck, Legs, and Middle, leaping into the Water, drown'd himself for the honor of Canon. The Vessel in which he was brought from the Shore, was immediately burnt, being too Holy to be us'd thereafter for any Worldly Affairs. Description of the Am∣bassadors Reception in Me∣aco.¶ THe Holland Ambassador hasting on his Voyage, and passing by Osac∣ca, came to an Anchor close under Miaco, whereinto he was con∣ducted in great State: The foremost that came were eight hundred Horsemen on well-train'd Steeds, every one Arm'd with a Bow and Quiver full of Ar∣rows, a long Pike, two Swords, a large Cutting-Knife, a Helmet, and Waxt Buskins, by the Japanners call'd Taepjes; Behind them, came two Japan Officers Riding one by another; the Emperors Standard-Bearer follow'd, holding a long Staff, at the end whereof Wav'd a great Flag, representing on Embroy∣der'd Gold and Silver round O's, and five pointed Stars, and below the O's a half Moon, a Snails Horn, three Stars, and the Flower Toxangpenung: Then came seven Men playing on Pipes, and six with Trumpets; behind these follow'd five on Horseback, beating on Kettle-Drums; then a great square Canopy was brought by four Supporters, under which Rode one who held the Empe∣rors and the City Meaco's Arms, before his Breast, on the Horses Neck; next fol∣low'd several Musicians, Playing on all manner of Instruments: Lastly, came the Governor, sitting in a very costly Coach, the Wheels Waxt and Gilt,Great State of the Go∣vernor of Meaco. went slow∣ly about, between which were two great Oval Openings, and two other, but much lesser; the Curtains very handsome, being of Flower'd Silk, on the top were two Gilded Dragons, who with their fore Feet hold a Coat of Arms; the four Corners were adorn'd with Turn'd Cups, the Coachman holding a Pike with a Gilded Star at the end of it, in his left Hand, and in his right, four Reins, which came thorow as many Holes of the Axel-Tree ; he sate with his Legs under him on a square Seat, cover'd with Flower'd Silk; behind the Coach also sate three Musicians, on each side went several Servants with Fans; The four Horses which drew the Coach, were led by four Persons of Quality; the Governor looking out sometimes between the Curtains, all those that saw him fell down with their Faces flat on the Ground, just behind the Coach came a Guard of Souldiers, half of them carrying Pikes, and the other half Musquets, which were follow'd by a Merchant, richly Cloth'd, his Horses Head whereon he Was Mounted, adorn'd with a stately Plume of Feathers; some distance af∣ter him, a Sedan, or rather a Throne was carry'd by fourteen Gentlemen, se∣ven going on each side, carry'd a long Pole, to which the Sedan was made fast on their Shoulders; this Throne having an ascent of five steps, on a Square, each corner supported by a curious Turn'd Post, about every one of which Silk Curtains were ty'd, the Covering also of Silk, was adorn'd with Fringe. In this Sedan, two of the Magistrates of Meaco were carry'd, then follow'd seve∣ral
other ordinary Sedans with Noblemen; and last of all, Rode divers Troops of Horse: The Holland Ambassador receiv'd in this State, Rode to∣wards the City. Description of Meaco.¶ The first Gate of the City Meaco, hath three Entrances, whereof the mid∣dlemost is the biggest, built between a Free-Stone-Wall; the inner Gate is one Story high, from whose Roof Stream'd a Flag with the Citie-Arms. Miaco, by the Japanners also call'd Cabucoma, and Cocquay, contain'd for∣merly in its Circumference one and twenty Miles, but is since, by the Civil Wars, become above a third part less, yet at this day it reckons above eighty thousand Families, divided into the upper and lower City; the lower spreads it self to Fissima, and is so costly built, that one Edifice seems to be above a Mile long. In the upper Miaco, the Dayro with his Cungies (that is, Counsellors) keeps a stately Court; himself looks like a Savage, being never Shav'd, nor his Nails par'd; besides, five Eminent Colledges in the City, there are five Free-Schools more about Miaco, viz. Coja, Wegru, Franzon, Homi, and Bandu, every one of which hath above three thousand five hundred Scholars, which are there taught the Arts of Rhetorick, Oratory, Histonography, Astronomy, Poetry, and Arithmetick. Strange Tree.Here grow Palm Trees, of whose Juyce the Japanners make an excellent Drink; the Root digg'd up and dry'd in the Sun, then Planted again, in a short time will grow to be another Tree. Not far from Miaco, the Mountain Frenojamma riseth with its spiring top to∣wards the Clouds. Peter Davity tells us of a very strange Mountain, seen in the Kingdom Jetchu, which Flames continually. In the Meacomean Lake is a Fish not unlike a Poor-Jack, which the Japanners dry and send to all parts of the Countrey:Pet. Davity in his Descri∣ption of Asia. The foresaid Davity relates also, That the French King, Lewis the thirteenth, had tasted of them. Strange Graves in Japan.Moreover, here as in most places of Japan are several Tombs or Graves, rais'd of Free-Stone, about two Foot high, in which being hollow, the Friends to the Deceas'd often times lay Water and raw Rice, which the poor People or Birds fetch from thence. They also strow the Graves with Flowers, and Boughs of Trees. Taicosama's Court.¶ VEry admirable is the Palace which Taicosama built in Miaco, in which hang a thousand Pieces of Tapistry, Embroyder'd with Gold ; just before the Palace is a spacious open Court, in the middle of which stands a Theatre, where they Act both Tragedies and Comedies; on every side there∣of stand four Turrets, each four Stories high: The Houses and Apartments are for the most part built of Wood, yet handsome to behold. They seldom Build of Stone, because the Earthquakes are so frequent in Japan, and though often times whole Villages, nay, Cities are burnt down, yet they all Build again of Timber,Wood in Japan. wherewith the Woods furnish them plentifully; for they not onely produce ordinary Timber, but also White Wood, not unlike that, of which in Europe we make Virginals; besides all manner of Fruit-Trees, and tall Cedars, whose lofty Crowns seem to salute the Skies: The Cedars are us'd most for Pillars, and Masts. The Japanners have strange Orders when a Fire happens in the Night, for the Street in which the Fire is, must help themselves, for none else will
come near to assist them; by which means, many times the Fire gets such a head, that the Flame consumes all before it. IN Meaco, as in most other places of Japan, they drive a great Trade, in far better order than in any part of Europe; for it is no small help or benefit, that all the Japan Lordships, Dukedoms, and Provinces have one Mea∣sure, both for wet and dry Goods. Their Measure, call'd Ichin,Japan Measure. is six Rhyneland Feet long, divided into six greater, and sixty lesser parts, of else every Foot in∣to ten Inches: From this Ichin they make their Ell call'd Issiack, which is ex∣actly the sixth part of the Ichin; but the Issiack hath also ten great, and sixty lesser parts; the tenths are call'd Isson; ten Issons make an Itsiebou, and six Itsie∣bous one Ichin; which Measure all Shop-keepers use, and is so exact, that it differs not a Hairs breadth. Their Streets and Miles.All the Streets in Japan, as well in the Cities as in the Countrey Villages, are of an equal length, viz. sixty Jekjens, or Ichins, that is, thirty Rhyneland Rods; sixty Streets make a Japan Mile, or a thousand eight hundred Rods. In the High-ways, at every Miles end, are little round Hillocks, thrown up by Men employ'd for that purpose, on which they plant four high Trees, which are great Guides and Helps to Travellers. Japan Weight.Moreover, the Japan Weight is full as exact as their Measure, which consist of Fiaekin, being a hundred and twenty five Dutch Pounds; one Fiaekin makes a hundred Cattys; one Catty, sixteen Taile; one Taile, ten Maes; one Maes, ten Coudryn; one Coudryn, ten Rinnen. Japan Coyn very strange.The same order they observe with their Coyn. The Mint-Master coyns no Money, either of Copper, Silver, or Gold, but every Merchant goes to the Farmers of the Metal-Mines, of whom he buyes the gross Silver and Gold as cheap as he can, then makes it of an exact weight, according to the Emperors Order; then he delivers the Pieces to the Emperors Officers of the Mint, which meet on certain days, to weigh the Money which is brought in to them; whether it be full weight; and if it wants but half a Grain, they cut it in the middle, and so return it to the Owner: Those that are weight, the Officers mark with their Stamp; which done, it must be tried and weigh'd twice more; for although they shew the Stamp, that the Money wants nothing in weight, yet it is not passable: Wherefore the Merchant delivers it to Officers appointed for that purpose, to try whether it be not mix'd, but true Metal, who when they find but the lead mixture in it, they also cut it to pieces, and give it again to the Owners; but if it endures the proof, it is carried to the Masters of the Mint, who then weighing it again, Coyn it; which done, it may be paid away; for if any way it should chance to be too light, it may neither be receiv'd nor paid by any, on forfeiture of all their Estates. Strange way of Trading in Japan.Moreover, their paying of Money is very strange; for the Japanners having great store of Gold and Silver, observe a Custom to receive their Money without telling or seeing it. The Mint-Master puts the Gold in Papers, which contain the value of two hundred Pound Sterling; these seal'd up, pass from one to another without being question'd. They also use little Wooden Boxes, in which they put twenty seal'd Papers of Gold, which is as much as a Man can handsomly carry; every Box amounts to four thousand pound Sterling: And the like Boxes, but of another fashion, they use for their Silver, in every one of which lies twelve hundred Crowns, and is seal'd with the Coyners Seal: But doth it not seem strange, that never any deceit is found in that blind Way of paying of Money?
Japan Gold and Silver Coyn.Furthermore, the Japanners have but three sorts of Gold Coyn; the biggest Piece whereof is worth sixty Crowns; the second, eight; the third, two. The Silver, though weigh'd and coyn'd, is of no certain value; for the Coyn∣ers put it together into little Packs worth sixty Crowns. Their Copper Coyn hath a square Hole in the middle, through which a String being put, and several of them tied together, pass for ordinary things amongst the Com∣mon People. In the uppermost Eastern Parts of Japan, no Coyn passes for Merchan∣dize but Gold; yet at Nangesaque, amongst the Foreign Traders, they tender their Payments for the most part in Silver, because they may not carry any Gold out of the Countrey, being contrary to the Emperors Order: Where∣fore the Emperor, amongst other Reasons, took a great dislike against the Por∣tuguese, because they transported several Tun of Gold out of his Dominions. ¶ THe Holland Ambassador leaving Meaco, travell'd along the Foot of the Mountain Frenojama, through Oets, to Jesi, lying at a Lake about eighteen Leagues long, out of which the River that flows through Meaco and Osacca into the Sea, hath its Original. Zelderen being desir'd in Jesi to see the pleasant Mountain Pauromama, lying near the said Lake, East-North-East from Jesi, durst not deny the Invitation; but was carried thither in a stately Barge, with two Masts,Japan Barque. each with a square Sail: When the Wind fail'd them, the Japanners row'd with broad-leav'd Oars: On her Bowe hung two Anchors: In the middle of the Barque was a square Seat, resting on four Posts, through which the Main-Mast went. the sides of the Seat were adorn'd with gilded Imagery; on the top of it the Japan Sea-men handed their Main-Sail; under it sate the Holland Ambassador, bare-headed, attended on each side by Japan∣ners, holding a Fan in their Hands. Before the Barque row'd a Japan Boat, in which the Ambassadors Men play'd on their Trumpets. In few Hours they got together to the Mountain Pauromama, where they found several Barques, with long Pennons streaming from their Masts, riding at Anchor. At the Foot of the Mountain, on the Shore, stands a fair Portal, on both sides sup∣ported with square Pillars; the Gates thereof open in the middle: A Wall of great Free-stone runs near the Water-side, for a Defence to the Governors House, a very stately Building, though it is not seen afar off, because hid be∣hind some part of the Mountain. Near this House are several others, inhabi∣ted by Gentlemen, and other meaner People, all inclos'd in the foremention'd Wall. Description of the Moun∣tain Pauromama.The Mountain it self is very steep, and of a great height; but hath many Juttings out, along which, winding Stairs lead to the top, where stands a Temple inhabited by the Bonzi, which having three Roofs, seems to be but small, because it stands an exceeding height, from whence several Japan Towns and Cities may be seen, as namely, Itzibe, Minacutz, Zintzsamma, Cusatz, Ta∣monizu, Jesi, Oets, Meaco, Fissima, Jonda, Firaskatta; Uchats, Vinari, Micava, and many other Places. Half way between this Temple and the Governors House, stands the Residence for the Emperors Soldiers, built on a Promontory, being several Houses. On the right side, in the hanging of the Mountain, the Go∣vernor hath a curious Garden, the Trees whereof being planted one above another, seem to see themselves in the Lake. In the middle of the Garden stands a stately Banquetting-house: On the left side, where the Mountain runs sloaping into the Lake, stood four Huts, inhabited by Rusticks. More∣over,
Pauromama or Mount of Pleasure. Pauromama VRIUGDENBERG
over, the Mountain is so well stor'd with Trees and other Plants, that the World can scarce shew a pleasanter place. The Greeks boast much of Thes∣saly, surrounded with Hills and Mountains; for to the North lyes Olympus, to the South Othrys, to the West Pindus, and to the East Ossa and Pelion. Strabo tells us, That the Mountains Olympus and Ossa were separated by an Earthquake; and that the space between made a Bay for the Stream Peneus, into which se∣veral Rivers flow, that from thence run through the Valleys of Tempe, made pleasant by the rising Hills. It is scarce to be credited how the Roman and Greek Poets tired themselves in describing this Tempe: Yet notwithstanding all, it falls much short of the Pleasantness of the Mountain Pauromama. The Ambassador Zelderen's Gentleman-Usher took an exact Draught of the Mountain, from the Barge which was made fast to the Governors Water-gate; and having just finish'd it, the Lord Basuro Micondono, which came with Zelde∣ren from Jesi to Pauromama, came walking towards him, and spent a considera∣ble time in viewing of the Draught. Generousness of the Ja∣panners.The Holland Ambassador was most sumptuously entertain'd, after the Japan manner; for the People in this part of the Countrey are exceeding generous, the Children themselves being ambitious of nothing so much as getting a good Name, and striving to out-do one another in Courtesies. No Japanner fears any danger where he is belov'd. It is very seldom that a Man of any Repute will curse his Enemies, because he rather chuses to revenge his Cause with the Sword than Tongue. When any one desires another to be his Se∣cond in an unequal Match, they never refuse it, though it cost both Life and Fortune. ¶ SOon after Zelderen proceeded in his Journey to Jedo, which was very pleasant, and seem'd the shorter for the remarkable Stories which the Japan Interpreter now and then related concerning it: Amongst others, he told them, That some years since he saw the Temple of the Idol Topan,Strange Idol Topan. whose Image stood on a Copper Altar cast like Clouds; himself Arm'd like a Warrier, a Coronet Helmet on his Head, his Hand grasping a mighty Club, so seeming to fly through the Sky, and moving his Club to occasion Thun∣der. When it thunder'd, a Bonzi whose Head was adorn'd with Consecra∣ted Leaves, which no Thunder could harm, offer'd several Fishes. To this Relation, the Interpreter added a second, not without many Cir∣cumstances:Strange Relation of the Idol Fotoques. Not many Years ago (said he) the Island Bungo lay joyn'd to the Main Coast of Japan, so that the People could go afoot from Cokero to Simonisicci; when it chanc'd, that some Thieves had stoln the Golden Image in the Night from the Temple of Fotoques, at which Fotoques was exceeding∣ly enrag'd. The Thieves living about Cokero, hid the Image in their Caves, so that the Malefactors were not known: But Fotoques taking it as a great disgrace, and very hainously, rent Bungo from the main Coast of Japan, and swallow'd up a whole Tract of Land, so that the Sea between Japan and Tonsa ever since was united with the Corean Ocean. In the interim, he took great care of his Image; for he caus'd it, though of pure Gold, to swim like Wood, and carried it through the Sea to the Island Mettogamona, where driving ashore, it was taken up and put in a Temple, and is there to this day Religiously worshipp'd. Not far from Mettogamma (said the Interpreter) lies an exceeding high Mountain, opposite to the Island Moeko, on the top of which stand several
Temples,Wonderful Opinion of the Japanners concerning the Creation. which may be seen a great distance off at Sea: In these Temples the Bonzies worshipp'd that great God, which formerly not onely Created the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but also the fifteen lesser Deities which some Ages since convers'd upon the Earth. The Prime God commanded the Substitute Gods that they should make a Brazen Egg, in which they were to enclose the four Elements, Water, Earth, Air, and Fire, and also the four principal Colours, Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green. Out of this Egg the four Ele∣ments and Colours being tempred ran together, in such a nature, that the visible World appear'd. The World thus created, Man was wanting: Not long after, a Woman growing in the Shell of a Callabash, had no Soul, which the Chief God pittying, made a Stier come to the Callabash, who through his Nostrils blew Breath into the Callabash, which came to be a Soul in the grow∣ing Woman; who then coming forth, was familiar with the inferior Deities, by which means Mankind not onely increas'd in number, but also in wick∣edness, differing more and more from their Heavenly Extract, growing still worse and worse, mocking at Thunder, Rainbowes, and Fire; nay, they blasphem'd the great God himself (whom when the Interpreter nam'd, he bow'd his Head to the Ground) whereupon he call'd his inferior Deities about him, telling them, That he resolv'd to destroy and ruine all things, kick the Sun, Moon, and Stars out of the Firmament, mix the Air and Wa∣ter together, and make a round Globe, in which the four Elements should be all resolv'd into their former Mass: And chiefly he commanded the Idol Topan to make Thunderballs to shoot through the Air, and fire all the King∣doms with Lightning; which was no sooner said, but it was done, the whole World on a sudden lying together like a heap of Rubbish, so that none were saved, except one Man and his Family, that had entertain'd and duely worshipp'd the Gods. The Chief and Supreme Deity. took care in this general Ruine for the innocent Man, locking him in a deep Cave, be∣fore which he put a great Shell, that the Water might not run into the Pit or Cave. Japanners acknowledge the Fall of Adam, and the Hood.Who doth not observe by this Discourse, that the remotest Heathens acknow∣ledge, though darkly, the fall of Adam and the Flood, in which Noah and his nearest. Relations were sav'd? The Romans and Greeks also represented the same in their Golden, Silver, Copper, and Iron Ages; and also with Deucalion and Pyrrha, strangely preserv'd from a Deluge. The foremention'd Japan In∣terpreter judg'd that the Portuguese, Castilians, English, and Hollanders, had also their Original from the Man that was secur'd in the Cave against the Flood; the Reasons of which his Discourse, were grounded on these Arguments: When (said he) the Supreme God destroy'd all things, yet Nipon, that is, Ja∣pan; Mangy, so they call China; and the Kingdom Lechy, bordering on China, were preserv'd; therefore the Inhabitants differ much from those of Europe, because they have not such great Heads, nor such Camosie Noses, hollow Eyes, broad Eye-brows, and well compact Bodies as the Japanners. Strange Relation of the Japan Interpreter. Moreover, the vertuous Man got out of his Cave, when the Idol Canon call'd back the Seas to their respective Bounds, and Topan gather'd the scat∣ter'd Thunderbolts together; and setled himself in the Province Koejelang, where he got several Children, which intermarrying grew to a considerable number. But when these Generations increas'd so fast, the Gods which were commanded up to Heaven, ask'd leave of the Supreme Deity that they might return again to the Earth, and there be familiar with Men;

which being granted them, they descended into a pleasant Wood, where whilst they were consulting how they should best take the Venison, the In∣habitants of Koejelang joyning their Heads together, said, These are the Gods which drown'd our Forefathers; let its take Revenge for so hainous a Crime: And considering which way it might best be done, they judg'd that the readiest would be to set Fire on all parts of the Wood, which in few Hours consu∣med all the Trees: Some of the Gods that went to escape from the Flame, were cut to pieces by the People that had encompass'd the Wood; others were burnt; yet seven of them getting up to Heaven, complain'd of that execrable Plot to the Chief God, who being exceedingly enrag'd at so great a piece of Villany, immediately commanded an Angel, whom he im∣power'd, to punish them for their Crime. The Angel no sooner descend∣ed, but he drove the Offenders out of the Province Koejelang, to the Boyling Waters at Singock, in which they are continually tortur'd, without the least respite or cessation. Holland Ambassadors re∣ception at Mia.¶ MEan while the Holland Ambassador proceeded forward on his Jour∣hey, and Ferried over from Quano to Mia; where he had no sooner landed the Emperors Presents, but the Governor of Mia, with a considerable Train of People, came out of the City to receive and conduct him. Just without the Gate several Copper Basons were hung on cross Poles, on which the Japanners tabering, made a great noise. Moreover, several Norimons or Se∣dans were carried towards the Water-side, every one guarded with a conside∣rable number of Soldiers. At the foot of a high Rock stood the Ambassadors four Trumpets, each of them sounding a Levit. The Governor Obirham Gian∣todono had no sooner gotten sight of the Ambassador, but stepping out of his Sedan, he went to meet him, and bow'd himfelf after the Japan manner to the Ground. Behind stood some of the Guard with Musquets, others with Pikes and Halberds. Lastly, the Ambassador going from hence, soon after arriv'd at Jedo, where having staid some time, and dispatch'd his Business, he had leave to go for Nangesaque again. Description of a Whale.¶ NEar Firando he found the Whale-Fishers, which go yearly to Corea to catch Whales. The bigness of these Sea-monsters is to be most ad∣mir'd; their Pizzles being generally fourteen Foot long, which they hide in their Bellies: When they couple, they rage with Lust, holding their Bellies together, and embracing one another with their Fins, above an Hour at a time; after which, according to Julius Caesar Scaliger,Dist. c. 13. sect. 150 they bear their Young ten Months. The ordinary Whales are commonly a hundred and twenty Foot long, and their Heads are the third part of their Body: On their Noses are two round Holes, at which they suck in abundance of Water, and spout it out again an exceeding height: Their Eyes are three Yards long, and a Foot and a half broad: Their Ears, with which they hear any small noise, are less without than within; they open their Mouths five Fathom wide; their Tongue, eighteen Foot long, and ten broad, rests on eight hundred Supporters full of downy Hair. The Whale-catchers seldom find any thing in their ripp'd-up Bowels, more than some handfuls of Sea-Spiders and Weeds, though it is known that they feed on Fish; for a Whale hath been taken that hath had forty
Cods in his Belly. It may with reason be believ'd, that since the Passage of their Throats is but narrow, they chew all that they eat. The Females bear their Youg till grown to the bigness of a Cow, which continually keeps under its Dams Fins, and forsakes her not till she Spawns. Although they give Suck, they have no outward Teats or Dugs; for they are plac'd near the Womb, and so full of Milk, that (as Francis Rondeletius relates to have seen on the Coast of Acquitain) great Wine-Vessels were fill'd with it, suck'd from a stranded Female Whale. Moreover, it is very strange to observe the great Inclination between a Whale, and a little Fish call'd a Trusch, which swims continually before it, whose Eyes, by reason of his great Eye-lids, often dazel, and gives him notice when he is too near a Shelf or Rock:Lib. 2. in Eutropium. Of which Claudian the Latin Poet saith thus; Thus would the Whale run against Rocks and Sands, But that his Guide such Prejudice withstands, Leading the Monster through the Surging Sea, And with his Tail shewing a ready Way. But whereas the Fish call'd Trusch bears a great Inclination towards the Whale; so on the contrary, the Tonny, and Dolphin, but especially the Sword∣fish, have a general Animosity against him; for the Sword-fish getting under him, rents up his Belly, and creeping in, eats out his Tongue; from whence it comes, that dead Whales are oftentimes found floating without a Tongue. Pliny tells us,Lib. 3. cap. 34. That these Monsters do not only sleep in the Night, but seem as if they were dead, lying with their Heads out of the Water to breathe. It is very remarkable to observe the Natural Affection which the Males have for the Females, which was generally taken notice of, when Anno 1577. fourteen of them came before the Village Terheide in Holland, of which one being a Fe∣male, hapning to get fast on the Shore, the Male with great force threw abun∣dance of Water to her, so if possible to get her afloat; but all being in vain, she sticking too fast in the Sands, he also swam towards her, where they were both kill'd and taken by the Fishermen. No less is the Inclination which the Dam hath for her Young; for when it is in danger of running against Rocks or Shelves, she catches it up in her Mouth. Manner of Whale-fishing at Nagesaque.The Japanners that inhabit Firando, catch the Whales near Corea, same manner as the Hollanders take them before Greenland, and Spitsbergen: So soon as they discover them, they go thither in small Boats, carrying Harping-Irons with them; which being full of retorted Hooks, they strike the Whale in the sides of the Head: At the end of the Harping-Iron is a Line two hundred Fathom long. The Fish thus wounded, immediately bounces towards the Ground; whereupon they give him still more and more Line. If the Line should chance to be foul of any thing, it would certainly over-set the Boat. At the end of the Rope hangs a Barrel, which driving on the top they follow; but it oftentimes happens, that the Whale sinking too deep, hides both Line and Barrel. At other times he lies rolling on the Ground, or comes driving dead up again: If he chanceth to be yet living, they pierce his Sides with Lances, which the Whale feeling, makes so great a bustle, that the Seamen run no small hazard of losing their Lives. The dead Fish is either tow'd to the Ship, or towards the Shore, where the Feet being cut off with great Knives,
freights their Vessels, which afterwards being boyl'd at Firando, is sent to all parts of Japan. ¶ BUt Holland Ambassador passing by Meaco, soon after arriv'd at Nan∣gesaque, where he kept the usual Day of Sale, which was publish'd by setting up of Bills, that all the Merchandize was to be sold on the Island Disma in Nangesaque; which they proclaim'd by tabering on large Copper Ba∣sons: Whereupon the Merchants consulting together, every one wrote in roll'd up Papers at what Prices he would have the Hollanders Commodities; the one not knowing what Rate the other hath set down, the Bonjoises, to which the Notes are deliver'd, open them; and those that they find to bid most, receive the Goods; after which the Payment immediately follows, ei∣ther in Boats of Silver, or seal'd Papers of Coyn'd Silver; which Payments are so just, that there is not the least fraud in any of them; for if it should be found out, the Trader would not onely lose his Life, but also his whole Fami∣ly, and twenty of his Neighbors, five on each side of his House, and ten of those that liv'd opposite against him. For the Landing and Shipping of the Goods, a considerable Number of La∣borers are constantly employ'd, which all come before the Hollanders Store∣house on Disma, where the Bonjois throws as many Pieces of Wood, mark'd with the East-India Companies Arms, out of the Window, as there are occasi∣on for Laborers. It is pleasant to behold how the Multitude scrambles, every one endeavoring to get a piece of Wood; Boxing, Wrastling, and all other Robustious Exercises, being free at that time. He that gets one of these Pie∣ces, sticks it at his Girdle, which being shew'd to the Bonjoises, he hath order to work at a set Price. Departure of Ships from Nangesaque.In October the Ships that go for Batavia, and so from thence for Holland, weigh Anchor from Nangesaque: Soon after follow the Ships that are sent to Malacca, Surrat, Cormandel, and other Indian Coasts. So soon as the Rudder is hung, and their Ammunition aboard, the Ships must be gone, although the Goods lie above Decks in the Rain, and the Wind and Weather be contrary. If the Hollanders stay but ever so little time, they are immediately encompass'd with a hundred well-mann'd Boats, which cut their Cable, and tow their Ship beyond the Priest-Mountain, where from September to April blows a stiff Norther∣ly Wind, so that the Ships in a very short time lose sight of Japan. Description of Tonkin.¶ TWo Ships, or at least one, goes yearly from Nangesaque to Tonquin, be∣fore which City lies a dangerous Shelf, running thirty Leagues in∣to the Sea. The City it self is about the bigness of Amsterdam; the Gates and Bridges built of Alabaster, are comely to behold. In this Place is much Silk and Musk, which they truck for Scarlets, Linnen, and Ambergreece: The Alabaster they load for Ballast. The Kings Palace, before which the Holland Ships ride at Anchor, is very costly: The King himself serv'd by three hun∣dred Concubines. No Prince in the World hath better Troops of Horse than he; the Horses so curiously shaped, that they may well compare with those of Turky or Hungary. The Men sit bowing forward, holding a round Shield in their Hand, with a Box or Flask full of Bullets and Powder tied on the right side: Their Arms are naked up to the Elbows; on their Helmets they wear Plumes of Feathers: Whilst the King eats, they beat on Kettle-drums before his Hall. The Inhabitants freely proffer their Daughters to the Hollanders to vitiate them.
Description of Malacca.¶ SOme Ships that sail from Nangesaque, go for Malacca; which City lies on an even Shore, being about three Miles in length, well seated for Conveniency of Trade, and cut through with a River, made passa∣ble by a fair Bridge, over which the Citizens come to one another. At the time when Alphonsus Albuquerque re-took the famous City Goa for Emanuel King of Portugal, the Arabian Mamud King of Malacca had contrary to his Oath set upon some Portuguese, and kept them close Prisoners: But Albuquerque hasting to Malacca to release them, met in his way with a Malacca General call'd Naodabeguca, who setting upon them, bought his Death dearly, falling down at last with a hundred gaping Wounds on the Ground: It occa∣sion'd no small wonder,Strange Wonder of a wounded Malaccan. that not one of them bled a drop; but so soon as a Golden Armlet was taken from him, the Blood gush'd forth from all parts in great abundance, so that Naodabeguca instantly gave up the Ghost. The Priso∣ners inform'd, that a Bone of the Beast call'd Cabim was inclos'd in the Armlet, by whose Power the Blood was stopp'd. Strange Wedding-house.¶ MAmud's Daughter marrying to the Prince of the Panenses, kept her Wedding in Malacca: The Nuptial Ceremonies were perform'd in great State: A great House, or moving Castle, built on thirty Wheels, and hung with rich Tapestry, was by Elephants drawn through the City; within stood the Tables cover'd, and the Guests, sung, danced, and acted all manner of pleasant Pastime. Whilst thus Malacca was in the height of its pleasure, Albuquerque brought his Fleet into the Harbor, and demanded the delivery of the Portuguese Priso∣ners, which Mamud out of fear deliver'd him; yet the Portuguese set the City on Fire,Malacca on Fire. and not thus satisfied, Albuquerque would have a place in the City to build a Castle, that they might drive their Trade without fear: Moreover, he demanded the Damage and Charges which the Fleet had cost preparing, be∣cause it was done purposely for this Expedition. The Kings Son, and Son-in-Law, cry'd out, They would venture the utmost of it, which though the Event prov'd never so bad, could not be worse than the insufferable high Am∣bition of the Portuguese. Thus the two young Princes perswaded Mamud to take up Arms, who otherwise would have bought Peace, though on unequal Terms. Whereupon with speed raising some Fortifications, but chiefly guarding the Bridge that went over the River with Men and Arms, he carried out his Elephants with Towers full of Soldiers, to hinder the Landing of the Portu∣guese;Valiant Fight. yet they, notwithstanding all his resistance, Landed, John Lima march∣ing directly on towards the smallest part of the City, where the Kings Palace stood, and also a Mahumetan Temple, but hapned to fall in amongst Mamud's Son Alodyn's Soldiers, which occasion'd a fierce Battel for a considerable time, when Mamud himself came with his Elephants on the Backs of the Portuguese; wherefore Lima facing about with a part of his Men, broke their Ranks, and wounded their Elephants, who returning amongst their own Army, made such a Rout, that they tumbled one over another, every one then seeking which way to fly. Mamud being cruelly wounded, sav'd himself by flight: Alodyn also began to give ground. But Albuquerque found so great Resistance at the Bridge, that he sounded a Retreat; yet a few days after he renew'd the Fight, when it fortun'd much better; for although Mamud had undermin'd the Streets, so to blow up the
Portuguese with Powder, yet they being inform'd of it, went along another way into the City, led by Albuquerque, whilst Anthony Abreus made himself Ma∣ster of the Bridge. But Albuquerque ran great danger; for the Malaccans keeping close together in their narrow Streets, made fierce resistance; the Women and Children throwing Stones, and other combustible things, out of their Windows; yet at last he forc'd them to fly, raising a Bulwark at each end of the conquer'd Bridge, and cover'd the same over on the top with Sails, to keep off the Heat of the Sun. Mamud running into the Woods, there died of Grief. Great Booty in Malacca.The City it self was given to the Soldiers for Booty, of which the fifth part should be preserv'd for Emanuel King of Portugal, whose part amounted to two hundred thousand Golden Crowns. Albuquerque building a strong Castle here, gave the Command of it to Rho∣derick Palatyn. Treachery in the Fort.But not long after, Alodyn had like to have made himself Master of the new Fort by Treachery; for one Maxelys, extracted from Bengala, made particular ac∣quaintance with Alphonsus Persona Treasurer of the Castle, Alodyn giving Maxelys a good Sum of Money, that he should admit Soldiers, in Merchants Apparel, to murder and kill all the Garrison; which he had done, had not Persona, though mortally wounded behind by Maxelys, retain'd so much strength, that he got open his Door, and cry'd out, Treason. Matelief's Voyage.¶ AFter this, the Portuguese liv'd here undisturb'd, till Cornelius Matelief, sail∣ing from the Texel, Anno 1605. with eleven Ships, Mann'd with thir∣teen hundred fifty seven Men, fetch'd four great Ships out of the Haven of Ma∣lacca, rais'd a Platform on Pulo Malacca, and landed seven hundred Men, which made the Portuguese retreat to their Suburbs, fortified with a strong Wall; and out of their Suburbs, which were set on fire, into the City. Malacca it self the Portuguese had so fortified with wide Trenches, strong Forts, Gates, and Towers, that it would easily endure a great Siege: John de Patuan King of Jor, brought some Assistance to them; but those Countrey People were neither fit to work, for laziness; nor to fight, for fainthearted∣ness. Malacca besieg'd.In the interim Matelief rais'd another Platform, against the corner of the City-Trench, from which he fired continually. In the City died daily above forty People, of Hunger and noysom Smells: But the Besiegers also suffer'd almost as great Inconveniences, not only a great Sickness hapning among them, but being lodg'd under the open Canopy of Heaven, were miserably stung by the Wasps, so that continual waking had quite tired them; yet they took fresh Courage, when two Ships came from Holland, with two hundred forty five Men, to their Assistance: But soon after the little Sung Frigat discover'd the Portuguese Fleet sent to relieve Malacca. The Fight between the Hollanders and Portuguese.Matelief being inform'd thereof, fetch'd his Guns from the Platforms aboard, brake up the Siege, and prepar'd himself for an Engagement. The next Morning the Fight began, near the Promontory Rachabo: Both Parties lost each of them two Ships; but Matelief's Gun-powder growing short, he resolv'd to clap them aboard, and enter. Calm Weather twice hinder'd their valiant Design, and the third time the Portuguese taking advantage of the dark Night, fled to Malacca, where they came to an Anchor close under the
Shore. The Hollanders Fleet wanting all Necessaries, steer'd for the Kingdom of Jor, there to get such Provision as was to be had: but the chiefest which they wanted, being Gunpowder, Jor could no ways furnish them withal: Yet the Hollanders not willing to leave their Business half undone, resolv'd (come of it what would) to fall upon the Portuguese Fleet that Rode at an Anchor under Malacca. In the first Engagement Matelief conquer'd four of the greatest Gal∣lions; in the second, three. The Hollanders also burnt no small number of their little Vessels; so that the great Fleet, which consisted of sixteen Gallions, four Galleys, fourteen Foysts, and one Carvil, Mann'd with three thousand seven hundred Portuguese, and above twice as many more Indians (at which the Kingdoms Achien, Jor, Pahan, and Patama trembled,) had nothing remain∣ing but a few ruin'd Ships, by a small Fleet. Hollanders Trade to Bengala,Moreover, the Hollanders also drive a vast Trade to Bengala. Anno 1659. the King's Brother march'd with a mighty Army against the King to the great pre∣judice of this mighty Kingdom.Great Broyls there. The Rebel had such great assistance, that it wanted little but the King had lost both Life and Crown, had not the East-India Company furnish'd him privately with all manner of Ammunition from Batavia: But whilst the King's Party was a long time threatned with ruine, the Hollanders secur'd all their rich Commodities in the Ship Avenhorn. The Hollanders Staple is in Ongli, where the English also keep a Store-house. But the King of Bengala, in return for the Aid he receiv'd from Batavia, hath given the Hollanders so great Priviledges, that the English effect but little there. Their Residence is up in the Countrey near the famous River Ganges. The Hollanders Store-house, built of Stone, is fortifi'd by a strong Fort with twelve Guns, and very deep and broad Trenches, upon one side of it are a hundred Huts made of Straw and Leaves, by the Natives call'd Gabbegalbes. These Leaves are three Foot and a half long, three Fingers broad, sharp at the ends, and prove convenient shelters against the Weather. Bengala Merchants go very handsom in Apparel.¶ THe Bengala Merchants go very richly Clothed; their Hair cut very short they cover with a Ribbon of white Cotton, commonly fifty Yards long: they wear short Whiskers, but their Beards hang down to their Breast; their upper Garment is a Coat of fine white Linnen, Laced before with white Silk Ribbon, and about their Waste a Silk Girdle, hanging down under their right Arm; their Breeches are not unlike the Chineses, and their red Shoes agree with the Moors. The ordinary Man goes bare-headed, with a Cloth thrown about his middle, and a pair of narrow Breeches; Shoes and Stock∣ings they use none. Their Women go with their Breasts bare, and their Hair hangs over their Shoulders, tied up in Locks. Trade in Bengala.¶ THe East-India Company barter in Bengala, Japan Silver, Copper, wax'd Chests, and Tin, which Malacca produces, and also Quicksilver, Scarlet, and all sorts of Netherland Stuffs; likewise Nutmegs, Pepper, Mace, Cloves, and chiefly Elephants, which they bring from Ceylon; of which they make four hundred Crowns a piece: for all which Merchandise they receive in Truck, brown Bengala Sugar, which by the Hollanders is for the most part transported to Persia. Here also is a great Trade driven with Salt-Petre, of which the seven Powder-Mills at Batavia make Gunpowder. The raw Silk and Cotton to be had at Bengala, is commonly carry'd to Japan.
¶ TO the West of Bengala lies Negopatam, a great Town, inhabited by Moors, which drive a vast Trade at Sea,Negopatam. but oftentimes use Dutch Pilots. The Ropes of their Ships are made of Shells, or Barks of Trees. Womens Habit there.The Apparel of the Negopatam Women is very strange: for those that are of any Quality wear a fine Shift, through which the upper part of their Body is seen, then a Cloth wrapp'd about them six times, covers them from the mid∣dle downwards; their Elbows are adorn'd with Golden Armlets two Fingers broad. But that which is most foolish, the Female Moors wear two Gold Rings through their Noses. The Town Negopatam, lying on an even Shore between two Rivers, hath neither Gates, nor Walls. In the Rivers are always store of Barques and Fisher-mens Boats. Before the City are several Wharfs on which they build their little Vessels. Six Leagues from Negopatam lies Pulo Pille, provided with large Docks for great Ships. Strange way of Marry∣ing.¶ THe Negopatam Parents Marry their Children in the eighth and ninth year of their age; at which Solemnities the Bride and Bridegroom sit in a Sedan one over against another, whilst the Guests drink themselves dead drunk, and Dance, Hollow, and clap their Hands like frantick Persons. ¶ THe Hollanders Store-house is built with cross Timber-work, mix'd with Stone. When the Governor of the East-India Company comes abroad, either on Horseback, or carry'd in a Palankin, or Sedan, he hath a great Guard of Moors with him, all Arm'd with round Shields, and long Swords. The Hollanders barter here a sort of Japan Wood, us'd at the burning of dead Corpses; and also the China Root, Japan Chests, Porcelan, and Cam∣phire, against all sorts of Cottons. Formerly they us'd to freight their Ves∣sels with Negopatam Rice; but since Japan abounds in that Grain, they gave over that Trade. Lastly, the East-India Company drive a great Trade in Elephants, of which Ceylon affords the best. How they transport Ele∣phants.The transporting of them is somewhat strange, being in large Barques, cover'd over on the top with Palmito-Trees, cut off close by the Ground: the Leaves whereof are the most acceptable Food for the Elephants. When the Barque carries the Elephant aboard of a great Ship, they blind and hoise him over with strong Cables; under his Belly they put pieces of four-doubled Canvase, so broad, that it reaches from his fore to his hind-Legs; and when thus hoised over, they put them under Deck, and place them one over against another, putting onely a Manger with Fodder between them. The Hollanders meddle not with the looking after these Monsters, but the Ceylonians creep under their Bellies, and rake away the Dung. ¶ THe Elephant is the chief pattern of the wonderful Works of God.Job 40. Vers. 15, 16. Behemoth. God calls him Behemoth: Behold now Behemoth which I made with thee, he eateth grass as an Ox, Lo now his strength is in his loins, and his force is on the navel of his belly. Thomas Aquinas and Nicholas Lyra, following the Opinion of most of the
Rabbins, understand that Behemoth is an Elephant, and created on the same day that Man was; and though it be a fearful Monster, yet it is afraid of Man∣kind: for he satisfies himself like an Ox with what the Earth produceth, and trembles at the smell of a Mans foot-steps. The Indian Elephants far exceed those of Africa. The strength of those in India may be judg'd by the great Towers which they carry on their backs. In the Wars by Antiochus Eupator against the Jews, every Elephant carry'd a small Tower with thirty six Soldiers, besides the Indian which guided him. That these Monsters live three hundred years Aristotle, Pliny, Ambrose, and Non∣nus witness. Policy of the Elephants.Moreover, Philostratus the Greek Writer saith, That the Elephant is likest to Man of any Beast in Policy and Prudence: his Sence the Elephant expresses two ways, either by his natural Apprehension, or by good Instruction: to the first must be reckon'd, that the Elephant rowls himself in the Mudd against the heat of the Sun; and when he goes to drink, he first stirs the Water with his Snout, that he may not swallow any hurtful Creature; which is more cre∣dible than what Theophilactus Simocatus saith, That the Beast stirs the Water be∣cause he is afraid of his own Shadow. When they go to wade through any River, the youngest walk before, for otherwise the old ones would sink and make the Ground deeper by their weight, so that the young ones could not possibly get over. But concerning the Apprehensions of this Beast, several credible Witnesses give us many remarkable Examples. Seneca, Pliny, and Suetonius relate, That the Elephants in the Theatre at Rome, not onely Fenc'd with Swords, but Danc'd on the Ropes. Hieronimus Osorius relates, That Anno 1514. an Indian Elephant bow'd him∣self three times to Pope Leo the tenth. Augerus Busbequius relates in his Embassy to the Turkish Emperor, That he saw a young Elephant, who observ'd the steps, and Danc'd exactly after the Time of a string'd Instrument, and cast a Ball backwards. It deserves peculiar observation,Epist. Lyps. ad Janum. Hautanum. what Peter Bellon, an eye-witness, related to Carolus Clusius, who told it again to Justus Lipsius, That his Elephant coming weary and hungry into the Stable, where he found an Ass eating of Corn, he drove him from the Manger, and eat up what he found: but soon after the Master of the Elephant coming into the Stable, gave him his fill of Corn; the Beast considering the wrong which hunger had made him do the Ass, he divided the Corn, and gave the Ass as much as he had taken from him. This vast Monster,Lib. 8. c. 9. as we said, is very fearful of Man-kind. Pliny saith, So soon as the Elephant spies the foot-steps of a Man, though he never saw one before, he is afraid of private Ambuscades, and looking about him, goes not a step forwarder, but makes it known to his followers, so from one to the ve∣ry last; whereupon they all return. The same Pliny relates,Lib. 8. c. 5. That Bacchus set thirty Elephants against several Prisoners which he had condemn'd; but they, less bestial than their Master, would not observe or obey his cruel Commands: Wherefore Ptolomy Physcon made the Elephants drunk when he would have the naked Jews, with their Wives to be put to death. And full as fearful they are of Stags. When Alexander the Great had past beyond the utmost bounds of the Hercu∣lean Pillars and Bacchus Encamp'd his Army, those that were sent into the For∣rests for Wood, came amazedly running back upon the sight of a great num∣ber
of Elephants coming towards their Army: at which Porus, an Indian King encourag'd Alexander, telling him, That he need not fear the least danger, if his Troopers took but some Hogs on their Horses, and with beating com∣pell them to make a noise, at which the Elephants all return'd back again into the Woods. ¶ BUt to return again to Malacca: This City is inhabited by Hollanders, Chineses, and Malacquers. Half a Mile off at Sea lies the Red Island, from whence the Hollanders took Malacca from the Portuguese. The Malacquers of Queda some years since maintain'd a War against the East-India Company, but were subdu'd by force of Arms. Queda belongs to the Queen of Achien on Sumatra; who not long since would have Marry'd with a Hollander, but that the Councel in Batavia, for several weighty Reasons, judg'd it no way convenient. Dingding an Island.¶ BEtween Queda and Peru, thirty Leagues from Meaco, lies the uninhabited Isle Dingding, close by the Marine Coast. Here is that famous red Wood, of which the East-India Company, Anno 1663. made a trial. The Haven before Dingding full of Fish, and very safe, which they enter Eastward, and go out Westward. The Water which flows from the Mountains along the Valleys into the Sea, is as good as any fresh Water in India. A League Westward from Dingding appear the three Islands, which the Hol∣landers for a certain accident call'd The Man-eaters Isles, because the Weesop and Schelling Frigats were cast away there, and the People which were sav'd, going ashore were all slain by the Inhabitants. Anno 1661. five Ships going from Malacca to fetch their Countrey-men, found them unbury'd; whereupon they brought their Guns ashore, to take revenge on the Cannibals, and built a Ship of the Pieces of the Wreck that were remaining, which was afterwards us'd at Malacca. ¶ THe East-India Company traffick at Mesopatam, with Japan wax'd Chests, Copper and Silver, besides other European Commodities. This Mesopatam is a great City, inhabited by Moors that drive a vast Trade with large Ships; the Tackle whereof is made of Trees, as we mention'd before. ¶ IN Peleacato is also no small Trade driven, the Hollanders having a Fort there close under the City, fortifi'd with sixty Guns, which was assault∣ed by the Natives; but being beaten off by Laurence Pitman, left a considerable number of their Party dead behind them: after which Peleacato came wholly under the subjection of the East-India Company. The Vessels which they have there are very remarkable, and by them call'd Catamarous, being four round pieces of Wood ty'd together: he that steers it sits with his back-side in the Water, Dabbles with his Feet, and Rows with an Oar, small in the middle, and broad at the end, which he moves to and again, so making his way very fast through the Water. The King, who keeps his Residence up in the Countrey, is a Tributary to the great Mogull.
On the same Fort stands an exceeding high Mast, upon whose top is plac'd a Flag five hundred Yards long, which is seen eight Leagues off at Sea. ¶ SInce the Governor of Goa Conquer'd the City Cochin, on the Coast of Malabar, the third of February Anno 1653. the Netherlanders have driven a great Trade there. Through the City runs a Rivulet sixteen Foot deep; and an Island lying before Cochin makes a convenient Harbor there. The Malabar Coast produceth good store of Ambergreece, which in stormy Weather thrown upon the Shore, the Malabars, a strong People, strugling with the Waves, take up in great quantities, and preserve in their Stores. THus we have given you a large account of the present Estate, prodigious Wealth and wonderful Magnificence of the Empire of Japan, taken out of the Journals of several Embassies from the Councel of the Netherland East-India Company, setled in New Batavia; being the latest and fullest Observations that ever were taken concerning that Isle, reaching within three years of this our present Publication, presuming the Discourse, though long, will not be tedious, the variety of Argument being such, and so strange, that hitherto, we presume, hath scarce reach'd any English Ear. If this by Volume meet with a kind acceptation, we shall be encourag'd to give you betwixt our great Atlantick Work, for your divertisement, a Continuation of China, as full of Novelty, and as much, or rather more illustrated with Sculptures than the former. FINIS.
