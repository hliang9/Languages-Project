His MAJESTY the King of Denmarks LETTER To His HIGHNESS the Duke of Holstein (GOTTORP) Concerning the Sequestration of the Dukedom of Schleswig: And the said Duke's Answer thereunto. As also His Imperial Majesties Letter to the Duke of Holstein: With the Dukes Answer. Printed Anno Domini 1677.
THE KING of DENMARKs LETTER to the DUKE of HOLSTEIN Gottorp, Concerning the SEQUESTRATION. Christian the Fifth, by the Grace of God, King of Denmark, &c. Serene Duke, &c. IT is not unknown to your Dilection, what hither∣to hath past about the receiving of the Investi∣ture over the Dukedom of Schleswig; whereunto you have obliged your self by the late Agreement of Rendesbourg; and how your Dilection since that time, upon our several well-minded Admonitions, by divers Letters directed to Us, hath promised the per∣formance thereof; and in order thereunto, sent hither some of your Ministers, who nevertheless under the
pretext of going for some nearer instructions from your Dilection, are lately parted again from hence, without having dispatched any thing at all. And where∣as We have hitherto in vain expected their promi∣sed return; the time likewise at the said Agreement of Rendesbourg appointed for the receiving of the above-mentioned Investiture being already in the Month of.July last past, besides divers others since indulged Terms long ago expired; We also having a sufficient and true information of those most dange∣rous Machinations, which your Dilection hath in hand against Us and Our State; and besides, being very requisite, that We carefully do mind what is necessary for the preserving of this Investiture, depending from Us and Our Crown of Denmark: Therefore have we found Our selves unavoidably, and as it were against Our will obliged, now to Sequestrate that part of the said Dukedom, wherewith your Dilections Ancestors have been heretofore Invested; and to issue out a Commission to some of our Councellors and Officers there residing, for putting in Execution the said Se∣questration, and for performing all what is necessary to be done about the same. Since therefore We would rather have desired any thing else, than to come to this Extremity, We have thought good to give no∣tice of this Our Resolution to your Dilection, and to appoint yet out of a super-abundance another Term of Six weeks from the date hereof, for the receiving of the said Investiture, to the end that your Dilection and all the World may see, how willingly We would use all possible moderation herein, without any over-hastening of your Dilection. However, we do it with
this further precaution and warning, that in case the said prefixed Term, contrary to all expectation, like∣wise should be disregarded by your Dilection, We then shall be necessitated, though much against Our Will, to proceed ad apsam Pravationem Feudi, or to the cutting off the Fief, and to take such further courses as the Feudal Laws do allow of. Of all this We have thought convenient to advertise your Di∣lection, Recommending, &c. Dated at Our Place of Residence at Copenhagen, the 19th of Decemb. 1676. Your Dilections Affectionate Cousen and Brother-in-Law, CHRISTIAN.
The Duke of HOLSTEIN's Answer to the aforegoing Let∣ter. Most Serene and most Potent King, &c. YOur Majesties Letter of the 19th of December last past, from Copenhagen directed to Us, hath been presented to Our hands the second of this instant, by an Express from one of your Majesties Commissaries; By the Contents whereof We have seen the same, what already some days before had been published by some Letters Pattents affix'd in Our Dukedom of Schles∣wig, viz. That your Majesty hath been induced to Sequestrate that part of the said Dukedom, which doth belong to Us, and to nominate to that effect certain Commissaries, with the annexed warning, that in case we did not within Six weeks, from the date of the said Letter, effectually accomplish the receiving of the Invenstiture over that Dukedom of Schles∣wig, your Majesty would proceed ad ipsam Priva∣tionem Feudi, or the cutting off the Fief, and take such further courses as the Feudal Laws do allow off, being moved thereunto by these reasons, That We in the point of the receiving of the said Investi∣ture, neither had performed that so termed late A∣greement of Rendesbourgh, nor the Promises made by Our Letters under Our own hand, nor sent back our Ministers, who without any dispatch of Affairs
were gone from Copenhagen; but that on the contrary we had had in hand most dangerous, and by a singular accident, discovered machinations against your Ma∣jesty, and your State; and had also, as it were, un∣avoidably obliged your Majesty to the preservation of your Majesties and the Crown of Denmark's own Rights. Whereupon we cannot but with all due respect re∣turn this our Answer to your Majesty, that for the sake of your Majesty's own Glory, and high Reputation, and your Realms and Dominions welfare, We have most ardently desired and wished, that our thoughts at the first seeing of your Majesty's afore-mentioned Letters Patents, (as if they might have been publish∣ed without your knowledg) might have a sure ground, and your Majesty such a Kindness for us, as not to in∣dulge any longer our Persecutors, but rather to put a period to those unusual hard proceedings, which we undeservedly have suffered from them, and to reesta∣blish and consolidate that ancient tie and friendship which hath proved so useful and beneficial to both Great Houses, and their respective Kingdoms, Terri∣tories and Subjects; seriously considering withal, that it cannot be available neither to the repute of your Majesty's innate Generosity, nor to your Majesty's Realms and Dominions, to see us, who are in many regards so nearly related, and never failing neither in due Respects, nor required Faithfulness to your Ma∣jesty, thus oppressed, and reduced to a quite desperate condition, without having been able to impetrate the least redress, which yet lies so absolutely in your Ma∣jesty's own hands.
However, this is our only and especial comfort in all our daily increasing calamities, that your Majesty by your Letters doth suppeditate to us an occasion to make our justification before your self and briefly to refute those accusations so inhumanly invented by our ill-willers. For your Majesty's own Christian Con∣science will be the best and surest witness for us, that we never have entertained any other Counsels, nor have negotiated with any body whatsoever about any other things, but what to our best understanding we have deemed to be good, expedient and lawful for a free Prince, to preserve our selves in that State God Almighty hath been pleased to settle us in, by making us a lawful Heir and Successor to the Duke our Father of blessed memory, and to transmit the same to our Posterity, even as we had got it. We our selves have not made that Agreement concluded at Copenhagen on the 12th. day of May in the year 1658, but have in∣herited those Rights, which in due consideration of the manifold damages sustained, were thereby accrued to our Family. And it is also known to the World, that we have employed none at all at the Treaty and Con∣clusion of the reiterated Northern Peace in the Camp for Copenhagen, on the 27th. day of May in the year 1660, although we had then already taken the Govern∣ment upon us; and the said Treaty of Copenhagen hath nevertheless been confirmed therein, and the Gua∣rantie thereof undertaken by them three most Puissant States of Christendom: And presupposed his Majesty the King of Denmark, Frederick the Third, our most Honoured Father-in-Law of glorious memory, some∣thing unwillingly, and against his mind, (which yet is
altogether unknown to us, since his Family as well as ours hath been benefitted thereby,) should have pro∣ceeded to the granting of that Sovereignty, and other advantages promised to our Family; however it is but a meerly spontaneous Act: Nay, it hath been an evi∣dent token of his Royal Affection towards us, that ha∣ving observed by our Addresses for a near Alliance of Marriage in his Royal Family, our sincere inclination towards him, his Majesty in the year 1667; when the Contract of Marriage in his own Fortress at Gluck∣stadi was a making up, hath in all and the singular Ar∣ticles, Points and Clauses, wholly, and to all perpetuity, confirmed to us the above-said Treaty of Copenhagen, grounded upon the Sovereignty over the Dukedom of Schleswig, and established the same jointly with that ancient Union for a perpetual norm and rule betwixt both Families, with this engagement, and Royal firm Parol, that himself and his hereditary Successors in the Government, neither directly nor indirectly would act, nor cause to be acted against the same. But in what manner we have since been dealt withal at Rendens∣bourg in the year 1675. and how we have been con∣strained by a most troublesome detention to surrender our Fortresses, Artillery, Ammunition and Militia; yet with this Comfort given us, that all differences there∣with were ended, and upon change of Times, and an en∣suing Peace, all should be restored in such a condition as it was taken from us; and how notwithstanding all this, (after we forsooth for our Person were dismissed to Gottorp, yet still had strange Troops about us, and so only had changed place, but not detention,) certain Articles have been prescribed to our Ministers and
Counsellors remaining behind in Arrest, and we for∣ced to the pretended Ratification thereof, even as we were to the surrender of our Fortresses without any liberty left us, only therin to alter things quite in∣consistent with the Dignity of a Free-German Prince of the Empire: We are as unwilling to relate, as your Majesty can be desirous to hear, and should also have forborn to mention it either to your Majesty, or to any others, if we were not assured in our Conscience that your Majesty out of an inbred He∣roick love to Justice doth detest such a way of pro∣ceeding, and in that regard hath laid a Ground for that high displeasure your Majesty thereupon conceived against him, who out of Reasons unknown to us, hath occasioned all that mischief which then did befall us. And since thar time we have not been able to ima∣gin, that your Majesty should ever have intended, to erect that so termed Agreement of Rendesbourg, pro∣ceeding from such derogatory and extorted Principles, and consequently turning void by Law, into a Prag∣matical Sanction, after your Majesty hath charged our Subjects with such Contributions as are untolle∣rable, and do quite cut of both our extraordinary and ordinary Revenues, and hath quite demolished to the Ground our Fortresses, your Majesty having thus your self thereby introduced an impossibility to perform what the pretended Agreement of Rendesbourg doth import; For if we by virtue thereof are to receive the Investiture over the Dukedom of Schleswig, it must be done at least after such a manner, as the Duke our Father of blessed Memory the last time,
viz. In the year 1648, hath received the same; and then we ought to be invested not only with the bare Land, but also with those Fortresses, fince the last Feudal Letter doth make express mention thereof. It is true, we do confess, that even after such rigorous proceedings, to testify our deference to your Ma∣jesty, and our desire to Peace, but chiefly, to suble∣vate something our Subjects groaning under their bur∣then, and to promote their freedom according to our Power; we have been come so far, as to condescend at length to the receiving the Investiture upon these terms, that all things should be resettled in such a state, as they had been before the pretended Agree∣ment of Rendesbourg, and that the weighty burthen lying upon our Territories, should be taken off, and due satisfaction effectually made for the dammages sustained: And for that purpose we have sent some of our Ministers to Copenhagen; but our just desires have been rejected, an unconditional performance of the Feudal Duty insisted on, and the redress of our Grievances set out of doors, and our Ministers ha∣ving alleadged the want of full Powers thereunto, have been sent away back for new Instructions; with∣out being recalled by us from Copenhagen, as Her Majesty the Queen Mother by her own Letters dated at Copenhagen the 19th day of November, 1676, hath informed us. And we do confess very freely, that in case our Subjects presently after our Conditional Promise made, had been eased from their burthen, the For∣tresses reduced to their former state, and due satis∣faction effectually given us, we would have done the utmost, and undergone afresh that Feudal Duty.
But whereas also yet fince possession hath been taken, of our part of Stadt and Butjadinger-Land, notwith∣standing the same hath no relation at all to that Pro∣cess, which was actitated at Vienna in the Cause of Oldenbourg, and besides his descending as a Fief from the Ducal House of Brunswig Lunebourg. Our Subjects likewise both in Holstein and Sleswig have been forbid to pay us the few remaining ordinary dues, and furthermore such aims are made, as to ex∣clude us from that Treaty of a General Peace at Nim∣vegen, and consequently from all hopes of redress, and yet hath but lately the Navigation been by open Pro∣clamations absolutely Interdicted to all our Inhabi∣tants and Subjects of the Dukedoms of Schleswig and Holstein, without affording us, as Prince Regent, the least communication thereof, much less designing us to joyn in the said Publication, if the same had been required: We therefore have had good reason to wave the sending over our Deputies the second time again, after they were thus dismissed before, but rather have taken a firm resolution to get our Cause ventilated and discussed at the Treaty of the General Peace at Nim∣wegen, with these certain hopes and confidence, that no Potentate concerned therein will dispute our ad∣mission, in regard that amongst other high concerns, there will be also treated about the re-establishment of the Northern Peace, whereupon our Sovreignty over the Dukedom of Sbhleswig with the other ad∣vantages stipulated for us and our Family, is not only grounded, but also is an essential part thereof and stands comprehended under the undertaken Ge∣neral and Special Warranty. Neither do we think.
that your Majesties Minister in Holland hath had any orders to render difficult the impetrating of the Pasports, by us desired from the States General of the Ʋnited-Provinces; for our Ministers destined to Ni∣megen, seeing he hath not been able to alledg any thing at all which should deserve the least reflexion, and exclude us from the General-Treaty, if we were but to be considered as a German Prince, and had no concerns in the re-establishment of the Northern Peace, which nevertheless hath first of all periclitated on our side. But concerning those machinations di∣scovered by a singular accident, whereby, as we do conceive, some endvours are used, to justify that in all points disformally commenced Sequestration, we have not the least cause to clear our selves in that re∣spect, before any particulars are nearer touched, and it be duly made appear to us, that we have been given concerned in any of those Machinations repre∣sented to your Majesty. However we are sure and confident, that we never have been so suspectedly privy to any thing, as that thereby just cause should have been given, to charge us therewith by Poten∣tates both within and without the Empire, and to abalienate their former inclination from us and our Family, much less can a Pretext thereby conveniently be taken to sequestrate that part of the Dukedom of Schleswig, which with all right Hereditarily and Pro∣perty doth belong to us, and to menace us with a total deprivation thereof; and we do also fully perswade our selves, that your Majesty will put this to the serious consideration of your Ministers, who have
brought this Process upon the Stage, and perhaps do endeavour to assert it's consistency with the Feudal Laws▪ that as your Majesty doubtless makes great doubt, to assume a Judges part in that proper Cause, so neither the Sequestration of the Fief, nor the De∣privation of the same can or may consist after that manner, as it it intended against us, although we should be undisputably obliged to that Vassallage of the Dukedom of Schleswig, which yet saving all due respect to your Majesty, we find our so ves neces∣sitated solemnly to contradict, except one would presume to Act by nullities; or by making no re∣flexion upon the Law. And the common Feudal Laws, whereupon likewise the ancient unions and Heredi∣tary Agreements, (in case any difference as well in Feudal as other matters should arise) are usually grounded, do shew, that not only in the total depri∣vation of a Fief, but also in the Sequestration, the hearing of the Cause before a Competent Judge ought solemnly to preceed, notwithstanding one would pre∣sume to assert the necessiity of a Sequestration, in case the the parties do shew themselves unwilling; the reasons whereof nevertheless will never be made out by those pretended Machinations. Having therefore pondered all the above-mentioned, and such other concomitant circumstances, we cannot but still keep to our resolution once deliberately taken and remit that point of our undeservedly questioned Sovereignty over the Dukedom of Schleswig, with all the other abalienated Dignities, Prerogatives, Territo∣ries, and Fortresses; as also all due and equitable satis∣faction,
and what else can conduce to our future▪ Se∣curity, to the place of Congress for a general Peace at Nimvegen, patiently expecting from God and time, what Conclusion there will be made and come forth about the restoring of the Northern Peace, and con∣sequently also of our Rights and Concerns. But we do in the mean while very kindly and instantly intreat withal your Majesty, that out of an inclination to Ju∣stice, and in regard of that desolate condition, where∣unto we and ours thus undeservedly see our selves the more and more reduced, your Majesty would be pleased till then, and till the speediest (God grant) ensuing conclusion of a general Peace, to preserve all peaceable thoughts, and not to press upon us any further with the said Investiture, and any other demands; but on the contrary, without delay to recall thot disconform and misgrounded Sequestration, and not only leave to us the enjoyment of all our Rights and Prerogatives un∣disturbed, but also to take off the exceeding Contribu∣tions from our quite exhausted Subjects, and to restore that part of Stadt and Butjadinger-Land and also of the Customs at Eltfliet properly appertaining unto us, and amicably and friendly to interpret this our un∣avoidable Justification and Declaration, with this as∣surance, that as we have in all Points carefully obser∣ved that high respect due to your Majesty, so likewise we have intended to say or write nothing, what should tend against the same. All this is very consentaneous to equity, and to your Majesty's inbred Generosity; and we shall be ready for our part every where to praise such your Majesty's kindness, and with due
thankfulness, and all possible services, always acknow∣ledg the same; most faithfully recommending withal your Majesty to God Almighty's Protection. Dated Hamborough the 16th of Jan, 1677. Your Majesties Obsequious Cousin and Brother-in-Law Christian Albrecht.
THE EMPEROR'S LETTER to the Duke of Holstein. LEOPOLD by the Grace of GOD Elected Roman-Emperor. Serene Duke, &c. BY these we do give to understand to your Di∣lection, how we are informed, that you have not only for your part approved of those pro∣jects which have been made to you by Gra∣ventahl the Swedish Minister lately residing in our Im∣perial City of Hamborough, about certain Levies to be made in Foreign Parts, and are come to a certain con∣clusion with him in that affair; but also that your Di∣lection for the promoting of the said Levies hath made use of Kielman your late President's Moneys, that lie there, and taken thereof the Sum of 200000 Rix∣dollars,
and that your Dilection doth employ in this affair the Swedish President, Ky, (who hitherto hath pretended to live there as a private man,) and also ano∣ther person named Ʋlke. And although we do repose a far better confidence in your Dilection, than that by setting aside your strict ties and duties towards us, and the whole Roman Em∣pire, should thus lose your self, and by such prohibi∣ted, and very much culpable advances, take the ene∣mies part, contrary to the publick Statures of the Em∣pire, and our imperial Avocatories published thereupon; yet have we thought good kindly to acquaint, and se∣riously to admonish you by these, that in case things should be thus, your Dilection might betimes desist from such enterprizes, and embracing better counsel, comport your self, according to what duty doth require of a Loyal Member of the Empire, to the end, that otherwise we may not obliged, to cause to be proceeded against your Dilection, according to our Imperial Avo∣catories; all which is for your Dilections Government; Tendring withal our Imperial Grace and good Will to your Dilection. Dated at our Castle at Lantz the 6th. of January in the year of our Lord 1677. of our Reign in the Roman Empire the 19th. in Hungary the 22th. and in Bohemia the 21th. LEOPOLD, V. Leopold William Count of Konigsegg. Ad mandatum Sacrae Caesariae, Majestatis proprium, John Ambrose Hogell.
The Duke of Holstein's Answer to the afore-going Letter of the Emperor. Most Serene, &c. YOur Imperial Maiesties most gracious Letter from Lantz of the 6th Instant, hath been some days ago delivered to me by your Imperial Majesties Mini∣ster here residing the Lord Baron of Rondeck, and re∣ceived by me with all the humblest respects imagina∣ble; but with an extreme astonishment I have under∣stood by the contents thereof, that your Imperial Ma∣jesty should have got an information, as if I had not only for my part approved of those projects, which had been made to me by Graventahl the Swedish Mini∣ster, lately residing here in Hamborough, about certain Levies to be made in Foreign Parts, and had been come to a certain conclusion with him in that affair; but al∣so that for the promoting of the said Levies; I had made use of Kielman my late President's Moneys, that lye here, and taken thereof the Sum of 200000 Rix∣dollars, and that I also did employ in this affair the Swe∣dish President Kleihe, (who hitherto hath pretended to live here as a private man,) and another person like∣wise named Ʋloke;: And that your Imperial Majesty most graciously hath thought good thereupon to ac∣quaint me therewith, and seriously to admonish me, that in case things should be thus, (which yet your Im∣perial Majesty would scarce expect from me,) I may betimes desist from such enterprizes, and embracing
better Counsel, comport my self according to what duty doth require of a Loyal Member of the Empire, to the end, that otherwise your Imperial Majesty may not be obliged to cause to be proceeded against me accord∣ing to your published Imperial Avocatories. It is true, I cannot promise unto my self from your Imperial Majesties most mild, and yet most just dispo∣sition, nothing else, but that such your Imperial Ma∣jesties very gracious Letter, although occasioned by the industrious contrivance of some envying persons, who by all ways and means seek very watchfully the op∣pression and ruine of my self and my Ducal House, yet to no other end hath been sent to me, but that your Imperial Majesty might thereby get a fitter occasion to discover my innocency, and consequently by your Im∣perial Majesties Authority and highest Power to pro∣tect me as a Loyal Member and Prince of the Empire, against those who have made no conscience for the space of those 19 months, with a very unworthy treat∣ment undeservedly to oppress me, and of all my Prince∣ly Dignity to leave me nothing more than bare life: However, when I do call to mind again, in what man∣ner your Imperial Majesties Requisitorials concerning me, which were delivered into his Majesty the King of Denmark's hands, have been by the contrivance of some Ministers, bearing an hatred to me, abused so far, that they have begun almost from that very hour to exhaust my poor subjects as well of Holstein as also of Sleswig, with intolerable Contributions, and to render them quite uncapable to contribute so much, as they were lawfully bound to do for the upholding my Prince∣ly State and Dignity; which proceedings are yet till
this very moment continued, to the utter destruction of my Territories, notwithstanding no further Imperi∣al Requisitorials have been insinuated to me; and though the same hath been granted to other States of the Lower Circle of Saxony in the point of Quarters: Then have I just reason to fear, that they likewise now under your Imperial Majesties highest Name and Au∣thority, though against your Imperial Majesties will and intention do go about to colour, and palliate what they newly have spun out for the finishing of my pre∣meditated ruine, and partly have already brought to an execution: All which I have by my former complaints, with all submission represented to your Imperial Ma∣jesty, and thereby most humbly implored your speedy Protection; whereunto also I do now refer my self, in hopes your Imperial Majesty will be pleased, not only most graciously to hear, but also see them according to your Imperial Clemency forthwith redressed. Concerning those Accusations brought before your Imperial Majesty, and laid home at my door, I should never have Imagined, upon what bottom and foun∣dation they could be grounded, unless your Imperial Majesty by the Nomination of certain Persons had obliged me to a more exact information; whereupon I most humbly can assure your Imperial Majesty by a true and faithful Word of a Prince, that I never have hitherto had the least knowledg of those speci∣fied Projects, touching the Levies of some Forreign Forces, much less, that I should have approved of the same, or that I should have either directly or indi∣rectly with any man in the Worid, dealt or agreed about them. And I can protest with Truth it self,
that neither Kleyhe the King of Sweden's President; hath all the during time of his abode here made any Propositions to me concerning any Conjunction with Forreign Crowns against your Imperial Majesty, and your high Allies, nor ever offered to perswade me to any such thing. But this I do declare willingly and freely, that I have caused my disconsolate condition, whereunto I find my self undeservedly reduced, to be fully represented to his Majesty the King of Great Brittain. as Warrant of the Northern Peace, which first of all began to bleed and suffer on my side; and my Requests to be made withal, that His said Majesty would be pleased, in respect both of that General and Special Warranty taken upon him con∣cerning my Sovereignty over the Dukedom of Sles∣wig lawfully obtained, to procure my Restitution, and due Satisfaction; which I have been so far from dis∣owning, that I have contented my self, that the Me∣morials about the said Subject exhibited from time to time by my Deputy, have faithfully been commu∣cated to the Danish Minister residing in England. And I have also employed at the Court even the same Ʋloken my Covnsellor at Court, whom I did for al∣most two years imploy at your Imperial Majesties Court; and have amongst other Negotiations also caused my most humble Remonstrations and frequent instances by him to be made to your Imperial Ma∣jesty for my Protection, with these certain hopes that he hath behaved himself so well, that no cause is left to put any mistrust in him, or to charge him with any sinister and il-grounded accusations: since therefore the abovesaid foul aspersions; sindioudy
contrived by my ill wishers, can never be proved, nor laid to my door; the rest consequently cannot consist, that for the carrying on of such fictitious Levies, I should have taken and employed the said Sum of 200000 Rixdollars belonging to the Heirs of Kiel∣man, which monies I do not know in the least if they do lye her or no. Whereas now my Inno∣cency, and Fictitiousnes of those Sinister imputations do sufficiently appear by the premises; so can I with all submission assure your Imperial Majesty, that no∣thing in the World shall be ever pressed from me, which may offend and interrupt my Loyal Duties tendered to your Imperial Majesty, and to the Roman Empire, and that Devotion which my Ancestors have with their Princely Blood sealed up to that Mighty House of Austria, I do therefore again most hum∣bly implore your Imperial Majesty, as the most Sa∣cred Head of the Empire, that your Imperial Ma∣jesty would be pleased to give no way to all the Suspicious raised against me, but rather out of Highest Fatherly care to provide for such wayes and means, whereby I as a devoted Co-member of the Roman Empire may be upheld and freed from all the pres∣sing Calamities. Thus longingly I do look for your Imperial Majesties effectual and gratious Resolution, &c. Dated at Hambourg the 20 of Jan. Ann. 1677. FINIS.
