A True RELATION Of the Extraordinary Thunder and Lightning Which lately happened in the NORTH As it was sent to Dublin in several Letters to Persons of Quality With the sad Effects of the Fall of a CLOVD. Printed in the Yeare 1680.
Newtown Stewart the 29th of June 1680. THere has happened near this place so strange and sad an accident, that I think the like has been seldom known; On Saturday last about 10 of the Clock in the day, we heard much 1 hunder, which 15 miles from hence made many great breaches in a Mountain, and such pours of water tell upon the places so broaken up, That the Flood hurried the loosened earth with it to the bottom, and swelled a brook which ran there (and which comes into the River by this place) so sudenly and so high, that it carryed away all that stood before it; people who lived near the bank had not time to get out of their houses, but with Goods, Houses and all were swept along with it and perished, the beasts that fed near it were lost, the very fish were stisted by the earth which the currant brought with it great quantities of Salmon, of Trouts, Lampreys (which I never saw here before) even the Eeles that live in mud were choked and thrown dead upon the shore. And I do not believe there is one fish alive in the River, from the Mountains to the Sea. My curiosity took me yesterday to the place where this new kind of Deluge began, and truly I was amazed to see a Mountain torn in above 10 several places, and all the low ground by the River for 10 miles together covered with the Ruins, the Corn fields buried, & the peo∣ple proking in the mud and earth for the bodies of their Friends, & of their Cattle: I cannot yet learn exactly how many have perished, but by the accounts that are given, there are lost in several places 50 Souls and a∣bundance of Cattle. SIR, A Prodigious accident fell in Monter lony on Saturday the 26th of this In∣stant June, a Thunderclap forced the bowels of a great mountain be∣longing to one Gloud Hamilton, after which ensued the fall of a prodigious Cloud, which entring the Cavities of the said mountain made by the Thun der, Its weight bore the greatest part of the mountain before it, which made such a deluge of puddle, that that part of it which fell into Glenally-water that runs towards Newtown-stewart, drowned 19 persons in their houses,
turned the who'e vallies for 8 or 9 miles in length that were meadows and Corn into a Dsert of Dirt a foot thick, and hath killed all the fish in the River for 20 miles in length, the other hall of this Cloud sell into the Row-water that runs through the County of Londonderry has drowned 31 persons and forced away the Stonebridg at Limavady. Londonderry the 30th of June 1680. I Presume you will have the following newes more at large than here I give you. On Saturday last happened a very great Thunder with Hail and Rain in these parts but especiall about 16 or 20 miles from hence, in∣somuch that it hath not only tore up a Mountain of near 200 Actes but the Cloud breaking thereon, hath carried all the suriace of the Earth in that compass into all the Rivers round about; but withall hath carried away several houses and Families, insomuch that of Men, Women and children already above thirty corpse sound, & many more is believed to be lost, Of a suddain the waters rose between the Mountains 14 fathom high. In that part where the Mountain was, one Woman was lest alive, who gave an account of the Dreadfulness thereof, which she saith was as well by Hail∣stones of an incredible bigness as by the Vast Cloud coming down at once, that she by a wonderfull providence escap'd, and had it been in the night many hundred persons more had been destroyed as well as their houses & great numbers of Cattle drowned. All fish for several miles up the River are destroyed by the blackness and muddyness, of the water which the sur∣face of that mountain made, of Salmon above 7 or 8 hundred sound already dead on the shore, of Ecles and all other small fresh water fish is finite numbers destroyed, that it is nor cannot be believed in thse Rivers one fish is lest alive, Tis too tedious to relate the whole matter, But he is as dreadfull to this Countrey as you can Imagine, by being much worse than I here give you.
New-Hall the 28 of June 1680 ON Saturday last about 12 at noon, it began here to Thunder & Rain, which continued for 3 hours incessantly, the River swelled suddenly and I did so overflow all the banks, and coming down so impetuously it brought with it an infinite deal of Timber, Sticks, Straw, and Rubbish, which gathering together at the side of our New Bridge, & having no vent, it overthrew, and there is not one stick lest. I understand since that the Thunder began above Doagiven, and there a Thunder bole fell upon a hill and tore it down, which mingling with th Rain, it rather fell like a great spout, and came tumbling upon a house belonging to Aveny O Cahan the Father of Shane O Cahan the Tory, and in a moment overthrew it, & car∣ryed all away with it, and Aveny with his wise and five Children & sour Friends were drowned, with all their Cow, sheep, and Horses, and a∣mong them a Child in Cradle, which Cradle, with many other house∣hold goods and Timber of houses did help to choak and overthrow the Bridg. A boy told me that he saw the thunder bolt tall, which with great flames and flashes tore the ground, and all the day after none could go near the place for the smell of Brimstone; he sayes there fell also hairstones of a strange size and shape, some like pieces of Candles, some like great but∣tons with sharp points; within a sew miles of that place 18 persons were found drowned in one heap, and several about Newtown-stewart, But the mischief is not yet all known. After this it is a small thing to tell you all the meadows about this town are spoiled, and all the Corn from hence to the River mouth, and which is wonderfull about Derry and Colraine was nothing, but an ordinary shower at Maherae, and there abouts clear wea∣ther. FINIS.
