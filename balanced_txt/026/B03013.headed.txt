An Ordinance and Declaration Of the Lords and Commons in Parliament. WHereas the King seduced by wicked Counsell hath raysed an Army, and levyed War against the Parliament, and great number of Forces are daily raised under the commands of Papists and other ill-affected persons, by Commissions from his Majesty; And whereas divers Delinquents are protected from publike Justice by his Majesties. Army, and sundry outrages and rapines are daily committed by the Souldiers of the said Army, who have no respect to the Lawes of God or the Land, but burne and plunder the Hou∣ses, and seize and destroy the persons and goods of divers His Maje∣sties good Subjects; And whereas for the maintenance of the said Ar∣my divers assessements are made upon severall Counties, an His Ma∣jesties Subjects are compelled by the souldiers to pay the same; which sad army if it should continue, woud soone ruine and wste the whole Kingdome, and overthrow Religion, Law, and Libertie. For suppressing of which said army and ill-affected persons there is no probable way under God, but by the armv raysed by auhority of the Parliament; which said army so raysed cannot be maintained without great summes of Money, yet for raysing such summes by reason of his Majesties withdrawing himselfe from the advice of the Parliament, there can be no Act of Parliament passed with his Ma∣jesties assent, albeit there is great Justice that the said Monies should be raysed: The Lords and Commons in Parliament, having taken the same into their serious consideration, and knowing that the said army so raysed by them, hath beene hitherto for the most par main∣tained by the voluntary contribution of divers well affected per∣sons, who have freely contributed according to their abilities. But considering there are divers others within the Cities of Lon∣don and Westminster, and the Suburbes of the same, and also within the Borough of Southwarke, that have not contributed at all towards the maintenance of the said army, or if they have, yet not nswerable to their Estates, who notwithstanding receive benefit and protection
by the same army as well as any others, and therefore its most just that they should as well as others be charged to contribute to the maintenance thereof.

And the said six persons so nominated or any four of them within their severall and respective wards and limits, shall have pow∣er to assesse such person or persons, as are of ability and have not contributed, and also such as have contributed, yet not according to their ability, to pay such sum or sums of Money according to their Estates, as the said Assessors or any foure of them shall think fit and resonable, so as the same exceed not the twentieth part of their E∣states, and to nominate and appoint fit persons for the collection thereof.
