A NEW PARLIAMENT, OR REPRESENTATIVE FOR The perpetual Peace and quiet of this Nation, and of other parts, (which be or shall be incorporated with the same) in the enjoyment of their just Rights and Liberties, AS In the most peaceable times of old they have been; Now proposed to be chosen and held certain∣ly in all future times of a necessity, and a Method or Form for the choosing thereof; without charge or trouble to those to be elected, and little to them to elect, in all times hereafter. WITH Other things in order to the prevention of unlawful ex∣acting from the People of this Nation, every year hereafter, Millions of Money formerly so exacted Written by W. L. LONDON, Printed in the Year, Anno Dom. 1651:
A new Parliament, or Representative, &c. IN the times when Parliaments were frequent, being anciently ordained to be once every year, or oftner, as occasions in those times happn'ed: the people of this Nation were ex∣pert and careful of their choice, knowing what would follow to their ruine, if such Parliaments should not be just and careful in their consultations and actings for the publick good: And then they only chose those, whom in their experiences and judgements, they knew to be, or had certain intelligence of, were honest, just, learned, careful, and discreet; and knowing or capa∣ble of the knowledge of such imployment, and most like so to be qualified in the residue, as appeared by their suddain dispatch of business (which came before them) and by their adjournments, or prorogations of such Parliaments, after a quarter of a years time, or lesse sitting, which is a sign that our Ancestors have forborn, and declined the choice of younglings and novices, and others (who have not understood that which they ought to have done) according to their trust and duty in such imployment, for their own and Countries weale, (for whom they have been, and then were chosen and elected) and no man can imagine any other; but that most of those Members of Parliament (for such Members of Parliament in the then future times) were chosen and elected, willingly and deservedly, during their lives and continuance in their perfect healths and memories, in all Parliaments (which then followed) in respect of their honesty, long experience and judgement: of which desert it is hoped there be divers now. And then were many Lords or Peers of this Nation very learned and judicious in the Common & other Laws of the same; & they with others endeavoured to see that full & speedy justice were done.
And when the Parliaments were so often held, the Lawes of this Nation were accounted (and deservedly) the best, most speedy, and cheap in all Christendom, the same being grounded upon Customs and Statutes, the first from time to time agreeing to the Law of God, and upholding the Christian people in maintenance of the Christian Religion from time to time, and their quiet and peaceable living in the exercise of the same, according to the light which our Auncestors had in former times, and if any have been thereunto dissenting, and so found upon debate after solemn ar∣gument, they have been adjudged or considered of to be bad, and for that cause not to be admitted but abolished, and so have been from time to time in those dayes, (though of long time unquesti∣oned before) and the latter have been altered or repealed when apparent inconveniences have been found thereby; In which e∣steeme and account it is hoped the Law will be again when exacti∣ons crept in without Authority (which hath brought an Odium upon the Law and Lawyers, and caused an endeavour or desire in some to debar them from being Members of the Par∣liament) be removed; for without such Lawyers as be most honest, learned, and judicious in those Lawes (being grounded upon the quintessence of right reason, fully debated upon by ho∣nest and learned Lawyers, and maturely deliberated upon, and considered of, by many honest, learned and judicious Justiciars of this Nation, for many hundreds of years) it is feared that there can be expected very few good Lawes or Ordinances for this Na∣tion, but a danger of a confusion without the assistance of such, being none other of any other profession have been heard of to attain to such learning and judgement, without long and hard study, and great expence and trouble, and the study thereof hath been so difficult, that it hath been accounted the most trouble∣some in this Nation, and few (who have long studied in that profession) have come to any considerable perfection, learning, judgement or understanding in the same, though many other in other Arts, Sciences, or Professions, who have therein not studi∣ed half so long in the same (although but of mean capa∣cities) have attained to considerable learning, judge∣ment, and understanding in the same; and few or none of such exactions were so introduced or continued by the meanes of any
Lawyer accounted honest, learned, and judicious; but if any de∣sire to know by whom? upon inquiry, they may find it out with∣out much difficulty. And whereas great men bearing sway in Counties, Cities, and other Corporations in latter times, most commonly have stood and endeavoured either to be Members of the Parliament them∣selves, or otherwise have sided for some of their acquaintance, and used all the endeavour they could to procure or prefer them into, and for such imployment, principally for their cred t or re∣pute; both these and those being of mean judgements and learn∣ing in any thing, and some of them in the first place seeking their own ends, (as many have feared and doubted) by reason where∣of divers such qualified persons have obtained such imployment; which (as is much doubted by divers) hath obstructed or retarded the speedy dispatch and settlement of the publick business of this Nation, some in respect of their own self-ends, and others through their neglect, carelesness or ignorance. And many of such have so prevailed with their Tenants, Allies, Debtors and others, (up∣on whom by feasting, filling them with strong drink, imploying them in hunting, hawking, and other imployments of profit and pleasure,) they have gained such influence, that they have cau∣sed many of such persons being simple, to be for the election of any (who have provided most liberal for their feasting and carow∣sing) whatsoever hath or was like to become of the main business after, for their own (if they would or could have understood or or regarded it) and others of the people of this Nation, benefit and advantage. And whereas since the long intermission of Parliaments, many Members thereof have been far to seek, to know how to perform their duties in such trust; which hath brought divers of the Nobi∣lity and other great men of this Nation, (or so esteemed) to fall in∣to such carelesness and neglect of learning, the knowledge and judgement in and of the Lawes, that they have not understood their own and the common good, as some of them have run and hurried into and upon excess and ryot, whereby they have de∣servedly fallen and come to ruine. And since those times they have been as long, or ten times more in understanding their du∣ties and power which they had to do, as Members of Parlia∣ment,
as formerly such Members before such intermissions have been, to finish that which was to be done in the Parliaments in their times. And whereas lately divers differences have been about the choice and election of Knights and Burgesses for the high Court of Parliament, and divers Knights and Gentlemen have been put to great excessive charges about the same, more then in former times hath been used, and great ambiguity hath been about due elections, what persons of right ought to elect, and be elected into such trust. For prevention whereof, and remedy in this behalf; and to the end and intent, that all Knights or Burgesses, who shall at any time hereafter elect or be elected for this high Assembly, may be chosen by the affection of the people respectively, and by those only who have or shall have lawful and undoubted power and Authority so to elect, or be elected; and not for fear of any, or for, or in respect of any lucre of any thing, and without charge to any one so to be elected, and very little trouble or charge to them who shall have power so to elect or choose.

A short view of the Queries and Proposals formerly published, and of the Heads of others, (in short time hereafter to be pub∣lished at large, for the perfect understanding of the common People,) whereby those, who have had the experience of the matter in the same, may easily gather how the Millions of Money before mentioned may be yearly saved to the Peo∣ple of this Nation, which formerly have unlawfully been exacted from them every year. 1. By the Queries concerning Bills, Plaints and Informations, and Pleas and Answers, Replications and Rejoynders, and Rebut∣ters and Surrebutters, and such like (if the same were enacted) would be yearly saved to the People of this Nation, Two hundred and forty thousand pounds. 2. And (if the same were done of the Queries concerning the multitudes of unnecessary Orders, delays, charges and trouble in Courts, called English Courts, or Courts of Equity, with an additi∣onal Quere written at the first, but forborn to be published with the others at the request of some Gentlemen) there would thereby be yearly so saved, Seven hundred and twenty thousand pounds.
3. And (if the Proposals for the more speedy satisfaction of Creditors with little Charge or Trouble, of, and against such as be of Ability, and lie in Prison, and conceal their Estates, and setting at large Prisoners for debt and damages, not able to pay or satisfie the same were enacted) thereby then would be yearly so saved Three hundred thousand pounds (which is esteemed by some to be so much more) besides losses to Creditors to as much. 4. And by the Proposals for Prevention of the great Trouble and Charge which the People of this Nation have been put to by wrongful Arrests and Imprisonments, and for taking away the trouble and charge which divers have been at to procure Arrests and Appearances (if the like were so done) yearly would be so saved Three hundred and seventy thousand pounds, besides losses prevented to as much. 5. And if the same were done with the Proposals concerning the Principal Courts of England, and concerning the keeping of the Terms, as anciently they have been, thereby yearly would be saved for the same benefit Four hundred and ninety thousand pounds. 6. And by the Propositions for the Recording of Deeds and Conveyances, Judgments, Statutes and Recognizances, &c.
