A Joyfull Message sent from the Honourable House of Commons, to Robert, Earle of Warwicke, Admirall of his Maiesties Navie Royall. THe manifold de∣stractions of this Kingdome are great, and the disturbances of this Iland are manifestly and apparently un∣derstood, and by sad experience made knowne to the world, insomuch that all Nations doe reioyce, which are Enemies to the Peace of great Brittaine, but J hope all those that are Enemies to Sion will have their wages paid by the Di∣vell
that set them at worke, fo  mallicious spleene against this Kingdom hath beene long intended, and now of late tis burst out in abundance, God grant all those that goe about, and seeke the destruction of this Kingdome, and of our gra ious Soveraigne King Charles, may be utterly confounded, and brought to destruction. What a sad and lamentable thing it is, for the Subjects o England to thinke that a civill Warre should begin in the Kingdome, who are now at Peace with all the Princes in the World, no inten∣tion to take up Armes, but the malig∣nant Party separating his Maiesty from his great Councell, the High Court of Parliament, and creating a misunderstan∣ding betweene his Maiesty and them, it is greatly to be feared that the effects will be fatall, for it is a knowne maxime, that Jealuosie is the Mother of dissenti∣on, dissention that nourishes distraction, and distraction intestine warre, nay a
civill Warre, in comparisoo of which none is more bloody, and uncivill, and the distractions of this Kingdome de∣clare that we have great cause to feare that the same effects will insue. For intelligence hath beene given to the House, of great store of Armes and Ammunition, to be transported to New-Castle, for his Maiesties defence, likewise diverse pieces of Ordnance, and many other things belonging to warre, like∣wise many Captaines are ready to be transported over to serve the King, who have taken an Oath amongst themselves that if they be set upon by the way, they will fight it out to the last man. Likewise there was a report made to the House of Commons, that there is great preparations made both in France, and Spaine, for the raising of an Army to be transported to his Majesty, to asist hm against the Parliament, and that the Popes Nuncio doth goe about to raise Forces for the same designe.
Therfore both Houses of Parliament, had great doubt that his Maiesty had some Designe, for the altering his religi∣on. Likewise the Popes Nuntio hath soli∣cited the Kings of France and Spaine, to lend the King of England foure thousand men a piece, to helpe to maintaine the Royalty of the King against the Parlia∣ment, but we hope God will direct his Maiesty better. These are the chiefe grounds of our Feares. The House of Commons having taken the aforesaid reports into serious consi∣deration, gave Order that there should be a speedy Message, sent to to the Earle of Warwicke, intimating unto him the information which they had received, de∣siring him to have a speciall care there∣in, and to stop the passages of all those which shall transport Armes or Ammu∣nition, from Rome, Venice, Parris, and
other neere adioyning parts, as also from Holland, there having beene of late great preparations of Instruments of warre, sent over in severall Letters from thence to the high Court of Parliament. Likewise they received more intelli∣gence, of certaine Ships laden with Ord∣nance and other Ammunition, to be sent to his Maiesty, and that they are now upon the Sea. Which Newes doth increase the sor∣row of the Parliament, considering the great misery which is like to fall upon the Kingdome, whereby they  infor∣ced (for the prevention of whi) to ap∣ply themselves to the use of t power which by the Fundamentall Lawes of the Land resides in them, yet still resol∣ving to keepe themselves within the bounds of faithfullnesse and allegiance, to his sacred Maiesty. Likewise the Honorable Houses of Parliament thought it convenient, and
conduceable to the Peace of the King∣dome, for to make further enquiry there∣of wherefore they sent a Message to the Dutch Ambassador, to know of him whi∣ther there were any such thing, or not, the Messenger which carried this Message returning backe, reported to the House the Answer that he had received from the said Dutch Ambassador, intimating unto them that he had received no such intelligence from Holland, neither did he know of any such thing. Ordered by the Lords and Commons asesmbled in Parliament, that this Letter be forthwith Printed, and published throughout all the Kingdome. Iohn Browne, Cler. Parliamentorum. FINIS.
