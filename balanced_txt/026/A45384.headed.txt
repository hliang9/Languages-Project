Truth's Discovery; OR THE CAVALIERS CASE CLEARLY STATED BY Conscience and Plain-dealing. Presented to the Honorable COMMISSIONERS, And all the truly Loyall, and Indi∣gent Officers, and Souldiers. Published for the Satisfaction of all his Majesties faithfull Subjects. Written by Capt. CHARLES HAMMOND, one of the Truly Loyal and Indigent Officers. London, Printed by Edward Crowch, dwelling on Snow-Hill. 1664.
To the Courteous READER. I Know not into whose hands this Pamphlet may come, nor indeed do I much care: The Proverb saith Truth may be blam'd, but not sham'd, For my own part, I fear God, and honour my King: I hope at this time I shall displease neither: I will here use my Pen, as I ever us'd my Sword; which was more out of love and duty to my Prince, then lucre of Pay, Honour, or Preferment. As I ever hated to Insinuatd into any ones Favour: So I hope in this Booke I shall incurr no ones displeasure.
Here is no particular Person Rubb'd, but if any be Gaul'd, perhaps they may Winch, who will be but laught at, by honest Men; for my part, I feare not their kicking, but shall Defend my selfe (I hope) with honour, having Truth, Conscience, and Plain-dealing to defend mee; Justice and Equity, to second mee. I shall have the Censures of many, in Reading of this Booke; All my desire is, that they would Peruse it all over; I will own it, 'tis no Bastard deckt with borrowed habit: if it wants Learning, or Language to set it forth, Pray consider it came from a Souldier, and An Indigent Officer, who can dress it no better then hee is able; confessing himselfe very poore in his Pen, (as I believe) we are all left in our Purses; Therefere it may be the better accepted a∣mongst some of you. However being once past the Press, let it shift (as wee must) for the present; to the greife of our Friends, and derision of our Enemies; Which God, the King and Par∣liament, in time (I hope) will Consider; to the Comfort and Reliefe of those that can Clearly make themselves out to be the Truly Loyal and Jndigent Party. Which is the humble desire of him, that loves and honours a faithful and constant Sufferer, a Loyal and civil Subject, a Gallant and Deserving Souldier. 28 MR 59 Charles Hammond.
Truth's Discovery; OR, The Cavaliers Case clearly Stated, BY Conscience and Plain-dealling. Laid Open in these Four Heads: 1. Their Grievances made manifest, Impartially. 2. Their Faults laid open, without Flattery. 3. The Causes that produceth their Faults, discovered in reallity. 4. The Remedies discribed in good will, out of true Loyalty and Fidelity. And First, The Cavaliers Grievance made manifest.
I Believe we have been a Table-talk in most parts of Christendom these three Years past; but much more since our Divident of Indigent Money hath been al∣lotted us: not six Weeks Pay for six Years Service, and sixteen years Sufferings; many Censures and Judgments hath been cast upon many Men in the handling of this bu∣siness: For my part I shall reflect upon none, but declare the truth of what I have seen, and heard, and know in it; The King and Parliament did intend a better Gratuity than it fell out to be. And so it would have proved, had it been shared to none but those that were truly quallified according to the Act; but who would not lay Claim to have an Interest in the Act, when there was neither Penalty nor Punishment for the breakers of it? If any could procure a Certificate from any Colonel or Captain, that he was a Commission Officer, that Certificate (with the assistance of some Friends, to any one or more of the Commissioners) would produce Five of their Hands and Seals, they believing the Party quallified according to the Certificate that is so produced from the said Officers, which Officers, it is possible, are to go sharers with them they so certifie for, when they receive their Money; as I believe too many hath (with Impudence) gone clearly off with that Cheat; Others have Ride up and down the Country, and for some Money in hand, and so much in the pound (when they receive their Devident) they would secure their business, and warrant them they shall stand right or wrong; and if they would but conceit themselves Officers, they would perswade them they were so; and let the Royal Party that (knew they were no such men) prove it, and by Oath maintain it and tur∣ned them out; yet those Men were brought in again, and have received part of this Money, and it is not known which way; & if it were, we cannot help it: It hath been proved that some hath been dead six years, some ten years, and some sixteen years; yet those men hath been raised again, not to receive their Money because they are invisible and not to be seen, but to make over Letters of Attourneys to have their Monies re∣ceived for them by such as are not to learn to Cheat us now, as well as they could the King formerly, by their dead Musters, and so make him a great Army of Officers now, as they did Souldiers then; but when they were to do him Service, there could not the Fourth part be found, no more there will be of these Indigent Officers if the King should call them for his ser∣vice, or to have a strict Accompt whether they be quallified according to the Act.
Another sort there is of Indigent Officers that carried their Commissions in their Pockets, that either could not Raise their Regiments Companies, or Troops, or else would not; yet these made all or most part of their Officers, especially Quarter-Masters, which must provide their Captains quarter for a Troop, though he had never a Man besides his Officers and their Pedee's and Baggage Hotses: these would lye upon the Out quarters of the Army if there were no Danger; else in one Regiment or other: These would serve themselves, be∣ing under no Command; never venturing their Lives unless it were to Plunder, making the Army odious by their actions; so that civil and gallant Fighting-men were look'd upon by the Country where they march'd, as our Indigent Party is here in the City, all a like; so that a truly Loyal and Indigent Officer now is ashamed to own himself in regard of so many Counter∣feits which hath abused both the King and Country, and is rank'd in amongst us, and received as much as any of the best of us; whether it be their Due or no, I leave that to those in time may please to Consider of it, if this Book come to their hands; which I hope it will. Others there is (that hath had a great share in this Money) that may be termed Indigent Officers, but whether quallified according to the Act, that I shall not judge of; and they are such as never served the King (if they did) not as Commis∣sion Officers till after 1646, which was at the Rising in Kent, about a Week standing; or at Colchester, or in Duke Hamble∣ton's Engagement, two or three Months standing; or in Sir George Boothes business; and all these petty Risings and Train∣Rand Officers, that never went out of their own County or Garrisons where they lived, that were only in a readiness to help to save themselves, not being able to endure the scent of a light Match upon Service; yet these are brought in for Indi∣gent Officers too.
And then for Colonels, to make their Serving-men and Grooms Officers, to put in for the Money; and Captains to appoint Lievtenants, Cornets, Ensigns and Quarter-masters, (in a Tavern or an Alehouse) and go half snips with them; this they counted no Cheat if the Officers were dead: Others if they served the Parliament (after the King was Murdered) till the Restauration of our Soveraign that now is: nay, some of them proved great Trappaners to the King's Friends now in these times; yet these are rank'd with the truly Loyal and Indigent Officers, such as were in Pay, when we were in Prison, and could March the streets, when we were forced to hide our heads: If these be not Grievances (which we have cause to lay open) let Friends and Enemies both be our Judges; When it was proved upon Oath before Commissio∣ners, that some never had Command in their lives: And a∣gainst others, that there was no such Men known, not so much as Troopers, or Souldiers, which claimed to be Captains and Commission Officers, and many of them never appeared to answer for themselves, if there were any such, as I believe it will be made appear there was not: To be short, When we thought there had been 1500 at least turned out by Inspection, there was 300 more then the first Number taken in; so that we were senceable it was but a folly to strive against the stream, being driven more and more backward.
As for those Indigent Officers that leapt from Corporals to Quarter-Masters, and from Cornets to Captains, Majors, and Lievtenant-Colonels, to put themselves in Colonels; and to make their Brothers or Kindred Lievtenant-Colonels and Majors under them, that was accounted nothing, though it were within a Week or a Fortnight before the laying down of Arms; and some too that never did the King Service since, nor I believe will never be Chronicled for their Service they did his Father formerly; for their Loyalty, it may be they are clear; for I believe they were like a Chip in Pottage, never did hurt nor good, neither for the King nor his Friends, but all for their own Ends: Indigent they may be termed, but by their Insinuating, they have gotten good Gifts and Rewards that hath been given by the King (and others) intended for those that was deserving, and poor; but the Proverb saith, Kissing goes by favour; and Rewards bestowed upon them that can make best Friends, when Service and Desarts either lyes in Prison, or dare not peep out for fear; as by some 'tis too openly known, that through Want and Grief together, being ashamed to make their wants known, especially since the King came in, have broke their hearts to see some of their Friends slighting them for their Poverty: And others, that would willingly Relieve them, but not able, the more is their grief, and to be pittied.
Now there is another sort of truly Loyal, but not Indigent; which some of them I much honour, having been much im∣poverished in Estate by their Service for the King, and never yet had any Reward, that hath put in for a Part of this Money, that are not so Indigent; but if they had thought to what a pittiful sum it would amount to, they would have left it to them that had more need: But there are some again that hath had good Rewards and Offices (under the King) given them, some more then their Commands, their Service, or their Suf∣ferings ever merited, yet hath put in, and taken share of this Money too, being so covetous as to rob the spittle (as I may term it) being ungrateful to his Majesty for his Favour to them formerly, and abusing his Charity in this which was now intended for them that were Really in Want for the present: I believe there are some that hath taken of this Money, that if the truth were known (as it may be made appear) that they have gotten (besides their Places) near a Thousand pounds a man, and some have Three-score, some an Hundred, nay, Five hun∣dred a year; yet all these have put in for Indigent Officers; so what I have here Related concerning our Greivancees is no∣thing but truth; and much more can be proved by the truly Loyal and Indigent Party, to the shame of some Persons (that shall be nameless) if once called to an account: our Wants and Necessities hath been so great, that it is not unknown upon what Rates some men hath been fain to borrow Money, as at Five shillings in the pound, and a Gratuity to some to help them to it: Some indeed borrowing so much, I believe they will never come to look for more, knowing they have no right to any of our Money, if all things had been rightly carried: Besides, there hath been abundance of honest Trades-men and House-keepers undone by Trusting and Helping us in the time we waited for this Money, not any of them thinking but it would amounted in some measure to a satisfied every mo∣derate mans Debts; but falling out as it hath done, it hath undone them, and us too; for some of them are not able to Relieve themselves now, that formerly Relieved us, that of necessity if God doth not raise Friends for some, they must want Lodging, Food, and Rayment, unless it be provided them in a Prison, as too many can witness since they have re∣ceived this Indigent Money; many being cast into Prison al∣ready, others having neither Money nor Credit, must of ne∣cessity either beg, steal, or starve, unless God be pleased to raise them Friends, to move His Majesty and the Parliament to provide for them, as they out of their Mercy and Wisdom shall think fit; which will not be (of the truly Loyal and Indi∣gent Party, that can prove themselves quallified according to the Act, not) the Fift part of those that have gotten their share of this last Money, which I shall more clearly make out how they may be proved at the latter end of this Book. So having shewed you our Grievances in part, I will now shew you the Faults our Indigent Party is branded with, and not without a cause. The Faults of the Indigent Party, laid open without flattery.
AS the Complaints are great of the Indigent Party, to the grief of many civil men (their Friends) so their griefs hath been as great to hear the Complaints against them, which I confess is not without a cause: And give me leave to lay o∣pent to you those faults which are too openly seen, and heard, to our shame in the World; that makes many say, We can see the Moats in others eyes, but perceive not the Beams that are in our own. Our Sufferings was great before his Majesty was Restored, you will say 'tis greater now: 'Tis true our sins was great before, they are far greater now; God hath Restored us to our Peace and Liberty, which we so long prayed for, and wish'd for, what Returns have we made to him for that Mercy? Instead of sending new Praises and Thanksgivings to present him from our hearts and lips for those Mercies, we have Inven∣ted New Oathes and Curses to send him: He that cannot Swear and Swagger, Drink, Rant, and Rogue, is look'd upon (by some) as a pittiful Fellow, and not worth their keeping Company; and if he cannot Vapour, he is not look'd upon to have any Valour: These Vices have got such a custome of late, that they are look'd upon to be the only Badge to distinguish a Cavalier from a Sectary, that you shall find in Court and Camp, in City and Country, that those that are crept into places of profit and preferment by their Purses (which I believe serves the King more for lucre of Pay, then love to his Person) these now are become as absolute Dam-me Boys as the best (or the worst I may say) which formerly would as soon cut a Cava∣liers throat as swear an Oath, and esteemed it a less sin, unless it had been the Covenant or Engagement; but I have no more to say to them: but how can we look for Mercies from God, or Favour from the King, when we (who should shew such good Examples for the Glory of God who hath delivered us, and the Honour of our King, whose Cause we fought for) are now so accustomed to these odious Sins, that we neither feat God's Judgements, nor the Kings Laws, which are both Enemies to such counterfeit Cavaliers (I can term them no other, nor ever did) who hath done the King more harm by their deboystness, then ever they can do him good by their ser∣vice if He should have occasion to use them; therefore, you that can make your Service and Sufferings out for His Majesty, shew it in your Carriage and Behaviour, for your future Hap∣piness, and His Majesties Honour: We have Enemies enough, we had need make God our Friend, and that can never be with such courses: I believe, if some thought there was a God, they would not call upon him to damn them so often as they do; it is an Oath so common, it is grown a custome by Rich and Poor, Men and Women, Old and Young; we can talk a∣gainst the Pride of the Gentry, the Covetousness of the Clergy, the Deceipt of the Citizens, and the Corruption of the Lawyer; but Swearing, Cursing, Lying, Back-biting, and Insinuating is counted no sins amongst us; and that I must be bold to tell you, That those that profess themselves the Indigent Party, are greatly Guilty in this, and by Jarring and Quar∣relling one with another, every one thinking his own wit best, till at last some out-witted all those thar are truly Indigent; and well they may, having Four to One against us, and good backers to second them: These, and such like, are the Faults of the Indigent Party, which I have here declared, not out of Envy or Hypocrisie, but out of the Love to them that are of the right Party, hoping you will better accept of it from a Friend then from an Enemy; for others, let them think what they will, and speak what they list, I have done what I can to make it appear who are the truly Loyal and Indigent Party, and who the Counterfeit, that the Cheat may be found though the Gamesters be hid) for the satisfaction of our Friends, which are grieved for us; and likewise for our Enemies which rejoyceth at our Poverty, and would work upon our Necessity if they could; but I hope they shall find us more contented with our Rags of Loyalty, with a quiet Conscience, then they can be in their Robes of Sedition, which they have gained by our Ruine, not doubting but God's Mercy, and the Kings Cle∣mency in time may relieve us, when its clearly known who hath faithfully served and suffered for him; in the mean time, I desire all them that fear God, and honour the King, not to let their Grievances and Poverty move their Passion so much by their Cursing and Swearing, which makes us stink in the nostrils of God, and odious in the company of civil persons, and become a laughing stock to our Enemies, that hath nothing else to look for, but the Judgements of God to fall upon us, such like sins, which are too much used by those that profess themselves the Kings Friends. So having now shewed you the Faults of our Party, I shall shew you the Causes, which are many; I will instance a few, and though they be great, I desire to remove them, that our Faults may be mended.
The Causes that produceth their Faults, Discovered in Reallity.
WE can plead no cause we have for our sins, or Faults, but what produceth them, we may; and that I shall declare, which is Pride, Poverty, and Passion; you will say 'tis strange that the Indigent Party should be tainted with Pride, for they have cause enough to be humbled: Yes, but the Counterfeits are proud in conceit, that they have out∣witted, out-vapoured, and can out-swear the truly Loyal and Indigent Party, as by woful experience we have found; I must tell you, that they take such pride in their swearing, that they think they are not look'd upon as Gentlemen and Cava∣liers, unless they can swear to all they speak, whether it be truth or lyes; nay, I dare say, that there are many hundreds that have received their potion of this Indigent Money (with the best) that have discharged more Vollies of Oathes in the faces of the Kings Friends, then ever they discharged corns of powder gallantly in the faces of his Enemies, if the greatest Swearers and Vapourers could prove themselves the best Souldiers and the greatest Sufferers for his Majesty, they then may be proud of their Loyalty to the King, but they cannot boast of their good service to God: I must tell you, 'tis the greatest honour that can redound to a Souldier to be counted Religious, as well as Valourous; and Humility is the truest badge of Gentility: you must not blaze every mans Arms now by the Coat he wears on his back; if you should, Poverty procured by Loyalty, would be a great blot in the Seutchins of many a gallant Soul, and well bred Gentle∣man, which can patiently see every day Rich Coats worn by such as cannot find a Coot of Arms to blaze, unless they fetch it from the Hauraldy of Rebellion, or buy it, as many hath done Places of Honour and Preferment with the Purses that they have gained by the Plunder, Purchase, and utter Ruine of some of his Majesties best Subjects, which in their Eyes and in their Hearts they think and will speak a far off, that our Po∣verty is a just Reward for our Loyalty, terming us Fools that we did not turn Knaves as they did, and then face about with them, having but Money in our Purses they say it would a procured us Friends enough at Court, I hope every rational man may clearly see that I have spoken nothing but truth, and you may give losers leave to speak, having nothing more to lose now but our lives; for few of us can boast of being sure of our Liberty, not daring to walk the streets in the City for fear of a Compter Scuffle, nor out of the City for fear of a worse Party, which hath taken many of our Indigent Officers, and conveyed them to such Garrisons, where they must lye till God in his Mercy take them away, or the King in his Clemency find Exchanges for them, which some of their hard-hearted Creditors had rather see starved to death than Relieved or Released by them; and this is the Poverty that hath caused many a civil Soul to fall into Passion to see his fellow Sufferer ready to starve, and not able to Relieve him, to see him carried to Prison and cannot help him, to hear him laught at, scorn'd and derided by others and dare not vindi∣cate him without the venturing your life, or flying your Country, or suffer your self to be villified in taking his part, by such as with their insinuating into some mens Favours that are in Authority, shall smite you secretly (if it be possible) and you shall never know who hurts you, and shall ruine you in your Credit as they have done in your Estate, if their Tongue or their Purse can do it: Are not these sufficient Causes to move passion in civil men to break out beyond rea∣son sometimes, when our Poverty for our Fidelity shall make us ridiculous, our inferiors predominating over us, our Supe∣riors more countenancing our Enemies then hearkening to us, and our own Party not able to help one another, our Com∣plaints being kept from his Majesties Ear, as our Persons by our Poverty are kept from his Presence; so that I believe some of us may compare with Job for patience, and out-strip him too in some points, as I shall take a little leave to parrallel; Job was a rich man, had Wife and Children, God suffered Satan to afflict him in Body and Estate to try his patience, he endured to the end and was Restored: we cannot read that ever Job wanted Bread, nor was forced to fly from his own House and Home, or ever stood in danger of his life every hour by the hands of Rebels, in his own Country; he had his Liberty (though in sores and misery) no debarring of any Friends that would come and visit him: How many of the Kings Friends have lost all, many have been starved for want, and at this time wants bread, having neither House nor Ha∣bitation of their own to go to, and now when the time of Restoration was expected: how many hath been forced former∣ly to fly their own Country, every day in danger of a Jayle, if not their Life; their Friends not daring to visit them with∣out being in danger of being Undone for them; being Plun∣dered and Robb'd by their own native Country, their Kindred (not Caldeans) professed Enemies to our Country, as Job's was to him; yet in during to the end with patience, never cursing the Day of our Nativity nor the Cause that brought us to this Misery, as willing still to venture our lives for his Majesty that now is, as we hazarded our lives and Estates for∣merly for his Father of blessed Memory; give me leave to think if Job had lived in these times to have been an Indi∣gent Officer, and endured so much slavery and poverty, and afterwards been delivered to his former liberty, and a reason∣able Provision provided by King and Parliament for his pre∣sent Necessity, and that being Ordered and handled so that it produceth him to more Misery, by the close sinister ends of those that profess to be his Friends, and of his own Party, I believe it would have urged his patience, and with some of us, think that (if it were to be searched out) they would find in it much partiallity, and that the main ends of some cove∣tous Parties hath brought many to misery, and highly abused the King and Parliaments Clemency, which was never intend∣ed for such as hath received it, which are above Three thou∣sand not quallified according to the Act, which hath been formerly declared, and can be clearly made out by civil ratio∣nal men, that are neither vapourers nor flatterers; and will prove it the greatest Cheat that ever was acted against so needful an Act of Charity as this was. So having shewed you our Grievances, our Faults, and the Causes, I shall now propound some Remedies, which being applied to these sores, may open abundance of Corruption to the sight of those (in time) may pitty our Condition, and use some Remedies to cure our lingring Disease. Remedies described in good will (out of true Loyalty) for the recovery of the truly Loyal and Indigent Party.
THe Remedies that I shall produce, are but few; yet be∣ing applied with the help of these, we look for Relief and Redress from, which are these Honourable Persons (the Par∣liament I mean) that (under God) hath already, and will heal (I hope) our tottered and once almost ruined Kingdom, which we may justly claim to be Members of; though some by Age and Wounds, and others by Poverty, are not able to do as they have done, yet are willing still; and I dare boldly say (in the behalf of some) if tryed, are as able now (by their Knowledge and Courage) to do the King as good service (if there were occasion to use them) as they did formerly for his Father of ever blessed Memory: But for the Remedies in hand; some things that are past I shall not propound, which were to recover a thing unpossible, which is the Money that was alloted amongst us, it being dispersed into so many greedy and needy hands, which I believe (and 'tis thought by not rash, but rational men) that a good handsome part of the three∣scor thousand pounds will fall into the hands of but a few per∣sons that will be made by our undoing; but the Letters of At∣tourney will skin over that sore, and it can hardly be remedi∣ed; for the Office-Money, how that hath been handled, none can justly tell, though give a shrewd guess; but if the Raters and Receivers were but throughly purged and searched, that Corruption may be fetched out, and a Remedy in time may be procured; but I must confess it is but a folly in me (or any other of our poor Party) to propound any Remedies for such old sores that are too deep for us to search into: therefore I shall leave those things that is past my finding out, and pre∣scribe a few Remedies that may do well for the future, to help those that are the truly Loyal and Indigent Party, that if ever the King or Parliament (or any other) should be willing to help heal us; that those may be look'd on whose service, suffer∣ings, and deserts deserves pitty, and that should be made ap∣pear by a new Certificate from the Hand or Hands of the Chief∣est Officer of the Regiment now living, that is known himself to be a Deserving Gallant man, and it was a Com∣pleat fighting Regiment, and then to Certifie that he knew such a man, and he had a real Command so long, as he can testifie of his own knowledge, and of his behaviour and carriage while he was under his Command; and thus to certifie the truth accor∣ding to his deserts upon his Credit; and likewise to get ano∣ther Certificate from the Hands of Creditable men where he li∣ved, or from others that knew him where he had been since the Wars, and would testifie for his Loyalty after he left the Kings Army, to the Restauration of our now Gracious Sove∣reign: I believe, if none but those that could produce such a Certificate should have had share of this Indigent Money, we should have had no cause to declare our Grievances; but I be∣lieve, then it would a been a great grief to some, to have seen none but honest men provided for; for then they should not a been so well provided (as they are now) with our Money: Next Remedy is, if for the future there should any provision be made either by Offices or Places, either Martial or Civil, or any Money given by his Majesty (or any others) that it may be put into the hands of impartial men to be distributed, such as Jethro prescribed to Moses, Men fearing God and hating Co∣vetousness; that Rewards intended for deserving men and suf∣ferers that wants, may not be distributed to particular persons in Private, by Letters from Ladies (or Great men) to their Ser∣ving-men, Foot-men, or Porters, or to such as hath had more already then ever their Service deserved, being a cluster of In∣sinuating Impudent (more then Indigent) Officers, that runs up and down (hearkening after such Gifts) either fawning with the Favourites, or Feeing them (and the Clerks that belongs to such persons, that hath the distributing of such Gifts) that when their own turn is served, if there be any thing left, (gi∣ving them a part with you) they will make you acquainted with it; this hath been the course of most Gifts that hath been be∣stowed since his Majesty came in, that if it were openly known upon whom it hath been bestowed, it could not be made appear that it hath been half distributed according to the Intentions it was given for; so that a few particular persons hath and doth get a shear in everything, and most of them deserves nothing, and some wants nothing; when some Gentlemen to my know∣ledge that had done the King good service, hath been great Sufferers, gallant Souldiers (and no diserters) that could not get a penny of all this Money to relieve them, not hearing of it till it was all distributed; some being brought to that conditi∣on through want, that now they are past want; such as could not make their case known to none but such as could not help themselves, but only with hopes, which keeps their hearts from breaking, thinking they are now at the worst; therefore in hopes it will mend. Another Remedy would be desired for the truly Loyal and Indigent Souldiers that served his Majesty as well as Officers, which are or should be provided for by Pension according to the Act, which I believe if they were clearly purged, and none to have it but such as could produce (from their Officers, and the places where they have lived or been since the Wars) such Certificates as I prescribed for our Indi∣gent Officers before, I believe then there would be a good subsistance for all true Pentioners, Widows (or others) which I believe is not many more then they have made Indigent Of∣ficers, if they were carefully examined; but there is as great Complaints from them as there is justly from us; some that never served the King, some that served a while and run home, others that served the Rebells here in England till the King came in; Yes, and received their Wounds in their service a∣gainst the King (some of them) and had Pension for it from them; yet making Friends, and getting some Officers Hand (like themselves) or to keep them from the Parish charge, hath gotten in to be Pensioners, when (to my knowledge) there are those that hath been stout Souldiers, and served as Corporals and Sergeants (and continued till the end of the Wars) lame and wounded too, and have been faithful ever since; some can get nothing, some Forty shillings or Three pounds a year, when Four pounds (or more) shall be allotted some that can be pro∣ved as unworthy Rascals against the Kings Friends (in the time of Rebellion) as those that were alwayes against us, and worse too, and would be as ready still to stand for Rebellion if they thought it would prove the stronger side; thus hath the Kings and Parliaments Clemency in the Act been abused, which I hope God will put into the hearts of some of the Nobility and Clergy to move his Majesty in our behalf, that he would ap∣point some noble Persons to hear our Grievances, and in some way relieve us, that such whom God in Mercy, hath preserved their lives, and shifted for their Liberty and Livelihood in the worst of times, as we thought, should not now complain for want of Food, Raiment, and Liberty, and to see (both in Court and Camp, Sea and Land) places of profit and prefer∣ment bestowed upon them that hath enough to live on besides, which they gain'd when we lost all; when able men, and civil∣men as ever served his Majesty, only branded with Poverty, must be look'd upon by these persons as unworthy men, and not fit to have any Employment, by reason of the deboystness of some that hath made themselves the Cavalier Party.
I must of necessity Conclude, and leave these Remedies (and what else is wanting) to be remedied by those whom God di∣rects and appoints, not only to hear us, but what they shall see (in their Wisdom) is wanting for the Advancement of His Majesty, the Peace and Preservation both of Church and People under his Majesties Dominions, which shall be the Prayers of him, which for this time takes his leave, desiring what you see in this Book writ out of Ignorance or Passion, judge favourably of it, and let that real Intention which I aim at, without sinester ends, plead for my Infirmities, which you discover here, reflecting upon your selves, knowing there is none free from some or other.
Post-script. I Know there is many will wonder, that I should presume to take upon me, to write this Book, being there is ma∣ny of our Party that were far more able to have undertook the handling of it: I must confess it might have come from a better Pen, but not a truer Heart; It grieved me to see what Confusion there hath been amongst us from the beginning: some drawing up Remonstrances, and Grievances, and setting of Hands to this Thing, and that Thing; then Chusing of Trustees, appointing of Meetings at several places, and so spend our Time and Money too (them that had it) some siding for one Party, some for another; every one crying out they are wrong'd, when some of them are as much tainted themselves as the worst, yet take upon them to Right o∣thers, when they have done the most Wrong, and think their pretended high Commands that they have had, will bear them out.
Some of those Gentlemen that we Chose for Trustees, I much honour; whose aim and intentions I believe were right; but for some amongst them, I cannot understand that how they can be clearly for our Good, that cannot clear them∣selves: Must not they wink at others, for fear themselves should be brought to light? I should desire every one to rest themselves contented, and not hearken after the Fancies of every sinister-ended Party, that are more for their own end, then for the general Good of us (if they should bring their purposes to pass) For my part, the writing of this Book was intended (from me) only to give Satisfaction to all Loyal Subjects, how His Majesties, and the Parliaments Clemency hath been abused, and we wronged and dis∣graced; having such a Company of pittiful Fellows lay Claim to be Commission Officers; some (I believe) knows not a Rank from a File, nor a Counter-march from a Wheell; that never look'd as if they had either Wit or Valour in them (and wanting both, they were very unfit to Com∣mand) for I believe the King was never in such need of Of∣ficers; and some that were more fit for a Rod, than wear a Sword in his late Majesties Service, being twenty six or thirty years of Age, hath had this Divident too; so that what long of such (and your Roaring, Dam-me, Counterfeit Cavaliers) hath rendered our Party so ridiculous in the Eyes of some People, that they slight and scorn all civil Cavaliers for their sakes: but I must tell them, there was, and is, as gallant and as civil men in the Kings Army, which hated, and doth hate such Courses as much as the greatest Zealot of them all, not out of Hypocrisie, or fear of the Law, but out of the fear of God, which we should all live in; perhaps some may censure 'tis out of Envie, or vain Glory, that I have so often touch'd upon Swearing; it is so often in my Ears (against my will) which makes me mind it so often to you, that you may bend your mind to leave it.
For Envie or vain Glory, how much I have heen guilty of these two Sins, I leave those to censure that knows me now, or formerly in the Kings Service; which I was constantly in one Army, and in one Regiment, though under Four Collonels: First the Lord Mehuns, then Sir Charles Mehuns, afterwards Col. John Digbys, and last Sir Chichester Wrays; my service being most in the West, belonging to the Cornish Army; and now since his Majesties Restoration. I have served in his Majesties Regiment of Gaurds (as a Souldier) in the Right Honourable Col. John Russels own Company: What my ser∣vice and carriage hath been (from the first to the last) I leave to the censure of those that are able to Report of both, either for my Credit or Shame, desiring them to give no better nor worse a Character then I have deserved; which I know can never redound to my dishonour for my service (and I hope as little for my Carriage and Behaviour to every man) which I shall endeavour to continue with the utmost of my power, hoping in time to see such men countenanced, if not provided for; whose service and carriage hath never dishonoured that just Cause they ever Fought for, which was for Gods Glory, and his Majesties just Rights; which is the Desire of him, that for present leaves you, and remains your Friend to the ut∣most of his power, so far forth as you are Loyal Subjects: Ho∣ping this Book may light into the Hands of some near the King, that may Reflect upon their own Sufferings formerly; and to do now, as they would be done unto, if they were in our Condition. FINIS.
