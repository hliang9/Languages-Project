O the moste excellente / moste redoubted and moste crysten kyng: Kyng Edward the fourth Iohan kay hys humble poete lawreate / and moste lowly seruant: knelyng vnto the ground sayth salute. It ys not out of your knowleche & herty pyte moste prudente Prynce: howe that thies fourty ye¦res passed: the turkes hane vexed the crysten partyes & hane preuayled / & had of the crysten men the ouerhande: in so moche that nowe late agaynest al right, & reason were possessours in Italye / in the domynyon & grounde of the most constant kyng Ferrand of Arragon king of Naples: in preiudyce & horryble terrour to the court apostolyque & to al crystendome. For by that the grete Turke late named Mahumete proposed & or∣deyned grete myght & strenghte to vndoo & subuerte the holy cytee of Rome, & putte Italye to his subiectyon / & after light¦ly to ouercome & oppresse the resydue of crystendome. But Ihe¦su cryste our redemptour wold not his crysten people to be put into lenger peyne / or to more trybulacion: he hath retrayte & withdrawen hys rodde: as a kynd father to his dere children contente with grete menasses & lytil punycyon. Certes the syn¦nes of the crysten people: as I thynke: & lytil regarde to our sa¦ueour Ihesu: meued & caused the ryghtwys god: to warne vs to haue him beter in mynde by the flagel of this grete & migh¦ty ennemye. But after repentence & prayers of our holy fa∣ther the pope: Cardynalles: Crysten prynces: & all crysten peo∣ple: and with so grete pardones of the court of seyntes petre & paule: through the grace of the blessed Ihesu: this grete turke in his moste pryde / & his moste hope hath made be sodeyn deth amende of his lyue: and ys the cruel generacyon of the turkes for euermore / with goddes grace deiecte / & caste out of Italye
And all the turkes among them selfe in grete Werres. Whiche thyng ys token to all crysten prynces here after to recouer the partyes crysten. Certayn yt ys moste gracyous prynce: that he fewe dayes afore hys deth layde siege to the noble cytee of Rhodes: whiche ys the key & yate of all crystendome. But ther he was put to hys worse & to shame. And be cause that I ha¦ue seen & red in Italye of the oppressyng & captyuyce by the sayd Turke of the worshipful cytee somtyme of Constantino¦ple: and also not many yeres passed of the infortunate losse of the streng cytee of Nygrepount. For the Cardynale greke of Mycene made & wrode in latyne the lamentable captyuyte of Constantinople to the pope: and Balthasar perusyn wrote in the langayge Italyon of Nygrepount to the lord of Vr∣byn: for to meue the crysten people to prayers and prouyci∣on. I haue thought more beter labour & more commendable purpos yf I in the reuerence of Ihesu cryste / & in the wor∣ship of your gode grace shulde put with dylygence out of la∣tyn in english / & to the vnderstondyng of your people the dy¦lectable newesse and tithynges of the gloryous victorye of the Rhodyans agaynest the turkes. wherof they redyng shal haue Ioye & consolacyon & shal alwey deuoutely knowe by dayly miracles & goddes werkes the inestimable power & certente of our crysten fayth. And in so moche more to youre hyensse I make a yefte of my labour: that your gode grace abondeth with al vertues: also much as in a moste crysten king longeth to be: And also I am of this opynyon that al the comyn wele & co¦myn gode cometh through god & the kynges to their peoples. wherfor what so euer frute or pleasur your peple shal in thys my studies finde they shal yelde glorye to god & grace & than kynges to your hyenes. The whiche god almyghty kepe euer & prosper with all your noble desires
Yth that I haue aplyed me to declare and publysshe to alle crysten people the siege of the noble and inuyncyble cytee of Rhodes: Fyrst I purpose to telle and opene the causes that meued the cruell tyraunt Mahumete grete Turke and insacyable enemye to oure crysten fayth / that he with so grete might & so grete streynght vexed the Rhodyans: howe be it / that afore this tyme the rho¦dyans and the Turkes often haue had werrys: Neuertheles thys cruel Turke after the subduyng & oppressyng of the my¦serable & dolorous cytee of Constantynople hath begonne & or¦deyned agayns the cytee of Rhodes greter werrys theme euer dyd hys predecessours. For the entente and purpos of the sayde grete Turke was / to persecute and outerly vndoo the cry∣sten fayth. Therfore after the space of .xxiiii. yeres whenne that he had conquered many empyres / kyngdommes / and lordshyppes was wrothe to see the lytyll cytee of Rhodes stan¦dyng so nygh his kyngdommes and lordshyppes: not subiect / nor contrybutarye to hym: Therfore four dyuers tymys with shippes and men of werre assauted the castelles and places of the Isle of Rhodes / where bothe by lande and by water tho¦rough goddes grace he was venquysshed and ouerthrowe and of his oste many slayne with the Rhodyans / many drownd and many putte to flyght and to shame: Therfore after he sawe the noble hertys of the knyghtes and people of Rhodes that nether by fyghtyng / nether by power he might attayne
the cytee: thought and ymagyned by subtylyte and caute∣les to haue hys entente therof. And so often tymes after that he had grete part of Grece to hys obeysaunce temptyd to ma¦ke peas and amyte wyth the Rhodyans: so that they wold knowlege hym as theyre souuerayn: and yerely yolde hym a lytyll trybute / whiche condytyon the Rhodyans alleweye withseyed and dyffyed. And when he sawe that in no wyse he coude gette nor attayne trybute of rhodes in that manere: offerred theym yet peas: vpon thys condytyon. That the em¦bassedoures of the knyghtes of seynte Iohan of Ierusalem: that ys to saye of Rhodes shulde come to hys courte and pre∣sente to hym certayn royall yeftes: the whiche he thoughte to resceyue vnder the tytle of trybute: and so by wyles enten∣ded to make the sayde cytee of Rhodes trybutarye to hym. but he coude not spede hys fals purpos. For the noble and victo¦ryous Prynce and renomed lord The lord mayster of Rho∣des and hys pendent counseyl: refused of their ennemy peas nor wolde be of amyte with hym that was a persecutor of cry¦stes / yth & crystes relygyon: And so daye and nyghte the most nobelest knyghtes of the sayd Relygyon: accordyng to their ordre helped and defended oure fayth and the sayd cy∣tee of Rhodes. For thees causes now sayd the furyous ene∣mye conceyued agayns the cytee of Rhodes inestymable hate rede & wrathe: and ymagyned / yf he myght: outerly to dy¦stroye the sayde Rhodes. And to this crnel purpose he was al¦so meued by conseyl & persuasyons of the traytours of crystes
fayth: the whiche had in knowlege alle the places and secre¦tes of Rhodes. Among the whiche fals traytours & renega∣tes was one especyal of the cytee of Rhodee: called Antony Melagolo: a man vnkynd to god & to man. He was noble of byrth & euyll of condycyons & lyuyng / the whiche by fore tymes thorough euyl guydyng & onthryftenesse had brought hym selfe to pouerte. Thys man thought & ymagyned by hys fals & subtyl witte a mene to tray & putte in destruction his owen contrey. And therfore he dylygentely and pryuely es∣pyed in the cytee of Rhodes al the places defensybles & inde∣fensybles / and pourtrayed & peynted theym in a papire & bore the sayd pourtraytoure & papir to the cytee of Constanty¦nople / and anon after he shewed hit to the gretest cappetayn of the Turke / and gaue hym grete confort / that he shuld but in hys mynde & dispose hym seefe to the destructyon & captyu∣te of Rhodes. And so dede an other fals renegate called Dy∣metryus Sopheano / the whiche after the captyuyte & destru¦ctyon of the cytee of Nygrepont renayed & forsouke the fayth of chryste & wente to the Turk. Thys Dymentryus by fore ty¦mes had dwelled in Rhodes / and had ben embassedeur from the Turke to the Rhodyans: vnder a faynte & colour to desire peas. & so after the space of .iii. yeres whiche were spended & occupyed in the conseylyng of thes werkes & that it had ben shewed: that they myghte come to their entente. the forsayd capeteyne was wel pleased. To the whiche also many other renegates had gyuen by dyuers menes counseyl and comfort
But among them al the forsayd Antony: sayde & affermed That a grete part of the walles of the cytee of Rhodes was olde and in decaye. and that there were but fewe men of dyf¦fence in the cytee. and also they lakked vytaylles. and that they coude not haue in tyme of nede helpe of crysten kynges. For they were to ferre from theym. And al this was graun¦ded and for certayn affermed by Dymetryus & hys felawes renegaes. And so with theire fals comfort / it was thought necessarye to the partye of the Turke / to ordeyne theire engy∣nes and instrumentes: for the siege of Rhodes. In what ty¦me that thees thynges were thought and counseyled in Con¦stantynople among the turke and his counseyle / The vycto∣ryous Prynce and lord: The lorde mayster of Rhodes called Mayster Peter Daubusson: a man of high prudence and of the noble blode and hous of Fraunce / had knowlege of the conspyracye and fals ymagynacyon the whiche was wrought agaynest the cytee of Rhodes. And so by the grace of almigh¦ty god in the space of thre yeres next folowyng made grete reparacyons and renewed the olde walles of the forsayde cy¦tee of Rhodes: where as nede was. And also made pollitike and grete prouysyons: that is to saye / of wyne / whete and other vytaylles necessaryes. And wrote epysteles & lettres vnto alle contreyes / landes and prouynces of crysten relygi¦on for the knyghtes of his ordre / commandyng them to come kepe and defende the noble cytee of Rhodes. And so by the wil of god almyghty: Rhodes in al haste was fortefyed / wyth
vytaylles / shyppes: and men of werre. But the traytour Antony thenne beyng in the cytee of Constantinople and not hauyng knowlege of this grete prouycyon of Rhodes. com∣forted and exhorted the grete Basse / that ye to saye: the grete capetayne vnder the Turke. that he shulde in alle haste ordeyne hym to the siege of Rhodes. Wherupon the sayd Bassie aduertysed the grete Turke of the enformacyons of the sayd Antony and other renegates. Wherfore amonges the knygh∣tes and men of werre of the turkys party was calleed a gret parlement and conseyle. where many dyuers opynyons wer taken. For somme of theym sayde. That hyt was impossy∣ble to gete Rhodes so lyghtely as Antony had sayde. For the cyte was so strong and the knyghtes were so noble that they wolde rather lese theire lyues in fyghtyng fo: crystes lawe: and for the welfar of krystendom then euer to see in theyr lyf Rhodes in subiectyon of the Turke. Som of the turkes sayde That Rhodes lyghtly sholde be had. & that sith the tyme that Antony came to Constantinople whiche were but .iii yeres: the lorde Mayster of Rhodes couth not pourueye for so many dyf¦fautes of the cytee: lyke as the renegate Antony Melagolo had told and gyuen hym to vnderstande. Therfore hyt was fynally and in alle haste concluded in the foresayd parle∣ment and counseyle. That bothe by lande: and by see they shold make them redy for to goo to the siege of the sayd cy∣tee of Rhodes. And forthermore were there called many con¦nyng men in makyng of instrumens of werre / that is to saye
Bombardes / gownes / culuerynes / serpentines & suche other Among the whiche was one called George / renegate man of subtyl witte that dwelled in Counstantinople and there had wyfe & children. and for his subtil witte & grete con∣nyng in makyng of suche instrumentes of werre: had of the Turke grete rewardes / whiche George .xx. yeres afore pas¦sed had ben in Rhodes / the whiche Cytee thenne was not so strong as nowe. And whenne the Turke commanded / that the cytee of Rhodes shuld be pourtrayd and peynted on a ta¦ble and shewed vnto hym. Amonges alle other this George brought the best patron drawen & pourtrayed. and so by him and by other the Turke toke for the last conclusyon to sende & laye siege to Rhodes. Consydering that with instruments of werre al maner of walles may be thrawen down / And also consyderyng hys grete power and myghte: by the whiche he had conquered and goten .ii. Empyres .xii. kyngdommes and many other landes and places. He also consideryd the grete goodes and profettes the whiche he myght haue of Rho∣des / for asmoche as he knewe the grete comodytees & strenght of the same cytee of Rhodes / bothe by lande and by see. And forthermore ymagyned / yf he had Rhodes that he myght or deyne werres agaynest many other landes / bothe eest & west. Also this Turke knewe ryght wel: that the sayd Rhodes was an Isle of grete name & of goode aye: and that Rhodes in olde tyme was of grete amyte & chierte with the Romaynes And also he thoughte. yf he myght haue the forsayd cytee of
Rhodes: he shuld lyghtely put vnder his subiectyon al other countreyes aboute: and so in conclusyon he shuld conquere & subdue al the londes from the see called Egeum vnto the see called Yoneum. that ys to say from the est part of the world to the west part. Notwithstandyng somme of his capptay∣nes counseyled hym that he sholde not laye siege to Rhodes. & that was token of his euyll auenture. Neuerthelesse by his commandement / his men of werre came toward Rhodes / bothe by lande and by see. And they that went by see: sayled on til tyme they arryued to a countre called Lycya. And dayes after that they were arryued there with their naueye came also theder the other grete oste by lande: And soo they met eche other in the foresayd contrey of Lycya whiche is but xxii. myles from Rhodes. Also they carryed with them by see grete instrumens of werre. that ys to say Bumbardes. gow¦nes / serpentynes with many other instrumens of werre. for they were so grete & so many that they coud not bryng them fro Counstantinople: but saylyng with shippes and galee: And of the sayd naueye & companye was Basse: that ys to say capetayn in english a Greke whiche was of the noble hos called Palliogolus: the whiche when he shuld take shippyng asked after Antony Melagolo. & hit was told him that four dayes afore he was myscheuously slayne in Counstantinople Therfor he toke with hym Dymetryus renegate felawe to the sayde Antony. & anon after theire departyng fro Constantino¦ple by see: the turke send as sayd y hys other cost by land
that wente ferre aboute by the countreyes of Asya for fere lest crysten men shuld knowe theyre entente. The Turke also clo¦sed and stopped alle maner of passayges of his landys. saue the secrete weyes that his oste wente. Neuerthelesse the lord Mayster of Rhodes by his grete witte & dylygence had know¦lege of alle this array. For the Turke had messyngers that were not all trewe: for som of thayme told thayre maysters conseyle. But when the oste that wente by lande came to Ly¦cye the Rhodyans had grete meruayle what they were. and the turkes made a commyn sclandyr to dysceyue the Rhodians and saydyn that theyr lord the grete Turke was dede / and they were sende thedyr to kepe the contrey of Lycye from harm of ennemyes. But the lord Mayster of Rhodes had know∣lege of al thees wyles & falsede of the Turke. And therfore he wyth grete dylygence made strong wyth men of werre and vytaylles all the holdes / bothe castelles and forslettes within the Isle of Rhodes. That ys to saye / Longon / The Castylle of Seynt Petre / Feracle / Lynde / Monoleto. And alle the people of the Isle of Rhodes wythdrewe to the stronge holdes with theyre goodes and catelles. And the barle that was rype lyghtly they gederyd hyt vppe and toke hit with thaym And be cause that whete and other maner of cornes were not alle rype thay plukkyd thaym vppe fro the ground as they were and broughte thayme to the townes and holdes. And whenne thay were in doyng of these werkys with grete haste and furye the wache that was on the toppe of the hylle besyde
seynte stephen shewed a token & a knowleche: that in the west from Counstantinople was on the see saylyng a grete nom∣bre of shippes. And thenne the most parte of the peple of rho¦des wente vnto the hye places & sawe theim. And anone the same shippes wente toward a town called Physoom. whiche ys in the countreye called Lycye vpon the see syde .xxii. my¦les from Rhodes: and there they landed & receyued the men of werre that, came theder by lande by the countrey of asya as I haue sayde afore. And thenne they tourned theyme in the see toward Rhodes. and so in a shorte tyme they werre at the bankes of the Isle of Rhodes. And the nombre of the shippes that came to the bankes of Rhodes was a honderd. And ths was in the yere of our lord a thousand four honderd & fo schore the .x. kalendre of the moneth of Iune. And anon with grete dylygence they voyded theire shyppes of the men of wer¦re and of their ordonnances. And the men of werre made their parkes and their tentes strongly vpon the hylle of seint Ste∣phen afore sayd. And afterward they putted theyre or∣donnance on the see banke vnder the hylle of Seynte Stephen wherfore the Rhodyans sawe all theym that were on the hyll But they myghte not see theire ordonnances and instrumens of werre whiche were on the see banke vnder the hylle: be cause of the hyenesse of the hylle. And soo anone the shyppes wente and came agayne from the bankes of Rhodes to Physoom. bryngyng wyth theyme at euery tyme their men of wrere to¦ward Rhodes. And in the meane whyle somme of the turkes
on horsebake and on fote the moste hardyest ranne to the wal¦les of Rhodes wyth grete menassing and crakyng. And the Rhodyans wyth grete manhode wente agaynest theyme / and putte theyme to flyghte and slewe many of theyme. And in the nexte daye folowyng the turkes made agayn an other assaute whiles the Rhodyans were at dyner. but also they were putte to flyghte and som of theyme to deth. But there was one of the knyghtes of Rhodes the whiche auentured him selfe to ferre and was slayne of the turkes. and thenne they toke hys heede and putte yt on a spere and ranne with grete myrth and Ioye to theire companye and oste. And the body was broughte to Rhodes wyth the rayemente. The turkes a∣none after sette thre bombardes of grete vyolence in the chyr∣cheyarde and gardens of Seynte Antony: whiche was but a lytill space from Rhodes. And with thees bombardes they stu¦dyed and thoughte to thrawe downe the hye toure & strong place of Rhodes called / the toure of Seynte Nycolas: and couered their bombardes wyth grete logges and trees & bour¦des of grete defence. But whenne the Rhodyans had spyed it they alsoo ordeyned thre grete bombardes agaynes the oste of the turkes: whiche casted throe the ryghte syde of theire oste grete and myghty stones: whiche dyd theyme grete harme. And in the mornyng folowing George the grete gonner / of the whiche we haue sayde afore: came sodeynly as amasid man to the dyche of Rhodes toward the palays of the Lord may∣ster / and saluted and greted the Rhodyans frendely and
mekely cryed and prayed / that he myght come in to the ci¦tee / and so he was resceyued. And be cause that he had the rayement and leuerey of the Turke / somme smote at hym. But many dyffended hym and brought hym vnto the Lord mayster of Rhodes. This George was a personable man and welbesene: of grete eloquence / and of grete malyce / a duche man borne. And anone he was asked: whiche was the cause of hys comyng theder. He answerde. For the fayth and re∣lygyon of Ihesu cryste / and for the welfare and worship of alle crystendom. And be cause that he forsoke the fals byleue of the Turke: therfore he was receyued with grete ioye. and also his purpos was gretely preysed yf he wold abyde sted∣fastely in hyt as he sayde. Anone after yt was asked him. what oste the Turke had sende agaynest Rhodes / and what nombre of fyghtyng men: and what ordenance of instrumens of werre. George with boldenes & with witte: & as it semed with throth answerd to the questyons and sayd / that the turk had the nombre of an honderd thousand fyghtyng men / and xvi. grete bombardes euerychon of .xxii. fote of lenght / of the whiche the lest casted stones euery stone of .ix. spannes in com¦pas aboute. But within Rhodes were many opynyons and dyuers sentences of the comyng of the sayd George from the Turke to crysten folke. For somme sayd: that he came as a spye. and that afore thys tyme he with grete malyce had done many thynges agaynest god. and specyally had forsaken crystes lawe. and that for certeyn he werked nowe for to be∣traye
Rhodes. The moste parte sayde: that he was a grete mayster in makyng of instrumentes of werre. and that he was a defensyble man in what someuer place he was in: and that he came to Rhodes as a penytent man that had forsaken his fayth and his maker / and that suche a wyse man as he was: wolde not come to Rhodes allon to dysceyue suche a pru¦dent man: as the lorde mayster was: and suche a grete fely∣shyp of knyghtes of Rhodes. And so was thought for the be¦ter: that George sholde abyde in Rhodes. But anone fewe dayes after / somme that loued the crysten fayth in the oste of the Turke shotre arowes with lettres into Rhodes: whiche lettres were fonde and warned the Rhodyans: to be ware of the treson of George. Therfore the lord mayster comman ded anone. that george sholde be kepte with .vi. might men whiche sholde take hydde on hym / But neuertheles he herde & had at alle owres georgys conseyle to suche prouycyons that belongeth to engynes and instrumentes of werre / After this the turkes with grete myghte of bombardes and other instru∣mentes of werre laboured day and nyghte to putte down & ouerthrawe a place whiche was a quater of a myle wythin the see by the weste banke of Rhodes: whiche maked with her walles and wynges a plesaunt hauen to shippes and galey¦es. and ys called the tour of Seynt Nycholas / and it was made in the olde tyme and after the olde and bygge makmg of walles. The sayde tour was sette so nygh the citee of Rho¦des be cause that no persone by lande nor ly water shold come
to Rhodes withoute their lycence. And also the mouth of the hauen and that place was so streyte / that nether galeye ne∣ther shippe myght entre / but only one ot ones. and aboue thys porte was the forsayd seynt Nycolas toure / the whiche was made of the Rhodyans within thye honderd yeres. And the turkes thoughte: that if they had this tour in their subie∣ctyon: that they sholde lyghtely ouercome Rhodes / considering the grete commodyte of the hauen and of the selfe place of the tour. And therfore they casted agaynes the tour thre honderd grete stones of bombardes and brake the toure stoutely & put hit in a grete danger to be ouerthrawen / and in moche lasse space thenne euer the Rhodyans thoughte that hit sholde haue ben possible. But neuerthelesse the nether olde and auncyon walle stode stedfastely. for hyt was made in olde tyme of a bygge matere and substance. And anone the lord mayster alleway prouydent and besye came to the tour with a barge ful of men / and made reparacyons with stones and trees / as in suche a tyme the case requyred / and pute in the ur many fyghtyng men and the manlyest of hys oste / the whiche sholde be the strenghte & the kepyng of that place in the toure that was so beten in the syde toward the west: that ther was lefte no maner of reparacyon: but with handes and nombre of strong men. After that thees prouycyon had ben made in the forsayde tour: they ordeyned men of werre vnder the wal¦les of the cytee and vnder the walle vppon the banke of the see: the whiche was from the castell of Seynte Peter vnto a
certayne place called Mandrache. and there were men on hor¦sebake & on fote / that shulde lette the turkes to come to land in that coste: and there abowte the see is at euery tyde flowe and ebbe: wherfore were there thrust done pypes and ton∣nes and tabelles full of nayles: so that the turkes what som¦euer ebbyng befel shulde not passe ouer And forthermore was made another grete prouycyon: in that parte of the cyte wher the lorde mayster stode in clene harnesse. for in that part were ordeyned bombardes & other grete instrumentes castyng grete stones for to breke the galeyes of the turkes. and also vnder the tour that the Lorde mayster kepte were lytill shippes fyl∣led with gonne pouder and brymme stone and other suche thynges: the whiche when the galeyes of the turkes came ner shulde be putte in fyre to the destructyon of the galeyes of the turkes. And whenne thees thynges were so ordeyned: all the Rhodyans with manhode abode from daye to daye / and from oure to our: that the turkes sholde gyue theym assaute / and in the mornyng neyt folowyng the turkes came with fifty ga¦leyes from the hylle of Seynt Stephen aforsayd toward the cytee and they thoughte shortely to come a lande / and there they made a grete crye and a grete noyse with trompes and taberettys & other suche instrumentes be cause that they shold make afered oure folke of theym for their grete noyse But anone after whenne the turkes with theire galeyes came nere the toure aforesayd: the bombardes and other instrumentes of werre whiche were there ordeyned. brake with grete might
the arayes of the turkes and put theym offe fro the cost with their grete myscheffe. And in thys dede the Lord Mayster of Rhodes hym selfe came oute of the walles of the sayde toure wyth hys companye: for to fyghte hand for hand wyth the turkes. and there were ouerthrawen and putte to dech .vii honderd turkes and many were wounded and many drow∣ned / as somme sayden that came to Rhodes from the turkes. After thye the Lord mayster clene armed and rydyng vp¦on a myghty hors came agayne to Rhodes with his feleshyp: as an Emperour vyctoryous / and came to the chyrche: where was the ymayge of oure lady: called our Lady on the hylle of Felerene: whiche place ys full of myracles. and there he kneled downe and yolde thankynges and leuynges God and oure lady of hys vyctorye. and afterward came to hys pallays and howshold for to refresshe hys companye And so whenne the turkes sawe / that they coude not ouercome the forsayde toure: they purposed to breke the walles of the cytee wyth grete bombardes and gonnes in dyuers places of the same cytee / and that / be cause that the puyssance & might of the Rhodyans shold be dyuyded / and that they shold not be all in one place: as they had ben late in the defence of the forsayd toure of Seynte Nycolas. and also they dede yt for more lyghtely to ouercome the strenghte of the forsayd coure Therfore in the nyghte nexte folowyng the turkes with grete noyse broughte grete bombardes and gonnes toward the wal¦les of Rhodes in that syde of the cytee where as the Iues
kepyng wache & defence by the comandement of the lord may sier. and before the sayd walles they putted .viii. grete instru¦mentes: whiche casted grete stones in the cyte. & had made ronde abowte bollewerkes to the instrumentes, because that the Rhodyans shulde not hurte theym. Another grete instrument they putted atte fote of a hylle toward the weste: aboue the whiche hylle stode the galowes of the Iustyce of Rhodes: and from that place they casted grete stones in rhodes / in that part of the cytee where the wynde mylnes were / and brake theim all to pecs. Whenne the Lorde mayster sawe the purpos and the wyles of hys enemyes whiche had then made moche more strenghte and myghte then euer they had done by fore: he or deyned in Rhodes processyons generalles with grete deuccyon of hym and alle hys people of Rhodes. and after that they had made theyr prayers to god & to our lady in whoes qua∣rell they faught: the Lorde mayster anon commanded to putte down the houses and habytacyons of the Iues that were with in the cytee by the walles: called the Iure of Rhodes. Also were there made wythinne the cytee of Rhodes grete and migh¦ty dyches: for the sauyng of the body of the cytee / yf the tur¦kes gate the fyrste walles. and therfore they made day and myghte grete werkes / as walles of tymbre and many other thynges defensybles / to the whiche labour euery creature in rho¦des of alle maner of aage bothe men and women of alle ma∣ner states putted and aplyed theym selfe and theyre goo∣des wyth grete wylle and grete deuocyon for Ihesus sake.
And in thees whyle / the bombardes and grete gonnes of the turkes casted downe and destryed the walles of the cytee of Rhodes / wyth so grete myghte and strenghte and with soo grete wonder: that alle they that were in Rhodes / strangers and other olde and yong of all the countreyes of crystendom sayd / that they herde neuer strokes of bombardes so grete and so horryble as thylk were. The fals traytour George sayde al¦so. that hyt was Impossible after hys thynkyng to fynde in all the world suche instrumentes of werre / that were so grete and horryble of noyse as they were / for they of a towne cal¦led Reede whyche ys an honderd myles from Rhodes toward the eest herde the grete brute and the grete noyse as they sayd afterward. And also for to shewe and declare the meruoy∣lous gretenesse of the sayde bombardes and gonnes: the grete pyles and postes strong and myghty that were stykked in the gronde behynde atte taylle of the forsayde grete bombar∣des gaue suche grete and myghty shakyng that the howses of Rhodes other whyles shaked in suche a wyse like yf hyt hadde ben a yerth quake. But they of Rhodes alleway besy and prouydent stopped wyth trees the grete ruyne of theyre walles / and made also many dyches wythinne the cytee. The turkes vexed also the Rhodyans wyth many other and dyuers instrumentes of werre. for they ordeyned rond aboue the foresayde Cytee of Rhodes certayn instrumentes of werre the whyche ben called Slynges or Engynes / And the tur∣kes with suche instrumentes of werre casted in to the eyere
a pype full of grete stones the whyche foll vpon the houses of Rhodes and putted theym in a wrecched ruyne wyth grete murdre of theym that were within for that tyme: and for∣thermore they putte in a grete thoughte and sorowe alle the hole cytee of Rhodes. for noo persone was sure in hous wyth oute he were in a kaue. But neuerthelesse the prudente and wyse Lorde Mayster and hys noble conseyle fonde a remedye as hit foloweth. For anone he commanded: that alle ma∣ner of women and all folke of yong aage and olde aage not able for to fyghte shulde be putte by the walles of the towne in a voyde place. for the guyse of the cytees ys / to haue next the walles suche a voyde place. and there were made myghty schaffoldes the whiche were not so hye as the walles of the cy¦tee. for be cause that the turkes sholde not aspye hyt. for in suche voyde place they casted noo stones: but into the myddes of the cyte. The yong men able to fyghte kepte theym self & eshewed the castyng of the stones in the day lyght. and in the nyght they hyded theym in streng places & kaues / so that by the myracles of god & prayers of crysten people fewe men or bestes of the cyte were hurted. The turkes not vnderstanding howe god pourneyed & kepte the Rhodyans harmeles / ordeyned two grete slynges in a hye place toward the weste: from the whiche they myght seen all the cyte of Rhodes. and fro thens they casted grete stones in the myddes of the cytee. In thees meane whyles whenne thees thynges were so ordeyned: the grete basse of the turke sawe & consyderyd / that the dylygence
of the Lord mayster noyed moche to hys power and to hys counseyles. Therfore he dysposed by meane whyles to putte to deth the forsayd Lord mayster of Rhodes. And ordeyned two turkes / of the whyche one of theyme shulde goo & yeld hym selfe to the Rhodyans for to lyue in crystes fayth & telle the Rhodyans / that another of the turkes whiche was hys fo¦lawe sholde also come to Rhodes and forsake the fals byleue of the Turke. But the basse / that ys to saye the cappetayne of the turkes had ordeyned / that the same felaw shold bring poyson into Rhodes: wyth whiche the Lorde Mayster sholde be putte to deth: and be cause that thees two turkes shold auen¦ture theym selfe to poyson the Lord Mayster: the basse hadde promysed theim many grete rewardes. But he that came to Rhodes afore hys felawe as we haue sayde was in hys tal∣kyng and in hys purpos: and in alle hys desyng in Rho∣des fonde inconstante and varyante. wherfore anone the Rho∣dyans had demyng and playne opynyon: that he was come for to worke som trayson. And so after dylygence and sraye examynacyon: he confessed the trayson and hys boldenes and therfore was he putte to dethe as a traytre: The daye neyce folowyng hys felawe no thyng knowyng of thys: came to∣ward Rhodes / but the crysten men stroke sore vpon hym wher¦fore he fledde and torned agayne to the turkes / & so the basse was begyled of his trayson. In thees whyles the turkes wer¦red agayns one syde of the cyte called the warde of the Italy¦ans. & in a derk nyghte they came so nygh that they putted
gonnes and grete bombardes vpon the bankes of the dyches: and made grete strenghte wyth trees rond abowte that they sholde not be broken with no maner shottes of the Rhodyans. But anone after they were spyed and sene. wherfore there was a conseyle made in Rhodes: where fyfty lykkely yong men and veray louers of oure lord Ihesu cryste promysed them selfe there to deye in that quarell: or to destroye in that same nyghte the sayd grete bombardes and gonnes with alle theire araye. And so a knyght of the ordre of Seynt Iohan was capeteyne to the sayd fyfty lykkely yong men. and they came pryuely by the bothome of the dyche wyth certayne lad∣ders whiche they broughte wyth theym to the bankes wher as the bombardes and gonnes were: and made suche a fray that the turkes fledde away fro the bombardes: and .x. of theym were slayne. and also they destreyed alle that ordonnaunce and casted in the dyche. And thys done the forsayd fyfty yong men wyth theyre capeteyne came agayne in to the cyte of Rhodes as men vyctoryous. Wherfore the Lord Mayster of Rhodes gaue vnto theym many worshypfull yeftes be cau¦se of theyre vertuous manhode: and for to gyue courayge & exhortacyon to alle other. And they were resceyued in Rho∣des wyth grete glorye and Ioye & also they had grete than∣kynges of alle the people of Rhodes. Therfore fewe dayes af¦ter that thys was done: the turkes for despyte and grete an¦noye of the foresayde thynges whiche were done vnto theyme made anone redy a grete ordonnaunce and came agayne vn∣to
the tour of seynt nycolas for to haue it. & anon with their bombardes boldely they casted downe the bollewerkes & forslet¦tes. And as faste as they casted theym downe the Rhodyans repayred theim agayn. The turkes also made a long bigge of the length of a quater of a myle. the whiche recched from the banke there as the turkes laye: vnto the banke of seynt Ni¦colas toure. and was so large: that .vi. men on horseback myghte ryde a fronte. and was made with voyded pypes and with bordes strongly nayled vpon them. & purposed to beynge the same brigge by craft into the water. and they fested and knytted strongely to the sayde brigge grete and myghts ropes whiche had in thother ende strong ancures: whiche ancurs they fasted with a bote to the nether bank of the tour / so that the brigge with the drawyng of the corde and flotyng shulde haue recched to the sayd banke. Anone afoer that the Rhedi¦ans had knowleche of thees werkes. a shipman wel experte in swymmyng: wente by nyghte and noted the cordes fro the ancre and knytted theim vnto a stone of the banke: so that lyghtely whenne the turkes drewe the corde: they knewe wel that they were begyled of the Rhedyans. The lord may¦scer of Rhodes vnderstandyng thys nobe acte: rewarded the forsayd shypman worshipfully and ryght largely. And so whenne the turkes sawe and knewe the grete frawde whyche was done to theym of the Rhodyans: thoughte and ordeyned that they wold brynge the forsayd brygge theder wyth grete strenghte. and nombre of botes being full of rowers whyche
and toure: grete stones of bombardes and of gonnes & wyld fyre and arowes of bowes and balestres. And soo alle the nyght from twelfe the clocke vnto. x. in the daye they faught all by derke: but as the fyre of the bombardes and the flam∣mes of the wyldfyre gaue lyghte. And so after that the tur¦kes were put oute: with their grete dammage and harme. & that the men of Rhodes had the vyctorye: a man myght haue seen thre dayes folowyng ded men of the turkys partye: ca∣sted and lvyng in the banke of the see toward Rhodes. whi¦che were fonde arayed wyth golde and syluer and precious clothyng and parte of their araye was seen flotyng in the see. whiche geyre and araye was taken vppe by the crysten men with grete profyte and wynnyng. And in also moche more was thys vyctorye in gladnesse to the Rhodyans: becau¦se that there were slayne many noble turkes: and in especial a syn of the grete turke. the deth of the whiche was a grete sorowe to the grete turke and to all hys people. and hys bo∣dy was fonde on the banke spolyed of the Rhodyans. And anone after thys grete fyghtyng: somme turkes yelde them to the crysten people of Rhodes: and sayde for trouth that ther were slayne of the turkes thre thousand and fyfe honderd: and that the basse by the space of thre dayes: for sorow & thoughte spake wyth noo man of hys companye nor with none other. And anon auysed the grete turk of thys grete myschyfe that was befalle to theym. And in so moche more was wroth / that wyth so grete deth of hys people and myscheuous harmes / he
had noo thyng profyted agaynest Rhodes: nether agaynes the forsayde tour: but with hye dammage and shame was putte offe / as not able wyth alle that feleshyp and myght to ouercome the cyte of Rhodes / as he hadde pourposed. And so after that the turkes sawe: that they coude not wynne the toure by strenghte and myghte: anone they tourned theire fantasye and studyed wyth alle theire vertue and myghte to assaute the cytee. and in especyal they made grete assaut agaynest the walles that were kepte by the Iues: and al¦so agaynes the walles that the nacyon of Italye kepte and defended. and shortely the turkes made grete dammages and hurtes all abowte the walles of the cytee wyth theire grete gonnes and bombardes: in so moche that they thought to come by wyles and subtyll meanes nygh to the walles of the cyte And so they made certayn dyches in dyuers places of the fyl∣des: and couered theym with grene bowes / and after∣ward they pritted erthe and turnes vppon the same: and myned faste & prynely. for they pourposed to come / to fyghte hande for hande wyth the Rhodyans. Also they ordeygned certayne logges whiche they coueryd wyth grene bowes be cause that they sholde not be knowen: and fro thens they shotte to the walles of Rhodes grete bombardes / gomies and serpentynes in suche a wyse: that noo man durste loke out of the walles of the cytee to theire fylde and to their werkes. And in this whyle the turkes fylled a certayne place of the dyche of the ci¦tee wyth trees and stones and suche other thynges: so that
the dyche was made equall and playnnyssed vnto the heyght of the broken walle: soo that lyghtely they myghte come for to feyghte hande for hande with the Rhodyans. Then the Lorde Mayster of Rhodes consyderyng and seeyng openly the grete hardynesse of the turkes: and also the grete daunger that the cytee of Rhodes stede in / he as a noble Prynce louyng and defendyng hys sayde cytee and lordshyppe and hys people: wyth grete dysygence called alle hys famous knyghtes and gouernours of hys werree: and thenne he declared & shewed to theyme wyth prudence and eloquence the grete daungers / in the whiche by the furye and open boldenesse of the turkes / Rhodes the moste crysten cytee stode in. Fewe dayes by fore the siege of Rhodes / was come from the royame of Fraunce to Rhodes the myghty and exellente knyghte named Anto∣ny Daubusson: whyche was brother to the Lord Mayster of Rhodes. Thys Antony Daubusson was Lord in Fraunce of a place whyche ys called Montelyon / a man of grete wyse∣dom and counseyle / strong and hardy in werres and ba∣taylles. He departed from the royaume of Fraunce wyth a companyr of clenly and lykkely men: whiche were able to fyghte vnder what somme euer baner that belonged to kyng or Emperour. And hys entente and purpos was: to vysy∣te deuoutely the blessyd and holy sepulchre of cure saueour Ihesu cryste in Ierusalem. But whenne he vnderstode and perceyued: that the grete Turke sholde come and laye siege to Rhodes: he pourposed to helpe and defende the cytee of rho∣des
wyth Iuborte of hys lyfe and all hys companye. for he thoughte: that in noo maner place: nor in noo maner wyse he myghte spende hys bloode better: and more for the welfare of hys soule: thenne there: where he shulde fyghte for the pre¦cyous name of oure Lord Ihesu cryste: and for the ryght∣full quarell of all crysten fayth: and to kepe from captyuy∣te of the turkes the noble cytee of Rhodes. and be cause that hys holynesse and hys herty loue whiche he hadde to the fayth of Ihesu cryste: and also that hys grete manhode was well knowen to all the knyghtes of Rhodes: the Lord Mayster his brother and all the counseyle of Rhodes. elected and chosed hym capetayn and gouernour of all the men of werre. And soo manly and wysely he ordeygned and dysposed hym to all suche thynges that shulde noe to the pourpes of the turkes and that shulde helpe and strengh Rhodes for the worshyp / helthe and perpetuell glorye of alle crystendom: And anone after thys he hadde a grete ofte in whyche were many gentyll knyghtes / Baylyffes / pryours / Mayseres and of the order of Seynte Iohan. Of the whyche the most man lyest men were borne in England and in Fraunce / and in other countreyes of the weste. There were also merchauntes and men of dyuers occupacyons of the selfe Rhodes / and of many places of Grede: the whyche in wysedom and prudence of many worldly thynges hadde knowlege and experrence. Alle thees to geder / wyth one word / wyth one herte / and wyth one feythe / pourposed and swere to defende and kepe
the cytee of Rhodes: or elles to dye gladdely and kyndely for hym that dyed for vs alle. And soo anone after a man of Grece / wyse and experte in sieges counseyled the lord may¦ster and the Rhodyans to make and ordeygne an engyne cal¦led Trebuke lyke a slynge / whyche was grete / hye & mygh¦ty and casted grete and many stones into the hoste of the tur¦kes. and so by thys meanes the turkes were in grete fere & Iubere. for their loggyses and tentes were broken and smy¦ten to grounde: wyth moche & grete dammage and hurte to theire gonnes / bombardes / serpentynes and all theire ordon¦nances of werre: so that in fewe dayes they resceyued thees hurtes and dammayges wythoute nombre. We haue sayd before: howe the turkes fulfylled a parte of the dyche by the walles wyth stones. And be cause that the Rhodyans coude ot voyde hit openly: they made a myne vnder the ground: by the whyche pryuely they bare the stones in the cytee. But the turkes anon perceyued: that the heyght and the hepe of the sto¦nes was made lesse / & that they coude not crepe vppe by that weye: but yf they hasted theyme: & soo they dyd. But be¦fore the rhodyans with grete besynesse fonde a remedye to the defawtes of the walles: the whiche the turkes by that syde of the cytee had caste downe to the grounde. For they withinne the walles not ferre from the dyche made a fronte of a walle wyth stakes and erthe in the myddes and wyth buskes thru¦sted strongly to geder and tempered it wyth water lyke as they make a mudwalle: and vpon thys walle they putted
gonnes / culuerynes / wildfyre and barelles full of pyche & sulfur and grete hepes of stones & suche thynges: that shuld lette the turkes to clymbe vppe: so that hit was a pleasur to see their besynes agaynes the begynnyng of the turkes assaute And for to haue in thys werke counseyle: was theder brought the forsayde George traytour. but he shewed no cunnyng in the defence of the cytee as he hadde promysed / and as the rho¦dyans trusted. For the fals and wikked man was clea∣syd to see so grete ruyne in the pryncypall walles of Rhodes: and hoped that lyghtely the turke sholde euercome yt. Ne∣uertheles for to couer hys mynde and malyce counseyled the Rhodyans to sette a bombarde: whiche sholde caste from thens to the hoste of the turkes for to breke theire bombardes. but he wyste well that therof they shulde heue grete hurte: whd t had ben a token & couenaunt betwene the turke and hym: or of hys owen auyse dyd hyt: thynkyng that the turkes shuld in so moche more casie toward that parte for to veeke the Rho∣dyans shotte. But soo as he counseyled was done. and a∣none grete harmes and dammages came of hyt. for the tur∣kes dressed all their shotte thede: ward and gaue greter hur¦ie to the broken walle. And in thys whyle were shorte aro∣wes into Rhodes wyth lettres: whyche blamed George that he dyd not hys deuer for the turke in Rhodes: in also moche / as he gaue not theyme certayne tokenes of the iuyne and con∣dycyon of the cytee. But they knewe not howe george was kepte for suspecte within Rhodes: as a man gylte of trayson
And whenne hyt was tolde and shewed to George. He an∣swered boldely and wyth shrewed langayge: wherfore the Rhodyans hadde hym in suspecyon and was putte in pryson And anone by wyse men was examyned and fonde varya∣ble in hys answeres: wherfore wyth tokyns suffycyent was pute to tormente: where he confessed: howe that the Turke hadde sende hym theder to betraye Rhodes yf he myghte / as he hadde betrayed many other places in Grece. whyche confessy¦on he affermed after also wythoute tourmente. And sayd: howe the Turke had byd hym: yf Rhodes myght not thenne be goten: to abyde neuertheles in Rhodes all the siege tyme: & lenger to espye all the condycyons and maners of their defen¦ces & that afterward he sholde telle yt to the Turk for to pur∣ee strenger siege: & more to the pourpos of victorye. For the turkes entencon: was fynally / to haue the cyte of Rhodes. Wherfore George hadde of hym grete yeftes and rewardes. But anone after George was dampned to deth: and in the syghte of all the people of Rhodes for hys trayson / and mysche¦uous counseyles was hanged. and anone after euery man of Rhodes retourned agayne to kepe theire place wyth grete gladdenes that George the fals traytour of crystys fayth and he that hadde studyed to putte to deth soo many noble and worshypfull knyghtes: and to defowle and rauessche so ma∣ny goode and honeste women and holy vyrgyns / hadde atte laste fonde a nynde accordyng to hys traysons and mysche∣uous dedys. Anon after thys the basse that ys to say the grete
Capetayne of the Turke caused other lettres to be casted in the cytee of Rhodes: in whyche lettres he conforted and war¦ned the bourgeyses of the sayde cytee and other merchauntes of crystendomme whyche were wythinne the cytee: that they shulde fynde the meanes for to yelde theyme and delyuere to hym the Cytee and they sholde haue theire landes and their goodes saue and theire bodyes free and harmelees. for he wolde but onely dystroye the knyghtes and men of wee be¦yng wythin Rhodes: and yf they dyd otherwyse / he menas¦sed to putte theim all equally to deth. and by thees meanes and cauteles he ymagyned and thoughte to putte dyuccyon amonges the people of Rhodes. but he coude not spede his ful purpes: for he fonde theyme Iuste and trewe to God and to the ordre of Rhodes. And soo whenne he sawe and consyderid that thys fayled hym: he yet by wylenesse sende a man in the nyghte tyme to the dyches of Rhodes: in that syde of the cy∣tee where stode a chyrche of oure Lady called Elemeerra. Thys man was a Greke and late had forsaken crystys fayth and wente to the Turke. And so thys greke called and sayde to theym that wached ther: that the greie capeteyn of the turk wolde sende an embasseteur to the Lord Mayster: yf the Rho¦dyans wolde lete hym goo and come sure. They answered and sayd to thys man: that they were well contente that the grete capeteyne of the Turke sholde sende hys embasserour vnto the dyche and bollewerke of that syde of the cytee: and that there sholde be a noble man / the whiche shulde gyue an
answere for the Lorde mayster: & so the day next folowing the Embassetoure of the forsayde Capetayne came theder: And sayde: howe that he hadde grete meruayle: that suche a lytyll cytee wolde withstande and resyste agaynest the grete myghte and puyssaunce of the dredefull Turke: whyche had conquered .ii. Emperys and so many Kyngdommes. Ther¦fore he exhorted theym / to haue pyte of iheyme selfe: and not to be the cause. that the cytee of Rhodes sholde be taken by the assaute of the turkes and by strong hande. for thenne the tur¦kes sholde putte to myscheffe and to vyolence / bothe men and women beyng in the cytee of Rhodes: and forthermore he sayd that yf they of Rhodes wolde desyre & take of the turkes peas the sholde haue hyt / wyth the possessyon of the selfe Rhodes / and wyth alle theire goodes: or elles they shulde be putted ut¦terly to destructyon with all maner cruelte: and so he mena∣shed to be / in shorte tyme to come: and therfore he bade theim answere: wheder they wolde peas or werre. Thenne anon an¦swered the noble and prudente knyghte that there was for the Lorde Mayster: and sayde. howe that the Rhodyans hadde grete meruaylle: that the turkes with soo grete naueye / and wyth so strong armee: agaynes the honour of all manly wer¦ryers shulde eyhorte theyre ennemyes to peas. And sayd that the Rhodyans vnderstode and knewe ryght well the feynte & fals colour of theym: for they wyste well: that they dyd hit be cause that they sholde preue their hertes. Therfore he sayde that nether by yeftes nether by menasshes they wold do shame
to crystendom: and / that wythinne the cyte of Rhodes was a comyn acorde among the grekes & latynes and al the people of Rhodes / whiche wold rather dye for crystes fayth: thenne to be of amyte and of the lawe of Mahumete. And yf it so were / that the turkes wolde breke vppe their siege and turne agayne to their countreye: and after sende embassetoures to Rhodes for peas: the Rhodyans sholde therof by conseyl gyue theym an answere. but syth that they were so myghty in ar¦mes: they bade theym vse and doo that they came fore: and that thorough the grace of Ihesu they shold knowe / that they had not to doo nor to fyghte wyth men of Asea their countrey couherdes and vnherty as women. but they sholde knowe wel and perceyue / that they shulde feghte and be in hande wyth strong manly and crysten people of Rhodes. After the why¦che answere / the turkes wyth loe chiere and halfe shamely contenaunce departed from theyme and tourned agayne to their sie and to theyre capeteyne. And so the more that the rho¦dyans wythstode the turkes wyth myghte and wysedom: the more waxed the turkes furyous agaynes Rhodes. And anon after thys wyth grete bombardes / gonnes / engynes and all other suche instrumentes of werre: they vexed and greued the Rhodyans. and purposed to preue: yf the dedys of the Rho∣dyans sholde accorde wyth theyre grete wordes. Therfore lyke wyse as they hadde done a grete and horryble assaute agay∣nest the toure of Seynte Nycolas .xxxvii. dayes passed or deyned and dressed alle theyre bombardes & gonnes of werre
alle theire ordonnance and theire myghte agaynest the pryn¦cypal strenghte and moste neweste walles of the cyte of Rho¦des: howe be hyt that they were / large / newe and fortefyed wyth myghty toures and bollewerkes: neuertheles wyth ca∣styng of thre thousand and fyfe honderd grete bombardes sto∣nee: they were horrybly brused and thrawen downe. And ma¦ny worshipfull places and howses of the Rhodyans by that syde wyth the hurte & the ruyne of that newe walle were mys¦cheuously broken & desryed all to pieces. The whiche mysera¦ble case and horryble ruyne fered many of the Rhodyans her and putted theyme to more thoughte and sorowe thenne euer they were sythen the comyng of the turkes theder. But the Lorde Mayster as a stedfaste Prynce trustyng in Ihesu cryste and in hys swete mother marye and in Seynte Iohan Baptyste conforted alle the people: so that nether the knygh¦tes / nether the pryours nether the baylyffes of the ordre / ne∣ther merchaunts / nether people in Rhodes were afered: but gladly as the case ste were redy and contente to fyght hand for hande wyth the turkes at broken walles and playne pla∣ce. And so the turkes by two or thre euenynges folowyng ca∣me to the dyches wyth theire taberettys and made songes of myrthe: hopyng that wythin shorte dayes they sholde gete rho¦des. And the Rhodyans from thother syde of the broken wal∣le answered thayme as merely agayn wyth trompettes and claryons. but the Lorde Mayster knowyng by hys prudence / that anone wyth grete myght & furye the turkes wold come
theder to assaute the cytee: he fortefyed the walles with knigh¦tes of hys ordre and moste manlyest werryers: and he hym selfe by the broken walle was full of besynes / to teche / warne and comforte all the people abowte hym: and was redy & atte alle owres abode to gyue socout to the knyghtes & werry ere on the walles. and so was alle hys people from the hy∣est degree vnto the loest dysposed. In thys whyle the turkes made theyme redy in their ofte for to come and gyue assaute And made a commyn crye: that the grete Turke gaue theym all the goodes that were in Rhodes: and that they sholde to∣ke al the yong chyldren in Rhodes and cause theim to enaye their fayth: and they that were aboue .x. yeres vnto .xx. sholde haue their throtes kette: and all that were aboue that aage yf they were taken alyue shuld be perfed thorow the fon¦demente and thorow the hede with a long stake. wherefore they bare wyth theyme to the assaut .viii. thousand sta∣kes: and that the Turke all onely was contente to be vycto¦ryous and lorde possessour of Rhodes. all the turkes came toward Rhodes. but afore that they gaue assaute after their fals beleue called to their helpe Mahumete and wasshed theim all naked in rennyng water: in a kene of purgacyon of their synnes: and after they arayed theim euerychon after hys qualyte of werre: and broughte sakkes wyth theim to putte in the goodes of Rhodes: and tyed at their gyrdess ropes to bynde theire prysonners. For they hoped in their God Mahumete: that they wythoute fayle shulde
haue vyctorye of Rhodes. The daye afore that the grete assaut and bataylle was: they casted and shotte agaynes the wal∣les grete stones of .viii. the gretest bombardes that they had and casted downe the reparacyons and defences / whiche the Rhodyans hadde made in the broken walles: so that they stro¦ke and slewe the waches that were on the walles: in the night folowyng. for they sessed neuer thorowyng throe alle that daye and the nyghte and alle ther mornyng of the daye fo∣lowyng: in the whyche the grete assaute was made: soo that ther myght no body surely stande vpon the walles ner might stoppe the grete ruyne of the walles. for in a shorte space were casted thre honderd grete stones. After that the turkes hadde fynysshed their shotte of bombardes: the fyfte kalendre of the oneth of Auguste abowte .viii. the clokke in the mornyng they came to geder with grete multitude & nombre: and anone they passed ouer the dyche. whiche was then fulfylled with the ruyne of the broken walles of the cytee: and so anon they clymed lyghtely vpon the walles and more lyghtely / then the Rhodyans code in their syde wyth ladders and steyres Anone after that thees turkes wer vpon the walles they slew all the crysten men that there were in defence / & setted vppe there their standerdes and baneres: afore that the Rhodyans might clymbe vp with ladders to the walles. but anone the Rhodyans were there redy at their handes: and was gyuen of one parte & other a grete & horryble crye. for all the parte of Rhodes cryed on Ihesu cryste: & the turkes cryden Mahumete
And so the Rhodyans feghtyng manly & hertely resysted and withstode the grete preesse of the turkes. There was the wor∣shipful Lorde / the Lorde of Montelyon capeteyn of the men of werre of Rhodes: and brother to the lorde mayster. And ther were wyth hym many manly knyghtes of the ordre of Rho∣des: and many other men of the cytee: of the whyche in that assaute and baaylle▪ somme were slayne & many wonded. Ther were in that syde of the assaute four grete ladders in dy¦uers places for to goo vp & downe to the walles: of the whihe one was towaard the Iues strete. and by that ladder and place the turkes came down into the cytee. But anon the lord Mayster commanded: that yt shulde be kytte & pulde downe And he hym selfe in an other place by: wore vpon the wal∣les with hys companye: & there they faught agaynes the en∣nemyes of crystes faythe / as manly as euer dyd the remay¦nes for their empyre. And slewe many turkes: and fynally beted theym offe. But the Lorde mayster had fyue woundes Of the whiche one was Iuberte of hys lyfe: but throe the gra¦ce of God and helpe of leeckes & surgeons he was helped. And he for hys grete manhode & noble herte to God & to hys ordre / through all Rhodes was called the very father and de¦fensour of the cytee & of the fayth of Ihesu cryste. And what grete glorye and lawde he & hys companye with all the fegh¦tyng men of Rhodes that same daye deserued: the noble and manly acte shewed hyt. for vpon the broken walles of Rho¦des. and in the places that we haue sayde were .ii. thousand
and fyue honderd turkes in clene harnesse: and behynde theim folowyng by and by / as after was sayde and knowen: was the nombre of .xl. thousand turkes. They that had goten the walles fawght for to thruste down and caste offe the wal¦les the crysten feghtyng men: whiche manly resysted theire furye. & so the feghtyng endured by the space of two owres that hit was in dowte / who shulde haue the victory. for other whyles a man shulde haue demed that the Rhodyans shuld houe hadde the vyctorye. and anone the fortune chaunged so that no man sholde haue thought the contrary but that the tur¦kes sholde haue had the vyctorye of the Rhodyans and theire entente of the cytee. for fortune was so meruayllously insta¦ble. But after the space of two owres through the grace and tee of almyghty god and through the vertu & manhode of the worshypful & tryumphaunt the lorde mayster of Rhodes & of hys people the turkes were putted vtterly to the worse. They were smyten downe and beten out offe the walles with soo grete myghte and manly feghting of the Rhodyans why∣che so stedfastely came vpon theym: that the turkes with grete fere and hastynes tourned their bakkes & fledde in soo grete nombre that in fleyng one hurted and wounded the other. But one of the fayrest / and manlyest dedys / and worthy to be had in mynde: that the crysten people dyd in that as∣saute agaynest the turkes was: whenne a grete nombre of the turkes were vpon the walles in the warde wher the Iues had the kepyng: and there the sayde turkes stoutely feghted for
to thraw down of the walles the cryston feghtyng people for to haue entree to the cyte. But the crysten people with grete manhode & furour: threwe downe of the walles to the cytee thre honderd of theyme: and more / whiche were slayne: som with the horryble falles besyde the walles. for the hienes of the walles was of .xx. fote so that the Rhodyans clymmed vppe with ladders: and often myghte not for the shotte of the engynes of the turkes come vpon the walles: but by a certayn token of the ryngyng of a lytyl belle at the wache place of the walles / somme were brused and afterward slayne wyth the Rhodyans wepons: soo that all the strete called the Iue by the walles was full of their bloode and caren: and the∣der afterward came all the people of Rhodes to see & to won∣dre the myscheue of the turkes. Also after that the turkes soo myscheuously and shamefully were putte offe of their assaut and fledde to theire hoste: the Lorde Montelyon brother to the worshipfull Lorde Mayster pursued theyme into their tentes and loggyses: where they slewe many of theym & spolyed theyme of their Iuelles and harnesse of werre / & of theire ba¦ners & standardes: the whyche they brought with theyme to Rhodes / cryyng merely & making grete Ioye: & entered a∣gayne into Rhodes through the broken walles / for a perpetu∣all memorye. In that assaute for certayne were slayne thre thousand & fyue honderd turkes. For theire carens & bodyes were fonde and sene and nombred by the Rhodyans: of the whiche bodyes & carens som were fonde within the cytee / som
vpon the walles and many in the dyches / and by the see sy¦de. And be cause that all Rhodes stanke of their carens bothe within and withoute: they putted theym all on a hepe out of the towne: where they or deyned grete fyre: with the why∣che anone they were brente and consumed to asshes. But they that afterward yolde theym to the fayth of Ihesu cryste and forsoke their fals beleue because of certayn myracles that folo¦wen: sarde for trouth / that syth the turkes came to laye siege to Rhodes there were of theym slayne .ix. thousand: and .xv thousand sore wounded & greuously hurte. And thys they knewe in so moche / as the grete Basse of the turkes made af¦ter thys grete assaute comptes and rekenynges of al his men of werre. and soo the Basse with all hys oste was full of owe & confused. But alweye God almyghty for to de∣ere fynally Rhodes hys crysten cytee: and for to put the turkes in greter confusyon: shewed sodenly in thys assaute. hys loue and hys swete grace to hys crysten people. For by the comandement of the lorde Mayster: a baner of Ihesu criste Another of our Lady and another of seynt Ichan baptiste patrone of the ordre of Rhodes: were sette vppe on the walles whenne the bataylle was on bothe sydes moste sharpest. And anon after the turkes saw properly in the myddest of the clene and bryght eyer / a crosse all of shynyng gold: & also sawe a bryght vyrgyne: whiche had in her hande agaynes the oste of the turkes a spere and a shylde: and in that syght also api¦red a man clothed in pouer and vyle araye: whiche was
accompanyed wyth grete nombre of fayr and welbesene men in armes: as yf they wold haue comen downe to the helpe of Rhodes. By the crosse of golde we may Iustely vnderstande. oure saueour Ihesu cryste. And by the vyrgyne we may vn¦derstande / oure lady the blessed marie. And by the man po∣uerly clothed we may vnderstande the holy seynte Iohan bap¦tyste Patron and auowre of the ordre of Rhodes: whiche was acompanyed with seyntes & angeles of God for to helpe the Rhodyans. The whyche goddely and heuenly syghte putted playnly the turkes in soo grete wonder and fere: that in no maner after that vysyon: they were hardy to loke toward the cytee of Rhodes. But anone after they toke counseyl among theyme to leue their entente and tourne agayne to their coun¦treye / so that through the grace & myracles of almyghty god and through the prudence and dylygence of the lord mayster and fayth and manhode of the knyghtes of Rhodes: & obeys¦saunce of all the people: Rhodes was and ys preserued and kepte fro the turkes captyuyte. Thees myracles in so moche more are in confirmacyon and deuocyon to our crysten fayth be cause that the firste knowleche of theyme came by the vysy∣on and fyghte of the turkes ennemyes to oure crysten fayth. For afterward many of theyme forsoke theire fals beleue: and were crystened withinne the cytee of Rhodes: wher as they openly and constantely to alle the men of Rhodes / wyth one accorde and with a goode courayge made fayth and know¦leche of the goddely and heuenly vysyon whiche they had seen
And for certayn euery wyse man may knowe: that without Goddes hande so fewe crysten men might not haue resysted & withstanded so grete nombre of turkes: & in especyall when that they were vpon the walles. for then they thought to ha¦ue merely & with lytill peyne the victorye of the cytee of rho¦des. But who letted theym then to come down fro the wal¦les to the cytee: afore that the Rhodyans clymed with lad∣ders to feght with theim & dryue them fro the walles: Certain¦ly hit was none other but god. Who was he / that blynded their witte / so that anon after the firste assaute / they ordey∣ned not an other agaynes our crysten men: whiche by the first assaute had ben pyteously hurte & wonded & were all wery of fyghting. Hit was non other but god. Who was cause of the deth of so many of theym in the space of two owres in the grete & last assaute: but god & his angels that were seen in the bright eyer. Who was he shortly that putte from the vy∣ctorie of Rhodes so lytil a cyte in comparyson of others: as con¦stantinople & nygrepount & many moe strong & myghty: the Turke strong and ful of pryde. Well may euery man knowe that it was more goddes acte then mannys. Wherfor we alle crysten men mekely & with herty deuocyon / owe to yelde gra¦ces & louynges to almyghty God: whiche had preserued rho¦des the keye of all crystendom from the foule & vnrightful sub¦iectyon of the turkes: whiche hath ben for theire euyll purpes smyten and kytted in pies as bestes and fynally were put¦ted fro theire entente. But for to come to the conclusyon
of the departyng of the turkes. Anone after that they were putte to flyght: they wente bakward a large myle: and there they made newe tentes / to abyde there: whyle they char¦ged their shippes and galeyes with all their ordonnances of were. And in this whyle they charged in lytyll galeyes / daye by daye and oure by oure their men that were sore hurt and wounded with all their arraye: and brought theym a∣gayne to the contrey of Lycya: where they had resceyued them whenne they came toward the siege of Rhodes: and ther they abode tyll they were hole / and myghte tourne agayn to Tur¦kea their countreye. That same Lycya was to theim a grete commodyte and to all their entente. for from thens to Rho∣des was but a narowe see / called the see Lycyon. And not ferre from the banke of the sayd Lycya: was a grete & old towne called Physcum: where fyrst they abode the nauey that came from Constantinople: and nowe also were there wyth their woundes dylegentely refresshed. And sco anne after thys: yt was concladed among the turkes: that all the ofte shold departe from Rhodes. Therfor they made a grete wast and destryed all maner gardens and vynes & al other thin¦ges the whiche they supposed that might doo ease to the Rhody¦ans. Also they brende many houses & spolyed fyldes of their catelles: & charged their shippes with grete nombre of the be¦stes of the Isle of Rhodes / whiche myght not afore the siege be broughte into the cytee not into the holdes of the Isle. & in the mene whyle that the turkes made theym redy to retourne
to their countreye / were spyed & sene from Rhodes two grete shippes in the see saylyng from the weste toward Rhodes: & anone the Rhodyans hadde demyng that they were shippes of crystendome and of their frendes. And as they supposed / yt was. for they were send theder by the moste crysten kyng & moste deuoure Prynce Ferrand of aragonne kyng of naples to helpe and socour the Rhodyans agaynes the turkes. for the shippes were charged with the moste manlyest men of werre of his kyngdome and of all stuffe necessarye for theym. Thees two myghty and strong shippes entred frendly toward the porte of Rhodes aboute one the clokke after mydday in the be¦holdnge and syghte of the Rhodyans: whyche therfor made grete Ioye and myrthe: and yolded grete graces & louynges to almyghty God. But whenne they shold entre into the huen the turkes shotte grete soones of bombardes to theyme: soo that one of theyme was sore hurte in the maste. and the tother eschwed and escaped the shotte withoute hurte. and soo they casted theire anturs & abode the tyde that they might entre into the hauen: but toward the nyghte the see waxed so rough / that they durste no lenger abyde there at the an∣cure. Therfore the shippe that had not ben hurt toke the brode see. and thoder shippe be cause that her moste was in a grete daunger: doutyng to sayle: abode the tyde wyth all paryll and Iuberie. But throe the grace of god almyghty at that tyde entered surely into the hauen of Rhodes. the nexte daye folowyng the other shyppe whyche hadde taken the brode see
retorned agayn to entre into the port: but a myle & a half fro the porte the wynde fayled her & myght seyle no further: wher¦fore the turkes sende theder twenty galeyes of their naueye a∣rayed and armed for to fyght & ouercome the shypp & bring her to the turkes: but the crysten men of nayles and of Se∣cylle that were in the shypp bare theym: and quyted so man¦ly: that nether for the shotte of the galeyes nor for the might of soo many men that there were agaynest so fewe: they neuer made token of fere / but resysted so manly & vertuously / that in the space of thre owres that the bataylle dured they slewe four tymes greter nombre of turkes then they were theim self soo that they hadde the better hand and were vyctoryous. & in that fyghtyng was slayne the schief capeteyne of the sayde galeyes. and wyth thys harme & shame retourned the ga∣leyes to their partye: and the shippe of the crysten men the day folowyng with full sayle & standerdes of victorye & tryum∣phe entered into the port of Rhodes. Thyes two shippes broght to Rhodes mery tythynges. for they brought the  lettres whiche were red & declared openly be fore all theym of Rho∣des that wold gyue audyence therto. In the whiche lettres our holy father the pope comforted & desyred of the lord may¦ster & of all the crysten people that was within Rhodes. that for the loue of Ihesu cryste they wholde with all their herte & manhode withstande the furye of the turkes: & that in of hoste they shold haue socours from Italye bothe by see & by land in so grete nombre and strenght / that they shulde be lightely
delyuered of the trauayles and peynes: whiche othe daye & nyghte the turkes wyth all besynes ymagyned and wrought agaynes theim. for the hoste of the crysten people shuld come so myghty: that wyth the grate & helpe of God they shuld be able to gyue bataylle to al the puyssance of the turkes & hane the becer of hit. wherfore the Rhodyans alle wyth one voyce thanked God and magnefyed wyth grete praysynges our holy father the  Syte the fourth: the whyche tythynges wente anone to the ofte of the Turkes and fered theym fore wherfore they the soner departed from Rhodes: wher they had ben at the siege thre monethes saue a daye. & tourned agayn to the countrey of Lycya & arryued to the grete towne Phys∣cum: where they taryed and refresshed theym nerehand .xl. dayes: and aftreward tourned to their countrey / with their grete shame / their hurte & grete myschefe. Deo gracias.
