The Subuer∣siō of Moris false foundacion: where vpon he sweteth to set faste and shoue vnder his shameles shoris / to vnderproppe the popis chirche: Made by Geor∣ge Ioye. Rom. i.

AFtir that it had ple∣sed our most merci∣full father in heuē of his inestimable good¦nes to restore vs his gospel and to brynge agene his holy wor∣de into this realme of englōde by a fewe pore persecuted and banesshed men for the trwthe of goddis worde trāslatinge the scri¦pture and makinge certayn other englysshe bokis in the nether & over partyes of Ger∣manye: whiche bokis / inagry Mous tethe / all his papisticall Synagoge resistinge / yet were thei brought yn & distributed in this londe.

Then (I saye) in the day¦es of that gloriouse Cardinal Thomas wol¦saye begane these wyked pharisays to sub∣orne

thorow his name. Where in (I praye the) was Adam lyke cryste aftir Paulis cōparis∣on Ro. v.? verely in no nother thinge then lyke as Adam onely did brynge yn synne / deth / & hell: euen so did cryste a lone bryng vs grace / lyfe / & heuen. Paule thus setting forthe these similttudes saynge. That lykeRom. v as by the synne of onely one man / al mē be∣came mortall: euen so & miche more plentu ously by onely one man Iesus cryste / the fa∣uour of god & remission of synnes is graun ted vs. And lyke as by the synne of one alo∣ne / deth raigned thorow one man Adā: euē so & much more shal thei which receiue tha boūdāt fauou wt ye gft which is rightwy nes / raigne in lyfe by onely one mā which is Iesus Cryste. ¶ Agayne / lykewyse as by the synne of one man onely / condēnacion came ouer al men / euen so by the iustifynge of onely one man / that rightwysnes which bringeth lyse is br ought forthe vpon al men. For as by onely one mannis disobediēce / many became syn ners: euē so by yt obediēce of one mā onely many be made ryghtwyse. So the hitherto tendethe Paulis similitude. That as Adā was that one a lone by whom synne & deth entred into almen: cuē so was Cryste that
one alone by whom fauour / forgeuenes /  lyfe came vnto al men. For the wyne presse (saith cryste) I tell you haue I trodē al alo∣ne / & of al the peple was ther not one withIsayr. lxiij. me. It was I that trode downe my eny∣mes in my feruent wrathe. That is to say / It was I that ouercame syn deth & the de∣uel by my nown strength. This was he al alone that came frome Edom wt his blody clothes \ as one alone for all\ which had so labored & troden the wyne presse. Let vs therfore geue him al the glory & prayse alo∣ne / let vs not ascrybe any parte of our salua cion to our dedis / ofwhiche euē the best beIsayr. xlv. xlij to bad ether to satisfye for our synnes or to deue heuen. It is I / saith he / that am the rightwyse god & sauiour besydis whō there is no nother. He pourged our synnesin his owne persone or by himselfe alone. Hebr. i. Paule beginneth in the▪ vii. cap. to the E∣brews to proue the dethe of cryste to be one ly a sufficient perfait & full oblacion for our synnes. whiche once done neuer more it ne∣ded not to be iterated nor repeted: for by o∣nely that one oblacion of his bodye he bro∣ught to passe & fynesshed for euer his electe: And proue the that the priesthed of AaronHeb. x. with al theire ytis & sacrifyces for syn / we∣re

But had this arrogant pharisay vnderstode that breif co∣uenant / & gloriouse name of god wherby he reueled him selfe to Abram & his posterite in the. xvij. ca. of Genesis where he calleth him self God almighty one alone for al suf ficient / commanding vs to be pure & walke before him: that is to saye / to be faithfull & directe our lyuing according to his plesure & preceptis geuen to Moses: then wolde he neuer haue thus blasphemed his almygh∣ty & for al so sufficient holy name / nether haPsal. c. lij ue put sich lak in him & his writen wyll w∣hich he declared sufficiently to Moses & to the peple of Israel.

But we answere siche godlesse barkers a∣genst god / which ar become abominable & cruel enimes of his worde / disobedient and reprobated of god neuer to do good workis yt we preche and exhorte almen to as many good work{is} as euer be contayned in holy scripture. And yet tel we More agayn / yt good workis / thoughe thei iustifie vs not (for crystis bloude is sufficiēt for this poyn¦te / our faith reching the mercy of God for crystis sake) yet ought we not / payne of dā¦nacion to leue them vndone. Nomore than thoughe our leggis & handis serue vs not to se with all: yet ought we not therfore to kut them of & cast them awaye but to nores¦she & holde them in their propyr placis ād vse. we tell him to / yt we be iustified by faith onely / not for because we shulde not do no good workis: but because we shulde neuer
ceasse doing good workis. And we set faith in the first place betwene vs & god / & good workis betwene vs and our neighbours / to punesshe our rebell flesshe / to profit oo∣ther / & to be testimonies of our faith into y• lyght & ensample of all men. Unto thissame obieccion answerth Paule in the begining of the .vi. cap. Rom. shewing by those two interrogaciōs & theffecte of baptisme / that a Crysten man by faith hath his carnall af fectis so mortified & deed y• it is impossibile for him to lyue & dwell in synne / sayng / we that ardeed as towching synne / howe shal we lyue theryn? &c. where it is playne that sich a faithful crysten / thoughe he fal & syn ne / yet shal he not continue theryn: so that synne shal not raigne nor haue dominion ouer him. Rede forthe the chapiter. And we affirme with Paule. That Cryste byHeb. ix his blode pourged our consciences from de dely workis / to thentent we shulde serue the lyuing God & not ceasse from his serui ce.

If al this wil not yet satisfy Mo resvnsanery mouth: we wil go farther euē to Wytsonday wher ye holygost & yt promise was fully performed & y• verites lyk as here expressed: wherinto thei wer led▪ where as sone as thei were enspyred & set a fyer wt y•

For there did Peter wt y•. xi. as sone as ye spirite had led them into these trouthes \ stand vp in Ierusalem (for it was prophecyed and tol de them before yt there thei shulde begynne to preche these verites) and firste / y• false o∣pinion of the I beleuinge y• disciples to
haue ben droncken / taken awaye / he tolde them constantly / prechinge euen as Cryste had taught them before immediately after is resurreccion / whan thei were yet ful w∣ke.Art. i. Luke. xxiiij. That this same man whō thei had put to dethe was Iesus Cryste / se∣ite from god ye father: and geuen them to wyn them wt doctrine and myracles / whom by ye ferme decre and fore knowlege of ye fa∣ther so betrayd and delyuerde vp / when ye had receyued at ye handis of ye vngodlye / ye ucyfyed and slewe: whom god ye father lo∣sed fro y• bondis of dethe and stered vp age∣ne &c. Now (good Crysten reder) rede al ye processe and communicacion yt Cryste had wt these his disciples before he sand. yet ha∣ue I many thingis as touching these poyn∣tesLuke. xxiij. &c. Into which ye holy gost shal lede you when he come / and compare them vnto the verites y• Cryst opened them as sone as he was rysen / and proued it them by scriptu∣res and especially in ye Psalmes: And then loke here now in this sermone folowinge whose substance Luke reciteth / and consy∣der whither these be not y• same trouthes / ye and yt sufficient trouthes whome whoso receyue and beleue as ye ende and conclusiō of the sermone testifieth playnly / ar saued.
Loke and if al these trouthes be not plent ously and constantly confirmed wt the scrip tures? Thei here affirmed his ascension b scriptures / and also to sit on his fathers  ghthande / ye and euen here sayd thei in the firste hete of the spirit. That this promy∣se of cryste was made both to the Iwes / to their childerne / and to al that are a farre to by which wordis taken of the prophete I▪ say▪ Paule descrybed the gentyls. Thei pr∣echedEph. ij. now constantly that this same was that sead and frute of Dauid so ofte prom ysed in the lawe and prophetis / and that n∣ow he thus exalted by the righthande of the father / the promyse of the holy gost ob tayned of him / he hath powered forth euē this that you now se and here / Note these laste wordis wel / se and here. what sawe thei? what harde thei els but the verites in to whiche he promysed the spirit to lede th em / of whiche the firste is. That this man Iesus of Nazareth was geuen them of the father / this verite was wryten in the pro∣phetis / and Cryste tolde them to that he was come from the father / secondarily Pe∣ter and the. xi. preched them here that he wrought his wondres and miracles amon ge them by ye power of ye father / and that
the father wrought them by him. Thirde∣ly that by the decreed counsel and fore kno∣wlege of his father he was so betrayd dely uerd into their handis / crucifyed and kil∣led by the handis of the wyked. Fourthely god stered him vp agene losed from the so∣rowes of dethe sith it was impossible for hī to be holden any lenger of deth. These ve∣rites Peter proueth by the Psalmes as cry ste had before interpreted them to him and his felawes Luke the laste ca. ād here now the holy goste had perfitly led them into th em. So that now the Iwes were persuad∣ed him to be the very sonne of god the fath er / and both god and man. And wher Mo re saithe in his dialoge and also in this his lase new boke the. ccxl. syde. That Peter did forbere in this sermone to call Cryste God / leste it shulde haue hyndred the faith in that audience. Euery man may here se howe ignorant he is in scriptures / and wh∣at an herysye he wolde pycke out of so play ne a place where Peter his principal purpo se was to proue Cryste that very Messias / god and man / euen ye sone of god. Fo we∣re there not aboute. iij. thousand conuert∣ed to the faith at that sermone? and of wh∣at faithe wolde More there make them if
thei beleued not that cryste was god? If Pe ter dirste not preche it / but left this princi∣pal article oute / how then beleued thei it? In dede More gothe aboute to make him no god \ and that can I proue him playnlye if he wil stand to his wrytinge. But crystē reder thou shalt know that Peters purpo se with al the. i. was principally to proue him bothe god and man / contrary to Mo∣ris heresy / Peter alleged the Psalmes sayn ge. Non davis sanctum tuum &c. That is / thou shalt not suffer thy holyone to be cor∣rupted in the erthe. For whan thei harde this worde holyone / thei beleued that he was god: for it was the name appropryed vnto god in the lawe and prophetis / & thei were wel acquaynted with that name: the prophetis and lawe callinge god euermore the holy one of Israel / that is he that ma∣keth holy Israel / which thei knowleged to be their god onely / vnto which name Ga∣briel loked answeringe our ladye / saynge. That holy one which is borne of the shal∣be called the sonne of god. Luc. i. And Pe∣ter here called him the lorde / whiche na∣me the Iwes take for god onely. And alle∣ged also the same psalme wherby cryst him self▪ confounded the pharisayes. Mat. xxij
preuinge him self to be very god. Here may ye se what a busynes it is to haue to do wt these heritikes that denye cryste to be god and so belye Peter saynge that he forebore to cal him god / because he saith i wolde haue hindred the faith / in that audience. What audience / I praye ye were thei? wer thei notsiche as god had chosen? were thei not his shepe that shulde heare his voyce? shulde the cheife article then of their faith that cryste is god / offende his flocke? He cal led him first of al man: saynge this man Ie∣sus &c. what than? ergo he forbore to cal h∣im god? Peter firste declared him to haue dyed which his godhed suffred not but his manhed onely. and this declared / he prou∣ed him to be god also. But More doth as he is wonte / snatche and tere oute a wode of the hole texte and so runne awaye with it to proue his deuilleshe purpose / to blynd the peple / nether consyderinge what folo∣weth nor what goth before / no yet wil he suffer any lay man to se his falsehed no ot∣her mennis answers. The fyfte verite th∣at they preched / was that this same holy one Cryste both God and man was ye se∣de of Dauid so oft promysed in the lawe ād prophetis. And here thei remoued a waye
by scriptures that opinion of the Iwes wh erby thei wrested the scriptures to be vnde rstanden of the Propher Dauid / and decla ringe his exaltacion by the righthande of god into a nother maner of kingdome thā euer Dauid or Salomon had (as the Iwes yet dreame and wait for) brought in at laste this other truthe: that he had obtayned th em of his father by his dethe the promyse of the holygost now fulfille de whom (sayd Peter) he hath powed forthe vpon vs eu∣en this thing that ye now / both se and he∣are / to here is a taste of those trwthes into whiche the holygost led them / farre vnly∣ke Mores vnwryten dremes / And here is cryste proued also to be very god in that / he saith the holygoste procedethe of him. But let vs hear out al Peters sermō how he conclude the saynge. Wherfor al the ho∣wse of Israel mought knowe for a sute y• god hath made this same Iesus whome ye haue crucifyed lorde and anoynted / that is to saye the anoynted lorde and kynge ouer al / both Iwes and gentyls. And here may ye se how this sermone tended into Cryste as very god in whom al trouthes were cō∣tayned necessary for theirs and our saluaci on. Now conferre this ledinge into al these
trouthes vnto the promyse where he sayde the spirit shal testifye of me &c. of me sayde he and not of my mother nether yet of lent faste / halowinge of vestementis &c. and cre pinge to the crosse. That is to saye / ye ledde into the knowlege of me by the spirit / hal testifye and preche me / as now maye euery man se in the performinge of crystis promy se. Than afterwarde the sermone done / ye hartis of the Iwes were picked in thē sel∣ues and thei sayd to Peter and to his fela∣wes. what shal me do ye men our brether∣ne? Repent ye (sayd Peter) and be baptized &c. which is euen the same that cryste tau∣ght them before to preche / the firste frutis of the holygoste tasted / Luke the laste. Lo here are al truthes necessary to be beleued and repentance preched in one sermone / al confirmed with the scriptures / this gospel thei preched al with one mouthe: and did wryte it agene & agayn & declare it in euery pistle and sermone vnto both Iwes & gen∣tils / for as thei al professed one lorde / one faith / one baptysme / so preched thei al one gospel wryten before in the lawe prophetis and psalmes. Rede al the sermons ofthapo stles thorow the Actes and especially saynt Steuens sermon in the. vij. and Paulis in
ye. xiij. ca. and y• shalt se how thei preched n∣othing wt out ye autorite alleged of ye scrip∣tures. For it was prophecyed in y• Psalmes yt y• Iwes owne table yt is to saye their owne scriptures shulde be their owne trappe ād confusion: of y• whiche table sayd Dauid inPs. xxij y• persone of vs. The lorde fedeth▪ me / wher fore I canne want nothing. Euen here lo / is ye sufficiency and perfitfulnes of y• script∣ure proued agenste More / for Dauid here compareth y• scripture to a plentuouse suffi cient paslure vnto ye which Paule loked. i. Cor. iij. whan he sayd. I nouresshed you vp wt mylke as yonge infantes in cryste / & not wt faste mete / for ye might not yet beare it. Thou haste sprede me a table sayde Dauid in y• presence of my aduersaryes meaninge ye scripture where standeth forth meate for a maner mēnis mouthes / no nother wyse tan yt Manna in wyldernes fallen fō heuēEx. xxi satisfyed euery man sufficiently and sauour∣ed what so euer he wolde eate. Cryste him self recyted ye scriptures for ye confyrmacyon of his sermons. He expowned them / and wolde not haue ye Iwes to beleue him with out their testimony / Paule almoste wryte∣th nothinge but ye scriptures and expown∣erh them. And shal we beleue More wt his
bysshops at their bare wordis? If thei wol de chalenge and adscrybe to their selfe this pryuilege and honour aboue cryste and his apostles / so declare thei them selfe to be yt same sonne of perdicion yt sitteth in y• tem∣ple of God lokynge for an honour euen to be borne vp wt sich a worshype / as cryst him selfe neuer loked fore. Sed spirituoris sui interficiet eum dominus. But ye lorde shall slaye him with the breath of his mowthe.

for their conuersion and saluacion / he af firmethe. 1. Corint ij. saynge. Bretherne. whan I came vnto yow / I came not withe hyghe eloquence of speche reasoninge my matter with mannis wysedome when I p∣reched yow the testimony of God (mare wel this / the testimony of God. whiche is the scripture that testifye and preche god) For I professed myselfe than beinge wt you nothing els to knowe but Isus Cryste & that he was crucified. And agayne / thus wyteth he. Brotherne I put you in myni. cor. xv de of my gospel that I preched yow which ye receyued / in whiche ye stande / by which ye are saued &c. where it is payne by y• wo rdis folowing / that his gospell is the very same that Cryst taught s disciples at h∣is departinge and agne aftir his resurrecci on / euen the very same into whiche as into al trouthe the holy goste led them. For as th were al enstrte and led of one spi rit / so agred the al vpon one Gospel one trouthe euen cryste the very fountayne of al trouthe to b preched for the saluacion both of the Ies and gētyls. And this go∣spel (saith Paule in the samecha.) was wr∣yni. cor. rv om. i longe  fore in the scriptures / and pr omysed in the scripturis by the prophetis
Also Paule consyderinge that it was no le sse labour to defende his flocke / then to be∣get them (sith so many false prophetis cre∣ptyn after him to seduce them) he did wry te them his Pistles / not to teche them any other faithe then thei had firste receyued by his prechinge: but to confirme them in the same and to defende them from the fal se prophtis doctryne / saynge I wryte the∣se thinges vnto you to moneshe you as my dere childerne: for haue ye neuer so manyei. cor. iiij techers / yet haue ye not many fathers: for it was I that begote yow in Cryste by the gospel. And as for the matters that Paul sayd he wolde dispose and odir at his com∣inge: If ye begyn and rede the Pistle till ye come to this place / ye shal se what conten sion and disorder / what was oute of frame amonge them / and howe there Paule wro te vnto them these thinges to be redress∣ed by expresse scripture orels by the rules lefte in scripture / that is to wyt by faith ād loue / and at laste he cominge vnto a grete disorder and fawe / in eatinge the lordis sowper / whiche whan he had rebuked / and shewed them the very vse therof to be eaten yn the memoryall / and remembe∣raunce of hys dethe / he addid therto\
in y• later ende of ye cap. as for other thing∣es (concerning this sowper saith Ierome) I shal set in ordyr whan I come. Nowe to set in ordyr is not here to preche them ne∣cessary trwthes for their saluacion as Mo re fayuethe: For these had he preched and wryten them longe and ofte before all that yere and an halfe / prechinge with them h∣is Gospel / of whiche he wryteth in y•. xv. cap. thus which Gospel ye receyued / and yet abyde still in it / by whiche ye haue your saluacion. where it is play / yt this Gospel wryten was suffcient for their saluacion / ād it is not trewe yt euery necessary truthe for our saluacion shulde not be conteyned in y• scripture. And muche more ought More to be ashamed / if he were not paste shame so falsely to allege and to wreste this scriptu∣re for his porpose. For after this / Paule wrote them his seconde Pistle / where yn y• firste cap. he excuseth himselfe wt many w∣ordis y• he coud not come to them as he p∣romysed in y• first Pistle wherfore / as forsi∣che thingis which he partely promysed to set in ordyr / he hee writeth them / as y• re∣concylyng of y• Corinthean y• hd maryed his stepmother / whom e i y•. v. a. of his first Pistle commanded to be taken oute
of y• congregacion / wt many other thingis / as euery diligent reder of y•. ij. Pistle maye clerely perceyue. But here by  aye of cō municacion I wolde aske M. More whan Paule came agene to y• Corinthes to prec∣he them these other necessary trouthes / cō tayned in this worde. Cetera &c. For I w∣il denye yt euer Paule came there aftyr by y• waye of communicacion. And if he came not there / then preched he not them. And because he coude not come accordinge vn∣to his promyse he wrote them this seconde Pistle to counforte to confirme and to def∣ende them / agnste those false prechers / y• went aboute to seduce them and to destro∣ye y• he had yded / where yn as euery red∣er maye se he disposed and ordered perfitly by his wrytinge althinges yt were amysse among them. If so necessary trouthes we∣re contayned in this texte. Cetera cum ve∣nero &c. as More faynethe / thinke ye yt so louinge an herde man so tenderinge his fl∣ocke wolde haue lefte them oute? Namely when he writethe agene so longe a Pistle wheryn he occupieth his penne sometyme in thinges whiche he sayd himself it neded not gretely to haue wryten them / and occu piethe some parte therof wt greting is from
other men / wolde he (thinke ye) haue put yn these not necessary for there saluation & lefte oute thingis so necessary for it? Also rede the. xvi. chap. of the firste pistle / and thou shalt se hun self partely expresse tho∣se other certayn thingis whiche he wolde ordyr at his cominge \ where he remembr∣eth a collecte to be disoosed amonge the p re sayntis and faithful. where he saith pla∣ynly. That as for now / thoughe I come by you yet wil I not se you. Sith Paule then so fathful an ouerser cared so miche for their saluacion / knowing that they yet wā ted trouthes necessary for it / came so nighe and turned not yn / seynge that thi shulde be damned if they beleued not these trow∣thes / who wolde thinke that he had yet certayn necessary truthes contayned in th∣ese wordis. Cetera &c. but wolde haue co∣me yn and preched them? Thinke ye that sith he coude not come himself but sent th em this Pistle that he wolde haue lefte ou te these necessary trowthes? Misconstre not therfore Paule nor holy scripture / and specially this texte / As for other thingis I shal dispose &c. which he spake of twarde sages rytes and comely ordyr in the chir∣che and congregacion of god that it shulde
be so wel and comely disposed and ordered that nether their enymes nor the Iwes co ude fynde any faute at their religion. he thirde texte whiche he wreste∣thMoris thirde shore and wryeth for his vngraiouse heresy / is in the laste lyne and laste chap. of Iohan Saynge.  her a also yet many other thi∣nges whiche Iesus did / which if euery one were wryten / I thinke the world coude not cōtayne the bokis. Here More noumberth his vnwryten verites amonge these so ma ny other thingis which cryst did / orels th∣is texte coulde make nothinge for him. but thou knowest wel that Moris vnwryten verites. that our lady was assumpte body and soule praynge to postis stos and say tes / halowinge of vestmentis chalices bo kis blls bowes and crepinge to the crosse these did Cryste neuer / excepte More had some reuclacion / withe his holy mayde of kent / by saynte Iohan tellinge them that these were the thinges that Cryste did ād be not wryten. But had More turned ba∣ke ouer the lefe / in to the laste ende of the Chapiter before / he shulde haue sene Iohan to haue declared hymselfe / saynge. Many other miracles did Cryste in the si∣ght of his Disciples whiche ar not wryten
in this boke / but these are wryten as sufficent for your beleife / yt Iesus Cryste is y• so∣ne of god and yt y• beleuers of this / mighte haue lyfe euerlastinge by his name. Here mayste y• se y• saynt Ioan was better lerned then More and knew what myracles and what doctryne was necessary for our salua∣cion / and omitted nothinge of ether of the in his Gospel: but wrote vs a sufficient ād perfit Gospel for our saluacion and did k∣nytp y• some of our saluacion in these fewe wordis as he doth often tyme before especi ally in y•. iij. cap. v. &. vi. &c. saynge / he yt bel∣eueth in me hath lyfe euerlastinge. And if More wolde saye yt he left vs oute any ne∣cessary trouth / so wolde he make sant Io∣hans Gospel an vnperfit and insufficient Gospel: but More belyke mistrusteth his parte and defendeth it wt a naughty consciē ce. For in this texte where Ioan saith. Sūt autem & aa multa que fecit Iesus. he wol de make fecit to signifye docuit or predica∣uit / as thoughe syt Ioan knew not y• dif ference betwene facere and docere /  is / bet wene doynge of miracles / and preching his gospel as wel as More: and coude not spe∣ke and wryte his propi termes for eche better than More can tel him. And Saynt
uke consyderinge ye difference betwene fa ere and docere / and y• y• hole story of crystis yfe stode vpon these t / yt is to wyt in do nge miracles and teching his doctrine: be∣gane y• Actes of y• Apostles thus. In my fir te treatis (deare frende theophilus) I ha∣ue wryten of al yt Iesus begane both to do and teche. Here / besydis y• ke expresseth y• difference betwene crystis dedis and his doctrine / he saithe he hath wryten of all t∣hinges yt he begane both to do and teche &c If he wrote of al (meaninge all thinges ne∣cessary for our saluacion / for I thinke uke wolde not wryte no vayne thingis) why sa ith More / Euery necessary thinge for our soule helthe is not wryten? and thus of his owne false supposiciō wolde thruste yn his nwryten verites or rather stare lyes. Thus maiste y• se clerely (crysten reder) wt what conscience this man wryteth and de∣fendethe his parte / and howe falsely he pe∣ruerteth goddis holy worde to proue his heresyes. Here he wil haue ye doynge and y• workinge of cryste in doynge his miracles as bothe Ioan and Luke declare it / and y• worde slfe signifieth / to signifye crystes te∣chinge and preching of his gospel. And w∣here Paule sayd playnely he wolde set in
order other thinges whan he came / he wr∣esteth the worde contrary vnto al the hole processe and effecte of both Paulis Pistles to signifie to preche & to teche thinges th∣at he neuer wrote. And where Cryste sa∣yd the holygoste shulde ede them into all truthes concerninge siche trouthes as we∣re contayned in the scriptures of himselfe / beynge that fountayne of al trouthe / wh∣iche trouthes were then so harde that th∣eir weaknes might not ere them as was the callynge yn of the Gentyles / whiche whan Cryste was rysen he taught them / and the holygost comen also taughte them the same / and euen straigth they preched them: yet wolde More contray to al th∣ese manyfeste scriptures and euident prof∣es / make them his vnwryten verites / as halowinge of bowes salte &c. and crepinge to the crosse / and that is yet more to be de∣tested and aborred / he wolde haue these popisshe ceremones / necessary towthes to be beleued for our saluacion.

But let vs examyn your highe lerninge o rather refute your false peruertinge of wo∣ther Paulis holy saynges. ¶ Paule proueth constantly and manifij. tim. iij estly. That the scripture is myghty ynough and sufficient to nstruete and bringe vs vn to that saluacion whiche cometh thorowe faith in Iesu cryste / wryting on this maner vnto imothe saynge. But thou / se that thou abydest faste in these thingis whiche thou hast lerned and ar cōmitted vnto the knowinge and beinge suer of whome thou art lerned / and that euen of a chylde thou hast knowne the holy scriptures which are myghty ynoughe to enstructe the vnto th∣at saluacion which cometh thorowe faithe in Cryste Iesu. For al the scripture enspy∣red by god is profitable to teche / to conuin ce / to correcke and to enstructe a man in r∣ghtwisnes (that is / to enstructe him / whe by / and how he shalbe iustified before god / so that the man of god might be perfait ād redye to do al good workis. But lorde ho∣we More addeth to / howe he mynseth mi∣nessheth mangleth and potteth oute this texte with his false gloses to wreste it vnto his perniciouse purpose. whose falsehed th ou maist se in the. ccc. iiij. face of his confu∣tacion
in the. iij. boke. where he thus writ∣eth. Moreouer it is to be consydered / that Paule saith not to Timothe. Abde yn th ose thingis that I haue wryten but in tho∣se thingis that thou hast lerned. As thou∣ghe what so euer Timothe had lerned for his owne and other mennis saluacion cou∣de not haue ben wryten to: and as though what Paul had lernerd him / it had ben no where wryten: and so to haue taught Ti∣mothe certayn doctrine to preche / of whi∣che nether Paule nor Timothe had not to geue their hearers a rekeninge oute of the scripture. Is this a good Argument / M. More / Thou hast lerned it / ergo it is not wryten? And then dothe More patche to Paule / his own glose saynge. Abyde in th¦ose thinges that thou haste lerned / ether in scripture orels otherwyse of me with oute scripture as he wrote to the Thessalonyes Obserue ye my preceptis &c. Now loke cry¦sten reder whether Paule wrote these wor dis to Timo. ether in scripture orels other wyse &c. as More falsely sewethe them to: but that rather it foloweth into Moris cō fusion / That Timothe euē of a chylde had known the holy scriptures whiche are my∣ghty ynoughe saith Paule and able to en∣structe
him vnto that saluacion whiche co∣meth thorowe faith in Cryste / but this te∣xte More glaunceth ouer here / to bringe in another for his wyked purpose whiche I shal a none confute. But Paule telleth Timothe that he had ben brought vp in y•i. ti. iiij. wordis of faith and good doctrine whiche he had continually folowed / which were y• lame and prophetis as here it apperethe / and not Moris vnwryten dremes whiche Timothe neuer knew / nor Paule neuer leryd. ¶ Then sayth he in the. ccc. v. face. Th∣at saynt Paule tolde Timothe to / that the scripture was good and profitable to teche the faithfull folke and to reproue heretyk∣es / if he ioyned therwith alwaye the faith of cryste / with oute which it wolde do him no seruice for al that he had ben lerned th∣eryn frome his chyldhed. Nowe Crysten reder loke whither More hath trwly recy ted Paule / loke what he hath putto of his owne / and what he hath taken from him. Loke and these be not rather Paulis wor∣dis folowinge. For al the scripture wryten by thinspiracion of god / is profitable to e∣che to conuince to correcte and to enstructe
in rightwysnes that the man of god mig∣hte be redye to al good workis. Nowe com pare this text with Moris allegacion / and consyder wel wherfore he leueth out a gr∣ete parte of Paulis wordis to thrust yn his owne. More leuethe oute that it was wr∣yten by the inspiracion of God \ and putte∣the yn to that place / to reproue heretykes if he ioyned therwith alwaye the faith of Cryste / meninge by the faith of Cryste (as his owne wordis there declare) his owne vnwryten articles contayned in the Popis Crecd. And for that at Paule saithe. It is profitable to correcte and conuince and to enstructe in rightwysnes that the man of God mighte be perfit and redye vnto eue ry good worke. More clouteth it vp withe this patche. Withe oute the whiche it wo lde do him no seruice for al that he had ben lerned theryn frome his childhed. Is not this a faitheful handler of holyscripture? But M. More / If al the scripture be ens∣pyred of the holy goste / so be we suer that it is trwe / and maye vse it as an infallible rule to mesure to conuince and correcke yo∣wr vnwryten verytes there withe. If all the scripture be good and profitable to teche / why wyll ye not let men rede it?
why wyl ye then presume to tche men yo∣ur vn wryten lyes? If it be profitable to tec∣he to coce to rbuke & correcke / why saye you that it is the cause of sdicion / he∣resy / and carnal lybertye? If it be profitable to ustructe vs how we shalbe iustifyed and to make vs perfit and redy to all goodnes: what nede we then your vnwryten vanit∣es with your vayne tradicions and articles of the popis Creed? whiche the scripture as it knowth thez not / so is it playne agen ste them. The prophete calleth the wordePsalm. c.   n. Pe. i. of god / the lanterne to his fete and lyght to trede in his pathes. vnto whiche light Pe ter biddeth vs to attende as vnto a lanter∣ne holder vp before ve walkinge in any der ke place / vntil the daye be waxen more cle∣are / the day starre arysinge and sprongenf∣orth in our hertes / vnto the which lyght / I saye poynteth vs saynge. If any man waIsa. viij nt lyght / let him get him to the lawe and sciptures testifynge Cryste: and go not / in thingis concerninge lyfe / vnto dede spritis fayinge them selues to come frome hell or purgatory / as did More of late playnge y• proctour of purgatory faynyng to haue co∣me fro thence with his boke of the supply∣cacion of soulis oute of so hotte clensinge
fyer / and yet was there not one lefe shorch∣ed therof. Aftir alyke fasshion More woldFace ccc. iiij ij. Ti. i. frame a nother texte of Paul / sayng y• Paul writeth vnto Timothe before in the same Pistle. Haue thou the forme and fasshion of the holsome wordie whiche thou haste haide of mein faith and loue in Cryste Ie∣su. He saith not the wordis (saith More) that I haue wryten to the and that thow haste redde of myne / but the wordis that thou hast harde of me. o Crysten reder / this is Mores Argument / Paule saith not the wordis that I haue wryten & that thou haste redde of myne but the wordis y• thow haste harde of me / ergo it muste nedis folo∣we that thei were not wryten. But I aske More whither Paule did not wryte a Pi∣stle to Timothe before he wrote him these wordis contayned in his seconde pistle? ād then / whither that a man here not frome his frende whiche receyueth letters from him▪ as now had Timothe receyued a pist∣le before contayninge the hole some of all holse me doctryne? And whether this be then a good argument / Thou haste harde worde from me / ergo I wrote not vnto ye? More argueth (I tell you) very subtyly / as thoughe what so euer were harde coude
not be wryten to. Lyke arguments he ma∣keth in other places / saynge. God promy∣sedlxxvij syde his lawe to be wryten in mennis hartis ergo it is not / nor was not then wryten in bokis. whiche promyse is in Ieremye. xxxi longe aftir the lawe was wryten by Mos∣es. Dauid sayd / thy lawe is wryten in myPsal. xl herte / ergo aftir More / it was not then wr yten in Moses bokis. And agen God pro∣mysed not that theuangelistis ād apostles shulde wryte the new Testament / ergo th∣ei did not wryte it. And Cryst bad his apo stles go preche the gospel and not go wryte it / ergo thei did not wryte it. whiche argu mentis howe false and fonde thei be euen M. Henry his owne fool can tel him. Pauli. i. iiij. bad Timothe attende vnto redinge / exho∣rtinge / and techinge tyl he come. He sayd not / attende vnto my vnwryten word is w∣hiche I taught the by mouthe no where wryten: but attende vnto redinge of holy scriptures / euen those wordis of faithe and good doctryne whiche thou hast hitherto diligently folowed / beynge brought vp in them. And what wordis were these? not Moris vnwryten dremes ye maye be suer. But thei were those holy letters / in whi∣che Paule exhorted him constantly to aby∣de:
whiche he had ben taught / and were co mmitted vnto him / and had knowne themij. tim.  euen frome his chyldhed &c. as ye see. ij. Timothe. iij. Wherfore Crysten reder begyn thow and rede the firste Pistle that Paule wrote vnto Timothe / and there thou shalt se fir ste of al prescribed him this holsome doctri ne in faithe and loue: where he biddethe him preche and tell certayn men that thei folowe no nother doctrine then that edifi∣ethei. tim. i. godely thorowe faithe. for the ende of the precept and plesure of God / is loue oute of a pure herte and good conscience / and faithe vnfayned. And aftyr a lytell di∣gression / he saithe. That the fauour of our lorde hath aboundantly excedid withe fa∣ith and loue whiche is thorowe Iesu Cry∣ste. And then to put timothe oute of dou∣te of these holsome wordis and Gospell of the faithe and loue in Iesu Cryste: he wy∣neth to sayinge. This is the moste assuered and trwest Doctryne / Worde or Gospel / and none more worthy to be embrased and kyssed then that Iesus Cryste is comen in∣to the Worlde to saue synners. And agay∣ne in the. iij. Chapit. to setoute these hol∣some wordis and that Godly Gospell /
how necessary it is to be preched in the con gregacion / howe frme / how suere a trou∣th sy it is / he sayd. These thinges do I wryte vnto the (here maye ye se whether that do ctrine in faith and loue that Timothe har∣de of paule was not wryten to) These thin gis do I wryte vnto the: trustinge to come shortly vnto the / but if it be longe / yet do I wryte the these thingis / that thou mayst know how to behaue thy slfe in the con∣gregaion of the lyuinge god. where yet to certifie Timothe more ernestely of the fr∣me and assuered trouth of this holsome do ctryne / he calleth it the very pyller ād foun dtion of the trouthe / whiche ferme assue∣raunce e setteth by this holsome doctrine almoste in euery place that he remembreth it / it ye diligently marke it in redinge his pi stles to these two ouerseers and curats Ti mothe and Ttus. aftir this he calleth th∣isBy th∣is name he calle▪th it. holsome doctryne or Gospell / that same grete secrete and dep mystery of crystis re ligion without controursy noman to dou te at it / Euen this gospel that here folow∣eth / GodEph. iii 1. cor. iiij is declared manifestly by taking vpon him our nature / approued by the te∣stimony of the spirit / sene and isited of an∣gllis / preched vnto the gentyles / beleued
in the worlde / recyued gloryously into he∣uen. This gospel and ferme pyller of the tr outhe ye se in how fewe wordis Paule n∣itteth it vp to poynt his Timothe vnto yt holsome doctryne whiche he wolde haue him to be occupyed in / prechinge tyll he ca∣me. Where in this Pistle and in all other ye maye se playnely that Paule and his fe∣lows / were in wrytinge and prechinge ern estly occupyed aboute thingis of more cert∣aynte / verite / more nyere and necessary for the glory of god and our saluacion then be Moris vnwryten verites and balde cerem ones. But let vs yet set Paule him selfe a brason wall agenst all Moris blasphemon selyes made vpon him / to ouer throwe his pestelent buyldinge / thus affirminge vntoac. xxvi kynge Agrippa / saynge. Vnto this day am I preserued a lyue by goddis helpe / to pre∣che both to small and grete / no nher thin ge sayinge / then those thingis whiche the propetis and Moses had sayd before to co me / &c. Here is it manifeste whither Paule was so bolde as to teche any thinge withe out the scriptures. ¶ Nowe sithe the Gospell of Cryste is that holsome and frme doctrine of faitheRom. i. and loue / so ofte promysed by the prophetis
in holy scripture so plentuously wryten of the fower euangelystis / so manifestly setfo∣rthe in euery Pistle of the new testament: Is not this Godles man an enymye vnto Cryste that wolde go abonte ether to pro∣ue it vnwryten to thrust yn his vnwryten verites in the place of it / orels to proue Cry stis gospel and testament vnperfit and insuf ficient for our saluacion? contrary to Cry∣stis answer to the question of the man senemat. xix in the lawe of Moses / whiche asked hymuc. x. what shal I do to haue lyfe euerlastinge? whom Cryste sent vnto the lawe of the co∣mmaundementis saynge: Do this and th∣ou shalt lyue. And Iohan saith who so be∣leue in Cryste / hathe lyfe euerlastinge. Is not this the chylde of perdicion that thus peterteth the trwth wryten by the spirit of trouthe? But he thought whan he wro te these blasphemyes that y• laye pele shu ld rede onely his bokis neuer to se what sh ulde be answerde: for that the answers we∣re so strayghtely forboden to be brought in to the lode / and therfore he lyed as him lysted and wrote what he wolde. Thus also he peruerteth Austens sayn ge to proue the Sacramentis to gyue gre∣ce in the. lij. syde of the lef of his answer to
Tindales preface / sayng. That by the holy wordis of baptysme comynge vnto the wa ter / God clenseth the soule / accordinge vn to the wordis of Saynt Austen / Accedit verbum ad elementum / & fit Sacramen∣tum /  whiche wordis he engleshethe not / but I shall englesshe them for him / the wo∣rde comethe vnto the Element / and the sa∣crament is made. Lo here is not one wor∣de to proue that Baptisme clenseth the so∣wle. Lyke maner wresteth he al other scrip tures for this his heresy / for his popishe pr∣eisthed / vowes and fastis &c. whiche all / the scripture knoweth not. For there is none to proue vs siche a shauen anoynted order / nether their vowed wyuelesse chastite. nor yet that al men indifferently muste faste si∣che prescrypt dayes lymited vnto the cho∣yse of meatis / to forbere one kynde of meate / and to eate his bely full of a no∣ther that please him beter. But to proue these Doctrynes of the Deuyl (as Paule callethe them. i. Tim. iiiij.) More farethei. tim. iiij lyke an hasty frantyke droncken man: wh∣ich in hys furye fallen out with his felowe at the table wyll caste at his felawes he∣d what thynge so euer come nexte hys

For firste he saithe that Cryste made virginite a cownsel / and that it is a perfecci on aboue the olde lawe \ taught onely and counseled in the gospel. And when he co∣me to proue it / he allegeth the olde lawe /  the. ix. syde of y• leif in his ans∣wer to tyndals preface. saynge. Douete & reddite / that is to saye vo we ye / and paye your vowes to your lorde. A lye can neuer be so well cowced / but it wyl apere. A lyer therfore it behouethe to haue a good memory. For howe can these frame togither? virginite is cownseled / ād yet this texte here commandeth it / saynge vonete / vowe ye. It is a perfeccion (saith he) aboue the olde law cownseld onely in ye gospel / and yet wolde he confirme it withe a texte of the olde testament to be vowed in the olde lawe: where it was nether coun selled nor commaunded. But let vs restorePsalm. lxxv the texte to his trwthe. Thus is it wryten Nowe ye / and paye your vowes vnto your lorde God al that be here in this present congregacion. This did Asaph commande spekinge vnto al the peple of Iuda gatherd
togither in the temple to geue thankis for some victory geuen them of god. whiche verse if it were vnderstanden as More so wysely allegeth it for his vowe of virgini∣te and his wyueles vowed chastite for prei stis monkis and nonnis &c. then were al ye Iwes their present maryed & vnmaryed / cō manded after More to be virgyns / fryers priestis monkis & nonnis &c. But had this grete clerke taken with him the later ende of the verse saynge / Adferte formidali mu nera / that is / brynge forth your oblacions or gyftes and offer them vp vnto the drede ful lorde: then shulde he haue sene what this worde votum signifiethe euery where almost in the olde tstament: he shulde haue sene / as it is comenly in al the prophetis / the later ende of the verse expowne the be ginninge / as for an exemple / in the. ij. psal.Dotum He that sitteth in heuen shal mocke them it is the lorde that scorneth them and Mo re to. This Hebrew worde Nedar / whiche is translated into votum / signifieth an obl∣acion or gyfte / as lombe / kidde / shepe &c. promysed and willingly offred to god: as it was prescrybed them in Numeri and Leui tico / and not the vowe of virginite. Asmy∣che maketh his tother texte alleged Eccle

If thow haste vowed any thinge to god / tary not but paye it. which wordis when Salomon sayde them / there was no siche vowes (as More wolde pro∣ue by them) presupposed nor thought / but sich onely as the olde lawe prescribed thez. Had the then made any vowe of virginite with out ether precept or ensample \ they had made it of their owne head / and so had it bene vnlawful vnfaithful / and a folysshe vowe / as be Moris popisshe vowes / of w∣hich thus there speketh Salomon / sayngeecclēs. v An vnfaithful and a folesshe vowe dispies∣eth god / and miche better were it neuer to haue had vowed / then aftir thy promyse neuer to perform it. So serueth thatorte of I saye this gret clerkis purpose / alleginIsa. xix ge him thus. Thei shal know the lorde & worship him with oblacions & giftis / & vo∣we their vowes to ye lorde & paye thez. He∣relo / is no mencion of Moris chaste wycl∣es virginal vowe / but onely as the circunst∣ance of the texte declareth it / yt ye lorde shul de sendethe egipcians a sauiour / whō thei shulde acknowlege / & so testifye their kn∣wlege wt giftes & offrances promysed & pa∣yed &c. Lyke wyse peruertethe he the texteIone. ij of Ionas / sayng. I shal sacrifice to yt wt ye vo∣yce of thankis geuing / & yilde▪ to yt what so

Now fith More coude not fynde this worde votū in al ye new testament to proue this perfeccion counseled onely in ye gospel / but onely in ye olde / where it was nether counseled nor cō manded: and sith he thus snatched out the textis at al aduentures wherso euer he foū de this worde votum: I wonder me howe this texte escaped him. Et mane vota po∣pulusExodi xxxvi offerebat / And the peple brought fo∣rth their willinge offeringis in the morni∣nge / whiche texte makethe nolesse for his purpose then it declareth what thinge vo∣wes signifie in the scriptures. ¶ Aftir this / as he wolde haue proued vs his vowes: so wolde he haue picked vs out a preisthed wt holy ordyrs / a sacrament to gyue grace / out of this texte of Paule vnto Timothe / saynge. Neglecte not the gyfte
that is geuen the in thinterpreting of ho∣ly scriptures / confirmed by the puttinge on of the handis and autorite of the elder. In this texte Paule exhorted Timothe vnto his office / puttinge him in mynde bothe of his gyft in prechinge & of thatoite of his callinge and sendinge. For prophy is ta ken here as it is in the i. corin. xiiii. for thex powninge and prechinge of the scriptures.act. xiii And thaposle maner was / some tyme by puttinge vpon their handis so to admit ād sende prechers and ouerseers into their u∣re and office. For first knowne that the mā was lerned / hauinge the gift of interpretin ge and declaringe the worde of god / withe ihe other qualytes as he recyteth in the. in. chap. before: than because noman withe oute a dewe callinge and admission of his elders / shulde thruste in himselfe into any cyte or paryshe / it was vsed and ordened of the apostles so by laynge on their handis to insinwe and certifye the peple of the abi∣lite autorite and worthynes of their pasto∣ur: which al / this puttinge on of the elders handis did testifye and signyfye vnto the: then sample (I thinke) taken at Moses / so commaunded to sende and admitte Iosua / Numeri. xxvij. But lorde how More m▪
seth this texte to shaue them oute a Sacra∣ment of holy ordyrs and that it geueth gra e. For firste where Paule saith: Neglecte not the gyft / there More saith. Neglecte not the grace. Nowe haue Moris grace. Then because yet the texte after the laty∣neFace. xiiij translacion hath not preisthed. More fl∣itteth to the greke / saynge. For these plac∣es (meninge also the texte. ij. Tim. .) shew both the sensible signe of laynge thapostles handis vpon Timothe in makinge of him preiste: and also that god gaue his grace th erwith. And the firste texte shewethe also after the Greke (in which it is whe the puttinge vpon the handis not of a prieste / as the latyn is / but of priesthed) the power and autorite that Timothe had in geuing the same grace forth vnto other whom he shulde aftir make priestis. o / nowe haue ye Moris preisthed to / picked oute of the Breke / for in the latyn texte he coude not fynde it. ye haue also that the laynge on of their handis made Timothe a prieste / and that God gaue his grace therwithe / and this texte sheweth the power and autorite that Timothee had in geuinge the same grace forth vnto other &c. If the laynge on of handis made priestes: then did Iacob
make both Iosephs sonnes preistis. Gene. xlviij. And Moses did put his hādis thus pon Iosua. Deuteron. xxxiiij. and yet in so doinge he made him no pryeste. So wereLeui. i handis put vpon their hoste and brente sa∣crifyces. And Cryste so vsed to laye his hā dis vpon the yonge chylderne / And bade his apostles put their handis vpō the syke. where euery man maye se that This put∣tinge on of handis is not a sensible signe to make priestis. For then must Paule hym selfe be twyse made prieste / once at the pu∣ttinge vpon him / y• handis of Ananias. Act cap. ix. and agen when the elders did put their handis vpon him / in the. xiij. of the Act. And Timothe was a prieste ere Paul did put his handis vpon him / that is to wit he was an elder / not in age / but in sage gra¦uite vertwe and lerninge / nether gaue god the gyfte of interpretinge scriptures (whi∣che More here callethe grace) therwithe: for he had this gyfte before thei did put th¦eir handis vpon him / orels wolde not Pau¦le by puttinge on his handis haue geuen him that autorite and sente him to preche Nether was it the preisthed picked owte of the Greke that did put hir handis vpon hym / but the elders or elder as it is in the
Latyne / for the Greke priesthed haue no handis / but the elderly men haue handis / accordynge vnto Paulis saynge. I exhorte the to store vp the gyfte of God in the / co∣nfirmedij. Ti. i. by the puttinge on of my handis / and not of my priesthedis handis / so fyn wolde More here picke oute his preisthed This sensible signe therfore yn puttynge one their handis / preched vnto the congre∣gacyon be holdynge this ryte / certifyinge them that this man was dewly and order∣ly with iste autorite admitted to be theyr pastour and precher. Also where More sai∣the / that this text shewethe after the Gr∣eke / the power and autorite that Timot∣he had in geuynge the same grace for the to other whome he shulde aftyr make preist∣es: I wonder he is not ashamed.  For thou∣ghe the Greke hathe presbyterij whiche More callethe preisthed / yet of that cane he not gather that Timothe had power and autorite to gyue his gifte of interpret∣ynge the scriptures / or as he saithe / the sa∣me grace whiche he callethe gatum faci∣ens / vnto other / for these be the gyftes of god as Paule testifieth. i. Cor. xiiij. and in ij. Timo. i. saynge. Steevp y• gifte of God
which is in the / which grace ād giftis it ly the not yn any mannis power one to g∣ue them to a nother. For they be geuen on ely of God the father by the holygoste for the merites of Crystis dethe. Nether ys the free spirit of God restrayned vnto any vtwarde sensible signe in gyuinge his gyf∣tis: but breathe whan and where he lyfte∣the. He is mightyer then mnnis handis / than the wynde / water or oyle / and is not aiyed of them. He karyed the wynde and not the wynde him. Acto. ij. And as nomāIoan. ij knoweth the course of the wynde frowhe∣nce it comith and where it resteth: nomore knowe we by any sensible signe the course and way of the spirit into owr sowlis. But this thinge requyreth a lenger dispu tacion: whiche I shal by goddis grace prose cute in the declaringe of siche textis as I knowe the enymes of grace and goddis gl∣orye shall brynge for them to proue the contrary. ¶ And in the mene ceason / because Mo re playeth with fastinge or faste as he did withe vowes and preisthed: I wyll declare what this worde Ieiunium (in Englysshe faste) fignifieth accordinge to the vse of the scripture / albeit I knowe that More abus∣ethe

But yet for this popishe faste More lassheth out al the autorites at once in whiche is contay∣ned this worde Ieiunium. As in Leuitico and Zachari. &c.

Here is Mores faste called an afflicci∣onZach. viij or humblynge. In Zachary. vin. thus is it wryten to proue Mores false faste. The faste of the fowerthe monethe: The faste of the fyfte monethe: and the faste of the seuenth monethe / and the faste of the tenthe monethe shalbe turned into ioye and gladnes vnto the howse of Iuda. W∣hiche is euen the same that Cryste sayde / Io. xvi ye shalbe full heuy: but yow heuynes sh∣albe turned into ioye / And for the vnder∣standinge of Zachary / ye shall knowe that Nebuchadnazer brake yn at the walys of Ierusalemyn the fowerthe monethe wh∣ich was to Iuda a grete faste / that is to wit

But had More ben as wy sem readinge the scripture as he makethe himselfe / he shulde haue see what fastinge

Inuke. v uke: the pharisayes and scribes came and asked Cryste why his discpples fasted not and prayde not as wel as did Iohan bapti∣sts disciples. whom Cryste answerde / that ye cannot make the chylderne of the bryde chamber so longe as the brydegrome is w∣ith them to faste: but the tyme shall come / their brydegrome taken awaye fro them / y• thei shal faste: This faste he declared by a similitude to be affliccion / sorowe / and the crosse caryinge.

And for a clere de∣scripcion of the very faste: rede the. xxxiiij. Psalme and compare it with the Popis fat faste in the choyse of meatis. Also the fast∣esat. xiij xiiij mencioned in the newe Testament are non other / but affliccion / moornynge / andIu. ij. v heuynes / wher vnto is ioyned prayer andMat. xvij. abstinence &c. As where Cryste saithe. This kinde. co. vij of deuyllis gothe not forthe but by prayerij. co. vi and fastinge. Which texte / for because Mo re obiecteth for the popis faste: I wolde fa yne knowe of him where euer our holy fa∣thers faste did aste oute the deuel? the deu el shulde sit longe ynoughe ere the Popis fastinge shulde decease him. And yet yf he bringe for him the castinge forth of the de∣uel oute of his waye holy maydens of ys wiche and kent / then dare I answere. Th∣at yn the mayde of ypswiche the Deuel pl ayde but o peip waytyng his tyme and place to stele Goddis glorye and worshyp frome hym to brynge it vnto that olde roten poste / almighty God so permittynge
him to mocke the vnbeleuers because they loue not the trouth of his worde / sendinge them siche stronge delusions to beleue ly∣es / that al siche might be dampned for notij. thes. ij. beleuinge the troute. And as for his ho∣ly mayde of kent / whose miracles / reuelaci∣ons / and holy fastis be esped and knowne to be delusions and deceitful doctrine of y• deuyl: I thinke / for al hir fastinge and pra∣yng aftir the popis prescript forme / yet the deuyll will tarye in hir stil / tyl faith in cryst purifye hir herte and so dryue him forthe. wherfore More shulde haue taken al Cry∣stis saynge togither and not snatched owte a patche of the hole clothe / as he is wonte to do. For Cryste firste tolde his disciples that their vnbeleif was the cause why thei coude not caste oute that deuyll. And than he declareth / that who so wil fight agenst the deuyl / muste goforthe armed with faith and that with siche a feruent faith that so∣roweth for hir owne feblenes praynge: lor∣de encrease me my faith / I beleue but hel∣pe my vnbeleife / so intente and geuen vntomar. ix. this prayer for the encrease of faith and la mentinge his owne vnbeleife / that he for∣getteth the bodyly paumperinge and fead∣ing thirsting onely for spiritual sustinaunce

Psal. cij. for he that so soroweth for the lacke of faithe and praye so feruently yt he forgetteth al bodely plesures and dilia∣tes / obrayneth his petition / euen in castin∣ge out that kynde of deuelles / sitte thei ne uer so faste / or so longe / euen from our con∣ception and vexe thei neuer so sore. And thMat. xvij erfore crist setto that similitude: compari∣nge faith vnto the Musterd sde &c. Than bringeth he yn Moses and Aarons fastin∣ges / and kinge Achabs fastinge and the pe ples faste in Esdra. viij. and Nehemias fa∣ste. ij. Esdra. i. And I cannot tel how many mo. to proue that al these fastis were lyke owrs as the pope haue commanded / that is to forbere flesshe or whyt mearis. but ād if thou rede the textis / thou shalt se fasting taken euery where a lyke / for the sorowful affliccion / heuynes / wepinge and wayling &c. as it is sayd ofte before. Also he saithe (whiche is moste damnable) that by siche fastinge they obtayned remission of synnes eleace of more payne and purchaced the grace. Vnto whiche I answer that y wor∣is purchase grace / than (as Paule saith) grace is no grace / for it is agenste the natu∣reRom. xi of grace to be deserued with workis / if
of workis / ergo not of grace / if it cometh of grace / ergo not of workis. For grace and workis are so contrary / that what so euer is geuen for the one / cannot be geuen for the tother / Grace therfore (concludethe Paule) is geuen frely / and not purchased with Mores choyse of meatis / Also if we for fastinge obtayne remission of synnes / ala. ij than dyed Cryste in vayne / as Paule conc∣ludeth. Then he saithe that Achab fasted to moue almighty God to mercy and to withdrawe his punysshement. I answere / iij. reg. xxi. as for Achab as the story declarethe was a wyked kynge and a damnable Idolater w∣homachabs penāce for fere of payn & not of faith god thretened to punesshe / as he dyd in dede / notwitstandinge his humiliacion (as the texte calleth it) whiche was not of saith to obtayne mercy / but it was for fea∣re of punysshement as was Iudas his rep∣entance / and god forbore the plage thre yere for Achabs humiliacion / but his fast∣inge nether purcheased him remission of synnes nor yet made any satisfacciō as Mo re wolde proue. For his posterite & he were wrecchedly slayne and the houndes lycked vp his blowde / as God thretened him for slaynge of Naboth. So that Achab for his fastinge had his porcion with the wyked ins. xvij
this lyfe for a lytel space / that his hell myg∣hte be the more greuouse aftir his wretc∣hed ende. and than after a longe brablinge and vayn profes that workis shulde deser∣ue heuen / he cometh to the Fastinge of theIone. 3. Ninyuites / saynge / That god synge the Ninyuites chastise and punesshe them selfe withe fastinge and other affliccions volo∣ntary done / did mercyfully take quyte aw aye the great and greuouse punysshement that was at hande ordeyned by hym selfe for theyr synnes and offences / and so pur∣chaced pardon by theyr fastinge & cet. But the texte tellethe vs a nother tale / and sa∣ithe that aftyr they had herde Ionas hys prechinge: They beleued yn the Lorde / and of this beleife they fasted / and God sawe theyr Workes as testymones of th∣eyr faythe. Whiche Faithe / it is that God beholdethe for owre iustificacyon. Ieremy. the. v. chapiter. saynge. Lorde thyGe. iiij eyes beholde faith. The Lorde behelde A∣bel and his gyftes / he sawe of what Faith Abel offred them / And so / by fayth he of∣fred vnto God a more plentuowse Obl∣acion then Cayn. Hebre. the. xi. Cha∣pyter. Thus the Prophets expowne
the lawe: and the newe Testament expow nethe them bothe. Nother Tyndal nor no man els denieth fastinge as the Scripture vsith it. but the scripture and euery cristeni. Ti. iiij man that knoweth the truthe of Goddis worde and haue espyed the falshed and ab∣ominacion of the pope and his Synagoge / taketh the popes choyse of meatis by cert∣ayn prescript dayes for euery man / for the doctrine of the Deuel: as Paule playnely calleth it. And it is the more Deuellish in that (as More saith and cannot proue it) yt by siche dedis men deserue grace / remission of synnes / and so heuen / whiche is iniury∣ouse to crystis bloude / and a deuellisshe doc trine improued and damned in euery parte of holy scripture. For althoughe many in the olde testament fasted and prayde for so∣me grete calamite / other caste al redy vpon them / orels nowe at hande / or of a speciall repentaunte mynde for their synnes / some tymes an holedaye / but seldem many dayes togither: yet was it not the vtwarde dede that peaced god / but the faith / wherof the dede procedeth as testimony of an humbl∣ed obedient and faithful harte. God is the insercher and inseer euen of the very secre∣te affectis of the harte / and aftir that faith
geuen vs / dothe he iuge and fauour / forge∣ue / and iustifye. Ye are preserued and sauedEph. ij saith Paule by grace thorowe faith / & this is not of yourselfe. It is the gyfte of God / and cometh not of our werkis / leste any mā shuld glorye and reioyse in him selfe. MenRom. iij are iustifyed and forgeuen frely by the fau∣our and grace of God / thorowe the redem pcion that is in Iesu Criste &c. After thatTit. iij. the goodnes and gracious loue of god our sauiour apered and did shyne / he made vs saulf / not for our good and rightwyse wor∣kis whiche we wroght / but he saued vs af∣tir his mercy. ¶ But as touchinge the place of iustif∣yinge of faith / and merites of workis / it is declared plentuously in euery englisshe bo∣ke late made / Wherfore I will passe ouer and make an ende / but firste I muste poin∣ge my self with a breife Apologye frome a owple of lyes that More maketh of me in the hondred and xcvi. leif of his longe Apo logye. saynge that I taught pursers sonne attendinge vpon me at London. viij. or. ix. dayes / my vngracious heresyes agenst the sacrament of the anter / And that two non∣nis were brought into my howse at Au∣erpe: Whom Iohan Birte (saithe he) stale

But the nonnes sayd playnely and yet af∣firme it that they came forthe leste they sh∣ulde haue bene made harletts in the cloist∣er by a vyciofe Prieste called Syr Io∣han Larke their stwerde / whiche by theyr saynge was not mete to be chaplayne vnto nonnis / nor nonnes to haue siche a stwerd: and therfore came they their waye / It is a perrllous poynt for Nonnes chastite to be reclused in siche a cloister where Prei∣stes be to familiare and bere all the rule beinge at me all tyde bedde and borde with in the place. Nether came these nonnis th∣en vnto my howse in Antwerpe I take God to recorde. And as for dicke purser / veryly the chylde laye withe me that lytell whyle and fetched me mea / whome I ta∣ught to saye by herte his Pater Noster / A∣ue. And Credoyn Englysshe / withe the two Prayers folowynge in the Ortulus Amme / to saye them in the morninge and euenynge / and this / yn good faith / was all the Herysye that I tawght him. I had beit an vndiscreit Maister so sodenly in so lytel space to haue taken forthe the chylde owte of his Pater Noster vnto the Sacrament
of the Auter / seynge the chylde was not yet of so full age as to come vnto Goddis borde: but this lowde lye / his M.

And as for my goodly Godly Pistle / whi∣che he remembreth in his confutacion and belyeth me therto / I knowe none syche / excepte he meane my answere vnto the pr∣iour of Newnnahms goodly Godly Pistle sente vnto his reuerent Father then bissh∣ope of Lyncole called (I trow) bisshope la∣ngley. nto whiche if it please hym to an∣swere me / I promyse him he shall procure him selfe more perpetuall shame then im∣mortall glorye / if he be not all redye paste shame. A Peroracion. ¶ But now (Crysten Reder) For a con clusion / to returne to my purpose. Because M. More is so temerariouse as to dare say and affirme that all trouthes necessary for our saluacion / be not wryten in all holy s∣
so complete / ferme and approued te stimones and Testamentis of God / faym∣nge certayn (I mote cre what) vnwryten vrites necessary to be beleued: Thou shaltWhat § Testa ent is knowe certaynly that God almyghty by the mouthe of his Prophet Iermy. xxxi. diuyded the hole scriptures into two Test∣amentis / the olde and newe: where a Te∣stament is as miche to saye as a promyse a vagyn or a couenaunt / wherby God hath promysed testifyed and declared his God∣ly wil and mercyfull plesure vnto vs / agre∣inge with vs vpon certayne condicions w∣ryten in the sayd Testament. As firste vn∣to our father Abraham offeringe himselfe. xvij vnto him with this promyse and couenant saynge. I will be thy God / for the and for all alone sufficient: I wil (I tel the) be thy god and to thy sede after the for euer: so y• thou walke before me / be perfit and pure. And for a declaracion and confirmacion of this couenant: god certifyed him / saynge. In thy sede shall all nacions of the erthe be blessaed. I shall geue the that lode that swimniethe in mylke and honey. I shal de∣lyuer the frome thyn enymes / withe an. c. siche other. By whiche testimones & pro∣myses
he declared vnder what forme and condicion he wolde be theirs and owr god. For we be of Abrahams sede and his chyl den if we resemble owr father Abraham in lyke faithe. And agen as concerning our parte / it is enioyned and commanded vs to haue no strange goddis / but in him onely that so mercifully assure the vs to be owre god for al alone sufficient / to beleue / to cle∣ue to / to depende vpon / to fere / to serue / to worship / to loue withe al our hartis sowle mynde and with al the might of our spirit / and our neghbours as our selues. These condicions are inculked and expressed clere ly and plentuously almoste in euery lefe of the scriptures. These do al the storyes tec∣he vs / the lawe commandeth and the Pro∣phetis preche vs them. Vpon faith and lo∣ue therfore stande bothe the Testamentis: whiche two thinges if we obserue / so wal∣ke we before god / we lyue pure and perfit in his sight accordinge to his wil. Where vpon there foloweth owr saluacion & lyfe perpetuall. This Testament / because it shulde pe∣rpetuallyWherf ore god commit d hys testam∣ent vn∣to lette rs stande: and because the Deuel es∣pynge it to be so contrary a scourge to his
kingdome and was so besy fro the beginni∣nge to peruert goddis worde whan it was not yet wryten addinge and puttinge ther to whan he tempted Eue (as nowe dothe More shewinge him selfe to be the very ch§ ylde of the father of lyes to seduce the conl gregacion and chirche of God) The heu∣enly prouidence of God did committe it at laste vnto letters to abyde vnto the world∣is ende that it might standforth agenste all stormey contradiccion of the Deuell / and his childerne / the very enymes of the tro∣wthe / not onely to defende it selfe by it sel fe / but to declare it selfe the very worde of God and to iuge and trye all mennis vnw ryten or wryten wordis whither they be trewe or false: to receyue them beynge con sonant vnto it / and to estiewe and dampne them beynge contrary. This worde therf∣orexix. and xix saith the Prophete is pure and precyo wse tryed aboue Golde or Syluer more gloryouse and riche / than any precyowse stone in whiche consiste the the some of our saluacion. Unto whiche we aspyre and pre∣ase thorowe fyer and water / and contende to haue it thorow a thousand perellis / wh iche worde because it is endicted and wry
ten of the moste benigne and lyberall God we knowe it to be the moste absolute / ful / and perfyt: whervnto no nother maye be added / nothinge maye be minisshed. And agene. Because it was wryten of the moste trwe God: we are perfitely assured of the vetyte and certaynte therof: so that when all other wordis as Moris vnwryten vam∣tes maye be douted of / and called into que∣stion: yet shall this wryten worde of God stande stil vndouted of / the moste certayne and trwe squyer to iuge and to trye all ot∣her by it: euen the pyler and foundacion of the trowthe as Paule callethe it / in. i. Ti∣mothe. iij. capit. This was wryten of the moste wyse / that it shulde be exacte withe owte faute or errour. It was wryten of the moste almighty God to endure for euer / to bere downe all other wordis contrary to it and to stande faste euen agenste the gates of hell. ¶ This wryten worde it behoued to be brought for the by lere and perfit men of lyuinge and of constant faithe. where∣vnto firste / Moses the moste faithful mini∣ster in the howse of almightye God was chosen euen to wryte and to committe it

Whiche wryten worde to omit∣te and neglecte / it is damnacion / to obaye and beleue / it is euerlastinge lyfe / To adde vnto it / to take frome it / or to change it / (whiche al More dothe) it is grete synne and wykednes. This scripture was after∣warde delyuerde vnto Iosua to be conseru∣ed / defended / and spred abrode: of whome by succession other men receyuinge it vnto the tyme of Samuel did preseru it. And than began the prophetis to floresshe / and open scoles were holden therof / Than be∣gan this heuenly holsome doctryne (as Pa ul so ofte calleth it) to be professed and pre ched openly. Not that these Diuynes the prophetes were the autors of this celestial diuinite / nor yet added or changed thei any thinge of this scripture and couenant whi∣che Moses had wryten: but these men per∣ceyuinge the dules: and blynde ignorance
of y• worlde / did dispute / expende / discusse and declare them the lawe ād lerninge be∣fore wryten & delyuerd them / & y• same pro∣phete cryste so ofte figured & promysed by Moses / thei began to open to shewe ād to set for the clerely before their eyes.

And albeit sometyme the study of the∣se holy letters floureshed / & sometyme wasy• script ures ab ode eu∣er neglecte: yet was it neuer (the prouidēce of god so prouydinge) vtterly omitted & loste. For when vnder Manasses / ther was sich a slaughter of propbetis ād the holy bokis laye rotted / couerd wt duste & eten with woriii. He. xxij mes / yet was ther Olda the prophetisse lef te / & at laste the boke of the lawe fownde in the temple brought forth into light vnder Iosias. At the captiuite of Babylon / were not many of ye holy bokis (as thei be now) smyten oute of their handis / loste & brent wt the temple? & yet did god reserue then Esd∣ras (as now hath he reserued many an Es∣dras) to repayer & delyuer them agen frō
perell that thei perisshe not vtterly. which was nolesse myracle than is shewed this da ye / to se the Emprow Pope and so many Kynges lordis Cardinallis bisshopes and the Deuyl to al agenste it / and yet magry their tethes all / God by a fewe vanesshed pore sowlis thruste it into their realmes ād sprede it into euery korner of them. And here yet wolde More haue these lurkinge sorte of heretyques shewe a myracle for th∣eir chirche / as himselfe bringeth yn for his chirche the maydens miracles of curtham strete nowe knowne for a false seducer / wh an God the very autor of al trwe miracles hathe shewed one manifeste miracle euen vpon More himselfe & yet cannot the best∣ely blynde asse se it. but what is this mirac∣le? verely God hathe declared Mores hi∣ghe witte and wysedome to be starke folis∣shenes / and confownded his highe brayne and grete lerninge / by these wretched beg∣erly foles of this worlde and starke heriti∣ques (as he callethe them). But to retur∣ne. Esdras (I sayd) was stered vp to restore and preche agayne the scriptures. And no∣we laste of al aftir many yeris God by hys euerlastinge cownsel hathe spoken vnto vsHeb. i by his owne sonne our sauiour Cryste euē

So that al the scripture testifyeth Cryste whi∣che euer alleged it agenste the Iwes mur∣muringe / affirminge it to be so ferme / that soner shulde heuen and erthe slyde awaye than one Iod or Title of the awe shulde perisshe. ¶ This Testament is ferme faste & im∣mutable / one alone euerlastinge. As there is but one God / one lorde cryste the hed of one catholik congregacion / so is there but one faith one flocke both of the olde faithf ul fathers ofiwes and vs one crysten religi on euer to endure.

The wordis of lyf Acto. vij. The prophetis which were so fer uent & redy to wyn y• peple to god beynge content euen to dye for their preching: we∣re thei so colde & negligent as to leue oute any thinge vnwryten necessary for our salua cion? The apostles the very messengers of Cryste as especially Paule whose labours and swet in the gospel exceded al others to wyn both ie & gentyle / beinge also ernest for his brotherne y• ies yt he desyerd to be castout of goddis fauour / so thei mighte be taken yn: was not this man thinke ye as er neste & diligent wt his pene as wt his wor∣de to wyn y• worlde to criste? Paule & his fe
laws knew in their tyme yt ye sowne of the∣ir wordis were but slyper voyces smytinge ye moste slyper sense to enter yn at one eare & to go out wt many at ye tother / & went but wt their bodis only for y• tyme, but their wry tingi shulde not onely be erde / but also offred to mennis eyes y• most suereste sense of al / to sowne thorout al y• worlde for euer where theirselues coude neuer come. Th∣ei saw their wrytingis (what contenciō o scisme so euer fel) shulde abyde for euer to decyse & determen y• trowth / & yt letters we∣re y• most faithful & suerest kepers of theyr wordis & voyces / Thei same also in theyr tyme y• their sermons & doctrine / dyuerse hearers did diuersely reporte into their scla wnder & perel of errours & false beleif: wh∣erfore to be suer & to auoyde these inconue nientis / & for y• other frutes / thei cōmitted their wordis vnto letters. Ioan preched (I doute not) first agēst Corinthus & Ebion ere he wrote / but to confute their heresye more suerly & more at large: what a gospel did he wryte: euen y• brason pyler & founda tion of the trouth to stand agenst / & to ba∣re down al sich heresyes to y• worldis ende But here saith More / yt the apostles were not so plentuouse wt their pennes as they
were wt their mouthes. Whervnto I ans∣wer yt thei were as riche & as diligent wt th∣eir penne / ye rather plentuoser thē wt th∣eir tonges. For yt man which wryteth  th∣inge wt delieracion which he hath spoken & preched so ofte efore / shal do it more ex∣actly & richely wt his penne then euer he sp∣ake it / sith the holy goste fayle noless his penne then he did before his tongue. I th∣inke Paule did setforthe snne / ye lawe / gra ce & y• gospel  nfyinge by faith onely in his pistle t y• om. wt his penne or spake it whyle his scrybe did receyue it: as rychely as euer he did pece these thinges by mo uch. ow compendioise an introducciō in to y• vnderstanding of y• hole scripture yt pi∣stle is / thi know y• haue laboed & studied it. Did not Crysstome / Austē / Ierome etc. ryte their homylies & sermons more large ly d clerely then thei preched thez? And if we might fetche a coniecture at the gen∣tyle letters / I wolde argue: yt Cicero his or∣acious wyten / karyed wt them more vehe∣mence / pehe / ād powr to persuade / thē sp oken: although I know y• y• speker ād pro∣noūcer gue his oracion spirit ād lyfe. For I thinke (ād so dide Milo himself) y• if Cice∣ro had sayde his oracion for Milo as riche
ād as plentuously as he aftirwarde wro∣e it: Milo had neuer eten so strange course is he in Massilia. But let these cōictures asse: ād turne we to the assuered certaynte f the wryten worde / to be set agēst Moris auerīg vnwrytē vanites which as thei cā ot certifye nor set no troubled cōscience at este: so put thei nomā in suertye of saluaciō is doth the wryten worde of god: excepte my man be so mad as to beleue Moris ba∣e worde better then goddis wrytē promise The wordis of god wrytē ar so certaynThe vn douted certain∣te of the scriptu∣re  thei be boūd wt an othe of his own mouth weringe by himselfe / so yt nether the tech∣er nor the lerner of thē nedeth neuer to do∣ute. And by this othe he hathe assuered vs of the same hrretage geuē vnto our fathers brahā Isaac et ce. if we perseuer in ye same aith and sufferance paciently tarying fo it in hope: setting befor our eyes the same self promysed hope whō we taryfore / Iesus cr∣st the very trouth of god ād the self promi se: of whō he assuereth vs so certaynly y• he alleth him the suer fast ancore of our sou∣is. (the grekis vse the ancore prouerbially for a suer ād salfe refugye / ād for al thingis that we truste ād cleaue to) Now what sue∣er ancor is ther thā goddis wryten worde
confirmed by his▪ owne othe / euen his eue∣rlastinge testament wryten in crystis blode ratifyed confirmed & sealed wt his dethe? vn to which testament saith Paule Gala. iij. throught noman to adde any thinge more or to change: which consyderinge y• assured certaynte of this worde ād gospell wryten / when he came to y• penninge therof to cer∣tifye his Timothe & Titus set to preche it / layde on these wordis as hammers saynge. Fidelis sermo / certus sermo / indubitatus sermo. It is aferme faste & a suer worde / cer tayne & vndouted worthy to be approued & embrased al maner of wayes / so yt it is profi table to teche to rebuke to exhorte &ce. It behoueth an ouerseer saith he to be glew∣ed to this assuered & certayne worde by wh ich men ar taught & enstructe / so yt thei may exhorte wt holsome doctrine & conuinceal y• agen say it. Our gospel saith Paule i. thes∣sa. i. was preched wt you / not in worde one∣ly but also wt power by y• holy goste in grete assuerance & certaynte as ye know. For he say nothinge but he proued it them by y• suer testimony of scripture whan he first pr∣eched wt them & conuerted them. Act. xvij. nd note wel Crysten reder whan Paule comethe to this certayn assuered worde of

T. to put him in mynde of this certayn gospel & of thassuerance of whom he was lerned ye scripture / how effectuouse myghty & perfit it is vnto saluacion / a none se wt how meru∣elouse erneste obtestacion he adiured Ti∣mothe before god & ye lorde Iesu cryste yt he shulde preche it: byddinge him to be feruēt be it in ceason or out of ceason: Improue re¦buke exhorte wt al pacience &c. Now crystē reder / I obteste & adiure ye wt Paule / before God & ye lorde Iesu cryste yt shall Iuge the quyk & deed at his aperinge in his kyngdo¦me / yt yu cleue vnto ye ancor of his wryten ād adsuered worde / not to leue it for Moris vnwryten rytes & ceremones / forsake not Goddis certayn wrytinge for Mores vnc∣ertayne vanytes.
