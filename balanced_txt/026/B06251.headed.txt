The True Lovers Joy: OR, A Dialogue between a Sea-man and his Love. The Maid implores the Aid of Charon's Boat, That to the gloomy shades her Soul migh float, With sighs and groans, much weary and opprest, At last he heard her moan, and gave her rest, From all past dangers, and from future harms, She safe arriv'd and Anchor'd in in his arms. To a new Tune, much in request. HArk Charon come away, bring forth thy Boat and Oars, And carry me poor harmless Maid, unto the Elizium shoars. Who Charon calls in hast, whilst I sit here in pain? I carry none but pure and chast, such as true Love hath slain. I am come, dear Soul I come, thy face doth so incharm me, Come in my Boat and take thy room, no wind nor wave shall harm thee. Now I am come in thy boat, I am a Maid undone, Sighing my heart is almost broke, for my Love he is from me gone. Thus as I pass the shades, I'le tell you a mournfull tail, So full of sighs as we do pass. shall serve us for a Gale. And so beguil'd the time, I'le sing you a true Lovers song, Mine eyes shal flow a sea of tears, to carry the Boat along. Oh what's become of those hard heart of a Virgins takes no pitty; They're sailing to Virginia parts, where Neptune hath built a City. O Cupid hath wounded me, and haht pierc'd my tender heart, To call for one whom I lov'd so dear, who cares but little for't. Thus in the shades below, we'l wast the tedious hours No gusts of winds, but sighs shall blow, the Boat with Charon's Oars. His Answer. Stay Gentle Charon stay, and let thy boat alone, Row not the harmless Maid away, that sirs and makes her moan. For she that calls so fast; and sighs so at thy stay. A Virgin is as pure and chast, as e're true Love did slay. She's no dear soul for thee, let not her face encharm thee, Though room within thy Boat there be, thee O fair one, if you go; I'me more undone than you, My Heart doth equal sorrow know, and still my Love is true. The shades you must not pass, nor mournful stories tell, In stead of sighing Gales, alas! a kiss will do as well. You'd better stay a shore, and sing us a true Lovers Song, It is enough we need no more to carry his Boat along. No Heart so hard I know, but would gladly ease your pain, Else heart let him to Virginia go, and never return again. If Cupid hath wounded you, he had wounded me before, I you Love as you say you do, I love you as much or more. In beds of softest Down, we'l spend the short liv'd nights, No gust of Wind or sighs shall drown, the current of our Delights. Maid. COme gentle Charon come and me to shore remove, The wind dispairing fight did blow, shall waft me unto my Love. How slow the Boats man stears, if he no faster ply, My love to rid me of my fears, shall lend me his wings to flye. To thee dear Love I float, finding thee just and true, And bid to Charon and his Boat, eternally adieu. Make hast, make hast my dear, for if thou longer stay, Through the floods without all fears, my Arms shall make their way. Welcome my Love to shoar, I'le keep thee from harms, And thou shalt ride for ever more, at Anchor in my Arms. FINIS. 1694.
