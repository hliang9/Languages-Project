FROM ONE who was moved of the LORD GOD to go a sign among the PRIESTS & PROFESSORS of the Prophets, Apostles, and Christs WORDS, But dead from their life, and naked from Salvation and Immortality, but as black as spiritual Aegyptians and Aethiopians, dead from the Life. And so this is to you spiritual Aegyptians and black Aethiopians which in obedience to the Lord, a sign I was made unto you all of your wickednesse and nakednesse in the sight of the Lord God, who will not be warned neither by word nor by writing, signes must be given unto you. William Sympson. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1659.
Oh Priests, Howl and weep, for a day of lamentation is com∣ing upon you, a day of woe and misery if you repent not, you are become as trees in the wilderness dry and barren, rotten with∣in, and the people are become like bryars and thorns, which growes under you, which the day of the Lord will burn and consume, which is coming upon you all sudden∣ly as a thief in the night; repent now while you have time least the day of wrath come upon you, for the Lord hath waited long to be gracious, and ye have rejected his Coun∣cel, and doth reward him evil for good; if any come a∣mongst you of his Servants, to bear their testimony against you, (ye are all become like bryars, and like thorns, and like withered branches lopped off the trees, dryed, fit to kindle the fire withal) either with their cloaths on, or with their cloaths off, ye are tormented, and your peace is broken; for the Lord is risen in his mighty power, for you have been warned from the Lord by his servants, by words and by writing, and all these hath not wrought upon you; now the Lord God is sending you signs and wonders, so that mens hearts shall fail with fear, with look∣ing after these things that shall come upon the earth; Therefore give over your wickedness, and come down in∣to the dust, and cover your lips, for there is no answer of God amongst you, the Lord is leaving you, because you have rejected his Councel; if you speedily repent not, sudden destruction will come unawares, for as it was in the dayes of Noah, so shall it be in the dayes of the Son of man; therefore consider your wayes, that the Lord give you not over, for the Lord proffers freely, and hath prof∣fered, and you have rejected and rebelled against the Lord; so if you repent not, he will bring you to destruction, for the decree is gone forth against all unrighteousnesse, and every tree that brings not forth good fruit must be hewen down and cast into the fire, but ye are almost fallen, your
time is near an end, the Lord will surely plead with you, for you are going on till all may see your folly, rending & devouring the Servants of the Lord, both in body and in goods; Oh blush and be ashamed, for the Lord God is coming to lay you naked, and give you signs of your na∣edness, both Priests and people, your profession is abomi∣nation unto the Lord while you are out of the life of righ∣teousness, the Lord hath spared you long, but now the Lord will bring your deeds and your nakedness to the light, that which hath been done in secret shall be made made manifest openly, for your ill savour is come up into the nostrils of the Lord, and he will reward you accord∣ing to your works, the day is approaching, wherein you shall gnaw your tongues for pain, and cry alas, for the day of misery is coming upon us, and then it will be too late; Therefore now while you have time give over your wickednesse, and give over mentioning the Name of the the Lord all ye who are found in iniquity, for the Lord will separate you, ye must all depart if you repent not with speed, and turn unto the Lord while the door of mercy is open; for when it is shut, you may call and cry and not be heard, for warnings from the Lord in words hath not wrought upon you, nor in writing, and you can∣not yet believe; Oh consider, gross darkness is coming over you; had not Egypt many signs and wonders before the seed came forth? you who are spiritual Egypt and Sodom, gross darkness is coming over you, so the Lord is giving you a sign, and yet you will not believe, but hardens your hearts, and stiffens your necks, like as your Fathers did, so do ye; therefore nothing can be expected to come upon you, but wo and misery if ye speedily do not repent, ye have many of you builded your neasts high, and thinks ye are safe, with a covering of the Saints words, but all will be too narrow, it will not cover you, the Lord is coming to lay open your nakednesse, ye Priests this is to you, ye shall become like trees in the win∣ter, not so much as leaves to cover you withal, but your nakedness shall appear as my nakedness hath done, as a figure unto you and many people; Come down out of
your imaginations to the light of the Son of God in you, that with it all actions may be brought to light, and turn∣ed and overturned, for the Lord will overturn the surest foundations that you can lay in your imaginations, and God abhors them; Therefore come down to the light of the Son of God that with it you may see the way of the Lord, and no longer that it may be foolishness unto you, for no man gathers graps of thorns; ye are thorny and briery, and thistly-natured, the Lord God is coming to o∣verturn and destroy; so this is a warning unto you to re∣pent while you have time, and give over your wicked wayes both Priests and people, and give over your bad u∣sage of the Servants of the Lord, when they come amongst you in obedience to his spirit as signs unto your wicked∣nesse, seeing words will not serve, nor writing will not serve, but still you go on in your wickednesse; Oh, fear the Lord God, for it were better that a milstone were hanged about his neck and cast into the Sea, then to of∣fend the little ones that believe in Christ; So consider what you do to the light of the Son of God, I speak that with it you may all come to be guided into the fear of the Lord, so your wicked wayes and words you may come to be redeemed from, and to finde mercy with God while the door of mercy is open; for you are all become as a Wilderness not inhabited, and the Children of the Lord passing through, is like to be destroyed by devouring crea∣tures, and this is a figure unto you all, for so are you be∣come in the sight of the Lord, envy and murder is in your hearts, as doth appear daily; if any of the Servants of the Lord be moved to bear their Testimony against your wickednesse in your hearts, thirsting after blood; the Lord sees your wickedness, and he will give you blood to drink, for he is turning your water into blood, you spiritual Egyptians, who crucifies the Lord afresh with your wicked wayes and ungodly lives which you go on in, and hate to be reformed, and casts the Law of God behind your backs, howl and weep, for misery is coming, and you cannot escape unless ye speedily re∣pent; Oh how is the Lord grieved with your abominati∣ons, the Lord is weary of your Sabbaths, and your so∣lemn
Assemblies he cannot away with them, wickedness is in your hearts; fear God, and give glory to his Name, for the hour of his judgements is come, wherein he will plead with all unrighteousness, repent repent, a cry is gone forth from the Lord, yea the sound of the trumpet; arise, ye dead, and come to judgement, for the trumpet hath been sounded in your ears from the Lord of life, and you remain stiff-necked and rebellious, and will not take councel at the Lord; so signs in your streets also must you have, that you may be left without excuse in the day when the Lord will come to reckon with you, that you shall not say you have not been warned, so your blood shall be upon your own head if you repent not, and the Children of the Lord clear of your blood, who in obedience to his spirit hath warned you to repent, for the day of the Lord is at hand, wherein he will reward every man according to his deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil, and though you be not gathered, my labour shall be with my God, & you must bear your iniquitie and prophaneness, and give an account unto the Lord for all your wicked wayes, and for all your hard speeches that ever you have spoken a∣gainst the Lord and against his servants, which in obedience to his spirit he warned you time after time, and yet you continue in your rebellion; so the Lord is wearie of you because of your iniquity, and will surely punish you in his anger if you continue stiff-necked and rebellious against him; for ye are all become like waters, unstabled, unsetled, but you shall not overflow the banks; The Lord hath set bounds to the sea, and he will make it stand as a wall, and be divided that his seed may pass thorow, and this is a mi∣stery to you who are in the Aegyptian bondage, and is de∣lighting your selves in your flesh-pots and onyons of Ae∣gypt, in pride and wantonness, and all manner of iniquity and profaneness, you are become like Sodom; Therefore haste to meet the Lord, return unto his light wch will shew you your dark wayes, and worships which you are found in, which the Lord is weary of; for you are an unseason∣ed people, you are not salted at all, the salt hath lost its saltness, and ye are good for nothing, but to be cast out
and trodden of men in the streets; Therefore turn to the light of Jesus, and with it you will see your selves to be in that state, and nature that is aforementioned, & can∣not be hid from the sword, storm, and hail, which your heads lie open too, and cannot be covered in this the day of the Lords battel against you, your oppression, your wick∣edness, persecution, prisoning till death the saints and ser∣vants of the most High God for your bellies, and that you have done against them, you have done against Christ, and have fought against him, the Lord who now is risen against you, and he hath drawn his sword against you, and his ar∣rows his quiver full; The darts of the wicked hath been long shot at the righteous, but now they shall be found all naked men without the weapons and armour of the Lord God as spiritual, as naked as I have gone among you, and that to you is the word of the Lord; The Lord is now come upon you as an armed man who doth work his mighty act by his power which is his right hand, overturning the safety that is not in him, bringing destruction upon them that crys peace, that are fat & full, & sayes all is well, who sayes no evil can come upon us, we have Church and Ministry, we profess the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles words; but saith the Lord, have not you prisoned unto death, them that be in the life of the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles? so do not I see your hypocrisie, can you dissemble with me saith the Lord, who thus hath long dissembled with men, making people believe that which you are not, making people believe that you are my Ministers when you never heard my voice, & I never spake to you, nor sent you? think you not that my fury and indignation is against you? think you that the crown of pride shall rest upon the head of the persecutor, that he shall go on in his ambition, and say who sees me, ha, ha, is not all our own? Is not all the Lords? am not I the Ruler of Heaven and Earth? can you hide your selves? do I not see it? have you diged deep to hide your councel, whereby your ends you would bring about upon the just? am not I a God of power? cannot I bring all things to light, and turn your bottom upward, and your inside outward, and strip you, and make you as
bare and naked as him that is sent amongst you, who is your sign and wondring stock, as though you had never read of the Prophets that walked in sackcloath? yea, and naked as the Prophet Isay, and as I have done, in Waltom, London, Colchester, Cambridge, and other Towns about, which was as death to me before I gave up to the service of the Lord, which is a figure of all your nakedness, though I am cloathed on with immortality. This is to you which preach to the people for your mouths, and for your bellies, which is a shame unto you, for the shame of your nakedness the Lord is laying open, and you cannot hide your selves from his presence, for the fire of the Lord is kindled against you, and the worm is gnawing in the conscience which shall never die, and this will be the portion of all that forget the Lord and rejects his Councel, and hates to be reformed, and casts his Law behind their backs, and will not take Councel at it, but kicks against it like wilde heifers not accustomed to the yoak, because of you the Land mourns, who live in iniqui∣ty, lying swearing, & all manner of prophaneness is found amongst you, will not the Lord visit for these things? will not the Lord be avenged on such a Nation as this? consider it now while you have time, least the time come that you may seek to repent, and there be no place found; so become Esau like, who sold his birth-right for the earth, so was hat∣ed of God, and so are all who are in that nature, who profess God and Christ, but are out of the life; the Lord ab∣hors, and will not hear your cries, though you cry unto him, and use his name, but he hath not sent you, there∣fore you have not profited this people at all, as it appears by the wicked lives and conversations in all places; so the Lord is blasting your works and bringing them to nought, for his decree is gone forth against the unrighteous; consi∣der this all who forget the Lord, and haste to return, and seek him while he may be found. THE END.
