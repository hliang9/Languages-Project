AN APOLOGETICALL DECLARATION Of the Conscientious Presbyterians of the Province of LONDON, and of many thousands of other faithfull, and Covenant-keeping Citizens, and Inhabitants within the said City and Suburbs thereof. Wherein their firmnesse and faithfulnesse to their first Principles, and to their Solemn League and Covenant is Con∣scientiously declared; And the Covenant-breaking and Apostacie of Others is disclaimed and abhorred before GOD and the whole World. Januarie, the 24th, 1649. Ezekiel, 17, 15, 18, 19. Shall they prosper, shall they escape, that do such things? or shall they break the Covenant, and be delivered? Seeing they have despised the Oath, by breaking the Covenant (when as, lo, they had given their hand) and have done all these things. Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, As I live, surely, mine Oath which they have despised, and my Covenant which they have broken, even it will I recom∣pense upon their own heads. Job, 22, 30. The innocent shall deliver the Iland; and it shall be preserved by the pureness of thy hands. LONDON: Printed in the Yeer, 1649.
To the READER. COurteous Reader, It is prudentially considered and concluded on by the Subscribers hereof, that (seeing their reverend Ministers Representation, with subscription of their Names hath not taken that happie effect which was desired, nor stayed the hands of those to whom it was directed) therefore the publishing of their names that have subscribed to this Apologeticall-Declaration, will in like manner, do but little good, in that respect; And, therefore, although they are upon re∣cord to the honour of the Gospel, they are not, now, pub∣lished, in regard of the present over-awing Power of the Sword; but may and shall in due time appear in publick, with more ample and (we hope) most satisfactory Demon∣stration of the just Reasons of this their present con∣cealment. Vale.
WEE the Subscribers of this our Apologeticall Declaration, who desire to approve our selves sincere Professors of the true Reformed Protestant Religion, Presbyterian Ci∣tizens and Inhabitants of the honorable, and, lately, famous and renowned City of London, who have cor∣dially adhered unto the Parliament, in its first and second War against the Kings Forces, for the defence of the true Protestant Religion, His Majesties Person, Crown and Dignity, the Rights and Priviledges of Both Houses of Parliament, and, in them, the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom: Calling to minde our solemn en∣gagements, not onely by our Protestation, May, 5th, 1641, but especially our Solemn League and Covenant, which was so religi∣ously and unanimously sworn unto, with our hands lifted up to the high and holy God of Heaven, that we would really, sincerely and con∣stantly, through the grace of God, in our severall Callings, and with our lives and estates, endevour the preservation of them all; Artic: 1, 2, 3, &c. And, being in our Consciences perswaded and assured of our indispensible obligation so to do, because most deeply en∣gaged by our said Covenant, not to suffer our selves, directly or indi∣rectly, by whatsoever combination, perswasion, or terror, to be divided or withdrawn from that Cause which so much concerneth the glory of God, the good of the Kingdom, and honour of the King: But, all the dayes of our lives zealously and constantly to continue therein against all opposi∣tion. Art: 6. And, whereas, by wofull experience, we are made very sensible of the dangerous effects of the violation of all our Covenant-concernments, and of the disappointment of our hopes of reaping the expected fruits of this defensive war, for which, we the Subscribers, have, many of us, adventured our lives, and most of us, our estates, in a measure, beyond our abilities, besides the Common Taxes that have been imposed upon us. And, though we cannot but with bleeding and trembling hearts complain that our Cause doth in these sad and perillous times in which we live, meet with such violent opposition, such mighty lets and impediments as we are not able to suppresse and over∣come:
yet, considering with our selves, that what we cannot suppresse or overcome we are obliged to reveal and make known. Artic: 6. Being also moved with fear, lest in this time of imminent danger to all that is dear unto us, our silence should be taken for consent, and so contract upon our selves the guilt of betraying Religion, King, Parliament, the Laws and Liberties of this Nation; having also no other way left us to set our Consci∣ences at liberty from the aforesaid guilt we might contract by our sinfull silence, in this juncture of time. We do, therefore, with all sincerity, fidelity, zeal, and humility, before the most just and righteous Lord of heaven and earth, make known unto all the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, to all the Re∣formed-Churches, and unto the whole Christian World, not onely the dis-satisfaction of our Spirits, at the late and present transactions of those who have forcibly assumed the Supreme-power into their own hands: But also do make this our following most solemn and serious Apologeticall Declaration for our clearing and justifica∣tion from allowing or assenting to the illegall actings of these pre∣sent times. And that we may also publish unto the world the grounds of these our most just exceptions and necessitated com∣plaints herein, we declare, That, not onely, in generall, our righ∣teous Cause before mentioned is perverted, deserted, apostatized, and fallen-from, by those who most injuriously and falsly re∣proach us with Apostacie for not associating with them, and bea∣ring them companie in their unwarrantable wayes; But, also, in particular, that it is perverted, and abused in every part & branch therof. As first, in point of our Religion, which we are most deeply engaged by Covenant to preserve and reform in power and purity; Whereas in our own experience (confirmed by the Parliaments first Remonstrance, Exact Collect: pag. 4.) Religion, in its purity was greatly endangered, in the Prelates times in the Doctrinall-part, by the errors of Popery, and Arminianisme; and in worship, with superstitious Innovations: And, in our sad apprehension, the Do∣ctrine of the Gospel is, now adayes, not onely more endangered through the increase of Popery and Arminianisme, but of most blasphemous Antiscripunisme, Antitrinitarianisme, Antinomia∣nisme, Socinianisme, and many other such like heterodox opini∣ons, and damnable doctrines: But also in point of worship, which,
instead of fear of corrupting, is, now, in great danger of abso∣lute Nulling, by accursed opinions both against the very being of Ordinances, the set-times and dayes appointed by God for their administration; and even of the Officers and Ministers appointed by Jesus Christ, for their dispensation. Which doth the more sad∣ly affect our hearts, and enforce this just Declaration and Com∣plaint, because of that so eagerly endeavoured unwarrantable Tolerating of them all (except, in that subtil exception of theirs, of the open practise of Popery and Prelacie) as if it were That Li∣berty of Conscience which we have all this while engaged for; But, rather, against which, We do not onely protest, but contrari∣wise professe and declare that it was, onely, a Liberty of Conscience from sin and error, which we propounded in our freedome from our former Egyptian Taskmasters the Prelates. In the next place, we further declare against the perverting of our Cause, in relation to the preservation of the rights and Privi∣ledges of Parliament. For, although we were not able to preserve and defend them, when violated by that unpattern'd and horrid force upon the House, Decemb: 6, and 7, last, 1648; yet we conceive our selves obliged to Declare against it, and against the impri∣soning and secluding so many of the faithfullest Patriots and assertors of the publick interest of the Kingdom; And also against the most insolent subversion and alteration of the constitution of the Supreme judicatorie of the Kingdom, consisting of the Kings Personall or Virtuall Presence, Lords and Commons, without whom (as we have been alwayes taught and informed) no Law can be enacted or repealed; The confirmation and inviolable settlement of which happie Nationall constitution, with its preservation, were the grounds of our engagements, and no change or alteration of the same: Whereas, now, to the unexpressible grief of our Souls we see a most strong and feirce combination in the Generall and Armies Councell of Warre, and others of their partie (set forth to the view of us all, in that Modell of theirs, called, The Agreement of the Peo∣ple, and presented to that which they call the Parliament, Janu∣ary, 20th, 1648.) utterly to subvert and overthrow the whole frame of our foresaid Legall Government, and to introduce and enforce upon us a most uncough, strange, and headlesse confu∣sed Arbitrary and tyrannicall Government of their own devising,
and by a new as headlesse Representative of their own compacting; and yet all this while, (even whiles they are most violently endevouring to overthrow all our National Fundamentall Go∣vernment, the very traiterous act for which the Earl of Straford and Cant': dyed, and which they now lay to the Kings charge to destroy him) most fallaciously and hypocritically they pro∣test, and strugle to perswade us (as, in pag: 29th, of their said Agreement of the People) that they are farre from any desire or thought to assume or exercise a Law-giving (these are their own words) or ju∣diciall power over the Kingdom, or to meddle in any thing, save the fun∣damentall settling of that power in the most equall or hopefull way (as they pretend) for Common-Right and Safety; And this, they say, they humbly tender to us, to consider, and accept of, if we please; Wheras, alas, we know, and ancient experience hath taught us to know, That a Tyrants or Conquerors, Pray, i an irresistible, Command; And this also is it, we thus justly complain of and declare against. But, in the third place, in relation to our engagement by the Sword, and Covenant to defend and preserve our Liberties and freedoms (in this our, late, most famous and honourable City of London) according to Law; we are most heartily sorie for the too last occasion that we have to publish, and reveal the most evident Perversion of our Cause under this consideration also. For, where∣as, to enjoy a Propriety in our estates, with a freedome from Pat∣tents, Monopolies, Ship-money, and other illegall Impositions and Taxes, the liberty of our persons from unlawfull arrests and impri∣sonments, contrary unto Magna Charta, our freeborn English Spi∣rits were raised (for their preservation and defence) most freely and even prodigally to lay out our persons and purses: We are, now, not onely in danger of intolerable slavery instead of freedome and liberty, according to Law; But, to have our Franchises and Priviledges, as Freemen of this City voted and rent from us. The deep wounding thoughts whereof do so affect and peirce our hearts, that we cannot any longer forbear mournfully to com∣plain, and Declare, That, since the 7th of December last, we are not onely deprived of our Freedome and liberty to make choice of such Common Councell-men, who have all along approved them∣selves, to God, the Parliament, and City, men faithfull in their trust; they being, now, made uncapable of being chosen there∣unto,
because of their honest Activity for the Personall. Treaty; And that, by an Ordinance made after this supposed crime was act∣ed. And, now, as a sad fruit of it, through many Common-Coun∣cell-men most illegally and forcibly chosen, in part of a Common-Councell, is passed a Petition, which, at best, shews the framers and promoters thereof, onely to minde Earthly things, not a word of any religious or heavenly concernment, being once mentioned in it; And, it is intituled, The Petition of the Commons of the City of London: Which is not onely a foule injurie and blemith unto the truly religious and cordiall Commons thereof; but fills us also with fear of future sore breaches of our Franchises, and City-liberties, if not to the totall subversion of the whole frame of the well-constituted and long experienced good Gouernment of one of the most glorious and renowned Cities in the Christian world. All which most injurious irregularities we cannot choose, as Citizens, but with ineffable greif of heart, here, Declare and complain of, being in conscience obliged hereunto, even by the Oath of Freemen; viz: The Franchises and customes of this City you shall maintain. So that, whereas, we fought for the defence of our li∣berties by Law,Exact Collect. p. 5. that our English Spirits might not be intimida∣ted or beslaved by the Kings designe of bringing in of Germane∣borse: We are, now, so farre from seeing any sure Foundations, for our liberties and freedome, according to Law, that we look upon our selves in exceeding great danger (upon that Common ples of the Army, Necessity) to be miserably subjected to Martiall-Law, instead of being ruled by the Municipall-Law of the Kingdom, And yet, as if nothing should be wanting to make us com∣pletely miserable, and exquisitely to pervert our Cause throughout; When both King and Parliament were in an hopefull way not onely of being reconciled, but of settling the Kingdome in a way that would have answered, (in some competent measure, for the present) the expense of our blood and treasure, and our Co∣venant-engagement also; we are now, not onely disappointed in our hopes thereof: But, His Majesties Royall Person (the defence and preservation whereof, though so carefully provided for, by the many Declarations of the Parliament, the frequent Proclama∣tions in our streets by the beat of the Drum, at the beginning of these Wars, by our Protestation May 5th, 1641, and by our
Solemn League and Covenant; yet, as if the end of our engaging with the Parliament had been for the ruine of the Kings person and regall Authority) His Majesties Person, we say, is not onely in extreme danger, by being exposed unto a Tryall without war∣rant either from the Word of God, or the Laws of the Land: But al∣so is thereby plunged into such a nature and condition, as is alto∣gether derogatorie to and inconsistent with the Kings Honour, which we professe in our Covenant, is the 3d part of our Cause, for which we engaged. Artic. 6. That the world, therefore, (to whom we appealed, when we entred into Covenant to preserve and defend the Kings Majesties Person, and authority, in the preser∣vation and defence of the true Protestant-Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdom) yea the Lord God himself, Angels and Men, may bear witnesse with our Consciences, that we have no thoughts or intentions (nor ever had) to diminish His Majesties just power and greatnesse, and that we the Subscribers hereof are not Cove∣nant-breakers, but do utterly dislike and disavow the present proceedings against him, either to the taking away of His Ma∣jesties Crown, much lesse his life, the very thought whereof we from our souls detest and abhor; We do, hereby, most freely, faithfully and plainly discharge our consciences, and do testifie our loyaltie unto the Kings Majestie according to the duty of our allegiance, expressed in the foresaid Protestation, May, 5th, 1641, and the Solemn League and Covenant. And we do, hereby, further declare, that when we so cordially concurred with the Parlia∣ment at first, in the opposition of the Forces raised by the King (se∣duced by evill Counsellors) as we propounded the preservation and defence of our Religion, Parliament, Laws and Liberties: so, also, to preserve, and not to ruine the Kings Person; but, mainly to re∣move the wicked from his throne, that so it might be established in Righ∣teousnesse to Him and his royall Posterity; But, we say, not to pluck Him out of it, and to bring him to an Arbitrary tryall for his life, both in respect of his Judges and their Law. In summe, therefore, we have (in all these most weighty re∣spects) too great and just cause to be extraordinarie sensible, that the bringing of the King (the Head of the Common wealth) to a tryall for his life, before an arbitrary and illegall power, war∣ranted by no Law of God or Man, and the most strange, irregular
and unparallel'd proceedings, and contemptuous carriages to∣ward His Majestie, The putting down of the House of Lords, and, The restraining of so many eminent Members of Parliament, by the Generall Councell of Officers in Arms, against all Laws of God and Man, the known priviledges of Parliament, the liberties of the Sub∣ject, and their justification of all these exorbitances, in print, instead of Repentance and deep humiliation for the same, is but a sad prologue to the ensuing slavery and ruine of all the Free-born Sub∣jects of this Realm: For, if the Head and most eminent Members of the Common wealth, legally to be protected from violence and tyranny, by so many Oaths, Covenants, priviledges, Laws and En∣gagements, be thus tyrannically and barbarously, already, insulted over, and trampled under feet, like dust in the streets, by an im∣perious Military power; We, who are inferior to them in all re∣spects, and not invironed with so many priviledges and protecti∣ons, cannot but most justly fear and expect far greater insolencies and intolerable pressures to be unmercifully exercised on us by them, when these pillars and foundations are not onely thus sha∣ken, but even quite removed and set-by; According to our Saviours own words. Matth. 10.25. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more wil they call them so, that are of his houshold? In sad and serious consideration hereof, therfore, we say, again and again, we cannot possibly keep silence, though it be an evill nay, because it is so evill a time: But, as, professors of the true re∣formed Protestant Religion, which teacheth no such Doctrines, as these fore-mentioned, and as are, now adayes so unblushingly practised, in relation to the Kings Majesty, and to the rest of his free-born Subjects, without any respect, or least distinction to their places or qualities; That we may, as much as in us lyes, wipe off that foul blot and scandalous stain that will (otherwise) inevi∣tably fall upon Religion, by this most horrid breach of our Cove∣nant, especially in relation to our King; that professors of the Go∣spel in other Kingdoms may not also suffer by being cast out of royall protection, for the sin of some (pretended) professors among us; And, that we our selves (when the approaching Earthquake, which is like to be in the three Kingdoms by fearfull commo∣tions and endles wars, & inevitably like to attend the intended deposure, or violent death of our Soveraign King, sadly falls upon
us) may not have outward misery, and inward guilt to meet toge∣ther, without and within us, even our Consciences flying in our faces, for our (at least seeming) consent unto it, by our sinfull si∣lence; But that we may (in the singlenesse and sincerity of our hearts) wash our hands and clear our innocencie in the sight of God and the whole Christian world: We do not onely, in gene∣rall, make this our just Apologie that we are far from the appro∣ving of the breach of our Covenant in any part or branch of it; But, in particular, in reference to that of the Kings Person, so clear and innocent, that we do declare our Detestation and Souls abhorrency of that most disloyall action; conceiving it to be such a sin, as Men must create a New Name, for, and God a New Hell or punishment for it. And, thus, now, having (in the unfeined sincerity of our hearts) witnessed a good Confession, as in the fight of God, and Men; not from a factious, seditious, vain-glorious, or peevish Spirit of con∣tradiction, or in the least tinctured vile malignity, or apostacie from the common cause of Religion, Liberty and peace of the Kingdom; Though we fear not persecution (for righteousnesse sake in being true to our principles) from those who have power, now, in their hands: yet, not knowing whether by Gods permissive pro∣vidence, Satan may not cast some of us into prison for, thus, setting our Consciences at liberty; We therefore commit our Souls, in this our well doing, unto God, as unto a faithfull Creator, hyding our selves under the shadow of his wings, till these calamities be over past, and looking unto Jesus, who hath assured us, That whoso∣ever shall forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father or mother, or wife or children, or lands for his Name and Truths sake, he shall receive an hundreth fold, and shall inherit everlasting life. We have therefore hereunto subscribed our Names with our hearts and hands. FINIS.
