A Lookinglass for the WHIGS: OR, Down with Common-Wealths-Men. A Country Fellow took a Daw, A Pillaging his Wheat, And, tho' 'twas Hanging by the Law, Ty'd only one of's Feet; Then gave him to a little Child, Who with a deal of Joy Made much of him, and laugh'd and smil'd At such a pleasing Toy: But yet the Bird was mighty dull To think he was confin'd, And, tho' he had his Belly full, Was not content in Mind; Wherefore he from his Keeper slip'd, And, longing to be free, To an adjacent Thicket skip'd, And kaw'd out Liberty. When 'twas not long before the String He had upon his Foot Entangl'd him, and made him sing Another kind of Note; And, ready to give up the Ghost, For want of usual Food, He own'd that he himself had lost, Not knowing what was good: Fool as I am, I was preserv'd While kept from being Free, He cry'd, but now, alas I am starv'd, And with my Life have purchas'd Liberty. The MORAL DOwn, down with Kings, our Common-Wealth's-Men cry, The Name's infectious grown, Nor let the Rays of Liberty Be darken'd by the Throne. When, should the Powers they pray to grant The Mischeifs they implore, The Nation would experience the Want, And starve, that pinch'd before. LONDON, Printed for W. Kent In Cornhil. Price one Penny.
