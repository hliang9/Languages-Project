A TOUCH-STONE FOR Physick, Directing By evident Marks and Characters to such Medicines, AS Without Purgers, Vomiters, Bleedings, Issues, Minerals; or any other disturbers of Nature, may be securely trusted for Cure in all extreamities, AND Be easily distinguished from such as are hazardous or dangerous: Exemplyfied By various Instances of Remarkable Cures performed solely by such Medicines. LONDON, Printed by J. W. for Benjamin Billingsley, at Gresham-Colledge-gate, near the Church in Broad-street 1667
To the Ingenious Reader. SInce the generous breeding of most Physitians, in reason may be presumed to have freed them, more from envy and partiallity, then less Phylosophical professi∣ons; though here and there some few may appear perverse: yet now there seemeth no cause to doubt their ready and cheerful entertainment, of whatsoever can be proposed for support of humane frailty, or relief of distressed patients, and the ra∣ther because of their frequent, and free converse with the most noble Virtuosi, those ample encouragers of all improving Studies.
The scruple being rather, how this Discourse will be disgested by those who are furnishers of all sorts of ingredients; and also by the pre∣parers of Medicines: for since self denial, may not like their Semper vivum be alwaies green and florish∣ing. If it cannot be proved, that both shall be no losers; how can it be expected they should freely yeild to such an alteration, as this Touchstone imports, though the whole Society of practisers should deem it requisite. For abatement therefore, of any proness to opposition, it may be needful to give this assurance to all those, who furnish either forraign or domestick materials, that in this
sublime and more refined way of Medicine; not less but much larger quantities, are likely to be used, in that where much can yeild but very little, much of necessity must be employed. Then for the preparers, and con∣veighers of Medicines, between Physitians and Patients: were all expressly to be regulated, according to the Marks and Characters here∣in specified, no loss at all appeareth; for in this pure, liquid, powerful, pleasant and durable way; not one spoonful would ever perish or decay upon their hands: neither Time, nor Winters cold, nor Sum∣mers heat, in the least impairing their virtue or efficacy: a recom∣pense
far surmounting all objecti∣ons, if what they yearly lose by perishable ware, be but duely weigh∣ed. Nor is this new way less vindi∣cative of their reputation, not only seldomer failing of their desired success in Cure, but not the least quantity ever cast away by their Patients, being such as is service∣able to them sundry waies, which how many hundreds if not thou∣sands of pounds would be saved yearly in Patients purses, may be worth their consideration, nor is there many of their present prepa∣rations, but what by solicitous Study, and ingenious Art, may be converted into this clear stream of Physick.
Besides, where one now in the present way of Medicine they are in, makes use either of the Phy∣sitians advice, or of any other pre∣parations; and when they do, do it but meerly for necessity, as dreading the trouble, tediousness, and danger thereof, well nigh as much as sick∣ness it: In this pure, pleasant, and safe effectuall way, twenty at the least would be frequent and familiar therewith, no time of the year be∣ing unseasonable, no scrupulosity in the dyet, no pains nor gripes in ope∣ration, nor tiresome confinement, to house or chamber, (unless when extreamity enforceth) nay when they are proper for all persons in all weaknesses, and distempers, from
the Cradle to the oldest age: may be also taken in Dyet for improve∣ment thereof, and in Recreation as the most pleasant and reviving re∣freshment, what infinite quantities must necessarily be employed. So that they could not but be vast gainers every way, both in profit and credit, by so happy an alterati∣on, bringing also to the Physitian, be∣sides the respects and rewards usu∣al, if not more and greater. The inestimable contentment of a quiet mind, resting securely and calmly amidst all occasions and ex∣treamities, with this sweet reposito∣ry that he runs no hazard with his Patients, and yet supplies them with the utmost helps imaginable: so
that both the Physitian, the provi∣der of Materials, and the preparer of Medicines, are all in an assured con∣dition, unto whom I wish one more were added, so far am I from desi∣ring the prejudice of any: And that is Studiers and Inventers of Medi∣cine, known only by their faithful∣ness and the fruit of their producti∣ons: To be encouraged therein, and not to be diverted with any other part of Physick, or Practise; for if truly such, they will never be ma∣ny, nor desire any other business, being not such by Education, but by Birth and Nature; for some Title whereunto I appeal, to the just re∣storation of the pallat, to its pri∣stine jurisdiction, in discerning
Virtues, and choise of Materials: And to the successeful conception and appropriation of the true hu∣mane temperature, that Clavis Me∣dicinae, not consisting in the equality of the Elements or Humors (as most may imagine) but in the Proxi∣mity and Coherence of the spirit, and all parts of the Medicine, with the spirit of the true Humane con∣stitution; without which, those who traffick for Medicine, may be as coasters; but no considerable new discoverers: This being to the Arts advancement, like Columbus his card to his discovery of the Indies, who though long seeming but as a vain boaster, yet those who first gave credit found it, far exceeding
his report; and so I doubt not it will prove here, the Medicines herein proposed for an example, ne∣ver doing harm, but good where ever they were taken, many wish∣ing they had known them sooner, never any repenting their use: And if the Body be more worth then Rayment, and Health to be preferred before Riches, it being not in Mountains of Gold, to give that exemption from the pains, fears and miseries of sickness, which resides in a benign powerful Medicine; your good acceptance of these overtures, will never blemish either that Virtue or that Pru∣dence, for which you will be ever highly honored, By Your Most humble Servant, W. W.
The Preface To the Reader. IT being usual for Authors in Prefaces to render an account of the occasion which gave Birth to their writings, and  acquaint the Reader with the design or scope of their Discourses, I thought it conve∣nient to continue a custom approved by many Illustrious examples.
Let me therefore give thee to understand, that it is not desire of applause hath engaged me in this Controversie. The care I have taken to conceal my Name will, I suppose, free me from such suspicion; but besides, let me assure thee I am too far from pro∣mising my self any addition to my Repute from this scrible, That I do rather apprehend it will lessen my Esteem with many of those excellent Persons, who are now pleased to Ho∣nour me with their Friendship: and do expect from me Discourses very different from those I here present thee. Which considerations surely will gain me credit, when I affirm That no Motive besides that of pub∣lick
advantage could ever havepre∣vailed upon me, to exchange my dar∣ling Studies of Experimental Phi∣losophy, and Physick (most pleasing and profitable imployments) for barren Controversie, which I ever declined. And among all, if I had consulted my own quiet or Interest, I should have avoyded this wherein I have now engaged; which may oc∣casion me much trouble, but cannot possibly bring me any advantage, be∣sides that satisfaction which is al∣wayes the result of Actions well in∣tended. Which pleasure I must con∣fess will be much heightned, if this endeavour of mine meets with good entertainment and work the desired Effect; which that it may have, I
will particularly address my self to all the Persons concern'd with me in this debate: Who are the People or Patients, and Physicians. This Discourse is chiefly intended for the First, it being they, who are most highly injured by the unwar∣rantable practices of those we have therein accused; for although many understanding Persons among the People are sufficiently sensible of the abuses we have manifested; and that it is of absolute necessity some reformation be made: yet all are not thus perswaded, for we may dai∣ly observe, that many who are less discerning, being deceived by an imaginary good, covet their own ruins; and unless they be given to
understand which is the evil and which the good, by persons in whom they have reason to confide, they must necessarily run much hazard. I have here endeavoured to unde∣ceive them, which I should dispair of, did I only foresee inconveniences a far off (the Vulgar being led by sense, and not by probable conject∣ures) but since they do now actually labour under many, and those obvi∣ous inconveniences, how short soever their sight be, the sense of feeling be∣ing no less acute in them, than in o∣thers I perswade my self they will rea∣dilygive their assent to those Truths I have here discovered. Now there are many things whereof most Apo∣thecaries are highly guilty, as care∣lesness,
Ʋnskilfulness, Ʋnfaithful∣ness on the one hand, and Intrusion into the Physicians Imployment (I mean the Practice of Physick) on the other: on all which accounts as I have fully demonstrated, they are exceedingly injurious to the Publick. In order to the prevention of such unpardonable abuses of the People I have made this Proposal, That Phy∣sicians prepare and dispence their own Medicines; and at large shewed That the advantages of such a Con∣stitution will be manyand great. For it will much abate the charge and expence of Physick, and the Me∣dicines themselves will be more safe and effectual than now they are, interest obliging Physici∣ans
to have their Physick as good as they can contrive or prepare; and certainly such a State of Physick of all other is most de∣sirable, wherein no man having the Interest can have the Power, nor any having the Power can have the Interest to prepare Me∣dicines unfaithfully: wherein bad men shall be made good, and those that are good never be tem¦pted to become dishonest. And in that Constitution of Phar∣macy for which we contend, sup∣pose men be never so bad; yet ne∣vertheless their wickedness can∣not have any ill influence on Physick, as is manifested at  in this following Discourse: so
if the sick have regard, either to profit or safety, they will address themselves to those Persons who sup∣ply them with the best Remedies, and at cheapest Rates. And as for Physicians, they must necessarily put their affaires into some such Method, as this we have commended; If they have any con∣cern for their Patients, or intend to improve Pharmacy it self. For as it hath been well observed, if we de∣pend only upon that we read in Books, we shall never promote this Art beyond its present limits; and if Physicians in former times had not been knowing in Simples, examined their Vertues, and Tempers, enqui∣red into their Effects, and mixed
them with their own hands, there had been no such Science as Physick. Now according to the An∣tient Axiom, Ex quibus Consta∣mus, ex iisdem Nutrimur, Those things which gave a being to this Noble faculty must help to make it compleat; towards which as nothing can contribute more than the im∣provement of Pharmacy: so neither can any thing promote that, more than Physicians taking it into their Management. But besides all this, it is fit that they who exercise themselves in the Practice of Phy∣sick, be satisfied their Medicines are good; whereby their Mind will be free, and without any clog: which would add more difficulties and
dangers to a thing by it self hard and dangerous. These and other Considerations mentioned and insisted on in the following Discourse will I assure my self, perswade all Physicians who have respect to the good and benefit of their Patients, Honour of their inrofession, or own Reputation, to put Pharmacy into other hands, and into better Methods, than those wherein at present it is; Whereby they who now dishonour it (I mean the Apo∣thecaries) will either be reduced to a sense and performance of their Duty, or sufficiently punished. For Notwithstanding that they do now Ʋnanimously resolve with associa∣ted endeavours to Oppose all Refor∣mation;
yet I am perswaded that if Physicians take some such courses as those I have mentioned, the event will be the samewith that of Muti∣nies. Where if the Commande be re∣solute he makes some of the Muti∣neers exemplary, and threatens o∣thers; of fierce, that they were in general, each one out of his particu∣lar Fear becomes obedient: So how insolent soever the Apothecaries now are when they see their Punish∣ment neer and certain, not trusting to one another, they will hasten all to Obedience; especially if good en∣couragement be given to those who return to their Duty, and become Reformadoes. And now (to hasten to a Conclu∣sion)
if any fancy, we have too rude∣ly attaqued the Apothecaries, let them consider (and then certain∣ly they will excuse us) that what we have done is only in our own de∣fence; for we had never interrupted their quiet, could they have con∣tained themselves within due limits and not invaded our Profession. So that if the Case be stated rightly, it will appear most evident, that we are on the Defensive part, They the Aggressors; and that we can∣not justly be blamed, if in our own Defence we offend them: or if being forced, we take violent Courses, whose End yet is not (as may be pretended) Destruction and con∣fusion, but Order and redress.
Nothing now remains but that I Apologize for the defects of the en∣suing Discourse. It may be objected, that the Method is not exact, the expression rude, the Style unpolished and abrupt, the parts not closly cemented by handsom and sutable Transitions. All which I readily acknowledge: But withall Desire the Readers to consider that this Book was begun and finished within the space of six or eight dayes at the most; and even then I was not free from diversions of many kinds: so that being penned in so short a time, the subject it self un∣pleasant, and the writer variously distracted, it is scarcely possible it should be compleat in Method or
Expression. Besides, this Discourse was not calculated for Scholars, but for the Vulgar to whose capacity it is adapted; for if I had intended to instruct the former, I would have taken more time and pains, di∣gested the matter better, disposed it more advantageously, and en∣deavoured to cloath it in more handsome expressions. I must not here forget to ac∣knowledge, that I have borrowed several passages from the judicious Author of a late excellent Di∣scourse concerning the State of Phy∣sick, and the regulation of its Practice. I suppose it will be easily imagined that I could have spoken the same things in other words; but
my respect for that Worthy Person disposes me to believe they will sound better and be more effectual in his own language; although I must crave his pardon for transpo∣sing some, and accommodating o∣thers to a proposal, he did not then think fit to mention. For Faults in Printing &c. the Printer must be responsible; and particularly for that formall be∣ginning of the 177. Page, which was never so intended by the Au∣thor. This is all with which I thought fit to acquaint thee, I shall there∣fore now end with this request. That thou determine nothing in the behalf, or to the prejudice of this
performance, till thou hast imparti∣ally examined all that is contained therein; and then if it appear that I have spoken truth, I expect it should be owned and promoted by thee: if I be in any thing mistaken I am content to hear of it, and ready to retract whatsoever is not consonant to Truth and Reason.
A TOUCH-STONE FOR PHYSICK, &c. THough of all the Na∣tural Sciences, that of Physick, and there∣in, the Medicinal part is of most Con∣cernment to Humane Happiness: yet is there hardly any Art, Science or My∣stery, whether for Delight, Conveni∣ence
or Necessity, but what hath got∣ten the start thereof, by many degrees, of real Improvement; Whilst Physick, the chief of Arts, instituted for the pre∣servation of Man's health, without which all his felicity in a moment is turned into gall and bitterness; hath so little to glory in, that notwithstand∣ing infinite endeavours of the studious, with the utmost help of Chymistry; the mok skilfull do ingenuously confess, They believe the far better part rests still undiscovered. A Truth too evident, and the sad cau∣ses thereof too manifest to be doubted; yet so accompanied with unpleasing re∣flections, both upon the Speculative, Inventive and Practick part, that I willingly decline all repetition of what∣soever upon my enquiry fell into obser∣vation. Onely as to the most Important, and which render'd the whole Fabrick craz'd and tottering: I must needs say, That
to my Apprehension, the aims of the Studious, Inquisitive after the Conser∣vation or Restauration of Man, the sole Subject of Physick, had not been taken aright, nor in due measure proportioned to so peculiar and so refin'd a Being. For, permitting my Understanding its free course throughout the Wilder∣ness of Physical Notions; at length my thoughts thus fixed: That the O∣riginal constitution of Humane Nature, being at first but One, however since deviated into various Temperatures and Complexions; and being far more sublimed, than any other Creature on Earth, to render his Body a fit Instru∣ment for his Divine contemplative and discoursive Soul. The whole mass of assistants assigned by this Art, for his supportation or recovery, appeared ei∣ther so weak and impotent; or else so course, casual, violent and dangerous; as seemed very unsuitable so sublime a Nature.
Upon which, I conceived it unde∣niably requisite, that all provisions and preparations designed for help of Man∣kind, ought in special manner, both in purity, efficacie and pregnancy, to hold due and just proportion to the peculiari∣ty of the true Humane Temperature or Constitution: and that all administra∣tions of a gross, impure, or improper, unbenign nature, must needs produce cross and perverse effects; and could not but be the main occasion of the mani∣fold failings and miscarriages so fre∣quently and apparently discernable in Physick. With which conclusion being very much satisfied; my hopes soon led me into persuasions of a possibility of rai∣sing new ayds both to Diet and Medi∣cine, so refined, and so suited to the true Humane Constitution, and so appropri∣ate to distinct Infirmities, Distempers, and Diseases; that, administer'd in any case, and to any complexion, though
never so far distant from the original: should really intend its reduction, and without any disturbance of Nature, by Loosners, Vomiters, Bleedings, Issues, Shaving the head, Clisters, Blisters; and without Minerals, or any hazardous or nauseous Ingredients; might ratio∣nally be relyed on in all extremities: And this solely from their powerfull friendliness to Humane Nature, and effi∣cacious virtue in extinguishing the veno∣mous causes of Diseases. In pursuance whereof, depending ve∣ry much upon my palate, long exercised in determining of Virtues, (by which, Compounds, as well as Simples, became equally liable to my assistance;) and pressed thereunto by an express propen∣sity in Nature: In process of time I proved so succesful in choice of mate∣rials, and in heightning and uniting of Excellencies; as by degrees to raise a large variety of so kindly and so power∣full Medicines, That not onely have ap∣proved
themselves serviceable to the Healthful in Diet and Refreshment; and to the weakest women and children in manifold infirmities; but in greatest ex∣tremities, (all other means failing) have frequently been prevalent, beyond all hope or expectation; and this too (ac∣cording to my ayms) without any out∣ward Violence or inward Disturbance of the body, either by Vomiters, Loos∣ners, Minerals, or any other Disturbers of Nature. Insomuch that their various, weighty and remarkable performances have long time represented their peculiar qualifi∣cations, as so many evident marks and characters of Real Medicine, whereby to distinguish such as are (from such as are not) to be trusted in cure, or fit for Humane Constitutions. And to my own particular; ever since I understood them, they have served me as a real Test or Touchstone of Medicine; using no other, for any that rely on me
in any occasion, but Medicines of their qualities; wherein having been suc∣cesful, to my own satisfaction, and o∣thers approbation, yea even to admira∣tion: I have thence entertained some apprehensions, that it could not be taken amiss, but rather as a fair progress to∣wards the Arts Improvement, to pub∣lish these Marks and Characters, as a competent Touchstone for probation of Medicine in general; especially of my own; and thereby possibly come to be somewhat better understood, as to my Physical Conceptions, than hitherto I have been; some having been over for∣ward to imagine, all I aymed at, or had attained, amounted to no more, but one∣ly some pleasant preparations and pro∣ductions, serving merely for Refresh∣ment and Recreation, without any ma∣terial effect or prevalencie upon Distem∣pers and Diseases. Whether it be so or not, and how far they are mistaken, who thus censure, the whole Discourse will
plainly evince: and haply may prove a safe and sure Guide to distressed Pati∣ents, what kinde of Medicines to avoid, and what to embrace, in any their ne∣cessities. The Marks and Characters, with their Grounds or Reasons annexed, are as followeth. AS, First, I conceive, a benign kind∣ly Medicine ought to be Liquid: and this, for avoyding that difficulty and disturbance incident in the disge∣sture of those of grosser substances; and likewise for the evil consequence of their remaining earthy parts in the coats, films and crevices both of the stomach and bowels, which generally so clog and tire the natural faculties to expell them; as instead of that quiet and ready help requisite in Sickness, makes Nature a new and tedious work in their avoid∣ance; as whoever notes shall find in a
sad dejection of Spirit when they have done their best. Whereas things Li∣quid, if milde, disturbe no part, puts Na∣ture to no stress in ordering them to its best advantage, nor leaves any remains for after Inconveniences: but through their gentle Vivacity, and insinuative Virtues, (like the Waters of Life) im∣mediately prosecute the prime End for which they were taken. II. I conceive they ought not onely to be Liquid, but transparently clear and pure, exempt from all grossness of residence or taint of rankness. It being possible to have liquid things as bright and clear as Chrystal, which yet in smell no carrion ever exceeded in noysomness; a tang whereof, any one that notes will find, in most of what is used for Refreshment or for Relief, in first Illness. Which should be heedfully avoided, because by things course, rank, or tainted, the whole sourse of Blond and Spirits be∣come insensibly to be corrupted; all
faculties debilitated; and the best and strongest constitutions, by degrees, be∣trayed into the worst distempers; there∣fore, like Virtues descending from a∣bove, they ought to be immaculately clear and pure. III. Such Medicines as may be tru∣sted in cure, I conceive, ought, as much as is possible, to be Pleasant and to suf∣fice in small quantity; that they may not in the least be burdensom, but at first touch appear like true and chearfull friends, that make the distressed heart leap for joy; no sooner tasted, but Na∣ture bids them welcom, and easily dis∣poses them to their proper service. Bo∣num & jucundum, as in Divine benedi∣ctions, being never to be separated in Physick. IV. Such Medicines with the pre∣cedent qualities, ought especially to be highly virtuous and powerfull, and which at first tast, by their lively, spightly, yet milde quickness, should
evidently appear such stout, long∣breath'd valiant Champions, as are tho∣roughly qualified to tug grapple with, and subdue the most violent, ve∣nemous, pestilential enemies of Mans Health and happiness: And yet withall so milde, gentle and manageable, (like our blessed Lamb and Lion couched to∣gether) as Children in greatest weakness may partake with safety; and for assu∣rance that they are such, the prescribers, if desired, are to take the like quantity in sight of the Patient or Relations, for the more undoubted assurance of its inno∣cence, and that it partakes not of any ha∣zardous ingredient. V. Such Medicines as may comfor∣tably be relyed on in cure and in cases of extremity, ought to be so truly friendly to Humane Nature, that if taken by man, woman or childe, in health, shall no ways move their bodies, but shall nou∣rish and strengthen them: and yet if by any in Sickness, the very same Medi∣cines,
taken in the same quantity, shall in due time either open or binde, vomit or stop vomiting, sweat or restrain swea∣ting, give sleep or abate excessive sleep∣ing; as the instant necessity of the body most requireth, or most conduceth to recovery. And this, as the most distin∣guishing character, I conceive, is most to be noted by the Ingenious, and to be insisted on: For how can that possibly appear truly to deserve the Name of a Medicine, or real helper of the sick, or be rationally deem'd to work upon a di∣stemper; which, if given to a well per∣son, shall either binde or loosen him, vomit, or sweat, or lay him asleep, even as it doth those who are sick? and which if given to never so sound a person in larger quantity, shall purge him, or vo∣mit him into his grave, sweat out his last breath, or sleep him past ever waking to this life; which are the known qualities of most things given in Sickness: So as with much more likelihood they might
be stiled Disturbers of Nature, (for how else do they thus work upon the health∣full?) rather than Medicines and friend∣ly Helpers, whose good qualities are with tenderness to cherish and retain all that's good in the body, and without the hazardous violences of Purgers, Vomi∣ters, Bleedings, Issues, Shaving the head, Clisters, or Blisters; and without Mi∣nerals, or other nauseous or dangerous Ingredients, to exclude onely what is evil; and not, Bedlam-like, turn good to bad, and then madly throw out all together; which are the properties not of Heavenly and peaceable, but of In∣fernal wrathful Spirits. VI. And lastly, Such Medicines as may be justly relyed on in cure, that they may be known to be compleat, ought not to be perishable Commodities, which argues such defects, as renders them unlikely to hold out upon a long march; being apt to tire, grow faint, sick, weak and heartless, before, or when
they come in sight of, or near the ene∣my, therefore they ought not to want this sure Mark, (Close stopt) to keep Good for Years (in all Climates) and in full strength and vigour without any the least diminution; much after the simi∣litude of an endless life, which is no small assurance of their real virtue and efficacy. Then having all the other precedent qualities conjoyned in every medicine; and a large variety of them, (variety being singularly useful) you have medicines most Masculine and Heroick, such as may confidently be relied on for Cure, and be easily di∣stinguished from those which are ha∣zardous, or dangerous. All which being neither difficult to remember; nor hard to be understood; and such as cannot be denyed to be both pertinent and sufficient for proof and assurance of Medicine: Admit patients and all the Ingenious every where should henceforth hold Practitioners
strictly to these Characters; accepting or refusing; accordingly: what a migh∣ty Improvement wuld it soon occa∣sion in Physick: By necessarily en∣forcing all Students and Practitioners, to set themselves to that which the Noble Hippocrates made the chief Cha∣racter of a Physician worthy Estimation Viz. By Study and his own Industry, to bring to light something that was not known before, and better known than unknown, or at least to perfect something that was imperfect before. And then as Excellencies for real use in Physick could not but every where abound; so would such a Test esta∣blished, naturally tend to the fixation of this too much uncertain Art; put a period to the many Contrarieties and Contradictions of Practitioners, be an occasion of less harm and danger, of more pertinency, certainty, and se∣curity in Cure: and abundantly more enable them to perform with Comfort
the infinite trust reposed in them, especially by their more Ingenious and Noble Patients in their extremities. These are the Marks and Chara∣cters conceived requisite for the test of Medicine; and the desirable Ad∣vantages which in good probability would ensue upon such an establish∣ment. Nor let any suppose, as some may be apt to do, (who are loath any thing should prove of weight, but what they themselves discover) that these Cha∣racters or Marks of real Medicine are but meer impracticable notions, set forth to amuse the credulous with wonders that never were nor never will be found in medicine: For silen∣cing all such slight suggestions, since such medicines are best known by their Fruits: It will be best and most pro∣per to let them speak for themselves in some of their many fold instances of Cures performed by them, in various
and dangerous cases: and are as fol∣loweth. The first of which, is of a man of middle age, afflicted with so extream a Bloody Flux as was deemed incurable, yet he perfectly recovered by two oun∣ces of a medicine, every way answer∣ing those Characters; being a pow∣erful subduer of those venoms which occasion such distempers. Another is of one about 50: who had been long ill, but being of a strong constitution, thought with help of or∣dinary means to wear it out: As the manner of many hath been, till the best comes too late; and they wear themselves into their Graves, as it was like to have proved with him; for when my advise was first desired, he was sore all over his body, light hea∣ded, spots upon his breast, very fea∣verish, and swon in his legg: other advise he had which ordered him to bleed; which he not likeing, he fell
under my Charge, and in less then eight dayes time, by the sole help of Medicines of the same nature, perfectly recovered. Another is of a Gentleman about 30. long and grievously tormented with an Ague: both hot and cold fitts; vi∣olently painful, with extream thirst, and soreness of throat; who after much time and money spent in vain, being plied with some variety of these me∣dicines, became perfectly well. In which case as the variety proved very acceptable, so proves it Generally very successful in all or most distempers. Another is of a young Gentleman, who upon an extream Cold and sore∣ness all over his body falling into a vi∣olent vomiting, and looseness; which increasing under much means of Phy∣sick, I was importun'd to take care of him; and in less than a weeks time he re∣covered, solely by the use of divers of these Medicines.
Another instance is of a Gentleman somewhat above fifty: surprised with a violent surfeit, and its worst effects, excream vomiting, headach, high feaver, and soreness every where: and which notwithstanding many consul∣tations, and thereupon bleedings, pur∣gings, vomitings, often repeated: with sundry the best reputed Julips and Cordials usuall in such cases: neverthe∣less settled into six hours cold fits, with tortures in his knees and ancles as if upon the Rack, and near upon ten houres hot fitts, his breast stuffed with tough and clammy phlegme, throat swoln and blister'd, his tongue parcht, scurft, raw and so big that he could hardly speak a word to be under∣stood. In this woful plight, his Physicians, Himself and Relations quite hopeless, hearing what had been performed by my Medicines, I was sent for: yet not without much scruple, as one that
gave chiefly Spirits and hot things: which this Gentleman said, How to one in such a flame as he was in, Spirits and hot things could be proper, he could not understand: I replied, he would soon finde there was a benigne as well as a venomous heat, that in∣deed he had too much of the one, but too little of the other; And that with∣out supplies of the better, his Lamp of Life could not be long maintained. Which yet I perceived he so slowly admitted, that I was leaving of him: but his Lady taking me aside, and asking me whether I thought there was any possibility of his recove∣ry: I told her I did believe there was: she asked me by what means, there having been so much used and failed: I said by Cordial Medicines: she said he would not endure any thing that was hot, I told her it was impossible without it: But yet such heaters as would certainly cool him: she asktme
if I had any such, I told her I would have none else, nor valued any other. Which so far prevailed that he took that Night two ounces of one of my Medicines, and so did constantly of that or some other, alwayes before his cold fit; and at the end of it, respecting his hot fitt, both which with all their painful threatning effects were after a while much mitigated, and in conclu∣sion most happily extinguished. And had been sooner but for the unfortu∣nate interposition of a gentle Purger; which because of Costivenes was prest upon him by one of his Physicians, who generally make such a doo about keeping the body solluble, as spoiles all too often. This Purge though of the middle sort, (which I must not know of at no hand) gave him upon twenty stooles, and so chearful he was upon it, that they reckoned now all filth was purged and carried out of his body: Insomuch as when I came amongst
them, all eyes were cloudy upon me; so I said little, and off I went: But before next morning the Scene was al∣tered, and I hastily sent for, his cold and hot fits being doubled both in time and extremity; And he so wea∣kened as they all feared his sudden dissolution: Bu falling to work a fresh with the same Medicines, though this mischievous loosener set us back at least ten Cordials, yet it was not longe're all was perfected, wherein our pleasant varlety proved infinitely Advantageous and Contentful. For so clear a Convert this Gentle∣man became, that though at first any thing of heat frightned him, yet so throughly reconciled to my heaters was he, that not onely all his Cordials were freely taken by him, but for one of them, (which hath heat enough in it to startle most practi∣sers) he would not be without a mo∣ment and not onely sipping of it, but
drinking of it continually night and day, so much more easie is it to con∣vince an ingenious Gentleman (with whom Reason and Experience soon pre∣vail) rather then Capricious Arts-men, whose too much self-respect, or errour in breeding sway them, one while to accuse those Medicines of deficiency because of their mildness, another while of danger because of their heat: And indeed Generally to adhere to old and mistaken Maxims. For so in this case when the Cure was almost finished, comes one, who finding by all was done he had never sweat, Rashly pronounces, Then he could not Live. And so in all hast writ a large Receipt to enforce a sweat, a Mineral therein being the main Agent depended on for producing the effect. But the Gentleman was more wary than to take it, and so contrary to his ado∣red Aphorism, recovered without once Sweating in all the time of his sickness,
and in reason may somwhat restrain the too frequent interposing of Arts∣men and atendants with their vulgar opinions: For of all who have relied upon these Medicines, none ever miscar∣ried but two: the one by the importu∣nate obtrusion of a Loosener; and the other by the unkindness of a far ab∣sent Brother which in sickness proves mortal like a venomous Damp. My next instance is of one naturally of a good Constitution, and Chearful, whose occasions inducing his too much converse with Wine, in process of time inclining to the Dropsie, and in fine swelled his belly, took away his ap∣petite, sometimes he had stoppage of his Urine, and sometimes made reddish water, under which Infirmities he re∣mained long, though he used the best counsel and Physick he could get; but in∣stead of amendment, fell into other extreames; for his flesh every way aba∣ed, his strength utterly failed, his
belly sunk and clung'd to his back, no stools but by Glisters, nor could he eat one bit of flesh-meat at any rate, nor ought else but as he forc't it down. In this sad plight he desired my assistance, and in fourteen dayes with medicines of this kind onely, his appetite and digesture were reco∣vered, his strength restored, his flesh and countenance well likeing, his belly in due state, his urine and stools naturall and he so blyth & jocund as was wonder∣ful to all that knew him, and so conti∣nued for above four months: But his occasions still misleading of him; and upon a frolick overgoing his strength he fell ill again, and then unhappily waving the means which had for∣merly helpt him, took a resolution to be his own Physician, by help of such Books as were then in repute, where∣with he tamper'd so long till he was past recovery, his Distempers being far above the reach of Book or com∣mon Medicine.
The next is of a Gentlewoman long under Physick for Distempers of the Breast, as Cough, shortness of Breath, Feaverish, extreamly wasted in body, and sunk in Spirits, hardly eating or drinking but what she vomited purged; and vomited and bled, she had been with Issues, and her head shaved, and so left hopeless, unless by Countrey air in the Spring. This being the beginning of Winter, many questions and much discourse I had from her, as whether I had ever seen any one in her distemper, or had ever cured any: Also what means I inten∣ded; seeing as able Physicians as Lon∣don yielded prevailed not: I told her 'twas not my way to speak either of my Experience or Performance, that if the party who advised her to send for me had not satisfied her therein: And withal, that I was not apt to un∣dertake, but where I had ample hopes of Cure, he was too blame. And
that I did believe and was well assured that there was both more proper and more powerful means in being, than Physicians were usually acquainted with; and by which with Gods blessing, I did not doubt to cure her, as hopeless as she was, without either purging, or vomiting, or bleeding, or issues, wishing also her Hair had been spared, as the chief comfort of so weak a Head, with this she chear'd a little. So I fell to work with my real Me∣dicines, and in few weeks time so far pre∣vailed, as that she frequently went a∣broad that Winter: nor kept she house any more on this occasion, Another Instance is of a Girle about four yeares old, that by a Feaver and Consumption, and much Roving Phy∣sick was in a hopeless condition, yet in a weeks time by these Medicines onely, perfectly recovered. A young Gentleman came to me a∣bout noon with an Ague most terribly
shaking him, to whom I immediatly gave half a Pinte of one of my Medi∣cines well heated, which was the usual way by which in the great Ague Year abundance were cured: He drank it off at two draughts, and it stayed with him, but within a quarter of an hour it made him vomit very largely, and thereupon he became instantly so well, as I would have had him dine with  but excusing himself he fell fast a sleep for two hours, and never had the least Grudgings after it; which is the more to be noted, because it's frequent with the same Medicine to stay vomi∣tings when the body any wayes stands in need thereof. A young Maiden much depressed in Spirit, and swoln in body by unkindly Obstructions, which she could finde no means to dissolve, upon the use of one of these Medicines appropriate to those distempers, perfectly recovered. A middle aged Woman, troubled
grievously with Hystericall distempers taking a good quantity of a Medicin thereto appropriate, recovered; as a∣bundance more have done, by the same and the like means: for in this, as in most other Distempers, Variety proves of very absolute advantage. Also a young Lad, lying more like a dead than a living childe; taking a small quantity of one of the Medicines for that purpose, in short time voyded Wormes and recovered, as many others also have done, who have been thought to have had Wormes though they voyded none. A young man being in a tedious Fe∣ver, and finding no relief in much Phy∣sick used to him; a friend of his sent him often small quantities of my Medi∣cines, which those with whom he was, scrupled to let him take; being told, they were too hot, and altogether unfit for him in his case, which was near unto a Pleuresie: Yet doing all they other∣wise
could, growing worse and worse, his friends urg'd him to remove to their house; which being done, weak and ill as he was, and he then plied a while with diverse of them, his Cure came on very fairly. But on a sudden was al∣most choak't with a mass of thick putrid phlegm, which yet, sipping upon a Me∣dicine peculiar thereunto, for some con∣tinuance; it so ripened, raised, and free∣ly expell'd it, (as is usual with it in all cases of phlegm) that he instantly and perfectly recovered. Another Instance is of a Gentleman, who with his Lady being in Town up∣on Law occasions in height of Summer, fell into an extreme Fever: She having had full knowledg of the recovery of some of her friends, by the use of my Medicines, when all other means prov'd fruitless; She of her self singled out one of them, which upon occasion she had used her self also; and so possest her Husband with confidence therein, that
he solely relyed thereupon, and with the expense of about three Pints of it, per∣fectly recovered: and which hath drawn their affections so towards it, that they have had often of it, and diverse others of them, for their Family occasions. Another is of One some Thirty miles from London, long tired with a violent Fever, that admitted no check by the ut∣most endeavours of a skilful Physician; but having formerly had good experi∣ence of my Medicines, withstood all denyal, and hasted a friend to me for a Pint of one of my Medicines, which he named, and a small quantity of another, and what else I would send him: So, I sent him the Pint of the first he nam'd, and six Ounces of the next, and as much of another, and three Ounces of a fourth sort; which being soon with him, al∣though many cautions were given him, in respect of their heat, he being, as was told him, scorch'd and scalded from the tip of his tongue down to his Navel; yet
being sure of what he did, he no sooner set sight of the largest Glass, but he catches it, and drinks a good sound draught of it, and so time after time, till he had taken all of them: and very much mending thereupon, sent for another Pint more of the first he had sent for, with this Commendum, That he hoped to see me suddenly: and was as good as his word. And seeing thus is their general per∣formance; helping and recovering in the extremities of thirst, and most vio∣lent Inflammations; notwithstanding their manifest heat: It were but equal, all such false-accusing and unreasonable Cautions should for ever cease, or be ne∣ver more regarded, by whomsoever ut∣tered; and that whoever henceforth urges their familiar mildness, as a note of their Insufficiency; (as our Mineral Practisers use to do) when thus they have constantly manifested their power and efficacie in most dangerous cases:
may themselves be noted of perverseness in endeavouring to affright and dehort people, from their safest and most effe∣ctual Helpers, to a dependence on what is either insufficient or hazardous. And truly some others, besides the last mentioned, in their extremities have found strength enough to break through these and the like cobweb-snares and scruples. One more especially: who, after traversing the usual course of Phy∣sick through and through; as purging, vomiting, bleeding, with Juleps upon Juleps, and Cordials upon Cordials of the best currant: and finding no a∣mendment or abatement of his most vi∣olent heat and thirst; grew importunate for some of my Medicines, even to im∣patience; which, though sparingly al∣low'd by his Physicians, and under usu∣al cautions for their heat; yet he took of them nevertheless freely and plenti∣fully; and upon a sudden became so perfectly well, as was sufficient to have
converted a hundred Scruplers. And was not wholly fruitless: For, after this Gentleman walk'd abroad, u∣sing often to visit me, as one was treat∣ing with me about my Medicines for his Friend in a high Fever; upon tasting of them, objecting their Heat, as improper in such cases: This Gentleman noting it, says to him, Sir, let no body abuse you with such doubts; for I my self being in as high a Fever, with extremity of thirst and burning like the very fire, as I verily be∣lieve could not be exceeded; yet when all other means proved vain and ineffectual, these cool'd me, quench'd my thirst, and cu∣red me. But, says the other Gentleman, You took them then very warily, and in small quantity: With that he catches a Glass which held about four ounces, says he, When I was at worst, I drank thus much at a draught, and often. But, untill men of parts, art and pra∣ctise enable themselves better to distin∣guish of Heats, and more accurately to
discern of Virtues proper to Humane na∣ture; but continue perversly to deter∣mine, that because this Medicine is as hot as Sack or White-wine, conclude it therefore as improper and dangerous to be administer'd in sickness; or, because this or that Cordial Medicine is so mild, that people in health drink them as fa∣miliarly, as Burnt Claret or brew'd White-wine; therefore, alas, what power can such have in Putrid Fevers, and Pestilential Distempers: till they blush at such unphilosophical arguings, and search deeper into the Mystery of Heats and Mildness, and take in dayly some grains of Self-denyal, they will be apt either through partiality, to speak worse of things, than they know they do deserve, or through error to speak e∣vil of things they know not: and ei∣ther way are improper Guides, ever in∣clined to mislead the distressed in their greatest extremities; and which ren∣ders this evident Test of Medicine of
real and infinite use in such doubtfull Judgings. But it fell out generally, if one said I am dry already, and these will make me more thirsty; I am obstructed, and these cannot but be binding; I sweat, and these will certainly increase it; I am subject to be disturb'd in my head, and these must needs intoxicate: It was great odds but some or other would soon assure the contrary from their own ex∣perience. All which their benign qua∣lities, and exemption from evil, they re∣ally ow unto their coherence with the true Humane Complexion: a Conce∣ption, though absolutely requisite to the Art of Health, yet, I doubt, too great a stranger to be suddenly understood, or be bid welcom among Artists, so gene∣rally prepossess'd; yet Time and a good Touchstone may make even the stoutest stoop to reason. My next Instance is, of an ingenious generous Gentleman, who by violent
exercise had so overstrained his body, that he was not able to go without much pain; after some discourse, I sent him two pints of two several Medicines, the one being to be frequently taken, and the other by two ounces every night: and by thus using them, he perfectly re∣covered. Likewise the same Gentleman, some∣time after, being sorely afflicted with the Toothach, having taken many Medi∣cines in vain, complaining to me of it, I told him, I thought he might be certain of help that night, by taking a small quantity of one of my Cordial Medi∣cines: at which he smil'd, and ask'd me, How a Cordial could help the Toothach? I said, By extinguishing the venom that caused it; and it was rather questionable, What a real Cordial Me∣dicine could not do. Nay then, says he, If you are so confident, pray let me have one. So I gave him onely two ounces of one I had good experience of,
half to be taken that night at resting time, a little warm'd in his hand; and the other part, if he needed it, after his first sleep. The first cur'd him; but for more security, he took the rest next night, and so was throughly well; nor have I ever found a more certain course in this painfull distemper, though nor always so suddenly; and then should be longer continued, with abstinence from Wine and all gross Diet, which further all Cures. And since this performance; It hath not onely done this Gentlemnan the like service; but when at any time he hath any ways been indisposed, & sometimes he hath been so feverish, that he hath thought there was no way but by bleed∣ing; yet even then two ounces of the same Medicine, or at most four ounces for twice taking, hath not failed to dis∣charge all to his full satisfaction; plain∣ly also shewing, that a kindly true huma∣niz'd Medicine, may be proper and effe∣ctual
in several Distempers. Another seeking my help, was a Gen∣tlewoman: Her Servant brings an U∣rinal, desired me to look on that Water; I told her it was not my way: She ask't me, how then I would understand the Disease? I ask't her, if she knew any that could tell whether it proceeded as it was from Man, Woman or Child: She said, she could: I told her, in that she knew more than any Physician could be sure of, let him pretend what skill he would; and that unless she had some∣what else to say, I should talk no longer with her: With that she nam'd a very worthy person, and some of her Infir∣mities, that she had been long under Physick, but yet remained in extreme weakness. Many questions I ask'd her, which she could not resolve, and so de∣sired I would give her a visit: I told her, I did not use o visit any; but if she pleas'd to send one to me that could ac∣quaint me expresly with her condition▪
I would assist her the best I could. So next morning, her Sister came to me. But instead of farther informing me how she was, she onely importun'd me to see her. I told her, I did not a∣voyd visits, because I was unwilling to attend any; but as not judging it need∣full, my experience assuring me I could perform as much upon good informati∣on, as upon sight. She seem'd to muse at it, yet would have no denyal, but I must promise to see her without delay; which I performed: and truly she was brought extreme low, look'd like death it self, and even hopeless of recovery; giving me withall so clouded a counte∣nance, as much dislik'd me. But seing me by her, she related to me the original and progress of her Distemper, how long she had been ill, what abundance of means she had used, by advise of such as she knew both able and faithful; and yet nought availed, but that she was as I saw her.
Upon which, I told her, I did believe there was yet other means and more ef∣fectual than had been used: She said, Every one spake well of their own, but she found little comfort; asking me whether I ever saw any in her condition? I told her I had never seen two persons in all respects distemper'd alike: She askt me whether I had ever cur'd any in her case, or like it? I ask't her, whether she would not be well pleased to be the first? She said, she did not like to run any ha∣zards. I told her, if she refer'd herself to me, she should run none at all; for what I intended to give her, she should, if she pleased, see me or any in our house take the like quantity of the same before her. She said, that was fair; but then how could things so familiar, work ou such a mass of rooted corruption, as she was loaded with in every part of her. I told her, I did not doubt of it, and that she should find all her distempers insen∣sibly vanish; and that by such pleasing
means, as she would never be unwilling to take. With that she smil'd, and wisht she could believe it. I told her, there lay all the difficulty; because as to that point, how far my words were to be cre∣dited, I should be silent; she must be sa∣tisfied of that some other way, and ought to have been done before I was sent for: and with that was taking my leave. But she stayd me with a Glass of Wine, and offer'd me money; which I refused, being unwilling to be so inga∣ged. So she wisht me to prepare what I thought needfull for her that night, and she would send for it, and in the morning I should hear how she was, and would take what I sent her, and observe my counsel solely. Which she did most exactly, though there wanted not who would have been busie with their gentle Purgers, as they somewhat undeservedly intitle their Loosners; which usually cleanse but as dirty beesoms, that too often make a
worse kind of filth than they avoyd, and more dangerous, even to the defilement of the Bloud and Spirits. But as hap was, I had her promise against all inter∣medlings; and in little more than a weeks time made all my words so good, (and that solely by Medicines agreeable to this Test) that she went immediately and chearfully into the countrey, taking for her Viaticum, a good quantity of a Cordial fit for the occasion. And the circumstances of this, and many of the other instances warily ob∣served; as on the one hand they manifest that generally it is far more difficult to persuade Patients of the possibility of their cure, than to cure them: so also, how apt they are both to give large cre∣dit, where they have cause enough of scruple, (as in the common road of Phy∣sick) and to distrust where there is no cause of fear at all; and this for want of some certain marks of distinction upon Medicines whereby to guide their judg∣ments,
which possibly this, or some o∣ther Touchstone may henceforth happily supply. Besides, in all my Observation of her confused complicated Distempers; I could ascribe them to nothing more, than to the variety and frequency of purgative and vomitive Medicines, she had long time been accustomed to; as be∣lieving such Distempers impossible to be otherwise removed: yea so bewitched are most people therewith, that they never think or speak of Physick or Medicine, but they intend Vomiters o Loosners, as if nothing else deserv'd the name of Physick, but such as brought them pain or torture; frequently left them in mise∣ry, or prepared for future mischief: as this Gentlewoman sadly found to her cost. But it's hopeful, time and a little consideration will produce a better un∣derstanding in matters of so great mo∣ment. Whilst this Cure was in agitation: a
Child in the countrey, very dear and nearly related to them, being extremely ill, my help was desired; I sent onely three ounces of one of my Medicines, by which it recovered. Many other particulars, worthy note, have been since performed by the like Medicines, for this worthy Family and their alliance, divers large quantities being frequently fecht for their occasi∣ons, and to their their contentful satisfaction: plainly shewing how much may be per∣formed, where there are store of such real Medicines, without the nicties of U∣ries, pulses, and such predictive curio∣sities, which too often distract both Pa∣tients and Physicians, or but rarely as∣sist them to any material indication. Another Lady▪ some miles from Lon∣don, in a most terrible Fever, and after long proceeds in the best of usual Phy∣sick, farther to seek, and more threatned with the saddest issue; being persuaded by a friend, sent for some of my Medi∣cines;
by allowance of her Doctors. I sent her six ounces of one most appro∣priate; and sending again, I sent as much of another▪ and next time, of the first the like quantity; by help of which she perfectly recovered, with very thankfull respects to her Physicians, for their so signal freedom and self-denyal in her preservation. About this time I received a Letter from a young Gentleman, a stranger to me, concluding I could certainly cure him of many distempers therein related, chiefly a violent pain in his Head and Breast, which had cost him much in Physick without any benefit. I sent him a Pinte mixt and made up of two of my Medicines, advising him to take it in e∣qual parts at four nights, which he did; and immediately after came with a great deal of joy, telling me he was perfectly well: and which occasion'd many of his friends and relations, people of qua∣lity, to apply themselves to the use of
these Medicines for sundry infirmities, speeding no worse than he had done: and some of them receiving that satisfa∣ction from them, which they could hard∣ly believe within the power of Art to have effected. Which I thus express, to shew that it is no absurdity, even for Persons of Ho∣nour to put so much trust and confi∣dence in some Students or Arts-men; as to take freely and without scruple those preparations, which they judg requisite for their recovery, though they know no part of their Ingredients, as these wor∣thy persons most readily did; deeming it no disparagement at all to be governed in such cases, wholly by an implicite Faith, as some censoriously term all trusts of this nature; whose overmuch wariness is generally punished with false stories of what is given them, or with supplies onely of vulgar insignificant Medicines, and so by being over care∣full, too frequently trifle away their
lives and money: for an Arts-man sub∣sisting by his Art, being owner of it no longer than he keeps it to himself, no∣thing can be more improper or unwelcom than to ask discovering Questions; nor would it need at all, where such a Test as this once comes to bear rule amongst the Noble or ingenious, because upon tryal every one would and might freely trust as he had occasion. Another young Gentleman was re∣commended to my care, who had wea∣ried himself out with seeking remedy for a long settled pain within the uppermost part of his breast, and sharp painfull Rheums in his head, with a cough, and an Hectick Fever. The first I gave him was onely four ounces of so fortunate a Medicine, for two nights, as quite took away the pain of his breast; after which applying himself to some others of them his Constitution became so renewed and fixed, that I believe in maintenance of their innocencie and efficacie, he would
not fear to enter the Lists with the most captious or capricious Artist; nor in the most contageous Time or most vio∣lent Distemper, would be drawn to de∣pend on any other, either Preservatives or Remedies. Another instance is of a Gentleman of worth and judgment; whose Lady, newly delivered, and her child dying, fell into a feverish sadness. He wrote to me her condition, with this also, that he knew nothing so fit for her, as some of my Medicines, desiring I would send such as I thought good: so I sent one∣ly four ounces of the most appropriate, which she took, and after that, sent for the like quantity of the same, and once more for the like also, with which she became perfectly well; and if this ten∣der case do not sufficiently prove their heat to be innocent, and their mildness to be accompanied with power, it must be sure with those with whom reason is of no validity.
One whose children had often been recovered by my Medicines, came hasti∣ly upon me from a friend of his, whose young Daughter of about Fourteen, was as he said, in a very hopeless condition, earnestly desiring me to go and see her. I askt him, how long she had been ill? He told me, a long time, and the best ad∣vice and means used, but all in vain. I told him, I had declined the usual way of practise, and visited none, nor was willing to meddle where others had the care. He said, her father had lately bu∣ried two very hopeful children, and so much feared this, that he was resolved she should take no more of them; and so much importun'd me, that I went with him; finding her quite wasted and al∣most breathless, and in a very high fe∣ver; I spake chearfully to her, & raised some hopes in her and her sad friends, wishing them to send to me within two hours: So I sent her three ounces of an appropriate pleasant Medicine to take
two spoonfulls every three hours, and to send for more when it was spent. She took it with delight, and so with the use onely of this, continued for about Eight days, she went well abroad, and kept within no more through any infir∣mity. One whose child I had formerly cu∣red, passing by, seemed full of care, and being gone a little, returned suddenly, and told me her child that I once recove∣red, was dangerously ill, and that she had been with a Physician, an old friend of hers, who ordered her to be bled, and ask't what I thought of it; I told her, 'twas improper for me to meddle in an∣others business, yet that it would be fit before the child was bled, being not a∣bove five years old, to advise with some others; and ask't her, if he had directed any thing else? with that she shewed a Glass with about three ounces of a very ordinary weak Julep, which after I had tasted, I gave to a Gentlemen of skill and
learning, desiring his judgment of it in so dangerous a fever: and he saying it was very mean, she ask'd me if I could give her any thing more effectual, and spare her bleeding; I said, I thought I could; and filling a Glass of about two ounces, gave to her and the Gentleman to tast; and he saying it was full of life, she hasted away with it, and gave it to the child, by which she recovered per∣fectly without bleeding; which may possibly excuse this irregularity. Another instance is of a young Mer∣chant, somewhat consumptive, exceed∣ingly troubled with continual pains in his head, who after long toyling under Physick, desired my advice, but withall said, he was inclined to the use of that a Friend of his had received much good by, and it being very proper for him, he took with him a large quantity, and lives very comfortably in the frequent use of it, resolving where ere he is, not to be without it, or some other of its neigh∣bour-Medicines.
Another young Gentleman, who had contracted a very ill habit of body, by being so surpriz'd with Snow in the night, that he was almost frozen to death; yet in time somewhat growing it out, settled in London. Where he re∣mained very uncomfortably, full of pains and weakness, which he endeavou∣red to remove by all the means of Phy∣sick he possibly could imagine, but in∣stead of prevailing, growing worse and worse, he came to me, desiring my help whatever it should cost. He had conti∣nual pains in his head, with want of sto∣mach, soreness all over his body, a most heavy dullness and indisposition to his occasions, took joy in nothing, as was too easily discernable by the sad aspect of an ingenuous countenance. I gave him a Pint of a very general Medicine, which he was to take by little and little in a weeks time, holding it always a good while in his mouth before he swal∣lowed it; which he carefully observed,
and fetcht another Pint; and so by three or four Pints became perfectly well; & occasioned divers of his friends to make use both of this and others: and often∣times upon sudden illness made use of them himself, to his constant satisfa∣ction. Another instance of their benign qua∣lities, agreeing with this Test, is of one near Fifty, who very much pleasing him self on all occasions with small Mineral Pills, mightily cry'd up for all manner of virtues: upon an extreme Cold ta∣ken falling into a Surfet, with a violent Fever, vehement thirst, and tedious fits; advised with the Author of those Pills, who ordered him to take a certain num∣ber of them, which working both ways with him▪ and yet worse upon it; sent again, and was ordered more; but being still worse, he sent again, and was still ordered to take more; which he not liking to do, sent his Wife to me, his condition then being very dangerous:
who relating to me all I have exprest, I told her, He who first had him in hand, ought to amend his errour; and that it could not seem meet for any other to meddle; none knowing so wel as he, what he had given; and that if things never so safe should be prescribed, and the event succeeded not to his recovery, the blame might be laid nevertheless upon it; and so advised her to return to him: She said, He would give no other but those Pills, and she was sure her Husband would take no more of them; earnestly desiring me to send him somewhat. I told her, I would send him nothing but what should be as safe as breast-milk for children; but it shuld be she, and not I, that should undergo the issue. So I gave her a Pint of an appropriate Medi∣cine, which he took by two, three and four ounces at a time: and so with the use of two Pints more, perfectly reco∣vered, thankfully acknowledging its wonderfull effects, especially in quench∣ing
his thirst, which he thought impos∣sible; by a Medicine so apparently hot: But sayes he I perceive now it is but an abuse to bid beware of their Heat (some or other having been busie with their cautions) for it coold me and quencht my thirst, and extinguish my Feaver, in the most contentfull manner imagina∣ble. Another Instance, Is of a Gentleman of middle age, who upon Heats and Colds, much intention of business and neglect of usual Dyt, fell into an irk∣some frequent provocation to Stool; but with utmost striving voyded no∣thing, desiring my advise I gave him o∣ver night three ounces of a General Me∣dicine; for which next day he gave me hearty thanks, his body then working naturally and sufficiently: Though this Medicine, I believe was never exceeded in staying of Loosnesses, which shews it to be of the true Humane strain and virtue.
The same Gentleman long before this upon every Cold taken falling into a dangerous Quinsie, and stil thereupon bled in the Tongue and in the Arm; with the general course of Physick usu∣al in such cases: and every time more and more threatning; I at length told him this way could not but so impair his na∣ture, that at length it would fail him and leav him in the lurch when he stood most in need of help, & withal that by a good and real Medicine this flattering way of bleeding might be prevented: So next time he took my counsil, and by four ounces of an appropriate Medicince ta∣ken for two nights; it discharged the Quinsie and prevented bleeding and all other inconveniences, and was never since troubled after that manner. The same person at another time, so Heart-sick and Feaverish, that he thought it impossible to escape a dange∣rous fit of Sickness: by one three oun∣ces of a Generall Medicine, instantly and perfectly recovered.
Also this Gentlemans Wife ha∣ving had many fits of Sicknesses, and some very threatning and dangerous; besides her Breeding times, times of La∣bor and Lyings In, depending general∣ly upon these Medicines never failed of her desired help: nor ever used other as upon importunity, sometime she hath done, but she repented it; as she hath often sadly acknowledged: Being now fixed to their use past all removing; her Children have often recovered also di∣vers dangerous distempers and fits of Sicknesses: And her Mother although far in years and ful of infirmities, occasi∣oned originally from unhappy advice to bleed in her youth; and also by prescrip∣tion of Mineral Vomits, yet by the constant use of these, though in somwhat scanty quantities, hath been preserved beyond all expectation, maintaining a pregnancy and cheerfulness hardly to be found in younger and stronger people; so exceedingly doe they oppose the im∣presses of Age and Sickness.
Another instance, Is of a young Gentlewoman, who after a long journey into the Country and different Diet, up∣on her return to London, upon drinking Milk and over eating Summer Fruit took a Surfit with an high Fever, ac∣companied with vomiting, soreness of Throat, tedious empty coughing, which brought her so extream low, as was thought impossible for her to escape; yet continually taking plentifully of di∣vers of these Medicines, and no other (though much urged) she at length be∣yond all hope recovered. Which plenteous taking is the more to be noted; because therein, in difficult Cases, chiefly rests the efficacy, and without which people do but Flatrer themselves with vain hopes of wonders from smal matters and little charges; a humor which hath cost many there pur∣ses, and too many their lives, to be rid of painfull dangerous distempers con∣tracted by their boldness with cheap
Physick, which ever and anon are ob∣truded upon the over easie and credulous who rather then their lives would faine be cured by miracle, that is for nothing. Besides I have observed some gross a∣buse, these reall Medicines have suffered by the crafty unfairness of some practi∣tioners, who when after long endevours in their usuall way of purging, vomit∣ting bleeding, &c. And their Patients as quite tired growing importunate for some of my Medicines, they have usual∣ly given way for a smal quantity; and then nothing the smal effects of things so much talkt of, turn to their patients and relations, telling them they may see they are but as other things, sometimes prevailing and sometimes no; and so at once disparaging the Medicines, and clear their readines to allow of any thing for their recovery: an unbeseem∣ing subtilty I found more frequently than is imaginable, and from some, who carry it very smoothly: of which one
instance may be needfull. Being cal'd in all haste to speak with one, A maid attending told me her Mi∣stress who lay very ill desired something to stay her vomiting, for she could not retain any thing she took, I askt where she dwelt, and perceived her to be one, who had been well acquainted with my way, a young daughter of hers having been cured by my Medicines: I askt what Physitians she had, and divers were named, I askt whether she came with their allowance, she said she did, at which, as I wondred, so I apprehend∣ed all hope was over, and scrupled send∣ing any; but the maid would have no denial; so although I saw it would be to no purpose but to undervalue my Medi∣cines, yet out of my respects to the Fa∣mily, and their want should not be im∣puted to obstinacy in me, I sent two ounces of a Medicine, that taken in due time had stayed many such distempers, advising more should be sent for as there
was occasion: But as I feared it was but a little time after that I saw all her rela∣tions in Black. All which I have thus particularly exprest, That henceforth it may be se∣riously minded, how absolutely necessa∣ry it is, upon every occasion their aid is deemed requisite not to defer their use too long, nor to give over too soon, nor to scruple to take them in full quantity; and in so doing none need to doubt a comfortable issue: nor are the ingenious to blame me if hereafter I withstand all such insignificant tamperings, possibly to palliate the mischievous error of a Mine∣ral, with which the wariest are frequent∣ly too bold, to the irrevocable detri∣ment of bewailing patients and ther re∣lations. My next instance of their innocency & efficacy, Is of a young Gentlewoman, halfe gone of her first Childe, who be∣ing a while in the Country, under far different accommodations than what her
abode in the City plentifully afforded, with some unusual stirring in business, soon after her return, fell into a dange∣rous Fever, with vomiting, bleeding at Nostril, startings and extream pains in her back: her husband finding the di∣stemper violent and threatning, advised with her Friends, and sent for such Phy∣sitians as they liked, who for divers weeks dayly visited, and administred to her with all possible care and tenderness even till every of them were hopeless of her recovery; her distempers not only proving obstinate against all means they could imagine, there being no spare of cost; but ran hourly into higher degrees of danger, upon which her husband la∣menting her condition to me, I told him I feared he would find her distem∣per far above the reach and controul of the usual Physick, which he at length found too true, in that after all they could doe, her inflammation heightned into distraction & perpetual restlesness,
took nothing but vomited as soon as taken, painfull and tedious fits every night, wasted to a very Skellion, meer skin and bone, nay so ruffe and shrivel∣led, as seemed more like Fagot-sticks, & under intollerable thirst; So as nothing but inevitable Death was hourly expe∣cted, in this her wofull plight her hus∣band full of griefe and fear desires my assistance, I told him so long as there was life there was some hope, and that possi∣bly there might be yet means for help, whereto I should be most ready were it not that she was in others hands, he said all was at an end, & none could blame ei∣ther him or me justly, however he would bear it all, earnestly pressing me to do my utmost: whereupon I gave him som∣what above two ounces of a general Me∣dicine, which that very night gave cause of hope, and so plying her both day and night with variety, and large quantities of these real Medicines for a long time by degrees her fits abated her thirst cea∣sed,
her rest and appetite returned, her vomiting left; and after a while her flesh and strength was restored to a good con∣dition: and in conclusion most happily and perfectly recovered, her Childe also born alive and without blemish, to the abashment of divers her Friends and Vi∣sitants; who usually threatned she would undoe her self by such hot Medicines, and bring a raw and scalded Childe into the world: but indeed how could they well do less hearing continually as they do the wary cautions of the learned a∣gainst the use of hot things in such cases but sure there are hopes, such in∣stances as are here plentifully discove∣red will in time incline them better to distinguish of Heats; for during the whole time of her taking them, there was not the least ill effect to be charged upon; them though upon some acciden∣tal relapses she took in a short space a pint and a halfe of one of them: every bene∣fit of nature also being constantly pro∣cured
and injoyed as freely and orderly as could be wished: So that both she and her husband recived so great an assurance of their innocency notwithstanding their hear, and of their efficacy and po∣wer, for all their mildness & pleasantness That under God, they have both for themselves, their children and Family, solely depended on them ever since, are never without good quantities of them alwayes in readiness: and have time af∣ter time told me so many remarkable sto∣ries of their happy performances, that were I torecite them; in likelyhood they equall halfe my Instances which shewes how proper and beneficial this kinde of Physick would prove for Fa∣milies. Nor did he deem them deer (which some having nothing else to say, are wont to object to withhold and restrain their use) his first course of Physick un∣der which she was not recovered, cost∣ing him three times more than this that
restored her to her health. But if this seems not cheap enough, what will they say to this which fol∣lows; for one who was very sensible of this cure and the means thereof a while after falling into a most violent Feaver, and into the hands of the most eminent Physitians; who yet doing all they could prevailed nothing: and he in his extre∣mities calling often for some of my Me∣dicines, either not understood or not heeded: at length when every one thought him past all hope, and in Con∣vulsive strugglings of Death; as himself after told me, those very motions; which those who stood by him deemed no o∣ther, but the immediate preface to his Death proceeded solely from a strong perswasion in his Dream, that he was drinking full quantities of my Medicines for they told him that he often cagerly lifted both his hands up to his mouth, and down again; and so up and down til he fell fast asleep, and waked in a well
composed condition, which hourly im∣proved to his compleat recovery: and I think he owes my Studies at least a great good turn for it: or who will not say this Cure was too too cheap in Consci∣ence. My next Instance is, of a Gentlewo∣man, who upon many occasions of di∣stemper had continually found help by my Medicines; but being neer to other Assistance and much out of order; took something that brought such unusuall pains and shootings about her, that she knew not what to think of her self, in∣deed very like to the occult remains of Mineral Medicines: and soon after fell into a violent Loosness with extreme Gripings: So upon a sudden I was sent to, and I sent her a quarter of a pint of an appropriate Medicine not used to fail in such Cases, which being all taken a little warm, perfectly recovered her. But the last cure ended not so; for within two dayes after, the Husband of
that Gentlewoman came hastily to me, sadly lamenting an elderly Friend of his who lay in a very hopeless condition, by occasion only of a Cold at first, tur∣ned to a Sufit and Fever, which under his Physitians hands increased upon him and being bound in his body, they gave him various loosning or purging Medi∣cines: but yet do what they could nothing prevailed, but set him into extreme vo¦miting, which what with the fears of his Physitians and his own, very much aggravated his misery: They excusing the not working of their Loosners, by a Rupture the Patient had had for twelve yeers, saying, his Gutts were twisted, and rendered it impossible to move his body downward; so strongly confdnt are they in uncertainties notwithstand∣ing their exact curiotsiy in Anotamy, in Circulation, Sanguification, Fermen∣tation and hilification; by which they would seem to take their aim so right as not to miss a Hairs breadth of a Disease.
I told him, he might too easily per∣ceive there was smal hope of life; and the rather, because he was loaded with so many Laxative Medicines, which confounded nature and occasioned those perpetual provocations to Vomiting; but that withall▪ I did not believe his Guts were twisted; or that it was im∣possible to move his Body downward, if it were fairly attempted by some kind∣ly and powerfull friend to Nature, not loosning; but such as by its benign quality would perform what the Body most needed: He said it seemed strange the Body in such a Case should be mov∣ed downward without a purging Medi∣cine, being so extremely obstructed as his was: yet what I thought fit, he knew he could perswade him to take: I told him, that he might plainly discern the truth of what I said (there being indeed nothing more proper) I would send him the very same Medicine to loosen his friends body, which I had given to his
Wife to stay her loosnesse, and which he knew had cured her: So he took with him halfe a pint of the same, to be given by four spoonfulls every hour, till it was spent: after the third taking he Vomi∣ted a little; and after the fourth his bo∣dy workt downward very effectually, which put him into so much hope, that he rested wel that night: But next day altered again, more I believe through the venomous nature of the Laxatives by which his Spirits were perplext and wa∣sted, than through the distemper it self; Besides he was far in years and weakned by his rupture: yet nezt evening he sent for half a pint more of the same: But liv∣ed not to take any or very little of it: yet was exceeding thankful to his Friend for performing so much as he did for him, seeming to believe the same means ta∣ken in time, was likely to have cured him: And though it did not; yet may well stand as a real Medicine: ad agree∣able to this Touchstone, in its main and
most probationary Character. Nor did this thus end neither; For this Sick mans Sonnes Wife a young Gentlewoman in the House; having been long ill with a continual Weak∣ness and Sicknesse at Stomack; observ∣ing the kindly operation of this Medi∣cine, resolved to take the remainder her self: and by degrees took all; but blam'd her self exceedingly soon after; because for about a weeks time, she frequently vomitted, and feared she should be worse upon it: but her fear proved all her harm her vomitting not only soon ceasing; but all her other pains and sicknesses, with much joy and thanks to her friend who made her acquainted with it: And this effect I think, if any thing were wanting compleats the Character: and shewes also, how beneficiall it is to use Medicines of so general and safe a na∣ture, that never decay, nor so much as a spoonfull over-case away. Another Instance is, Of a Gentlewo∣man,
who being with one that for some spice of Scurvy and Dropsie, was taking a Vomit; she also upon smal perswasion took the same quantity; which so altered the state of her Stomack, that long time after she was frequently molested with extream pains & sickness; which cost her some Doses of my Medicines by starts for case; but not followed: but one fit at last she had above the rest, that she thought a Preface to her Death; yet ta∣king upon four ounces of Appropriate Medicine in lesse than a quarter of an hours time perfectly cured her: which with the many other benefits she receiv∣ed from my Medicines, before and since in the Sicknesse time; and other occasi∣ons hath wrought so effectually upon her estimation, that she perswades all her friends and acquaintance to depend sole∣ly upon them. A Gentleman in an high Fever, and violent tooth-ake; taking two ounces of an appropriate Medicine, in one night
it drive out a large swelling under his Ear: which next night upon the like quantity of another, was very much asswaged, and next night after the like quantity of a third, quite discharged and perfectly cured him. A middle aged man taken suddenly with pains, and giddinesse like as the en∣trance of the Pestilence, taking instantly four ounces of an appropriate Medicine; immediately recovered. Another smitten into a most violent Feaver withall imaginable signs of the Sickness: yet plyed continually day and night with variety and large quantities of these Medicines, recovered without any swelling. Another extreamly pensive with thought of the Sickness, and hasting out of town: feeling many signs of its ap∣proch, taking with him good quanti∣ties of these Medicines and using of them plentifully, escaped the Infection. And the same Gentleman since; upon
such violent fits of distemper: as he thought could not possibly end, but ei∣ther with death, sickness and tedious course of Physick; yet through Gods goodness hath never failed of help and recovery somtimes by one, and some∣times by variety of these Medicines: and which he acknowledgeth to have done him singular service in his journies and at the Bath; where for want of such kindly helpers, depending upon what improper: Its to be feared many fail to the dishonor of those excellent Waters. Another instance is of a Gentleman, who recovering his lost Appetite, by the frequent use of divers of my Medicines; having been long troubled with the Gout, which generally afflicting him in a part of his foot, was now flown into the upper back part of his shoulder, with such painfulness as was intollera∣ble, I perswaded him to take a full quan∣tity, or dose of an appropriate Medi∣cine, being neer upon four ounces,
which suddenly sickned him extreamly, and inclined him to lye down upon a bed, where instantly he fell into a sound sleep for at least two hours: and wak' heartily well and cheerful free from all touch of pain or sickness: And this from no sleepy or stupifying quality in the Medicine; for I as carefully shun all enforcers of rest; by Opium under any form, or under any correction, as I doe the use of Minerals; as weakners of the Nerves and distroyers of the animal Spirits. Another Instance is, Of one who sad∣ly complained he was sore all over his body, hardly able to stir, giddy headed, had no appetite, but such a nasty taste up∣on his pallate, and in his stomack as was extream loathsome: It was not a time of Pestilence, though these signs signified little lesse: I asked him what he used to doe when he was sick, he said his wife used to make him a Carduus Pos∣set, I bid him get one instantly and drink
well of it: but an hour after bethinking my self how dangerously ill he was, and that if that night were trifled away, all help might come too late, I went to him and found him sitting by his fire very sadly; having taken nothing nor any thing providing for him: so I gave him about three ounces of an appropriate Medicine, with which he rested well all that night: and next morning standing at his dore I askt him how twas with him, he said never better; but that he had now a great swelling behind his ear; I was glad I had done as I did: he would have had somewhat to ripen it, but I would not, and it went down of it self. Another being extream ill, wholly neglected all means; but at length desi∣red me to give him somthing, which I did: but being not presently well, grew humorous and would take nothing but cold water; by which he brought him∣self into a most violent Fever, with thirst, flegm, vomitting, and restlesness,
and soon after so wild, as he was fain to be held in his bed: all which time I caused those about him to ply him day and night, with plenty and divers of my Medicines, which yet prevailed so slow∣ly: that somewhat else was prescribed him by one who said he had all the signs of death upon him: but twas not given him, so for one whole night he had no reliefe by Medicine at all: which I no sooner heard, but I presently sent him such as were proper; as deeming it unreasonable to desist so long as there is life, having found it alwaies good, still to hope the best, and to use the utmost means▪ by which divers have recovered that were thought impossible; as this almost dy∣ing man did, to the wonder of all his friends, who during his cure, were much troubled because of his long co∣stivenesse; but I quicted them, by tel∣ling the danger of moving his body till the venome of the disease was wholly subdued, and that in due time they
would see nature so enabled by these Medicines as freely and without force it would perform that and all other needfull offices; which came to passe to their full satisfaction: but had he been attended (as too many) with such as will be asking continually, what do ye think of him; if you think he cannot escape, pray deal plainly, that we may not spend more money to no purpose; a course as destructive as vile and hatefull: and had it been so here, he had certainly dyed for it; for there was no hope but in a constant perseverance. And now I think it cannot with any colour of reason be denied, but that the Instances recited, do fully amount in their performances to what is afore pro∣posed to be the proper effects of real Me∣dicines, and in every respect to answer those Characters, which I have here e∣stablished for a Standard, Test or Touch∣stone, to try and prove, whether Medi∣cines are such or not, as may rationally
be relyed on in cases of extremity: and may as I conceive suffice to witness, both the substantiality of those Chara∣cters, and that there are such Medicines really in being: Testifying also that my conceptions of Mans true Original and of his true Complexion: unto which I have bowed all my Studies & Producti∣ons, have in no wise misled me; but so ef∣fectually governed and steered my endea∣vors as to render them far beyond the u∣sual success of first discoverers; and much more true, usefull and certain than other Physiology. And as to their extent in Cure, I have frequently and impartially compared the real Virtues and properties of these real Medicines, with all the curable Dis∣cases (the Foul excepted, with which I never meddle) mentioned in the largest Bills of Mortallity, with Captain Grants ingenious Comment thereupon: I have considered seriously of them in particu∣lar: and upon the whole can see no rea∣son
to doubt; but that taken in time with due perseverance in their use, whe∣ther for prevention or for cure; they are likely to prove far more pertinent, safe and effectual, than any Helpers, Preser∣vatives or Medicines; all their marks and performances considered, than ever yet were tendered to human assistance; and this even in the Pestilence it selfe, for though I staid not in London past the increase of two Thousand a Week; but was forced away or must be cruel where all obligations of tenderness lay upon me: yet took I care tha nothing of mine should be wanting to any, who desired to make use of them; with some liberty of freely helping the necessitous: besides I had long declined Practice, visited none, nor had then so much as one Pa∣tient under my Hand: and withall had so published the Vertues and Uses of all my Medicines; as sufficed both to en∣courage and to instruct every one so plainly, as without further direction or
attendance, every one might be in a ca∣pacity of helping themselves and their relations upon any occasion: for so I judged it most proper, both for the good of Patients and Physitians; and possibly would soon so appear to Magistrates al∣so in such Infectious and dangerous times, were they accustomed to note the happy union of Safety and Power con∣joyned in one and the same Medicine: or would strictly hold Physitians and Pra∣ctisers to such Marks and Characters of real Medicines, as would witness them to be such as might justly be depended on in that violent distemper: because being such all people might without danger confidently and freely make use of them in all states and degrees of the distem∣per, without any attendance or danger to Physitians; it being true and power∣ful Medicines, that is solely to be regar∣ded in all contagious Distempers: And it was no smal quantity, I provided for the occasion, from my observation of a
general taint in Nature for some consi∣derable time before; so there was no want of what I could furnish; at least for a season, But yet, though I had great assu∣rance, both of the propriety and effica∣cy of my Preservatives and Remedies, as whoever well weigh the instances precedent, may well believe I had good cause: yet observing how from all quar∣ters, Medicines were loudly voiced out, as most certain in the case.—I could not at any hand bring my mind to any fresh publication, least I might possibly draw people from what was more, to what was less effectual, for more could not be ex∣prest for prevalence, then was of every of them; how they answered it in per∣formance: after I had tasted and noted divers of them, I soon saw cause to greive and fear, seeing so weak pro∣vision against so powerful an Adver∣sary. Besides to publsh then a esh, when
in reason I done enough before, and was dayly to be seen; seemed so like raising a new Mart for sale, for trade, and mon, as became not the sadness of the Season, requiring rather a giving than a receiving hand, and wherein very ma∣ny to their eternal praise abounded. But although the help I left proved more faithful, then skilful, disposing of much, and taking but little accompt of the success; yet it amounts to thus much that divers under God imputed their exemption from the Infection unto them: and divers their cure wholly to their use without farther help or atten∣dance: and this too in as dangerous a state of the disease as could possibly be; the okens only excepted, in which I doe not know they were ever proved, though I am not wholly without per∣swasion, even in that dismal case, were they taken in large quantity. And I have somewhat wondered that one, who practiced much with them
long before; and from the begin∣ning to the ending of that sad Mortalli∣ty, that was visited; sometimes by fifty in a morning, and visited the sick all day after, and most part of the night; and reckons never were any Medicines like them for certainty, that at thrice taking of them, they never failed of cure, in so much as they seemed almost mira∣culous, and upon their taste, were highly approved by the Master of the Pest-house; yet gives he no account of any attempt made by him upon the Tokens, unless upon a woman, whom he saies, being speechless, and her hus∣band urging him to procure him but a few words from her; by a quantity forced upon her, he so far prevailed, that she did speak to him to his satisfacti∣on, but no more: And this being true, what timely taken, and continued at d distance in full quantity, gives much cause of hope; but I heartily wish there may never more be such occasion.
But for their effecacy in preserving from the infection, or expelling the vennom as soon as taken, and their pre∣valence in cure; I shall give for each an instance. And the first, please to take in the ex∣press of a Letter from London, from one who returning thither, had furnished himself with divers of my Medicines, as fearing the worst; and at the place of my abode, thus saluted me. Sir, Next to Divine goodness, I deem my self bound to return you my hearty thanks for my present health, which had been much indangered but for your Crdials; for what through change of A, Diet and Lodging, with some what  then usual bsselling in business, I found my selfe much out of tune, but could not say I was ill until the last Tuesday night: but then after the whole daies Indisposition, I was taken with a most violent pain in my head, and with not much lesse in my stomack, That I
feared it could not end but with a sick∣nesse, if not the Sicknesse: and the more because that Medicine of your which at other times was ever pleasant to my taste; was now so loathsome that I could hardly bring my selfe to take it: but confidering my necessity I forced down two ounces, which hardly stayed with me, nor did I hold it full halfe an hour; for then after much strugling in me it gave me a large vomit, immediat∣ly after which not finding my selfe so well as I hoped, though much relieved, I called fo my Glasse, and took two ounces more: soon after which I fell to rest, sleeping quietly all the night, and waked in the morning as if I had not been ill at all, and so remained ever since for which I blesse God and freely ac∣knowledge my selfe your debtor. Then for their prevalence in Cure, Being in the Country where I wrought and furnished my selfe with requisites for any occasion: and frequently sup∣plyed
those I left in London, with what was much wanted: not thinking of any Practice, but only for our own Family: By a Letter from a Stranger seaven miles off, I was thus treated, Sir by my good Friend Mr.—I understand you have a Soverain Water for the Plague: He told me a Gentlewoman gave him part of a Glasse, whose Husband refused to take of it and died: but she and her two Maids took it and lived, wherefore I would desire you to send me a pint of it, for I fear my Servant dyed of it on Mun∣day last: I knew by the money he sent what he intended, which I sent with a taste of another, his Wife and another Servant fell ill immediatly both having Risings: he sent for more, and often and had also of other sorts, for he spared for no cost: and the issue was, that his ser∣vant after a while recovered without breaking: but his wifes grew very large and was long in ripening, but at length it brake very kindly, and she suddenly
thereupon perfectly recovered: he told his friend also he believed, he himself was three times infected, but then taking larger quantities than ordinary; he soon sensibly perceived the venom to be sub∣dued, and deemed himself happy in hav∣ing them. Then for quick dispatch in other dan∣gerous case, where in the Mineralists will still presume preheminence, openly pro∣fessing that without Antimony & Quick∣silver, the Armory of Physick would be left despicably poor and indigent: whilst to me they seem more the Parents of Diseases than of Cures; and those dan∣gerous and long lasting even from gene∣ration to generation in Families: but whereas there are preparations of these critical ingredients said to be as safe as the most innocent Cordials: for assurance the prescribers will not scruple the trial of this Touchstone. But for quick despatch in cure, besides what the former Instances afford, I think indeed more than sufficient,
cured as speedily and with far more cer∣tainty and security: yet for an over-plus, take therewith these as an over-plus. One of which is, Of a young Man in my Country neighbor hood, weekly for halfe a yeer, after a dangerous sick∣nesse: in dead of Winter fell into a violent loosnesse, which infeebled him exceedingly and at three weeks end, ran into the bloody Flux with extreme griping, thirst, and utter lsse of appe∣tite, working day and night and depri∣ving him of all rest: about ten in the morning my help was desired by his mo∣ther; so I ordered him six ounces of an appropriate Medicine to be taken a little warm in four equal parts at each an hours distance: and at five in the afternoon to let me know how he was, during all which time he had no motion to stool, nor any desire to drink: yet then I order∣ed him two ounces of another to be ta∣ken last that night; with which and no other, he became so well that next day
he went abroad about his occasions, troubled neither with gripes, loosness nor thirst, nor want of appetite, but so hungry that he refused nothing. Another is of a Lad about thirteen, who from a fierce Ague, fell into so vio∣lent a Fever, that he became frantick, rising in the night in a mighty in flamma∣tion and crying out fire, fire, that the house was on fire, and sought a place to get out at: I ordered him four ounces of of an appropriate Medicine, the one half to be instantly given and the other four hours after, except there were manifest signs of amendment: and if so to reserve it for next night; the first settled him, and next night he had the rest: after which they gave me no accompt, but reckoned him well; because he went a∣broad and complained not: but hear∣ing that he rested not well, nor came to his stomach as those use who recover up∣on these Medicines I wondered I was not sent to; but at last his mother perceiving
he was not like to grow it out, she came and I gave her two ounces of another of the Medicines sutable to his present state; with which he recovered. Two Children also, past all hope, recovered by each four ounces of an appropriate Medicine, given by little and little. And another of whose life the Pa∣rents despaired: by four ounces of these Medicines recovered also. A young youth taken with a violent Ague and Feaver, and light∣headed, recovered by six ounces of one of the Medicines. A Gentleman about fourty, some∣what out of order, was perswaded by his friend to take such a remedy, as he used to take himself, which putting his body into a strange confusion, with purging and vomiting, forced him to require other aid from Physitians, who although they somewhat allayed the distemper; yet he remained extreamly
depressed and sinking in his Spirits, which continued upon him with fre∣quent and irresistable sighings; where∣upon applying himself to the use of these reviving Medicines, in few dayes time, was enabled with cheerfulness to walk abroad, and pursue his af∣faires. A Child not full a year and half old, through large and cold eating, falling in∣a Surfet and Feaver, with thirst, vomi∣ting, loosness, gripings and cough; the Parents upon good knowledge, depending solely upon these Medicines, with variety and good quantity, perfect∣ly recovered the Child, when it was thought impossible, and without any inconvenience following, though she took at least two quarts of them, in no very long time. A Gentlewoman, who from a health∣ful Constitution, and good Appetite; through Cold and Surfet, falling into a Feaver, with continual Head-ach,
Restlesness, loss of Appetite, obstinate Obstructions, with extream Melan∣cholly, and ever upon sinking for want of breath: by constant use of divers of these Medicines for a season, perfect∣ly recovered. A young Gentlewoman big of her first Child, afflicted with so violent, and so perpetual a Cough, that it was thought impossible but she must miscar∣ry; taking every time she cought of one of the Medicines appropriate to the Infirmity, to the quantity of a pint in one night, besides what she took the day before, quit her self clearly of her distemper, without any the least evil ensuing. A young Gentlewoman, upon the least taking cold, or error in dyet, fal∣ling into extream pains and feavo∣rishness that put her in strong Con∣vulsivemotions; upon taking for two or three dayes and nights some plenty of divers of these Medicines,
hath ever most wonderfully reco∣vered. A Gentleman, through much sitting and writing, falling into a weakness of the brain and lightness, that he conti∣nually inclin'd to fall as he went about the streets: by constant use of an ap∣propriate Medicine, carried alwaies a∣bout him, and sipping of it in small quantity: perfectly recovered, as divers others have likewise done by the same means. One in her lying in, extreamly troubled with after pains; by taking onely two ounces of a general Me∣dicine, found instant and great re∣liefe. A Gentleman subject to a Cough, upon an extream cold and overstraining, his body; his Cough not onely increa∣sed, but a most violent pain in his side ensued, which so tormented him every time he cought, that tore him as it were in peices, yet in some four dayes,
using plenty of these Medicines, he was restored to his usual Cond∣tion. A young Lad languishing under ex∣tream weakness, and wasted almost to nothing, by a pint of one of these Medicines proper in Consumptions re∣covered perfectly. A Gentlewoman swoln most ex∣treamly with a Dropsie, using much counsel and means for reliefe, found none like what she had by the use of one of these Medicines, appropriate to this distemper; and when she was so hugely big, that the Physitians re∣solved, there was no way but by drawing the water which so swelled her, out with their usual Manual ope∣ration, she refusing and casting her self wholy upon God, in the use of this Medicine after a short time, the water arise and drain'd it self out of her mouth dayly in large quantity, till she recovered her ordinary health and due proportion.
A Gentleman who had quite lost his appetite, by the use of one of these Medicines, last at night, and first in the morning, perfectly recovered. His wife lying In, and in a violent restless Feaver, by a pint of another of these Medicines perfectly recover∣ed. And his next neighbours, being all down with sickness, and one of them dying, fearing it to be the sickness, he ac∣quainted them with these Medicines; and with the use of two pints they all recovered. A Gentleman about the age of forty, but newly recovered of a Pluretick di∣stemper, upon an extream Cold fell into a violent Feaver, which after some means and time ended in an Ague, which tormented him for divers fits both cold and hot, every other day three or four fits, were trifled away with slight Medicines, which unadvised im∣portunities thrust him upon; at length,
I undertaking him, in his first cold fit gave him in three hours time, a full pint of so high and powerful a Medicine; as would have amazed any Physitian, which yet without any prejudice, by burning or binding, or over-sweating him, broke the heart of his Ague, and so by plying him on his well dayes and nights, sometimes with the same in smaller quantity, and with others of like nature, at the fourth fit it was quite discharged; wherein were full experi∣ences of their restraining violent sweats and thirst, and in giving of rest: all which are the peculiar effects of their benign temperature, which nor only renders my compound Medicines, but those of meere simples, whether of Mint, Cinamon, Clove and the like, so far different from those of the same mildness and pleasantness, wanting the humane true temperature, that both in health and sickness, the one shall do real ser∣vice, where the other doth mischief in one kind or other.
These, though not neere the whole of what might have bin collected, of cures of this kind—much less of those, who have cured themselves by a draught or two in their first illness, and so escaped fits of sickness, and courses of Physick; nor of such who have dayly supplyed their spirits, and fortified their natures, by their use in dyet and refreshment, unto which they are essentially proper; yet I conceive are abundant proofs of their real virtue and effecacy: and that those marks and characters arising from them, are not irrationally proposed, as a test or Touchstone of real Medicine; and for distinction of such as may be tho∣roughly trusted in cure; from those which are not, and that with out, any outward violence, by Bleedings Issues, Clisters, Blisters, &c. or any inward disturbance to the body, by Loosning, Vomiting, or other enforce∣ments by Minerals, may suffice in all
cases and extreamities, to the comfort of all the ingenious, both persons and families; who taking this for their guide, need not hence forth be so much to seek for reliefe as formerly, in times of sickness and necessity. Every of those Medicines pointed at, being al∣waies to be had, At the Star in the Postern by little Moorefields, London, 1667. FINIS.
