A LETTER From the Parliament of Scotland, To the Honourable William Lenthall Esquire, Speaker of the House of Commons. SIR, THe Estates of the Parliament of this Kingdom having received a Letter dated the 23 of May, signed by you as Speaker of the Parliament, and written in the name of the Com∣mon-wealth of England; which Titles, in regard of the Solemn League and Covenant, and Treaties, and the many Declarations of the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, are such as they may not acknowledge. As for the matter therein contained; those many things of just resentment, wherein satisfacti∣on is demanded from this Kingdom, are onely mentioned in the generall, and therefore cannot so well receive a particular answer: But if by these generall expressions, the late unlawfull En∣gagement against England be understood, They desire that their protestation against the same in Parliament, and the opposition made thereunto by them afterward in Arms (which they never laid down untill the Garisons of Berwick and Carlisle were restored unto the Kingdom of Eng∣land) may be remembred, together with the Letter of the House of Commons to the Generall Assembly of this Kirk, of the third of August 1648: And that Lieutenant General Cromwel, au∣thorized from both Houses of Parliament, did upon the 5 of October last, represent to the Com∣mittee of Estates of this Kingdom, the wrongs and injuries committed against the Kingdom of England in that Engagement; and thereupon did demand that they would give assurance in the name of the Kingdom of Scotland, not to admit or suffer any who have been active in, or con∣senting to that Engagement, to be imployed in any publick place or Trust whatsoever; which was not onely granted, and afterward confirmed in Parliament, but all Acts for prosecution thereof have been repealed, and all proceeding relating thereunto publickly disclaimed. And if any other wrongs shall be make known unto us, we shall be ready to return such an Answer as may give just satisfaction. If the Bonds of Religion, Loyalty to the King, and mutuall amity and friendship betwixt the Kingdoms be impartially considered, according to the Solemn League and Covenant, and the pro∣fessions and Declarations of both Kingdoms, The Estates of Parliament think that they have just cause to complain of the late proceedings in England in reference to Religion, the taking away of the Kings life, and the changing the fundamentall Government of that Kingdom; against which this Kirk and Kingdom and their Commissioners, have protested and given Testimony, whereun∣to they do still adhere. And since it is apparent there hath been of late in England a backsliding and departure from the grounds and principles wherein the two Kingdoms were engaged, the Parliament of this Kingdom doth propound, that the late proceedings there against Covenant and Treaties may be disclaimed and disavowed, as the prosecution of the late unlawfull Engagement against England hath been disclaimed and disavowed here; and that such as have departed from these principles, and their former professions, may return to the same: Upon which grounds they are content to uthorize Commissioners on behalf of this Kingdom, to treat with Commissioners from both Houses of the Parliament of England, sitting in freedom, concerning all matters of just complaint which either Nation may have against the other, and for redresse and reparation thereof, and to do every thing that may further conduce for continuing the happy peace and union betwixt the Kingdoms, which can never be setled upon so sure a foundation as the former Treaties, and the solemn League and Covenant: From which, as no alteration or revolution of Affairs can absolve either Kingdom; so, we trust in God, that no success, whether good or bad, shall be able to di∣vert us; but as it hath been our care in time past, it shall be still our reall indeavour for the fu∣ture to keep our selves free of all compliance with, or inclining to the Popish, Prelatical and Ma∣lignant party upon the one hand; or to those that are enemies to the fundamentall Government by King and Parliament, and countenance and maintain Errour, Heresie, and Schism upon the other. I have no other thing in command from the Parliament of this Kingdom, but to take no∣tice that there is no Answer returned to their Letter of the 5 March last. And so rests For the Honourable Will. Lenthal Esquire, Speaker of the House of Commons. Edenburgh, 26 Junii 1649. Your humble Servant, LOUDOUN Cancellarius, Praeses Parliamenti. FINIS.
