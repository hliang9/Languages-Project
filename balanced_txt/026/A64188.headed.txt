THE NOBLE CAVALIER CARACTERISED, AND A REBELLIOUS CAVILLER CAUTERISED. By JOHN TAYLOR. TO begin roundly, soundly, and profoundly, The Ca∣valier is a Gentleman, a Commander on Horse∣backe; The Caviller is a Rascall, whether he swim, go, or ride; the Cavalier dares fight and be valiant, obey Law, and serve for his Soveraigne, his Coun∣trey, for the true Religion established, for the Lawes, for the Subjects Liberty, for the Rights and Priviledges of Parliaments, and for the peace, conservation and tranquillity of all these he will send his best blood, and life too, and thinke them well spent; the Caviller dares quarrell, but not fight, he dares rebell and not obey, he transformes his obedience into refractory contempt, his love into loathing of Loyalty; his Religion into false hypocriti∣call Faction, the service of his King he translates into Treason, his service to his Countrey is his Countries ruine, his seeming to sup∣port the Lawes, is on purpose to be lawlesse, the Subjects Right and Liberty he metamorphiseth into oppression, slavery and bond∣age, the Rights and Priviledges of Parliaments he destroyes with defending, and against the peace of all these he will plot, contrive, invent, contemplate, meditate, slander, lye, write, raile, libell, and do or say any thing but what is just, true, and honest. All which Villanies are so contrary to a cavalier, that a greater disparity is not betwixt Light and Darknesse, or between God and Belial; and although the blacke mouth'd, venom'd tooth'd Cavil∣ler doth dayly seek to sully and blast the name of a Cavalier, by be∣stowing on them the sweet stinking Epithites and Titles of Damme,
renounce, consume, confound, sinke, and the like execrable Blasphe∣mies, which indeed are inexcusable, and inevitably damnable; yet I must be so plain with the Caviller, as to tell him that Lot's Incest was no excuse for Achan's Theft, Cain's committing Murder was no warrant for Achitophel to give treacherous Counsell, nor was Rab∣sheka's blasphemy any president for the lying hypocrisie of Ananias and Saphira; no more are the detestable and damnable Oathes with which the Caviller doth charge and scandall the Cavalier, any pre∣sidents to move or maintain lying, dissimulation, cheating, Rebelli∣on, Treason, &c. Nor can I believe the saint seeming Caviller, that the Cavalier hath taken all the prophane swearing from him, for if he will but call his seared, cauterized Conscience to a strict examination, it will tell him, that he hath sworne an Oath of Allegiance to be loyall to his King, which Oath is recorded in Heaven, and the breach of it is to be punished in Hell, of the violation of which Oath the Cavalier is guiltlesse, and the Caviller most damnably guilty. We must with humble thankfulnesse confesse the great blessings which the Almighty hath been graciously pleased to multiply upon the learned and pious paines taking of our Preachers, for they do preach and exhort to the amendment of life and manners; they do pray to the God of peace for the peace of God, and they do im∣plore and invocate the Throne of Grace, for the Conversion of all cavilling contentious Preachers, and all the rest of malicious and ignorant seduced Cavillers, that (seeing their errouts) they may heartily and unfeignedly repent for their Rebellions and Treasons, against the Lord and against his Anointed. Those Preachers have so prevailed in their good endeavours, that they have and daily do beat down swearing, and wound the Consciences of the swearers with the Sword of the Spirit, so that the Cavaliers can afford the Cavil∣lers and their holy Armies all their Oathes, and their Drunkennesse too, although it is manifestly known that you have been alwayes provided, by the helpe of your Grand Signiour of the Lower blacke House, to furnish all the Armies in Christendome with those accur∣sed conditions. It was never known that all Souldiers should be found to be All Saints, or that a whole Army consisted of none but godly and religi∣ous Persons, some may be drawn (out of blinde zeale) by opinion and imagined good intents; also there are great numbers that beare
Armes more for company than conscience, more for spoile and plunder than for the Cause which they seem to stand for; some plunged deep in Debts run to the Warres for Acquittances, and per∣haps pay their Creditours with cutting their throats; some servants and Apprentices turne raw Souldiers, to free themselves from their Master's command; some Fellons, Ravishers, Man slayers and Murderers, run to the Warres to escape the Hangman; and of all these virtuous sorts of Vermin is the Cavillers whole Force com∣pacted, whose Leaders and Abetters are ambitious, pernicious, a∣varitious, malicious, seditious, not caring how long these miserable calamities of Warre endure, so that by their Trickes, Sleights, Votes, Excises, Plunderings, Robberies, and extorting Taxations, they make England like a Mill, and themselves (like thievish Millers) may imperiously and securely take trible Toll of the Goods and Estates of all the English Protestants, and loyallest Subjects in the Kingdome, or of as much as their usurping Power can lay hold on. But their zealous Pulpit men have so rooted them in the rudiments of Rebellion, that they are perswaded that their Cause is merito∣rious, their being beaten is victorious, and if they be killed, their deaths are glorious; but if they understood, that he that desperately runnes himselfe into forbidden wickednesse (as Rebellion and Treason is) doth precipitate himselfe into needlesse dangers, and if he catch his death in the action, (for ought I know) he is so farre from a reward of future glory, as any of the Devils Martyrs are from eternall happinesse. Moreover the Cavalier hath a naturall and earnest desire to better his condition, he hath that discretion as not to wish himselfe worse to day than he was yesterday, & desires to be better to morrow than he is to day; whilest the Caviller followes the Devil's rule, that as he hath been bad, so it is his safest way to be worse, and that to be worst of all is his securest defence, his surest Guard being to defend old wickednesses with new villanies, and former trans∣gressions with quotidian iniquities, for many do go to the Warres, not to lose their old faults but to gain fresh and new ones; and as the Caviller holds himselfe to be a Subject out of curtesie not consci∣ence; so the Cavalier doth know himselfe bound to be a true Liege∣man to his King, not out of curtesie but conscience. The caviller amplifies the casuall slips and frailties of other men, and selfe-flat∣teringly extenuates his own grosse enormities, he is quicke-sighted
to spy a mote, but purblinde in discerning a beame, he will out-face a man that the smallest Geneva Print are the greatest Capital Letters, and that the roaring voyce of sientor, is but the squeling of a Pig∣mie; the Cavalier knowes his own faults to be greatest, and could be as contented to be quiet honourably, as to fight valiantly, he hath honest and unstained reputation besides a life to lose; whilest the Cavillers and their memorable Members of infamous and impious remembrances may bravely persist in Rebellion, for they have no∣thing to lose that is good, except the stolne Goods of the King and Kingdomes; they cannot lose Honour, for that is lost already, and forfeited by Rebellion and most horrid Treason; they cannot lose a Gentleman, for their Gentility is gone hand in hand with the lost Honour; they cannot lose a Protestant, for they have none of that Religion to be killed, except they murder them; nor can they lose a good Subject, for there is not one in their Armies: they may lose Traitours, Rebells, Thieves, Anabaptists, Brownists, Libertines, Hypocrites, Schismatickes, Separatists, Cheaters, and Cuckolds, but for them to lose an honest man is as impossible as to paint an Ec∣cho, or make the Moon a new Coat. So that in this case the Cavaliers are at an exceeding great disad∣vantage, to fight with those unkinde kinde of Creatures, for they adventure Pearles against Pebles, and Gold to Dirt, a thousand pound to a nut-shell, and a large Kingdome to a small Mole-hill. Indeed the inveterate hatred and malice of the Cavillers is no longer than they live, but (in their own life time) it extends towards the dead, for they have barbarously entred into Churches, (which are dedicated to the Service of God, and consecrated onely for pi∣ous and Divine Services) and there they have not onely torne and broken down all Ornaments of Order and comely Decency, but also they have rased Tombes, Sepulchres, Statues, Monuments, Bones, Eschucheons, Armes, Hatchments, and any thing that was either erected, engraven, carved, or insculped as most reverend Memories of the dead, the least part of which irreligious inhuma∣nity would never have entred into the thought of the most savage Heathens, Pagans, Infidels, Cannibals, Atheists, Anthropophagi or Devils. But note, and with horrour and trembling consider, how the Di∣vine Vengeance hath suddenly confounded some of those malici∣ous or mislead Wretches, a few of which fearfull Examples I will truly relate.
It is not long since, that a sincere senselesse Church-warden at the Town of Teuxbury (in the yeare of his Reigne) caused a stone-Crosse in the Church-yard to be pulled down, and in the upper part of it, wherein was graven or carved the Figures of our Saviour's remembrance Crucified, with the Formes of two persons weeping at the foot of the Crosse, in me∣mory of the extreme greifes and dolours which then afflicted the blessed Virgin, and Evangelist Saint John; which part of the Crosse M. Church-warden caused to be hewen by a Mason into a Hog-trough, (he being of the race of the Gadarens, and loved his Swine better than any memory of his Redeemer) but within two or three dayes all his Hogges and hoggish Beasts were strucken dead, his Wife ran mad, his Children, one was drowned, and himselfe strook with a miserable languishing Disease, and died a wretched spectacle, or admirable miracle of misery. Another that boldly adventured to climbe up to pull down the Crosse in Cheap-side, but he slipped his hold-fast, and fell with his ribbes upon the iron pikes or grate which encompast the Crosse, so that he was wounded to death with the fall. Also, at Worcester, a fellow would take upon him to teare down the Organs, and he fell from the top of them down upon the pavement of the Church, and brake his bones, that he presently died. Moreover, in Oxford, when the Rebelis were there 1642. they most insolently marched through the Streets, and impiously one of their Dra∣goones shot at the Figures of our Saviour, and the blessed Virgin, and with the shot beat and battered off the heads and faces of the harmelesse Figures, but he presently fell from his Horse, to the great endangering of a neck-breaking. Another, the same time shot at the Similitude of Christ, over the Gate of All-Soule: Colledge, and his Piece brake and split and shivered his hand in pieces. Also at Merton Colledge, another impudent Varlet did the like, but his powder-bagge being open, a sparke of his Match fell into it, which set fire on his Powder, and blew out both his eyes. And but for two of these three Villanies, I would not have mentioned any of them, but that I knew one Master Thomas Rogers a Chirurgian (deceased) in Oxford, had them in Cure, and he whose hand was torne was cured (though maimed) the other had one of his eyes recovered: and these Examples are sufficient to deterre and hold mens hands from impious Sacriledge. Moreover (to seasen all the rest) I must not omit the zeale of a devout Brother, whose name is Francis Beale, (dwelling in the Axe-yard in Kings
Street, Westminster.) this Beale was sometimes an Ale-house-keeper and Tobacco-man, that with pot and pipe, nicke, froath, puffe, and whiffe, gat a devillish deale of money, by punishing, cheating, and beggering of Drunkards; then he gave over that kinde of life, and was a Porter to the Lady Kincleavin, since when he is turned Gentleman, and contributary bountifull Rebell; this Beale hath a son at mans estate, (a proper honest man) who left father, mother, Sectarisme and Rebellion, and hath long served in His Majesties Army, (which his father and mother hold to be Apostasie) and she good old Gentlewoman, with griefe and sorrow that her son was so undutifull as to be a Protestant, and a good Subject, she cau∣sed a Bill to be written to have him prayed for in the Church, which Bill was delivered in Martin's Church neare Chearing-Crosse, to the famous Master Case, the Lecturer there on Thursdayes; the Forme of the Bill was as followeth. These are to desire you to take into your Christian considerati∣ons the griefe and sorrow of one Mistris Beale of Westminster, whose son Francis Beale is fallen away from grace, and serves the King in his Warres. Wherefore she most humbly beseecheth the prayers of this Congregation, that he may returne and be converted. But this kinde Gentlewoman was not so fixed to Brownisme, Anabaptisme, or Round-headisme, but that within these few yeares she was in hope that her hypocriticall going to heare Masse at the Queenes Chappell at Denmarke House, would have been the meanes to have made her either a Nurse, a Rocker, or a necessary Chaire∣woman to the Duke of Glocester, but though she failed of her Office, there was an old Knight, with a great feather, no haire, and so much wit that he entertained her all night (for her better edification in the Catholique Cause) in imitation of the Signe where she dwelt, [An Axe cutting of a Feather] by this you may perceive how constant the Creature is in any Religion. I have read that George, King of Bohemia, and John, King of Hungaria, were at deadly Warre for Religion, and after much blood shed, the Kings having each of them a Foole or a Jester, they agreed that their Fooles should have a single Combate at Buffets, and which of them wan the Victory at Cuffes, that both the Kings should be of the same Religion with the Conquerour; and such as this was the zeale of Mistris Beale and ma∣ny thousands more shallow-brain'd, malicious, ignorant, and seduced peo∣ple that are Rebells for Religion, when as (God knowes) there is no Re∣ligion for Rebellion, nor can they shew any Reason why or wherefore they are thus mad against all obedience, order, and loyalty to God and their Soveraigne. But as poore silly Sheep run all together, And in confusion send they know not whether;
So those mad People, pray, disburse, and fight, Not knowing truths from lyes, or wrong from right: The Multitude like Dogges with open jawes, One bawles cause t'other barkes, yet knowes no cause: Aske Rebells what's the reason they rebell, And aske Dogges why they barke, They cannot tell. Thus with the deluding and threatenings of lying Lecturers, and princ∣ed Lyes, the Gates of London are shut and guarded so strongly, that Truth or Honesty can get no entrance, for it is a most dangerous thing for a Pro∣testant or a true subject to live there; they may be perhaps perswaded to have a King, but they would have that King to have no Kingdome, they might be brought to call Him their Soveraigne Lord, but withall that he shall be without any Dominion, and they may be entreated to be called his subjects, provided that he will be subject to them; but I advise them, that as they have made bold to call themselves a Parliament, and been bolder to make a counterfeit Great Seale, so they may fill up the measure of their iniquities, and (by Master Prinnes Law) by as good right make a fresh and new counterfeit King; or if no man will be so impudent or inso∣lent to accept it, take a suit of John Pym's cloathes well brush'd, pick'd, and lowsed, and stuffe it with straw, which being placed in the Throne will be a suitable Soveraigne to support the power of your Seale, Orders, Votes, and pretended Soveraigne Power of your Vtopian Parliament. If rebellious and bewitched London would with her many headed, mis∣lead Beasts, but examine themselves truly of two things, they would then perceive what falsities the grand Cavillers have blinded them withall, and to what misery their cavilling hath brought them, and (if God pre∣vent not) will bring them into irremediable destruction. The first thing I wish them to call their consciences to an account of, is, why they were Rebells at all? The second is, wherefore they do obstinately and execrably continue in Rebellion? If every Caviller would catechise himselfe, they would finde that they have wandred in vanity, and followed after Lyes. They would hang down their heads with shame, and acknowledge them∣selves worthy to be hanged for their treacherous disobedience, and open hostile Treasons against so good and gracious a Soveraigne, they would then consider to what a ruinous Desolation they have brought this famous flourishing Kingdome, whose Government was admired and honoured through the whole world; till now of late a multitude of mis-begotten and worse bred Rebells have done their best and worst to bring all to con∣fusion. For which wicked purposes they have made bold to make Mer∣cury
their counterfeit poste, poste-horse and pack-horse, who under the names of Civicus, Britannicus, Scoutes, Scottish Pigeons, and other pret∣ty, ill-contrived, sweet, filthy, sophisticated Titles and Epithites, hath beswarmed all the Christian world over with English Lyes, written by as very Villaines as could be spew'd from the bottomlesse Pit, disperst by as arrant Rogues as ever dropped into the Hangmans budget, and believed and countenanced by none but malicious Traitours, superstitious, nose∣wise Schismatickes, or ignorant logger-heads, the fruits, and damnable events that have been produced from these Diabolicall practices. Contra∣rily, the Cavalier knowing his cause just, applies himselfe onely to Truth, both in fighting and writing, they have used three sorts of Christian Di∣scipline to the Cavillers, in a charitable desire to conforme them. First, they have given them kinde admonitions, wherein they have told them truly, that the Publique Faith in which they have too much confided is no Faith either to be saved by, or to be made savers; they have further adver∣tised them to beware of Sects, and believing seditious Counsels, because they were motives to Rebellion, which is as the sin of Witchcraft, 1 Sam. 15. 23. Secondly, when Admonition would do no good with these Cavil∣lers the Cavaliers did take a little stiffer course, and from exhortation they fell to reprehension, telling them roundly that they were seduced and blin∣ded by feares, flatteries and jealousies out of their earthly estates and lives, and extremely hazarding the losse of a better life to come. But when nei∣ther kinde Admonition, or wholesome Reprehension would worke upon their perfidious and benummed consciences, then were the Cavaliers in∣forced (for their own safety) to take defensive Armes, and to use the meanes to save the Cavillers soules, by beating them Northerly, Westerly, and most brotherly both in Wales and England; and by those wayes to bela∣bour them out of their bad conditions into better manners: to this end and purpose, the Cavalier party have not onely used the Spirituall and Tem∣porall Swords, but also they have with their pennes so banged and basted their libellous and rebellious forgeries, and ridiculous fopperies, that their Ballad-ma∣kers and Pamphletteers are defunct, the bright lustre of Truth hath eclipsed them and gulleries, so that like rotten Sheep they would be glad to sculke under a hedge for shel∣ter: and it is manifest that the Pen of a true Writer will cut keener than a Sword, when a lying, scandalous Knave cuts his own throat with his own Goose Quill. Of the which scribling number, the nine times thrice valiant, conquering, command∣ing Captain George Withers hath written a pretty, foolish, witty, loyall, traiterous Book called Campo Musae, composed of the two most delicate Simples, Flattery and Treason: but I leave him and the rest of the railing Rabble of Rabshekaes to amend or be hanged, and that is a FINIS.
