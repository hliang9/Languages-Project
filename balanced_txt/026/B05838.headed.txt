The Shepher'ds Lamentation For HIS PHILLIS. Tune of, As I lay musing all alone. As I lay musing all alone, close down by a Chrystal Fountain, I heard a Shepherd make great moan for his Love that long had been, As he lay musing all alone, Fetching many a bitter groan, And on his Hat there seem'd to be A branch of a green-willow-tree. How now Shepherd, what means that Thou wear'st thy Willow on thy Hat? Formerly 'twas blue and yellow, Now is turn'd to a bunch of green-willow It is my Phillis and only she, That makes me wear the Willow-tree. When I lay me down to rest, Love lyes bleeding in my breast, Cease, said I, and do not mourn For her that holds thy heart in scorn; But hereafter be like they That Courts a new face e'ery day. FINIS. THE Jealous LOVER's Complaint: OR, His Torment for Love of Fair Clozis. Tune of, While I lay gazing, &c. WHile I gaze on Clozis trembling, while her looks my face declares. When she smiles I fear dissembling, when she frowns I straight dispair, Jealous of some Rivals favour, which her wandring looks can give, Fain I would desire to leave her, but can sooner cease to live. Happy is he whose inclination warms but with a gentle heat, Or flyes out into a passion, love's a torment, Oh 'tis great, When the Storms are once blown over, soon the Ocean quiet grows, But a tender faithful lover never is in true repose. FINIS. Printed for T. Blare at the Looking-Glass on London-Bridge.
