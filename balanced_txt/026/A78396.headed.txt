THE Cavalliers advice to his Maje∣sty, together with his answer to their de∣sires. Also his Majesties Intentions for the avoiding of my Lord of Essex his approach with certain Propositions propounded by the Caval∣liers unto His Majesty, concerning the procure∣ment of their generall pardon, all which tru∣ly gathered and compacted out of a let∣ter sent from Coventry, to a Ci∣zen of LONDON. THe Cavalliers having Intelligence of my Lord of Essex, his comming towards them and knowing themselves to be fare to weake to oppose so great an Army as they suppose he would bring along with him, therefore they thought it meete amongst themselves to Petition. and desire his Majesty for the safety of their persons: to be pleased to take to his royal considerration for the obtayning of some meanes for their safer protection, and as for their parts they knew noe better way then for his Majesty to Crosse the Sea: and crave the assistance
of forraigne Forces, his Majesty hearing of their petition seemd much to dislike of it, alleadging that were no better then for to avoid Scylla, and fall into Charybdis, therefore His Majesty after a small contemplation resolved them what he would do, which was to effect, that hee would remove all his Forces by degrees unto Wales to Loyd-loo Castle, where he well knew he should finde many faithfull and trusty persons, especially my Lord of Carbery, and whatsoever power and Forces hee could rayse, likewise alleadging that the mountaines and hills would be cumbersome for my Lord of Essex and his horsemen to come over, especially with their Ammunition; but yet with all this the Cavalliers were not throughly satisfied, for their wicked guilty Consciences harboured still a jealousie of future dangers, therefore they urged cer∣taine Propositions to his Majesty, of which the chiefe were these three particulars. First, that if His Majesty would not with prone willing∣nesse condescend to their desire, he would be pleased to continue in the same stedfast resolutions (to wit) adventure and undergoe all dangers whatsoever (without any yielding) as they would doe, or that in case if his Majestie did unite himselfe with His both Houses of Parliament, he would be pleased to obtaine them a generall pardon for all crimes what∣soever that may be laid to their charge, the second proposition and de∣mand was, that seeing they had adventured both their lives and fortunes in His Majesties behalfe and service to the prejudice and danger of their utter ruine, that His Majesty would be pleased in consideration thereof amply to reward them for their said adventure, and if that in case His Majesty were not of power sufficient to accomplish the same to so great a number, that then he would be pleased to give them way to satisfie themselves, to connive at their wickednesse that they might pillage the houses of all those that should any way oppose his will and thereby sa∣tisfie themselves. The third and last was, that if His Majesty would not crosse the Sea for his safety, he would be pleased to give way for the Irish Rebells to come over to assist his person. To their first demand His Majesty answered that he would willingly undergoe and be equal sharers in all their dangers, but as for his yeelding, ere he would see His 3. Kingdomes massacred, upon lawfull & just considerations he was resolved to comply with his both Houses of Parliament, but wirh such an exception as that there should be a generall pardon granted to all, or
at least wise he would endeavour with his utmost power to procure the same, to their second demand he answered, that for their loyalty to him in adventuring their lives and fortunes in his behalfe, it should not be unthought of, if ought in him might yeeld requitall, yet would not he by no meanes consent to the rifling and pillaging of any of his Subjects houses without they were manifestly knowne to be Traytors to his Person, at their third and last de∣mand, he seemed to be extraordinarily moved by reason of so unjust a Petition, therefore he gave to that a plaine and flat deniall, only for the safety of his person, his reso∣lution was to go to Wales to Loyd-loo Chastle afterwards if he found not that a sufficient harbour, he would take to further consideration, concerning crossing the Sea, the Cavalliers at this being dismayed partly through feare of future dangers, and partly to avoid my Lord of Essex his approach, many of them fled away and forsook his Majesty, others more resolutely bent, kept still with his Person to∣wards Wales, where 'tis reported his Majesty intends to take habour. Likewise many of the Scots hearing of my Lord of Essex his intention came over to Dover Castle, with a desire to present their service unto his Excellency and their endeavours, for the assistance of his person, where they no sooner landed, but that they heard beating of drums by certaine Cavalliers for the levying of men in his Majesties service against the Parliament, they desirous to know further the Cavalliers intention, went to them un∣der pretence of being assistance for them, but finding their resolutions to bee so wicked, neither agreeable to the Lawes of God, nor the laws of man, fell there upon them turning their faces about, so that the Cavalliers were greatly discomfited, and glad every man to run away, and shift for himselfe. Oxford Schollers in like manner had a great overthrow by the foure hundred Troopers sent thither by the command of both the honourable Houses of Parliament, to search certaine
Delinquents & Cavalliers, and other ill-affected persons which the Schollers there had harboured, for the Schollers before the said Troopers arived thither were mighty unruly, beating the Townesmen away, so that they were fame to fly for refuge, some to Abington, some to Tame, others to Botley leaving all their goods behind them, but at the comming thither of the said Troopers they all returned and joyn'd forces together. The Schollers had no intellgence of then comming untill they were almost upon the skirts of the Towne past Shotover wood, then they suspected their intentions, and caused the gates of every Colledge to be shut, but the Troopers no sooner came over the bridge, but that they began to batter at Magdalen Colledg, and Magdalen Hall being the two first in their way, but first demanding for Doctor Fruen, being President of the Colledge to have the gates opened, who the Schollers replied was out of town at Glocester, for he is Deane of that Cathe∣drall, yet neverthelesse the gates were not opened for the present, till such time that the Souldiers began to batter the Chappell windowes, whereof one windowe being at the East end of the Chappell of Darke worke which was valued at an hundred pound, which was beaten downe to peeces, with many other windowes of thirty pound price; Upon this assault the gates were opened and entrance was given, and there they found certaine Cavalliers in Schollars habits, who were knowne to be so by their Feathers, Buffe Coates, and other Warlik habits found in their Chambers. Some nine or tenne of the Schollers there behaved them∣selves very saucily towards the Souldiers, scoffing at them, and at the honourable Houses of Parliament, especially one Robinson a Demy of that Colledge, hee with the rest were taken Prisoners; they made search for Ammunition but they found none, onely great store of Plate, among which a piece was termed by the name of the Parliament pot (given it seemes by some of the Nobility at the last Parliament held there) which was valued to be worth threescore pound; all
this while many of the Troopers were dispersed to severall Colledges, some to new Colledge, some to All-Soules, o∣thers to Bailoll, and Saint Johns, they found some small store of Ammunition, which as it was thought was con∣veyed thither by Bishop Laud, for hee hath beene formerly of that Colledge. In this house likewise one Painter a Master of Arts was found with a Libell in his pocket, made against certaine men of that County that stood firmely affected for the Parliament, those that went to search Iesus Colledge found no Ammunition there, onely the Doctor somewhat sterne, and as they conceived by his discourse no extraordinary well wisher to the honourable Houses of Parliament; this Colledge was not well fraught with Plate, all the store they had was conveyed and hid in the Mansiples house at Saint Giles Pa∣rish, who told the Souldiers at their approaching unto his house that they were all knaves, for which hee was faine to fly for his paines. Also one Edwards a North-wales man, fellow of this House was taken prisoner for the abusefull termes he spoke in the behalfe of a Cavallier that was a friend of his Some of the most ignorant Troopers went to the Schooles taking it for a Colledge, and there lay searching and tumb∣ling too and fro of the Library Bookes; but all this while the chiefe of the Cavalliers were sheltred in Christ Church, where they had above the gate laid heapes of stones at their entring for to fall on the Troopers heads. Some others stood in study windowes with Pistolls in their hands, but our men having notice by the Citizens of all that they intended, went in at the back Gate opposite to Oriall Colledge, and through Canterbury quadrangle, so that some of the Schollers and Ca∣valliers hastning to fly away, running through the other gate were cruelly wounded in their owne Traps, and taken by our Souldiers thereby, to the number of two hundred, whereof fourescore are already sent to London, and imprisoned in seve∣rall places, the rest are in hand hourely expected to come;
many places of the Colledges are extreamely pestred by our Souldiers, by reason of the Schollers obstinacy, especially their Libraries and windowes, and many of the Caval∣liers are still lurking there in by places as well as the Colledges, which makes our Souldiers so long billet there with∣out returning. FINIS.
