C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms EDINBURGH, The second day of February, one thousand six hundred and sixty four. FOrasmuch as the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, taking to their consideration, the great advantage and profit will redound to the Lieges of this Kingdom, by keeping of the time of Lent and weekly Fish-dayes, viz. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, and discharging of all persons to eat Flesh, during that time, upon the saids dayes, or to kill or sell in Mercats any sorts of Flesh which are usually bought at other times, whereby the young Brood and Store might be preserved, and the hazard of scarcity and dearth prevented; and that the Fishes, which, by the mercy of GOD, abound in the salt and fresh waters of this Kingdom, might be made use of, for the food and entertainment of the Lieges, and the incouragment of many poor families who live by fishing: the improvement whereof hath been much neglected these many years past, which hath been occasioned by the universal allowance of eating of Flesh and keeping of Mercats at all times, without distinction or re∣straint, contrary to many laudable Laws and Acts of Parliament, prohibiting the eating of Flesh the time of Lent and upon the saids Fish-dayes. Did therefore, by their Act and Proclamation of the sixth of February, one thousand six hundred and sixty two, as also by their other Act of the twelfth of February, one thousand six hundred and sixty three, ordain and command, that the time of Lent for these years and yearly thereafter, should begin and be keeped as the same was keeped before the year of GOD, one thousand six hundred and fourty; and that the saids weekly Fish-dayes should be strictly observed in all time there∣after; and that no Subject, of whatsoever rank, quality or degree, except they have a special Licence under the hand of the Clerk of the Council, presume to eat any Flesh during the said time of Lent, or upon the saids three weekly Fish-dayes; and that no Butchers, Cooks, Hostlers, kill, make ready or sell any Flesh, either publickly in Mercats, or privatly in their own houses, during the said time, or upon the saids dayes, under the penalties following, to be exacted with all rigour, viz. For the first fault ten pounds; for the second fault twenty pounds; for the third fault fourty pounds; and so to be multiplied according to the oft contraveening of the said Act, to be exacted and paid, the one half to the Kings Majesty, and the other half to the delators: And for the surer exacting thereof, did give power and warrand to all Magistrates within Burghs, Sheriffs, Stewarts and Bailies, within their several jurisdictions, to enquire after the contraveeners, and to pursue them before the Lords of Privy Council, or such others as should be delegat and appointed for that effect. And seing the not keeping of Lent and Fish-dayes, conform to the saids Acts, hath been occasioned by not exacting the penalties, contained in the saids two former Acts, from the contraveeners thereof, who, upon hopes of impunity, may still continue to disovey the saids Acts, to the great prejudice of the Kingdom; Therefore, the saids Lords of Council have renewed, and by these pre∣sents renews, the foresaids Acts, and discharges all His Majesties Lieges from presuming or taking upon hand to contraveen the same in any time coming; with certification, if they failʒie, the pains and penalties therein contained shall be exacted with all rigour; and that they will crave an account of all Magistrates and other Ministers of Justice, who are intrusted to procure obedience thereto, and give notice of the offen∣ders in their respective bounds, as they will be answerable. And for this effect, ordains these presents to be printed, and published at the Mercat-cross of Edinburgh, and other places needfull, that none pretend ignorance. Pet. Wedderburne, Cl. Sti Concilii.
