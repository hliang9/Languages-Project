A DISCOVERY, To the praise of God, and joy of all true hearted Protestants, of a late intended plot by the Papists to subdue the Protestants. Being a true Copy of a discourse betweene William O Conner a Priest, and Anne Hussey an Irish Gen∣tlewoman: as it was brought and confirmed by oath in the Par∣liament House. Printed Anno, 1641. A True Coppy of a Letter written from a man in Ireland, to his friend in England SIR, I Could not omit to write unto you, to give you to understand of a miraculous deliverance, which the Lord in mercy hath vouchsafed unto the poore Protestants in this Kingdome, which you may perceive by the Proclamation enclosed; for I have not time to relate the whole story, or bloudy Tragedy, which was untended against us: The execution should have bin on the Satur∣day, which was discovered on Friday night, by a man of Sir Iohn Glatworthy, an Irish Knight, but one of your House of Com∣mons, and this day being the Sabboth, hath bin the troublesomest day that ever I saw in all my daies, mixt with joy and sorrow; joy for our our gracious deliverance, and much perplexed by feares of our approaching enemies, expecting every houre when the City should be surprized, that for my part and many others, haue had but little rest day and night for these two dayes, but how many more it is onely knowne to God; the Enemy hath in the North parts of this Kingdome, taken two Lords Castles, and two Townes, one of them of great strength and much munition in it, and as it is verily beleeved, they doe still encrease in great multitudes: here is taken a Lord, and divers others of note, and others the number of forty, which are safe in Prison, and hope of many more: the Lord is called the Lord Maguere, and the Pa∣pists make it a Religious Warre which they had no cause to doe, for they have had a long time as much liberty as wee have had if not more; but their father the Divell hath set them upon this damnable act I hope to their utter ruine in this Kingdome, if the Lord in mercy open our Kings eyes, and your Parliaments hearts to take pitty upon us, for no hope of Reformation is to bee had here, for they are ten for one of us through this Kingdome a is verily beleeved. I have bin so employed Day and Night these two daies, that I can hardly write thus much unto you, but desire your prayers and all good people for us, and when more is disco∣vered, if the Lord preserve me with life, you shall heare farther from me, in the meane time pray for us all. Your loving friend W. B.
