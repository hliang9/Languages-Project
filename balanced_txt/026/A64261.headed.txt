A TESTIMONY FOR THE LORD GOD, And his WORK in the EARTH. HEar O EARTH, and hearken ye HEA∣VENS, for the Lord hath spoken, even the Lord God mighty in Power & excellent in Wisdom, Loving kindness & Mercies hath appea∣red, and is made manifest in the Children of men, and the Iles of the Gentiles do feel his Power and partake of his Promise in the Light, in the Life, in the Eternal Covenant of his Peace and Truth, whereby Japhet is perswaded in the Tents of Shem to dwell; And this is the Lords own doing, and it is marvellous in the pure eyes of all that behold it, and the eye that seeth is blessed, and the Soul that heareth and believeth is blessed, and shall be bles∣sed; for the Lord the faithful God is Arisen, and his appearance is like the Sun when it Ariseth and shineth in the brightness of its glory; and there∣fore are we refreshed and caused to live in his sight, and to bring forth the living fruits of Righteousness to his praise and glory; Glory, glory for ever, for the Heaven gives now its dew, and the Earth yields its encrease, and the blessing is upon the People,
and the Nations of the World shall Bow, and the Inhabitants of the Earth do tremble at the glory of the Lord, at the Majesty of his Appearance in this his glorious day, wherein he hath Visited, and is Visi∣ting his Seed, and calling his Servants out of Egypt, and delivering his Beloved out of the hands of him that was too strong for them, and putting a new Song into our mouths; And his Rest is Glorious, and his Praise is Holy, and his Renown is spread a∣broad, and his foes become his foot-stool; and the Ransomed of the Lord do unto Zion return, and in the Light of the living God do all the day rejoyce and praise him upon the truly spiritual and well-tuned loud Cymbals in the heights of Israel, in the holy Temple, in the Promised Land, in the Purchased possession in the holy Mount, even the Mountain of Gods everlasting Love in CHRIST JESUS, where his eternal Arm of Power and Faithfulness is truly witnessed; And this is the Mountain of Gods House and Holiness indeed, which is now on the top of all Mountains; and here the Lord is fully seen, and his living Power dayly felt, and his everlasting Love continually enjoyed, for watering and refreshing the Babes and living Plants of the New Jerusalem; glory, glory for e∣ver, glory to the Righteous, for this is comely. And now is the day of the Lords gathering, and his Angels are gone forth, and his Trumpet hath sounded the Alarum out of the holy Mountain, unto all the Inhabitants of the Earth; And now if any Old or Young, High or Low, can come forth and
stand before the God of the whole Earth, they are warned and called upon to bring their deeds to the LIGHT, to the day of the Lamb, that true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the World, John 1. 9. For now indeed is the day of the Lord God appeared; and the Wrath of the Lamb is come, and who may stand before him? who can abide this day of his coming? For he cometh, for he cometh in the thousands of his Holy Ones to Judge the World, even all that are Proud and do Wickedly in his sight, and to convince them of all their ungodly deeds and hard speeches, which they ungodlily have spoken against him, and whereby they have slandred the foot-steps of his Annointed Ones, and blasphemed his Heavenly Tabernacle, which he hath pitched amongst men, that he might dwell amongst them and be glorified for evermore. So WOE is to the Wicked, and much Wrath will be upon the people who now stand out and strive against the Lord, even the Lord the habita∣tion of Justice, in whose hands is their breath, who are careless children and do not regard this day of their Visitation. So all having time, prize it, and bow to the Lord God, and know this day of your Visitation; for, the Lord in his Glory is Arisen, and his Eye beholds, and with his own pure Light is trying the children of men; And now, even now shall the mouth of Ini∣quity be stopped, and the Righteous shall rejoyce and be glad upon their Beds, as the Scripture hath
said; Yea, the high praises of God is already heard in their mouths, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, is felt going forth Conque∣ring and to Conquer; And the Mountains are mo∣ved, and the lesser Hills are afraid, and the hearts of the Hypocrites do melt for fear at the presence of the Lord, at the appearance of our God, the true God, the everlasting Father, who is exalting his own Name, and setting up the Kingdom of his dear Son, and shaking terribly the earth; glory, glory to him forever & for ever, for he is good, and his mercy endureth for ever, and of his faithfulness there is no end. All flesh is grass, but that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit, and shall inherit and sound forth the living praises of the living God, for evermore, as it is at this day. So be it. Given forth in the movings of the Lord, as a Witness to his Truth in this his Day, by one who bears the reproach of Christ (amongst many Brethren) by the evil World, under the name of Quaker. THO. TAYLOR. LONDON, Printed for Robert Wilson, at the Sign of the Black-spread-Eagle and Wind-Mill in Mar∣tin le Grand, 1660.
