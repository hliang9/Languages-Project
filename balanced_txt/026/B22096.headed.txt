THe Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled, taking into their serious consideration; That according to divers Ordinances of both Houses, the Committee for the Militia of London, and divers others wel-affected persons, by approbation of the said Committee, have raised great Forces of Horse and Foot; have made Courts of Guard, Forts, and Lines of Communication from one Fort to ano∣ther, as well within the said City and liberties, as without, in the Counties of Middlesex and Surry, have caused those Forces to be listed, ar∣rayed, weaponed, trained and exercised, and divers of these Courts of Guard and Forts to be manned and furnished with Ordnance; and have appointed Colonels, Captaines, and other Officers over them: That the said Committee and wel-affected persons are raising more forces of Horse and Foot, and providing more Armes and other necessaries; That the said Forces, Courts of Guard, and Forts have been, and are in∣tended to be constantly imployed for the safegard of this present Parliament, and of the said City and parts adjacent; whereon our Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and publique safety do so much depend; That the charge of raising and maintaining the said Forces, Courts of Guard and Forts, hath been, and is like to bee very great, and hitherto born chiefly by the said City and wel-affected Citizens thereof; That it is necessary to continue this charge till our Religion, Laws, and Liberties be by other meanes secured; That it is most just that all persons inhabiting within the said Forts and lines of Com∣munication, and Parishes adjacent, being in the more safety thereby, should therefore contribute to the said charge, and put their shoulders to the burthen, which will make it be much the more easily undergone: That it wil eminently tend to the safety of all the said Inhabitants, if all the said Forces raised and to be raised within the commands of the said Forts and lines of Communication, and Parishes adjacent, be subordinate to the command of the Committee of the Militia of London, next under both Houses of Parliament.

And it is further ordained and declared by the said Lords and Commons, That all persons inhabiting within command of the said Forts or lines of Communication and Parishes adjacent, mentioned in the weekly Bill of Mortality, except the persons before excepted, shall contribute towards the said charge in such a reasonable proportion as shall be thought fit by both Houses of Parliament, and that all the Forces raised and to be raised within the said Forts and lines of Communication, and Parishes adjacent, mentioned in the weekly Bill of mortality, except the persons before excepted, shall be orde∣red and disposed of from time to time, by the said Committee for the Militia of London, any former Order, Ordinance, or Declaration, or other matter to the contrary hereof, in any wise notwithstanding; And that Isaac Pennington now Lord Major, John Kendrick Alderman, Richard Turner senior, Willi∣am Hobson, Theophilus Reyley, Richard Bateman, Edward Cocke, Richard Turner junior, Robert Tichbourne, Tempest Milner, William Antrebus, Thomas Player senior, and Samuel Harsnet, Citizens of London, shall be added to the said Committee. And it is further ordained and declared, That as the good endevours of the said Committee for the Militia, and of other wel-affected persons aforesaid, are and shall be taken as real testimonies of their good intentions for the common good and safety, and the execution thereof a good and acceptable service to the Common-wealth, so the said persons shall be by power of Par∣liament saved harmlesse both for what (according to the true meaning of the premises) they have done, and what they or any others shall doe in the exe∣cution of this Ordinance from time to come.
