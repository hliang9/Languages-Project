royal coat of arms By the King, A PROCLAMATION. JAMES R. WE have received undoubted Advice, That a great and sudden Invasion from Holland, with an Armed Force of Foreigners and Strangers, will speedily be made in a Hostile manner upon this Our Kingdom; And although some false Pretences relating to Liberty, Pro∣perty, and Religion, contrived or worded with Art and Subtilty, may be given out (as shall be thought useful upon such an Attempt) it is manifest however, (considering the great Pre∣parations that are making) that no less Matter by this Invasion is proposed and purposed, then an Absolute Conquest of these Our Kingdoms, and the utter Subduing and Subject∣ing Vs and all Our People, to a Foreign Power, which is promoted (as We understand, although it may seem almost Incredible) by some of Our Subjects, being Persons of Wick∣ed and restless Spirits, implacable Malice, and desperate Designs, who having no Sense of former Intestine Distractions, the Memory and Misery whereof should Endear and put a Value upon that Peace and Happiness which hath long been enjoyed; nor being moved by Our reiterated Acts of Grace and Mercy, wherein We have studied and delighted to abound towards all Our Subjects, and even towards those who were once Our avow∣ed and open Enemies, do again endeavour to Imbroil this Kingdom in Bloud and Ruine, to gratifie their own Ambition and Malice, proposing to themselves a Prey and Booty in such a publick Confusion. We cannot omit to make it known, That although We had Notice sometime since, that a Foreign Force was preparing against Vs, yet We have always declined any Foreign Succors, but rather have chosen (next under God) to relie upon the true and Ancient Courage, Faith and Allegiance of Our own People, with whom We have often ventured Our Life for the Honour of this Nation, and in whose Defence against all Enemies, We are firmly resolved to live and die: And therefore We solemnly Conjure Our Subjects to lay aside all manner of Animosities, Iealousies and Prejudices, and heartily and chearfully to Vnite together in the Defence of Vs and their Native Countrey, which thing alone will (under God) defeat and frustrate the principal Hope and Design of Our Enemies, who expect to find Our People Divided, and by publishing perhaps some plausible Reasons of their coming hither, as the specious, though false Pretences of maintaining the Protestant Religion, or Asserting the Liberties and Properties of Our People, do hope thereby to Conquer this Great and Renowed Kingdom: But albeit the Design hath been carried on with all imaginable Secrecy and Endeavours to sur∣prize and deceive Vs, VVe have not been wanting on Our Part, to make such Provision as did become Vs, and by Gods Blessing VVe make no doubt of being found in so good a Posture, that Our Enemies may have cause to repent such their rash and unjust Attempt. We did intend (as We lately Declared) to have met Our Parliament in November next, and the VVrits are issued forth accordingly, proposing to Our selves, amongst other things, that VVe might be able to quiet the Minds of all Our People in matters of Religion, pursuant to the several Declarations VVe have published to that effect, but in regard of this strange and unreasonable Attempt, from Our Neighhouring Countrey (with∣out any manner of Provocation) designed to divert Our said Gracious Purposes, VVe find it necessary to recall Our said VVrits, which VVe do hereby recall accordingly, Commanding and Requiring Our Loving Sub∣jects to take Notice thereof, and to surcease all further Proceedings thereon; And forasmuch as the approaching Danger which now is at hand, will require a great and vigorous Defence, VVe do hereby strictly Charge and Command All Our Loving Subjects both by Sea and Land (whose ready Concurrence, Valour and Courage as true English-men We no way doubt in so just a Cause) to be prepared to defend their Countrey; And We do hereby Command and Require all Lords Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants to Vse their best and ut∣most Endeavours to Resist, Repel and Suppress Our Enemies, who come with such Confidence and great Pre∣parations to Invade and Conquer these Our Kingdoms. And lastly, We do most expresly and strictly Enjoyn and Prohibit all and every Our Subjects, of what Degree or Condition soever, from giving any manner of Aid, Assistance, Countenance or Succour, or from having or holding any Correspondence with these Our Enemies, or any of their Complices, upon pain of High Treason, and being prosecuted and proceeded against with the ut∣most Severity. Given at Our Court at VVhitehall the 28th day of September, 1688. In the Fourth Year of Our Reign. GOD SAVE THE KING.
