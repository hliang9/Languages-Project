THE MARKS OF THE True Church, THE Virgin & Spouse of Christ, that brings forth by a Holy Seed the Birth that pleaseth GOD. And the MARKS of the False Church, or Whore, that brings forth by an Evil Seed, the Cursed Birth, that never could please God. Signified by a Voice from the Word of Life, or a Certain Sound of the Trumpet that hath awakened Thousands, that were asleep in the Night of thick Darkness and Apo∣stacy, who are come to the Judgment of the Truth, that redeems out of BABYLON, and brings to SION. By which all are Summoned that are yet afar off, to appear before, and stand to the Judgment of the Ingraf∣ted Word in their Hearts, that by it they may know, What they are joyned to. By Morgan Watkins. What, know ye not that he which is joyned to an Harlot is one Body? for two (saith he) shall be one Flesh: But he that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spirit, 1 Cor. 6.16, 17. Printed in the Year 1675.
The MARKS of the TRƲE CHƲRCH, the Virgin and Spouse of Christ, that brings forth by a Holy Seed, the Birth that plea∣seth God. I. THey are such, who are turned from Darkness unto Christ the true Light, that shines in their Hearts, who believe and walk in it, and are turned from the Power of Satan unto the Power of God, that they receive (in Christ the Light) to become his Sons, having Redemption through his Blood. the Forgiveness of Sin, and Sanctification in and by that Life that is the Light of Men, and made Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. II. Such who have received the Word in a Measure, that spake in the Prophets, by which they prophesied, and was their Foundation, which the Apostles were Ministers and Preachers of, and was their Foundation, which they turned the People to, and they that believed, it was their Foundation; and they that believe and have received the Truth now, it is their Foundation and the Rock in all Ages; For other Foundation can no Man lay then that is laid, which is Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 3.11. God's Foundation that he hath laid for the Salvation of every Man, which is the Word grafted in them, that is able to save the Souls of all that receive it. Jam. 1.21. But they that reject it perish, and are but the Chaff that the Wind blows to and fro. III. Such who are in the Unity of the Spirit of Truth, and the Righteousness which is of Faith; that saith, The Word, is
nigh thee, in thy Mouth and in thy Heart, that is the Word of Faith (that Faith comes by the Hearing of) and the Word which the Apostles preached, Rom. 10.6, 8. IV. Unfeigned Love to God and to the Brethren; By this shall all Men know (saith Christ) that ye are my Disciples, if ye have Love one to another, John 13, 35. V. Such who are born again of Incorruptible Seed, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever, 1 Pet. 1.23. And are renewed in the Spirit of their Minds, being by one Spi∣rit all baptized into one Body, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit, by which they are quickned into one Life, which is the Flesh and Blood of Christ, that comes down from Heaven, the Children's Bread (as Christ saith) He that eateth me, even he shall live by me, John 6.57. And this is the Life that brings forth Fruit of Righteousness, and Birth of God that over∣comes the World, and is made manifest to that of God in eve∣ry Man's Conscience. VI. Such who make a good Confession by giving up them∣selves to suffer for the Righteousness sake of the Kingdom of God, and do not deny him before Men, by a subjecting to their Wills, against the Requirings of the Spirit of God; but are made willing to drink of the Cup, and be baptized with the Baptism their Lord and Master was baptized with, patiently taking up his Cross, contentedly bearing his Reproach, and continuing faithful to the Death. VII. Humility and self Denyal, hating Covetousness, Pricle, and the Pomp, vain Glory and Honour of this World, having the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, without Respect of Persons; Not having Mens Persons in Admiration because of Ad∣vantage, but doing Good unto all, especially to the Houshould of Faith; Visiting the Sick and Imprisoned for Righteousness sake, the Fatherless and Widdows in their Affliction, keeping them∣selves unsported from the World, Jam. 1.27.
VIII. Such who are Witnesses of the Spirit's Confession; that Christ is come in the Flesh, and hath condemned Sin in it in the Hour of his Judgment, that the Body of Sin might be de∣stroyed by him, that is come and received, To take away the Sin, and bring in the perfect Righteousness, that being crucified with him, and so suffering with him in the Flesh, dying with him (that is, by the Strength of his Power that overcomes Sin and Death) we come to be raised up with him (by the Power that raised him up) and so come to live to God (by him and in him) and no more to the Lusts of the Flesh, but to the Obe∣dience of the Spirit and Power, that gives us Victory over Death, and raiseth the Soul to Life, by the quickning Spirit, that gives us a Will, Desire, Hunger, Power and Strength, to live to the Good Will and Pleasure of our unutterable good and graci∣ous God, of whose Mercy and Goodness some feel more then Tongue of Man can declare; and God is Witness, such would that all Men might feel the same; and God is hastening his Work, that Thousands of Thousands may feel it, and sing of it in the Glory of his Presence for evermore, Amen. IX. Such who in their Measures witness the Reign of Sin and Death put down in them, with all its great Power and Au∣thority, by which it reigned from Adam until Moses, and doth still in all that have not received the free Gift of Righteousness (in which is God's Power revealed) and such are pleading for the Reign and Law of Sin, and for the Body of Sin to live in them till they dye, because they are under its Reign: But, as I have said, The Members of the True Church witness him come, whose Right it is to reign in them; who, having recei∣ved him (the Gift of God) hath and is putting down all Au∣thority, and all Rule that is not of God, nor ought to reign and rule in Man; so casts out the Strong Man, and spoils all his Goods: And these know him in them [mark that] greater then he that is in the World; who hath cast out the Prince of the World, and reigns over Death and Hell. And these are not looking for the Kingdom of Heaven to come with Outward Observations, as the Hypocrites did of old, and still do, who look for the Reign of a Person without them, and know not
that Hell and Death reigns in them (which some of late did know to their Sorrow, that others might be warned) who see not him that is invisible (to the Carnal Eye) that is come and coming in the Ten Thousands of his Saints to judge the World, and all the fallen ngels. X. Such who are gathered (by the Spirit of the Lord) out of all Gatherings in the Fall, that stand in the Will and Wisdom of Man; and these follow Christ, the Shepherd and Bishop of their Souls, and abide in his Doctrine and Spiritual Worship, and cannot hearken to a Stranger, who is made a Minister or a Bishop in the Will of Man, and not made by the Holy Ghost an Overseer of the Soul, but are climbed up another Way, and not come in through Christ the Door, by the Gift of his Spirit, but in the Wisdom of Man, and of the Birth of the Flesh that persecutes the Sheep for the Fleece, therefore the Sheep cannot hear them; for he that gives the Soul Eternal Life, the Soul ought to hear, and be subject to, and to all that come in his Name (that is, his Power) who feeds the Sheep & Lambs with the Bread of Life, that is Meat indeed and Drink indeed, where the Word of Life ministers through the Vessel, the Sheep that are gathered by the Spirit, do know the Voice of the Spirit, which is the Voice of Christ, that the Stranger knows not; but the Sheep and their Souls are greatly refreshed by that Ministry of Life, and so is the Body of Christ edified; but where the Gift of Life is not received, nothing but Death can preach, and that burdens, and hurts, and defiles the Soul if it be touched or fed upon; therefore in a Figure, he that touched the Dead was to be unclean by the Jews Law; so by the Law of the Spirit of Life, dead Works, that are Works of Darkness, the Living are to have no Fellowship with, but rather reprove them: So this is the Infallible Truth, that the Children of Truth and Sheep of Christ, will hear and obey none but the Voice of the Spirit of Christ, the Truth, the Light and the Life, which every Mem∣ber of his Body, hath a Measure of in himself, which is the A∣nointing that leads, guides, and teacheth all his to profit: in the Movings and Requirings of which, all may prophesie one by one, that all may be edified, and the whole Body built up to∣gether
in Love, a Habitation for the Lord to dwell in, to walk in, work in, and speak in; and these have received Eternal Life (dwelling in it) shall never perish. XI. Such who have put off the Old Man with his vain Con∣versation, and have (in their Measure) Crucified the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit, which is become their Leader (as ever it was their Fathers Children) in which they find Power to do the Will of God in Earth, as in Heaven; Being created again after the New Man in Righteousness and True Holiness, and being become New Creatures, are in Covenant with God; Old Things are past and passing away, and becoming and become New; a clean Heart and a right Spirit possesseth the Body, which loves the Lord wholy, and his Neighbour and Brother as himself; true Judgment and Justice sits in his Gate, and Goodness, Mercy, and Love within his House; his Law is come forth of Sion, and the Word of his God from Jerusalem; in the Doctrine of which he abides, and Statutes and Ordinances keeps, who swears not at all, nor lyes; for that is against the Truth, and under Condemnation; who is come to the End of Wars and Fight∣ings, and doth to all as he would be done unto, that ends Swearing, Lying, Fighting and Lusting after Evil Things, loves Enemies, serves Friends, respects not Persons, but gives to all their Due, To Caesar the Things that are his, and to God the things that are his; labours in Love for the Good of all, and doth Good to all; de∣nyes to hold up the Types and Shadows under the changeable Priesthood (which are fulfilled in the unchangeable) that point∣ed at Christ and his good Things; who ends the Old Things, the Old Priesthood, and the Law that upheld it; and Christ, the Everlasting Priest, being come, the Substance of them all, cannot deny him before Men, by holding up the Old Things that he hath abolished by his Coming, which, if now upheld, were to deny Christ come in the Flesh, the High-Priest of our Profession, Heb. 3.1. Now if we profess him to be our High Priest, and hold up another Priest∣hood, by paying of Tythes, and other Things abrogated and denyed by the Holy Brethren of the Heavenly Calling in the A∣postles
Dayes: I say then, though we do profess him in Words to be come, yet we should deny him in Works, and so do all that hold up the Ceremonies now the Substance is come, who is a merciful and faithful High Priest in Things appertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People, Heb. 2.17. And those that hold up or establish another Righteousness, fall short of the Righteousness of Christ; Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that is passed into the Heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our Profession, Heb. 4.14. Which Pro∣fession stands in Christ, the better Hope, by the which we draw nigh to God, whose Kingdom is not of this VVorld, there∣fore saith the King, Put up the Sword, and know that Nature that could kill with the Sword Outward, to be slain with the Sword Inward; for saith Christ, My Kingdom is not of this World, if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Ser∣vants fight, John 18.36. Then all you that fight, consider whose Servants you are, seeing Christ's Servants cannot; so all these Things forbidden, are not to be used by the Children of God's Kingdom, and Inheritors of the New Covenant, in which the New Man enjoyes all the Promises of God, that are Yea and Amen to him forever. XII. As to the Ministry, they are such that the Lord of the Harvest fitteth by his Spirit, and sends into the Harvest, being called and chosen, to be faithful Labourers in God's Harvest, and are content with his Wages (and refuse Anti christ's) having freely received, do freely give, according to their Master's Com∣mand, who warch for the Souls Good (and not for the Fleece) having Food and Raiment are contented, and are to be ready to do the Masters Will in all Things, and go whither the Spirit requires them, and to preach the Word of Truth he gives them, not consulting with Flesh and Blood, but with Christ revealed in them, who teacheth them to profit the People, and to divide the Word aright, with Boldness, not fearing Man, nor the Pow∣er of Darkness, but to shew the People their Sin, that they that are yet in it, may come to repent, and amend their Lives, by turning from Darkness to the Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, by receiving the Troth, in which
is found Power to do it, and then they do the Things they ought ought to do, and leave undone the Things they ought not to do, and so calling upon the Name of the Lord (whom they serve and obey) he answereth them, and gives them more Grace, more Strength, more Power to rule over much, because they are faithful in a little; and this is the profiting by the Gift, the Manifestation of the Spirit, that is given to every Man to profit withal; without which there is no profiting nor pleasing God: And this Ministry that comes in the Name of the Lord, but few will hear, because he comes with the Sword of the Spirit to slay that Life that lives in the fleshly Lusts, that wars against the Soul; but they that do hear him that comes in the Name of the Lord, they do hear the Lord, who saith, Hear, and your Souls shall live; that is, who do obey the Voice of the Lord, they receive Power to become, the Sons of God; but he that is not sent of God, may have the Words, but not having received the Word, hath but his Dream and the Words to tell, who comes in his own Name, that is, his own Power and Wisdom; and the People being in the same, hear him, and receive his Doctrine, because he spares their Life of Pleasure in the Flesh, and makes them believe they shall receive a Life of Glory af∣ter Death (and that is his Dream he tells for Money) and so deceives the Soul, and keeps it in Death, serving the Lust, and so the Sin, yet perswading themselves, by the Help of the Hire∣ling, that they serve the Lord; But no Man (saith Chrst) can serve two Masters, especially whose Wayes are so contrary one to the other; and so being taught to confess him in Words, but deny him in Deeds, drawing nigh with their Mouthes, but the Heart is after other Lovers, these having at most but a Form of Godliness, but denying the Power thereof; These the Children of Truth deny and turn from, therefore are hated and persecu∣ted by them, whose false Religion they deny, who themselves shew it to be false by their persecuting Spirit, that is of Cain; for Cain's Spirit can bring forth no other but Cain's Religion; that ist a Worship and Sacrifice that is out of the Truth, that can never please God, nor ever will, but it ever pleased most Men, and so it doth now; but we can say, The Lord forgive
them, they know not what they do; and so we must drink of our Master's Cup, and be baptized with his Sufferings, and so suf∣fering with him, shall reign with him. World without End, Amen. The MARKS of the FALSE CHƲRCH, or Whore, that brings forth by an Evil Seed, the cur∣sed Birth, that never could please God. I. SHE is made up of such Members who walk in Dark∣ness, and love Darkness rather then Light, because their Deeds are Evil; For every one that doth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, Joh. 3.20. Therefore it is clear, they that walk in Darkness, are Evil-doers, and Evil-doers are the Members of the false Church or Whore: For if any that walk in Darkness say they (are Members of the Church of Christ, and) have not Fellowship with him, they lye, and do not the Truth, 1 John 1.6. And so all that cannot witness in Mea∣sure Darkness to be past, are still in it, and Children of it. II. Such who have not received the Word grafted in them, yet are professing the Words, but will not come to the Word of Eternal Life, that gave forth the Words; and being astray from that, Err, not knowing the Scripture nor the Power of God, being out of the Faith of God's Elect that overcomes the Word, which Christ (the Word) is the Author and Finisher of, and is a Mystery held in a pure Conscience; and whosoever hath not this Faith, the Gates of Hell will prevail against him; and his House not being built upon this Rock (Christ the Word of
Life) in the Day of Tryal will be overturned, and great will be the Fall thereof; but the Foundation of God (for Salvation) standeth sure, that is the Ingrafted Word, that is able to save the Soul; that dwelt richly in the Children of God (in all Ages, and also in this Age) who were the Houshould of Faith, Members of the Church in God. III. To be of a Faith or Belief that is not in the Unity of the Spirit of Life but of that which Man is Author and Finish∣er of; which he hath made and formed in the House of his Ima∣ginary of the Words and Confessions of the Saints in Light, and Children of God, that were in the Faith, of that they confes∣sed and witnessed; and so in the Mystery, that they which have only the Words of the History cannot see, nor doth that reveal it to them. IV. Professing Obedience to God and Christ in Words, but living in the Disobedience of his Spirit, and so in Works deny him, doing the Things they ought not to do, and leaving the Things undone that they ought to do; these love not our Lord Jesus Christ, but are in the World's Love, which is selfish and Enmity to God, from whence proceed the Lusts that war in the Members, the Fruits of the Flesh, and being in the Flesh, can∣not please God. V. Are such, whose Head is a visible Man without them who takes in and puts out in his own Will and Pleasure; these chuse rather to obey Man then God, and cannot suffer for Righ∣teousness sake, because their Head is not Christ, the Righteous∣ness of God. VI. Such in whom the Unregenerate Nature bears Rule, and the Seed of the Serpent is Head, and the Government of Christ is not set up within; but Death through the Lusts reigns, and captivates the Soul under it, that it lives not to God, nor brings forth Fruit of Righteousness, but is the Tree that cum∣breth
the Ground, that will be hewn down, and cast into the Fire. VII. Are such, whose Weapons of their Warfare are not Spiritual, but Carnal; therefore the strong Holds of Satan are standing in them, who are Aliens and Strangers from the New Covenant, in which is no Fighter, Killer, Murtherer nor Envi∣ous Wicked Person, but the New Creation is witnessed, in which dwelleth Righteousness, the Sword turned into a Plow∣share, and the Spear into a pruning Hook, where War is learn'd no more. VIII. Such who despise and neglect the Gift of God, the Light that shines in their Hearts, the Manifestation of the Spirit that is given to every Man to profit withal, without which none can please God, nor worship him, as I have said, but are un∣profitable Servants, out of the Way of God, in their own Way, the Way of Sinners, out of the Counsel of God's Spirit in the Counsel of the Ungodly Spirit, out of the Way of Light Life, in the Way of Death and Darkness, dead to God, but alive to the World, and in the Wickedness thereof. IX. Such who are not turned to the Spirit of Truth, in which God is worshipped, cannot worship him; but (as Christ said) Ye worship ye know not what; such Worshippers are all that are astray from the Spirit of Truth, who are all false, from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same; for being out of the Spirit, out of the Truth, for the Spirit is Truth. X. Such whose Principle and Belief is, That the Ministerial Offices in the Church of Christ, are intailed to a Succession of Per∣sons, chosen in the Will of Man, as if Man were to send forth Labourers into the Lord's Vineyard, and the Lord engaged to accept their Choice; of such saith the Lord, I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran, Jer. 23.21. It is the Lord of the Harvest (as I have said) that is to send forth Labourers into his Harvest, and Man to accept the Lord's Choice, because they
come in his Name; and the Apostles prayed, and said, Thou Lord which knowest the Hearts of all Men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen: So the Chosen of God will receive none but the Lord's Choice. XI. Such who have a Form of Godliness, but denying the Power thereof, ever learning (of the Hireling, that will ever be paid for Teaching) but never able to bring them to the Knowledge of the Truth, because he himself is astray from that which gives the Infallible Knowledge of it. XII. Such who persecute and destroy Mens Lives for their Religion; thus did Cain, who was of that Wicked One, and all that do so, are of him still; for he that doth not Righteousness but hateth his Brother, is manifest to be a Child of the Devil, 1 John 3.10. And it was ever from the Beginning, the Un∣righteous persecuted the Righteous; and to be persecuted for Righteousness sake, was ever an Infallible Mark of God's Chil∣dren; and to persecute for Righteousness sake was ever an In∣fallible Mark of the Children of the Wicked One: Let none mistake me, I do not say, that all that are persecuted, are the Children of God; for Men have suffered, and may be persecu∣ted, and not for the Righteousness sake of God's Kingdom, but for their own Righteousness sake, who in their blind Zeal and Self-Will, are labouring to set up their Idol, or false Way, in Opposition to others; and others in the same opposing them; and here is one in the Beastly Nature and Will, pushing at ano∣ther in the same; and they that can get most Power and Strength in the Earth, they tear and devour the others: And if a Man give his Body to be burnt, and all his Goods to the Poor, and yet may not be accepted of God; for the Life of all true Religion is Love (for God is Love) and where that is wanting, Though a Man may speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, 'tis all but as sounding Brass or a tinckling Cymbal; for indeed, pure Religion, springs from the Nature, Vertue and Operation of the pure Spirit of God, brought forth in that Man that hath re∣ceived it, and denyes his own Will, that the Will of the Divine Nature may be done, which is come, to be done in Earth, as it
is in Heaven; and that is the Kingdom that all Men are requi∣red to seek, which whosoever receives not as a little Child, can by no Means enter into it: And blessed are all those that having received it, do suffer for its Righteousness sake: And it was ever, and still is, the greatest Blindness and Ignorance among the Sons of Men, to believe or think, that pure Religion is to be forced into by Persecution; for this I declare, They that are of that Judgment, never knew what pure Religion was; but those that will have People to come to pure Religion, must let the Light and Glory of their Religion shine forth before Men, that God's Works in them may be seen to others, that is, to do Good before all, and to all, even as the Son of God did upon Earth in his own Body, and now doth the same by his Spirit, in the Bodies of those that receive him. He that saith, he abi∣deth in him, ought himself also to walk, even as he walked, 1 Joh. 2.6. For all such that think they ought to compel People to their Religion, because they think it is true, must also judge that their Spirit is Infallible, for if it may fail, then it ought not to be a Rule to the Souls of ohers, nor a Judge of another Man's Faith or Religion, nor of the Things of God; but the Truth is, where any Force or Compulsion is put upon the Consciences of Men, that is an Infallible Sign of a Fallible and Anti-christian Spirit; for the Infallible Spirit of God in the Holy Men, left no such Rule nor Example, but commanded the contrary, saying, Let every Man be fully perswaded (or fully assured) in his own Mind, Rom. 14.5. Again saith, So then every one of us shall give an Account of himself to God, Ver. 12. For in this Case, saith Paul, Hast thou Faith? have it to thy self. Then what hath any Man to do, to Lord it over another Man's Faith; seeing he that doubteth is damned (that is, condemned in himself) because not done in Faith, it is Sin: And now you blind Hy∣pocrites, that would compel all to fall down to your Idol or I∣mage of Heavenly Things; can you give Men Faith to believe your Image hath Life, if not, do not you compel Men to sin against their Consciences, seeing what is not of Faith is Sin, Rom. 14.23. And the Devil is the Author of all Sin; and all Per∣secutors for Righteousness sake, are his Subjects, in whom the Man of Sin is unrevealed, who opposeth and exalteth himself above
all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God (mark that's he that would rule over Men's Consciences) sitteth in tqe Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God (that is, by taking that Power to himself that God never gave to any Man, that is, to force or compel People to any Worship that is not of Faith, that is Sin; and God that made Heaven and Earth is not the Author of Sin; but it is the Man of Sin, whom the Lord of Life is Consuming with the Spirit of his Mouth, and destroying with the Brightness of his Coming, 2 Thes. 2.3, 8. Objection, But some may say, Did not Christ in the Parable say, Compel them to come in. Answer, Blessed be the Lord, many do witness that Com∣pulsion (which is not Outward Force) that are come into his House, and that is by the Power of his Love (wherein he in∣vites the Poor, who receive the Gospel) that hath constrained us to deny our selves, and take up his Daily Cross, and follow him; for the Truth is to be received in the Love of it, and then it overcomes the Enmity of the Fleshly Will, and covers with the Spirit and Life, the Wedding-Garment, that the Heavenly Guests at God's Feast have put on, that no Persecutor ever knew on himself nor can be put it upon another: So they that compel, and they that are thus compelled, are both without a Wedding-Garment and not meet for the Marriage Feast: And again, the false Church that persecutes, is gone from the sound Doctrine of the Apostles, and cannot endure it: Now the Spirit of Truth, that ministred in the Apostles, hath opened the Mouthes of ma∣ny to minister, as they have freely received the Gift and sound Doctrine of Truth; and the Teachers that were heaped up by them (that were gone from the Word) after their own Lusts, cannot endure the Doctrine of the Light that manifests their Deeds of Darkness, and that which the Apostles turned the Peo∣ple to, the Teachers heaped up in Mens Wills, turn the People from; and so turn Peoples Ears from the Truth, to give Ear unto Fables, the Imaginations of the Heart, that are gone after the Lusts; and this Paul did prophesie should come to pass (as hath been, and is fulfilled) saying, For the Time will come, when they will not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own Lusts
shall they heap to themselves Teachers, having Itching Ears, and they shall turn away their Ears from the Truth, and shall be tur∣ned to Fables, 2 Tim. 4.3, 4. Here was an Apostacy prophesied of, that in the Light is seen to be fulfilled in its Time. And now by the Brightness of the Rising of the Son of Righ∣teousness, that is the Day-spring from on high, that hath visited us, and hath given Light to us that sate in Darkness, and in the Shadow of Death, and hath guided our Feet into the Way of Peace; and the Light, sown for the Righteous, Thou ands witness, Glory be to God on high for evermore: And the Un∣righteous Works of Darkness are denyed and reproved, which the Children of Light can have no Fellowship with, but are come out from them, in Obedience to the Heavenly Vision the Voice from Heaven, that is the Trumpet that hath awakened Thousands, which saith, Come out of her my People, come out of her, and partake not of her Sin, lest ye partake of her Plagues: And now the Lord hath according to his Promise, in the latter Dayes, brought us a Way we did not know (out of her) and led us in Pathes we had not walked in; and this we can say that walk in the Light, if it were the last Words that we should speak upon the Earth, that the Way we are brought to walk in (and in which the Faithful do walk) is the Way that the God of Heaven hath brought us into; let all the Earth speak what they will against it, God, that lives forever, will make it prosper to the Ends of the Earth, and the saved in this Nation, shall and do walk in it, and so shall the saved in all Nations, that is, in Christ the Light of the New Jerusalem, as it is written; And the Lord God and the Lamb is the Light thereof: And all the rotten-Principle'd Men in all Nations shall not be able to stand before, nor abide the sound Doctrine of the Word of Life, that is Juick and powerful, and a Discerner of the Thoughts and Intentions of the Heart, except they come to the Hour of his Judgment, and be judged as Men in the Flesh, that they may be quickned by the second Adam, and live to God in the Spirit: And now being led out from among them (that are in the Filthiness of the Flesh) by the Spirit of the Lord, and touching no unclean Thing, the Lord hath received us, and is a blessed Father unto
his Sons and Daughters, that he hath begotten unto himself, by an Immortal Seed, the Word of Life, that liveth and abideth sorever. And now those pretended Fathers in God, who are called Lords Spiritual, which Title the Bishops made by the Holy Ghost, Overseers of the Flock of God, never received, not owned, nor ever will; and had you been our Fathers indeed, who had begotten us in God, we should have been your most dear and dutiful Children, in all the Commands of Christ through you; but you know by whom you were made, but not by whom we are begotten; for if you did we believe you would not labour to destroy us, as some of you have done, and still do (but for such, we desire that the Lord would forgive you, and shew you what you do) but not to convince us by sound Doctrine, but by the Instruments of foolish Shepherds do you war against us, sh as they use whom you your selves account Anti christian, as well as we; for such that think the Way to save Souls, is to afflict, punish and kill the Body, have not re∣ceived the Truth, as it is in Jesus, nor the sound Wisdom from above, Which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easie to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits; for the Fruit of Righteousness is sown in Peace mark that but the Fruit of Un∣righteousness is sown in Fightings, Beatings, Stockings, Sto∣nings, Banishings, Imprisonings, Finings, Robbing and Spoil∣ing of Goods, destroying of Families, by making many Wid∣dows and Fatherless-Children: Is this the Way to bring Peo∣ple to the Kingdom of God? then the Apostles were much mistaken; for they never made Use of this Way, but the con∣trary; for these Things were ued against them by those that knew not God; but those that have received the Spirit of Christ (are Christ's) and know the Apostles were not mistaken; but it is you that are mistaken in suffering the Spirit of the World to bear Rule in you, and that take to it the Honours and Preferments of the World, that are but Temporal, and so in the World are Lords many, but in the Church of Christ one God and one Lord, the great Shepherd and Bishop of his Soul, who gives many Bishops or Overseers, but no Lords, as
the Apostle saith, But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all Things, and we by him, 1 Cor. 8.6. And those who are by him now gathered out of the World (that lyeth in VVickedness) and have received the Spirit of Truth, cannot but stand Witnesses against those that are of the World who receive and give Honour one to another, and would be account∣ed sent of God, to rule in his House, which is the Church of the Living God, 1 Tim. 3.15. But such manifest themselves by taking the World that lyeth in Wickedness, to be the Church, the House of God, and so make all the Nation to be of their Church, except such they have cast out, which for the most Part are such that are gathered of Christ out of the World; So that all the Thieves, Murderers, VVhore∣mongers, Adulterers, Whores, Drunkards, Swearers, Cur∣sers, Lyars, and all People of all Sorts, that will hea, and pay you, both Papists, and all Sects and Sorts, you account are of your Church, except such you cast out, as I have said, so that Babylon, and Egypt, and Sodom and all is here by you taken to be the Church of Christ, the House of God; what a House have you provided for the living God to dwel in the midst of? What a Church is here? Is this the Pillar and Ground of the Truth? Do these hold the Mystery of Faith in a pure Conscience? Or rather, doth not the Mystery of Iniquity hold them in a defiled One? But if they will hear the Priest, and pay him (as I have said) let them believe or hold what they will, all is received of the Church: Oh! what a foul House is here for those you would force to dwell in, who are called out to touch no Unclean Thing? What a Bo∣dy have you prepared for that glorious Head to be joyned to, that is separate from Sinners, and made higher then the Hea∣vens? Was not here sufficient Cause for the People spiri∣tually gathered to come out from among you? Do you put a Difference between the Precious and the Vile? Yes, you do; for the Precious you curse out, and deliver to Sa∣tan, though some of them were never of you, nor owned you.
And you have heaped up such a Company of your spiri∣tual Children to reform your Church, who are so Zealous for God Mammon, that for Non-Payment of a Groat or two, they cast out a Man, and deliver him to Satan; so it seems, a Groat or two by them is more prized, then the Soul of a Man  yea, or his Body, Life and Family, that they can de∣liver them to Prisons, to the ruining of Families; but as to their delivering to Satan, it is past their Spiritual Skill in Re∣ality, who are erred and strayed from the Power of God, which is the Way of God, and that Power gives them Victory over Satan that are turned to it, and so their Satan is some Goaler, a Member of their own Body; it is like they may be conscious to themselves that they have not spiritual Power to bind and loose the Souls of Men; and therefore they will be sure to bind the Body in some nasty Hole or Pri∣son; but if Money come, then Soul and Body and all shall be loosed and blest into their Church again, though he be of the worser Sort to Men. These Practices savour more of a Synagogue of Satan, then a Church of God; for the Church of God, that abides in the Doctrine of Christ, and is a sweet Savour to God and all Just Men that live by Faith; but these are a Stink in his Nostrils, and an Ill Savour to all sober minded Men, and one of the greatest Grievances in the Nation, that is to say, the Spiritual Courts, so called, that are yet of the World, and cannot overcome the Flesh nor the Devil; these pretend to cast People out of that which they were ever in themselves, to wit, the Church of God: And some being cast out of their Church once, and delivered to Satan (as they pretend) which in Truth is but the delivering of the Body to the Envy and Cruelty of that persecuting oppressing Spirit that dwells in their Adversaries) and these that could never come to them to be restored, yet have cast them out the second Time, and some the third, for not coming to their Church, which was contra∣ry to their own Law: Was ever such Non-sensical Work acted by Men pretending to reform the Church? Is not Ho∣seah's Prophecy fulfilled upon them, as it was upon Israel, when they went a whoring from their God, and loved
Reward, The Dayes of Visitation are come, the Dayes of Re∣compence are come, Israel shall know it, the Prophet is a Fool, the Spiritual Man is mad; for the Multitude of thine Ini∣quity and the great Hatred, Hosea 9.7. What Prophets were they that were Fools in Hoseah's Dayes? those that prophecied, and the Lord never sent them, who had not received the Word of the Lord, but told the People their Dream for a Reward, upon every Corn flor; but the true Prophets, that had received the Word, spake it or preached it freely, as the Lord said, He that hath my Word, let him speak my Word freely, what is the Chff to the Wheat? The Word is the Wheat; the Chaff is what he preacheth that hath not re∣ceived the Word, that is but the Divination of his own Brain and these were the Fools that had not received the Word of Wisdom from above, that is fist pure, the peaceable; but the foolish Prophets, that prophesied for a Reward, he that re∣snsed to put into their Mouthes, they prepared War against them. Were these foolish and false in the Dayes of the Children of Israel, and can those that walk in their Steps be true in this Age? Nay, for the Testimony of the Spirit of God was against such in all Ages, and so it is against them in this Age: Were they fasse then that preached or proplie∣sied, and had not received the Word? so they are now: Were they false then that prophesied for a Reward in every Corn-floor? and are they not so now, that preach for a Re∣ward in every Corn-field? Was the false Prophet then as the Snare of a Fowler in all his Wayes, and Hared against the House of his God? and is he not so now? All that have esca∣ped the Snare know, the Lord hath delivered them out of the Mouthes of the false Shepherds, according to his Premise, and hath exalted the Mountain of his House above their Mountains, and above all Hills, and thither he hath gathered, and is gathering his People in this Nation, and will gather them in all Nations into this House of the Lord, where there is Bread enough; and the false Prophets, and foolish blind Priests in this Age, are in Hatred against this House of the Lord of Hosts, and against the Gatherings of his People in it, and the Flewings together of the Nations unto it, according to the Word of the
Lord; but the Work of the Lord doth prosper, and will prosper, and all Opposers of it (except they repent) will perish; for the false Shepherds shall howl, and their Pastere shall be spoiled, For you have despised and rejected the Counsel of the great Shepherd and Bishop of the Soul, and are Opposers of the Work of his Spirit in his People, who have received the Truth, the Spi∣rit of Christ, And if any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, as the Apostle saith; and those that walk in the Obedience of the Measure of his Spirit, you have hated and persecuted; and some of you being fill'd with Envy against them, have turned informers, like Judas, that informed against Christ for Money; after he had betrayed the Truth in himself, the De∣vil entered, and fitted him with Envy, to come against Christ and his Disciples, where they were assembled, to betray them into the Hands of their Enemies; and hath not Envy filled some of your Hearts, and so fitted you to inform against the Assem∣blies gathered in the Name and Spirit of Christ, as some of you have done, and have sworn against them; and one confest before the Magistrate, that he did not know that ever he had seen some of their Faces before, and yet some time before had sworn they were at the Meeting; but all must be construed for the Purpose, that is to spoil the Goods of those that cannot forsake the assembling of themselves together in the true Worship of God. And some of you have procured Warrants to spoil the Goods of your Neighbours, and some have spoiled them over and over, and prosecuted those that would not spoil them: Is this the Way to teach the People to Love their Neighbours as themselves, and to do to all People as they would be done unto? this is the Way indeed to manifest what Spirit you are of; and so People may read your Father's Name in your Forehead's, whose Works do you do, what Spirit leads you, whether the Spirit of Cain that wicked One, or the Spirit of Abel the Righteous One? by your Fruits you are known: Doth the Work of this Spirit con∣fess that Christ is come in your Flesh, that Righteous One; or Anti-christ, that Wicked One, whom Christ is Consuming with Breath of his Mouth, and the Brightness of his oming? Was it ever known that a Minister of Christ was an Informer against Christian Meetings? no, it never was, nor ever will be; for such
are not in the Doctrine of Christ, but in the Practice of those the Scripture calls Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing; but in this Work of Informing, the Wolf only appears, that comes to devour; so that Spirit that preacheth for Hire, is the same that spoils Men's Goods for Hire; and he that takes Wages of Unrighte∣ousness, doth the Work of Unrighteousness; Did not those that devoured Widows Houses, do the Work of Unrighteousness, though for a Pretence made long Prayers? and those were Ene∣mies to Christ then, and can they be Friends now? no, such are an ill Savour to God, and a Stink in his Nostrils; what have such to do to take his Name into their Mouthes who hate to be reformed by his Spirit, and persecute those that are? How ma∣ny Souls are you guilty of the Blood of? And how many Bo∣dies have you cast into Prison till Death? How many Widdows and Fatherless Children have you made in this Nation, because they could not put into your Mouthes, knowing what Spirit you were of; and that the Lord never sent you, as by your Fruits you have manifested to the View of the Nation? and Thousands see you, and will buy your Merchandize no more; and if you can∣not compel them by your Law, then you make Merchandize and Spoil of their Goods. But Wo is unto you, that ever you were born, because of the terrible Day that is coming upon you, which you can no wayes escape, but by coming out of her, in whom is found all the Blood of the Saints and Martyrs, and all that have been slain (for the Testimony of Jesus) upon the Earth. For now the Everlasting Gospel is preaching, that shall be preached to all Nations, Tongues and Languages, for the gather∣ing of the Gentiles to their Light, and Israel to the Hope of their Glory: For to him shall the Gathering of the People be, and the Gentiles shall walk in thy Light, and Kings in the Brightness of thy Rising; then thou shall see and shine, thy Heart shall be asto∣nished and enlarged, because the Multitude of the Sea shall be con∣verted unto thee, and the Riches of the Gentiles shall come unto thee, Isa. 60.3.5. For the Lord shall be thy Everlasting Light, and thy God thy Glory, Ver. 19. Thy People also shall be all Righteous, they shall possess the Land forever; the Graft of my planting shall be the Work of mine Hands, that I may be glorified; a little One
shall become a Thousand, and a small One as a strong Nation, I the Lord will hasten it in due Time. And this is that Jerusalem prophesied of, that should be a Burthensom Stone unto all Nations (which is become a burthen∣some Stone in this Nation) but all that burthen themselves with it shall be broken in Pieces by it; and how many have been bro∣ken in Pieces by it, that opposed it in this Nation? and all that yet shall oppose it in this or any other Nation, shall be broken in Pieces and confounded by it, except they repent and be ga∣thered into it; for God is making his little One to become a Thousand, and his small One a strong Nation; and these are his holy Nation, and peculiar People, and spiritual Priesthood, that are gathered out of the Flesh, where none can please God, into the Spirit of his Son, where all walking do please him; and these cannot please Men; for the Gift that God hath given (that Man is to receive if he please God) the VVisdom of the Flesh did alwayes reject in all Ages, and so it doth in this; and it was a stumbling Stone and a Rock of Offence to the VVise and Prudent of this World among the Jews in that Age, disallowed of Men, but chosen of God, elect and precious to those that believe, both Jews and Gentiles in all Ages, a tryed Corner-Stone, the Power of God to all those that receive it, who through Obedience of it become the Sons and Daughters of God. And now I warn all in this Nation that profess Christianity, to consider your Wayes, whether you are entered in at the straight Gate, and whether you walk in the narrow VVay, that only leads to Life; for out of it there is no Salvation: And God is risen to overturn every false VVay in this the Day of his Power, in which the VVay of the VVicked shall be turned upside down, but the VVay of the Lord shall be exalted, which as the Apostle saith, Is the New and Living Way, the New Covenant of Light to the Gentiles, that is Israel's Hope of Glory, which is Christ the Spirit of Truth and VVord of Life in Man, that whosoever receives and walks in, is of God, and come out of the VVorld; but he that receives it not, is not past from Darkness, but is un∣der the Power of it, in the VVorld that lyeth in VVickedness, where God is not pleased; but as many as have received the VVord in their Hearts, and in it believe, are grafted by Faith into Christ, the Root, the Vine and Power of Life, the incorrupti∣ble
Seed, the Word of God that liveth and abideth for ever, and because he liveth, all in him are made alive to God again; and these walk in him, that is, his Spirit, that God the Father hath given to lead them into all Truth (and out of him none can please God, nor walk in his Truth) and these be his Disciples in this Age, that have received him the VVord, and for the Obedience of him the World hates them, as it doth him, and now perse∣cutes him in his Members, as he said they would, and we witness his Word fulfilled in us; but in his Spirit we have Victory over the World and their Spirit, because he that we have received (the Word, the Spirit of Truth) in us, is greater then he that is in in the World; and that Spirit that is in the World is now making ar against the Spirit which we have received, and is in us that are not of the World: And here is the Lamb's War against the Beast and the false Prophet: And as sure as John saw the Beast and the false Prophet overcome, taken alive, and cast into the Lake of Fire, so sure shall we overcome in his Spirit, that hath overcome in his own Body the World, the Flesh and the Devil, and now is revealed in us to overcome for us, in whom we have good Comfort, and in the Faith see that Spirit that makes War against us (in Priests and Professors, and all persecuting Rulers and Magistrates) shall be overcome; and all that come not out of that Spirit, but continue in it, in the Hatred and War to the End, will be cast into the Lake of Fire, as John saw in the Revelation of the Spirit of Truth that cannotlye. Therefore I warn you all, to hear the Voice of the Spirit of Truth that calls to you from Heaven to come out of her, in whom all the Blood is found, that is, that Spirit that persecuted the Church of God in all Ages, the Spirit of the World that rules in the Children of Disobedience, that is he that is in the World, and the World are in it that is, all that have not recei∣ved the Spirit of Christ, are they that are none of his; but they that have received his Spirit, are they that the World hates, as he said it should be; for as he is not of the World, so all in him (that is, his Spirit) are not of the World. And now let all consider what Spirit they are joyned to; For they that are joyned to the Lord are one Spirit; but they that are joyned to the Harlot (the False Spirit, or False Prophet) are one Body, whatever they do profess for a Religion it matters not;
for Hypocrites in all Ages were such that said, and did not, and so they are now, that call themselves Christians, and are not in Christ's Spirit; for as saith the Apostle, If any Man say he is in him, he ought himself to walk even as he walked; and he that is not in Christ's Spirit is no Christian; but professing Christ's Life, and living after the Flesh, is in Hypocrifie; and the Life of Christ in his People judgeth that, and condemns that Religion, and declares that Life to be Anti∣christian, and but the Birth of the Flesh, that persecutes him that is born of the Spirit; and though that Birth by its great Pro∣fession may have a Name to live, and be persecuted for its Name, yet having not the Nature of Christ to be its Life, cannot hold out to the Death, but must give Way, and flee before their Ene∣mies into Holes and Corners, because they are not come to the Power of God in themselves, that is he that is greater then he that is in the World: And therefore all you great Professors that are against the Light of Christ in you, in which Power is received to become the Sons of God, and over come the World, you are overcome by him that is in the VVorld, and he makes you leave your great licensed Meeting houses to the Bats and the Owls, that love the Light Natural no more then you do the Spiritual, as of late in many Places you have done; and so your Gatherings in the Imaginati∣ons of your own Brains, come to be scattered according to the Ima∣ginations of your Enemies, who have not therein imagined a vain or ineffectual Thing against you, but they see they have against those that the Lord gathered out of Darkness into his marvelous Light: But if you were not blind, you might see that you are not gather∣ed in the Name, that is, the Power of God, the Rock that God built his Church upon in all Ages, that the Gates of Hell might not pre∣vail against them: Cannot you see what Power it is that scatters you, what Spirit and Power is it that leads the Informers, which for the most Part are the wickedest of Men? Is it not he that led Judas the Informer, whem the Rulers paid, and the Devil set at Work? and you in your Anti-christian Prudence flee before; for Christian Prudence leads to do that which is given of Christ to do; for as it is given to believe, so also to suffer for his sake, in whom we have believed: But where the Gift of God is not received, there true Faith is not witnessed, but Flesh and Blood is consulted withal, that never led to do the Will of God; but he that suffered himself,
and in it did the Will of God, is the Leader of all his that suffer for Righteousness sake; for they that will not suffer with him, cannes reign with him over that Spirit that makes War against him, which is to be conquered by Suffering; for that Spirit that leads to decline a publick Testimony, and to flee from Suffering & Persecution for Righteousness sake, is one with that Spirit which persecutes; for that Spirit that leads to persecute the Children of Truth, can never lead to suffer for the Truth; for it is out of it: So that it is clear, that Spirit that leads to run from Persecution, when they have Power, will lead them to persecute, as in New-England doth appear, by such who could not suffer for their Religion, but joyned to the Power of Darkness, and persecuted to Death the Children of Light that could; so they have conquered that Spirit, and their Life doth tread that Religion under Foot; for its but Cain's Sa∣crifice, without Faith that worketh by Love, which the Spirit of the Lord loathes, being in that Spirit that slew his Brother, in which they preached, that shall be ashamed of their Gospel, not being the Power of God to Salvation; for if it were, they that hear, and they that preach it would not flee before the Power of Satan; but where he that saves the Soul is not received, he that kills the Body will be feared; and so the Counsel of Christ being rejected, his Command∣ment comes to be transgressed; and thus the Wind that purifies and winnows the Wheat, blows the Chaff unto the Dunghil: So they that cannot stand in Time of Tryal, declare themselves to be but Chaff, that the Wind blows too and fro, for if the Waity Life dwell not within, such Mens Religion is but a foolish Thing; for he that saith, VVithout me you can do nothing, is he that is come that all might have Life and Power to do the Will of God, and he that hath received him, hath Life and Power to do the Will of God, and so becomes a Child of God; but he that hath him not, hath not Life nor Power to do the Truth, and that Mans Religion is vain: So it is clear, that all those that deny Christ, the Light, to be come in Spirit within, are Anti-christian, as well as they that denyed him come in the Flesh, and such are not of God. Given forth in the Love of him, who would have all Men to be saved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth This 3d of the 2d Moneth, 1675. M. W.
The Prophecy of John Hus; Prophesying of the Reformation of the CHƲRCH. THE Church (he saith) cannot be reduced to her former Dignity and reformed, before all Things first be made new, the Truth whereof appeareth by the Temple of Solomon, as well the Clerks and Priests, as also the People and Laity; or else except all such as now be addicted to Avarice, from the least to the most, be first converted and renewed, as well the People, as the Clerks and Priests, Things cannot be reformed. Albeit, as my Mind now giveth me, I believe rather the first, that is, that then shall rise a New People, formed after the New Man, which is created after God; of the which People New Clerks and Priests shall come forth and be taken, who all shall hate Covetousness and Glory of this Life, labouring to an Heavenly Conversation; notwith∣standing all these Things shall be done and wrought in Continu∣ance and Order of Time, dispenced of God for the same Purpose; and this God doth, and will do, of his own Goodness and Mercy for the Riches of his Patience and Sufferance, giving Time and Space of Repentance to them that have long lain in their Sins, to amend and flee from the Face of the Lord's Fury, until at length all shall suffer together, and until both the Carnal People, and Priests, and Clerks in Process and Order of Time, shall fall away, and be consumed, as is the Cloth consumed and eaten of the Moth. THE END.
