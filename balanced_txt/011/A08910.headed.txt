Here begynneth the pardon or chartre of heuyns blys, EVery wyse man that cle or desyreth this heauenl  asketh great pardō / kepe  ¦sely and hath oft mynd vpō the charter of his chalēge / & thelore ech man lerne to lyue vertuously / and kepe & haue mynd vpon the chartre of heuens blys / & study busely & stedfastly ye wyt of this bul for the perdō therof shal dure wtoute end therfore vnderstād thou well that ye char¦tre of this heritage / & the bul of this euer lastīg pardō / is our lord Iesu christ writ¦tē with al the myght & vertu of god / The parchemēt of this heuēly chartre / is ney∣ther of sheep / ne of calfe / but it is the body & the skyn of our lord Iesu christ ye lamb / that neuer was spotted with wem or spot of syn. & there was neyther skyn of sheep neyther of calfe / so sore & so hard strayned on ye teyntur / eyther harow of any parche¦mēt maker / as was ye blessed body & skyn of our lord Iesu Christ / for our lyfe strey¦ned
& drawen vpō the yebet of the crosse. And ther neuer man herde fro the begyn∣nynge of the worlde / tyll nowe / neyther shal vntyll domes day / that euer wrytes wrote vpō shepes skyn / eyther on calues with so hard & hydous pēnys: so bytter so sore or so depe / as writtē the cursed Iues vpon the blessed body & swete skyn of our Lorde Iesu Christ / with hard nayles & sharp spere / & sore pryckynge thornes in stede of theyr pēnys: for they wrote them so sore & so depe / that they perced his han¦des and fete with hard nayles / & opened his hart with a sharpe spere / and pressed vpon his hed a crowne of sharpe thornes that lyghtly perced his brayne pan. The woundes vpon that blessed body & swete skyn of our Lorde Iesu Christ / were in stede of letters / & as clerkes sayen & spe∣cially saynt Ancelme, that there were opē woūdes vpon the blessed body of Christ by nombre / fyue. M.CCCC.lxxv. this is the nombre of the letters / with which our chartre was wrytten / by the whiche
chartre we may clayme our herytage (yf we lyue ryghteously and kepe this char∣tre stedfastly in mynde). The sentence and vnderstandyng wrytten within and without this blessed chartre / and body of our Lorde Iesu Christ / is our beleue. For he is the cofer / in whom is closen & locken all the treasure / wyt & wysdom of god. Also vpon this blessed chartre was wrytten / waylyng & mournynge / songe & sorow / for sorow of our synnes: for the which sinnes to be heled & wasshē away / Christ god and mā must suffre so hard & paynfull woundes: Vpō Christes body that is our heuēly chartre / was wrytten sygnifieng to al tho that perfytly forsakē their synnes: for they han full medecyn & helth through vertu of the bytter woun∣des & precious blood of Iesu. And vpon the woūdes of Iesu / maye be red sorow to al them that for fals lust & lykyng that dureth but a whyle / byndē thē self so sore to synne & seruage of the fende / & lesen, the helpe of theyr heuenly chartre & so theyr
herytage & wēden or go blyndly to sorow that dureth for euer. The lacys of this heuēly chartre / ben behestys of god / and that god may not lye / for he is souerayne truth. The fyrst lace is his behestys / that what day or ower a synful man or womā leueth their syn / holy & hertly with bitter sorow & tourne them to him / he shall re∣ceyue them to his mercy. But yche man beware that he tary not to longe / lest for his owne vnkyndnes / grace be taken fro him. The second lace is the ful trust that we han or haue / that god may not lye / ne ther be fals of his behestes: & here in han¦geth syckerly the trust of our herytage: & by these two lacys / hāgeth the sele of our charter / seled with the bloud of the lambe Christ: that is Christes flesshe / taken of the clenest dropes of bloud / in the swetest virgyn Mary / more craftely and merue¦lously / than euer any may be by craft of kynde / gather the wax of floures of the felde. The prynt of this sele / is the shap of our lorde Iesu christ / hangyng on the
crosse for our synnes / as we may se by the Image of the Crucyfyx: for he hath his hed bowed downe / redy to kys all those that verely turne to him. Also he hath his armys spred abrode / redy to be clyp them and he is nayled to the cros fast / both fete and handes: for he wyll dwell with them and neuer wende away from them: but if they forsake him fyrst / through syn. And he hath al his body spred abrode / to gyue him selfe holly to vs cleuyng to him / and verely he hath his syde openyd / & his hert clouen for our sake: so yt without lettyng we must crepe into his herte & rest there thorow stedfast beleue & herty loue This charter may no fyer bren / ne water drēch or drowne / neither thefe robbe / neyther any creature destroy. For this scrypture the father of heuen hath halowed / eyther made stedfast / and sent it into the worlde the which scrypture may not be vndo / as the gospel wytnesseth. This scripture is our lord Iesu christes Charter and Bul of our herytage of heuen. Locke not this
chartre in thy cofer / but set it ether wryts it in thy hert / & all the creatures in heuen neither in erth / neither in hell / maye not rob it / neither bren it from the / but if thou wylt thy selfe / assentyng to syn. And if thou kepest well this Charter in the cofer of thy hert / with good lyuyng and deuout loue / lastingly to the end / as trustly & trewly / as he is true god. Tho∣row vertu of this Charter / thou shalt ha¦ue thy herytage of blys / that lasteth with outen ende. Now therfore hast we to pe∣nauns / as saynt Austen byddeth / and the last day be euer afore our eyen. Refrayne we our bodyes from byces & euyll couey¦tynges / & euer let our hertes thynke he∣uenly thynges / that whan we come thy∣ther / we vse fully heuēly goodes: for why we beleue / that whan our soule shalbe vn¦knytted from the bonde of flesshe. If we han or haue lyued wel & rightfully before god / anon the cōpany of angels shal com into our metynges / & they shall bryng vs with worshyp to the very domysman.
If that we han lyued as I sayd / than peace shalbe to vs & sykernes in compas Than we shall not drede the fyry dartes of the deuyll / neither any other maner e∣nemy that cometh to hurt our soules. The flesshe shall no more be aduersary to the spirite / neither we shall drede any perels. Than the holy ghost shal gyue to vs a dwellyng in heuenly thinges / & we glad in ioyfull / & shall abyde the daye of dome to com / in which the soules of al mē shall receyue meed for their deedes. And than shal synners and vnpytefull men pe¦rysshe. But in that day vayne men & ra¦uenours / gredy men & proud men / auou¦tres & wrathfull / coueteus / cursers and forsworne men shall wepe most bytterly / and they shal not get forgyuenes of their euels / which left not their sīnes with byt∣ter sorow in their lyfe. In most waylyng they shall be holden / which seruyden to vnlefull lustes of the flessh / and they shal be in mournynge and eueuerlastyng so∣row which serueden to vyces / eyther vn∣reasonable
desyres. And as all these shal be worthy to be ordeyned / to the fyre of hell for theyr synnes / & theyr great tres∣paces. So if we please God here / whyle we ben in body we shal take euerlastyng reward with sayntes. Therfore despyse we all thynges that be vayne & fallyng / that we may get so great glory of Christ doyng mercy: therfore bowe we awaye fro vyces / and go we to vertues and let not superflue wordes come out of our mouth. For we shal yeld rekenyng in the day of dome of all ydel wordes. Neyther make we our tong to haue custom to cur¦syng / which tonge is formed to bles and herrie or prayse God. For all thynges what euer is vnmesured / maketh dysso∣lucyon of soule / & neglygent agaynst the lordes hestes. Neyther he may lyghtely clepe or call his trespasces to mynd / and so forgettynge him selfe / styreth not him selfe to penaūce / & so by lytell & lytell he passeth fro goodnes / & he shall not haue true cōpunccyō of hert / where vnleful co¦uetous
dwelleth. But sothly where tea∣res shal be / there goostly fyre is kendled / which lyghteneth the preuyties of soule / and sheweth to it heuenly thynges. Ther¦fore vse thou the felowshyp of parfyt mē and turne thou not away thyne eares fro theyr wordes / for the wordes of men dre¦dynge god / ben wordes of lyfe and holy∣nes of soule to them that heere and per∣ceyue them. For as the son rysynge / dry∣ueth away the myst / so the teachynge of holy men casteth away darcknesse of our hertes. Therfore I besech you / eschew proude men / enuyous men / backbyters / lyers / forsworen men / and men despy∣syng theyr helth / which ben deed in ver∣tues / and ioye in theyr owne lustes and want goddes goodes. I say not only of them that ben in thyne house / but also where euer thou shalt heere such / eschew thē / & comune not with such men / if thou mayst not agayn clepe or call them from theyr errour: for why / oft by one scabbed sheep / all the flocke is defyled. And a ly¦tel
part of gal turneth moch sweetnes in¦to bytternes. For though such a mā / seme to the clere in clothīg & noble in bringing forth of swete wordes. Neuertheles if he doth the cōtrary warkes / such faynyng of him noyeth more / thā fygure eyther shap pleaseth of wordes / & euery warke that thou thynkest to do fyrst / thynke thou on god / & examyne diligently / if that thing which thou thynkest / be of god / and if it is ryghtfull before God / perfourme it / & els cut it away fro thy soule / and beware of ech wyckednes and syn / in word / dede and thought / in hādes / & in fete / in sight & in heryng / & kepe we our body & soule for Iesu Christ our lorde god / the son of god the father that came downe from he∣uen to erth / he steyd vpon the crosse / and dyed for vs synners to delyuer vs fro tur¦mentynge of the deuyll / he suffred payne to delyuer vs fro euerlastynge payne / he suffred deth that we agayne ryse in body & soule / in the last day of the great dome And therfore it is sayd of the fyrst church
that one herte / one wyll / one soule / is to them in the lord. For the charite and loue Christ had coupled them into one / and so must all Christen men / if they wylen be saued. But flesshely men & louers of this worlde ben departed agaynst them selfe / and ben vnioyned / mouynge sclaunders ech to other / stryues / wrathes / chidyngs dissencyons / manslaughters / forsweryn∣ges / theftes / rauenous / lecheries / dron∣kenesses / & all thynges which the worlde loueth and the flessh. Of whō the Apostle sayth: He that soweth in the flessh / shall repe corruption. In suche it is that the deuyl soweth his sedes / forsoth our flessh wold euer be mighty in malice / but in ab¦stinence fastynges / & wakynges & pray∣ers / & good workes / it fayneth it selfe to be syck / but the flessh coueyteth & sheweth euer euyll entysynge / the flesshe stereth venemous doyng / the flesh clepeth wrath the flesshe stereth mansleynge / the flesshe breketh matrymony / the flessh sytteth in dronkennesse / the flesshe beareth all the
couetousnes of this world / and the flessh desyreth all the euyls. O thou wretched flesshe / not only thou sleyest thy selfe but also thy soul: thy owne losse suffyseth not to thy self / but that also thy soule be dren¦ched or drouned into hel. Wo to the soule which hath taken the flessh / contrary to the which nether entreth / nether suffreth the to entre into the kyngdome of god. Wherfore as Christ sayth: it behoueth to wake & to pray. Lord / make yu my soul to haue glorye in the / that vaynglory & bost come not out of me / but that bytternes of syn be aswaged. Also lorde / gyue me gra¦ce to hold rightwisnes in all thīges / gost¦ly hardynes / temperans / & make symple¦nes to be prudent in me / that I may lede a clenly blessed lyfe / & prudently flye euel and that I maye vnderstand the trecher∣rouse and the desemblynge falsnes of the deuell / lest he begyle me vnder lyknes of goodnes. Also make me to holde & kepe these thinges: mylde / wel wyllyng / pea∣syble / bonner / temperate / and to accorde
to all goodnes. Without faynyng / make me stedfast and stronge / in wakynge / in fasting / and in prayers, And also lorde / geue thou to me / in myldnes to be mesu∣red in worde / that I kepe sylens / that I speke that thing that besemeth me to spe∣ke / and that I hold styll that thinge that besemeth not to speke. Geue me grace to kepe thy faith vndefyled without any er∣rour in my workes / to be worthy of faith All these sentences saith saint Austen in his boke to the Earle, HOC FAC ET VIVES. ☞ Do this / and thou shalt lyue. ☞ Imprynted at London in saynt Se∣pulchres paryssh / in the old Bayly by Rychard Lant / for Iohn̄ Gough / dwellyng at Smartes kay besyde byllynges gate Cum priuilegio ad imprimendum solū.
