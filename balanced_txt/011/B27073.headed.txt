WORDS for a Musical Entertainment AT THE New-Theatre, IN LITTLE LINCOLNS INN Fields; ON The Taking of Namur, AND His Majesty's Safe Return. Set to Music by Mr. John Eccles. Written by Mr. Motteux. HAste, Loyal Britons, haste, prepare; William, Victorious William comes. Sound, sound ye Trumpets, beat ye Drums; A Martial Sound best greets a Martial Ear. Haste, Loyal Britons, haste, prepare; William Victorious William comes. How glorious is the Hero's Fate! As angry Winds encrease a Flame, His Foes but fight to raise his Fame; And Lewis gain'd but to make William great. How glorious is the Hero's Fate!
Lo! Namure, which a Pow'r immense Outdid it self to conquer and to fence, Tho throng'd with fierce defying Gauls, To William yields its boasted Walls. In vain its threatning Champions forward move; Like Mars He dares, and strikes like Jove. See! numberless they come, all Gallia takes the Field! He Looks, They fly; He storms, They yield. Thus, Peace and Freedom to bestow, With Thought He orders, and performs with Flame: Fate by his Prudence takes its Aim, And by his Valour strikes the Blow. Proud Lewis, from this Aera date thy fall:These 4 lines ae not Sung. He who thus conquer'd, soon may conquer all; Yet toyls but for the World's Repose; And Tyrants are his only Foes. Grand Chorusâ–ª Hail! Glorious Monarch Britain's Pride, Europe's Prop the World's Delight! Thus ev'ry year triumphant ride, Till Peace and Freedom crown thy Right. FINIS.
