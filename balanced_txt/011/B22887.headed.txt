Curteous Reader, THE Ensuing Testimonies are ten∣derly recommended to thy seri∣ous Perusual, with an earnest desire thou may'st Read them in Meekness, and the Fear of God; and if a Parent, wait upon the Lord in his Ho∣ly and Heavenly Gift, to receive that Wisdom which is truly profitable to di∣rect thee, and to endue with a right Understanding, and a godly Care and Zeal to Train up thy Child in the Fear of God, and Admonition of the Lord; and not only to Admonish thy Child to that which is Good, and not to follow or delight in the foolish Fashions and vain Dresses of the evil World, but also while under thy care to Feed, Cloth and Provide for, to restrain from those things which are unbecoming the Truth and our holy Profession thereof, and not to lay out and exspend thy Substance which God hath made thee a Steward of, to gratifie that mind in thy Child, which thou hast known and felt the Judgment of
the Lord to be executed upon in thy self, because it was not subject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be; and therefore ought not to be given way unto in thy Child, nor comply'd with by thee, least thou become guilty of thy Childs hurt, to the dishonour of Truth, and thy own Grief; but rather then thus humour thy Child, let the like care be on thee, as was upon our Deceased Friend, who on his dying-Bed, Desired that his Child should be brought up in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, and Educa∣ted in the Plain and Decent parts or things that belong to a Woman, But upon a need∣less Seam, nor any thing Superfluous, not to lift her Hand to do, for that, said he, will bring Dishonour to the blessed Truth, and be a Burden to the Simple-hearted: Observe the Godly Care of this good Man: Oh, that many Parents may be fil∣led with the like Godly Care and zeal for the Education of their tender Off-spring. And now, oh, Curteous Reader, if thou art young, and not yet become the Parent of Children, Read in Serious∣ness, and the Fear of God, the following Testimony concerning these young Mai∣dens,
who may be truly esteemed as wise Virgins, and such that had more regard to the inward then the outward Adorn∣ing, whereby they became so Comly, and their Conversation so Commendable and Examplary, that Sarah Featherstone, its said, was not one that had only a Love to faithful Friends, and their Reli∣gious Meetings, but also when there, was preserved out of Drowsiness, Sleepiness and Heaviness, (which over took the fool∣ish Virgins, so that their Lamps went out, and they were unfit to enter with the Bride-Groom) but she sat in Meetings in a sweet frame of Spirit, and was often tendred in the Meetings, a thing very commend∣able in Young and Old: She also when she was sent abroad to be Educated, was careful to improve her Time, a thing worthy of Praise and of thy Observa∣tion; for with Grief may it be said, there are too many Children, that when their Parents send them abroad to be Educa∣ted, and are at great Charge and Ex∣pence by reason thereof, they too to much neglect that which their Parents send them forth to Learn, and in Play, Wildness and Idleness squander away
their pretious Time, often talking what Portions they have, or their Parents can give them, and observing what this and the other wears, and how this and the other Dresses themselves, and then endea∣vour to do the like, and thus stir up one another to that which is Evil; and some∣times by giving way to this Evil mind, come to have a proud Look, which is an Abomination to the Lord, and a Lying Tongue, which he hates. Oh, therefore who-ever thou art, which Reads these and the following Lines, consider seriously these things, and remember thou must Dye and come to Judgment; and though thou art Young, yet knowest not how soon thy change may come, and thy Body must return to the Dust, and become Meat for the Worms: Therefore while time lasts improve it, and mind the Grace and good Spirit of God in thy own Heart, hearken and return at the Reproofs of it, that thou may'st know and be led in the way of Life, and become a Comfort to thy Parents, and a Companion of them that fear the Lord, and rejoycing to thy Friends, who have no greater Joy then to behold their Children walking in the
Truth, the which Truth and Spirit of it, if thou wilt love and obey, it will lead thee to make a right improvement of thy time, to be Obedient to thy Parents, and Subject to thy Tutors, to be meek and lowly in thy mind, and to be affraid to commit that which is Evil, though in a secret Corner, or to wear that which is needless or superfluous; for this Truth is that which will teach thee all things, if thou wilt learn of it, thou wilt become more Excellent then thy Neighbours, and wilt not be seduced by the way of the Wicked, nor let thy mind out after their vain and foolish Fashions, nor delight in their evil Practices and proud Dresses, and false Speech, and corrupt Communication, but in the single Language, the plain and decent Dresses and Apparel that the godly of Old were, and now are Adorned in. John Field. September the 26th 1689.
There hath something lain as a weight upon my Spi∣rit for sometime, to write this Testimony as follow∣eth, Concerning my dear Deceased Husband Joseph Featherstone, for the Righte∣ous shall be had in Everlast∣ing Remembrance. AND this I can truly say concerning him, that he was a Man whom the Lord had endued with much Wisdom and Meekness, as his mind came to be re∣tired inward to wait upon the Lord, his Strength was daily renewed; and when the Lord was pleased to reveal his Son in him, then did the Lord wonderfully ap∣pear for him, and by a strong Hand brought him out of Egypt's Darkness, and from under the Hand of the Enemy
of his Soul, who would not be willing that he should go forth to serve the Lord his God. Oh the deep Exercise of the Travel of his Soul for Days and Months, when he went bowed down under the weight of his Sins, then they that were his Teachers before, could speak no Peace to his wounded Soul, for they were Phy∣sitians of no value: Oh the Sence of the Lords great Love to his Travelling Soul, how he brought him through the Wilderness, and from off the barren Mountains; and bore up his head above many Temptations and Trials within and without, and set his Feet upon a Rock, and established his goings; so that he could call to his Neighbours and Acquaintance to come and taste how good the Lord is to them that wait upon him; and many a time could speak a Word in season to such as were seeking the Li∣ving amongst the Dead; and his circum∣spect Walking reached the Hearts of ma∣ny, for he loved Truth in the inward parts, and to do the Will of the Lord was his great delight: He was Convin∣ced of Gods Everlasting Truth, the Twenty ninth Year of his Age, whom
the Lord made Instrumental in his Hand towards my Convincement; he was a true Yoke-fellow indeed, his Company to me was very dear, and my Soul hath often been refreshed in his savoury Life, which hath caused my loss of so dear a Husband, and so true a help-meet to be the greater, but knowing it to be of the Lord, I desire to be submitted to his blessed Will, that he alone may have the Glory of his own Works, for he is worthy who is God blessed for ever. In the time of his Sickness the Lord was pleased to bear him up in much Patience, and he was freely given up to the Will of the Lord; the day aster he fell Sick, I sitting by him, he perceiving I was much troubled, he said, Dear heart, give me up to the Will of the Lord, for said he, I can freely give up all; and when some Friends came to visit him, he Exhorted them to Faithful∣ness, And then the Lord would make a Dy∣ing-Bed Comfortable to them; and said, though he felt much Sickness and Pain upon his Body, yet the Refreshments that he felt from the Lord, made all his Troubles easie; then he spoke many comfortable Words to me, saying, How good the Lord had been
to us in many Exercises and Tryals, and through his great Love bore up our heads a∣bove them all; and his Prayers was to the Lord, that we might be preserved in his ho∣ly Fear and undefiled Way, to bear a Testi∣mony to the blessed Truth, to the end of our days: And then he desired me that his dear Child should be brought up in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, and Edu∣cated in the plain and decent Parts that belongeth to a Woman, but upon a need∣less Seam, nor any thing superfluous, no not to lift her hand to do, for that said he, Will bring dishonour to the blessed Truth, and be a Burthen to the simple-Hearted, and draw out the minds of the young ones after Vanity, which thing, said he, my Soul ha∣teth. The day before he was taken away, he seemed to be something restless, I said, dear Heart, thou art Restless; then he with a chearful Countenance said, Do'st thou not know where the Weary go to Rest; and said, my Rest and Fellowship is with the Lord: Some Friends came to Visit him, who asked how it was with him, he said, I am well, I feel no Sickness; and told them, he was glad to see them, and was much Refreshed in his Spirit; and
many sweet Refreshments from the Lord ran through him, to the great Comfort and Refreshment of the honest-Hearted; then he desired to be alone, saying, I would see if I could get a little Sleep, and so rested a pretty time; and then I asked him, how he felt himself, he said, I am well blessed be the Lord, and desired me to be satisfied, for he was satisfied, and lifting up his Hands, said, O Lord, thou art the Eternal God, and so fell asleep in the Lord, where he is gone far above the reach of his Persecutors, to praise the Lord that sits upon the Throne, and the Lamb for evermore; in the undoubt∣ed sence thereof my Soul doth praise and Magnifie the Lord on his behalf, who counted him worthy to suffer for his Name sake, by bearing a faithful Testimony against the Hireling Priests, who like devouring Wolves seek to lay Waste Gods Heritage And now having somewhat eased my Spirit, I humbly desire of the Lord, that he would be pleased to bear me up through all my Exercises and Tryals, that he may be pleased to suffer me to be tryed withal; and to endue me with
Wisdom and Understanding to govern my dear Child and Family in his most holy Fear and undefiled Way, to the Praise of his most holy Name, Amen; That when time shall be here no more, I may have a Resting-place with the Lord for evermore. He departed this Life, the 26th day of the 9th Month, 1682. in Postland, in the Parish of Crowland; and was Bu∣ried the 27th day in Friends-Burying-place in Crowland, being Accompanied with a pretty many Friends, Relations and Neighbours. Postland in the Parish of Crowland, being the place of my Abode, the 12th of the 3d Month, 1683. Sarah Featherstone.
A brief Relation of the Life and Death of my dear and only Child, Sarah Fea∣therstone, a Maid of the Age of fifteen years wan∣ting one Month; who Departed this Life at Partney-Mills in Lincoln-Shire, the 17th day of the 7th Month, 1688. THere hath a weight lain upon my Spirit for some time, to Write this Testimony concerning my dear and only Child: For the Righteous shall be had in Everlasting Remembrance; and truly it was the Lords great Love to me in gi∣ving me this dear Child, which I acknow∣ledge as a great Blessing; but that which is chiefly in my Eye, was the Lords great Love to her, who had inclined her Heart
to hear Wisdoms Voice, which often calleth to the young Ones, To remember their Creator in the days of their Youth; and Blessed are they that hear and obey in their measure, and with meek Moses chose rather to suffer Afflictions with the Children of God, then to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a season. And bles∣sed be the Lord for ever, who had in∣clined her Heart to Love, Serve and Fear him from her tender years; for from a Child she was tender and harm∣less, in true Submission and Obedience to her Parents, so that I know not that in her young time, that we ever had any just cause to use the Rod, for she was ve∣ry tender-Hearted, and of a comely Be∣haviour, kind and courteous to all peo∣ple, of a meek and quiet Spirit, there∣fore beloved of most that did know her. Her dear Father Departed this Life when she was about nine years of Age, who desired upon his dying-Bed, That his dear Child should be brought up in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, and be Educated in the plain and decent parts that belong to a Woman, but upon a needless Seam, nor upon any
thing Superfluous, no not to lift her Hand to do, for that saith he, will bring Dishonour to the blessed Truth, and be a burthen to the simple-Hearted, and draw out the minds of the young Ones after Vanity, which thing, saith he, mySoul hateth;  and his Breathings was to the Lord, that we might be perserved in his most holy Fear, and undefiled Way to the end of our days; and blessed be the Lord for ever, who giveth Understanding and Wisdom to them that fear him; and is a sure Help in the time of Trou∣ble to them that wait upon him; and in this my great Exercise in parting with so dear and tender a Husband, and so true a Help-meet; my dear Child was a great Comfort and Blessing unto me, and was very loving and tender over me, surpas∣sing most of her equals that I knew of; & as she did grow up in years, was a good Example in our Family, for her harm∣less Life and loving Behaviour appeared to the World what Stock she was of, but more especially her dear and tender Love to faithful Friends, of which she ever had a good esteem, and would mind me often of the Want of poor Friends and others,
And she her self would be helpful in what she had of her own, when need required; for her Life and Delight was in doing good, and in that she reached the better part in all, and from a Child she did take great delight in going to Meetings, and was much preserved out of heaviness, or having her eye abroad, but sitting in a sweet frame of Spirit, and would often be tendred in a Meeting, which hath of∣ten refreshed my heart in the great Love of the Lord, and to him be the Glory and Honour over all his own Works for ever∣more, Amen saith my Soul. And when I Married the second time, the Innocency of my dear Child did much appear in her Tenderness and Obe∣dience to us her Parents, and her love to all she came amongst, for her Life was in Peace, and could not abide Discord should have place in any: And when she went abroad to be Educated, she would be very careful in improving her time, and was a good Example where she went, amongst Friends and others, and hath left a good savour behind her, and her removal hath tendred the hearts of many that did know her; and when my dear
Husband was taken to Prison from me and his tender Family, she was a true Simpathizer with me, many times wil∣ling to take part with me in my Exer∣cises, for she was very dear and tender over me, willing to be governed by me, and to take up the cross to her own will in any thing I could not allow of for her to wear or do; and her dear Fathers dy∣ing Words did take deep impression up∣on her heart, and though Temptations sometimes did lie near, yet through the Lords great Love to her, her heart was kept low, and she with Mary chose the better part, which shall never be taken from her; so that I am satisfied that her Life was not in those perishing things; in which my heart is often refreshed and comforted, and the remembrance of her is made sweet to me; for through the Lords great Love to her, I know not any that can charge her with any wrong done to them, either by word or deed, for her life and delight was in Innocency and Love, adorned with Meekness. Oh, the consideration of my great loss of so dear a Child now in my old Age, hath caused me sometimes to say in my heart
if David said of Absolom, would God I had dyed for thee, O Absolom my Son! surely I have far more cause then David had, I having no more of my own to be a Comfort to me, (this being the last of Ten, Nine of them were Buried before her Father) whose old Exercise the ord is pleased to renew, but when I consider of Eternity, and the Joy that they are en∣tred into; and how good the Lord hath been to me in the days of my Afflictions, and hath born up my head above all my Sorrows, and that they are taken away from the evil to come; in this I am stay∣ed, believing that my loss is their ever∣lasting gain, and that I shall go to them as I in faithfulness abide. In the seventh Month on the ninth day, about the eleventh hour of the night, it pleased the Lord to visit my dear Child with this Sickness whereon she dyed, and when my maid came and told me my Child was taken Sick, my heart was much troubled, and it seised upon me very deeply, that my dear Child would be taken from me; and when I came at my Child she did lie in a sweet frame of Spirit, under a great weight of Sick∣ness,
and when I had been with her some time, she told me, she thought she should be taken from me, which caused my Exercise every way to be the greater, but to the Will of the Lord I was brought who gave me her, and he alone was worthy to dispose of her as he pleaseth; and so my dear Child did lie in a sweet frame of Spirit, often breathing to the Lord to bear her up above all her troubles, and did speak little to us, but her weakness increased daily upon her, and much pain, which this dear Babe endured with much patience; and when we would have sent for a Doctor, she would not, but said, she was freely given up to the Will of the Lord, whether to live or dye; and said, dear Mother, give me such things as thou thinkest convenient for me, that I am able to take, for I am weak; and said, dear Mo∣ther, it hath been laid before me sometime, that I was not of a long Life, and if this be the time of my Change I am content; and so did lie still, not seeming to be concerned at any thing, but keeping her mind in∣ward, often breathing to the Lord to bear her up above her weakness, and to be her support to the end of her days;
my heart would often be bowed down and tendred when I did see her under the great weight of her Sickness, at which she would be troubled; and say, dear Mother, thy dear and tender love to me hath been very great, and in that Love I desire we may rest, freely given up to the Will of the Lord, for the Lord may not see it meet to trust me in this wicked World any longer; and then she said, dear Mother, who would desire to live in this abominable wicked World any longer? Oh, the abominable Pride of this wicked World; and there is some amongst us, which can take liberty to fashion them∣selves in many things like unto the World, both in their Habit, and other needless things; Oh, but the Christian Life is ano∣ther thing; this is not the adorning we are to put on, for if the Righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the Wicked and Ʋngod∣ly appear? then she did lie still for some time whilst the violence of the Feaver troubled her much; and then she said, Ah, my dear Mother, in all my Sickness that I have had, I never felt the like I think, but I hope the Lord will be pleased to bear me up above all my troubles to the end of my days; Ah, my dear Father, never so sick in
my Life; Oh, sick at my heart, which often tendred our hearts, to see our dear Child pass through these great troubles at some times; and then she would say, Oh Lord in mercy remember me, and bear me up a∣bove all my Afflictions, for my heart trusteth in thee; I said, my dear Child, if the Lord should be pleased to take thee from me, where hast thou a desire to be Buri∣ed, wilt thou be Buried by thy dear Fa∣ther, in Friends Burying-place, in Crow∣land where we came from? she said, I have some thoughts formerly to have been Buried by my dear Father, but considering the greatness of the Journey, and so many Buried near him, I am satisfied, I leave it to thee and my Father; I said, my dear Child, art thou willing to be Buried in our Burying-place, where I hope to be Buried by thee; she said, dear Mother, Bury me where thou and my Father pleaseth, I leave it to you, its no matter how many Miles distance these Bodies lies, our Souls shall one day rejoyce together; then I asked her, what she would have disposed of, of that which was hers, she said, I would have my poor Relations have something, and poor Friends Children where we came from,
what thee and my Father pleaseth, I leave it to you, for my Father is a good Man, and hath been very tender over me, and my Love to him hath been very dear; and then she said, dear Mother, do not trouble me with any thing, but let us be submitted to the Will of the Lord in all things, do not speak to me, nor give me any thing without I desire it; and so lay still in a sweet frame of Spirit, and with as sweet a Countenance, and as chearful as if she had no such Weakness upon her, only sometimes a great trouble in her head, which the Lord was pleased to bear her up in much patience to pass through, not a discon∣tented word was heard to pass from her, but true Contentedness in much Patience, often saying, Ah, my dear and heavenly Father come away, come away, for my heart trusteth in thee: some time before she de∣parted her Speech failed her, after which a sweet harmony often ran through her, often lifting up her Hands with a very chearful Countenance, and so she fell a sleep in the Lord; who I then felt a stay to my mind, living Praises to his most holy and powerful Name, who is a God of endless Mercies; my Spirit was much comforted in the Lord in the behalf
of my dear Child in the time of her Sickness, who endued her with much patience, and wonderfully bore her up above all her Sickness and Pain which was upon her Body, at sometimes not knowing where to lay her Head to have a little ease, which she through the great love of the Lord was born up in much patience to pass through, in true submissi∣on to his blessed Will, and I do believe is at rest with God her Maker, being as∣scended above all her Sorrows and Trou∣bles, to praise the Lord that sits upon the Throne, and the Lamb for evermore; in the undoubted sence of which my Soul doth Praise and Magnifie the Lord on her behalf, and indeed the same doth out-ballance the great loss I have of her as to the outward, well knowing my Loss is her everlasting Gain; and desiring that I may be subject to the Will of the Lord, in what he may be pleased to try me with∣al, and that he may have the Glory of his own Works, for he is worthy who gave me her, and now hath taken her a∣way, Blessed and Praised be his most holy Name for ever.

A POSTSCRIPT. SInce I writ this Testimony concern∣ing my dear Child, there hath often fresh springs of the Lords great Love concerning her arose in my Heart which I had omitted my Duty in; when this Child was in the eleventh year of her age, it pleased the Lord to suffer Perse∣cution to come upon us (for the tryal of our Faith) for Meeting together and Worshiping God as he requires, that is in Spirit and in Truth; we being at a Meeting about eight Miles from our outward Dwelling, the Meeting being ended, and Friends ready to depart, some in the yard, some in the high-way, comes two Informers after a very rude manner, calling of us Rogues and Whores, and Swearing desperately to many untruths, my Husband reproved one of them (called Chipsam) for
Swearing, he was very angry, and held up his Stick, and said, He would break his Head, did he tell him, he was the Kings Officer. [Observe, the said Chipsam was not long after carried to Linclon Goal for Debt, and their dyed, and was there buried after a very mean manner in the Castle yard, &c.] But before the Meet∣ing fell to be there again by course, which was a Month, (they had made much spoil of Friends Goods) it pleased the Lord to visit my dear Husband with much Weakness, so that we could not go to the Meeting; but my dear Child having a great desire to go again with her Brothers, we wear freely willing, and they had a peaceable Meeting, and Friends ready to depart as before, came the same Informers as rude or worse then before, and within a few days Levied my Husbands Goods again upon the ac∣count of one of his Sons, but she being under Age, they could take nothing from her Father in Law upon her account, at which she seemed to be troubled, (she having a considerable Portion in his hand) and said, If they be suffered to take all that my Father hath, he shall not want to give up to
serve the Lord so long as I have any thing, (and would sometimes say to me, I do believe I shall never want any good thing which the Lord sees convenient for me) in which she manifested her Love to him upon her dying Bed, as it is fully decla∣red in the fore-going Testimony; so ha∣ving eased my Spirit, and discharged my Duty which I did owe, I desire to rest in Peace with the Lord, and in Love to his Truth and People, to the end of my days and time here in this mortal World, so that when time here will be no more, I may lay down my Head in Peace, as my dear Child hath done; and then as she said upon her dying Bed, Our Souls shall rejoyce together. Written at Partney: Mills the 11th of the 3d Month, 1689. by Sarah Brown.
Thomas Brown his Testi∣mony concerning his dear Daughter-in-Law Sa∣rah Featherstone. THis Testimony I have to bear con∣cerning my dear Friend and Relati∣on Sarah Featherstone, first let me say something of her outward Abilities; she was Born of honest Parents, and Educa∣ted in the plain and decent parts, her dear Mother thought convenient, as Sowing, Kniting, Reading, Writing, &c. In which she exceeded most of her equals, she was Womanly about Business, and what she did she did it with all her might; she was of a singular good na∣ture, and of a comely, chearful, quiet, modest Countenance, ripe Wit, quick of Apprehension, mild and loving Beha∣viour to all, and especially to Friends, but more especially to them that were poor; at Monthly Meetings when Wo∣men
Friends had Contributions for the service of Truth, this dear Child would freely throw in her Mite; a poor Wi∣dow Friend use to come to our House, when she went away, if this dear Child did not see her, she would sometimes run after her, (not like Gehazi) and give her something she had of her own, as sometimes half a dozen Eggs, which shew∣ed a tender regard she had to the Poor; her dear Father dyed when she was about nine years old, and after a convenient time her dear Mother became my Wife, so I had a certain knowledge of her for a∣bout six years, in which time I cannot remember that she ever gave me one an∣gry word, but was as loving and ten∣der to me as though she had been my own Child; I was carried to Prison for bear∣ing my Testimony against Tythes, and there the Lord was pleased to visit me with Sickness and other great Troubles, in which time this dear Child came seve∣ral times to visit me, though the Journey was long and difficult sometimes, but her dear and tender Love to me out-ballanced it all. This dear Child ever since I did know her, had a great desire to go to
Friends Meetings; I never see her in the least concerned in sleep or heaviness, but when I looked upon her I found her in a sober and weighty frame of Spirit, which often caused my Heart to rejoyce, and the remembrance of her is very sweet to me at this time. When the Lord was pleased to visit her with this Sickness whereon she dyed, which was in the fif∣teenth year of her Age, she bore it with great Patience, considering the violence of the Distemper (it was a very high Fea∣ver) of which she lay just a Week, in which time she would often breath unto the Lord, and say, Ah Lord help me; and say, Ah dear Father, what must I do? Ah, dear Mother, what must I do; never so sick in all my Life? we tenderly exhorted her to keep her mind stayed upon the Lord, then she would lie still a pretty while, whil'st the violence of the Distem∣per sorely troubled her, then she would cry out as before, and say, Ah Lord help me; and several times did lift up her hands and say, Lord have mercy upon me, Ah Lord help me; thus this patient inno∣cent Lamb finished her Testimony in a good day, and I do verily believe is at
rest with the Lord for evermore; this dear Babe, which was the only Child of her tender Mother, Departed this Life the seventeenth day of the seventh Month 1688. about mid night, and was honoura∣bly Buried the twentieth day following at Tumby-Wood side, in the Parish of Lirk∣by upon the Bain, in Friends Burning-Place, being accompanied with pretty many Friends, Relations and Neighbours unto the said place, where there was gathered together a pretty many Friends and Neighbours, where we had a good Meet∣ing held by our very dear and well-be∣loved Friend John Whitehead, who very tenderly accompanied us thither, where we were livingly refreshed together, for there was Milk for Babes, and Meat for them of riper Age, with living Testimo∣nies concerning the sober Life and harme∣less Conversation of this innocent Child, by our dear Friend John Whitehead (who had certain knowledge of her) she being sometimes before Tabled at his House) and William Birks likewise, she having been at his House a pretty time, a little before she fell Sick, was constrained to
bring in his publick Testimony concern∣ing this dear Child, all which greatly re∣freshed and comforted us her Relations, and was of good service to the whole Meeting, and may be a sweet savour to Generations to come; much more I might say concerning this dear Child as to her sober and loving Behaviour to all; her comliness in her Apparel, &c. (who like meek Moses) chose rather to suffer Af∣flictions with the dispised People of God in scorn called Quakers, then to enjoy the pleasures of Sin for a season, and did truly (I believe) remember her Creator in the days of her youth; this is Written for this and Generations to come, to stand upon Record, that young People may consider their latter end, and whilst they have time prize it; Written in love to the Lord, his Truth and People, having had a weight upon my Spirit for some Months, and now having eased my mind, and done my Duty which I did owe, I desire to rest in Peace; And if I in this, or at any other time, have said or done any thing that may tend to Gods Glory, or be serviceable to
any, my real desire is, that he alone may have the Glory, Honour and the Praise, for he alone is worthy, not only at this time but henceforth and for evermore, Amen saith my Soul. Partney-Mills the 4th day of the 11th Month, 1688, 89. Thomas Brown, Which was her Father in Law.
Some Testimonies; Concerning Charles Wray, Grace Brown and Katharine Brown her Daughter, Writ by Thomas Brown the Elder, in Partney in the County of Lincoln; who all dyed in the Faith, and left a sweet savour be∣hind them; the said Charles Wray having received a hea∣venly Gift, which he exer∣cised to Gods glory, and the refreshment of his People. SOmething lies weightily upon my mind, and hath done for several Months, to Write as a Testimony con∣cerning our dear Friend Charles Wray, being one that was very well acquainted
with him for several years, I thought it my Duty to mention something concern∣ing his tender care over the Church of Christ while amongst us; he was taken from us in the flower of his Years, the Lord was pleased to take him away (as he hath done many honest Friends be∣fore and since) from the evil to come; he was Servant to me about half a year, (and Tenant to me about twelve years) in which time he was very serviceable to me and my dear Wife as to our Convince∣ment, not only by his Words, but by his wise Walking; he met with great Exer∣cise in his time, but the Lord was plea∣sed to carry him through it all, and make him instrumental in his Hand, to the strengthning of the weak, for the Lord was pleased to open his Mouth to declare of his great love to Mankind, in which ser∣vice was his chief delight; towards the latter end of his time the Lord was plea∣sed to visit him with weakness of Body, so that he lay in Bed some Weeks, in which time I went several times to visit him, and was very much refreshed toge∣ther, for the Presence of the Lord did attend him; In his Weakness he was
very Comfortable both to Friends and o∣thers, for he could speak a Word in season to most Conditions; the Lord was pleased in the time of his Weak∣ness to send two of his Messengers amongst us, and he having a great de∣sire to see them, they with some Friends went one Evening to visit him, and we had a heavenly Meeting together, for the Power and Presence of the Lord was plentifully manifested amongst us, and our Weak Brother, whom I am speak∣ing of, was at that time made Strong, to declare of the Goodness of the Lord, and to praise his most holy Name, to the great comfort and refreshment of the Faithful; he often desired of the Lord that he would be pleased to endue him with a good Understanding to the end of his days, and lay no more upon him then he would give him Patience to bear, all which the Lord (in his great Love and Mercy) was pleased to answer, Praises to his most holy and powerful Name for evermore, Amen saith my Soul▪ for he did speak sensible Words a little before he departed, and was born up with much Patience all the time
of his Weakness; he said to a Friend a lit∣tle before his Death, That the Candle did burn dim, and presently departed without either Sob or Groan that was heard; he remembred his Creator in his young time, and made his peace with God whil'st here, and now is gone to receive the Fruits of his Labours, and to rest with the Lord for evermore; so hoping I have done my Duty which I did owe, and eased my Spirit, I de∣sire to rest in peace with the Lord in whom is my chief delight. Written in Partney the Tenth day of the Eleventh Month, 1682. By Thomas Brown the Elder.
I felt a weight laid upon me to Write this Testimony con∣cerning my dear and truely loving Wife Grace Brown, whom the Lord hath been pleased to take to him∣self. THis I can say, she had an honest desire after the Lord in the Sum∣mer of her days, as I may say early, when I had little in my mind that was good, she did often breath unto the Lord for me, and my dear Child Elia∣beth likewise; (who was a Loving, Ten∣der and Obedient Child to us both, whom the Lord hath been pleased to take to himself likewise, about a eleven days before her dear Mother) and he was pleased to hear their Cries and Tears, and change my mind to that which was good and acceptable to himself, Praises
to his Powerful Name for evermore, Amen saith my Soul. We were both Convinced of Gods precious Truth about the year 1669. Our dear Friends John Whitehead and Charles Wray were very tender over us, being chief Instruments in the hand of the Lord towards our Convincement, &c. she was a true, faithful and loving Wife to me, a true yoke-Fellow, a help-Meet indeed, Zealous for God and his Truth, which was very precious to her, which she delighted in more then any thing in this World; she was freely given up to the Will of the Lord, and bore things with great Patience, to the admiration of some in the time of my Confine∣ment in Lincoln-Castle, where I was thrown in by a Hireling-Priest for bear∣ing my Testimony against Tythes; whom she bore a faithful Testimony against (when he sent his Wife to demand Tythes, when I was in Prison for not paying the same) and said, She did be∣lieve that Tythe was not due according to the Law of God now in this Gospel day; she was made willing to part with me at that time, though I was very dear unto
her as a Husband could be to a Wife, but it was that recompence of Reward which she had an eye unto, and was made willing to suffer for, that now through Mercy she hath obtained by Faith; she took great delight in going to Meetings, and entertaining honest Friends; in the latter end of our time (I speak it to the Praise of our God who was so good unto us) several times as we lay in Bed together with broken and contrite Hearts, we did earnestly desire of the Lord that he would be pleased to give us of his Power and Spirit, that we might spend that little time that was yet behind, in his most holy Fear and undefiled Way, to the Glory and Praise of his Powerful Name; we lived in true Love together, her Company was very pleasant to me, and I took more delight in it, then in any thing in this World, she said mine was so to her; about three or four Weeks before her Death she did Write these following Words, viz. It is the real desire of my Heart to walk humbly be∣fore the Lord, for his Love hath engaged my Heart unto himself; she was one of few Words, (ready to hear, slow to speak)
in her Health and in her Sickness; and so Departed this life like a harmeless innocent Lamb, as though she had been a sleep, so good was the Lord unto her at that time, Praised be his powerful Name for ever and for evermore, Amen saith my Soul; much more I might say concern∣ing her faithful Walking, and tender Care over her Children, to bring them up in the Fear of the Lord, &c. She Departed this Life the Thirty first day of the Tenth Month, at Partney-Mills in Lincoln-Shire, in the year 1682. about the Forty eight year of her Age; she lived with me about Thirty years, we had eight Children together, five of them dyed before her; I Buried her de∣cently, and according to good Order practised amongst us, the second day of the eleventh Month, and in the year afore∣said, (being accompanied with a pretty many Friends and Relations) at Tumby-Wood-side, in the Parish of Kirkby on the Baine, in Friends Burying-Place; and so having somewhat eased my Spirit, I himbly desire of the Lord that he would be pleased to endue me with his Power and Wisdom, to Govern my Children
and Family in his most holy Fear, and un∣defiled Way; to the Glory of his most holy Name, Amen; so that when time here in this World will be no more, I may lay down my Head in Peace, as my dear Wife hath done, Praises to the Lord over all for ever and for evermore, Amen saith my Soul. Written in great tenderness of Spirit, by a lover of Peace and Truth, the Twenty fourth day of the Eleventh Month, 1682. at Partney-Mills, being the place of my out∣ward Habitation, Thomas Brown The Elder. The Name of the Righteous shall be had in Everlasting remembrance.
This Testimony I have to bear concerning Katharine Brown my dear Child, it hath re∣mained as a weight upon my mind for several days to Write to this effect, &c. IT was the care of some in days past, to keep in remembrance the Words and Works which sprang from the blessed Power of God; and one said, The Righ∣teous shall be had in everlasting remembrance, and said, The Name of the Righteous was pretious, &c. This Child, that I am speak∣ing of, was from her Childhood very de∣sirous to go to Friends Meetings, inso∣much as one time it was with me to exa∣mine her what she went for, she very ten∣derly gave me this answer, To wait upon the Lord, it was not distance of Way, nor difficultness of Weather, that did hinder this Child from going to Meet∣ings, and though she was up early, and
the Journey pretty far, five, seven or eight Miles, and went a foot sometimes, yet this Child was never the least con∣cerned in sleep or heaviness that I did perceive, for always when I looked upon her, I found her in a solid, sober and weighty frame of Spirit, which hath caused my Heart many a time to rejoyce in the Lord on her behalf; at the time called Christmass, she went to a Neigh∣bours House, they having pretty many Children, and they were playing at Cards, this Child sat her down by the Fire-side, where the Woman of the House was, and said, Had not thy Chil∣dren better be exercised in Reading, &c. the Woman said, she thought they did no harme, but before this Child was gotten half way home, which was about half a quarter of a Mile, these Children fell out as they were at their Game, and were ready to fight, then the Woman remembred the Childs Words, and confessed to the truth of them; this Woman came to visit this Child in the time of her Sick∣ness, and told us this Passage. One time it was with her to Write to her Brother John, he being something wild,
viz. Dearly beloved Brother, in the Fear of the Lord do I exhort thee, to Leave off Liteness and Vanity, and then to wait upon the Lord, and desire of him to forgive thee that which is past, &c. In the fore end of her Sick∣ness, one night she being in Bed, and I and her dear Mother also in the same Room, the Power of the Lord ran through her, and she being very much troubled with a great Hoarsness all the time of her Sickness, in so much that one could hardly hear her speak, but at that time with a very clear voice she broke forth in Praising and Magnifying the Lord with a very sweet Harmony, and said, Blessed and Praised be the Lord, for he is gathering a People to himself to do his Will, Praises to his most holy Name for ever, and kept Praising and Magnifying the Lord a pretty time, but her Words were something lower, so that we could not hear them all. This Child did take great delight in Reading Friends Books, that is, Epistles to Friends, and in William Bayly's Book, and in the Prophesie of the Prophet Isaiah, about the 51st Chapter, where God Calls and Exhorts his People to trust in him; if she had but a little spare
time she would imploy it in either Read∣ing or Writing; she had an excellent Gift in Reading, which greatly comforted and refreshed most that heard her, for some∣times it would take such impression upon the tender-hearted, that Tears would trickle down their Cheeks, for she did read with the Spirit and with the Understand∣ing also; many things more I might men∣tion as to her sober behaviour to all she was concerned with, her comliness in her Apparel, a needless thing I never did see her wear, she hath left a good savour behind her, and is gone to her everlasting Rest with the Lord for evermore, for she did truly Remember her Creator in the days of her youth. She departed this Life the 21st day of the 11th Month, 1680. in the 17th year of her age, at Partney-Mills in Lincoln-shire; I Buried her decently the 23d day follow∣ing, at Tumby-Wood-side, in the parish of Kirkby upon the Baine in Friends-Burying-place; so desiring not to be tedious, and ha∣ving somewhat eased my Spirit, I desire to rest in peace with the Lord, and in Chari∣ty with all Men. Written in Partney, By Thomas Brown the Elder. THE END.
