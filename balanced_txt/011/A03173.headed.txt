Of amendment. i. IF euery man mende one, all shalbe mended. Thys meane to amendment, is now intended. For though no man loke to mend hym selfe brother: Yet eche man lokth to control and mend other. VVaggyng of beardes. ii. It is mery in hal when beardes wagge al. Husband for thys, these wordes to mynde I cal: Thys is ment by men, in theyr mery catyng: Not to wag theyr beardes in brawlyug and threatyng. Wyfe, the meanyng hereof, differth no two pyns Betwene waggyng of mens beardes and womens chyns. Of Hast. iii. The hastie man wanteth neuer woo. In hastye women not euer soo. With suffryng husbands hasty wyues, Haue ofte we see, full mery lyues. Breakyng of square. iiii. An ynche breakth no square: which syns thou hast hard tel, Thou doest assay howe to breake square by an el. Othervvyse. An inche breakth no square: thou breakst none, though it do. Thou rather bryngst square thē breakst square betwene too. Lokynge and leapynge. v. Loke ere thou leape, nay thou canst in no wyse brooke. To looke ere thou leape, for thou leapst ere thou looke.
VVeddyng and hangyng. vi. Weddyng and hangyng, are desteny I see. Weddyng or hangyng, which is best, six (quod she?) Forsoth good wyfe, hangynge I thynke best (quod he) So help me god, good husband, so thynketh me. Oh howe lyke lambes, man and wyfe here agree. Of Delay. vii. He that wyl not when he may, When he wold he shall haue nay. But to that nay, nay I say: If of my wyfe I delay, To take shroude words: yet that stay Stayth them not from me next day. Of VVyttes. viii. So many heades, so many wyttes, nay nay. We see many heades, and no wyttes some day. No lacke in loue. ix. In loue is no lacke, true I dare be borowe. In loue is neuer lacke, of ioy or sorowe. Othervvyse. In loue is no lacke, no in no woyng day. But after weddyng day, lets here what ye say. Of Homely home. x. Home is homely, yea and to homely some tyme. Where wyues footestoles, to their husbandes heads clyme.
Gyuyng and takyng. xi. Better gyue then take, al say, but so thynke none: All thynke better take. xx. poundes, then gyue one. Iacke and Gyll. xii.

Iacke, to bye or sell that ware, foles can no skyll. Of haste and vvaste. xv. Haste maketh waste: which perceyued by slouth, Slouth wyl make no haste, he swerth by his trouth. Makyng of malte. xvi. Soft fyre maketh swete malte, as malt makers tel: Then to make swete malte, fyre is to rashe in hel. Wherby syns in hell no good ale is to sel, Drye drunken soules can not lyke in hell to dwel.
Of an akynge eye. xvii. Better eye out, then alway ake: In rage of ache, true as I spake: But in meane ache, meanely to mone, Better an akyng eye then none. VVhat thyng beggers choose. xviii. Beggers shulde be no choosers, but yet they wyll: Who can bryng a begger from choyse to begge styll? Of Robbyng. xix. Rob Peter and pay Poule, thou sayst I do: But thou robst and poulst Peter and Poule to. Of nede and lavve. xx. Nede hath no lawe, in some case in very dede, Nede hath no lawe: and yet of lawe we haue nede. Of beginning and endyng. xxi. Of a harde beginning, comth a good endyng: Truth, on this terme is not alway dependyng. Some hardely begin, by the feete to syt fast: That ende with harde hangyng, by the neckes at last. Of Grace. xxii. In space comth grace, I graunt grace may come in space: But in rule, by thy rule neuer loke for grace. Of fore prouision. xxiii. Who so that knewe what wolde be dere, Shulde nede be marchaunt but one yere.
But thou hast konwen yeares, two or three: That good condycyons wolde in the Both dere and deintely be growen: And yet for all thys, thus fore knowen, To warne the of good fore prouysyon, Thou hast not nowe one good condycyon. Of Saying and doyng. xxiiii. Saying and doyng, are two thynges, we say: But thy sayinges and doynges euery way, Ioyne iumpe in one thy wordes and dedes procede: But thou art good, nother in worde nor dede. Of Treadyng on a vvorme. xxv. Treade a worme on the tayle, and it turneth agayne: But thou tredst on the wormes head, that to restrayre. Of Ease in an Inne. xxvi.

Of makyng and marryng. xxxix. Make or mar I wyll, so sayest thou euer: But thou boost euer marce, thou makste neuer. Of byrdes and byrders. xl. Better one byrde in hande, then ten in the wood. Better for byrders, but for byrdes not so good. Of Sorovves. xli. Make not two sorowes of one, yf thou can: Least makyng of two sorowes, marre one man. Of fdyng and teachyng. xlii.

Of suffrance. xliii. Of suffrance comth ease: how shall I knowe that, wyfe: I haue sufferd the, without ease, all my lyfe. Of hym that set his hande on his money. xliiii.

A shorte hors is soone coride, thats to weete When short hors, and short coryers do meere. Of shame. xlvi. Shame take him that shame thinkth, for thou dost thinke nō Thou art to far past shame, shame to thynke on. A lordes harte and a beggen purse. xlvii. There is nothyng in this worlde that agreeth wurse, Then doth a lordes harte and a beggers purse. And yet as yl as those two do agre, Thou canst not brynge them a sunder to be. Of forgettyng. xlviii. The paryshe priest forgeth, he was paryshe clarke: And the person forgeth, he was paryshe pryst. But priest, clarke, and no clarke, al, who wyl marke To forget what we were, shall se vs entyste. Of the harte and the heele. xlix. Shall I set at my harte, that thou setst at thy heele: Nay, a hart in a heelde hose, can neuer do weele.
Othervvyse. Shal I set at my harte that thou setst at thy heele? Nay, howe euer kybd heeles do, kybd hartes do not weele. Prayse of a man aboue a horse. l. A man may wel leade a horse to the water: But he can not make hym drynke withowt he lyst. I prayse the aboue the horse, in thys matter: For I leadyng the to drynke, thou hast not myst Alway to be redy withowt resystens Both to drynke, and be drunke, ere thou were led thens.
