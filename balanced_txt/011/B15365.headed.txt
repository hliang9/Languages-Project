Hor though thy goodnes / through thy mightie power Mate otherwise appeare sufficiently As thynges / whiche thy creatures euery oure With one voyce / declare and testify Thy goodnes yet / thy syngular mercy Thy petious harte / thy gracious indulgence Nothyng so clerely sheweth / as our offence.
What but our syn / hath shewed ye mighty loue Whiche able was / thy dredfull maiestie To drawe downe in to earth / from heuen aboue And crucifie god / that we pore wretches wee Should from our filthy synnes / clensed bee With bloode and water / of thyne owne syde That stremed / from thy blessed woundes wyde. ❧ Why loue and pitie / thus O heuenly kyng Our ciuill maketh matter / of thy goodnes O loue O pitte / our welth aye well prouidyng O goodnes seruyng / thy seruauntes in destres O loue O pitie / well nigh now thankeles O goodnes mightie / gracious and wyse And yet almoste vanquished with our vise. ❧ Graunt good lorde / suche hete into my hart That into this loue of thyne / mate bee egall, Graunt me from satans seruice to estart With whō me ruith / so long to haue been thrall Graunte me good lorde / and creator of all The flame to quenche / of all synnefull desire And in thy loue / set all my harte a fyre. ❧ That when the iournay / of this dedly life My sely ghoste / hath finished and thence Departe muste / with out his fleshely wife A loue into his lordes high presence He maye the fynde / O well of indulgence In thy lordeshippe / not as a lorde but rather As a very louyng and tender father.

A prayer against the fere of death. O Lorde Iesu / the onely health of men liuyng And life euerlastyng / of thē whiche faithfull dy I moste wretched synner / doo giue to the praisyng And wholy submit myself / to thy greate mercy Nothyng can bee compared / vnto thy pity None truly can perishe / that putteth their trust in ye wherfore moste louyng lord / haue mercy now on me Haue mercy & pity on me / I say / moste merciful lord whiche hūbly beseche the / to giue me now thy grace That I may now willyngly / forsake al frail discord Pertainyng to this life / now graūt me tyme & space Here to dispise this fleshe / that I maye se thy face I trust moste blessed lorde / in thy compassion More clerely for to rise / in my resurreccion. ❧ O mercifull Iesu / I humbly crye to the that ye wilt by thy grace / make sure & strōg my soule Against the fere of death / my flesh sore troubleth me That frō temptacions / my corporall yies may roule And that I maye se the / with the yies of my soule This mercifully here me / auert from me thy sworde Of thy indignacion / accordyng to thy worde. ❧ Lorde vnder the buckler / of mercy thou me kepe Like as thou hast preserued / thy holy marters all whō thou madest ouercome / the ferce tormentes depe Of their greuous death / & broughte thē out of thrall That I maye haue like grace / to the I hartely call Haue mercy on my soule / when it passeth my boby Which of his own kind / worketh nought but misery
❧ I acknowledge my self / that I am destytute Of all sucker and help / nothyng I worke but synne Of my selfe good lorde / but yet I make my sute Puttyng my trust in the / at length heuen to wynde For my confidence / onely good lorde is in The my lorde and sauiour / Iesu my saluacion By the merites of thy death / and of thy passion. No merites nor good workes / now of myself I haue Before ye to knowledge / wherfore my flesh doth quake But only it lieth in the good lorde / my soule to saue Not able I am to ye / for my synnes amēdes to make Through thy mercy by faith / yet in thy blod I take A perfect hope & trust / thou wilt not impute my syne But accept into thy grace / through ye heuē to winne Thou mercifull lorde / which borne was for my sake And for me a synner / great tormentes & great payne Thou hast in erth here take / frō sine me for to wake To hange vpon the crosse / thy selfe didst not abstain To haue thy syde wide opē / no smart ye didst refrain To shed thy precious blode / ye barest to mā such loue Non might bide such smart / for mā this wil I proue Make all these thy paynes / good lorde to profet me Let thy most precious blode / my soule & body clense Let the smart passion / whiche thou suffred on tre Satisfy for my synnes / I cannot make no mense Of my self good lorde / so opprest I am with senes Let thy righteousnes / my vnrighteousnes hyde Washe from me my synnes / that I from the not slide
❧ Gyue me grace O lorde / I wauer not in faith But to be firme and stable / in the O liuyng god My hope and saluacion / thus the scriptures saith This fleshe do not cōfoūde me / ye I shuld tast thy rod That my loue and charite / to the bee not doune trod Finally the weakenes / of this my fleshely breth Ouercome be not / at any tyme with the fere of death ☞ Graūt me o mercifull lorde / as my trust is in the That when death shutteth vp / the yies of my body The yies of my soule / to the liftned maye be By true faith and hope / to liue eternally where as is no discorde / no payne nor misery But euerlastyng peace / whiche no toungue can tell But euer shall induer / for euer I know right well This when death shall take / away my toūge & voyce yet my harte maye crye / and saie to the O lorde In thy holy handes / now let my soule reioyce Like a louyng father / accordyng to thy worde Let not my soule suffer / the ier of thy sworde This bothe soule and body / to the I doo commende To whom bee honor and prayse / euer without ende. Amen.
