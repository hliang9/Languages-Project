TO THE RIGHT HO∣nourable WILLIAM Earle of Pembrooke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe, Lo: Parre and Rosse of Kendall, Lo: Marmion and St. Quintin: Lord Warden of the Staneries in the County of Deuon and Cornewall, of the most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight: Chancellor of the V∣niuersity of Oxford, and Captaine of the Kings Ma∣iesties Towne and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Iland of Portsey, Lo: Chamberlaine to his Maiestie, and one of the Lords of his Maiesties most honorable Priuy Councell. RIGHT HONORABLE: BEing filled with a studious obseruati∣on of your noble parts, and a decla∣ratory fame of the Vertues and Hero∣icke actions of your Fame-worthy
Progenitors, and those trans-mitted vnto You by a successiue Lineall and Hereditary right: so that that rare Coniunction of Castor and Pol∣lux, Imeane, Nobilitas, & Ortu, & Arte, are both happily conioyned in your noble Person. The Cu∣rious suruey of the multitude of your Honourable parts bred in me a num∣ber of desires: so that J have aduen∣tured to breake the barren soyle of my vnluckie Portion, that prosperous successe should rather want to my en∣deauours, then diligent endeauours to my loyall determination. My sub∣missiue respect to your noble and He∣roicke Vertues haue bin a presump∣tatiue cause to desire your Lordships gratious Patronage of this my Com∣pendium Belli, but how my vnwor∣thynesse
may hope of your Goodnes, J cannot finde but in the notes of your transcendent and generous disposi∣tion. Thus in the lowest humility of affection, J offer both my selfe, and the Imployment of my vndeseruing seruice, freely to your Honors accep∣tance: and doe desire both to be, and to appeare to be Your Honors humblest and most devoted Seruant IOHN ROBERTS.
To all Gentlemen and Louers of the Art of Warre. NOble and ingenious Reader, I haue presented to the world, and to thy viewe this Compendium, that thou with it mayest reape, that only, by thy intuitiue speculation, which I haue got by my laborious practise: I make no doubt, of thy skill and knowledge herein, but that thou knowest, and hast seen, this in thine owne practicke, by thy indu∣strious trauell; Which now thou seest here in the Theoricke, by my laborious paines. Therefore I desire your courteous censure in the perusall of this Booke: for if any thing be mistaken through equiuocation of words, or ambiguitie of sense, blame the fruitlesse rage of Destiny, that carries the best shafts of my vnlucky Quiuer farr distant from the white I aymed at. I did it
for the honour of my Countrey, and the generall good of the common weale: for which reasons, I hope it may passe with∣out the molestation of any of the vnskil∣full: The Learned and Ingenious I honor; and willingly stand to their censure; To the rest Farewell.
Compendium Belli: OR THE TOVCHSTONE of Martiall Discipline. Principall and especiall Rules for euery Commaunder to be perfect in. THose things that helpeth the Enemie greatly, annoyeth thee, and the same that hel∣peth thee, hurteth him. Hee that is more carefull and vigelant, to obserue the cunning and polliticke deui∣ses of the Enemy, and also ta∣keth most paines in the exercising his Company, or Army, shall be sure to incurre least perills, and may haue greatest hope of victorie.
Neuer enterprise any dangerous incounter with thy Souldiers, but first by thy pollicie, let there be giuen out, hope of victorie. It is better to conqer the Enemy with famine, then with the sword; in the victory of which, for∣tune may doe much more then valoure. No plot or purpose is better then that which is hid from the Enemy, vntill it be executed. To know in the warre how to vnderstand occa∣sion, and take it, more auayleth then any thing. Nature breedeth few strong and valient men, but industry and exercise maketh many. Discipline may doe much more in time of bat∣tell, then furie. If any of the Enemies Souldiers depart from them and fly to thee (so they prooue faythfull) they shall be allwaies vnto thee great gaines, and stand thee in great steede, for that the power of thy Enemies are thereby deminished, and much more weakened, then of those that be slaine, though the name of a Fugitiue be to old frinds o∣dious, to new suspected. Better it is in pitching the field, to reserue be∣hinde the first front ayde enough, then to make a big front, which will doe great hurt, and disperse the Companies. He is difficultly ouercome, which knoweth his owne strength, and the power of his enemies. The valour of the Souldiers, more auaileth then the multitude.
Sometimes the situation helpeth more then va∣lour. New & sodaine thinges make Armies affraide; slowe and accustomed things be little regarded: Therefore make thy Armie practise; and know, with small fightes a new enemy, before thou ad∣uenterest to fight a field with them. He that with disorder followeth the enemie after that their order is broken, will become of a Conquerour a Conquered. He that prepareth not necessary victualls, with all manner of Amunition, is ouercome without the Sword. He that trusteth more in Foote-men then Horse-men, or in Horse-men more then in Foote-men, must accomodate himselfe with the situation. When thou wouldst see if in the day there be come any Spie into the Campe, make proclama∣tion that euery man goe to his lodging, so shall you know your owne men from strangers. Change purpose if thou perceiuest that thy e∣nemie hath foreseene it. Consult with many aboute the thinges thou oughtest to doe, the same thou wilt after doe, conferre with few. Souldiers when they abide at home, are main∣teyned with feare and punishment; after, when they are led to the warre, with hope and rewarde. Be sure the enemie know not how thou wilt order thy Army in battell; and whatsoeuer man∣ner
sets the battell, make that the first Bande be receiued off first and second. In fight neuer occupie the battell to any other thing then to the same for which thou hast ap∣pointed it, if thou meanest to make no disorder. Suddaine accidents are remedyed with difficul∣ty, those that are thought vpon with facility. Before thou bringest thy Souldiers to giue bat∣tell, cause them to be ranged in forme of battell, making of his Foote-men sundry Battalions, and of those sundry fronts; to deuide the Horse-men also in sundry troopes, placing the Lances, Light-horsemen, and Hargubusiers, euery front in seue∣rall troupes by themselues, to cause the forlorne to issue out, and skirmish them before the batta∣lions, as if the enemy were indeed present, and vpon a retreate sounded and beaten, suddenly to retire: The Horse-men to charge, and suddenly to returne againe into their place; vpon their re∣treate to cause certaine sleeues of Pikes, and light armed, to runne out to their reskew, as though the enemie did pursue them: Then the Battalions of the first front to march forward, and charge the enemie, and suddenly after the sound of the retreate, to retire themselues orderly, betweene the Battalions of the second front: Then the se∣cond front must charge, and march forward toge∣ther with the other that last retired, and make head together vpon the enemy. Last of all, the light armed Foote-men and
Horse-men must issue out, as it were to doe exe∣cution vpon the enemie. Whilst fayre weather is, the Generall must acquaint the Souldiers to sleepe vpon bare ground: Although the enemy be farre absent, yet duely to mainteine the Skoutes, lay out their Pardues, set forth their Centryes, and performe all manner of Millitary Orders, as curiously and carefully as if the enemie were present: He must keepe his Souldiers in continuall exercise; and by feigned Allarums, to see in what readinesse his Forces would be (if necessity required:) But if the enemie chance to cause any Allarum in∣deede, it is his pollicie then to cause the Campe to be in armes by the sound only of the Drumbe∣stickes, or some other priuate watch-word, or some Warning-peece, which when the enemie perceiues that the Campe is in Armes without any manner of Allarum, will much amaze and terrify them, to finde them in such readinesse, da∣ring them and their affronts. Also, the Generall ought to shew them all manner of wayes how the enemie may at∣tempt them, discouering also to them their remedy, and how they are to answere to those attempts; for no Man is borne a Souldier, but by exercise and industry it is attayned, and by discontinuance againe it is lost, as all other Artes and Sciences are.
You must haue a speciall care, that the Army haue not in their faces the dust to blinde them, the winde to disturbe them, or the Sunne beames to annoy them, before they enter into any maine Encounter; the which Impediments, not only altogether, but each one by himselfe alone, doth bring great toyle, trouble, and disaduantage.
The forme of seuerall Marches. depiction of military formations.
IF you meane to exercise a Company, you must bring them into this forme. viz. The Muskatiers must be placed on both sides of the Pikes, fiue Files on one side, and fiue on the o∣ther, the Pikes ten deepe, and so many square in the middle. To your Right Hand. First note, that before you begin to exercise the Company, you first commaund them to ad∣uance their Pikes, and to shoulder their Muskets: Then you haue no more to doe, but to cause them to turne to their Right-hand, which is thus; They must not remooue their Left legge from the ground, but turue vpon it, and remooue on∣ly the Right, to make the Right hand File the Front, as you see in this Figure. As you were. As you turned to your Right, so in the same manner you must turne backe to your Left, kee∣ping your Left legge still vpon the ground, vntill you come euen with the Front.
depiction of military formations.
To the Left Hand. Because the Enemy may sometimes Charge on the Left Hand Flanke; Therefore, that you may be sudainely ready to defend your selues, and of∣fend them; and for diuers reasons besides, this Motion is vsed: And to doe it, you must mooue with your Right Foote, vntill your Faces front toward the Left Flanke, your Left Foote not moouing from the place where it stood before, but turning. As you Were. Then hauing performed the aforesaid Motion, the Captaine commaunds, As you weare, and then they mooue all towards the Right Hand, vntill they are turned to the first Front, moouing vpon the same Foote you did before. To the Right Hand About. This Motion is vsed, when the Enemy doth Charge in the Reare; then keepe your Left Foote still, and turne to the Reare, and Charge, or otherwise for exercise.
depiction of military formations.
To the Left Hand as you were. Hauing performed the former Motion, the Captaine commaunds them, To the Left hand as you were, the Left Foote remaines fixed, vntill their faces be turned to the former front. To the Left Hand about. Sometimes it is more conuenient to turne to the Left Hand then to the Right, therefore this Motion is vsed, the Left Legge still standing. To the Right hand as you were. It is but turning towards your Right Hand, vn∣till you come to the former Front.
depiction of military formations.
Rankes to your Right Hand Double. This Motion is onely vsed, to double and strengthen the Front; and thus it is done, all in the second Ranke, march vp in the first; and first, they must set forward the Right Legge, and then the Left, making but two Paces to the Front, and so the Fourth, the Sixth, the Eight, and Tenth Ranke, must likewise doe all at one instant. Rankes to your Left Hand as you were. Hauing performed the former Motion, you turne about at the Word of Commaund, and set forward your Left Foote, and so make two Pa∣ces, comming into your forme againe, all at one instant. Rankes to your Left Hand double. This is almost all one as you did with the Right, saue you must set forward your Left Leg fist, and put your selfe on the Left Hand of your Leader.
depiction of military formations.
Rankes to your Right Hand as you were. You must first trne to your Right, because you will come the better into your place; and then set forward your Right Foote, it is more seemely and Souldier like by much then any o∣ther way. Because you see there is an odde File of Muska∣tiers, you must place the Muskatiers all to the Right Flanke, and it is easely donne thus, causing the Left Wing to stand still, and the rest to mooue one pace forwards; then the word of Commaund is; Left Flanke to the Right Hand, and march through thy Files, which with ease is to be done. Files to your Right Hand double. There is occasion sometimes to strengthen the Flankes, and then they vse this word of Com∣maund, which is no more to performe then this, if it be to the Right Hand; then the Right Flanke standeth still, and the next File doubleth it, that is, fall iust behinde his Side-man, in File with him; Then the Third, Fifth, Seuenth, and eue∣ry other stands: Remember that you must make them doe it all at one motion together.
depiction of military formations.
Files as you were. All those that doubled, returne into their pro∣per places, by setting their left Legge first to pace: Remember when you double to your right hand, you put your right Legge forward, and when on the left, your left Legge, and so backwards. Files to your Left Hand double. This motion differeth little from the other, saue that the left flancke doe stand still, and the Second doubles it in this action; in doubling the left Legge, goeth to double, and the right com∣ming backe. Files as you were. Is iust as the other was, saue they fall backe to the right hand, with the right legge.
depiction of military formations.
Hauing performed the doubling of Files, which was don with the Shot in the Right Hand Flanck of the Pikes: Now you must place them as they were before, one halfe on the Right Flancke, the other on the Left of the Pikes. Halfe Files to your Right Hand, Double your Rankes. This must be done by the sixt Rancke, and you must doe it at ten Paces thus; First with your Right Leg set forward, you must March forward, and aduance your Ground towards the Front, all the Rancke obseruing the Right Hand Leader, and so mooue altogether to the Front, with whom you must Ranke; obseruing likewise that when you thus begin to double, you Aduance your Pikes, & when you haue doubled the Front, Order your Pikes, the Sixt must rancke with the First, the Seuenth with the Second, the Eight with the Third, and so all the rest.
depiction of military formations.
When you haue performed the former Motion, they must turne to the Right Hand, which is more gracefull and comely, with the Right Foote set forward, and so Retreate to the Reare, at ten Pa∣ces more, obseruing your Left Hand, and then you will be tenn deepe againe as you were. Halfe Files to your Left Hand, Double your Rankes. There is no difference, but onely that the halfe Files must march vp to the Left Hand of the Files that stand. Halfe Files to the Right Hand, As you were. The halfe Files aduance their Pikes, and falles back with their Right Legge, to be cleare of their Side-men, & so march into their proper places.
depiction of military formations. Halfe Files to your Right Hand, as you were. Halfe Files to your Left Hand, double your Rankes. Halfe Files to the Right Hand, as you were.
Files to your Right hand Countermarch. When a Charge is expected in the Reare, and it being thought conuenient to haue the Leaders of the Files in the places of the bringers vp, be∣cause they are men best able to receiue the Ene∣mie. The Leaders aduancing with their Right Legge turned to the Right Hand, and march downe towards the Reare, all the body of the Company, mouing together: for when the first Filers turne, the Second aduanceth in their pla∣ces, and doth the like, and so Third, Fourth, and Fifth, &c. There is also another kinde of Coun∣termarch, which is called the Lacedemonian Coun∣termarch, which is for the First Rancke to Face towards the Reare; the Second, and all the rest of the Body to March vp, and turne behinde their Leaders, you may Countermarch likewise by Ranckes as you doe by Files.
depiction of military formations. Files to your Right Hand, Counter-march.
Files to your Right Hand Countermarch. This motion differeth nothing in the world from the other, for you must turne vp on the same Hand againe, and aduance with the Left Legge, and turne to the Right Hand, and then you March iust in the place you were in before. Close your Files both wayes at a Foote and Halfe. If a Charge of Horse bee expected, then the Foote are to be in the closest Order, which is one Foote and a Halfe in File, and there in Rancke. Close your Ranckes to three Foote. Which is nothing else, but to Pace on to the Sword point, which is the iust distance of Three Foote,
depiction of military formations. Close your Files a Foot and a halfe. Close your rankes to three Foot.
Ranckes to the Right Hand wheele. If the Enemie Charge on the Right Hand Flancke, to receiue them with the most able men which are commonly in the Front, it may be thus performed; the Leader of the Right Hand File standeth fixed, onely turning his body, and the rest moue vpon him as the Centre, obseruing still the distance and straightnesse of their Rancks and File, without which, this motion will not be per∣formed gracefully. Rancks to your Left Hand wheele. There is no difference in the performance of this motion, and the latter, but that the Left Hand Leader stands, and the rest wheeles towards him. Ranckes to the Right Hand wheele vpon a Center. All to the Right Hand of the middle of the Front goe backwards, and on the Left forwards. Rancks to the Left Hand wheele vpon the Center. All the Left Hand of the Center wheeles back∣wards, and the right forwards.
Rankes to your Right Hand Wheele. Rankes to your Left Hand Wheele. Rankes to your Right Hand wheele vp∣on the Center. Rankes to your Left hand, wheele vp∣on the Center.
Open your Ranckes backward. To open the Banckes, vnderstand that the Front or First Rancke standeth still, and the other nine Ranckes fall backwards altogether, vntill the Second Rancke bee Sixe Foote distant from the first, and then it stands still: so likewise must you doe with all the Ranckes, vntill they bee distant sixe foote one from another. Open your Files both wayes. In opening your Files, halfe the body moue to∣wards the right hand, and halfe towards the left hand ingrosse, and then the two middlemost files when they are three foote distant, stand still, and the rest of the body continues moouing both wayes vntill the next two files, are distant three foote more, and so of all the rest. Here you are in your Order as you were at first, three foote in File, and sixe foote in Rancke.
depiction of military formations. Open your rankes Backwards. Open your Files both wayes.
How to exercise Muskatieres. First Rancke giue Fire, and Countermarch to the Reare. First, you must vnderstand that they must bee three foote in file, and three foote in rancke, and then the Captain giues the Word of Command, and they Countermarch to the reare, and there ranke: note alwayes that you Countermarch still to the right hand, and neuer to the left: this is done standing, and therefore looseth ground; some will say Countermarching with Muskets in skirmishing is improper, but I say it is as the sci∣tuation is, for if you haue but little ground to make a front, and haue a bigg front to oppose you, then you may vse Countermarching, because you haue not ground enough for to fight by diuisions. The Second Order. You must make a diuision in the midst, of sixe foote, then the Captaine commands first and se∣cond ranks, make ready, and then Marcheth with them some sixe paces from the front, and then sayes, First rancke giue fire, which when they haue performed, they Marchone halfe through the Deuision, and the other by the right flancke to the Reare.
depiction of military formations. First Ranke giue Fire and Countermarch to the Reare. First and second Rankes make ready: First Rranke giue Fire, &c.
The Third Order. As you did before, so you must doe now, but that as soone as you haue drawne out the two first rancks, and when the first is come in place to pre∣sent, you may vse this Word of Command, Second Rancke to your right hand, Double your Front, and giue Fire then as you were: Lastly, let them March one halfe through the Diuision, and the other by the right hand flancke, as afore to the rancke in the reare; obserue that as soone as the first falls off to the reare; the second immediatly followes, and this demonstration is of gayning ground, for the body is still marching softly forward. The Fourth Order. The Company retreating, the Captaine sayes to the last rancke, To the right hand about and giue Fire, and then they rancke in the reare, and per∣formes the same, the one halfe marcheth through the Deuision, and the other by the right hand flancke, to the front, and so by the last ranke con∣tinually; this is an order of loosing ground. The Fifth Order. Vpon your Retreate, the Enemie following hard neere you, to annoy them, you cause the last rancke to doubl the reare still, and giue Fire, which before you gaue Fire with ten; now you doe with twenty, and so done, they March in their places as afore.
depiction of military formations. Second Ranke to the right Hand double your Front, and giue Fire. Last Ranke to the right Hand about, and giue fire. Last Ranke to the right Hand about, double your Reare, and giue Fire.
The Sixth Order. To this Order you must make no Diuision at all, and when you haue giuen Fire according to the Word of Command, you must cause them to stand still, onely turning their faces to the front, and prime vpon their Rests, and when the other File is cleare of the right flanke, they performe the like, I meane, turne to the right hand, and giue fire; then instantly the right flanke Marcheth vp to the front of that File, and the other File pri∣meth vpon their Rest the while, and so all the Files doth the like: note that the body still March∣eth, this Order is vsed when you are Charged vp∣on the right flanke. The Seauenth Order. This order is all one with the last, saue that the flanke as soone as they haue giuen fire, the one halfe marcheth through the Diuision, and the o∣ther by the reare, and rankes in the left flanke, iust as they were before; so the second, third, and all the Files, one after another giues fire. You must cause the first ranke to giue fire, and stand, then the second rancke doth March vp through the first rancke and Files with them, and giues fire, and so of all the rest: note that as soone as the second ranke begins to moue, the body all moues vp to the same distance, as their Order was at first.
depiction of military formations. Right Flanke to the right Hand, and giue fire: Prime on your Rests. Right Flanke to the right Hand, and giue fire.
The Eighth Order. Closing your Diuision, you cause the Compa∣ny to March, and commaund them, make ready all together, then you giue the Word of Com∣mand to them, as soone as they haue discharged, they must Countermarch to the reare; this Or∣der is getting ground, all one with the first Order, saue one marcheth and getteth ground, the other standeth and looseth ground. The Ninth Order. The Captaine commaunds them to make rea∣die altogether, then saith to the first ranke, Giue fire, which done, the one halfe of the Pikes mar∣cheth through the midst of the body, which for that end is deuided, euery man falling into his owne File; this Order is standing, and moues on∣ly by rankes. The Tenth Order. As you are marching, the right flanke stands still, and the second File, which is next vnto doubles him, and then they turne to the right hand, and giues fire, presently vpon that they fall into their first Order, and primes vpon their rest, vntill the rest of the Company bee cleare of them, and then the two vtmost files againe doth the like; looke vpon the sixt Order, and there is no difference, but onely still in doubling the flanckes.
depiction of military formations. First Ranke giue Fire and Countermarch to the Reare. First Ranke giue Fire. First File to your right Hand, double your Flanke, and giue fire.
The Eleuenth Order. This Order differeth nothing from the last, but onely the action must bee performed on the left hand. The Twelfth Order. First, you must cause the second rancke to double the first; then commaund them as they were; next, make them two rankes to Counter∣march: so of all the rest. The Thirteenth Order. Let the first rancke giue Fire, and Counter∣march, the second must March vp where the front was before, and giue fire as the first did, and so of all the rest.
depiction of military formations. First File to your left Hand, double your Flanke, and giue fire. First and second Ranke make ready, second Ranke double your Front, and giue Fire. First Ranke giue Fire, and Countermarch to the Reare.
The Fourteenth Order. The second, third, and fourth Rankes, must March vp, and giue Fire, and Countermarch; so likewise the same Word of commaund, must bee vsed still to make them fall into a square, so shall you haue a square Battalia out of a Diamond, thus. The Fifteenth Order. To this Order, there is no more but commaund them giue fire, and Countermarch, and they will fall into the same Order as they did before, if you would get ground, they must March, if loose ground, they must stand still. The Sixteenth Order. Looke in the fifteenth Order, and as you did that, so must you doe this without any alteration, obseruing that eight giue fire at one time, and no more.
depiction of military formations. Right and left hand files of the second, third, and fourth Ranke march vp, giue fire, and counter-march to the Reare. First Ranke giue fire, and Counter-march. First Ranke giue fire and Countermarch to make a Square.
The Seuenteenth Order. The rankes must be ten foote asunder if the files be fiue, if sixe, then they must be twelue, and as soone as you haue giuen the word of Command, they fall into one file, the right hand flanke stand∣ing still, onely turning his face to the right hand, and so likewise if any occasion serue, you may performe it on the left hand, as followeth in the next Order. The Eighteenth Order. The same Order you obserued on the right, the like must you doe on the left; remember that the files when they doe this, must be in their closest Order: also if you haue any occasion, you may doe it both wayes at once by making a diuision in the midst, the word of Command, is Rankes to your right and left hand, by Conuersion, but then your files must be euen, as foure, or sixe, or eight, or any other euen number, the which is perfor∣med in the next following Order. Ranks to your right and left hand by Conuersion. This Order is done by making a deuision in the middle, to charge the Enemie vpon both flankes, or for to make a lane for great Ordnance, to play betweene them, and is no more but to cause them to be done at once, iust as the former is, onely you must turne to the right and left hand in your Conuersion. Some doe hold that the proper word is, Wheele to the right and left hand, now you are acquainted with both, choose of the two which you list.
Rankes to the right Hand by Conuersion and giue fire. Rankes to your left Hand by Conuersion and giue Fire. Rankes to your right and left Hand by Con∣uersion, and giue Fire.
Deuisions of Pikes and Muskatieres to your right and left hand by Conuersion. Make two deuisions of Pikes, and two of Mus∣kets, then the Pikes next to the right hand deui∣sion, of that must turne to the right flanke of Mus∣katieres by Conuersion, and the Pikes next the left flanke of that, must conuert themselues to that deuision, and the Shot also, as they did in the precedent Order, so shall you make of twenty files but foure files onely. The Twentieth Order. If you please you may discharge by doubling your rankes, or by fingling; as you see occasion you must commaund them to make ready altoge∣ther, this Order is of great force.

How to reduce a Diamond out of a Square, and also out of a Diamond, into a trianguler forme. If you are disposed to turne a square into a Dia∣mond, looke vpon this figure, and you may easily performe it, it is no more but to turne their faces to him that leades the right or left hand file, and so march with the Corner forwards: Likewise out of a Diamond to make suddenly a triangle: first I as you see marcheth vp to make euen with D and K, then N O, the rest as you see it perfor∣med in the figure: note that any iust square will make a Diamond, and out of a Diamond a trian∣gular fashion, and no other number will make them but a iust square.
The reason I set downe here so many seuerall sorts of Battalias, is, because you must when you Imbattell, order them accor∣ding to the scituation, wherefore you cannot ob∣serue one order, therefore as you finde cause take choyse, for variety is neuer hurtfull. The first Battalia of Pikes and Muskets. The square that you see marked with A, must be 49. Pikes, seauen times seauen, and three in the reare; the two flankes marked with B 18. a peece, which are three files, and sixe deepe, the reare C seauen files, and three deepe. 100. The square A in the second Battalia, is 49. whose roote is seauen, the front B is seauen files and three deepe; the two flankes C are three files a peece, and sixe deepe. 204. The Diamond in the midst A, must be 84. be∣ginning first with two, next with foure, and so Diamond wise, vntill you come vnto 84. the foure crosses B, flankes 30. a peece, fiue in file, and sixe deepe.
depiction of military formations.

The proportion of a Campe, or Camps. I Will onely at this time set downe some fewe particulars concerning Encamping; note that you ought not to be ruled by the scituation of any place, but let the scituation be ruled by you, by which meanes you may keepe alwayes one man∣ner of Encamping, which is a great benefit, for thereby the Souldiers by that meanes will be al∣most able, their own selues to know where they must build their Hutts, especially those that are neere the Generalls lodging, and those of the vt∣most workes: note that where the scituation wan∣teth strength, you must supply the same with Art and industry: take heede likewise that whereso∣euer you encampe, you foresee that there bee roome enough to range your Bands according to your owne desired Discipline. And because it is wisedome to deuide the Armed from the Vn∣armed, I would therefore seperate the men that be comberd with any thing from the vncombred. Therefore I would lodge all, or the greatest part of the Armed men on the side towards the East, and vnarmed, and the combred on the West side, making East the head, and West the back part of the Campe, and South, and North, the flankes. The Artillery I would dispose a long the bank of the Trench, and in the space that should remaine
towards the West, I would lodge the impedement of the Campe, and note that forthwith with cords and staues you may ordaine euery man his lodg∣ing, especially if you make (as I said before) your Campe one way. A Generall should not so much seeke to place his Campe in seates strong by na∣ture, as to fortifie them by Art, as well to keepe his Souldiers from idlenes (the only ruine of Armies) as also that due order in Camps may bee maintai∣ned: therefore immitate the ancient Romanes, the very Schoolemasters of the Art of Warre, who neuer coueted other then the plaine to Camp vpon, entrenching themselues nightly in as strong and sure manner, as if the Enemy had encamped by them, and that euen in places vtterly voyde of all suspition, to make these Millitary trauailes fa∣miliar vnto them, and to auoyde those idle, or ra∣ther dissolute effrenate pastimes, that our Christi∣an Camps are still too much bewitched and sor∣ted withall, to the vtter ruine of all good Millita∣rie Discipline, and confusion of our Armies. In set∣ling of a Campe, besides the commodities of Wood, Water, and Forage, you must also con∣sider how victualls may safely come, and leaue no Castles at your back to annoy you, but that you seeke to possesse them ere you march forward, for great is the annoyance that a little pile at the back of an Army may doe as well against Forragers, as to cut off Victualers from the Campe. And thus much for Encamping.

The strongest and perfects fashion of all other for the building of a Curtaine or Wall of a Towne or Fort. THE Circular fashion is counted the best, so that the Curtaines or Walls bee made straight, and of such length, that of the Bul∣warkes they may be flanked, which fashion being made of many Corners, is most meete, if it be e∣rected in a sufficient place, otherwise not, for there it must be builded with fewe Corners, else the one Bulwarke will hurt the other: Therefore the farther that they bee made distant from the Bul∣warke (the duelength of the Curtaine being kept) so much the blunter the corners will come to bee, which by them must be defended, and the more of those Corners that are there in the same fashi∣on, so much the blunter they shall also come to bee; likewise the more men they may haue to de∣fend them, and more commodious space within for to retire, with great and strong fortifications, and the plot formes may bee made much further in, and haue the corners of their Bulwarks blunt, with a large backe, meete for defence, and in an assault much surer then the sharpe, because the sharpe pointed Bulwarke being batterd, defen∣deth the Enemie from the platformes, so that vn∣der the same, being couered, hee may almost out
of danger make an assault, where against a For∣tresse, after the fashion of these plots, following in whatsoeuer part of such places the Enemie should anproach marching towards them, to en∣campe, or in Battell ray to assault them, or with Trenches, and Artillery to batter them, either high or low, or by Curraine within, or otherwise, he shall alwayes from many of those flankers of the same place, be greatly hurt and repulsed, and of the platformes, especially more then from any other where, because they bee most neere, and stand higher then any other, and they shall also hurt him more when hee shall bee somewhat farre off then neere hand, as may be seene by the plaine plot, that hath the number three; and so much concerning Fortifications for this time.

The manner that is vsed of La∣ding and blowing of great Ordnance. FOrasmuch as if the Gunners should chance to be slaine, or otherwise lacking, to the intent that euery Souldier, in the time of neede, may know how to serue in their places, I haue thought good to shew someting of the manner of Lading Blowing off, and Disparting of a Peece of Ord∣nance. Some doe take ⅔ parts of Powder, some halfe, and others aboue ⅔ parts; but that Peece must bee well fortified that may, or will safely blow out ⅔ parts of Powder of the weight of the Bullet. After you know the quantity of Powder, you must put in the soule or concaue of the Peece the said quantity, with the Ladle, and then when the Ladle comes to the Coyle, turne about your hand, and the Powder will be left be∣hinde, then pull out the Ladle, and turne the other ende, and ramm it in softly, then wadd it after∣wards, and last put in your Bullet, and wadd him likewise. But note that before you doe any of these things, you get the dispart of the Peece, which is no more to doe then to put a wyre into the touch-hole of the Peece, to the lower part of the concaue, then marke how high the wyre beares vpon the quoile, which marked, pull him out, and place him at the mussell to the bottome of the Concaue there, and make your Dispart
iust as high as the notch was at the touch-hole: afterwards place the quoile and the toppe of the Dispart in an euen line to the vppermost marke: Thus haue you the true Horizontall line, or line of Leuell; now for quicke dispatch you may make cartreges of Paper, or Linnen baggs, and put a full Charge of Powder in them: So may you make a hole with a Gunners gimlett into the Car∣trege, then prime with fine Corner powder, which is more readier to blowe him off: and when hast requires, you may be the sooner rea∣dy vpon any occasion. Also Wine or Vineger are the best things to coole any Peece of Ord∣nance when they are hott. Questions and Rules concerning Great Ordnance. IF a Saker at Point blancke conuey her Bullet 300. paces, and at the best of her randome shoote 1500. what will that Cannon doe, which at point blanke shootes 360. paces. Multiply 1500. by 360. and deuide it by 300. your question is answered. If a Saker of 4. Inches Diameter weigh 1600. pound weight, what will a Culuerin weigh of 6. Inches Diameter Multiply the Diameter Cubically, then say, if
64. giue 1600. what will 216. giue: Multiply 216. by 1600 your question is resolued. If a Cannon at point blanke range 300 paces, and at the best of her Randome shoot 1500 paces, how farre shall shee shoot at the mount of one Degree. Abate 300 from 1500, rests 1200 which diuided by 45 the quotient is 26⅔ so many paces shall shee shoot at euery degree. If a Cannon of 10 foot long bee shot at a marke 700 yeards from the Peece, the dispart being planting an inch wide, how farre shall the bullet light wide of the marke. Looke how many times the length of the Ci∣lender or Concaue of the Peece is to the marke, so many inches shall the Peece shoot amisse, be∣ing layd ouer or vnder one inche, if the winde be not to rough to alter it. If you measure with a paire of Callaper Com∣passes the greatest height of mettall, at the mossell of the Peece, and likewise at the Coyle; abating the lesser out of the greater, ½ the re∣mainder is the iust disparture. It is a general rule, that look how much a Peece is thicker of mettall in any one side at the quoyle then at the thickest part of the mussell: as also, looke how many times the length of the Peece is to the Marke; so many times that ouerplus of thickenesse shall the bullet flye ouer the marke, being no higher then the Peece, and the Peece
blowne off without her disparture. How to make Granados to shoote in a Peece of Ordnance. THe Balles of mettall must be of the bignesse of the Peeces concaue, and a quarter of an Inch thicke, made three parts of Brasse, and one part of Tinne, but the Brasse ought to bee mel∣ted before the Tinn bee put to it; which Balles you must fill halfe full of fine powder, and the o∣ther halfe full of grosser powder mingled vvith Rosen vvell beaten: so that for three parts of grosse powder, there be one part of Rosen, and then putting in the holes some small Corne pow∣der to make the rest fire, and after they be fired, and throwne, they will breake and flye into a thousand pieces, and both hurt and kill whomso∣euer are neere them.

And so you may proceede infinitely, but now the meanes to extract the roote of any number, is thus found: Suppose your number to be 200, first you must put a prick in euery odde place, begin∣ning first on the right hand with the first, third, fift, and so continue vntill you come to the end of the number, except the last, which somtimes hath but one. Secondly, marke the numbers that belong vnto the last prick towards the left hand: Or whether he haue belonging vnto him one number or two, looke the roote of that number if it be square, and that roote set by a crooked line, as you place the quotient in deuision, and cansell all that square number belonging to that prick. But if the number belonging to that prick bee not a square number, then take the roote of the greatest square, which is contained in it, and place the roote as I said before, and the square of it shall you abate from the number which belong to the last & prick, let the rest be set ouer those numbers cancelled, as you doe in deuision, and so haue you ended that prick, then in the same manner goe forward with the rest. As for example 200, you place your prickes first on the cipher next your right hand, the next 2 the first figure, then I aske what is the roote of 2, and I finde 1, there∣fore I put that in my quotient, and substract it out of 2, and there remaines 1, then I double the quo∣tient, and it is 2 that I place still betweene the two
pricks, then I aske how many times 2 is in 10, and I finde 4 that I put also in my quotient, and sub∣stract it out of 10, then remaines 2, now I square the last figure 4, saying 4 times 4 is 16, which I substract also out of 20, the remainder is 4, which is the truest and speediest way of all. Here I will produce some questions of Arith∣metick, which shall be to the purpose wee haue in hand, and also to shew and make manifest vnto you, how necessary it is for euery Souldier, whe∣ther he be Captaine, Lieutenant, or other Officer whatsoeuer that followes the Warres, to haue good skill in the depth of Arithmetick, as in the extraction of rootes, and also in the Rule of Algebra. 1 A Captaine Generall hauing three great Armies, would cast them into three square Bat∣tels, but he knoweth not how many men he shall set in the front of each Battell. The numbers of the three Armies are these: of the first there are 5625, the second are 9216, the third 15129. Now you must search out the square roote by the former rules, so shall you haue the answer. 2 A Prince hath an Army very great, with which he passeth in a valewe, so that in marching the Front can be but 18 men, and by that meanes the flanke containeth 49352. After that the Ar∣mie hath passed that valewe, the King minding to occupie all the best ground, willeth the Battell to be set square.
You must multiply the flanke by the front, and then your number will be 8088336, and extract the roote, and you shall haue 2844 for your square roote. A Citie should be scaled being double ditched, and the inner ditch 32 foote broad, and the wall 21 foote high: the Captaine commandeth skal∣ling Ladders to be made of the iust height, that would reach from the vtter browe of the inner ditch, to the top of the wall, as in this figure is partly expressed. As thus 32 multiplied in it selfe 1024, then 21 multiplied by it selfe maketh 441, now you must adde both these summes together, and there make 146, then extract the roote which is 3812/76, and that is the iust length of the line A C. Note also this, that if at any time you haue oc∣casion to double any square as a square battaile, or a square Campe: you must take the side of that square, which you would double suppose that battell was before 210: now you haue as ma∣ny more Souldiers as you had, therefore you must double it, the way to double either, the ground or men is thus, multiply 210 by it selfe, and thereof commeth 44100. that must I double 88200, the roote of which number extracted, is the double
and iust square of that number which you had be∣fore 296.84/296. And hereby you may perceiue the ouersight of many men, which being required to double a square plot, doe double the side of it, thinking it easily done. But if they marke it well, he may perceiue that they doe make by that meanes a square 4 times, as bigge as their first figure, was as by this figure any man may see. A peece of Ordnance of 6 inches Diameter in the soule, doth carrie a Bullet of 20 pound waight, what waight shall that Bullet be, that serueth for a peece of Ordnance of 14 inches in the soule. Note that all Globes beare together triple that proposition, that their Diameters doe: So in this example, the proportion of their Diameter being as 14 to 6, or as 7 to 3, I must triple it, and then haue I the proportion of their Globes. Wherfore I set the three fractions thus 777/333, and there make 34/27, that is 1219/27, and so are the pro∣portions of the Globes as well in weight as big∣nesse.
Therefore I must multiply 20, which is the waight of the lesser Bullet, by the numerator of the proportion, and deuide it by the Denomina∣tor, and so shall I haue 25427/2 for the weight of the greater Bullet. There was a King with a great Armie, and his Aduersarie corrupteth one of his Heraulds with gifts, and maketh him sweare, that hee will tell him how many Dukes, Earles, and other Souldi∣ers there are in that Armie: The Herauld loath to loose those gifts, and as loath to bee vntrue to his Prince, deuiseth this answer which was true, but yet not so plaine, that the aduersary could thereby vnderstand that which hee desired, and that answer was this. Looke how many Dukes there are, and for each of them there are twice so many Earles, and vnder euery Earle there are foure times so many Souldiers as there bee Dukes in the field. And when the Master of the Souldiers was taken, the 200 part of them was 9 times so many as the num∣ber of the Dukes. This is a true declaration of each number, quoth the Herauld, and I haue discharged my oath, now guesse how many of each sort there was, marke the worke. And first for the number of Dukes, I set 1 {powerof1} then will the number of Earles be 2 {powerof2} that is 1 {powerof1} by 1 {powerof1} multiplied twice, and the number of Soul∣diers
are 8 {powerof3} that is 2 {powerof2} multiplied by 1 {powerof1} foure times, but because the 200 part of the Souldiers are nine times so many as the number of the Dukes, therefore must 200 part of 8 {powerof3} be equall to 9 {powerof2} and so consequently 8 {powerof3}  1800 {powerof1} and 1 {powerof2}  225 {powerof1} or For if I set 1/200 and 9 as equall together, and would by the Art of Fractions bring the same proportion in whole numbers, I shall haue for 9. this Fraction 1800/200 and seeing the Denominators be all one in 8/200 and is 1600/200 the proportion con∣sisteth betweene the numerators. Then to proceede if 229 be equall vnto one I shall take the roote out of the 225 for 1 and that is 15, which must be the number of the Dukes. And so haue I the first number, wherefore the second number which is the number of Earles, must be 15 times 15 twice, that is 450, and the number of Souldiers shall be foure times 15, mul∣tiplied by 4, 0, that is 27000, and for iust triall of this worke, I take the 200 of the Souldiers that 1350, and I finde it to be nine times 15, that is nine times so many as the number of the Dukes, and so is the question ended.

Admonitions for the Citizens of London and Bristoll. ANd since I haue waded so farre into the Art Millitary, I haue thought good to aduertise thus much in generall; But perticularly, the Ci∣tizens of London and Bristoll. There are in these Cities sundry Companies of three hundred a peece, which are to great by much to obserue Rankes and Files, and diuers o∣ther Orders necessary and much vsefull, vnlesse they are often vsed to be exercised by Deuisions: Neuerthelesse, it was absolutely denyed by the auncient Romanes, who neuer desired more then a hundred in one Company, and therefore they were called Centurions, as much to say as Cap∣taines ouer Hundreds. They who were the terrour of Christendome, for feates of Armes, be our Presidents; and let vs fol∣low the imitation of the Mightiest, rather then of others, whose populous assaults are scaled by the very eye of the Enemie, and repulsed by the dis∣order of the Multitude. I will similize this to the Husband man, who sayes, one Acre well manu∣red, yeeldes more profite then ten ill tillde; so one hundred well experienced, are able encounter with two hundred rawe Souldiers. Some will (peraduenture) say, nay grumble at
this my aduertisement, because they know it may be a greater charge vnto them then now it is, by reason of more Officers that must be vsed, if you lessen your Companies, and not deminish your full Muster. To this I answere; The Cities Lands and Mo∣neyes are infinite, and therefore able to vndergoe so small a burden for the payment of more Offi∣cers, the ripenesse and expertnesse in Millitary skill but lame, and extreme decreped: Adde the assistance of Money to the decrepidnesse of Disci∣pline, and you shall be sure to haue a meane of both sides, the strength of the City will be there∣by much the more inabled, the Honor of it the moe renowned, and the furie the more feared: For what a terror will it strike into the hearts of Strangers, and an amazement to our neighbou∣ring Kingdomes, to see euery Man so skilfull and compleate, Marching, Trouping, and Standing in Battell-ray, like so many Commaunders, the worst not vnworthy the gouernement of a No∣ble Company, daring Bellona and her fiercest assaults, ready to encounter the worst of Stra∣tagems? Now Noble Citizens, the Honor will be your owne, the Strength the Kings, and the Wonder the Worldes, which I hope will be no long time deferred, to the glory of od, the defence of true Christian Religion, and to the generall preserua∣tion of your selues.
Also, there is an other matter, which is not so seemely and Souldier like performed as I haue seene it in Forregine parts: That is, your Mar∣ching into the Field, for you obserue no manner of Order; therefore marke this: Let euery pri∣uate Captaine repaire, to and atend his Colonells Ensigne, and so let the Eldest Colonell march first into the Field, then his Captaines, according to their antiquity: And in comming out, or Trou∣ping in, first the Youngest, then the next, by which meanes, you shall be able and ready to ioyne Battle, without the trauerse vp and downe of so much ground, before you know your right range; for you spend a great part of the day in placing your Companies right in their order. These things amended, and orderly perfor∣med, will adde much Honour to your Cities, and commendations to the Leaders and Officers: and so I rest.
The Authors Farewell to his fayth∣full Friends: Or, his Caueats to his louing Countrey-men. IT is bad Pollicy to let Danger knock at the Doore. Sollid and grounded Courses which keepe dangers aloofe, are better then fine shiffts, and neate deliuerances, when they are neere. Meditation without Practise, is like an vnstrin∣ged Instrument, whereon no Man plaies: Practise without the Theoricke, is like a stringed Instru∣ment, but not well Tunde. It is a Maxime in Millitary proceedings, that those things determined, should not be commu∣nicated, but to those without whome it can not be effected. Beware of too long Consultations, least they flye away with the time: Delayes and protracti∣ons prooue dangerous many times frustrary. An Army of Sagges led by a Lyon, is better then an Army of Lyons led by a Stagge. In Warre, nothing can be worse, then to say, Had I Wist. A Generall told his excusing Souldier, Thou must not fayle twice in Warre. The wisest Captaines, needes not thinke it a derogation to their Valour, or a deminution to their Honor, to rely on Counsell.
Youth are like the first cogitations, not so wise as the second, fitter to Inuent then to Iudge; fitter for Execution then for Counsell; fitter for new Proiects then for setled Businesse. They in con∣duct and managing of Martiall affayres, imbrace more then they can hold, fire more then they can quench, stirre more then they can quiet, flye to the end, without consideration of the meanes. Old men obect too much, consult too long, aduenture too little, seldome driues businesse home to the full: Therefore a mixture must be vsed: Ages Wisedome, and experimentall ad∣uise, ioynd with Youths Valour, and quick dis∣patch, prooues inuincible.
A Postscript to the Reader. COurteous Reader, I had thought to imposed silence to my Penne, and to haue infused a Period to this my Compendium; But I did thinke fitte to adde these few Lines, as a supple∣ment & Postscript, to show the cause of this my writing. The Causa mouens, or, Primum mobile of it, is a declaratory Instruction to my Countrey-men in generall, but especially to No∣ble, (though vnexperienced Tyrones) in whom, there is either an inbred, or an aduenticious de∣sire of Millitary Discipline, or to exositate, or stir vp those that are vnexperienced, to a further prosecution of these generous & well beseeming Qualities. The Terminus ad quem, or, the in∣tentiall scope and drift of this, is for the benefi∣ciall good of my Natiue Countrey. From the
first of these, I doe desire their courteous wel∣wishings; from the second, their gratefull accep∣tation; from the third, their louing approbation: As for the last, though I owe more then I am able, yet when I am able, I will showe more; In the meane time, take this as a depositum. FINIS.
