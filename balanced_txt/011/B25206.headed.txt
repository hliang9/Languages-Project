MY LORDS, YOU can't but be sensible of the great Zeal I have had for King and Kingdom, but more especially for the Church of England, it being the Purest Religion in the World, and most agreeable to the Divine Nature, and it was no less than GOD Himself that planted it by such a Miraculous Power, that it confounded the very Angels, changing Humanily into Divinity; and this could not be obtained without Christ's sacrifising himself to appease the Wrath of an Angry God, that through him Mortals might be capable of a Divine Being: Therefore all that intend to be saved by Christ, are obliged to yield obedience to his Commands: And therefore I would intreat you seriously to consi∣der the Mighty Occasion that calls you hither (the like has not been known for these many Ages) and if God does not give you Wisdom, you will wound instead of curing, and hasten our Ruin; for I must needs tell you, that it is contrary to the Principles of your Religion, To do Evil that Good may come on it: But God may wink at this if you proceed no far∣ther, because he knows that you are but Men, and that you had reason for what you did; yet if I had known of it, it should never have been done: for God is glorified by the Faith and Patience of his Saints, and it has been the Practice of Christians in all Ages to trust God, and to be willing to sacrifise their Lives and Fortunes for his Truth; and I must needs say, My Lords, that most of you have done so too: for if God had given the King Victory, in what a Condition would you have been, by running your selves into imminent dangr, and disgraced your Religion, in not going the Right War; but God suffered it to prosper, because the Roman Catholicks should not attribute their Victory to the Virgin Ma∣ry. But this must not incourage your Lordships to make False steps, for if God overturn∣ed the King for not walking uprightly before him, how much more will he do the King∣dom, if that you should prove unkind or ungrateful to the King? Though I would not be like the Ass to assist the Lion, and then be made a Prey of, nor yet the Fox that de∣lights to see the Lion in trouble; but I would be like the good Samaritan, that heal'd the Wounds by pouring Oil and Wine into them. For I would have all Occasions of Fears and Jealousies to be removed on every side, which His Majesty might have done, if he had pleased; for I told him the Find at the Beginning, but he would not believe; have a care that you are not Ʋnbelievers too: for I never sought any thing but the King and King∣doms Happiness; neither do I desire to have any greater glory in this World, than to have you safe and happy, which you all conclude will be in this Way which you have taken: but you will be deceived if you be not wise. Not that I would have you be ungrateful to the Prinee, nor yet in Slavery; but as you are Free-born, you should keep your selves so: for it was his own Interest that brought him hither as well as yours, and it is but rea∣son that he should have Right done in that Matter; for no body can condemn him for looking after the Right of his Wife: but all the World will highly condemn you to give, or he to receive, the Right of the King; and you must not think to go unpunished: for why should not God be as zealous fot his Laws, as Man is for his; and so exclude you out of his Kingdom, as you do the King out of his. Besides I don't think the Prince has so much to say against the King, as the People supposes; but if there were, God can pardon them upon repentance and amendment; for he has declared, That if your sn be as scarlet, he'll wash you as white as snow. Therefore take not any thing away from the King, only free his Kingdoms from Popery, and let not that have any Dominion: And treat the Prince as a Friend and Great Instrument in assisting towards the Doing of this Great Work; and whatever Good you receive by him, restore it ten-fold in assisting him with your Lives and Fortunes against France, and I don't doubt but by Gods Blessing, you will Conquer and Subdue it; [and from thence to Rome:] for I have a great desire to see the French King, having Fasted Fourteen Days that he should not Conquer us: Therefore fear not his Mighty Army, for God will give you Victory, but make hast and do it; for Gods Hand as well as this Kingdoms will be against it. And in so doing, you will make the Prince Famous through the World; and You by your Wisdom, Justice and Goodness, may be Instrumental to Con∣vince the Roman Catholicks of their Errors; and so in the End obtain a Ʋniversal Peace, which will be Your Eternal Glory not only in this World, but in That to come: Which that the Lord may give you Wisdom to obtain, is the Prayer of. Your Humble Servant And Souls Well-Wisher, ELINOR JAMES.
