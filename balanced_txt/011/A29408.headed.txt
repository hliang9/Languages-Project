A Brief Account of the Proceedings of the French Clergy, in taking away the Pope's Supremacy, &c. By way of Introduction to the following Letter, and Protestation. FOR the better understanding of some Passages in the Letter, and Protestation, it will be necessary to acquaint you with the Original and Progress of that contest, which has so long continued between the Pope, and the French King, and Clergy, of which if you desire to be in∣form'd fully, and at large, I must Refer you to a Book, Published last Year, Entitled. The verbal Process, or Proceedings of the Extraordinary Assembly of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops held at Paris in March 1680/1, and May 1681, Translated out of the Original French Papers. The substance of which take as fol∣lows. The late Pope's having denied the King's Right, called in French Regale, and in Latine Regalia, (which consists in his receiving the Profits of vacant Bishop∣ricks in France, and in the Collation of Dignities, and Prehends, during a vocancy) and Claiming the same as their Right, especially in four Provinces of that Kingdom; the present French King in the Year 1673, caused a Declaration to be Publish'd, and a∣nother in 1675, in which he asserts his Right of Regalia, as well in the four Provinces, as in all other parts of France, and Commands his Officers, ap∣pointed to Collect the Profits of vacant Benefices,
to execute their Office in all Places, without di∣stinction, as Occasions should offer, which was done accordingly, and the Declarations were obeyed by all the Prelats, except the Bishop of Pomiez, who continued a Zealous Stickler for the Pope, agaist, the King in this Point, to the time of his Death. This difference between the Pope, and the King, and Clergy (who opposed the Pope, as well upon their own Account, as the King's, as well shall see anon) still increasing, at last the Clergy, by their Agents Ge∣neral, begg'd leave of the King in 1680/1. That such Prelats as were then at Paris, about the affairs of their Dioceses, might meet and consult, for the puting a speedy stop to some sinister practises of the Court of Rome, repugnant to the tenour of the Canons, the Liberties of the Gallican Church, and the Laws of the Kingdom; which Request being granted, an As∣sembly consisting of six Arch-Bishops, and 35. Bi∣shops was held at Paris in the months of March 1680/1. and May. 1681. To this Assembly the said Agents of the Clergy presented a Memorial in which they Complain that divers Letters (or Briefs) had been dispers'd, in the name of Pope Innocent XI. containing many things very Prejudicial to the Regalia, and to the Gallican Church, viz. The Letter of the 18th of October 1680, which comdemns to the flames, the Sentence of the Parliament of Paris, past the 24th of September 1680, wherein are explained the Laws of the Kingdom, in defence of the Authority of the Bishops. The Letters to the King, to hinder the Execution of the 2, last declarations, about the Regalia.
Also several other Letters, about the business of Pomiez, either to the late Bishop of Pomiez, or to the Arch-Bishop of Tholouse, but especially the 2. last, one of which dated the 23. of September, con∣firms the Election of the Grand Vicars, chosen by the Chapter, in the vacancy of that See, likewise an Injunction to acknowledge them, upon pain of in∣curring the Severest penalties of the Church. The other, deliver'd the first of January, Excommunicates the Arch-Bishop of Tholouse, without using any of the forms observ'd in France; which was Injurious to the Episcopal Dignity, and equally mischievous both to Church and State. The letter about the business of Charonne, &c. That the design of these Letters was to beget a mis∣understanding, and to create a difference between the Pope, and the King, to ruine the Canons, receiv'd, and observ'd in that Kingdome, to engage the Pope, upon bare Informations, without any Appeal, and omisso medio, to Judge, and in his Tribunal at Rome (of his own meer motion, and by the sole motive of the plenitude of his power) to confirm several Elections, which were nul, and void; thereby de∣priving the Bishops of their ordinary Authority, Arch∣bishops, and Primates of their Jurisdiction, and In∣terrupting the Order of Ecclesiastical Proceedings. This Memorial having been read, the Assembly desired the Arch Bishop of Paris, their President, to name six Commissioners, who, together with him∣self, might consider what was to be done in these af∣faires, and to make their Report to the Assembly which, after Consultation, was made accordingly
by the Arch-Bishop of Reims, one of the Commission∣ers, in a long and elegant Speech, the effect of which was as follows, viz. That the Right of the Regalia, which had caused the aforesaid Letters, had been, a very long time, possess'd by their Kings; Alexander the 3d. Inno∣cent the 3d. Clement the 4th. Gregory the 10th. The second Council of Lyon, and Gregory the 11th. Yea their own Council of Bourges, had acknowledg'd and approv'd it. That no Assembly of the French Clergy ever pretended, that businesses, relating to the Regalia, ought to be brought before an Ecclesiastical Tribunal, but to be Debated, and decided by the Jurisdiction of the King's Council only. For confirmation of this, he said that Philip of Valois, by his Order of October 1334. decided all differences of this Nature, which happen'd in his Reign. That Lewis 11. by his declaration of the 24th. of May 1463, prohibits all his Subjects to have any Process, concerning the Re∣galia, before an Ecclesiastical Judge (no, not in the Court of Rome it self) and yet that it did not Appear that either John, 22. or Pious, 2. complain'd of it, That the Province of Britany, which was not reu∣nited to the Crown of France till the Year 1532, was Subjected to the Regalia, by a Degree of Parliament, in 1598, in the Popedom of Clement, 8. who com∣plain'd not of it, no, not to the Cardinal of Ossat, who, then attending the Pope, confesseth that the King might Extend the Regalia upon all the Bishop∣ricks of his Kingdom, That the Principles of the Pope, and of the King cers about the Regalia, were very different (viz.) The Pope believes that
the Regalia is a Right derived from the Church; the King looks on it as a Regal, Temporal, and Inse∣perable Right of the Crown. The Pope relyes on the 2d. Council of Lyon, as a sacred boundary, beyond which we may not pass, but the King (who, not without Rea∣son, Pretends that he is not Subject to a Council for a Right meerly Temporal) doth not own that Autho∣rity of the Council, alleaged against him, but on the contrary His Magisty maintains that his Predeces∣sors could not prejudice his Rights; and that if they had reason to suspend the Execution of the Regalia in the four Provinces, he had much more reason to revive it there; that the Bishops had acknowledg∣ed him for their Judge, and that having pronounc'd Judgment, he is oblig'd to give an account of it to God only. Then the Bishop of Troyes (another of the Com∣missioners.) commended to their Favour, and Pro∣tection, a certain Doctor of the Sorbonne, for a Book written by him, wherein (said he) he justifies the Right, which we have to decide matters of Faith, and Discipline, and to oppose the Authority, which we have im∣mediately received from Jesus Christ, against the novel∣ties, which might arise in our Dioceses, and Provinces. Se∣condly he demonstrator that the Gallican Church is not de∣parted from the Discipline of the Council of Sardica, the Execution of which the Councils, and Ancient Popes have so often recommended, and according to which, the Bishops ought to be tryed first by their Brethren in their Provin∣ces. And these two Maxims are Canonical, and conform∣able to the Spirit of the Church, and to the Sacred Rules, Establish'd by ancient Councils and Authorized by the Holy See.
When he had ended, the Arch-Bishop of Reims con∣tinued his Speech, and said that the Commissioners had examin'd the Pope's Letters, and first, that the occasion of those two, written to the Nuns of Charonne was thus. Their Monstery was founded 1643. By the Duchess of Orleans, who desired the Pope that the first Abbess might be continued daring life, and it was granted. After her decease the King nominates one to succeed her, but she dying before she was confirm'd, he nominates another, who was Esta∣blished Abbess by the Arch-Bishop of Paris in 1679. That the first Letter of 7th of August 1680. forbids the Nuns to obey this Abbess, and commands them to choose another, which they did, without obser∣ving the Rules of Elections; which as soon as the Pope was informed of, he wrote another Letter to them, dated 15th October following, by which the defect of Formalities is supplyed, and this irregular Election of the new Abbess confirmed. That the se∣veral Letters, which the Pope had written to the Arch-Bishop of Tholouse, to the, since deceased, Bishop of Pomiez, and to the Chapter of that Church, since its vacancy, having been caused by the dispute about the Regalia, are to be taken as one ahd the same, and that the Dispute happen'd as follows, viz. The said Bishop refusing to submit to the Declarations of 1673, and 1675. form'd several Processes against such Clergymen, who, by vertue of the Regalia, possess'd some of the Prebends of his Church, which the Arch∣bishop of Tholouse, upon the Appeals brought before him, made void. That on 7th August last, the Bishop dyed, and the old Canons Regular of his Church
Elected, after his decease, some Officers to govern it. That these new Officers continued the Process against the Regalists, which the Bishop had begun, and the Archbishop of Tholouse made them void; complaint whereof being made to the Pope, he wrote two Let∣ters, one to the Archbishop, and the other to the Chapter of Pamiez, which are of no moment. But by a Letter of 2d. October following, to the Chapter and Conons Regular of Pamiez, the Pope confirms the Officers, nominated by the Chapter, and enga∣geth to confirm such as shall be chosen; he forbids them to own any others; he declares null whatever shall be done by Vicars General, which shall not be chosen by the old Canons, and orders this Letter to be read in the Diocess of Pomiez. That a Letter of Newyears-day last confirms, a second time the Offi∣cers, Elected by the Chapter, and declares that the Pope will confirm such as this Chapter shall Elect; that it Excommunicates with the greater Excommu∣nication (which is immediately incurr'd, without any other Declaration) all such as shall favour the Grand Vicars, chosen by the Archbishop, and the Canons, that are Regalists, or shall favour the said Metropolitan; and in fine, that it Excommunicates the Metropolitan himself. In the next place he tells them that the first Parliament of the King∣dome having pass'd a Decree 24th Sept. against the Pope's Letter of 7 Aug. to the Nuns of Charonne, the Commissioners were of opinion, that it was their In∣terest to joyn with the Parliament therein; tho the said Decree was Condemned by a Letter of 18th De∣cember following, which forbids the reading of it,
upon pain of Excommunication, and Commands the Bishops, or Inquisitors to burn all the Copies of it that can be found, &c. Then he mentions the reflections of the Commis∣sioners upon these matters; some of which are that by the Pope's two Letters to the Nuns of Charonne, granted upon their bare Relation, and in their own Cause, all is vacated that their Archbishop had done, without hearing, or so much as summoning him. That by reason of a Clause Inserted in the se∣cond Letter, viz. that the Pope hath power to supply all formes, that may be omitted, even such as are Essen∣tial; it is pretended that he can supply the want of that very knowledg of a matter, which, by the Law of Nature, is absolutely necessary, before a judgment can be given of it. That the Proceedings against the Archbishop of Tholouse, were contrary to Equity, and the Rules of their Profession, and also to the Treaty, call'd the Concordat, which was made between Leo 10. and the Holy See, on the one part, and Francis 1. and his Kingdome, on the other part, and being Authoris'd by both Parties, is become a Law both in Church and State, and consequently cannot in the least be debilitated by any pretended Power from the Pope. And having proved these things excellently, and at large, he proeeeds to acquaint the Assembly with the Resolutions which their Commissioners had judg'd fit to be taken in that conjuncture, viz. That a Letter be written to the Pope to represent to him that the business of the Regalia deserved not so much heat as is expressed in his Letters, it being look'd up∣on by the King's Officers as a Temporality, and that
it is in itself, a thing of no great consequence to the Church. That by the Letters to the Nuns of Cha∣ronne, and Chapter of Pamiez, the Order of Juris∣dictions had been disturb'd, and the Right of Ordi∣naries, and Metrapolitans violated; that he had been exalted above the Canonical Constitutions, and that these Designs against Rules the most Sacred might weaken that Union, which the Churches of France ought inviolably to keep with the holy See. And lastly, that the King be desired to permit the Prelates of his Kingdome to meet in a National Council, or to call a General Assembly of the Clergy, to consist of two Deputies of the first Order, and two of the second, in every Province, and that their President, and six Commissioners be desired to attend his Ma∣jesty upon this occasion, which being done accor∣dingly, the King was pleased to Order a General As∣sembly of the Clergy, who having duely considered the entolerable encroachments and usurpations of the See of Rome, did, 19. March 1602. S.N. Unanimous∣ly Resolve as follows, viz. That a General Council is above the Pope. That he has no power, in Temporals, in any Prince's Dominions. That he has no power to Depose Princes. That he has no power to Absolve Subjects from their Oaths of Fidelity. That he is not Infallible. The first of these Resolutions destroys the Pope's Supremacy in Temporals; and the last destroys his Infallibility.
The next day the Assembly, by their President, and Com∣missioners, presented to His Majesty these Resolutions, signed by the whole Assembly, and he, at their request, caused an Edict to be Published, thereby Ordering that the same be Register'd in all the Courts of Parliament, in all Courts of Judicature Ecclesiastical, and Civil, and in all Universities, and Colliges in his Dominions. That all Professors in Divi∣nity, and Canon Law, do teach the Doctrin therein contain∣ed (being the ancient Doctrine of that Kingdome) and do subscribe the same. That no Person Secular, or Regular shall be received as Doctor, or Licentiate in Divinity, or Canon Law, till he has maintain'd this Doctrine by publick Disputation. And that no person, either Subject, or Stran∣ger, shall presume to teach any thing, contrary to this Doctrine, within his Dominions. The said Resolutions were the 23d of March Ratified, and pass'd in the Parliament of Paris, and a Copy of them sent to the Pope, together with a particular Account of all their Proceedings, and their Reasons for what they had done. But the Pope, instead of acknowledging his Usurpations, which had been the cause of these Proceedings of the Assembly, vindicates himself, and by the following Letter, damns and makes utterly null, and void, all that had been done, or should be done in this As∣sembly, and they in requital make, and send him the Pro∣testation, which damns his damnatory Letter, and justifies their said Proceedings.
Literae Pontificiales ad Clerum Gallica∣num. Venerabilibus Fratribus Archi Episcopis, Episcopis, &c.

ab aliquibus Ordinis Ve∣stri piis & fortibus Viris appel∣lati, abs{que} mora insurreximus, & jampridem in gradu stamus; nullas privatas nostras rationes secuti sed debitae Ecclesiis omnibus solicitudini, & intimo amori er∣ga vos satisfacturi. Nihil sane laetum, & Vestris nominibus dignum eas Literas con∣tinere, in ipso earum limine intel∣leximus; Nam, praeter ea, quae de Norma in Comitiis convocan∣dis, peragendis{que} servata affere∣bantur, animadversimus ea or∣diri a metu Vestro, quo suasore nunquam sacerdotes DEI esse solent, in arduis & excelsis pro Religione & Ecclesiastica Liber∣tate, vel aggrediendo fortes, vel perficiendo constantes; quem qui∣dem metum falso judicavistis, posse Vos in sinum Nostrum ef∣fundere. In sinu enim nostro hospitari perpetuo debet charitas Christi, quae foras mittit, & lon∣ge arcet a se Timorem; qua cha∣ritate erga vos, Regnum{que} Galliae, Paternum Cor Nostrum flagrare, multis jam ac magnis experimen∣tis cognosci potuit, quae huic re∣ferre non est necesse. Si quid est autem in quo bene merita de vo∣bis sit Charitas nostra, esse inpri∣mis putamus, hoc ipsum Regaliae Negocium, ex quo, si serio res perpendatur, omnis Ordinis vestri

Timuistis ergo, ubi non erat ti∣mor; Id unum timendum Vobis erat, ne apud Deum, homines{que} redargui jure possetis loco, at{que} honori vestro & Pastorali Officio debito defuisse; Memoriae vobis, repetenda erant quae Antiqui illi Sanctissimi Praesules, quos quam∣plurimi postea qualibet aetate sunt imitati Episcopalis Constantiae & Fortitudinis exempla. In hujus∣modi casibus, ad vestram erudi∣tionem ediderunt, intuendae Ima∣gines Praedecessorum Vestrorum, non solum, qui patrum, sed qui nostra quo{que} memoria floruerunt. Et qui Ivonis Carnotensis dicta laudatis, debuistis facta etiam, cum res posceret, imitari. Nostis quae is fecerit, passus{que} sit in turbulenta illa & periculosa con∣tentione inter Urbanum Ponti∣ficem, & Philippum Regem, mu∣neris sui esse arbitratus contra Regiam indignationem stare, Do∣nis spoliari, carceres & exilia perferre, deserentibus aliis Cau∣sam meliorem. Officii vestri erat sedis Apostolicae authoritati studia vestra adjungere, & pastorali pectore, humilitate sacerdotali, Causam Ecclesiarum vestrarum apud Regem agere; Ejus consci∣entiam de tota re instruendo, e∣tiam cum periculo, Regium in vos animum Irritandi, ut possetis in posterum sine Rubore quotidiana
Psalmodia DEUM alloquentes Davidica verba proferre; Lo∣quebar de Testimon is in con∣spectu Regum & non con∣fundebar. Quanto magis id vobis faciendum fuit, tam per∣specta at{que} explorata optimi Prin∣cipis Justitia & Pietate, quem singulari benignitate, Episcopos audire, Ecclesiis favere, & Epis∣copalem potestatem intemeratam velle, Vos ipsi scribitis, & Nos magna cum voluptate legimus in literis vestris. Non dubitamus si stetissetis ante Regem, pro causae tam justae defensione, ne{que} de futura vobis verba, quae loque∣remini, ne{que} Regi Cor docile, quo vestris annueret postulatis. Nunc cum muneris vestri & Regiae aequitatis quodammodo obliti' in tanti momenti negotio, silentium tenueritis, non videmus quo pro∣babili fundamento fignificetis vos ad ita agendum aductos; Quod in controversia victi sitis, quod causa cecideritis; quomodo cecidit qui non stetis? Ecquis Vestrum tam gravem, tam justam cau∣sam, tam sacrosancta moravit a∣pud Regem? Cum tamen Praedeces∣sores vestri cum in simili periculo constituti, non semel apud su∣periores Galliae Reges, imo apud hunc ipsum libera voce defende∣rint victores{que} a Regio conspe∣ctu'discesserint, Relatis etiam ab aequissimo Rege praemiis Pastora∣lis
Officii strenue impleti. Quii vestrum in arenam descendit, ut opponeret murum pro Domo Is∣rael? Quis ausus est invidiae se offerre? Quis vel vocem unam emisit memorem pristinae libertatis? Clamarunt interim, sicuti scribitis, & quidem in mala causa; pro Regio jure cla∣marunt Regis Administri, cum vos in optima pro Christi honore sileritis; ne{que} illa solidiora, quod redituri nobis rationem, seu ve∣rius Excusationem allaturi, Re∣rum in hujusmodi Comitiis per Vos actarum, exaggeratis pericu∣lum, ne sacerdotium & Imperi∣um inter se collidantur, & mala quae exinde in Ecclesiam & Rempublicam consequi possent; proinde existimasse Vos ad of∣ficium vestrum pertinere, aliquam inire rationem tollendi de medio Gliscentis Dissidii, nullam ve∣ro apparuisse Commodiorem, remedio ab Ecclesiae Patri∣bus indicato, utili condescentio∣ne Canones temperandi, pro tem∣porum necessitate; ubi ne{que} Fidei veritas ne{que} morum honestas pe∣riclitentur debere, ab ordine vestro deberi a Gallicana, imo ab uni∣versa Ecclesia, Plurimum Regi tam praeclar de Catholica Reli∣gione merito & indies Magis mereri cupienti: Propterea vos jure vestro decedentes, illud in Regem contulisse. Omittimus
hic commemorare, quoe significa∣tis de appellato a vobis Seculari Magistratu, a quo victi disces∣seritis. Cupimus enim hujus facti memoriam aboleri, & vo∣lumus ea vos verba e literis vestris expungere, ne in Actis Cleri Gallicani resideant ad de∣decus vestri nominis sempiter∣num. Quae de Innocentio ter∣tio, Benedicto duodecimo, Boni∣facio octavo in vestram de∣fensionem adducitis, non defu∣ere, qui vestris lucubrationibus ostenderint, quam frivola at{que} extranea sint huic Causae. Et magis notum est quam ut opus sit commemorare quo Zelo qua Constantia, eximii illi Pon∣tifices Ecclesiae Libertatem de∣fenderint adversus Seculares po∣testates, tantum abest, ut eorum Exempla Possint errori vestro suf∣fragari. Caeterum altro admitti∣mus, & Laudamus concilium re∣laxandi Canonum disciplinam pro Temporum necessitate, ubi id fieri Possit, Sine fidei & morum dis∣pendio; Imo addimus cum Au∣gustino, toler andi aliquando pro Bono Unitatis, qua pro Bono A∣quitatis odio habenda sunt; Ne{que} eradicanda Zizania, ubi periculum sit, ni simul etiam Triticum eridi∣cetur. Id ita tamen accipi oportet, ut in aliquo tdntum peculiari casu & ad tempus, & ubi necessitas ur∣get licitum sit, Siouti Factum est
ab Ecclesia cum Arrianos, & Do∣nitistas Episcopos ejurato errore, suis Ecclesiis restituit, ut populos, qui secuti eos fuerant, in Officio contineret. Aliud est, ubi disci∣plina Ecclesiae, per universum Amplissimi Regni ambitum sine Temporis termino, & cum mani∣festo periculo, ne Exemplum la∣tius manet labefactetur, imo ever∣titur ipsius Disciplinae & Hierarchae Ecclesiasticae fundamentum, sicu∣ti evenire necesse esset, si quae a Rege Christianissimo in negocio Regaliae nuper acta sunt, conni∣ventibus, imo consentientibus Vo∣bis contra Sacrorum Canonum & praesertim Generalis Consilii Ludg∣dunensis Authoritatem, contra no∣tam jampridem Vobis in ea re mentem nostram, & contra ipsam Jurisjurandi Religionem, qua vos Deo, Romanae vestrisque Eccle∣siis obligastis, cum Episcopali Ca∣ractere imbueremini; Haec sancta sedes Executioni mandari & ma∣lum invalescere diutius deferendo permitteret, ac non ea nos protra∣dita Divinitus humilitati nostrae suprema in universam Ecclesiam potestate, solenni more praedecesso∣rum nostrorum vestigiis inheren∣tes improbaremus? Cum praeser∣tim per abusum Regalioe non solum everti disciplinam Ecclesiae res ipsa doceat; sed etiam Fidei ipsius integritatem in discrimen vocari, facile intelligatur ex ipsis Regi∣orum
Decretorum verbis, quae jus conferenda Beneficia Regi vindi∣cant; non tanquam prosluens ex ali∣qua Ecclesiae concessone, sed tan∣quam Ingenitum & Caevum Re∣giae Coronae. Illam vero par∣tem literarum vestrarum non si∣ne Animi horrore legere potui∣mus, in qua dicitis, vos jure vestro decedentes illud in Regem contu∣lisse; quasi Ecclesiarum, quae cu∣rae vestrae cerditae fuere, essetis ar∣bitri non custodes, & quasi Eccle∣siae ipsae & Spiritualia earum ju∣ra possent sub potestatis secularis jugum mitti ab Episcopis, qui se pro earum libertate in servitutem dare deberent. Vos sane ipsi hanc veritatem agnovistis & confessi estis, dum alibi pronunciastis Jus Regaliae Servitutem quandam es∣se, quae in eo praesertim quod spe∣ctat Beneficiorum Collationem im∣poni non potest; nisi Ecclesia con∣cedente vel saltem consentiente. Suo jure vos ergo jus illud in Re∣gem contulistis? Cum Sacri Ca∣nones distrahi vetent jura Ecclesia∣rum quo modo ea vos distrahere, in Animum induxistis, quasi eorun∣dem Canonum Authoritati dero∣gare liceat vobis? Revocate in Memoriam, quoe inclitus ille Con∣teraneus vester Clarevalensis Ab∣bas non Gallicanae modo, sed eti∣am universalis Ecclesiae lumen a vobis merito nuncupatus, Eugeni∣um Pontificem officii sui admonens
reliquit Scripta praeclare memi∣nisset, si esset cui claves creditae cui oves creditae sunt. Esse quidem et alios coeli Janitores & Gregum Pastores, sed cum habeant illi As∣signatos Greges, singuli singulos, ipsi universos creditos, uni unum nec modo ovium sed et Pastorum Eu∣genium esse pastorem. Ideo{que} jux∣ta Canounum statuta alies Episco∣pos vocatos fuisse in partem solici∣tudinis ipsum in plenitudinem po∣testatis. Ex quibus verbis quan∣tum vos admoneri par est de ob∣sequio et obedientia, quam debetis huic Sanctae sedi, cui nos Deo Au∣thore quamquam immeriti praesi∣demus, tantundem pastoralis nostra solicitudo excitatur ad inchoan∣dum tandum aliquando in hoc ne∣gocio, quam nimia fortasse longa∣nimitas nostra, dum poenetentia spa∣tium damas, hactenus distulit A∣postolici muneris Executionem. Quamobrem per praesentes literas tradita nobis ab Omnipotenti Deo Autoritate, improbamus, rescindi∣mus, & Cassamus quae in vestris commitiis acta sunt in negotio Re∣galliae, cum omnibus inde secutis, & quae in posterum attentari con∣tingent, ea{que} perpetuo inita, & inania declaramus, quam∣vis cum sint ipsa per se manifesto nulla Cassatione aut decla∣ratione hujusmodi non egerent. Speramus tamen vos ipsas{que} ipsos re melius considerata caeteri
retractione consulturos conscientiae vestrae, & Cleri Gallicani existi∣mationi ex quo Clero, Sicuti huc usque non defuerè, ita in posterum non defuturos considimus, qui Boni Pastoris Exemplo libenter animam parati sint pro Ovibus, & pro Testemento Patrum suorum. Nos quidem, pro Officii nostri debito, parati sumus Dei adjutrice gratia sacrificari sacrificium justiciae, & Ecclesia Dei jura ac libertatem, & hujus sedis sanctae Authoritatem Dignitatemque de∣fendere, nihil de nobis, sed omnia de eo presumentes; qui nos confor∣tat, & operatur in nobis, & qui jussit Petrum super aquas ad se venire. Praeterit enim figura hujus Mundi, & Dies Domini appropinquat. Sic ergo aga∣mus, venerabiles Fratres ac dilecti Filii, ut cum summus Pater fa∣milias, & Princeps Pastorum ra∣tionem ponere voluerit, cum servis suis sanguinem pessundatae, & Laceratae Ecclesiae quam suo ac∣quisivit de nostris manibus non requirat. Vobis interim omnibus Apostolicam Benedictionem cui Caelestem accedere optamus intimo Paterni amoris affectu imparti∣mur. Datum Romae &c.
The Popes Letter to the Clergy of France, To the Reverend Brethren, the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, &c. IT hath been an extream grief and disturbance to that Paternal af∣fection, which we have for our dear Son Lewis, the Most Christian King, your Churches, your selves, and the whole Kingdom, to under∣stand, by your Letter to us, dated Feb. 3. that the Bishops, and Clergy of France, which heretofore were the Crown, and joy of the Apostolick See, should now so demean them∣selves as to compel us with many tears, to use the saying of the Prophet, The Sons of my Mother have fought against me: though indeed you ra∣ther fight against your selves, while you oppose us in that Cause, in which the Welfares and Liberties of your Church∣es are involved, and in which
being called upon, by some pious and couragious men of your Order, we immediately appeared, for the defence of the Episcopal Rights and Dig∣nity, in that Kingdom, and we have already begun to act; not regarding our own private Interests, but shall give due satisfaction to all the Churches, and also to our own care of, and Affection to∣ward you. That your said Letter con∣tains nothing in it, either plea∣sing to us, or worthy of your selves, the very beginning of it discovers; for, besides what it mentions of a Rule, observed in calling, and holding Assem∣blies, we take notice that it proceeds from Fear, which Gods Priests were never wont to choose for their Counsellor, in matters of Difficulty, and importance, relating to Religi∣on, and Ecclesiastical Liber∣ty, either in attacking the vali∣ant, or compleating the con∣stant; which fear you falsly supposed you could have infu∣sed into our breast. For the love of Christ, which casts out, and drives away fear, ought always to dwell there; and with what affection our fatherly bowels have yearn∣ed toward you, and the
Kingdom of France, hath been manifested by many Signal instances, which it will be needless here to insert. But if our love merits well of you in any thing, we think it doth particularly in the business of the Regalia, on which if you seriously consider it, the whole Dignity, and Authority of your order depends. So that you have seared where no fear was; whereas you should only have feared the just censure both of God, and Men, for having been want∣ing to your Duty, Honour, and Pastoral Office: you should often have called to mind the holy Prelates of old, whose examples of Episcopal con∣stancy and courage, were fol∣lowed by many in after ages. In such cases the lives of your Predecessors are proposed for your Imitation, not only those who flourished in your Fathers days, but even within your own Memory. And you, who commend the sayings of I∣von Carnocensis, should also have imitated his acti∣ons, where occasion re∣quired it; you know what he did, and suffered in that tur∣bulent and dangerous Conten∣tion, between Pope Urban, and King Philip, thinking it his
Duty to incur the Kings dis∣pleasure, to be deprived of his goods, and indure imprison∣ment, and exile, while others deserted that Righteous cause. It is your Duty to joyn your Endeavours with the Authori∣ty of the Apostolick See, and with a Pastoral heart, and Priestly humility, to plead the cause of your Churches before the King, by informing his Conscience of the whole mat∣ter, though it be with the danger of Provoking his indig∣nation against you; that so you may, hereafter, be able, without blushing, to sing daily the words of David, I have declared thy Testimonies before Kings and was not ashamed. How much rather then ought you to have done the like, having had large experience of the Justice and Piety of the best of Kings, who (as your selves have written, and we with great delight, have read in your letter of his singular good∣ness,) hearkens to the Bishops, favours the Churches, and preserves the Episcopal Power inviolate; so that had you pleaded with the King in the defence of so just a Cause, we doubt not, either that you would have wanted words to express your desires, or he in∣clinations
to grant them: But having, as it were, forgot your own duty, and the Kings e∣quity, you have been silent in a business of so great mo∣ment, and we cannot imagine upon what probable ground you say you were induced to it, that you were overuled in the controversy; and that you fell in the cause; for how can he fall who never stood? Did any of you ever plead in so just, so weighty, and so sacred a Cause before the King? And yet your Predecessors, when they were in the like danger, have many times, with great freedom, defended this Cause, in the presence of former Kings of France, yea, before this very King too, and have returned victorious, bringing with them the reward of a Pa∣storal Office from that just Prince. Who among you en∣ters the Lists to fight for the House of Israel? who dares ex∣pose himself to envy? who hath spoken so much as one word in memory of the An∣tient Liberty? They have in∣deed (as you write) spoken loud enough, but it was in a bad Cause; and when the Kings Ministers cried aloud for the Kings Right; you in the best of Causes (viz. for the
Honour of Christ) were si∣lent. Nor is it of any more validity that when you give us an account of (or more truly make your excuse for) what you had done in such Assem∣blies, you aggravate the jea∣lousie that the Ecclesiastical, and Secular Powers were like to clash, and that great mis∣cheifs might follow thereup∣on, both to Church and State, and therefore you thought it your Duty to consider, how a stop might be put, to the grow∣ing differences; and that none seem'd more Proper to you, than that which was prescri∣bed by the Fathers of the Church, viz. a wholesome Condescention for moderating the Canons, according to the necessity of the time, when neither the verity of the Faith or honesty of manners will be endangered thereby. Then you declare that your Order, the Gallican Church, yea, the Universal Church, owes very much to your renowned King, who, you say, has already merrited highly of the Catho∣lick Religion, and strives dayly to merit more; by which Act you have relinquished your right, and have given it to the King. We forbear here to mention what you tell us of
the Secular Magistrate you ap∣pealed to, and were overcome by him, for we desire that the memory of that action may be oblitterated, and would have you expunge those words out of your Letter, that they may not remain among the Acts of the Gallican Clergy, to the per∣petual infamy of your Names. As for what you alledge in your defence, concerning In∣nocent, 3. Benedicti, 12. and Bo∣niface 8. Some have not been wanting, who have shewed you how frivolous, and fo∣reign it is to this Cause. And it is so well known that it needs not to be mentioned with what Zeal and constancy, those fa∣mous Popes defended the Li∣berty of the Church against the Secular Power, so farr are their examples from favouring your errour. But we freely allow, and com∣mend the advice of modera∣ting the discipline of the Ca∣nons, according to the necessity of the times, when it may be done without any injury to Faith, and Manners; yea, I add with St. Augustin, That may sometimes be allowed for the sake of Unity, which for the sake of equity ought to be abhorr'd. Nor are the tares to be plucked up when there is danger of pluck∣ing
up the Corn with them. Yet this ought so to be under∣stood as that it is Lawful in some purticular cases only, and for a time, and when ne∣cessity requires; as the Church did when she restored the Ar∣rians and Donatist Bishops to their Churches, as soon as they had renounced their errours, that she might keep the peo∣ple, which had followed them, in their due obedience to her. But it is otherwise when the Discipline of the Church is de∣stroyed, throughout so great a kingdom, without any limitati∣on of time, and when there is manifest danger that the infecti¦on will spread farther, yea, the very foundation of Discipline, and of Ecclesiastical Hierarchy it self is subverted; and this must needs be, if you connive at, yea consent to those things, which the most Christian King has lately Ordered in the busi∣ness of the Regalia, contrary to the Authority of the Sacred Ca∣nons, and particularly those of the General Counsel of Lyons, contrary to our mind in that affair, long since signified to you, and contrary to the very obligation of that Oath with which you bound your selves to God, and to the Roman, and your own Churches, when
you received the Episcopal Character. Should the Holy See, suffer this mischief to be put in execution, and to get ground by farther Delays? or shall we not, according to the supream Power over the Church Universal, given by God to our humility and treading in the steps of our Predeces∣sors solemnly damn it? and the rather, since it plainly appears, that not only the Discipline of the Church is subverted, by the abuse of the Regalia; but that the soundness of the Faith is also called in Question, may easily be discovered by the very words of the King's De∣crees, which claim for him that Right of conferring Be∣nefices, not as being derived from any concession of the Church but as connote, and coeval with the Regal Crown; but I could not, with∣out extream horror of mind, read that part of your Letter, which tells us, that you have quitted your Right, and have transferred it to the King, as if you had the absolute disposal, not the Gaurdianship of the Churches committed to your charge, and as if the Church∣es themselves, and their Spiritu∣al Rights might be subjected, to the yoke of Seeular Power
by the Bishops, who for the Liberty thereof, ought to un∣dergo the greatest Servitude. And indeed you your selves confess this truth, by saying elsewhere, That the Right of the Regalia is a kind of Servi∣tude, which (especially as it relates to the collation of Be∣nefices) cannot be imposed, but by the Grant; or at least by the consent of the Church. By what Right then have you transferred that Right to the King? And since the sacred Canons prohibit the alienation of the Rights of your Church∣es, how could you bring your minds to alienate them, as if you could lawfully derogate from the authority of those Canons? Remember what is what is written by your fa∣mous Countrey-man, Clare∣valensis Abbas (by you deser∣vedly called the Light, not on∣ly of the Gallican, but of the Universal Church) who admo∣nishing Pope Eugenius of his duty, tells him that, If he was the person, to whom the Keys and to whom the Sheep were committed, tho' there were other keepers of Heaven Gates, and Pastors of Flocks, yet, while they had each their particular Flocks designed them, all of them, and they themselves also, were com∣mitted
to him alone; and that Eugenius was the sole Shepheard, not only of the Sheep but of the Shepheards too; and therefore ac∣cording to the Decrees of the Ca∣nons, whereas other Bishops were called to take part of the care, and charge, he was called to the full power. By which words, as you are admoni∣shed of that duty and obedi∣dience, which you owe to the holy See, (of which by the divine Authority we, though unworthy, are President) so is our Pastoral care excited, to begin at length to execute our Apostolick duty in this affair, which, perhaps, our too much patience, in giving space for repentance, has hitherto de∣fer'd; wherefore according to the Authority, given unto us by Almighty God, we do, by these Presents, damn, abolish, and utterly make void, all that has been done by your Assem∣bly in the business of the Regali∣a, and all that has since ensued thereupon; together with whatsoever shall hereafter be done: And we do declare the same to be forever null and void, tho', being manifestly null of it self, it needed no such damnation, or declaration. But we hope that, upon bet∣ter
consideration, you your selves will by a voluntary re∣cantarion, consult the quiet of your own Consciences, and the reputation of the Gallican Clergy; among whom, as there never has been, so I trust, there never will be wanting, some, who, after the Example of the good Shepherd, will readily lay down their lives for the Sheep and for the Testament of their Fathers. And as for our own part we are ready, according to the duty of our Office, to offer up the Sacrifice of Righ∣teousness (by the assistance of the Divine Grace) and to de∣fend the Rights and Liberties of God's Church, and the Au∣thority, and Dignity of this Holy See; not presuming on our own strength, but expecting all from him, who strengthens us, and works in us, and com∣manded Peter to come to him upon the water. For the fashion of this world passeth away, and the Day of the Lord is at Hand. Wherefore, Reverend Brethren, and dear Sons, let us so de∣mean our selves that when the great Master of the House∣hould, and Prince of Pastors shall call his Servants to an ac∣count, he may not require at at our hands the Blood of his
afflicted and dismembred Church, which he hath pur∣chased with his own. In the mean time with our dearest af∣fection, and Paternal Love we send Apostolick benediction to you all, to which we pray that Gods Blessing may be ad∣ded. Dated at Rome 11th. April 1682.
Protestatio Cleri Gal∣licani.

The Protestation of the Gallican Cler∣gy. THE Galli∣can Church is Govern'd by her own Laws, and keeps in∣violate her own Cu∣stoms, which the Gal∣lican Prelates, our Ancestors, would not in the least suffer to be infring'd by any De∣cree, or Authority what∣soever, and which the Popes themselves have vouchsafed to ac∣knowledge and com∣mend: Yet now those just Laws, which the Old Gallican Religion,
and venerable Anti∣quity had made unal∣terable, are like to be destroyed; for (which cannot be mention'd without great trouble of mind) these last preceding years, A∣postolick Letters have been dispers'd through the several Provinces, and Cities of France, by which the Ancient Rights of the Gallican Church, and statutes of our Country are openly violated; for by them we find, that, contrary to our usages, cognisance of the af∣fairs both of our Kingdom, and Church∣es, has been usurped, sentence pronounced, without hearing the parties concerned, the
Jurisdiction of the Bishops trampled on, and in fine the Sword of Excomunication drawn, contrary to the Ecclesiastical Ca∣nons, and Customs of the famous Galican Metropolitan Church. Now the Gallican Clergy are troubled, and complain that by rea∣son of these, and other things done since, the Liberties of their Churches are oppress'd the peace of the Church disturb'd the pontifi∣cal Order disgrac'd, and the bounds fix'd by their Ancestors, Trans∣gres'd: And that they may not be thought to abandon their Cause, and Duty, or betray their Dignity,
and the profits of their Churches, they have determined openly to declare against these things by a publick Protestation, and thereby to remove from themselves the scandal of a base and cowardly silence, that so, according to the example of their Fa∣thers, they may provide that hereafter nothing may be able to in∣jure the Rights, and Liberties of the Gal∣lican Church; and they do the rather incline to this opi∣nion, because Pope Innocent xi. being a strict executor of antient Customs, and Canonical Discipline will not suffer any
injury to be done to the Decrees of his Prede∣cessors, and those pub∣lick Canons which made void whatsoever had crept in, contra∣ry to the private Rights of the Provin∣ces; for they would not permit the privi∣ledges of the Churches to be confounded which ought always to be preserved. Wherefore the said Gallican Clergy having first pro∣fessed all due Reverence and Obedience, which they ever have paid, and ever will pay, to St. Peters See where they acknowledge a greater Power re∣sides) have deter∣mined to Declare and protest and by these Pre∣sents
do Declare and Protest, in the pre∣sence of the most Noble Lord Joannes Baptista Laurus, Apostolick Protonotary, and Au∣ditor of the Apostolick Legation in France, that, neither the Popes Letters to the Bishop of Pamiez Dated October the 2d. 1680. to the Chapter of the Church of Pa∣miez the same day, to the Arch Bishop of Tholouse, January the 1. 1681, to the Nuns, or Female Ca∣nonical Regulars, of the Congregation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Monastery of Charonne August the 7th, and 15. Octo∣ber, or by any others
since, or by any things acted, or done by Vertue of the same, the least Damage, or prejudice whatsoever can accrew to the Rights of the Gal∣lican Church; nor can he, at other places, and times, draw this into Precedent, and Authority, that he should thereby presume to oppose the Ancient Canons of the Church, Customs of the King∣dom, and the receiv'd usages of the Gallican Church, or that there∣fore he should think that he may do what he lists. On the con∣trary, let all Men know that this doth not at all hinder the Canons, Customs, Rights, and
Liberties of the said Church, from retaining and keeping their An∣tient force, and Au∣thority, the Gallican Clergy having thus provided for, and se∣cured themselves, and their Priveledges, do Will, and Require that these Presents be made publick that so no Man may pretend Igno∣rance. Dated in the General Assembly of the Gallican Cler∣gy at Paris, May the 6th. 1682. FINIS.
