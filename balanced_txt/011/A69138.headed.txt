WHan among other / dyuers and sondrie wor¦kes / whiche of late dayes I dyd rede most blessed father / in this your moost famous & goodly lybrary / there came vnto my hādes a certayne lytell Greke boke / whiche contayned the gyfte or graunt of Constantyne: I thought it mete & cōuenyent to translate it out of greke in to latyn / and also yt I ought to dedycate or entytle it to your most holy fatherhed / whiche are the deputie of Christ / and of Peter / and the successoure also of Syluester / for be¦cause there be many men whiche haue sayde and wyll abyde by it / that thys gyfte or graunte of Constan∣tyne is false / counterfeyted & fayned / amonge whom Laurēce Valla is one / a man surely well lerned / whi∣che presūtuousli hath taken in hāde to write a boke of the false & forged gyfte of Cōstantyne.

¶The decree imperiall written & gyuen to the wor∣shypfull and holy Catholyke and apostolycall church of Rome / by blessed Constantyne / the fyrste amonge the emperours that became Christen. IN the name of the holy and vnsepera¦ble Trinytie / yt is to wytte / the father the sonne / and the holy ghost. Caesar Flauius Constātyne / in Christ Iesu of ye same Trinitye our only sauyour oure lorde / and our god / the faythfull mylde / and benefycyall Emperour of Almayne / of Gothia / of Sarmatia / of Germanie / of Britayne / and of the Hunnes / godly / prosperous / or fortunate conquerour / and triumpher / alwayes honorable and full of maiestye: to the moste holy and blessed father of fathers / Syluester / byshoppe and Pope of the auncient and noble cyte of Rome. And to all bisshop∣pes the successours of hym / syttynge in the chayre of blessed Peter / euyn vntyll the ende of the worlde. Also to all most reuerende and deuout catholyke bys∣shoppes subiectes / by this our emperyall cōstytution to this worshipfull and holy church of Rome: Grace peace / loue / ioye / constaunt mynde / and mercy from almighty god / bothe the father / and Iesu Christ his sonne / and also the holyghost be with vs all. Suche thinges as hath ben wonderfully wrought about our owne persone / by our redemer and sauyour the lorde Iesu Christ / whiche is the sonne of the most high fa∣ther in heuyn / through his mercies / by his holy apo∣stels Peter and Paule / and throughe the meane and intercessyon of our father Syluester / the highest bis∣shoppe and catholyke or vnyuersall pope. We haue purposed and desyred to shewe in order with many∣fest narration / by this oure emperiall writte / that it may come herafter to the knowlege of all people and nations whiche are in the worlde / that the confessyon wlegīg of ye reuelation shewed vnto vs most  within / & from the very hert.  declareth outwardely
our fayth and belefe / whiche we haue learned of the a¦forsayd most blessed father and our intercessour Syl¦uester Catholyke pope chefe and highest preest / to the document and instruction of vs all. Secondarily it sheweth also to all men the large mercy of god / whi∣che he hath plētuously poured and shedde forth vpon vs. For we wyll yt all you do knowe / euyn so as we haue declared vnto you by our pragmatycall consty∣tution aforesaid / that we haue renounced and vtterly forsaken the worshyppīg of ydols / whiche are dombe and deafe and made with mannes hande / and that we are lepte away from the deuillysshe fayninges & false ymaginatyons / and from all the pompe of Sathan / and are humbly descended to the hole and parfyte pu∣re faythe of christen men / whiche is the trewe lyght and lyfe eternall / as oure hyghe and most reuerende father and maister Syluester / him selfe hath taught vs / cōmaundynge vs to beleue on god the father al∣myghty maker of heuyn and of earthe / of all creatu∣res visyble & vnuisyble / and on Iesu Christ the onely begoten sōne of him / our lorde / by whome all thīges haue ben created & made / and on the holy ghost that quickeneth and gyueth lyfe to euery creature. we do so and in suche wyse confesse and knoledge the father the sonne / and the holy ghost / as that in the perfyte Trinyte is bothe the perfeccyon of the godhed / and vnyte of power and myght. The father is god / the sonne is god / the holyghost is god / and these thre per∣sones are all one substance. Thre formes than ar ther and but onely one power. Than after that he hadde fynysshed the creatyon of the heuenly powers / & of all erthely materiall substāces: by ye mercifull power and wyll of his wysedome / he fyrst formed man of the slyme of the earth / resemblaunt to the ymage and symilytude of his owne selfe. And after he had so for¦med him / he set him in paradyse a place of pleasure / at whom and whos felycite the serpent & olde enemy the deuyll hauyng enuy / thrugh the most bytter & my∣serable tastyng of the frute of a tre forbydden / caused
hī to be outlawed & banysshed from that myrth / ioye / and pleasure. And after he hadde caused hym so to be expulsed from thence / he ceassech nat by his morty∣ferous & dedly dartes / many maner wayes to woūde other men / to thende yt he myght drawe away man∣kynde from the waye of the trouth / and perswade all men and brīg them in mynde to be seruauntes to the worshyppyng of ydoles / that is to say / of the creatu∣res and nat of the creator and maker of them / to then tent that whom so euer he shall be able by his craftye gyles to blynde / & to entangle in his snares / he maye cause them to be ponyshed with eternall payne. But god takīg mercy & tēdre pyte vpon his creature / whō his owne selfe had formed and made / sente his holye prophetes / and by them shewed and gaue knolege of the lyght of lyfe / that is to wytte / the comyng of his sonne / our lorde / and sauyour god / Iesu Christ. And last of all he sent also his onely begoten sōne the wor∣de of wysedome / whiche came downe from heuyn for our helthe and saluatyon / & was begoten of the holy ghost / and of the vyrgyn Mary. The worde of god was made man / and hath dwelled among vs / nat lea¦uyng that / which he was before / but takyng on hym to be / that that he was nat before / that is to wyrte / beyng both parfyte god / so as he was before / & par∣fyte man also / whiche he was nat before. And as god he wrought miracles and wonders / and as man / he suffred and beare the infyrmytes belongyng to the nature of man. Thus we vnderstande the worde or sonne of god to be man / and the same worde also to be god. And it is in no wyse to be douted / that ye same is both very god and very man / accordyng to the doc¦tryne and teachyng of our father Syluester. he than chosyng .xii. Apostles gaue to them the lyght of kno∣ledge / and power to worke miracles & strange thyn∣ges aboue the course of nature / that by them innume¦rable people myghte be taught and brought to belefe of the trauthe. We confesse & knowlege / that this our lorde Iesu Christe hathe fulfylled the lawes and the
prophetes / and that he suffred passyon / and was cru∣cifyed fulfyllīg the scryptures / that he dyd ryse agayn from deathe the thyrde daye / and that he ascended in∣to heuyn / and there dothe sytte on the ryght hande of the father / and that from thence he shall come to iud∣ge both quicke and dedde / whose kyngdome shall ne∣uer haue ende. Thys is our trewe and ryght belefe / shewed and tolde before to vs / by oure moost blessed father Syluester. we do therfore aduertise and coun¦sayle all people / and all maner of natyōs / to embrace and holde faste this fayth / to haue it in honour / exer∣cyse it / to teache and preche it / and in the name of the holy trinite / to come vnto the gyfte of baptisme / and with a reuerent herte and mynde to worshyppe and honour our lorde and sauyour Iesu Christ / whiche with the father and the holyghost / raygneth worldes without ende. And whome oure most blessed father Syluester Catholyke and vniuersall pope or hedde preest doth preche & teche for the very same lorde Iesu christ hauyng pite & cōpassion vpon me a synner / dyd sende his holy Apostels to vysyte vs / and hathe illu∣mynated and lyghtened vs with ye lyght of his bright¦nesse / and withdrawīg and takyng a way darknesse / hathe vouchedsafe / me to come to the knowledge of the trauth / for a great foule and abhomynable leprie was ronne ouer all the flesshe of my body / and many leches & phisyciōs resortyng vnto me / dyd theyr vtter most cure to haue heled me / but yet coude I nat by the labour or dylygence of any of them optayne remedy of my dysease / and to be made hole. ❀ Besydes this ther came to me also ye preestes of the Capitoly house sayng that a Cesterne myght be made in the capitoly house / and be fylled with the hote blode of innocētes / and that I must be bathed therin / by whiche bathīge (they sayde) I myght recouer helthe / and be clensed from that foule and horrible dysease / accordyng ther∣fore to the counsayles of them / whan many innocente younglynges and babes were sought and broughte togyther / and the wycked and cruell prestes withou
all pyte / wolde haue cutte the throtes of them / and so with the blode of them haue fylled the cestrene: oure gratyouse highnesse with tendre pytie beholdyng the lamentable wepyng and waylyng of their mothers / forthwith dyd abhorre & deedly hate that / so abhomy¦nable and cruell dede. And I than hauyng tendre cō∣passyon vpon the sayde women / cōmaunded the chyl¦dren to be delyuered agayne to the remothers / and let¦tyng them haue waggans / and suche other thynges mete for the coryage of their chyldren / and also gyuīg them giftes: sent them agayne ioyonse and gladde to their owne houses and dwellyng places. Whan this day was ended and past / and restyng tyme of the ny∣ght came on / and oportunyte prouoked me to slepe / and to take rest: sodaynly the holy Apostels Peter and Paule were harde by me / and sayd these wordes to me. Bicause thou dyddest nat suffre the preestes to performe theyr synfull purpose / but dyddest abhorre the effucyon and shedyng of innocētes blode: we are sent to the from Christ our lorde and god / to gyue the counsayle / howe / and by what meanes thou shalt re∣couer thy helth / harken therfore to our message / and do that thynge whyche we do counsayle and teche the to do. The bysshoppe of this cyte / Syluester / fleyng the persecutyons: hath hydde secretely in dennes of stones / with hys clerkes / in the mount of Soracte. This Syluester thou shalte cause to be fetched vnto the / and by his instruction thou shalt learne & knowe the trewe cesterne of Christes professyon / in the whi∣che cestrene after that thou shalt be dypped thryse: all the poyson of thy leprye shall leue the and go clere frō the / whyche thynge done: make thou agayne of thy parte / thys recompence to thy sauyour / that by thy cōmaundimentes thou do renewe all the churches in the worlde / and in this behalfe / purge and clense thou thyne owne selfe / that forsakyng all the wretchedde worshyppynge of ydoles: thou mayste loue / honour / and worshyppe onely hym / whiche alone is the ly∣uynge and the trewe God / and fulfylle his wyll
and pleasure. Than whā I was wakened out of my slepe / I dyd euyn so as I was taught of the Apostels to do / and sendyng for the heyghest & moste excellent father Syluester / Catholyke Pope / whiche hath il∣lumynated vs / & gyuen vs lyght. I declared to him all the wordes / that the holy Apostels hadde sayd to me / and what they had bydden me do / and I demaū / ded of him what goddes they were / which are called Peter and Paule. And he sayde / that they were nat properly called goddes: but he sayde / that they were Apostels of our lorde and sauyour Iesu Christ. ❧ I began than agayne to deman̄de of the same most blessed Pope / whether there were any parfyte & euy∣dent ymages of these Apostels / that by the pyctures myght knowe / if it were possyble / that they were the very same / whom we lerned them to be by reuelation Than that father worthy of all reuerēce / cōmaunded the ymages of these holy Apostels to be brought to me / by his owne propre deacon and mynister / whiche whan I behelde & {per}ceyued in the ymages very well / the aspectes and lykenesse of them / whom I had sene in my slepe / with a great loude voyce I confessed in the presence of my dukes and noble estates / that these were the very same persones / whome I sawe in my slepe. Than forthwith this our moste blessed father Syluester / bysshop of the cyte of Rome / apoynted to vs a certeyn tyme of penaūce / in which I shuld weare a sherte of heare within our palyce of Laterane / that we myght pacifye or appease the wrathe of our lorde god and our sauyour / for all thynges which hath ben wickedly wrought / and vniustly done by vs: with fa¦stynges / watchynges / wepynges / and prayers. Afterwardes / clerkes layeng their hādes vpon me / I came to the pope hym selfe / and there renouncynge the pompes of the deuyll and his workes / & all ydols made with mannes hande: I confessed of myne owne free wyll / in presence of all the people / that I beleue in one god father almightye / maker of heuyn and of erthe / of all a visyble and inuysyble thynges. And in one lorde Iesu Christ / the onely begoten son̄e of god /
our lorde / which was begotten of the holyghost / and of Mary the virgyn. Than after that he had halo∣wed the fonte or lauacre of baptyme / with his holy blessyng / he purifyed the water whiche was therin to putte. In to the which foūtayne or baptistory so sone as I was sette / I sawe with my owne eyes a hande touchynge me from heuyn / by which hande (whan I rose vp) I parceyued and knewe my selfe to be clēsed and purifyed from all the fowlnesse and vnciēnesse of leprie. And whan they had taken me out of that holy bathe / they dyd putte on me whyte garmentes. and he gaue me the carecte or marke of ye seuenfolde grace of the holy ghost / by a noyncyng me with holy oyle, & he marked the sygne & token of the holy crosse in my forhed / sayng these wordes: God sealeth or marketh the with ye seale of his fayth / in the name of the father and of the sonne / & of the holyghost / and all the clergy answered / and sayd. Amen. And the pope sayde also Pax tibi. Peace be to the. The fyrst day after that I had receyued the sacrament of holy baptysme / & that I was cured & healed in my body frō leprie. I knewe that there is none other god / besydes the father / and sonne / and holyghost / whome the most blessed father Syluester preacheth .iii. persones in one god. and one god in .iii. persones: for all the goddes of the gen¦tyles and panyms / whome I haue honoured here to fore / are manyfestly shewed and declared to be deuyls and the workes of mennes handes. Than the sayde holy father him selfe playnly declared to vs / how gre¦ate power and authoryte the same our sauyour hath gyuen to his chosen Apostell blessed Peter / bothe in heuyn and in earth / whan after that he hadde founde him faythfull in answeryng to his demaūde / he sayd to him. Thou arte Peter / and vpon this stone I wyl bylde my churche / and the gates of hell shall nat pre∣uayle agaynst it. Consyder you men of great power and myght / and attende and take good hede with the eares of your hertes and myndes / what ye good mai∣ster and lorde added more besydes this to his owne dysciple / saying. And I wyll gyue to the: the kayes
of the kyngdome of heuyn / & what so euer thou shalt bynde vpon erthe / it shalbe bounden also in heuyn. ❀This is a marueylous worde and full of power / bothe to bynde & lose so vpon erthe / yt the same shalbe bounden and losed lykewyse in heuyn. We therfore hauyng knowlege of these thynges / by thinstruction of blessed Syluester / and parceyuing or felyng par∣syte helth / to be comen agayne to our body / through the benefycence of the same blessed Peter: thought & iuged it mete and accordynge our selfe with all other dukes / erles / and our counsaylours / and the other no¦ble estat{is} / and also with the hole people beyng vnder the dominion of the empyre of Rome / that as blessed Peter appereth to haue ben constytuted / ordayned / & made by the sonne of god his deputie in erthe / so lyke wise the successours of the prince of the Apostels shul¦de take and receyue of vs and of our empire / gretter prerogatyue of power gyuen to them / than our sere∣nite and also empire is knowen of all men to haue in erthe / for we haue electe and chosyn the prince of A∣postels hym selfe / and his trewe successoures / to be patrons and intercessours for vs to god / and we ha∣ue decreed to honoure and worshyppe with reuerence his sacredde and holy churche of Rome: euyn so as our emperyall power is worshypped in erthe / & to ex¦alte the most holy see of blessed Peter / more than our owne empyre and tēporall dignyte / gyueng to it po∣wer & preferment of royaltie / strength / and effycacie and hyghe honour emperyall. And we decree & esta∣blysshe / that it haue the dominion & chefe gouernaūce vpon the foure chiefe and principall sees: Antioche / Alexandrie / Constantinople / and Ierusalem. Also vpon all the cōgregatiōs & churches of god / through out the hole worlde. and the bisshoppe of that hyghe and holy churche of Rome for the tyme beyng / to be principall and heed of all preestes whiche are in the hole worlde / and that all thynges wherof cure ought to be taken for the worshippyng of god / or the corro∣borayng and enstrengthyng of the christen fayth / be gouerned and ordered by the iugement of him / for it
is ryght that the heed of power & principalyte shulde there haue his holy lawes and ordynaunces: where oure sauyoure the maker of holy lawes / cōmaunded saynt Peter to haue the chayre of his apostelshyppe / and where Peter him selfe folowyng his maister and lorde bare his crosse drinkynge that bytter draughte of glorious dethe. ❀ There contynually and euyn to the ende of the worlde / lette them seche their maister where the holy body of their maistre resteth. There let people & natiōs of paynims bowe downe their nec¦kes for ye confession & knoleging of the name of Christ where their maister & techer the apostel Paule stret∣ching forth his necke for Christes sake / was crowned with the garlonde of martyrdome. There & in that place / lette them humbly and lowlye submytte them selues to the obsequie and seruyce of god the heuynly kynge / and sauyour Iesu Christe: where before they dyd seruyce to the proude power of an erthely kynge or gouernour. For whych causes and cōsyderations / we wyll that all people through out the worlde doo knowe that we within our palyce of Laterane / haue buylded a temple / to the honour of god our suaioure and lorde Iesu Christ: euyn frō the very foūdation with a fonte to baptyse in. And knowe you also / that we did beare out from thence vpō our owne sholders xii. baskettes full of erthe in the worshippe of the .xii. Apostels beyng .xii. also in nombre. and we haue al∣so edifyed churches in the honour of blessed Peter & Paule the chefe apostels / goodly decked & garnyshed with golde and syluer / where also we buryeng the most holy and worshypfull bodyes of them with gre∣ate reuerence haue buylded and made them shrynes of ambre / suche as neither fyre ne water can destroy. And we haue putte in through eyther of the shrynes a crosse made of most pure golde & of precyous stones / and haue fasted it with nayles of golde. And to the same churches / for the contynuaunce & mayntynaūce of lyghtes within ye same: we haue gyuē possessions and landes / and by our emperyall & heygh cōmaūde∣ment / we haue graūted to them our lyberte in the eest
and west / and in the northe and southe clymates / that is to witte / in Iurye / in Asya / Grecelande / Aphrike / Italye / and in dyuerse ylelandes / in suche maner and wyfe / that all maner thynges shall be dysposed and ordred by the handes of our moost blessed father pope Syluester and his successours. Lette all people ther∣fore reioyce with vs / we admonysshe and counsayle all kyndes of people and nations in the worlde / that they confesse and gyue infynite thankes with vs to oure sauyour Iesu Christ / for that he beynge god in heuyn aboue / and in erth vnderneth / whan he had vy¦syted vs by his holy apostles: made vs worthy to re∣ceyue the holy sacramente of baptysme / and helthe of our body / for the whiche thynges / also we gyue to the holy apostles selues & my lordes most blessed Peter & Paule / and by them to Syluester our father & hygh∣est byshoppe and catholyke pope of the cyte of Rome and to all bysshoppes his successours syttynge in the chaire of blessed Peter / euyn vnto thende of the worl¦de / and at this presente tyme do delyuer vp / fyrst the palace of Laterane our emperyall place which is the most royall and goodly palace (surmoūting all other palaces) that ar in the worlde. Next after it our dya∣deme / that is to saye / the crowne belongyng to oure heed. Lykewise we delyuer vp our phrigiū / that is to say yt which is called of the Romayns mitra. Further more oure su{per}humerall / I meane that whiche is put about our imperyall necke. Also a purple robe and a purple coote / and all the indumentes and apparayle belongynge to an emperour / and the dygnyte of the emperyall knyghtes and lordes goynge before hym / geuyng moreouer to him the emperyall sceptres / and therwith also the armes and badges / and dyuerse or∣namentes emperyall / and all the glorye and power of the most hyghe emperyall maiestie / in pompes and processyons / and to the moost reuerende men clerkes after dyuerse ordres and degrees / seruyng this wor∣shipfull and holy church of Rome. We ordaine decre / and establysshe / that they haue that attendaunce and propertye of power and preheminēce / with all the glo¦rie
& maiestie / wherwith our moste noble senatoures are sene to be adourned / that is to saye / that they be made lordes of the cytie and heed offycers. ❀ Also we publysshe and openly pronounce / that they be adour∣ned with the other dygnyties emperyall / and as the emperiall host or armye is adourned: euyn so also we haue decreed / that the clergie of the churche of Rome be decked and adourned / and lykewyse as the empe∣ryall power and maiestye is put to honoure with dy∣uerse offyces of chaūberlaynes / porters / and watche men or garde: so we wyll / that the holye churche of Rome be decked and garnysshed with ye same offices. And we decree / that the dygnytie of the pope mooste largely do shyne aboue all other / and that the prestes of the same holye church of Rome / do ryde vpon hor¦ses trapped with napkyns / and fyne whyte towels of lynen clothe / and as our senatoures do weare shoes / Cum vdonibus: that is to say / adourned with most whyte lynen clothe: euyn so we wyll them to be / that the heuenly thynges maye so be decked & garnysshed lyke the erthly thynges / to the prayse and honour of god. And aboue all / we gyue lycence to that our most holye father Syluester / bysshoppe of the cyte of Ro∣me / and pope / and to all other moost blessed popes / whiche shall in tymes herafter succede him / for the ho¦nour and glory of our lorde Iesu Christ / in this gret Catholyke or vniuersall power. if he be wyllynge to recken or accompte ony of oure circumspecte sena∣tours / amonge relygious clerkes: that none of them which are called ther vnto through pride / shall make excuse / or refuse to take this ordre. We ordayne and establysshe this also / that the father Syluester / pope worthye all maner reuerence / and all popes his suc∣cessoures / ought to weare the dyademe / that is to say the crowne / which we do gyue to him from our owne heed / made of most pure and fyne gold and preciouse stones and perles / and to weare it on their hedes to the glorie of god / for the reuerence of blessed Peter. And bycause the most blessed pope himself hath ben a shamed to were the crowne of gold vpon the crowne
of his preesthod / and on the tonsure or shauynge of his heed / whiche he hathe for the reuerence of saynte Peter: we therfore with our owne handes haue put on his moost holy heed / this phrigium / representyng and sygnifyeng the most bryght whyte coloure of it / the gloryouse resurrection of our lorde / and holding the brydle of his horse / for the reuerence of blessed Peter: we haue couered his horse. And we do or∣dayne and decree / that all his succssoures / eche one of thē after other / do weare the same phrigiū in pro∣cessyons to the ymitation & folowing of our empire / wherfore yt the high dignitie of ye pope debate nat / but that he beyng worthy / may be decorated & adourned both with glorye and power more than onye earthly kyng or gouernour.Gyueng of the palace and cyte of Rome. ❀ Beholde here we gyue vp as we haue sayde afore / our palace / & the cyte of Rome and the prouynces / places / and the cyties of all Italy and of the west regyons / to the oft rehersed our most blessed father Syluester Catholyke pope / and relea∣synge them to the power and iudgement of him and of his successours popes. We haue decreed by our diuine pragmaticall constitution / that they be dispo∣sed by the same popes / and we graunte theym to re∣mayne and contynue alwayes to the right and tytle of the holye churche of Rome / wherfore we haue iu∣ged it conuenyent and accordyng / to translate oure empire / and the glorie thereof / to the Eest regions / and buyldyng in the cytie Byzantium (whiche is a verye good place) a cytie in our owne name: there to constitute and sette our empire / thynkyng it vnmete / vnsemelye / and agaynst right / that any erthlye kyng shulde haue any power and auctoryte ther / where the chefe prelacie of preestes / and the heed of the Christen relygion / hathe ben constituted and ordayned to be / by the heuenly kyng. These thynges therfore by this our and sacred writte and other emperyall decrees determyned / and corroborated: we haue ordayned and decreed to contynue in full strengthe / and nat to be reuoked neither in the hole / neither in anye parte of them / vnto the ende of the worlde: wherfore afore

❧ The preface of Vdalrike Hutten / vpon the lytell booke made by Laurence Valla / agaynst the fayned and falsely forged donation or gyfte of Constantyne / vnto pope Leo the tenth of that name. AT the last moste blessed father / your noble & comfortable promise / whiche by your cōmaū¦dement was expressed / publysshed / & set forth at the very begynnīg / whan you were newly made po¦pe: hath vanquesshed & perfitely ouercōe the opinyon of those persones / whiche dyd disswade & frayde men away from publysshyng and sendyng forth abrode of the lytell boke made by Laurence Valla / agaynst the donation and graunt of Cōstantyne / for nowe seyng that you haue ones caused that marcyall triumphe to kepe sylence / wherwith pope Iuly the seconde prouo¦ked & styred vp men to warre & batayle / and as it wer by strykīg a cymbale of peace / haue raysed vp the her∣tes & myndes of all christen people / vnto the hoope of liberte: All men do recken & suppose / that them selues may vse all thynges / which they knowe to be laufull. And I verily of my parte / albeit that I was afore {per}∣swaded & in full belefe / if it shuld fortune & chaūce you to haue this most high auctorite & gouernaunce ouer all / for asmoch as you haue alwayes / so and in suche wyse loued & exercised the studies of best letters / that your profyting and goyng forwarde in thē / may with out dout be cōpared with the doctryne of the best ler∣ned men that be in this tyme / that you wolde nat suf∣fre any of the monumētes or workes made by aūcient authors in olde tyme to perisshe / & to be vtterly lost & cast away whiles you were pope / yet natwithstāding whan I red that inscriptyon or tytle openly set forthe in Italy. Leoni decimo pontifici maximo restaura∣tori pacis / whiche is thus moche to say in englysshe. To Leo the tenth pope / the renewer of peace: I leapte vp sodaynly / beynge wonderfully styred with a sodayne ioye / and comforted / and restored agayn to my selfe / from that passyon and vnquietnesse of my mynde / wherin I had before contynued a longe sea∣son
by the reasō yt I saw this nation dyd suffre many greuouse and shamfull thīges vnder tyrānuouse and cruell popes. I am therfore ryght ioyfull and gladde for their sakes / which are lyuing in this tyme / which by you / as it were by a most lucky starre of peace sprō¦gē vp or rysē / now after so longe darkenesse of tyrā∣ny beholdeth & loketh vp to the newe lyght of lyberte / and you are a very pope in dede / whiche do brynge peace / but your predecessours / whiche had nat this peace:Popes beīge warriers are no popes at all. Were no popes at all / for they dyd nat folowe Christ / whiche gaue peace to his discyples / and lefte the same as inherytaunce vnto them / sayeng these wordes.Io. 14. My peace I do gyue to you my peace I do leaue to you.Peace was thynheritāce which Christ gaue & left to his apostles. Popes ma∣kyng warre / ar nat the vi¦cars but the aduersarys & enemyes of Christ. The workes of Christ & of certayne po∣pes cōpared togider. And therfore also they were nat his vy∣cars / whose sted & offyce they dyd nat kepe or fulfyll / for they kyngdome of god is to kepe peace / but rather they were clene contrary & enemies to Christ / whose studies or workes they haue dispysed / and haue folo∣wed a contrary kynde or maner of lyuing / for peace belōgeth to him: and they desyred & folowed warres and batayls. He studyed to saue men by his doctryne and teachyng / and they laboured busely to kyll and destroye men / with weapons of warre. He shewed his kyngdome to be heuenly / and they fyrst of al / and most chefely sought the empiers of the worlde. Ther∣fore neither they were blessed: bycause they were nat peaceable or maynteners of peace. Neither were they the sonnes of god / for Christ sayth. Blessed are the peceable persons:Mat. v. for they shall be called the sonnes of god. ❀ Lo / thā by you most blessed father is restored and renewed the peace / which through their peruer∣syte was sayd to haue had a great fall & decaye. And this peace most chefly & in especyal learned men / haue receyued with great ioye by your benefyte and gyfte. Secondarely / they also very desyrously haue embra∣ced the same peace:The cōmody¦tees ensuyng of peace and tranquillyte. from whome many thynges had ben vniustly taken away by fraude and gyle / for with peace is come also iustice through your restoryng / for accordyng to the sayeng of the prophete / nowe chefly in this tyme.Psal. 84. Rightuousnesse and peace hath kyssed
to gyther. Faythe or fydelyte is come also / and that doughter of tyme / that is to witte / verite or trouthe:Verite is the doughter of tyme. she is come also / & the vertues belonging to kynges and gouernours / that is to witte / mercy and mekenes are come also plentuously. Do you se here / Mercy and myldnesse / ar vertues belō¦gynge to go∣uernoures & rulers. O Leo the tenth / of howe many good thynges and cōmodytes at ones / you haue ben the author and begynner? you by bringyng of peace / haue also with it brought in the studies of peace / that is to say / the studies of the best artes and sciences. you haue also restored rightu¦ousenes / for in peace are lawes / and by the lawes is iustice caused. you haue also brought agayne lyberte whom trouthe accompanyeng: hath ben her selfe also greatly profytable to the men of your tyme / for where tyranny is / there can be no peace / Tyranny ex∣cludeth al ver¦tues and cō∣modities. bycause there is no fydelyte or trustines / neither can there be any iustyce or ryghtuousnesse: for as moche as euery man hathe nat that whiche is his owne / and bycause tyrantes done oppresse the lawes. Neither it is laufull there to say the trouthe: by cause there is no lyberte. But nowe we ben very free / & at lyberte in dede: bycause we haue peace / whiche we hauyng: shall haue and vse also the studies of peace. So than / this tranqui∣lyte / which coulde nat be had in the tyme of Iulius the author of warres / we wyll nowe vse vnder you / the restorer & renewer of peace / that we may rest qui∣etly in the studie of good letters. ❀Therfore nowe let it come forth to lyght / if any thīg hath ben long tyme hidde / and let euery thinge come forthe so moche the more boldly / by how moch it is more truly & more sin¦cerely & faithfully written / of whiche sorte is this bo∣ke / whiche other popes therfore haue nat suffred: by∣cause they wolde nat here ye trouth / but you shall ther¦fore loue it / bycause you haue now afore begon to vs of ye cuppe of trouth / for what pertayneth yt to you be∣yng a pope of better cōsience / yt they sayd this boke to haue ben writtē agaynst ye dygnite of ye ecclesyasticall estat? or yt they sayd yt it did speke yuel & rayled agaīst popes / for verely neither they were popes / They were no very po∣pes / that fay¦nd the gyfte or graunt of Cōstantyne. Neither it  a ryght churche that receyued the ne graūt. whiche fayned & forged the donation of Cōstantyne / bycause they were nat pastors or herdesmen. Neither it was
a churche / whiche receyued and admytted it / bycause it was nat a congregation of faythfull christen men / for if they had ben herdesmen: they wolde haue fedde the shepe of Christ / and nat haue inuaded & deuoured them. And if it had ben a church: truly it wolde haue called people to lyfe & lyberte / & nat haue drawen vio¦lently empiers and nations vnder yoke and bōdage. For thus speketh the church. Come to me all you yt do lust & desyre after me / & be you fulfylled of my ge∣neratiōs. Certainly she fylleth (I meane the church) whomsoeuer she hath receyued / but that congregati∣on of wicked men / dyd emptie and make bare those / whom they receyued. Moreouer Christ badde his vicars.Io. the .21 The succes∣sours of Pe¦ter  to  Be good herdesmen / and nat rauenouse and gredy deuouryng woolues. For he sayde in this wise to Peter. Peter louest thou me? If thou doest Fede my shepe. He sayd. Fede my shepe / and nat de∣uour my people:Pal. . euen so as thou woldest deuour the substance of a lofe of breed. And whan he called them to the apostleshyppe: he sayd. I shall make you fys∣shers of men / that is to say / I shall make you / that by preachyng and good ensamples gyuing / you shal allure and drawe vnto the trouthe / such men as done erre & wandre from they fayth / whiche thing bycause you do folowe / most blessed father: we are gladde / and do greatly reioyce / that this ordre is retourned agayne to their offyce and dutie / through your cau∣syng & bringing it to passe / by the reason that Peace / that lybertie / that iustyce / and verite by your meanes are called and brought agayne / for what more mery voyce / or what more swete or more pleasaunt worde myght be herde than this: I meane the restoryng of peace. So than with lytell busynesse / that is to wit with one lytell worde sette forth: you haue taken a∣way the great indygnation from the myndes of men / you haue pacifyed and layd the vehement and houge passyons and vnquietnesse of mennes myndes / and haue disapoynted and put by mischeues and dystruc∣tions / and haue ceassed all wranglyng and stryfes / where than it shulde haue cōe to passe (if these cogita¦tiōs of men had happened vpon an euyll pope) that
we wolde by force and violence haue takyn awaye many thynges: nowe by you it is brought to passe / that quietly restyng / we do optayne all thīges with∣out any trouble or busynesse / do you se. O Leo / a ve∣ry pope in dede / what maner one I do iuge this your dede to be? we may nowe thanke your goodnesse for the receyte of that thing: which els was to haue ben pursued after / and purchased with warre & fyghting / wherfore nowe lette certaine persones ceasse to feare / lest you wyll be displeased and miscōtent / if this bo∣ke be publysshed and sentte abrode agayne / by cause those peruerse and prepostrouse popes / that haue ben afore you / haue forbydden that any man shulde haue it in his hande / for you are in no poynte agreynge or lyke to them: bycause they in no poynte dyd agre with Christ / for they vnder gylefull and colouraie deceite / haue drawen to themselues the seculare and worldly empiers. But you / in the syncere and pure brightnesse of trouthe / haue opened an heuenly do∣minatyon / that is to wytte / the kyngdome of peace. So than by your meane / Christyan verite begyn∣neth to reuyue and quicken agayne / which where as she hathe ben of longe tyme oppressed: nowe taketh herte and stomake agayne / and she / which hathe ben many a day in captyuite and thraldome: nowe dely∣uered and brought out agayn from that prison & der∣kenesse: deserueth to se lyght agayne / vpon trust and boldnesse wherof / Valla encoraged: dare now ryse agayne from dethe / and present hīselfe in to the eares and syght of men / and that so moche the rather also: bycause he hath ben in olde tyme / in high fauour and loue with your auncestres / of whom as you haue re∣ceyued & taken this vertue as it were by inherytaūce: euyn so lykewise in other vertues you do nat swarue or go out of kynde from them / for lykewise as in eru∣dicyon and lernyng / you do resemble that exellently lerned Politian your maister and techer: euyn so in cōdicyons & maners you a nothyng vnlyke to your great graūdfathers graūdfather Cosmus Medices. And lykewise as this was his chefe praise / yt althogh
he alone might haue done all thinges in his cyte / yet he wolde nat do al that he might / Euyn so let this be your laude / that wher as you might raigne and rule as an Emperour / you had leauer kepe and saue as a pastor or herdesman. But in Cosmus this was prin¦cipally worthy meruayle and prayse / that he beyng him selfe nat lerned / yet dyd he loue lerned men & had them in honour / causing them to besought forth and brought to him from all places on euery side / and so∣couryng them with his helpe / and also with his goo∣des. But Laurence your father / both loued learned men: and also was himself for his lerning / worthy to be accompted amonge the cheyfe lerned men of his tyme. ❀ O than this is an happie family and kynred which hathe ben ordained of god / to the helping / pro∣motyng / and fortheryng of good lernyng / for what other stocke or kinred is there / to whom els we be be¦holden / and whom ought we to thanke / as being the causers of the prosperite and cōmodites of this our time. By whose benefyte els is it: that we haue both the greke and also the laten letters reuiued & restored againe frome vtter destruction. So that in Italie onely / the Florentines are they whiche / so great a cō∣modite or benefite receyued: ought nat to repēte them or be ashamed or wery of tirauntes. No dout of it / Valla was derely beloued of your ancestres / whiles he was a lyue / therfore / for their reuerence & sakes / he is nat to be despised of you: although he be deed / where than are they / which thought it for to be feared lest you wolde nat suffre the publysshing and setting forth of this worke? as who wolde say / that you had at any time receiued and alowed in your minde / the fraude and craftie gile of them / whiche sinfully and cursedly haue imagined lyes of Constantine / or els as though this litell boke were nat such one / that nat only it may be red of all men: but also yt it ought & is necessarie & nedefull to be redde of all men / for asmoch as very great frute & profite may come of it / whiles the trouth is perfitely knowen. But some man will happely say / that it is a cōuicious & a checking boke. Trouth
it is / and therfore it is a good booke / seynge that it bytterly and sharpely rebuketh euyll men. But they wyll saye agayne / it is deuellyssh / cruell / and vncha∣rytable agaynst popes. Nay / raither agaynst tyran̄∣tes / for if in the cityes of Grecelande / it is ordayned and decreed / that they ought to haue rewardes / whi∣che haue slayne any tyraunte and ridde him out of the worlde: what rewarde than shall we gyue to them / whiche doo impugne & fyght agaynst verye tyranny it selfe: Or if it be charyte and naturall / to loue our owne countrey. Howe can it be sayde / that he dothe vncharitably and vnlouyngly / whiche hateth the ene¦mye of it. Were nat those popes the enemyes of Chri¦sten men / whyche vyolentlye plucked the ryches and goodes of all men / to their owne selues? whiche wēt about with all enforcemēt / to bryng all free men in to seruitude & bondage? and which despoyled the kīges of their empyre / & the cōmunes of their money? whi∣che did sende vnto vs from Rome / byshoppes clothed in palles or robes / with so great losse and domage of our patrimonyes or lyuelodes? Or were they the vi∣cars of Christ / whiche dyde nat fulfyll his offyce / of whō it is written. His place hath ben made in peace.psa. lxxv. Or if they be tyrantes / whiche do take vpon them selues to haue empire / dominyon / and rule ouer men that be free: Who doth this thyng more than he / whi¦che chalengeth or draweth hym in to seruytude & bon¦dage / that is the conseruer and mayntener of lyberte / that is to wyt / the prīce or emperour of ye Romayns. Therfore to cōclude / Valla speketh nat euyll agaīst popes / but he speketh the trouthe agaynst tyrauntes / and for that cause it ought to be supposed & thought that he dothe please you greatly: you (I saye) beyng a man sprongen of so noble a stocke or kyndred: of so noble auncestres / endued also with so exellent lear∣nyng / and hauynge also so honorable a name. ❀ There ought nat any lye or leasynge to be agreing vnto anye one of the stocke or kyndred of the Medi∣ces / and where so greatte learnynge is: there no peruersyte canne be receyued or haue entraunce.
And the highe and great stomake of a lyon doth nat suffre or receyue vnto it self the humilyte or vylenesse of fraude or gyle / Leo. whiche hath alwayes in his mou∣the this sentēce or sayng of the greke poete. To lye / is an vnhonest / a vyle / and a knauyshe thynge / and belongyng to villayns. The trouth: is an exellent and an honorable thyng / appertaynīg to noble & gen¦tylmen. Besydes this / if euer in any thynge Valla dyd shewe or declare what an exellent man he was / and with howe noble and stronge mynde he was en∣dued: he dothe it in this lytle boke / whiche natwith∣standyng the very great ieoperdye that he sawe sette forth a fore his eyes: (Suche was the worlde at that tyme) yet wolde he nat shrynke or god awaye frome the trouth / but boldely and styffely dyd stande by it / and in that poynte howe moche better and more lyke a Christen man dyd he / than dyd that dulle asse of la∣te tyme / whiche dedycated the priuylege of that wor∣shypfull & goodly donatyon or gyfte / to pope Iulyus the seconde / nat without the contumelye and reproche of the moost excellente learned man / & in euery poynt better than hym selfe. Affyrmynge / that him selfe had trāslate it out of ye greke / wher as we dyd nat knowe that it was wryten or made in the greke tonge / for he dyd flatter / to thentent / that he myght please one per¦sone. But Valla hath spoken the trouthe / to the ende that he myght profyte and do good to many men. What thynge lacketh he / that belongeth to the perfec¦tyon of a Christen man / and a good man. They ther¦fore doo nothyng knowe you / whiche doo feare / that this labour of Valla shalbe myslykyng and displea∣saunte to you / for yf they dyd knowe you / or youre mynde / they wolde nat esteme and iuge your lyfe / by the maners and condycions of those popes / whiche haue ben robbers of men & theues / frome whom and whose opinyon I doo greatly dyssente and disagree / bothe whan I doo here your fame and prayse openly spoken of / and spredde abrode euery where: and also whan I doo consyder this your promyse full of very good opinyon / for you do restore and renewe peace.
But there can no peace be betwene the extorsyoners or robbers / and them whiche be robbed / & haue their goodes wrongfully by violence taken from them: ex∣cepte they haue that whiche is their owne / restored to them agayne. And you / excepte you were mynded to parforme and fulfyll the dede selfe / wolde neuer haue putte forthe and set afore vs this promyse / whiche els shulde be but vayne wordes. And therfore this is myne opinyon / that you wolde haue ben greatly dis∣pleased and angry with me / if both agaynst the iuge¦ment of myne owne mynde / and also agaynst the cō∣men iugement of all men. (For who is he that is of y• opinyon or mynde) I shulde haue praysed vnto you / that vngratious & myscheuous ymagination or fay∣nyng / whiche those false popes haue vntrewly forged of Constantyne: sayeng and also facyng it out / that he hath gyuen and graunted to them thempire of the West parte of the worlde / with the cytie of Rome / the lady & regent of all people and nations / whose leude boldnesse I do marueyle at / chefely in this: that they were nat afrayde nor a shamed / to affyrme that thing whiche they knewe well / that no man wolde beleue. But they wened that they shulde easely haue perswa∣ded the germayns / and brought them in belee therof bycause the cōmen fame & noyse goeth / ye the germaīs haue no brayne nor witte / & therfore they vse no witte nor polyce or crafty conueyance in this matter / for if they had had to do with other natyons / doutles this fayning or Imaginatiōs shuld nat haue ben so colde and faynte / as it is / but a great deale more craftely hādled / and they wold haue ben more ware and wise in the deuysing of this lye / excepte there can be any man founde / whiche can shewe / that euer they vsed any such fraude or gyle agaynst any emperour / afore that the name of Empyere came to the Germayns I am therfore (oh good lorde) excedingly ashamed of our forefathers there / which haue ben so slowe & dul∣wytted / that they coulde nat parceyue or espy the de∣ceipte / which was easy to be parceyued and knowen euyn of very chyldren. But their fraude and gyle is
so moche more worthy of more hatered: by howe mo∣che after worse facyon they haue abused or simplycite mistrustyng no deceyte or crafte at all. But who can prayse and meruayle ynough at your filycyte & hap∣pynes / most blessed Leo: in whose persone it hathe chaimced this change to be made of Popes / in to the better? for the church / from hence forwarde shall ha∣ue better popes / except this your promyse be nat ma∣de with the herte / but fayned / as I am sure it is nat. And therfore those persons do iniury vnto you: who so euer do but euen so moch as doubte ones / whether you wyll suffre them that do write agaynst ye donatiō or gyfte of Constantyne / so shamfully & falsly forged and fayned / and agaīst those popes / whiche haue ben the ymagyners and deuysers of this most detestable and abhominable mischefe: all checkinge and bytter wordes / and also all sharpe and cruel dedes / are mete and conuenyent to be vsed euyn to the vttermost that maye be eyther sayd or done. Why nat? agaynst rob∣bers of princes and of the cōmunes / agaynst theues / agaynst tyrauntes / agaynst open rouers. For who is a more vyolent thefe or open robber / than is he: whi∣che so plucketh mennes goodes frome them / that he neuer taketh vp / or maketh an ende of so doīg. These were they / The excedīg abusyons of certayne po∣pes. which takīg occasyō in a very smal thinge haue gone forth past al mesure in outrage of pyllyng and polyng away of mennes goodes / whiche haue set forthe / graces to be solde / which haue sold pardons / haue solde dispensations / and a thousande maners & kyndes of bulles / nowe so longe season / whiche haue ordayned lucre and gaynes to be gotten in the remis∣syon and forgyuenes of synnes. And also haue found and gottē wynnyng and aduauntage in the punyssh∣ment & paynes of them that are deed / which also haue suffred the benfyces / which are almoste of our fore∣fathers: to be bought of themselues / whiche haue bro¦ught the Germaynes in belefe / that they are no bys∣shoppes: whiche haue nat boughte theyr palles of them / with many thousande peces of golde / whiche haue nat ben cōtente / nor thought it ynough to exacte
and require money extraordinarily euery yere ones / but also as oftentymes as it hath come ī to their myn∣de / haue sent collectours & gatherers / sondrie of them for sondrie causes. As some / bycause they were about to make redy for warre agaynst the Turkes: Other some / that they might buylde vp the churche of saynt Peter in Rome / whiche they do nat care or prouyde to be fynisshed. And albeit that they dyd all these thī∣ges afore rehersed / yet for all that / they wolde thē sel∣ues cōmunely to be saluted & called moste blessed / and most holy fathers / and did nat suffre / nat onely any thynge to be done: but also nat so moche as to be sayd or spoken agaynst their conditions and maners. But if any man had spoken any whitte / or made any men∣cion of lybertie / or if any man had cast any thynge at all agaynst them in their way to letre / or delay / and hyndre them in their extortion or rauyne and robbry: they dyd wreke their teene vpon his soule / destroyēg it and dampnyng it forthwith to the pytte of helle. Wolde you nat rekyn him / most noble Leo / to be a ve¦ry great enemy to you: if any mā dyd accompte you in the nombre of suche insatiable theues? of so cruell tyrauntes? Or do you nat thynke him to be a frende & benefyciall vnto the estates of Popes: whiche with a gret loude voyce doth laude and prayse you / for that you are nothyng agreyng or lyke vnto them? and on the other syde doth take away from them al thynges / that belonge to the succesiyon of Peter. Or wyll nat you whiche are the renewer of peace / saye well of him / and gyue him your blessyng: which curseth those authors and causers of warres and seditions? Yes moreouer I knowe you so well / that I dare be bolde to say / your selfe wyll curse them / that the sayeng of the prophet may be applyed very well & accordyngly to euery one of them. He hath loued maladiction or cursyng / & it shall come to him.Psal. 1.8 Popes nat shepherdes: but wolues nat kepers of Christes floc¦ke: but bet yers of them. He wolde no blessing and therfore it shall be sette farre of frome him. For they with cursyng did destroye the soules of men: as though mennes soules were nat a possessyon derelye beloued of god / it may therfore be concluded / yt they
were no pastors or herdesmen / because they dyd nat saue or kepe soules from perisshyng / but dyd distroy them / & dyd set forth the wepe of Christ in to daunger of the wolues / which go about the flocke of the lorde / for to deuoure it. I say they were nat shepherdes but wolues: nat kepers or watchemen / but traytours & theues / wherfore by very good ryght we may curse them: because god doth nat loue them / for as moche as thēselues had no mīde or loue to the peace of god Therfore to conclude so longe hath there ben no pope in ye church: as longe as there hath ben no peace in it. Ye moreouer so longe might men neither say wel / ney¦ther do wel: how longe these Rauenous wolues wal∣ked through goddes folde making hauocke / Psal. 119. & so long as those syngulare wyld beastes dyd wast & destroy ye vineyarde of the lorde / & those incōparable tyrauntes were lordes / & had domunō ouer al Christendom / of whom Hieremy the prophete sayth / Iere. .

And that all Italy / Fraunce / Spayne / Germanye / Englande / and all the west parte of the worlde / be∣longeth to them selues. For all these nations & coun∣treis (they say) are contayned in the instrument and writte of the donation or graunt. Are than / all these afore rehersed kyngdomes / thyne highe bysshoppe? Is it thy mynde? & arte thou purposed to recouer all these agayn? to spoyle & bereue all the kynges & prin¦ces of the west {per}te / their cyties & townes? or to cōpell them to pay yerely trybutes to the? But I do say & thynke clene cōtrary / that ye kynges may more right∣fully spoyle & depriue the of all thempire & dominion that thou hast. For as I shall declare & open / yu that graunt or gyfte / wherof the popes wyll their right & tytell to haue taken his origynall / was knowen both
to Syluester and also to Constantyne.Neither Con¦stantyne ney∣ther Syluer∣ster knewe e∣uer any thīge at such dona∣tion. But are euer I do come to the confutyng and disprouyng of the in¦strument or writte of the sayde donation (whiche is their onely defence / but bothe a false defence and a fo∣lysshe) the order requyreth that I reherce the matter somwhat farther of / and nere from the very begynnīg  And fyrst of all I wyll shewe / that Constantyne and Syluester were no suche maner men / The order of his processe in this oratiō & the deuisyon of his worke. that either the one (I meane Cōstantyne) wolde be wyllyng to gy∣ue or els might rightfully gyue / or els that it dyd lye in his owne power / to delyuer them in to the handes of any other men / or els that the other (that is to wyt Syluester) wolde be wyllyng to receyue / or els miʒt laufully receyue and take them. Secondarily I wyl  shewe / that albeit these thynges were nat so / whiche are most trewe and euydent. yet that neither Sylue∣ster dyd receyue / neither Constātyne dyd delyuer pos¦sessyon of those thynges / whiche are sayd to haue ben gyuen / but that those thynges haue alwayes cōtyne∣wed and remayned in the hādes and gouernaunce or rule of the emperours. Thirdly / that nothyng at all  was gyuen of Constantyne to Syluester / but to the pope that was nexte predecessoure to Syluester / for Constātyne was baptysed afore that Syluester was pope. And that those gyftes were but small or meane gyftes / wherwith the pope might sustayne his lyfe. Fourthly I wyll shewe / that it is falsely & vntrewly  sayd / that the copy of the donation or graunt / is ey∣ther founde in the decrees / or els that it is taken of the historie and lyfe of saint Syluester: which neither is founde in that historie / neither yet in any other histo∣rie at all. Also I wyll declare and shewe / that in the sayd writte or copy / be contayned certayne contrary and repugnant thinges / impossyble thynges / folysshe thynges / barbarous thynges / & madde tryfels / wor∣thy to be laughed at. Furthermore I wyll speake of the donation or gyft of certayne other emperours / be¦yng outher fayned / or els trifelyng / vayne / and of non effecte / wher I wyll putte to / that though Syluester had possessed these thynges / yet that nat withstādyng
either hym selfe / or els any other pope / who euer he was / beyng ones driuen out & put from the possession of thē / they can nat nowe after so great space of tyme betwene be asked or claymed agayne: neither by god¦des lawe / neither yet by the lawe of man. Last of all  I shall shewe / that of those thynges whiche the pope doth holde / there can be no prescription made by any contynuaūce of tyme / be it neuer so longe. And nowe as touchyng to the fyrst parte (and let vs speke fyrste of Cōstantyne & afterwardes of Syluester) we must take hede & beware / that we doo nat pleade the em∣perours / ye / & in a maner the comune cause / with as slendre and smal eloquence and speche: as priuate or meane mennes causes ar wonte to be pleaded / there∣fore as it were makyng an oration in the assemble & audience of Kynges and Princes (as doutles I do / for this myne oration shall come into theyr handes) it pleaseth me to speke vnto them / as if they were pre∣sente / and set in syght afore myn eyes. I call and spe∣ke vnto you Kynges and Princes (for it is harde for a priuate man which is in none offyce or auctorite to conceyue the Image of a royall and princely mynde) I serche and enquyre your mynde. I examine your conscience. I aske & requyre your testimonie, wolde any of you / if he had ben in Cōstantines roume / haue thought / The authors sheweth it to be nothyng ly¦kely that any prince beynge in his ryghte mynde wolde of him self be wyllyng to gi¦ue from him selfe so great thynges: as are fayned in the priuiledge to haue bē ge¦uen of Con∣stantyne. that himselfe ought or that it had bē mete & cōueniēt bicause of liberte to haue giuē to another mā ye cyte of Rome his own coūtrey / ye chefe & heed place of all ye world / the lady & quene of cytees / most of po∣wer & might / most noble / and most rich of people / the venquessher & triumphant conquerour of all natiōs / the which is honorable & full of maiestie / euyn in the sight and beholdyng of it. And to gete hym selfe to a vyle and poore towne afterwardes / that is to witte to Bizantium. ye / moreouer that he shulde with the cyte of Rome / gyue Italy also / whiche is nat a pro∣uince: but the heed of prouinces / sholde gyue from him selfe the .iii. partes of Frauner / the .ii. Spay∣nes / shulde gyue Germanye / shulde gyue Englande / and all the hole weste parte of the worlde / and shulde
depriue himselfe of one of the .ii. eyes of the empier. No man can bringe me in mynde to beleue / that any man wolde do this / whiche were in his right mynde. For what thinge dothe god gyue you more desyred and longed for?Of all thīges princes desire most to enlar¦ge their domi¦nion & empire and the cōtra¦ry they moste hate. What thyng is more plesaunt? What is more acceptable and better welcome / than to en∣large and encreace your kingdome and empiers? and very greatly to amplyfie and setforthe your dition and dominion both in length and bredthe / about this thynge (as me thinke I perceyue right well) all your care / all your cogitation and thoughte / and all your labour & trauayle / is spente and bestowed bothe day and night. Herof do you principally and chefly hope to haue glory / for this thīg you do forsake pleasures / for this you do putte youre selues in a thousande pe∣rylles and ieoperdes. for this you ar contente to lose your most derely beloued childrē. ye for this / you do nat grudge to lose {per}re of your owne bodis / for I ne∣uer herde or redde / that any of you hath ben feared a∣way from the endeuourment and goyng about to am¦plyfie and enlarge his empier: bycause he had loste either an eye / a hande / or a legge / or els any other membre or parte of his body. But this hote and fer∣uent desyre of hauing great and large dominion / as euery man is moste of might and power: so it moste troubleth and vexeth or chafeth his mynde.The insacia∣ble ambicyon of great Alex¦ander. Alexandre nat content to haue walked on fote through the deser¦tes and wildernesses of Affrike / and that he had con∣quered the Eest parte of the worlde / euyn vnto the formast parte of the Occian see.Rede Plutar¦che in the lyfe of Alexander and that he had sub∣dued the Northe parte: in the myddes of so many woundes / and of so many mischaunces / whan his soudiers refused and forsoke so farre / so sharpe / and paynfull vyages and iornayes: yet he thoughte all that euer he had done before / was nothyng at all: ex∣cept he had also made the West parte / and all nations tributary to himselfe / either by force and violence / or elles by the auctorite of his name. yt is but a small thinge / wherof I do yet speke. He had purposed moreouer to passe ouer the Occian see / and to serche
whether there were any other worlde / & to subdue it to his power / ye / & at the last (as I suppose) he wold haue entreprised & attempted to clyme vp into heuen Suche for the most parte is the wyll / desyre / and ap¦petyte of all kynges and princes: all be it they haue nat all lyke corage and boldnesse. I wyll nat here reherce / how great synnes / and howe many abhomi∣nable thinges haue ben cōmitted and done / either for the winnyng & gettyng of empier & dominion: or els for the amplyfiyng & enlargyng of the same / in so mo¦che that the one brother hath nat holden his handes from the murdryng & kyllyng of the other / neither the chyldren haue refrayned from the wycked effusion of theyr fathers blode / neither the fathers haue refray∣ned from the kyllyng of theyr owne sonnes: So that the temerite & folysshe lewde boldnes of man / is wōte in nothyng to rage more / or to vse more cruelty / & to cōmytte more haynouse offences or synnes: than he∣re in this thynge. ye / & which a man may more mar∣uayle at / you may see the myndes of olde men herein no lesse quycke & full of courage: than be the myndes of yonge men / & of them that be chyldles: no lesse than of those that be fathers / & haue chyldren / & of Kynges & Princes: no lesse than of tyrauntes. Now if domi∣nion than or empire is wonte with so gret enforcemēt to be desyred & sought for: with how moche more in∣forcement & busines must it nedes be kepte & mentey∣ned? Neither is it so miserable & wretched a thinge / nat to amplyfie & enlarge the ēpier / as it is to minissh it & to make it lesse. Neither is it so shamfull a thīge for the / not to ioyne or put another māns realme vn∣to thyne: as it is that thyne shulde be ioyned to ye em¦pier of an other man / for where we do rede / that cer∣tayne Kynges or certayn people / haue made some mē gouernours of theyr kyngdome or of theyr Cytyes: that was done so / not of the chefest or principall / nor of the greattest parte of the empyer: but in a maner of the hynmoste or worste / & the lest parte therof / & that vnder suche maner & cōdityon / that he to whom suche gouernaunce & rule was gyuen: shulde alwayes ac∣knowlege
the gyuer to be as lorde / and hīself to be as a minister & seruaūte vnder him. I be seche you than do nat they seme to be of an abiecte / vyle / & cowardly mynde / and nothyng of gentle & high or couragiouse stomake: which do thīke & suppose / that Cōstantine dyd alyenate & gyue from himselfe the better parte of the empier. I do nat meane Rome & Italy / & other: but the thre Fraunces / where he had made warres & batayles / where he alone had of longe season ruled and had dominion / Mani cōside¦rations / why Constantyne wolde nat gy¦ue from hym the best parte of the Empi∣re. where he had sette the rudimen∣tes and fyrst foundation of his Empyre and of hys glorte: seynge also that he was a man / whiche for the desire to haue dominion / had made warre vpon nations / and whiche persecuting his owne frendes / and men of his alyaunce with ciuyll warre: had de∣priued them of their empier / and which also had nat yet perfytly ouercome & subdued those that were lefte and remayned of the contrary facyon & parte / whych also nat only was wonte for hope of glorie & renowne to make warre with many nations: but also was of necessyte cōpelled to do so / bycause he was prouoked ther vnto dayly of the Barbarians / which moreouer had abūdance & plentie of chyldren / of kynsefolke / & also of frendes / which knew also right well / that the senatours & the people of Rome / wolde repugne and stryue agaynst his dede / whiche besydes all this had proued & founde by experience the instabilite of ye na∣tions venquesshed & subdued / which welnere at eue∣ry change of the emperour or gouernoure of the Ro∣maynes: were wonte to ryse & rebelle / whiche therto dyd remembre himselfe / after the maner & custome of other emperours nat to haue come to that dominion and empier / by the election of the senatours / and con¦sent of the people or communes / but to haue gotten and wonne it with an army of men / with the swerde with warre and batayle. What so great and stronge cause? what so vrgent and necessarie thinge was there / why he shuld (all these thynges nothynge re∣garded / but vtterly despised and sette at nought) be willyng to vse so excedyng great lybertie. They say /
bycause he was made a christen man. What? shulde he therfore depriue himselfe of the beste parte of the empire. ye / I wysse / I suppose it was synne / ye and that great sine and wicked abhomination / to raigne than any longer / and that to be an emperour and go∣uernour of realmes: coulde nat be ioyned or stande togyther with the Christen relygion. Those that be in auoutry / those that haue made themselues riche by vsury / those which vniustly do possesse other mēs goo¦des: after that they haue receyued baptisme / are won¦te to restore the wyfe / to restore the money / and to re∣store the goodes / whiche they had of other mennes. yf you haue this cogitations or thought with you / O Cōstantine: you ought to restore to cyties their ly¦bertie / and nat to chaunge the lorde / making theym where afore they were bounde to you: nowe bounde to another. But some man wyll say / this was nat the cause / but that you were moued to do this thinge / onely for the honour of relygion and holynesse or de∣uotion / as who wolde saye / that it were a more holy and deuoute thing to lay from you your empire: thā to administre and gouerne it for the defēce and mayn¦tenaunce of faith and relygion. For as touchinge to the receyuers of it: this your donation or gyfte / shal neither be worshipfull or honest: neither yet profy∣table vnto them. But if you wyll shewe your selfe a Christen man / if you wyll shewe tokens of your holy¦nesse and deuotion / if you wyll do good / and prouy∣de / I do nat saye for the churche of Rome / but for the churche of god: now specyally and principally play the prince and gouernour / that you may fyght for thē which neither maye / neither ought to fyght for them selfe / that you may by your auctorite make thē safe & sure from ieoperdy: which ar in daunger of traynes and iniuries. It hathe pleased almighty god in ty∣mes past / to open and shewe to Nabugodonosor / to Cyrus / to Assuerus / and to many other kynges and princes: the highe ministerie of the trouthe. yet for all that / he neuer required of any of them: that he shulde renounce and forsake his empier / that he shuld
gyue awaye parte of his kyngdome: but onely that he shulde restore lybertie to the Hebrues / and defende them frome the iniuries and noyaunce of their ene∣myes / that bordred vpon them. This was suffycient to the Iewes: this same also shall be suffyciente to Christen men. Constantine you are now made chri∣sten. But is it nat a shamfull thinge / that you beyng nowe a Christen emperour / are a smaler prince in do¦minion and empier: than you were beyng yet an In∣fydele?All power & auctorite is the gyfte of god. For to be a prince or gouernour: is a certayn principall and chefe gyfte of god / whervnto euyn the hethen princes also are iudged to be called & chosen of god. But happely some mā shall say / that Cōstātyne was eased & delyuered frō his lepry / & therfore it is ve¦ry lyke to be true / that he wolde make recompence / & paye home agayne with gretter measure: yt whiche he had receyued / Is it so in dede? Naaman yt noble mā of Syria / Rede the .v. chapit of the iiii. bokes of Kynges. whan he was cured & healed of his lepry by the prophete Helizeus / was wyllyng & content onely to offre gyftes & presentes to him: but nat to gyue the one half of his substaunce & goodes / & wolde Cōstan∣tine offre the one halfe of his ēpier? It greueth me to make answere to this shamfull lyeng tale: as it were to an historie / of certaynte and vndouted trouth. For this lyeng fable is forged & coūterfaited to ye lykenes of the historie of Naaman & Helyzeus: as that other tale of the dragō in the lyfe of Siluester / is imagined to the lykenes of that fable of the dragō of Bell. But though I do graunt these thīges to be true:Dan̄. 14.  the .xiiii chapit of the prophete Da¦niel: how he slewe the dra¦gon (whiche the people of lon dyd worshippe) without swer¦de or tafe. is there any mētion made of the donation in this historie? no verely nat one worde. But of this we shall speke bet¦ter & in more cōueniēt & mete place here after. well / I graunt he was delyuered from the lepry / he toke ther∣fore a Christen minde to him / he was endued with the feare of god / with the loue of god / he was desirous & wyllyng to do him honour & worshyppe / what of all this? yet cā nat I for al that be {per}swaded & brought in mīde to beleue that he wold be willing to gyue away from hīselfe so great thīges / for as moth as I do see no man / niether Gētyle / for ye honour of his false god∣des / neither Christen mā / for the honore of ye lyuing
god: that hath forsaken & layde from hīselfe his ēpier / & gyuē it to preestes. For none of ye kinges of Israel coulde be brought in the mīde / 3. Regū 12 Exāple here∣of you may fī¦de / of Hiero∣boam in the third boke of Kynges / & xii. chapit / som∣what nere to the ēde of the same chapit. that he wold sure the people to go aft ye maner vsed aforetyme / to ye tēple of Ierusalē / for to make sacrifice / & al because they fered & dreded / leste the people being put in remēbraūce / by that holy exercyse of religion / & by the maiestie of the tēple: hapely might returne agayn to the kyng of Iu¦da frō whō they had fled & gone away. But how mo∣che gretter a thyng is this: which Constātine is said to haue done / & be cause you shall nat flatter & begyle your self / by the reason of this healyng from lepre / thynkyng this a sufficient cause / wherfore Constātin shulde make that graūte. Hieroboam was the fyrste / that was chosen of god / to be kynge of Israell / & that truly frō most vile & lowe cōdition or estate / 3. Regū 12 Rede in the third boke of Kynges the xii. cha. which in my iudgement / is a more great thyng than it is to be holpen & cured frō lepry / & yet for all that he durst nat betake or delyuer vp his kingdome to god / wilt thou yt Cōstātine did gyue his kingdom & Empere to god which he had nat receyued of god? namely seyng yt in so doyng / he shulde offēde & greue his owne children (which thing could nat haue chaūced to Hieroboam) Shulde cast downe his frēdes / shulde despise those yt belonged to him / shulde hurte his coūtrey / shuld put all men to heuines & sorowe / & be him selfe as it were tourned into a newe man? at ye lest wise doutles there shulde nat haue lacked some / which wolde haue admi¦nistred him / & put hī in remēbraūce / & in especiall his chyldren / his kynsfolke / & his frēdes / whom who is he which wold nat thynke that they wolde forthwith haue gone to the Emperour? Ymagyn therfore them afore your eyes / after they haue herde Constantines mynde: tremblynge and full of feare / makyng haste and with sorowfull syghes & teares fallyng down at the knees of theyr prince / and vsynge these wordes & oratyon / so as here foloweth vnto him. ¶The oratyon of Constantines sonnes / and of his kynsfolke and frendes / made vnto him full of lamen∣table complaynte / for that he gothe about without /
ye / and contrary to their deseruynge so to take frome them their inheritaunce. &c. FAther / whiche haue ben heretofore the most lo∣uyng and naturall father / that might be in the worlde vnto your children: Do you in this wise now depriue? disherite / and put vs your owne sonnes frō youre lyuelyhode and possessyons / euyn in youre lyfe tyme / and as it were refuse vs and forsake vs for your children. For that you ar willyng and mynded to gy∣ue frome yourselfe the best and the greattest parte of the empyer. we doo nat so greatly complayne therof / as we do meruayle therat. But we do complayne / that you do offre it to other men / with our bothe losse and also shame and rebuke. For what cause is there / wherfore you do defraude your chyldren / and do ke∣pe from them the successyon or inheritaunce of the em¦pier / that they wayted & loked after: which haue your selfe raigned to gyther with your father. What haue we offended or trespased agaynste you? or what vn∣kyndnes or vnlouīg behauiour haue we vsed toward you? or what agaynst our countrey? what agaynst the name of the Romaynes / and the maiestie of the empier? for whiche we seme to you worthy to be de∣priued by you and put frome the princypall and beest parte of the empier / and to be banisshed frome oure fathers house / from the syght of our natyue countrey from the ayre that we haue ben wonted vnto / and frō the auncient and olde custome. Shal we now being banisshed men / forsake our owne houses / the temples and the sepulcres of our forfathers / kynsfolke / & fren¦des: knowyng nat where or in what regiō of ye worl∣de we shal become?The kyns∣folke & frē∣des. what? we that ar your kynsfolke what? we that are your frendes whiche haue so often tymes stande with you in fyght & batayle / which ha∣ue sene our brethrē / our fathers / our sonnes strickyn in / and thruste through afore our face with the wea∣pons of our enemies / & beatyng & tremblyng vpon ye grounde / and haue nat bene afrayde with the deth of other men / but haue bene redye also ourselues to dye for your sake in your cause: are we all together now
now thus forsaken of you? we which do beare heed of fyces in Rome / & we whiche now haue the rule & go∣uernaūce / or in tyme to come shulde be rulers & gouer¦nours in the Cyties of Italy / in the .iii. {per}tes of Fraū¦ce / in the .ii. partes of Spayne / & in other prouinces: are we all reuoked or called backe agayn? & are we al cōmaunded to be priuate persones without office / dy∣gnite / or auctorite? will you recompence vs this gret losse another way / how can you be able to do it accor∣dyng to our deseruynge / & accordinge to our worthy∣nes and dygnyte: whan you shall haue gyuen ones from you so great a parte of the worlde vnto another man / he that before was ruler & gouernour ouer an C Nations / wyll you / O Cesar make him gouernour & ruler ouer one nation / how fortuneth it that euer this thing could come into your mynde? how cometh it to passe yt you haue thus sodenly forgottē all yours: that neither you haue any whit pite of your frēdes. neither of your nere kynsmē / no / neither yet of yor own sōnes / wold god / O Ceser (so yt your dignite & victory we∣re saued) that it had ben our fortune & chaūce to haue ben slayne in baytayle: rather thā that we shuld euer se these thynges: & verely as touchyng your empyre / you may do with it accordyng to your own lust & plea¦sure / & so may you also with vs / onely one thinge ex∣cepted / in which we wyll cōtinually be disobediēt euē vnto deth / that is / that we wyl nat in any wise ceasse frō the honorīg of ye ydols / to the greate ensample also of other men / that you may know how lytell good or profyte your larges & lyberalyte shal do to the Chri∣sten relygiō. For if you do nat gyue ye empier to Sil¦uester: we are willyng & content to be come Christen with you / and many men shall take ensample of our dede / to do lykewise. But if you do gyue it to him: nat onely we can nat fynde in oure hertes to be made christē mē: but also you shal make this name of Christ hatful / detestable / cursed / & abhominable to vs / & you shal make vs in suche case / yt at the last you wil haue pyte both of our lyfe & also of our dethe / and do nat accuse vs of harde hertes and stubburnes: but ac∣cuse
your owne selfe. Wolde nat Cōstantine (thinke you) if he were nat meued by his own accorde and of his owne mynde & free wyll: at the leastwise haue ben meued and styrred with this oration / except we wyll that all humanyte was plucked out from his breest by the harde rotes. What if he wolde nat haue harde these men / nor regarded their oration or spech / were ther nat be sydes these / some which wold haue repug¦ned & be agaīst this his dede / both with their wordes and also with their hande & power. wolde the sena∣tours and the people of Rome haue supposed: that thēselues ought to do nothīg in this so gret & weghty a mater / wolde nat they haue called to thē an oratour (as Virgile saith) beīge a man of grauyte & auctorite for his loue & benefytes towardes his countre:Enedos. 1 which shulde make this oration to Cōstantine. ¶ The oration of ye senatours & the people of Rome made to Cōstātine / in which they nat only do shewe that Constantine hath no right nor auctorite to gyue the ēpier from him: but also that they wyll in no wise suffre it to be done / & that for many cōsyderatiōs / but raither flee both the receyuer / & him also the gyuer. MOst noble Cesar / if you haue no mynde or re∣membraūce neither of those that be nere to you neither of your selfe / so that ye wyl neither their inhe¦ritaunce to remaine hole to your sonnes / neither their riches & substaūce to your kynsfolke / neither their ho¦nours to your frēdes. neither ye empyre to your owne selfe: yet for all that / the senatours & the people of Ro¦me can nat forget / or be vnmyndeful of their ryght & of their dignite / for how do you take vpon you so mo¦che power / as to do this of the empyre of Rome: whi¦ch was neuer wonne or gottē with the effusyō of your blode / but of ours. wil you cut & deuide one body into ii. {per}tes / & wyl you of one kīgdome make two / two hee¦des & to wylles. And wyll you as it were / offre swer∣des vnto two bretherne / whiche maye stryue & fyght togider for the inheritaunce. We do gyue to such cy∣ties
as haue ben frendly / & haue done good vnto this cyte of Rome: we do gyue to thē the lybertes of this cytie / that they may be citezins of Rome. And do you take away from vs the one halfe of the empire / that it shall nat aknowlege this cytie the parent & mother of it. ❀ In the hyues of bees / if there be bredde two kynges or maister bees / we do kyll the tone / A symilytude taken of bees whiche is the worst of them two. And do you suppose or thin¦ke it mete / in the hyue of the Romayne empire / wher you are the onely and the best gouernoure / another heed and gouernour to be sette and placed / & that the very worst and nat a profytable bee / but and vnprofita¦ble drane.Of the diuy∣syon of them¦pire ī twayne shal ensue ma¦ny incōueniē∣ces / & finally the decay of it In this thyng / we do greatly require wis¦dome in you most noble emperour / for what shal hap¦pen or come to passe by ye reason herof / if either in the tyme of your lyfe / or els after your decease. Barba∣rous nations shall make warre / either agaynst this parte of the empire / whiche you do alyenate and gy¦ue from you / or els agaynst the other parte / whiche you do reserue and kepe styll to your self. With what strength of souldiers / or with what hostes or armies shall we than resyst them? We can scantly withstāde them nowe with the might and power of the hole em¦pire: and shall we than be able to resyst thē? Shall these two membres or partes of thempire be alwayes at vnyte and cōcorde togider / the one with the other? As we suppose this is nat possyble / for as moche as Rome wyll rule and be maistresse / and the other {per}te will nat be seruaūte and obey. ye / moreouer euen you beyng yet a lyue / within shorte tyme the olde garny∣son reuoked & newe put in their stede / and you beyng gone in to your kyngdome / & lyuing ferre hens / and another man gouernynge & rulynge here: Shall nat all thynges than be chaūged & newe / that is to say / dy¦uers & cōtrary? Cōmenly whan a kyngdome is deuy¦ded betwene two bretherne / forthwith the myndes of the people and commens are deuyded / and they be∣gynne to make warre a monge theym selues / afore that they make warre agaynste their ennemyes of out natyons. ❀ Who dothe nat see / that the same
thinge shall happen lykewise in this empier. Do you nat knowe / that in olde tyme this was the principall cause to the nobles and great estates / why they sayd / that they wolde rather dye in the syght of ye people of Rome / than they wold suffre that lawe or statute to be made and to go forthe / that parte of the senatours and parte of the cōmen people / shulde be sente to inha¦bite the cyte called Veii. in Ethruria / and that .ii. cy¦ties shulde be cōmune to the people of Rome. Forse∣yng there was so moch dissētion in one cyte of Rome: Howe moche more than shulde there be in two cyties. So lykewise in this tyme / if there be so moche dis∣corde / debate and strife now in one empier: (wherof I reporte me to your owne conscience / and to the la∣bours and trauayle whiche you haue taken) what dis¦corde shal there be in two empiers. Go to / moreouer do you suppose or wene that you shall haue anye men from hence: which either shal be wyllyng / or els shall haue cōnyng & knowledge how to helpe you or ayde you / whan you shall be occupied & busyed with war∣res? They whiche shalbe made captaynes ouer the soldyers and rulers or gouernours of Cyties / shal be as vnacquaynted with all feates of cheualry / & haue their mīdes as ferre set away from warre & baytayle: as he that maketh them captaynes and rulers. what? Shall nat either the Legions of Rome / or elles the very prouinces selues / attempte and take in hande to spoyle this gouernour / beyng so vnskylled of doyng the offyce of a prince & gouernour / & so easy to suffre and take wronge: bycause they shall hope that either he shall make no resistence: or els shall nat reuenge him selfe / nor do any punisshement to them. In good fayth I beleue they shall nat contynue in doyng their duety / nat so moche as one moneth space / but yt they wyl rebelle forthwith / & euyn at the very begynnyng of your departyng from hence. what wyl you thā do? what counsayll wyll you than take: whan you shal be pursued and kepte in with double / ye / more ouer with manyfolde warre and batayle / we can scarsely rule & kepe in good ordre the Nations which we haue con∣quered
& subdued. How shal we be able than to resyst thē: whan we shal besydes thē haue warre with other nations also / whiche are fre and vnsubdued. Cesar concerning suche thinges as belonge to your owne selfe / aduise you what you lyst to do. But this mat∣ter ought to be no lesse cared for of vs: than of you / your selfe are mortall: but the empier of the people of Rome ought to be immortall / and so shall it be as mo¦che as shall lye in our power. ye / and nat onely the empier: but also the honestie and shamfastnes of the same people. Shall we so in dede? shall we receyue them to our gouernours and rulers: whose relygion and secte we do despise? and we that be princes and rulers of the worlde: shall we become seruauntes and subiectes to this most vile and wretched man? Whan the cyte of Rome was taken and wonne by the Fren∣che men: the olde auncyent father of Rome could nat suffre / that their conquerours shulde stroke their ber¦de / or drawe it through their handes. And shall now so many men of the senatorie ordre / So many of the pretorie ordre / So many of the order and degree of Trybunes / So many men that haue ben Consules and which haue victoriously tryumphed / suffre them to be rulers and lordes ouer them: to whom them sel¦ues haue done all maner contumely rebuke & punissh¦ment / as it were to lewde or euyll bondmen. Shall these men make heedoffycers? shal they gouerne the prouinces? shall they make batayles & warres? shall they gyue sentence of lyfe and dethe vpon vs? Sall the nobilyte of Rome / warre and take wages vnder them? shall they hope or wayte for honoures? or shall they gette offyces and rewardes vnder them? what more greate or more depely persyng wounde may we receyue or take: than this? Thinke nat / O Cesar / that the blode of the Romaynes is so chaunged and gone out of kynde / that they wyll suffre this with a pacient and quiet mynde. and nat thinke it to be by all maner meanes eschewed and auoyded / whiche in good fayth / nat the very women could suffre or abyde but raither wolde brenne themselues togyther with
their swete chyldren and their howses / with the wor∣shipfull goddes of the same. So that the women of Carthage haue nat ben more bolde and stronge her∣ted / than the women of Rome wolde be / For Cesar / if we had chosen and made you a kynge: verely you shulde haue great power and lybertie / to do with the empier of Rome what you pleased / but yet nat so: that you might minisshe / but euen the leaste poynt of the maiestie therof. For els we that hadde made you king / by the same power we wolde bydde you laye your kyngdome from you / and wolde depose you / nat onely you coulde nat be suffred to deuide or parte the kyngdome / nat onely you could nat alyenate and gyue from you so many prouīces / nat only you could nat be suffred to gyue the very heed and principall parte of the kyngdome vtterly and for euer to an Ali∣an and most vile man. we haue made a dogge ouer∣seer and kepar of the folde of shepe / whiche if he had leuer playe the wolfe / than do his owne offyce and du¦tie: either we wyll dryue him out / or els we wyll kill him. Now seyng that you haue so longe tyme vsed the offyce of a dogge / in defendyng the folde of the Romayns: wyl you now at the last ende be tourned in to a wolfe / so as neuer was any afore you. And we let you well to wytte (for as moche as you do compelle vs / to speake somwhat sharpely for our righte) you haue no power / right / nor tytle in the empeir of the people of Rome. Iulyus Cesar wanne thempier and gatte it by force and vyolence. Augustus also gatte it by vyolence / and by ouercōming and vanquesshyng of the aduersarie partes / made himselfe lorde and go¦uernoure. Tiberius / Caius / Claudius / Nero / Galla Othouitellus / Vespasiane / and other / either by the same / or elles by lyke waye / haue spoyled and robbed vs of our lybertie. you also your selfe / by expellyng and driuyng out other / or els by kyllyng and sleyng of other: haue bene made lorde and Emperour. we passeouer here / that you are nat borne of matrimony wherefore / Cesar (to gyue you playne knowledge of our mynde) if you lyst nat your selfe to be heed gouer¦nour
of Rome: you haue sonnes. Make one of them accordyng to the lawe of nature / gouernour in your stede / which thyng we wyll both suffre you / and also desyer you to do. if you wyll nat: we are mynded and purposed to defende bothe the publyke maiestie / and the priuate dignyte. For this is no lesse iniurye to the Cytezens of Rome: than was in olde tyme the defoylyng of Lucrecia / neyther we shall lacke one / whiche shall be captayne to this people for the recoue¦ryng of theyr lybertye: lykewise as Brute was cap∣tayne to them agaynst Tarquine / and fyrst we shall drawe out our swerdes agaynst them / whom you do make rulers ouer vs: and than afterwardes agaynst you also / which thynge we haue done agaynst many Emperours / & that truly for lyghter and smaller ma∣ter than this. These wordes doutles wolde greatly haue moued & stirred Cōstantyne: excepte we do iu∣ge him to haue ben a stone or a stocke / which wordes although the people had nat spoken to his face: yet it was credyble & lykely / that they spake them amonge theyr selues / and euerywhere dyd grudge / & shewe them selues miscontente / with suche maner wordes. Let vs than now go and say / that Constantyne was wyllyng to do Syluester pleasure / whom he dyd bri¦ge in daunger of so many mennes hatered / and of so many mēnes swerdes: that (as farre as I do thynke or iudge) Siluester shulde scasely haue lyued ye spa∣ce of one day / for if he / and a fewe mo had ben rydde out of the way: all suspition of so cruell iniury / and despite or contumely semeth to be clene taken away & rydde out from the hertes & myndes of the Romains Go to now: moreouer / let vs graunt / if we thynke it possyble: that neyther intreatyng and prayers / ney∣ther manacyng or threttes / neyther any other way or meane coulde any thyng auayle / and that Constātine doth styll contynue stedfastly in his purpose / neither wyll in any wyse leue or forsake / or go from the opi∣nion / whiche he hathe ones taken: who wyll nat yet agre herevnto / that he wolde haue ben moued & styr∣red at the wordes and oration of Siluester? whiche
doutles wolde haue ben after suche maner as here fo∣loweth: if this hadde ben a true thing doone matter in dede. ¶ The oration of Siluester to Cōstantine / in whi¦che he sheweth it to be neither laufull / neither profy∣table for him / to receyue Constātines offre / although it were so as it is nat / that Constantine might right¦fully / & without any impediment or offending of any persone / giue suche thinges as he offred from himself and his children. MOst noble and best disposed prince / and sonne Cesar: I can nat verely but greatly loue and embrace this your so redy and lyberall deuotion / and godly mynde / but yet that you do somedele erre and mistake / and are deceyued in your opynyon aboute the offryng of gyftes / and makyng of sacrifice to god I do nothyng meruayle / for as moche as you ar yet but a nouye and a yong soldyer in the Christen rely∣gion / Rede the .xxii chapit of Le∣uitici. and Christen warre / as in the old tyme it was nat semely nor conuenyent / euery maner beest / whe∣ther it were wylde or tame / nor euery maner shepe to be offred vp in sacrifice by the preest: so nat euery ma¦ner gyfte or oblation is to be receyued and takē of the preest. I am a preest / & a bysshoppe / whiche ought to consyder and loke well aboute / what thynge I do suffre to be offred vp at the aultre. Lest parauenture I do nat say / any vnclene beaste: but lest a vipere or a serpent be offred vp there. Therfore this you shall vnderstande / If it lay in your power & lybertye to gyue parte of the Empire and of the Cyty of Rome / the lady & Empresse of the worlde / to any other man than to your owne chyldren (whiche thynge I do nat suppose or thynke) and if this people of Rome / If Italy / If the other nations coulde suffre / and fynde in theyr hertes to be subiectes vnder the dominion & gouernaunce of them / whom they do hate / and who∣se relygiō and sette they do refuse and forsake / beyng delyted and blynded with the plesaunte entisementes
of the world (whiche thinge is vnpossyble) yet if you thinke most loued sonne / that I am any white to be beloued: I can by no meane be perswaded & brought in the mynde / to assent and agree vnto you / excepte I wolde be vnlyke my selfe / and forget my condition and estate / and in a maner renounce and forsake my lorde Iesu. For your gyftes / or (as you wyll haue them called) your remunerations or recōpensations shulde pollute / stayne / or defoyle: ye / and also vtter∣ly destroye the glorie / the innocentie / and the holy ly¦uyng bothe of me: and also of all that shall succede me / and also shulde stoppe & close vp the way to them whiche shall be wyllyng to come to the knowledge of the trouth. Helizeus wolde nat take any reward of Naaman that noble man of Syria:4. Reg. . Rede the iiii. boke of kyn∣ges the .v cha¦pit whome he had cured and heled from lepry. And shall I receyue reward of you: bycause you are cured of the same disease. He forsoke and refused gyftes. And shall I suffre hole realmes and kyngdomes to be gyuen to me. He wolde nat spotte or defyle the personne of a prophete / and shall I fynde in my herte / to defyle the persone of Christ / whiche I do represent and beare in me. But why dyd he thinke the persone of a pro∣phete to be defyled by taking of giftes? verely bycau¦se he might haue semed thā to selle holy thinges / & to lende forth the gyfte of god / for to haue increace and auauntage therby / and to nede the worldly socoure and aydes of them / and to minisshe and appayre the dignyte of his benefyte. He had leuer therfore make princes and kynges beholding to him / for his bene∣fytes don to them: than him self to be bounde to them for any benefyte receyued of them. ye / moreouer he wolde nat so moche. as take any recompence agayne for his benefytes. For it is a moche more blessed thinge (as the lorde sayth) to gyue:Actes. 20. than to take and receyue. The same cause haue I: that Helizeus had ye / and a moche greatter cause / whiche am cōmaun∣ded also of the lorde / that sayd.Math. 10 Heale you those that be sycke / rayse vp those that be deed / clense them that be full of lepry / cast you out deuyls & wicked spirites
you haue receyued frely: gyue you also frely. Shal I Cesar cōmytte so great offence / as nat to obey and execute the cōmaūdemētes of god / and to pollute and distaine my glorie. It is better (as sayd Paule) that I dye: than that any man shulde bereue me my glory Our glory is to make honorable our ministeri afore god / 1. Cor̄. 9. as the same Paul sayth. I say to you Gentyles / As long as I am the apostle of the Gentiles: I wyll glorify my ministerie. Shulde I than / O Cesar / be bothe an ensample / and also a cause to other men for to offende and synne: I whiche am a Christen man / the preest of god / the bisshoppe of Rome / and the vi∣care of Christ. Moreouer / howe shall preestes saue their innocencie of lyuing amonge riches? amonge gret offyces & dignites? amonge the administration of seculare and worldly busynesses. Do we therfore renounce and forsake erthly thinges: that we myght gette the same thinges more plentuously. And haue we therfore cast away our owne priuate goodes: that we might possesse other mennes goodes / and the com¦mune goodes. Cyties shall be ours / Trybutes shall be ours / Rentes / tolles / and customes / shall be ours. And why shall it be lauful for vs to be called Clereci / that is to saye Clerkes: if we shall do these thinges Our parte our lotte (whiche in the Greke tonge is called Cliros / of whō cometh this word Clericus is) nat ye erthly dominion: but ye heuēly. The Leuites in the olde law (which were Clerkes) had nat {per}te with their brethern / Rede in Deu¦te the .x. and the xviii. cha. & in the boke of noumbres the xviii. cha. & wolde you yt we shuld also haue the portion of our brethern? wherfore / or for what intente shuld I haue riches & possessyōs: which am cōmaun∣ded by ye wordes of my lorde / Math. 6. nat to be careful so moch as for to morow?Math. 6. & to whō he sayd also these wordes. Do nat gather or hurd vp treasur vpon erth. Do nat possesse golde / neither syluer / neither money in your purses.Math. 10 And it is a harder thing for a riche mā to ētre into ye kyngdome of heuen:Mark. 10 than it is / yt a camell do passe through the eye of a nedle. And therfore he chose to himselfe poore ministers / and those which had for∣saken all thinges / that they might folowe him. And
he him selfe also was the ensample of pouertie. So moche is euen but the handlyng of riches & money / Mark. 10 enemy & contrary to innocēcie and vertue: nat onely the possessyon and dominion of them. Onely Iu∣das which had the bagges / & dyd beare suche thīges as were sent: dyde play the false traytoure.Iohn̄. 13. and for the loue of money / whervnto he was wōted: He both repreued and betrayed his maister / lorde / and god. I feare therfore o Cesar / lest you wyl make me of Peter to be Iudas. Herken also what Paule sayth. We brought nothyng into this worlde / and it is no doute that we shall also cary nothinge with vs from hence.1. Tim. 6. Hauing meate & drinke & clothes to be couered with all: Let vs be cōtented therwith / for they that couer to be made riche: do fall into temptation / and into the snare of the deuyll / and into many desyers / both vn∣profytable and also noysome / whiche do drowne men and cast them downe into dethe and perdition. For couetousnesse is the rote of all euylles / whiche cer∣tayne men desyring haue erred from the faithe / and haue wrapped themselues in many dolours and soro¦wes. But thou being the man of god: flee & eschew these thinges. And do you Cesar / bydde me recey¦ue those thinges: whiche I ought to eschewe and a∣uoyde euen as venome or poyson?Riches is po¦son to men of the churche. And moreouer I praye you accordīg to your wisedome consyder / what place / tyme / or leysure can be lefte among these thīges to make sacrifyce / & to do goddes seruyce? The a∣postles / Actes. 6. whan certayn men gruged & were miscōtent that their widowes wer dispised in ye daily ministeri made answer / that it was nat mete or cōueniēt / yt their selues shuld leaue ye prechīg of ye word of god. & mi∣nistre or serue ye table. And yet to ministre to wido∣wes / is a farre other maner thyng: than to exacte & re¦quire tributes / rentes / customes / collage / than to haue care & charge of the treasure house / to paye soldiers wages / to be entāgled with a thousād lyke cares & bu¦synesses No mā / yt is ye soldiar of god:2. Tim. 2. Nume. 3. entāgleth hī∣self with worldly busynes / saith Paule. Did Aaron and other that were of ye stocke of Leuy: medle with

His sonnes / bi cause they had taken other mennes fyer (whiche was nat mete nor according) into their sencers / were brent and consumed with fyer sent from heuen. And do you byd or will vs to take the fyer of worldly riches / whi¦che is bothe forbydden and also prophane: into the holy sencers / Rede in the boke of Nu∣meri. that is to say / into to the offyce and wor¦kes belonging to preestes. Eleazar / Phinees / and other bisshoppes & ministers either of the tabernacle or of the temple: dyd they administre or medle with the ordring of any thinge / but onely of that / whiche belonge to the doinge of sacrifyce / and to the wor∣shippyng of god. Do I say / dyd they administre? nay morouer might they haue administred any other thing: if they wolde satisfye and fullfyll their offyce and dutie? whiche thinge if they wolde nat do: they shulde here the curse of the lorde / which sayth.Hiere. 48 Cur∣sed be they: whiche do the worke of the lorde reche∣lesly / whiche execration or curse / though it may falle vpon all men: yet moste of all and principally vpon prestes. O / howe great is the offyce of a bisshoppe? how greate a thinge is it / to be heed of the churche? how great a thynge to be made pastor and ouerseer / and gouernour of so great a folde of shepe? of whose hande shall be required the blode of euery lambe and shepe / that shall perisshe and be lost. To whom also it was sayd.Iohn̄. 10. If thou louest me more then other do / so as thou confessest and knoledgest thyselfe to do: fe∣de my lambes. Agayne / if thou doest loue me / so as thou sayest: fede my shepe. And the thirde tyme also / if thou louest me: fede my shepe. And do you Cesar wyll me to fede also gottes and hogges: whiche can nat be fedde nor kepte all of one / and the same herdes man. Besydes this / you ar willyng and aboutward to make me a kynge / or raither an emperour / that is to say / heed & chef of kīges. But our lord Iesu Christ beyng both god & man / kynge & preest / whā he sayd yt his self was a kynge: Herkē of what kingdome he did speke.Iohn̄. 18. My kingdome (saith he) is nat of this worlde. For

And what were the firste wordes of his preachinge / and the thinge whiche he oftentimes rehersed in his sermons. was it nat this? Do you penaunce / for the kingdome of heuen is ap∣proched and drawen nere.Math. 4. The kingdome of god is approched: to the which the kingdome of heuens shal be compared and lykened. Did he nat whan he spake these wordes / declare / that the seculare kingdome do∣the nothing apperteyne to him? And therfore nat on¦ly he dyd nat desyre / nor seche for suche maner king∣dome: but also / whan it was offred to him / hi wolde nat take it. For whan he perceyued / Iohn̄. 6. and vnderstode vpon a certayn tyme / that the people had purposed & appoynted in their myndes / to take him / and to ma∣ke him kyng:Christ fledde whan the peo¦ple wolde ha¦ue made him Kynge euer them. he fledde into ye solytarines of the moū¦taynes / whiche thynge he hath gyuen and taught to vs / that be his successours / for to be folowed / nat o∣nely by his example: but also by his precepte and cō∣maundemēt / saying in this wyse.

And who so euer wol¦de be chefest among you: shall be your seruaunte / ly¦kewyse as the sonne of man hath nat come to be myni∣stred vnto: but to mynistre / and to gyue his lyfe for the redemption of many. God in the olde tyme (to let you vnderstand / O Cesar) dyd constitute and set iu∣ges ouer the chyldren of Israell to gouerne them: and nat kynges / & he did hate the people desiryng to haue a Kynge / & that he gaue thē a kynge? it was done / 1. Reg. 8. be∣cause of the hardnesse of theyr hertes / Deut. 24. euyn lykewyse as for the same cause.

Cor̄. 6. Do you nat know (say∣th Paule) that sayntes and holy men shall Iuge of

Therfore if you shall haue seculare iugementes: make them iu¦ges in suche maters / whiche are moste contemptible and of least reputation in the churche or cōgregation But the iudges dyd onely iudge of matters being in contrauersie and strife betwen partie and partie / they dyd nat also exacte tributes. And shall I than exacte them: whiche do knowe that our lorde demaunded of Peter / of whom the erthly kynges toke tribute or payment of money / of sonnes: or elles of forayners and straungers?Math 17 And whan Peter had made answer that of forayners: Christ sayd agayne. Than are the sonnes free. Wherfore / O Cesar / if all men be my son¦nes / as certaynly they be: All men shall be free / and no man shall paye any thing.

For I can nat beleue / that I could other wise than by these meanes be able to saue and mayn∣tayne those thinges / which you had giuen to me. And if I shall do these thinges: Am I a bisshoppe? Am I the vicare of Christ? Shall I nat than here him thondryng and terryble sayng these wordes to me. My house shall be called the house of prayer to all na¦tions.Esaie 56. Mark 11. Iohn̄. 12. And thou hast made it a denne of theues.

Tour∣ne thy swerde agayne into his owne place / for who so euer shall take the swerde in hande: shall perysshe with the swerde. It is nat laufull for vs so moche

I shall gyue to the al the kyngdomes of the worlde: if thou wylt fal downe vpon the grounde / and worshyppe me.Math. & Luke. 4. Wher¦fore Cesar (take no displeasure with that / whiche I shall say) play nat the deuylles parte with me / byd∣dyng me / lykewyse as he bad / Christe / to receyue the kyngdomes of the worlde / of your gyfte / for I had leuer despyse them: than possesse them / & that I may now speke somewhat of the infydeles / but whiche I trust / and hope shall be made faythfull beleuers: do nat make me to them / of the aungell of lyght / an aū¦gell of darkenes / whose hertes I desyre and couete to induce to the fayth / and to godly lyuyng: and nat to put the yoke of seruytude and boundage vpon the neckes of them / and wyth the spirytuall swerde / Ephes, 6. whi∣che is the worde of god / and nat with the swerde of yren / to subdue them vnto me / lest they myght be ma¦de worse / lest they myght wynche or kycke agayne / and rebelle / leste they myght str me with theyr horne / leste they myght be prouok through myne erroure and faute / to blaspheme and speake euyll of the name of god. My desyre is to make them my derely beloued sonnes / and nat my bondemen / to adopte and chose them to my chyldren / nat to bye theym / to gendre and begette theym spyrytually /
and nat to make them my bonde seruauntes / to offre the soules of them / a sacrifyce to god: and nat their bodies a sacrifyce to the deuyll. Learne you at me (saith the lorde) whiche am mylde and humble herted Math. 11.Take my yoke vpon you / and you shall fynde rest to your soules. for my youke is swete and plesaunte / and my burdayne lyght and easy. Whose sentence in the mater here folowyng (to conclude now and make an ende) take you as gyuen bytwene you & me. Gyue to Cesar those thinges which apperteyneth to Cesar and to god those thynges which belong to god.Math. 22 Wher¦fore it is so / that neither you oughte to leue and for∣sake youre possesiyons: neither I oughte to receyue and take those thinges / that belong to Cesar / which surely I wyll neuer receyue: although you wolde offre them to me a thousand tymes. At this oration of Syluester / so godly and according for an Aposto∣lyke man. What coulde Constantine haue to laye a∣gaynst it for himselfe any longer? Seyng than that it is thus: Are nat they which say yt this donation or gyfte of Constantyne was made in very dede / iniuri∣ous agaynst Constantyne / To how ma∣ny {per}tes they are iniurious which beleue the donation of Constanty¦ne to be true. whom they iuge to haue ben wyllyng to disherite his owne children / & to we∣ken and feblysshe thempire of Rome? Are they nat al¦so iniuryous to the senatours & the people of Rome / to Italy / & to all the West parte of the worlde / whom they suppose to haue suffred thempire to be chaūged / agaynst both goddes lawe and mans lawe? Are they nat also iniurious agaynst Syluester / whō they iu∣ge to haue accepted the donation vnmete & vnsemely for so holy a man as he was? And are they nat iniuri¦ous also to the pope / to whom they do iuge it laufull / to possesse erthly kyngdomes / & to gouerne thempire of Rome? and  all these thynges hetherto spoken & reherced: apperayne here vnto only that it might ap¦pere and be open / that Constantyne among so many impedimentes & lettes / wolde neuer gyue from him selfe vnto Siluester / the grettest parte of the Ro∣mayne Empire / whiche thyng these men do say that he dyd.
¶ The seconde princypall parte of this oration / in whiche the author sheweth / that / although both Con¦stantine might haue ben suffred / and had ben willing to make this gyfte / and Siluester also willyng to ac¦cepte it (the contrary wherof hath ben afore proued) yet dyd neuer Constātine delyuer possessyō to Silue¦ster / but the same thinges remayned alwayes styll in the handes and gouernaūce of themperours. &c. BVt go to nowe / moreouer / if we shulde beleue this donation / wherof your writte maketh mē¦tion: it ought also to be sure & out of dout / that Syl¦uester dyd accepte the same gyfte. Now therof haue we non euydence: wherby we might be assured and put out of dout. But parauēture you wyll saye / it is credyble and lykely / that he dyd accept that graunt. ye / ywysse / I thinke so / and that nat onely he dyd ac¦cepte and alowe that donation: but also that it is cre¦dyble and lykely / that he dyd craue & desyre it. And that through continuall & importunate requestes and prayers: He gat it of Constātine / in a maner whe∣ther he wold or nat. Why / I say / do you cal that thīg credible: which is contrary to the opinion of al men? And all be it there is mention made of the donation or gifte in the pagine or writte of the priuyledge: yet is nat therfore to be supposed & thought / that the dona¦tion was accepted & taken. But rather contrary wise bycause there is no mention made of the acceptation: it is to be sayd / that it was nat gyuen. So / than it maketh more agaīst you / that Syluester refused this gyfte: than it maketh with you / that Cōstātine wold gyue it / & a benefyte is nat gyuen to any man against his wyll: if he lyste nat to receyue it. And we ought nat onely to deme / that Syluester dyd refuse these gyftes: but also that he dyd secretely shewe / that nei¦ther Constātine might rightfully gyue them / neither himselfe laufully receyue or take them. But O blinde and alwayes folysshe / and mysaduysed couetousnesse Let vs graunt that you could also bringe forthe wri∣tynges / whiche were true / incorrupte / syncere / and
perfyte of the assente and agremente of Syluester to the same: Dothe it folowe therfore / that those thyn∣ges hath ben gyuen in very dede / which are concey∣ued in the writynges? Where was possessyon gyuen? Where was the delyuering vp in to his handes? For if Constantine dyd gyue to Syluester nothing elses but onely the dede or writīg: than was nat his mynde to do Siluester a pleasure or good turne: but to gyue him a mocke. you saye it is very lykely / that he / whi¦che doth gyue any thinge: dothe also delyuer posses∣syon of the same. Take hede / and be ware what you speke / seing that it is vndoubted / that possessyon was neuer delyuered: and it is also doubte / whether euer the ryght and tytle were gyuen or nat. It is lyke to be true / that he which gaue nat the possessyon wolde nat gyue the right and tytle. Is it nat vndouted and of certaynte / that possessyon was neuer delyuered? whiche thyng who so euer wyll denye: he is without all honestie / and vtterly shamles. Dyd Constantine brynge or lede Siluester in to the Capitoly house / as it were one tryumphing / amonge the reioysynges & ioyfull showtynges of the multytude of the Cyti∣zens of Rome / beyng yet meydels and hethen men? Dyd he set him in a chayre or seate of golde / all the hole company of senatours beyng assystent and stan∣dyng by? And dyd he cōmaūde the heed offycers / eche one of them accordyng to his dignyte / to salute him and to honour him / as kynge or chefe gouernoure? These be the thynges / whiche are wonte to be done towardes newe princes: and nat onely some one pa∣lace (as for example the palace of Lateran) to be de∣lyuered. Dyd he afterwardes lede hī about through all Italy? wente he with him to all the thre partes of Fraūce? Dyd he go with him in to both Spaynes? Wente he with him to the Germaynes / and to the re∣sydue of the West regiōs? or if they both were greued and lothe to trauayle in their owne persones ouer so great a parte of the worlde / and so many dyuerse lan¦des and coūtrees: whom made they their deputies? and to whom assygned they so great an office? which
shulde bothe in the emperours stede delyuer posses∣syon: and in Syluesters stede receyue and take it? Doutlesse these must nedes haue ben some great men and of exellent auctorite / and yet who they were: no man can tell. In the tyme of our remembraunce (by∣cause I wyl passe ouer the aunciēt ensamples of olde tyme) we neuer sawe it otherwise done / whan any mā hathe ben made lorde / either of any cyte / regyon / or prouynce: but that so onely possessyon hathe ben iu∣ged to be gyuen and delyuered to him: if they olde offycers be deposed or put downe / and new be ma∣de and put in their stedes? Though Syluester wold nat at that tyme haue requyred this to be done: yet dyd it appertayne and belonge to the magnifycencie of Constantyne (that he might declare / nat onely by his wordes / but also by his dede / that he dyd gyue pos¦sessyon to Syluester / to haue deposed his owne de∣putes / lyeutynauntes / and other offycers / & to com∣maunde other to be put into their roumes / by the no∣mination & assygnement of Syluester. No man can saye / that possessyon was delyuered or gyuen vp: whi¦che remayneth styll in the handes of the same men / whiche possessed it before / and whan the newe lorde dare nat put them from it. But suppose / yt this thinge also doth nothyng let or withstand / but that we may thinke neuer the lesse / that Syluester had possessyon and let vs saye / that all thinges were than admini∣stred and done contrary to the commune maner and custome / & contrary to nature: I pray you / after that Constātine was gone awaye / what gouernours and rulers dyd Syluester make of the prouince or cytes? what warres or batayles made he? what natiōs that were rebelles dyd he oppresse or holde vnder? or by what captaynes & offycers did he these thīges / A bytter mocke. you do make answere & saye / we do knowe none of all these thinges. Verely I do thinke the same. All these thin¦ges were done in the nyghte tyme / and therfore no man coulde se them. Go to now furthermore / I pray you / was Syluester in possessyon? Who than dyd put him out of possessyon? For he was nat euer conty¦nually
in possessyon / neither any of his successoures / at the least wise / vnto Gregorius Magnus / whiche also was without possessyon. Nowe who so euer is out of possession / and can nat proue that himself hath ben driuen out of possessyon: doutlesse that man had neuer possessyon. And if he will saye / that himselfe hath had at any tyme possession: he his starke madde Seest thou here nowe / how I do proue the also to be madde? For elles: tell thou me / who droue the pope out of possessyon? Constātine himselfe / or his chyl∣dren / or Iulianus / or els any other em{per}our? Shewe the name of him / that dyd put him from possessyon. Shewe the tyme whan it was done. Shewe wher∣fore he was fyrst expulsed. Wherfrō nexte / & so forth in ordre. Whether was he expulsed by sedicion and manslaughter / or elles without these thynges? Dyd al nations conspire agaīst him to gether at one time / or els whiche of them began fyrst? What? Dyd no man at all helpe or aide him? Nat somoch as any of those / whiche had ben made gouernours & rulers of cyties & prouīces by Syluester / or by some other po¦pe? Dyd he lese all to gether in one daye: or els by ly¦tell & lytell. One {per}te at one tyme / & a nother parte at a nother tyme? Dyd he & his heed offycers make resi¦stence: or els dyd they at the first rebellyon & busynes gyue vp their possession & offices / & put thēselues frō all to gether? What? the cōquerours & ouer comers? dyd they nat make hauocke / with killīg & sleing those wretches & vile sorte of men / whome they iuged vn∣worthy of ye empier: to the reuengyng of their owne cōtumelie & iniurie? to the defence & mayntenaūce of the dominiō: which they had wōne & gotten by force and violēce / to the contēpte & despyte of our relygiō / and also to the example of thē that shulde come after their tyme? Did no man of all those / whiche were vanquesshed & ouercome: flie or rōne away? Did no man lurke and hide hīselfe? was no man afraide? O meruaylouse & wōderfull chaūce / that the empire of Rome / which was gotten & wonne with so great la∣bours / with so moche blodeshed shulde so pesably /

A man might suppose & wene / that Syluester had raigned in the woddes a¦monge trees: nat at Rome amonge men / and that he was driuen out of possessyon / by the winter showers and colde stormes: & nat by men. Who is he that doth nat knowe / if he be any thing acquaīted with histori¦es: how many kynges / how many cōsules / how many dictatours / how many protectoures of the cōmune pe¦ple / called Tribuni plebis / how many controllers & iuges of mēnes maners / called Censores / how many chamberlayns called Cediles / haue ben created and made in Rome? And there is nat one of so great a multytude & nombre / of so auncient & olde antyquite vnknowen to vs. We do know also / how many noble captaynes haue ben of the Athenienses / how many of the Thebanes / howe many of the Lacedemoniās. we haue knowledge of all their fyghtes / battayles and skirmisshes / made both on the lāde & on ye water. we do know also / who hath ben kinges & gouernours of the Perses / of the Medes / of the Chaldeis / & of the Hebrues / & of many other peoples & nations / & howe euery one of these hath receyued their kīgdomes / or hathe holden & kepte it / or how they haue lost it / or ha¦ue recouered it againe. But the empier of Rome / or¦elles the empier of Syluester: vnder what maner it hath begōne / or how it hath ended. whan / & by whom no man can tell / nor it is nat knowen / nat so moch as in the cyte of Rome it self. For I do aske & demaūde of you / what recordes or what authors can you brin∣ge forthe of those thinges? you do answer & say / that you can bringe forth none. And are you nat a shamed than / you beestes rather than men: to say that it is ly∣kely that Syluester hath had possessyon? But seyng that you can bringe forth no proffes for your parte: I

And so forth from hī / that all the emperours eche of thē after other had the possessyōs of these realmes: so yt you shal nat haue one worde to speake. But it is a very hadre thin¦ge / and a great maistri / as I suppose: to shewe this. Turne ouer & rede ye histories both in Greke & latyn / Rede the other authors & writers whiche haue made mēcion of those tymes / yet shall ye fynde none / that disagreeth from other in this thinge.

He gouerned the ēpier / & with great prepa¦ration & ordinaūce he made warre vpō ye Parthians At the whiche viage & settīg forth I was present also myne owne selfe. This Eutropius (I say) neither wolde haue passed ouer with sylēce the donatiō of the empier of ye West regiōs / neither wolde he haue writ¦ten a lytell after / in this wise of Iouiane / which suc∣ceded next after Iuliane.Iouiane thē∣perour nexte successour to Iuliane the Apostata. He made peace with Sa∣pore. A nedfull peace verely: but a shamfull peace / chaūging ye bondes of thēpier / & gyuēg vp a certayn portion of ye Romayne ēpier / which thīge neuer hap∣pened afore: syns ye Romayne ēpier was fyrst begon. Moreouer our legions at Claudiū propontiū Tele∣stinū / & at Numantiū in Spayne / & in Numidie / in token of subiection / were caused to passe through vn¦der a spere (as it was the maner than) but yet was there none of the bownes or termes of the Empier gy¦uen & delyuered vp. Here in this place it pleaseth me to speke to you / ye popes of Rome: which haue dyed of very late tyme / & to the Eugenie which arte alyue / but yet with the leaue & lycence of Felix / why do you so proudely bragge & boste of the donation of Cōstan¦tyne? why do you so oftentymes manace & threttē cer¦tayn kynges & princes: that you wyl reuēge ye takyng

Con¦cordia orbis. A thausande such ioynes shulde there be foūde also of the popes: if euer you had ben the chefe gouernours & rulers of Rome / wherof now there is none foūde / neither of golde / neither of syluer / neither is it reported or sayd / yt euer any mā hath seen any su¦che / & yet coude it nat be otherwise chosen / but ye nede¦ly he must haue had at yt time his {pro}pre coyne: who so euer helde thā thēpier of Rome / at ye leste wise vnder the image of our sauiour / or els of Peter. Oh / ye igno¦rance & folysshnes of men / do you nat se / if the donati¦on of Cōstātyne be true / yt no thyng at al is lefte to ye emperours? De latino loquor. Lo / I pray you / what maner ēperour / what maner kynge of the Romaynes shall he be: whose kyngdom if any mā had / & had no∣thing els besyde / he shuld haue vtterly nothyng at al? wherfore if it be euydēt (as it is) yt Siluester had ne∣uer possession / yt is to say / ye Cōstātine did neuer giue or delyuer possession: it foloweth also vndoutedly / ye Cōstantine neuer gaue (as I haue sayd) so moche as right or title to possesse thē / excepte you do say / yt the right was geuyn / but the possessyon nat delyuered for some cause or consyderation: ye I wysse / he gaue
that thynge / which he knewe shulde nat come to passe He gaue that: which he could nat delyuer. He gaue that / which he knewe was nat possyble to come into the hādes of him / to whom it was gyuen: afore that it shulde be destroied. He gaue a gyfte / which shulde neuer be of strengthe or stande in any stede / or at the least / nat afore .v.C. yeres were expired. To speke this / or thinke it: is playne madnesse. But now it is tyme (lest I be made to longe & tediouse) seyng that we haue cutte & mangled the cause of our aduersarys to giue it his dedly woūde / & to kyl it with one stroke. ¶The thyrde princypall parte of this oration / in which the author sheweth / that Constantine was be∣come Christen afore that Siluester was pope / & that those gyftes whiche Constātine gaue: were gyuen to the pope nexte after Siluester / which same also were but meane or small thinges / & no more than suffycient to the popes sustentation. EVery hystorie almost / which is worthy the na∣me of an historie: telleth and maketh mention / that Constātine / Constanty∣ne was made Christen of a chylde / long a¦fore that Sil¦uester was pope. Eusebius the author of the ecclesiasticall historie. euyn whan he was a childe: became Christē with his father Constātius / & ye long tyme a∣fore that Siluester was pope / as Eusebius ye writer of the ecclesiasticall historie / whome Rufyne a man right exellently lerned / hath trāslated / into the latyne tonge / and hathe also added two bokes of his owne tyme / which were bothe of them welnere in Cōstan∣tines tyme. Besydes this / we haue also ye testimonie & witnesse of ye pope of Rome / whiche nat onely was present at the doyng of these thinges: but also bare a great rule in the same / beyng also nat a witnesse: but the author or doer / nat ye teller or rehercer of another mānes busynes: but of his owne. He whome I do meane:Melchiades pope nexte a¦fore Sylues∣ter. is Melchiades ye pope nexte afore Siluester which saith in this wise. The church was come euyn vnto this poynt now: yt nat only people & natiōs / but also the princes of Rome / whiche helde thempier of the worlde: dyd come together to the faith of Christ and to the sacramentes of the faith. Among whom /
the most deuoute man Constantine fyrst of all other openly gettyng the faith & belefe of the trouth: gaue lycence through out all ye worlde / to as many as were vnder his dominion and gouernaunce / nat onely to be made Christen men: but also to buylde churches / and he ordayned landes to be gyuen. And to be short the afore rehersed emperoure gaue exceding gret gif∣tes / and he began first the buyldinge of the churche of saynt Peter / in so moche that he did forsake his em¦periall seate or place: and graunted it to the vse and behofe of blessed Peter / & his successours. Lo / here Melchiades maketh mention of nothyng that was gyuen by Constātine: but onely the palace of Late∣rane / and certayne other lādes / of whiche Gregorie very ofte maketh mētion in his regestre. Where than are they nowe / whiche do nat suffre it to be doubted / whether the donation of Constātine be of value and strengthe / or nat? seyng that the sayde donation or gyfte bothe was made afore Syluesters tyme / and was also of priuate thinges onely? which thyng al∣though it is playne & euident ynough: yet that nat withstanding / we must somwhat dispute & reson of that priuilege / which these folyssh felowes are wonte to alledge and bring forth. ¶ The fourth prīcipall {per}te of this oration / in which the author sheweth it to be vntruly sayde / that the co∣pye or example of this donation is founde in the de∣crees / or elles taken out of the historie of saynt Syl∣uester / and also declareth what folysshe / what impos¦syble / what barbarous / and what repugnaūt & con∣trary thīges / with other vnresonablenes / is cōtayned in the sayde copie. & besydes this he maketh mention of the fayned or friuolouse donation of certayn other emperours. And laste of al he sheweth / that in case it were / so that Syluester or any other pope had at any tyme possessed these thīges: yet being ones put out of possessyō / & so long cōtinuīg dispossessed as they haue done: they cā nat now after so long space of tyme clay¦me thē agayn / neither by the lawe of god nor man. &c.
ANd fyrst of all to begyne with / nat onely that felowe which wolde fayne seme to be Gratian whiche added certayn thynges to the worke of Graci¦an / is to be repreued of lewde vnshamfastnes: but al∣so they are to be reproued of ignoraunce and folyshe¦nes / The pagine of the donati¦on / is nat foū¦de in the olde decrees collec¦ted by Grati¦an. which do wene or suppose / that the pagine of the priuilege is contayned in Gratians worke / whiche thynge neyther any lerned man dyd euer suppose: & agayn it is nat founde in the moste auncyēt and eldest bokes of the decrees / & if in any place Gratian shuld haue made mention of this thīge / he shuld haue done it nat in this place (where they do put it interrupting and breking of the ordre and contexte of his oration and speche) but rather in that place / where he speketh of the paction & couenaunte of Ludouyke. Besydes this there are two thousād places in the decrees: whi¦che do proue this place nat to be true / of the whiche that place is one / where the afore rehersed wordes of Melchiades are alleged. Some men do say / that he whiche added this chapitour to the decrees: was cal¦led Palea / Palea in la∣tin sygnify∣eth chaffe. either for that this was his very right na∣me: or els bycause these thinges / whiche he dyd adde or put to of his own / if they be cōpayred to Gratiane are iuged to be / as it were / chaffe nere to the corne. But how so euer the trouthe is concerning this: it is a very great shame & an vnshamely thinge to beleue / that collector & gatherer of the decrees / either dyd nat know these thinges / whiche haue ben added & put to syns of Palea: or els dyd set gretly by them / and ac∣compe and take them for true thinges. This is well than / we are sufficed / we haue the victory & our owne purpose. First that Gratiane doth nat saye this thīge so as they belyed him: but moreouer he denyeth it and preueth it false and vntrue / as easily it maye be perceyued by a thousand places and mo. Seconda∣relye / that they do alledge for theym selues one man alone / and that suche one as is vnknowen / and of none auctorite / a tryfler / and so folysshe also: that he hath added certayne thynges of his owne fay∣nyng to the sayd Gratiane: whiche can nat agree
with the other sayinges of the same Gratian / is this than this authour / that you bryng forth? do you vse the testimonie of him alone? Do you recite a folyshe writtyng of him in paper / for the confyrmation of so gret a matter: agaīst six hundred kynges of proffes? But I loked for it / that you shulde haue shewed ly∣tell Images of golde / tytles & wrytynges in marble / and a thousand authours. But you do say / that Pa∣lea him selfe bryngeth forth the author / and sheweth the very fountayne of the historie / and calleth to wit¦nesse Gelasius the pope / with many other bisshoppes Of the historie (sayth he) of Siluester whiche bles∣sed Gelasius in the counsell of .lxx. bysshoppes repor¦teth to be redde of Catholyke men / and saith / that ma¦ny churches doth folow this same maner / accordyng to the olde aunciēt vsage / in ye which historie it is red¦de / Constantyne. &c. And a gret deale before where mention is made of bokes whiche are to be redde / & which nat to be redde: he hath sayd also / we do know that the actes of saynte Siluester the bysshoppe are redde of many catholyke men in the cyte of Rome: al be it that we do nat know ye name of him that wrote them / and the churches accordynge to the olde vsage do folowe the same. Oh / here is a wonderfull autho¦rite / a meruaylouse testimonie and recorde / & a stron¦ge & inuincyble probation. I graunt you this / that Gelasius sayd this: where he speaketh of the councel of .lxx. bysshoppes / dyd he therfore say that the pagi¦ne or copie of the preuilege is redde in the lyfe or ac∣tes of saynte Siluester? and that at Rome: the auc∣torite of whiche churche many other churches do fo∣lowe / whiche thynge I do nat denye: but I graunt / confesse / and knowlege / ye / and I do offre my self to be a wytnesse therof with Gelasius / but what cā this thynge profyght or auayle you? but onely that it myght appere / that you wolde haue lyed / in alled∣gynge and bryngynge forth witnesses and recordes. His name is nat knowen / which added this to ye de∣crees / & yet he alone doth say this thynge / his name is nat knowen / which wrote ye historie of Siluester
and yet he alone is brought forth / and that falsly for a wytnesse and a recorde. And do you good and wyse men iuge this to be sufficient / ye / and more than suffi∣cient / to the testimonie and witnessyng of so greate a matter? But consyder now and se / how great diffe∣rence there is betwene your iugemente and myne. I truly? al though this priuylege were contayned in ye historie of Syluester:The historye of Siluester is but a fay∣ned and a ly∣yng historye. wolde nat for all that thynke that it were to be accompted and taken for true. For as moche as that historie is none historie: but a fay∣ned and a shamlese lyeng tale / as I shall shewe and declare herafter / and also / seing that none other mā / namely beyng of any auctorite: dothe make any men¦tion of this priuylege.Iacobus vo∣raginēsis / the writter of sa¦es lyues. And Iacobus Voraginen∣sis / whiche bare great fauour and loue to the clergie as beyng himselfe an arche bisshoppe: yet in his stori of saītes lyues / and of the actes of holy men / speketh nat one worde of the donation of Constantine: but passeth it ouer with sylence / as beyng but a lyeng fa∣ble / and nat worthy to be put among ye actes of Syl∣uester / in whiche dede he gyueth in a maner sentence against them: if any wolde haue put these thinges in writyng. But I wyll drawe that falsyfier and forger of writtes / and very chaffe in dede / and nat whete: in to iugement / writhyng his necke / whether he wyll or nat. What sayst thou false forger of writyng{is}? How fortuneth it / or wherof is it longe / that we do nat re∣de this priuylege among the actes and dedes of Sil∣uester? I suppose this is a gesone boke / and harde to be founde / A bytter Irome. and there is but very few that haue it / and it is kept secretly / euen lykewise as the Regester or Kalender bokes of the Romaynes were kepte in the olde tyme of the bisshoppes / and as the bokes of Si∣billee were kepte of the .x. men / and it is written in the language of the Grekes / of the Iewes / or of the Caldayes. Gelasius recordeth / that it is redde of many Catholyke men. Iacobus Voraginensis ma∣keth mention of it. We also haue sene a thousand co∣pies of it / and that written in the olde tyme / and they are red almoste in euery Cathedrall churche / vpon
saynt Siluesters day / and yet no mā sayth / that euer he redde therin this that thou forgest and ymaginest. No man that euer he hath seen / no man that euer he dreamed of any suche thynges. It is parauēture so∣me other certayn historie / whiche other historie shall that be? I know none other historie / neither I do iu∣ge that thou doste meane of any other historie / than this / for thou spekest of that historie which Gelasius sayth / redde ofte in many chuches / but in this histo∣rie we do nat fynde the priuylege / if thā it be nat red∣de in the lyfe of Siluester: why dost thou say that it is redde there? why durst thou be so bolde to bourde in so great a matter? and to mocke and deceyue the couetouse desyre of lyght and folysshe personnes? But I am a fole / whiche do rather rebuke his bold∣nesse: than the peuysshnesse of theym / whiche ga∣ue credence to him / yf any man amonge the Grekes / amonge the Hebrues: ye / amonge the Barbarians / shulde say this thinge is founde written: wolde you nat bydde him name the author / and the booke to be brought forth / and the place to be expowned & decla∣red of some faythfull exposytour: er euer you wolde gyue credence to it? Nowe mention is made of your owne language / of a booke most cōmunely knowen / and yet you do nat make inquisytion or any serche of so vnbeleuable a dede / or els whan you do nat fynde it writtē: yet you ar so light of credēce geuyng / yt you do accōpt it for writtē & for true / & thīkyng this title to be suffycient / you make great trouble & busynesse in the worlde / and as though there were no doute in it at all: you do put them in feare with warre & other threttenynges / that do nat gyue credence to you? O good Iesu: how gret is the strength / howe gret is the diuinite or godly power of the trouth? whiche by it selfe / without any great enforcement or labour / defendeth it selfe from all gyles & deceytes / that nat without a cause / whan a great contention was ry∣sen vp afore kyng Darius / Rede in .iiii. chapt. of the thirde boke of Esdras in the Bible. what thynge shulde be of most myght and strength / and dyuerse men named dyuerse thynges: at the last the vyctorie & chefe price

And as Ter∣tullyane maketh mētion / whan Pontius Pilatus had written to Tiberius Cesar / of the merueylouse and wonderfull workes & dedes of Christ / and nat to the senatours (for the heed offycers & gouernours had ben wonte to write of gret maters vnto ye senate) the senatours toke this thyng greuously / & were gret¦ly dyscontente therwith. And whan Tiberrius gaue this prerogatyue / that Iesus shulde be worshipped for a god: they gaynsayde it / onely for the preuy in∣dignation & grudge which they had in their mindes: for that the dignyte of the senatorie ordre was offen∣ded & hurte. And that thou mayst knowe of how gret strength the aucorite of the senate is: they optayned that he shulde nat be worshipped for a god.Howe greate the auctorite of the senate was. Besides this thou sayst the Optymates whom we vnderstāde either to be the chefe men in the cōmune weale / & than
why doest thou name these: seīg ther is no worde spo¦ken of other offycers? or els by optimates we vnder∣stāde those / which are nat Populares / that is / which seche nat to get ye beneuolēce & good wyll of ye people but are ye fauourers & defēders of the best men & of ye good {per}ties or sydes / as Cicero sheweth & declareth in a certayne oratiō / that suche are called optimates. And therfore we do say / that Cesar afore that the cō∣mune weale was oppressed: was Popularis / & that Cato was one of the optimates / the dyfferēce of whi∣che two wordes Salust hath declared. And they whi¦che are called optimates in this sygnifycatiō / are no more sayde to be called to counsayle: thā other popu∣lare persons or other good men. But what meruayle is it / if the optimates be there made of counsayle: where the hole people (if we gyue credēce to this mā) dyd iuge with ye senate & Cesar? and that ye people be¦yng subiecte to the church of Rome. And which peo∣ple is this? The people of Rome? whye is it than nat called ye people of Rome: rather than the people subiecte? What newe & straūge cōtumelye / & meruay¦louse rebuke is this vnto yt cytizēs of Rome: of whō ye best & most exellēte poete Vergyle reporteth in this wyse. Tu regere īperio populos Romane memēto. Thou people of Rome / remembre thou to gouerne & rule people. That people whiche is the gouernour & ruler of other peoples: is called here Populos subia¦cēs a people subiect / which thīg was neuer herde here¦tofore. For in this (as Gregorius witnesseth in many epistles) diffreth ye bisshop of Rōe frō other bisshop∣pes: for yt he onely is the gouernour of a free people. But this admitted / that it were euen so as thou sayst Are nat other peoples also subiectes? doest thou mea¦ne of other peoples also? how coulde it be possyble / yt all the people beīg subiectes to the churche of Rome / were within thre dayes p̄sēt at the makīg of that de∣cree? how be it all ye vile sorte & the rascall of ye people I am sure / dyd nat iuge or decree. Moreouer / why shulde Constantine call the people subiecte: afore that he had made them subiecte to the pope of Rome
Agayne / why are they / whiche are called subiectes: sayd to haue borne a rule / in ye makīge of the decree? Besydes this / they are sayd to haue decreed euē this same thīg: that their selues shulde be subiectes: & that he to whom they were all redy subiectes: shulde haue them subiectes vnto hī selfe. What other thīge doste thou folysshe wretche / with those folysshe & mad ima∣ginatiōs: but onely shewe & declare / that thou haste wyll & desyre to deceyue & begyle: & that thou lackest power to do it. ¶ Eligētes nobis ipsu prīcipē apo∣stolo{rum} / vel eius vicarios / firmos apud deu else patro¦nes / et sicut nostra est terrena īperialis potēcia: ita eius sacrosāctā Ro. ecclesiā decreuim{us} venerater ho∣norare / & āplius {quam} nr̄m iperiū terrenū{que} thronū / sedē sacratissimā beati Petri gloriose exaltare / tribuētes ei potestatē / et gloriā / et dignitatē / et vigorē / & hono¦rificenciā īperialem. Chosīg the prīce of apostles hī selfe or his vicars: to be stedfast / & sure patrōs & de∣fēders to vs / afore god. And euen as our erthly ēpe∣riall power is: so haue we decreed / reuerently to ho∣nour his hole & worshipfull church of Rome / & glori∣ously to exalte ye most worshipfull seat of blessed Pet a great deale more / thā our ēpier & erthly throne / gy∣uyng to it power / & glory / & dignite / & strēgth / & ho∣norificēce ēperiall.Lactance fir¦miane wrote so eloquent∣ly: that saynt Iherome cal¦leth him lu∣uiū Tulliane eloquentlye / the flowynge ryuer of Tul¦lys eloquēce, Reuyue & waxe alyue agayne a lytell whyle / O Lactāce Firmiane: & relyst this asse cryeng out so maynely. He hath so great delyte & ple¦sure in ye claterīg noyse of proude & puffed wordes: that he repeteth & īculketh ofte agayn ye same thīges / whiche he had sayd nat lōge afore. Dyd the scribes of thēperours (bycause I wyll nat say the horsekepers) speke after this maner & facyō / in thy tyme? Constā¦tin{us} elegit sibi illos / nat patronos: but esse patronos. He put ī ye infynityue mode esse / to make ye nombre of the wordes ioyne more trymly to gether. An honest and a worshypfull cause forsothe / to speake barba∣rouslye: that thyne oratyon or speche maye ronne more plesauntely and goodlye / if it be so that anye plesaūtnes or goodlynes may be in so rought a style. Chosing ye prince of the apostles / or his vicars. you do nat chose O Cōstātine / Peter & his vicars: but
either him excludīg them / or them excludīg him. And he calleth ye popes of Rome Peters vicars: as though Peter were yet alyue: or as though the popes were of lesse dignite than Peter was. Is nat this also a bar¦barouse maner of speakīg. Cōcessā a nobis nostro{que} imperio. Graūted to thē by vs & our ēpier? as who shulde saye / that the ēpier had minde or purpose / and also power to graūte. And he was nat cōtented nor thought it ynough to say, Obtineāt / that they shulde haue & optayne: except he dyd say also / cōcessā / graū∣ted / natwithstāding that ye one of those wordes alone were sufficiēt. And that same / where he calleth them stedfast & sure patrons: is very elegātly spoken. For god wot / he wyll / that they be stedfast & sure: lest they myght be corrupted with money / or els myght shrike & fall for fere. And this sayeng also. Nostra terrena imperialis potestas / or erthly ēperyall power / where he ioyneth two adiectyues without a cōiūction copu∣latyue / and that also Venerāter honorare / worship∣fully to honour / & that Nostrae īperialis serenitatis māsuetudo. This gere sauoureth & smelleth of the e∣loquēce of Lactāce: where he speaketh of the power & gouernaūce of the ēpire: to name serenite & myldnes or gētelnes: & nat highnes or maiestie. which sayēg is also puffed & blowen vp with swolne pride: euen lykewise as that is: where he sayth. Gloriose exal∣tare per gloriā / et potestatē / et dignitatē / et vigorē / et honorificentiā īperialē. Gloriously to exalte by glory & power / & dignite / & strēgth / & honorificēce ēperyall. which maner of spekīg semeth to be takē out of yt Apo¦calipse or reuelation of sait Iohn̄ / Apocalip¦sis the .v. cha. where it is sayde. Worthy is the lābe / which hath ben slayn: to take or receyue power / dignite / wisedome / fortitude or strē∣gth / honour / & benedictiō. He semeth also oftētimes (as it shall euidētly appere herafter) Cōstātine to ta¦ke vpō him ye tytles & prayses belōgīg to god / & coue∣tyng to folowe ye maner of spekīg vsed in ye holy scrip¦ture: which he had neuer red.

Also that the bisshoppe of the sayde worshipfull churche of Rome / whiche shall be from tyme to tyme: be highest and chefe heed of all prestes and of the hole worlde / and that all thinges whiche shall appertayne to the honoring of god / and to the procurynge of the Christen ayth / and the stabilyte therof: be disposed and ordred by his iugement. Here I do passe ouer his barbarouse and corrupte maner of speaking / that ye sayd / Princeps sacerdoti∣bus for princeps sacerdotum and that he did put the∣se two wordes / Extiterit & existat / bothe in one place and that whan he had sayd / & in vniuerso orbe terra{rum} He addeth agayn / et totius mudi. As if it were a cer¦tayne sondrie thinge / or as it he wolde heuen to be contayned also / which is a parte of the worlde: whā a greate parte of the worlde was nat vnder the do∣minion of Rome / and that he sayth. ad fidem Chri∣stiano{rum} / vel stabilitatem pro curandam. makyng a distinccion and seperation of the faythe of Christen men / and the stabilyce therof / as though these two might nat be bothe to gether at one tyme / and that he mēgled these two wordes. Decernere & sancire. And that he maketh Constantine nowe to decree: as if he hadde nat iuged before with other / and as though he purposed to decree & ordayne a penaltie / & that he ma¦keth hī to establissh together with ye people. Besydes al these thīges / I say / what Christē mā can suffre this & nat sharply chastise ye pope which suffreth this / ye / & also hereth it gladdly / and reherceth it / that where as the Romayne see hathe taken primacie & preeminence of Christe (as the .viii. synode hath declared / Gra∣tiane
bering witnes / and many of the Grekes) nowe it is sayde to haue receyued it of Constantine / being yet scasely a Christen man / as it were of Christ him∣selfe? Wolde that most discrete and lowly prince ha∣ue herde this? wolde the most godly and vertuouse pope haue herde this? god shelde them bothe from so great synne and abhomination. Agayne / standeth this with reason / or maye it be naturally / that any man myght speake of Constantinople / as of one of the patriarchall / seattes: whyche yet was neither Patryarchall / neither any se at all / neither a Chri∣sten cyte / neither so named / nether yet buylded / nether so moche as purposed or appoynted to be buylded? For the priuilege was graunted within thre dayes after that Constantine was made a Christen man / at whiche tyme it was yet Bizantium: and nat Con∣stantinople. Let me be accōpted and taken for a lyer: if this folisshe felowe dothe nat confesse the same him selfe. For nere vnto the ende of priuilege: he writeth these wordes. ¶ Vnde congruum prospeximus / no∣strū imperium et regiam potestatē oriētalib{us} trāsfer∣ri regionibus / et in Bizantinae {pro}uintiae optimo loco nomini nostro ciuitatem edificari et illic nostrum cō∣stitui imperiū. Wherfore we haue iuged it mete and according / that our empier and royall power be tran∣slated to the regions of the Este / and that in the best place of the prouince of Bizantie: a cyte be buylded to our name / and that there our empier be cōstituted and set. If he dyd nowe but purpose to translate his empier to another place: he had nat yet translated it. If he were but mynded to constitute and set his em∣pier there: he had nat yet constituted or sette it there. So lykewise / if he was than but in purpose to build a cyte / he had nat buylded it as yet. He oughte nat therfore to haue made mention of it as of one beyng patriarchal / as of one of the foure sees / as of a christē cyte / as of one so named / as of one allredy buylded: of the building wherof he was nat yet so moch as in thought & purpose / after ye mynde of ye historie / which Palea bringeth forth to witnesse & recorde. But this
beest (whether he be Palea / or who so euer he be / whō the other doth folowe) doth nat parceyue and se / that he desagreeth from him / for there it is sayde / that Cō¦stantine nat of his own voluntarie mynde: but by the admonition and warnyng of god / as he slepte / nat at Rome: but at Bizācie / and nat within fewe dayes but after certayn yeres was purposed & determyned to buylde the cyte / & that he gaue to it the name / whi∣che he was warned and taught to gyue in his slepe / who than doth nat see / that he whiche made the priui∣lege: was longe after the tyme of Constantyne? and that whiles he wolde garnysshe and set forth his lye: he forgate that he had sayd before / that these thynges were done at Rome / the thyrde day after that Constā¦tine was baptised / so that the comune olde prouerbe may very accordyngly be applyed to him. Mēdacem memorem esse oportet. Alyer had nede to be good of remembraunce: Moreouer Bizantium the prouīce / (as he calleth it) was nothyng large ynough for the buyldyng of so great a Cyte / for Constantynople did contayne all olde Byzantiū / within the walles of it selfe / and yet this felowe sayth / that a cytie shulde be buylded in the best place of Bizantiū. Besydes this / he wyll that Thracia / wherin Bizanciū stode: is in the Eest parte / & yet in very dede it inclyneth towar∣de the northe / I suppose or wene that Constantyne knewe nat the place whiche he had chosen out among other / to the buyldyng of his cyte: in what quarter or parte of the worlde it was sytuate / neither whether it were a cyte or a prouynce / neither of what measure and largenesse is was ¶Ecclesus beato{rum} aplo{rum} Petri & Pauli / pro continuatione luminario{rum}: pos∣sessionū predia contulimus / & rebus diuersis eas di∣tauimus & per nostram imperalem iussionem sacram tam in oriente / {quam} in occidente / {quam} etiā a septentrione et meridionali plaga / videlicet et in Iudia / Grecia / Asia / Thracia / Affrica / & Italia / vel diuersis insu¦lis / nostra largitate / Et concessim{us} / ea prorsus rati¦one vt per manus beatissimi pacis nostri Siluestri sūmi pontificis / successorum{que} eius oia disponātur.
We haue gyuen certayn landes and possessyons to the churche of the blessyd apostles Peter and Paule / for the continuation and vpholdyng of lyghtes / and we haue endowed & enriched the same churches with dyuerse thynges / and by our sacred imperiall cōmaū¦dement of our lyberalyte and bountuousnes / we haue graunted to them our lyberty and power / as well in the Eest / as in the weste: and in the north / and in the south clymates or {per}tes of the world / that is to wytte / bothe in Inde / Grecelande / Asye / Tracia / Affrike / and Italye / or in dyuerse Ilandes / and that vtterly in suche wyse and maner: that all thynges be dyspo¦sed by the handes of most blessed Siluester our fader and pope / and by the handes of his successours / O false wretche / were there at that tyme churches or temples in Rome / dedicated to Peter & Paule? who had buylde them? who durst haue bene bolde to buyl¦de them? seyng that than there was no place for chri∣sten men (as the historie sayth) but onely secrete cor∣ners / and lurkyng places: or if there had ben any tē∣ples in Rome dedicated to those apostles / yet they were none suche / in whiche it were mete & accordyng that so gret serges or tapers shulde be lyghted / as be∣yng but lytle or small chapels / nat temples or chur∣ches / and onely oratories within their owne houses: and nat open great churches? he ought therfore / nat to haue taken care / & made prouision for the lyghtes of the temples: afore that he hadde taken care for the temples selues. What sayest thou / which makest Constantyne called Peter and Paule / beatos / that is to say blessed / and Siluester whan he was yet ly∣uyng / beatissimū / most blessed / and called his owne cōmaundemēt (whiche had bene nat longe before an infydele or paynyme) sacred and holy? were so great thynges to be gyuen for the vpholdynge of lyghtes / that all the hole worlde shulde be made wery therby? Or whiche landes are those / namely of possessyons? we are wonte to say Possessions of landes / but nat landes of possessyons / thou gyuest landes and lorde shyppes / and dost nat declare nor expresse whiche lan¦des
they be / thou hast enriched thē with diuerse thyn¦ges: and dost nat shewe neither whan / neither with what thynges thou wylt that the plages or regions of the worlde be disposed by Siluester: but thou dost nat shewe / in what maner or kynde of disposyng or orderynge / thou haste gyuen and graunted these thynges before. Why doste thou nowe sygnifye and gyue knowledge / that thou haste begonne this daye to honour the churche of Rome / and to graunt the priuilege to it? dost thou this day graunt and gy¦ue? dost thou this day make it riche or endowe it? why dost thou than say / we haue graunted / and we haue made riche or endowed? wottest thou what thou spekest / or what thou meanest thou beeste? I speke to the / the forger of this lye: and nat to the very good prince Constantyne. But why do I require or looke for any wisdome / or any lernyng in the: whiche arte nat endowed with any wyt or any literature at all as it appereth right wel whan thou sayst Luminariorū for Luminariū and orientalib{us} trasferri regionib{us}: where thou oughtest to haue said / ad oriētales trāsfer¦ri regiones? Moreouer which be those .iiii. plages or quarters of the worlde? which reckenest thou to be ye eest plage? Thracia? dothe it nat (as I sayd before) inclyne to the north? Iurie? but it lyeth more toward the south / as beyng nere vnto Egipte / whiche also callest thou the west plage? Italy / But these thynges were done in Italye / whiche no man lyuyng or aby∣dyng there: doth call the west plage or region / for as moch as we do say / the hispaynes to be in ye west. And Italye on the one syde / leaneth to the southe / & on the other syde / leaneth to the northe: rather than to the west. Which callest thou the septemtrionall or north plage? Thracia? But thou thyselfe shalte haue it to be on the east syde / or els Asya? But this it selfe alone occupieth and possesseth the hole east. And the north is commune to it and Europa / which callest thou the meridionall or south plage. No dout of it / thou mea¦nest Affricke. But why diddest thou nat expresse and shewe forthe some prouince by name? excepte perad∣uenture
the moores of Ethiopia were vnder the em∣pier of Rome. And yet neuer ye lesse Asia and Aphri∣ke haue no place here / where the worlde is deuyded in to foure partes / and the regyons of eche parte are rehersed by name: but whan it is deuyded in to thre partes / Asye / Affrike / and Europe. Excepte thou do∣ste name Asya for the Asyatike prouince / and Aphri∣ke for the prouince / whiche is nere vnto the people of Getulya / whiche I can nat see / why they shulde be principally and chefely named. Wolde Constantine haue spoken in suche wise / whan he had spoken of the foure principall partes of the worlde: that he wolde haue named these regions / & nat haue named other? and that he wolde haue begonne with Iurie / whiche is rekened and accompted a part of Syria / and whi¦che at that tyme was no longer Iurie / for as moche as Ierusalem was destroyed / and the Iewes chaced from thence and welnere destroyed / in so moche that I do suppose / that scacely any Iewe was than remai¦nynge in his owne countrey: but all inhabytid other nations? Where I besech you / was Iurie than / whi¦che was no longer called Iurie / euen lykewyse as we do se nowe at this day the name of that lande de∣stroyed? And euen as whan the Chananies were dri¦uen out / that region was no longer called Chanania but the name beyng chaunged / was called Iudia of the newe inhabytauntes the Iewes: so whan the Ie∣wes were banisshed and driuen out / and straungers did īhabyte it: it was no longer called Iurie. Thou namest Iewrie and Thracia / and Ilelandes: but the Hispaynes / and Fraunces / & Germayne / thou thyn∣kest nat worthy to be named / and whan thou spekest of other languages / as Hebrue / Greke / and Bar∣barouse: thou speakest nat of any of the prouinces vsynge the Latyne tonge or language. I perceyue now / thou dydest therfore ouerchippe or leue them out here: that thou myghtest contayne or comprehende them afterwardes in the donatyon. And what? were nat the west prouynces so moche worthe / that they myght mayntayne and vpholde the costes and char∣ges
of the lyghtes: excepte that the resydue of the worlde dyd helpe also? I passe ouer here / that thou sayest these thynges to be graunted per / largitatem that is to say of lyberalyte and bowntuousnes▪ than was it nat done for ye healyng of the leprie / so as they do say for els it were a strāge presūptiō in hī: who so euer wolde put or reckē a remuncratiō or recōpensati¦on in stede of lyberal or free gyftes. ¶Beato Silue∣stre / eus{que} vicario dep̄senti tradimus palatiū impe¦rit nostri Lateranense / deinde diadema / videlicet co∣ronam capitis nostri / simul{que} phrigiū / nec non su{per}hu merale / videlicet lorū / quod īperiale circūdare solet colū / veruetiam clamidē purpuream / at{que} tunicā coc¦cineā / et oīa imperialia indumēra / seu etiā dignitatē imperialiū praesidētiū equitū / conferentes ei etiam imperialia sceptra / simul{que} cūcta signa at{que} bona / et diuersa ornamēta imperialia / et oēm processionē im∣perialis culminis / et gloriā potestatis nostrae / viris etiā diuersi ordinis reuerēdissimis / clericis sāctae Ro¦manae ecclesiae seruiēcib{us} / illud colmē singula{rum} potē∣tiae / et praecellentiae / habere sāctim{us} / cui{us} amplisim{us} noster senatus videtur gloria adornari / .i. patritios / consules / effici.

But we shall at another tyme more so¦re inuaye / and speke agaynst these thynges / and at this tyme / lette vs speake somewhat / with this false forger of lyes: of his barbarouse language / thorow whose folysshe speche: his most shamelesse leasynge waxeth open & euydente / by the owne accorde / we de∣lyuer vp (sayth he) the palayce of our empier / called Laterane / As though he hadde done euyll / to put the gyftes of the palayce / here in this place among the or¦namentes: he rehersed the same agayne afterwardes where mention is made of gyftes / Moreouer the dia¦deme / and as though they dyd nat see / but hadde ben blynde / whiche were presente: he declareth it / say∣yng

The vnlerned da∣starde was ignoraunte / A diademe is of cloth or els of sylke. that a diademe is of clothe / or els paraduenture of sylke / wherfor that wyse say∣yng of a certayn kynge / is wonte to be moche spokē of / and praysed / whiche is sayd / whan the dyademe was delyuered vnto him: to haue holde it in his hā∣des / and to haue consydered and well aduysed it a longe season / before he wolde put it on his heed / and to haue sayde / O noble: rather than prosperouse & lucky clothe / whiche if a man knew parfyghtly with how many cares / ieopardyes / & miseries / thou art replenysshed: he wolde nat so moche as ones take the vp / if thou layest on the grounde. This felowe / we∣neth it to be of nought els: than of golde / to the whi¦che / nowe a dayes the kynges do put to / a crowne of golde with preciouse stones. But Cōstantine was nat a kynge / Constantyne was nat a kyng neither dyd he weare any crowne. neither durste he haue ben bolde to call him selfe a kynge / neither to apparaill him selfe after the maner of kynges / he was emperour or chefe cap∣tayne of Rome / nat kynge / where a kynge is: there is nat a comune weale.Impera∣tor.

Seu etiam digni∣tatem imperialiū presidentiū equitum / that is to say or the dignite of the emperiall presydente knyghtes / he sayth or he wolde departe these two thīges / the one from the other: as though there were great similytu¦de or lykenes betwen them / and he falleth downe frō speakynge of the emperiall habyte or apparayll: to the dignite of knyghtes / speakyng I wote nat what he wolde fayne expresse certayne meruaylouse thyn∣ges: but he is afrayde to be perceyued & taken with a lye / and therfore with puffed and swolne chekes / & with a bowlne throte: he gyueth a sounde without witte / and speketh without any reason or wysdome / no man can tell what Conferētes etiam ei imperialia sceptra / that is to say / Geuyng to him also the emperi¦all scepters / what a maner spekyng is this? what ele¦gancie? or what ordre is herein? whiche be those em¦periall sceptres?

Patricis or Consules. Who herde uer / that  nat  or other men were made Patricus?  may be made Cōsules: but nat Patrici men (I say) either of the senator kyndred (whiche is called Da∣rius patriciae or senatoria / bycause ye senatours were called Pares conscrip) or of the house or kyndred of thē equest ordre / or of the cōmune rascall sone. And it is a gretter thinge to be a senatour: than to be Patricius. For a senatour is one of the chosen coun∣sayloures of the cōmune weale / Patrici{us} but Patricius is he whiche descendeth by lynage of the senatorie house or stocke. So that he which is a senatour or one of the fathers is nat forthwith Patrici{us} / that is to say / bor∣ne of the senatour stocke. But thou wylt peraduen∣ture say / that there is mētion made of ye dignite / whi¦che is called Dignitas patriciat{us}: in many bokes. I do nat say nay / that such mētion is made / but it is in them / which speaketh of ye tymes after Cōstātine. It foloweth therfore / yt this pulege was made after Cō¦stātines tyme. But what may ye clerkes be made cō∣sules? Clerkes of Italy hath forbyddē thēselues ma∣riage of wyues / & shall they be made consules? And shall they cause soldyers to muster? & shall they go in to ye prouīces / wherof they be made rulers: with le∣gyōs / & the hostes of ye frēdes & felowes of ye Romay∣nes? Shal ye ministers & seruaūtes be made {con}suls? or shall they weare ye ornamētes of mē of warre? & shal nat payers or couples of consules be made / as ye olde vsage & custome was: but shall hole hūdredes & thou sādes of ministers / which shall serue ye church of Ro¦me haue ye dignite ēperiall? The ministers / shall be emperours / & the clerkes / shall be soldyers. Shall the clerkes be made soldyers? or shal they weare yt or namētes of a soldyer? excepte thou doste gyue to all clerkes vniuersally ye ēperiall ornamētes. For I wot no whit / what thou doest meane. And who dothe nat see an perceyue that this lyeng fable hath ben ima∣gined and deuised / by them whiche wolde themsel∣ues to haue lyberte for to weare all maner garmen∣tes / of what so euer fashyon them selues lyste / so
that if any kyndes of playes or mery pastymes be ex∣ercysed amonge the wycked spirites whiche inhabite the ayre: I do iuge they are most exercysed and most delyted / in counterfayting and expressyng / as it were in a stage playe / the appayrell / the pride and the super fluite vsed of clerkes. Whether shulde I more re∣buke and inuae agaynste / the folysshenes of the sen∣tences (whiche you haue herde alredy) or elles the fo∣lisshnes of his wordes? as for example / whan he say∣th. Senatum videri adornari? that the senate se∣meth to be adourned / as who shulde say doutles / that it is nat adourned in very dede / and that to be adour¦ned with glory / and whan he sayth that thinge to ha∣ue ben done: whiche is but in doyng / as Promulga∣nimus for promulgamus: We haue publisshed or pro¦nounced openly / for we do publysshe or pronounce openly. For in dede so the oration or speche sowndeth more plesaunlty. and whan he expreseth one and the same thynge bothe by the present / and also by the pre∣terperryte tence: as Decernimus & decreuimus: we do decree / and we haue decreed. And that all is full of these wordes Decernimus / decoramus / imperia∣lis / imperatoria / potentia / gloria. And that he abu∣seth this verbe Exat / puttynge it for this verbe est (where as Extate sygnifyeth as moche as superemi∣nere or superesse: to stande vp / or to remayne and be lefte) and Nempe for Silicer. And Concubitores for contubernales. He addeth also and ioyneth to hym certayne / with whom he shulde slepe (as I wene) lest he myght feare phantasmes or apparityons and sygh¦tes in the nyght / he addeth to him chaumberlayns / he addeth porters. It is nat for nought:An ironie wherfore he reherceth these small thīges / he instructeth & tea∣cheth a younge warde / or elles his sonne beynge a young man: and nat an olde man / for whom / he / as a very louyng father / prepaireth all thynges: wher of his younge & tendre age hath nede: as Dauid did for Salomon. And that this lyēg tale shulde be per∣fite / & lackyng in no poynt. He gyueth horses to the clerkes / lest they might els syt vpō asses backes aft ye
folisshe maner of Christ.Mat xxi. To folowe Christ in po∣uertye & hum¦blenes: is ac∣compted foli¦shenes of the clergye / nowe a dayes. And those horses / whiche are gyuen / are nat operti siue instrati operimentis coloris albi: but decorati colore albo. That is to say nat couered with couerynges or clothes of whyte co∣loure: but beutifyed and adourned with whyte co∣loure. And with what couerynges or clothes? nat with couerlettes or arayes clothes / nor with one o∣ther kynde of clothes: but onely / mappulis & linthea∣minibus. Mappae / that is to say / bordeclothes: be¦longe to a table. Lintheamina / that is to say shetes belonge to beddes. And as if it were doute / of what coloure table clothes / napkyns / and shetes were: He declareth it / sayeng. id est candidissimo colore. that is to witte / of very whyte coloure. Is nat this seme¦ly speche for Constantine? Is nat this eloquēce wor¦thy and mete for Lactance? bothe in other thynges: but specially in this sayng / Equos equitēt? And nat withstandyng / that he hathe spoken nothyng of the apparyll of senatours / neither of their garment cal∣led Latus clauus / neither of purple / neither of other garmentes appertaynyng to them: yet he thought it necessary / to speake of their showes. And he dyd nat call them Lunulas: but Vdones or cum vdonibus / whiche / the folysshe felowe / as he is wonte to do / ex∣powneth / sayeng: Id est candido lintheamine: as though Vdones were but lynnen cloth. It cometh nat to my remenbraunce at this tyme / where euer I haue red this worde Vdones: but onely in Valerius Martialis / Vdones. in whom there are two verses / whose ti∣tle is. Vdones cilicini: as you wolde say sockes of heer. The verses are these. Non hos lana dedit / sed olentis barba mariti Cymphio poterit planta latere sinu. Whose sentence in Englisshe may be this. The stuffe wherof these are made: is nat wolle / but the heer of the stynking gottes bearde / so that nowe thou mayst hyde thy fote in a shoe or socke of gotes heer. Vdo∣nes / ther fore are nat of lynnen / neither ar nat whyte / wherwith this two foted asse doth say / nat that ye fete of the senatours ar shoed: but that the senatours are
illustrated. At{que} per hoc ita caelestia sicut terrestria ad laudem dei decorentur. And by this meane that the heuenly thinges may be decked and adourned / e∣uen so as the erthely thinges be: to ye laude or prayse of god. Which callest thou heuenly thinges? whiche erthely thinges? how or in what maner are the heuē¦ly thinges beutifyed or adourned? And what prayse this shulde be to god: auyse the / The seculary¦te of the cler∣gye / is odible bothe to god and man. for I truly (if there be any fayth or trouthe in me) do suppose nothyng to be more hatefull neither to god / neither to other men / than so outragiouse liberte of clerkes in seculare thin¦ges. But why do I in this wise make assaulte agaīst euery particulare sayeng? The tyme wyll fayle me / if I wolde / I do nat saye amplyfie all thynges: but onely touche them. ¶ Prae oibus autem licentiam tribuim{us} beato Siluestro et successorib{us} eius / ex no∣stro in dictu / vt quem placatus proprio consilio cleri care voluerit / & in religioso numero religioso{rum} cleri∣corum cōnumerare: nullus er omnibus praesumat su¦perbe agere. Aboue all we gyue lycence to blessed Siluester / and to his successours / by our cōmaunde¦ment / that if it shall lyke & please hym to make any maner man a clerke / and to recken or accompte him in the religiouse nombre of religiouse clerkes: that no man of al men what soeuer he be / do presume to do proudly. What Melchisedech is this here / Gene. 14, which bles¦seth the Patriarche Abraham? Dothe Constantyne beyng yet scasely a Christen man / gyue lycence and power of makyng clerkes / to him: of whom he was baptised / and whom he calleth blessed? As though Siluester neuer had made / neither coulde haue ma∣de any clerkes before? And with what communicati∣on or thretenyng dyd he forbydde / that no man shuld let him / or be an impedimente to him? sayeng. Nul¦lus ex omnibus presumat superbe agere: Lette none of all men presume to do proudely? And with howe gret elegancie also? sayeng. Cōnumerare in numero religioso religiosorum / et clericare clericorum / & in dictu / & placatus? And than he retourneth agayn to speke of ye diademe. Decreuimus ita{que} & hoc / vt ipse

We haue decreed this also / that he / and his suc∣cessours / ought to weare the diademe / that is to wit the crowne / whiche we haue gyuen to him from our owne heed / beynge of most pure golde and preciouse gemmes or stones / for the honour of saynte Peter. Here agayne he dothe interprete & declare the worde Diadema: bycause he dyd speke to barbarouse & for∣gteful {per}sons. And here he addeth also / Of most pure golde: lest peraduenture a man wolde suppose / that some coppre or brasse / or els some corruption or drosse and fylth were mengled amonge it. And whā he had sayd / gemmas which was suffycient: he added Pre∣ciosas / fearyng lykewise / lest a man wolde els perad¦uenture haue demed them to haue ben of small value and lytell worth. But why dyd he nat saye Preciosis¦stmas / that is to say most precyouse: lykewyse as he had sayd / Aurum purissimū / golde most pure? For there is more difference in value / bytwene one gem∣me or precyouse stone / and another: than is bytwene one golde / and another. And where he ought to haue sayde Distinctum gemmis .i. garnisshed or besette with preciouse stones: he said that it was ex gēmis .i. of preciouse stones. Who dothe nat see and perceyue that this maner of spekynge was taken of that place in the psalmes (whiche the hethen prince had neuer redde) Posuisti in capite eius coronā de lapide pre∣cioso .i.Psal. 20. thou hast put on his heed a crowne of precy∣ouse stone? Dyd Cesar speake in suche maner wyse / through a certayne vaynegloriouse desyer to bragge and bost of his crowne (if it be so / that Cesar were crowned) beyng cōtumelyouse and rebukefull to his owne selfe / in that he dyd feare / lest men wolde haue supposed & thought hī nat to haue worn a crowne of most pure golde & precyouse stones: except he had gy¦uen them knowledge therof / and tolde it them by his owne wordes. But herken nowe the cause why he speaketh so. For the honour of blessed Peter / as who
shulde say / that Christ were nat ye chefe corner stone / vpon which the temple of the church is buylded: but Peter / which thynge he doth also agayne afterwar∣des. But if he was desyrouse to worshippe Peter so greatly: why dyd he nat dedycate the episcopale tem¦ple at Rome to him: rather than to saynt Iohn̄ Bap¦tiste? Moreouer / dothe nat the very barbarousenes of the maner of speakyng / wytnes openly: that this caroll hath ben fayned nat in the tyme of Constan∣tyne / but in a tyme more late? whan he sayth / Decre∣uimus {quod} vti debeant .i, we haue decreed / that they ought to weare: where he shulde haue sayd Decreui¦mus vt vtātur .i. we haue decreed that they may wea¦re? Euen so speake barbarouse lawes nowe a dayes / & thus they write / Iussi {quod} deberes venire: wher they shulde say / Iussi vt venires. And he sayth here De∣creuimus et cōcessimus: we haue decreed & we haue graūted / as though these thīges were nat than in do∣yng: but had ben done at some other tyme. ¶ Ipse vero beatus papa su{per} coronā clericat{us} / quā gerit ad gloriā beatissimi Petri: ipsa ex auro non est passus vn corona.

yet that it dyd neuer retourne after his deth and bu∣rial / namely seyng that it was roborated and streng∣thed afore that it was written / and that nat with one hande but with both the handes of Cesar. And what meanest thou / whan thou sayst roboratyng & streng∣thyng? was it strengthed with the hande wryttynge of Cesar hīselfe: or els was it sealed with his signet? This was a great strengthyng doutles / and moche greatter: than if he hadde grauen it in tables of brasse.An Ironi But yet neded it nat to wryte them in brasse: seyng that the paper was layde vpon the body of bles¦sed Peter / why spekest thou here no worde of Paule / which lyeth buryed with Peter / and they both toge¦der myght better and more safely kepe it: than the bo∣dy of the one of them alone? you see here the craftes and malycious subteltie of this our most wicked and gylefull Synon. Because the donation of Constan∣tyne can nat be euydently proued: therfore he sayde / that the priuilege is nat wrytten in tables of brasse / but of paper / and it lyeth buried and hydde with the body of the most blessed Apostle: that we shulde nat be bolde either to serche it in ye worshypfull sepulchre or graue / or els if we wolde serche it: that we shulde thynke it to be rotten and consumed. But where was than the bodye of blessed Peter? Doutles nat in the temple or church where it is nowe / nor in no stronge or safe place / it foloweth therfore / that Cesar wolde nat haue layde the writte or pagine in that place / whe¦re the body was. Durst he nat put Siluester in trust with the pagine? was Siluester so vnholy? was he so folyshe? was he so neglygēt & rechelesse? O Peter / O Siluester / O you bysshoppes of the holy church of Rome / to whom ye cure & charge of the lordes she∣pe is cōmytted: why do you nat kepe safe the pagine whiche was cōmitted and betaken to you? why haue you suffred it to be gnawen and eaten of wormes? & to consume and rotte away for age? I suppose it is / bycause your owne bodyes also haue rotted and haue ben consumed. Than dyd Constantyne folyshely to lay it with your bodyes. Lo / now that the pagine is
resolued and brought in to pouder or duste: the right or tytle of the priuilege is also tourned into dust and brought to nought, But yet you wyll say / that there remayneth a copie of the same pagyne / as we do see. Who thā was he: which was so presumptuouse and folissh hardy / to take this pagyne from the bosome of the most holy apostle? Doutles you ought to brynge forth or name some of the olde authours / & suche one as was alyue in Constātynes tyme. But you can nat bryng forth or name any such writer. But peraduen∣ture you wyll bryngforth some man that wrot of late tyme. Where had he this knowlege? For who so euer maketh any historie of thinges done afore his tyme / either he speaketh as the holy ghost endyteth to him / and putteth into his mynde: or els he foloweth the au¦thorite of the olde authours / & that of suche as wrote of thinges done in their owne tyme. Wherfore who so euer doth nat folowe the olde authours / he shalbe of the nombre of them whom very aūcientnesse & antiq∣tie maketh hardy and bolde to make seasynges. And if in any place this thyng be reed / it doth accorde and agree with antiquite / euyn as moch as that peuysshe and madde narration of Accursius the glose maker / Accursus. which he telleth of embassadours sent from Rome to Grecelande for to receyue the lawes / doth accorde wt Titus Liuius / & other most exellent authours of the olde tyme. ¶ Datum Romae tertio calendas Aprilis Constantino Augusto quareo consule / it Gallicano quarto consule .1.

But it is a gretter meruayle / and more to be wondred at / that the emperour Augustus beyng full of the leprie / called Elephantia (bycause it passeth other dyseases: as the elephant dothe other beastes) wolde take that highe dignyte and offyce of a consull vpon him / 4 Reg 13. seyng that Azarias / as sone as he was touched with the leprie: kepte himselfe secret within the house / cōmittyng the ordring and gouer∣naunce of his realme / to his sonne Ionathas / as for the most parte / Ioseph{us}. libro no∣no cha. 11. all leprouse kynges were wont to do. By whiche argumente alone / all the hole priuylege is vtterly cōfuted / proued false / & ouerthrowen. And that no man may dout / but that it must nedes be / that he was infected with leprie / afore that he was made consull: let him vnderstande and know this (whiche thinge phisycions do wytnesse) that this sickenes or dysease groweth and encreaseth preuely / by lytell and lytell. And agayn lette him vnderstande and knowe this also (which appereth euydētly by olde histories) that they were wonte to entre in to the offyce of the consull / in the moneth of Ianuarie / and that it was in offyce lastyng but one yere. And these thinges are sayde to haue ben done at the March next after. And here also I can nat ouerhippe this / that in epistels is wonte to be written: Datū. &c. but nat in other wri∣tynges / excepte it be of suche as haue no lernyng / for epistels or letters are said to be gyuen: & therfore we say / Do tibi epistolā.

Do ad te epistolā / is as moch to say / Do ad te epistolā. as I write or sende a letter to you. But this priuilege (as they call it) of Constātyne / whiche ought nat to be delyuered to any man / ought also nat to haue ben said to be gyuen / so that it may appere e∣uidently / that he whiche spake thus dyd lye falsely / & yet had no wytte or cōnyng to fayne craftely such thī∣ges / as it might be lykely to be trewe / that Constan∣tyne
either sayde or dyd. And all they make themsel∣ues pertayners and cosyns to him in folisshnesse and madnesse: who so euer do thynke and defende it / that this felowe hath sayd true thynges: albeit that they haue nothing / wherby they may / I do nat say defēde: but honestly excuse theyr opinion. Is this an honest excuse of errour / whan thou seest the trouth manifest¦ly and openly shewed / nat to be willyng to agree vn∣to it / bycause certayne great and excellent men haue ben of the contrary opinyon to the trouthe (I meane great men of dignyte: and neither of wisedome / nei∣ther of vertue) But yet wherby knowest thou / whe∣ther they / whom thou folowest / if they had herde the same thynges so playnly declared / whiche thou doest here: wolde cōtynus and abyde styll in their opinion or els wolde go from it and forsake it? And yet neuer the lesse it is a great shame / and an excedynge great offence / to regarde a man more / It is an exce¦dyng shame / to gyue more credēce to a∣ny man: than we do gyue to the trouth selfe. and to gyue to hym more credence: than we do regarde the trouthe / and gyue credence to it / that is to witte / to god. For ve∣rely certayne men beynge destytute of all reasons or argumentes: are wonte to aunswere in this wyse. why haue so many popes beleued this donation to be true? I testefye to you / you do prouoke me to that / whiche I am euyll willynge & loth to do / and you do compell me agaynst my wyll / to speake euyll of the popes: whom I had leuer / if I myght: to hyde and couer in their offences and trespasses. But let vs pro∣cede & holde on to speke boldely / in as moche as this cause can nat otherwise be pleaded. Thoughe I do graūt that the popes did verily so beleue / & that they dyd it nat of a crafty & malicious purpose. What mar¦ueyle is it if they dyd beleue these thynges / wherin so great lucre & aduantage is pleasaunt & lykyng to thē / Popes foly∣she / and igno¦raunte. seyng that throughe excedynge folysshnesse & lacke of knowlege / they do beleue many thynges / wherin no lucs at all is shewed?

Bycause I haue made mē∣tion somewhat of Ieronimy: I can nat suffre this cō∣tumely done to him / to be passed ouer with sylēce.

of an vnlerned man / moche lyke hervnto is it (albeit there ar a thousande suche maner thynges at Rome) that among the holy relykes there / is shewed in a cer¦tayne table / yt ymage or portrature of Peter & Paule whiche Syluester shewed to Constātyne / after that he had ben monysshed & taught of the same Apostels in his slepe / for the cōfyrmation of the visyon that he had sene. I do nat say this bicause I do deny yt those ymages or purtatures be the true ymages & pictures of the aforenamed apostles (and wolde god / that the epistle / which was sente urthe name of Lentulus / The epistle of Lentidus / cōcerning the ymage of chri¦ste: is a false forged thīge. of the ymage of Christe: were as true / whiche doutles hath bē no lesse eudly forged / thā this false priuilege / which we haue cōfuted) but for ye / that Siluester did neuer shewe that table to Constātine / In which thin¦ge I can nat fynde in myne herte to kepe within me / the great meruaylyng of my mynde. For I wyll dis∣pute & reason somewhat of the tale / whiche is forged of Siluester. And bycause both al our questyō depē∣deth herof / and also seyng that I do speke to the po∣pes of Rome / it shall be most semely & accordyng for me / to speake of a pope of Rome / that by this one en∣sample / a cōiecture may easely be taken of other thin∣ges. And amonge many other fonde folyes & madde trifles / which are tolde & reherted therin:The confuta¦tion of that fained tale of the dragon / which is red¦de in the lyfe of saint Sil¦uester. I wyll tou¦che that onely of the dragon / to thentent that I may euydently cause you to knowe / that Constātine was nat full of leprie (For the actes of Siluester or the hi¦storie of hī: as the interpretour witnesseth) was made by one Eusebius a certayne man of Grecelande / whi∣che nation hath alwayes be greatly gyuen to lyeng / as Iuuenale reporteth of thē / who was the author of sa∣lt Siluesters lyfe. sayeng in his checkīg satyre. Ouicquid Graecia mēdax audet in historia .i. What so euer thynge the lyeng Grekes dare be bolde to do / in writīg of histories. From whence dyd that dragon come? Dragons are nat gendred at Rome.The histori∣es of the Gre¦kes ar corrup¦ted with lyes Which also had that dragon his poyson? Pestiferou∣se and venemouse dragons are sayde to be onelye in Affrike / by the reason of the excedyng and outragi∣ouse heate of ye region. Besydes this / whence coulde
he haue so moche habundance & plentie of venome & poyson / that he might enfecte and corrupt with pesty¦lence / so large a cytie / namely seynge that hym selfe laye downe in so depe a denne or dongion / that men wente downe in to it / by an hundred and fyftie step∣pes or stayres?Serpētes ar noysome nat with theyr brethe: but with their bi¦tynge: onely the cocodrice except. Serpentes (onely the Basilyske or Cocodrise excepted) do poyson & kyll men / nat with their breth: but with their byting. Neither Cato / whan he fledde from Cesar with so great an hoste of men / whyles he iornayed through the myddes of A∣phricke sondes / and slepte there: sawe any of his cō∣pany kylled or destroyed with the venemouse brea∣thing of any serpentes.Cato. Neither the peoples of that coūtrey do fele any corruption or infection of the ayre through that cause. And if we do gyue any credence to poetes fables: bothe Chimera the monstre / and Hydra / and Cerberus the mastyffe of hell / were sene and touched cōmunely / without any harme or hurte taken therby. Agayne / why wolde nat the Romayns rather haue kylled hym? Thou wilte peraduenture say / bycause they were nat able. But yet Regulus slewe a moche gretter serpente in Affrike / Marcus Tili{us} Re¦gulus. at the ban¦ke of the ryuer Bragadra. And it was no mastry to haue kylled this dragon: if they had done no more / but onely haue closed or stopped vp the mouth of the caue or denne. What? wolde they nat do so? I sup∣pose they dyd worshippe hī for a god / euyn so as the Babylonians dyd worshippe another dragon.Dan̄. 14. Why than wolde natre Syluester rather haue slayne this dragon: so as it is sayd / that Daniell did in the olde tyme? Why wolde he nat haue bounde him with an hempen threde? and haue destroyed ye house for euer? But the forger of this tale / wolde nat that the dragō shulde be kylled: lest men might playnly deme & iu∣ge / that he dyd reherce the narration of Danyell.

For who had buylded an house vnder the grownde for ye beast? who had put that beast in that house? and had cōmaunded him that he shulde nat come forth and flye away? For dragons do flye / as certayne men sayne / though other men do saye nay) who had deuysed and ymagined that kinde of meate? Who had cōmaunded women and those virgins and nonnes to go downe into that denne: and that neuer but on the fyrste day of the moneth? Dyd the dragon knowe whiche was the first daye of the moneth? and was he contented with so scace and syldome meate? Nor dyd the Virgins drede so depe a dongyon? so gret / so cruell / and so hungry a beast? I suppose the dragon fawned on them: bycause they were womē / An irony bi¦cause they were virgins / and bycause they broughte hym meate. ye / and I suppose also / that he did com∣mune and talke with them. And why shulde he nat also (sauyng your reuerence) haue to do and gendre with them. For bothe Alexandre & also Scipio / Rede plutar∣che in the ly∣ues of Alex∣dre & Scipio are said to haue ben begoten by a serpent or dragon / that lay with their mothers. What say you moreouer / af∣ter that his wonte meate or foode was denyed hym / wolde he nat rather haue come forthe and ben slayne. ❀ O the marueylous madnesse of men / whiche do gyue credence to suche olde dotynge wyues tales.

I deny that the history of Siluester is Apocrophe (yt is to wit / whose authour is nat knowen) (for as I sayde before / It is sayd that Eusebi∣us a Geccian is the auctor of saint Sil¦uesters lyfe. a cer∣tayne man called Eusebius / is sayd to be the authour therof) but I say playnly / that it is a false hystorie / and nat worthy to be redde / bothe in other thynges: and specially in those narratiōs of the dragon / of the

For all be it Naaman was a leprouse per∣sone: it foloweth nat therfore forthwith / that Cōstan¦tyne also was full of lprie. Many authors haue ma¦de mention of Naaman / but of Constantine / which was prince and gouernour of the worlde: no man ha∣th written / nat so moche as any of his owne cytizens / but onely I wot nat what peuysshe felowe of a straū¦ge countrey / to whom no more credence is to be gyuē than is to a nother certayne felowe / whiche wrote of the waspes / that made their nestes in Vespasianus nose / The tale of the waspes in vespasia∣nes nose / & of the forgge wherof Nero was dely∣uered: ar fals forged▪ tales and of the frogge / of which Nero was delyue∣red / as it had ben of chylde / wherof they say / that the place is called Laterane / {quod} rana ibi late at insepul∣chro .1. bicause the frogge is hydde there in the graue / which thynge I am sure / neither the waspes / neither ye frogges selues wolde haue sayd: if they coulde ha∣ue spokē / except they do referre this to the goddes of the eanytoly house / as if they wolde saye / that these goddes had ben wonte to speake / and had cōmaūded this thynge to be done.

Which thīge / as I suppose and iuge:The corona∣tion of them∣perour ought to appartay∣ne to the peo∣ple of Rome which  the pope cha¦lengeth to hī selfe onely. nat very chyldrē wolde haue done. Wher∣fore it is so moche lesse meruayle / if the pope do cha∣lenge & take vpon hī the coronation of thēperour: whi¦che ought to ap{per}tayne vnto ye people of Rōe. If thou O pope / both arte able to depriue the Greke ēperour: of Italy & of the prouīces of the West. And doest also make ye latyne ēperour: Why vsest thou such pactiōs / promyses / and couenaūtes? Why doest thou parte & deuyde ye goodes of Cesar?He is no very emperoure / & also he is for∣sworne: that goeth nat a∣bout to reco∣uer the cite of Rome / from the pope. Why doest thou trāslate the ēpier vnto thy selfe? wherfore let him know / who so euer is ēperour of Rome: that in my iugemēt he is neither Augustus / neither Cesar / neither emperour: excepte he do holde & kepe the ēpier & gouernaunce of Rome / & excepte he do gyue dilygēce / & enforce hīself to recouer the cytie of Rome: that he is periured and
forsworne. For the emperours in olde tyme / The em{per}ors in olde tyme / wer nat swor¦ne solempne∣ly to the pope as they are now a dayes of whom Constantine was the fyrst: were nat constrayned to make any such solempne othe / wherwith now adaies but emperours are bounden. but onely / that / as mo∣che as might be done by mannes power: they shulde minysshe nothinge of the amplytude and maiesty of the empier of Rome. but that with all their labour and dilygence they shulde augmente and increace it. yet were they nat therfore called Augusti / {quod} imperiū augere deberent. 1. for that they ought to augmente the empier (as the opinion of some men is / whiche are vnskylled in the latyne tonge) But Augustus is as moch to say / as Sacer / holy or worshipfulle and it is said Ab aulum gustu .1.what Augus∣tus signifieth & why the em¦perours were called Augu∣sti. of the tastyng or eating of the byrdes. whiche thynge was greatly obserued / marked / and taken hede of in the olde tyme: whan they wolde diuyne of the lucke that shulde folow any earnest thinge that they toke in hande / August{us} and therfore where the latyne men do saye Augustus: the Grekes do say Sebastos .1. venerādus or honorabilis.how the pope might be cal∣led Augustus The pope might better be called Augustusab augendo .1. of encreasing or augmentyng: saue onely / that why∣les he encreaseth temporall thīges / he minyssheth the spūall thinges. And therfore may you se / The worst po¦pe / did moste defēde the do¦nation of Cō¦stantyne. that as e∣uery pope was most victouse and worst disposed: so he gaue him selfe most to the defending of this dona∣tion. of which sorte / Boniface the eyght was:Nota. Boniface the viii. an vn∣gratiouse & a myscheuouse pope / & al set vpon worldly pride: had a myscheuouse ēde as the cro¦nicles do testi¦fye. why∣che deceyued Celestyne by trumpes putte within the wall. This Bonifacius also writeth of the donatiō of Constantine. and he depriued or deposed the king of Fraunce. and iuged the kyngedome of Fraunce (as if he wolde haue put the sayd donation in execu∣tion) to haue ben / and to be subiecte to the churche of Rome. which thynge / as being leude & against right shortly after his successours Benedicte / and Clemēt / did rebuke. But what meaneth this your carefull di∣lygence / O you popes of Rome / Bened. 12 Clement pope. that you do requyre of euery emperour the confirmation of the sayde do∣nation of Constantine: but that you put diffydence and  in your ryght & tytle? But you labour
amples wherof we may fynde euery where. Neither it is ordayned by the lawe of nature / It is agaynst humanite and cōtrary to the nature of mā to exercyse vi¦olente rule o∣uer other of his owne hin¦de: that one people shuld subdue & make subiect another people to it self. We may coūsayle & teche / & exhort other men / but we may nat play ye lordes ouer thē / & do vyolēce to them: excepte we wyll renoūce & forsake all humanite / and coūterfayte & folow ye moste ferce & cruel bestes / whi∣che done exercyse a cruell & a blody empier vpon the weaker beastes / & those which are of lesse might and strēgth. as the lyon / ouer four foted beastes / the egte ouer fowles of the ayer / & the Dolphyn ouer fyshes. But yet for all this / these afore rehersed beestes / do nat chalenge or vsurpe any power ouer the beestes of their owne kynde: but onely vpon those yt be of other lower kyndes / how moche more than ought we to do so: & one man to haue regarde & reuerence to another man / Mayster Fabius. seyng ye (as Maister Fabius sayd) there liueth none so wode a beest vpō erthe: but he dothe regarde his owne Image / & doth auoyde the hurtyng therof. There is therfore .iiii.Foure causes warrior war¦res are made moste commu¦nely. causes / wherfore most cōmēly warres & batayles are made / either it is for to reuēge iniuryes or wronges / & to defende our frendes / or els it is for feare of calamite / yt we shal receyue after war¦des: if the strēgth & might or power of other / were suf¦fred to growe & increse / or els it is for ye hope of praye / or els for the desire of glorye & renowne / of the which foure causes / the fyrst is somewhat honeste / the secōd but lytle honeste / the two last are in no wyfe honeste. And in very dede warres haue bene made oftētymes agaynst the Romayns. but after they had defended thēselues they made warre both vpō them & other ∣tions. Neither is there any nation or people / which hath geuē place / & bē obediēt to their dominiō: except they were vainqueshed and subdued by batayle / how well and how rightfully / or for what cause: auise thē selues / for I wyll nat neither condemne them / as if they haue tought wrongfully: neither assoyle or quite theym / as if they haue fought ryghtfullye. This onely I wyll saye: that by the same reason / and for the same cause / the Romayns made warre vpō other
nations: by whiche reason / and for the whiche cause / other kinges & peoples dyd. And that it was laufull for them / vpon whom warre was be gonne / and whi∣che were vaīquesshed or ouercome by bataile / to haue gone from the Romaynes / and to haue forsaken thē: euyn so as they had done from other lordes / whiche had subdued them. Left peraduenture (which thing no man wolde say) all the empiers might be brought agayne to those most aunciente lordes of the olde ty∣me: whiche were fyrst lordes / that is to saye / whiche first toke away other mines lādes and goodes. And yet is there better right to the people of Rome in the nations conquered by batayle: than is to the emper∣ours / oppressynge the cōmune weale. Wherfore if it was laufull for nations & peoples to shrinke or go a∣waye from Constātine / and (which is a gretter thīg) from the people of Rome: without any doute / it shal be laufull for them / to refuse and forsake him for their gouernour: to whom so euer Constātine hathe gyuē and released his right & tytle. And that I may speke more boldely / if it was laufull for the Romaynes / ei∣ther to depose or driue out Constātine / so as they did Tarquine? or els to kyll him / Tarquin the proude the la¦ste kynge of the Romains of Iulyus Ce¦sar. Rede sue¦tonius in the lyfe of hym. so as they dyd Iulius Cesar: moch more it shal be laufull for the Romaynes or the prouinces / to kyll him: whiche is succeded (so as it is) in to the roume / and stede of Constantyne. This thing / albeit that it is true: yet is it beyonde the bondes of my cause or mater. And therfore I wil refrayne and rule or measure my selfe. and I will in∣ferre or conclude none other thīg at this tyme of these thinges afore reherced: but only / that it is peuisshnes or madnesse / where the vyolence or force or armes is: there any man to allege or brīge in ye right or tytle of wordes (for ye same thīg which is gottē or wōnē wt warre: is also lost againe wt batayle) & that by so mo∣che the more / seing that other straunge nations (as we haue herde say of ye gothes) whiche were neuer vn¦der thempier of Rome: haue wonne Italy / and many prouīces / and entred vpō them / driuyng out the olde inhabytaūtes / which now to be called agayne into ye
seruitude / ī which they were neuer before: what right or equyte (I beseche you) is it: namely these natyōs which haue cōquered into the seruytude of them / per∣aduēture: which haue ben cōquered? At which tyme if any cyties & nations (as we knowe it to haue ben done in very dede) beyng destituted & forsaken of the emperour of Rome: were cōstrayned / at the cōmyng of the Barbarous pope / of necsyte / to chuse a king to thē selues / vnder whose gouernaūce they haue go∣ten the vyctory: shulde they afterwardes depose him from his kīgedome? or shulde they be wyllīg & desyer to haue his sonnes lyue priuate / without any rule or auctorite (which are worthy to be fauoured / both for their fathers sake / & also for their own vertue & man∣lynes) that their selues might be agayne vnder ye em∣perour of Rome? namely whan their selues shulde cōtynually nede the labour & dilygence of them: and shulde nat hope to haue helpe or ayde frō any where els? If Cesar him self / or Constātine / if he were aly∣ue agayne / or also the senate and the people of Rome wolde call the mater to the cōmune iugemēt / such as was some tyme the iugemente of the Amphictions in Grece lande:Rede the pro¦uerbe Amphi¦ctiones. he shulde be put backe / & cast forthwith at the fyrst action: For that he dyd demaūde & clayme agayne in to the seruyce & bondage / those men whom he being their gouernoure / had forsaken long syns / and which had lyued so longe season vnder another prīce & gouernour / and which neuer had ben subiect / to a kinge of another coūtrey / & which fynally were men borne to lybertie / & which were restored in to ly∣bertie / by the strēgth & valyaūtnes bothe of mynde & body. So that it may cuydētly appere / if Cesar / if the people of Rome / be excluded frō claymīg them a∣gayne in to subiectiōs & seruytude: moch more than the pope is excluded frō making suche clayme. And if it be laufull for other nations / which were vnder Ro¦me / either to create & make a kinge ouer them selues or to kepe & holde a cōmune welth: moche more it is laufull for the people of Rome to do the same thing / namely & agaīst ye new & straūg tyrāny of ye pope.
¶ The fyth prīcipall parte & the last of this worke /  whiche it is shewed / yt the pope can nat make any p̄∣scription n those thīges which he possesseth: howe so ouer longe tyme he hath had them in his possessyon. BIcause our aduersaryes are nowe excluded frō defēdyng of the donation of Constātine / in as moche as there was neuer any suche donation made / and though there hadde ben / it shulde nowe haue ben deade / through the condition and state of tymes: they do runne to another kynde of defence / & as you wolde say / forsakyng the cyte: they gette them selues into a castell or fortelage / which forthwith they shall be cō∣pelled to yelde vp: bycause their vytayles shall fayle them.Prescription is / whan any mā hath had possession of house or lan∣des so longe tyme as any man alyue cā remembre as by the space of an. c. yeres or more: The church of Rome (they saye) hathe made prescription in those thīges: which it possesseth. Why doth than the sayde churche requyre & clayme againe those thynges (which is the greater parte) in whiche it selfe hathe nat made prescription / & in which other men hath prescribed? excepte it be nat laufull for o∣ther men / to do the same thynge to the pope: whiche it is laufull for him / to do to other men. The churche of Rome (you say) hath prescrybed. Why dothe she than gyue so greatly care and dilygence / to haue her ryght & tytle to ofte cōfirmed of the emperours? why doth the sayde church than bost the donation / and the confirmation of the emperours: if this thynge alone (that is to wit / prescription) were suffycient? Thou doest iniury to it: if thou doest nat kepe sylence of the other ryght or tytle also. Why doest thou nat than ke¦pe sylence of the one? Verely / bycause this alone is nat suffyciēt.Malae fi∣dei posses¦sio. Stulfae fi¦dei posses¦sio. Ignoran¦tia facti. Thou sayest ye church of Rome hath p̄∣scribed. How can ye church of Rōe haue made p̄scrip∣tion: wher ther is none euydēce or certētie of any rizyogh;t title / but onely a false & vniust possession / or els if thou dost deny yt it is a vniust possession and of yuell faith / forsoth you can nat deny it to haue ben a possession of folisshe faith or credēce. Ought the ignorāce / as they cal it: Facti et iuris to be holden excused ī so gret a ma¦ter: & so open & manyfest / ye ignorāce of ye dede / I call
nat to knowe that Constātyne dyd neuer gyue Rome & the prouynces / wherof to be ignoraūte: s a poynt of an idyate or vnlerned man / & nat of a pope. Ig∣noraunce of the right / Ignoran¦tia Iuris I meane / nat to knowe that those thīges coulde neither be gyuen of the one parte: neither b receyued of the other parte / wherof to be ignoraunte is a poynt of him that is scarsely a Chri∣sten man. Shall than the folysshe credulyte or lyght¦nes of gyueng credence / cause the to haue right and tytle in those thinges: which / if thou haddest ben wi¦ser / shulde neuer haue ben thyne? What? Shalte thou nat nowe at the least wyse lose that right & tytle (if thou haddest any at al) seing that I haue declared so playnly / that it was longe of ignoraunce & folyssh∣nesse: that thou dyddest possesse them? And that thīg whiche ignoraunce leudly and wrongfully hath gyuē to the: shall nat knowledge well and rightfully take agayn ye same a way frō the? And shall nat the bonde man or prentyce retourne agayne from the uniust lor∣de / to the right maister? ye peraduenture euyn with the frute and profyte whiche thou hast taken / by the occupyeng and vsyng of him? For if thou doest con∣tynue & holde on to possesse them yet styll: now thyne ignoraunce is tourned into malyce & fraude or gyle / and thou arte playnly and vtterly made (as they call it in latyne tonge) Malae fidei possessor / that is to say / a possessor of euyll faith / in as moch as thou kno∣west yt he had no right to gyue those thynges / which thou possessest: of whom thou dyddest receyue them. you dyd say / that ye church of Rome hath prescribed. Nota.O vnlerned foles / O you ignoraunt persons & vn∣skylled of goddes lawe. No nombre of yeres / be it neuer so great: can abolysshe or wipe away the true and iust tytle. In cause it were so / that I had ben ta∣ken prisoner of the Barbarions / and had ben suppo∣sed verely to haue ben deed / if now after an hundreth yeres in which I had ben prisoner / I dyd retourne agayne in to myne owne countrey: shall I be exclu∣ded therfore from claymyng and makyng tytle to the inherytaunce / which my father hathe lefte me? what
thinge can be more cruell / and more cōtrary to all hu∣manite: than this? And to brynge you some example. Whan the chyldrē or sōnes of Ammon / dyd requyre and clayme agayne the lande / from the costes or bor¦ders of Arnon euyn vnto Iabue / and vnto the ryuer Iordane: dyd Iepthe the captayne of Israell make answere in this wyse to them. The israelytes haue prescribed now by the space of thre hūdred yeres? or dyd he shewe that the lāde which they claymed: had / neuer ben possessed of them / but of the Amorreanes? and that this was an euydente argument or profe / that the sayde lande dyd nat belonge to the Ammoni¦tes: seyng that within the cōpasse of so many yeres / they had neither claymed nor demaunded it agayne. The churche of Rome hathe prescrybed.Prescription is made only of dumbe & vnresonable thynges. Holde thy peace wicked & mischeuouse tonge. Thou doest tran∣slate prescryption / whiche is made onely of doumbe thinges and vnresonable: vnto man / whom by how moch the longer they haue possessed in seruytude and bondage: so moch the more detestable their possessiō is. Byrdes / and wylde beestes / wyll nat that any prescryptyon be made vpon them selues, but how so euer longe tyme they haue ben had in possessyon: yet whan they lyst / and occasyon shall be offred to them: they do go away. and shall it nat be laufull for a man of whom another man hath had the possessyon: lyke wyse to go away from him / as the birde or wylde best dothe? Herken nowe a thyng / wherby the fraude or gyle of popes / rather than the ignoraunce of theym may appere. which done vse to be tryed and iuged by warre and batayle: and nat by right and lawe.Popes wyll trye their ry∣ght by warre & nat by the lawe. And I suppose verily / that the fyrst popes in takyng pos∣sessyon / and entryng vpon the cyte of Rome / and the other townes / dyd in moch lyke maner faciō. A lytel before I was borne (I take recorde of them / whiche were presente and do remēbre it well ynough) Rome toke or receyued the empier rule / and gouernaūce / or rather the tyrāny of the pope / where long afore that tyme / it had ben free: by a straūge kynde of fraude or gyle / suche as hath nat ben herde of herafore. The
pope at the tyme of whom I do speke: was Boniface the nynth / The fraude & crafte of pope Boniface the ix. nat inferi¦our in wicked¦nes to Boni∣face the viii. pere & egall to Boniface ye eyght / in fraude & in name / if it be to that they are to be called Boni∣facii: that is to say good doers: Qui pessime faciūt / that is to saye / whiche are most euyll & shrode doers. And whan the Romayns / after yt they had perceyued the fraude & gyle / were angry in their myndes / & dis∣contente amōge them selues:Tarquin Boniface ye pope / after the maner of Tarquini{us} stroke of all the highest hed∣des of ye popies or chessebouls with a rodde or wāde so caused he the hedes of them to be stricken of / which were of most might & power. which thyng / whā In∣nocēcius / A propre & se∣mely acte for a pope to do. which succeded wolde haue counterfayted and folowed: he was driuen or chased out of the cyte. I wyll nat speke of other popes / Innocentius the vii. was driuen out of Rome. which haue alwaies holden Rome oppressed by vyolence & force of armes. Albeit / as ofte as it myght: it hathe alwayes rebel∣led / as syx yeres ago / whā it coulde nat optayn peace of Eugenius / neither the enemies had peace / whiche dyd besege it: it selfe also beseged ye pope within his owne house / Eugenius the iiii. of that na¦me was fame o digyse hī selfe in a mon¦kes coule / & so to saue the water of Ty¦bi / the Ro∣mayns sho∣g & o∣wyng stones after him. & wolde nat suffre him to go from thēce afore that either he dyd make peace with ye enemyes: or els wolde remitte and release the administration & gouernaūce of the Cytie to ye citizens / But he chose raither to forsake the cytie / disgysyng him selfe in the habite or wede of another man / & hauyng but one to wayte vpon him: than to do pleasure to the citizens / which desired nothynge of him / but suche thynges as were agreable to ryght & equite / which if they were put to free choyse: who doth not know / but that they wolde chose rather lybertie / than thraldome & bonda¦ge. It pleaseth me to deme & iuge the same of other ci∣ties: which be retayned and holden in seruitude of the pope / by whom they ought to haue ben deliuered frō thraldome. It were to longe a thyng to reherce howe many cities ye people of Rome hath made free: which they dyd wynne & take of their enemyes / Titus fla¦minius. in so moch that Titus Flaminius did bydde or wyll all Grecelā¦de which had ben in subiectiō vnder Antiochus: to be free / & to vse their owne lawes. But the pope / as we
may euydētly se) lyeth in wayte all ye euer he can: to begyle peoples / & to spoyle thē of their lyberty.The pope stu¦dieth as mo∣che as he can to brynge all men into bōn¦dage & thral∣dome. And therfore they lykewyse agayne of their parte / whan they haue occasyon offred: do rebell (take exāple her∣of euen nowe of Bonony) whiche if at any tyme / of their owne accorde / which thing is possyble ynough to haue chaūced) & with good wyll / they dyd cōsente to the papale empier / by the reason of some great ieo∣perdy yt was towardes them / & nere at hande from o∣ther outnations & people: it is nat yet so to be vnder∣stāded & taken / that they dyd cōsente to make thēsel∣ues bōdmen / so yt they myght neuer withdrawe their neckes from vnder the yoke / & so that they also: whi∣che shulde be borne afterwardes: shulde nat be at ly∣berty / neither haue any power ouer their owne selues for this were ouer moch agaynst right & reason.

Wolde god that I myghte ones (for there is no thynge / that I do more longe for) se it brought to passe / & that namely by my coūsayle: that the pope were only the vicare of Christ and nat also the vicare of the emperour / and that this horryble sayeng may be no more herde.

ONe thynge I can nat passe ouer with sylence: because it is the vndouted & assured sentēce / wel nere of all men / that Constātine thēperour dyd gyue for euer the empier of the weste / to Siluester pope of Rome / & to his successours / whiles the worlde shall contynue. And therfore / all though the reason & argu¦mēt of the vnite of the prīcypall regente & gouernour (which is / that it is agaynst ryght & good ordre / that there shuld be two hedes or prīcipal gouernours) did nat cōclude: yet neuer thelesse / it shulde be open & eui¦dent / that there can be none emperour ryghtfully in ye west: excepte he wolde aknowlege his empier to be
dependently of the pope. I haue serched out this rote as dilygently as I coulde / presupposing this thinge also to be vndouted and of surety: that Constantyne might haue made such gyfte or graunte / whiche que∣stion for al that / neither hath soyled hytherto: neither by all lykelyhode shall euer be solued. But in very trouthe I meruayle excedyngly / if that thynge be of trouth & matter in dede:The donatiō of Constanty¦ne is nat foū∣de ī any autē¦tical bokes or in any appro∣ued histories that it is nat foūde in auten∣ticall bokes / and in approued histories.
