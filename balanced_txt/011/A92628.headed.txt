THE Scotch Design discovered in their late subtile DECLARATJON: Laying open The Falshood and Deseit of their specious pretences therein. Together with the ground, rise, and progresse made, in this their present Treasonable Invasion of ENGLAND. Written by a diligent Observer of all Transactions in Scotland, to his Friends in England. And published to undeceive the people, seduced by their late Deceitfull DECLARATION. London, Printed by J. M.
Penrith the 14 day of July▪ 1648. Much honored and dear friend, BEing present here, by the providence of God, at the coming of a Gentleman, one Mr Helly∣burton, who is sent from that Malignant Com∣mittee of Estates, now sitting in Scotland, to the heart-greif of all the people of God there; he being thus far come on his way to the Parliament of England, and from the Malignant Scots Army, by the way, with many dangerous private Letters, and a de∣vilish subtil false Declaration, which we have read, and some Letters to the King; all which I thought good to acquaint you with: The deep designs that that Malignant Crew is aiming at through that Declara∣tion, which I find to be so full of subtil expressions, to get your Parliament to think that they are the men that they declare themselves to be in this Declaration, and their adherents according thereto in England, and by this means to make your Parliament to conde∣scend to their unhonest desires, that is, the disbanding of your honest Army, and so the power of England shall be in the Malignants hands: The King being
brought to his royal dignities again, presently they shall tread under foot all the people of God, be under what name they will, excepting Royalists, in all the three Kingdoms, and up with Epilcopacy: And this is for a certain their intentions, declare what they will. To assure you of this, my dear friend, I will shew some of the proceedings lately betwixt the State and the Kirk, before we came away, and their proceedings in the getting up of their Army, when all the Congre∣gations, Presbyteries, and Sessions, and Synods, and Shires had supplicated and publickly declared against their proceedings, with about threescore Members of Parliament declaring publickly against their procee∣dings; and most part of the Officers of the former standing Army having also deserred their places out of conscience, seeing the wicked course they were run∣ning; So that I may truly say, the whole Kingdom, that was always for the Covenant and Presbyterial Go∣vernment before, is now against this wicked course because the power is only put in those mens hands, both in Armies and Committees, that ever were a∣gainst the Covenant before, and against all Religion. The first thing that they went about, after the Parlia∣ment was risen, they divided their Forces, that they had standing, into all the well-affected places of the Kingdom. His Excellency Hamilton did first begin with his own Country, for that Country was most disaffected to him and his ways; he could not get up a man; he sent (to gain his point) so many Troops of Horse to force the men, but all could not prevail; the people were exceeding resolute, they entertained the
Troops as long as they had any thing, and at last left all; so that he hath destroyed all his own Country, Glascoe, which was the chief Town of his Country, the Town being wholy establisht with godly Magi∣strates, after the casting out of their Malignant Ma∣gistrates, in that time that Iames Graime F. os Montresse had over run the Land; he hath now cast out these godly men, and set up those Malignants that were cast out before, and did imprison and plunder all the godly Families in the Town, the Ministers themselves hard∣ly escaping the fury of the Souldiers, their houses plundered also: They came in to a godly woman, hearing that she feared God, and did threaten to kill her, if she would not swear that she did not fear God; this is of truth: These and such like are only the cheif men that are imployed in this ingagement willingly, albeit the most part be forced, poor creatures: Ano∣ther passage remarkable, to shew that these men minde not Presbyterial Government, nor no good to any that are not profest Royalists, and upon any termes for the King, in all the three Kingdomes; and to shew you the irreconcileable difference betwixt this MALIGNANT STATE that now is acting, the affairs of the civil power in Scotland and the Kirk, and the most part besides both of the nobility, Gentry and Comminalty: The passage was this, the Commissi∣oners of the Kirk did make an Act, That whatsoever Minister should be found not to preach against the proceedings of that ingagement, and should be found to go into England with that Army, should be depo∣sed from the Ministry: the Parliament hereing of it,
did make a contrary Act in their first Declaration; also they did declare, That their coming to England was against Malignants, as wel on the one side, as Se∣ctaries on the other side. The Commissioners of the Kirk set forth a contrary, proving, that they were joyn∣ed with Malignants in England, both in the South parts and North parts, and that the English Malig∣nants did nothing without order from particular Ma∣lignant Statesmen in Scotland; all which truths do now plainly appear, we hope, to the open view of the world, so that I may perswade you, and I could wish that ye would use means to perswade all others of the truth of these things, and that they may not be deluded with that Declaration, which we know is come out in secret, without the knowledg of the wel-affected par∣ty in that Kingdom, otherwise it would have had a contrary Declaration from them, proving theirs to be false in every circumstance. Dear friend, the reason I am so large in these parti∣culars is this, knowing that the well-affected party in Scotland do not get their Letters conveyed to you, for fear of intercepting, which some are suffering for at this time. And my next reason & motive, that moves me, is this; I know that you are a man that are acquainted with many Parl. Members with you, that ye may bestir your self a little to make known these things, and to spread them abroad for the undeceiving of many thousands, both in London and up and down this Kingdom, who, I know, do appear with them, thinking that they are for the prosecuting of the ends of the Covenant,
and establishing of Presbyterial Government, and the bringing of the King to his Throne upon good condi∣tions; but they will be infinitely deceived, think so who will: These indeed were the ends that the well∣affected party would have had an Army up for; but Malignants bearing down, being expressed, did cause the Malignants to thrust in themselves under this co∣vert, and they have played their parts very subtilly; but God hath made their designs to shine through their covert, to their great shames and silence. I pray you acquaint our friends with these things, for I know we have some in the City Councel, and may do much good; there is much lying upon your Parliament, the Lord make them see about them; and we have reason to mourn for the divisions of the people of God, and for the want of a right understand∣ing betwixt them in both Kingdoms, be under what name soever. I wish there were a Union endevoured quickly, for all the wicked are combined together to root out all that bear the Image of God in them, in their profession; these are the main designs these old Malignants aim at; the old quarrel is the quarrel still, both against Independents and Presbyterians, un∣der what name soever, that shall not be found to be al∣together for the King upon any terms. Not troubling you any further; I shall rest here, laying this over up∣on you, that you wil not fail to bestir your self in these things, to your power in the strength of God, who is your strength, and the strength of him, who is Your affectionate Friend in the LORD R. S.
I pray you enquire for an honest Gentleman, Lieu∣tenant Collonel William O sbourne, who is come along to the Parliament by the order of the General Major Lambert, with the Papers and Declarations of that Malignant Committee in Scotland, he will shew you of all things to your satisfaction, for he came with us from Scotland, make him acquainted with some of your Parliament Members, that he may im∣part what he knoweth of affairs, both in this Kingdom and in Scotland. Imprimatur Gilb. Mabbot. July 24. 1648. FINIS.
