THE SCOUT OF COCKENY. NEptune being puffed up with the flat∣terers of the Greek and Latine Scrib∣lers that skirts the Hadriatick and Me∣diterian Sea, had the vanity to swag∣ger in the Ocean, and range about strange Coasts to increase the number of his Poetical Parasits, so with his Fish Knight Errantry, he rushed through the Straits, and turned his snout towards the North, where in half a dayes swiming he reached the Coast of Portugal, without any mischance, except a slender crack in his Lerbord Finn that he got as he passed by the Birling Islands; This did not at all startle him from his Course to the Artick Pole, but most jocundly held on till he came to the Bay of Biscay, where indeed his God∣ship was discovered to be Mortall; for the billowing of these Waves set his watery Stomack a tottering,
and if there had not been a quack in the Navy that com∣forted him with one of Buchursts Pectorall Loranges, he was fair to have gasped his last, with great difficulty he rolled through that raging Gulffe, and no sooner came into smoother Water, but he prickt up his Ears, streacht his Crist, brandished his Triton with as dreadfull and huffing an Aspect as the Ale-house Hectors will tosse notched Belboes in presence of their Countrey Kindred; in this posture and rate he sneered away, seeeking for the mouth of the Channell, when straight he was dis∣covered by a Welch Man of War, who no sooner came within distance, but our bold Brittish Gallyfoyst con∣ceived by his snotty Beard, that he was a Hollander come from Malago, drunk with Peettersemin, and to chastise his intemperance, because it was not done with Metheglin, he immediately from his Fore castle snuffed a cast of Culverins, which did so smite the aquatick Monster upon the weather Jaw, that he was forced to turn his Tail to that thundering Storm, and by a great Fat which was their appointed signe of Retreat, he and the rest of his Briny Mirmidons run towards the Coast of France, where it was the Fortune of his Vice Admiral, that was a Fidler of Flushing mounted on a Mar-maid to spend his Bowspreet upon the Cardinal Islands, and if happly Monsiur de Fonquets Gallies of Bell-Isle had not come to his rescue, the Flegmatick Rodomontado had lost that Musick which makes the Burgamasters An∣nakies of Amsterdam yawn after Rope Dauncers. From Sunny-side. ONe of our Philosophers Wives according to the cu∣stome of the Coast-side Gossips, last night skim∣mered
away to Bourdeux to swill of the new Wine, upon her return she touched at Goree where Opdam lies; she reports that at her being there, one Doctor Abraham Kesse wrought a speedy Cure on Opdam, both as to his Gout and Flux, the one he stopped with a new disco∣vered Cheese made of Geese Milk, the other he disolved with a Cataplasm composed of Fish Guts: But the Phy∣sitian had but a slender reward for not prolonging the Cure, there being now no shift left to shelter his shame∣fastnesse at Sea: In the mean time, this cloven Mercury hath brought a shrewd jealousie upon her self, for ma∣king all that Voyage in 24. hours, and it's without all peradventure to be expected the first Oyster Boat that's cast away, but her Winding-sheet will be converted into a Tar Barrell, else the world is much mistaken of the discretion of their Justice of Peace. From Lochquaber. THere is a Norway Adventurer come here to Inner∣lochy loadened with Figs and Frontiniack, and which is strange, of the Countreys natural growth, and all this is produced from the industry of their Accade∣micks; the place that yeelds these Fruits is the valeys of Stravangle, and they say they cultivat the ground with no other dung but that of Solin Geese, and Italian Becca Ficki, which by a wonderfull Artifice, a little mixed with a Charme they bring upon the place, and very orderly each first Munday of the Month they squat according to their Tribes in the parts appointed by the Surveyer of the Plantation.
From Tinto-tope. THe Deputies appointed by the Mineral Committee of Virtuosi in this place are returned from Braids Craigs, and Bennichi, they have found as much Gold in the one as will make a Pick-tooth to the King of Fairy, and as much Silver in the other as will make a Thimble to his Queen; they were very painful in their sinking search, and they conclude by many pregnant symptomes that there is both Gold and Silver, but before they can arrive at the right Vain, they must dig within 13. Inches of the Antipods, which will scarcely be enterpized, unlesse persons of publick Spirits will advance money to defray the expense of Materials. Buck-haven. ONe of our second rate Adventurers is safely arrived from the Straits, most part of her Loadening is of the new sort of Hooks made of Venice Glasse, except some Furres for lynning our Aldermens Bulfangers. All the Newes that was Currant on the Realto at Venice, was a great report of a Water Combat twixt the Bottle Beer Barge above London Bridge and the Bucentaure; If it be upon a Shrove Tuesday about four in the eve∣ning, and the Thames bottome manned by Prentises,
and Governed by Dray-men, the Magnificoes and Pan∣tolonies will be at a damned losse, and they will sooner make Bowling-greens of the Dardanelloes than gain any thing by that Bargain. From Prestoun-Pans. YOu have here an Extract of a Letter from our Oy∣ster Consul at Zurex Sea, viz. that after the Hoggin∣Moggin had sleept sufficiently after a plentifull Carrouse, their prudentials led them to this Cautious result (that their Navy till the Summer shall be disposed into several Harbours, but such places as are in a capacity to Steel their white Livered soules with Aqua-Fortis and Gun∣Pouder, in order to which Reer Admiral Bublikins is come to this place, his Squadron are as followeth; The Pontius Pilate of Amsterdam, the Simon Magus of Dort, the Soutterkin of Skeulin, the Mareswin of Middel∣burgh, the Flunder of Flushing, the Cabaleu of Camphire, the Haddock of Harlem, the Lobster of Leydan, the Go∣liah of Gorkum, the Whale of Workum, the Buttered Eggs of Egmont, the Salt Eale of Enchusen, the Punck of Putta, the Skaite of Skeedam, the Oyster of Oyster-Capell, the Whyttin of Wester-Capell, the Mackerell of Masten∣sleuse, the Geck of Gorre, the Grains of Brewers Haven, the Stock-Fish of Halvert Sluce, the Bread and Cheese of Beverweek, the Butter of Bonkes-slote, the Haire-groat of Horne, the Beens and Bacon of Broad-wood. A fire Ship called the Brandy of the Brill, two Pinks, the Elder and Younger Cutts built of Rotterdam and
Skarlaw; this is the true number of Bublikins Fleet, his Historingrapher who is a redoubted Classick Poet in Holland, under the name of Iacob-Vander-Hogge, gave the names to all this Spungy Gallantry, for which he was rewarded with two Barrels of pickled Herring to entertain his Wife who was a Cast-away Bloom-berry Hackney; yet the Jade has turned so fruitfull there, that she frequently brings forth Litters of Souterkins. Its much to be feared that the heat of an English Broad∣side will make this wretched Generation of pickled Pil∣chers dissolve like Anchoves upon a Choffin-dish. Killimure. THe Provests Daughter of this place hath been la∣bouring this two years of a most consuming Green-sicknesse, but now She is most miraculously cu∣red by the Pyper of Clovo; for with half a dozen of Bends of a drink stoured upon Straw, he hath restored Her both to Stomack and Complexion: This same Instru∣mentall Virtuoso is largely as well known in the Ma∣thematicks, as in Medicine; for with the Drone of his Pype, he makes greater discoveries in the Moon, then Sir Sydrafall doth with his Telescope: for those who tryed it, saith, they not only discover Hills, Woods, and Rivers, but Towns and Castles, and those forti∣fied in the Modish manner, with Bastions Ravellings, half Moons, Counterscarps, and Hornworks, and Steeples with Sun-Dials: Al Italiano in point of Physick, he operateth much by Glisters without any other convey∣ance but his Towl.
Advertisements. THere is strayed out of Inch-keeth a Turky Cock thir∣ty Inches high with Vervails of Purc-leen, bearing the Armes of Prester Iohn; who ever brings notice to Iohn Purdie Oyster Dregger in Rotton-raw, shall have three skelps with a Skait Rump till he skyt Dumplings like green Geese in May.

If any person be so foolish as to think there is nothing contained in this Gazet, or so serious, that there's something he may be mistaken in both; however, if any can find out the right Key, our Worshipfull Senat of Cockeney does promise to recommend him as a quali∣fied Wit, to be AEnigmatical Professor in any of the new established Seminaries for strange Discoveries.
