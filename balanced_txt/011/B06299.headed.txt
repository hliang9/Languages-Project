A CHARACTER OF CHARLES THE SECOND. IF the Naturalists pretend to give a reason why the Son of Croesus, who had been dumb from his Infancy, seeing a Souldier ready to kill his Father, cryed out, It is the KING! The force of Naturall affection breaking those strings, which, until that moment, had tyed his tongue: Who will wonder that a man, who on the busie Theater of his Coun∣trey, hath hither to presented the Person of a Mute, should violate his resolutions of continuing silent, when he sees the cursing Shimei's of this depraved Nation, going to murther the good fame of his Master, his Soveraign, and the common Father of the people? Therefore since my zeal to Truth, my veneration for Gods Anointed, and my ten∣dernesse for my Countrey hath loosen'd my Tongue, I have taken the boldnesse to informe the deluded People
what manner of Man he is, against whom these Serpents have spit their Venome. And who may pretend to be better heard, or more be∣lieved, then a Person who hath past eighteen Years of his Time, in the Service and Court of this Illustrious PRINCE? And who dares challenge the World to finde in the whole processe of his Life, one instance of the least deflexion from the severest rules of sincerity; which yet he does not vain∣ly urge to enhaunse his Reputation, but to strengthen his evidence, humbly acknowledging, that he does not owe this steddinesse to the complexion of his spirit, but to the goodnesse of Almighty God, who resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. But before I begin to trace the first Lines of this Piece, I conceive it very necessary to discover these Incidents, which have conspired to abuse the Judgements of many dis∣interessed, well-meaning persons, who were otherwise suf∣ficiently fortified against the practises of notorious Enemies. So great have been the distresses of his MAJESTY, since he hath been exil'd from His Kingdomes, that he could not possibly support those many Retainers to his Court and Cause, which have been involv'd in the common Fate of his Party; and it is so natural for all men to overvalue their own merits, that they think themselves very much injur'd, if they are not admitted to equal shares with the rest of their fellow Servants, though far more eminent for their services past, and better fitted for present employments; so that neither his MAJESTIES insuperable necessities, nor the disparity of their deserts could hinder these presumptu∣ous persons, from murmuring at his Ministers, whilst they were abroad, and blasting of his personal vertues when they returned home, and many of these unworthy men, having been honour'd either with some Domestick relation to his MAJESTY, or at least, with free accesse to his Court, had such pretences to be credited in all their reports, that whilst the KING was not known to the People, who are
ever inclin'd to believe the worst, they easily perverted the candour of their opinions, either by wounding the Judge∣ment of his MAJESTY in the choice of his Ministers, or profaning his Character by most impudent slanders, especi∣ally, during the Tyranny of the late Protector, and the vile Instruments of his ambition, who having murthered the Fa∣ther, and seized the Inheritance of the Son, knew that there were no better means to preserve their possessions, then by recriminating the Person of the Lawfull Pretender; and therefore they were so prodigall of their rewards to these That unhappy wretch Man∣ning (when he was a prisoner at Colen) confessed that his Salary from the Pro∣tector was 100. l. a Month. Apostates, that in the vast Profusion of the publick Treasure of the Kingdom, the Salaries of these Villains will be found one of the most costly Items. 'Tis true, the Persons and Practises of many of these gracelesse men were a long time since very particularly known, but such hath been the iniqui∣ty of the Times, that men might perpetrate the blackest Crimes with more security, then impeach a Criminal: and who then could expect that there should be found any Mar∣tyrs for the Truth, when it was become a Principle in their Religion to abet the present Power, which is, To lye for their Interest. So that at my return into England, after Eleven years absence, truely I was astonished to finde that this Poy∣son was not more diffused, considering the activity of the Deceivers, and the slavish remissness of those who should have generously opposed them. But it hath pleased Almighty God marvelously to preserve his Majesties good Name, against the malice of those wicked men, who went about to slander the foot-steps of his Anointed. And now finding a dawning of Liberty to assert the Truth, I am bold to expose his Picture to the publick view, whose Person will hereafter (when his Luster shall break through the Clouds of his misfortunes) prove the Delight of our Eyes. Though Plato hath made the Soul to be the definition of man, allowing the Body to be only the Carriage of the Spirit, yet since we receive our Information of Corporeal Subjects,
as well from our Sense as our understanding, I think it very proper to describe his Majesties Person as well as his Qua∣lities. He is somewhat Taller then the middle stature of English men; so exactly form'd, that the most curious Eye cannot find one Error in his shape. His Face is rather Grave then Severe, which is very much softned whensoever he speaks: His Complexion is somewhat dark, but much enlightened by his Eyes, which are Quick and Sparkling. Until he was near twenty years of Age, the figure of his Face was very Lovely; but he is since grown Leaner, and now the Majesty of his Counnenance supplies the Lines of Beauty. His Hair, which he hath in great plenty, is of a shining black, not frizled, but so Naturally Curling into great Rings, that it is a very comely Ornament. His Motions are so easie and gracefull, that they do very much recommend his person when he ei∣ther Walks, Dances, playes at Pal Maille, at Tennis, or rides the great Horse, which are his usual Exercises, In summe, his Meene does denote his Quality; and wheresoever he ap∣pears, he easily obtains the respect and affections of all that approach him; To the gracefulnesse of his deportment, may be joyn'd his easinesse of accesse, his Patience in Attention, and the Gentleness both in the tone and style of his speech; so that those, whom either the veneration for his dignity, or the Majesty of his presence have put into an awful respect, are re-assur'd assoon as he enters into conversation; and this I have often heard observ'd by many persons of quality of several Nations, especially by the French, who are naturally more serene and jovial, then the people of these Northern Countreys, who at first approach'd him with some constraint, until his MAJESTY was better known to them; but to deal ingenuosly, these advantages were not born with him, for he was too reserv'd in his youth, but he owes these (with many other excellencies) to his misfortunes, which forcing him to communicate himself to all sorts of people of the several Nations where he hath sojourn'd, have cultivated
his manners, and render'd his perfections habitual. Amongst his acquainted endowments these are the most eminent, He understands Spanish, and Italian; speaks and writes French correctly; He is well vers'd in ancient and modern History, hath read divers of the choicest Pieces of the Politick, hath studied some useful parts of the Mathe∣maticks, as Fortification, and the knowledge of the Globe; but his chief delight is in Navigation, to which his Genius doth so incline him, that by his frequent conversation with Mariners, and his own observation, whilest he rid six weeks in the Downes, and in his passage into Scotland, he hath ar∣rived to so much knowledge in this Science, that I have heard many expert Seamen (whose discourses are not steer'd by the compasse of the Court) speak of it with delight and wonder; in general, He is a true friend to Literature, and to Learned Men. But I conceive my self obliged to be more particular in my discourse upon his Natural qualities, because they import the well or ill-being of all those who are under his Dominion; for though his outward Accomplishments may sufficiently recommend him to disinteressed strangers, yet they are only his genuino Vertues, which can render him agreeable to his own Subjects; amongst which I will assigne the first place to his Understanding, since without this, the rest of his Vertues will have little signification to∣wards the happinesse of his People; for if he wanted that, it were more to the purpose to describe his Ministers then his MAJESTY; and 'tis they would have the dominion over the People, whilest he repre∣sented only the sign of a King: But I dare assure the Nation that this will not be our case, for his MA∣JESTY hath not only a solid Judgement, which (if the method of this discourse would permit) I could evince by many pregnant instances, as well as by the universall concession of all the judicious men that know him: but he is so well, yet so modestly periwaded of it,
that he dares trust himself, and is not capable of being carryed about with every Wind of Counsel; so that it will prove to be as truly said of his MAJESTY, as of his Grand-father, Henry the fourth, He that would corrupt his Councill, must first begin with the King: And when his Subjects shall consider the advantages of his Edu∣cation, the different Nations and Factions that he hath had to deal with, the direct opposition of his Enemies, and the treachery of his seeming Friends, the necessity of his treating with several Parties in Person, (because they would not trust those who were about him) the Variety and Force of his Experience, from the distinct knowledge of the Natures of the People of several Coun∣treys, of their chief Ministers of State, with the In∣trigues of Government, both in their Churches and Common-wealths, which other Princes have not had the opportunity, or mis-fortune to discover, and all these Lessons derived from their natural Springs, and learn'd in that excellent School of Adversity, which opens the Understanding, and confirms the Judgement; when these particulars are well considered, I believe, I shall not be put upon my Oath to prove this Article. Though the Sagacity of his Spirit may be of great ad∣vantage to himself or Friends, yet it will have no comfort∣able influence upon his Subjects in general, unlesse it be also accompanied with Justice, and therefore this is the vertue which is next to be considered. If Justice be well defin'd by the Moralists to be, The con∣stant Will of giving to every man his due; then may I safely pronounce his Majesty to be a Just person. And though I have met with some reports which seem to impugne this As∣sertion, yet upon due examination of them, I am the more confirmed in this Character: For though the defection of some of the Royal Party hath given his Majesty general grounds of suspition, yet there is no man more averse then himself to entertain an ill opinion of any person, of whose honesty he
hath had experience. But it hath been his fortune (as what Prince or private person can avoid it) to have had some absent persons of Merit and Integrity misrepresented to him by such subtile Arts, as humane wit could not at the present find out the falshood. Some of these innocent suffer∣ers, either from the confidence of their own Sincerity, or possibly, from their indifferency for his Majesties good Opi∣nion (he not being in a condition either to reward or pu∣nish) have neglected their defence, and lain for some time under his displeasure; but as soon as he once discovered the abuse (though without their applications) he hath not only made them very Honourable reparations, but marked the Informers with a publick Character of Infamy: And of this particular I have so distinct a knowledge, that I do as confidently believe he is Just, as that he is a Man. These generous Qualities are actuated by the Magnani∣mity of his mind, expressed in his Fortitude and Courage, which I may best compare to one another; for his Majesty hath shewed as great Courage in his attempts, to recover his just rights, as Fortitude in his submission to Providence, in the decision of the Battel against him; and yet there have been some Infectious breaths, who have endeavoured to blast his just Reputation; but he hath so singnaliz'd his Courage wheresoever he appear'd, that even his inveterate Enemy Cromwel himself, could not refuse him his just praises, though it was not his custome to give his Enemies their due honour, or to tell a truth, that might redound to his prejudice: But as this Character is not doubted by his Frieds abroad, so I wish that it may never be known by experience to his enemies at home. But that they may not be alarm'd by this last Period; I do assure them, that Clemency is as natural to his Majesty, as Courage: which is a Proposition that proves it self; for there is no man truly valiant, that can be cruel; and it were to degrade himself, not to pardon Injuries; for in
taking revenge, a man is but even with his Enemy: but in passing it over, he is become his Superiour. These are general notions which I must apply to their particulars whom it may concern: His Majesties genuine Clemency is confirm'd by his veneration for his Fathers memory, who left him his commands to pardon his Enemies (even those Enemies, who mingled their hands in his innocent blood) as his last Legacy; and I do know, that he is convinced, that it is his interest to forgive those that have oppos'd him, if they produce any seasonable Testimonies of their return and good intentions towards him; knowing that the de∣spairs of his Enemies may produce cruel effects to his Friends: and he desires to make his accesse to his Throne as innocent, and as certain as he can; and therefore as the common Father of his People, he endeavours that we should reconcile and embrace like Brethren; and concludes, That the best means to restore the crazie Body of the King∣dom to its former health and vigour, is not to cure one part, by afflicting of the other; but to heal those wounds which are already festred by their proper lenitives, and to remove (as much as lies in his power) all the causes of future Animosities; and this (to the best of my remem∣brance) is the substance of a discourse, which I have lately heard from his Majesties own Mouth upon this Subject. But his Majesties natural Clemency may possibly want the desirable Effects towards penitent Offenders, if he be not possest of a Religious fidelity of performing his Promise, and a Constancy of Resolution: If at least the ill advised passion of the parties that have sufferd should ever incline them to importune him for their revenge, under the Stile of Justice: To this I reply, That Perfidiousnesse and Irre∣solution are so directly opposite to those Qualities which I have already enumerated in his Majesties Character, that they are altogether inconsistent; and if he should have the least inclination to Hypocrisie, that which I have hitherto
said of him cannot be true; but he knows very well that the reputation of Faithfulnesse is one of the chiefest Pillars of Regall Power; and that even his Friends may reason∣ably suspect the performance of his promises to them, if he breaks his Faith to his Enemies. But to be more particular, I have often heard his Ma∣jesty declaime against the perfidious practices, which he had observed in the Negotiations of some Publick Ministers abroad; and Men do not use to declare an open War against those Vices, to which themselves are obnoxious; and I could name some Persons, whom he is pleased to honour with a particular esteem, that have no other conspicuous Virtue besides their impregnable Honesty; for there is no∣thing in Nature more productive of friendship, then some resemblance in manners: But the narrownesse of his For∣tune not suffering him to supply some empty men, as pro∣fusely, as they had promis'd themselves; they have branded his Majesty with Ingratitude, and Unfaithfulnesse, Sins which he abhors both from his Nature and Judgement. A man that is only Innocent, and not actively Vertuous, is so near to imperfection and weaknesse, that it is heard to distinguish their confines; and if it be granted that his Ma∣jesty does possesse these Illustrious Qualities, yet if he wants the Nature to produce them by practice, they may serve his Flatterers for Panegyricks, but they will be of little benefit to his People; therefore it is necessary to evince his Industry, to confirm the Charracter of an accom∣plish'd Prince. There was for a long time so dead a Calm in his businesse, his Enemies being so strong at home, and his Friends so engaged abroad, that he could not make one notorious pru∣dent step towards his recovery, which his cautelous Ene∣mies have represented to the undiscerning People under the reproach of Lazinesse. But the best of it is, he hath had an Army of his own Subjects for the Witnesses as well of
his Industry as Courage: And if these uningenuous cen∣surers had been of his Train the last Year, when his Majesty rid Post above two hundred Leagues through France and part of Spain, in the heat of Summer, I perswade my self they would have confessed their own wearinesse, though possibly they had denied his Diligence: And he spares his Mind as ltitle as his Body, for besides his conversation with Books, he consults and instructs all men that addresse to him in his businesse and amongst his Correspondents (which are not few) it may be there will scare be found One to whom he owes a Letter. Amongst the Moral Vertues there are some which have not such glorious Names as these which I have already men∣tioned; but I think they are very considerable, because they are more diffus'd into the ordinary Actions of our lives. In this number I reckon Temperance in Speech, wherein his Majesty so excels, that I have often thought of it with ad∣miration; for though I have sometimes seen him very just∣ly angry, yet the hardest expression that I have ever heard him use to a Gentleman, was once, and but once, when he told one of his domesticks, That he was an Insolent fellow: And though the Author of A late Letter from a near At∣tendant on his Majesty, dated from Brussels, and written at London, may possibly be displeased with this contradiction, yet out of my respect to Truth, I am bold to affirm, That to the best of my remembrance, I never heard his Majesty swear an Oath in my life: But it is well known out of what Quiver these poysoned Arrows come, which being shot against the impenetrable Buckler of his Innocency, will re∣bound upon the faces of those wicked men that did first le∣vel them. To this may be joyn'd his Sobriety in Diet, in which he seldome makes the least excesse, though he stands not in awe of his Constitution; for he is of so healthful a Tempera∣ment, that I have not known him above thrice sick these
eighteen Years: But he so Naturally hates Debauchery, that his severity to this vice hath cured some habitual drun∣kards, who have chosen rather to part with their beloved sins, then with his Majesties Favour. Though I can neither impugne nor defend the constant austerity of his Majesties life, since it is possible that in the heats of his Youth he may have rendred to the powerful charms of Beauty; yet I am certain that for many years he hath been so Chast and Cautious, that I have not heard the least whisper of any indecent Gallantry: And yet his impu∣dent Enemies have not only reproached him with habitual Incontinence, and farc'd their slanders with false and frivolous tales, knowing that Fame, like water, bears up light things and swallows the heavy; but they have suborned their Mercenary Prophets to denounce Gods Judgements against him, for these supposed Frailties, and to infer with as ill Morality as Logick, That his Majesty is unfit for Govern∣ment, because that in his Youth he may not have been stronger then Samson, wiser then Solomon, or more holy then David. But whosoever will impartially consider his just Character, and compare him either with the Ancient and modern Princes of the World: will hardly find a prece∣dent where so many shining qualities are assembled, or so little shadowed with any inclinations to vice: and if solid Vertue and Abilities for Government were a just title to Dominion, the Brutish Ocean would not be the confines of his Empire. These Excellent Qualities are the products of a happy Nature, or a generous Education, but as the soul informs the body, so it is Religion which animates the Character of Christian Princes, and crowns their moral perfections, and therefore as the most eminent, I have reserv'd that to finish this Piece. For his interiour Piety, I leave it to the Searcher of thoughts, in whose hands are the hearts of Kings; for to
us, the Tree is only known by the fruits; neither will I ex∣tend my self upon the discourse of his Humility, Meeknesse, Charity, and other divine Graces, since these produce the same effects (though more rais'd, because they are deriv'd from a higher Cause, for Christian Religion is only reason sub∣lim'd) which I have already treated under other names; and they are fitter for the Pens of those who have entrance into the Sanctuary, then for a secular Person; therefore I shall only insist upon his Majesties firmnesse to his Religion, as the most conducing to our purpose. And in this particular, he hath given such signal testimo∣nies to the world, that I wonder at the folly, as well as the malice of his Enemies, that have planted their Batteries against this point; but it is a Maxime deriv'd from the Fa∣ther of Lyes, To calumniate boldly, that something may re∣main, and the people are so susceptible of tales, that it is hard to invent a Fable which is above their Faith. His Majesty having passed ten years of his exile in the ter∣ritories of Catholick Princes, in France, Germany and Flan∣ders, it cannot be doubted that he hath been frequently importuned to change his Religion, either by those, who out of a firm perswasion of the verity of their own belief, have thought it a charity to make him a Convert; or those who from the presumption of their great abilities in Con∣troversie, have had the ambition to adde so illustrious a person to the number of their Proselytes, or those Politici∣ans, who (despairing of his re-establishment, unlesse by the assistance of Catholick Princes) have urged his conversion to the Roman Faith, as the best means to take the benevo∣lence of his Alleys: but they have all encountred such an immovable firmnesse in his Majesty to the Principles of his Religion, that they have retir'd from the assault with no other effects, then the satisfaction of having discharged their Consciences, by their officious Counsels. Amongst many other Champions of the Roman Church;
His Majesty was frequently attacqued (whilst he remained in France) by Monsieur de la Melitiere, a man of an excel∣lent spirit, who had been formerly a Calvinist, and by Mon∣sieur Salmonet originally a Scots-man, and favourite to the Cardinal de Retz, who have since printed and published the Arguments of their conference; and there is hardly any Roman Catholick of note for piety or Learning in any part of the World, where his Majesty hath been, that hath not joyned his Forces to combate him for his Religion. And shall he that hath passed so successefully through a ten years War in the defence of his Faith, be rob'd of his Triumph, and of his Highest Title, by the tongue or pen of a perjur'd Villain? We must then conclude, that Justice is fled to Heaven, and hath left us nothing here but her Bal∣lance, in which these wretched men do weigh their worldly Interests, against all the moral and divine Vertues; but Truth will be justified of her Children, and his Majesties perse∣verance in his Religion will be dear to the truely pious People of this Nation, when the faces of these slanders shall grow black with confusion. But his Majesties Fervour for his own way of Worship does not invade his Charity, to dissenting Christians: He is convinced by his Experience, as well as by his Reason, That Consciences are not to be forc'd, and that men may reaso∣nably suspect the truth of that Religion, which useth the Sword for her Argument; since it is as much against Reason as Charity, to persecute those who may be in the right, or if not, shall by this means be kept longer in the wrong; And therefore those tender Consciences, who worship God in the sincerity of their spirits, and do not dissent from their Brethren, to advance their humrne Interests, ought to joyn in their prayers to Almighty God, with the rest of the people; to place this Religious, Virtuous King in peace, upon the Throne of his Ancestors.
And if the Illustrious Birth of his Sacred MAJESTY, His Just Tittle to Dominion over us; warranted by the Laws of these Kingdoms, and marvelously asserted by the Providence of God; and who (besides his Acquir'd Per∣fections) is possest of Wisdom, Justice, Fortitude, Cou∣rage, Clemency, Faithfulnesse, Industry, Temperance, and Steddinesse in his Religion; If these Eminent Qualities may derive happinesse to his People, Then it is in our power to be happy, and He is bold to pronounce this to his Fellow-Subjects; Who is so far from betraying his Coun∣trey for his Prince, that he would not betray a private person, either for his Prince or Countrey. FINIS.
