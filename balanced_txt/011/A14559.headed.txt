lyued sobrely and in contynence / and after at ester had receyued theyr sauy∣our / After they disordred them in etyng in drynkyng / in playes and in lecherye A nd therfore our lord was meuyd ayenst them / and sente to them a grete pestelence / whiche was called the botche of impedymye / and that was cruell & sodayne / and caused peple to dye in go¦yng by the waye / in playeng / in beyng atte table / and in spekyng one with another sodeynly they deyed / In this ma¦nere somtyme fnesyng they deyed / so that whā ony persone was herd fnesyng anone they that were by said to hym / god helpe you / Or Cryst helpe / and yet endureth the custōme And also whan he fneseth or gapeth he maketh to fore his face the signe of the crosse and blessith hym / And yet endureth this custome / And how that pestelence begā it is foun∣de in the lyf of saynt gregorye / Secondly this letanye is said procession of seuen ordres / by cause that whan they were made / seynt gregorye ordeyned them by vij ordynances / For in the first ordre was all the clergye / in the second were the monkes and relygyous men / In the thirde were alle the nonnes / In the fourth alle the children / In the fyfthe all the laye peple / In the sixthe alle the wydo∣wes And in the vij alle they yt were ma¦ryed / But by cause that nowe we may not fulfylle in nombre of personnes / we ought to fulfylle it in nōbre of letanyes For it ought to be said vij tymes / or the procession be left / Thirdly this letanye is said the black crosse / For thenne in signe of pestylence / of wepyng and of penaunce / they cladde them wyth black clothes / And parauenture for that same cause / they couerd the crosse and the aulters wyth blessyd hayres / And thus we shold take on vs clothyng of penaūce Ther is an other letanye / whiche is cal¦led the lasse letanye / the whiche is ma¦de the thre dayes tofore thascēcion / And this Instituted seynt Mamertyn bisshop of vyane / in the tyme of themperour lyon whiche regned the yere of our lord iijClviij / to fore the Institucion of the first / And is said the letanye the lasse / the rogacions and processions / For it is The lasse letanye to the difference of the first / by cause that this lasse letanye was Institued of a lasse whiche was a sym∣ple bisshop / in a lasse place / and for lasse maladye / And the cause of the in¦stitucion was this / For thenne at vyane were grete erthe quaues / of whiche fyl doun many chirches and many houses / and ther was herde grete sownes and grete clamours by nyght / And thenne happed a terrible thyng on ester day / For fyre descended fro heuen that brente the kynges palays / yet happed more mer∣ueyllous thyng / For lyke as the fendes had entred in to the hogges / right so by the suffraunce of god for the synnes of the peple / the fendes entred in to wulues and other wylde bestes / whiche euerych doubted / and they wente not only by the wayes ne by the feldes / but also by the cytees ronnen openly / And deuoure den the chyldren & olde men and wymen And whan the bisshop sawe that euery day happed suche sorouful aduentures / he cōmanded and ordeyned / that the peple shold faste thre dayes / And he instituted the letanyes / and thenne the tribulaciō ceassed / And fro than forth on the chir¦che hath ordeyned & confermed that this letanye shold be kept and obserued ouer all / It is said also Rogacions / For thenne we praye and demaunde the suf∣frages of alle the sayntes / and we thus haue good cause for to kepe this ordenaū¦ce / and faste in thise dayes / And for many reasons it is institued / Fyrst by cause it appeaseth the bataylles / that co∣mynly begynne in prymtemps / Secōdly by cause that the fruytes whiche be thēne tendre / that god will multeplye / Thirdly by cause that euery man shold mortefye in hym self the moeuynges of hys flessh / whiche in that tyme boylle / Fourtly by cause yt euerich dispose hym self to receyue the holy goost / For by fas¦tynges / by orysons / and by deuocion / is one more able and more worthy / But two other reasōs assigneth maistre will̄m dancerre / by cause than whan Ih̄u cryst wold ascende vnto heuen / he sayde / Aske ye duely and ye shal haue / And we may the more faithfully demaunde / whan we haue the promesse of god / Secondly by cause ye holy chirche fasteth & prayeth / that she haue but lytil flessh / that is to make the body lene by absty∣nence / and to gete wynges by prayer /
For prayer is the wynge of the sowle / by whiche she fleeth to heuen / to thende that she may folowe Ih̄u cryste ascēdyng vp to fore vs to shewe vs the waye / And knowe ye that the foule that ha∣boundeth in plente of flessh / and hath but fewe pennes or fethers / he may not wel flee / Thus this letanye is called pro∣cession / For thenne the chirche maketh generall procession / And in this pro∣cession the crosse is born / the clockes and belles ben sowned and rongen / the ba / ners ben born / And in somme chirche a dragon with a grete taylle is born / And ayde and helpe is demaunded of alle seyntes / ¶ And the cause why the crosse is born and the belles rongen / is for to make the fēdes and euyll spyrites aferd and to flee / For lyke as the kyn∣ges haue in bataylles tokenes and sig∣nes royall / as her trompes and baners right so the kynge of heuen perdurable hath hys signes mylytaunt in the chirche he hath belles for busynes and for trōpes he hath the crosse for baners / And lyke as a tyraunt and a malefactour shold moche doubte / whan he shal here the busy∣nes and trompes of a myghty kynge in his lande and shal see his baners / In lyke wyse the enemyes the euyll spyri∣tes that ben in the regiō of thayer / doubte moche whan they here the trompes of god whiche ben the belles rongen / And whan they see the baners born on hye / And this is the cause why the belles be rongē whan it thondreth / and whan grete tem∣pestes and oultrages of wether happen / to thende that the fendes and wicked spyrites shold be abasshed and flee / and ceasse of the moeuyng of tempest / how be it also / that ther is another cause ther with / that is for to warne the crysten pe¦ple / that they put them in deuocion and in prayer for to praye god that the tem¦pest may ceasse / Ther is also the baner of the kynge / that is the crosse / whiche the enemyes dred moche and doubte / For they drede the staf / with whiche they haue ben hurte / And this is the reason wher¦fore in somme chirche / in the tyme of tem¦pest and of thondre / they sette out the crosse ayenst the tempest / to thende that the wycked spyrites see the baner of the souerayn kynge / & for drede therof that they flee / And therfore in procession the crosse is born / And the belles rongē for to chace and hunde away the fendes beyng in thayer / and to thende that they leue to tempest vs / The crosse is born for to represente the victorye of the resurrectiō and of thascencion of ihesu cryste / For he ascēded in to heuē wyth all a grete praye And thus this baner that fleeth in the ayer signefyeth Ihesu cryste assendyng vnto heuene / And as the peple folowe the crosse / the baners and the procession Ryght so whan Ihesu Cryste styed vp in to heuen / a grete multitude of seyntis fo¦lowed hym / And the songe that is son¦gen in the procession / signefyeth the son¦ge of angellis and the preysynges / that cam ayenst Ihesu cryste / and conduyted and conueyed hym to heuene where is grete Ioye and melodye In som chirches and in especiall in them of fraunce is ac∣customed to bere a dragon with a longe taylle fylled ful of chaff or other thynge The two first dayes it is born to fore the crosse / And on the thirde day / they bere it after the crosse with the taylle all voy¦de / by whiche is vnderstonden / that the first day to fore the lawe / or the seconde vnder the lawe / the deuyl regned in the world / And on the thirde day of grace by the passyon of Ihesu cryste he was put out of his Royame / After in this pro∣cession singulerly we calle the suffrages of alle the sayntes / And why we calle to ye sayntes / dyuerse reasōs ben assigned here to fore / But yet ther be of the gene¦rall wherfore we praye the sayntes / Fyrst for our pouerte / and for the glo∣rye of sayntes / and for the reuerence of god / For the sayntes may well knowe the vowes and the prayers of the sup∣plyauntes / For in the myrrour perpetuel that is Ihesu cryste / they vnderstonde how moche it apperteyneth to theyr Ioye and to our prouffyt / Thenne the first reason is for our pouerte / and for our myse∣rye / or for our defaute / we haue somme merite to thende that where our merites be not suffycient / the suffrages of sayntes may auaylle vs / or for deffaute that we haue in contemplacion of god / And that we may see parfyghtly the lyght so∣uerayn that we see and beholde in his sayntes / or for the deffaulte that we haue in louyng god / For we see that some she∣we more gretter affection to a saynt / than

Thus endeth the lyf of saint Edward kyng and Confessour ¶ Here foloweth of saint Luke Theuangelist And first of his name LUke is as moche to sa¦ye as arysynge or enhaun∣cynge hym self / Or Luke is sayd of lyght / he was rey∣syng hym self fro ye loue of the world and enhauncyng in to the loue of god And he was also lyght of the world for he enlumyned the vnyuersal world by holy predicacion / And herof sayth saynt Mahewe / Mathei quinto / ye ben the lyght of the world / the lyght of the world is the sonne / And that lyzt hath heyght in his sete or syege / And herof sayth Ecclesiastes the xxvj Cha∣pytre / the sonne rysynge in the world is in the ryght hyhe thynges of god / he hath delyte in beholdyng / And as it is sayd Ecclesiastes vndecimo / The lyght of the sonne is swete / And hit is delytable to the eyen / to see the son∣ne / He hath swyftnes in his moeuyng as it is sayd in the second book of Es¦dre the fourthe chapytre / The erthe is grete / and the heuen is hyhe / And the cours of the sonne is swyft / and hath prouffyte in effect / For after the philo∣sophre man engendth man and the sonne / And thus Luke had hyhenes by the loue of thynges celestyalle / de∣lectable by swete conuersacion / Swyft∣nes by feruent predicacion / And vty∣lyte and prouffyte by consceypcion & wrytynge of his doctryne / ¶Of saynt Luke euangelyst LUke was of the naci∣on of Syrye / And Anthyo¦chyen by arte of medycyne And after somme he was one of lxxij disciples of our lord / Seynt Iheromme sayth that he was discyple of thappostles and not of our lord / And the glose vpon the xxv cha∣pytre of the booke of Exodi sygnefy∣eth / that he ioyned not to oure lorde whan he prechyd / but he cam to the fa∣ith after his resurection / But it is mo¦re to be holden that he was none of the lxxij disciples / though somme holde op¦pynyon that he was one / But he was of ryght grete perfection of lyf & moche well ordeyned as toward god / And as touchynge his neyghbour / as tou∣chynge hym self / and as towchynge his offyce / & in signe of these foure ma∣ners of ordenaunces / he was descryued to haue four faces / that is to wete / the face of a man / the face of a lyon / the face of an oxe / and the face of an egle & eche of these bestes had foure faces & foure wynghes / as it is sayd in Eze∣chyell the fyrst chapytre / And by cau∣se it may the better be sene / late vs yma¦gyne some beest / that hath his hede four square / & in euery square a face / so that the face of a man be to fore / and on the ryght syde the face of the lyon / & on the lyft syde / the face of the oxe / & behynde the face of thaygle / & by cause that the face of thaygle appyerid aboue thother for the lengthe of the necke / therfor hit is sayd that this face was aboue / and eche of these foure had foure pennes / For whanne euery beest was quadra∣te as we may ymagyne / In a quadrate
ben foure corners / and euery corner was a penne / By these foure beestes after that sayntes sayen / ben signefyed the foure euangelystes / Of whome eche of them had foure faces in wrytyng / that is to wete of humanite / of the pas¦sion of the resurection / and of the dyuy¦nyte / how be it / these thynges ben syn∣gulerly to synguler / For after saynt Iheromme Mathewe is signyfyed in the man / For he was syngulerly me∣ued to speke of thumanyte of our lord Luke was fygured in the Oxe / For he deuysed aboute the presthode of Ihe∣su Cryst / Marke was fygured in the lyon / For he wrote more clerely of the resurection / For as somme saye the faw¦nes of the lyon ben as they were deed vnto the thyrd day / but by the brayeng of the lyon they ben reysed at the thyr¦de day / And therfor he beganne in the crye of predicacion / Iohan is fygured as an Egle / whiche fleeth hyest of the foure / For he wrote of the dyuynyte of Ihesu Cryste / For in hym ben wreton foure thynges / he was a man borne of the vyrgyne / he was an oxe in his pas¦syon / A lyon in his resurection / And an Egle in his ascencion / And by the∣se four faces it is wel shewed / that lu¦ke was ryghtfully ordeyned in these four maners For by the face of a man it is shewed / that he was ryghtfully ordeyned / as touchyng his neyghbour how he ought by reason teche hym dra∣we hym by debonayrte / and nourysshe hym by lyberalyte / for a man is a best resonoble / debonayre and lyberalle / by the face of an Egle it is shewed that he was ryghtfully redeyned / as tow∣chyng god / For in hym the eye of vn∣derstandynge beheld god by contem∣placion / and the eye of his desyre was to hym by thought or effecte / And ol∣de age Was put awey by newe conuer¦sacion / The Egle is of sharp syght / soo that he beholdeth well wythoute moe∣uyng of his eye the raye of the sonne / And whan he is merueylous hyghe in the ayer / he seeth wel the smale fysshes in the see / he hath also his becke moche croked / soo that he is lette to take his mete / he sharpeth it / and whetteth it a∣geynst a stone / and maketh it couena∣ble to the vsage of his fedynge / And whanne he is rosted by the hote sonne / he throweth hym self doune by greete forse in to a fontayne / And taketh a∣way his old age by the hete of the son¦ne / and chaungeth his fethers / and ta¦keth awey the derkenes of his eyen / By the face of the lyon it is shewed how he was ordeyned as towchyng hym self / For he hadde noblesse by ho∣neste of maners / and holy conuersaci∣on / he hadde subtylytee for teschewe the lyggynge in a wayte of his enemyes And he had suffraunce for to haue py¦te on them / that were tormentid by af∣flyctyon / The lyon is a noble best / For he is kynge of beestes / he is subtyll / he defaceth his traces and stappes wyth his taille whan he fleeth / so that he shol¦de not be founden / he is suffryng / For he suffryth the quartayne / By the face of an oxe / hit is shewed / how he was ordeyned as touchyng his offyce / that was to wryte the gospell / For he pro∣ceded morally / that is to saye by mora∣lyte / that he beganne fro the natyuyte / and childhode of Ihesu Cryst And so proceded lytell and lytell vnto his last consummacion / he beganne discretely / And that was after other two euan∣gelistes that yf they had lefte ony thyn¦ge / he shold wryte hit / And that whi¦che they had suffycyently sayd / he shold leue / he was wel manerd / that is to saye wel lerned and enduced in the sacrefyses and werkes of the temple / as it appiereth in the begynnyng / in the myddle / and in the end / The Oxe is a moralle beest / and hath his foote clo∣uen / by whiche is discrecion vnderstan¦den / and it is a best sacrefysable / And truly how that Luke was ordeygned in the foure thynges hit is better she∣wed in the ordynaunce of his lyf / Fyrste as towchynge his ordenaunce vnto god / After saynt Bernard he was ordeyned in thre maners / that is by affection and desyre / by thought and Intencion / thaffection ought to be holy / the thought clene / And entencion ryʒt¦full / he hadde the affection holy / For he was fulle of the hooly ghoost / lyke as Iheromme sayth in his prologue vpon Luke / he wente in to Bythynye fulle of the hooly ghoost / Secondly he hadde a clene thoughte / For he was a
vyrgyne in body and mynde / in whiche is noted clennesse of thought / Third∣ly he had ryghtfull intencion / For in alle thynges that he dyd he sought the honoure of god / And of these two last thynges it is sayd in the prologue vp¦on thactes of Appostles / he was with oute synne / and abode in vyrgynyte / & this is touchyng the clennesse of tho∣ught / he louyd best to serue oure lord / That is to the honour of our lord / This is as to wchyng the ryghtfulle intencion / Fourthly / he was ordeyned as towchyng his neyghbour / we ben ordeyned to our neyghbour / whan we doo that we ought to do / After Ry∣chard of saynt Victour / ther ben thre thynges that we owe to our neyghbo∣ur / that is our power / oure knowlege / and our wylle / and late the fourth be put to / that is / alle that we may doo / Our power in helpyng hym / our knou¦lege in counceylyng hym / Oure wylle in his desyres / and our dedes in seruy∣ses / As towchyng to these foure / saynt Luke was ordeyned / For he gaf fyrst to his neyghbour / his power in aydyn¦ge / and obsequyes / And that appiereth by that he was ioyned to pawle in his trybulacions / and wold not departe fro hym / but was helpyng hym in his prechynges / lyke as it is wreton in the Epystle of pawle in the second chapy∣tre to Thymothee sayeng / luke is only with me / In that he sayth only wyth me / hit sygnyfyeth that he was an hel∣par / as that he gaf to hym comforte & ayde / And in that he sayd only / it sig¦nyfyeth that he ioyned to hym fermely And he sayd in the eygthe Chapytre / to the Corynthyens / he is not allone / but he is ordeyned of the Chirches to be felawe of our pylgremage / Second∣ly / he gaf his knowlege to his neygh∣bour in counceylles / he gaf thenne his knowlege to his neyghbour / whan he wrote to his neyghbours the doctryne of thappostles and of the gospell that he knewe / And herof he berith hym self wytnes in his prologue sayenge / it is myn auys / and I assente good the∣phyle to wryte to the ryght well of the begynnynge by ordre / soo that thou knowe the trouthe of the wordes / of whiche thou arte taught / And it ap∣pyrreth well that he gaf his knowlege in counceyls to his neyghbours by the wordes that Iheromme sayth in his prologue / that is to wete / that his wor¦des ben medecyne vnto a seke sowle / Thyrdly he gaf his wylle vnto the de∣syres of his neyghbour / And that ap∣pyereth by that / that he desyreth / that they shold haue helthe perdurable / lyke as pawle sayth to the Colocenses / Luke the leche saleweth yow / that is to saye / thynke ye to haue helthe perdurable / for he desyreth it to yow / Fourthly he gaf to his neyghbour his dede in their seruyses / And it appiereth by that / that he supposed that oure lord had be a straunge man / and he recey∣ued hym in to his hows / and dyde to hym alle the seruyse of charyte / For he was felawe to Cleophas whan they wente to Emaus / as somme saye / And Gregorye sayth in his morallys that Ambrose sayth / it was another of whome he nameth the name / Thyrdyly / he was well ordeyned / as touchyng hym self ¶ And after saynt Bernard thre thynges ther ben that ordeyne a man ryght well as tou¦chynge hym self / and maketh hym ho∣ly / that is to lyue sobyrly / and ryght¦ful labour / and a debonayr wytte / And after saynt Bernard eche of the¦se thre is deuyded in to thre / that is to lyue sobyrly yf we haue compaynably contynently / and humbly / Ryghtfull werke is / yf he be ryghtfull / discrete / & fruytfull / Ryghtfull by good entenci¦on / Discrete by mesure / and fruytfulle by edyfycacion / The wytte is debonayre whan oure fayth feleth god to be soue¦rayne good / So that by his puyssaun¦ce we byleue / that our Infyrmyte be holpen by his power / our ygnoraunce be corrected by his wysedome / And that oure wickednes be diffaced by his bounte / And thus sayth Bernard / In all these thynges was saynt Luke well ordeyned / He hadde fyrst sobre ly¦uynge in treble manere / For he lyued contynently / ¶ For as saynt Ihe∣romme wytnessith of hym in the prolo∣logue vpon Luke / he hadde neuer wyf¦ne chyldren / he lyued compaynably / & that is signefyed of hym where it is
sayd of hym and Cleophas in thoppy¦nyon afore sayd / Two disciples wente that same day et cetera / Felauship is signyfyed in that he saith two disciples that is to saye well manerd / Thyrdly he lyued humbly / of whiche humylyte is shewed of that he expressyd the na∣me of his felawe Cleophas / and spak not of his owne name / And after thoppynyon of some Luke named not his name for mekenes / Secondly / he had ryghtful werke and dede / and his werke was ryghtfull by Intencion / And that is sygnefyed in his collecte where hit is sayd Carnis mortificacio∣nem ingiter in corpore suo pro tui no∣minis amore portauit / he bare in his bo∣dy mortificacion of his flesshe for the loue of thy name / he was discrete by at temperaunce / And therfor he was fy∣gured in the forme of an oxe / whiche hath the foote clouen / by whiche the ver¦tu of discrecion is expressyd / he was al¦so fruytful by edificacion / he was soo fruytfull to his neyghbours that he was holden moost dere of all men / Wherfor ad Colocenses quarto He was callyd of thoppostle moost derest Luke the leche saleweth yow / Thyrdly he had a meke wytte / For he byleuyd and con¦fessyd in his gospel god to be souera∣ynly myghty / soueraynly wyse / & soue¦raynly good / Of two the fyrst it is sa¦id in the iiij chappytre / They all were abasshed in his doctryne / For the word of hym was in his power / And of the thirde / it appyerith in the xviij chapytre where he saith / ther is none good / but god allone / Fourthly and last he was ryght wel ordeyned / as touchyng his offyce / the whiche was to wryte the go∣spel / and in this appierith that he was ordeyned by cause that the said gospell is enoblysshed with moche trouthe / hit is ful of moche prouffyte / hit is embe∣lysshed with moche honeste / And aucto¦rysed by grete auctoryte / It is fyrste ennoblysshed with moche trouthe / For ther ben thre trouthes / that is of lyf / of ryghtwysnes / and of doctryne / Trouthe of lyf is concordaunce of the honde to the tongue / Trouthe of ryght∣wysnes is concordaunce of the sentence to the cause / And trouthe of doctryne is concordaunce of the thyng to the vn¦derstandyng / And the gospell is en∣noblysshed by this treble veryte / And that this treble veryte is shewed in the gospel / luke sheweth that Ihesu Cryste had in hym this treble veryte / And that he taught it to other / and sheweth that god hadde this trouthe by the wytnes of his aduersaryes / And that sayth he in the xxvij Chappy∣tre / Mayster we knowe well / that thou arte trewe and techest and saiste ryghtfully / that is the veryte of the doctryne / but thow techest in trouthe the way of god / that is the trouthe of lyf For good lyf is the waye of god / Secondly he sheweth in his Gospelle / that Ihesu Criste taught this treble trouthe / Fyrste he taught the trouth of lyf / the whiche is in kepynge the com∣maundementes of god / wherof hit is sayd / thou shalt loue thy lord God / Doo that / And thou shalt lyue / And whanne a pharysee demaunded oure lord / what shalle I doo for to possede the euerlastyng lyf· And he sayd / kno¦west thou not the commaundementes Thow shalt not slee / thow shalt do no thefte / ne thou shalt doo no aduoultry Secondly there is taughte the veryte of doctryne / wherfor he sayd to somme / that peruertid this trouth the enleuēth chapytre / Woo be to yow pharisees that tythe the peple et cetera / and passe ouer the Iugement and charite of God / Also in the same / woo be to yow wyse∣men of lawe / whiche haue taken the ke¦ye of scyence / Thirdly is taught the trouthe of ryghtwysnes where hit is sayd / yelde ye that longeth to thempe¦rour / And that ye owe to god to god And he seyth the xix Chapytre / They that ben myn enemyes / and wyl not that I regne vpon them / bryng them hether / and slee them to fore me / And he saithe in the thyrtenthe chapy¦tre / where he speketh of the dome / that he shal saye to them that ben repreuyd departe fro me ye that haue done wyc∣kednes / Secondly / his gospel is ful of moche prouffite / wherof Powle and hym self wryte that he was a leche or a phisicyen / wherfore in his gospel hit is signyfyed / that he made redy for vs medycyne moost prouffytable / Ther is treble medycyne / Curyng preseruyng
and amendynge / And this treble me∣dycyne sheweth saynt Luke in his go∣spelle / that the leche celestyall hath ma∣de redy / The medycyn curynge is that / whiche cureth the maladye / and that is penaunce / whiche taketh awey alle ma∣ladyes spyrytuell / And thys nedycy∣ne sayth he / that the celestyall leche hath made redy for vs / whan he sayth / Hele ye them / that be contryte of herte / And preche ye to the caytyues the remyssion of synnes / And in the fyfthe chapy∣tre he sayth / I am not come to calle the Iuste and trewe men / but the synners to penaunce / ¶ The Medy∣cyne amendyng is that encreaceth hel¦the / And that is the obseruacion of co∣unseylle / For good counceyll maketh a man better and more parfyghte / This Medecyne sheweth vs the heuen∣ly leche whan he saith in the eyghtenth chapytre / Selle all that euer thou hast and gyue to poure men / The medecyne preseruatyf / is that whi¦che preserueth fro fallyng / And thys is theschewyng of thoccasions to syn∣ne / and fro euylle companye / And this medecyne sheweth to vs the heuenly le¦che whan he sayth in the twellfth chap¦pytre / kepe yow fro the mete of the pha¦rysees / & there he techeth vs teschewe the companyes of shrewes and euylle men / Or it may be sayd that the sayd Gospel is replenysshed with moche pro¦uffyte / by cause that all vertue is con∣tyened therin / And herof sayth saynt Ambrose / luke compryseth in his Go∣spell alle the vertues of wysedome in hystorye / he enseigned the natyuyte / whan he shewed thyncarnacion of our lord to haue be made of the hooly ghost But Dauyd enseygned naturell wy∣sedome when he sayd / Sende oute the holy ghoost / and they shalle be created And whan he enseygned derkenes / made in the tyme of the passion of Ihe¦su Cryst / and tremblyng of the erthe And the sonne had wythdrawen her lyght and rayes / And he taught mo∣ralyte whan he taught maners in his blessidnes / he taught resonable thynges whan he sayd / he that is trewe in lytel thynges / he is trewe in grete thynges / And withoute this treble wysedome / the mysterye of the Trynyte ne of our faithe may not be / that is to wete Wy∣sedome naturelle / Resonable / and Mo∣ralle / And this is that saynt Ambro∣se sayth / Thyrdly / His gospell is embe¦lysshed and made fayre wyth moche honeste / soo that the style and manere of spekyng is moche honeste and faire And thre thynges be conuenyent to this that somme men holde in his dic∣tes honeste and beaute / the whiche sa∣ynt Austyn techeth / That is to wete / that it please that it appyere and moe∣ue / that it please / he ought to speke or∣natly / that it appyere that he ought to speke apertly / that it moeue that he spe¦ke feruently / And this maner hadde Lucas in wrytyng and in prechyng / Of two the fyrst hit is sayd in the viij Chapytre to the Corynthyens / We sente with hym a broder / the glose / Barnabe or Luke / of whome the praysynge is in al Chirches of the gospell / In this that he sayd the praysyng of hym is sygnefyed / that he spak ornatly / in this that he sayde in alle Chirches / hit is signefyed / that he spak apertly / And that he spak feruently hit appie¦ryd whanne he sayd / was not thenne oure herte brennyng within vs in the loue of Ihesu whanne he spake wyth vs in the waye / Fourthly his gospelle is auctorysed by Auctoryte of many sayntes / What merueyle was it though it were aucto¦rysed of many / whan it was auctory∣sed fyrst of the fader / wherof Iheromye seyth in the xxxj Chappytre / Lo the da¦yes shalle come our lord saith / I shal make a newe couenaunt with the hous of Israell and of Iuda / not after the couenaunt that I made with theyre fa¦ders but this shal be the couenaūt saith oure lord / I shalle gyue my lawe in to the bowellys of them / And he speketh playnly to the letter of doctryne of the Gospel / Secondly hit is enforced of the Son∣ne / For he sayth in the same Gospel the one and twentyest Chapytre / Heuen and erthe shal passe / And my word shal not perysshe / Thirdly he is en∣spyred of the holy ghoost / wherof saint Iheromme sayth in his prologue vpon Luke / He wrote this gospel in the par¦tyes
