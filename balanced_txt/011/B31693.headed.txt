A Salutation of Love to all the Tender Hearted, who follow the Lamb wheresoever he Leadeth them. WE may truly say, that God is good to Israel; to that Is∣rael who are of a clean Heart, whose Hearts are cleansed and washed, whose Conscience is sprinkled with pure Wa∣ter; such are come to the Blood of Sprinkling, and to know the Blood of the New-Covenant to purge their Consciences from Dead Works, and to cleanse them from all Filthiness both of Flesh and Spirit; such come to know they are made clean by the Word, and their Hearts cleansed by the Word, the sincere Word, by which they are nourished, and are dayly sucking of the Milk thereof, by which they grow sincere unto God; such feel their dayly and hourly Refresh∣ments from him, they cannot live without him, and such feel their strength renewed by the Renewings of the Holy Ghost, and they can say the time of Refreshing is come, and that the time of Spring is come, and that the Well springs up of Life in them; these are true Belie∣vers, who witness the Promise of Christ fulfilled in them; Whosoever believeth in me, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water, and whosoever drinks thereof, shall never thirst again: And whosoever shall eat of the Bread that I shall give (saith Christ) shall never hunger more: he that giveth liberally, and upbradeth no Man; if any Man wants Wisdom, let him ask of him, let him ask of the Lord, for a wiser than Solomon is here, a greater than Moses, the Wonderful Counsellor, the Prince of Paradice, the King of Eternal Glory, who is shining forth in his Beauty, in the Beauty of Holiness; he is called the Bright and Morning Star, the Day-Star, the Son of Righteousness, he is ascend∣ing in his Glory, and coming with the sound of a Trumpet: And he that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit and the Bride saith to the Churches: And all the Children of the true Bridgroom, they come to hear his Voice within them; which gives them a cetain evidence and a more sure Testimony than any man can giv which will be every ones Eternal Peace when he shall say unto them, Well done thou good and faithful Servant, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord. So eve∣ry
one must eye his Lord, and be faithful to what he is intrusted; no surer Evidence than that which every one doth feel; besides, we have a clear Testimony, the Anointing unto which we are directed, the Holy Unction, unto which we are to keep, and not to go forth from it, to have our Evidence in any thing without, but to have our Witness and Seal within, Sealed by the Spirit of Promise unto the Day of Re∣demption; for he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry, and he will reward the Faithful with an everlasting Reward; it will be no Matter to them what the Unfaithful shall say, when the Joy of the Faith∣ful shall be full, and when their Cup shall overflow, and blessed are all such wise Virgins, who feel the Oyl of Joy and Gladness in them, these have Oyl in their Lamps, they feel it, and feed upon it, and their Lamps shall never go out, but their Lights shall burn continually more and more until the coming of the Bridegroom in them; these have already met with him whom their Souls love; these went not out in vain, nor to see a Reed shaken with the Wind; but what have they seen? A Prophet: yea, I say unto you, and more than a Prophet, a greater than John, a wiser than Solomon, he that fulfilleth all the Pro∣phets, he that fulfilleth all Righteousness; so these Virgins that fol∣low him wheresoever he leadeth them, these feel their Lights and their Lamps burn, the burning and shining Light in them, the Refiner as by Fire in them to refine and burn up all Corruption in them; these can dwell with everlasting burning, and abide with devouring fire, be∣cause they love his Judgments, who are feeling of the Judgment of God to purifie them; and he that hath this Faith purifieth himself, thorow which I have stedfast hope in God, which hope maketh not ashamed: so every one must feel his Hope in God, and his Faith wrought by the Power of God; for without Faith it is impossible to please God: so all that are Living Members of Christ's Body have a Living Faith in them, which purifieth them, and maketh them like his Glorious Body; these know an Inward Work day by day wrought in them; not what they see another do, so to practice or follow, but as they feel sensibly the In-speakings and inward Motions and Workings of Faith work in them, to will and to do of his own good Pleasure; for by his Word begat he us into this Living Hope and Lively Faith, which hath al∣ready removed Mountains out of the way in them that believe; so that I can say, Faith is the Gift of God; and that he hath given me to believe things that are, and things that shall be brought to pass, as he said unto his Beloved, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things that shall shortly come to pass. So blessed is the Eye that seeth, and the Ear
that heareth, and the Heart that understandet more things that be∣long to their Eternal Peace; they can say they feel that Peace that pas∣seth all understanding, and that Joy that flows like a River; they are filled with Admiration, admiring the great Love of God, his Care and Preservation in preserving them in a living, feeling, sensible State of their own Conditions, and helplessness without him; so these can say, Oh! what manner of Love is this that our Father hath bestowed upon us, to call us his Children, and what shall we say! Oh the Height and the depth, the Length and the Breadth of the Love of God! Shall not his Works glorifie him, who hath wrought this good Work, and hath filled the Heart with Treasure, New and Old? Such is the Trea∣sure of Wisdom and Knowledge we have in our Earthen Vessel; of which I am perswaded, that Things past, neither that are present, nor Principalities nor Powers, nor Things that are to come shall be able to shake us from our Faith and Foundation which we have in Christ Je∣sus, who is our Lord, King, and Law-giver, High-Priest, and Prophet; so blessed are they that know him so, and that with Mary, have cho∣sen the Better Part, which shall never be taken from them who hold fast that which from God they have received; these know their part in the first Resurrection, on whom the second Death shall have no Pow∣er, these know Christ Risen in them, their Hope of Glory, in whom is their Anchor, their Faith, he is their Foundation which standeth sure and unmoveable, these hold fast Christ their Head, they become as Mount Zion that cannot be removed; and as the Walls are about Jerusalem, so is the Arm of the Almighty round about his People, and as the Bird covers her Young, so is the Lord covering his tender begot∣ten Ones, he hides them under the Over-shadowing of his Wings, and every one that dwells in the Defence of the Most High, shall abide un∣der the Over-shadowing of the Almighty, they shall feel the Over∣shadowings of his Power while the Storm is, unil it is over, and then they shall shine forth in his Glory, who is the Begotten of God, full of Grace and Truth, he whom the Father will Glorifie with the same Glory he had with him before the World was: so he saith, Father, Glorifie me, that I may Glorifie thee. So it is he in his Sanctified Ones must shine in his Crucified Body, Crucified to the World, and the World to them, his Sanctified Body, his Glorified Body, that he is now Arisen, and Arising with, and he is bringing his dead Men with him: With my dead Body (saith Cist) shall they arise, and be quicknea toge∣ther with my dead Body, they shall appear dead to the World. Behold I die dayly, and the Life that I now live is by Faith in the Son of God;
so if ye are Risen with Christ, seek those things which are above; so blessed are all them who have laid up Treasure in Heaven, durable Treasure, where the Moths cannot corrupt, nor Thieves break through and steal: nothing else will avail, nor stand any one in stead, but that Treasure that never waxeth old, which will be lasting Joy to them that have it, unspeakable Joy and full of Glory, it is the Pearl of great Price, and they that dig deep, they this Pearl do find, it proves Joy and Peace, and Consolation to the Mind, it is Treasure which doth for ever last, they shall sing Hallelujah when all Sorrow is past, it will prove a blessed Crown to thee when thy Soul shall sing sweet Harmony, when thou shalt at last be set free. So it is to the Anointing which teacheth all Things, and sheweth all Things; it sheweth plainly of the Father, which will be the satisfacti∣on of all who have a Living Desire and Breathing in them, and a dayly Cry in them, Shew us the Father and it sufficeth us. Oh! shew me the Place where thou causest thy Flocks to rest at Noon, where they feed of the green Pasture, and drink of the Rivers of his Pleasures; and these say, Oh! give us evermore of this Bread, and this Wine, which is the Fruit of the Heavenly Vine, which the Upright eat and drink every day new in the Fathers Kingdom; the Kingdom of God being come in them in Power and great Glory, these have found the Anointed One of God, whom their Souls have sought sorrowing, and he hath led them home, he that is the Anointing, and the Anointed One of God, he which sheweth all Things, and teacheth all Things, he that saith, I will hereafter speak more plainly unto you: That is, to his Disciples, but not unto the World; lo now thou speakest plainly; so the Inspeakings and the Anointing, the Holy Unction which ye have received of the Father, which is the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter of which Christ spake un∣to them, I will send you the Comforter: Another Comforter I will send unto you, the Spirit of Truth, and he shall lead you into all Truth. So un∣to the Leadings and direct Guidings of the Anointed One of God, who is appointed of the Father for a Teacher, a Director, and a Guide, which every one must follow the Lord fully who enters the Good Land, and not Man, who can fetch you Chapter and Verse without the Spirit; but little Children, keep you to the Anointing, which is able to make you strong, by which you will overcome, and know the Word of God to abide in you, the more sure Word, unto which you do well if you take good heed, especially in these Days, which are Peril∣lous and Trying.
For this is sent unto Abraham's Seed, a Salutation unto that Seed which is blessed in Isaac, unto whom was the Covenant and Promise throughout all Generations, according to his Sayings, who saith, In thy Seed shall all Nations be blessed. Which is the Seed of the Cove∣nant, and Heir of the Promise; which Promise is not unto Seeds, as ma∣ny, but to the one Seed, which is the Seed of the Word; and he saith unto them, In blessing I will bless thee, in multiplying I will multiply thee. With Mercies and Loving Kindness the Lord fills his own Seed and Begotten Ones, who are begotten by his Eternal Word, these he fills, his Hungry with good things, and the Rich and the Full he sends emp∣ty away: So these can say, God is good to Israel: unto such as are of a pure Heart; Blessed are the Pure in Heart, they shall see God: They shall see him as he is, and behold his Glory to shine in them: these are they of a clean Heart, and he hath renewed in them a holy right Spirit, these are on their Watch-Tower, watching over their own Hearts and Minds, Tongues and Lips, these are keeping God's Vineyard clean against the Lord cometh, and that Servant at so doing, shall re∣ceive his Reward, the Reward that follows the clean Hands and a pure Heart, the Reward that follows all the Faithful, who shall receive in this Life a hundred Fold, and in that which is to come everlasting Life, and the Saying of the Lord unto them will be, Well done thou good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful to a little and few things, therefore I will make thee Ruler over many things, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord. But there will be a Rebuke unto the Unfaithful, who have not been faithful to the Day of small things, who have let slip their Iniquities as small ones, until they become great Mountains, which Mountains have hedged up their way, these have gone without Judgment, they should have keept Judgment on the head of the Trans∣gressor, and have known Judgment laid to the Line, and Righteous∣ness to the Plummet, until Judgment is brought forth to Victory; and this was the Saints Victory, by their Faith they overcame the World & the Lusts thereof, the Flesh and the Devil: So without Faith there is none shall be able to conquer and over come their own Corruptions, but they must know the good Fight of Faith in them against the Prince of this World, who hath Ruled in the Hearts of the Children of Rebelli∣on, who have rebelled against the Light, as saith Job; such are they as rebel against the Light, and this is the Condemnation of the Rebellious, that Light is come, and it will be for ever their Condemna∣tion who rebel against the Light, it will prove such a Worm in their Conscience, that will never die, and such Flames of Fire that will never
goout; therefore let all dread and tremble who make a Profession this day, and are found in Rebellion against the Lord, it will be your Con∣demnation, also that Light is come, who profess it and walk in Un∣cleanness; a Day also is overtaking you, and a Whirlwind of the Lord is arising to blow up more high and more terrible, which will blow such Chaffnway, that the pure Wheat may be seen, and the Precious Seed separated from the Unclean; and he said, Didst thou not sow good Seed in the Field? Then from whence sprang these Tares? He answers, While the Good Man of the House slept, the Enemy came and sowed his Tares by Night; but I will send forth my Angels, the Reapers, and they shall separate and gather the Wheat from the Tares; he shall gather the Wheat into his Garner, and he shall take the Tares and bind them in Bundles, and cast them into Ʋnquenchable Fire. And the Day of Sepa∣ration is coming, and the Righteous Seed groans for it, and their Cry is, How long, Lord? Hasten and come quickly: How long, Lord? Holy and True art thou. Come and bind up thy Jewels in the Bond of Love and Truth, in the Bond of Peace, Joy, and Humility, where they may sing with one Harmony, saying, My Beloved is mine, and I am his, and he is the chiefest of ten thousand, he is altogether Lovely. And what beloved Dalilah is there left behind that shall make a Separation? The Lord will search through the whole House of Israel, he will not leave a hoof behind, What means the bleating of the Sheep, and the lowing of the Oxen in mine Ears? (saith the Lord) What is it that is saved a∣live, bring it to the Sword, bring it to the Fire, let it be tried by the Fire, let the Judgment of the Lord pass over it, that Spiritual Phara∣oh's Bondage may be broken, which holdeth Israel in Captivity, that the Seed cannot go free; every one in particular must feel the Judg∣ments of the Lord upon Spiritual Pharaoh, before the Seed of the House of Israel can go free, the Bond-Woman and her Son Ishmael must be put out, the Scoffer at the true Woman and her Seed; the Birth that is born of the Flesh, and of the Fleshly Bond-Woman, mustbe put out from Abraham's Seed; Isaac only, the true Seed, in whom is the Bles∣sing and Promise, it is the Election that obtains the Everlasting Inheri∣tance which is given to the Elected Seed. And now my Beloved Friends, you that are born again of this holy right Seed, the Seed which cannot sin, because in it dwells no sin; so the Seed having Purity in it self; so every Seed bringeth forth Fruit ac∣cording to its kind, it being born of the Divine Nature, and being be∣gotten of the Holy Word, by the Word of his Holiness; these are not born of Flesh nor Blood, but of the Spirit, of the Word of Life which
liveth in them; so they come to say, The Lord Liveth: And because he Liveth, they live also; and then it is no more I, but Christ Liveth in me; he is the holy Seed of Promise, born of the Pure Virgin-Birth, Overshadowed by the Holy-Ghost; these come to know the Over∣shadowings of the Glory of God, and behold its shining in the Face of Jesus Christ, who is formed in them, and is full of Grace and Truth, he brings with him everlasting Righteousness, and fulfilleth all Righ∣teousness; so, Blessed are the Poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God: It is the Poor that receive the Gospel; Blessed are the Pure in Heart, for they shall see God: and, Without Holiness none shall see God; for Holiness becometh God's House for ever. And ye are called with a high and a holy Calling; and many are called, but few are chozen; so blessed are they that are called and chozen, who are faithful and true; for though the Seed of Israel in number, are as the Sand of the Sea, it will be but a little Remnant of them shall be. Saved, even those that are found with their Names written in the Book of Life, they that can read within, their Witness and Seal in them who have the White-Stone, and in it the new Name which none knows but he that enjoys the same; it is the hidden Life, hidden with Christ in God; blessed are they that feel and enjoy the same; without this all Profession will be in vain; it will not be a Profession of Zion, and have a Life in Sodom-Sin; and to talk of Jerusalem, and live in Aegypts Pride; a day of Searching is at Hand, Gold shall be known from Dross and Reprobate Silver, but let the Upright hide in the Rock until the Lord's Indigna∣tion is over; Therefore say to the Righteous, it shall go well with them, their Peace shall he as a River: he that his Mind is staid upon me I will keep in perfect Peace, saith the Lord. So the Blessing of Peace rests and remains upon the Upright in Heart for ever. Dorothy White.
A POST-SCRIPT. I Am God unchangeable, therefore ye Sons of Jacob and Seed of Abraham are not consumed at this Day: Therefore in that Seed which the greatest Fire and Fiery Tryal could not consume nor burn up, nor the Righteous Garments could not be singed, when the Furnace was heat seven times hotter than it was before, it could not consume the Faithful who believed, therefore they could not bow; but the Faithful will rejoyce both in the Fire and in the Water, because the Lord is with them, and such as have known the Flames and Con∣sumption of God, and have passed through the Fy Conflicts, who have felt the Arm of God to bear them up, that they sunk not, their Faith failed not; he saith, I will be with thee in the Fire, and when thou passest through the Water; though they are very high, yet saith Christ, I have Prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not. So it is he that hold∣eth out his hand, and helpeth up above the Doubting, he that help is laid upon, who is mighty and greater than all Prophets, speaking to me, because he speaketh Peace and Joy to my Soul, and every one must seel him and hear him to speak Peace and Joy to their Souls, he that no man ever spoke like him: this will be thy satisfaction when thou hearest him thy self; Therefore hear what the Spirit saith, and the Bride; hear what the Angel of God saith, and let him be thy Guide. His words are Sweeter than the Honey and the Honey-Comb, Hear him only, and cleave to him alone; It is sweet Honey drops out of the Rock; Oh they feed thereon, who are the Shepherd's Flock: They do hear the Spirit, they do hear the Bride; They do feel the Comforter, he is now their Guide: They feed on Pasture that is so green, They do drink at the Living Fountain Stream; They drink of Waters flowing from Jacob's Well; I Salute the Innocent, and bid them all Farewel. FINIS.
