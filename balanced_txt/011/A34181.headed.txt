THE FAITHFVLNESSE Of the UPRIGHT made MANIFEST Being a Testimony concerning the Life Death and Suffering of a pretious servant of the Lords, called, HUMPHERY SMITH. Who dyed a Prisoner for witnessing unto the living truth in Winchester Common Goal on the 4th. day in the 3 month, in the year 1663. IS thy famous works ever to be forgotten, is thy noble and vali∣ant acts to be blotted out of the memory of the righteous, is thy holy innocent, pure life to be buried in oblivion, as not to be remembred by us any more, is thy sufferings withall thy vali∣ant engagements with the enemies of thy God to be blotted out of the Record of the children of the most high, Oh what saith my soul, nay nay, let it be had in living remembrance among the followers of the Lamb, and let it be written upon the Tables of their hearts even to all generations.
ANd as concerning this man, he from his youth up had desires after the Lord, and he was often checked by his father because of his solidity, he mourned mightily after the Lord while he was yet a child, yea and panted after the God that made him, he followed the zealous professors, and increased mightily in that knowledge which stands in the comprehension, yea exceeded many of his equals; but at last the Lord seperated him for his own glory, and sent him forth in his own power and eternal name, so he lead him by the hand through the wilderness, and bore up his head above the waves which sought to destroy him, he became a talk and a by-word unto them with whom (before) he had his conver∣sation, yea they sought to destroy him in a moment, but yet the Lord lead him in the way and gave him the threshing In∣strument that belongs to worme Iacob despised of men, and he threshed and beat the hills to dust and rooted up the diso∣bedient that desisted Gods coming, he spared not but cut on the right hand and flew on the left, and made the arrows of his quiver to strike into the bowels of Gods enemies, but he prea∣ched peace to the captive, and uttered his voice to the Priso∣ners of hope, which lay groaning for deliverance, he was sent to publish Salvation and to cry the acceptable year of redemp∣tion, though the Rulers of the earth dealt very hardly with him, and the Priests cryed away with him, he is not worthy to ive, the professors envied him because of his upright dealing and the prophane hated and revied him because of his inno∣cent life, he was oftentimes cast into several nasty prisons, he was divers times whipt with cords, he was hated before Ma∣gistrates, that had no pitty nor compassion of him, he divers times adventured upon hard service, and broke through an os of wicked and unreasonable men, the Priests fell before him like Tow, and the professors were scattered like chasse, the wicked and prophane were even confounded and amased when his arrows so sharp did enter within their dark dwellings
but to the seed he uttered his voice, and it dropped like wa into the bowels of the tender hearted: verily the considera∣tion thereof doth even melt my heart and makes me to say, oh how delightsome was the pleasantness of thy beauty! and how desirable was the habitation of thy dwelling, and how prevalent were thy prayers and thy supplications, with thy God, who answered thee every morning, and satisfied thy soul every moment, which made thy cup to overflow, and the plea∣sant streames to run over its banks, because of the fulness thereof, and woe to him that lifts up a tongue against thee, and let him not be reckoned among the congregations of the righteous, that slanders thy innocent life, let him be smitten with terror that whispers or speaks evil of thee in a corner, for I know the Lord loved thee, and hath taken thee from the e∣vil that is to come upon the inhabitants of the earth, and out of this dark world that  not worthy of thee. But to proceed, he was visiting friends in and near London, and he told some of them thereawaies that he had a narrow path to pass through, he said also, that several daies before he was ta∣ken up, he saw that he should be imprisoned, and that it might cost him his life, and taking his leave of friends in them parts, he set forward in the will of the Lord Westward, and having a meeting at Alton, some envious men hearing thereof, sent armed men to the house where he was, commanding him forth, and having him before Humphery Bennet, & Iohn Norton, Deputy I. levetenants of the countrey, both great enemies to Gods truth, and though he gave a good account of his business which was to visit his son which was a child farther Westward, yet they without pitty or compassion equity or justice commit∣ted him to the stinking close Prison of Winchester, but to leave them without excuse in the day of the Lord which hastens to come upon them, he wrote wright soon unto them signifying how illegally they had dealt with him, also sent them back an answer to that which they charged against him, likewise shew∣ing that they laid nothing to his charge but what was charged against Gods servants in the daies of old, and moreover pro∣ved
unto them that they had acted contrary to the Kings laws Declaration and word, yet though all this and much more might be written, both of his usage in the Prison, and likewise how close a hole it was, sometimes other Prisoners Felons or such taking his food from him, and other abuses which he bore very patiently, which will be too tedious at present to re∣late, and likewise Iohn Norton and Humphery Bennet sending men and robbing him of all his Papers, rifeling his pockets boxes, and other places, yet he was very quiet and lay down content, but the next approching Sessions being come, he laid something of his suffering cause before some of those cal∣led Justices, and at that time some of them were willing to have released him, but some others of them being contrary minded, saying that it was the Deputy Lievetenants of the Sheir that committed him, and because they were not there they would not meddle with the thing, so the innocent suffe∣rer was let continue a prisoner till the next Asizes, and he then laid the thing before Judge Terril who before had been prit∣ty moderate to friends, and the judge gave him this answer, that if he would give bail for his good behaviour & appearance at the next Asizes, (though no evil behavior at all was laid to his charge) which when this innocent sufferer heard, and be∣ing satisfied that he was not guilty of the breach of any law, neither was their any that laid any such thing to his charge, he was content to remain there rather then do such a thing, so remaining there from Sessions till Sizes, and from Sizes till Sessions, and until that Sizes a whole year was over, then Judge Terril came again the Western Circuit, which Humphrey Smith hearing of, wrote unto him, signifying how contrary to any known law he had been dealt with, and requiring Justice, and that true judgement might proceed from him, and leaving him without excuse he sent it to him which he understood he read, and about the latter end of the Asizes he was called, for where having divers words with the Judge, he again said that if he would give bail for his good behavior and appearance at the next Asizes he should be released, which he answered thus
that he had lain in Prison so long and nothing of evil behavi∣or laid to his charge, and likewise saying that if any man there should convince him of any evil behavior, he should willingly acknowledge the same unto which they were all silent, then the Judge said if he would meet no more and promise not to break the law he should be released, unto which he answered thus, I think it is sufficient that I suffer if I do break the law, and not to suffer because I cannot promise not to break it, say∣ing also that he knew no law that required any such thing, so it being near the time of their breaking up, he was put aside, and others called, and soon after they dismissed the Court for that Asizes at that Bench, but as the Judge was passing forth, Humphrey Smith being in the Barr among the Fellons, he he spake these words unto him, Friend, remember I have been above a whole year in prison and no breach of any law proved against me, which the Judge heard, but passed away and said nothing to it, so he was had back to prison again, where ha∣ving been not above three weeks but he fell sick, first it took him like an Ague, and afterward with the Feavor following it, and in short time it grew very violent upon him, in so much that in five daies time he was so weak that he could scarcely help himself, then he also sent a letter unto Judge Terril, sig∣nifying his illegal dealing with him, and also gave him to know that he was very ill, but there was little done in the thing, so he grew weaker and weaker, so that two men did turn him in his bed, and in the time of his sickness he spake several preti∣ous words to friends, signifying unto them that he was given up in the will of the Lord, either in life or death, and as he lay under a great fit of the feaver, he said my heart is filled with the power of God, and then said, It is good for a man at such a time as this to have the Lord to be his friend; another time he said, Lord thou sentest me forth to do thy will, and I have been faithful unto thee in my small measure which thou hast committed unto me, but if thou wilt yet try me further, Thy will be done, also he said, I am the Lords, let him do what he will, and near the time of his departure, he cryed earnestly
unto the Lord, and said, O Lord hear the inward sight and groans of thine oppressed, and deliver my poor soul from the oppressor, O Lord herr me, O Lord uphold and preserve me. (I know that my Redeemer liveth) Thou art strong and mighty O Lord, with several other pretious word Also about the same time he prayed unto the Lord that he would deliver his people from their cruel oppressors, and that those that were convinced or brought forth by him, that the Lord would be their teacher, he lay very quiet and still, and not any unsavory word proceeded out of his mouth all the time of his sickness, but he behaved himself like a Lamb, and he was very sensible unto the last moment, he was faith∣full unto the Lord in his day, and a Crown everlasting is upon his head, which shall rest upon him, when all his oppressos shall gnash their tongues for pain and vexation of heart, ( some of them have felt already) yea and the full cup of the Lords indignation is preparing for all them who delight in relty, he was very meek and of a quiet spirit, very loving to all that had the least appearance of the light springing up in them, yea if any knew not the light which condemns the sin, then in the meekness of the love everlasting, he would open unto them the way thereunto, and labour mightily to bring them to the knowledge of it, oh how great was his love to the eternal truth which abounded in his heart, and how would he groan for the lost sheep, surely his love was more then my tongue can express, and his courage did abound in a great measure, he delighted not in vain janglings nor disputings of men of corrupt minds, but in the simplicity of the Gospel of peace which is his crown for ever and ever, what shall I say, his life is swallowed up in immortallity, and is no more to be seen in the visible, yet he reignes over all whisperers, backbi∣ters and slanderers of his innocent life for ever. Thou renowned Judge in Israel, thou valiant Souldier of the Lambs Host, peace is thy portion for ever, blessings will fill thine house and faithfulness will attend thy seed, as they a∣bide in the counsel of him who was the Bishop of thy soul. N. C.
BUt oh you Rulers of England, what shall I say unto you, most you needs be made a perpetual reproach unto all hat come after you, and is your delight wholly in persecu∣ing of the innocent, oh cruel men, on merciless men, will othing but the lives of Gods dee servants satisfy your bloo∣dy wills, surely the Lord God will visit you in his wrath, nd sweep you away in his sore displeasure, yea in the dread∣ul flames of the burnings of his vengeance will he cast you, h you unsatiable, vigorous, Tiranical, Idolatrous men, what is cruelty your delight? and is it blood that you thirst after, as after wine, which will not satisfie your lustful de∣sires, and is it nothing but the eternal truth which you would not have so much as come into your coasts, you worse hen Barbarians, how do you evilly intreat those who come n the love of the Lord, to preach repentance in your streets, nd you take away the lives of such who come to publish sal∣ation unto poor sinners, surely your unjust dealings is come p before the God whom you so much contemne in his ser∣vants, and your unrighteous actions against them whom he ath sent in his own name is peirced into the bowels of the God of the humble hearted, who will surely plead with you in his indignation, and utterly destroy you in his wrath, if you epent speedily, and humble your selves under his righteous judgements: wherefore I say repent repent, for the consum∣mation is at hand, yea the swift vengeance of the eternal God is nigh to be revealed upon all the disobedient, and the ut∣ter woe and calamity of all the merciless, (with the crewel hearted) is coming) yea nigh to come) which shall make a final end of all the rebellious and stifnecked ones, whose hearts are hard as the Adamant, wherefore awake, awake, sleep not in your wickedness in this day which is comming, as a thief in the night upon you, but arise up from cruelty, and shake your selves of the garments of the pollution of blood, which hath stained you, cleanse your selves of your Idolatry,
and clear your selves (if you can) of the lives of Gods servants which hath died in your Prisons, but if you cannot then known be it unto you, that God will not spare the best of those that have had a hand in these things (and shall persist therein) but will destroy them utterly, and curse them from his presence for evermore, and in this I shall be clear of all your blood when it comes upon you.
