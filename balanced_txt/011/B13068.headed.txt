DIEV ET MON DROIT HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon surmounted by a crown and flanked by the English lion on one side and the Scottish unicorn on the other ❧ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation concerning Tynne. WHereas for the well ordering of the Tynne of this Our Realme of England, diuers and sundry good Customes, Lawes, and Ordi∣nances haue beene heeretofore vsed, made, and established, by the wisedome of former times, amongst which there hath beene euer speciall care and prouision, that all the said Tynne should be duely brought to certaine places of Coynage, and there tryed and assayed and peyzed at certaine Ballances, and by weight vsed for that pur∣pose, and by a Stampe or Marke ordained for that purpose, sealed and allowed before the same bee put to sale within the Land, or offered to bee Shipped for Forreigne vent. And to that end also Our noble Progenitors haue beene at charge to erect and maintaine certaine Coynage houses in seuerall Townes within Our Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, lying most commodious for the said Coynage, with Ballances and Weights there, and Officers and Ministers attending that seruice. At which places at certaine dayes of Coynage and post-Coynage appointed, speciall Officers of the Stannaries doe, and haue beene wont duely to attend, to receiue, try, assay, peyze, coyne, seale and allow the said Tynne, by setting a Marke, Seale, or Stampe vpon the same. By which meanes both Wee and Our Progenitors were secured of the emption or pre∣emption and Coynage duties of the said Tynne, being ancient and vndoubted hereditarie
Reuenues annexed to Our Crowne in right of Our Duchie of Cornwall, and also the Tynne had his iust and true assay, according to the goodnesse and richnesse of it, that neither Our owne Subiects nor others might be defrauded in the buying of the same, nor yet the Subiect hindered by any vnnecessary delay in the lawfull Trading and Merchandizing thereof. And whereas out of a Princely care to cherish and maintaine the Trade and Working of such a worthie and Staple Commoditie, of so much honour and profit to this Common∣wealth, Our deare Father (of blessed memorie) did not long since take order to allow a greater price for the working and making thereof then euer was giuen before, which We haue hither-vnto continued. And Our said late Father in His life time by sad aduice, did settle the Tynne businesse in a more orderly and better course then euer before it was, aswell for the benefit of Vs, being then Prince, as for the contentment and satisfaction of Our louing Subiects, the Merchants and Pewterers of London and other places. Yet neuerthelesse We are informed, That by the secret practice and combination of sundry ill minded and couetous owners and workemen of the said Tynne and Tynne works, a great part of the said Tynne hath beene heeretofore, and daily is bought and sold, receiued, deliue∣red, and carried away vncoyned, aswell in Ships and other Vessells, which vnder colour of comming to buy Cornish Slate and Stone and such like occasions, vpon the coast of Cornwall, doe imbezill much vncoyned Tynne in Blockes, as also by Mariners and Seafaring men, who buy vp the Tynne in Barres, commonly called, Pocket Tynne, of Blowers and Mel∣ters of Tynne and others, contrary to the ancient Ordinances of Our Stannaries aforesaid, to Our preiudice and wrong in Our said Reuenue, and the disgracing of Our said Commo∣ditie and abuse of Our Subiects buying the same vntryed and not assayed. In respect whereof, as Wee might most iustly extend the rigour of Our Lawes against sundry offenders notoriously faultie in this behalfe, both against the Law and Custome of the Realme and of the Stannaries, and against Our late deare Fathers Proclamation, which in Our naturall inclination to mercy Wee haue forborne; So Wee cannot in Our Princely care of the Common-wealth and Our owne right, but prouide for redresse and reformation of these great disorders for the time to come; And finding that the Proclamation made by Our deare deceased Father, hath not wrought that good effect that was expected; We there∣fore doe by these presents straitely charge and command, aswell all and singular Our louing Subiects, as all other person and persons whatsoeuer, that none of them presume, vpon any colour, shift, or pretence whatsoeuer, at any time or times heereafter, to vtter, sell, deliuer, or put to sale, or to receiue, ship, carry, land, or contract for any Blacke Tynne vnblowne, but such as cause the same to bee cast, melted downe, and blowne and brought to the place of Coy∣nage, before it be sold for vse, nor to sell, giue, barter, or vtter any White Tynne, or Cast Tynne
before it bee first Coyned and Stamped with Our Seale or Marke appointed for that pur∣pose, as aforesaid, vpon paine of forfeiture aswell of the said Tynne, and other condigne pu∣nishment in case of land carriage, as also of confiscation of the Ships, Hoyes, Barques, Lighters, and other Vessells wherein any such prohibited Tynne shall bee shipped or laden for transportation contrary to the intendment of this Our Proclamation, and also vpon paine of Our high displeasure, and of such further penalties, forfeitures, and punishments in both cases, as by the Statutes and Ordinances of Our said Stannaries, or any other Law or Statute whatsoeuer, or by the censure of Our high Court of Starre-Chamber, for dis∣obeying this Our Royall Commandement and Iniunction, or otherwise may bee inflicted vpon the offenders in this behalfe. Giuing all Our louing Subiects to know, that any toleration or forbearance for the time past shall bee so farre from iustifying or warranting the like abuses to bee continued in time to come, as contrary wise it shall aggrauate the fault thereof in respect of Our former clemencie. And whereas Wee are giuen to vnderstand, that there are certaine wandring Pettie-Chapmen, and Tinkers and others haunting much about the Tynne workes and places of melting of Tynne, who doe make it a vsuall Trade to buy and barter Blacke Tynne by the Bowle, and White Tynne vncoyned by the pound weight, or other small quantitie, and so doe carry the same from the said places, to certaine priuate places of receipt, till hauing gotten by this vnlawfull meanes some store together, they vent or spend the said Blacke Tynne be∣fore it be blowne, and sell the said White Tynne before it be Coyned, by sea or by land where they finde best Chapmen, to the preiudice of Vs and Our louing Subiects as aforesaid: Our will and pleasure is, and Wee straitely charge and command all and singuler Our Iustices of Peace, and all the Officers and Ministers of the Stannaries, and others whom it shall or may concerne, before whom any such Tinker, Pettie-Chapman, or other person of∣fending shall bee brought, diligently to examine and finde out, where, and of whom hee had the said prohibited Tynne White or Blacke found with him, and where and to whom hee meant or intended to sell the same, or hath heeretofore sold any other of like sort: And aswell the said Tinkers and Pettie-Chapmen, as all other persons who shall bee found priuie to the buying or selling, receiuing, deliuering, or bartering of the said Tynne Blacke or White, as aforesaid, to commit to Our Gaole of the Stannarie of that Countie where they shall bee ta∣ken, and otherwise to punish them according to the Lawes, Customes, and Ordinances of Our Stannaries, as the qualitie and nature of the offence shall by the Lawes and Sta∣tutes of this Realme deserue, and for contempt of Our Royall Commandement and Procla∣mation in this behalfe. And where Wee haue lately granted to some of Our louing Subiects the emption or pre∣emption of Tynne, during a terme vnexpired, and for reliefe of poore Pewterers of the Citie
of London haue prouided, That if the said Lessees or Farmors shall be minded to transport any Tynne in Barres, they shall imploy the said Pewterers of London, or some of them that Our said Farmors shall nominate for the casting of Tynne out of Blockes into Barres, at such places as Wee shall appoint, and in default of such appointment, at such places as Our said Farmors shall appoint: Sithence which time many haue presumed to cast Tynne into Barres, both in the Counties of Cornwall and Deuon and elsewhere, which is a meanes that a great part thereof is the more easily conueyed from place to place and vented before the Coynage thereof, and others then Our Farmers haue opportunitie to transporte the same, contrary to Our agreements made with them: Wee doe straitely inhibite all persons that none of them, other then such of the Pewterers of Our Citie of London as shall bee nomi∣nated by the Farmors of the emption or preemption of Tynne, for the time being, doe pre∣sume to cast any Tynne into Barres, and that none of them cast any Tynne into Barres but in the Citie of London, And that in the same Citie none bee so cast but in such houses and places of melting as shall bee designed or allowed of by Our sayd Farmors, vpon the paines to bee inflicted vpon contemners of Our Commands in Our Court of Starre-Chamber and otherwise. Giuen at Our Court at Whitehall this two and twentieth day of Ianuary, in the ninth yeere of Our Reigne of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE, and IRELAND. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie: and by the Assignes of Iohn Bill. 1633.
