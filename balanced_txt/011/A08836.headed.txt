¶Here begynneth a goodly treatyse / and it is called / a notable lesson / otherwyse it is called the golden pystle. Im¦pressus. Anno domini. M.CCCCC.xxx.
A Good / holsome lesson & profytable vnto al chrystianes / ascrybed vnto saynt Bernarde / and put amonge his werkes [I thynke] by some good man / that wolde it shulde therby haue the more authoryte / and the rather be redde / and better be borne away. For doubtles it is a good mater / and edificatyue vnto all them that haue a zele / and cure vnto soule helthe & desyre of saluacyon. It is called in the tytle. Notabile documētum. that is to say / a nota∣ble lesson. And some done call it the goldē py∣stle. It foloweth immedyately after a lytell werke called Formula honeste vite. ye forme / and maner of an honest lyfe / or of honest ly∣uynge.
YF you intende to please god / and wolde ob∣teyne grace to fulfyll the same / two thyn∣ges ben vnto you very necessary. The fyrst. You must withdrawe your mynde from all worldly & trāsytory thȳges / in suche maner / as though you cared not wheder any suche thynges were in this worlde / or no. The secunde is. That you gyue and ap∣ply youre selfe so wholy to god / and haue youre selfe in suche a wayte / that you neuer do / say / ne thynke / yt you knowe / suppose / or byleue shulde offende or dysplease god / for by this meane / you may sonest and most redely obtayne / and wynne his fauour and grace. In all thyn∣ges esteme and acount your selfe most vyle / & most sym∣ple / and as very nought in respecte / and regarde of ver∣tue / and thynke / suppose / & byleue that all persones ben good / & better than you be / for so shall you moche please our lorde. What so euer you se / or seme to {per}ecyue / in any person / or yet here of any chrystyane / take you none occa¦sion therin / but rather ascrybe / & apply you all vnto the best / & thynke or suppose / all is done or sayde for a good intent / or purpose / though it seme contrary. For mannes suspicions and lyght iudgmentes ben soone / and lyght∣ly deceyued / or begyled. Dysplease no person wyllyng∣ly. Ne euer speke euyll of any person / though it were ne∣uer so true yt you say. For it is not lawfull to shewe in cō¦fession ye vyce / or defaute of any {per}son / excepte you myght otherwyse shewe & declare your owne offence. Speke lytell or nought vnto your {pro}pre / & selfe laude / or prayse / thoughe it were true / and vnto your famylyer felowe / or feythfull frēde. But study to kepe secrete / and pryuey your vertue / rather than your vyce. Yet were it a cruell dede for any {per}sons to defame them selfe. Be more gladde
to gyue your eare / & herynge vnto the prayse / rather thā vnto the dysprayse of any person. And euer byware as well of herynge / as spekynge of detraccyon. And whan you speke / take good deliberacion / & haue fewe wordes / & let those be true / and good: sadly set & wysely ordred. Yf any wordes be spoken vnto you of vyce / or vanyte (as soone as you may) breke of / & leue ye talke / or cōmunyca∣cion. And euer returne / and apply your selfe vnto some appoynted good / & godly occupacyon / bodyly / or ghost∣ly. Yf any soden chaunce fall or happe vnto you / or vnto any of youres / leyne not to lyghtly ther vnto / ne care moch therfore. Yf it be of {pro}sperite / reioyce not moch ther¦in / ne be ouer glad therof. Yf it be aduersite / be not ouer∣cast / or ouerthrowen therwt / ne brought to sorowe / or sad¦nes / thanke god of all / & set lytle therby. Repute all thȳ∣ges transytorye: as of lytle pryce or valure. Gyue euer most thought / & care vnto those thynges / yt may profyte & promote ye soule. Fle / & auoyde ye persones / & places of moche speche / for better is to kepe scylēce / than to speke. Kepe ye tymes & places of scilēce precysely / so yt you speke not wtout reasonable & vnfeyned cause. The tymes of sci¦lēce in religion bē these. From collacion vnto masse be en¦ded after ye houre of terce. Frō ye fyrst grace ī ye fraytour / vnto ye ende of ye later grace. And frō ye begȳnynge of euē long / vnto grace be ended after sou{per} / or els En̄dicite / af∣ter ye cōmune bouer. The places of scilēce / ben: ye churche & ye claustre / ye fraytour & ye dortour. Yf you ye sclaūdred / & done take occasyon at ye faute / or offence of any person / than loke well vpon youre selfe / wheder you be in the same defaute sumtyme your selfe / & than haue cōpassion vpon your brother / or syster. Yf ther be none suche defaut in you / thȳke verely / & byleue / ther may be / & thā do: as
done soone fade / and fle for euer. The good persones / for theyr troubles suffred here vpon erthe: done get & wȳne eterne & euerlastynge glorye / whiche the euyll persones done lose. And contrary these euyll / & synfull persones / for theyr ioy & pleasures here / done reyue by exchaunge eterne & euerlastynge shame / & rebuke wt peyne / & wo vn¦specable. Whan so euer thā you ben dysposed to slugysh∣nes / or to be drowsy / remysse in prayer / or dull in deuocy¦on: thā take this lytle werke / or some other good treaty / & rede therin / & euer note well the contentes therof / and what is ment therby. And yf you be not therby delyue∣red or eased therof / than shyfte vnto some other werke / or occupacyon / so yt euer you auoyde ydlenes / & al vayne pastymes / whiche in dede ben lose tyme. And than remē¦bre that those that nowe byde in peyne / other in hell / or yet in purgagory for suche tymes so passed / or lost / had leuer thā all ye worlde / haue suche tyme to redeme theyr peynes by / as you may haue yf you wyl. Tyme thā vn¦to al {per}sones wel ocupied / is veray precious / & dere. By∣ware well therfore: how you spende it / or passe it. For you can neuer reuoke it / nor call it bakke. Yf the tyme passe you by trouble / & vexacyon / thynke they ben hap∣py / and gracyous that ben past this wretched lyfe / and nowe in blys / for they shall neuer haue any suche mise∣rye. And whan you fele a conforde or consolacyon spyry∣tuall / thanke god therof / & thynke the dampned soules shall neuer haue any suche pleasure. And thus let this be for your exercyse in the datyue. At nyght whan you go rest / fyrst make a counte wt your selfe / & remēbre how you haue spende / or passed yt day & tyme / yt was gyuen you to be vsed in vertue / & how you haue bystowed your thoughtes / your wordes / and your werkes. And yf you
fynde no great thynge amys / gyue the whole laud and prayse vnto our lorde god. And yf you perceyue cōtrary / that you haue mysspende any parte therof / be sory ther∣fore / and byseche our lorde of mercy / and forgyuenesse / & promyse and verely purpose to make amendes the nexte day. And yf you haue portunyte ther vpon / it shalbe full conuenyent for you to be cōfessed on the nexte morowe. And specyally yf ye mater done / sayde / or thought by de∣liberate consent / do greuously wey / & worke wt a grudge in your conscyēce: than wolde I aduyse you neuer to ete nor drynke / tyll you be dyscharged therof / yf you may cō¦uenyently get a ghostly father. Now for a conclusyon of this werke / put byfore you / as by case or ymaginacyon. ij. large cytyes / one full of trouble / turmoyle / and myse∣rye / and let that be hell. The other cyte full of ioye / glad∣nes / conforte / and pleasure / and let that be heuen. Loke well on them bothe / for in bothe be many dwellers / and great compeny. Then cast and thynke within your selfe what thynge here myght so please you that you shulde chuse ye wors cyte / or what thynge shulde dysplease you on the other parte / wherby you shulde withdrawe your selfe from that vertue that myght cōuaye & brynge you vnto the other cyte. And whan you haue studyed well here vpon / and can nothynge fynde / I dare well assure you yf you kepe well the preceptes and coūseyles of this lytle lesson / you shall fynde the ryght way / for the holy ghost wyll instructe / & teche you where you be not suffy¦cyent of your selfe / so you endeuoyre & gyue dylygēce / to bere away & to folowe that here is taught. Rede it euery weke ones / or twyse / or oftener yf you wyll. And where you profyte / gyue thankes / laude / and prayse vnto oure lorde god / & most swete sauyour Iesu chryst / who sende
you his mercy and grace / that alway lyueth god. In se∣cula seculorum. Amen. ¶This was brought vnto me in englysshe of an olde translacyon rugh / and rude / and requyred to amende it. I thought lesse labour to wryte newe the whole / and I haue done vnto the sentence not very nere the letter / and in dyuers places added some thynges folowynge vpon the same to make the mater more sentencyous / and full. I byseche you take all vnto the best / and praye for the olde wretched brother of Syon Rychatde Whytforde. ¶Imprȳted by me Wynkyn de Worde / dwellynge in London / in Flete strete / at the sygne of the Sonne.
