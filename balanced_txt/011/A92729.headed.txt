THE SCOTS MIST, Yet gathering To wet English-men to the skinne; OR The people and Souldiers observations on the Scots Declaration to the Parla∣ment of England. Jul 1648. Compared with Their former observations on the Scots Message November 1647. And both of them, wth The Scotts present invasion of England, by a great Army of old Souldiers and Irish Rebells, for all our goods, to be forci∣bly maintained on the spoyle and ruins of the people: For establishing 1. Themselves, their Wives, children and servants in all places of England, where they can be able to subdue and keep. 2. The King (or Duke Hamleton) on his Royall Thron. 3. Their cruell and severe (but not true nor sincere) Religion, with a Priest in every Parish, if not the late 26 bloudy Bishops (which were degraded) for all. IT seemeth (dear brethren) that either yee have not duy con∣sided, or very suddenly forgotten, those observations (con∣taining many just admonitions and needfull reprehensions) which we the people and Souldiers of England, (different from you in judgment and practice) divulged in print, to shew your great inconstancy, ingratitude, injustice, double dealing and self-seeking (in divers respects) by that your Mssage to the Parliament of England, Nov. 5. 1647. (also in print) concer∣ning
a Personall Treaty with the King, and to bring him with ho∣nour and safety to one of his houses in or near London, that he may be restored to the dignity of his Predicessors. Wherein your manifold grosse corruptions, misapprehensi∣ons, dissimulations, unreasonable demands, and unwise resolu∣tions, were truly and clearly (though briefly) discovered, which if ye had well, duly and timely pondered, and layed to heart, ye would have found farre more urgent cause to have been truly sorrowfull for, and to have quite desisted from such un∣godly, corrupt, inconstant and foolish courses, then thus to have insisted both in more bitter expressions, and more violent acti∣ons, as well by a new declaration, according to the scope of that corrupt Message, and by entring England (in a coloured way of invasion) with a new Army (composed of the most popish blou∣dy crew, and prophaine abjects of your deluded and enslaved Nation) for all our guds; even to force out of us by violence, what ye cannot procure by other indirect meanes; which ye say is for establishing your Presbyterian Religion in England, and your gracious King on his Royall throne, according to your Nationall Covenant. Well, seing he who was the wisest of mankind, doth not forbid to answer those who are naturaly foo∣lish, (which otherwise we call simple or Idiots) according to their foolishnes or simplicity, lest we should be like them, nei∣ther biddeth us answer such uncapable men, lest they should be wise in their own conceits, but he instructeth only how to deale with those whom God had indeed with sufficient abilities, and yet do use all to sinister and contrary ends: so that his words do imply as much as if he should say, whatsoever is spoken (or otherwise expressed) more out of self-love, flattery or corrup∣tion, then out of prudence, sincerity and discretion, deserveth ra∣ther silence then any answer, otherwise then by way of reproof, lest the answerers should be as self-seeking, dissembled and cor∣rupt as the speakers. But his words immediatly following these, do also imply that these or such purposes being boldly insisted on by such parties, some kind of punctuall, breif and sharp answer is to be proportioned to them, according to the sense and scope of their words, lest they should be puffed up in their own fond conceits, and imagine their own Councels to be like Achitophels Oacles,
and so unanswerable, that they will be (as ready as he was) to build castles in the ayre, So upon the same ground we thus deal justly & plainly with you: for what greater folly or foolishnes, yea or madnes can be in the world, then that ye who not only know and professe, but in some measure practise many parts of truth, justice and freedom, though after a corrupt and confused manner, and have not only tasted, but like your forefathers a∣boundantly drunke both in soul and body, that bitter cup of ty∣ranny & oppression even to the very dreggs. And now although (through Gods undeserved mercy) ye b left free in things spirituall, and made free in things temporall, yet ye are so brutish and Sottish (yea and in this respect we may now say Scottish) that ye are so far from standing fast in those liberties, as not only content to be entangled your selves & your posterities again, with the yoaks both of Antichristian and monarchicall bondage, but most maliciously both fight to be slaves your selves, and force all with your sharp swords, whom you cannot delude with your smooth words, as well of this Na∣tion as of your own, & as well to fight as contribute to be such miserable slaves, beggars, spectacles of shame, & objects of pitty with you, that neither ye nor any whom ye so overcome, shall dare to say or do any thing, but what may agree with the in∣constant humours of your wicked Governours, and time serving teachers, yea not so much as to affirme and maintaine, that ei∣ther your soules, bodies, lives, wives, children, families, estates, trades or livelyhoods, are your own; but are all your most Ex∣cellent, good and gracious Soveraigns, whom now again (though most bloudy and wicked) ye so Idolize and adore, that its too apparent, ye love fear and respect more then God. Yee, (at least the honest party amongst you) ran well a while, but who did let you that ye would not proceed and obey the truth, but are weary of wel-doing, and not finish your work; ye seemed at first to be a patterne to us and other Nations, as in∣deed we followed many of your actions, untill we saw your ma∣nifold dissimulations; that all your most glorious beginning in the spirit, endeth most ignominiously in the flesh. Its certaine, the whole frame of your building standeth on three pillars, which howsoever they may seem strong in them∣selves, yet seing the strongest of them (as pretending to support the other two) namely your Nationall Covenant, hath but a
sandy foundation (& not the firm rock Christ) the other two, namely Presbyteriall and Monarchiall Government, have but a rotten foundation; therefore it wilbe but the just fruits of your own labours, if the whole fabrick of your glorious Reformati∣on fall only about your own cares, and not smother others: for from that great and unparalelled text, your Nationall Cove∣nant, your Clergy by their words, and ye by your deeds, yea & all your confederates here amongst us also by your example, have in all the troubles of these distressed and enslaved Nations, raised all your high and mysticall Doctrines for King and Par∣liament, and made all your profitable usefull and notable apply∣cations for men, menyes, plunder and taxes: Oh hypocrites, that tith the Mint and the Annis and the Cumin, and yet leave the greater matters of the law (even justice and judgment) undone; But God knoweth how to catch you in your moneths, even when ye are heavy in your iniquities, and ready for the sharp sickle of his judgments, though he now permit you to run on in your croked waies, & do what seemeth good in your own eyes! Ye say in your Declaration [Iuly 1648. pag. 25. line 10) that the principall cause of your engagment (in assisting our Nation against the King and his forces) was the establish∣ing of your Religion, ye know there is a Proverb, Malm esse probus, quam haberi, Its better to be good, then estemed god; surely if you were either as good or gody (as appears by your practice) ye desire to be esteemed, yee would rather put your religion to tryall, as the Apostle Paul himself did his doctrine to the Beans judgment, then either engage, desire of urge any religion or worship to be established, but wa is both fined & refined like Gideons Army, purged and repurged like pure gold, as both the whole bick of the Temple, was built according to the direction of Gods word, and the Taberncle according to the pattern shwed in the Mount. Ye cannot deny, but your rligion (whereof you so much boast and make such a doe) is only a humane statue religion, smlling far more of mans humane devics hen of Gods divine laws; for tis said in your Confession of Fah (as either gnorantly o unjust∣ly ye are pleasd to intie:) wich was printed at you firs op∣posing of the Service-book, and renewing your forcd Covenant, which is (there at first inserted) that in the 69. Act or Statute of
the 6 Parliament of King Iames the sixt, there is no other Religion, nor face of a Kirk, (meaning in the world, but yours in Scotland) and therefore it is alwaies stiled Gods true Religion, Christs true Re∣ligion, the true and Christian Religion, and a perfect Religion: and upon that most absurd principle, and corrupt foundation of a King and Parliaments Votes, lawes, acts or sttatuts, thus to praise a reli∣gion either of your own or other mans framing) all of whatsoever estate or degree, are commanded under all highest temporall penal∣ties as well as Church censures, that either Sathan or man can devise (as is there particularly exprest) to submit unto that our so much boasted off Religion; as the Angel of the Church of Laicea (who was neither cold nor hot) boasted of his riches, and needed no thing, and yet knew not that he was wretched and miserable, and poore, and blind and naked; so it appeareth (by the greatnes of the penalties inflicted upon the despisers of that wicked decree) that in divers (respects) it is no lesse dangerous to refuse submission to your cruell Scots Religion, then it was to refuse kneeling and fal∣ling down before Nebuchadnezars glden Image. Touching your Monarchicall Gvernment, namely, To re-esta∣blish your grcious King on his Royall Throne, and to restre his most excelt Majesty to his former greatnes; and for these ends, that His highnes sacred person, may be brought wth honour and safety to one of his houses in or near London, whom ye pray, may no ony have a long and prosperus raign, but that he want not one of his seed to sit up∣on his hrone wh lst the Sun and Moone endureth, as may be gather∣ed in divers places of your Declaration according to that corrupt, base, hypocriicall, flattering and time-serving forme of prayer, used by the false, rotten, Episcopall and popish Clergy in theit u∣suall payers after Sermons, as they daily both flattered him and infomed God of his high and lofy titles & Royall prerogatives over all persons, caes, and the like wordes before sermons; he scope o these words is so pin, that there needeth no explicaion, further en his observation. It evidently appeareth by these & the like, your and your con∣feder hpcitcall and decitfll pactces, at ye intend to trample under tooe, and (as it were) cast into the gea Ocean, all the invble bud which hath been spilt, and Oces both of treasures and states which have been spent in these  warrs, & never to call the cheif author thereof, and grand enmy of our peace nor any others of his cursed crue, how bloudy, cul, tyrannicall
and wicked soever he and they have been to any account, but to spare both him and them all, as Saul spared Agag King of Amalck with the fat beasts, and as Ahab spared Benhadad King of Assyria, which cost them both their lives & estates, al matters are so whee∣led about, if God by a powerfull hand and out-stretched Arme, as he did proud Senacribs hoast humble not your pride, and lay both your flattering of tyrants, and railing on peaceable Christians in the dust, who have thus taken up Armes againe, and confederated both to spare him, though ye smart even by himself for so doing, and with English and Jrish Rebels, either to destroy or enslave us, and all who will not both submit to you, and partake with you, now after it hath pleased God to go forth so often with our Ar∣mies, and not only to make him our prisoner, but to grant us so many victories over him and all your brethren in evill, the popish Cavaliers, our most open, bloody, cruell & profest enemies. And as touching your other three desires, reasons and grounds of your undertakings expressed at the end of your Declaration, concerning the Parliament of Englands freedom, and with your consent, to conclude by a Personall Treaty with his Majesty. Next concerning the pressing forward the City of Londons propositions, which were presented to the King at Oxford, and thirdly, concern∣ing the disbanding the Army of Sectaries, under the Command of Thomas Lord Fairfax, we intend not here to insist, neither to fol∣low you in any of your wavering relations, nor wandering repeti∣tions of any matters or occurrences, throughout the corrupt body or confused masse of your Declaration, to no good, true nor solid purpose, but for your own sinister ends, and to beat the aire with aboundance of empty and flattering words, to deceive the simple, as your deceitfull Clergy have cheated and abused you, though many of them now who seem to be somwhat, do dissent; which is far more for their own ends then the publick good, they consi∣dering that if any Army came into England, it wolud be a speciall means with the like English party, to bring home the King, who doubtlesse will set up Bishop over them again, and so put them all out of their Benefices, even from teaching ancient people the Bible, to teach young Schollers the horn-book. Only one word concerning the Army of Sectaries; in one of K. James his large & eloquent speeches at his coming into England as they stand upon record, he calleth those who held the like true prin∣ciples then, by the title Puritans, and a sect not fit to live in a Com∣mon-wealth,
as he used somtimes upon other occasions to curse, when he should have blest, yea and to absolve the wicked, and condemne the just: and the cheif cause that moved him so to expresse his unjust judgment, was because some Puritan ministers in Scotland, had lately before his departure thence, reproved him of diverse bloudy cruelties and oppressions; and therefore he so soone as he was come into En∣gland, (instead of all the long expected, and so much petitioned Re∣formation) he both contiuned Bishops in England, and sett them up in Scotland; The prophaine Courtiers also before these troubles, changed the title Puritans into Roundheads; and ye (as ye do now) at your first Armies comming into England, called them Sectaries, as your Black-coats taught you when ye said, that Papists, Separatists nor Sectaries should be no more mentioned, at the conclusion of that Paper, which ye intitled, Your lawfulnes in coming into England. Now for the word, Sectary, and sometimes Schismatick, which yee are pleased to attribute in your Declaration, not only to those of our people whom ye intend to destroy, as wicked Cain did good Abell, not for any evill, that ever they did to you or others, but that they excell both your Clergy & you in the best things; but likewise, to that most victorious, and renowned Army it self, who have both formerly and now (by divine providence) trod under foot many thousands of your roaring, swearing and domineering brethren (in evill,) the Popish Cavaliers. With whom though ye have confederated for that pur∣pose, by your Clergies direction, because they well know, that none knowes their falshood and deceit so well, as those whom they will have the people (by their exmple) to call Sectaries & Schismaticks: So that by their means, ye have like Saul gone to the Witch at Endor, & raised those damming & devouring Devills whom ye will hardly ever lay againe, without better help then your selves, till your heads be laid low in the dust. Although we cannot justly call you the greatest Sectaries or Schismaticks your selvs, because ye had never that grace (or true honour) to be Members of any true visible Church of Christ, and so could never Schism or rent from it, yet we may e∣steeme you the greatest hypocrites & dissemblers in the world, because ye not only thus pretend to be Members of such a Church, that there is none so good in the world, but to reform both your selve & all others, as well in this nation as your own, and yet, so far as can be seen or judged by your words or deeds, do intend to deform both your selves & all others, whom ye can either perswad by your subtile words or compel by your bloody swords, never remembring that that great & cheif ordinance of love, alloweth the same measure to be given to all, as it wisheth and expecteth to be received from all.
If these just admonitions & reprehensions be not sufficient, to reclaim you from your evill waies, but that you will proceed from evill to worse, and still make up the measure of you iniquities, & neither remember that grievous pestilence, which swept away so many thousands, & ten thousands of you the last year from the face of the earth, nor Montross his devouring svvord, nor other of his & your confederats, which shed so much bloud amongst you, nor any other of Gods fearfull judg∣ments, which he threatneth upon these sinfull nations, especially famie & desola∣tion, doubtles it may please the same God so to decide between you & these whom ye call sectaries, and are so eager (according to your frced Covenant) o destroy, though they never gave you any just cause, that he will make either them or some othes his instruments, in causing you to drink that full cup of indignation, to the very dreggs your selves, which ye thus so unjustly prepare for others. And in the mean time (utll that time come) what think ye of that small third part of the Army of Sectarie (ince the half was disbanded by your & your confede∣ras means) who welcomed your Army now into England, are they not pretty men, have they not a just cause, and is n Haman ho would so faine destroy Mordecai, now begun to fall befr him? Have ye not broken your own solemn Covenant with our Nation, by bringig man rmy to invade us & or Parliament, by authority of your Parliament? s this a brotherly or neighbourly affectin any wise answe∣rable to our great love and esp ct towards you, manifsted in the geat  of monies & kind entertainment many waies ye hav all these toublesom times re∣ceived of us. Can ye, or dare ye with a good coscience deny, but ye pass the bounds of civility as well as Christianity, in these & many other your practices, whatsoever ye pretend by your words; and therefore is it no just with God, that ye who would devoure so many husands of those who never so much as wished you harm, (but did you all the good they could, both at your first incoming, and long before) should destroy thousands of you now in their own defence? If ye had as many thousand prisoners of the sectaries, as they have of you, would ye not indeed cut them off, (according to your tith-mongers instruction) rather then take any oher lawfull or humane course to save their lives. And do ye not both see & sele the immdiate hand of God against you in this their and all their friends miraculous deliverances from your & your confederats bloody cruelties, even by many victories over you & them, though for a while ye seemed as ye under∣took to be for us For as he is the Lord f Hoasts & God of battells, so he usually goeth forth with all who fight in a good cause, yea & getteth the greatest glory to himself, when he hath fwst to take his part, as appeared in Gidions 300 against the great hoast of the Midinites. Thus the premisses being considered, instead of any further mentioning of your rotten popish, flattering, base & slavish Decla∣ration not worthy of any kind of answering, were it not for a little abating of your insolency & haughtimes, and that ye should not be still wise in your own conceits, neher alwaies subdue & smother the good motions & honest endeavours of the dissentig party amongst you, by your corrupt means, we refert both you & all of our ation & else where who have most need, to take into serious consideration, nt only these observations, but likewise our former observations on your corrupt Message to the Parliament of England Nov. 1647, as tending both to one & the same end; which therefore (in regard of the occurreneces since, as the matter seems now to be more reasonable, so the time also is more seasonable then for∣merly) do follow here in order.
