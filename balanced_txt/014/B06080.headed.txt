THE THREE Buxome Maids of Yoel: OR, The Pleasant Entreague betwixt them and a Country Sive-maker, who left a large Reckning to pay for their Pissing in the Sive. To the Tune of, The Guinny wins her. Licensed according to Order. PRay listen to this Ditty, for it will make you merry, Three Lasses fair and pretty, was treated with canary, In-Yoel by a loving Friend, Who, it seems, did cry, Did Sides to mend; a jolly bonny Blade, and as he cry'd his trade, it was his chance to meet, these Lasses in the street, which he resolv'd to tread With wine for they were in come, bri and fine. The first was mincing Sarah, the second buxome Betty, The third young modest Marry, all Lasses fair and pretty; With him they to a Tavern went; For to spend the day in sweet content; the Side-maker and they, would froliek, sport and play, and call for liquour store, making the Tavern roar; the Side-maker he swore That he, would tickle there above the knee. Brisk Betty did not fear him, but bid him use his pleasure, And straight the sat down near him, he kill her out of measure; At which young Sarah seem'd to frown, And her tears in sorrow trickl'd down, because he kist her first, who was the very worst; But pretty Girls, said he, let's lovingly agree, and do not press on me So fast, I'll serve you all alike at last. Quoth Mary, I admire your tender kind embraces, It hithtens our desire, when we are joyning faces; By true experience this I know, Therefore I declare before we go, the Side-maker shall be, both loving, kind and free. Sweet Lasses, he reply'd, nothing shall be deny'd, if with a flowing tide You'll fill, this Sive here with your water-mill. Bess knew it must he vented, she was not for denying, The rest likewise consented, their flood-gates they let flying; He held the Sive, they pour'd it in, Betty's engine play'd above his chin, and blinded both his eyes, he in a passion cries, I can't endure the smart, it cuts me to the heart; with that he did depart Away, and left them all the shot to pay. They laught to see him scour, and call'd for more canary; Then waiting there an hour, at length quoth modest Mary, I fear that he will come no more, Therefore let us call to knew the score; to this they straight agreed, the Drawer came with speed, and cry'd without delay, you must ten shillings pay, before you go your way, 'Tis true, this made the Lasses all look ble. Tho' joys they had been reaping, yet seeing they were worsted, Poor Girls, they feel a weeping, and wanted to be trusted; The Drawer he began to rave, He would present satisfaction have; they having then no stock, Each Damsel pawn'd her smook, which was of dowlas fine; to pay for bread and wine, then went away at nine, And swore, they'd never piss in Sives no more.
