The Vale Mans Table. ¶Herein is taught euen for the ca∣pacity of the meanest, howe to draine Moores, & al other wet grounds or bogges, and lay them dry for euer. Howe to measure without an instrument any roufe grounde, woode, or water, that you cannot come into. Also here is annexed the compasse and the scale, with part of the vse of the sayde com∣passe, and the computation of yeares from VVilliam the Conqueror. TO THE READER. WHereas diuers ignoraunt in A∣rethmaticke and Geomatrie, thinke it a hard thing to describe that smal worke of mine, intituled the Terrar, which I set foorth the last yeare, 1582. And the rules thereof so hard, that they cannot be learned without tedious trauel. Truely (gentle Reader) were it not for the ob∣scure words of Art, they were most pleasant & easie. And for proofe thereof if thou canst but reade: I haue appointed one whome you may hear off, at the signe of the Lamb near Clemēts Inne, who shall teach thee so much Arethma∣ticke, and Geomitry in one day, hauing a good capasity, as shall describe the sayde Terrar, the Map of a Country, or any such like worke, with the vse of the scale. And also he will teach thee any thing mentioned in it, to be taught with as much expedition as thou wouldest wishe. Con∣demn me not before thou hast tried me, & then report as thou findest me. I know some that would haue none cunning but them selues, who would make mountaynes of their mould hilles. Such will smoothly laugh me to scorne. But I trust the modest minded by proofe will be wit∣nesses of my truth. And as touching the rest of the twentye and fiue deuises which I offer to teach in the sayd Terrar, I promise thee, there is not one amongst them all, but is as easie to be learned as any of the workes herein described VVherefore let not wordes of Art dismay thee, nor those that would haue all men ignorant but them selues discourage thee: but lay hold on slip pery time, which once mispent may no way be reuolked. And consider with the Ant, that som∣mer haruest, wil prouide both foode and fyer for winter cold. And thus fare well in Christ. From Paines End, the 16. of Nouember. 1583. VVhereas the sayd Terrar was solde for two shillinges six pence, contrary to the Aucthours minde, from hence foorth they shall be sold by retaile for sixe pence a peece, you maye haue them at my Printers. How to  auel of any at, is de in the making of ponds vpon high & dry groūds by me already published in print. VVhich skill is needefull for them that will drayne bogs and weate groundes, for the better finding of the most conuenient currant, to conuay the water away. It is learned with twice reading ouer of tenne lines. The compasse. compass rose Note that this figure is set in moste Maps, to describe the windes, viz. The North south, East, and VVest quarters with their parts. The North point marked with the flower Deluse, common¦ly standing with the face, or vpper part of the Mappe. So by this compasse to any worke an∣nexed, you may know how it lieth, remembring that the point marked with the flower Deluce standeth North. Then tourning your face with that point you shall looke into the North. So is your back South, your right hand East, and your left hand, VVest. THE cankred Carle in fertil soyle, which doth much ground possesse, And suffereth not the Plough-mans toile, his lande to take and dresse. Nor yet himselfe conuert the same, vnto his Countries vse, Deserueth well the shamefull name, of common-weales abuse. And to a Dog I him compare, that in the Manger lies; Which labouring Stead from prouen share by barking he denies. Yet will not eate of that himselfe, whereof poore Stead is glad. Such members vile in common wealth, were better lost then had. To draine wet grounds. First draw a straite ditch, one foote deepe, and foure inches broad, in the most conuenient place of your ground. Then draw from your straite ditch two pearch a sunder, slope drayners as this figure doth represent. Dig them one foot deepe at the least, and one foote broad in the bottome, and not aboue two in∣ches broade at the top, so will the top close vp againe, and the bottome will be hol∣low, wherin the water will soake into the straite ditch: which ditch, you must fill with stones, or great grauell, and so must you fill fiue foote of the endes of the sloape drai∣ners next to the straite diche, and if stones be plentie to fill the drainers throughout vvith stones is best. VVhere you fil them with stones, you may couer them with thick turff, and make it playn, so shal you lose no ground The charges for 10. Acres, is but 26. shil. 8. pence, besides carriages, vvhich charges, the earth that you cast out of the ditch and drayners, being wel spred, wil counteruail for the manuring of the ground. To draine Bogs. In the firme ground within two yardes of the bog, draw a ditch from the highest part a long by the bogs side, as the currant goeth and continue your ditch vntill it commeth out at naught, as here is debscribed. Make your ditch as narrow as you can, dig it one foote lower then the spring which feedeth the bog. Then fill your ditch two foot thicke with stones, and vpon the stones, throw in the earth, and couer the top with turffe which you digged out of the ditch, so shall you spoyle no ground, and the water, which was the cause of the Bogge, wil alter his course and runne in the ditch among the stones, and in short time the Bogge will sinke, and prooue firme, and very fruiteful ground. How to measure a wood, and not to come into it. Drawe adioyning to the water or wood whereof you would, knovv the contents either a square, a long square or a triangle, such as you may most cōueniently include your desired piece into. Then measure the vvhole plat, and from the contents therof: deduct the ouerplus, as for example in this long square herafter described. The vvhol contents is 60. Acres, vvherof you must deduct 3. acres for the long square at the East end, 5 Acres for the right triangle on the Southvvest part, and 14. for the blunt tri∣angle on the North side. So testeth for the contentes of the vvood 38. Acres. The perfect vse of the scale may be learned by him that can not reade, hauing a good capacity, in the space of 3. houres▪ yet by it are most straunge vvorkes done, vvhich to the ignorant seeme vnpossible. It is necessary that it be taught by demon∣strations for a little shewing in this cause is a great deale better then much reading. The Scale.   20   60   100 A Computation of yeares, from William the Conquerour. Wherein you may finde the year of our Lord, the Dominicall letter, the leape yeare, the names of the Kings successiuely, vvhat day they began, hovv long they did raigne, vvith the daies of their deathes. The dates of Recordes, or euidence, and of vvhat continuance they be: as for example. I haue a lease for 99. yeares, from Michaelmas, in the 10. yeare of King Henrie the 7. The question is, howe many yeares are to come in the saide lease at Michaelmas 1583. First seeke King Henrie the 7. and then the tenth yeare of his raigne, which you shall finde in the yeare of our Lorde 1494. The which number substract out of 1583. So shall you finde 89. yeares past, and tenne yeares to come. If you cannot substract, then tel from 1494, vntill you come vnto 1583. And you shall finde as is aforesaid, and thus for all others.
