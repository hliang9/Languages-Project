Vpon his Lordships Election of Chancellor of the Vniversity of Oxford. My LORD, WHen Studies now are blasted, and the times Place us in false lights, and see Arts as Crimes, When to heape knowledge is but thought to fil The mind with more Advantage to doe ill: When all your honoured Brothers choyce and store Of Learn'd Remaines with sweat and charge fetchtore, Are thought but uselesse Peeces: and some trust To see our Schooles mingled with Abby dust. That now you dare receive us, and professe Your selfe our Patron, makes you come no lesse, Then a new Founder; whilst wee all allow, What was Defence before, is Building now. And this you were reserv'd for, set a part For times of hazard; as the Shield and Dart Laid up in store to be extracted thence, When serious need shall aske some try'd Defence; And who more fit to manage the Gownes cause Then you, whose even life may dare the Lawes, And the Law-makers too: in whom the Great Is twisted with the Good as Light with Heat; What though your sadder cares doe not professe To find the Circles squaring, or to guesse How many sands within a grayne or two Will fill the world, these speculations doe Steale man from man; You'r he that can suggest True Rules, and fashion manners to the best: You can preserve our Charters from the wrongs Of the untaught Towne, as farre as now the tongue Doth from their understanding, You can give Freedome to men, and make that freedome live; And divert hate from the now hated Arts, These are your great endowments, these your parts, And 'tis our honest Boast, when this wee scan, Wee give a Title, but receive a Man. Your Lordships most honoured humble Servant William Cartwright. Printed for T. W. 1641.
