The Lamb & his day proclaimed. THe Kingdome of God is at hand, which comes not with observation, salvation is near unto all that will receive it, redemption is coming in a time unexpected, and delive∣rance in a way not known, as a thief in the dark is the heir come, whose light out of darkness is shining, and that which shineth out of darkness is it alone that giveth the knowledge of God, whom to know is life eternal; and the brightness of the day of God is springing forth of darkness as the morning sun after the darkness of the night, and glorious is this day of the revelation of God, to all them that have waited for his coming, who in the life of his power▪ through the obedience in his love, come to rejoyce in his dominion over all the pow∣ers of darkness for ever, and sound forth the dreadful day of his power unto all the inhabitants of the earth▪ from the which, Christ the Saviour comes to take peace, and to bing the sword of Gods judgments into the bowels of all the earthly minded, and in him that judgeth the secrets of all mens hearts, doth his followers rejoyce, and proclaim him unto you all that makes an end of sin, who of the father of love and mercy is tendred unto all that will receive him, that in him who condemns the evil deeds and sin in the flesh, salvation might be attained unto who now comes unto his own, of whom many receive him not for he is come to judge the world whom God so loved that he gave his son the light of the world, that whosoever believe in him (by whom the secrets of all hearts are, and shall be judged) may be saved from wrath to come, and find a sure hiding place, when the wicked shall be cut off the earth. And now who will receive the Lamb, in whose mouth there is no guile, who among the sons of men will receive him that hath been slain from the foundation of the world, who will receive him that is the gift of God which is perfect, who will receive him that is a man of sorrowes, whose beauty is hid from the prudent of the earth, who will receive him that the Priests cry out against and the rulers say away with him from the earth, who will come unto the waters of life and return unto the fountain of living mercies, that in his belly the springs of life may be felt: who can endure to follow him to the end of the world, whose Kingdome is not of this world, and who receiveth not honour of men, who can hear, receive, and keep the hard sayings, and drink his blood that cleanseth from all sin, who is willing to receive him that is the resurrection and the life, whose presence troubled and terrified his own Disciples so that their hearts burned with∣in them, who will lay down their Crowns at the foot of him that is the light, and mourn over him that is slain whom they have pierced, and through patience, long suffering, and obedience, follow the one Shepheard in the regeneration even unto them is the word of consolation sent. Therefore be ye awakned O all ye rulers and people, let not your hearts be hardned against Gods witness in you neither stop your ears, nor close your eyes, for ofa truth the Lord is at hand, and is Come to cry you, wih his loving kindness and with his judgments. His flock despised of men, hath he sent in the meekness of his love, to preach the innocent life of his son among you, in meekness, patience, sufferings and tribulations, who being reviled, revileth not again, but in patience enduring long imprisonments, yea want and sickness there, and abuses, cruel mockings, stonings in the street dayly, and revilings by ungodly persons, whose cruelty is increased and their sins multiplied increasing to the day or judgment, and righteous revelation of Gods wrath upon all unrighteousness of men, who hold his truth in that which is not his righteousness, which is now brought near unto all that fear, before him in uprightness of heart, that truth in the inward parts they might come to know, and in it worship the God of the spirits of all flesh And all you people that are meek and tender, who have been taught by the Priest▪ and not by the Lord, whose mercy to the humble abideth for ever, the Lord God Almighty hath so loved you, that he hath provided a better Teacher for you, which shall not be removed and a Priest that abideth for ever, and a Bishop for your souls, and behold he is no less then a King yea he ruleth over Kings, and help is laid upon him, who is mighty, and he is able to save, and he is so willing to do it that he hath laid down his life for that end▪ and he standeth at the door and knocks, and he that knocks is called the word, and the word is as a hamer, and the word is in the heart where Christ is to be received, and where this knocks for entrance, and it knocks against sin and in him is no sin, and he cometh to save you from sin, and to lead you the way to the Father; and without money doth he ever teach, nay he giveth abundantly unto all that are taught by him, and that more then mortal riches, and you may have him to be with you alwaies for ever, and he can resolve all your doubts, and satisfie every one, and replenish the weary, and nourish the faint, and in him are all Gods treasures, of the which by him you may come to pertake for ever, and he himself is as a treasure in thy field, but hid from thee, which I have found in the earthen ves∣sel, and declare it unto thee, that thy fallow ground may be ript up to find the Pearl, for this is neer unto thee, and the motion of it is against thy sin, the beauty whereof thou can never see, un∣till to it thou come to hearken. H. S. This being written in true love and simplicity of heart, for the good of all people. Printed for M. W. in the year 1661.
