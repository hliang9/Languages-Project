TO THE PEO∣PLE of REDBVRNE in the Countie of Hartford. BRrethren, as heretofore I furnished you with a short Catechisme: so now for your further pro∣fiting in the means of your saluation, I haue reuiew∣ed the same, and added to it a briefe ex∣position of the ten Commandements, & of the Articles of the Faith, and the Lords Prayer: hoping that as my care is to do you good, so you will endeuour to pro∣fite by my labours: that as in mine old age, my desire is to bring forth more fruits, as one plāted in the house of God:Psal 92.13 14. so I may see you to walke worthy of the Lord, and please him in all things, be∣ing
fruitfull in all good works,Colos. 1.10 and en∣creasing in the knowledge of God. And that when I shall examine you before you come to the Lords Table, I may not find you so ignorant, as formerly I found you, & your families: but that I may see the care you haue had to shew your selues worthy of that fauour which God hath extended to you, by the preaching of the Gospell hitherto:Heb. 13.17 that so I watching ouer your soules, as one that must giue accounts vnto God, may doe it with ioy, and not with griefe. And albeit that ho∣nourable Lady, the Lady Anne Bacon be since departed this life, hauing finished her course,2. Tim 4 7. and fought that good fight, & kept the faith, and now resteth with Christ; yet you may acknowledge her Christian care to doe you good, hath taken effect in some measure amongst you, in placing mee ouer you, as your Pastor, by whose painefull labours you enioy that which many want. And that when I am gone hence to the Lord, as I attend dayly the time of my dissolution: that worthy and right Noble Gentleman Sir Frances Bacon her sonne may shew the like care, in placing ouer you a lear∣ned,
godly, and painefull Pastor, that may build you vp further till you grow to an holy Temple in the Lord. To whom with my continuall prayers for you, to keepe you vnspotted of this wicked world, I commit you all, Redburn this 20. of March, 1611. Your louing Pastor in Christ Iesus, RICHARD GAWTON.

people, whom he hath gathered to him∣selfe by the preaching of the Gospell through all the world. Iohn 17.6. & 20. and therefore is called Catholike or V∣niuersall, and Holy; for that as God him∣selfe is holy, so holinesse becommeth his house. 1. Pet 1 6. Secondly, that this Church is the Spouse of Christ, who gaue himselfe for it, that he might sanc∣tifie it, &c.

First, a Preface, Secondly, the Prayer it selfe in six pe∣titions, and thirdly, the conclusion of the Prayer. Q. VVhich is the Preface? A. Our Father which art in heauen. Q VVhat learne you in this Pre∣face? A. Three things. First, to pray to none but the only true God, the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ. Secondly, to assure vs, that God is our mercifull Father in Christ, and therefore will
heare our prayers, hee being Almighty, and therefore from heauen extending the tokens of his mercy to all that call vpon him in truth. Psal. 115.3. Psal. 135.6. Psal. 145.18. And thirdly, I am to say our Father, and not my Father alone, the better to assure mee that God will heare my prayers, since I pray as one that is a true member of his Church, as all the rest of the same members pray for mee, wee all louing one another as our selues. Iames 5.16. Q. VVhich is the first Petition? A. Hallowed bee thy name. Q. VVhat desire wee in this Peti∣tion? A. First, that God will inlighten vs with the knowledge of his holinesse, and secondly, as God is holy in himselfe, so hee may be glorified of all men, as the onely fountaine of all true holinesse. And thirdly, that his power, wisdom, good∣nesse, mercy, iustice and truth may be communicated to vs, and all the rest of his people, and that the fruites thereof may appeare in our holy liues and conuersations.

VVhat is the third Petition? A. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen. Q. VVhat desire wee in this Petition? A. First that wee and all the elect may haue our wils conformed vnto the will of God, wee renouncing our own corrupt affections and lusts, and being ready to doe our duties in our seuerall callings, that so God may prosper the things we take in hand according to his will. Secondly, albeit wee cannot at∣taine to performe this as we should, that yet wee set before vs the holy Angels, and labour to imitate them, that our vnperfect obedience in this world may
bee perfited in the world to come. Q. Rehearse the fourth Petition? A. Giue vs this day our dayly bread. Q. VVhat desire wee in this Petiti∣on? A. As in the three first Petitions we asked things spirituall, and the setting forth of Gods glory: So the other three Petitions concerne our selues, and therefore in this Petition, vnder the name of our daily bread, wee aske all things necessary for corporall food, and maintenance of our liues in this world, and doe cast off all mistrustfull care, and desire of worldly things, depending on the prouidence of God, and his fatherlie blessing of vs in our seuerall vocati∣ons. Q. Rehearse the fifth petition. A. And forgiue vs our trespasses, &c. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. The frée pardon and remission of all our sinnes, which otherwise might be as a cloud betwéene God and vs, to hin∣der vs from receiuing any benefit at his hands, Esa. 59.2. And it puts vs in mind, that as wee continually sin against God, so wee had néed continually to aske par∣don for our sinnes.
Q. Why is this added, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs? A. To teach vs, that we must be ready to forgiue others, if we will haue God to forgiue vs. Mat. 6.14. Q. Rehearse the sixth petition. A. And lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill. Q. What desire we in this petition? A. That God will not permit vs to bee further tempted, eyther by the Di∣uell or wicked men, then hee giues vs strength to resist their wicked tempta∣tions. Q. Rehearse the words of the conclu∣sion of this Prayer. A. For thine is the Kingdome, and the power, and the glory for euer. Q. VVhat learne you by this conclu∣sion? A. It serueth for the confirmation of my Faith, that God both can and wil grant the things I haue prayed for. Q. VVhereby is your faith so confir∣med? A For that first I beleeue, that God being our King, is both able and wil∣ling to grant our requests. And second∣ly, for that it serueth to extoll and ad∣uance
the power and glory of God, in that he heares the humble petitions of his Children, and grants their requests. Psal. 32.8 Psal. 65.2. Q VVhy is this word Amen added? A To shew that wee rest wholly vpon God, as vpon our mercifull and louing Father in Iesus Christ, and therefore doubt not, but hee will do, as we haue prayed. Q Hauing heard that the continuall hearing of Gods word preached, prayer, and the vse of the Sacraments are the meanes to encrease in vs a liuely faith: let me heare now what you call Sacraments?

Cor. 11.23 & 25. Q VVhat be the inuisible graces ther∣by signified? A Our spirituall nourishment by the body and bloud of Christ. 1. Cor. 10.16. Iohn 6.53.54 55 56.

A That they examine themselues what measure of knowledge they haue in all the principles of Christian Religion, 1 Cor. 11.28. and specially of the Sacra∣ments. 1. Cor. 10 15 16. Q Is that knowledge sufficient? A This will teach them, that without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb. 11.6. and therefore that they come not without faith & the fruits thereof, with an vnfeigned repentance and charity. Phil. 1 9. & 11 1 Cor. 13.13. Matth 5.25. Luk. 15.8. Galat. 5 6. Q Wherein stands true repentance? A In two things: First an vnfained sorrow and remorse of conscience for our former sinnes, 2 Cor. 7.10 Psal. 51.2.3. & 17. Secondly a true conuersion and tur∣ning to God, in an holy life and conuer∣sation. Ro. 6.19. Eph 4.22.23. Tit. 2.11.12 Q. Wherein stands charity? A In two things: First to loue God, who hath loued vs so deerely, as to giue
his only sonne Christ to be our Sauiour & Redéemer. 2. Cor. 5.14 15. Gal. 5.22.23. Q What is the second thing? A To loue all men vnfainedly, euen our enemies, Ro. 12 10. & 20 and there∣fore wee are to cut off all occasions of dis∣cord and dissention, by reconciling our selues to all such as wee haue offended, Mat 5 25. & 44 and fréely forgiuing all those who any way offended vs, euen as God fréely for Christs sake forgaue vs. Colos. 3.12.13.14. Q What danger is there in comming vnworthilie to the table of the Lord? A The vnworthy receiuer is guilty of the body and bloud of Christ, and eat∣eth and drinketh his owne damnation. 1. Cor 11.17. & 29. Q What benefit hath the worthy re∣ceiuer? A First his faith is confirmed, Rom. 4.11. he is filled with ioy in the holy Ghost, A & 4.31. & 2 38. and gets new strength against sinne and Sathan.
