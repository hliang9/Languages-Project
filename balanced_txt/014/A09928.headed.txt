¶ The prayer Of our Lorde. O Lorde God oure Father in heauen wee thy mysera∣ble chyldren vp∣pon earthe, be∣seche thee mercifully to loke vppon vs, & lende vs thy gra∣ce, that thy name may be sanc∣tyfyed amonge vs and in all the worlde, through the pure preachinge of thy wurde, and trew knowledge and vnder∣standing of the same, and tho∣rowe earnest charitie in our dayelye conuersation and ly∣uinge, seclude thou graciously from vs all false doctrine and
euill lyuyng, wherby thy wor∣thy name mighte be blasphe∣med and slaundered. Oh let thy kyngedome come, and be great to all synfull and blinde people, and suche as be holden captiue of the deuell and hys kyngdome, bring thou Lorde vs to trewe repentaunce & to the knowledge of the trewe say the, in Iesus Christe thy sonne. Strengthen vs Lorde with thy grace, to doo thy wil in all godlye wurkes, and to suffer the same in lyfe and in death, in well and in wo, that our wil may be alwayes bro∣ken, offered vp and mortified. Geue vs our dayly bread, pre∣serue vs from all couetousnes and immoderate carefulnes of the belly, that of thee we may be assured to haue abundaūce
of all good thinges necessarye for vs, forgeue vs our trespas∣ses, that we maye haue a glad and a quiete consciēce in thee, in that we receiue forgiuenes of oure synnes, as we be wyl∣linge to forgeue all them that trespasse agaynst vs. And lead vs not into temptacion. But strengthen vs Lord with thy spirite, to subdue the fleshe to dispise the world with the va∣nities thereof, & to ouercome the deuel with all his crafty as∣saults, and finally delyuer vs from all euel, both bodely and ghostlye, temporall and eternall, for thyne is the kyngdom, the power and the glory for euer. So be it.
O Almightye and euerla∣styng God, Father, sone and holy Ghoste. Thou that hast made heauen, earth and all thinges in theym con∣teyned, haue mercy vppon me poore wretched sinner, daylye assaulted with all kynde of mi∣serie and wretchednes, I be∣seche thee o Father, for the loue of thy sōne Iesus Christ, consider my imperfection and haue mercy vpon me, encreace thy grace in me, my sauiour, my redemer, my iustifier, for I come vnto thee O Lorde, ac∣cordinge vnto thy wurde, for thou hast sayd, come vnto me all ye that labor, & are ladē & I will refreshe you, O my moste mercifull Lord & sauiour, ease me of my burdē of synne, whi∣che I haue vnrighteously com¦mitted
in deede, wurde and thought, and refresh my soule with thy mercye, O reconcyle me with Isope and I shalbe clean, and open my lippes (O Lorde) that my mouthe maye shewe thy prayse, consider my imperfection and haue mercye vppon me, and helpe it with thy great mercies, remember thyne olde wonted mercyes, faythfull promysses made to oure forefathers, Abraham. Isaac and Iacob, and al other thy sainctes in oure sauioure Iesu Christe, who being com∣passed with infirmities and weakenes of the fleshe come vnto thee (O LORDE) the well of lyfe and euerlastynge fountayne of their helth and saluation, and thou mercifully susteyned them kepest them &
defendest them in all their tē∣ptations and tribulations, yf their feete any tyme slipte or went out of the waye, and cō∣mitted synne against thee, yet thy mercye was alwaye redy, so that thou by thy holy spirite haddest procured them agayn by repentaunce, so that they turned again vnto the, which conuersion or turning agayn thou mercyfullye acceptest at their handes, for because they were desirous to lyue perfect∣ly in thy sight, thou preser∣uedest theym, so that they be found faythful before thee, O Lorde thou arte the same, and thy years ēdure for euer. I be∣sech thee O father bear my in¦firmities and imperfeccion, & helpe it likewise with thy mer¦cye, if at any tyme I happen
to fall and commytie synne a∣gainst thee, yet as thou saidest by thyne Apostle Paule, lette thy grace at all tymes be suffi∣cient for me, so that I may im∣mediatly turne agayne bety∣me to repentaunce vnto thee, which conuersiō and turninge agayn, accepte alwayes at my hāds for Iesus Christes sake. So shal I be found perfect be∣fore thee, for although ye spirit be wyllynge, yet is the flesshe vntowarde and weake. Ther∣fore doo I not lay myne own righteousnes before thee, for I knowe and confesse me, that is to saye, in my flesshe me, that is to saye, in my flesshe is no∣thing but playn misery, wret∣chednes and synne. Therfore doo I come vnto thee, & bese∣che thee for Christes sake to er tende thy mercyfull hand to∣warde
me, do away myne of∣fences, for I know (O Lorde) that all grace and goodnes commeth of thee, and therfore arte thou praysed (O Lorde) & feared in the congregation a∣mong thy sainets, for thou on∣ly arte he that geueth victory. O Lorde God of hostes, and that as thou saydest by thy Prophete Zacharie, neyther throughe an hoste of men nor through strength, but through thy spirite. Therfore I besech thee geue me not only strēgth & knowledge of thee, but also a redy earnest purpose & wyll to subdue myne affectiōs, and graunte me grace at all tymes too lyue as thou in thy holye wurd hast prescribed vnto me moreouer I besech thee make me perfecte in thy sighte, that
I may rēdre cōtinual thankes by Iesus Christe vnto thee, & where as I haue not hetherto endeuoured my self, according to ye power whiche thou haste genē me to lyue after thy wil, I praye thee of forgeuenes for Christes sake thine only sōne our Lord, and now I proteste before thee through ye helpe of thy holy spirite, to order my li∣fe from henceforth accordinge to thy wurd, and to walk per∣fectly before thee. Neuerthe∣lesse I besech thee for Christes sake at al times to bear the im¦perfection that any tyme is founde in me and delyuer me by thy power and mercye, en∣creace my faythe O my rede∣mer, encreace my fayth O my fauiour encreace my fayth O my iustifier, encreace faith ho¦pe,
loue, charitie and all other vertues consonaunte, & agrea∣ble to a godly lyfe, for I come vnto thee (O Lorde) the Well and euerlastinge Fountayne of all helth & saluacion. O my heauenly father, let me and al other which seek thy wurde to thentent to forsake sinne & to amēde their liues, liue in thy sight, I thanke thee (O Lord) with all my harte, soule and mynde, yt it hath pleased thee of thy great mercye and good∣nes to creat and fourme me of the molde of the earth, & geue me members needefull to my body, and that it hath pleased thee to preserue alwhich (thou hast created in me) sithēs the tyme of thy creatiō vntil now, & that it hath pleased thee to deliuer me frō the hour of tēp∣tacion,
and in my tribulacion, aswel slepig as wakig whē I was forgetful of thee as whē I remembred to cal vpō thee & yt it hath pleased thee to mini∣ster to my necessities, meat, drinke and clothynge and as inward reioysing, quietnes of mynd, helth of bodie and such lyke, and that it hathe pleased thee to geue me this womā to be my wyfe as a remedie cōso∣latie and comforte in al my ne∣cessities. Graunt vs grace (O Lorde) truely together to ho∣nour loue and serue thee, for I know that whatsoeuer I do, either good or euil, it shalbe re warded of thee. Lighten vs therfore dayly, I beseche thee with thy grace that we maye gouerne our selues, our hous∣holde and chyldrē, which thou
hast geuē vs in the true faith, feare and knowledge of thee, so ye it maye bee an acceptable sacrifice vnto thee, by Iesus Christe our lord. And seyng it hath plesed ye O father to ligh¦ten ye inward eies of my mynd with thy grace, & to cal me frō the great blyndenes of igno∣raunce and synne, wherein al men are born, to ye knowledge of thee, let it now muche more (as sainct Paule sayth) please thee to preserue me & all other whom thou hast called, which be dayly oppressed by synne, & desire to turne and come vnto thee (of what tunge or nacion whatsoeuer thei be) thorough the whole worlde, and seing it hath pleased thee to cal me by grace to the knowledge of thy wurd, & geue me a wil to seek
it to loue & beleue in it, let it be thy will to directe my wayes that I erre not, staye my feete with thy holy hād, & preserue me with thyne arme, for I am els farre to weak, for without thee I can doo nothing. O let me lyue in thy sight O Lord, and put me not oute from thy presence, but geue me a newe hart and a newe spirite, that I maye alwayes cal vpō thee in tyme of my trouble, and of∣fer thee an acceptable sacry∣fyce by Iesus Christe before thee, euen the fruyte of those lyppes, which confesse thy na∣me, geue me grace (O lord) pa∣ciently to receyue the Cup of helth & saluatiō at thy hād, & call vpon thy name in the tyme of mine aduersitie, O hear my prayer I besech thee lette my
power and pleasure be alway in the frute of the tree of lyfe, whiche is in the Paradyse of God, O accept these volenta∣ry sacrifices at my handes as the sweet smell of incence, and let the lifting vp of my hādes be an euenig sacrifice, pleasāt and acceptable vnto thee tho∣rough Iesus Christe oure Lorde, to whome be euerlasting prayse honour and glo¦rie, now & euer. Amen.
