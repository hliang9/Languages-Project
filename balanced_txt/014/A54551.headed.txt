To the Right Honorable, The Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the Commons House of PARLIAMENT: The Humble PETITION of the Lord Major, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common-Council assembled; SHEWETH, THat your Petitioners smart sence of the Decay of Trade, hath dri∣ven them to a sad and serious Enquiry into the Cause, And having (as they conceive) made a full Discovery thereof, think it their duty to the publick Interest, to represent the same in all humi∣ty to this Honorable House: That which they apprehend most destructive, is the Diversion of the most part of the Trade of Exporting the Commodities of our Native Growth and Manufactures, into
the hands of Aliens; By which the onely means of increasing the Common Stock of our Nation is lost, and if some timely Remedy be not applied by your Wisdom and Authority, our Navigation must de∣cay, our succession of English Merchants be extinct, and our condition become the same it was, when those of Foreign Na∣tions were the onely Merchants known in England; and by our being more Buyers then Sellers, our Lands, by reason of the scarcity of Money, not worth above the tenth part of what they now are. And should the Strangers be permitted, by themselves here (who live single in hired Chambers) exempt from family expence or the publick charge of all Offices, or by Packers and other mechanick persons, to carry on their Trades as English; not onely this City, but all other His Maje∣sties Cities (Townes Corporate) and others, must necessarily decay, and be dis∣abled
to serve the publick Government in purse and office. For preservation where∣of, your Petitioners humbly pray, That it may please this Honorable House (the Sanctuary of the Commons of England) to provide, That the Trade of Exportation (to foreign Parts) of all Eng∣lish Goods and Manufactures, by the English Sub∣jects not yet incorporated, may be reduced under Go∣vernment and Regulation, by His Majesties Char∣ter under the Great Seal of England, and confirmed to English onely. And that those Trades that aye already under Regulation, may be confirmed in such manner, as may not exclude any English Merchant that submits to the Government in all, or any the respective Ports and places of this His Majesties Kingdom. And that all Aliens may pay the same Subsidies and Customs on all English Draperies by them exported, as they paid before the reduction of the Rates thereof, by the last Act of Parliament, And the Petitioners shall pray, &c.
To the Right Honourable, The Grand Committee of Parliament for TRADE. The humble Petition of the respective Merchants of Lon∣don, Trading into Forreign parts, on the behalf of them∣selves, and the Merchants of the Out-Ports of this King∣dom; SHEWETH, THat your Petitioners do humbly conceive, That as Government and Regulation is ab∣solutely necessary for the common good of all Societies of men in general, so it is as ex∣pedient for all Subordinate degrees and pro∣fessions in particular: and because the Forreign Trade is the onely means to enlarge the Common Stock, and Capi∣tal of the Nation, and the Revenue thereof, they therefore humbly pray, That for the more ample Reasons offered in the Pre∣amble of the annexed Proposals, for the desired Regulation, your Honours would be pleased to con∣sider of the form therein humbly tendred, for the erection and execution of the Government of Forreign Trade, and to report the same to the Ho∣nourable House, as in your wisdoms you shall finde most conducing to the Publick good of the king∣dom, And your Petitioners shall ever pray, &c.
REASONS For the REGULATION OF Forreign Trade. WHereas much of the Honor, Happiness, and Prosperity of this Kingdom doth depend upon the Forreign Trade and Commerce thereof, which therefore ought by all means, and with all care to be encouraged, and such Laws made, as may prevent the decay, and remove the impediments and discouragements which hinders its encrease and advancement. And where∣as experience doth sufficiently manifest that want of good Order and Regulation, which opens the door to Ignorance on the one hand, and Covetousness on the other, is the foundation, as of all evil in the general, so of those in par∣ticular which relate to Trade. For whilest on the one side great numbers of Artificers, and others, inexpert and ig∣norant men, make upon them to use the Art, Science, and Mystery of Merchandizing into forreign parts, they, by rea∣son
of their unskilfulness, not onely impoverish them∣selves, but also enrich the Foreigners who take advantage of their ignorance to advance their Commodities, and to debase those of this Kingdom, and do often thereby also necessitate the more knowing Merchant to comply with their wills, to their great loss, and the impoverishment of the whole kingdom; And also many Gentlemen, who would bring up some of their sons in the Art and Science of Mer∣chandizing, are discouraged, when they finde that after they have given good summs of money to binde their sons Apprentices, to learn the said Science; others, that never gave one penny, nor served to learn the same, shall enjoy the like Priviledge of Trade, to the ruine, not onely of them∣selves, but also of the Trade, so rendring the Fathers cost and sons service insignificant, as to the designed end of fu∣ture livelihood. And on the other side, whilest subrile and covetous men, who have attained to great estates and cre∣dits, having no Rule, but their own covetous desires to walk by, some of them make it their work to oppress, and suppress young men, and fair dealing Merchants in their trades, by overlaying of Markets in Forreign parts, and buying up Commodities there; necessitating thereby, those that have not equal stocks and credits with them, to loose in the sale of their English commodities, and to pay excessive rates for Forreign; And others, being shop-keepers, and Retailers, engross both the Merchants Trade, and the Re∣taylers also; thereby through ignorance spoyling the Trade abroad, and through their knowledge and acquaintance at home, circumventing the Merchant in the dispose, and the meaner shop-keeper in the providing and disposing of the Commodities of Forreign parts, that both being ruined, the whole Trade might come into a few hands, and they impose on the people what rates they please, the Trade must needs decay; many being undone, others discouraged,
the native Commodities of this kingdom in Foreign parts debased, and Foreign Commodities Enhaunsed, the stran∣ger enriched, and this kingdom impoverished. And whereas sutable remedies cannot be applyed against all the evils that cause the decay, nor means prescribed for the en∣crease and advance of Trade and Commerce, without the knowledge of the particular Tades, and their dependen∣cies, which none are so able to represent, as the Merchants themselves, & yet that whilst the Merchants remain unasso∣ciated, and not under a general Regulation by joynt coun∣sel and consent, it may be supposed that every man will be apt to make his own private interest and profit, his prin∣ciple and end in all his advises and proposals, so that pro∣bably things may be mis-represented, which will be pre∣vented, if the Merchants of every respective Trade were Associated; for though a particular man may intend his private profit in all his actings and advices, yet it is sure that the generality will promote the general concern of the Trade, which as it is their interest, so it is also the kingdoms interest. And whereas Trade and Commerce especially, as all o∣ther things in this world, is subject to many changes and al∣terations; and that such Rules for the regulation of Trade cannot be so made, but that it may be needful for the ge∣neral good, to make often additions of new, and to repeal and lay a side former Rules, according to the times, exigen∣ces of affairs, and proceedings of their respective Coun∣tries, where, and with whom the Trade is driven. And whereas of late years, many strangers who come into this kingdom, live obscurely in private Chambers, and contribute nothing to the Publick Charge, yet drive very great Trades, and by means of Packers, Porters, and other persons of mean or no fortune, whom they imploy, do enter their Merchandize, both Imported, and Exported
into, and out of this kingdom, deceive the Kings Majesty of his Customes, and several Cities and Corporations of this kingdom, of their Dudes of Scavage, Package, &c. and also hinder and prejudice many English Merchants, His Majesties faithful and loyal Subjects, who because they will not, contrary to Law, and their Duty, defraude his Majesty of his Customes, by entring strangers goods as English, which the others do, they loose their Commis∣sion and imployment; which abuse cannot be prevented, unless all Merchants be brought into Association, and none permitted to pass at the Custom-House, as English men, but Merchants of the said Association. And whereas in former Ages, many of the Kings of this Land, out of their great wisdomes for the advancement of trade, have given their Royal Charters to several distinct sorts of Merchants, to Incorporate themselves for the bet∣ter carrying on, and Regulating their respective Trades, as to the Merchants called, The Merchant Adventurers of England, the Merchants trading to Turkey, the East-land Merchants, the Russia, and Muscovia Merchants, and the Merchants trading to the East-Indies; which Societies have not onely found benefit, by the due Regulations of their Trades, but have been very serviceable to His Maje∣sty, and the whole kingdom; have bred up many English Merchants in Trades in Foreign parts, advanced many young men, by lending them moneys without, or for very in considerable Interest, relieved many Merchants that have by the hand of God bin impoverished, maintained and up∣held the Trade in the hands of the English, and the Honor of the English Nation in Forein parts, whereas other trades not incorporated, are in a manner totally lost, as to the Eng∣lish, and fallen into the hands of Strangers, as is demonstra∣ble in the French and other Trades: Upon which grounds, as we humbly conceive, His Most Excellent Majesty since
His most blessed Restauration, hath bin graciously pleased to renew, or confirm all, or most of the aforesaid Charters. And whereas the reason that moved the Parliament, in the third Year of King James, Chap. 6. to call in a Charter granted to a few Merchants trading to Spain, Portugal, and France, is now totally removed: And that there are very many Merchants in this Kingdom bred up, and educated in the Mystery of Merchandizing, and every way sufficient to carry on the whole Trade of this Kingdom into Foreign parts, which want nothing more then good Encouragement by the due Regulation of their Trades; Without which, it is humbly conceived, the Evils before-mentioned, cannot be prevented, nor the Trade upheld in the hands of the English, which cannot but be a great Impoverishment to the Kingdom, (it being a certain Maxim, That what ever the English carries out, he doth at last bring all, with its increase, home to his Native Countrey: Whereas on the contrary, the Strangers Design is not to enrich, but to carry away the Riches of the Nation.) But by the ensuing, or some such like Association of, and for Regulation, as by your Honors shall be provided, It is hoped that Trade may be enlivened, the English Merchants encouraged, the Strangers Encroach∣ments prevented, His Majesties Customs augmented, and the Capital of the Nation in few years much encreased, and by such Establishment, His Majesty and Your Honors, may at any time have before your view at once, how every respe∣ctive Trade answers in its Exports, to its Imports, and so may see where chiefly the Interest of Trade is by which the Nation is enriched, and by which not; and of what use that may be in relation to the Publick, Your Honors best know: Wherefore
It is humbly Proposed, That it may be Enacted, THat by Authority of His Majesties Royal Charters un∣der the Great Seal of England, the several and respe∣ctive English Merchants, trading into the Dominions of the French King, the English Merchants trading into the Do∣minions of the King of Spain, the Merchants trading into the Dominions of the King of Portugal, the Merchants tra∣ding into Italy, and such other Merchants, as hereafter His Majesty shall finde convenient, may be Associated and In∣corporated, for the better Regulating and Ordering of the said respective Trades, to the profit of this Kingdom, in such manner as is hereafter expressed, (that is to say;) That all the English Merchants trading into the Dominions of the French King, and so of the other respective Merchants, mutatis mutandis, being such as have been bred up in the Science and Art of Merchandizing into Foreign parts, or such as have for three years last past exercised the said Sci∣ence, and are not Shop-keepers or Retailers, and that shall take the Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, and such an Oath for Submission to the Regulations to be made, con∣formable to the Powers herein desired; and not to colour any Foreign Goods, as by Your Honors shall be thought reasonable, may as aforesaid, be Incorporated, and made a Body Corporate in the Law, to all intents and purposes, un∣der the Name and Style of the Governor, Deputy, and As∣sistants of the Merchants of England, trading into the Do∣minions of the French King, &c. That His Majesty in such Charter, may please to nominate and appoint the first Governor, Deputy, Treasurer, and such number of Assistants, nor exceeding four and twenty, nor less then twelve, as He shall judge fit; the said Governor
and Deputy to take the Oathes aforesaid, before such per∣son or persons as His Majesty shall for that purpose Autho∣rize: And that the said Governor or Deputy being so sworn, may be authorized to Administer (or for the ease of the Merchants in the countrey, under their hands and seals, to depute any Mayor of any Town Corporate in this Kingdom to Administer) the said Oathes to all other persons qualified as aforesaid, that shall be admitted into any of the said respe∣ctive Associations. That Annually on the  day of  or within  days after the said respective Merchants so associated, shall meet at some convenient place within the City of London, where the Governor or Deputy for the time being, shall by some publick Writing for that purpose fixed on the Royal Exchange, appoint to choose out from amongst themselves a Governor, Deputy, Treasurer, and such num∣ber of Assistants, not exceeding four and twenty, nor less then twelve; And that all and every the Members of the said respective Associations, residing out of the City of Lon∣don, may send up the Names of such persons residing in London, which he desires should be choosen, sealed up and directed to the Governor or Deputy of the said Association whereof he is a Member; which shall be opened at the said Meeting, and his Vote reckoned in the said Choice, as if he were present. That the Governor, or Deputy, or any seven of the As∣sistants, may have power as often as occasion shall require, to summon the generality together, to some convenient place within the City of London: And that they, or the major part, shall have power to make such By-laws and Regulations for the well-ordering the said respective Trades, and to repeal, and make void such former Rules by them made, as they, or the major part, shall finde to conduce to the general Good, and to impose such Impositions on Goods imported and ex∣ported,
for the Maintenance of the Government, not excee∣ding one twentieth part of the Customs as they now are, on all goods, except Wines; and on Wines, not exceeding one fortieth part of the Customs as they now are; As also to choose and appoint such Officer and Officers for the better execution of their Orders, as they shall finde convenent. Provided, That no Rule of general Concernment shall pass for valid, till it hath been sent to such parts or places where there are six or more Members of that Society, to have their Votes of assent or dissent; upon the return of which Votes, at the next Meeting the said Votes from the coun∣trey being reckoned with their Voting in person, it shall be established by the major Vote, or laid aside. Provided also, that no Rule or By-law to be made as aforesaid, shall extend to the reducing any foreign trade (other then that to the East-Indies) into a Joynt-stock, nor to limit any, for how much or how little they shall trade, nor at what price they shall buy or sell; but that every one may trade for as much or as little, and buy and sell his goods at such prices as he pleaseth. And that to all Rules so made, all the Members of the re∣spective Associations in all Ports and places, shall be obliged to submit, and to such Payments and Penalties thereby ap∣pointed. That in any Port or Town Corporate, where there shall be a sufficient number of persons, Members of any of the said Associations, to constitute a Court according to the propor∣tion appointed for the City of London, there they may choose Officers, and hold Courts, and for the well ordering the trade of that Port or place, according to the common Rules agreed on by the generality.
