A PARAPHRASE On the Third PSALM, ENTITULED, A Psalm of DAVID, when he fled from ABSALOM his Son. ETernal Monarch, you who are The Shield of injured Kings, and bear For all Crown'd Heads more than a Common Care, Behold how they increase who joyn To ruine me, how they combine 'Gainst Law Paternal, Regal, and Divine. So low, so lost, to them I seem, That now they impiously blaspheme, And dare to say, his God can't rescue him. False, and Prophane! he can redress; He can, He will, 'tis questionless: He sees, and will revenge their Wickedness. On you, my God, I ne're did call In vain, what e're did yet befall; And I am well assured I never shall. Safe in this Confidence, my Breast Shall with no Terrour be opprest, Asleep, or wake, th' Almighty guards my rest. A Hundred Thousand Rebel Foes My mind shall never discompose, For my One God is Millions more than those. Arise O Lord, and let them see That you have been, and still will be My inexpugnable Security. FINIS.
