ALàs thàt euer I synnèd in my lyfe to me is come this day ye dredfull tydynges that euer I herde / here hath ben with me a ser geaunt of armes whose name is crewelte from the kynge of all kynges / lorde of all lordes / & Iuge of all Iuges lyenge on me his mace of his offyce sayenge vnto me I arest you & warne you to make you redy & yt ye fayle not to be redy euery houre whan ye be called on / ye shall not wete whan. And call sadly to your remembraunce your olde & longe conty∣nued offences / the goodnes of god how largly he hath departed with you the gyftes of nature / the gyftes of fortune & the gyftes of grace / & how he hath departed with you largely & ordeyned you at your baptym thre sad borowes that ye sholde safly & sewerly be kepte in your tender age as well from vices as fro bodely pe∣ryll & ordeyned you a good aungell to kepe you and to coūseyll you yf ye haue be coūseylled by hym bethynke you. And whan ye come to the yere of dyscrecyon he or deyned you thre sad counseyllers / reason / drede / and conscyence yf ye haue be rewled by theyr coūseyll call that to your remembraunce. He ordeyned you also .v. wyttes / seruauntes that ye sholde be mayster of & rule them after your dyscrecyou / that is to saye your felyn¦ge / your syght / your herynge / your speche / & your tast How haue ye rewled these that be vnder your obey∣saūce me thȳketh ye haue moche thȳge to answere for for the Iuge that shall sytte vpon you he wyll not be percyall nor he wyll not be corrupte with good but he wyll mȳster to you Iustyce & equyte certaynly as well as this There were certayne thynges he forbad you & the thynges ye sholde flee in ony wyse that is to were

And yet that is but lytell thynge. ¶ The lamentacyon of the dyenge creature. ALas alas exscuse me I can not / and whome I myght desyre to speke for me I wote not / the day & tyme is so dredful / the Iuge is so ryghtfull myn enmyes be cruell my kyn my neyghbours my frendes my seruauntes be not fauourable to me / & also I wote well they shall not be herde there. ¶ The complaynt of the dyenge creature to the good aungell. O My good aungell to whome our lorde toke me to kepe where be ye now me thynketh ye sholde be here now & answere for me for the drede of deth dy∣stroubleth me so yt I can not answere for my selfe here is my bad aungell redy & is one of my chefe accusers with legions of fendes with hym & I haue no creature to answere for me / alas it is an heuy caas. ¶ The answere of the good aungell to the dyenge creature. AS to your badde dedes I was neuer consen∣tynge. I sawe your natural inclynacyon more dysposed to be rewled by your bad aungell than by me how be it ye can not exscuse you but whan ye were pur
posed to do ony thȳge that was cōtrary to the cōmaū∣dementes of god I fayled not to remembre you that it was not well & counseylled you to flee the places of peryll and the company that sholde stere or moue you therto can ye saye nay hereto / how can ye thynke that I coude answere for you. ¶ The complaynt of the dyenge creature to reason drede and conscyence. O Ye reason drede & conscyence ye were assygned to be of my counseyll now come I requyre you & helpe me to answere for me for my defautes be so ma∣ny & so abhomynable in the syght of hym that shall be my Iuge and my accusers be so many & so vnfrendly that they leue not one defaute behynde. Now come I require you & helpe to answere for me for it was neuer so grete nede. The fere & the drede that I am in dys∣troubleth me so that one worde I can not speke for my selfe. Alas that euer I sawe this daye. ¶ The answere of reason. BE ye remembred that our lorde ordeyned you a good aungell & a badde aungell & he ordeyned you reason & dyscrecyon to knowe the good from the yll & he cōmaunded you to do good & leue the euyll / he put you in fre choyse whether ye wolde do well or euyl ye ought to call to your remembraunce how well god hath done for you & helped you in euery daunger & pe ryll he wolde haue ben loued dred & serued accordȳge to the many folde graces & kyndenesses that he hath shewed vnto you how to answere for you I wote not loth I am to accuse you / & excuse you I can not.
¶ The complaynt to the dyenge creature to drede saynge thus. A Drede where be ye is there no helpe and so∣cour with you to speke for me whan I shall come to my Iugement. ¶ The answere of drede. NO certaynly for whan ye were set in pleasaūce & delectacyon of the worlde reason put in your mynde that ye dyde not well / & I drede was with you at all tymes and in euery place & fayled not to speke vnto you & to put you in mynde of the shame of this worlde and drede of dampnacyon & of the peryll that worlde folowe as well here as elles where rehersynge vnto you the punysshemētes that our lorde ordeyned for synne saynge vnto you. Se ye not how gracyously our lorde hath called you from synne & wretchednes yf ye wolde vnderstande it / how hath he longe kepte you in worshyp estate and in prosperyte & coude not knowe the goodnes of god / how hath he chastysed you & how ofte by losse of your chyldren / losse of your kyn and frendes / losse of your goodes and losse of all tho thynges that ye coude not be pleased with & set you in the indygnacyon of the grete hyghe & myghty prynce and helpe you out of the daungers & perylles that ye haue ben in at all tymes / & yet haue ye not loued hym dred hym & serued hym that in all these perylles hath preserued & kepte you & hath ben so gracyous & good forde to you who sholde speke for you. I. nay certaynly ¶ The complaynt of the dyenge creature to conscyence saynge thus.
ALas conscyence is there no helpe with you I haue herde saye longe ago the worlde was to curste / but I wolde hope that conscyence wolde haue compassyon of my dystresse and moche the more that I am frendles. ¶ The answere of conscyence to the dyenge creature. I Am sory to accuse you & excuse you I can not for conscyence and drede haue ben but seldom from you & called vpon you in euery tyme & place of peryll & had you flee the occasyons of synne ye myght haue fled at that tyme and wolde not / now ye wolde flee deth & can not / we sholde speke for you & dare not & though we wolde it auayleth not ye must sorowfully & mekely suffre ye Iugementes that ye haue deserued. ¶ The complaynt of the dyenge creature to the fyue wyttes. O Ye fyue that were ordeyned to be my seruaūtes & vnder myn obeysaunce & to haue be rewled at all tymes as I wolde haue you / is there no good word that ye may a forde to saye for me & recorde my deme∣nynge to you & reporte of me how I haue rewled and gouerned you yt were take me to kepe rewle & gouerne me thynketh ye sholde saye for me now / who myght soo well saye for me as ye fyue / ye haue ben with me contynually euer syth that I was borne nyght & daye and neuer at no tyme from me thynketh of your kyn¦denesse ye sholde haue compassyon vpon me and saye the best that ye coude saye for me. I haue ben frendly to you and brought you in euery place of pleasaunce and dysporte / now shewe your kȳdenes agayne to me and speke to fayth and hope for me that they wolde
charytably do my message vnto the moost gloryous prynce that euer was is or shall be. ¶ The answere of the fyue wyttes. CErtaynly we meruayll that ye wolde desyre vs to speke for you vnderstandynge these worship full people haue denyed and refused to speke for you your good aungell reason drede and conscyence / how sholde we be herde or what credens wyll be gyuen vn to vs that haue ben your seruauntes and vnder your obeysaunce and no thynge at all tymes but as ye haue cōmaunded vs to do / call to your remembraunce how ye haue rewled vs fyue / syght / herynge / felynge and thought ye haue at all tymes brought vs in places of pleasaunce & dysporte & thoughe it were dysporte & pleasaunce / for the tyme it is now sorowe wepynge & waylȳge for your sake that we can not excuse you nor no thynge saye for you that myght be to your wel or to your ese for we haue ben preuy & partyners to all that hath ben mysdone in ony wyse and in euery place and youre offences in euery thynge is in your defaute for and ye had sadly rewled vs and lyke a souerayne ye sholde haue restrayned in vs euery vyce / for we sholde haue be ruled by you in euery thȳge / & otherwyse than ye wolde haue vs do we wolde not do / therfore of neces¦syte your defautes must be layd vpon you for we haue do as seruaūtes shold do & obeyed you in euery thȳge & dysobeyed you in no thynge / wherfore of ryght the peryll must be yours what credence wyll ye gyue to vs than / yf we sholde say well of you the people wold say that we were fals dyssymulours & fauourers of sȳne.
¶ The lamentacyon of the dyenge creature. ALas there is no creature that I can complayn me to but vtterly refuseth to saye ony thynge that myght be to my comforte. The cōplaynt of the dyenge creature to fayth & hope. O Holy fayth & hope in you is all my trust for how greuously & how myscheuously yt euer I offen∣ded god you displeased I neuer. I haue alway byleued as the chyrche of crystendome hath taught me & specy¦ally is of the moost holy incarnacyon I was neuer in thought. I haue byleued in the blessyd and moost glo∣ryous trynyte fader sone & holy goost. I haue byleued that the seconde persone of the trynyte descended in to the bosom of the moost gloryous and pure chast meke vyrgyn that euer was is or shall be & medled his very godhede with her pure chast virgynyte & may denhede and in her bosom was parfytly very god & man con∣ceyued by the grete mystery of the holy goost without knowlege or company of ony erthly man & she a pure chast virgyn flowrynge in virgynyte and by herynge of the holy archaungell Gabryell whiche brought vn to her the moost gracyous & good tydynges that euer came to man kynde. Now holy Fayth take with you hope & ye twayne of your perfyte charyte be my aduo¦cates in the hyghe courte / and refuse me not nor dys∣dayne me not for myn horryble and abhominable syn¦nes that I haue done / whiche asketh vengeaunce in this worlde and dampnacyon eternall without the mercyes of hym whiche is almyghty / What meane
myght I haue therto. I praye you counseyll me for ye knowe well that my reason neuer dyscorded with the fayth / & as to you Hope I hope all wayes that ye wyll saye for me that I haue alwayes hoped to the mercyes of god almyghty and that I sholde be one of the chyl∣dren of saluacyon and one of tho that sholde be rede∣med by the precyous and bytter paynfull passion as other synners haue be and certaynly other plee nor re¦systence I can not make. But and ye twayne wolde be a meane for me to that moost gloryous and pure chaste virgyn that chosen was by one assent of all the hole gloryous trynyte to do the moost gloryous and worshypfull acte that euer was done for her chastyte her pure virgynyte her mekenesse her vertue and her constaunce was cause that she was chosen by all the hole gloryous trynyte to be doughter mother & spouse to the moost gloryous trynyte & that she sholde bere hym that sholde redeme all mankynde from dampna¦cyon who may so well be aduocatryse to the fader the sone and the holy goost as she and ye wyll be meane to her sone for me I hope she wyll not refuse me / for I vnderstande and knowe well that she hath holpe ma∣ny a synner that hath ryght greuously offended and in the holy psalme that was made bytwene her & her cosyn saynt Elyzabeth it was sayd that all generacy¦ons sholde blysse her. I hope at the begynnynge of the worlde our lorde put not me out of his nombre of tho that sholde blysse his moost holy moder & recorde her mercy pyte & grace that she shewed to synners whan they haue none other socour ne helpe. She is moder of orphans / and she is consolacyon of them that ben dyssolate / she is guyde to all tho that be out of the way
to set them in the ryght waye. I am an orphan I am dyssolate. I am out of the waye I wote not where to crye and call after socour and helpe but onely to her that bare our redemptour who may so well be meane to the sone as the moder. And ye twayne Fayth and Hope wolde be meane to the moder of mercy for me. Now gracyous Fayth and Hope do your parte and dysdayne not my request thoughe I desyre you to this occupacyon / for and ye twayne wolde denye to saye for me I thynke I shall fall in dyspayre for on whome to call after socour I wote not / and to put my selfe in prees as a poore naked best vnclothed of vertue and repleted with vyces naked of grace and in myn owne defaute and to come to the presence of the kynge of all kynges and vnpouruayed of all thynges that wolde accorde with his moost ryall and Imperyall estate I dare not take it vpon me I sholde be in suche drede & fere I sholde not con ne dare not speke for my selfe for I haue prayed my good aungell to speke for me and he hath denyed it. I haue called vpon Reason Drede and Conscyens & they haue answered me full heuyly that they be loth to accuse me and exscuse me they can not / & alledgeth many a grete resonable cause why yt I can not saye nay to. I haue called vpon my seruaun¦tes whiche were take me to rewle and gouerne as I wolde answere for them / and they answere me ryght sorowfully & saye yf they sholde saye ony good worde for me they sholde not saye trouth of me & casteth to me that peryll that no body wolde gyue credence vn∣to them yf they wolde saye well on me but call theym flaterers fals dyssymulours and flaterers of synne. Alas alas I haue heuyly dyspēded my longe lyfe that
in all this longe tyme haue not purchased me. One frende to speke for me had our lorde of his moost am∣ple grace ordeyned me unmedyatly after my crysten∣dome to haue dyed forth with I myght saye I had be borne in a gracyous houre. But wolde it please your goodnes to speke for me and vnderstande whether I shall haue hardynes to make a byll to the blessyd lady and moost holy vyrgyn that euer was and she that dysdayneth not nor denyeth not sȳnard sȳners whan they call after grace. Notwithstandynge her chastyte and her pure virgynyte excelleth all other virgyns. Now good go your waye & lette me wete how I shall spede for all this tyme I lyue in suche drede & fere that me were better dye anone than lyue ony lenger in the drede that I am in. And also I haue so grete drede & fere of the ryghtwysnes of almyghty god that I am almoost deed for fere. For reason drede & conscyence sayd to me full shortly that the hyghe Iuge wolde not be percyall nor he wolde not be corrupte with good but he wyll mynyster to me Iustyce certaynly but and he atteyneth to mynystre to me Iustyce without fauour I wyll appele to his mercyes certaynly for other reme¦dy is ther̄ none par de. Origene our blessyd lady helpe Thyofull / & syr Emery how sholde they haue done ne the moder of mercy had ben & many another synner that her grace hath holpe. She is quene of heuen lady of the worlde and empresse of hell / and saynge to her sone cryst Ihesu hath dyed & suffred so tourmentous a deth & in her owne syght to her grete socour and mo¦therly compassyon I hope she wolde be loth that theke precyous passyon sholde be loste in ony creature that her blessyd sone suffred so pacyently.
¶ The answere of fayth & hope to ye dyenge creature. HAue ye none acqueyntaunce wyth our brother Charyte we meruayle that ye haue not spoken of hym in all this tyme / for and ye were Ioyned with vs twayne your message sholde be the more accepta∣bly herde manyfolde. ¶ The lamentable complaynt of the dyenge creature to fayth hope and charyte. CErtaynly I haue but lytell deled with hym. I was neuer conuersaunt with hym & that me re¦penteth now / for I fele by you twayne that he may do moche in the hygh courte. I haue more deled with ven¦geaunce than I haue with charyte / for I wolde haue ben auenged vpon euery man by my wyll whan the people had slayne my chyldren my kyn my frendes & robbed & spoyled my selfe certaynly I wolde haue ben a wroke ryght fayne and I had had power to my wyll but though my power were lytell certaynly I haue ha¦ted them and wylled them to haue ben done to as they haue done to me / and wel I wote that is not the ordre of charyte. But now I hertely crye god mercy our bles∣sed lady & you holy charyte of the that myn enemyes here afore god oure blessed lady & you thre. I forgyue them all that they haue done agaynst me / & wyl not be auenged thought I myght: And I pray you holy cha∣ryte thoughe it were longe or I were acqueynted with you be not the lother to doo for me I sore repente me that I haue thus vnresonably & vnwyttyngely absen∣ted me frome you & hertely I crye you mercy / & praye
