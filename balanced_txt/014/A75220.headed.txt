1682 Astrological Observations AND Predictions for the Year of our Lord 1682. Wherein are briefly shewn, the significations of the late COMET, (which appeared most manifestly to us in December 1680.) And of the two great Eclipses of the Moon. AND What Eminent Changes, and Sorrowful Events are likely to happen in many (if not most) Countries in the world, from the In∣fluences of the Three Conjunctions of Saturne and Jupiter (in the fiery sign Leo) in 1682, and 1683. ALSO Monthly Observations For every Month this present year. Briefly containing the most Remarkable Events that are likely to happen in some Nations, Kingdoms, and Cities. By John Silvester. Printed for the Author, 1682,
For the year 1682. Of the late Comet that was seen in December 1680. THIS dreadful Comet (the like whereof (I suppose) was never seen by many (if any) generation before us) that appeared most manifestly in England in December 1680. Seemed (when I first saw it) to shew it self about the begining of the second face of Capricorn, between the bodies of the Sun and the Planet Mercu∣ry, and near the opposite place of Saturn; but I received advice from a friend of mine, that this Comets first appearance was in the watry sign Scorpio, the house of the fiery Plannet Mars; and that it was seen before the sun rising, on the 25th of November, at six of the clock in the morning: But in what sign soever it had its begining or birth, it was observed to appear in a sign of every Triplicity, which certainly denotes varieties of evils, distinguished sufficiently in my last years little book, to which I referr'd the Reader; but whereas it appeared most powerfully to us in Capricorn and Aquaries, and more weakly in Pisses; (and Aries the assendant of England and France, where it was supposed to have been extinguisht) therefore those places under Capricorn and A∣quaries will be subject to the most woful effects; never the lesse, I fear those places under Aries will be subject to afflictions, that will be bad enough, for though it appeared very weakly therein, yet it is pro∣bable enough, that it appeared very powerful and dreadful in many other Countries under Aries, as well as in England, at that time when we beheld it in Capricorn and Aquaries, for Comets do not only ma∣nifest their effects in those Countries, under the signs wherein they ap∣peared,
but also in those Countries where they appeared most dread∣full and most visible, and therefore it may be feared that the effects of this dreadful Comet, appertaines to many forreign Countries, and that God is preparing woes fo many Nations, if not for most nations in the World. And whereas the Tayl of this Comet was very long, and the time of its continuance also long, it denotes the strength and pow∣erfulness of its operation (and by consequence the more dreadfulnesse of the effects) and the durability thereof, which will shortly be seconded, and the effects thereof continued, by the powerful operations of no less then three conjunctions of Saturne and Jubiter in the fiery sign Leo; and as this Comet was swift in motion, and run through many signs, so it may be feared that the influence thereof will seem also by its effects to be swift in motion, from one Countrey to an other; and whereas the Star it self (or Comets body) seemed to be very small, that it uld not (first espeasily) be easily diserned, and a very dreadful and visible stream or Tayl issued from it, from hence it may (not groundlessly) be conjectu∣red that there will be many secret and close conspiraces and contrivan∣ces in many Countries, out of which there will go very visible streams of wrathfull furious wicked and treaterous actions, (or more plainly such effects from the violent breaking forth of some Plot or Plots) I have heard reports of other Comets that have been seen, but I have not seen them my self, but I received intelligence from a friend of mine that on Thursday the 24 day of March 1681 about eleven of the clock at night, there were seen in their town by divers Persons of good credit two dreadful Meteors, near the Moon, by their declaring the one in Virgo, be∣fore the Moon, the other in Scorpio, following the Moon, which Meteors much terrified & affrighted the spectatours. Comets and fiery Meteros are tokens of many hot and dry exhalations in the aire, which so dry up the humours in men, and increase cholor that they are easily stirred up to quarrels, after which follows blows, warrs and bloudshed, and conse∣quently alterations of Laws and Customs in many places. Comets are dreadful objects to mens eies, Gods angry Warnings, heavenly rarities, That still proclaime Gods wrath, some Kingdomes w, Plagues, or great Sickness, bloudy Warres also.
Of the signification of the two great Eclipses of the Moon in February and August in the year 1682. THe first great Eclipse of the Moon will be on the Eleventh day of February about Eleven at night: Which denotes crosses, losses, and sickness to happen to Saylors, Merchants, Scribes, Students, and many Noble men, and that many such will be in danger of being oppress∣ed some way by the wrath of Princes: It denotes some kind of hurt to the fruits of the Earth, and to Corn, and I doubt it will cause many dis∣cords amongst men, and many distempers of the brain, if not absolute madness: It allso denotes turbulant and pernitious winds, and much thunder, and lightning, and some more then ordinary stir about Reli∣gion. Its effects will cheifly be manifest in the countries and places un∣der Ʋirgo, Pisses, Sagittarius (and Gemini the ascendant of London) and (according to the oppinion of the Antients) it will manifestly operate in July and so continue for about four months. THe second great Eclipse of the Moon will happen on the Eight day of August, about Six in the morning (but invisible to us:) This threatens the Earths Inhabitants either with the Plague, or some very dangerous and destructive sicknesses, and mortality, and with scarcity or dearness of Corn. It denotes the ruine of Ancient Buildings, Divisions, and hatred amongst Professors of Religion: Imprisonment and Captivity: Great variances and disunity in Councils, high winds and Tempests at sea, dangerous sailing. It denotes destruction to Fishes, and to small Cat∣tle, (it hath a wofull signification, whether people will believe or not:) it may cause madnesse or some very bad distempers in the brain. It also denotes the overflowing of Rivers: it very much threatens Samaria, Ethiopia, Italy, Sicily, Bohemia and some part of Turky, Hamborrough, Rome, Prague, Bristol— and in a lesse measure Ireland, Russia, Persia, Cappadocia, Barbary Frankford upon Odar, Valentia in Spain; But (according to Astrologicall rules) it will not very manifestly operate till about the month of July 1683 and from thence will so continue a∣bout four months. Sorrows attend the world, when 'clipses great, With many rare conjunctions opperate, With Comets too whose strange united force, May make unsetl'ed times yet worse and worse. Let's all lament, repent, and pray that we May scape dearth, warrs and plague, in eighty three, And also in eighty four,
But in the world there are many unbelieving people, and ignorant enemies of Astrological Predictions, that think I have too much affrighted the nation, by my judgment in my other little book, and per∣haps, may think I have done the like now, and so will not believe that God hath given such power to Stars, Planets, Comets, or any Heavenly bo∣dies to cause those effects on earth, but rather (through their ignorance) think that God usualy causeth most effects without them: but let them consider the Moon, and how God is pleased to tumble about the waters thereby, and not without the Moon: and let them consider the Sun, and how God thereby causeth the earth and trees to bring forth there increase and fruit thereof, and not without the Sun; and as it hath pleased God to set the two great lights of Heaven in offices, very manifest to the world; in like manner he was pleased to give all the other Planets, and lesser Lights of Heaven; offices and power, (when the first treated them) according to their natures, to effect his will and purpose on Earth: Moreover God that made all things, can at his pleasure, make use of all other his crea∣tures, so that he will not be confined, to work only by the Starres, or only secretly and internally by his spirit, but what other wayes he pleas∣eth, so that the Maker of all, works, in and by all, and is therefore God over all, and is worthy of all praise, honour, and worship from all. There∣fore it is no dishonour to God, to say he causeth effects on Earth by Stars above, but they rather rob their Maker of his Glory, that contend against this Sublime and Heavenly Science; as if it were unlawfull for us to lift up our eyes to the Heavens, that declare the Glory of God, and to the Firmament (wherein are fixed so many glittering and glorius Orna∣ments) that sheweth his handy work. But there are iversities of natural gifts, And therefore to one it is given to know those things above ano∣ther: nd further, to convince those unbelievers of the truth, and cer∣tainty of the Influences of all Celestial bodies, let them look back to the year 1664 wherein there appeared a Comet, and to the year 1663, where there happened a great Conjunction of Saturne and Jupiter, in the fiery sign Sagittarius, and to the year 1659, when the fourteenth revolution of the great Orb since the Creation was per∣fected: I say, let them look back and consider if since those yeares there have not happened very remarkable Terrestrial Changes, and wonderfull Events according to the rules of (and conseqently promotive to) the rare, and highly to be esteemed Science of Astrology The Loadstone's secret vertue can command, And strangely turn the Needle to each hand: So ev'ry creature, that hath life and sense, Is govern'd by the starry influence.
Of the Three Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter in the fiery sign Leo now near at hand; whereof one will happen on the 9th day of October 1682. and one, on the 30th of January following, & the last, on the 2d day of May following. It is both rare and wonderfull that those Two superiour Planets should be no lesse than three times conjoyned (in somewhat lesse than seven Months) in the fiery sign Leo; there having been but only one Con∣junction there above these 700 yeares. And therefore those Three Conjunctions proclaim a threefold woe to the Inhabitants of the Earth, (though many may not believe it;) but cheifly to the Countrys, Cityes, Townes, Villages, and Persons, under the sign Leo: Therefore wo, wo, and a third wo, to Italy, Sicily, Bohemia and some part of Turky, to the City of Damascus, and chiefly to the City of Rome, the fountain of Po∣pery, follie and wickednesse, for those Conjunctions that happen in the fi∣ery rigon, do chiefly respect Men, Matters, and Places of the highest account; (the Pope, Popery, and Rome have too long been so) that I con∣clude this Triple, or Threefold Conjunction in Leo (the ascendant of Rome and all Italy) will in a few yeares either strike of his Triple Crown, or give him three terrible strokes, whereby he will loose the greatest part of his Honour, Power, and Majesty on earth, for the strokes will be the more dreadfull, because of the Two other Conjunctions, viz. of Jupiter and Mars: and Saturn and Mars, in the same sign Leo, near the degree of the first Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter: Jupiter is too ver∣tuous a Planet to own the Pope, or his Orders, but it being more natural to him to own good Christians, he hath assigned the Pope up to Saturn, the Author of Plots and mischief: and Saturn being weaker than Jupiter in the conflict (for they'l have a Combat when they are in Conjunction because of the contrariety of their natures, Saturn being cold and dry, and the greatest infortune, and Jupiter being hot and moist, and the greatest fortne) therefore the Pope and his Orders, in a few years, must needs have a great Downfal; for Jupiter is not only stronger than Saturn, but is resolved to fight with his adversary, three times, in somewhat lesse than seaven Months, with the undaunted courage of a Lyon. Oh Rome thy abominations have been Great, and thy Great sinnes remaihst which thy Great head (the Pope;) hath to the Great dishonour ofned Great God undertook to pardon; But now the Great year is at hand, and thy Great sorrowes are approaching, and thy foundation will Greatly be shaken, because it is not the Rock of Ages, the sure foundation; Great Judgments are preparing for thee: Never yet (I suppose) received
thou such terrible strokes (Since thou wast first called Rome) as those (in few years) are like to be. Quamobrem gaudeamus & maxime laetemur: God hath not made Celestial works in vain, But in them pow'r and vertue great remain: They cause effects on earth, by them we know That God is working changes here below. Of the Lord of the year Saturn laies claim to be Lord of the year, because he hath the greatest Dignities in the Hylegiacal places of the three Vernal figures, and he and the Moon are both in the Lyon, in an Angle of strife (the house of war) and his Lord is with the body of Mars, partly through which, and partly through the great Dignities that Mars hath in the Hylegiacal places of the Vernal figure, we may joyn him as a Copartner with Sa∣turn: the Angles being also more fixt than Moveable, that strong stedfast (and not much whiffling) will the resolutions of many discontented Martial minded persons be, to carry on weighty (but wicked) designes; that this is likely enough to be a year of evil conspiracies and of great disunity, and rather of Martial activity than of dronishnesse, and the bet∣ter to satisfy all friendly Readers I referre them to my Monthly Obser∣vations following Monthly Observations, breifly containing the most re∣markable events and accidents that are likely to hap∣pen in every particular Month this present year 1682. Ianuary's Observations THe hearts of the Comonaltie now entertain much hatred and enmity a∣gainst some persons in Authority: some of whom act very politickly, & secretly against them, as if they aimed at some further treacherous actions: that it is yet improper to call this a month of compleat unity: Rulers and Ma∣gistrates of many Countries and Cities can hardly keep in any sound unity a∣mongst themselves: some great controversies now happen in Rome and in ma∣ny other places under the fiery sign Leo, amongst persons both of mean and
great account: many are now imprisoned: Scotland and Holland will now be more at peace than many other places; and pretty good unity is likely to be in their Councills; yet I fear some imperfection through some religious disputes (not very contentious) amongst some of different religions: dangerous di∣stempers amongst Cattle great and small: some alteration of weather about the 12, or 13 day. When starrs dissent in heav'n, on earth they sow, Contentious seeds in humane hearts below: That God by them our comforts would increase! Banish our woes, proclaime Celestial peace! Febuary's Observations MUch hatred, trouble, and discontent, remains in peoples minds concerning some late difference, and one domineers over another especially in those Countries Cities and Places under the fiery sign Leo: Let us beware of The∣veries, and breaking open of shops, and houses, and all private mischievous acti∣ons; I confesse many benevolent Aspects happen this month, but all is not Gold that glisters: Magistrates are now angry with some religious Professors: Seamen now much perplexed with high winds and tossing weaves: Diseases of Melancholy now chiefly take possession of mens bodies at the beginning of this month, and diseases of Choler at the latter end: a probability of rain or snow, on, or about, the 9, 22, or 23 day. The smiling looks of wand'ring starrs above, Incline our hearts the more to peace and love; But there's a seed that will arise I doubt And turn unstable love to faling out. March's Observations THe hearts of the Comonalty are none pretty much linked to Superiours, but I doubt the hearts of Superiours will not be so well linkt to each other: The Comonalty of many places will be verl apt to be contentious amongst them∣selves that this is likely to be a month of remarkable debate and variances, not only in En. and France, but in man other Countries and places, that it is very improper to call this a month of peace; though I could wish it were established throughout all the Earth: The London Apprentices are now very Couragious and high spirited, and will be very apt to give affronts: this month or the next Magistrates will have inclinations to oppresse some sort of Meeters: many suffer by imprisonment, if not by Iron chains also; especially at London: danger of some robberies and theeveries. This month ends; or the next begins with
come remarkable consultations: much sicknesse: much rain and wind, about the 23 day, and at the months end. What hurly burly's this in heav'n, that I, No lesse than Planets Five in Aries spy. Lucina changes in that high degree, Where Kingly Sol will still exalted be. April's Observations. GReat consultations, variances in Councells: tumultuous contriversies in many places: much policy in men's brains, and great conrage in many hearts: Rulers or Magistrates some way displeased by some sort of religious Professors, whence ensue hot and angry disputes and sharp words: a little danger, of some disturbance in Ireland: some common persons promoted, or raised unto some higher degree, or pretty high offices, others dejected: Cattle (especially the smaller sort) now very subject to diseases and distempers: Close, secret, and very private stealing: people will now either be subject to madnesse or some kind of frantick fits: many suffer punishment by the French disease (ergo cavete & abstinete qui amatis valitudines) a sickly season: much rain during the first half of this month, or till the 20 day. When Sol and Luna both together move, And are conjoyn'd in heav'nly Orbs above, 'Tis rare to see Five Planets of the Seven Parling and jarring in the midst of heav'n. May's Observations THe thoughts of some late quarrel yet remaine in many hearts, who being but subjects are now so high and lofty spirited and couragious, that they even scorn to be trodden by those of higher degree: I am afraid this will prove ahmonth of very great controversies in many places especially in Br— and ce places under Leo: all is not well in Ireland: let us beware of all close ontrivances and treacherous actions which are now much to feared: let Br— beware of fire and all evill events: very great contentions arise in bargaining and between men and their wives: very dangerous sicknesses, hard and very difficult to be cured now sceiz on the bodies of men, and it will strike hard ta the heart and head: much rain on or about the 16 day, and the 29 or 30. Next Month (I deem) will shew's the reason why, Five Planets now consult in Gemini. They parle, and with great fury are possest, And if some past debate's yet in the breast
Iune's Observations. I Confesse the two fortunes are now both in Cancer, which may well be supposed to be a good preservative to Scotland and Holland: but about the beginning, and latter end, great variances in many places may be feared: I doubt the latter end of this moneth, or some part of the next, will prove a season of some evill activity; that some Plot and treacherous disign may very secretly and politick∣ly be carried on in the City of London, against the Rulers and Supream Power of the Nation; let the places under Gemini and Leo chiefly beware of all evill events. Let none be offended at my good counsell; forewarned, half armed: ma∣ny theeveries and robberies happen this moneth and dangerous sicknesses seiz on the bodies of people: raine about the 12 or 13 day, and about the 26, or 27, day: a probabilty of thunder about the 8, and 23 day. Great secrets are in heav'nly sheets enroll'd, And I the secrets of the heav'ns unfold; Those heav'nly words of Starry letters made, I now Translate, that every one may read. Iuly's Observations. MIschieveous intents possesse the hearts of many: great envy reignes and rules with great subitlty, policy and secrey in the hearts of some pre∣tended subjects, whose aimes are to effect their evil designs, against the Powers and Rulers, which they ought to be submissive unto: very great variances a∣mongst high and low: great wrath and fury, and great disturbances in many places, especially in those Countries, Cities, and Places, under the signes Gemi∣ni, Sagittarius, Leo, and Aquarius: Let London beware of some Plot: Holland and Scotland are some what disquieted. I doe not possitively couclude that this great wrath will produce warrs or battles this moneth, though it may be feared yet I rather believe the matter is not yet ripe enough but however the ripening time is at hand, and the next year drawes nigh, without doubt warrs and great disturbances amongst many Nations are near: The great Eclipse of the Moon in February begins now manifestly to operate: The moneth is like to prove extream sickly, abundance dye: a probability of Rain on or about the 10 day, and the 23, and 24, and the likeliest days for thunder and lightning are the 7, 14, and 22 day, if not raine withall. When Kingly Sol to Saturn comes; the Moon Comes quickly to him too; but then to soon
She hastens to the discontented Sun And from him with Saturnine light doth run August's Observations THe Comonalty now sigh for quiet times and mightily desire peace but at the latter end of the month (and I doubt in the next month also) very terrible actions and tumultuous controversies and great wrath (if not worse) are likely to be the sad events thereof, which I greatly fear will be car∣ried on with very great subtilty and with close and secret conspiracies: what Plots and mischievous designes are now in our daies in the hearts of men! it is no Joy to me that I cannot bring tidings of peace: great variances, divisions and distractions in some part of urky, in Bohemia, in Italy, especially at Rome, many quarells in the Cities of Br— and O— many leagues and friendships broken: so that the latter end of this month, and I doubt the next month to, (chiefly in the places aforesaid) will prove time of much action and consultation, and great controversies amongst high and low: differences in Councills and amongst Superiours in Scotland and Holland: this month man great robberies: terrible strife betwixt men and thier wives: dangerous sea voyage: an extream sickly season, abundance die, I mean at the letter end of the month schiefly, and at the beginning of the next: likel hood of some thunder and lightning with rain about the 5, 6, or 7, day, also rain on, or about, the 21 day, and the 27, and 28 da. Tour Planets in the Lyon fierce conspire: Why they'l associate in the westerne angle, The house of strife where Planets best can wrangle September's Observations I Cannot yet find the tokens of a peaceable season, but rather of great desunity and controversies amongst high and low this month (and I doubt the next to) and they are both likely to prove months of remark able actions and events, and turbulent doings: this month there happens one Conjunction of Jupiter and Mars, and another conjunction of the two unfortunate Planets Saturn and Mars, and therefore I cannot but believe that tumultuous controversies (if not worse effects) will attend many Nations, Cities, and places: I doubt the L— Apprentices will be resolute for some Martial activity this month or the next
also it will not be amisse for London chiefly to be some what wary of fire this month or the next: we may expect abundance of rain, wind, and blustring weather this month, and it chiefly happens on or about 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 30, daies so that we are like to have turbulent wea∣ther most part of this moneth. Just as bright Sol the spring of glorious light, Doth equallize and ballance day and night. The three Superious in the heav'ns contend, And darts of fury to great pow'rs do send. October's Observations. THis is the month wherein the two superiour Planets Saturn and Jubi∣ter make their first conjunction in the fiery sign Leo; that this is not like to prove a month of great variance and disunity but allso we may expect henceforth Martial preparations in many Nations, and they will more certain∣ly assure us of those earthly troubles, b their two other Conjunctions, in next January and May, that I must needs conclude that the year 1683, and 1684, will make many men sensible of a great part of the sad effects of those three Conjunctions: a likelyhood of rain or hail, on or about, the 8, 9, 10, 15, 28 day. This month the two Superiours are conjoyn'd, And in the fiery Trigon are combin'd, Their meeting still great changes doth foreshew To happen in the Regious here below. November's Observations THis month is likely to be more peaceable than the former, but I doubt their will happen disunity and differences in Councills: the Commonalty are very apt now to deride some persons in Authority: Women with Child now very apt to receive hurt, therefore they ought to have the greater care to pre∣vent miscarriages: high winds at Sea, and tossing waves obstructing the Seamen Cattle great and small pretty subject to distempers & sickness: Magistrates op∣pose Professors of Religion with very high words: dark, cloudy, if not rain, hail, or snow, on or about 2, the 10, 11, 24, 25, da False cow'rdly Saturn backward slinks from Jove, Jove spies him, and soon backward to doth move; He runs with Lyons strength; be seemes not weary, He over takes his foe in January.
Decembers Observations. THe hearts of most Professors are now full of zeal, and are apt to be dis∣quiated by some inferiour persons: Magistrates now apt to deride Professours for their waies and practices, and withall to use some kind of violence to disturb some sort of meetings this month or the next: many suf∣fer imprisonment: many theeveries happen or losses: sea voages will be dan∣gerous this month and the next: some shipwracks and skirmages on the wa∣ters: the Planet Mars is now entered into Libra the opposite sign to Aries (the ascendent of England and France) and staes there in no lesse time than a∣bout seaven months and a half; I wish this quarelsome Planet cause not tha: which is worse then common variences and disturbances in, or against England the next spring or summer France will be in the same danger: yet I doe not conclude that Mars alone so posited is a sufficient ground for us to fear a∣ny such thing, but he will then be more to be feared than in any other years, because he will he assisted no less then with three conjuuctions of Saturn and Jubiter in the fiery sign Leo, after one of which alone usuall follows Warrs, in or amongst Nations and Kingdoms; let us consider then what great Warrs and terrible bloodshedings are likely to follow Three: I fear sad times are near at hand, with divers great changes and alterations, though divers igno∣rant selfconseited persons may now be apt to deride me, but they may become a derision themselves when my Predictions are fulfilled: we may expect some change of weather on or about the 21, 22, 23, and 29th day. When Phaebus bright his downward course hath ended, And to the winter Trophick hath desended, Mars claimes high rule, stands at the door of blisse, As if he would Jov's real freind opresse, this moneth or the next. IT is known to my self, and some others, that most things that I Predicted in my last years monthly observations, have hitherto been fulfilled, and where I failed, there I hit very near, but bitter envy and doting ignorance have ever been apt to despise and trample upon the works of prudence and experience, though ever so ponderous and consideraete. However to all the reall lovers of Celestial Sciences I benevolently commit my Annuall and Monthly Observa∣tions for the year 1682. FINIS.
