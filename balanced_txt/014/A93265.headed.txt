A LAMENTATION FOR THE Lost Sheep Of the House of ISRAEL. With an Invitation to have them turne in their minds to the true Shepheard of their souls. ALSO Something in discovery of the nakednesse of all professions who are found in the words without the life and power. Written by one of the children of the Light, who is known to the world by the name of MARTMA SIMMONS. I have seene also in the Prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing, they commit adultery, and walke in lies; they strengthen also the hand of evill doers, that none doth return from his wicked∣nesse; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabi∣tants thereof as Gomorah, Jer. 23.14. Awake awake put on thy strength O Sion, put on thy beautifull garments O Jerusalem, the holy City, for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean, Isa. 52.1. Octob: 20 LONDON: Printed for Giles Calvert at the Blackspread Eagle at the West end of Pauls. 1655.
A LAMENTATION For the lost Sheep of the House of Israel. OH England England when art thou; groping in the darke and stumbling at noon day; art thou grown so high in thy fallen wisdome, and in the pride of thy heart, that thou canst not stoop to a measure of God in thee? thou high professor, and thou wilde wan∣ton one, thou runst to fast over the field to finde the Pearle; there is a Royall Diadem hid in thy uncleane heart, which never consented to the evill thereof; Oh that thou wouldst harken to it that thy inward eye might be opened, then wouldst thou see the beauty of it: sure∣ly if thou didst but see thy soule in death, and a measure of the light and life of Jesus there, checking, calling, and knocking, to have thee turne in thy minde to it, that thou mayest be purged and oleansed, and that it may shine forth and bring up thy soule out of the horrible pit; then wouldst thou begin to know indeed what pure redempti∣on is: And here mayest thou come to see that faith which purifies the heart, which is the reall substance of things hoped for, and this would be of more value to thee then thousands of Gold and Silver: Oh vaine and foo∣lish
man and woman that maketh not God thy trust, but trusts in the arme of flesh, and in the multitude of thy con∣ceivings; how soone art thou affrighted and palenesse strikes thee in the face, and the least stirring or rushing in the creation makes thy knees smite together and thy coun∣tenance fall, and this is because thou art in Caines conditi∣on, and hast no habitation in God; and though thou mayest offer a Sacrifice, and pray, and cry, and confesse thy sinnes, and cover the Alter with teares, and give thy body to be burnt, it in that nature it is not accep∣ted. But this I shall say to thee, Oh that thou couldst but hear; if thou wouldst but submit thy neck to the yoak of Christ, the measure of him in thee, that thou mayest see him to work in thee and thy own workes laid aside, thou wouldst finde more peace and satisfaction both to soule and body; and then shouldst thou see him who is the Rock of ages to be thy Rock, and strong defence, and then shouldst thou see a war begin contrary to thy will and him that brings into the war and carries through, and then there would be no∣thing to doe on thy part but to stand still and keep thy minde in, girt up to him that workes, and then thou wilt come to see what it is to follow the Lamb through the tri∣bulation; but if thou wilt not improve thy measure of Light, but wilt run on in thy headstrong rebellion against that little secret love that checks thee in private, and shewes thee thy heart when none else can, and if thou slight this day of small things, then will this precious Pearl, the measure of Light, be taken from thee and given to him that is more worthy; and the gnawing worme will enter into thee, which will never die, but will torment thee to all eternity, and then wilt thou be shut up in dark∣nesse and unbeliefe; where thou mayest say to thy soule, take thy thine ease, eate drink and be merry, for to morrow shall be as this day, and much more; but thou foole in this night, of thy darknesse, shall thy soule be taken from thee, and then what will thy small time of pleasures doe thee
good? will they not ad to thy torment? therefore I coun∣sell thee to prise thy time, and be still and staid and seek dilligently for that messenger, who is one of a thousand, who brings the glad tidings, who is the true teacher that cannot be removed into a corner, the corner stone, who if thou abide will break thy heart to peeces, and will con∣vince thee of thy sinne, and of thy righteousnesse, and bring his pure Judgements upon it, that his rghteousnesse may appear. And now to you high Priests of this Nation; and tea∣chers of all sorts of opinions, who have been groping and hunting in your wisdome to finde out that precious Pearle to defile in your filthy nature; but you have not yet found it, nor cannot finde the doore to enter into the kingdome, nor get your starved hearers a little bread of assurance of eternal life; only this you can do to ad to your condem∣nation, gather up the Saints conditions of sufferings and patience, who were persecuted by the same proud high flowne nature that you are in, and you add your meanings to them, and so bring the curses that are written in that book upon your heads, it is time for you now, seeing you cannot finde a way, to give over stealing from your neigh∣bour, and be content with that you have, and let the peo∣ple alone to the measure of God in them, that that may guide them into the way that they may finde bread for their soules; and seeing you will not enter your selves, do not shut the kingdome against them, in laying stumbling blocks before them, and raising up false accusations against the Light and those that walk in it, and casting a lie into the mouths of the ignorant people, in saying the letter is the word, when the letter declares that the word was in the beginning, by which word the world was made, which word all the Saints and servants of God was ever guided by; which word enquired of your father Caine for Abels blood, which word translated Enoch, which word called Abraham out of his own country to follow the Lord in a strange land, who was no vagrant person, which word
called Moses from the glory of Pharaohs house, which word in due time was made marisest in flesh, who wande∣red up and down n dens and caves of the earth, who had no certaine abiding place, and yet he was no vagabond, whom your generation crucified, who is risen againe, and hath taken upon him the seed of Abraham, who is now appeared in this day of his power, to gather up his elect into himselfe, and to rip off all your deceitfull coverings, and lay you open to the shame of the Heathen; and this is the word that we witnesse to lead and guide and com∣mand us whose mindes are staid in it; and this word moves us into your Idols temple, and to other private mee∣tings, to discover your Image of mixture of severall opini∣ons, untill you stop our mouths, and hale us forth, and de∣liver us up to your Rulers, who second you in your per∣secution, who imprison us, and scourge, and stock, and stone, and despitefully use us, and by the power of this word are we brought through these tribulations, and have joy in the midst of them, and when we are reviled we re∣vile not againe taking patiently all that you have power in your wills to inflict upon us, and we are made able to desire the Lord not today these things to your charge, and that he would open your eyes that you might see what you are a doing, and the  would soon cease your rage and finde enough to doe within in your own hearts; and by this word we see the Scriptures were given forth from this word, and as we come into these severall conditions and measures that the Saints were in that spake forth this De∣claration, we can set to our seale that the Scriptures are true, and they are ours that live in the life, and not yours who despise the life, and feed your selves with words, and gather up to your selves great riches, in that nature, you eate greedily of the tree of knowledge, and now if you could but get to eate of the tree of life you would soon be above God, but that you cannot doe, for there stands a flaming sword that turns every way to keep you out, so that all that comes there comes through it and leaves all
the first wisdome behinde; and therefore if any of you be found worthy to come down to the measure of Christ and submit your necks to his yoak it will be good for you, but not many rich nor many wise doe come to know these things; and we have the Promise of this word, that he will be with us unto the end of the world, and we know that his Promise is yea and amen. And now all people that hath sobriety, and love to your souls, come out from among these Idoll dumb Shepheards that feed themselves, but not you, and if you put not in∣to their mouths they will soon shew violence to you: come out from among them, and be no longer partaker of their uncleannesse, for they are broken cisterns that can no longer hold water; and come into the fountaine that runs forth freely, the streams whereof would refresh your hun∣gry fainting soules: in my fathers house there is bread e∣nough: Oh why will you perish for hunger? minde the light the measure of Christ in you, that with it you may see where you are, that you may see his eternal love, how he calls and invites you into the kingdome, that he may take off your filthy garments, that he may cloath you with the garment of righteousnesse, and marry you unto himselfe; and now the day of his mighty power is appeared, and the fountaine of life set open to wash and cleanse you from your sinnes, and baptize you into his death and sufferings: Oh be not stubborn and stiffe-necked against him, for we that doe follow him doe finde his paths pleasant pure and sweet, and the further we follow him in the straight gate and narrow way, we see that his love is past finding out: And now in the tendernesse of my heart longing for your soules good am I made open to you, having had a habita∣tion in this City of London sometime; for seven years to∣gether I wandered up and down the streets enquiring of those that had the Image of honestie in their countenance, where I might finde an honest Minister, for I saw my soul in death, and that I was in the first nature, and wandring from one Idolls temple to another, and from one private
meeting to another, I heard a sound of words amongst them but no substance I could finde, and the more I sought af∣ter them the more trouble came on me, and finding none sensible of my condition, I kept it in, and kept all close within me; and about the end of seven years hunting, and finding no rest, the Lord opened a little glimerings of light to me, and quieted my spirit; and then for about seven years more he kept me still from running after men, and all this time I durst not meddle with any thing of God, nor scarce take his name in my mouth, because I knew him not, it living wilde and wanton not knowing a crosse to my will I spent this time; it something I found breathing in me groaning for deliverance, crying out, oh when shall I see the day of thy appearance; about the end of the last seven years the Lord opened my eyes to see a measure of himselfe in me, which when I saw I waited diligently in it, and being faithfull to it I found this Light more and more increase, which brought me into a day of trouble, and through it, and through a warefare and to the end of it, and now hath given me a resting place with him; and this is my beloved, and this is my friend O daughters of Jerusa∣lem: And now all that have a desire to come this way must lay down your Crowns at the feet of Jesus, for now a profession of words will no longer cover, for the Lord is come to look for fruit, all types and shaddowes is flying away; and he that will come in may inherit substance, and he that will not shall be left naked. FINIS.
