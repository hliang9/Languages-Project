REASONS Humbly Offered to the High Court of Parliament, To shew the great Dammage the Publick Receives by the Ill Flawing of Raw-Hides and Calves-Skins. WHereas by the Statute of the First of King James the First, Chap. 22. Provision is made, against the Ill Flawing of Raw-Hides, but by the smallness of the Penalty, being but Twenty Pence, and the difficulty of the Prosecution, being by Action of Debt, the same is become Ineffectual. II. There is no Provision, by any Law, against the Ill Flawing of Calves-Skins, which are now become a great Ware in Bootes and Shoes. III. The Nobillity and Gentry receive great Dammage in their Coaches and Harnesses, by their often breaking and receiving wet through the Flaws, which cannot be so well discerned when wrought up. IV. The Commonalty receive great Dammage, in their Bootes, Shoes, Bridles and Stirrup-Leathers, by Holes wearing in the Upper-Leathers, and taking Water in the Soles of the Shoes; to the Indangering the Healthes of the Wearers: And by the Bridles and Stirrup-Leathers breaking, Indangering Peoples Lives. V. Hereby many Hides and Skins are Rendred unfit for many Special Uses, which tendes much to the lessening of the Commodity, in the Price thereof, to the value of above One Thousand Pounds per Annum in Leaden-Hall-Market, as is ready to be Attested by many Credible Persons. And what must the Dammage then be in all the other Markets in the Kingdome? From several of which there is great Complaints: And all this to the loss of the whole Nation, and Profit to none. VI. These Abuses are now become so General, that the Buyers of Leather cannot Buy One Parcel in Ten but what is much Abused thereby, so that they are forced to Work it up into made Wares with these Defects, or else must sustain great Losses.
