ADVERTISEMENT. WHereas formerly the Sick could have advice (at the An∣gel and Crown in King. Street near Cheapside) in the afternoons only. Now for the greater ease and benefit of Pa∣tients, there will be constant attendance there every day from nine in the morning 'till twelve, and from two in the after∣noon 'till six. Persons of all ranks may have advice on such terms as are suitable to their abilities, they themselves being judges, no∣thing having been at any time peremptorily demanded of any one of those many thousands that have apply'd themselves for advice. The medicines are faithfully prepar'd and dispenced to the Poor at very low rates, and to them advice is freely imparted for nothing.
