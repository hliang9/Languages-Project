SIRS, THE Favours that I have received from Your Excellency since Your Ac∣cession to this Government, and from You the Honourable Members of His Majesty's Council here, as also from You the Worthy and Wor∣shipful Representatives of the People in our General Assembly, and from the Inhabitants of this Island in general, have been so many and Eminent, that I cannot but be truly sensible they exceed all possibility of a just Compensation. Nor do I presume that the Compilement of this Tract of the LAWS (now in all hu∣mility dedicated to Your Excellency, Council and General Assembly) ought in any measure to be esteemed worthy to be taken as any part of a Retribution. Nor did I attempt this Work upon any such Motive, but purely that I was convinced that every Man is a Debtor to his Country and Profession; and therefore could not but think my self obliged in Duty to exert my utmost Efforts in some Service for the good of this Island, as lay most proper for my Post and Profession, of which I con∣jectured, that a Collection of the LAWS would be most acceptable, especially considering the numerous Disadvantages daily suffered for want of it. But as the many Attempts formerly without Effects made towards such a Col∣lection, convincingly shewed the difficulty of the Task, so it did as manifestly de∣clare the general Benefit that was aimed at, and expected from such a Performance, and thereby confirmed me in my former Opinion, and incouraged me to offer some In∣timations of such my Purposes and Designations to the Assembly; which found such an Acceptation, as easily convinced me that I could not better acquit my self of my Duty, than by a Tender of my Endeavours in that Service, whose good Opinion of my poor Abilities, and obliging Commands chiefly induced me to this Undertaking. Though I am sufficiently conscious I am not par Operi, yet hope this well intended Enterprize will give Life and Encouragement to some Abler Person to give it a fi∣nishing Stroak, and bring it to Perfection for the Benefit of this Place and Island, that hath produced and raised many great Estates to several Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither; and also considerable and great Revenues to His Sacred Ma∣jesty, and which on a calm Enquiry into, and serious Consideration of the Customs it payeth for its own Native Commodities Exported hence, the increase of English Trade and Navigation it causeth, the Seamen it thereby breedeth, the Consumption of Goods of English Growth it maketh, will not be found less advantageous to the Crown of England than the best of His Majesty's American Colonies. This may be a sufficient Reason to hope, that since His Gracious Majesty hath been pleased to grant the Power of making LAWS proper for the Constitution of this Island, consonant and agreeable (as near as may be) to the LAWS of his Kingdom of England; That He will also from Your Excellency's Recommendation, extend His wonted Especial Grace and Favour to Us in the passing the Act for the Printing and Establishing of this Collection, which being intended for the Press, hath re∣ceived a strict and full Examination (that it might be Correct) on the Oath as well of the Clerk of the Council from the Records there, and the Clerk of the As∣sembly from the Records of that House; and also of a Committee of the General Assembly, with the Inspection and Approbation of the Honourable Francis Bond, late President, and Honourable the Members of His Majesty's Council here, with the Attorney and Sollicitor General, and now an Authority for its Impression, by Your Excellency's passing the Bill for that purpose. This once Flourishing (but alas! now Withering) Isle, being blest with Your Excellency's Auspicious Presence, cannot but with all Duty and Loyalty rejoyce in His Majesty's great Goodness to, and abundant Care of her, in his Election and Mission of a Person of Your Birth, Honour and Dignity to Govern her,
whose chief Delight consists in an equal distribution of Justice, and a lively and im∣partial Execution of His Majesty's LAWS, and must eternally be obliged with the utmost Gratitude, to acknowledge the Blessing she hath already received from Your Indulgence and Care. You have already opened the long barr'd Gates of her Rights and Priviledges, restor'd her Ancient Charter, and given a new Life to her Laws. You have prescribed and reconciled our late Animosities and Discords, and happily setled Love and Union throughout Your Government, which seems Paternal, and Our Obedience to Your Excellency, bottomed rightly on Love, not (according to the Dreams and Conceits of the Hobbists) upon Fear. So that I cannot omit doing Your Ex∣cellency that Justice, as to declare, You have imitated the most eminent and greatest Examples, viz. Our Illustrious Edward, and Glorious Elizabeth, as well as the Learned and Great Justinian; and therefore may justly be said to be the Life of our Laws, as well as a Pattern of Vertue and Honour. Nor is Your Excellency's high Care and Regard to the Royal Prerogative less observable, by which means You may de Jure claim (because you merit) the Dignity and Authority His Ma∣jesty hath with so much Wisdom and Judgment conferred on You. 'Tis not any Thoughts I have of my own Performance, that tempted me to the Ar∣rogance of prefixing Your Excellency's Name, together with those of the Honou∣rable Council, and General Assembly, to this Treatise, but the Nature and Dig∣nity of the Subject Matter. For who should more rightfully Patronize the LAWS, than those that gave them Being and Birth, and who preserve them by an equal and warm Execution? How excellently fitted and adapted these LAWS are to the good Government of this Place, the many Years we have lived quietly, happily and securely under their Directions and Injunctions, will give a most convincing Testimony, and irrefragable Argument, so as they may not improperly be called as well the Walls of the Colony as of Justice. LAWS are described by Cicero, de Legibus, to be the highest or chiefest Rea∣son grafted in Nature, commanding the things that are to be done, and forbidding the contrary: And Fortescue speaking of the Statute Laws, gives them this En∣comiastick Definition, Lex est Sanctio Sancta, jubens honesta, & prohibens contraria; they are truly the universal Suffrages of Nature propagating Good, and impeading Evil. Without such, Virtue would be without Reward, and Vice without Punishment. LAW is as the Soul in Government, that giveth it Life and Form, and is certainly the best Guard, as well of the King's Prerogative, as of the Peoples Darlings, Liberty and Property. The greatest Strength of Kingdoms, consists in the goodness of their LAWS, they being the Nerves of the Body Politick, and are both Rules and Curbs to the Ministers of Justice, to direct and keep them in the Paths of Honour and Righ∣teousness, and prevent all Arbitrariness in them, (whose Province it should be to distribute Right, equally to Rich and Poor) and their Officers. Infinite are the Bene∣fits which accrew to those that are Partakers of Good Laws; by which, Omne hu∣manum Bonum, our Lives and Fortunes are preserved from Oppression and Abso∣lute Power, our Possessions secured to Posterity, and we in this delightful Island made safe and happy. King Edgar collected the Laws of his Kingdom, and gave them the Strength of a Faggot bound, when as before his time they were loose and dispersed. This gave him more Glory than the Sayling round his Island with a potent Fleet rowed by con∣quered Kings; and was the greatest Action of him or his Predecessors for the Good of his Subjects, the Benefit whereof hath even reached this Age, and encouraged us to follow his glorious Example, by gathering together, and methodizing the loose and scatter'd Laws into one Body, which is done in this Collection, the advantage of which, will (I doubt not) be largely experienced in a short time by all the Inhabi∣tants,
and may be of signal Use to all Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither, particularly to the Professors and Practisers of the Law in England, who have for∣merly wanted them as Directions in Cases upon which their Judgments have been re∣quired. And as our Laws are to be valued and preserved as our chiefest Jewel, so in the framing them, the greatest Care, Prudence and Consideration ought to be had, that they be grounded on true and loyal Principles, always respecting and promoting what is right and just. No private Interest but the Common Good, should be the end and motive of their Constitution; they should also have the duos Sales the Lord Cook mentions as their necessary Ingredients, viz. Salem Sapientiae, ne sint insipidae, & Salem Conscientiae, ne sint Diabolicae. They should also increase rather in Goodness than in Number, which naturally produceth Amazement and Confusion, if not Dis∣cord. For the Government wherein an unanimous Accordance happens, is like a well furnished Quire, where all the Actions, Words and Various Sounds, yield and main∣tain a glorious Harmony. Thus it is evident how great the Benefits are which we receive constantly by good Laws; and thus it is also evident, that the want of such Laws, or a lively Exe∣cution of them, is inconsistent with the true Interest of Mankind, Men without Go∣vernment being worse than Beasts, as having greater means by the advantage of their depraved Reason to do more (yea and more) superlative Mischiefs, when let loose to the Dictates of their Will, such as Rebellion, Murther, Rapines, &c. But as the Miseries and Misfortunes are innumerable, which attend a People that have no Laws, so the Unhappiness of those who have good Ones is not much less, if they be kept from publick View and general Use; for in such Case, what shall direct them to their several Duties? what encourage Obedience, what affright them from Obliquities and Transgressions? To obviate and remove all which Evils and Inconve∣niences, is the prime End and Design of the Publication of this Tract. I fear I have too much trespassed on Your Patience, and by this long Harrangue, rudely invaded those Minutes which You know how much better to dispose of, there∣fore will detain You no longer, but to submit this Piece (such as it is) to Your Ex∣cellency's, and the Honourable and Worshipful Gentlemens Patronage, with a Duty and Devotion becoming SIRS, Your Most Obedient And Most Humble Servant, WILLIAM RAWLIN.
AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER. Courteous Reader, TO the LAWS of general Concernment now in Force, and Printed at large in this Tract, I have added the CONTENTS of several Branches in the Margent, which may serve as an Abridg∣ment of the whole. But of those which concern Pri∣vate Persons or Matters, or are become Obsolete or Ex∣pired, I have only Printed their respective Titles in due place; so as (if occasion should happen) Recourse may be had to the Records in the Offices of this Island for them.

THE LAWS OF BARBADOS. An ACT for Printing the Laws of the Island of Barbados, Contained in the Ensuing Volume. FOrasmuch as nothing more conduceth to the Well-being, Support, Tranquility and Benefit of any Place and People, than the Pre∣servation of their Laws, and the Knowledge of them; and dai∣ly Experience having manifested innumerable Inconveniences that this Island have suffered for so many Years past, by not having the Laws of the Island (by which they are to be regulated and governed, their Lives preserved and their Estates secured to them and their Posterity) made publick and open to the ready View of all the Inhabitants, for want of which, many Persons of great Authority in this Government not being ac∣quainted with all the Laws that are kept in Offices, or, if known, not to be had on suddain Occasions; for want of which also, it often happens in the Multitude of Copies which are taken from the Offices, great Va∣riations and Aberrations are made by heedless and unskilful Transcribers from the Original Laws, and these Copies being obtruded upon Tryals for Authentick, have been the Cause of Unjust and Illegal Determina∣tions. And forasmuch as all our Laws on Record have often been in great Danger to have been wholly lost both by Hurricane and Fire, for Re∣medy of which, and Prevention of many other Inconveniences for the future, and that Rich and Poor may equally have the advantage of free Recourse to the Laws of the Island, as well the Inhabitants, as all other Persons in Parts remote, who have Estates and Interests depending on them, and that the Laws may be collected into one intire Volume: Be it Enacted by his Excellency the Honourable Ralph Grey, Esquire, Captain General, and Chief Governour of this and other the Carribee Islands, the Honourable the Members of his Majesty's Council, and Ge∣neral Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of the same, that the Body of the Laws Collected by William Rawlin, Esq. present Clerk of the Assembly, containing the Laws of the said Island (excepting such as
relate to particular Persons, being private Acts) be forthwith transmitted by the said William Rawlin, or his Assigns into the Kingdom of England, in order to the Printing thereof. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said Book of Laws when Printed as aforesaid, be, and shall be taken, deem∣ed and held a Good Lawful Statute-Book of the said Island of Barbados, in all Courts, and upon all Occasions whatsoever, as the Statute Book of the Laws of England is deemed, held and taken in that Kingdom. And that any Impression of the said Laws, which shall or may be made by any o∣ther Person or Persons whatsoever, and hither Imported, shall be of no manner of Force or Validity in any Courts, or on any Occasion or Oc∣casions within the Island aforesaid. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Person and Persons whatsoever, that shall hither Import and ex∣pose to Sail any of the aforesaid Statute-Books not Printed by the said William Rawlin, his Executors, Administrators or Assigns, that he or they shall forfeit for each Book so Imported and Sold, the Sum of Forty Shil∣lings; one Moyety thereof to his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, and the other Moyety to the said William Rawlin, his Executors, Administrators or Assigns, the same to be recovered before any Justice of the Peace with∣in this Island (as in Case of Servants Wages) due Proof being made thereof. Provided always, and it is the true Intent and Meaning of this Act, that the said William Rawlin, his Executors or Assigns, within Two Years after the Publication hereof, shall be obliged, and are hereby obli∣ged to cause the said Laws to be Printed, and hither transmitted for the Use of the Inhabitants of this Island, he the said William Rawlin and his As∣signs, having the sole Benefit of the Impression and Sale thereof. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said William Rawlin, or any other Clerk of the Assembly for the time be∣ing, have hereby full Power and Authority (while Clerk of the Assembly) to Print all Laws and Acts for the future, which shall be pass'd by the Governour, Council and Assembly. Septemb. 7th, 1698. Read Three Times, and pass'd the Council Ne∣mine contradicente, and consented to by his Excellency. Read, and pass'd the Assembly Nemine contradicente, this Seventh Day of September, 1698. G. Payne, acting as Deputy Se∣cretary pro hac Vice. William Rawlin, Cl. Assemb.
No 1. An ACT or ORDER for the Compiling the Laws by Commissioners. WHereas by Virtue of an Act of this Island beating Date the Two and Twentieth Day of March, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Sixty and Six, It is Declared and Enacted, That all such Acts and Statutes as have been made at any time heretofore in time of Kingly Authority, and stand unrepealed, shall be of full Force and Virtue: And that also in the said Act it is Enacted, That we under-written should with all speed Collect and Compile together all the said Acts and Sta∣tutes, and that then they should be fairly entred and enrolled in the Se∣cretary's Office, and after published in the several Parish-Churches in this Island; as in and by the said Act expressly and more fully appear∣eth. Now we the Persons by the said Act appointed as aforesaid, do certify, That the several and particular Acts and Statutes foregoing and comprehended in One Hundred Fifty and Three Sheets of Paper,This Order in the Old Collected Laws was in∣serted at the end of them. are the only Laws and Statutes which we find either originally Made and Enact∣ed, or Revived, Collected, Amended and Confirm'd under the Govern∣ment of his now Majesty, or of his Royal Father, or Grandfather, of ever blessed Memories, and which we have Compiled to be Published ac∣cording to the said Act, as Laws of Publick Concern. And that all the Private Laws ought to be Enrolled, and ought to be of Force from their several Dates and Times (Two Acts only Excepted, wherein we the said Commissioners cannot determine which of them is Valid) both Im∣porting Customs on all the Commodities of this Island hence Exported, yet only one of them can be in force. The First of which Acts is intituled, An Act Importing the Customs, &c. Dated the Seventeenth of January, One Thousand, Six Hundred and Fifty; which was Made and Enacted by Governour, Council and the Representatives of this Island lawfully im∣powered by Commission from the Earl of Carlisle, thereto impower'd by Letters Patent from the King; and that Act we cannot say is Repealed, by reason that the other Act Dated the Twelfth Day of September, in the Year One Thousand, Six Hundred, Sixty and Three, Importing the Custom of Four and an Half per Cent. and intended to Repeal the for∣mer Act, is not free from Objections and Exceptions of several Persons, who conceive the Assembly which consented to that said last Act, was an Assembly not legally continued at the time of making the said Act. We have therefore thought fit to make this Return unto his Excellency, Council and the Representatives now assembled, to the end a Determina∣tion therein may be made, as to their Judgments shall seem meet. Dated the 18 of July, 1667. Constant Sylvester, John Jennings, Richard Evans, Edmond Bowden, Philip Bell, Robert Hooper, Simon Lambert.

No 14. An ACT for limitting the Assemblies Continuance. WHereas by sad experience we have found, That the long setting of Representatives hath been the occasion of many Factions and Divisions, and of great Distraction in the whole Nation and the People that chose them, though they be never so much unsatisfied or displeased with their Actions, cannot by reason of their unlimited Election, put a seasonable end to the power which they have given them.

Be it Ordained and Enacted by the Governour, Council and As∣sembly, and by Authority of the same; That this present Assembly,No Assembly to set but one Year. nor any future Assembly to be held within this Island, shall be and continue any longer, than for one whole Year from their time of first meeting, as an Assembly, fully to be compleat and ended.

And therefore if some more speedy course of Administration of Ju∣stice in such Cases be not established, the Persons injured are forced ra∣ther to lose their Rights, than suffer more by their demurrage here. For Remedy whereof for the future,
Be it Enacted by the President, Council and Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, that in all such Cases above recited, the Gover∣nour,Special Courts how to be con∣stituted. President or Commander in chief for the time being, may and shall upon the Petition of the Plaintiff, appoint and constitute a special Court, and by Commission appoint Five Judges, who, or any Three of them, shall be thereby impowered according to the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom of England and this Island, to hear, try, and finally de∣termine the same; and therein grant Execution accordingly, wherein no unnecessary Delays shall be cast or allowed.

WHereas much of the Interest and Substance of this Island, con∣sists in the Servants brought to, and disposed of in the same, and in their Labour during the Term they have to serve, wherein notwith∣standing Provision hath been made by many good Laws, yet great and often Damage hath happened to the People of this Place through the Un∣ruliness, Obstinacy and Refractoriness of the Servants. And whereas also it much concerns the Peace of this Island, that a continual strict course should be taken to prevent the bold Extravagan∣cies and wandring of Servants, who frequently run from, and desert their Master's Service, making use of all advantages and occasions to di∣sturb the publick Peace, and prejudice their Masters: Wherefore the President, Council and Assembly, upon serious and mature consideration of the Premises, and for the good regulating and governing of Servants in all things concerning their Masters and them∣selves, during the time they have to serve by Indenture or otherwise, and as well concerning such Servants Wages, have thought fit to Enact, Ordain and Publish; and it is Enacted, Ordained and Published by the President, Council and Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That no Person whatsoever shall presume to bring into this Island, any Chil∣dren of the English Nation, or the Dominions thereunto belonging,None to be brought here under Fourteen Years of Age. to be sold as Servants, under the Age of Fourteen Years, unless they can produce a good Certificate, or an Indenture or Writing from the Prin∣cipal Persons of the Parish, wherein the said Child last lived, that it is done with their consent, or with the consent, or at the request of the Parents of such Child; the Age of such Child or Servant to be judged by Inspection.

And whereas it hath been an ill Custom and Usage of divers Mer∣chants and other Persons coming to this Island, indirectly and by delusive
means and practices to obtain Men and Women on Board of Ships in England, so cause them to be Transported hither, and are here disposed of to serve according to the Custom of the Country, having no Indenture, Covenant or Contract for the same. It is therefore hereby further Enacted and Ordained by the Au∣thority aforesaid, That from, and after publication hereof, all Persons so indirectly sent,Against bring∣ing Servants against their Wills. or brought over, the Master of them, or Persons, to whom they are consigned, or who are concerned therein, having no Covenant, Indenture or Contract made in Writing, or other Verbal Agreement by him or them to be proved by the Oath of one or more Witnesses, or by the Servant's Confession, That such Servant came with his own Consent or Knowledge, That all such Persons so brought over, have hereby power, and are at liberty to implead the Persons who brought them, or to whom they are consigned, according to the Laws of England, for their Freedom, and to recover their Damages and Satisfaction for such wrongful and injurious dealing.

And whatso∣ever Servant shall hereafter come to this Island, and serve their Time therein by Indenture or otherwise,The last Master to pay the Wa∣ges. shall receive as aforesaid (the last Master always to pay the said Wages.) Against Tra∣ding with Ser∣vants.It is further Enacted, Ordained and Published by the Authority aforesaid, That no Freeman or Trader whatsoever, presume to buy or sell any Commodities whatsoever, with any Servant or Slave within this Island, without the consent of the Master or Owner of such Servant or Slave,Forfeiture. upon pain of forfeiting treble the value of the said Goods they trade for, to the Master or Owner of such Servant: And all Contracts and Covenants so made by such Servant or Slave, to be utterly void and of no effect: And such Trader or Freeman for every such his Offence, fur∣ther to forfeit Five Hundred Pounds of Sugar, the one half to the In∣former, the other half to the Treasurer for the publick use, the same to be recovered by Action in any Court of Record within this I∣sland.

And whereas many Women Servants are begotten with Child by Freemen or Servants, in great pre∣judice to their Masters or Mistresses whom they serve, It is therefore Ordained and Enacted by the President, Council and Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, that whosoever shall beget a Woman-Servant with Child, shall for such Offence,Of getting Wo∣men Servants with Child. personally serve the Owner of such Servant Three Years, or put one in his Place for the said time, which is in recompence for the said Master or Mistress of his and her Loss and Charge, in bringing up the Bastard Child, and Damage received by disabling their Woman Servant.

And for the better understanding therein, It is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by the Authority aforesaid, That the same Proof or Evidence that is sufficient to prove the reputed Father of a Bastard, by which he is obliged to discharge the Parish whose it shall be, or to keep the same, shall be as authentick to a Jury, to cause the Father of a Bastard to make reparation to the Master or Mi∣stress of such Woman-Servant upon whom the same is begotten; as is before appointed. But if a Servant shall beget a Woman-Servant with Child, then after his Time is expired, he shall serve the Owner of the said Woman Servant double the time she had to serve at the time of the Offence committed. Item, Be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority a∣foresaid, Of Servants Marrying du∣ring the time of their Ap∣prenticeship.

Two only out of a Family to be allowed at once. be allowed such reasonable time for the performance there∣of by their respective Masters, as to the next Justice of the Peace in that Precinct shall seem requisite and convenient for the same: But not to be allowed more than Two out of a Family, in behalf of themselves and the rest. And whatsoever Servant over and above the number of Two, shall upon the pretence of Complaint, absent themselves from their Master's Service, shall by Order of the next Justice of the Peace, receive Thirteen Lashes, and be returned to his Master's Service by a Constable, if the Justice before whom the Complaint is made, shall see cause. And whatsoever Servant or Servants shall wilfully and obstinately absent him or her self out of his or her Master or Mistresses Plantation or Service, either on Saturday, Sunday, or any other Days or Times, not having License or Ticket in Writing, under his Master, Mistress or O∣verseer's Hand for the same; Upon Conviction thereof, by the Oath of one or more Witnesses, or his own Confession, before some one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace within this Island, shall for every Two Hours Absence,Servants ab∣senting them∣selves, to serve a Day for eve∣ry Two Hours. be adjudged and ordered by the said Justice, to serve his said Master or Mistress one whole Day after his Time by In∣denture or Custom is expired. So that the same do not in the whole exceed Three Years; and so in proportion for a longer or lesser time, for such his Absence. It having been formerly a great Complaint, that many Masters, when their Servants grow Sick, and unable to perform their daily La∣bour, will seem to remit some part of the time, to be cleared of them; or turn them off,Against turn∣ing away Sick Servants. to the intent they may not be chargeable to them for their Recovery; Whereby many of the said Servants may most miserably perish, or become a Charge to the Parish where they first happen to be laid up. For Prevention whereof for the future, and duely pu∣nishing such inhumane Acts in such Persons as shall become guilty of the same, It is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by the President, Council and Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That what Master, Mistress or Governour of Servants,Masters, &c. to use all law∣ful means for recovery of Sick Servants. shall hereafter offend herein, or shall not use and endeavour all lawful Means for recovery of such their Ser∣vants, as shall happen to be Sick or Diseased, during the time of their Servitude, shall forfeit Two Thousand and Two Hundred Pounds of

And whereas it is much feared, That some Persons within this I∣sland, have exercised Violence and great Oppression, to, and upon their Servants; through which, some of them have been Murthered and De∣stroyed, and the Authors and Causers of such their Destruction, have
gone clear, undiscovered and unpunished, by reason of the sudden interring of Servants so destroyed and murthered as aforesaid.

And whereas the High-ways in open Ground are in many Places already by Fences reduced to a narrower scantling than by this Act is required, which now to widen, might be of great Damage to the Owners of the Land of each side of the said way: For Prevention whereof, Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if the Owners of the said Land, do within one Month after Publication here∣of,In old narrow Paths, Cause∣ways to be made by the Land Owners. make a firm, plain and sufficient Causeway or Gravel Path between the said Fences, (provided the same be broad enough for Two Carts to pass each against other) and also to enter into Bond for One Hundred Pounds Sterling, to the Surveyors of the said Parish for the time being, and their Successors, for the use of the said Parish, constantly to keep the same in good Repair;If not made, and to keep Hedges, to be pulled down. Then and in such case, the Surveyors of the High-ways, shall forbear to beat down the said Fences, or widen the said Way: Any thing in this Act seeming to the contrary notwith∣standing. Whereas it hath been taken into consideration, that if the Parishes nearest adjoining to the Sea-side, should at their own proper Costs and Charges, maintain their High-ways and Causeways, it might possibly become over-burthensome unto them, in regard their Ways be nearer the Center, and are more in number, and more used and worn; of which the Parishes farther off, have the Benefit and Conveniency; and therefore it seems most equitable,Adjoyning Pa∣rishes to con∣tribute to the mending of the High-ways. that they should in some mea∣sure contribute towards the Maintenance and Repair of them. For which purpose, Be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That upon all extraordinary Occasions of Charge in reparation as afore∣said, of the High-ways, Causeways, Gravel, Paths or Bridges in the
Parishes nearest the Sea, such reasonable Contribution shall be made out of the Parish Stock, by the Surveyors of those respective Parishes which have the benefit of such Reparations,General Ses¦sions to order the Quantum. as to the Justices of the Peace at the general Sessions upon hearing the whole Matter, shall be judged fit and reasonable. Item, If any Justice of the Peace shall refuse or neglect to perform that Duty, which by this Act is required of him;A Justice re∣fusing or neg∣lecting his Du∣ty, to be fined 10000 Pound of Sugar. Such Justice upon Conviction thereof by the Oath of Two Witnesses, or his own Con∣fession before the Commander in chief for the time being, and any Two more of the Council, shall be adjudged to forfeit the Quantity of Ten Thousand Pounds of Muscovadoe Sugar, and to stand committed, until he have paid the same into the Hands of the Surveyors of the said Parish where the said Default was made, to be disposed of for the use of the High-ways as aforesaid. And lastly, Be it Enacted and Ordained by the Authority afore∣said, That all Acts, Laws and Statutes formerly Made,All former Acts and Statutes are void, that are made to this purpose. Enacted and Or∣dained, for, and concerning any broad Paths or High-ways within this Island, and provided for in this Act or any Clause thereof, be and are hereby declared to be void and null, to all intents and purposes whatso∣ever: Any Law, Usage or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding.

WHereas it hath been taken into consideration, the extream Po∣verty of several Poor Persons within this Island, and their Ina∣bility to satisfy their several Creditors, and by reason thereof, suffer long and tedious Imprisonment, without any hope of Relief therein. It is therefore hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Governour, Council and Assembly, That all such Persons who are in Prison, and all others that have no other way to satisfy their several Creditors and Judgment for the same obtained against him, shall, if they will there∣unto submit, be ordered and appointed by the Judge and Assistants of

And whereas since some Scruples have arisen whether an Estate for Life or Inheritance may be construed from the same for want of these Words (their Heirs) To the intent the same may be more fully ex∣plained, and all Disputes of that kind for the future abolished, Be it therefore Enacted and Declared by the Governour, Council and Assembly, that by these Words (as their Free Estates) was meant, the whole Estate and Inheritance of the respective Plantations within this Island. So that by such Possession in manner as by the said Act is ex∣pressed, the said Inhabitants are hereby adjudged and declared to have and hold their Lands of Right to them, to dispose of or alienate, or o∣therwise to descend or be confirmed to their Heirs for ever.
No 47. An ACT for Settling the several Markets in the several Towns of this Island. Repealed by Act 98. No 48. An ACT for the Encouragement of such as shall plant or raise Provisions to sell. WHereas divers the Inhabitants of this Island have been discouraged from planting and raising Provisions to sell, in regard of the tedious Payments, are many times made, and the great trouble of Pro∣secution of the same at Common Law. For Prevention whereof for the future, Be it Enacted and Ordained by the President, Council and Assem∣bly,One possessed of 20 Acres or under, for Pro∣visions sold, may recover before a Ju∣stice. and by the Authority of the same, That all Planters Possest but of Twenty Acres of Land, or under, that shall after Publication hereof, sell any sort of Provisions of the growth or produce of this Island, shall, and have hereby power to prosecute any Person for any Debt accrew∣ing by such Sale, before any Justice of the Peace within the Parish or Precinct, and recover the same in such manner and form, as Servants and Labourers are impowered to recover their Wages by virtue of an Act in that Case made and provided.

The Reason of this Act ceases. Repealed.
No 50. An ACT concerning the Sale of Lands by Attorneys, Execu∣tors and Administrators. WHereas it hath been a long received Custom in this Island, for Attorneys, Executors and Administrations to make Sale of Land of their Principals, Testators and Intestates. And forasmuch as it e∣vidently appears unto all Men, that the greatest part of the possessors of Land in this Island, sold no Land by no other Title, although they have given very valuable considerations for the same. The Governour and the Assembly having taken the Premises into their consideration, and well weighing the mischievous consequence which must necessarily follow, if the validity of such Sale should be questioned, Do hereby Enact, Declare and Publish, That all Sales already made unto this Day by any of the Persons before recited, to the behoof of any Principals, Testators or Intestates, shall be as firm and valid un∣to the Purchasers, their Heirs and Assigns, as if they had been made by the Principals themselves, or by the Testators or Intestates them∣selves.

WHereas the present Governour, Council and Assembly, have signified by a late Declaration bearing date the Seventh Day of March instant, that the Government of this Place shall be according to the Laws of England, and of this Island, as hath been heretofore used and practised. And for that nothing more conduceth to the good and quiet of any Place and People, than the assuring and ascertaining such Laws and Statutes as they are to be governed and regulated by. And to take off all pretence of Ignorance of the same for the future, It is therefore Ordained and Enacted by the Governour, Coun∣cil and Representatives of the Inhabitants of this Island now Assembled,What Laws of this Island are ascertained. That all such Acts and Statutes as have been made and published in this Island, or viewed, corrected and confirmed by any Governour and Council, or President and Council, by Virtue of any Commission from King James, or Charles the First, his now Majesty's Royal Grand∣father, and Father of ever blessed Memory, or by virtue of any Com∣mission from his most Gracious Majesty that now is, either immediately from either of their said Majesties, or mediately from them, or either of them, by, from, or under the late Earl, or any former Earl of Car∣lisle, by, or with the Assent or Consent of the Representatives of this Place legally called and continued, which stands unrepealed by any Power and Authorities aforesaid, be hereby Enacted and Declared to be in full force and virtue in this Island; and that all Laws, Acts and Statutes made or published in this Island, by any other Power or Autho∣rity, than as before expressed, are utterly void and of none effect: Any Declaration, Order or Ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding.

Obsolete. The Preceeding Collection of Laws were by an Act of this Island Ordained and Established to be in full and absolute Force and Ver∣tue, and were duly published in all the Parishes of this Island, and returned to the Clerk of the Assembly, as more fully appears by an Attestation under their several Hands: The Original whereof is affixed to the Assembly Book of Acts: And also the aforesaid Acts were sent to England for his Majesty's Approbation, and have been fully approved and confirmed by his Sacred Majesty to be of full force and authority in this Island. The Return of the Commissioners is contained in the Words fol∣lowing, Viz.

FOrasmuch as it hath been in the power of the Governour of this Island, from the Settlement thereof, to appoint meet Persons of known Abilities, for the execution of the Provost Marshal's Office; for which of late by some Surreptitious Practices, Patents have been obtain∣ed and procured from his Majesty, by Persons very unfit for a Place of such Trust, to the great prejudice of the Inhabitants. For Remedy therefore of these Inconveniencies for the future, and that the said Office may be supplied with Persons able and fit for the discharge of the said Place, We the Representatives of this Island of Barbados, do humbly pray your Excellency, that it may be Ordained and Enacted. And it is hereby Ordained and Enacted by his Excellency, Council and Assembly,That the Go∣vernour shall have power to appoint the Provost Mar∣shal. and by the Authority of the same, That it shall hence-forward be in the Governour's power from time to time, as occasion shall offer, to constitute and appoint any sufficient Person or Persons whom he shall judge meet, to be Provost Marshal of this Island, taking good Security, as hath been heretofore accustomed, for the just and ho∣nest Discharge of his Place.

No 69. An ACT directing how the Clerks and Marshals for the several Courts of Common-Pleas within this Island shall be appointed, and what they shall receive. WHereas it hath been an antient Usage even from the First Esta∣blishment of the Courts of Judicature in this Island, that the seve∣ral chief Judges in their Courts of Common-Pleas, have always from time to time, as occasion hath afforded, made choice of, and appointed Clerks and Marshals to attend the said Courts, and the former issuing forth all Precepts, and entring upon Record all such Matters, as have concern∣ed the said Courts: And the other executing all Warrants, Writs, Exe∣cutions and other Precepts issuing from thence. And whereas upon just Complaint made against the said Clerks and Marshals for their Neglect or other Miscarriage, the said Judges have had power to Discharge them, and place others in their stead, who should be more careful and diligent in the execution of their Offices. And whereas the Judges of this Island have no Sallary or Allowance from His Majesty, for the great Care and Pains they must necessarily un∣dergo in the discharge of the Trust reposed in them, We the Represen∣tatives of this Island, do humbly pray your Excellency, that it may be Ordained and Enacted, And it is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by his Excellency, William Lord Willoughby of Parham, Captain General and Governour in Chief of this Island of Barbados, and all other the Charibbee-Islands, and by, and with the Consent of his Council, and Gentlemen of the Assembly, That from, and after the Publication hereof, each Person who is,Judges to ap∣point their own Clerks and Marshals. or shall be appointed Chief Judge of any Court of Common-Pleas within this Island, shall have free Liberty from time to time, to make Choice of, Constitute and Appoint, any sufficient Person or Persons, whom he shall judge meet, to be and officiate as Clerk and Marshal of the said Court, where∣of he is or shall be appointed Judge.

And whereas the said Commissions are since granted by his said Ex∣cellency, under the Broad and Publick Seal appointed by his Majesty for this and the rest of these Islands. It is hereby Ordained and Enacted by his said Excellency, his Council and Assembly,For confirming the Judges pro∣ceedings under a private Seal. That all Proceedings hitherto acted and done by the said several Judges and Assistants, by Virtue of their said Com∣missions, under the aforesaid Private Seal, shall be, and are hereby held and esteemed as valid and effectual in Law, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever; as if the said Publick Seal had been affixed unto the said Commissions.

No 83. An ACT for Relief of such Poor Persons as have much suf∣fered by the late afflicting Hand of God. Obsolete. No 84. An ACT to prevent Forceable and Clandestine Entries into any Lands or Tenements within this Island. FOrasmuch as great care hath been had for divers Years past, for the quieting, setling and ascertaining all Mens Rights and Posses∣sions in, and to their Lands and Tenements within this Island; so as that the difficulty and determining Mens Interests through the defects of for∣mer Grants, or the weakness of Men in the infancy of Settlements, as to Deeds and due Forms of Law, hath been of late Years reasonably well evinced and cleared, and the limitation of time, as to Mens Rights and Estates, Claims and Properties hath been successively enlarged and con∣tinued beyond expectation: Whereby all Capacities and Conditions of Persons might arrive to a Challenge of any their Estates. And that it is high time now the Possessors of Lands should in some measure be free from the daily vexation of unwarranted Claims, Entries and secret Possessions gained by Litigious, Troublesome and Unconcerned Persons, who notwithstanding the Courts of Common-Pleas, are open, and do hold Monthly for the determining Mens Rights; Yet do daily vex and di∣sturb the Inhabitants of this Island in their Possessions and Estates, by pri∣vately setting up petty Roofs, or Thatcht Houses, sometimes in the Night, sometimes in the Day, in the remote Bounds or Parts of their Plantations and Lands, and by sudden and secret Entries into Lands and Tenements, or by private ways of gaining Possession upon very frivolous Suggestions, do pretend Right and Property. And by such Means, with other subtil Tricks and Pretentions, meeting many times with the advantage of ig∣norant Persons concurrent with their Devices, do daily trouble and put to charge the Owners and rightful Possessors, and indanger their just In∣terests; when in truth the Party so indirectly gaining Possession or En∣tring, hath no just cause for his so doing. And also whereas it often falls out, that upon due Trial at the Common Law, it was found that such Entry was altogether Unlawful; whereupon Judgment is given, that the Plaintiff shall recover his Possession with Costs and Damages against the Defendant, whose Condition is for the most part so desperate, that he is not able to perform the Sentence of the Law; whereby the Plaintiff after a tedious Suit, and his Estate wasted, is left remidiless to his intollerable Grief and Damage. For Prevention of which great evils for the future, It is Ordained and Enacted, by the Deputy, Governour, the Council and Assembly of Representatives of this Island of Barbados, and by authority of the same,No forceable Entries. That henceforward no Person or Persons what∣soever, presume to make any forceable Entries, or forceable Detainers into, or of any Lands, Houses or Tenements within this Island, or pre∣sume to enter secretly into any Mans Lands,Not to erect Huts, Hovels, Thatcht Houses to gain posses∣sion. Houses or Tenements for gaining of Possession, by setting up any Roofs, Hutts, Hovels, Tents or Thatcht Houses, or by any such private or secret Practices, or other
ways or means whatsoever, without due Course, Trial and Recovery at Law first had and obtained,Forfeiture. under Penalty of forfeiting Ten Thousand Pounds of Sugar for every Person so offending, to the King's Majesty. And whensoever any Person or Persons shall make any such Entry and Detainer, or by any such secret Means or Ways as aforesaid, enter into, or gain Possession of any Mans Lands, Houses or Tenements, upon any Pretence whatsoever, contrary to this Act, without Trial and Recovery at Law, first had and obtained, to bring into Question and Trial the Right and Property thereof.Two Justices or one of them to remove Pos∣sessions. The Two next Justices of the Peace are hereby required and authorized, upon complaint of the Party grieved, to remove such Entries and Possessions, and all such Houses, Roofs, Huts and Thatcht-Houses, for that end so put and erected, shall cause to be pulled down and destroyed, as if the same had never been. And the Person or Persons so entred, possessed or holding, or found doing contrary here∣unto, shall be committed to the common Goal of this Island, there to re∣main, until they have given Recognizance themselves,Offenders for∣feit. in Ten Thousand Pounds of Sugar, and Two Securities, in Five Thousand Pounds of Su∣gar a piece,Bound to the Peace and Ge∣neral Sessions. for his appearance at the next General Sessions to be held for this Island to answer the same, and in the interim to keep the Peace. At which said Sessions, the matter shall be fully examined, and the said Pe∣nalty there adjudged, and accordingly paid into the Publick Treasury of this Island. And in case of resistance by strong Hand or Force against the said Justice or Justices executing herein, by any Party possessed or en∣tred as aforesaid, and contrary to this Act;Posse Comita∣tus. The said Justice or Justices are hereby authorized and required, to raise the Power of the Country, and proceed against all the Offenders as Rioters or Rebels. And the Justice of the Peace who shall herein fail of executing as is hereby re∣quired, shall forfeit Ten Thousand Pounds of Sugar,Forfeiture. the same to be re∣covered in any the Courts of Common Pleas within this Island, by him that shall inform thereof, and sue for the same; the one half to the publick Treasury for the use of the Island, and the other half to the In∣former. Provided nevertheless, that this Act,Exceptions. nor any thing therein con∣tained, shall not extend, or be construed to reach or extend to any entry made upon Breach of Covenants, Conditions, or any Arrearages of Rent, or any such like case, where the Right, Title or Property is not hereby enforced to, and intended for a Trial, or brought into question, or to the formal Entry made for the ensealing Leases of Ejectment, or Li∣very of Possessions made thereupon, if the Owner or Tenant thereby shall not be dispossessed. Given under my Hand the 19th Day of March, 1667. Signed, William Willoughby.
No 85. An ACT for the Speedy Recovering the Arrears of several Le∣vies hereafter mentioned. Obsolete. No 86. An ACT for the present stay of Building in St. Michael's Town, until further consideration. Repealed by Act 107. No 87.

An ACT appointing the last Levy for the Labourers in the Windward (Regiment, alias) Division, be changed into Goods. Obsolete. No 91. An ACT reducing the Interest to Ten Pounds for One Hun∣dred in One Year. WHereas at this time, there is a very great abatement in the Va∣lue of Land, Sugar, Cotton, Ginger, and all other Wares and Commodities of the growth of this Island, both here, and also in Eng∣land, and other Foreign Parts whither they are Transported: And whereas divers Inhabitants of this Place, as well Planters, as Merchants, Farmers of Plantations and Tradesmen, both for their urgent and neces∣sary Occasions for the following their Trades, and maintenance of their Stocks and Imployments, have borrowed, and do borrow, divers Sums of Money, Sugar, Wares, Merchandizes, and other Commodities. But by reason of the said general fall and abatement of the Value of Lands, and the Prices of Sugar, and other Merchandize, Wares and Commo∣dities
aforesaid, and Interest in Loan, continuing at so high a Rate as Fif∣teen Pounds in the Hundred, for one Year, doth not only make Men unable to pay their Debts, and continue the Maintenance of Trade; but their Debts daily increasing, they are inforced to sell their Lands and Stock, at very low Rates, to forsake the use of Merchandize and Trade, and to give over their Leases and Farms, and so become unprofitable Mem∣bers of the Commonwealth, to the great hurt and hinderance of the same. Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted and it is hereby Ordained and Enacted, by the Deputy Governour, Council and Assembly, and by Authority of the same; that no Person or Persons whatsoever, from, and after the Nine and Twentieth Day of September next, upon any Con∣tract to be made after the said Nine and Twentieth Day of September, shall take indirectly, or indirectly, for Loan of any Monies, Sugars or o∣ther Wares, Merchandizes or Commodities whatsoever, above the Value of Ten Pounds,10 l. per Cent. Interest. for the forbearance of One Hundred Pounds for a Year, and so after that Rate for a greater or lesser Sum, or for a longer or shorter time. And that all Bonds Contracts, and Assurances what∣soever made after the time aforesaid, for Payment of any Principal or Mony to be Lent, or Covenanted to be performed, upon, or for any Usury, whereupon,Contracts for above 10 per Cent. void. or whereby there shall be reserved or taken above the Rate of Ten in the Hundred as aforesaid, shall be utterly void. And that all and every Person and Persons whatsoever, which shall after the time aforesaid, upon any Contract to be made after the said Nine and Twentieth Day of September, take, accept and receive, by way, or means of any corrupt Bargain, Loan, Exchange, Cheivesance, Shift, or Interest of any Wares, Merchandizes, or other thing or things whatso∣ever, or by any deceitful way or means, or by any Covin Engine, or deceitful Conveyance for the forbearing, or giving Day of Payment for One whole Year, of, and for their Moneys or other things, above the Sum of Ten Pounds, for the forbearance of one Hundred Pounds for a Year, and so after that Rate for a lesser or greater Sum, or for a longer or shorter time, shall forfeit and lose for every such Offence,Forfeiture. treble the Value of the Monies, Sugars, Wares, Merchandizes and other things, so Lent, Bargained, Exchanged or Shifted. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all, and every Scrivener and Scriveners, Broker and Brokers, Sollicitor and Solli∣citors, Driver and Drivers of Bargains or Contracts, who shall after the said Nine and Twentieth Day of September take or receive, directly or indirectly, any Sum or Sums of Mony, or other reward or things for Brokage, Solliciting, driving or procuring the Loan, or forbearing of any Sum or Sums of Mony,Procurage 5 s. per Cent. over or above the Rate or Value of Five Shillings, for the Loan, or forbearing of One Hundred Pounds Sterling for a Year, and so ratably: Or above Twelve Pence for ma∣king or receiving of the Bond or Bill for the Loan or Forbearance there∣of, or for any Counterbond or Bill concerning the same,1 s. for the Bond. shall forfeit for every such Offence, Two Thousand Pounds of Muscovadoe Sugar,Forfeiture. and have Imprisonment for half a Year; the one Moyety of which For∣feitures to be to the King our Sovereign Lord, his Heirs and Successors, and the other Moyety to him or them, that will sue for the same, in the same Precincts where the several Offences are committed, and not else∣where, by Action of Debt, Bill, Plaint or Information, in which no Es∣soign, Wager of Law or Protection to be allowed.
And to the end there may be no shifting Evasions in abuse to the true intent and meaning of this Act, as there hath been of the former Act of this Island, by changing the Species of the Debt, sometimes from Money into Sugar and other Commodities, and again at other times from Sugar and other Commodities into Money: Wherein the Lender or Cre∣ditor working on the necessity of the Debtor or Borrower, hath set so low a Value on Sugar, when he converteth his Money into Sugar, and on the contrary so high a Value on it, when his Sugar-Debt or Sugar were to be converted into Money: That by such shifting the Original Sum lent, hath generally in Two or Three Years at most been doubled, to the great oppression of the Inhabitants of this Island, and the scandal of Justice, that have not adjudged such shifting and indirect Courses to be contrary to the former Act. It is hereby Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That there shall be no Change or Alteration of Money or Wares lent or continued in the Hands of any Borrower;No changing Money into Goods, or Goods into Mo∣ney. but that whatsoever is lent or continued, shall still remain unchanged from the Species it was first lent in, and that no Commodities be as aforesaid changed or shifted into Mo∣ney, nor Money into Commodities. And forasmuch as in the understanding of one Clause of the Act, establishing the Courts of Common Pleas within this Island, the Judges of the respective Courts, have differed in Opinion and Practice; where∣by some Inconveniences have happened as well to the Merchant and Trader, as Inhabitants of this Island: By reason that on Recoveries in this Island of Debt payable in England, and there not duly satisfied, some Judges have ordered the satisfying thereof by Appraisement, some by Sale or Outcry; when as indeed neither of those Courses are directed by the said Act, but done at the discretion of the Judges. To the end there may be no failure of Justice, and that every Recovery should be satisfied, for prevention of which different proceedings, and for the esta∣blishing a just and equal way for the satisfying such Debts and Recove∣ries, It is hereby Enacted and Ordained, and the respective Judges of this Island,This last Clause is Repealed by an after Act. N. 117. are hereby required upon all such Recoveries now or here∣after to be made by reason of any Contract preceeding the Publication of this Act, be satisfied and paid by Attachment and Appraisement, and that no Sale by Outcry in such case be allowed. And whatever Re∣coveries shall hereafter be obtained in any of the Courts of this Island, of Money that were payable in England, and became due by reason of any Contract made after the Publication of this Act, such Money-Debts shall be here satisfied by Muscovadoe Sugar, at Two Pence the Pound, or whatever else shall be Attached, where no Muscovadoe Sugar can be found, shall be Appraised into Muscovadoe Sugar; and if the Recovery be on Bills of Exchange, Twenty per Cent. to be added, as by the for∣mer Law of this Island is appointed.

No 92. An ACT for preventing the Selling of Brandy and Rum in Tipling-Houses near the Broad Paths and High-ways within this Island. FOrasmuch as intolerable Hurts and Troubles to this Island, do con∣tinually grow and increase through the Multiplicity of such Abuses and Disorders as are daily had and used in Unlicens'd Tipling-Houses, commonly called Brandy, or Rum-Houses, which are for the most part situated and erected near to Broad-paths or High-ways; Whereby the Keepers of such Houses take advantage to Trade and Deal with Ser∣vants and Negroes for Stolen Goods contrary to Law, and to the great Oppression and Damage of Honest and Industrious People. And whereas on Sabbath Days, many Lewd, Loose and Idle People, do usually resort to such Tipling Houses, who by their Drunkenness, Swearing and other Miscarriages, do in a very high nature, blaspheme the Name of God, prophane the Sabbath, and bring a great Scandal upon true Christian Religion. For Prevention whereof for the future, Be it Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Governour, Council and Assembly, and by Authority of the same;None to sell Wine near High-ways. Not to be li∣censed. and it is hereby Ordained and Enacted, that no Person or Persons whatsoever, be permitted or li∣censed to sell Wine, Brandy or Rum, or any other strong Liquors in such Tipling-Houses as aforesaid, from and after the First Day of June next ensuing the Date hereof, upon any pretence whatsoever. And in case any Person shall contrary to this Act, obstinately pre∣sume to sell such Liquors in such Tipling-Houses as aforesaid, Then the Person or Persons so convicted, by the Oath of Two or more credible Wit∣nesses, or by the Parties own Confession, shall for such their first Offence,Forfeits 500 l. Sugar, First Offence. forfeit and pay the Sum of Five Hundred Pounds of Sugar, the same to be levied by distress, as in case of Servants Wages, by Warrant from any Justice of the Peace of that Parish, where such Offence shall be com∣mitted. The same Forfeitures to be converted to, and reserved for the use and maintenance of the Poor of that respective Parish. And in case any Person shall offend the Second time in the same nature,Second and af∣ter Offence, the Goal. That then the Person or Persons so offending, for such his Second Offence, be com∣mitted to the common Goal of this Island, there to remain without Bail or Mainprize, for the space of Three Months; and so for every such Offence so committed after his or their first Conviction, any Law, Usage or Custom heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided always, and it is the true intent and meaning of this Act, that no Persons dwelling in any the Sea-Port Towns or Bays within this Island, and have Licence for the selling Wine,Not to extend to Sea-port Towns. Beer and other Strong Li∣quors, shall be by this Act debarred to sell the same;Except Wind∣ward of Oist∣nis, and Le∣ward of Six-Mens-Bay. Except such as live Windward of Oistnis, and to Leeward of Six-Mens-Bay. Neither shall be construed to extend to the Prohibition of such Per∣son or Persons as are appointed to give Entertainment in their Houses at the Quarter Sessions, or other Court or Courts of Judicature within the Body of this Island. And forasmuch as it hath been the too long Covetous Practices of many Persons to buy decay'd Wines, &c. with intent and purpose to vent the same at great Rates amongst the poor People, who live far up in the
Country: By which means the poorer sort of Planters and Labourers contract many needless Debts, to the great Ruin of themselves and Fa∣milies; and which tends very much to the depopulation of this place, if not timely prevented. Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted by the Authority afore∣said,None to sell Wines, &c. but what shall be the produce of their own Planta∣tions. That no Person or Persons, except such as are before in this Act ex∣cepted, do after the first Day of June next ensuing the Publication here∣of, take upon him or them to sell any Wines, Brandy or other Liquors, not being the produce of their own Plantations, und enalty of losing all such Debts so contracted and made. And be it Enacted and Ordained by the Ahority aforesaid, That all Accounts,All Articles in Accounts for Strong Liquors void. Articles of Accounts, Bills, Bon or other Contracts so to be made, or given after the First Day of June next, for the Sale of such Strong Liquors retailed up in the Country as aforesaid, shall be deemed, and are hereby declared to be void, null and of no effect; any Law, U∣sage or Custom heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding. And be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority afore∣said, That no Person or Persons within this Island, from and after the Publication hereof, shall be permitted to keep any Still or Stills for di∣stilling of Rum:None to keep a Still but Planters or Re∣finers. Except such Person or Persons have Land and Canes of their own, or such as keep Refining Houses. And if any other Person or Persons shall obstinately persist so to do, that then he or they shall abide, and undergo the Censure of the next Quarter-Sessions, so often as he or they offend in that kind. Given under my Hand the 29th of April, 1668. Signed, William Willoughby. No 93. An ACT to prevent the Abuse of Lawyers, and Multiplicity of Law Suits. Repealed by Act 142. No 94. An ACT declaring the Negro Slaves of this Island to be Real Estate. WHereas a very considerable part of the Wealth of this Island consists in our Negro Slaves, without whose Labour and Service we should be utterly unable to manage our Plantations here, thereby relieving our own Wants, and bringing that considerable increase of Re∣venue, which this Place affords unto his Majesty's Coffers, as well here as in England. And whereas Some Law Suits have arisen, and other great Incon∣veniences have followed, where divers Persons dying Intestate, have left their Right and Interest of their Negro Slaves to be by Law disputed between their Heirs, Executors and Administrators, wherein the various Judgments or Affections of several Courts or Jurors, have sometimes found for the one, and at other times, for the other.
For a full Remedy of these Inconveniences, and to the intent that the Heir and Widow, who claims Dower, may not have bare Land without Negroes to Manure the same, And also that the Condition, Right and Interest of Negroes, to all other ends and purposes whatsoe∣ver may be fully known and determined, The Deputy Governour, Council and Assembly of Representa∣tives, being willing that all Doubts, and Ambiguities herein should be removed, and the Law in this case declared and put in a certainty, have Ordained and Enacted, And it is hereby Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Governour, Council and Assembly, and by Authority of the same, that from, and after Publication hereof, all Negro Slaves in all Courts of Judicature and other Places within this Island, shall be held, taken and adjudged to be Estate real, and not Chattels,Negroes made real Estate. and shall de∣scend unto the Heirs and Widow of any Person dying Intestate, ac∣cording to the Manner and Customs of Lands of Inheritance held in Fee-Simple. Provided always, that no Person selling or alienating any of his or her Negroes,No need to Inroll. is hereby held or obliged to cause such Sale or Alie∣nation to be inrolled, as is accustomed to be done and required by the Law of this Island, in the alienation of other real Estates: Any usage Law or Custom to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided that this Act, nor any thing therein contained,Not to extend to Merchants Factors, &c. Importing. shall be taken and deemed to extend unto any Merchant, Factor or Agent, bring∣ing Negro Slaves to this Island, or having the consignment of any Slaves unto them. But in all respects, they, their Executors Administrators or Assigns, may hold, possess and enjoy such Slave or Negroe in such Con∣dition, as they might have done before the making of this Act, until such Sale of such Slave or Slaves hath been made in this Island. Given under my Hand the 29th of April, 1668. Signed, William Willoughby. No 95.

WHereas by an Act of this Island bearing Date the 9th Day of August, 1661, particular Market-Days were appointed and or∣dered to be kept and held in the Sea-port Towns in this Island, and all Sales thereby restrained to observance of those Days, and all manner of Con∣tracts thereby, though never so unduly made, seemingly confirmed and warranted. So that many Evils may ensue to the Inhabitants of this Island, by the Indirect Practices of many loose and wicked Per∣sons. Be it therefore Enacted and Ordained by the Deputy-Governour, Council and Assembly, and by Authority of the same, That the said Act of the Ninth Day of August, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Sixty and One, whereby the said Set Market-Days are appointed, be, and is hereby Re∣pealed, and made void to all intents and purposes whatsoever; excepting only, and notwithstanding provided, that the selling of Goods attached by the Marshal of the respective Courts, upon Execution for Debt, shall be observed and kept upon the said Days and Times, as by the said Act is appointed and is directed to be observed, in the Act establishing the Courts of Common Pleas of this Island.

WHereas several the Inhabitants of this Island have made many and grievous Complaints of the unjust Oppressions and Exactions of several Persons, under colour of their several Offices hereafter in this Act particularly express'd; By reason whereof, many of them the In∣habitants aforesaid, either not being able or willing to comply with such exorbitant and illegal Demands, have been necssitated to lose their just Rights, or to suffer great Prejudice in their Affairs and Concernments through the delay or want of such just Advantages and Securities as a due and right Performance of such Officers in their respective Offices might and ought to afford them.

An ACT for the Continuation of the Excise on all Strong Li∣quors imported this Island for One Year. Expired. No 114. An ACT prohibiting Wandering Persons from carrying of Goods and Wares in Packs or otherwise, from House to House in this Island. FOrasmuch as the extravagant Wandering of several Persons with their Packs of Wares in and about this Island from House to House, there to make Sale of the same, hath been found to be very prejudicial to the Inhabitants thereof, not only for that such Toleration is contrary to the wholesome Laws of England, which strictly prohibit all such Ped∣lers as Vagabonds, But for that it doth also occasion and create ma∣ny great Mischiefs to this Place, by reason of the continual under-hand dealing of such Persons every where with Servants and Negroes; Where∣by they drive on most part of their Trade by trucking for Stolen Goods, to no small Damage of honest and industrious Planters, who may from time to time Supply himself with all sorts of Commodities at cheaper Rates from the Merchant, at the several Towns and Store-houses with∣in this Island. Be it therefore Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Gover∣nour, Council and Assembly, and Authority of the same, that all such Persons,Stone to carry Packs from House to House, Forfeits such Wares. as shall presume so to Travel, Wander, or go from House to House in this Island with such Packs or Wares to sell, to any Inhabi∣tants, Servants or Slaves whatsoever, shall forfeit his or their Wares and Commodities whatsoever, so carried as aforesaid.

That then it shall and may be Lawful for such Justice of the Peace, to divide all and every the said Goods and Wares so carried as aforesaid, according to the best of his Judgment, and the one half to give and deliver to such Person or Persons,Half to the Informer, half to the Poor. that shall ap∣prehend such Person or Persons, so offending as aforesaid, and the other half forthwith to deliver over to the Overseers of the poor of that Pa∣rish, where the Person or Persons so offending, shall be Apprehended, Seized or Taken, the same to be to the use of the Poor of the said
Parish, who is to give an exact Account thereof to the Vestry of each such Parish.

WHereas by an Act of this Island bearing Date the 29th of April, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Sixty Eight, Intituled, An Act for Reduceing the Interest to Ten, for One Hundred in One Year, It is in a latter Clause in the said Act, Declared and Enacted, that whatsoe∣ver Recoveries shall hereafter be obtained in any the Courts of this Island, of Moneys that were Payable in England, and became due by reason of any Contract made after the Publication of the said Act; such Money-Debts should be here satisfied by Muscovadoe Sugar, at Two Pence per Pound; or whatever else should be Attached where no Muscovadoe Su∣gar could be found, should be Appraised into Muscovadoe Sugar; and if the Recovery be on Bills of Exchange, Twenty per Cent. to be added. And whereas it is found by experience, That the Consequence there∣of tends to the impairing of the Credit and Trade of this Island; Be it therefore Enacted by the Deputy-Governour, Council and Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That the said last Clause in the said Act, Intituled, An Act for the Reducing the Interest to Ten, for One Hun∣dred in One Year, and every thing therein contained, as is here before reci∣ted, shall be, and is hereby from henceforth Repealed, Annulled and made void, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That from henceforth, upon the Protest of a Bill or Bills of Exchange here produced sor ued for, Ten per Cent. and no more, shall be taken or allowed; and so in proportion for a greater or lesser Sum, for the Damage and Interest, for the Value of the Bill so Protested as aforesaid.

No 122. An Additional ACT concerning the Conveyance of Estates. WHereas by an Act of this Island made the Eleventh Day of Sep∣tember, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Forty and Nine, Intituled An Act concerning the Conveyance of Estates; the Preamble whereof run in these following Words. For that the King's Writs do not run here, whereby Fines and Reco∣veries cannot be here had and levied as in England, and yet here is as much and more use and need of them:Recital of a former Act. For that few Men come to this Island with intention to settle themselves and Posterities: But for the most part to gain and increase their Estates, and then to sell their Lands and Return, which oftentimes cannot well be done, nor with Se∣curity to the Purchaser, for want of such Fines and Recoveries without some Act be made to supply the same, &c. It was Enacted, That a Deed in due form of Law made and within Three Months of the Date thereof, acknowledged before the Resident Governour for the time being, or before some one of the chief Judges of one of the Courts of Justice within this Island, by all the Parties that grant or pass away any Lease for above the Term of Three Years, or any Free-hold or Inheritance by such Deed, or by so many of them as shall be living, of by any o∣ther Person or Persons lawfully authorized under Hand and Seal, to con∣vey and grant the same; (So the same be recorded at length in the Se∣cretary's Office of this Island, within the said Three Months) shall be va∣lid, to pass the same without Livery, Attornment, or any other Act or Ceremony whatsoever. And that no Deed hereafter without such Ac∣knowledgment and Inrollment shall pass any Estate of Freehold or Inhe∣ritance, or any Lease above the number of Three Years. Which before recited Clause, as well Negative as Affirmative, was on the Seventh of October, One Thousand, Six Hundred, Fifty and Two, Repealed and Supplied by one Act, containing as followeth. That no Deed shall be sufficient in Law to barr a real Purchaser, to pass any Estate of Land,Deeds to be acknowledged before the Go∣vernour, or one of the Judges. unless the same be acknowledged before the Governour, or One of the chief Judges of One of the Courts within this Island, and inrolled at length in the Secretary's Office, within Three Months of the Date and Delivery thereof. And in case the Grantor shall refuse, or doth not on Summons, appear to acknowledge the same, Then upon Proof made by any of the Witnesses, before such Gover∣nour or Judge, that the said Deed was duely sealed and delivered with∣in the said time, shall be sufficient for Recording the same. Which said Act made in Anno One Thousand, Six Hundred, Fifty and Two, not being made under Kingly Authority, became void immediately on his Ma∣jesty's happy Restoration; And thereby the former revived, yet so un∣observed not only by the general Body of the Inhabitants of this Place, but even by the Ministers and Courts of Justice, that the apprehension, use and practice setled by the said Act, in One Thousand, Six Hundred, Fifty and Two, hath continued even to this present Day.

FOrasmuch as several of the most eminent Plantations in most Pa∣rishes of this Island do little or no Parochial Duties, by reason the respective Owners of such Plantations have removed themselves to England or elsewhere, and in their Place and stead have left their par∣ticular Attorneys, Agents and Overseers, to manage their Estates for them in their Absence, Whereby the Country hath not only a far less Choice of able Men to officiate in the highest Places of Trust, But the burthen likewise of inferiour Officers doth thereby lye more heavy upon the Poorer sort of People.

But for that it is not therein ascertained and appointed in what manner, or how such Claims are to be made to Lands and Tenements, So that the Judges of the Courts of Common Pleas are left to their own Judgments and Opinions, what is, or may be a Claim in such Cases. Whereby great Hurts may redound to the In∣habitants, Possessors of Lands and Tenements, in case the Judges of the several Courts of Law should differ or vary in Judgment, in the manner of Claim, or allow of any other Claim, than is hereafter mentioned and declared.
And to the intent that the same may be ascertained, and the Posses∣sours of Lands and Tenements assured how and in what manner Per∣sons having or laying Claim to any Lands or Tenements in their Pos∣sessions; And also all Persons having Right or Title to Lands or Te∣nements, may know how to claim or demand their Right in such Cases, and that the Judges of the respective Courts of Common Pleas for the future may not vary herein, The Deputy Governour, Council and Assembly, have thought fit to declare, and they do hereby shew and declare, That all manner of Persons whatsoever that are concerned to make Claim to any Lands or Tenements within this Island, so as to make their Claim effectual,Claim saved by Action entred, and not other∣wise. are to make claim by their Action at Law duly entred in the Offices of the Courts where the Lands or Tenements are, according to the Forms, Practice and Rules of the said Courts: To which Action, the Te∣nants or Person in Possession, are to receive Summons from the said Court.

Plaintiffs in any Suit or Suits before them than what is to be made by their Action on Record and Summons given in manner aforesaid, and not otherwise; Any Law, Usage, Custom or Practice to the contrary notwithstand∣ing. And whereas Persons having or pretending Rights and Titles to Lands and Tenements in the possession of others, having once made their Claim within the times limited and appointed in the said Act, may for ever then after keep their Pretence of Right or Title to the same, by bringing their Action or Actions by way of Claim at Law once in Five Years, and so again in Five Years after, and so vex and trouble the Persons in Possession in such manner for ever. The Deputy Governour, Council and Assembly, for prevention and removal of so great an Inconveniency, do therefore Declare and E∣nact, And it is hereby Declared and Enacted, That all Persons whatso∣ever, that shall hereafter make their Claim to any Lands and Tenements within the time limited in the said Act; Do by the said Action,To bring Ac∣tion in Five Years to Trial. or by some other Action (if brought in the Five Years then next after, (bring the same to trial,That Trial to be definitive, and a Bar. and the same Trial to be conclusive and definitive on the Plaintiffs part for ever, and never to bring any Action then after for the same, but to be for ever barred; any Law, Usage, Custom or Prac∣tice to the contrary notwithstanding. And forasmuch as the Deputy Governour, Council and Assembly, having duly consulted the said Act, and the said Addition thereto, do find, that the said Act, being pleaded in Bar by the Possessors of Lands or Tenements against Persons who have not made their Claim within the time limited therein, such Persons so neglecting their Claim become utterly barred, But doth not provide, that all manner of Persons what∣soever, that shall at any time Claim under such Person or Persons who have lost their Claim, shall be in like manner barred by the said Act if pleaded; Nor that the said Act, or such parts thereof, as concern the matter aforesaid, can be given in Evidence to a Jury upon tryal of any such Matter or Right to the Lands or Tenements in question be∣tween Party and Party; Which if it had Provided and Enacted, would have been and hereafter would be much to the quiet of the Inhabitants
of this Island. And to the intent and on purpose, that such quiet may hereafter be to the said Inhabitants, It is Ordained and Enacted by the Deputy Governour, Coun∣cil and Assembly, and by the Authority of the same, That in all such cases, where any Person or Persons whatsoever have lost their Claim to any Lands or Tenements in this Island,He who claims under any one barred, is also barred. That all Persons whatsoever Claiming under any such Person, who have so lost their Claim, shall be utterly barred to all intents and purposes whatsoever; the same to be duly pleaded in Barr,Act of Non-claim to be pleaded, or gi∣ven in Evi∣dence. or given in Evidence to a Jury upon the Trayal of any such Right; And that the said Act and Addition thereto, or such Clause or Clauses in them, or either of them, as relate to the matter aforesaid, shall be given in Evidence to a Jury upon tryal as aforesaid, And that all Judges and Courts of the Common Pleas upon such Trials,Judges to al∣low it. accept the same as Evidence so far as the same shall concern the said matter in difference. And whereas it is provided in the said Act, that where a Man and his Wife in this Island, are willing to Alien and sell Lands, which is held in right of the Wife, they appearing before any chief Judge, and acknowledging their Deed, mentioning the same, with intent to pass away the Land, and duly Recorded in the publick Register, shall be effectual to convey the same, as if it had been done in England, by Fine and Recovery: But provideth not, where any Man and his Wife so having Lands in this Island, living in any parts remote, may by any way Convey the same.

And it is further Enacted, That whosoever shall by himself or any other, send off this Island any Person that hath Wife or Children, and leave his said Wife or Children behind him, who may become chargeable to the Parish where they live, That such Person or Persons so offending,

WHereas William Plumley, late of this Island Mariner, died seized of a considerable Estate in Lands and Negroes, and possest of di∣vers Stocks and other Goods and Chattels of Value and in his Life time, did contract very great Debts and Ingagements upon himself and his E∣state, and by several Obligations, Judgments and Mortgages, did in∣tangle and incumber his said Estate; which Incumbrances are now speedily like to fall upon the said Estate, and to tear the same in pieces, to the ut∣ter undoing of his surviving Wife and Children. And whereas the said William by his last Will and Testament, bear∣ing Date the 4th Day of February, 1675, amongst divers other things therein mentioned, has appointed and devised all or the greatest part of his Estate, to his Executors to be sold for the payment of his said Debts, and has made several Bequests to his younger Children for their Provi∣sion and Maintenance.

And whereas all the foregoing Premises were passed into an Act on the 12th of July, 1676; but it has so happened, that Two Years are fully elapsed since the Date thereof, and has not received the King's Gra∣tious Ratification to make it perpetual. And forasmuch as since the making the said Act, the Estate and Pre∣mises mentioned and intended therein, has been sold for very valuable considerations, for the ends and purposes designed by the said Act; And the Purchasers thereof have been chiefly incouraged thereunto by the in∣dubitable Security of their Title, being grounded upon the said Act; but now the said Act being of no force, for want of his Majesty's Royal Confirmation as aforesaid.

WHereas our late Sovereign Lord, Charles the First of blessed Me∣mory, did by his Letters Patent, under the great Seal of Eng∣land, grant and convey unto James Earl of Carlisle, and his Heirs for ever, the Propriety of this Island of Barbados: And his Sacred Majesty that now is, having by Purchase invested himself in all the Rights of the said Earl of Carlisle, and in all other Rights which any other Person may claim from that Patent or any other, And thereby more immediately and particularly hath taken this Island into his Royal Protection. And His Most Excellent Majesty, having by Letters Patent under the great Seal of England, bearing Date the Twelfth of June, in the Fifteenth Year of his Reign, appointed His Excellency, Francis Lord Willoughby of Par∣ham, Captain General, and Chief Governour of Barbados, and all the Charibbee-Islands, with full Power and Authority to Grant, Confirm and Assure to the Inhabitants of the same, and their Heirs for ever; All Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments under His Majesty's great Seal, appointed for Barbados and the rest of the Charibbee-Islands, as Relation be∣ing thereunto had, may and doth more at large appear. And whereas by virtue of the said Earl of Carlisle's Patent, divers Governours and Agents have been sent over hither, with Authority to lay out, set, grant or convey in Parcels the Lands within this Island, to such Persons as they should think fit; which was by them in their respective times, as much as in them lay accordingly performed. And whereas many have lost their Grants, Warrants and other E∣vidences for their said Lands, and others by reason of the ignorances
of those times, want sufficient and legal Words to create Inheritances in them and their Heirs; and others that never Recorded their Grants or Warrants; and others that can make no Proof of any Grants or War∣rants they ever had for their Lands, and yet have been long and quiet Possessors of the same and bestowed great Charges thereon. And whereas the Acknowledgment of Forty Pounds per Head, and other Taxes and Compositions formerly raised to the Earl of Carlisle was held very heavy. For a full Remedy therefore for all the Defects a∣fore related, and quieting the Possessions and setling the Tenures of the Inhabitants of this Island, Be it Enacted by his Excellency, Francis Lord Willoughby of Par∣ham, &c. his Council and Gentlemen of the Assembly, and by the Au∣thority of the same, That notwithstanding the Defects afore related, all the now Rightful Possessors of Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments within this Island, according to the Laws and Customs thereof, may at all times repair unto his Excellency for the full Confirmation of their Estates and Tenures; and then and there shall and may receive such full Confirmation and Assurance under His Majesty's great Seal for this Island, as they can reasonably advise or desire, according to the true intent and meaning of this Act. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every the Payments of Forty Pounds of Cotton per Head, and all other Duties, Rents and Arrears of Rents, which have or might have been levied, be from henceforth absolutely and fully released and made void; And that the Inhabitants of this Island, have and hold their several Plan∣tations to them and their Heirs for ever, in free and common Soccage; yielding and paying therefore at the Feast of St. Michael every Year, (if the same be lawfully demanded) one Ear of Indian Corn to His Majesty, his Heirs and Successors for ever, in full and free Discharge of all Rents and Services for the future whatsoever; in consideration of the Release of the said Forty Pounds, and in consideration of the confirmation of all Estates in this Island as aforesaid; and in acknowledgment of his Ma∣jesties Grace and Favour, in sending to, and appointing over us his said Excellency, of whose Prudence and moderate Government, we have hertofore had large experience, and do rest most assured thereof, for the future. And forasmuch as nothing conduceth more to the Peace and Prosperity of any Place, and the Protection of every Single Person therein, than that the Publick Revenue thereof may be in some measure proportioned to the Publick Charges and Expences, and also well weighing the great Charges that there must be of necessity, in the maintaining the Honour and Dignity of His Majesty's Authority here, the publick Meeting of the Sessions, the often Attendance of the Council, the Reparation of the Forts, the Building a Sessions House and a Prison, and all other publick Char∣ges incumbent on the Government, do in consideration thereof, give and grant unto his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors for ever; And do most humbly desire your Excellency, to accept these our Grants; and we hum∣bly pray your Excellency, That it may be Enacted. And be it En∣acted by his Excellency Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham, Captain Ge∣neral and Chief Governour of this Island of Barbados, and all other the Charibbee-Islands, and by and with the Consent of the Council and the Gentlemen of the Assembly, Representatives of this Island, and by Au∣thority of the same, That an Impost or Custom be from and after
Publication hereof raised upon the Native Commodities of this Island, af∣ter the proportions, and in manner and form as is hereafter set down and appointed, That is to say, Upon all dead Commodities, of the Growth or Produce of this Island, that shall be shipped off the same, shall be paid to our Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors for ever, Four and a Half in Specie for every Five Score. And be it further Enacted and Declared by the Authority afore∣said, That if any Goods before-mentioned, on which the said Custom is imposed and due by this Act, shall at any time hereafter be Ship'd or put into any Boat or other Vessel, to the intent to be carried into any Parts beyond the Seas (the said Imposition due for the same, not paid, compounded for, or lawfully tendred to the Collectors or their Depu∣ties, or not having agreed with the Commissioners for that purpose to be appointed, or their Deputies, for the same, according to the true in∣tent and meaning of the said Act, That then, and from thenceforth, shall the said Goods be forfeit, the one Moyety thereof to be to our Sovereign Lord the King, and the other to him that shall Inform, Seize and Sue for the same, in any Court of Record within this Island. Which Grants are left to your Excellencies own way of Levying, in full Confidence and Assurance, That your Excellency will take such course for the col∣lecting and gathering of the said Impost, without any Charge, Duty or Fees, as may be most for the ease of the People of this Island. Provided nevertheless, That neither this Act, nor any thing there∣in contained, shall extend, or be construed to bar his Majesty, or his said Excellency from his or their Right to any Land granted, or any In∣croachments made upon the Sea, since the Year One Thousand, Six Hundred and Fifty, or to any Lands commonly called or known by the Name of The Ten Thousand Acres, the Merchants Land granted by the late Earl of Carlisle or his Father, unto Marmaduke Rawden, Esquire, Wil∣liam Perkins, Alexander Banister, Edmond Forster, Captain Wheately and others their Associates, on certain Covenants and Conditions.

WHereas it hath been taken into consideration, that frequently very Costly, and sometimes very Tedious Suits at Law do happen upon Replevins of Distresses pretended to be taken Damage fesant, when indeed the Damage hath been little or nothing, and the Distress detained rather to vex and charge the Owner by forcing him to sue Re∣plevin, Than for any Harm done, or Satisfaction hoped thereby, and sundry Evils tending to the impoverishment of the poorer sort, are ob∣served to follow the same. To Prevent the like for the future, and that the Owner of the Distress may not be injured by too long detention thereof, nor the other Party for want of due Satisfaction, and both have Right with the greatest speed, ease and equity, and with the least Cost that may be, It is hereby Ordained and Enacted by His Excellency Sir Ri∣chard Dutton, Knight, Captain General and Chief Governour of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, and by Authority of the same, That any Per∣son or Persons that shall have any his Horses, Cattel or other living Chat∣tels of what kind soever, taken Damage feasant, or so pretended to be, may repair to the next Justice of the Peace,A Justice to grant a Sum∣mons. who is hereby required and impowered upon complaint and request of the Owner, to grant a War∣rant to Summons the other Party before him,To accord them. to answer the said Com∣plaint; And if upon hearing the matter, and what shall be said on ei∣ther
side,If not Three Men to view and appraise. he the said Justice cannot accord the Parties, Then grant a Warrant directed to Three of the Neighbouring Free-holders, them re∣quiring, or any Two of them, to view and appraise the Damage: Vp∣on return whereof,An Oath. and Oath made by the Appraisers to the said Ap∣praisment; as also Proof made of the payment or tender of what the Damage was appraised unto; which the said Justice hath hereby full power to Administer. Or if the Party detaining, shall not on Sum∣mons appear, or deliver the Goods detained, That then the Justice a∣foresaid shall issue a Warrant instead of a Replevin, to the next or any other Constable of the Parish,To re-deliver the Distresses. where the Distress was taken, him requiring and commanding the said Distress to take, and the same de∣liver and restore to the Complainant. Any Law or Custom heretofore used to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding. And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if the Party distreining, or any other Person shall to frustrate the effect of this Act, or so convey away such Distress, that the Constable cannot make deliverance according to his Warrant,If the delive∣rance of the Distresses hin∣dred, the Of∣fenders Person to be Arrested. In such case the Con∣stable shall take such Offender and bring him before the said Justice, to whom if it appear he hath so done, The said Justice shall cause Chat∣tles of the Parties, to the value, to be taken and delivered the Com∣plainant, or in want thereof,To lye in Goal till be re-deli∣ver. shall commit the Offender to Prison there, to remain until the said Distress may be taken, and deliverance made by the Constable as aforesaid. And it shall be lawful for the Justice or his Clerk to receive and take for each Warrant Six Pence in Money, and for each Replevin Twelve Pence in Money. Provided always, and it is the true intent and meaning hereof, that in case of Distresses for Rent,If he or they dispute of Title. or pretence of Title, where the Distress is taken, or upon pleading Property to the Goods so distreined, That then the power hereby given the said Justice of the Peace is immediate∣ly to cease,The Justices power to cease. To be tried at Common Law. and the Replevin to issue from the Common Law, where the same matter in difference is to be decided and not otherwise. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Person or Persons pleading property as aforesaid, doth not upon the Tryal of the Cause make good the same, the said Court, where such Tryal is had,Treble Cost. shall tax treble Cost against the Person so failing as afore∣said. Any Law to the contrary notwithstanding. Read and pass'd the Council, and consented to by his Excellency, the 10th Day of December, 1684. Read and pass'd the Assembly, the 9th Day of December, 1684, Ne∣mine contradicente. Edwin Stede, Deputy Secretary. Richard Cartwright, Clerk of the Assembly. No 301.

No 302. An ACT to continue an ACT, Intituled, An ACT for the settlement of the Militia of this Island. Expired. No 303. An ACT to impower Attorneys to confess Judgment upon particular Warrants. WHereas it has been a usual and lawful Practice for many of the Inhabitants of this Island, to confess Judgment by Warrant of Attorney directed to some one of the Attorneys of his Majesty's Courts of Common Pleas, therein warranting and desiring them, to appear before a certain Judge, naming the said Judge of his Majesty's Court of Common Pleas held for a certain Precinct of this Island, there before such Judge to confess Judgment, &c. And whereas it hath lately hapned by Death and Removal of the Honourable the Judges of this Island, from one Court to another, into other Precincts than where they lived at the time of giving such Warrant as aforesaid; it becomes impossible directly for the Attorney to pursue such Warrant, although the true intent and meaning thereof is only re∣lating to the Judgment, and not the precise manner of doing the same. And whereas many Inconveniencies may thereby arise, in as much as Debtors under those circumstances may either dispute or avoid their Judgments so to be confessed as aforesaid: For prevention of which In∣conveniency, Be it Enacted by his Excellency Sir Richard Dutton, Knight, Cap∣tain General, and Governour in Chief of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honourable the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of the same, That in such Case where any of the Attorneys of his Majesty's Courts of Common Pleas in this Island, have such Warrants of Attorney directed to them, to confess Judgment before such Judge, that is since the giving of the same, dead or removed from the Precincts where he was Judge at the time,Attorneys to confess Judg∣ment before the Judge of the Precincts, not∣withstanding the death or re∣moval of the former Judge. It shall and may be lawful for such Attorney or Attorneys by virtue of such Warrant as aforesaid, to confess Judgment for such Sum or Sums of Money or Sugar, as in the said Warrant is contained, before the present Judge of that Pre∣cinct where the Judgment is to be confessed, by virtue of such War∣rant. Which said Judgment so to be confessed as aforesaid,The Judgment to be effectual. shall be as firm and binding, and as good and effectual in Law, as if the same had been confessed before the Judge named in the said Warrant.And the At∣torney indemp∣nified. And the At∣torney or Attorneys so confessing Judgment by virtue of such Warrant, is hereby indempnified in so doing: Any Law, Custom or Construction to the contrary notwithstanding.

FOrasmuch as several Colonies and Plantations belonging to our most Gracious Sovereign King Charles the Second in America, have been lately infested by a dangerous sort of People called Pirates, who are not only Enemies to them of His Majesty's Settlement, but of all Man∣kind: And for that the Persons said to be Pirates, are most commonly Thieves, Robbers, Murtherers and Man-slayers, and other Misdoers con∣trary to the known Laws. And to the intent that all such that shall be taken in or about this Island, or brought Prisoners hither, may be pro∣ceded against according to the Statute made in the Twenty Eighth Year o ry the Eighth, Declaring and Enacting how Pirates on the Seas shall be Tried and Punished. Be it therefore Enacted by his Excellency, Sir Richard Dutton, Knight, Captain General, and Governour in Chief of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honourable the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of the same, That whatsoever Person or Per∣sons that are or shall be taken, sent or brought to this Island Prisoners, for having committed Treason, Felonies, Pyracies or other Offences up∣on the Seas, or in any Creek, Haven or Bay in or about this Island, shall be inquired, heard, tryed and determined in this Island, in such Form and Manner, as if such Offences had been committed, perpetrated and done upon the Land,Treason, Pyra∣cy, &c. to be tried as Of∣fences at Land. by virtue of a Commission under His Majesty's Seal appointed for this and other the Charibbee-Islands, signed by His Ma∣jesty's Governour or Commander in Chief here for the time being, im∣powering one Person to be chief Judge, together with Five or more sub∣stantial Persons by him in the said Commission to be appointed, to hear, try and determine the Offences aforesaid, after the common course of the Laws of the Kingdom of England. And such as shall be convicted of any such Offence or Offences, by Verdict, Confession or Process, by Authority of any such Commission, shall have and suffer such Pains of Death, Loss of Lands Goods and Chattels, as if they had been attainted and convicted of any such Crimes and Offences done upon the Land: Any Law or Statute to the contrary notwithstanding.

WHereas many Disputes have arisen, whether Servants, Labourers and Artificers, and all Persons that by an Act for good govern∣ing of Servants, and Ordaining the Rights between Masters and Ser∣vants, may recover their Wages and Debts arising for Work done a∣gainst the Executor or Administrator, before a Justice of the Peace, as well as they might have recovered the same, against the Testator or In∣testate in their Life-time. For Removing of which Doubts and Dis∣putes, Be it Enacted and Declared by the Right Honourable Edwin Stede, His Majesty's Lieutenant Governour, and Commander in Chief of this and other the Charibbee-Islands, the Honourable the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by the Authority of the same,An Executor or Administrator to be Sued for Wages before a Justice as Testator or In∣testate. That all Persons that by Virtue of the said Act, may Sue the Testator or Inte∣state before a Justice of the Peace, shall have the like Remedy against the Executor or Administrator. And whereas it is by the said Act provided, that the Debt or Du∣ty recoverable before a Justice of the Peace, shall not be above the Sum of Four Thousand Pounds of Sugar; so that the Ballance of an Account often falls within that Sum, when the Debt is much beyond it. Be it therefore Declared and Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Persons,The Ballance 4000 Pound of Sugar, or 25 Pound to be cognizable. the Ballance of whose Accounts for Wages or Work done, doth not exceed the value of Four Thousand Pounds of Sugar, or Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling, may Sue before the Justice of the Peace, as by the Act aforesaid is appointed.

Act they may do of their Labour only: Any Law or Usage to the con∣trary notwithstanding. Eodem Die Pass'd the Council, and consented to by the Lieutenant Governour. Pass'd the 15th Day of May, 1688. No 328. An ACT to revive and continue divers ACTS of this Island. Expired. No 329. An ACT for the Governing of Negroes. WHereas the Plantations and Estates of this Island cannot be ful∣ly managed, and brought into Use without the Labour and Ser∣vice of great Numbers of Negroes and other Slaves: And for as much as the said Negroes and other Slaves brought unto the People of this Island for that purpose are of barbarous, wild and salvage Natures, and such as renders them wholly unqualified, to be governed by the Laws, Customs and Practices of our Nations. It therefore becoming abso∣lutely necessary, that such other Constitutions, Laws and Orders, should be in this Island framed and Enacted for the good regulating and order∣ing of them, as may both restrain the Disorders, Rapines and Inhuma∣nities to which they are naturally prone and inclined, with such Encou∣ragements and Allowances as are fit and needful to their Support, that from both this Island through the Blessing of God thereon, may be pre∣served, His Majesty's Subjects in their Lives and Fortunes secured, and the Negroes and other Slaves be well provided for, and guarded from the Cruelties and Insolences of themselves or other ill-tempered People or Owners. To which purpose, Be it Enacted and Ordained by the Right Honourable Edwyn Steed, his Majesty's Lieutenant Governour, and Commander in Chief of this and other the Charribee-Islands, the Honourable the Council and General Assembly of this Island, and by Authority of the same, That no Master Mistriss, Commissioner or Overseer, of any Family in this Island, shall give their Negroes or other Slaves leave on Sabbath-Days, Holy-Days or any other time, to go out of their Plantations, except such Negro or other Slave as usually wait upon them at Home or Abroad, and wear∣ing a Livery, And no other Negro or Slave, except with a Ticket under the Master or Mistress Hand, or some other Person by his or her appointment, specifying the time allowed for his or her return, upon pain of forfeiting for every Negro or other Slave so licensed to go A∣broad, Two Shillings, and Six Pence Sterling, half of the said Fine to be to the Informer, and the other to the publick Treasury. And if any Master, Mistess, Commssioner or Overseer of a Plantation shall find any Negro, or other Slave in their Plantation at any time, without a Ticket or Business from his said Master and doth not apprehend them, or endeavour
so to do, and having apprehended them, shall not punish them with a Moderate Whipping, shall forfeit Ten Shillings Sterling, to be disposed of as aforesaid. And for that as it is absolutely necessary to the safety of this Place, That all due care be taken to restrain the Wandrings and Meetings of Negroes and other Slaves at all times, more espcially on Saturday Nights, Sundays and other Holy-days, and their using, and carrying of Clubs, Wooden-Swords, or other mischevious and dangerous Weapons, or using or keeping of Drums, Horns, or other loud Instruments, which may call together, or give Sign or Notice to one another of their wicked De∣signs and Purposes; and that all Masters, Overseers, and others may be encouraged and enjoyned diligently and carefully to prevent the same, Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall be lawful for all Masters, Overseers, and other Persons whatsoever, to apprehend and take up any Negro, or other Slave that shall be found out of the Plantation of his, or their Master or Owner, at any time, especially on Saturday Nights, Sundays or other Holy-days not being on lawful busi∣ness, and with a Letter from their Master, or a Ticket, or not having a white Man with them (except only such Negroes or other Slaves as usually attend their Masters, and have on a Livery) and the said Negro or other Slave or Slaves, correct by a moderate Whipping; and after Notice given to their Master, Owner or Overseer, him or them detain, until the said Master, Owner or Overseer pay to the said Person that took him up, Two Shillings and Six Pence for every such Negro or other Slave; he making Oath before the next Justice of the Peace (if thereunto required) by the Owner of such Negro or other Slave, that he found or saw no Letter or Ticket with him, as also any Negro or other Slave or Slaves met or found out of the Plantation of his or their Master or Mistress, though with a Letter or Ticket, If he or they be armed with such Clubs or other Offensive Weapons aforesaid, him or them so disarmed, take up and whip, and shall receive the same Reward as aforesaid, from the Master or Owner of such Negro or other Slave or Slaves; And what∣soever Master, Owner or Overseer shall permit or suffer his or their Ne∣gro or other Slave or Slaves, at any time hereafter to beat Drums, blow Horns, or use any other loud Instruments, and shall not cause his Negro-Houses once every Week to be diligently searched, and such Instruments if any be found, cause to be burned; or whosoever shall suffer and countenance any publick Meeting or Feasting of Strange Negroes or o∣ther Slaves in their Plantations, shall forfeit Fifty Shillings Sterling for e∣very such Offence, upon Conviction, or Proof as aforesaid, Provided an Information or other Suit be commenced within One Month after For∣feiture thereof for the same. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That every Overseer of a Family in this Island, shall cause all his Negro Houses to be searched diligently and effectually once every Fourteen Days for Fu∣gitive and Run-away Slaves, Clubs, Wooden-Swords, and other mis∣chievous Weapons; and finding any so, to take them away, and cause them to be burned; as also For Cloaths, Goods and any other things and Commodities that are not given them by their Master, Mistress, Com∣mander or Overseer, and honestly come by; in whose Custody they find any thing of that kind, and suspect or know to be Stolen Goods, the same they shall seize and take into their Custody; and a full and ample
Description of the particulars thereof in Writing, within Six Days after the Discovery thereof, to send to the Clerk of the Parish for the time being, who is hereby required to receive the same, and to enter upon it the Day of its Receipt, and the particulars to file and keep to himself; and shall set upon the Posts of the Church Door, a short Brief that such lost Goods are found; whereby any Person that hath lost his Goods, may the better come to the Knowledge where they are, by further en∣quiring for Stollen Goods, until he shall first declare what he hath lost, and the Marks and Descriptions thereof, and paid him Twelve Pence for the same; by which, if the Clerk shall be convinced, That any part of the Goods certified to him to be found, appertains to the Party en∣quiring, he is to direct the said Party enquiring, to the  and Party where his Goods be, who is hereby required to make  f what is in being, to the true Owner, upon the Penalt  Forfeitures of Twenty Shillings Sterling for every neglect by e Overseer or Clerks a∣foresaid in any of the particulars aforesaid. And for the more effectual detecting and punishing such Persons that trade with any Slaves for Stollen Goods, Be it further Enacted, that where any Person shall be suspected to trade as aforesaid, any Two Justices of the Peace, or the Justices of the Quarter Sessions of the Peace, shall have power to take from him suf∣ficient Recognizance not to trade with any Slaves contrary to the Laws of this Island; and if it shall afterwards appear to the Justices of the Quarter Sessions, that such Person hath, or hath had, or Shipped off any Goods suspected to be unlawfully come by, such Person being called before the Justices at the next Quarter Sessions following, shall there be obliged to make reasonable Proof of whom he bought, or how he came by the said Goods; and unless he do it, his Recognizance shall be forfeited. And be it further Enacted and Ordained, That if any Negro or Slave whatsoever, shall offer any Violence to any Christian, by striking or the like, such Negro or other Slave shall for his or her first Offence, by Information given upon Oath to the next Justice, be severely whip∣ped by the Constable, by Order of the said Justice. For his Second Of∣fence of that nature, by Order of the Justice of Peace, he shall be se∣verely whipped, his Nose slit, and be burned in some part of his Face with a Hot Iron. And for his Third Offence, he shall receive by Order of the Governour and Council, such greater Punishment as they shall think meet to inflict. Provided always, That such Striking or Con∣flict be not in the Lawful Defence of their Master's, Mistresses or Own∣ers of their Families or of their Goods. And it is hereby further Enacted, That all the Slaves within this Island, shall have Cloaths once every Year (that is to say) Drawers and Caps for Men, and Petty-Coats and Caps for Women, upon pain of Forfeiting Five Shillings for each Slave that shall not be cloathed as aforesaid; one Third to the Informer, the other Two Thirds to His Ma∣jesty, for the use of the Poor of the Parish where the Offender liveth. And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Persons who shall hereafter take up any Run-away or Fugitive Negro, or other Slave or Slaves, not knowing the Master or Owner of such Ne∣gro or Slave, and shall bring them unto the Provost-Marshal or his De∣puty, shall receive Ten Shillings Sterling from the Treasurer for the time being, who is hereby appointed to pay the same: And in case he shall refuse to make the said Payment upon presentment of the said Negro, or
other Slave or Slaves, and thereof Oath to be made before any Justice of the Peace, the said Justice is hereby authorized and required, to direct his Warrant to any Constable, to cause the Value thereof to be imme∣diately levied out of the Goods of the said Treasurer, and the said Goods to be delivered to the said Party. And the Negroes so brought, shall be kept in the Cage at the Stepping-Stones by the Provost Marshal, and not in Goal; which said Cage is always to be kept in sufficient Repair, at the Publick Charge of this Island. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That it shall and may be lawful for the said Provost Marshal, to retain and keep in his Custody as aforesaid, the Body of all such Run-aways, until the Owner of them shall pay unto the said Treasurer, Eleven Shillings Ster∣ling; and also unto the said Provost Marshal, Four Pence for every Four and Twenty Hours the said Fugitive Slave hath been in his Custody, and also until he have a Discharge under the Hand of the said Treasurer or his Clerk. And the Turn-Key shall receive Six Pence for every Negro delivered: Provided always, That the said Provost Marshal do fur∣nish the said Negroes and other Slaves, with sufficient Food and Drink, which is to be proved upon Oath, if by the Owner of the Negro or o∣ther Slaves it shall be so required to be done. And it is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any of the said Slaves shall dye for want of Food, the said Provost Mar∣shal shall be responsible for them to the Owners: And if the said Mar∣shal suffer any Slave to escape before he be duly delivered by a Discharge in Writing under the Hand of the abovesaid Treasurer, the Provost Mar∣shal shall pay unto him the aforesaid Treasurer, Eleven Shillings, and shall make further Satisfaction to the Owner, as by the Governour and Council shall be thought fit: And if the said Provost Marshal shall suffer any Slave to be otherwise employed out of the Cage, before due Deli∣very as aforesaid, he shall forfeit for each Slave so suffered as aforesaid, to the Owner thereof, the Sum of Five Pounds Sterling. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all such Persons as shall apprehend and bring down any Run-away Slave or Slaves to St. Michael's Town, unto the Treasurer for the time being, or to the Cage, shall upon such bringing down of such Run-away Slave or Slaves, deliver upon Oath to the said Treasurer, or in case of his Sick∣ness or Absence, to any Justice of the Peace, to be by him returned to the Treasurer's Office (before he shall receive the Consideration before appointed) an Account of his Name and Place of Aboad, with the Time when, and Place where he apprehended such Fugitive Slave or Slaves; And that he knew of no Ticket the Negro had, nor the Owner of such Ne∣gro or Slave, which the said Treasurer is hereby required to take and enter into a Book; to the intent that all Owners of Slaves may come to the right Knowledge and Understanding when their Slaves were Appre∣hended, and by whom, and whether they might be wrongfully taken up, or not; and that the Keeper of the Cage at the delivery of any Slaves, do take a Receipt of the Person to whom delivered, and there insert the Mark or Description of the Slave delivered. And whereas divers Evil and Ill-disposed Persons, have hitherto at∣tempted to steal away Slaves by specious Pretence of promising them Free∣dom in another Country, against which pernicious Practices, no Punish∣ment suitable hath been yet provided,
Be it therefore Enacted and Ordained by the Authority afore∣said, That what Person soever shall directly or indirectly at any time af∣ter Publication hereof, tempt or perswade any Negroes or other Slaves to leave their Masters or Mistresses Service to whom they are Slaves, out of an Intent and Design to carry away any of them off this Island, or to conceal or Entertain any of them upon this Island, or howsoever to defraud the said Masters or Mistresses of them, and be thereof convicted by their own Confession, or the Oath of One Credible Witness, shall be by the Two next Justices of the Peace where the Injured Person lives, whereof One to be of the Quorum, adjudged to pay the Master of the said Negro or other Slave, Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling, to be le∣vied as in the case of Servants Wages: But in case the Party offending shall not be found worth Lands, Goods or Chattels, to the value afore∣said; then shall the Justice for so long time as will recompence the Party injured for the Twenty Five Pounds aforesaid, adjudge him Servant for Five Years to the Party injured, and so deliver him over to him, and make a Record thereof. But if any Man shall so tempt and practise with any Persons, Negroes or other Slaves, and them actually so at∣tempted, convey away, or send off the Island, and be after Apprehended and convicted for the same in this Island, he shall be by the Two next Justices of the Peace as aforesaid, condemned to pay the Owner of such Negro or other Slave, Three times the Value of him or them, and Exe∣cution for the same from the Two Justices, to issue accordingly, as in the case of Servants Wages: And if the Person so offending, has no Estate, then he shall be ordered by the Justices to serve the Party injured as a∣foresaid. And whereas many heinous and grievous Crimes, as Murders, Bur∣glaries, Robbing in the High-ways, Rapes, Burning of Houses or Canes, be many times committed by Negroes and other Slaves, and many times maliciously attempted by them to be committed, in which, though by divers Accidents they are prevented, yet are their Crimes nevertheless heinous, and therefore deserve the like Punishment: And also do many times Steal wilfully, Kill, Maim or Destroy one or more Horses, Mares, Geldings, Cattel, Sheep or other Quick or Dead thing of the like na∣ture, and of the Value of Twelve Pence or above: And many times by attempting to steal from the Inhabitants of this Island, Stock and other Goods before-mentioned, of above or under the value aforesaid, do put such Inhabitants or some of his Family in Terror, Dread and Jeopardy of their Lives, which several Offenders for danger of Escape, are not long to be imprisoned: And being Bruitish Slaves, deserve not, for the Base∣ness of their Condition, to be tried by the Legal Trial of Twelve Men of their Peers or Neighbourhood, which neither truly can be rightly done as the Subjects of England are, nor is Execution to be delayed to∣wards them, in case of such horrid Crimes committed. It is therefore Enacted and Ordained by the Authority afore∣said, That when any such Crime as aforesaid, shall be committed, or at∣tempted to be committed, by any Negroes, Slave or Slaves, and the said Criminals be apprehended and brought before any of His Majesty's Ju∣stices of the Peace within this Island, and the Justices before whom the Criminals are brought, shall take Security for their forth coming, or send them to Prison, and with all convenient speed, shall join with him the next Justice of the Peace; And these Two shall by their Warrant or Precept, call to them Three Able, Good and Legal Free-holders of the
Place nearest where the said Crimes were committed, and these Five Per∣sons, viz. The Two Justices and the Three Freeholders, shall hear and examine all Evidences, Proofs and Testimonies, or by violent Circum∣stances they shall find such Negro or other Slave or Slaves guilty thereof, they shall give Sentence of Death upon them accordingly, the said Free∣holders being first Sworn before the Two Justices, who are hereby im∣powered to administer the same, and forthwith by their Warrant cause Execution to be done upon such Negro or Negroes, Slave or Slaves, by some Negro to be pressed for that purpose, by some Constable, to be appointed by Warrant from the said Justices. It is further Provided, That if any Free-holder shall make de∣fault to appear upon such Summons before the Justices, as is before men∣tioned, or appearing, refuse to joyn with them as is before appointed, and do shew no Cause for such Default, to be approved by the said Ju∣stices, then the aforesaid Justices do set a Fine upon him of Fifty Shil∣lings Sterling, forthwith by their Warrant or Precept to the next Con∣stable, or what Constable they shall think fit, to levy the same upon the said Freeeholders, their Goods or Chattels accordingly. And if any Per∣son shall send off his Negro that hath killed another, he shall pay unto the Master of such Negro, the Value of such Negro so killed as afore∣said. And in regard great Mischiefs daily happen by the Petty Lar∣cenies, committed also by the Negroes and Slaves of this Island, Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That if any Negro or other Slave shall hereafter steal or destroy any Goods, Chat∣tels and Provisions, Canes or green Corn whatsoever of any other Per∣sons than his Master's or Mistresses, being under the value of Twelve Pence, every Negro or other Slave so offending, and being brought before some Justice of the Peace of this Island, upon Complaint of the Party injured, and shall be adjudged guilty by Confession, Proof or probable Circumstances, such Negro or Slave so offending (excepting Children, whose Punishment is left wholly to the Discretion of the said Justice, shall be adjudged by such Justice to be publickly and severely whipped, not exceeding Forty Lashes; and the said Justice shall order and cause the Owner of such Ne∣gro or other Slave, to make Satisfaction to the Party injured; and if such Negro or other Slave punished as aforesaid, be afterwards found guilty of the like Crimes aforesaid, under the value of Twelve Pence as afore∣said, he or they for such, his or their Second Offence, shall by Order of the Justice of Peace before whom such Complaint and Proof is made, have his or their Noses slit, and be branded in the Forehead with a hot Iron, that the Mark thereof may remain: And the said Justices shall or∣der the Owner of such Negro or other Slave, to make Satisfaction to the Party injured, double the value of what his Loss shall appear: And if such Negro or other Slave after the Second time as aforesaid, be accused of Petty Larceny, or of any of the Offences before mentioned, such Ne∣gro or other Slave shall be tried in such manner as Murther, Burgla∣ry, &c. are provided for to be Tryed; and if such Negro or other Slave as shall be Tryed, shall be found guilty a Third time of any the Of∣fences afore-mentioned, then such Negro or other Slave for that Third Offence, shall be adjudged to suffer Death, in the manner as is appointed in Cases of Murder as aforesaid; or other Punishments as the said Justices shall think fit. And in case the said Justices and Freeholders, and any or either of them, shall neglect or refuse to perform the Duties by this Act
required of them, they shall severally for such their respective Defaults, forfeit the just Sum of Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling. And it is further Enacted, Ordained and Published by the Au∣thority aforesaid, That if any Negroes or other Slaves, shall make Muti∣ny or Insurrection, or rise in Rebellion against this Place or People, or make preparation of Arms, Powder, Bullets, or Offensive Weapons, or hold any Council or Conspiracy of, or raising Mutiny or Rebellion a∣gainst this Island, as hath been formerly attempted; that then for speedy Remedy thereof, the Governour of the Island, or Superior Officer for the time being, appoint a Colonel and the Field Officers of the Regiment of this Island, or any Four of them, to meet in Council, and proceed by the Marshal Law against the Actors, Contrivers, Raisers, Fomenters and Concealers of such Mutiny or Rebellion, and them punish by Death or other Pains as their Crimes shall deserve; As to the aforesaid Colonel and Field Officers, or any Four of them shall seem fit. Now forasmuch as the Loss of the Negroes and other Slaves that shall suffer Death by this Act, would prove so heavy for the Owner of them only to bear, and that the Owners of Negroes may not be discouraged to detect and discover the Offences of their Negroes; and that the Loss may be born by the Publick, whose safety by such Punishments is hereby provided for and intended. Be it Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That in all cases whatsoever, where any Negro or other Slave, by the appoint∣ment and Provision of this Act shall suffer Death, then shall such Justices and Freeholders, Colonel and Field Officers, who adjudged such Negro or other Slave to suffer Death, immediately after Sentence thereof given, inquire by the best means they are able, of the Value of such Negro or other Slave, in which Value they shall never exceed the Sum of Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling, for any One Negro or other Slave, and also the Damage of the Party injured, and make Certi∣ficate thereof to the Treasurer for the Time being, therein requiring the said Treasurer to pay out of the Value of the said Negro or Negroes, the Value of the Damage to the Party injured: And the Overplus if any be, to the Owner or Owners of such Negro or other Slaves; and if there be no Party injured, then the whole Value to the Owner or Owners of the said Negroes or other Slaves, and if there be no Party injured, then the whole Value of the Danger or Dangers of the said Ne∣groe or other Slave out of the Publick Treasury of this Island. But in regard there are some Masters and Owners of Negroes and other Slaves in this Island, who do not make sufficient Conscience of providing what is necessary for their Negroes or other Slaves, or allowing them time to Plant or Provide for themselves; for which cause such Negroes or other Slaves, are necessitated to commit Crimes contrary to the Law; and yet the safety of this Island requiring, that such Negroes and other Slaves shall suffer as the Law hath appointed, rather than the poor Inhabi∣tants of this Island be ruined, and driven from hence by their means. That therefore such Masters and Owners of Negroes and other Slaves whose neg∣lect of Negroes and other Slaves, makes them in some measure guilty of their Crimes, may not be countenanced therein at the Charge of the Publick. Be it hereby further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Justices and Freeholders appointed as aforesaid, to enquire into the Va∣lue of such Negro or other Slave as they shall sentence to Death, shall also further enquire by Witnesses examined on their Oaths, or by their good Information, how the Owner or Owners of such Negro or other Slave,
condemned as aforesaid, was provided with Provision and other Necessa∣ries, and what Allowances those Negroes and other Slaves had received. And if it shall appear to the said Justices and Freeholders, or the Major part of them, that the said Master or Owner had not provided rea∣sonably and as is generally accustomed for Negroes and other Slaves, and that necessity might have compelled the said Negro or other Slave to the Offences they have committed, Then and in that case, the Justices and Freeholders as aforesaid, shall certify the same to the Treasurer afore∣said, and only appoint the said Treasurer to pay the Damage to the Par∣ty injured, out of the Value of the said Negro or other Slave, and no∣thing to such Master or Owner. And if the Treasurer for the time be∣ing (having sufficient Publick Stock in his Hands) shall fail to make Sa∣tisfaction and Payment to such Master or Owner of any Negro or other Slave, he having the Governour's Warrant for the same, the Party injured shall have an Action of Debt upon such Certificate as aforesaid, against the said Treasurer in the Court of Common Pleas for the Precincts of St. Michael's, &c. And the Treasurer being thereto duly summoned, shall at the First Court after Summons, plead and come to Tryal, or else Judg∣ment to pass against him by Default; and after Judgment, Execution im∣mediately to issue for Satisfaction. And in regard the Planters necessity doth compel them for the Managemnt only of their Lands, to keep so vast a Stock of Negroes and other Slaves, whose desperate Lives and great Numbers become dangerous to them, and all other the Inhabitants. That therefore such who are not bound up by that necessity in having Plantations of their own, and hired Land, may not increase the danger to this Island, by keeping Negroes or other Slaves to hire out to others, Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That no Person of the Hebrew Nation residing in any Sea-Port Town of this Island, shall keep or imploy any Negro or other Slave, be he Man or Boy, for any Use or Service whatsoever, more than one Negro or other Slave, Man or Boy to be allowed to each of the Persons of the said Nation, except such as are Denizen'd by His Majesty's Letters Patents, and not otherwise, who are to keep no more than for their own use, as shall be approved by the Governour, Council and Assembly: And if any Negro, Man or Boy, more than is before allowed by this Act, shall be found Three Months after Publication hereof, in the Custody, Possession or Use of any the Per∣sons aforesaid, then every such Person or Persons, shall forfeit such Negro or other Slave, one Moyety of the Value thereof to whomsoever shall inform, and the other Moyety to His Majesty, to the Uses in this Act appointed. And whereas divers Negroes and other Slaves at this present are, and have been long since run away into Woods and other Fastness of this Island, doing continually much Mischief to the Inhabitants of this Island, hiding themselves sometimes in one Place, and sometimes in another, so that they are not to be found without much difficulty, Be it therefore Enacted, That from and after Publication hereof, it shall and may be lawful for any Justice of the Peace, Constable or Captain of a Company within this Island, that shall have notice of the Residency or Hiding-place of any Run-away Negroes, or other Fugi∣tive Slaves, to Raise and Arm any number of Men, not exceeding Twen∣ty, to apprehend and take them, either Alive or Dead. And for every Negro or other Slave that they shall take alive, having been run away above Six Months from his Master, they shall receive Fifty Shillings Ster∣ling; and for every Negro or other Slave that they shall take alive, having
been run away above Twelve Months Five Pound from the Master or Commanders of the said Negro or other Slave; if killed in taking, they shall receive Fifty Shillings Sterling from the Publick; any Act or Statute heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding. And it is further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority afore∣said, That if any Negro or other Slave under Punishment by his Master or his Order for running away, or any other Crimes or Misdemeanors towards his said Master, unfortunately shall suffer in Life or Member, which seldom happens; no Person whatsoever shall be liable to any Fine therefore. But if any Man shall of wantonness, or only of Bloody Mindedness, or Cruel Intention, willfully kill a Negro or other Slave of his own, he shall pay into the Publick Treasury, Fifteen Pounds Ster∣ling: But if he shall so kill another Man's, He shall pay to the Owner of the Negro, double the Value, and into the Publick Treasury, Twen∣ty Five Pounds Sterling. And he shall further by the next Justice of the Peace, be bound to the good Behaviour during the Pleasure of the Go∣vernour and Council, and not be liable to any other Punishment or Forfeiture for the same; neither is he that kills another Man's Negro or other Slave by Accident, liable to any other Penalty but the Owner's Ac∣tion at Law. But if any poor small Freeholder or other Person, kill a Negro or other Slave by Night, out of the Road or Common Path, and Stealing, or attempting to Steal, his Provision, Swine or other Goods, he shall not be accountable for it: Any Law, Statute or Ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all the Fines and Forfeitures arising by this Act, shall be to His Majesty for the use of this Island, according to such uses and proportion that in the afore∣said Clauses are respectively appointed; and such thereof as are not o∣therwise limited and appointed in this Act, as are above the Sum of Five Pounds Sterling, shall be recovered by Bill, Plaint or Information, in any of his Majesty's Courts of Record within this Island; and such as are of the Sum aforesaid, or under, shall be recovered before any Justice of the Peace within this Island, who is hereby required to grant Execution for the same, as in the case of Servants Wages, Provided the same be commenced within Thirty Days after the same be forfeited. And lastly, to the intent this Act and every Clause and Branch there∣of may receive full Execution, and no Person plead Ignorance therein, It is Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That this Act be Read and Published in all the respective Parish Churches in this Island, the first Sunday in February, and the first Sunday in August in e∣very Year ensuing. And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all Acts heretofore made concerning, or any ways relating to the Governing of Negroes, Enacted before the Date of this Act, shall be Repealed, and are hereby Repealed to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever. Read and pass'd the Council, and consented to by the L. Governour, the 8th of August, 1688. Pass'd the Assembly, the 10th of July, 1688.

Wherefore for Prevention of the said Inconveniences for the future,

And if they the said Field Officers shall find the said Negro or Slave guilty of what he or she stands accused, and shall condemn him or her to suffer Death, Such Field Officers shall appraise the Condemned Negro as by the said Act is appointed: But the Negro which accuses the other, the Field Officers shall appraise at his or her full Value and worth, although it exceed the Sum by the said Act limited; of which the said Field Officers shall forthwith certify his Excellency or the Governour for the time being upon Oath; who is hereby requested to draw an Order on the Treasurer for that Sum which such Accuser is va∣lued at, to be paid to the Owner of such Negro or Slave at sight. And upon Payment thereof, his Excellency or the Governour for the time be∣ing, is requested to declare the said Negro or Slave free, and such Ne∣gro shall be sent off this Island by the Treasurer, to such Place where he or she shall desire, who is hereby required to pay for such Negroes Passage. But if such Negro had rather stay here with his Master, Mistress or Fa∣mily,

the terror and affrightment of the Neighbourhood, but the danger of the Island in general.

And forasmuch as many Disorders are committed by Petrols, by rea∣son that the Command of them is given often to loose and inconsi∣derable Persons, occasioned chiefly by refusal of such Command, by the more able and sober Persons. For Remedy whereof, Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That whatsoever Person (except as before excepted) shall from and after Publication of this Act,Neglect of Ser∣vice on Petrols, to forfeit Twen∣ty Shillings. refuse or neglect such Command, being thereunto required by the Cap∣tain or Commander in chief of each respective Troop, shall for every such Offence, forfeit Twenty Shillings, to be levied by the Marshal of the said Regiment; and the Commander of such Petrol, is hereby im∣powered and required to make Returns of such Defaulters for Non-ap∣pearance,

But if the Plain∣tiff doth not make good his Action, so that the Returns appear to be le∣gally made, then the Court shall tax treble Cost for the Officer or Person who made such Returns for his unjust Vexation; any thing in this Act to the contrary notwithstanding. And for that the Marshal upon an Execution Signed against any Per∣son by the Colonel or Commander in chief of the Regiment shall not be hindred from executing the said Execution against, or upon any Person so returned for the Defaults in the Militia, as by this Act appointed, and for that likewise the Party grieved may not have his Goods carried and driven away by the said Marshal, It is therefore Enacted and Ordained, That the Party whose Goods are so Attached,Goods levied on, to be in the Delinquents  Custody, Bon being given. shall apply himself in Ten Days after such Exe∣cution levied to the Colonel or Commander in chief of the Regiment to which he belongs, who is hereby impowered and required to order the Goods so Attach'd from the Party, to remain in the Delinquent's own Possession; and the said Marshal is hereby required to yield all due O∣bedience to the same, and the said Delinquent at the same time, shall give a Bond to the said Marshal in double the Value of such Execution or Executions so levied, that he will bring the aforesaid Action within one Month at furthest after such Complaint; and that if the Action so brought, or being brought, shall not be found for the Plaintiff, so that the return of the Officer is adjudged lawful, then the Complainant shall in Five Days return the Goods so Attached to the Marshal, or pay the Value they shall be Appraised at; which if not complied with, then the said Marshal shall recover the whole Penalty in the said Bond, against such Complainant as aforesaid, by Action at the Common Law without Appeal, and the Court is hereby impowered to Tax common Cost.
