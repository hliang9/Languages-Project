C R royal blazon or coat of arms At Edinburgh, the twenty fifth day of January, 1677. Forasmuch; as a considerable number of Brewers for themselves; and in behalf of the remanent Brewers within the Town of Edin∣burgh, and the Shires of Edinburgh and Haddingtoun, have proposed and desired, that they may be allowed to sell the Ale and drink∣ing beer for this present year, at twenty pennies the pynt, with the addition of the Excise and Imposition granted in behalf of the Town of Edinburgh: And, seing according to the proportion setled by the late Act of Parliament, and Proclamations, for regu∣lating the prices of Ale and Drinking-beer, when the Ale and Drinking-beer is sold at twenty pennies the pynt, with the addition foresaid, the Beer ought to be eight pound the boll. And the saids Brewers have proposed, that in regard they have considerable quantities of Victual upon their hand bought of the cropt 1675. at high prices, not yet consumed, so that for this year they cannot come the vvhole length of eighth pound, which is the Rule and Standard appointed by the Proclamation: And therefore desiring the Council might dispense there∣with so far, as that they may be able to brew with some small advantage; And seing the saids Brewers have consented that the price of the boll of good and sufficient bear, shall be betwixt seven and eight pounds, and not below seven pound for the boll of all Bear that is to be browen and made in Malt of the Cropt and year, 1676, last by past. And it being most just and reasonable, that all Brewers, great and small, should be in an equal and like condition, as to the price of the drink to be sold by them, and the price of the Bear of which the same is made; which cannot be practicable, if they should be permitted to buy Bear at different prices, in respect, these who buy bear below the foresaid price, may under-sell these that do buy the Bear at the same: and so may enhance and engrosse to themselves the trade and benefit of Brewing, to the prejudice and ruine of others; And for preventing the inconvenience and prejudice foresaid, It is thought necessary, and is proposed and desired by the saids Brewers, that the said price should be setled as a just and uniform price to be payed for this year by all Brewers and Malt-men, who shall buy bear for brewing or making of malt within the said Town and Shires, and that of their own consent they should be obliged, and grant bonds to the effect foresaid. And because diverse persons, who sell and tap Wine or are Cooks or Stablers, do brew: and upon occasion of their Trades and Employments fore∣saids, do tap and sell Ale and drinking bear, browen by themselves, whereby they may sell their drink with greater advantage then other Brewers that must share and divide betwixt them and Tapsters the benefit, that the saids persons will have intirely to themselves, and so may under-sell the other Brewers, to their prejudice and ruine: And whereas, notwithstanding of the said Proclamation, the smaller Brewers, whose survey rolls were under two Bolls, have not given Band to one of His Majesties Privy Council, and obtained licence betwixt and the day therein appointed, and so have forefaulted the benefit of brewing. The Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, in Prosecution of the said Act of Parliament and Proclamations foresaids, do here∣by discharge any person or persons, Brewers great or small within the Burgh of Edinburgh, Leith and Cannongate, or Suburbs thereof, or within the saids Shires of Edinburgh or Haddingtoun to take upon them, upon pretext of any former licence granted to them, or upon any other pretext or ground whatsoever, to brew any Ale or Drinking-beer, untill they first subscrive the said Bond; and upon subscriving thereof, obtain a licence for that ef∣fect from the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, or Committee appointed by them, which persons, subscriving the said Bond, and receiving li∣cence as aforesaid, are hereby allowed, not only to brew single Ale at the price of twenty pennies the pynt, with the addit on as aforesaid, but also to brew double or three shilling Ale; provided, that they who brew the double Ale, shall be obliged also to brew the single Ale, In which case, The saids Lords have in so far dispensed with the said Proclamation in the behalf of the saids Brewers, upon the considerations foresaids, until the first day of January, 1678. And whereas Malt-men and others, who take upon them to make Malt within the saids bounds; do exact far greater rates, betwixt the price of the Boll of Beer, and the Boll of Malt, then what is allowed by the ancient Laws made in that behalf; The saids Lords do hereby discharge any person whatsomever within the saids bounds to make Malt, untill they find caution acted in the Books of Council, that they shall buy the Bear at the price foresaid for this present year: and that they shall take no more but half a mark betwixt the Boll of Bear and the Boll of Malt, conform to the Acts of Parliament, and obtain licence for that effect as aforesaid, as they will be answerable on their perill: And in regard, that divers persons within the City of Edinburgh, Leith, Cannongate, Abbay, Caldtoun, Craigend, Yeard-heads, New-haven, Pleasants, and St. Ninians∣raw, who are Ventiners of Wine, Cooks or Stablers do both brew, and tap and sell Ale and Drinking-bear browen by themselves, whereby they may sell their drink with greater advantage then other Brewers; and so may undersell the other Brewers to their great hurt and prejudice▪ The saids Lords do hereby discharge any Ventiners of Wine, Cooks or Stablers in the saids Bounds, to vent or retail any Ale or Drinking-beer, or if they continue in retailing, to quite their Brewing as they will be answerable at their perill. And whereas both Brewers, Ventiners and the Leidges sustain great dammage by the unequal measure of Barrels, some being above measure, and some under, occasioned chiefly by the neglect and fault of Coupers: The saids Lords do hereby ordain all Coupers that makes any Brewers Casks, to make their Casks no bigger, nor with the addition of a Chopin to each Gallon: Ordaining every Couper to put his own mark upon his own work, that the Contraveeners may be known; and that all Casks already made be justed and made equal, betwixt and the first day of May next, as the saids Coupers and Brewers will be ansvverable at their peril: And ordains these presents to be printed and published at the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and other places needful, that none pretend ignorance.
