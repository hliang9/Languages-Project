An Elegie upon the Earle of ESSEX'S Funerall. ANd are these all the rites that must be done, Thrice Noble Essex, Englands Champion: Some men, some walls, some horses put in black, With the throng scrambling for sweet-meats and Sack, A gawdy Herald, and a velvet Herse, A tatt'red Anagram with grievous verse, And a sad Sermon to conclude withall, Shall this be stil'd great Essexs Funerall? Niggardly Nation, be asham'd of thods, Lesse valour among Heathen made men Gods, Should such a Generall have dy'd in Rome, He must have had an Altar▪ not a Tombe, And there instead of youthfull Elegies, Grave Senators had offer'd sacrifice To divine Devereux: ô for a vote (Ye Lords and Commons ye are bound to doo't) A vote that who is seen to smile this year, A vote, that who so brings not in a tear, Shall be adjudg'd Malignant: It were wise T'erect an Office in the Peoples eyes For issuing forth a constant sum of tears; There's no way else to pay him his arrears. And when we have drein'd this Ages eyes quite dry, Let him be wept the next▪ in History, Which if Posterity shall dare to doubt, Then Glosters whispering walls shall speak him out: And so his Funerall shall not be done, Till he return i' th' Resurrection.
