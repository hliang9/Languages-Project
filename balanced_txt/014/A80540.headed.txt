The other, to the Protestants of England. Wherein is many things mentioned worthy the due Observa∣tion of all those that love God and King CHARLES; and desire Peace. London Printed for a faithfull Royalisti, Anno Dom. MDCXLIII.
To the Earle of NEWCASTLE, and his Popish Army. MY Lords and Gentlemen and the rest of this Popish Army, I beseech you be not acashed to behold the raised againe from the deade in the world, sith the sights and teares of poore England, have broken up my Tombe, and the cruell intentions of the motrous of my heart when I was li∣ving, have violently drawne my poore Soule to cry a∣loud to you, but alas I feare that my admonitions will prove as unprofitable as charitable. Do but call to minde our former Treasons, when I was as active as any Papist. 1 To seize on the Tower, the Livetenant to have twenty thousand pounds, his Sonne to marry with Sraffords daughter, with meanes to live on; Strafford to be sent into IRELAND, an to send an Army hi∣ther and to go into France to prepare an Army from thence: this you know god prevented, and straford was beheaded, and yet Ireland Rebel'd. 2. to posesse the northerne Armies of an ill oppinion of the house, and to make them advance to London, this you know was prevented also. 3. To deliver Portsmouth into Iar∣mins hands to be a Randevoues for the french Papists but he was faine to fly as well as I. 4. The Bishops to Raise two thousand horse. 5. The Lord of New∣Castle to be made Generall of the Northren Army, and to have met them with the Army at Nottingham.
It may be, you will boast of these two last projects, but I would you would consider what I neglected, and not drawe upon your selves murthers, plagues, fa∣mines, and other miseries; do you not here the voyce of innocent bloud, which cryes out & sayes that your cruelty are great crimes before God, and your gnilti∣nesse of cruell murther; you may one day feele that trouble of soule whereof I am now to sensible, for the great disorder of those intentions which we carry with fire at our backes, whilest we played a thousand crowns at Dice upon a table after dinner &c. But whilest you are thus the murtherers of others, you shall also most assuredly bring destruction upon your owne soules; And you that are Protestants among them, this shal∣be the greatest favour that some of you shall obtaine, that you shalbe the last that shalbe devoured. Were it not better then, that you should joyne your affections, your courage, and that force which as yet you have resting, altogether to save and defend your KING, Parliament, Religion, Law, and Liberty, from this sheeppracke; and rather drowne your Enemies therein. It may be that  Lords and Gentle∣men will say, that this connction is impossible, and in vaine; & as  as you should not be seconded by the Nobility. In may be that your fidility formerly past and committed hath much devided your affecti∣ons, but now you perceive and know the damage, and hurt that this infiility hath done unto you; and the great good from which it doth with draw you, set up∣on the Papists the  thereof. It is a sad thing that men should never cease to sinn; and that your confidences should never stirre nor move you to Re∣pentance; specially at this day: when doth one of your
lives and good are interest therein, have we not beene affections now seperated to be reioyned and united a∣gaine, thereby to withstand and oppose a common e∣nemy: Doggs do the same against Wolves, to save their flockes; and children against strangers to preserve their owne houses: Doe it then to defend your Kings honour, your Native Country, Lawes and Liberty, Religion, Estates: In a word to save that, for the which you sware, and are devided among your selves; if not, then hereafter do not pretend that there is any life, dwelling state, quality, honour, or good whatsoe∣ver resting to be sever for our England, I and no other way of safety for you: it is not fight, nor desperate resolutions that can save you; I cannot see any hope otherwise of any honest and honourable death, is the only griefe that a man can do nothing in this respect: do not cause the most couragious and best beloved of God, to dye for sorrow, that is they may nor be kept as a pray to the Papists Tyrany, and the object of their cruelty. To the Protestants of ENGLAND. YOu famous Nobility, the true Protestants of Eng∣land, that have obtained your great Priviledges; for having so often beene the Fundamentall stones of this state cimented with your bloud: Infinite times the protections of our Kings, bridles against usurpati∣ons of strangers, can you degenerate, or become faint∣hearted, and bandon the ensignes of your vertues, so dearely woone and obtained for prey to your enemies.
Suppose that an upstart Popish Army hath those that discover their treason and tyranny and are able to approove them for the same, it is much if the chil∣dren that are borne under it, may be sure of their lives the papists fearing will no doubt be cruell against you then with a good will and couragious heart, follow the good motious of your King and Parliament: I know that many there are in the Kingdome, that have labour¦ed to coole the heart of your zeale, but let not them hinder nor with draw you, in this worthy occasion, to joyne with those who seeke the preservation of your Country and your selves. And you my Masters of the Commonnulty, effect this last worke, for the healing of your disease, for which purpose you have sent your representative body to stand for you in their places in the high Court of Parliament, they are faithfull to them, but you procure your owne sicknesse by being luld a sleepe with false pretences of the Papists, there∣by to pull the sky of from their backs: you are fedd with false pretences, to maintaine and support your patience and to lay sugar upon the long pills of poyson which they make you swallow downe, many of you are so sicke that you feele not your paine, and many that feele it can finde no ease but fighs, or at least some silent groans; it is not enough, you must cry out, and that so loud that you may be understood, speake bold∣ly and flatter not your selves, feare not your enemies, you cannot be worse then you are, but you may hope for change, tell them that you have seene your last li∣berty (if Papists should triumph) and that you now feele the extreamity of their treachiry, unslpeeses be remedets, it is now time or never, to free the spirit of our Royall King, and his state, and to pull away the
foote that is ready to tread upon his belly, drownd his enemies in your bloud, I intend not hereby to make or intice you to a greater comotion, or to stirr up new disorders amongst your selves, my endeavouring is cleane contrary, you aught to loyne and remit all your affection and interest together for the peace of distres∣sed England, Then altogether with one voice require that the Popish Army may be called in questian to yel'd account of their Resuing and commission; they for their ill doing are subject to the Law, and to justice, as well as now they openly dominier in their Rande∣vouz, as when they seduced in corners. Is it not great reason that every one should yeild account of their actions, doth not our Royall King himselfe gratifie his Subjects with declarations, why then should they that are subjects refuse to appeare before the high Court of Parliament before that ho∣nourable Senate at VVestminster, where Papish hath no place, their they should obtaine but too great ho∣nour to be tryed and Iudged by their peers, if consience make them shunn and abhorr their state, and their courage perswade them (before they be accused) that they shall be overthrowne, they condemne themselves and so their can remaine no more but their execution behind, you have reason and power enough beside God on your side if you assist this cause to do it by armes, they shall not so escape Iustice but that shee will try∣umph over you God will hinder them from with∣drawing them selves from the law and from the exam∣ple from which he hath refered them, assure your selves that the very consiences of their cheife agents in their Rebellion agatnst the King and Parliament which have faild them in their preteous designes will also faile
them in bringing them to punishment you must extend it unto all the principall executioners of their design against the King and Parliament, where the intyre ex∣ecution to the Parliament let them reedify the parma∣dies that is fallen downe, and suffer them to drive away those plagues and evill cankers of the state, those tyrant of mens spirits and consciences which doth daly induce athousand tyrants in England, would inable our King our Parliment and liberties slaves and and Subjects to strangers I have heard that the King of France this Kings Fa∣ther when the Marshal' Ancie died, said that then he began to Raigne, if England deliver his Majesty from these tyrants that have made us a thousand times morn like france for the Marshal'd Ancre, England will then give his Majesty great reason to say that he begins to live in the resurrection of his state, make speed then to patten this generous designe, let every one of you both generall and particular that are tru Britaines be ashamed to be prevented, is it possible that of so great a good which cannot be sound enough conceived, the execution should be deferred untill the morrow, for my part al∣though I am but a Ghost, I have bene as violent an ene∣my against England as any of them, yet I am very sory for it, and with too late repentance cure it, and I will now withall speed goe to assaile and torment their cou∣rages, and consienses, and teare them in peses with con∣tinuall feares and terrours, to all my good freinds. FINIS.
