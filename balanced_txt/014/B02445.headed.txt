Covetous-minded Parents, O.R, The Languishing young Gentlewoman Whose Friends would have her Marry an old Miser for the sake of his Gold, which she utterly refused to do, resolveing to be true to the first. Tune is, Farwell my dearest Dear. Licensed according to Order. I Am a Damosel fair of blooming Beauty; Therefore I do declare it is my Duty My Parents to obey, Father and Mother; They'd have me Marry Gray, I love another. Gray hath five Thousand Pound, in ready Money; There Riches doth abound, but yet my Honey Whom I shall still adore, brings Love and Pleasure, The which I value more than Gold and Treasure. Good God what shall I do, whom shall I matry? Father and Mother too constantly weary Their Child to entertain this wretched Miser; For which they are to blame, would they were wiser. What are those baggs of Gold without a Blessing? My Dearest Love behold he is possessing My heart and all that's dear, how can I leave him? Heaven may prove severe it I deceive him. Before my Vow I'll break, Death shall destroy me: I will no other take, he must enjoy me. Though Friends continually scorn and deride me; With him I'll Live and dye, what e're betide me. Though Gray hath Riches store, my Dear's above him; Nay, had he ten times more, I could not love him: His Gold I count but dross, dregs of confusion, Which often proves a cross in the conclusion. Gold, Pearl and Silver bright I ne'r desire Give me my hearts delight, whom I admire; That Treasure I'd enjoy, my sweetest jewel: What grief will me destroy, Parents are cruel. Though tedious Nights I spend in mournful weeping; My Heart, intire Friend, thou hast in keeping: Bear up a cheerful mind, let nothing grieve thee; It I was not confin'd, I'd never leave thee. When my free liberty once I recover; I'll quickly be with thee my loyal lover. Though now with bitter mean, grief does annoy me, No man but thee alone e're shall enjoy me. Printed for P, Brooksby, J. Deacon, J. Blare, J. Ba
