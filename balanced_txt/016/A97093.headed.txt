An Antidote AGAINSTMASTER EDWARDS HIS OLD AND NEW POYSON. THough God hath given unto Mr. Edwards, parts and abilities, where with a to acquire a comfortable life, in a just and good way, and wherein hee might bee helpefull unto many, and hurtfull unto none; neverthelesse hee seemeth unhappily to have placed his contentment in being a Master and Comp∣trouler of other mens judgements and pra∣ctises in the worship of God, (wherein the Word of God and a mans owne conscience is only to governe): and thereupon (neces∣sarily) finding opposition from al conscien∣sious people, hee growes most passionately impatient, and even violently madd against all such as either plead their cause, or take their part; plainly manifesting, throughout
the whole course of his preaching and wri∣ting, that he would esteem it his greatest fe∣licity, if he could prevaile with authority, or provoke any others to the perpetuall mole∣station and destruction, of all that will not (though against their consciences) submit to those rules which he approveth. Now the piety and justice of this Honou∣rable Parliament, having so lately freed this long oppressed Nation, from this very kind of Tyranny, in the Bishops and Prelaticall Clergy, and very many judicious, and con∣siderate persons (through a blessed opportu∣nity, freedome of discourse, and cleerer search of Scripture then heretofore) being fully satisfied in their understandings, that to compell or restraine, any peaceable per∣son in matters of faith, and the worship of God, is as reall a sinne, and as odious in the sight of God as murther, theft or adultery, and thereupon engaging themselves in the just defence of liberty of conscience, Master Edwards his worke (of bowing all to his rule) falls out to be very difficult, and im∣possible (by any arguments drawn from the word of God) to be effected, or proved just. And this also, in steed of qualifying his spirit, or stopping him in his race, hath set
him all on fire, that he rageth like an Irish, ravenous and hungry woolfe, deprived of his prey by generous and true English Ma∣stives, that watch both night and day to save the harmlesse and benefitiall sheep (the Independants and Separatists) who from the begining of these our troubles, to this very day, have continually without repining con∣tributed their fleece for clothing, and their limbes and lives for nourishment, and strength, to preserve not only their owne liberties, but the just liberties of this Nation; Yet nothing abaieth the madnesse of this prophet; but even (as is to be feared) against his owne conscience, and as if hired there∣unto by some politique Balacks, hee flieth from one hill to another, from authority to authority, hath his parables and his offer∣ings, and Satan like, would tempt the Lord himselfe to fall downe and worship him, to go against his owne declared will, and to stir up a persecuting spirit in the Magistrate, against this his beloved Israel, to compell them to worship him (as doe the Hipo∣crites) against their minds and consciences, then which nothing could be more abomi∣nable in his sight. And though he cannot but see the hand of God against him, and that notwithstan∣ding
all his opposition, or any others, the numbers of them are daily increased, and that their faithfulnesse to the Parliament & cōmon-wealth, hath caused them to grow in favor with al the People; though (if he would speak his heart) he must as Baalam, perforce acknowledge there is no enchantment against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel; no pre∣vailing for a coersive power, against this good people, in a time of refreshment from any just Authority: Yet persists he in his ungodly resolution, and seeing and know∣ing that God will by no meanes answer his eager desire, of cursing this part of his peo∣ple; he seemeth to grow desperate, and like as Saul when God had cast him off, and re∣fused to answer him, either by Vrim or Vi∣sion, be-tooke himselfe to the witch of En∣dor, even so this most unhappy man, beta∣keth himselfe to Machivillian policy, for execution of his cruel purposes against them: and finding no just or judicious party that will afford him any countenance, or assi∣stance, he applyeth himselfe to any that hate them, though enemies to the common∣wealth, hazarding the doing of their wrok, so that with them, and by them, he may but doe his owne, whereunto the weaknesses of many wel minded heople ministreth to gerat
an advantage, their rashnesse and to easie credulity, being all the foundation which he hath now left, to build his hopes upon, for if these would but a while suspend their belief, and patiently consider the things he hath spoken or is about to publish, and would there upon with draw themselves from his wicked and delusive counsels, and insteed thereof would fall to councelling of him to forsake his violent Rayling, and reviling, of a people they know to be faithfull, it were then impossible for him to effect his unjust designes, wch also (if effected) must necessa∣rily be the bondage or ruin of all sorts of wel minded people, as wel Presbiterians as others (however his charmings may for the present flatter them) that must and will be the con∣clusion, if they continue to take in his poy∣sonous counsells, how pleasing soever they seem to a pallat corrupted by long costome; they are poysonous, and will in time both swell and destroy them. And therefore unto this sort of people, doe I at this time principally ad∣dresse this discourse by way of Anti∣dote, to prevent the working of his banefull Counsels, and to frustrate his accursed ends. This unjust man, knoweth all just and
judicious men, cannot but oppose his un∣just designes, and therefore it is, he hath de∣nounced so many of them by name in his books, as his enemies, his ablest enenies they are, and the more powerfull, because they are all knowne to be really faithfull to the Parliament: In this case saith Machivel there is but one help, that is. they must be brought into disgrace, and disrepute, with the people, for if these remain in credit, the people will give eare unto them, be rightly informed by them & be in no capacity to be deceived: well saies Mr. Edwards, how shall they be sufficiently reproached: Why saies Machivel, seek out unto your ayd honest zealous persons of godly life, and good re∣pure in the world, such as you know are fiery hot against errours and heresies so called, and unto them sadly complaine of the dayly infinite increase thereof, & intreat their assistance in the extirpation of them, & for that end desire them to collect their me∣mories, what they have heard in any dis∣course, what they have any waies observed or knowne, to proceed from such and such men, naming divets, that are taken and re∣puted to be either grand Hereticks, and Schismatiques themselves, or the defend∣ers and maintainers of them, by word or
writing, tell them you have heard that such and such, hold and such blasphemous opinions, at such and such a time uttered, such & such horrible speeches, pray them to consider how exceeding necessary it is such things were knowne, and made publique to all the world, left through ignorance such blasphemous and hereticall persons in time get into offices of Magistracy, if not into the Parliament it selfe; lay before thom the dan∣ger if it should be so, and intreat them (for prevention) that they will thrust themselves into all meetings, companies, and societies, to provoke discourses, and to take notice of what they observe, or can any waies learne of any of them or any others, and it shall be your care to divulge them to the world, in the strongest colours your Art can give them: And (saith Machivel) as they through eagernesse, will over-heare and make things worse then they were either spoken or in∣tended, so it must be your care to make them rather wors then better, then their relations, you must be sure to cast durt enough upon them, some will stick, and a little (amongst those you would pervert) will suffice to ble∣mish the clearest and most able amongst them, and to deprive them of all credit and and repute for ever.
If you observe any man to be of a publique and active spirit, (though he be no Indepen∣dent or Separatist) he can never be friend to you in your work, and therefore you are to give him out, to be strongly suspected of whoredom, or drunkēnesse, prophanesse, an irreligious person, or an Atheist, and that by godly and religious persons, he was seen and heard blaspheming the holy Scriptures, and making a mock of the Ordinaces of Christ, or say he is suspected to hold inteligence with Oxford, or any thing no matter what, somewhat will be beleeved, you cannot be ignorant how much this hath prevailed a∣gainst divers able persons. If you see any such man but once talking with a Papist, or (though not) you may give out that very honest men suspect him to be a Jesuit: If any one but demand of you or any others, how you know the Scriptures to be the word of God, give it out for cer∣tain he denieth them, or if any put questions concerning God or Christ, or the Trinity, you have more then enough to lay accusations upon them, that shall stick by them as long as they live, if you will follow this my coun∣sell throughly saith Machivel (as in part you have done) you cannot faile of your end, you can never want matter, you shall (amongest
hose you deceive) be taken for a most zea∣ous, holy, and religious man, you may write book upon book, great and large ones, and make good profit (or great re∣nowne) by them, and in after ages, be recor∣ded as a famous Author. Moreover if you prosecute this course, you may haply hereby not only hold your friends firme unto you, ready upon all occa∣sions to petition what you wold have them, or to doe any thing you shall require them, but you shall be sure to hold them for ever devided from your adversaries, in all things, they shall not regard any thing, though ne∣ver so just or good, if they see they have but a finger therein, nay if work wise∣ly, you need not dispaire of dividing your most powerfull adversaries amongst them∣selvs, doubts & jelousies being of great force: And you know it is an undoubted truth, a house divided within it selfe cannot stand. This is Machivels way; and this hath been Mr. Edwards his way; and in this way hee goeth on, but the way of God have they not knowne, or rather have they not despised the way of the Lord. This is the Poyson by which he hath en∣venomed the hearts and understandings of thousands in themselves) honest, religious
people, too too easily misse-led, for want of knowledge or consideration of these Machi∣velian courses; men that being sinceare in their owne intentions, are easily deluded by the least pretence of zeal and godlinesse. And however his heart may be hardned that he will not regard any thing, that hath been written unto him; you that have been deceived by him, are not so farre gone but you may yet recover, & become untainted, with the least savour of his spirit, and in time abominate his waies: But surely then you must consider things more seriously then hitherto you have done, you must suspect your owne waies, and compare them once more with the waies of God, commended to you in his ho∣ly Word; That is the only Antidote that is able to expell the Poyson you have taken, or shall be offered in his next book; you know the word of God is mighty to the ca∣sting down of strong holds, & to bring in∣to subjection all Machivelian Imaginations. I shall therefore pray you in reading his next book which (it is to be feared) is reser∣ved for an accursed purpose, and to second some worke of Darknesse; that you will with open eyes see how farre, and how plau∣fible Machivel may go with colours of reli∣gion
transforming himselfe into an An∣gell of light. Also that you will not hastily give credit to any thing spoken by him a professed ad∣versary, lest in so doing, you become guilty of bearing false witnesse against your neigh∣bour. That you will consider and marke those that cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them: Rom. 16. 17. That you will mind a speciall part of that doctrine to be expressed in the fourteenth Chapter thorow-out, and the beginning of the fifteenth, which I entreat you to reade without prejudice or preoccupation of judg∣ment; and then I cannot doubt, but liberty of conscience will appeare more just in your eyes, then it hath done, and confesse that your selves cannot live without it. That you will lay to heart how dangerous it may prove to the Common wealth, and to the cause you have hitherto joyntly main∣tained, (God prospering you in so doing) if by any policies you should stand divided from those your brethren of other judge∣ments; beleeve it, the hand of Joab is in all your divisions, what-ever you see or judge, your common enemy, is the fomenter of
them; and under what notion or colours so∣ever they appeare, they are a common ene∣mie to you both, that labour to divide you, and in the end, you will find it to be so to your cost, if not to your ruine. An ancient Philosopher (somewhat to this purpose) hath a fable, That the Wolves being at long and deadly war with the sheep, and not prevailing by force; but contrary to their expectation almost vanquished: Resol∣ved to try what they could doe by policie, and thereupon desired a treaty, which the sheep simply and easily granted: The prin∣cipall simply and easily granted: The prin∣cipall thing in the treaty, which the Wolves insisted on, was, that the sheepe would but discharge & send away their dogs, and then there would be no cause of warre at all, but they should live quietly one by another, urging withall, that the dogs were of a quar∣relsome disposition, had been the beginners and continuers of the war, that they were of a different nature & temper from the sheep, maintain'd the war only for their own ends, and in probability were like enough to make a prey of the sheep themselves, and the like; if they would discharge them, they would give them what security themselves would desire, for assurance of their peaceable neigh∣bour-hood. The poor sheep soon weary of
the charge and trouble of war▪ yeelded ther∣unto, and discharged their dogges, their strongest help, (whereby they had not only preserved themselves, but by many battels and maine force had even quite vanquished the Wolves) wch was no sooner done, but the Wolves in short time muster up their force, (the dogs being out of call) and when the sheep least suspected, fell upon them and destroyed them utterly. I conceive this could never have been ef∣fected, but that the Wolves had conveyed some of themselves into sheepes cloathing, who by flattering and dissembling cariage, got themselves into credit with the sheeps, and so perswaded to this goodly treaty, and wrought them to those destructive condi∣tions. And (if well considered) this fable (though dogs and Christians hold no fit comparison) may demonstrate, that whosoever doth, or shall endevour to perswade the godly and honest Presbyters to abandon, discourage or molest their faithfull, helpfull, valiant and assured friends of other judgements (whom Mr. Edwards would have to be used worse then dogs) they are at best, but Wolves, or Wolves friends, and seek the destruction of all honest people, of what judgement soever.
And whether. Master Edwards do expresly ayme at so horrid an issue, or not; for cer∣taine, his workes and endevours do mainly tend thereunto, and will help on the wicked purposes of any that intend the destruction of the sheepe. But, blessed be God, we are not as sheepe without a shepherd, wee have had, and still have faithfull & resolved shepherds set over us by providence, in a most just and orderly way, a Parliament (the terror of the wicked, and cōfort of the just) that for these 5. years and upwards, have been a strong Tower of defence to the sheep of the Lords Pasture, to all the godly party in the Land: and though many of our froward and weak sheepe have many times been tampring & harkening af∣ter offers and conditions as dangerous to the whole flocke, as the discharging of that strength, the Wolves most feared; yet hath the wisdom of those our faithfull Shepherds hitherto prevented the same; and according to the true rules of wisdom have made most use of those whom the Wolves most feared. And we trust the same God that endowed them with such a new modelising wisdome, as hath been successefull to the astonishment both of their friends and enemies, will still guide and direct them, when the policies of
the enemies, are most busie and strongly working; and when the weaknesse and fro∣wardnesse of their friends are most trouble∣some & importunate for destructive things, yea though some should be wrought upon so farre, as to shew a wearisomnesse of these their Shepherds; the same God will then we doubt not, shew his mighty power and wis∣dome in them, and thereby preserve this whole Nation, from a most dangerous Re∣laps, which otherwise were to be feared: The whole flock is their charge, God hath made them Overseers of the whole, and to our joy and comfort they have hitherto shewed, agreater care to preserve the whole People, then to please any part of them; in unreasonable things: and in so do∣ing they have been (and cannot but be) bles∣sed and prosperous: And notwithstanding Mr. Edwards his verlomous poyson, blowne abroad by his unhappy quill, to blast and destroy the re∣pute of honest, religious, and faithfull men, yet (the tree being knowne by his fruite) the Parliaments wisdome expelleth his poyson and sheweth no disrepect to any honest re∣ligious person, and every juditious man fol∣loweth their worthy example therein: and when you that are weak and have been mis∣led,
and tainted with his poyson, shall con∣sider it, your judgments I trust will be recti∣fied, and strengthened so sufficiently, that you will no longer judge of men according to his malitious accusations, but according to their workes and what you see them doe: Which if you doe, wee shall have done with his poysonous, and scandalous bookes, which serve for nothing but to deceive and destroy the people; great quientnesse will fol∣low thereupon, and you will soone finde a nearer way to a finall end of your troubles, then the wrangling way he hath proposed, for if once you were united you would have no enemies; your warre would be at an end; your peace would be sure, and all the people safe and happy; Which is my only ayme in this work and my most earnest desire: WILLIAM WALWIN
A GRAINE MORE, And no more. OBserving by some passages and occur∣rences of late, that all the labour be∣stowed towards the conversion and reducing of Master Edwards into a truly, charitable, and Christian disposition, hath proved no other, then as the washing of a Blackamoore; and thereupon, daily expe∣cting a poysonous issue from his infectious braine. To prevent the mischiefe that might ensue: I prepared this little Antidote, inten∣ding to have had it in such a readinesse, as that it should have met his poyson in the in∣stant he first spread it, wherein I did my part, but the Printers mistake hindred it. Those therefore that have read his new Gangrenous and scandalous book, and doe find themselves any whit tainted with the poyson thereof, and have slept upon it: My friendly advise is, that they take double the quantity of this Antidote: that they reade this little Treatise twise over, and consider every part of it seriously and deliberately, and if they are any thing farre gone, and in
danger: then it will be necessary they adde thereunto a good quantity more of true Christian love, it will be somewhat hard to find, there being abundance every where of that which is counterfeit, the best of which will do more hurt then good; and therefore it will be needfull you get the help of some that by experience can distinguish the true from the false, and such a one I can assure you is also very hard to find: but without it there is no hope, and with it there is infallible certainty of recovery. If there were not much false and counter∣feit love abroad, this wretched man with all his cursed diligence could never have been furnished with matter to have sweld his poy∣sonous bulck to so vast a greatnesse. And truly had those whoever they are that gave those malicious informations con∣cerning me, as he reciteth them if they had had, but one scruple of true Christian love in them they never had administred to his (so unmanly) occasion. I blesse God, I have through diligent seek∣ing found this pretious liquor, and have e∣nough to spare upon those his unadvised in∣telligencers, and through the power thereof can freely forgive their evill intentions, which my conscience assures me, I never de∣served
from any, I ever conversed withall, or that ever knew me. As for himselfe, if passion and fore-judging did not blind mens understandings, and that most men are transported with flashy fan∣cies, and are unapt to consider things judici∣ously, it would evidently appeare, that he hath not in any measure auswered, either my Whisper or the Word more both which wil live in despite of his utmost venome, and will concerne him, and all such deceivers as he is, being there set forth in their truest colours, nor is his neglect of them, any o∣ther but a device to keep mens eyes off from reading or regarding them, wherein he hath indeed dealt very pollitiquely, and like one fully possest with a true Machivillian spirit, which more evidētly appeareth in laying his charge upon me in such subjects, as where∣in he knoweth the presses in these times are not admitted the lest measure of free∣dome, & if I should insist upon the mistakes, & nullities in the charge, I should be inforc'd to use the names of some persons, I much esteeme for that publique affection I have seen in them, and for the un-interupted friēdship I have had with them, which is no waies sutable to my spirit: insomuch as I
am yet unresolved what course to take, be∣sides, since it concernes only my particuler, and that of necessity it will occasion a bulk in print beyond my temper, the world being also opprest with books of particuler contest, I beleeve I shall incline to forbeare, though I am not certaine. As for those who know me, or throughly know him, with al those I shal remain unpre∣judiced in my repute, though he should have spet al hisvenome at once, and as for those that neither know him nor me, I shal (and I think may) safely trust my credit to the oper∣ation of my Antidote, & to the most pow∣erful additiō of true Christian love, wch were there need in this cause) would cover abun∣dance of evill: love is the balsome which in my Whisper I really commended to his use, but either he will not use it, or takes not that paynes to rub it in which I advised, but though I have cast my pearle amisse, and have sped accordingly; that shall not hinder or abate my esteem of so pretious a Iewell, it is the delight of life, and the joy of Heaven, and whilst I live I trust I shall live in love, and when I dye, that I shall dye in this love, and Rise and remain Eternally in love, that is in God (for God is love) in whose presence
there is fulnesse of joy; at whose wright hand there are pleasures for evermore; and full a∣mends for all reproches. WILLIAM WALWIN FINIS. IMPRIMATVR, IOHN BACHILER. May 26. 1646.
