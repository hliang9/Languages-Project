WHereas it hath of late been the En∣deavour of several Members of the Physicians Colledg, to reform the Abuses of the Apothecaries, as well in the Prizes as in the Composition of their Medecines▪ This is to give notice for the Publick Good, that a Superfine Sort of Jesuits Bark ready powder'd and paper'd into Doses with or without Di∣rections for the Use of it, is to be had at Dr. Charles Goodal's, at the Coach and Horses in Physicians Colledg in Warwick-Lane, at 4 s. per Ounce, or for a Quantity together at 3 l. per Pound; for the Reasonableness of which Prizes, (considering the Loss and Trouble in Powder∣ing) we appeal to all the Druggists and Apotheca∣ries themselves in Town, and particularly to Mr. Thair, Druggist in Newgate-street, to whom we paid full 9 s. per Pound for a considerable quantity for the Use of our self and our Friends. And for the Excellency and Efficacy of this par∣ticular Bark, enquire of Dr. Morton in Grey-Fryars. I am to be spoken with  Prayers at S. Sepulchres every day, but the Lord's Day, at Seven in the Morning, and at Home from Eight in the Morning till Ten at Night. The Poor may have Advice (that is, Nothing) for Nothing.
