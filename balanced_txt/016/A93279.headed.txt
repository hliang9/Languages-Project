GOING NAKED, A SIGNE. OH Church of England! This is unto thee, who livest in oppression and cruelty, pride and covetuousnesse; a day of misery is coming upon thee, thy nakedness and shame is coming upon thee as an armed Man, from which no man can hide thee, neither Hills nor Mountaines shall be able to hide thee in this the Day of the Lord, neither shall the Clefts of the Rocks preserve thee from the Day of the Lords Controversy with thee; Thy nakednesse and thy shame is near to come up∣on thee, from it thou shalt not fly: Oppression and cruelty hath been as a Staff for thee, but the Lord is risen to break thy Staff of oppression, and thou shalt be left naked though thou hast seemed to be the glory of the Nations with thy de∣ceitful Covers,, but now thou shalt be left naked, and Nations shall be ashamed of thee: Howl and weep ye Teachers, for the Lord is gathering his people from you, and ye shall devour his flock no more: The Day is coming upon you, that none shall buy your Wares any more ye Merchants of Babylon: All your scarlet colour the Lord our God is coming to take off: Then your nakednesse shall ap∣peare to many Nations, and you shall sit as a Widdow, and there shall be none to comfort you; Distresse and anguish shall take hold upon you, and pain as a Wo∣man in travel, and is not able to bring forth, so shall your misery come upon you: The Decree of the Lord is gone out against all unrighteousnesse, he will surely re∣ward every one according to their works, for as a Troop of Robbers lye in wait for a Man, so a company of Priests by consent lye in wait to murther the Innocent Lambs of God, and for their sakes the Lord is risen in his mighty power to break the bonds of wickednesse, and to set the oppressed free, for the Lord hath heard the groa∣ning of his seed, and he is risen to deliver to bring it out of Captivity, and from under the taskmasters, where his seed hath been long oppressed by unreasonable Men: But the Lord will spare no longer, but he will reward the Oppressors double into their bosomes, and his seed he will deliver. Oh howl and weep your day is far spent, Night is coming upon you that you shall not have a Vision, and nothing shall be left to cover you: As naked shall you be spiritually, as my body hath been temporally naked in many places in England, as a signe of the nakednesse▪ and shame that is coming upon the Church of England, who liveth in Oppression and cruelty, and all who lift up a weapon for her shall fall in the shame with her, which will surely come to passe; So all sober people consider your wayes, and turne to the light which comes from Jesus, that with it you may be gathered unto the Lord from the false Teachers to the teachings of the Lord, from the false worships to the worship of the Lord in spirit and in truth; For a necessity was laid upon me from the Lord God of Life and power to be a signe: But before I was given up to the thing, it was as death unto me, and I had rather, if it had been the Lords will, have dyed then gone on in this service; But when the word of the Lord came unto me saying, Go on and prosper, It was sweet unto me, as the honey, and the honey Comb. And blessed saith Christ are they that heares my word, and keeps it. William Simpson. LONDON, Printed for Robert Wilson, at the Black-Spread-Eagle, in Martins neer Aldersgate, 1660.
