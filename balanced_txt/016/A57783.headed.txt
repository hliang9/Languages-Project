THE STATUTES OF THE COLLEDGE OF Physicians LONDON: Worthy to be perused by all Men, But more Especially PHYSICIANS, LAWYERS, APOTHECARIES, SURGEONS, AND All such that either do, or shall Study, Profess, or Practise PHYSICK. ANNO DOMINI 1693.
To the PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND. MOST Renowned Assembly, whose Vigilancy and Care for the Publick Good, all Ages have sufficiently experienced, and in whose Determination the People of England, calmly, content∣edly, and conscienciously acquiesce; tho the corruptions and perversions of ill men have frequently subverted your most Generous Designs for the Publick Good, to their own base and private Interests; among the num∣ber of which, it were heartily to be wish'd that the most Noble and Ne∣cessary Art of Physick were not pro∣ituted and perverted (by men
strictly sworn to the contrary) to the avarice, pride, and oppression of a few, who not content private∣ly to enslave and abuse men, by ex∣acting Fourscore or a Hundred Pounds, for an Admission, with∣out any Examination; but open∣ly enact By-Laws, contrary to Act of Parliament and the Cam∣mon Good of Mankind, pre∣cluding (without any respect of their Due and Legal Qualificati∣ons, and Abilities) particular men from being serviceable to the Pub∣lick; as will plainly appear to those who shall attentively examine the following Case, and Statutes. The prudent and seasonable redress of which Enormities, most Worthy Patriots, when time and opportu∣nity shall present, is humbly sub∣mitted to your Determination and Judgement.
The Base, Dishonourable, and Ille∣gal Dealing of the Colledge of Physicians, London, with a Doctor in Physick, admitted to that Degree in one of our own Ʋniversities; WHo in July, August, and Sep∣tember, in the year 1683, pre∣sented himself to the President and Censors, to be examined; Doctor Tho∣nas Coxe President, Samuel Collins, Senior Register, Walter Charleton, Thomas Allen, Nathaniel Hodges, Ed∣ward Hulst, Censors: and was by them examined (Chap. 15. pag. 112.) three se∣veral times in Latine, according to the Form of the Statutes (Chap. 16. pag. 119, 120, 123.) in that Case provi∣ded; and was approved (Chap. 15. pag. 111.) and had leave given by the Pre∣sident
and Censors, after Examination (Chap. 16. pag. 124.) to visit the Fel∣lows, and did accordingly visit all the Fellows, in order to be admitted Li∣centiate (Chap. 11. pag. 79, 80.) and at the same time was requested and de∣sired by them, in the behalf of the whole Colledge; and withal comple∣mented, how extreamly he should ob∣lidge and highly honour that Society, if he would be pleased to suspend his Admission of Licentiate (and which they confest they could not deny) till such time as he had quitted his Imployment in Pharmacy, and com∣pleated his Degree (being then Batche∣lour in Physick) of Doctor in the Uni∣versity; and that then, without any farther trouble of visiting the Fellows, or other Examinations, and for the very same Fees, by vertue of those Examinations standing registred in their Books (if they escape the fate of being cut out, as some other things have been) he might be admitted Can∣didate, the more honourable station in
their Society, and which he better de∣served, and they did then propose to him Doctor Lister's Case, as a Presi∣dent for the same thing: On these Considerations he submitted to and gratified their Request. Four years now elapsed, and by their advice, having regularly com∣pleated his Degree of Doctor in Phy∣sick (July 6. 1687.) performing all Ex∣ercises required by the Statutes of the University of Cambridge (and as 14, 15 of Hen. 8. accomplishing all things for his Form, without any grace) as his Di∣ploma to them shewn, and the Regi∣ster in that University will sufficiently testifie; he applied himself to the then President of the Colledge in the year 1687, for his Admission (as formerly directed and promised, by the Presi∣dent and Censors, in the behalf of the whole Colledge in the year 1683.) from whom he had a courteous recep∣tion, and acknowledgement that it was all the Reason and Justice in the World that he should have his Admission, be∣sides,
saith he, we cannot deny it him; (Chap. 15. p. 119. l. 8.) and then advi∣sed him to wait till next Colledge day, and there give his attendance; which he accordingly did, and was then de∣ferred to another opportunity, by rea∣son the Colledge was then ingaged in private business (viz. Making New Sta∣tutes (N. 8, 16.) of Exclusion) and no publick business would at that time be entred on; he attended again and again, and was still deferred: During these delays the private business is ef∣fected, and the New Statutes of Ex∣clusion are made and promulgated in the Theatre, September 28. 1687. After these New Statutes were made, he was advised to wait on the President and Censors on a private Colledge day, to demand his Admis∣sion, and did accordingly; and had for answer from them their New Sta∣tutes, which Mr. Register would needs read: To which he answered, These Statutes cannot relate to my Case, be∣ing made above four years since the
desires, requests, and directions of this Board, in behalf of the whole Colledge, were made to me to suspend my Ad∣mission till I had compleated my De∣gree of Doctor; besides, I have lately attended several times on the Colledge for my Admission in July, August, Sep∣tember 1687. since I was Doctor in Physick, and before these Statutes were made or promulgated. However, so it was, that unless he would abjure the Company of Apo∣thecaries (as well as he had, by their ad∣vice and directions, quitted his imploy∣ment in Pharmacy in the year 1684.) and bring it attested under the hand, or by the person of a Publick Notary, that he had relinquish'd & abjured that Society, he should not be admitted. And now, for the further illustration of their Honour, Justice, and Credit, in this Case, I will give you an Advertisement publish'd by the Colledge of Physicians London, in the Gazette; as also what they have an∣nexed to his most Sacred Majesties Let∣ters,
and publish'd by the consent of the whole Colledge in 1688. Gazette N. 2325. Thursday 1 March 1687. WHereas there are in and about this City several Persons practi∣sing Physick, who have not yet been exa∣mined and licensed by the President and Censors of the Colledge of Physicians, these are to require all such persons forth∣with to repair to the said President and Censors, for their Examination and Li∣cence to practise, that they may hereby prevent their being prosecuted according to the Laws and his Majesties special Command.
'A short Account of the Institution and Nature of the Colledge of Physicians London. Published 1688. THe Colledge of Physicians in London, being constituted of men of generous and liberal Educa∣tion, and instituted for publick be∣nefit, out of which no person of suf∣ficient Capacity and Learning can be excluded, consists of a President, Fel∣lows, Candidates, Honorary Fellows, and Licentiates. 1. Fellows are Doctors of Physick chosen out of the Candidates, who have been always limited to a certain number (formerly Forty) and are now confined to the number of Four∣score, by his present Majesties graci∣ous Charter.
2. Candidates must be Doctors in Physick, admitted to that Degree in one of our own Universities, must not be Foreigners, and ought to have practised Physick four years before they are admitted into that Order. 3. Honorary Fellows are such Do∣ctors in Physick, as by reason of their being Foreigners, or having taken their Degree in some University be∣yond the Seas, are not incorporated into either of ours; or for some other reason (having not been Candidates) are not of the number of those who have Votes in the Affairs of the Col∣ledge. The Reader will find no such Rank or Degree instituted either in the Old or New Statutes, but was at first ho∣nestly and justly dispensed with about the year 1660, for those who thorow the iniquity of the times, were forced from the Universities, and so could not orderly take their Degrees at
home; but were compelled to take them abroad in Foreign Universities, and were therefore numbred among the Honoraries (Chap. 12. p. 91, 92.) viz. the Kings, Queens, and Princes Physicians; that so they might be re∣stored to their Seniority and Standing: but have since been continued and perverted to the detriment of our U∣niversities, and the scandal of the Col∣ledge, by admitting all foreign De∣grees, or any else (without Examinati∣on for money, 80 or 100 l.) into an Or∣der, which the Statutes have not or∣dained. 4. Licentiates, are such other per∣sons skilled in Physick, who by rea∣son of their being Foreigners, or their not being admitted Doctors in one of our Universities, or for their not being eminently learned, or by reason of their too great youth, or such like causes, are not capable to be elected into the number of the Candidates, yet may notwith∣standing be serviceable to the Pub∣lick
in taking care of the health of the Kings Subjects, at least in some particular Diseases. The Act of Parliament makes no such Distinctions, save the Eight Elects, but that all shall be one Body and Fel∣lowship; as in Anno 14, 15. Hen. 8. Cap. 5 saith, Have incorporate and made of Us, and of our Company afore∣said, one Body and perpetual Commi∣nalty or Fellowship of the Faculty of Physick, and to have perpetual Suc∣cession and Common Seal: And further Quod nemo in dicta Civitate, aut per septem milliaria in circuitn ejusdem, ex∣erceat dictam Facultatem, nisi ad hoc per dictum Praesidentem & Communita∣tem, seu Successores eorum, qui pro tem∣pore fuerint, admissus sit per ejusdem Praesidentis & Collegii Literas Sigillo suo Communi Sigillatas. Now, of all these several Ranks and Degrees of Practisers in Physick, none of them is confined to any certain num∣ber,
but the Fellows and Candidates; (but not according to the Act of Par∣liament) so that the rest being wholly unlimited, no person can be excluded out of the Colledge, or debarred from Practice, but such as are so wholly il∣literate and unskilful, that they dare not adventure to submit themselves to the Examination and Judgement of the President and Censors of the Colledge, either as to the goodness of their Medicines, or their own skill in all or any part of Physick, though the President and Censors be men strictly sworn to do Justice to all per∣sons who shall present themselves or their Medicines to their Scrutiny and Examination. From hence it menisestly follows that the Colledge of Physicians is ve∣ry far from being a Monopoly, since it cannot reject any of the King's Sub∣jects who are duly qualified for the Exercise of all, or any part of Physick.
From all these published Advertise∣ments and following Statutes, it ma∣nifestly follows that Doctor I.Bgr. is and has been legally and duly a Member of the Colledge of Physicians London for these Ten years last past, although his Name be not printed in their New Ca∣talogue of 1693. (which Catalogue, if examined by the Registers of our Universities, you will find many of those Doctors Names either there not registred, or many that have been im∣posed on the Universities; which will be well worth publishing in their next Impression for the publick good and informati∣on;) Or the Colledge guilty of publishing to the World most notorious falshoods: and to use their own words, is very far from being any other then a perfect Monopoly (Pag. 119. exacting large Subscriptions of our University men, besides their pretended Fees, and admit∣ting any for Fourscore or a Hundred Pounds, without Examination first had Pag. 116. l. 1.) and Confederacy, to support Ignorance (Pag. 83. l. 16, 20. P. 148. l. 7. P. 151. l. 18. P. 159. l. 1. P. 160. l. 17. New Stat. N. 2, 10. and exclude regularly commenced Doctors in our own U∣niversities; and the King's Native Subjects, duly qualified for the Exercise of all and eve∣ry part of Physick.
STATUTA COLLEGII MEDICORUM LONDINENSIƲM.
QUum Regis Serenissimi HEN∣RICI VIII. Privatà gra∣tià, & Publicis Parliamenti Decretis sancitum sit, ut Col∣legium Medicorum Londinensium in decus Regni, & salutem Reipublicae stabiliatur, Privilegiis muniatur, Pos∣sessionibus locupletetur, Electoribus insigniatur, Praeside, & Censoribus gubernetur, Statutis dirigatur illaque de novo condendi facultate donetur; Consiliariis adjuvetur, & Literis per∣petuetur; Consultissimum etiam No∣bis visum est ut praescribamus: Primo qui sint futuri Electores; quodque eorum sit Officium, Tum quis sit futurus Praeses; quomodo, & a qui∣bus eligendus; quâ Lege obstrin∣gendus; quodnam ejus Officium, & potestas: denique quis locus, atque dignitas: Deinde, quinam sint fu∣turi Consiliarii, quid illis fide datâ sit praestand um quodque eorum sit
Officium, Locus, & Potestas: Qui Censores Literarum, Morum, item∣que Medicamentorum sint constituen∣di; quoque Officio, ex Juramento, illis sit fungendum. Quodnam sit Officium Thesaurarii, Regestarii, & Bedelli. Postremò, quid reliquos deceat in sui honorem & Collegii decus, & quâ sponsione teneantur. Si quae Statuta condenda, si quae abroganda fuerint, quo id facere opporteat modo. Quae sit Commi∣tiorum, examinationum, atque ad∣missionum forma. Quae sit Offensae habenda ratio: cum aliis, quae uni∣versim ad omnes Collegii personas & negotia ex aequo spectant. Enim verò nihil durabile est, quod Rati∣one, Modo, atque Ordine careat.
CAP. I. De Electoribus Creandis. STatuimus igitur & Ordinamus ut è Numero Sociorum Octo tantùm Electores creentur, qui gravitate, li∣teris, moribus, & aetate caeteris praeful∣geant, Doctoratûs{que} gradu insigniantur, & natione sint Angli, quorum Offici∣um erit ex Authoritate Collegii po∣stridiè Divi Michaelis (si commodèfi∣eri potest, at verò si ob gravia quae∣dam impedimenta id non licebit; tunc alio die ad eam rem magis idoneo modò sit intra septimanam à tem∣pore Praestituto) in celebribus Comi∣tiis Praesidem è numero Electorum eli∣gere: si anni superioris Praeses defuncto annuo Officio superfuerit, sin autem defecerit ille quam primum id com∣modè fieri poterit alium surrogare, ad plurimum intra dies 20 post quam is defecerit. Deficere autem Praesidem
vel Electorem intelligimus, si vel mortuus fuerit, vel è Collegio sit ex∣pulsus, vel cum pannis, ut aiunt, a Ci∣vitate discesserit, & per annum inte∣grum absuerit, nisi sit in Ministerio Principis. Si Electorum unus aut plures ita defecerint Electione novâ sufficiatur alius aut plures in ejus aut eorum locum ex caeteris Sociis qui ejusdem Nationis, Gradus, Morum, Doctri∣nae, atque Ordinis erunt, intra dies 30 aut saltem 40; sed ita ut illis Comitiis soli Electores intersint, quò liberior fiat Electio, & morum, in∣genii, gravitatis ac Doctrinae justior examinatio, quas omnes Virtules in Electore vel maxime requirunt Statu∣ta Regni. Qui eligendus est, priùs examina∣bitur ab Electoribus prout cautum est per Statuta Regni, tum eligatur omni∣um corum consensu; si fieri poterit sin minus per majorem partem, at si pa∣ria
fuerint Suffragia per seniorem par∣tem. Si autem propter Pestis saevitiam vel aliam ob causam Electores abfu∣erint ab Urbe, ita ut certus dies sta∣tui nequeat, tunc licebit Praesidi quô tempore & loco commodè poterit E∣lectores convocare. Si quis ex numero Electorum Civi∣tatem reliquirit & cum familiâ suâ in alio aliquo loco ultra septem ab Ur∣be Milliaria per annum integrum commoratus fuerit, is (nisi sit Medicus Regius aut aliter Principis Ministerio detentus) inter Electores locum amit∣tet, aliusque per Praesidem & Electo∣res surrogabitur: Volumus tamen ut suum in Collegio locum & dig∣nitatem retineat, si intereà temporis Praesidem de Absentiae suae causâ cer∣tiorem fecerit. Dabit sidem se nemini daturum con∣sensum aut suffragium ut Praeses aut Elector creetur nisi secundùm formam Statuti & nisi ejus gravitatem, erudi∣tionem, mores integros, aetatem de∣centem,
sincerum animum in Colle∣gium & Rempublicam & alacritatem ad obeunda Officia cognitam & per∣spectam habuerit. CAP. II. De Praside & ejus Officio. QUi Praeses futurus est in annum designetur, sitque è numero Ele∣ctorum, & quem caeteri Ele∣ctores praesentes, aut omnes aut plu∣rimi pro temporis rei & personae rati∣one idoneum judicaverint idque eò anni tempore fiat, quò jam ante Con∣stitutum est, cum de Electoribus a∣geremus postridiè nempe Divi Micha∣elis si commodè fieri potest, &c. ut suprà in Capite de Electoribus creandis. Cautum & Statutum est si paria fuerint Suffragia, ea pars vineat in quà plures ex senioribus fuerint, quod si hi quo{que} pares suerint ea praevalebit in quam vetus Praeses aut eo mortuo
vel absente Praeses natus inclinaverit, Praesidem natum vocamus qui senior ex Electoribus fuerit, qui etsi Praesi∣dis nomen gerat nullam tamen pote∣statem habeat condendi aut mutandi Statuta, administrandi vero, fungendi∣ve Praesidis munere caeteris in rebus ad Collegii negotia pertinentibus, sit ei plena potestas secundùm verum sensum Statutorum. Si Elector aliquis, Praesidis munns ei delatum recusaverit, mulctabitur 40 solidis nisi fuerit Medicus Re∣gius. Sponsio sive Fides à Praeside data. DAblt fidem fe pro viribus co∣naturum, ut honor Collegii conservetur, Statuta ejusdem sine fraude observentur, omniaque actu∣rum in salutem Rei Publicae, & Ho∣nestam Collegii utilitatem.
Fidem a Praeside novo postulabit superioris anni Praeses si adfuerit, aut Consiliariorum alter, Senior potissimum si adfuerit, aut his absentibus Senior ex Electoribus praesentibus. Qui fidem postulabit is porrigat Virtutis Insignia Pulvinar nempe ho∣noris, Librum, & Caduceum dicat∣que, Damus tibi Praesidis Authorita∣tem tradimusque Pulvinar Honoris, Librum Scientiae & Caduceum Gu∣bernationis & Prudentiae ut intelli∣gat excellentia tua caeterique Colle∣gae omnes Scientiâ & Prudentiâ Collegium nostrum firmiter stabiliri quamobrem ne id memoriâ tuâ exci∣dat in solemnioribus Conventibus Of∣ficiis funebribus aliisque temporibus & locis opportunis curabis gestari ante te per Bedellum, Librum & Cadu∣ceum in Scientiae & Prudentiae Sig∣num ut quod virtus postulat id usus confirmet.
Ratio Deponendi Officium. DEfuncto Praesidendi Officio, mu∣nus depositurus Praeses finitâ quam velit praefatione dicat. Depo∣no Praesidendi authoritatem inque tu∣as manus alterius; viz. Consiliario∣rum Senioris potissimum aut his ab∣sentibus Senioris Electoris praesentis omnium nomine restituo, ut integrum sit quibus eligendi potestas est quem velint eligere & substituere; reddo tibi igitur pulvinar honoris, Librum Scientiae & Caduceum prudentis regi∣minis, praecorque Collegio & vobis omnibus omnia fausta. Quo facto cui deligata potestas est proponat eligendum quem ad id Of∣ficium maxime idoneum fore judicave∣rint. Eligatur autem eo modo quo sub initium hujus Capitis ordinatum est, & eum qui pro Statutorum ratione Electus est clare & nominatim pro∣nuntiet
electum in Praesidem jubeat∣que ut omnes eum pro Praeside ha∣beant, denique fidem ab eo postula∣bit eadem formula qua supra dictum est. Praesidis Officium esto ut Comitia indicat, qua autem ratione postea di∣cetur cum de Comitiis statuimus, tum ut causas Comitiorum proponet, singulorum sententias excipiat, pro ma∣jori parte discernat, factiones & parti∣um studia excludat. Electores, Consiliarios, literarum, morum, & medicamentorum Censores, cum caeteris, quorum ea res intererit eligat. In Collegis eligendis, aliorum Suf∣fragia primum accipiat, dein suum ferat, & pro majori parte descernat. Lites inter Collegas dirimat sed id communi consilio & sententia Ele∣ctorum & Censorum seorsim adhibi∣torum; eoque modo, quo postea in Capite de Consiliariis dicetur plenius.
Curet praeterea, ut Sigillum com∣mune in Arcâ tutò custodiatur: Om∣nia ipse obsignabit, in quae reliqui So∣cii pro Officio & Statuto consense∣rint. Si qui Libri Collegio donentur, cura∣bit, ut reponentur, in Bibliothecâ, & exacto anno eorum ratio redda∣tur novo Praesidi, ostendantur{que} ei no∣minatim ex Indice. Si quis sit reditus, sive fructus an∣nuus ex fundis Collegii, si quid do∣netur Collegio, si quid aliis nomini∣bus accedat, procuret ut in Commu∣ni Arcâ conservetur cujus ipse cla∣vem unam, Consiliariorum singuli itidem unam habeant. Rationem etiam acceptorum & ex∣pensorum anni superioris exigat à Thesaurario, caeterisque Officiariis Collegii, in praesentia reliquorum E∣lectorum tunc temporis in Urbe pre∣sentium, quos omnes admoneri vo∣lumus, ut putandis rationibus prae∣stò sint, si modo commodè poterint;
Imprimis autem videat, ut Statuta diligenter observentur, & in Colle∣gio legantur, vel ab ipso, vel à Re∣gistario, vel ab alio aliquo prout illi videbitur, eo nimirum modo, quò posteà in Statutis provisum & con∣stitutum est. CAP. III. De Pro-Praeside. LIcebit Praesidi, vel Ministerio Pincipis, vel magnatis alicujus curâ detento, vel multitudine alio∣rum negotiorum oppresso, Pro-Praesi∣dem eligere, & sibi substituere; is vero Praeses natus sit, si commode per aetatem, negotia, aut valetudinem fi∣eri potest; sin minus ex Electoribus aliquis, qui gravitate, recto judicio, experientiâ, diligentiâ, & agendi ala∣critate polleat, pro Praesidis volunta∣te & arbitrio.
Hujus Officjum erit, supplere lo∣cum Praesidis absentis in omnibus Col∣legii negotiis gerendis, & admini∣strandis, quae commodè per Praesidem obiri nequeant. Sit ei Locus, & Dignitas pro gra∣du & senioritate, nisi cum Praeses ab∣fuerit; tum enim Praesidis locum oc∣cupabit, sed in Collegio tantùm, loco nimirum Comitiorum ordinario; ab∣esse autem Praesidem intelligimus, non modò si extra Urbem, & Subur∣bia fuerit, sed etiam, si morbo ali∣quo, aut gravioribus negotiis in Ur∣be detentus adesse nequeat. Sed in his casibus, volumus, ut absentiam su∣am, vel per literas propriâ manu sub∣scriptas, vel per Collegii Bedellum notum faciat. Duret Officium pro negotio. Da∣bit fidem si Electores aequum judica∣verint, se pro virili curaturum ne∣gotia Collegii sibi commissa, & se∣dulò acturum omnia in honorem & u∣tilitatem Collegii, nihilque facturum, nisi judicio & consilio Praesidis, aut
consiliariorum, eorumque Sociorum, quorum per Statuta intererit. CAP. IV. De Consiliariis. POstridie Divi Michaelis si com∣modè fieri potest, &c. ut suprà in Capite de Electoribus creandis, in Comitiis ordinariis, statim à Praesidis Electione iidem Electores ex suo or∣dine duos qui ad Officium hoc ido∣nei fuerint in Consiliarios eligant, assentientibus, vel omnibus vel ma∣jori Electorum Presentium numero; si paria fuerint suffragia, ea pars prevalebit, in qua plures fuerint ex Senioribus; si hi quoque numero pa∣res fuerint, tum ea, in quam Prae∣ses propenderit.
Dabunt fidem se probè, & aequè, ut viros bonos decet, se posito om∣ni affectu, officio suo functuros. Horum officium esto, Praesidi sem∣per in Comitiis majoribus adesse; e∣undem operâ, & consilio ubi opus fu∣erit, juvare, nunquam abesse, nisi gravis aliqua causa cogat; & ne tunc temporis locus vacet, qui abfuerit substituet loco suo alium Electorem, donec redierit cum consensu tamen Praesidis, aut eo absente, Pro-Praesi∣dis. Si quae lis aut controversia de re ambiguâ, aut genuinâ interpretatio∣ne alicujus Statuti, aut hujusmodi a∣liquod dissidium, inter Collegas ori∣atur, totum id negotium volumus quietè placidèque componi per Praesi∣dem, Consiliarios, Censores, aut per majorem eorum partem. Similiter, si inter Praesidem, & Col∣legas, controversia aliqua orta fuerit, rem totam decerni volumus per Con∣siliarios, & Censores, vel per majo∣rem
illorum partem. At si ne sic quidem componi potest, tunc volu∣mus illis arbitris praedictis, reliquos e∣tiam Electores adjungi; ut horum om∣nium, vel majoris partis suffragiis, tota illa controversia dirimatur. Atque hanc regulam observari vo∣lumus, in omnibus Collegarum rixa∣tionibus decentèr compescendis. Hâc nempe ratione futurum speramus (quod maximè optandum est) ut rix∣osa jurgia, ac contentiones evitentur: & fraternus amor, cum suavianimorum & voluntatum consensu quotidie coa∣alescat, ac in perpetuum confirmetut. Si Consiliariorum alter aut moria∣tur, aut aliter defecerit antequam annum expleverit, alius intra dies quindecim surrogetur. Nemo recuset Officium Consiliarii sub poena quadraginta solidorum, ni∣si sit Medicus Regius. Quoties corum consilium Praeses rogaverit, paratos se praestent; sin minus solvant singuli tres solidos & quatuor denarios, nisi urgens aliqua
causa impedierit de qua, cùm proxi∣mè redierint, Praesidem certiorem sa∣cient. CAP. V. De Censoribus. POst Electum Praesidem, & Con∣siliarios, mox in iisdem Comitiis, statuimus & ordinamus ut singulis an∣nis quatuor Viri docti & graves eli∣gantur: sive ii Electores fuerint, si∣ve Socii: Quos Censores Collegii Lon∣dinensis, sive Gubernatores nominari volumus. Horum Electio sit per Suffragia Praesidis & totius Societatis aut ma∣joris partis occultè accepta. Horum Officium esto, de omnibus Medicinam exercentibus cognoscere, sive nostrates fuerint, sive advenae; per Urbem Suburbia, & intra septem milliaria in ambitu eorundem. Eos examinare, corrigere, gubernare, &
lite (si opus sit) una cum Praeside & Thesaurario, persequi: eorum me∣dendi rationes inquirere, medica∣menta judicio perstringere, Pharma∣copolarum Officinas scrutari, de Phar∣macis judicare, vitiosa comburere, aut alio pacto destruere: si Pharma∣copolae obstiterint, ad Praesidem & Collegium rem referre: omniaque haec in salutem Reipublicae & Collegii honorem agere. Censorum Juramentum. JUrabunt coram Praeside, Se nemi∣nem in Collegium admittendum decreturos, nisi quem omni sepositô aflectu, judicaverint & literis & mo∣ribus idoneum: Nec prece, nec pretio, vel gratiâ, aut quemquam hominem, aut quidquam Medicamentorum ap∣probaturos; inque caeteris suo Officio probè functuros: sicut eos Deus ad∣juvet, & sancta Dei Evangelia.
Nullus Socius recuset Officium Cen∣soris, sub poenâ quadraginta solido∣rum, nisi sit Medicus Regius. CAP. VI. De Comitiorum ratione atque tempore & de Caduceatore sive Bedello. TRiduò antequam futura sunt Conmitia solennia, aut pridie ejus diei, si res urgeat; auctoritate Praesidis monendi sunt omnes Collegae per Bedellum, aut Praesidis ministrum, ut intersint Comitiis futuris die, ho∣râ, & locô praescriptis. Quo ubi ventum est, sedeant sin∣guli eô ordine quô postea dicetur. Comitia vocamus, conventus; sive ut Rex Henricus in suo Diplomate nomi∣nat,
congregationes Collegarum; & ea Comitia solennia, sive majora le∣gitima judicamus, quibus ut inter∣sint, omnes Collegae, in Urbe per Bedellum admonentur: & in quibus duodecim Socii, ad minimùm, adsunt praeter Praesidem. Modus autem ad∣monitionis talis esto, Dominus Prae∣ses orat Excellentiam vestram (Doctor eximie) ut Comitiis intersis, mense, die horâ & loco à Praeside praescrip∣tis. Subscribat dein ad hunc modum A. V. B. i. e. authoritate vestrâ Be∣dellus. Sit Bedellus vir probus, detque fidem, se fidelitèr & sedulò inservi∣turum Praesidi & Collegio, in omni∣bus Collegii negotiis, sine fuco aut fraude. Promittat insuper, se nec pre∣tiô, nec prece, nec gratiâ, secreta Collegii cuiquam vulgaturum. Hujus Officium esto, Schedulas ad∣monitionis scribere; Collegas omnes ad Comitia accerscere in eorum ad∣ventum
omnia parare, munda, polita∣que conservare, à Comitiis non abesse: res in Collegii usum à Praeside accep∣tas fideliter ferre, & referre; quos∣cunque sive Medicos; sive Empiricos, & Impostores indagare, eorumque nomina Praesidi & Censoribus indica∣re: atque illis, jubente Praeside aut Censoribus, diem indicere; improba Pharmaca comburere, aut aliter de∣struere, Convivils, & Funeribus ad∣esse, Virtutis Insignia gestare, & cae∣tera peragere, quae ministro ex Offi∣cio incumbunt. Bedello stipendium duodecim li∣brarum à Thesaurario annuatim sol∣vetur. Volumus etiam, ut à singulis Can∣didatis & Permissis quatuor solidi quotannis pro mercede ipsi erogen∣tur; in omnibus praeterea admissioni∣bus, & mulctis quae viginti solidos excedunt; & Anatomiis, tres solidi & quatuor denarii illi persolventur.
De Collegis admonendis ad Comitia. STatuimus, ut Collegae omnes, qui in Urbe, aut Suburbiis fuerint, singulis Comitiis majoribus, sive or∣dinariis, sive extraordinariis intersint; nisi grave aliquod impedimentum ob∣stiterit. Quod ad minores illas Con∣gregationes attinet, quae singulis men∣sibus, aliisque temporibus habentur; liberum erit caeteris Collegis (praeter sex illos, quos postea in Cap. de Tem∣poribus ordinariis Comitiorum, nomi∣nabimus) vel adesse, vel abesse, pro arbitrio; nisi Praesidis aut Pro-Praesi∣dis monitu adesse jubeantur. Quod si quis praemonitus per Be∣dellum ipsum, vel per Schedulam ab eô domi suae relictam non accesserit; solvet in usus Collegii duos solidos nisi per valetudinem excusatus fuerit, aut absuerit ab Urbe duobus ad mini∣mùm miliaribus.
Qui abfuerit à Comitiis eô die quô Praeses & Censores eligendi sunt, nisi gravem ob causam à Praeside, aut Pro-Praeside, aut Consiliariis, & Cen∣soribus approbandam, solvet in usum Collegii tres solidos & quatuor de∣narios. Imò solidum solvet, qui ante Auditam tertiam non accesserit. Quoniam autem complures legiti∣mè à Praeside per Bedellum admoni∣ti, Comitiis praedictis interesse vel negligunt, vel aspernantur; quo fit ut saepe irriti fiant Conventus; reli∣quique Socii, Praesidis monitis obtem∣perantes, frustra negotia sua privata negligunt; propterea statuimus & or∣dinamus, ut, si qùis Socius praedicto modô admonitus, ad stata Comitia majora accedere recusaverit, quater∣que hoc pacto continuò deliquerit, nec interea temporis absentiae suae cau∣sam Praesidi aut Pro-Praesidi cum Con∣siliariis & Censoribus approbandam reddiderit; alius (quam primum) commodum videbitur Collegio) in ejusdem locum sufficiatur.
Omnia Statuta in tres partes sive sectiones dividantur; prima pars ea omnia comprehendet, quae pertin ent ad Electores, ad Praesidem, & Pro-Praesidem, ad Consiliarios, ad Censo∣res, ad Comitia, aliaque donec ven∣tum sit ad Caput Nonum, quod tra∣ctat de Officio Thesaurarii. Secunda pars complectetur ea Sta∣tuta, quae pertinent ad Thesaurarium, & Registrarium, ad numerum Socio∣rum & Candidatorum, ad eorundem Examinationes, Electiones, & Admis∣siones ad Permissorum Ordinem, & Officia; & reliqua, usque ad Caput Vicessimum secundum quod agit de Statutis Poenalibus sive Moralibus. Tertia pars continebit Statuta Poe∣nalia sive Moralia, atque secundum hanc triplicem Statutorum partitio∣nem perlegantur in Comitiis majori∣bus omnibus praeterquam die Comi∣tiorum
divi Michaelis, quo tempore E∣lectiones Officiariorum instituuntur. Lectioni Statutorum intersint Socii, Candidati, & Permissi, quotquot ad∣esse poterunt. Atque haec nostra Statuta ad praedi∣ctum modum perlegentur, vel ab ipso Praesideaut Pro-Praeside (si ipsis placue∣rit) vel à Registrario, si adfuerit. At si fortè Registrarius, sive negotiis di∣strictus, sive morbo detentus, sive aliâ aliquâ gravi causâ impeditus, non adsuerit; tunc pro arbitrio Praesidis, aut Pro-Praesidis, alius aliquis è So∣ciis pro illo tempore designetur, qui illam Statutorum partem perlegat. Cautum tamen interea volumus, atque provisum; ut, si graviora quae∣dam negotia illis Comitiis pertractan∣da fuerint, Liberum sit Praesidi aut Pro-Praesidi, pro arbitrio hanc Sta∣tutorum lectionem, pro tempore, vel penitus omittere, vel ejus partem dun∣taxat aliquam legere, aut legendam praecipere.
CAP. VII. De Temporibus Ordinariis & Ex∣traordinariis Comitiorum & re∣liquis ad Comitiorum rationem pertinentibus. ORdinata sive Stata Comitia ad quatuor anni Tempora aeque distantia celebrenter. Prima postridiè Divi Michaelis si commodè fieri potest, &c. ut supra dictum est. Secunda postridiè Divi Thomae, si commodè, &c. Tertia postridiè Dominicae Palma∣rum si commodè, &c. Quarta postridiè Nativitatis Divi Johannis Baptistae si commodè, &c. Atque haec omnia sunt ordinaria si∣ve stata Comitia, quae etiam solennia & majora licebit appellare.
Ac praeter stata ista sive ordinaria licebit etiam Praesidi, alia quoque so∣lennia sive majora Comitia extraordi∣naria convocare pro necessitate aut dignitate incidentis rei. Atque in omnibus istis solennibus Comitiis, volumus ut duodecim ad minimum Socii adsint praeter Praesi∣dem aut Pro-Praesidem. At si urgens aliqua necessitas, ut saevitia Pestis, &c. aut grave aliquod negotium per principis mandatum ex∣pediendum inciderit; idque eo fortè tempore, quo tot Socii in Civitate non adfuerint tunc quidem necessitati parendum est, talique casu res tota relinquenda est Praesidis aut Pro-Prae∣sidis prudentiae & judicio, ut quot fu∣erint in Urbe, eos omnes per Bedel∣lum admonendos curet, ut intersint Comitiis atque in istis majoribus Co∣mitiis, volumus ut ordinariae fiant E∣lectiones & Admissiones novorum So∣ciorum, Candidatorum, & Permisso∣rum.
Quod verò ad Sociorum, Candidato∣rum, & Permissorum, Examinationes attinet eae rectè peragi possunt, sive in majoribus istis Comitiis, sive etiam in aliis minoribus Conventionibus pro Praesidis aut Pro-Praesidis arbitrio. In omnibus Comitiis, Praeses, aut Pro-Praeses, Conventûs causam expo∣nat; quid singuli ordine dicant ex∣pectet, accipiatque Suffragia: nec quisquam discedat nisi impetratâ pri∣us veniâ, antequam Praeses, aut Pro-Praeses Comitia disertis hisce verbis dissolverit, Solvimus haec Comitia. Sunt enim alia Comitia, quae mino∣ra dicuntur, qualia singulis Mensibus, aliisque temporibus, pro ratione re∣rum & personarum habentur; prout occasio aliqua subitanea postulaverit. In his, admittendi in Collegium, examinantur; res item Agyrtarum & Impostorum omniumque Medicinam malè factitantium, à Praeside & Censo∣ribus executiuntur, ipsique pro me∣rito
puniuntur; aliaque id genus ne∣gotia tractantur. In minoribus istis Comitiis non re∣quirimus, ut tot adsint Socii, quot in majoribus & solennibus requirun∣tur; suffecerit, si in his Dominus Praeses, quatuor Censores, & Registra∣rius adfuerint. Necesse autem est, ut omnes Censo∣res intersint, secundum Statuta Regni, modò legitimè admoniti fuerint per Bedellum; quare ne reliqui frustra conveniant, absentem Censorem de∣cem solidis mulctandum statuimus; ni∣si Praesidem antea de absentiae suae cau∣sâ certiorem fecerit. Summâ in omnibus Comitiis agen∣dum est modestiâ summâ gravitate, ne qua lis aut convitium oriatur; tur∣pe certè jurgium in privatis congressi∣bus, sed turpissimum in publicis: praesertim inter eos, qui ex bonis di∣sciplinis honestos mores hausisse judi∣cantur.
Proinde nemo proponat aut dicat a∣liquid publicè in Collegio, nisi Capi∣te aperto, veniâque priús à Praeside impetratâ: ad quem solum Oratio di∣rigenda est. Quòd si plures simul loqui incep∣tent, cedat Junior seniori Unusquis∣que breviter, & graviter, sine pro∣lixâ dicacitate loquatur; & Praesidis monitu sileat. Neminique liceat loquentem intur∣bare, nisi Praesidi aut Pro-Praesidi, aut praesentium Censorum seniori cujus e∣nim munus esto, quemlibet sui officii admonere. Unusquisque autem ad rem propo∣situm semel tantùm suoque ordine, sen∣tentiam dicat; nisi iterum impetratâ à Praeside veniâ. Reliqui Socii attenti sint, nec pri∣vatis confabulationibus susurris, stre∣pituve, loquentem, vel auditores in∣terturbent, & semper ad Praesidis nu∣tum fiat silentium: qui contra fecerit
duobus solidis statim solvendis ple∣ctetur. In rebus dubiis, & magni momen∣ti, elegantur delegati, pro Praesidis arbitrio, qui rem undiquaque discu∣tiant, referantque ad Collegium sin∣gulis Comitiis, postquam Praeses Con∣ventûs causam exposuerit. Registrarius quae novissimis acta Comitiis clarâ voce recenseat (ut expunctis si quae fuerint emendanda) demum inscribantur Libro Annalium. Suffragia colligenda nemo propo∣nat, nisi Praeses aut Pro-Praeses. In omnibus Electionibus tacitè & occultè, per pisa aut fabas ferantur Suffragia, in aliis Collegii negotiis, prout visum fuerit Praesidi aut Pro-Praesidi.
CAP. VIII. De Statutis Condendis & Abro∣gandis, & de Mulctis Irro∣gandis. STatuta pauca sanciantur, eaque vel Fide datâ vel Mulctâ confir∣mentur. Sit Mulcta levis, sed inevitabilis; minima Mulcta sit 12 denariorum. Ad Statutum aliquod Condendum sufficient Comitia duo, sed ad Abro∣gandum non nisi tria. Statuimus & ordinamus ut omnes Mulctae, quae à Praeside aut Pro-Prae∣side, & quatuor Censoribus; vel à majore parte Sociorum, quomodocun∣que infliguntur, cedant duntaxat in u∣sum Collegii, non autem in ullius privati emolumentum; exceptis ta∣men illis pecuniarum solutionibus quae per Statuta Collegii Officiariis aliter
conceduntur. Volumusque ut hae Mul∣ctae illico solvantur, aut saltem datâ hypothecâ, qualem Praeses expetierit, sibi caveat de praesenti paecunia. CAP. IX. De Officio Thesaurarii. COllegii redditus & Emolumenta quae Annuatim accrescunt Colle∣gio, recipiet, & in custodiâ suâ tutò conservabit, in usum Collegii. Collegii Utensilia, aliaque necessa∣ria, quoties opus fuerit, procurabit. Ejusdemque Bona, Libros, Suppel∣lectilem, caeteraquae Ornamenta ad de∣cus illius pertinentia, quantum potue∣rit, tutò & decenter conservabit. Si quid reparandum fuerit in Colle∣gii Edisiciis, curabit ut id tempestivè fiat.
Lites Collegii & Causas Juridicas ipse unâ cum Praeside & Censoribus prosequetur. Collegii Officiariis, sua cuique Sa∣laria sive Stipendia, ex Statutis debita, quatuor usitatis Anni temporibus per∣solvet. Computi rationem bis quotannis Praesidi & Electoribus reddet, modò ad hoc postulatus & praemonitus fuerit. Intra mensem post festum Divi Mi∣chaelis, perfectum computi rationem, pro integro elapso anno reddet; eo nempe die, quem Praeses ille assigna∣verit. Totamque pecuniae summam quae tunc temporis supererit, caeteraque Collegii Bona, Suppellectilem, Uten∣silia, quae in ipsius custodia fuerint, Praesidi & Electoribus restituet. Syngraphâ Praesidi & Societati ob∣ligabitur, eodem die quo admittitur ad Officium, ut Stipendia Collegii Of∣ficiariis debita, intra septimanam, post plenam computi sui rationem pro
illo anno redditam, fideliter solvat. In reparandis Collegii Aedificiis, rebusque necessariis in usum Collegii coemendis, non impendet ultra qua∣draginta solidos, sine Praesidis aut Pro-Praesidis voluntate, & consensu. Thesaurario pro Stipendio solven∣tur annuatim ex Collegii redditibus quadraginta solidi. Statuimus praeterea & ordinamus, ut à singulis in Collegii Societatem admis∣sis, itemque à singulis, qui vel in Can∣didatorum ordinem, vel in permisso∣rum numerum admittentur, accipiat sex solidos & octo denarios, tempore admissionis illorum. Dabit Fidem se perfuncturum Offi∣cio suo fideliter secundum Statuta, omniaque acturum in honorem & u∣tilitatem Collegii; & computi ratio∣nem fideliter redditurum monitu Prae∣sidis.
CAP. X. De Registrario. OFficium Registrarii hujusmodi e∣sto, singulis Collegii Comitiis, sive majoribus sive minoribus, legiti∣mè & tempestivè admonitus per Col∣legii Bedellum sive Praesidis aut Pro-Praesidis ministrum, ipsemet coram ad∣sit, sub poenâ decem Solidorum. Quicquid ibi actum, ratum, & sancitum fuerit, consentientibus Prae∣side, & Sociorum praesentium majori parte (nisi sit res levioris momenti, & notatu indigna) id omne fideliter adnotet & initio Comitiorum prox∣imè sequentium perlegat, ac postea (correctis si quae emendanda fuerint) in Librum Annalium Collegii referat.
Sin autem per valetudinem, aut graviora negotia impeditus fuerit, quò minus adesse possit; tunc ei lice∣bit, Socium aliquem pro tempore substituere, qui & absentia ejus cau∣sam Praesidi significet, & locum ipsius diligenter suppleat. Formulas Literarum ad Collegium vel à Collegio scriptarum; & reliqua omnia acta, Libro Annalium inserat. Pro Annuo Stipendio, Registrario quotannis solventur ex Collegii reddi∣tibus, Quadraginti solidi, eidem per aequales partes, quatuor usitatis hujus Regni terminis, à Thesaurario annu∣merandi. A singulis, qui vel ad praxin in Medicinâ permittuntur, vel in Candi∣datorum Ordinem adsciscuntur, vel in Sociorum numerum admittuntur; ipso vel Permissionis vel Admissionis tempore Registrario solventur Sex So∣lidi & octo denarii, & Quinque insu∣per Solidi pro illorum Nominum in∣scriptione in Librum Annalium.
Quotiescunque contigerit, aliquem ex Sententiâ Praesidis aut Pro-Praesidis, & Censorum, mulctari aliquâ pecuniae summâ notabili Collegio persolvendâ, à singulis ita punitis, Tres Solidi & qua∣tuor denarii Registrario solventur. Si quis, aliquâ pecuniae summâ in u∣sum Collegii solvendâ mulctatus, non simul & semel totum mulctam solverit, sed solutionem imperatam, ad dies ali∣quot distulerit, adeòque eam partitim solverit; singulis istis solutionibus sic divisim factis, Tres Solidi & quatuor denarii Registrario persolventur; quippe Officium ejus molestum onus judicamus. Dabit Fidem se Officio suo debitè perfuncturum, secundum Statuta, in honorem & utilitatem Collegii omni∣aque fideliter Libro Annalium quae fu∣erint acta, vel in majoribus, vel mi∣noribus Comitiis sine fraude inscriptu∣rum.
CAP. XI. De Candidatis. STatuimus & ordinamus, Ut nu∣merus Candidatorum non excedat Duodecim: Volumusque ut nemo ad∣mittatur in illorum Ordinem, qui non sit in Medicinâ Doctor, & Na∣tione Britannus, & Medicinam exer∣cuerit per quadriennium. Quod si Doctoratûs gradum in ex∣terâ aliquâ Academiâ adeptus fuerit; Volumus, Ut antequam admittatur ad examen, Diploma, sive Literas Te∣stimoniales veras & authenticas illius Academiae proferat, & ostendat Col∣legio; & praeterea, ab alterutra no∣strarum Academiarum incorporatio∣nis suae testimonium habeat, & ad∣ducat. Volumus praeterea & ordinamus, Ut singuli Candidati & Permissi an∣tequam
admittantur, omnes Collegii So∣cios bis, gratiae impetrandae ergo con∣veniant; nimirùm primò ante exami∣nationem ullam, secundò autem finitô examinationum curriculô. Fides a Candidatis postulata. DAbis Fidem, te observaturum Statuta Collegii; & pro viribus conaturum, ut honos ejus sartus te∣ctus conservetur, nec unquam consili∣um aut familiaritatem inibis cum ali∣quo qui studet verbô vel factô Col∣legii statum labefactare; sed in om∣nibus quae ad honorem & utilitatem Collegii spectant, consiliô, ope, & auxiliô juvabis. Dabis etiam Fidem, te in omni∣bus licitis & honestis morigerum fu∣turum Domino Praesidi aut Pro-Prae∣sidi, & Electoribus, Seniori in Col∣legio (secundum Statuta) locum ce∣des, eundemque honore debito pro∣sequeris.
Accedes ad Collegium, ex man∣dato Domini Praesidis aut Pro-Prae∣sidis, vel Censorum; quoties fueris per Bedellum admonitus & accersitus. Intereris fingulis Anatomiis, nisi gravi detinearis impedimento, appro∣bando à Praeside & Censoribus. Nec prece, nec pretio, neque ullâ aliâ causâ, medicamenta quae abortum faciunt, vel venena cujusvis generis, in pernitiem, aut malum usum dabis; nec ea quempiam docebis, quem su∣spicaris velle illis abuti. Neminem qui admissus est in Col∣legium, vel ignorantiae, vel maleficii nomine accusabis, aut publicè contu∣meliis afficies. Persequeris omnibus modis hone∣stis, indoctos, Empericos, & Impo∣stores, eorumque nomina ad Praesi∣dem aut Censores referes; nec te Em∣piricis, aliisque per Collegium non li∣centiatis familiarem reddes; neque eo∣rum Conventiones ad Collegii detri∣mentum
vel infamum ullo modo fre∣quentabis. Secreta Collegii nemini extra Col∣legium divulgabis. Dabis fidem, te neque Literis à Mag∣natibus, nec pretio, nec ullô alio mo∣do illicitô, Collegii Societatem, am∣bire; omniaque in arte Medicâ pro vi∣ribus facturum, ad honorem Collegii & Reipublicae utilitatem. Statuimus & ordinamus, Ut Per∣missi sive Licentiati, itemque Can∣didati, Statuta & Decreta nostra dili∣genter observent, Praesidi, Electori∣bus, & Censoribus morem gerant; Mulctaque, ab iis, ob delicta inflictos promptè, persolvant. Praeterea non recusabunt, Medica∣menta illa sua, quae Secreta sive Ar∣cana appellant, solentque in suâ praxi usurpare planè & nudè exponere, quoties à Praeside & Censoribus ad id faciendum requiruntur; qui per∣tinaciter
contrà fecerit, pro arbitrio Praesidis & Censorum poenas lucet. Unusquisque Candidatus solvet tem∣pore admissionis suae quatuor libras in usum Collegii, & decem solidos in proprios usus Praesidis, Thesaurario verò sex solidos & octo denarios; i∣temque Registrario, pro debito Sala∣rio, sex solidos & octo denarios, ei∣demque insuper quinque alios solidos, pro insertione Nominis in Librum An∣nalium; praeterea Bedello Collegii tres solidos & quatuor denarios. Quoniam multi huc confluunt quo∣tidiè ad exercendam praxin, è quo∣rum numero complures sunt, qui an∣te debitum tempus ex Academiis suis emigrantes, ad transmarinas oras voli∣tant, ut in exteris regionibus brevio∣ri spatio, & minori impendio ad Do∣ctoratûs gradum perreptent, quam domi in Academiis nostris assequi po∣terant. Idcirco statuimus, Ut quicunque vel in Collegii Societatem, vel in Can∣didatorum
Ordinem, vel in Permis∣sorum numerum admittetur, si Do∣ctoratûs gradum apud exteros suscepe∣rit: Is admissionis tempore, duplo plus solvat Collegio, Praesidi, The∣saurario, Registrario, aliisque Colle∣gii Officiariis, quàm illi solvere solent, qui in nostris Academiis Doctores cre∣antur. Item, quicunque Doctor cre∣atus fuerit in nostris Academiis, si ta∣men testinantiùs ad gradum illum sub∣volando, quàm par est tempus illi dignitati debitum anticipaverit, id est, si Doctor fiat prius, quam vel in arti∣bus integros septem annos rexerit, vel tam diu Baccalaures in Medicinâ praeextiterit; is duplo plus solvet Col∣legio, Praesidi, caeterisque praedictis Collegii Officiariis, quàm illi solent, qui secundùm laudabiles leges & con∣suetudines nostrarum Academiarum, tempore praefinito, & maturiori cum judicio, ad Doctoratûs gradum ascen∣derunt. Volumus, Ut omnes Candidati, & Permissi, à Bedello admoniti, singu∣lis
nostris Comitiis intersint; ut si quos cognoverint illicitè & inscienter prax∣in exercentes, eorum nomina Praefidi, & Censoribus significent; tum etiam ut Statutorum praelectionem audiant. Solvant etiam, si occasio fuerit, & necessitas Collegii postulet, ut Socii; modo ad id requirantur. Exactô anno, Candidati Praesidem ejus rei moneant, rogentque ut in So∣ciorum numerum adsciscantur, si modò id commodè fieri potest, salvis Colle∣gii Statutis. CAP. XII. De Sociis. STatuimus & ordinamus, Ut nume∣rus Sociorum, non excedat trigin∣ta; volumusque ultra hunc certum & determinatum numerum Regis, Regi∣nae, & Principis Medicos ordinarios
tanquam Medicos Honorarios Super∣numerari & admitti. Volumus praeterea, Ut nemo ad∣mittatur in Collegii Societatem, qui non priùs fuit per annum integrum de Candidatorum numero, aut publicè in aliquâ Britanniae Academiâ Medicinam per triennium perlegerit, aut Doctor Cathedrae, ut aiunt, in aliquâ hujus regni Academiâ prae-extiterit, aut Re∣gius Medicus fuerit ordinarius. Singuli Socii tempore admissionis suae solvent Collegio, Praesidi, The∣saurario, Registrario, & Bedello, prout de Candidatis antea Statutum est; omnes item solutiones duplica∣bunt, conditionibus iis, quae supra dictae sunt. Statuimus etiam, Ut omnes Socii tempore admissionis, Literas habeant Patentes Sigillo Collegii munitas; & hâc datâ fide obstringantur. ADnitêris pro viribus, ut Status Collegii perpetuetur, Statuta
Collegii observabis, Parebis Praesidi in iis quae ad honorem & perpetuita∣tem Collegii spectant. Non dabis quae abortum faciant, aut conceptum adimant, vel impedi∣ant, nec venena in malum finem; imò verò ea ne docebis quidèm ubi aliqua doli mali suspitio est. Neminem decernes in Collegium co∣optandum, nisi quem seposito omni affectu, judicaveris scientiâ & moribus idoneum. Leges diligenter intra annum, quin∣que primos Libros Galeni, de simplici Medicinâ, & omnes de usu partium. Persequêris omnibus modis honestis, indoctos, Empericos & Impostores, eo∣rumque nomina Praesidi, aut Pro-Prae∣sidi, vel Censoribus deferes. Dabis etiam fidem te Medicinam ex∣ercuisse per quadriennium, aut legisse publicè in aliquâ Academiâ. Item dabis fidem, te Statutum de publicâ corporis humani diffectione,
summâ diligentiâ, quandocunque à Praeside aut Pro-Praeside, admonitus fueris observaturum. Dices denique verè & bonâ fide, quaenam sit patria tua. Literae Admissionis. SCiant omnes, Nos J. C. Medicinae Doctorem & Praesidem Collegii Medicorum Londinensium, unà cum consensu Sociorum ejusdem, authori∣tate nobis à Domino Rege & Parlia∣mento concessâ, examinasse, appro∣basse & in Collegium nostrum co-op∣tasse doctum & probum virum R. M. Cantuariensem in Florentissimâ Acade∣miâ (Cantabrigiensi vel Oxoniensi) Medicinae Doctorem; eique concessis∣se Liberam Facultatem & Licentiam exercendi Scientiam & Artem Medi∣cam juxta formam Statutorum ad hoc Editorum largitosque praeterea usum ac fructum omnium commoditatum Libertatum, ac Privilegiorum, quae
Collegio nostro authoritate praedictâ & jam concessa sunt, & in futurum concedenda. In cujus rei fidem & testimonium Sigillum nostrum commune praesenti∣bus apponi fecimus. Datum Londi∣ni, in Collegio nostro septimo die Maii Anno Domini 1647. * Si Collegarum quispiam se Re∣ligioni, aut Sacerdotio mancipaverit, postquam in Collegium co-optatus fu∣erit ne vocetur ad Collegium, ne videamur ad Medicinae usum revoca∣re eum, quem Religio & Lex Ecclesi∣astica à Medicinae functione ablega∣vit. * Neve honestum putemus Clerico, inter caetera, tractare res, morbosque muliebres. * Quod si Clericorum aut Religio∣sorum quispiam, admitti cupit in Collegium, aut permitti ad praxin, multo minus assumatur, propter easdem causas.
Si Collegarum quispiam se sacerdo∣tio addixerit postquam in Collegium co-optatus fuerit, nolumus eum denuò vocari ad Collegium. Quod si quispiam Clericus aut Sacris initiatus, admitti cupit in Collegium, aut permitti ad praxin multò minùs id illi concedetur. Statuimus & ordinamus, Ut si quis criminis alicujus gravioris ac publici reus, aut vitio aliquo insigni infamis fuerit, ablegetur à Collegio; ne si re∣tineremus talem, videremur aut virtu∣tem contemnere, aut eodem morbo laborare; ne autem talis Collega non existens, admittatur in Collegium, & aliis Statutis prohibitum est, & his pro∣hibemus.
CAP. XIII. Literae Testimoniales Practican∣tium per Ʋniversum Angliae Regnum. SCiant omnes, Nos A. B. Medecinae Doctorem & Praesidem Collegii Medicorum Londinensium, una cum consensu E. P. B. H. & R. M. prae∣dicti Collegii Sociorum & Electorum, Authoritate nobis à Domino Rege & Parliamento concessâ, examinas∣se & approbasse 17 die Aug. Anno Do∣mini 1667, probum virum T. W. ex Comitatu B. in Florentissimâ Acade∣miâ Oxoniensi vel Cantabrigiensi, Magi∣strum Artium & in Civitate Eboracen∣si benè in praxi Medica exercitatum eumque dignum judicamus, qui ad∣mittatur ad praxin Medicinae, juxta formam Statutorum ad hoc editorum;
in cujus rei testimonium Sigillum no∣strum Commune apposuimus, & nomi∣na adscripsimus. Datum Londini in Collegio nostro die, & mense, &c. Si quis à Praeside & tribus Electo∣ribus, modo praedicto idoneus ad praxin judicabitur, is Nomen suum Registrario indicabit ut in Libro An∣nalium inscribatur. CAP. XIV. De Coercendis Empiricis. CUm magna sit imperitorum turba qui Rempublicam affligunt, no∣bisque ex Prescripto Regis & Parlia∣menti incumbit ut populi saluti & se∣curitati consulamus; statuimus & or∣dinamus in commodiorem talium ex∣tirpationem, ut quos indoctos & in∣honestos esse reipsâ comprobaverimus, non solum mulctâ & carcere puniamus,
sed etiam Senatores & Pro-Senatores cujuslibet Urbis, Provinciae, sive Cu∣stodiae, ubi tales Impostores habitant certiores per literas nostras faciamus, eos indignos Medicorum nomine cen∣sendos, proindeque tractandos ut cae∣teros Cives. Forma autem Literarum talis esto sed Lingua vernacula. Forma Literarum ad Senatores. VOs certiores facimus egregii viri H. M. vestrae Provinciae, Empi∣ricum in vico S. Morantem, esse vi∣rum indoctum & imperitum Medicinae, nostrique nequaquam esse Collegii, quamobrem vobis licet pro jure ve∣stro, eum aliosque omnes qui Literas Testimoniales Sigillo nostro munitas non habent, ad omnibus urbis vestrae idoneis Officiis fungendum, co-optare & eligere, cogereque caetera agere & praestare, quae authoritati vestrae impe∣rari conceditur.
Haec in eum finem scripsimus, ne sub Medicinae nomine & praetextu, Privi∣legia fallant, insubidi isti plebis Impo∣stores. Datum è Collegio nostro, &c. CAP. XV. De Permissis sive Licentiatis ad Praxin. QUoniam complures, in hac Civi∣tate Medicinam faciunt, quos inidoneos omninò censemus, ut in numerum Sociorum aut Candidato∣rum adoptentur, vel quod natione non sint Britanni, vel Doctoratûs gra∣dum non adepti fuerint, vel non sa∣tis docti, aut aetate & gravitate pro∣vecti sint, vel alias consimiles ob cau∣sas, & tamen Reipublicae inservire & saluti hominum prodesse possint, sal∣tem in nonnullis curationibus.
De his ordinamus & statuimus, Ut post examinationes debitas & approba∣tionem Praesidis & Censorum permit∣tantur ad praxin, quamdiu se bene gesserint. Volumus ut omnes qui solummodo permittuntur ad praxin, eâdem side quâ Candidati obstringantur. Praeses igitur tempore admissionis his verbis utetur, Ego. J. C. Praeses Collegii Medicorum Londinensium, authoritate per Leges mihi concessâ, permitto te A. B. ad praxin Medici∣nae in Civitate Londini, & per septem circum circa milliaria, quamdiu te be∣ne gesseris, Statuta Collegii observave∣ris, & folutiones debitas praestiteris, ita facienti precor omnia fausta. Volumus ut permissi sive Licentiati folutiones omnes usitatas praestent Col∣legio, Praesidi Thesaurario, Registra∣rio & Bedello, quas modo Candidatis praestandas assignavimus. Volumus praeterea, ut primo Per∣missionis anno solvant Collegio sex li∣bras,
nisi ob causas à Praeside & Cen∣soribus approbandas mitiùs cum iis age∣re aequum censebitur, solvent utcun∣que quátuor ad minimum libras; fe∣quentibus autem annis quam diu per∣missi fuerint solvent in usum Collegii quadraginta solidos. Statuimus & ordinamus, Ut nemo ad praxin Medicinae admittatur intra Urbem, Suburbia, septem circum cir∣ca milliaria, nisi prius ter (totidem di∣ebus ad id constitutis) examinatus fu∣erit à Praeside & Censoribus, & ab iis∣dem approbatus; & ad Medicinae praxin permissus fuerit. Quod si quis intra spatium sive am∣bitum praedictum facultatem Medicinae exercuerit, nec tamen se examinan∣dum Praesidi & Censoribus ultrò obtu∣lerit; is primò admoneatur per Bedel∣lum idque Praesidis nomine, ut omninò à Medicinae praxi abstineat, donec Praesidis & Collegii approbationem ob∣tinuerit, utque stato & praefixo tem∣pore se coram Praeside & Censoribus
sistat, eorum examinationem atque ap∣probationem exspectaturus. Bedellus autem admonitionis Sche∣dulam vel ipsi, in manus tradat, vel domi illius relinquet, in haec verba; NOs Praeses & Censores, Collegii Medicorum Londinensium, te admonitum volumus ut 10 die Junii coram nobis in propriâ tuâ personâ compareas, idque post meridiem inter secundam & tertiam horam ejusdem diei, in Aedibus Collegii; ibidem re∣sponsurus ad ea quae tibi de Arte Me∣dicinae ejusdemque praxi objicientur. Datum à Collegio 10 die Junii Anno Domiui 1647. Quòd si praedicto modo admonitus, non comparuerit pro Refractario ha∣bendum & fecundum Regni Statuta plectendum censemus.
Cum autem nullo modo (nisi exa∣minatione prius habitâ) nobis consta∣re possit, quam sit quilibet idoneùs ut secundum Regni Leges ad Medicinae praxin admittatur. Statuimus etiam & ordinamus, Ut siquis Medicinam Londini, aut intra limites praedictos exercens, Praesidis jus∣su ad examen vocatus, comparuerit quidem, sed ille tamen Praesidi & Cen∣soribus respondere, & scientiae suae in Medicinâ faciendâ experientiaeque rati∣onem reddere recusaverit, pro ignaro & refractario habeatar; atque ob pra∣xin ita institutam à Praeside & Censori∣bus, secundum Regni Statuta punia∣tur. Statuimus etiam & ordinamus, Ut siquis à Praeside & Censoribus exami∣natus, eorum judicio non satis peritus aut idoneus censebitur, qui ad Medi∣cinae praxin admittatur, is statim ab iisdem praxi interdicatur.
Quòd si post hujusmodi prohibitio∣nem, Medicinae tamen Facultatem ex∣ercuerit vel cuipiam Medicamentum a∣liquod intra eandem Civitatem vel cir∣cuitum praedictum exhibuerit, prout Regni Statutis cautum est, puniatur. Aequum autem censemus, Ut Cen∣sores & Socii examinatos omnes, quot∣quot tam doctrinâ quàm moribus ido∣neos repererint, ad Medecinae praxin admittant, ne Collegium nostrum Mo∣nopolii accusetur; modò tamen Statu∣tis Collegii morem gesserint. CAP. XVI. Forma Examinationum Sociorum & Candidatorum eorundemque Admissionis. ANtequam quispiam vel in Socio∣rum vel Candidatorum Ordinem admittatur, ter examinetur in legiti∣mis
Comitiis, sive majoribus sive mi∣noribus, pro arbitrio Praesidis & Cen∣sorum, ut antea dictum & ordinatum est in Capite de Comitiis. Forma autem Examinationis hujus∣modi esto, PRimò, Examinetur in Parte Phy∣siologicâ, ipsisque Medicinae Ru∣dimentis; atque in hâc Examinatione proponantur Quaestiones ex Libris de Elementis, de Temperamentis, de U∣su Partium, de Rebus Anatomicis, de Naturalibus Potentiis & Facultatibus, & de caeteris Naturalis Medecinae Par∣tibus. Secundò, Examinetur in Parte Pa∣thologicâ, sive de Causis Morborum, Differentiis, Symptomatibus, & Sig∣nis, quibus utuntur Medici ad Essen∣tiam Morborum cognoscendam; atque in hâc Examinatione proponantur Quae∣stiones ex Libris de Arte Medicinali, de Locis affectis, de Morborum & Symptomatum Differentiis, de Febri∣bus,
de Pulsibus, de Libris Prognosti∣corum Hyppocratis, &c. Tertiò, Examinetur de Usu, Exer∣citioque Medicinae, sive Medendi Ra∣tione; idque fiat ex Libris de Sanitate Tuendâ, de Methodo Medendi, de Ratione Victûs in Morbis Acutis, de Simplici Medecinâ, de Crisibus, de A∣phorismis Hyppocratis & id genus aliis quae ad Medendi usum spectant; Ex. gr. Quae Cautio observanda sit in Purgan∣do? quaenam in Sectione Venae? nempè quo Tempore? quo Morbo? in quâ Personâ? quali Medicamine? in qua Venâ ista fieri debeant? Similiter quis sit usus Narcoticorum & Soporifero∣rum? & quae Cautio in illis Observan∣da? Quis sit Locorum internorum po∣sitio? Sive situs & quibus Viis pertin∣gant ad ea Medicamenta? Quis sit Cly∣sterum? quis Vomitionum Usus, peri∣culum, genus, & mensura?
Omnes has examinationes fieri volu∣mus à Praeside & Censoribus, licebit tamen cuilibet Socio disputare, pro ar∣bitrio & periculum facere, quantum in re Medicâ valeat. In istis autem Examinationibus cu∣pimus, ut Socii candidè se gerant, & suavi quodam sermonis temperamento utantur; nequaquam morosos, se praebeant, aut difficiles in disputando. Si Doctoris gradum in aliquâ no∣strarum Academiarum susceperit, ho∣noris causâ sedeat decenter examinan∣dus; ne quid indignum pati à nostrâ Examinationum formâ Mater Acade∣mia videatur. Qui ad hunc modum examinatus fu∣erit, si se virum doctum praestiterit, moresque etiam honestos & amabiles habuerit (de quibus insignem curam haberi cupimus) admittatur per majo∣rem partem Sociorum praesentium; modò non pauciores istis Comitiis ad∣fuerint, quam duodecim praeter Praesi∣dem & Pro-Praesidem.
Formula Admissionis talis esto. ADmittendus flexis genibus, manus invicem applicatas humiliter tra∣dat in manus Praesidis, qui dicat, Ego J. C. Praeses hujus Collegii admitto te A. B. in Societatem nostri Collegii (vel in Ordinem Candidatorum, vel in nu∣merum Permissorum) quibus peractis si Socius fuerit, singulis Sociis praesen∣tibus exhibitâ manu gratias agat. Quod si constet eum qui examinan∣dus est, in aliquâ è nostris Academiis per triennium fuisse Publicum Medici∣nae Praelectorem Regium & Doctorem Cathedrae, ut aiunt, vel ob singularem scientiae famam ad aulam vocatum, at∣que Regis aut Reginae Medicum esse; non erit necesse ut examinetur, sed pro arbitrio Praesidis aut Pro-Praesidis, & majoris partis Sociorum praesentium, potest admitti absque ullâ disputandi Ceremoniâ.
Quicunque, vel Censor vel Socius, Quaestiones proponit in examinationi∣bus, detecto sit capite, perinde ac Do∣ctor ille qui istic ut examinetur ac∣cessit. CAP. XVII. De Loco & Dignitate Praesidis & omnium Sociorum. PRaesidis locus primus esto, ut & dignitas prima, non solum in Col∣legio, sed in aliis omnibus locis. Medicorum Regiorum ordinario∣rum qui assignatum Stipendium, Lite∣rasque Patentes sub Magno Regni Si∣gillo habuerint, locos & honos proxi∣mè post Praesidem esto. Unicuique locus esto, pro senio∣ritate, ita ut seniores junioribus, non modò in Collegio, sed & extra illud ubique praeferantur.
Senioritatem autem vocamus, non quam aetas aut dignitas, aut ubicun∣que suscepti gradûs tempus fecere, sed quam admissio in Collegium. CAP. XVIII. De Anatomica Administratione, & ¶ De Lectura Chirurgiae. STatuimus & ordinamus, Ut singu∣li Socii Admissionis tempore fidem dent, se Corpus Humanum publicè Collegii sumptu Anatomicè admini∣straturos, eo anno quem Praeses indix∣erit, idque vel in Collegio, vel alio loco judicio Praesidis & Electorum as∣signando; potissimum fi quis Anato∣mices peritus iis videbitur. Quod si quis onus impositum recu∣saverit, atque ipsemet ad eam rem
minùs idoneus illorum judicio habe∣atur, solvet quatuor libras in usum Collegii; sin autem munere hoc debi∣to defungi pervicaciter negaverit is pro libito Praesidis & majoris partis Sociorum praesentium mulctabitur; modò tamen poena haec Viginti libras non excesserit. Statuimus etiam & ordinamus, Ut nullus Socius aut alius Collega, alibi quàm in Collegio aut loco à Praeside & Electoribus assignato publicè Corporis Humani administrationem suscipiat aut profiteatur, sub poena quatuor libra∣rum, nisi locus ille ab Urbe septem ad minimum miliaribus abfuerit. Volumus tamen, Ut integrum sit cuilibet Collegae publicè Anatomiam exercere in Aulâ Chyrurgorum dum∣modo Communitatis Chyrurgorum Magister, & Domini Guardiani ve∣niam illi priùs impetraverint à Praesi∣de aut Pro-Praeside; quippe aequum & rationi consentaneum arbitramur, ut qui per Collegam aliquem prosic∣unt, ii Collegio ipsi aliquod gatian∣mi officium praestnt.
Statuimus praeterea, Ut omnes So∣cii & Candidati singulis publicis Ana∣tomicis dissectionibus in Collegio fa∣ctis intersint togâ & pileo decenter ve∣stiti, pro honore Collegii & Artis. Qui contrà fecerit, tribus solidis & quatuor denariis plectetur. ¶ Ut Lectura in Chyrurgiâ, crebio∣ri idoneorum Auditorum turba meliùs frequentetur; idcirco volumus & statui∣mus, ut omnes Candidati, omnes eti∣am permissi ad practicandum in hac Ci∣vitate Lecturam in Chirurgiâ diligen∣ter audire teneantur. Qui secus fece∣rit, & in hac re negligentiùs se gesserit, is toties quoties absens fuerit, pro absentiá suâ, singulis vicibus solvet Collegio duodecim denarios; quam pecuniae summam qui in manibus suis detinuerint & Officiario Collegii ad cam rem deputato solvere recusaverit intra octo dies post finem illius termi∣ni, in quo propter absentias suas prius debebatur, tunc volumus ut illa mulcta
duodecim denariorum augeatur ad du∣os solidos sexque denarios, toties quo∣ties delictum fuerit. Volumus insuper, Ut postquam to∣tos quinque Annos hanc Lecturam at∣tentius audiverint, tunc Liberum sit iis deinceps ut suo utantur, hac in re, arbitrio non enim à nobis requiritur ut longius illius Lecturae sint Auditores post quinquennium in eo studio dili∣genter collocatum. Concedimus praetereant liberum sit unicuique pro arbitrio ter abesle impu∣nè in unoquoque Termino, & quod mulcta absentium toties quoties cedat in usum Praelectoris pro tempore exi∣stentis, & quod statutum sit, ut debi∣ta fiat istorum omnium persolutio, an∣tequam admitti possit in Collegium: iniquum enim censemus Praelectorem nostrum frustra Auditores expectando oleum & operam perdere, praeter ho∣norem Artis & dignitatem Collegii.
CAP. XIX. De Ornatu & Vestitu Medico∣rum STatuimus, juxta Hyppocratis consi∣lium, Ut Socii omnes Vestitu de∣coro amiciantur, quoties ad Collegi∣um accedunt aut in publicum prodeunt ne Artis praestantia & dignitas, ob im∣munditiem, malè apud vulgus audiat & contemptui habeatur. Quare statuimus & ordinamus, Ut Praeses, Pro-Praeses, Electores, Cen∣sores, reliquique omnes Socii in omni∣bus Comitiis majoribus Collegam Conviviis, Funeribus, & Anaos Administrationibus, Togâ reiquque Vestitu decenti induantur sub poena quinque solidorum Collegio solvendo∣rum quoties deliquerint.
CAP. XX. De Exequiis. SI ex Collegis quempiam mori con∣tigerit (nisi Peste obierit) unus∣quisque Collega per Bedellum legiti∣mè praemonitus funus suo Ordine se∣qui, & Exequiis reliquisque Divinis Officiis interesse tenebitur, sub poenâ trium solidorum, & quatuor denari∣orum Collegii usibus solvendorum. Volumus praeterea, in honorem Collegii, ut Praesidi sedile in Templo, tapete sive auleo, & pulvinari decenti ornetur tantisper dum Funebria Offi∣cia aliaeque Divinae Solennitates cele∣brantur.
CAP. XXI. De Conviviis. QUoniam ex honestis Conventibus mutuus amor alitur, atque ani∣mi studiosorum recreantur, Volumus, Ut omnes qui in Collegii Societatem admissi fuerint, Praesidem & Socios omnes in Urbe praesentes, fru∣gali, honesto, ac sufficienti Convivio excipiant; idque tempore à Praeside priùs indicto. Indicat autem ipsorum Comitiorum ordinariorum sive majorum die aut quo die visum fuerit ex quindecem proximè insequentibus Festum Divi Michaelis, Nativitatis Domini, Pas∣chatis, aut Nativitatis Divi Johannis Baptistae. Peracto Convivio licebit eodem in loco, exclusis alienis Arbitris, Comitia celebrare & Collegii negotia tractare,
si res id postulaverit, & necessum Prae∣ses & Consiliarii judicaverint. Si autem aliquando contigerit, ut is, cujus est Convivium apparare, id commode praestare nequeat; ac prop∣terea ob justam aliquam & honestam causam, à Praeside & majori Societatis parte approbatam petierit à Societate ut benignè legibus his solvatur, illo∣que onere liberetur, rem totam Prae∣sidis & Societatis prudentiâ moderan∣dam relinquimus. Quicunque tamen Collega gratiam hanc obtinuerit, ut à Convivio a∣dornando immunis sit, solvet nihilomi∣nus Collegii usibus decem aut viginti libras, prout aequum videbitur Prae∣sidi, & majori parti Sociorum.
CAP. XXII. De Conversatione Morali & Sta∣tutis Poenalibus. SI quae lis aut controversia ex ordi∣ne, gravitate, & modestiâ (quae in Comitiis observari praescripsimus) parum observatis, oriatur; arbitrio Praesidis aut Pro-Praesidis, & Censo∣rum, quicunque deliquerit, punia∣tur. At si Praeses, contra Statuta quid admiserit, admoneatur quidem per Consiliarios coram Sociis in Comitiis, non puniatur tamen, nisi ob grave a∣liquòd crimen (quale est peculatus, si∣ve dissipatio bonorum Collegii & simi∣lia) tale judicatum per majorem par∣tem Sociorum praesentium; inter quos volumus ut quatuor sint ex Electori∣bus, qui unà cùm reliquis super ea re sententiam ferant.
Tantum tribuimus Praesidis honori & authoritati. Ne quis revelet aut propalet quid∣quam alicujus momenti quod in Colle∣gio dictum sit, sub poenâ Decem soli∣dorum. Nullus Collega alterum vel ignoran∣tiae vel male praxis vel alicujus sceleris, aut ignominiosi criminis nomine accu∣sabit, vel publicè contumeliis afficiet. Si quem contra fecisse Praesidi & Censoribus innotuerit, primâ vice sol∣vet in Collegii usum Quatuor libras. Secundò duplicabitur Mulcta, quod si tertiò quis similiter offenderit, expel∣letur è Collegio; nec denuo restitue∣tur, priusquam Collegio Decem libras solverit. Nullus Medicus, qui secundus ad ae∣grum vocabitur priorem Medicum re∣pelli faciet, nec quicquam prius inno∣vabit (nisi res urgeat) quàm illum con∣venerit, & ne quis fraudi locus sit; quicunque ad aegrum accersitur, ab
illo vel astantibus, an quis Medicamen∣tum aliquod praescripserit, percuncta∣bitur: Sub poenâ Vigenti Solido∣rum. Postea tamen ex aegri sententiâ, vel solus illi Medebitur, vel cum priori Medico, aut alio aliquo rem Admini∣strabit. Dabit tamen operam, quantùm po∣terit, ut priorem secum in Praxi re∣tineat. Quod si aegroti, vel Amicorum con∣sensu id fieri nequeat priorem tamen, Medicum nullo modo vituperabit; nec Vultu, Gestu, Suspicioso Silentio, vell ullo alio modo, illius Acta apud aegrum, vel astantes traducet sed eum laudabit potius; neque id dolosè, Honestatis & Probitatis Nomine, sed (quod ad rem maximè attinet) pe∣riti & Intelligentis Medici: Memor semper, ut alterius famam apud alios co loco habeat, quo suam mutatis vicibus esse cuperet. Nempe ad Ar∣tis, quam Profitetur, Honorem & Dignitatem.
Consultandi Formula. SI plures, curationis gratiâ, Con∣venerint, de Conditione aegri de∣liberaturi consultandum est sum∣mâ modestiâ, & non nisi seclusis Arbitris alienis, Latinè autem res transigatur; alioquin mulcta esto quinque Solidorum in usum Collegii. Tunc Primùm sedulò inquirendum in Morbi Speciem, Causam, & Sym∣ptomata. Deinde Remedia propo∣nenda, ad Morbum Profligandum, & Symptomata Mitiganda maximè Con∣venientia. Incipiat Junior Medicus, Concludat Senior. At si Senior aliquis primò accersitus fuerit, enarret ille primum rem totam reliquis; nempe quid egerit, & quo successu: Dein fiat ut dictum est.
Si saepius ad eundum aegrum vi∣sendum convenerint, nemo quidquem praescribat, imò ne innuat quidem quid agendum sit, coram aegro, vel astanti∣bus; priùsquam conjunctis Consiliis privatim inter ipsos Medicos conclu∣sum fuerit: Ne quis ambitiosè nimium videatur praxin praeoccupare, & reli∣quis liberam praescribendi ansam prae∣ripere; nisi subitâ & urgente aliquâ occasione (eâque approbandâ à Praesi∣de & Censoribus) coactus fuerit solus praescribere. Si Medici in Diversas eant sen∣tentias, ita ut in eandem praxin inter se consentire nequeant, summâ tamen prudentiâ & moderatione sic se gerant, ut eorum discordia in Artis praejudi∣cium non cedat; nec aliis, si fieri pos∣sit, innotescat. Si duo tantum Medici fuerint; Junior cedat Seniori; vel tertiam ad∣vocent, cui res referatur: Si plures vincat pars major: Si Dissidentes nu∣mero pares fuerint concludatur cum
majori parte Seniorum. Sic honori & dignitati Artis providebitur; quae alioquin per Medicorum discordium facilè contemptui habebitur, qui con∣trà secerit, mulctabitur Quadraginta Solidis. Ne qua lis aut Controversia inter Medicos, propter Officiosas Visitati∣ones, Praeoccupationes, & Insinuati∣ones, oriatur. Statuimus & Ordinamus, ut cum ad Medicum quemlibet alii Medici consultandi gratiâ advocati fuerint; ac secundùm formulam à nobis prae∣scriptam, de Morbo & Remediis inter eos convenerit: Senior Medicus, aut alius aliquis, referat aegro, aut astanti∣bus, quae Approbata & Praescripta communi consensu fuerint, eorundem∣que Executionem caeteri Ordinario Medico relinquant; nec denuo Visi∣tabunt aegrum, nisi à Medico Ordina∣rio, aut ab aegro, ut id faciunt ex∣pressè rogati fuerint. Nullus Medicus, sive Socius, sive
Candidatus, sive Permissus Consilium ineat cum Empirico, aut rejecto à Collegio, & à Medicinae praxi prohi∣bito, aut alio aliquo sine Admissione aut Permissione Medicinam exercente nisi urgente aliquâ Causâ, à Praeside aut Pro-Praeside, & Censoribus, aut majori parte illorum approbandâ; sub poenâ Quadraginta Solidorum. Quilibet Medicus contentus esto ho∣nestâ, pro conditione aegri, & laboris sui, mercede. Nemo paciscetur cum aegro, ut alio quovis aegri nomine de praetio sanita∣tis restituendae. Verùm si quis aegros susceperit cu∣randos, qui sibi aliter satisfactum non putabunt nisi pactionem ineant cum Medico: Aut in eos incidat, qui fa∣cultatum suarum, aut honoris nullâ habitâ ratione Parcè nimis & illibera∣liter agunt cum Medicis; cum talli∣bus licebit pacisci. Reservatâ tamen potestate Domino Praesidi, & Censo∣ribus, atque in corum absentiâ, quatuor ex Electoribus, pro ipsorum pruden∣tiâ
corrigere, si quid iniquiùs pactum sit, & immutare. Ne quis doceat Populum Medica∣menta, aut horum nomina illi indicet; (praesertim si fuerint Medicamenta Ve∣hementioria, veluti Purgantia, Opiata, vel Narcotica, abortum facientia, Vo∣mitoria, aut quidquam aliud majoris momenti ac periculi) ne abusu eorum laedatur Populus: sub poenâ quadra∣ginta solidorum, quoties offenderit. Qui paciscitur cum Pharmacopolis, de aliquâ pretii parte ex Medicamen∣tis Praescribendis percipiendâ; mul∣ctabitur quadraginta solidis quoties ita deliquerit. Nullus Socius, Candidatus, aut Per∣missus, eorum Pharmacopolarum ope∣râ utetur; qui aut ipsi Medicinam ex∣ercent, aut iis Medicis crebro inservi∣unt, qui Examinati & Approbati non sunt secundum Statuta hujus Regni: Sub poenâ Decem Solidorum quoties offenderit, Collegio solvendorum; modò eâ de re à Praeside, aut Pro-Praeside,
& Censoribus praemonitus fuerit. Nemo mulctam, sibi pro dilicto se∣cundum Statuta inflictam, solvere re∣cufabit; sub poenâ violatae Fidei Colle∣gio praestitae. Quoniam Pharmacopolae, & Chirur∣gi, praecipuè Chyrurgi, saepe ad Medicos Urinas aegrotantium deferunt, petunt∣que ut ab Urinarum Inspectione ali∣quid aegris suis prescribant; ac deinde, sub hoc Consultationis praetextu, reli∣quam Curationis telam ipsimet pro Ar∣bitrio pertexunt; quicquid inde quae∣stûs sive lucri est id omne sibi arripien∣tes, Medicis verò nihil praeter exilem illam & jejunam Urinarum spectanda∣rum mercedem afferentes. Idcirco Statuimus & Ordinamus, Ut nemo, sive Socius, sive Candidatus, sive Permissus, Consilii quidquam im∣pertiat istiusmodi veteratoriis, Impo∣storibus super Urinarum nudâ Inspe∣ctione, nisi simul ad aegrum vocetur; ut ibidem pro re natâ, idonea Medi∣camenta, ab honesto aliquo Phama∣copolâ
componenda, praescribat. Volumus praeterea; ut singulis Schaedulis; sive Receptis (ut vocant) diem Mensis, & nomen Aegri, suum∣que quisque adscribat. Ridiculum quidem est & insulsum, ex Urinarum solummodò Inspectione, sive de Morbi Genere & Naturâ, sive de Aegrotantis Statu ac Conditione, Aruspicum & conjectorum more, velle quidquem certi, solidique divi∣nare. Monemus igitur omnes Medicos, ut hâc in re Multò cautiùs in poste∣rum se gerant, quam antehac à ple∣risque factitare solitum, & hanc ob causam, omnibus Medicinam exercen∣tibus interdictum volumus, ne Idiotis istis & Mulierculis Aegrotantium ma∣tulas circumferentibus, aliquod Me∣dicamentum praescribant; nisi aut ip∣sum aegrum priùs rectè noverint, aut saltem ab iis, qui consilium petunt, de Morbo, ejusque circumstantiis, & planè & plenè instructi fuerint.
Quippe hac ratione, & dignitatem Medicinae meliùs tuebimur, & multò aptiùs certiusque Remedia pericilitan∣tibus profutura excogitabimus. Denique Statuimus & Ordinamus; Ut, quicunque admittuntur in Socie∣tatem Collegii, subscriptis nominibus polliceantur se Statuta omnia praedi∣cta diligentèr observaturos; aut Mul∣ctas, contra facientibus inflictas, non invito animo persoluturos. Si ad hanc normam, Collegium prudenti consilio Praesidis, Electorum & Censorum gubernetur; debito & obedienti caeterorum officio honeste∣tur & exterminatis indoctis, profli∣gatisque odiosis Impostoribus, scientiâ decoretur, certissimum est, & floren∣tissimum futurum hoc nostrum Col∣legium in perpetuum, & universae eti∣am Reipublicae (quantum nostra offi∣cia attinet) rectè providèque consul∣tum iri. Quare per Fidem illam Collegio datam, Socios omnes hortamur, & obtestamur; ut quoquoversum dili∣gentèr
prospiciant, & providentèr a∣gant; nec quemquam respectu persona∣rum habito, admittant in Societatem Collegii: sed ad Laudem, Decus, Ho∣norem & Perpetuitatem Societatis, om∣nia decernant; quoniam certum est, Collegium nostrum nullâ re firmiùs sta∣biliri posse, & continuari, quam bo∣nis Legibus, Probis, Gubernatorum Moribus, & Collegarum singulari Vir∣tute atque eruditione. FINIS.
THE Statutes (or By-Laws) OF THE COLLEDGE OF Physicians of London.
WHereas by the Private Grace of Our most Sovereign King HENRY VIII. and by the Publick Decrees of Parliament, It is or∣dained, That a Colledge of Physicians of London, be Established for the Honour of the Kingdom and the Health of the Publick, that it be defended with Pri∣viledges, enrich'd with Possessions, dig∣nified with Electors, governed by a Presi∣dent and Censors, and directed by Sta∣tutes or By-Laws, and endowed with a Power of making them a-new; should be assisted with Consiliarii or Assistants, and perpetuated by Learning, it seemed also most advisable to Ʋs, That We prescribe first who are to be the Electors, and what their Office is, also who is to be Presi∣dent, and after what manner, and of whom he is to be chosen, by what Law o∣bliged, and what his Office and Power is; and lastly, what his Place and Dignity is; and then who are to be the Consili∣arii
or Assistants, and what on their faith given, is to be performed by them; and what their Office, Place, and Power is; who are to be made Censors or Gover∣nours of Learning, Manners, and also Medicines; and what Office upon Oath is to be performed by them; what is the Office of a Treasurer, Register, and Bea∣dle; lastly, what becomes the rest for their own honour, and the glory of the Colledge, and by what Covenant they are obliged; if any Statutes are to be made, or if any are to be abrogated, after what manner that ought to be done; what is the Form of the Comitia, or Meet∣ings, Examinations, and Admissions, what account to be had of an Offence with others, and what universally of right be∣longs to all persons and business of the Colledge; for nothing is durable, that wanteth Reason, Form, and Order.
CHAP. I. Of Creating the Electors. WE Constitute therefore and Or∣dain, That out of the number of the Fellows, Eight only Elect∣ors be created, who for gravity, learning, manners, and age, excel the rest; and that they be dignified with the Degree of Doctor, and are by birth English men, whose Office it shall be, by the Authority of the Colledge, the day after St. Michael, if conveniently it can be done, but if for some great impediments, that will not be lawful, then on some other day for that business more convenient, so that it be within a week from the time appointed in the greater Comitia or Meetings, to choose a President out of the number of the Electors, if the President of the fore∣going year having performed his annual Office, be remaining; but if he be want∣ing, as soon as that can conveniently be
done, to substitute another, at the most within Twenty days after he has been wanting; but we understand a President or an Elector to be wanting, if he be ei∣ther dead, or expelled the Colledge, or departed from the City with his family, and he be wanting for a whole year, unless he be in the service of the Prince. If one or more of the Elect have been so wanting, let one or more by a New Ele∣ction be substituted in his or their place, out of the rest of the Fellows, who shall be of the same Nation, Degree, Manners, Learning, and Rank, within Thirty, or at most Forty days; but so that at those Co∣mitia or Meetings, only the Electors be present, to the intent that a more free Election be made, and a more just exami∣nation of manners, wisdom, gravity, and learning, all which vertues are chiefly required by the Statutes of the Kingdom in an Elector. He that is to be chosen, shall first be ex∣amined by the Electors, as is provided for by the Statutes of the Kingdom, then let him be chosen by the consent of them all if it may be, if not by the greatest part;
but if their Votes are even, by the senior part. And if by reason of the reigning of a Plague, or some other cause, the Electors are out of Town, so that a certain day can∣not be appointed, then it shall be lawful for the President, at what time and place conveniently may be, to call the E∣lectors. If any of the Electors have left the Ci∣ty, and made his aboad with his Fa∣mily for the space of a whole year, in any place beyond seven miles from the City, he, unless he be the Kings Physician, or otherwise detained in the service of the Prince, shall lose his place among the E∣lectors, and another shall be substituted by the President and Electors; yet we will that he keep his place and dignity in the Colledge, if in the mean time he shall certifie the President of the cause of his absence. He shall promise that he will give his Consent or Vote for none to be created President or Elector, unless according to the form of the Statute, and that he per∣fectly know and understand his gravity,
learning, honest behaviour, decent age, and sincere affection to the Colledge and the Common-wealth, and readiness to perform his duty. CHAP. II. Of the President and his Office. WHo is to be President shall be ap∣pointed for a year, and must be of the number of Electors, and whom the other Electors present, either all or most, shall judge fit, in respect of time, busi∣ness, and person; and it shall be done at that time of the year which is already ap∣pointed, when we treated of the Electors, to wit, the day after St. Michael, if con∣veniently it may be done, &c. as before in the Chapter of Creating the Electors. It is provided for and determined, if the Suffrages are equal, that party shall carry it, in which the greater number of the Seniors shall be; but if these also shall be equal, that shall prevail, to which the
Old President, or he being dead or ab∣sent, the born President inclines. We call the born President, the Senior of the E∣lectors, who though he carry the name of President, yet hath no power to make or change Statutes; but in administring and performing the Office of a President in other things relating to the business of the Colledge, let him have a full power according to the true meaning of the Sta∣tutes. If any Elector refuse the Office of a President conferred on him, he shall be fined forty shillings, unless he be the Kings Physician. The Covenant or Faith given by the President. HE shall promise, That he will to his power endeavour that the honour of the Colledge be preserved, the Statutes thereof without fraud observed, and that he will act all things for the health of the Publick, and the honest Profit of the Colledge.
The President of the former year, if he be present, shall demand the Faith from the New President, or one of the Consiliarii or Assistants, especially the Senior, if he be present; or these being absent, the Senior of the Electors then present. He that shall demand his suretyship, let him hold forth the Ensigns of Govern∣ment, The Cushion, to wit, of Honour, the Book and Caduceus or Mace, and let him say, We give to thee the Authority of a President, and deliver the Cushion of Honour, the Book of Knowledge, and the Caduceus or Mace of Government and Prudence, that your Excellency and all the other Colleagues, may understand our Colledge firmly to be establish'd by Knowledge and Prudence; wherefore that you may not forget, you shall take care that the Book and Mace, as a sign of Know∣ledge and Prudence, be carried by the Beadle before you in all solemn Meetings, Funeral Ceremonies, and at other times and places convenient, that what honour requires, that use may confirm.
The Manner of Laying down the Office. THe Duty of Governing being dis∣charged, let the President laying down his Office, having finished what Prologue he please, say, I lay down the Authority of Governing, and in the name of all return it into your hands, some other, to wit, the Senior of the Con∣siliarii or Assistants chiefly; or these be∣ing absent, the Senior Elector present; that it may be lawful to whom the power of Choice belongs, to elect and substitute whom they please: therefore I return to you the Cushion of Honour, the Book of Knowledge, and the Mace of prudent Government, and I wish all happiness to the Colledge and you all. Which done, to whom the power is conferred, let him propose for choice, whom they judge most fit for that Office, but let him be chose after that manner which in the beginning of this Chapter is ordained, and let him with a loud voice, and by name pronounce him, who is chosen
according to the Statutes, elected for President, and command that all esteem him for the President; lastly he shall demand his Suretyship from him in the same form as is before-mentioned. Let the Office of the President be to appoint Meetings, but after what man∣ner shall be spoken by and by, when we de∣termine of the Comitia or Meetings, and also to propose the cause of Meetings, to receive the opinion of every one, and to determine for the major part, and to ex∣clude factions and partios. Let him, with the rest whom that mat∣ter shall concern, choose the Electors, As∣sistants, and Censors, of learning, man∣ners, and medicines. In choosing Colleagues let him first re∣ceive the Suffrages of others, afterwards give his own, and determine for the greater part. Let him compose differences between the Colleagues, but that by common ad∣vice and opinion of the Electors and Cen∣sors separately made use of, and in that manner which afterwards in the Chapter of the Consiliarii or Assistants shall be spo∣ken more fully.
Moreover, let him take care that the Common Seal be safely kept in a Chest, he shall sign all things to which the o∣ther Fellows according to their duty and the Statute have consented. If any Books are given to the Colledge, he shall take care that they be placed in the Library, and at the years end, let an Accompt of them be given to the New President, and let them be shewed to him by name in the Index. If there be any Revenue or yearly in∣come, by the Lands of the Colledge, if any thing be given to the Colledge, if any thing come by any other names, let him take care that it be kept in the Common Chest, whereof let him have one Key, and likewise each of the Consiliarii or Assist∣ants one. Let him require an Acompt of the Receipts and Disbursements of the last year, from the Treasurer and other Offi∣cers of the Colledge, in presence of the other Electors at that time in Town; all whom we would have summoned to be at the making up the Accompts if con∣veniently they can; but let him more e∣specially
take care that the Statutes be diligently observed, and read in the Colledge, either by him or the Register, or some other, as it shall seem good to him; to wit, in that manner which is af∣terwards provided and appointed in the Statutes. CHAP. III. Of the Pro-President. IT shall be lawful for the President be∣ing detained in the service of the Prince, or in the cure of some great No∣bleman, or oppressed by the multitude of other business, to choose and substitute for himself a Pro-President; but let him be the born President if conveniently by age, business, or health, it may be: If other∣wise, one of the Electors who excels in gra∣vity, sound judgement, experience, di∣ligence, and cheerfulness of acting; ac∣cording to the will and pleasure of the President.
His Office shall be to supply the place of the absent President, in acting and administring all business of the Colledge which cannot conveniently be performed by the President. Let his Place and Dignity be accord∣ing to his degree and seniority, unless when the President is wanting; for then he shall possess the place of the President, but only in the Colledge, to wit, in the ordinary place of meetings. But we un∣derstand the President to be absent, not only if he be without the City and Sub∣urbs, but also if detained by any dis∣ease, or more weighty business in the Ci∣ty, he cannot be present. But in these cases we will that he make known his ab∣sence either by a Letter writ with his own hand, or by the Beadle of the Col∣ledge. His Office shall continue according to the business. He shall give his faith, if the Electors think it fit, that he accord∣ing to his ability will take care of the business of the Colledge committed to him, and will diligently act all things for the honour and profit of the Colledge,
and will act nothing unless with the judge∣ment and advice of the President or As∣sistants, and those Fellows whom by the Statutes it shall concern. CHAP. IV. Of the Consiliarii or Assistants. THe day after St. Michael, if con∣veniently it can be done, &c. as before in the Chapter of Creating the Ele∣ctors, in the ordinary Meetings presently after the Election of a President, let the same Electors choose two for the Consiliarii or Assistants, out of their own Order, that shall be fit for this Office, with the as∣sent either of all or the greater number of the Electors then present; if their suffrages shall be even, that part shall carry it, wherein there shall be more of the Seniors; if these also shall be e∣qual, then that to which the President shall incline.
They shall give their faith that they will honestly and justly, as becometh good men, laying aside all affection, perform their duty. Their duty is always to attend the Pre∣sident in the greater Comitia or Meet∣ings, to assist with their labour and counsel, where need shall be; never to be absent, unless some extrardinary mat∣ter compel; and lest at that time the place should be void, let him that shall be wanting substitute in his place ano∣another Elector, till he shall return; but with the consent of the President, or he being absent, of the Pro-President. If any strife or controversie concerning any doubtful matter, or the genuine in∣terpretation of some Statute, or any dis∣cord of this sort arise among the Col∣leagues, we will all that matter be qui∣etly and calmly composed by the Presi∣dent, Assistants, and Censors, or by the greater part of them. Likewise, if between the President and Colleagues any controversie shall arise, we will that the whole matter be decided by the Assistants and Censors,
or by the greater part of them; but if it cannot be so composed, then we will that other Electors be joyned also to those fore-mentioned Arbiters, that by the suffrages of all these, or of the great∣er part, the whole matter in controversie may be decided. And we will that this rule be obser∣ved in decently suppressing all wran∣glings of the Colleagues, for by this means we hope it will (which especially is to be wish'd) that brawling, scoldings, and contentions, be avoided, and bro∣therly love with a sweet consent of minds and wills daily grow together, and be consirmed for ever. If one of the Assistants either die, or be otherwise wanting, before he hath compleated the year, let another within fifteen days be deputed. Let none refuse the Office of an Assist∣ant under the penalty of Forty Shillings, unless he be the Kings Physician. As often as the President shall ask their advice, let them be ready, or else let them pay each of them Three Shillings and four pence, unless some urgent mat∣ter
shall hinder, whereof when they next return, they shall better certifie the Pre∣sident. CHAP. V. Of the Censors. AFter the President chosen and the Assistants, presently in the same Meetings we appoint and ordain, That every year four men, learned and grave, be chosen, whether they shall be Electors or Fellows, whom we will have named Censors or Governours of the Colledge of London. Let their Election be by the Suffrages of the President and whole Society, or of the greater part secretly received. Let their Office be to inquire after all persons practising Physick, whether they be our Countrey-men or Foreigners, thorow the City and Suburbs, and with∣in Seven miles in circuit thereof, to ex∣amine, correct, and govern them, and
if need be of a Law Suit, together with the President and Treasurer, to persecute, to inquire their Methods of Cure, to condemn their Medicines, to search the Apothecaries Shops, to judge of their Medicines, to burn, or any other ways to destroy the corrupt; and if the Apothe∣caries withstand or oppose, to refer the matter to the President and the Colledge, and to perform all these things for the health of the Publick, and the honour of the Colledge. The Oath of the Censors or Governours. THey shall swear before the Presi∣dent, That they will decree none to be admitted into the Colledge, but whom, all affection laid aside, they shall judge fit, both for learning and man∣ners; neither to approve any man or any medicine, for hire, intreaty, or favour; and in other things honestly to perform their Office, as God shall help them and the Holy Gospel.
Let no Fellow refuse the Office of a Censor, under the penalty of Forty shillings, unless he be the Kings Phy∣sician. CHAP. VI. Of the Manner and Time of the Comitia or Meetings, and of the Caduceator or Beadle. THree days before the solemn Meet∣ings are to be, or the day before that day, if the matter be urgent, by the Authority of the President all the Colleagues are to be summoned by the Beadle, or the servant of the Presidents, that they be present at the Meetings, to be such a day, hour, and place prescribed. Whither, when they are come, let each seat themselves in that order which shall afterwards be spoken; we call Comitia Meetings, or as King Henry in his
Diploma nameth them Congregations of the Collegues; and we judge these Meet∣ings solemn or the greater legitimate, at which all the Collegues in the City are admonished by the Beadle to be present, and in which twelve Fellows at the least are present, beside the President. Let this be the manner of Summons, Mr. Pre∣sident intreateth your Excellency, worthy Doctor, that you be present at a Meeting held such a Month, day, hour, and place, prescribed by the President. Lastly, let him subscribe it after this manner, A. V. B. that is, By your Authority Beadle. Let the Beadle be an honest man, and let him promise, that he will faithfully and diligently serve the President and the Colledge in all business belonging to the Colledge without fraud or guile. Moreover, let him promise that he will neither for hire, intreaty, or favour, divulge the secrets of the Colledge to any one. Let his Office be to write scrowls of admonition to summon all the Collegues to the Meetings, to provide and keep all
things clean and neat against their come∣ing, not to be absent from the Meetings, faithfully to bring and carry things re∣ceived from the President for the use of the Colledge; to hunt out what-some-e∣ver, whether Physicians or Empiricks and Impostors, and to give in their Names to the President, and at the Pre∣sidents or Censors commands, to give them a Summons; to burn bad Medi∣cines, or otherwise to destroy them, to be present at Feasts and Funerals, to car∣ry the Ensigns of Honour and perform o∣ther things which lie on a servant as his duty. Let a salary of Twelve pounds yearly be paid by the Treasurer to the Beadle. We will also that from every Candi∣date and Permissive, four shillings year∣ly be bestowed on him for a reward; be∣sides in all admissions and fines, which exceed twenty shillings, and Anatomies, three shillings and four pence be paid him.
Of Summoning the Collegues to the Meeting. WE appoint all the Collegues, who shall be in the City or Suburbs, to be present at all greater Meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, un∣less some great impediment hinder. What relates to those lesser Congregations which are held every Month, and at other times, it shall be free for the rest of the Collegues (except those Six whom af∣terwards we shall name in the Chapter of the Ordinary times of Meeting) ei∣ther to be present or absent, according to their pleasure, unless they are bidden by the Summons of the President or Pro-President, to be there. But if any fore-warned by the Beadle himself, or by a Note left by him at his house, shall not come, he shall pay Two shillings for the use of the Colledge, un∣less he shall be excused by sickness, or he be Two miles out of Town at the least.
They who shall be absent from the Meetings on that day when the President and Censors are to be chosen, unless up∣on some weighty matter, to be approved by the President or Pro-President, or As∣sistants and Censors, shall pay for the use of the Colledge Three shillings four pence; nay he shall pay One shilling, who shall not come before the Clock strike Three. Because very many lawfully summoned from the President by the Beadle, either neglect or despise to be present at the for aid Meetings, whereby it often hap∣pens that the Conventions are made void, and the other Fellows obeying the Summons of the President, to no purpose neglect their own private busi∣ness; therefore we appoint and ordain, That if any Fellow, summoned after the manner aforesaid, shall refuse to come to the greater appointed Meetings, and shall four times continually fail in this manner, and in the mean time shall not give the reason of his absence, to be ap∣proved of by the President or Pro-Presi∣dent, with the Assistants and Censors,
let another Collegue (as soon as it shall seem good to the Colledge) be put into his place. Let all the Statutes be divided into three parts or sections, the first part comprehends all those things which be∣long to the Electors, to the President, and Pro-President, to the Consiliarii or Assistants, to the Censors or Governours, to the Comitia or Meetings, and other things, till you come to the Ninth Chap∣ter, which treateth of the Office of the Treasurer. The second part comprehends those Statutes which belong to the Treasurer and Register, to the number of Fellows and Candidates, to their Examinati∣ons, Elections, and Admissions, to the Order of the Permissives, and their Of∣fice, and the other things, even to the Two and twentieth Chapter, which treat∣eth of the Penal or Moral Statutes. The third part shall contain the Penal or Moral Statutes, and according to this threefold partition of Statutes, they may be read thorow in all greater Meet∣ings, except on the day of the Meet∣ings
of St. Michael, at which time the Election of Officers are appointed. Let the Fellows, Candidates, and Permissives, be present at the Reading of the Statutes, as many as can be there. And these our Statutes shall be read after the aforesaid manner, either by the President himself, or Pro-President (if they please) or by the Register, if he be present; but if peradventure, the Regi∣ster, either obliged by business, or detain∣ed by a Disease, or hindred by some o∣ther grievous matter, shall not be pre∣sent, then according to the pleasure of the President or Pro-President, some o∣ther of the Fellows shall be appointed for that time; who may read thorow that part of the Statutes. Yet in the mean time we will that it be taken care of and provided for, that if any more weighty matters are to be transacted in those Meetings, it may be free for the President or Pro-President, at his pleasure, either wholly to omit this reading of the Statutes for the time, or to read, or command to be read only some part.
CHAP. VII. Of the Ordinary and Extraor∣dinary Times of Meetings, and other Things pertaining to the Reason of the Meetings. LEt the fix'd or settled Meetings be kept at four seasons of the year, e∣qually distant. The first the day after St. Michael, if conveniently it may be done, &c. as is said before. The second the day after St. Thomas, if conveniently, &c. The third the day after Palm Sunday, if, &c. The fourth the day after the Nativity of St. John Baptist, if conveniently, &c. And these are all the ordinary or fix'd Meetings, which also may be called so∣lemn or greater.
And beside the fix'd or ordinary Meet∣ings, it shall also be lawful for the Presi∣dent to summon likewise other solemn or greater extraordinary Meetings, accord∣ing to the necessity or dignity of the mat∣ter happening. And in all these solemn Meetings we will that twelve Fellows at least be pre∣sent, besides the President and Pro-Pre∣sident. But if some urgent necessity, as the raging of a Pestilence, &c. or some weighty affair, happen to be dispatched at the command of the Prince; and that peradventure in such a time, wherein so many Fellows shall not be present in the City, then indeed you must obey necessi∣ty, and in such a case the whole matter is to be left to the prudence and judge∣ment of the President or Pro-President, that as many as shall be in the City, he take care that all those be summoned by the Beadle, to be present at the Meetings; and in those greater Meetings we will that the ordinary Elections and Admissi∣ons of new Fellows, Candidates, and Per∣missives, be made.
But for what belongs to the Examina∣tions of Fellows, Candidates, or Per∣missives, those may rightly be porformed, either in those greater Meetings, or also in the other lesser Conventions, accord∣ing to the pleasure of the President or Pro-President. In all Meetings let the President or Pro-President expound the cause of the Convention, let him observe what each speak in their order, and receive the Suf∣frages: neither let any depart unless leave first obtained, before the President or Pro-President hath dissolved the Meet∣ings in these eloquent words, We dis∣charge these Meetings. There are also other Meetings, which are called lesser, such as are held every Month, and at other times, as some sud∣den occasion shall require; according to the reason of things and persons. In these those that are admitted into the Colledge are examined, also the Af∣fairs of Quacks and Impostors, and of all persons practising Physick ill, are dis∣cussed by the President and Censors, and
they punished according to their deserts; and other business of that kind are treat∣ed of. In these lesser Meetings, we do not re∣quire that so many Fellows be present as are required in the greater and solemn Meetings; it shall suffice if in these Mr. President, the four Censors and Re∣gister be present. But it is necessary that all the Censors are present, according to the Statutes of the Kingdom; provided they be lawful∣ly summoned by the Beadle: wherefore lest the rest meet in vain, we ordain an absent Censor to be fined Ten shillings, unless he certifie the President before∣hand of the cause of his absence. Least any controversie or reproach should arise, we must act in all Meetings with the highest modesty and the greatest gravity; for certainly scolding is filthy in private, but most filthy in publick Meetings, especially among those who are judged to have acquired honest man∣ners out of good disciplines.
Therefore let none propose or speak any thing publickly in the Colledge, un∣less with his hat off, and leave first ob∣tained from the President, to whom alone his speech is to be directed. But if many shall begin to speak toge∣ther, let the Junior give way to the Se∣nior. Let every one speak shortly and gravely, without prolix babbling; and at the admonition of the President be si∣lent. And its lawful for none to disturb him that is speaking, but the President or Pro-President, or the senior of the Censors then present; whose Office let it be to admonish every one of their duty. But let every one speak his judgement to the Matter proposed, once only and in his order, unless by leave again obtained from the President. Let the other Fellows be attent, and not disturb him that is speaking, or the hearers, with their private discourse whis∣perings or noise; nnd let silence always be made at the nod of the President: who
shall act contrary let him be punished Two shillings, presently to be paid. In matters doubtful and of great mo∣ment, let the delegates be chose at the pleasure of the President, who may dis∣cuss the matter on every side, and re∣late it to the Colledge in each Meeting, af∣ter the President hath opened the cause of the Convention. Let the Register with a loud voice relate what was done in the last Meetings, that (those things being expunged, if any things are to be mended or correct∣ed) they may at last be writ in the Book of Annals. Let none propose to gather the Suf∣frages, but the President or Pro-Pre∣sident. In all Elections let the Votes be carri∣ed silently and secretly, by pease or beans, in other business of the Colledge as it seem good to the President or Pro-Pre∣sident.
CHAP. VIII. Of Making and Abrogating of Statutes, and of Levying of Fines. LEt few Statutes be establish'd, and those confirmed either by Faith gi∣ven, or Fine. Let the Mulct be small but inevita∣ble, let the least Mulct be a Shilling. To make any Statute, two Meetings shall suffice, but to abrogate not under three. We appoint and ordain that all Fines which after what manner soever are im∣posed, by the President or Pro-President and four Censors, or by the greater part of the Fellows, go only to the use of the Colledge, and not to the profit of any private person; yet those payments of Money are excepted, which by the Sta∣tutes of the Colledge are otherways grant∣ed
to the Officers. We will that these Mulcts be forthwith paid, or at least a deposite given, such as the President shall desire, to secure the present money. CHAP. IX. The Office of the Treasurer. HE shall receive the Revenue and Profits which yearly accrue to the Colledge, and in his custody safely shall keep for the use of the Colledge. He shall take care of the Ʋtensils and other Necessaries of the Colledge, as of∣ten as need shall be. He shall, as well as he can, safely and decently keep the Goods thereof, Books, Houshold-stuff, and other Ornaments ap∣pertaining to the glory thereof. If any thing be to be repaired in the Buildings of the Colledge, he shall take care that it be seasonably done.
He together with the President and Censors, shall prosecute the Controversies and Law-suits of the Colledge. He shall pay to the Officers of the Col∣ledge every ones Salary or Stipend due according to the Statutes, at the four u∣sual Seasons of the Year. He shall give in his Accompts twice every Year to the President and Electors, if he be required to it and fore-warned. He shall give a perfect Accompt for the whole Year last past, within a Month af∣ter the Feast of St. Michael; to wit, on that day which the President shall assign him. He shall restore to the President and Electors the whole sum of Money which at that time shall be over remaining, and the other Goods, Houshold-stuff, and the Ʋtensils of the Colledge which have been in his custody. He shall be bound in a Bond to the President and Society, on the same day that he is admitted to his Office, that he faithfully pay the Wages due to the Offi∣cers of the Colledge within a Week after
the compleat making up his Accompt for that Year. In repairing the Buildings of the Col∣ledge, or in buying things necessary for the use of the Colledge, he shall not lay out above Forty Shillings without the will and consent of the President or Pro-President. To the Treasurer for a Salary shall be paid yearly out of the Revenues of the Colledge the sum of Forty Shillings. Moreover, We appoint and ordain, That from each person admitted into the Society of the Colledge, also from every one that shall be admitted into the Order of the Candidates, or into the number of Permissives, he shall receive Six Shillings and eight pence at the time of their Admission. He shall give his Faith, That he will perform his Office faithfully according to the Statutes, and that he will act all things for the honour and profit of the Colledge, and that he will faithfully give up his Accompt at the Summons of the President.
CHAP. X. Of the Register. LEt the Office of the Register be after this manner, To be present at all Meetings of the Colledge, whether great∣er or lesser, being lawfully and seasonably admonish'd by the Beadle of the Colledge, or the servant of the President or Pro-President, on the penalty of Ten Shil∣lings. Whatsoever shall be there acted, ratifi∣ed, and establish'd, by the consent of the President and the greater part of the Fel∣lows present (unless it be matter of small moment, and unworthy to be taken notice of) all that he shall faithfully set down, in the beginning of the next following Meetings let him read it over, and af∣terwards (it being corrected, if any things are to be amended) let him enter it in∣to the Register of the Colledge.
But if he shall be hindred by sickness or more weighty business, so that he can∣not be present; then it shall be lawful for him to substitute some other Fellow for the time, who may signifie the cause of his absence to the President, and dili∣gently supply his place. The Forms of Letters writ to the Colledge or from the Colledge, and all o∣ther things that are acted, let him enter into the Register Book. For an Annual Stipend, there shall be yearly paid to the Register Forty Shil∣lings, to be accompted to him from the Treasurer, out of the Revenue of the Colledge, by equal parts, at the four usu∣al times of this Kingdom. From every one who are permitted to practise Phisick, or received into the Or∣der of the Candidates, or admitted into the number of the Fellows, shall be paid at the very time, either of Permission or Admission, the sum of Six Shillings and eight pence to the Register, and Five Shillings more for writing their Names in the Register Book.
As often as it shall happen that any one by the Sentence of the President or Pro-President and Censors, be fined in any notable sum of money to be paid to the Colledge, by every one so punish'd Three Shillings and four pence shall be paid to the Register. If any fined in any sum of money to be paid for the use of the Colledge, shall not together and at once pay the whole fine, but shall put off the payment ap∣pointed for some days, and so shall pay it piece-meal, for each of those payments so made in parts, Three Shillings and four pence shall be paid to the Register; for we judge his Office a troublesome bur∣den. He shall give his Faith that he will duly perform his Office according to the Statutes for the honour and profit of the Colledge, and all things which have been acted either in greater or lesser Meetings, without fraud faithfully insert into the Register Book.
CHAP. XI. Of the Candidates. WE appoint and ordain, That the number of Candidates do not exceed Twelve; We will that none be admitted into that Order, who is not a Doctor in Phisick, and by Nation an Englishman, and hath practised Phisick for four years. But if he has attained the Degree of Doctor in any Foreign Ʋniversity, We will, That before he be admitted to Examination, he bring forth his Diplo∣ma or Letters Testimonial true and au∣thentick of that Ʋniversity, and shew them to the Colledge; and besides that let him have and bring a Testimonial of his Incorporation from one of our own Ʋni∣versities. We will moreover and ordain, That each Candidate and Permissive, before
they be admitted, visit all the Fellows of the Colledge twice, to ask leave, to wit, the first time before any Examinati∣on, but the second the course of Examina∣tions being finish'd. The Faith required of the Candidates. YOu shall give your Faith, That you will observe the Statutes of the Colledge, and to your power endea∣vour that the Honour thereof be preser∣ved intire, nor at any time shall you consult, or entertain familiarity with a∣ny one who studies in word or deed to subvert the State of the Colledge; but in all things which belong to the honour and profit of the Colledge, you shall promote with your advice, aid, and assistance. You shall give your Faith, That you will in all things lawful and honest, be obedient to Mr. President or Pro-Presi∣dent and Electors, that you will give place to the Senior in the Colledge (ac∣cording to the Statutes) and respect him with due honour.
You shall come to the Colledge at the command of Mr. President or Pro-Pre∣sident and Censors, as often as you shall be admonish'd and sent for by the Beadle. You shall be present at all Anatomies, unless detained by some great impedi∣ment, to be approved by the President and Censors. Neither for intreaty, nor rewards, nor on any other cause, shall you give Medi∣cines which cause Abortion or Miscarri∣age, nor Poisons of any kind for destru∣ction, or to an ill use; neither shall you teach them any one, whom you suspect will abuse them. You shall by name accuse none who is admitted into the Colledge, of ignorance or ill practice, or publickly reproach them. You shall persecute by all honest means the unlearned, Empiricks and Impostors, and their names you shall give in to the President or Censors; neither shall you keep company with Empiricks and others not licensed by the Colledge; neither shall you by any means frequent their
Meetings, to the detriment or infamy of the Colledge. The secrets of the Colledge you shall divulge to none, that is not of the Col∣ledge. You shall give your faith that you will neither by Letters from great Men, nor by price, nor by any other unlawful means, circumvent the Society of the Colledge; and that you will to your power do all things in the Art of Phisick for the ho∣nour of the Colledge and the Publick good. We appoint and ordain, That the Per∣missive or Licentiates, and also the Can∣didates, diligently observe our Statutes and Decrees, be obedient to the Presi∣dent, Electors, and Censors, and the Mulcts imposed on them for defaults they readily pay. Besides, they shall not refuse plainly and nakedly to reveal those their Medi∣cines which they call Secrets or Arcana, and are wont to use in their practice, as often as they are required to do so by the President and Censors; who shall
obstinately act contrary, shall be punish'd at the pleasure of the President and Cen∣sors. Every Candidate shall pay at the time of his Admission Four pounds to the use of the Colledge, and Ten shillings for the proper use of the President; but to the Treasurer Six shillings and eight pence; also to the Register for his due Salary Six shillings and eight pence, and to him moreover Five other shillings, for inserti∣on of his Name into the Book of Annals; and besides to the Beadle of the Colledge Three shillings and four pence. Because many flock hither to practise, of the number of which there are very many, who coming out of their Ʋniver∣sities before their due time, fly to places beyond the Seas, that in foreign Nations by a shorter space and lesser charge, they may creep to the degree of Doctor, then they could attain at home in our Ʋniver∣sities. We therefore appoint, That whoever shall be admitted either into the Society
of the Colledge, or into the Order of the Candidates, or into the number of the Permissive: If he has taken the degree of Doctor abroad, he at the time of his Ad∣mission shall pay double to the Colledge, President, Treasurer, Register, and other Officers of the Colledge, then those are wont to pay who are created Doctors in our own Ʋniversities. Also whoever is created Doctor in our Ʋniversities, yet if he anticipate, by more hastily acquiring that Degree then is the fit time due to that dignity; that is, if he made Doctor either before he has been seven whole years Master in the Arts, or has been so long Batchelor in Phisick, he shall pay double more to the Colledge, President, and to the other aforesaid Officers of the Colledge, then they are wont who accord∣ing to the laudable Laws and Customs of our Ʋniversities, at the time prefix'd, and with more mature judgement, ascend to the degree of Doctor. We will, That all Candidates and Permissives summoned by the Beadle,
be present at every one of our Meetings; that if they know any unlawfully and ig∣norantly exercising Practice, they sig∣nifie their Names to the President and Censors, and also that they hear the Read∣ing of the Statutes. Let them likewise pay, if occasion be, or the necessity of the Colledge urges, as Fellows; so they be required thereto. The year compleat, let the Candidates move and ask the President to be admit∣ted into the number of the Fellows, if so be it may conveniently be done, ac∣cording to the Statutes. CHAP. XII. Of the Fellows. WE appoint and ordain, That the number of the Fellows exceed not Thirty, and we will that above this certain and determinate number the Phi∣sicians in ordinary to the King, Queen,
and Prince, be admitted as Honorary, and to be reckoned Supernumeraries. We will moreover, That no body be admitted into the Society of the Colledge, who have not been first for a whole year of the number of the Candidates, or pub∣lickly read Phisick in some Ʋniversity of England, or hath been formerly Doctor of the Chair (as they say) in some Ʋni∣versity of this Kingdom, or has been the Kings Phisician in Ordinary. Every Fellow at the time of his ad∣mission shall pay to the Colledge, Presi∣dent, Treasurer, Register, and Beadle, as is appointed before concerning the Can∣didates; but all payments shall be dou∣bled on those conditions which are above mentioned. We appoint also, That all Fellows at the time of admission have Letters Pa∣tents, signed with the Seal of the Col∣ledge, and be obliged by this given faith. YOu shall endeavour to your power that the State of the Colledge be
perpetuated; the Statutes of the Colledge you shall keep, you shall obey the Presi∣dent in those things which relate to the honour and perpetuity of the Colledge. You shall not give what may cause a∣bortion, or take away or hinder concep∣tion, nor poison to an ill end, nay in∣deed you shall not so much as teach them, where there is a suspicion of an ill design. You shall determine none to be chose into the Colledge, unless whom, laying a∣side all affection, you shall judge for knowledge and manners suitable. You shall read diligently within a year the five first Books of Galen concerning Simple Medicine, and all the Books of the use of the parts. You shall persecute by all honest means the unlearned, Empericks, and Impostors; you shall give in their Names to the Pre∣sident, Pro-President, or Censors. You shall also give your faith that you have practised Phisick for four years, or have read publickly in some Ʋniversity. Also you shall give your faith, that you will with great diligence observe the Sta∣tute
concerning the publick dissection of humane bodies, whensoever you shall be summoned by the President or Pro-Pre∣sident. Lastly, You shall truly and on good faith say, what is your Countrey. Letters of Admission. KNow all men, That we A. B. Doctor of Phisick and President of the Colledge of Phisicians of London, to∣gether with the consent of the Fellows thereof, by the Authority granted to us from our Lord the King and Parliament, have examined, approved, and into our Colledge chose the learned and honest man C. D. of Kent, in the most Flourishing Ʋniversity of Oxford or Cambridge, Doctor of Phisick, and thereby have granted the free Faculty and Licence of exercising the Knowledge and Art of Phi∣sick, according to the Form of the Sta∣tutes publish'd to that purpose; and more∣over we have bestowed the use and profit of all Advantages, Liberties, and Pri∣viledges,
which by the Authority aforesaid are already granted to our Colledge, and which for the future may be granted. For the truth and testimony whereof we have caused our Common Seal to be set to these presents. Given at London in our Colledge the seventh day of May Anno Domini 1647. * If any of the Collegues hath applied himself to Religion or the Priesthood, af∣ter he hath been chosen into the Colledge, let him not be called to the Colledge; that we may not seem to recall him to the Pra∣ctice of Phisick, whom Religion and the Law Ecclesiastick has abandoned from the Office of a Phisician. * Neither do we think it honest for a Clergyman or Preacher, among other things, to meddle with Womens busines∣ses and diseases. * But if any Clergyman or Preacher, desires to be admitted into the Colledge, or permitted to Practice, let him not be ta∣ken in for the same reasons.
If any one of the Collegues shall addict himself to the Priesthood, after he has been admitted into the Colledge, we will not that he be again summoned to the Colledge. But if any Clerk, or one entred in Holy Orders, desires to be admitted in∣to the Colledge, or to be permitted to Pra∣ctice, much less shall that be granted him. We appoint and ordain, That if any one guilty of some more hainous and pub∣lick crime, or shall be infamous for some notable vice, he shall be discharged from the Colledge; lest if we retain such, we should seem either to contemn vertue, or labour under the same disease; but lest such not being a Collegue, should be ad∣mitted into the Colledge, it is both by other Statutes prohibited, and we forbid it by these.
CHAP. XIII. Letters Testimonial of those that Practise thorow the whole Kingdom of England. KNow all men, That we A. B Doctor of Phisick and President of the Colledge of Phisicians of London, toge∣ther with the consent of B. H. and R. M. of the aforesaid Colledge, Fellows and Electors, by the Authority granted to us from our Lord the King and Parliament, have examined and approved 17th day of August, in the year of our Lord 1647, the honest man T. W. of the County of B. in the most Flourishing Ʋniversity of Oxford or Cambridge, Master of Arts, and in the City of York well exercised in the Practice of Phisick, and we judge him worthy, who may be admitted to the Practice of Phisick according to the form
of the Statutes publish'd to this purpose; in testimony whereof we have set our Common Seal and subscribed our Names. Given at London in our Colledge the day and month, &c. If any one after the aforesaid manner shall be judged qualified for Practice by the President and three Electors, he shall tell his Name to the Register, that he may be inserted into the Book of Annals. CHAP. XIV. Of Suppressing Quacks. WHereas there is a great number of unskilful persons who annoy the Common-wealth, and it lies on us, by the Prescript of the King and Parlia∣ment, that we take care of the health and security of the people; we appoint and ordain for the more commodious ex∣tirpation of such, that whom for certain we shall prove to be unlearned and disho∣nest,
that we punish not only by fine and imprisonment, but also that we certifie by our Letters the Magistrates and Go∣vernours of every City, Province, or Ju∣risdiction, where such Impostors dwell, that they are to be reckoned unworthy the name of Phisicians, and therefore to be treated as other Citizens. Let this be the Form of the Letters, but in English. Form of the Letter to the Magistrates. WOrthy Sirs, We certifie you that H. M. of your Province Quick, living in the Street S. is a man unlearn∣ed and unskilful of Phisick, and in no wise is of our Colledge; wherefore you may according to your Law elect and chuse him and all others who have not Letters Testimonial, signed with our Seal, to serve all fit Offices of your City, and to compel them to act and perform o∣ther things, which its granted to your authority to command.
These we have written, to that end lest those silly Impostors of the Commonalty, should under the name and pretence of Phisick, evade your Priviledges. Given from our Colledge, &c. CHAP. XV. Of the Permissives or Licenti∣ates to Practice. BEcause very many in this City exer∣cise Phisick, whom we think altoge∣ther unfit to be admitted into the num∣ber of Fellows or Candidates, either because they are Foreigners, or are not admitted Doctors, or are not sufficient∣ly learned, or by reason of their too great youth, or such like causes, yet may not∣withstanding, be serviceable to the Pub∣lick, in taking care of the health of the Kings subjects, at least in some particu∣lar Diseases.
Concerning these we ordain and ap∣point that after due examinations and the approbation of the President and Censors, they be permitted to practise so long as they behave themselves well. We will that all who are only permit∣ted to practise, be bound with the same faith wherewith the Candidates are. Therefore the President at the time of admission shall use these words, I J. C. President of the Colledge of Phisicians of London, by the authority granted me by Law, permit thee A. B. to the Pra∣ctice of Phisick in the City of London, and for seven miles round about, as long as you behave your self well, and shall observe the Statute of the Colledge, and perform your due payments; and to you so doing I wish all happiness. We will that the Permissive or Licen∣tiates make all usual payments to the Colledge, President, Treasurer, Regi∣ster and Beadle, which lately we assign∣ed to be performed by the Candidates. We will moreover that the first year of Permission they pay to the Colledge six
pounds, unless for reasons to be appro∣ved of by the President and Censors, it shall be thought fit to deal more gently with them; however they shall pay four pounds at least: but for the following years, as long as they shall be Permis∣sives, they shall pay to the use of the Col∣ledge forty shillings. We appoint and ordain, That none be admitted to the Practice of Phisick with∣in the City, Suburbs, and seven miles round about, unless he has been first ex∣amined thrice (on so many days appointed for that purpose) by the President and Censors, and by them approved and per∣mitted to the Practice of Phisick. But if any within the space, or fore∣said circuit, hath exercised the Faculty of Phisick, and as yet has not freely of∣fered himself to the President and Cen∣sors, to be examined, let him first be ad∣monished by the Beadle, and that in the name of the President, that he altoge∣ther abstain from the Practice of Phi∣sick, till he hath obtained the approbati∣on of the President and Colledge, and
that at a set and prefix'd time, he appear before the President and Censors, to wait their examination and approbation. And let the Beadle deliver a Sum∣mons either to him into his hands, or he shall leave it at his house, in these words; WE the President and Gensors of the Colledge of Phisicians of London, summon you to appear on the 14th day of June before us, in your own proper person, and that between two or three of the clock in the afternoon of the same day in the Colledge, there to answer to those things that shall be objected to you concerning the Art of Phisick and the Practice thereof. Given from our Colledge the 10th day of June Anno Domini 1647. But if being summoned after the afore∣said manner, he shall not appear, we judge him to be esteemed for a refractory person, and to be punished according to the Sta∣tutes of the Kingdom.
But seeing by no means (unless by ex∣amination first had) it can be manifest to us, how every one is qualified to be admitted to the Practice of Phisick ac∣cording to the Laws of the Kingdom. We moreover appoint and ordain, That if any exercising Phisick at London, or within the aforesaid limits, summoned by the commands of the President to ex∣amination, shall appear truly, but in the mean time shall refuse to answer the Pre∣sident and Censors, and to give an ac∣count of his knowledge and experience in the Practice of Phisick, let him be e∣steemed for an ignorant and refractory person; and for Practice so begun, let him be punish'd by the President and Cen∣sors, according to the Statutes of the Kingdom. We also appoint and ordain, That if any examined by the President and Cen∣sors, and in their judgements shall be thought not sufficiently skilful or quali∣fied, to be admitted to the Practice of Phisick, let him presently by them be forbid the Practice.
But if after such Prohibition, he shall notwithstanding exercise the Faculty of Phisick, or give any Medicine to any person within the same City, or the cir∣cumference aforesaid, let him be punish'd as is provided by the Statutes of the Kingdom. But we think it just that the Censors and Fellows should admit to the Practice of Phisick all examined persous, as ma∣ny as they shall find qualified, as well for learning as manners; lest our Colledge should be accused of a Monopoly; yet so that they obey the Statutes of the Colledge. CHAP. XVI. The Form of the Examinations of the Fellows and Candi∣dates, and of their Admission. BEfore any one be admitted either in∣to the Order of the Fellows or Can∣didates, let him be examined thrice in
lawful Meetings, whether greater or lesser, according to the pleasure of the President and Censors, as is said and or∣dained before in the Chapter of the Co∣mitia or Meetings. Let the Form of Examination be after this manner, FIrst, Let him be examined in the Physiologick Part, and the very Rudiments of Medicine, and in this Examination let Questions be propound∣ed out of Books concerning Elements, Temperaments, the Ʋse of Parts, Ana∣tomy, Natural Powers and Faculties, and the other Parts of Natural Medi∣cine. Secondly, Let him be examined in the Pathologick Part, or concerning the Causes, Differences, Symptoms, and Signs of Diseases, which Phisicians make use of to know the Essence of Dis∣eases; and in this Examination let Que∣stions be proposed out of Books concern∣ing the Art of Phisick, of the Places af∣fected, of the Differences of Diseases,
and Symptoms, of Feavers, of the Pul∣ses, of the Books of the Prognosticks of Hypocrates, &c. Thirdly, Let him be examined con∣cerning the Ʋse and Exercise of Medi∣cine, or the Reason of Healing; and let that be done out of the Books concerning Preservation of Health, of the Method of Healing, of the Reason of Diet in Acute Diseases, of Simple Medicines, of Crises, of the Aphorisms of Hyppo∣crates; and other things of that kind, which relate to the Ʋse of Healing; for Example sake, What Caution is to be ob∣served in Purging? what in Blood-let∣ting? at what Time? in what Disease? in what Person? with what Medicine? and in what Vein, those things ought to be done? Likewise, what is the Ʋse of Narcoticks and Sleeping Medicines? and what Caution is to be observed in them? what is the Position and Site of the Internal places? and by what Pas∣sages Medicines come to them? What is the Ʋse of Clysters, what of Vomits, the danger, kind, and measure?
We will that all these Examinations be made by the President and Censors, yet it shall be lawful for any Fellow to dispute at his pleasure, and make trial how able the examined is in the Phisical Art. But in these Examinations, we desire that the Fellows behave themselves fair∣ly, and use a pleasant temperament of speech; by no means shewing themselves morose or difficult in disputing. If he hath taken the Degree of Doctor in any of our Ʋniversities, let him that is to be examined, for Honours sake be decently seated; lest our Mother Ʋni∣versity should seem to suffer some affront from our form of Examinations. He who bath been examined after this manner, if he shew himself a learned man, and hath honest and amiable con∣versation (of which we desire great care to be taken) let him be admitted by the greater part of the Fellows present; so there be not fewer present at those Meet∣ings than twelve, besides the President and Pro-President.
Let this be the Form of Admission. HE that is to be admitted, let him on his bended knees humbly deli∣ver his bands joyned together, into the hands of the President, who shall say, I J. C. President of this Colledge, admit thee A. B. into the Society of our Colledge (either into the Order of Candidates, or into the number of Permissives) which being done, if he be a Fellow, he shall with taking by the hand, give thanks to all the Fellows present. But if it appear that he who is to be examined, has been for three years Pub∣lick Reader of Phisick or Regius Profes∣sor, and Doctor of the Chair (as they say) in any of our Ʋniversities, or for his singular fame of knowledge, is called to Court, and is the Kings, Queens, or Princes Phisician, it shall not be necessa∣ry to examine him; but at the pleasure of the President and Pro-President, and greater part of the Fellows present, he may be admitted without any Ceremony of Disputing.
Whosoever, either Censor or Fellow, proposeth Questions in Examinations, let him be with his head uncovered, as also that Doctor that commeth thither to be examined. CHAP. XVII. Of the Place and Dignity of the President and all the Fellows. LEt the first place be the Presidents, as also the first dignity, not only in the Colledge, but in all other places. Let the place and honour, next after the President, be the Kings Phisicians in ordinary, who receive a set Salary, and have Letters Patents under the Great Seal of the Kingdom. Let every ones place be according to his seniority, so that the juniors give place to the seniors, not only in the Col∣ledge, but also every where out of it.
Now we call seniority, not what age or dignity, or the time of taking a degree any where, but what admission into the Colledge maketh. CHAP. XVIII. Of Anatomical Administration, and ¶ The Chirurgical Lecture. WE appoint and ordain, That each Fellow at the time of Ad∣mission give his faith, that he will in publick Anatomically dissect a Humane Body at the charge of the Colledge, in that year which the President shall ap∣point, and that either in the Colledge, or some other place, to be assigned at the judgement of the President and Electors; especially if any shall seem to them skilful in Anatomy. But if any shall resuse the burden laid on him, and he be estecmed in their
judgement less fit for that business, be shall pay four pounds to the use of the Col∣ledge: But if he shall obstinately refuse to perform this due Office, he at the pleasure of the President, and the great∣er part of the Fellows present, shall be fi∣ned; yet so that this Fine exceed not Twenty pounds. We also appoint and ordain, That no Fellow or any other Collegue, publickly profess or undertake the administration of a Humane Body, any where but in the Colledge, or place assigned by the Presi∣dent and Electors, under the penalty of Four pounds; unless that place be di∣stant from the City seven miles at least. Yet we will, That it be free for any of the Collegues publickly to exercise Anato∣my in Chirurgeons Hall, provided the Masters and Wardens of the Community of Chirurgeons first ask leave for him of the President or Pro-President; for we judge it just and reasonable, that they who profit by any one of the Collegues, should shew some duty of respect to the Colledge.
Moreover, we appoint, That all the Fellows and Candidates be present at each Publick Anatomical Dissections made in the Colledge, decently clad with Gown and ap, for the honour of the Col∣ledge and Profession. Who shall do otherwise, shall be pu∣nished three shillings and four pence. ¶ That the Lecture in Chirurgery may be the better followed with a fuller com∣pany of proper Auditors; therefore we will and appoint that all Candidates and all permitted to practise in this City, be obliged diligently to hear the Chirurgical Lecture; who shall do otherwise, and be∣have himself more negligently in this matter, he as often as he shall be absent, for that his absence, each time, shall pay to the Colledge twelve pence; which sum of money he that shall keep in his own bands, and shall refuse to pay to the Of∣ficer of the Colledge deputed for that purpose, within eight days after the end of that term, in which for his absence it was formerly due; then we will that that
fine of twelve pence be increased to two shillings and six pence, so often as it is defaulted. We will, moreover, That after they have diligently heard this Lecture for sive whole years, then it may be free for them to use their own pleasure in this matter for the future; for it is not re∣quired by us that they should be longer hearers of that Lecture, after five years diligently spent in that Study. We surther grant, That it may be free for every one at his pleasure, to be thrice absent in each Term without fine, and that the fine of those who are absent as often as it shall happen, go to the use of the Reader for the time being; and that it is establish'd, that a due payment be made of all those, before they can be admitted into the Colledge: for we judge it unfit, besides the honour of the Art and the dignity of the Colledge, that our Reader expecting Auditors, should to no purpose lose his labour and pains.
CHAP. XIX. Of the Ornament and Cloath∣ing of Phisicians. WE appoint according to the ad∣vice of Hyppocrates, That all the Fellows be cloathed with a decent Garb, as often as they come to the Col∣ledge, or go forth in publick, lest the excellency and dignity of our Art, by reason of slovingliness should be reproach∣ed and contemned by the Vulgar. Wherefore we appoint and ordain, That the President and Pro-President, Ele∣ctors, Censors, and all other Fellows, in all greater Meetings, Feasts of the Col∣legues, Funerals, and Anatomical Ad∣ministrations, be cloathed with Gown and other decent apparel, upon penalty of five shillings to be paid to the Colledge, as often as they shall be delinquent.
CHAP XX. Of Funeral Ceremonies. IF it happen that any one of the Col∣legues die (unless he die of the Plague) every Collegue lawfully admo∣nish'd by the Beadle, shall be obliged to be present at the Funeral, and to follow in his Order, and attend at the other Funeral Rites and Ceremonies, under penalty of Three shillings and four pence, to be paid to the use of the Colledge. Moreover, We will for the honour of the Colledge, that a Seat for the President in the Church be adorned with Tepestry or Hangings, and a decent Cushion, for so long time as the Funeral Offices, and other Divine Solemnities are celebrated.
CHAP. XXI. Of Feastings. BEcause by honest Meetings mutual love is maintained, and the minds of studious men recreated, We will that all who have been admitted into the Soci∣ety of the Colledge, entertain the Presi∣dent and all the Fellows in Town, at a frugal, honest, and sufficient Feast, and that at a time first appointed by the Pre∣sident. But he appointeth it on the day of the ordinary or greater Meetings, or on what day he thinks fit of the fifteen next following the Feast of St. Michael, the Nativity of our Saviour, Easter, or the Nativity of St. John Baptist. The Feast over, it shall be lawful in the same place, excluding foreign Arbi∣ters, to call a Meeting, and treat of the
business of the Colledge, if the matter re∣quire it and the President and Counsellers shall judge it necessary. But if at any time it shall happen, that he whose duty it is to provide a Feast, cannot conveniently perform it, and therefore for some just and honest cause to be approved by the President and greater part of the Society, he shall desire of the Society to be kindly released from this Law, and freed from that charge; we leave the whole matter to be moderated at the discretion of the President and So∣ciety. Yet whatever Collegue shall obtain this favour, that he be released from provi∣ding a Feast, he shall pay to the use of the Colledge Ten or Twenty Pounds, ac∣cording as it shall seem reasonable to the President and greater part of the Fel∣lows.
CHAP. XXII. Of Moral Conversation and Penal Statutes. IF any strife or controversie arise from the order, gravity, and modesty (which we prescribe to be observed in our Meetings) not duly observed; whoe∣ver shall offend, may be punished at the pleasure of the President or Pro-Presi∣dent and Censors. But if the President shall commit any thing against the Statutes, let him be admonish'd by the Consiliarii or Assist∣ants, before the Fellows in our Meetings, but not punished, unless for some grie∣vous Crime, such as is robbery or waste∣ing the goods of the Colledge, and the like, so adjudged by the greater part of the Fellows, among whom we will that there be four of the Electors; who together with the rest shall give their judgement on that matter.
So much we attribute to the Honour and Authority of the President. Let none reveal or divulge any thing of any moment that is said in the Col∣ledge, under the penalty of Ten shil∣lings. No Collegue shall by name accuse ano∣ther either of ignorance or ill practice, or any villany, or ignominious crime, or publickly reproach any of the Colledge. If it shall appear to the President and Censors that any has acted contrany, the first time he shall pay to the use of the Colledge Four pounds. The second the Mulct shall be doubled, but if any shall offend the third time, he shall be expelled the Colledge, neither shall he be restored again, before he has paid Ten pounds to the Colledge. No Phisician who shall be called second to a sick person, shall cause the former Phisician to be turned away, nor shall he innovate any thing before (unless the matter be urgent) he shall meet him, and that there be no place for deceit, whoever
is sent for to a Sick Person, he shall ask of him or the By-standers, whether any hath prescribed a Medicine, under the Penalty of Twenty Shillings. Yet afterwards at the pleasure of the Sick, be shall alone Cure him, or Ad∣minister the business with the former Physician, or with any other. Yet he shall do his endeavour, as much as in him lies, that he retain the for∣mer with him in Practice. But if that cannot be done with the Consent of the Sick Person, or the Friends, he shall in no manner dispraise the former Physician, neither by Counte∣nance, Gesture, Suspicious Silence, or by any other means blame his Actions to the Sick, or By-standers; but he shall rather praise him, and that not deccit∣fully by the Name of Honesty and Good∣ness, but (what chiesly pertains to the matter) of a Skilful and Intelligent Physician; always remembring, that he have the Reputation of another with o∣thers, in that esteem, which if the Case were altered, he would desire his own,
to wit, for the Honour and Dignity of the Art he professeth. The Form of Consultation. IF any for Cure sake shall meet to deli∣berate on the Condition of the Sick, they must consult with the greatest Mo∣desty, and not unless Forreign Arbiters are secluded: But let the business be transacted in Latine, otherwise let there be a Fine of five Shillings for the use of the Colledge. First of all they must diligently in∣quire into the Species or Kind, Cause and Symptoms of the Disease, and then Remedies most convenient for the De∣struction of the Disease, and Mitigation of Symptoms, are to be propounded. Let the Junior Phisician begin, let the Senior conclude. But if any Senior shall be first sent sor, let him first relate the whole matter to the rest, to wit, what he hath done, and with what success, then let them act as is Directed.
If they shall often meet to visit the same sick person, let none prescribe any thing, nay let him not so much as hint what is to be done, before the sick or by∣standers, before with joyned counsels in private, it shall be concluded among the Phisicians themselves; lest any should seem too ambitiously to fore-stall Practice, and snatch the free opportunity of prescri∣bing from the rest, unless upon some sud∣den and urgent occasion (and that to be approved of by the President and Censors) he shall be compelled to prescribe alone. If the Phisicians are of disserent opi∣nions, so that they cannot agree among themselves upon the same Practice, yet let them so manage themselves with the greatest Prudence and Moderation, that their Discord may not make to the pre∣judice of the Art, neither if possible let it be known to others. If there shall be only two Physicians, let the Junior yield to the Senior, or let them call a third, to whom the business may be referred; if many, let the greater part carry it, if the Dissenting Physicians shall
be equal in number, let it be concluded by greater part of the Seniors: so the Ho∣nour and Dignity of the Art will be pre∣served, which would otherwise by the dis∣cord of Physicians be easily had in Con∣tempt; he that shall Act contrary, shall be Fined Forty Shillings. Lest any strife or controversie should arise among Physicians for Officious vi∣sits, fore-stallments and insinuations, We appoint and ordain, That when other Physicians shall be called to any Phy∣sician to consult, and according to the form prescribed by us; they are agreed of the Disease and Remedies: Let the Senior, or some other Physician, relate to the Sick, or By-standers, what have been approved and prescribed by Common Consent, the Execution whereof the others shall leave to the Ordinary Physicians; nor shall they again visit the Sick, unless they be ex∣presly desired to do so from the Physician in Ordinary, or the Sick Person. Let no Physician, whether Fellow or
Candidate, or Permissive, consult with an Empirick, or one expelled the Col∣ledge and forbid the Practice of Phy∣sick, or any other Practising Physick without Admission or Permission, unless upon some urgent Cause, to be approved of by the President, or Pro-President, and Censors, or the greatest part of them, under the Penalty of Forty Shillings. Let every Physician be content with an honest Reward, according to the Condi∣tion of the Sick and his Labour. Let none make a Bargain with the Sick, or with any other in the name of the Sick, about the Price of Cure. But if any undertake Sick Persons to Cure, who will not think themselves o∣therwise satisfied, unless they make a Bar∣gain with the Physician, or if he happen on those, who have no regard of their Estate, or Honour, and act too spa∣ringly, or illiberally, with Physicians, with such it shall be lawful to make a Bargain, yet reserving a Power for the President and Censors, and in their ab∣sence, for Four of the Elect, at their
prudence to correct and alter, if any thing be more unjustly covenanted. Let none teach the People Medicines, or tell their Names to them (especially if they are Vehement Medicines, as Purgers, Opiats, or Sleeping Medicines, or which cause Abortion, Vomits, or any other of greater moment or danger) lest by the abuse of them the People be injured; upon penalty of forty Shillings as often as they shall offend. He that bargains with Apothecaries for any part of the Price arising from the Medicines to be prescribed, shall be fined forty Shillings, as often as he shall so offend. Let no Fellow Candidate or Permis∣sive, make use of those Appothecaries, who either themselves Practise Physick, or frequently serve those Physicians, who are not Examined and Approved, ac∣cording to the Statutes of this Kingdom, under penalty of Ten Shillings, to be paid to the Colledge, as often as he shall offend, provided he before-warned thereof by the
President or Pro-President and Censors. None shall refuse to pay a Fine laid on him according to the Statutes, for a fault, under penalty of violating his Faith gi∣ven to the Colledge. Because Aposhecaries and Chirurgeons, but especially the Chirurgeons, often bring the Ʋrine of Sick People to Physicians, and desire that from the In∣spection of the Ʋrine they would prescribe something for their Sick; and under this pretence of Consultation, manage the whole Course of Cure at their pleasure, what∣ever profit or gain there is; appropriating all to themselves, but bringing to the Phi∣sicians nothing besides that slender and hungry reward of inspecting the Ʋrine. Therefore, We Appoint and Ordain, That none, whether Fellow, Candidate, or Permissive, give any Advice to such like Cheating Knaves and Impostors, upon the bare Inspection of Ʋrine, unless he shall also be called to the Sick, and there, ac∣cording as the matter shall require, pre∣scribe proper Medicines to be Compound∣ed
by some honest Apothecary. Moreover, We will that to each Scrowl or Receipt (as they call them) every one write the Day of the Month, Name of the Sick, and his own Name. It is indeed ridiculous and foolish, on∣ly from the Inspection of Ʋrine, after the manner of Soothsayers and Conjurers, to attempt to Divine any thing Certain and Solid, either of the Kind or Nature of the Disease, or of the State and Conditi∣on of the Sick. Therefore, We admonish all Physicians, that for the future, they carry themselves much more wary in this matter, than heretofore was wont to be done of many; and for this Reason we forbid all Persons Practising Physick, that they do not pre∣scribe any Medicine to those Idiots and Silly Women who carry the Pispots of Sick Persons about, unless they have first known the Sick Person; or at least shall be plainly and fully instructed by those who ask advice concerning the Disease and its circumstances.
For by this means we shall both better defend the dignity of Physick, and also much more aptly and certainly de∣vise Remedies to profit the Sick. To conclude, We Appoint and Ordain, That, whosoever is admitted into the Society of the Colledge, they promise by subscribing their Names, that they will diligently observe all the aforesaid Sta∣tutes, or willingly pay the Fines inflict∣ed on those that act contrary. If according to this Model, the Col∣ledge be governed by the prudent counsel of the President, Electors and Censors, and graced with the exact and obedient duty of the rest, and adorned with Science, the Illiterate being rooted out, and the hateful Impostors exterminated, it is most certain that this our Colledge will be most flourishing for ever, and it will rightly and providently be consulted for the whole Common-wealth (as much as belongs to our duties.) Wherefore by the Faith given the Col∣ledge, we exhort and beseech all the Fel∣lows that they have a diligent prospect
every way, and act prudently, and do not admit any for respect of Persons into the Colledge; but that they determine all things for the Praise, Glory, Honour, and Perpetuity of the Society; because it is certain our Colledge can by no means be more firmly established and continued, then by good Laws, honest Governours, and Manners, and the singular Virtues and Learning of the Collegues. FINIS.
☞ The Statutes that are marked with these Characters * ¶ are such that the Colledge thought good to leave out in their New Model, and these follow∣ing ought to be inserted in those Pages that the Numbers refer to. Pag. 84. We will appoint, That no Candidate, before he be admitted into the Colledge and made Fellow, have ei∣ther the Seal of our Colledge, or Letters Patents, such as are granted to the Fel∣lows at their Admission.
Pag. 87. Shall be punished, either by Imprisonment, or Fine, or by both, at the pleasure of the President, Pro-Presi∣dent and Censors, as often as they shall offend. Pag. 91. That they give their Names to the President and Censors, and to their power take care, that they bring with them, and have in readiness, all those Arguments and Testimonies which have any force or weight to accuse them, that by this means all that race of male Pra∣ctisers, be either wholly extirpated, or at least more prudently restrained. Pag. 95. You stall not by your self or any other, in Word or Sign, declare the places of questions in Examinations, you shall be prepared for the Examination of those who desire to be examined and ad∣mitted. To your Knowledge you shall not speak nor act against the Colledge; the more choice Medicines you shall not write to an Apothecary, that you may gain his favour in procuring Patients. FINIS.
Pag. 85. Volumus & Statuimus, Ut nullus Candidatus antequam admitta∣tur in Collegium & fiat Socius habeat aut Collegii nostri Sigillum, aut Lite∣ras Patentes, quales Sociis in admissi∣one conceduntur.
Pag. 86. Poenas luet, sive per Carcerem, sive per Mulctam, sive per utrumque pro Praesidis & Pro-Praesidis atque Censorum arbitrio toties quoties offenderit. Pag. 90. Eorum nomina Prae∣sidi & Censoribus significent curentque quantum in se est, ut omnia illa argu∣menta & testimonia, quae vim aliquam habent atque pondus ad eos accusandos, unà secum adducant & habeant in promptu, ut hâc ratione, tota illa ma∣leficorum progenies aut penitus extir∣petur, aut saltem paulo providentius coerceatur. Pag. 94. Non indicabis verbo aut signo per te, aut alium loca quaestio∣nem in examinationibus, paratus eris ad examinationem eorum, qui petunt examinari & admitti. Sciens non loqueris nec ages contra Collegium, pretiosiora Medicamenta, non scribes Pharmacopolae, quo favo∣rem ejus in procurandis aegris de∣merearis. FINIS.

THE NEW STATƲTES OF The President of the Colledge, or Commonalty of the Fa∣culty of PHISICK of LONDON, Made by the President of the Colledge, or Commonalty aforesaid, with the consent of the Presi∣dent of the Colledge, or Com∣monalty aforesaid, in the year 1687. and that they may re∣main establish'd, fix'd, and certain, signed with the Com∣mon Seal of the same Col∣ledge, or Commonalty afore∣said, the 28th of September, in the year 1687. 1. THat none, to any but the absent Fellows, reveal or divulge the Secrets of the Colledge, or
any thing of any moment, that is said in the Assemblies, whether greater or lesser, under the penalty of Forty shil∣lings the first time, Five pounds the se∣cond, and the third Expulsion from the Colledge: We will have all that esteemed for a secret or matter of moment, whate∣ver shall be pronounced in the Assem∣blies or Meetings by the President or the two Senior Censors present, fit to becon∣cealed. 2. Let no Phisician, whether Fellow or Candidate, or Licentiate, consult with an Empirick, or who is rejected by the Colledge, or forbidden the Practice of Phisick, or any other practising Phisick without Admission or Permission, who is not Phisician to the King or the Royal Family, and to whom a Salary hath been assigned, or who by chance shall come out of the Countrey, with no design of staying in the City, under the penalty of Ten pounds.
3. Let no Phisician who shall be called second to a sick person, cause the former Phisician to be repelled or put by, nor shall he alter any thing, unless the matter be urgent, before he meet his Collegue; and that there be no place for deceit, whoever is sent for to a sick person, shall inquire of him or the by-standers, whe∣ther any one hath prescribed any Medi∣cine, under the penalty of Forty shil∣lings the first time, the second Five pounds; but if any shall in like manner offend the third time, he shall be expelled the Colledge. 4. If to visit the same sick person, two or more Phisicians shall meet together, let none prescribe any thing, nay let him not so much as hint what is to be done, in pre∣sence of the sick or by-standers, before with joynt counsel in private, it shall he concluded betwixt them; lest he seem too ambitiously to fore-stall Practice, and snatch the free opportunity of preseri∣bing from all the rest, unless by some sudden and urgent occasion, and that to
be approved by the President and Censors, he shall be compelled to prescribe alone; under the penalty of Five pounds, as of∣ten as he is delinquent: but if any shall be found often to offend in this matter or part, let him be removed from the Col∣ledge with ignominy. 5. Lest any strife or controversie should arise between Phisicians for offici∣ous visitings, forestallments, and insi∣nuations, we appoint and ordain, that when other Phisicians shall be called to any Phisician to consult, that the elder Phisician, or same other, relate to the sick, or by-standers, what by common consent have been approved and prescri∣bed, and let the rest leave the execution thereof to the ordinary Phisician; nor shall they again visit the sick, unless ex∣presly desired to do so by the ordinary Phisician, or from the sick person, on the penalty of Five pounds as often as they shall be found delinquent.
6. None shall refuse to pay Subscriptions or Payments due, or lastly Fines inflicted on them for default, according to the Statutes, under penalty of expulsion from the Colledge. 7. Seeing by the wandering Discourse of men there is a report that some Phi∣sicians of our Community, after the man∣ner of Empericks, disperse Bills among the common People, whereby they may hawk out a sordid and mean practice among the ordinary sort of people, and in the mean time bring no small dishonour to the faculty of Physick, We Appoint and Ordain, that no Col∣legue Print, Divulge, or by any means Publish any Book, Treatise, Table, Pa∣per, or Pamphlet whatsoever, wherein is contained any thing that relates to the Art of Phisick or Chirurgery, or the Pra∣ctice of them, without leave and appro∣bation of the President and Censors, or the greater part of them, under the pe∣nalty of four pounds the first time, eight pounds the second, but the third Ex∣pulsion from the Colledge.
8. If by chance any Chirurgeon or A∣pothecary shall offer himself to the Pre∣sident and Censors to be examined, that he may be received into the num∣ber of Candidates, or Licentiates; We will that he before Examination, or at least before Admission, be wholly discharged from all Tie and Obligation, wherewith he was formerly oblidged to his Community; for we do not think it just or convenient, to admit any into our Society, who hath his Faith oblidged to another. 9. Because it is found by Experience that the Apothecaries from the Prescripts of Physicians, attain some pretence or shadow of false Knowledge (every where boasting themselves to Sick Persons) which they abuse, not without the ha∣zard of others, to their own profit; We Determine and Ordain, that no Collegue for the future, either Fellow, Candidate, or Licentiate, add Directi∣ons as they call them, to their Prescripts or Physical Scrowls (save only in Hospi∣tals)
but he shall leave them with the Sick, or at least take care that they be first signed and carried to his house; in the mean time let him command, that the Medicines prescribed in the Scrowls be only signed with some agreeable titles or apt notes for their distinction, to the in∣tent that as much as in us lies, nothing at all be smelt out by this sort of Medica∣sters, with what design, intention, or for what uses the Remedies are prescribed: let every one be fined Twenty Shillings for the use of the Colledge as often as they shall fail in this part. 10. Let no Fellow, Candidate, or Permissive, make use of an Apothecary whom in the greater Meetings (at which all Collegues of all ranks are fore-warned that they be present) the President hath renounced, or declared to practice Phi∣sick, or has been twice about that matter summoned to appear before the Presi∣dent and Censors, and has not appeared, on the penalty of Forty shillings the first
time, the second five pounds, and the third Expulsion from the Colledge. Let the Office of the President and Censors be to inquire into such like causes, weigh the matters, and define who is guilty of Practice; and whom they or the greater part of them, shall judge so, we deter∣mine and will, that he be called, and is, a Practising Apothecary. Lastly, We charge and command the Fellows, with all the rest of the Collegues, that laying aside all affe∣ction and respest of persons, that what∣somever Apothecaries of that sort they find to have practised, they bring their names to the President and Censors, and that under the penalty of breach of Faith given to the Colledge. 11. Whereas some of our Statutes seem more severely to have constituted the penalty of Expulsion to Delinquents, so that all hope and expectation of return∣ing into the Colledge being precluded, and no place is left for repentance, it hath seemed good so to moderate this se∣verity of Laws, with some mixture of
clemency, that if any expelled out of the Colledge, openly, ingenuously, and submis∣sively, confess his Crime in the greater Meetings, and withal presently pay whatever Fines have been formerly laid on him for defaults, and ten pounds be∣sides for the use of the Colledge; on these Conditions it may be lawful for the Pre∣sident and greater part of the Fellows, to restore him to his former Place, State, and Dignity. 12. We appoint that every year on the same day, and with the same suffrages wherewith the Censors are wont to be crea∣ted, that ten men be chose out of the Fellows, that are more fit then, the rest to expedite and dispatch business; in the number of which we will always have the President, who for the following year are the stated Delegates or Committee men, and it may be lawful for them at any time, according to their pleasure to meet, discourse and handle matters of any sort, relating to the Profit, or Honour of the Colledge, to relate their Opinions
and Consults to the Society in the greater Meetings: Lastly, to execute and per∣form all other things that our most Sove∣raign Prince James the Second, in Let∣ters Patents lately given us, hath com∣mitted to our charge. 13. In the Election of a Treasurer, we will that altogether the same form be ob∣served, which is before appointed by us in creating the Censors, to wit, that he be chose after the same manner, at the same time, and by the same Suffrages; and moreover we appoint that the Trea∣surer now Elect, before he be admitted to his Office, be oblidged by a Bond signed with his own Seal, to the President and our Society, that at the summons of the same President and Electors, he, to them, and four other Fellows appointed to this purpose, by the Colledge, shall faithfully give an account of what is received and dis∣burst: and lastly, the Accounts made up, whatsomever the sum of the Remainder due to the Colledge shall be, he will pay it to the said Colledge, within twenty
days after the Account is made up. Let the Witnesses made use of to this Bond be three Foreigners, who are joyned with us by no right of Community. 14. We will that the Seal of the Col∣ledge for the future be set to no Letters Testimonial, save to those Fellows to whom at the time of their Admission by the Statutes, it is granted to have, that is to those who have a right of Voting in greater Meetings: But let them pay the Beadle ten Shillings for these Letters, as for others by which a Licence to pra∣ctice without the City is granted, us be∣ing signed by the Hands and Seals of the President only and three of the Elect, let the Licentiates pay six shillings and eight pence. 15. Whereas formerly there was no convenient place within the Colledge, wherein our Writings might be kept, we have thought good for these uses in the Study of Henry Guy Esq to build a Desk or Paper-Treasury, whereof let
there be Four Keys; one of them let the President have, another the Treasurer, and both the two Senior Censors likewise one: in this Place and Custody we will that the Diplomata of Princes, Bonds, and other Instruments of the Colledge, and lastly, all Papers whatsomever of that sort, and Parchments which are of greater moment, be contained and kept; but we forbid that any thing be brought out thence without the consent of the Col∣ledge, unless by chance or some urgent necessity, it shall otherwise seem good to the Committee, or President, and Censors; besides we appoint that in the same place be laid up the Common Seal of the Col∣ledge in a small Cabinet made for this purpose, whose Key let the President have, and as often as need shall be, let him open it in the greater Meetings: neither will we that our Common Seal be affixed to any Instrument elsewhere, then in the aforesaid Assemblies.
16. We appoint and ordain, That no Chirurgeen, Apothecary, or any such Ar∣tificer, be admitted into the Order of Candidates, on Fellows, whoever hath exercised, any less liberal Art, or bound to Servitude, hath laid his beginning in a Shop, lest peradventure if we should so choose such into the Colledge, we might seem not sufficiently to have consulted either our own Dignity or the Honour of the Ʋniversities of England, which not∣withstanding we ought and always will Honour with the highest Veneration. FINIS.
STATUTA NOVA Praesidis Collegii, seu Commu∣nitatis Facultatis MEDI∣CINAE LONDINI, per Praesidem Collegii, seu Communitatem praedictam, per consensum Praesidis, Collegii, seu Communitatis praedictae, Anno 1687 facta, & ut rata firma ac certa permaneant Si∣gillo Communi ejusdem Colle∣gii, seu Communitatis praedi∣ctae 28 die Septembris 1687, munita. 1. UT nè quis cuiquam praeter∣quam Sociis absentibns revelet, aut propalet Secreta Collegii,
aut quidquam alicujus momenti quod in Comitiis (sive majoribus sive mi∣noribus) dictum sit, sub poenâ Qua∣draginta solidorum primâ vice, Quin que librarum secundâ vice, & tertiâ Expulsionis à Collegio, id autem omne pro secreto, & re momenti haberi vo∣lumus, quicquid à Praeside, vel Cen∣sorum praesentium duobus Senioribus celandum esse in Comitiis pronuntia∣tum fuerit. 2. Nullus Medicus, sive Socius, sive Candidatus, sive Permissus, Consili∣um ineat cum Empirico, aut Rejecto à Collegio, aut à Medicinae praxi pro∣hibito, aut aliô aliquô, sine Admissi∣one, aut Permissione Medicinam ex∣ercente, qui non sit Medicus Regius, aut Regiae Familiae, cui Stipendium as∣signatum fuerit, vel qui fortè è Rure advenerit nullô in Urbe commoran∣di Consiliô sub poena Decem libra∣rum.
3. Nullus Medicus qui secundus ad aegrum vocabitur, priorem Medicum repelli saciat, nec quidquam priùs in∣novabit, nisi res urgeat, quàm Col∣legam convenerit, & ne quis fraudi locus sit; quicunque ad aegrum accer∣situr, ab illo, vel astantibus percun∣ctabitur, an quis Medicamentum ali∣quod praescripserit sub poenâ Quadra∣ginta solidorum primâ vice, secundâ Quinque librarum, si quis autem ter∣tiâ vice pariter offenderit, expelletur à Collegio. 4. Si ad eundem aegrum visendum, duo, vel plures Medici simul convene∣rint nemo quidquam praescribat immò ne innuat quidem, quid agendum sit, coram aegro, vel adstantibus prius∣quàm conjunctis Consiliis, privatim inter ipsos conclusum fuerit nè ambi∣tiosè nimiùm videatur praxin praeoccu∣pare & reliquis liberam praescribendi ansam praeripere, nisi subita & urgen∣te aliquâ occasione eàque approbandâ
à Praeside & Censoribus coactus fuerit solus praescribere sub poenâ quinque librarum, quoties deliquerit: quod si quis in hac parte saepius offendisse de∣prehendetur à Collegio cum ignominiâ amoveatur. 5. Ne qua lis, aut Controversia inter Medicos propter officiosas visitationes, praeoccupationes, & insinuationes ori∣atur; statuimus & ordinamus, ut quum ad Medicum quemlibet, alii Medici, consultandi gratiâ advocati fuerint, Se∣nior Medicus, vel alius aliquis referat aegro, aut adstantibus, quae approba∣ta, & praescripta communi consensu fuerint, eorundemque executionem caeteri ordinario Medico relinquant, nec denuò visitabunt aegrum nisi à Me∣dico ordinario, aut ab aegro, ut id fa∣ciant expressè rogati fuerint, sub poe∣nâ quinque librarum toties quoties deliquerint.
6. Nemo subscriptiones, aut solutiones debitas, aut denique Mulctas sibi pro delicto, secundùm Statuta inflictas, solvere recusabit, sub poenâ expulsio∣nis è Collegio. 7. Quoniam pervagato hominnm ser∣mone fama percrebuit, quosdam nostrae Communitatis Medicos, Empericorum more Schedulas in vulgus spargere, quibus ut inter plebeios sordidam, & illiberalem praxin aucupentur, facul∣tati interim Medicinae haud le∣vem ignominiae labem aspergunt, Statuimus & Ordinamus, nè quis Collega Typis Mandet, divulget, aut quoquô modô in Publicum emittat li∣brum aliquem, Tractatum. Tabellam, Chartam, Schedulamve aliquam, in quibus contineatur quicquam quod ad Artem Medicinae, vel Chirurgiae, earumve praxin spectet, sine permissu, & approbatione Praesidis, & Censorum, vel eorum majore parte, sub poenâ quatuor librarum primâ vice, octo librarum secundâ, tertiâ autem Expul∣sionis è Collegio.
8. Si quis fortè Chirurgus, aut Pharmacopola, se Praesidi, & Censo∣ribus Examinandum obtulerit, quò in Candidatorum, Permissorumve Numerum recipiatur; eum, ante ex∣aminationem, aut saltem ante Admissi∣onem, omni Jure & Obligatione pe∣nitùs exui volumus, quibus suae Com∣munitati prius obstringebatur; neque enim aequum; aut commodum cense∣mus quemquam in Societatem nostram admittere qui Fidem alteri addictam habet. 9. Quoniam Experientiâ compertum est, Pharmacopolas ex Medicorum praescriptis, speciem quandam, & umbram falsae Scientiae consectari, quâ se passim aegris venditantes, non sine aliorum periculô, ad suum compendium abutuntur; Statui∣mus, & Ordinamus, nè quis in posterum Collega, sive Socius, sive Candidatus, sive Praemissus, praescrip∣tis suis, seu Schedulis Medicinalibus, directiones (quas vocant) adjiciant
(praeterquam in Nosocomiis) sed eas apud aegrum ipse relinquet, aut sal∣tem priùs obsignatas ad ejus domum transferendas curabit; Medicamenta interim in Schedulis praescripta, jubeat solummodò ut titulis quibusdam con∣gruentibus, aut notis ad eorum distin∣ctionem aptis signentur, nempè ut quantum in nobis est, nihil quicquam hujusmodi Medicastris Suboleat, quô consilio, quâ ve intentione, aut in quos usus Remedia praescribantur: mul∣ctentur autem singuli viginti solidis in usum Collegii quoties in hâc parte deliquerit. 10. Nullus Socius, Candidatus, aut Permissus, Pharmacopolae operâ uta∣tur, quem in Comitiis majoribus (quibus ut intersint omnes omnium ordinum Collegae praemoniti sunt) Praeses renunciaverit, aut Medicinae praxin exercere, aut eâ de causâ bis citatum, ut se sisteret coram Praeside, & Censoribus, nondum comparuisse, sub poenâ quadraginta solidorum pri∣mâ
vice, secundâ quinque librarum, & tertiâ Expulsionis è Colegio. Praesi∣dis autem & Censorum esto hujus∣modi causas cognoscere, momenta ex∣pendere, & definire, quis praxeos te∣neatur, & quem illi, aut major pars eorum judicaverit, eum nos Pharmacopolam Practicantem esse, statuimus & appellari volumus. Denique Sociis, caeterisque Collegis omnibus, precipimus, & mandamus, ut sepositô omni affectu, & respectu Personarum, ejusmodi Pharmacopoeos quoscunque praxin exercuisle depre∣henderint, eorum nomina Praesidi, & Censoribus deferant, idque sub poenâ violatae Fidei Collegio Praestitae. 11. Cum Statuta quaedam nostra graviùs Delinquentibus poenam Ex∣pulsionis ita constituisse videantur, ut praeclusâ omni spe, & expectatione re∣deundi in Collegium, nihil quicquam loci relictum est penitentiae, visum est hanc legum severitatem Clementiae temperatione aliquâ sic moderari, ut
si quis è Collegio Expulsus, culpam suam in majoribus Comitiis apertè, in∣genuè, & demissè confiteatur, si∣mulque mulctas quascunque ob de∣licta priùs irrogata, & praeterea decem libras in usum Collegii statim solvat, illum his Conditionibus li∣ceat Praesidi, & majori parti Socio∣rum in pristinum Locum, Statum, & Dignitatem restituere. 12. Statuimus, ut singulis annis eôdem die, iisdemque Suffragiis qui∣bus Censores creaii solent, è Sociis decem eligantur viri, ad expedien∣da & transigenda negotia prae caeteris maximè idonei (quô in numero Praesi∣dem, semper haberi volumus) qui in annum sequentem, stati sint deli∣gati, iisque liceat quoquô tempore pro suô Arbitrio convenire res qua∣litercunque ad utilitatem, aut hono∣rem Collegii spectantes discutere, & tractare, suasque sententias, & con∣fulta ad Societatem in Comitiis ma∣joribus
referre: Denique caetera ex∣equi, & praestare quaecunque ipsis Serenissimus Princeps Jacobus Secun∣dus in Literis Patentibus nuper ad nos datis procuranda commisit. 13. In Thesaurarii Electione, ean∣dem prorsus formam, observari vo∣lumus quae à nobis anteà in Cen∣soribus creandis constituta est, nem∣pe ut eodem modo, eôdem tempore, & per eadem Suffragia eligatur, tùnc praetereà statuimus, ut Thesaurarius jam electus, priusquàm admittatur ad Officium suum, Chirographô Sigillô suô signatô obligetur Praesidi, & Societati nostrae, se monitu ejusdem Praesidis & Electorum, ipsis quatuorque aliis Sociis ad hanc rem à Collegio deli∣gatis, accepti, & expensi rationem fidelitèr redditurum, & denique cal∣culis subductis, quaecunque reliqui summa fuerit, Collegio debiti, eam se intra dies viginti à peracto com∣puto eidem Collegio praestiturum,
testes autem adhibeantur huic obli∣gationi tres extranei, qui nullô com∣munitatis jure nobiscum conjuncti sunt. 14. Nullis in posterum Literis Te∣stimonialibus, apponi volumus figil∣lum Collegii, preterquam istis, quas tempore Admissionis suae, per Statuta Sociis habere conceditur, iis nempe qui jus habent Suffragii in majoribus Comitiis; solvantur autom Bedello pro hujusmodi Literis decem solidos, pro aliis vero quibus extra Urbem practicandi Licentia conceditur ut∣potè Chirographis, & Sigillis Praesidis solummodò, & trium Electorum mu∣niendis, solvant permissi sex solidos octò denarios. 15. Cum nullus olim intra Col∣legium locus extiterit idoneus in quô Scripta nostra conservarentur, placuit ad hos usus in Musaeo Henr. Guii. Armigeri Scriniam, vel Char∣to-phylaceum extrui, cujus quatuor
sint Claves eorumque unam Praeses, alteram Thesaurarius, duorum au∣tem Censorum Seniorum, uterque itidem unam habeant, hic loci atque hâc Custodiâ contineri volumus, & servari, Principum Diplomata, Chi∣rographa, caeteraque Instrumenta Col∣legii; denique alias id genus Char∣tulas quascunque, & membranas, quae sunt majoris momenti: Prohi∣bemus autem indè proferri quid∣quam injussû Collegii, nisi fortè ur∣gente aliquâ necessitate alitèr visum fuerit deligatis, aut Praesidi, & Cen∣soribus, Praeterea statuimus ut eôdem locô reponatur Sigillum Commune Collegii, in Arculâ in hunc finem fabricatâ, cujus Clavem Praeses ha∣beat, & quoties opus fuerit in ma∣joribus Comitiis ipse aperiat, neque alibi quam in Comitiis praedictis cuicunque Instrumento Sigillum no∣strum Commune apponi volumus.
16. Statuimus & Ordinamus, Ut in Candidatorum vel Sociorum Or∣dinem nullus admittatur Chirurgus, Pharmacopaeus, aliusve aliquis ejus∣modi Artifex, qui aut artem quam∣cunque minùs liberalem unquam ex∣ercuerit, aut ad servitutem adstrictus in Officina Tyrocinium posuit, nè forte si tales in Collegium ita co∣optentur, non satis consuluisse videa∣mur, aut Dignitati nostrae, aut Hono∣ri Academiarum nostratium quas ta∣men summâ veneratione prosequi debemus, & semper volumus. FINIS.
