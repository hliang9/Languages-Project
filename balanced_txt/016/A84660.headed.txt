A DECLARATION Of His Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, AND His COUNCELL of WARRE, ON Behalfe of themselves and the whole ARMIE; Shewing the grounds of their present advance towards the City of LONDON. By the appointment of his Excellency Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX and his Councell of Warre. Signed IO. RUSHWORTH Secr. LONDON, Printed for George Whittington, 1647.
A Declaration from his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, and the Councel of Warre. VVHen this Army was formerly led by the ma∣nifold dispensations of Gods providence, and the grounds then declared, to advance to∣wards the City of London, we held it our du∣ty, to yeeld the Kingdom, the summe of those desires which we had to propose on behalf of it, our selves, wherein we should acquiesce: And having received from the Parliament, some hopes of due satisfaction therein, and some assurance from the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of the City of London, of their ready concurrence with us in those things, & also great resolution professed by them of their care and tender∣nesse to preserve all the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, safe, free, and inviolated, from attempts of all kinds, we doe ap∣peals to God, to the City, and to al men, what a speedy comply∣ance to their desires for our removal to a further distance, found in this Army, for preventing all feares, jealousies, and other in∣conveniencies to the City, and to give clear testimony, that wee had nothing in our breasts, but thoughts of peace, and the good and welfare both of Parliament, City, and Kingdom, notwith∣standing many false & scandalous reports raised, that we sought our selves, that we had vile and wicked ends, and that nothing would satisfie the souldier but the plunder of the City, the con∣trary whereof did manifestly appear, when they so readily mar∣ched
back upon hopes of satisfaction in their Desires of publike concernment. Having then upon the aforesaid confidence so withdrawne, and out of a just sense of the Countries suffering (by quarte∣ting) removed the Head-quarter of the Army above 40. miles from London, and dispersed the rest well nigh 200. miles for the more ease of all parts, and that we might give the better sa∣tisfaction to the Kingdom. And being in this secure way, and labouring after the suddain settlement of the Kingdom, we had even brought to perfection the particular proposals (included in the generals of our first Representation) to be sent to the Par∣liament, for a finall conclusion of all our troubles. And also had made good progresse towards the present reliefe of distressed Ireland, by assigning a competent force, both of horse and foot forthwith to have advanced for that service. But the Kingdoms & our Enemies being most vigilant & active to prevent and frustrate those good intentions, and indeavours of ours; (that they might carry on their former evill designs) and under-hand practises, and also preserve themselves from the hand of justice, they have endeavoured to cast the Kingdom in∣to a new and bloudy warre: And for that end have procured the under-hand-listing of several Reformadoes, and others, have contrived, promoted and caused to be entred into by severall persons a wicked and treasonable combination, as is is suffici∣ently manifested by a Declaration passed thereupon by both Houses of PARLIAMENT, the 23. of July last for the preven∣tion of the disturbances that were like to ensue thereupon; from which kind of disorders the City had been well preserved, du∣ring the space of almost 4 yeares, whilest the Militia was in the hands of the old Commissioners, whereby it appeares there was cause for the Army to intreat the Parliament, that the Militia might be returned into the hands it was in before, as also for divers other good Reasons. 1. The old Commissioners of the Militia (that have bin since left out) were not only persons without all exception, having bin formerly chosen and approved by the Parliament and City, but also men of whom the City, Parliament, and Kingdom have had above 4 yeares experience in the faithful discharge of their
trust, more than ever from the beginning, in the worst of times, and in the occasions of greatest dfficultie, had faithfully and constanly ingaged for, and with the Parliament in this cause; Men that were alwaies most desirous of a Peace, but of a safe and well grounded one and that had alwaies testified a great care to prevent all occasions of embroyling the Kingdome in a new Warre. Now that on a suddain this trust which they had so faithful∣ly discharged so long, should be taken out of their hands, and put ino the hands of others, some whereof (at the best) have been very coole in the service of the Parliament at the begin∣ning of this Warr; That this should be pressed and in a man∣ner forced upon the Parliament with such importunity from the Conmmon-Councell that some out of every Ward should be assigned to sollicite the Members of the House of Cemmons, every day as they went in and out at the House: with professi∣ons that they would never leave the doore of the House till they were satisfied in their Desires. That they would not be contented with the Militia of the City of London only, unlesse they might have power also over that of the Suburbs and out-parts: and all this before the peace of the Kingdome was setled or the Propositions sent to the King for that purpose. These things ministred great cause of suspition, that this al∣teration of the Militia was in order to a designe, and to make the tearmes of the Peace, and agreement with the King, (on which the security of the whole Kingdome and their posterity is to be bottomed) more sutable to the private bargainings and undertakings of some men, then to the publique welfare of the whole Kingdome, in its security and prosperity, for the present and in future times. But this design discovered it selfe more cleerely by such things as accompanied the pursuit of this alte∣ration of the Militia, and ensued upon the obtaining thereof: At the same time that the alteration of the Militia of London was set on foot, the same persons with as much earnestnesse pres∣sed for the disbanding of this Army, before any thing was setled for the security and liberty of the Kingdome. At the same time the Common-Councel was new modulized, and a Lord Mayor chosen that might suite with the present designe in hand: At the
time (under colour of differences in some circumstances of Church Government) it was earnestly endeavoured, that such as had been constantly true and most faithfull to the interest of the Kingdome should be disabled, to have any imployment in Church or Common wealth, either in England or Ireland, and without any such colour or pretence, divers persons were left out of the Common-Councell, and Militia of eminent deserts and fidelity: and others brought into their roomes that had ei∣ther testified an ill affection, or little affection to the Parliament and their cause: and such as seeking to withdraw themselves from all imployment in the beginning of this Warre, now at the winding up thereof, are ambitious to thrust themseve into imployment, with a design (as may justly be suspected) to fru∣strate and overthrow in the close of all, the fruit and effect of all the cost and bloud that hath bin spent and spilt in this cause: and after that with difficulty, and not without reluctancy, in the Houses of Parliament they had obtained the power of the Militia, in the City of London, and also in the out-parts for the space of one yeare. Many Officers and under Officers in the Trained bands of known trust and fidelity were displaced, and others of more doubtfull affections placed in their roomes, little care was taken of the honour of the Parliament, which was continually trampled under foot, and their authority affron∣ted by every rabble of Women, Apprentices, Reformadoes and Souldiers, which latter sort of persons were thereby so incoura∣ged to rise higher and higher, in their tumultuous carriages against the Houses, till at length it is risen to the higth of bar∣barous and monstrous violence against the Parliament, that they might set themselves on work, and the Kingdome on fire againe. And now at length, the design appeares open faced, and though the Militia be made as the principal ground of the quarrell, yet by the late vowes and engagements set one foot before any alteration of the Militia, and the pressing so much the Message of the 12 of May. and the Kings comming to Lon∣don to confirme the same, shew, that the Militia is desired but in order to that designe, and to force the Parliament (being wholly in their power) to such Termes of peace as they pleased
2. In the next place when the interest of the Common-Councel, in their change of the Militia shall be claymed as the Birth-right of the City of London, (which they never had any colour to pretend to, saving by the indulgency of the Parlia∣ment unto them since this Parliament, in respect of the great use they have had of them, and the many good services they have received from them) It is time for all the Kingdom to look to their Birth-rights, if such a claime shall be held up against both the Houses of Parliament, That upon no occasion whatsoever, nor in no time of danger and distraction whatsoever, they may appoint those that shall have the power of the Militia of London without the consent of the Common-Councel; especially when as the Houses shal sit under their power. The late Example may evidence to all the World, who shall be Masters of the Parliaments freedome and Resolutions: And common reason will teach every man who shall bee Masters of the Birth-rights of the whole kingdom when there shall bee no Army on foot, when they have the confidence to dispute for the Mastery, notwithstanding such an Army as this to checke and ballance them in behalf of the Kingdom and Parliament. 3. Lastly, the Army discerning how intimate some of the new Militia were with some of the 11 accused Members, how for∣ward they were to comply and act with them in their endea∣vours, to raise a new Warre; how they made 18. or 19. Votes in order thereunto together with them in one night. All which, the Common-Councell and Parliament disliked and revoked, how notwithstanding afterwards they secretly promoted their Designes by private Listings, which now ap∣pear to have bin still working under ground. The Army, we say, observing this, and having nothing more in their thoughts and desires, then to settle a speedy, safe, and wel-grounded peace, and to prevent a new warre, found it ne∣cessary to desire, That the Militia might be put into the hands wherein it was formerly, who had approved themselves both to the Army,
Parliament and Kingdome, to be sober-minded men, and not given to any practise whereby a new Warre might be kind∣led. To the intent, that the Army being secured by that meanes from that danger, might with the more confidence retire fur∣ther from the City, inlarge their Quarter for the greater ease of the Kingdom, and intend wholly the setling of a sure peace in this Kingdom, and a speedy and effectuall reliefe of Ireland, which was almost brought to a period, and nothing in the sight of man could have hindred, but this cursed practice of violence upon the Parliament, under pretence of the Militia, which accor∣ding to our desire, being restored againe into the hands of the old Commissioners, by an Ordinance of both Houses, dated the 21. of July, (in pursuance of the aforesaid treasonable combination) se∣verall Petitions were presented to the Common-Councell of the Ci∣ty of LONDON, in the name of the Apprentices and others, importing their Desires, that the Militia of the City might conti∣nue in the hands of the former Commissioners, according to the Or∣dinance of the 4 of May last. Whereupon Munday July the sixe and twentieth, the Com∣mon-Councel of the City presents their Petitions to both Hou∣ses for changing the Militia, wherein the House of Lords re∣fuse to alter their Resolutions, the House of Commons answe∣red they would take it into consideration the next morning. Notwithstanding which, the City and kingdom cannot be ig∣norant with what rage and insolency the tumult of Apprenti∣ces the same day forced both Houses. They blockt up their doores, swearing they would keep them in till they had passed what votes they pleased; they threatned the Houses if they gran∣ted not their desires, knocking, hooting, and hallowing so at the Parl. doores, that many times the Members could not be heard to speak or debate, not suffering the house of Commons to di∣vide for determining such Questions, as were put, crying out that those that gave their votes against them, should be sent out to them, very often and loudly, saying, Agree, agree, dispatch well wait no longer, & in this outragious māner, they continued at the house door above 8 hours together, the city guards there present
the City releiving them, by reason whereof the House was forced to Vote what that rude multitude would demand, and then adjourned the House til the next morning; After which the House rising, the Speaker and many Members going out of the House, they forc'd them back againe into the House: Many of the Apprentises pressing in with them, where they stood with their hats on their heads, and compelled the Speaker to take the Chair, and the House to Vote in their presence what they pleased, committing ma∣ny other insolencies, as is published by the Speaker of the House of Com∣mons in his Declaration, and is too well known by all then present; And during the time of this execrable violence done by the said Apprentises, Westminster Hal and the Pallace yard was fild with Reformadoes and other ill-affected persons designed to back them. After this the Houses being Adjourned till Friday following, upon the Thursday the Apprentises printed and posted a paper of severall places of the City, requiring all their fellowes to be early at the Parliament the next morning, for that they intended to adjourne by seven of the clock, and that for a moneth. Thus the Speakers with many of the Members of both Houses were driven away from the Parliament. This in brief being the true state of things as they have broke forth with∣in these few dayes, (which are so contrary to all those pretences of Peace, and detestation of a new War of late so frequently held forth on all sides,) all men may observe to what maturity the long projected Designe of some men, (of whom are those that are impeached by as,) is now brought, and may be traced in the severall steps thereof, as it hath tended to the enslaving this Kingdom, and the destruction of all such wel-affected people who would not comply with them therein; so as by what now is come to light, the justnesse of that cause, this Army had engaged themselves in, and the great and wonderfull mercy of God in continuing them together, we as∣sure our selves doth now clearly appear to all mens eyes and apprehensions, and will every day more and more be acknowledged, even by those that have heretofore made a question of it. And if when this Kingdom hath spent so much of its bloud and treasure, hath past through such unheard of dangers, and overcome such difficulties so many yeers together, All that they must now hope for and rest in, must only be what the King grants in his Message of the 12 of May last: And if this must be imposed upon mens judgements and consciences by an oath, & now entred into in a tumultuous and unlawfull way, and by outrage maintained in despight and contempt of the Parliament. If rather then this should not be accomplished, the Parliament it self must be violated and forced into the
hands of such of the Members thereof as have secretly abetted and fomen∣ted those practises to that end; That these hidden counsels and workes of darknesse might, when they come to their full birth, have the image of high∣est authority in the face of them the better to gaine credit thereunto, and secure the authors of them from punishment; For the evidence of all which we refer our selves to the particulars in our Charge against the 11 Members, compared with those passages of late broke forth before rehearst, unto which we shall now only adde (and leave it to the consideration of all wise and good men) with what Artifice and boldnesse these Members have serv'd themselves of those horrid tumults and violences of their own creating (in∣stead of showing their detestation of them) againe to intrude themselves into the publike managing of affairs, and inevitably to embroyle the King∣dome in a new war; which their own revenge and the compassing of their former plots and designes makes them so greedily thirst after. If these things (we say) must be the end and up-shot of all, what then remaines to this poore Kingdome and all true hearted Englishmen, but to joyne toge∣ther as one man with their counsels, estates and lives in this way, as our last refuge under God, which he by his wise and gracious providence hath pro∣vided and reserved by keeping up this Army even to a Miracle, so to prevent the aforesaid evils, and to procure to this dying Kingdome yet a setled peace and happinesse, if it be his blessed will? These things being seriously considered by us, wee have thought fit in the name of the Army to declare, that all such Members of either House of Parliament as are already with the Army for the securitie of their persons, and for the ends aforesaid are forced to absent themselves from Westminster, that wee shall hold and esteem them as persons in whom the publick trust of the Kingdom is still remaining, though they cannot for the present fit as a Parliament with freedome and safety at Westminster; and by whose advice and counsels, we desire to governe our selves in the managing these waighty affaires; and to that end we invite them to make repaire to this Armie to joyne with us in this great cause, wee being resolved, and do hereby faithfully oblige our selves to stand by them therein, and to live and die with them against all Opposition whatsoever, and in particular wee do hold our selves bound to owne that honourable act of the Speaker of the House of Commons, who upon the grounds hee himselfe expressed in his Declaration sent unto us, hath actually withdrawn himselfe; and here∣upon wee do further ingage to use our utmost and speedy endeavours, that hee and those Members of either House, that are thus inforced away from their attendance at Westminster may with freedome and securitie fit there,
and againe discharge their trust as a free and a legall Parliament, and in the meane time we do declare against that late choice of a new Speaker by some Gentlemen at Westminster, as contrary to all Right Reason, Law and Cu∣stome, and wee professe our selves to bee most clearly satisfied all our judgements, and are also confident the Kingdome will herein concurre with us, that as things now stand there is no free nor legall Parliament sitting, being through the aforesaid violence at present suspended. And that the Orders, Votes, or Resolutions, forced from the Houses on Munday the 26. of July last, as also all such as shall passe in this Assembly of some few Lords and Gentlemen at Westminster, under what pretence and colour soever are void and null, and ought not to be submitted unto by the free∣borne Subjects of England. And that we may prevent that slavery designed upon us and the Nation, that the Kingdome may be restored to a happy State of a visible Governe∣ment now eclipsed and darkened; wee hold our selves bound by our duty to God and the Kingdome; to bring to condigne punishment the Authors and Promoters, of that unparalleld violence done to the Parliament; and in that to all the freerborne Subjects of England, that are or hereafter shall be; and therefore we are resolved to march up towards London, where we do expect that the well-affected people of that City will deliver up unto us, (or otherwise put into safe Custody, so as they may be reserved to a legall Triall,) the eleven impeached Members that have againe thrust themselves into the management of publick affaires by this wicked designe. And that all others will give us such Assistance therein, that the Mem∣bers of both Houses may receive due incouragement to returne to West∣minster, there to fit with all freedome, and so to performe their trust, as shall conduce to the settlement of this distracted Kingdome; and to inflict such punishments upon these late Offenders as shall deters any for the future to make the like attempt. Our lives have not been deare unto us for the publick good, and being now resolved by the assistance of God, to bring these delinquents to their de∣served punishments, as that then which, there cannot be any thing of more publick concernement to the Kingdome, wee trust (if it shall come to that,) our bloud shall not be accounted too deare a price for the accomplishment of it. And if any in the City will ingage themselves against us to protect these Persons, and so put the Kingdome againe into a new and miserable Warre, The bloud must be laid to the account of such person, as the Au∣thors thereof. And lastly, Because it is the maine Engine of ours and the Kingdomes e∣nemies,
to render us odious by possessing the mindes of men, that we gape only after the plunder of this great and wealthy City, as the experience of the contrary carriage in all Townes that wee have taken yeeldeth unto us a Testimony beyond the example of any Army, so wee do from our hearts declare, that wee abhorre the thoughts thereof, and we doubt not but the world shall see our actions answerable to our professions, and that we shall not cause any man to suffer but by his owne default; and that God will ma∣nifest we have only in our eyes, that Iustice may have a free course, the Par∣liament a free sitting and voting, and a ful vindication of the late violence done to them. And as for the City of Westminster, the Borough of Southwarke, the Hamlets, and the rest of the suburbs and out parts, as wee are informed, that they are not so ready to engage themselves in a new warre as some would have them, so wee are sensible of the hard condition that they are brought into, even by them that claime a Right against both Hous of Parliament, (a strange claim against a Parliament, though more reasonable against others,) not to be subjected to a Militia without their own consent, and yet will not be contented, unlesse they may have others subjected unto them, and lay what burthens they please upon them, without allowing them any part of vote or consent with them; In which points of common might, and Equity wee shall not be wanting (in a due way) to assist them for the obtaining of their just desires and immunities, is being our cheife aim to settle Peace with Truth and Righteousnesse throughout the Kingdome, that none may be oppressed in his just freedome and Liberties, much lesse the Parliament it selfe, which things being duly setled, we shall bee as ready al∣so to assure unto the King his just Rights and authoritie as any that pre∣tend it never so much, for the better upholding of an ill cause, and the countenance of tumultuous violence against the Parliament, the which our honest, just, and necessary undertakings, as wee are resolved to pursue with the utmost hazzard of our lives and fortunes, so we doubt not but we shall find Gods accustomed goodnesse and assistance with us therein, till wee have brought them to a good and happy conclusion for this poore distracted and languishing Kingdome. FINIS.
