A DECLARATION OF THE English Army NOW IN SCOTLAND, Touching the Justness & Necessity Of their present PROCEEDINGS in that NATION. Imprimatur Joh: Rushworth. London, Printed by Edward Husband and John Field, Printers to the Parliament of England. August 12. 1650.
For the Under-Officers and Soldiers of the English Army: From the People of Scotland. IT concerns you, as you desire not to imbrue your hands in the blood of the Lords people without a cause, and to be answerable to the Righ∣teous Judge of the World in the day of your Accompts, to consider whether the Invading of the King∣dom of Scotland, wherein we, and all our Interests are included, be not a thing most sinful and unlawful, which will bring wrath and indignation from the Lord upon all those who are engaged therein, or accessory thereto. And because we know that things are mis∣represented to you, and you are made to believe, That your Undertaking is Just and Necessary; We shall therefore, for your Information, shortly shew you how unwarrantable the gounds are, upon which your so cal∣led Parliament have concluded and commanded to Invade this Land; that, if it be possible, your sin and our affliction may be avoided. The first Ground which is hinted at in the Declara∣tion of your so called Parliament, is, the Commissio∣ners of Scotland their Usurping upon Acts of Legisla∣tive
Power, and their frequent pretensions to, and con∣testations about a joynt Interest in some Acts of it, whilest they were resident in England, and whilest no∣thing but Friendship and Unanimity in the same Cause was pretended: But it is most certain, That the Com∣missioners of Scotland did never claim, nor assume to themselves any power concerning the making or giving of Laws in England: The most that they did, was, 1. The Committee of both Kingdoms being appoint∣ed by the joynt Resolutions of the Parliament of both Kingdoms, they acted therein in a co-ordinate way in things of common Interest. 2. They did often, by Letters and otherwise, represent to the two Houses of Parliament their desires, and give them Warning when they were either negligent in, or averse from their duty in the work of Uniformity. 3. They pleaded for a joynt Interest in the Kings Person, he being King of Scotland as well as of England. The second, and a main Ground of Invasion, which is much insisted upon, is, The late unlawful Engage∣ment against ENGLAND in the year 1648. But how Unjustly and Unchristianly this is charged upon this Kingdom, will appear to you in these particulars: 1. That Engagement was protested against in the Par∣liament of Scotland, by a considerable part of the Par∣liament it self, even those who at first entred into Co∣venant with England, and sent an Army for their As∣sistance, and are now in place and power in Scotland. 2. Not onely did the Body of the Ministery of the Land preach and pray against it, but all the Judicato∣ries of the Kirk did supplicate the Parliament against it, and the General Assembly did in the very time of
the going forth of the Army, publish a large Declara∣tion against it. 3. As many Committees of War in Shires did petition the Parliament against it; so were the Body of the people of the Land, especially the godly, so unsatisfied with it, that as they did cry to God against it, so did they refuse to contribute there∣unto, and concur therein; and because of this, suffered great affliction and oppression from a prevailing party of Malignants who carried it on. 4. Those who had protested against it in Parliament, and the generality of the well-affected in the Land, did before the defeat at Preston, begin to stir in Arms against it, and did not lay them down, until they had got all power out of the hands of that party that carried it on. 5. The House of Commons and Lieut: General Cromwel by their Letters, the one to the General Assembly, the other to the Committee of Estates, do in a large way bear Testimony to the Innocency of the honest party in Scotland in that particular, and did also give them As∣sistance against those who carried on that Engage∣ment. The third Ground is, The protestation given in by the Commissioners of this Kingdom at Westminster, a∣gainst the taking away of the Kings, and changing of the Government; but this, as it was an innocent and harmless, so it was it a necessary Duty, not onely be∣cause of the Irregularity and Insolency of proceeding in these things by Men wanting Authority, and the joynt Interest of the Kingdom of Scotland in the Kings Person; but also because they could not but foresee the great Scandal, and many sad consequences that would follow thereupon to both Kingdoms.
The fourth Ground, is this Kingdoms refusing to re∣pair the Damages that England sustained in the unlaw∣ful Engagement in the year 1648. But to say nothing that it was Injustice to demand Reparation of those Damages from those who were Sufferers themselves: Reparation was not refused; but as the Committee of Estates gave assurance to the Parliament of England, That none who had been active in, or consenting to the said Engagement, should be imployed in any pub∣lique place or trust whatsoever, without the advice and consent of the Kingdom of England; so did they not refuse all fair amicable ways of Reparation, but de∣sired to know the particular Wrongs and Damages, and upon knowledge thereof, offered to give just Satisfaction. The fifth Ground is, A Resolution of those in the Kingdom of Scotland again to Invade England, which is fancied upon very unwarrantable Grounds; as, the refusing of a Treaty, the Proclaiming of Charts Stuart King of England, and promising him Assistance a∣gainst England, and declaring against the party that now prevails in England, as Sectaries, &c. To all which we say, That this Kingdom did refuse to treat with your Parliament, not because they had a purpose to Invade the Kingdom of England, but because a pre∣vailing party have taken away the House of Lords, and also driven away and imprisoned many Members of the House of Commons, and changed the Government, they could not acknowledge the Remnant for the Su∣preme Authority of England. And for the King, they did no otherwise proclaim him King, then in the Ordi∣nary way, that hath been followed by both Kingdoms,
since they were both united under one King; and they have given him no promise but this, That they will by all lawful Means within their power and calling, ac∣cording to the Covenant, contribute their Endeavors for his peaceable Restitution to the Government of his other Dominions. And as to the declaring against them as Sectaries, it is far from a conclusion of making War against them; we can and ought to mourn and pray, and bear Testimony against then Errors, and yet be far from thoughts of Invading of them: We will assure you, That as those Grounds con∣tained in the Declaration of your so called Parliament, do not conclude it; so hath there not hitherto been any such Question debated, nor any such Resolution taken in the publique Councels of this Kingdom, but what hath been done here, hath been meerly in refe∣rence to Defence of the Land, if we should be Invaded from England. Therefore it concerns you in your consciences, as before the Lord, to weigh well whether God will countenance you in such a thing, and whether it be not a fearful breach of Covenant in you, after England hath Sworn before God, and Angels and Men, to pre∣serve the Union and Peace between the Kingdoms, to come without cause to Invade this Land, and make War upon us, and oppress us, and shed our Blood; we will assure you, That all who know God in Scot∣land, cry to Heaven against such Oppression; and you have cause to be afraid, That because of the same, God will arise to execute Judgement upon it: Your quar∣rel now is not against Malignants, but against those who in the Integrity of their Spirits have been follow∣ing
Jesus Christ and his Cause, and studying to walk answerable to the Gospel, and who helped England in the day of her distress, and have suffered much on her behalf; chusing rather to endure all the afflictions that the Malice of Malignants could devise, then to break with England, or set one foot in that Land in an ho∣stile way. Those among you shall be wise, who shall take Warning to proceed no farther in an evil way, lest God, who is the Judge of all things, look upon such Injustice, and Ingratitude, and Breach of Covenant, and require it.
To the People of Scotland, (especially those among them, that know and fear the Lord) from whom yesterday we received a Paper, directed, To the Under-Officers and Soldiers of the English Army; We the Officers and Soldiers of the English Army do send Greeting. AT the beginning of the great and wonderful workings of God in these two Nations of England and Scotland, We the Under-Officers and Soldiers of the English Army, now in Scotland, were most of us, if not all, men of pri∣vate Callings, and not all interested in Matters of Publique and State Affairs; but yet very many of us, in whom the Lord had be∣gun to reveal himself in the Face of Jesus Christ, were sensible of the Antichristian Tyranny that was exercised by the late King, and His Prelates, over the Consciences, Bodies, and Estates of the True Spiritual Church of Jesus Christ; namely, Those that were born again, and united to him by his Spirit; who were then by that Antichristian crew, termed Puritans, Sectaries, Schismaticks, &c. And for not conforming to all the Canons and Ordinances of their National Church, were frequently imprisoned, banished, and otherwise grievously molested at the pleasure of those that then ruled amongst us. Under these sad sufferings of the people of God, our souls mourned, and understanding by the manifold gracious promises in the Word of God, That a time of Deliverance was to be expected to the Church of Christ, and destruction and ruine to Babylon; Our hearts, together with all the truly godly in England, were exceedingly stirred up to pray to the Lord, even day and night, That he would arise to destroy Antichrist, and to save his People: Whilest this Spirit of Prayer was poured forth upon Gods people in England, attempts are made upon Scotland, to bring them to a conformity in Religious worship, by endeavoring to impose upon them a Popish Service Book, which was through the great goodness
of God, by his people in Scotland, reserted; which made the wrath of the late King and His Prelates, wax so hot against them, so as Scotland had no other way to preserve it self, but by coming into England with an Army; which the godly in England did not then count an Invasion to destroy England, no more then they do this our present march for the ruine of Scotland, but rejoyced to see some appearing against that Antichristian power that had persecu∣ted the Saints, and were assured, That the Lord was come forth to answer the many Prayers and Tears that were then poured and pouring forth for that purpose; and therefore so far as we have any opportunity farthered the designs of that Army, some of us hazard∣ing our lives by spreading their Book, intituled, The Scots Intenti∣ons, and pleading for the Justness of their Proceedings. Let us remember how the Lord was pleased graciously to answer the prayers of his people at that time, in their Deliverance from the Army raised by the late King, and his Prelates, for the de∣struction of all the people of God in England and Scotland; in∣somuch, That soon after Scotland sits in Peace, enjoying their for∣mer Liberties, without being imposed upon by the Antichristian Prelacy in England; and England obtains a Parliament, to whom they have opportunity to complain of their grievances, and through the great goodness of God so constituted, that grievances are heard, and overtures made to the late King for their redress, which was so irksome to His Oppressing, Tyrannical, and Bloody spirit, that he again betook him self to overthrow the Parliament by force, and to that end entertains the Officers of the Army that had gone forth against our Brethren of Scotland; and withdrawing himself from his Parliament, an appearance of a Civil War begins, which bring made known to us, the Inferior Officers and Soldiers of this Army (then in our Private Callings) we found our hearts extraor∣dinarily stirred up by the Lord, to assist the Parliament against the King; being abundantly satisfied in our Judgments and Consciences, That we were called forth by the Lord, to be Instrumental to bring about that, which was our continual prayer to God, (viz.) The destruction of Antichrist, and the Deliverance of his Church and people. And upon this simple account we engaged, not knowing the deep policies of worldly Statesmen, and have ever since hazarded our lives in the high places of the field, (where we have seen the wonders of the Lord) against all the opposers of this work
of Jesus Christ, whom we have all along seen going with us, and making our way plain before us. And having these things singly in our eye, namely, The destruction of Antichrist, the advancement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Deliverance and Reformation of his Church, in the Establishment of his Ordinances amongst them, in purity according to his Word, and the just civil Liberties of English∣men: We did many of us rejoyce at the Covenant, because we found in it a strain towards these ends, although some being more enlightned, did apprehend it to be so mixt with worldly interest, That they justly feared the interest of Jesus Christ would be onely pretended to, and the interests of this world, yea, of Antichrist himself carried under a vizard, as we have since had abundant ex∣perience of; which hath made us (we confess) not to idolize the Covenant (as we fear too many do) though we trust it will appear before God, Angels, and Men, That we shall ever pursue its true and lawful ends, according to the plain and candid meaning there∣of; though we do not upon every occasion urge the Covenant, (as we see every party, though as far different as light and darkness, apt to do,) the Lord having by his Word, and by his Spirit, con∣vinced us of our duty therein, though there had been no such Co∣venant at all entred into: But when we saw, That under pretence of the Covenant, a corrupt party in Parliament, by their worldly policy, after the war was end∣ed in England, and the late Kings party subdued with the loss of Thousands of the lives of Saints (whose death is precious in the sight of the Lord) did endeavor to set up the King upon his own terms, and with him to establish a National Church Government, not in all things agreeable to the Word of God, but is destructive to the just Liberties of the True Spiritual Church of Christ, which he hath by his own most precious Blood purchased for them, and is now come forth to bestow upon them, which did sufficiently demonstrate it self by the dealings of the then Master Builders with the Churches of Jesus Christ, in, and about Lndon, that were then threatned to be dissolved, and Laws made to prevent the Com∣munion of Saints with one another, except onely in that one Pub∣lique Form then about to be established, to the astonishment of many of us that had lifted up our hands to God, and sworn to en∣deavor a Reformation according to the Word of God; and therefore after much waiting upon God by Prayer, and examining our own hearts, about the ends and sincerity thereof, we were
abundantly satisfied, that it was not onely lawful, but our duty to keep our Arms in our hands, till the ends before mentioned should be accomplished; and to that purpose, the Army whereof we are a part, did refuse to disband, did march up to London to propose to the Parliament a way of Establishment that might be more for the carrying on of the ends of Religion and Liberty, though therein we were not at that time successful, yet most wonderfully and gra∣ciously preserved by the Lord, and extraordinarily convinced, after much seeking the Face of God, that our failing was in endeavoring to set up the King upon any terms, he being a man of so much Blood, that the Lord would have no peace with him, nor any that should go about to establish him: Whereupon after his own hard heart had hindred him from yielding to any overtures that were made to him by the Parliament, through whom all the Armies Proposals were to be tendred, and a second War more dangerous then the former contrived by him, and his Son now with you, together with those in Scotland that hated us of the Army of England, under the name of Sectaries, being by the unspeakable goodness and mighty power of God waded through, and a second testimony given from Heaven, to justifie the proceedings of his poor servants against that bloody Antichristian brood, though with the loss of many precious Saints; we were then powerfully convinced, that the Lords pur∣pose was to deal with the late King as a man of blood: And be∣ing perswaded in our consciences, That he and his Monarchy was one of the ten horns of the Beast spoken of, Revel. 17.12, 13, 14, 15. And being witnesses to so much of the innocent blood of the Saints that he had shed in supporting the Beast; and considering the loud cryes of the souls of the Saints under the Altar, we were ex∣traordinarily carried forth to desire Justice upon the King, that man of Blood: And to that purpose Petitioned our Superior Officers, and the Parliament, to bring him to Justice, which accordingly, by an high hand of Providence was brought to pass; which act we are confident the Lord will own, in preserving the Commonwealth of England against all Kingdoms and Nations, that shall adventure to meddle with them upon that account: When God executes his judgments upon malefactors, let none go about to resist: when he brings forth those his enemies that will not suffer Jesus Christ to be King in the midst of his Sants, and breaks them in pieces like a Potters vessel; let not Scotland, nor any other Nation say, What dost thou? We fear they have been too busie already, the Lord that
sees the secrets of all hearts, knows the compliance of Scotland with the late Kings issue now with you, was in order to disturb the Peace of England, for being Gods executioners upon a bloody Tyrant, and a supporter of the Throne of the Beast: But blessed be the Lord, the crafty are taken in their own snare, England sits in peace, whilest Scotland receives into their chief City, their new King, at the very hour wherein an Army that had matched 300 miles, is facing them at the very gates. We wish our Brethren of Scotland, especially those that truly fear the Lord, would consider these things, and not slight the providences of God so much as they do: When Scotland chose new gods, and would have a King out of a Family that God had rejected, then was war in the Gates: And though we do not think Providences alone, a sufficient rule for Gods people to walk by, yet we do know that the Lord speaks to his people by his Providence, as well as by his Word; and he is angry with his people that do not take notice thereof, and promiseth bles∣sing to those that do, Psal. 107. and the latter end. And here give us leave (not in a boasting spirit, but in meekness and fear) to tell you, That we are perswaded we are poor unwor∣thy instruments in Gods hand, to break his enemies, and preserve his people. You have acknowledged us in your own Papers to be a Rod of Iron to dash in pieces the Malignants, but withal, say: We must no be broken in pieces, because we now set our selves against the Lot of Gods inheritance. Let us here speak for our selves, yea, the Lord speak for us, who knows our hearts, and all our ways; we value the Churches of Jesus Christ, who are the lot of Gods inheritance Ten thousand times above our own lives; yea, we do bless the Lord we are not onely a Rod of Iron to dash the common enemies in pieces, but also a hedg (though very unworthy) about Christs Vine∣yard; and if we know our own hearts, where ever the lot of Gods inheritance shall appear to be found in Scotland, we shall think it our duty, to the utmost hazzard of our lives to preserve the same: But if there be any that have taken councel together against the Lord, and against his anointed, when the Lord hath decreed to set upon his holy Hill of Sion; we are perswaded the Lord hath brought us hither as instruments, through which, he will speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. We desire it may be known to you our Brethren of Scotland, That we are not Soldiers of Fortune, we are not meerly the servants of men, we have not onely proclaimed Jesus Christ, the King of Saints, to be our King
by profession; but desire to submit to him upon his own terms, and to admit him to the exercise of his Royal Authority in our hearts, and to follow him whether soever he goeth, he having of his own good will entred into a Covenant of Grace with his poor Saints; and be assured, it is he that leadeth us into Scotland, he hath done in England and Ireland: And therefore we do in the spirit of bro∣therly love, and of the fear of the Lord, beseech you to look about you, for our Lord Jesus is coming amongst you as a refining fire, and as Fullers sope; and blessed are those in whom the least dram of sin∣cerity shall be found. We have a Paper directed to us from the people of Scotland, it having been publiquely made known to us at the head of our Regiments, wherein we are first desired to consider the lawfulness of our marching into Scotland. We bless God we did that before we came, and are abundantly satisfied, that we are brought hither by the Lord; nay, many of us lying under tempta∣tions of flesh and blood, and going about to frame excuses to take us from this march, found, that to have staid behinde, had been to have turned our backs upon Jesus Christ, and to have deprived our selves of much sweet communion with God, that now through his goodness we do enjoy. We have also considered the Arguments, by which you go about to weaken the grounds of the Parliaments, and our Superior Offi∣cers, leading us into Scotland, and must needs give you this ren, That we are still abundantly established in this belief, that what the Parliament of England hath done in sending us into Scotland, hath been of absolute necessity to preserve them selves from being destroy∣ed in their Religion and Liberties, which they have been at so much cost both of blood and treasure, to purchase and preserve; and therefore by the way, we must needs tell you, that we cannot en∣dure to hear them called, A Pretended Parliament, which we desire you to take notice of, That if you write to us again, you would speak more reverendly of the Authority of our Nation, or else we shall easily think you will upon every occasion, be ready to invade Eng∣land, that you may set up an Authority, which you may call law∣ful. And let us, as in the presence of the Lord, farther assure you, That we have already examined our consciences, as before the Lord, and have a clear assurance in our hearts, That he will countenance us in this Action, and that we do not break any Covenant which we have Sworn before God, Angels and Men, but could be contented,
should we not thereby Idolize the Covenant, to march to any En∣gagement with you, if called thereunto by the Lord, with the Co∣venant on the Tops of our Pikes, and let the Lord Judge who hath observed the Ends of the Covenant best, you or we; Yet we do acknowledge, We have not been the exact Performers, though not the wilful Breakers thereof: Our consciences also bear us record, We do above any thing in the world, desire the Union of the two Nations; and it is our prayer daily, That those that fear the Lord in England and Scotland may become one in the hand of the Lord, and joyn together in the advancement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and throwing down, and trampling upon the Seat of the Beast. Why should not Scotland, as well as England, rejoyce to see the Horns of the Beast cut off, that we may joyn together, to hate the Whore, and to burn her flesh with sire? The Lord is our witness (whom we fear) we come not to oppress you, or shed your blood; we have cryed to the Lord again and again to prevent it; we have sent our Declarations of love to the People of God in Scotland which some amongst you, though they pretend to an∣swer, yet do most injuriously and unchristianly keep from their sight, nay most falsly misrepresenting us as a people come with intentions to destroy the poor Inhabitants, and that we are left of our God to be destroyed: but we have made our prayer to the Lord, and made known before him their sayings, who hath told the people of Scotland, That God hath forsaken us; and therefore bid them per∣secute and take us, for now the Sectaries day is come, &c. But the Lord is still with us, he is our Refuge, and a present help in trouble, ready to be found: we do believe, the cry of the oppressed in Scot∣land will be heard, and wo be to those that are the cause thereof. Our Quarrel is still against Malignants, the Root whereof is now, through the evil policy of some Statesmen, become the Head of Scotland. We dare not quarrel with those whose hearts are upright with Jesus Christ, and faithful and loving to England, but with those who are most treacherous and false to both; and therefore we dare not any of us, though tempted thereto by your Papers, be so carnally wise, as to desert the Cause and Work of Jesus Christ, in which we have hitherto been so long and so miraculously carried on. Do you think we are men so weakly principled, as to be perswaded without the least strength of Argument, to desert the Interest of our own Nation, and expose thousands of the precious Saints of Jesus Christ, to be trampled upon as the dirt in the streets, when the Lord is about
to put on their beautiful garments, and to make them a praise in the earth? Or can we (think you) betray our superior Officers, in whom we see so much of the sweet Spirit of Jesus Christ, into your hands, whose mouthes are opened wide to devour them: we pray you not to wait for such a thing. The Lord hath brought us hither by his Providence, and upon him we shall with confidence depend, till we see a glorious issue, which we humbly and heartily desire may be without the effusion of any more blood; and (if it be the will of God) both speedy and comfortable to you and us, that we may re∣turn with joy into England, and leave Scotland rejoycing, that an English Army hath been amongst them, which possibly may be the sooner effected, were you and we suffered to confer and open our hearts one to another: we do believe much of the bitterness of spi∣rit would be allayed in our Brethren of Scotland, did they know how exceedingly we are slandred by the pens and tongues of many of your Kirkmen, concerning our Religion and Faith towards God, which though we may not vainly boast of, yet according to the A∣postles direction, we are ready to give an answer to the meanest Christian in Scotland, that shall ask a reason of the faith and hope that is in us with meekness and fear. And indeed we account our best way of contending with those Slanderers, is to pray the Lord to make our hearts sound in his Statutes, that we be not ashamed, that so we sanctifying the Lord God in our hearts, and having a good conscience, they that speak evil of us as of evil doers, may be ashamed whilest they falsly our good conversation in Christ. And thus we have in the naked plainness of our souls opened our hearts unto you our dear Brethren that fear the Lord in Scotland, where-ever you be found, whether in the highest Councels or the poorest Cottages, who though you now lie scattered, the Lord will in his due time bring you together, and binde you up as his Jewels, and make you one with those that fear the Lord amongst us, which the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in him our God and our Father also, bring to pass in his due time; and in the mean time make both you and us wise to understand the things that con∣cern the exalting of Christs Kingdom: That in all our undertakings we may be subservient to the affairs of Jesus Christ, and above all things take heed how we stir up any of the powers or strength of this world, to destroy one another. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, be with you. Amen. From the Leaguer at Muscleborough, August 1.1650. FINIS.
