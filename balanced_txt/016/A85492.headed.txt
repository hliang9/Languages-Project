A CAL AND A VVARNING, TO ALL Priests, Professors and People, VVho have and do profess the Scriptures, that they may try their Doctrines and Practises by it, and may own condemnation in their Doctrines and Practises, wherein they are contrary to the Scriptures. AND A TENDER VISITATION TO The whole VVORLD, That they may own this their Visitation, and may be healed and restored to the Lord; And this may serve for a LOOKING GLASS, wherein People may see what visage they are of, and how they stand related as unto GOD. By a Sufferer in Hartford Goale, for faithful witness-bearing, against this sinful generation; known by the name of JOHN GOULD. London, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth neer Aldersgate, 1657.
THis following testimony was given forth chiefly as out of tender love to the Priests and Profes∣sors, and inhabitants of Hartford and Ware, and the countrey thereabout, who lyes in darkness and igno∣rance, under blinde guides, and so are ever learning, and cannot come to the knowledge of the truth; and this is written onely for their information, but may be serviceable in any part of the world, among such who doth profess the Scriptures: So let all the sober people of that countrey about Hartford consi∣der, and not wilfully contemn and despise the day of their visitation, which now is upon them from the Lord, that they may come to the knowledge of his wayes, and let all other people weigh what herein is written, for the very clear day of Gods tender visitati∣on is upon the whole world: Remember you are warned now in your life-time.
A CALL AND A VVARNING, TO ALL Priests, Professors and People, &c. O All ye people, Professors and Priests of the world, and to all others every where, who have an eye to see, and an ear to hear, high and low, rich or poor, of what sort of profession soever, whether Presby∣terians, Independents, Baptists, or by what other by-name known or distinguished, who are seeking the Kingdome of heaven in outward observations, Loe here, and loe there, in this duty, and this daies observation, or in the other perfor∣mances (as you call them:) Be it known unto you all, from the Lord, that you are out of the way it is not to be found there, for the Kingdome of God comes not with outward observations, neither shall they say any longer, loe here, or loe there, for the Kingdome of heaven is within; So said Christ Jesus to the Pharisees who were seeking the Kingdom without in outward observations, so say I to you, their chil∣dren by the spirit of the same Christ Jesus, whom your fa∣thers slew and hung upon a tree; for your new Moons, and Sabbaths, your calling of your Solemne, and your appoint∣ed Fasts and Feasts, my soul loaths, they are even an abomi∣nation unto me saith the Lord, for your hands are full of blood and cruelty, even the blood of the innocent cryeth in
mine ears, whom ye like your fathers have shamefully en∣treated, and crucified, and hung upon a tree, and yet are professing his words, whom they slew, and their words, who witnessed him, and preach'd him, and your selves found in the same practise with them who crucified the just one, and requir'd to let loose the murtherer, yet ready many of you to say, as they of old did, if we had lived in those daies, we would not have done so wickedly: Oh what think ye will be in the end hereof; when the just God shall come to call you to an accompt for all this, do you think getting his words, and their words, to profess and talk of, will save you from the wrath to come, who are despisers and haters of their life, both in your selves and others, where he is made manifest, and are scoffers and scorners at them who do wit∣ness it, (calling them in derision) Quakers, and yet make a profession of Moses writings, and Davids words, and Ha∣bakkuks Prophesie, and Pauls Epistles, who all witnessed Quaking; ye Hypocrites, search the Scriptures and see, whether ye are not in their steps, who despised Moses Law, and made Songs of David, and mock'd, and slew the Pro∣phets, and persecuted Paul, and ston'd Stephen, which bare witness to and for the Lord, and against your Idol Temples, and yet make profession of their words; to the light in all your consciences I speak, which will let you see that you are out of their life, who wrote and spake forth those words; and are ye so foolish to think a profession of those words will save you, who do not know nor witness the same life from which those words were spoken, but are enemies to it, and murtherers of it in your selves, and persecutors of it in others, witness some of my righteous servants, in Hart∣ford Goal, whom ye have cast into prison, some of you, without the breach of any known Law of your own Nati∣on, and contrary to my righteous Law which I have plac'd in all your consciences, unto which you must all be account∣able, in that day wherein God shall coe to judg the secrets of all hearts by my Gospel, which hath been declared even in your streets and Sinagogues, if you had ears to hear: O
foolish and slow of heart, to believe all that the Prophets have written, and all that Christ and the Apostles were wit∣nesses of, ought not Jesus thus to have suffered and to have entered into his glory? is there another way for the salvati∣on of your souls but him, who is the way, the truth, and the life? and can any come to the father but by him, who is the light of the world, and lighteth every one that cometh in∣to the world? Is there another Saviour, save me, saith the Lord? or another Redeemer, save the Holy One of Israel, our King, whom ye professors, priests, & people, with bloo∣dy hands have crucified and slain, even him, whom God hath raised up to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins? Have ye not evilly en∣treated his messengers and servants, whom he hath called and chosen to be witnesses hereof, in these your daies, as your Forefathers of old did, so do ye; search the Scriptures which ye profess, and see if they be not fulfilled by you, and shall be fulfilled upon you, as ever by them of old; they shall hall you out of their Synagogues, and before Rulers and Magistrates, and some of you shall they cast into pri∣son and shall do and speak all manner of evil, falsly and de∣spightfully against you for my name sake, saith Christ; yea, they that killeth you, shall think they do God service; and this will they do unto you for my name sake because they have neither known me nor my father, see if ye be not they; and if this be not so, O ye priests, professors and people, who deny the Revelation of Christ, and say all Revelation is ceas'd and that none must expect Revelation now, are ye not such as the Scriptures (which in words ye profess, but in life and power deny) witnesseth against, to know neither the Father, nor the Son? and no marvel ye are found in such practises, which he whom we have receiv'd, and do bear witness of foretold, and in those daies declar'd of; and so the Scriptures are owned & witnessed unto by us, who are in the life or them, and in the possession and enjoyment of him of whom they declare; as also do bear witnesse against you, who have the words declared, but are found enemies to
the life, and in the same practises with them, who had Mo∣ses and the Prophets, which declar'd and prophesied of him to come; but when he came, and was made manifest, would not own him, nor receive him, but rejected him, and mur∣thered him, who was the life of Moses and the Prophets words; and yet said, that had they been in the daies of their Fathers, they would not have slain the Prophets that pro∣phesied of his coming; and ye now in these daies, be ye witnesses against your selves, even of the same generation, who have not only their words who prophesied of his com∣ing, but say he is come, and have his words, and their words, who wrought and witnessed him come, to profess, and rea∣dy to say, had we been in their daies, we would not have done so wickedly, nor cruelly; and yet ye your selves doing the same thing, even persecuting, and evilly entreating them, who now witness him come, who is the end of the Law and the Prophets, Christ Jesus the righteous, whom ye crucifie; and thinkest thou this, O man, who condemnest another, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgements of God, or despisest thou the riches of his grace, long-suffering and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God should lead thee to repentance: Oh what vvill ye do in the end hereof, oh ye people, professors and priests, who are groap∣ing in the dark even at noon day, vvhen repentance shall be hid from your eyes, vvho vvill not ovvn him, nor receive him, to lead you unto it, vvho is the light of the vvorld, and lighteth every one that cometh into the vvorld, vvhom the vvorld cannot receive, but reject him as ye do, (even as the Master-builders and professors of old did) vvho are calling his light, vvhich lighteth every one that cometh into the vvorld, natural; and say it's not sufficient to lead unto sal∣vation all that are guided by it, and live and vvalk up to it; and herein are you manifest to be blind leaders of the blind, and hovv can you be othervvise, that deny the light vvhich lighteth every one that cometh into the vvorld? Do you think he I alvvayes vvait and call upon you, O ye foolish and slovv of heart to believe, do ye think he'l check and re∣prove
prove you ever for your evil deeds, and that his spirit shall alwayes strive with you? O ye priests, professors and peo∣ple, will ye thus reject and contemn the Lord your Maker, and still go on to slander the footsteps of his Annointed, and think to escape and prosper? notwithstanding all this, are ye not they who say in your hearts, We will none of this man to raign over, but we will walk on after the imaginations of our own hearts, adding drunkennesse unto thirst, and co∣vetousnesse unto pride, and yet professe to know him, and to observe a day to him, and come and pretend to bow and worship before me, saith the Lord, when your hearts are a whoring from me after your pride and vanity, and lusts and covetousnesse, and all manner of iniquities? Will I be en∣quired after by such a people as this? Shall not my soul be a∣venged on such a people as this, who provoke me daily to my face, notwithstanding all my reproofs, but hate my reproofs, and cast my Laws behind their backs and say in their hearts, We will not have this man to rule, even my Son, whom I have sent a light into the world, whom they (as their Fore∣fathers of old) crucifie and slay, and shed the innocent blood in their land, even the streets of their great City, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord is cru∣cified, as well as at Jerusalem; to the light in all your con∣sciences I speak, which will let you see, is it not so? deceive not your selves; Can any do thus and be saved? Can any kick and spurn against him and not be confounded and de∣stroyed? Can any reject him, and he not grind them to powder? The stone cut out of the mountains without hands smites at the feet of your great image, even your mighty i∣mage, whose head is of gold, back and breasts of silver, bellie and thighs of brass, legs of iron, feet part of iron, and part of clay, and it shall tumble and crumble down to the dust, and none shall be able to deliver it out of my hands, saith the Lord; for Babylon the great is come up into remembrance before me, saith the Lord, even all her Inchantments and Sorceries whereby she hath bewitched my people Israel to sin against me, with her lying divinations, and false
doctrines, saying, the Lord hath said it, when of a truth I never spake to them, nor never sent them at all; therefore have they not profited my people at all, but have taken of my wooll, and of my flax, and of my wine and my oyl, and of my kine, and of my sheep, and have spent it on her lusts, and her lovers; but now am I coming to require these things at her hands, and I will strip her naked and bare, even she who hath said in her heart, I sit as a Queen, and shall see no sorrow; sorrow and misery, Widdowhood and losse of chil∣dren shall come upon her in one day, and all her lovers with whom she hath played the harlot shall not save nor deliver her out of my hands, saith the Lord, your righteous Judge, who judgeth not for gifts nor rewards, but will plead the cause of the innocent, and him that hath no helper in the earth, and will recompence double into her bosome, even for all the blood of the innocent that have been shed in the midst of her, even blood double, even till it come up to the horse bridles; and happy shall he be, that taketh Babilons brats, and dash out their brains against the stones, for she is come up into remembrance before me, saith the Lord, e∣ven she who hath made all the kindreds of the earth drunk with the cup of her fornication, and all the Kings and Prin∣ces, Governours and Rulers of the earth, hath committed incest and fornication with her, and the blood of my Saints have been shed by them in the midst of her; therefore shall she receive blood to drink, for she is worthy, even the dregs of the cup of my fury that will I wring out unto her, saith the Lord, shall she drink of, and shall spue, and fal, and never rise more; and they that have committed fornication with her and her lovers, and her Merchants, and such as have had traffique with her by Sea, and all occupiers of ships behold∣ing her shall stand afar off, crying, Alas, alas, for that great City, which was the glory of the whole earth, wherein was so much traffique for gold and silver, and needle works, and diamonds, and pearles, and precious stones, and silks, and velvets, and scarlets, and fine linnen, and all manner of broidered works, and whisks, and vails, and neck-laces, and
powderings, and crispings, and platings, for in one day is her torment come upon her, and the smoak thereof shall as∣cend up for ever and ever: And do ye think the professing of these words will cover ye, O ye priests, professors and people; or that by your meanings, conceivings, or private interpretations ye can put them off from you; or that ye are not meant and concern'd in them, who are found in her pra∣ctises, and doing her service, and become as a pander unto her, to usher in her wickednesse, by denying the light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, which con∣vinceth the world of sin, and sheweth it plainly that these things are not of God, but of the devil, envy, lying, and swearing, and drunkennesse, and whoredome, and pride, and vanity, and prodigality, by which the Merchants of the earth are waxen rich and fat, and are become valiant and strong, to reproach the living God, and slander the footsteps of his Annointed; and are ye not found in such practises, O ye priests, professors, and people, let the light in all your con∣sciences answer? is it not so? What mean ye thus to fight a∣gainst the Lord? Will ye set bryars and thorns in battel a∣gainst me, saith the Lord, shall I not even passe thorough them, and consume ye together? or will ye Potsherds of the earth still strive against your Maker? Shall I not dash ye to pieces like a potters vessel, and rule ye with my iron rod? O ye Kings and Rulers of the earth, who are joyned together against the Lord, and against his Annointed, whom ye evilly entreat, and despitefully use for my Name sake, saith the Lord, saying, Come let us joyn together to root out the name of Israel from under heaven; let us break his bands asunder, and cast his cords from us, for we will not have this man to rule over us; come, let us sell him into Egypt, let us make strong Lawes and binding against him, so we may cast him into prison, and into dungeons, & drive him into dens and caves of the earth, even to root out the name of Israel from under heaven, for Israel shall not go free, saith proud Pharaoh, Gods enemy; but he that sitteth in heaven laugheth your consultations to scorn, and hath you in derision: O ye Kings and Rulers of the earth, serve
the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling; kisse the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the mid way, if his wrath be kindled but a little; blessed are all they that put their trust in him, for this hath the Lord determined, even to exalt and set his King upon his holy hill of Zion, who shall rule the Nations in his anger with a rod of iron, and shall dash them in pieces like a potters vessel, for all those mine enemies, saith he, that will not that I shall rule over them, shall be slain by the edge of the Sword, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and it shall be accomplished up∣on your heads; for the Lord God is not a man that he should lie, or as the Son of man that he should repent, but what he hath decreed shall suddenly come to passe; and who is he that shall dare to withstand him, and say, why dost thou so? wherefore hear, O ye Kings, and be instructed, O ye Rulers of the earth; break off your sins betimes by repentance, and your iniquities, by shewing compassion on the poor, lest I come upon you in my fury as an armed man, and cut you a∣sunder, and sweep you away with the beesome of Consump∣tion, and there be none to deliver you out of my hands, saith the Lord; for this will be the portion of their cup, vvho vvill not be guided and counselled by me in their life-time; but running a-vvhoring from me after other gods, which have eyes and see not, ears and hear not, neither have under∣standing at all, they who make them are like unto them, and so are all those that put their trust in them; therefore con∣sider what you are a doing, you who make unrighteous de∣crees, and establish iniquity by a law to oppress the poor, and the innocent, and to grind the face of the fatherlesse, even the fatherlesse, the widdow, and the stranger, and him that hath no helper in the earth; for I see you, saith the Lord, and behold all your thoughts and purposes, concern∣ing them in secret, and I will declare them openly, and re∣prove them openly, and ye shall be ashamed and consound∣ed for all your wickednesse against me, saith the Lord, and all your private determinations against my holy ones, my holy seed, the lot of mine inheritance, saith the Lord, who hath loved them, and given my self for them, to redeem
them unto my self for ever, and none shall pluck them out of my hand, nor out of my fathers hand, for my father is stronger then all; I and my father am one, wherefore in the dread and power of God I warn you, to take heed what ye do, and what ye plot and contrive against the innocent, for the Lord is their helper, lest ye be found fighters against God, but let Israel go free, that he may do service, and wor∣ship the Lord his God in the wilderness, for to that end hath he caused me to write unto you, O ye Rulers of the earth, lest ye be made as Pharaoh for the hardness of your hearts a∣gainst my chosen, who is the meek of the earth, against whom no weapon formed shall prosper, but shall return e∣ven as a dart to pierce through the liver of him that formed it, for Israel is my battel axe and weapon of war, with which I'le dash the mountains to pieces, and scatter them as dust before the whirl-wind of mine indignation, which shall blow upon the wicked, till they be utterly consumed from off the face of the earth; thus shall it be done unto all that will not that I shall raign, and that my Son shall rule, whom I have sent a light into the world, to lighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, and to guide their feet into the way of peace; wherefore prepare to meet thy God, O Israel, with fasting, and weeping, and mourning, by putting away thine iniquities from before mine eyes, saith the Lord, cease from doing evil, learn to do well, come then, and let us reason together, saith the Lord, though thy sins were as crimson, I would make them as white as wool, and though they were as scarlet, yet would I make them as white as smow; and if thou wouldst return, my mercy would I not utterly take away from thee, nor suffer my truth to fail; but if thou wilt not return, thou must be destroyed, both thou and thy King; wherefore consider your wayes and doings, O ye priests, professors, and people, do ye think a profession of his words, who is the life, will save you from wrath to come, who are enemies to his light and life, and will not have him to rule and raign in you, and over you, who is the way to the Father, and to his knowledge, whom to know is life eternal, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent? And do ye think ever
to come to the knowledge of him, O ye priests, professors, and people, who are talking and professing of serving God in his own way, and that such as will have Christ, must have him in his own way, and on his own terms, and it will not own him the way, even the way of his own appointment, the light; Doth not the Scriptures, ye professors, declare it? or doth it say it self is it? or is there another way then what it declareth of, or another name given whereby the sons of men can be saved? what mean ye that ye thus oppose the Lord and his way? are ye stronger then he? hath he not said he'l no longer be served and worshipped in Temples made with mens hands, and will ye still be serving him con∣trary to his mind hands, and will, and yet profess to serve and wor∣ship him in his own way? hath he not said, that he dwelleth not in temples made with hands, and will ye be still seeking of him there, notwithstanding all this? Hath he not invited and called upon all to come unto him, that they might have life? and will ye be seekign life in the Scriptures for all this? hath he not said the Kingdome of heaven cometh not with outward observances? and will ye remain still seeking of it in those things; and yet be telling the people, and professing that God must be served and worshipped in his own way, and yet seek to keep people in your own wayes? are ye not deceitful, and deceivers of the people who do thus? ye are observing daies and moneths, and times, and years: are ye not still carnal? ye eat and drink, but are ye not still empty and a thirst? ye pray-and fast, but receive not, for ye ask a∣misse, to spend it on your lusts; ye observe daies, and divers watchings, and carnal Ordinances, but are the comers there∣unto made perfect, as pertaining to the conscience? ye cry out, The Temples of the Lord, the Ordinances of the Lord, the Church of Christ, the Ordinances of Christ; but which of you is come to witnesse your bodies to be the Temple of the Ho∣ly Ghost? or that you are made fit Temples for the Spirit of the Lord to dwell in, or him come to wash you and cleanse you in his own blood, and so to present you without spot to od, even his Father: or which of you is come to witnesse
the Church of the First born, which is in God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Pillar and ground of truth; but on the contrarie, ye profess, teach and say, none can, or must, or shall be set free from sin here, and so endeavour to preserve your bodies, temples for the devil, and not Christ, (whilest here) for Christs Temple is holie, and ye say, none must or can be set free from sin, and so seek to keep people unholie, and their bodies Temples of sin; this Doctrine plea∣ses the devil well, and he loves you for it and will let you professe (to serve God in Gods way) and profess Christs Church, say you are Christs Ministers, so he may but keep you to be his Temples, and Church, and Ministers still, and thrust Christ out of rule and dominion; for he that commits sin is of the devil, and his servants ye are, to whom ye yield your members servants to obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto life; O foolish, and exceedinglie blind∣ed and besotted men, that will not see this, and yet profess the Scriptures, and where he is thus come and witnessed, who changeth Ordinances and Laws, and watchings, and obser∣vations of daies, and times, and moneths, and years, and Sabbaths, and dippings, and sprinklings; do ye not all rise up against him with one accord, away with him, he is not worthie to live, to prison with him, we have a Law. Consi∣der seriouslie, is it not so with you as with them of the same generation of old? to the light in all your consciences I speak: Do ye think a profession of these things, and a boast∣ing of these things, will serve your turns any more then it did your Forefathers of old, from whom God was departed and removed, who became persecutors of the life of his Son in his Saints? are ye not found in the steps of those evil hus∣bandmen, who say, behold the heir, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours? and are ye so blind and bewitched by the god of this vvorld, to think, that ye shall escape their punishment? will ye still preach and profess their words, vvho vvitnessed Christ vvithin the end of the Lavv, the car∣nal Ordinances, the observations, the Sabbaths and beggar∣ly rudiments of the world, and cause the Cross of Christ to
cease, through your traditions? vvill ye still be found thus fighters against God in his Saints; vvho novv vvitness forth the same, and cannot submit unto those things vvhich he hath redeemed and purchased them out of, even vvith his ovvn precious blood, and are made to vvitness against them, and your idol Worshipps, and crie, you have a Lavv; will your Lavv think you excuse you in his sight, vvho seeth you, your vvaies, and actions against him and his; nay, nay, de∣ceive not your selves God will not be mocked, for such as you sow, such shall you reap; if ye sow to the flesh, think ye, shall ye not of the flesh reap corruption; but if ye sow to the spirit, of the spirit reap life everlasting. Seriouslie sit down, and weigh, and consider, is pride, vanitie, lust of the flesh, idleness fulness of bread, lying, swearing drunken∣ness, covetousness, deceipt, back-biting, emulation, strife, quarrelling, fighting, reviling, slandering, evil speaking, whispering, halling out of Synagogues, or Steeple-houses, mocking, stocking, imprisoning, cruel and evil entreating, fruits of the Spirit? or did ever such as witnessed the Spirit of God bring forth such fruits? nay, nay, who witnessed the Spirit of Christ, never were found in such practises; search and see in the Scriptures, in which ye think to find e∣ternal life, where ever any of the Saints of Christ (who were possessors, and not professors) brought forth such fruits; and can ye think, or are ye so far blinded by the devil, to believe ye shall be saved by professing their words, and ene∣mies to their life, and led and guided by another spirit, then that which they witnessed to be guided and led by; or dare ye say, that the Spirit of Christ is changed now from what it was then, as some of ye do, if not all, that Revelation is ceas'd now, and that none must expect Revelation now, and so are deniers your selves of the Scriptures ye profess: Nay, nay, it will not serve your turns, ye cannot deceive the Lord, though ye have long deceived men; with the light ye are seen and comprehended, and the Tree judged of by his fruits: Is it the Spirit of the Lord that leads you into those things? what means your pride and vanitie in appar∣rel,
your excess in eating and drinking, & rioting, and sport∣ing in the day time, your chambering and wantonness, your idle talk and foolish jesting, and laughter, which is madness and follie, your lying one to another, and deceipt, and o∣ver-reaching one another in your dealings and commerce, and Merchandize one with another, and fighting, and quar∣relling, and going to Law, and swearing: O ye priests, pro∣fessors, and people, are these the fruits of Christs Spirit? or did ever any who were so guided, act thus; and except ye come to be guided by his Spirit, O ye professors of the Scri∣ptures, ye are none of his, profess what ye will; for whoso∣ever hath not the Spirit of Christ, the same is none of his; and know ye not that Christ Jesus is in you, except ye be re∣probates; and they that are Christs, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts: Are ye so sottishlie blinded by the God of this world, to believe and imagine that ye are Christs, who are in the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, fashioning your selves according to the vanities of your minds, after the conversation of this world, after the deceiveable lusts, fulfilling the desires of the wil & of the mind, being children of wrath, and yet imagine your selves children of God: Did ever any of the Saints do thus, or take the children of Gods words to profess and cover over themselves withal, whose adorning was not after the fashions of the world, in the outward adorning as of plait∣ing and powdering the hair, of gold and silver, and costly Array, but their adorning was in the hidden man of the heart, even a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price; and are you so blind to think these words will cover you, who are found contrarie to their life? or do you think that the holie womens of old, their mode∣rate decent attire mixt with gravitie, sobrietie, and chasti∣tie, and a quiet spirit, such as accompanies holiness of life and conversation, will be a fit cover to cover over your ex∣cess, and pride, and knots and spots, and toyes, and bau∣bles, and fashions, and vails and neck-laces, and gorgets, and whisks, and cuffs up to the elbowes, and crispings, and pow∣derings,
and rings, and bracelets, and points, and lace, and ribbons, and tops about mens legs, to make them straddle, with other evil behaviour of bowing and cringing the bo∣dy, and idle and vain-lying complements, as you call them, of your servant Sir, or Madam, or forsooth, when oft there is evil in their hearts one against another, and oft laughing, and scoffing and cursing, and wishing evil one of another behind their backs; or it may be, as soon as they are past each other, plot one another mischief, or raising evil reports one of another: Is this according to godliness? laugh∣ter, and lightness, and idle jesting and sporting, and mince∣ing and tinkling with your feet, and dancing and curching, and bowing the bodie each to other, like Stage-players, with lightness of behaviour, and unchast looks and actions? Is this according to holiness of life and conversation; which the holie women of old lived in? to the light in all your consci∣ences I speak, which will let you see, that many of you are farther off from God, then you were many years ago, when it may be ye made not so large a show of profession as now, and are ye not then hypocrites, hypt above that which then convinced you of the evil of it, and of them that walked in such things, and so become worse, instead of witnessing a growth in grace, which the Saints of old did? and are not these things to be found amongst you, O ye priests, profes∣sors, and people? and do ye think still to cover over your selves with the good words, who are out of the good life and manners; for if any come to you who are guided by the good manners, Christs manners, which is without respect to persons, and speak thee or thou, the Scripture language, to any single person whatsoever; are ye not ready to deride them, or thrust them out of doors, if not worse, or say its filthy language, and methinks ye may have better manners; or if a man come to speak to some of you with his hat on, and not doff it, because he dare not act contrarie to Christs manners, nor follow the vain customes of the world? are ye not ready to deride him, or strike him, or cast him into prison and say he may lie there till he learn better man∣ners;
and so ye manifest your selves to be enemies to Christ and his manners, and teachings, and faith, which is without respect to persons, and account it too low and mean a breed∣ing and behaviour for your great worships, who are big swoln with pride and envy, even ready to burst again, and in your faces plainlie shew whose image you bear, and whose mark; Will the Scriptures ye profess, think you, cover you, who are found in these or such like practises, vain men and women to be thus miserably deceived and deluded by the de∣vil, to say pride is not in the apparrel, or in outward things, pride is in the heart; and so it's plainly seen, the day hath declar'd it, even out of thy own mouth found a witness a∣gainst thy self, for if it were not, then what means all this, and much more vanity in thy life, which might be declar'd and spoken of, enough almost to defile a chaft mind to write it, and yet if any be sent to declare the truth to you as it is in Jesus, against your excess and vanitie; are ye not ready to cry out one to another, take heed of being bewitched, or of being deceived; can any be greater deceived and be∣witched by the devil, the old Serpent, then you are already who are found in such practises. And thus the devil would fain keep you still his subjects unto sin, lust, and vanities of the world, by bidding of you take heed of being deceived and deluded, lest he should lose a member and subject of his Kingdome, but your follie and his subtilty must be made manifest, it can no longer be hid, for he is come and witnes∣sed, who makes all things manifest, even your hidden works of darkness, which are acted by you in secret, are now brought to light, even your chambering and wantonness; where no eye of man sees, there are your skirts uncovered, O Sodom and AEgypt, where our Lord lies crucified, and that which is done in secret, is now come to be preach'd up∣on the house-tops; therefore in vain do ye hide your selves, under a profession of the Saints words; fair fig-leaves, but underneath a Serpent; your coverings rent, it will no lon∣ger hide you, the bed is too short to stretch your selves up∣on, and your covering is grown too narrow to any longer
hide you, your shame and nakedness appears: And how think ye, can ye ever come to know the covering of his Spi∣rit, who will not own, nor believe in that which convinceth of sin, but say it's not sufficient to lead, and guide unto sal∣vation? Do ye think a profession of their words will do it, who did own it, and were led and guided by it, who witnessed salvation by it, will this save you, who are not led and gui∣ded by it, but make slight of it, even of that which was their leader and conducter into the New Jerusalem, the City of the living God, which is come down from God out of Heaven, and yet professes their words, who did believe and were wit∣nesses of it? O ye foolish and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have written, and that the Apostles witnessed unto, and yet think to profess their words will save you, who are not in their life? Think you my servants of old were sa∣ved after this manner, by professing my Saints and Servants words, who went before them into the land of Rest? Think ye Moses, who was a faithful servant in my house, was saved without Abrahams Faith, which justified him by Works, who was many hundred years before him? Whom think ye was the Patriark Abraham saved by, who was many hundreds of years before Moses Writings, who saw my day, saith Christ, and rejoyced, was he think ye sav'd by ritings? Who shew'd Adam his transgression, when he would have hid him∣self, and run away to hide his nakedness, knowing that he had sinned; was it not he of whom Moses declares, saying, A Prophet shall the Lord your God, raise up unto you, of your Brethern like unto me, him shall ye hear, who though he were dead, yet speaketh? By whom think ye were the Pa∣triarks told there was Corn in AEgypt (who had sold Joseph thither) to preserve them alive in Famine? Was it not by him of whom Moses declares? By whom did Joseph make mention of the Removing of his bones, when as he was yet in AEgypt, long before their departure? By whom did Jacob bless, both the sons of Joseph, leaning on the top of his staff? All these obtained a good report through Faith; having not received the Promise; who being dead, yet speaketh? Whom
think ye that my servant Joshua (called Jesus) was sav'd by, was it by Moses Writings? Or by Faith in him whom Mo∣ses declared should come, by which he entred the good land? What should I speak of Jeptha, and David, and Sampson, and Gideon, and many others, who through Faith remov'd Moun∣tains, stopt the mouths of Lions, quench'd the violence of fire, fought many battels, over-come great Nations, slew mighty Giants, Ogg King of Bashan, and Doeg King of the Amorites, and Tidal King of Nations, and Tartan, Pull, and Lud, who bent the bow? By whom think ye was Abraham strengthned when he rescued the spoils of the men of the East out of the hands of their enemies, when Melchisedeck met him, who was without beginning of dayes, or end of life, whose Father and Mother none knew, neither had they a name in the earth, unto whom the Patriarch Abraham gave the Tenth of the spoyls that he had taken; who blessed him who had the Promise, and without doubt the lesser was bles∣sed of the greater, who was the figure of him who was to come? And do ye think, O ye Priests, People, Professors, and Inhabitants of the World, that a making of Profession of these words will save you, who know not him who was to come, nor will not believe in the light from whence the words were declared forth, who was the Oath and Promise unto Abraham, when as he was yet uncircumcised, who is the Father of all who believe in the Oath, who said, Of the fruit of thy Loyns shall he come, in whom all the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed, even by turning away the Curse for sin, and saving his People from their sin, in whose Seed all the Nations of the Earth shall be blessed, and again, in bles∣sing, I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thee, and thou shalt be the Father of many Nations, and as the stars of heaven, so shall thy Seed be; you who are professing these words, do ye know the Seed here spoken of, which shall be as the stars of heaven for multitude, unto which the Pro∣mise is, not unto seeds as many, but unto thy seed, which is Christ, in the Male, and in the Female, of which Moses in the Spirit testifieth? Or how can ye ever come to this knowledg
vvho deny the light vvhich lighteth every man that cometh into the World; and so the seed of God ye are strangers and enemies to, vvho deny the light to be sufficient to lead unto salvation, all vvho believe in it, and vvalk up to it, and yet professe their vvords vvho vvitnessed salvation by it, and take their sayings; the holy men of Gods Words vvhich they spake & vvrote from the Word that dvvelt in them, and vvas vvith them, and call them the Word of the Lord (say∣ing, Hearken to the Word of the Lord) vvho never knevv his Word, nor had seen his shape at any time, but are enemies to his Word, and to those vvho professes his Word abiding in them, and they in it; and so are such found to be vvho have not his Word abiding in you, who call that his Word which were Writings from his Word, which they who knew the Word, no where did: And so his Word you are ignorant of, and his life haters of, and despisers of, who have his words to make a profession of; I wonder how ye should be still thus ignorantly blindfold as not to see this, when as his so plain∣ly declared of to you: Do ye not wilfully stop your ears and blind your eies, O ye priests, professors and people, that ye will not see this? or do ye think or imagine to be saved by a Profession without the life and power? or are ye resolv'd on't that ye will not be saved, and say still, He's not suffici∣ent? Will ye professe to be lovers of God, and Christ, and the spirit, and yet say, He's not sufficient, and be haters of them who are so, who are followers of that which is good, and do witnesse he's sufficient? Is this to love God, and Christ, and the Spirit, as ye profess who are haters of the Brethren? Can such a profession save you? Doth the Scri∣ptures ye profess witness forth such a salvation as this? Or do ye think there's another salvation then what they wit∣ness to, which is the light of the World, Christ Jesus? And can you think to be saved by him, who will not be led and guided by him? Or doth he lead any into sin? You who profess him yet say, ye shall never be set free from sin here: Are ye guided by Christ? To the light in all your consciences I speak, which will let you see who's your Leader and Guide
into sin and imperfection, even the man of sin, and son of perdition, whom Christ is come and made manifest to de∣stroy: And do ye profess he's come, and it say sin shall not be destroyed, nor none can or shall be set free from it here? What a profession is this! and what a belief is this! it even pitties me to see that men should be thus miserably deceived by Christs Enemy, and the Enemy of your souls, to be thus deluded; and yet if any one be moved of the Lord to declare it unto you in love to your souls, cry out one to another, Take heed of delusion, it's a spirit of delusion which is gone forth into the world, which the Apostles said should come in the last days, which privily should bring in damnable errors, even denying the Lord that bought them: Are ye not there who are led into sin, and say you shall not be free? And is it not the Devil that tells you this, who is afraid his Kingdom should be de∣stroyed which is sin in you? What think you? is it not so? and are we not accounted your Enemies for thus telling you the truth, O ye priests, professors, and people, and O all ye Inhabitants of the Earth? And do ye not now plainly per∣ceive how he have been thus long deluded by the Devil and his Instruments, to denie the light which lets you see this? And will you still love to have it so? Oh! What will ye do in the end hereof? think ye to be saved in your sin, seeing ye will not come to him, nor own him, to be saved by him who sets free? Do ye not love your sin better then him, and it profess to love him, when in words ye denie him, and so are unto everie good Work reprobate? for such as are come to the good Work, are come to him who was before the evil Work was; but who are in the evil Work, are not, and so are not in him who works the good Work, but in him who works the evil, and yet think to be saved by professing the words of him who worketh all our Works in us, and for us; for this is he of whom vve are Witnesses, even the Righte∣ousness of God, by which we are saved and set free from our sin; and this not of our selves, it is the gift of God, not of Works, lest any should boast, for we are the Workmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus unto good Works, that we
should grow and increase in them. And is this your Saviour who profess and say ye shall never be set free from sin here? Or are ye not setting up a Saviour of your own making, af∣ter your own hearts lust, (which ye love and worship more then Christ) which is not of Gods appointment, and it talk and profess of worshipping the Lord after his own appoint∣ment, whilst ye are serving of him (by your own confession) who is not sufficient to set free from sin here? And so the true Christ and God ye are ignorant on, who saves his peo∣ple from sin, whom we witness: And are ye not fighting a∣mong your selves in words (almost blood to Knees) for your God, (& the manner of his Service and VVorship, and yet all join'd together against the true Worshippers) who hath not sav'd you from sin, nor never will, and so not from Wrath to come? Who would take part with such a God, and fight for such a God, or serve such a God, and Christ, and Gospel, if they were not ignorantlie zealous, and blind? And how can ye be otherwise who denie the true light which lighteth every one that cometh into the world, to be sufficient? Is it not just with God ye should be blind still who will not own his light wherewith he hath enlightned you, but are Enemies to it and haters of it, (calling it natural) and persecutors, and opposers of them that witness it, and believe in it, and are guided by it, and account them not worthie to live in the World; who are not of the World, but such as he hath cho∣sen out of the World? And yet, will ye not yet see whose steps ye are in? Search the Scriptures, and see, are they not plain enough? (to the light in you I speak) Or will ye still be hireing of a man to give you the meaning? Did they who spake and writ that which ye profess, speak one thing, and mean another? Will ye be such blasphemers against the Spirit of Truth, the Holie Ghost? Know ye not their porti∣on? search the Scriptures, and see. Or will ye still follow their meanings rather then it, vvho are saying, The Scrip∣tures vvere spoken in other Tongues, and none can under∣stand them but such as know and understand the Tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, vvhich the builders of Babel call
the original? Are not such blasphemers vvho call Let∣ters and Syllables the Original, and say none can understand the Scripture but such? Are they not ignorant of the Ori∣ginal vvho say so? And vvill ye still believe and follovv their meanings and opinions vvho are out of the Original, and e∣nemies to the Original? Had not the Jews and Pilate their Original? And vvere they not persecutors and murtherers of Christ Jesus our Original? Search the Scriptures, and see. And are there none such to be found amongst you, O ye Priests, Professors and People? to the Light in all your con∣sciences I speak: If there be, Will ye still be follovvers of them? Is this to be follovvers of God as dear children, or not follovvers of them that do evil, from vvhom the Apostle bids turn avvay? And can ye be such lovers of the Apostles Words, (as ye profess) vvho vvill not take his advice (vvho vvalked in the Grace of God vvhich he had received, and it vvas sufficient for him, as the other Saints did, and vvitnessed they needed not another Teacher to teach them, but as the same Anointing vvhich vvas in them, taught them, vvhich vvas truth, and in it vvas no lye?) Or are ye not rather hy∣pocrites, and haters of the Apostles, and their vvords too, though in shevv ye profess them, calling them Blessed S. Paul; and Holy St. Peter, and the Evangelical Prophet, and the Holy and Blessed Evangelists and Blessed St. Stephen that holy Martyr, vvhose vvords ye profess, but can't abide his Doctrine, because he vvitnessed against Temples made vvith hands, as by your vvorks ye plainly shevv, for the Tree is to be knovvn and judged of by its fruits, and that's according to vvhat ye professe? Search and see, is it not so? VVill their VVords, think ye, bear ye out any longer to profess, vvho hate their VVorks, and scoff at their VVorker, saying, Where was the Light, I pray, when Paul persecuted the Church of God? VVhy, even vvhere yours is, hid under a Bed, or under a Bushel, or under an ignorant blind zeal, being brought up at the feet of some great Ga∣maliel, or Doctor, or Expounder (or Meaning, or Concei∣ving-giver) of the Scriptures, as Paul then vvas, vvho are
found in his steps, and yet querying; Where was the light? I pray ye, blind Zealots, Think ye it's onely to be found or had from Oxford and Cambridge? and from St. Johns Col∣ledge, and not in St. John? Or was he learn'd it at any such place, and not by the revelation of Jesus Christ? search the Scriptures and see. And what was the end (I pray) of your Ministers being it sent to your Universities, and the design of their Parents in it? Was it the same that Christ taught and instructed, and designed, and set apart this for? Or was it not that they might get a livelyhood, and good mainte∣nance and preferment (as you call it) in the World? Was this Christ and his Ministers end? And after they have been trained up, or educated (as you call it) for some years at the Craft, and become proficients in it, are they not from thence sent forth, having commenc't Mr. of the Science, and able to handle their Weapons well in the defence of their Mother, Mystery Babylon; and afterwards being tryed by some able, aged, and more experienced Arts-man, who had long worn his Philactery (and found expert) is ordained, and sent forth to some certain place, or Parish, with an Order from man, to enter and creep into a Stone-House there to lead silly Wo∣men captive, laden with their sins, and led about with divers lusts, ever learning under them, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; and how should they, when (with a strong Law that none must come there to declare it under penalty of a House of Correction, or a Parison as a disturber) it's not their Teachers guide nor end, but two, three, or four, or five hundred pounds a year, which was in their eye? And was it so in the Ministers of Christ? search the Scriptures, and see; Was it so? Or doth their Rule (as they call it) teach them to sprinkle Water on a childs face, & call it baptism, or an Ordinance of Christ; or to call Bread & Wine a Sacrament, do not such make void the Ordinance of Christ through their traditions? What pattern have they from Christ, or any of his Ministers, for these things, or for their Pulpit, as 'tis called, their long Robes, their walking be∣fore the dead, their words over the dead, their Knells, their
Bells, their money for Buryings and Christenings; their sel∣ling Funeral Sermons; their Chancel-money, their Pulpit∣money, with many other knacks and toyes, and pedlary Wares which they take money for, and call their dues, be∣sides sweet-Meats and Wines for their Bellies; are these Or∣dinances of Christ too? No, But these are (say they) for de∣cency and uniformity: Did not your fore-fathers say so, who sought under those Names to usher in popery and idolatry? And who gave ye orders for these and such like practises? Received ye them from Christ, or from your Rule? search and see: Or not from your fore-fathers the Bishops, who taught you to pray and preach by the hour, and to call upon those for money, who will buy none of your Merchandize? Are not these covetous practises? And must you not have your Clark, and Sexstone, and Dog-Whipper too, to attend for decencie and uniformitie? Who taught you it? VVere there ever such helpers in the Ministrie of the Gospel? Yet these must have their pay too, from such as require none of their labour, for uniformitie sake: Doth your Rule you pre∣tend to, teach you such practises; search and see; or doth it not rather condemn your burthensomness: Do you think calling your great Stone-houses by the Saints Names, is any honor to them; or that ye shall have their benediction for it, who are Enemies to their Doctrine, practise, manner of life and conversation, who were called and chosen to the VVork of their Ministrie, not by the will of man, nor sent forth in∣to the VVorld in mans will and time, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ, contrarie to mans VVill, whose revelation ye denie, and cannot own nor receive, but say that's ceas'd, and so are deniers of Scriptures, and yet would be accounted Christs Ministers, Gospel-Ministers, Gospel-professors; VVhat Gospel is't you Minister and professe who denie Re∣velation, and the Letter also which witnesseth to it; and pro∣fesses that, and preach that which the Scriptures no where speaks, namely, That Revelation is ceas'd; Who revealed that to you, you that denie Christs revelation; Must it not needs be his enemie Antichrist: & vvhose Ministers then are ye who say
that none must expect or wait for revelation now, and that such who do, are a sort of giddie-brain'd fellows and Apo∣states, and such as these upstart Quakers, who professe this new-found light, who are contrarie to all mens opinions and judgements of the Scriptures but their own; and was not truth ever so, ye blind, leaders of the blind: Is truth to be accounted of according to mens judgements or opinions of it, or as it is in it self infallible, which word I know you can∣not indure to hear, who are in that which is fallible; and so measuring truth by a lie, and calling Jesus Beelzebub, and God the Devil, and Christ a Seducer, and his Ministers De∣luders and Deceivers, and giddie-brain'd fellows, and up∣starts, & bringers in of damnable errors, & such like, rak't up out of the pit of your fathers habitations, the Prince of dark∣nesse, who is, & ever was a hater of the light in his children in all ages; search the Scripture else, and see; & do ye not see your selves in their steps yet, let the light in you be judge; and will the words think ye cover you; nay, nay, the words are the words of truth, and shall joine with the light, a wit∣nesse against you, even to your eternal condemnation, who are found in life, conversation, doctrine, and practise, con∣trary to them, and this shall you witnesse eternallie, who disowns the light, to be guided by it, which leads into the life of the Scriptures from which they were spoken forth, which was before the Scriptures were spoken, even before Babel and her Builders, into the one Language and this according to my measure am I a VVitnesse of, as ever he was (who am hated, persecuted, and despitefullie used by your gene∣ration) who came to fulfil the Scriptures, for he came not to destroy them, but to fulfil them; and what do ye witnesse of them fulfilled in you, who professe and say he is come, yet are deniers of his light; which waie is he come unto you, seeing you denie that he enlighteneth every one that cometh into the VVorld; and he saith he doth enlighten every one, and ye say he doth not; VVho taught ye to say so; doth he, or the god of the World; and what is it lets you see this and your other confusion, who say ye are enlightned, but not
all; and that there's a common and a special light, a natural and a spiritual light in man; distinguish them asunder, that we may know them one from another, seeing the Scriptures ye professe speaks but of one true light, which lighteth every one that cometh into the World, which is uncreated; if by your natural light you mean the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and o∣ther borrowed Lights, and created, we agree in that; but are they in man; but if there be two Lights in man, separate them one from another, that we may know them, or else we may freely conclude, (according to the Scripture) That the light which is in you is darkness: and how great is that darkness which hath overspread the whole World since the Apostles dayes, which is got so high; even into the Seat of God, exal∣ting himself above God, and boasts himself as if he were God, by making two Lights in man when God made but one, and the Scriptures witnesse to but one true light, and yet he'le have two, but knows not how to separate them one from another; but he who dwells in the light doth, and knows his to be darknesse, and to ascend out of the pit of darknesse and confusion, unto which he must be sent again, even by him who is the Father of Light, even of our Lord Jesus Christ, God blessed for ever; the God of truth, in whom there is no lye, but bears witnesse against the Lye, and the Frogs, and the Locusts, and the Caterpillars, which are ascended out of the bottomlesse pit, and have overspread the Nations of the whole earth, even all Egypt, but they must be all whipt away with the Rod of Moses, and sent in∣to the pit out of which they ascended, never to infect the Nations any longer; for he is come, and coming, whose Fan is in his hand, who will throughlie purge his Flour, and ga∣ther his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff will he con∣sume and burn up with fire unquenchable; for his fire is kind∣led in the earth, which shall consume, and none shall be able to hinder it, till he hath consumed the wicked from off the face of the whole Earth; King and Peasant, who will not that he should reign, Tophet is prepared for them of old, and the glory of all earthly Diadems shall enter into it; for
thus hath the Lord decreed, and who shall be able to hinder him, or say, Why dost thou so; Wherefore, O all ye Kin∣dreds of the Earth, high and low, rich or poor, Kings, No∣bles, Priests, Professors and Peasants, tremble at the Word of the Lord, for it's gone forth, and shall not return empty, but shall accomplish the end unto which he hath sent it; a fire is gone before him, and it shal be very tempestuous round about him, which shall consume all his Enemies, till they have left unto them neither root nor branch in the earth, & til the wicked be no more, nor the place therof know them no more. O ye Priests, Professors of the Scriptures, and People, are you not glorying and boasting after the flesh in Names (and things without) in saying ye are Christians, and to you is committed the Scriptures, and the Ordinances, the Baptism, (dipping and sprinkling) and Sacraments, which the Scrip∣tures no where calls so; and yet are naming your dayes and Months after the customs of the Heathens that knows not me, saith the Lord. Search the Scriptures and see; Did ever any true Christians, my Saints and Servants, so do; Did Paul, or Peter, or James, or John, or Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, (whose Words ye professe) do so; VVhat, do ye ex∣cel the Pope of Rome in these things; Doth not he (think ye) glory in the same, and in many more Names, and Saints daies, and carnal things, then ye profess; And were not the Iews (your forefathers) glorying in such like things, Are not we Abrahams Seed; And to us is committed the Oracles of God; and yet were Enemies to me, and persecutors and despisers of my life in my Saints for all this; And do not ye excel and outstrip them in this also: Did they make Laws that I should not speak publikelie amongst them; Or did they not fasten their eyes on the Saints, and say, Brethren, if any one have a Word of Exhortation for the people, let them speak on: Do ye do so; O ye Professors of these words; Or do ye not exceed many of them in crueltie in this particular; For if I send a∣ny unto you in my Name, do ye not laie violent hands on them, and thrust them forth, and hale them before Magi∣strates, and to Stocks, and to Prison with them, we have a
Law; though ye have and professe my Words, which say, He that receiveth you, and heareth your words, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me; And can ye think ever to receive me or my Father, who wil not hear their testi∣monie who come in my Name; but if any come to you (or are sent to you by others) in his own Name, him ye are readie to hear and receive, though he tell you Revelation is ceas'd, and so neither knows me, nor my Father which sent me, as my Words in the Scripture testifie, O ye professors and peo∣ple. And do ye not crie out, An Orthodox man, a learned man, a great Schollar, a man of excellent parts and gifts, preaches sound Doctrine, a gallant Gentleman, Mr. such a one, a man of great gifts, certainly he prayes and preaches by the spirit, yet says re∣velation is ceast; What spirit is it (think ye) he preaches and prays by, who knows not the Son, For none knows the Father save the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him; Do ye think its the spirit of my Father that prayes and preacheth in him that knows not the Son nor the Father, but sayes Revelation is ceast; it's ceast to him indeed, because he's a hater of the light, and loves the darknesse rather then the light, because his deeds are evil: And do ye think his works are not in the darknesse, whom it's even a torment to, to hear of the light, and he had rather see, or speak with the Devil, then to see, or speak with one who owns the light, and walks in the light, and so hath fellowship with God; but whom think ye his fellowship's with who loves not the light, but is a ha∣ter of the light; Must not his fellowship needs be with the devil, who is the Prince and Ruler of the Darknesse of this World, even the spiritual VVickednesse got into high places, sitting as God in the Temple of God, exalting himself even above all that is called God, and would be worshipped as God; And think ye this spirit is no where to be found but at Rome, O ye Priests, Professors and People; Is it not to be found amongst your selves; To the Light in all your consci∣ences I speak: VVhat means the Fines and close imprison∣ments of such who dare not swear, and so break my com∣mands for conscience sake, and who dare not bow to, nor
worship man for conscience sake? Are these things onely to be found at Rome, and Italy, and Spain, and France; who are called Christians as well as ye, (I, and boast in it too) and not in England also, where liberty of conscience is profest, even amongst you? O ye great and tall Professors of the Scri∣tures! Do you think the Scriptures will cover you any more then they? or that your Faith, and Gospel, and Christ is bet∣ter then theirs, who are respecting one anothers persons? Will that Faith save ye any more then theirs? Search the Scriptures, and see. Doth the change of the Air, or of the Climate, or of the Names, or of the Languages, or of the places, or of the profession of God, and Christ, & the Scrip∣tures, after another form or likenesse then theirs, (for they have the Names, Christian, and God, and Christ, and the Scriptures, as well as ye, and a form of godlinesse in some things as near the Letter as ye) change the nature, or be∣get a saving-faith which is that which purifies the heart, and sets free from sin? Or are ye not in your sin as well as they, and say ye shall not be free here? Onely here∣in they out-strip ye in profession, for they professe a Purga∣torie after this life, through which they must passe, and be cleansed and purified; for they know that no unclean thing must enter into Heaven, and ye think to enter in with your sins; for here ye say you shall never be set free, and so are de∣niers of the Scriptures in that particular, more then they; for you will not come to me (saith Christ the light) that you may have life: Do ye think that the profession of the Scri∣ptures will save you any more then them? Or is the Scrip∣tures me? Were the Scriptures crucified at Jerusalem, or slain since the foundation of the VVorld? Or do ye think that Letters and Syllables joined together in words, as God, and Jesus, will save from sin? Or is that the blood which was shed without the City, which only cleanseth from sin, and purgeth from all unrighteousnesse? Or is that to be found in things without? VVill the blood of Bulls, or Goats, or the ashes of a Heifer, think ye, cleanse from sin? If they would, what needed he have come and been offered up, and
shed his blood at Jerusalem, who came to fulfil the Law, and the Prophets, and the Passeover, and the Circumcision, and the divers washings, and carnal Ordinances, which could not make the comers thereto perfect, as pertaining to the conscience? And do ye think that Bread, and VVine, and VVater, which are carnal things, which you call Sacraments, (who taught you that VVord? had you it by Revelation? for the Scripture no where hath it) will do it now? why then the Pope of Rome, and they of Italy, Spain, and France, have more of them then ye, yet they you say are Antichrist, and none of the Saints, and Church, and people of God, and we say so too. Or is the manner or form of eating, and drink∣ing, or dipping, or sprinkling, that alters the nature, and makes it more saving to one, then to another? for 'tis only in that ye differ; for they have the same, and more then ye, & circumstances by your own Doctrine, alters not, where the ground and foundation is one; for circumstances doth not save according to your own Opinions, nor change the ground; VVhy then do you exclude them from being a Church of Christ more then your selves; who professe more of the carnal Ordinances then ye, and professe the same Scriptures, the same Faith, the same God, the same Christ, and the same Sacraments? and where's the difference but in the circumstances? And it you say they are not a Church of Christ, and professe that you your selves are; and it say circumstances doth not save, if the ground and foundation be one; VVhat confusion is here! Are you not all in Babylon? Are not Mother and Daughter both Harlots? Is your Bread, and VVine, and VVine, and VVater, better, and holier the theirs? Are they not all carnal? Or is yours more pure and more saving? Yet neither of them make the Comers thereunto perfect, by your own confession; is not their Saviour then as good as yours, and their Church as yours, both imperfect? And is the Church of Christ so? Search the Scriptures and see. Doth they say it is? Or doth it not say that he washeth and clenseth it in his own blood, and presents it to God his Father without spot or wrinkle,
or anie such thing; And do not the Apostles write to the Church which is in God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and dare ye say that's imperfect, as by your own confession yours is, and it would be accounted a Church of Christ, and your Teachers, Ministers of Christ; Is Christ imperfect; Are ye not ministring the carnal; Is Christ carnal; Are ye not ministring the Letter: Is the Letter the Spirit; Are ye not ministring the Bread and VVine; Is this Christ; But it may be you'l say, You receive it by faith, but is it faith in Christ; search the Scriptures, and trie Hath this faith puri∣fied your hearts; If not; it's not Christs. Hath it given you victorie over the world; Hath it subdued and crucified the world unto you, and you unto it; Hath it sav'd & clensed you from sin, as by your own confession it hath not, nor you say, you believe never will here; and so is not the faith in Christ which the Saints witnessed; and if not in Christ, not true, nor saving, nor wel-grounded faith, which you oft talk of, but know it not; for the daie is come, and approaching, that your Foundations shall be shaken; the Light comprehends you, your Faith and Foundation, which is tottering and sandie. Therefore look about you, (ye that professe belie∣vers) and beware, for your image of Faith will not save ye anie more then the Popes Images. VVhat's that ye worship and pretend to serve; Do ye know; Is the Scriptures, or mens meanings of them, He; Is Bread and VVine He; Is the Ordinances He; 'Tis like you'l say, No, but they lead to him: VVhich of you have they lead to him; Are ye found out; Is your Ordinances Christ; Doth anie lead to God but Christ; Knows anie the Father save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him; Are ye not making a Christ of your Ordinance, and yet condemn the Pope and his Church to the devil sor believing the bread & vvine is transubstantiated in∣to the Bodie & Blood of Christ, & that when they eat it, they eat his flesh, & drink his blood: What difference betwixt their eating their God, and yours leading to God, and yet saying it's Bread and Wine still, which is carnal; Doth that which is carnal lead to God, whom to know and be led unto, is life
eternal; And hath your dead Christ brought you thither, yea or nay; The Light sees your Christ, and in it are you comprehended, and your Christ, and with it denied, and your Faith, which doth not purifie; for whilst I was under the leading and conduct of it, I came not to the knowledge of God by it, and so not to eternal life, which is witnessed through faith in him, and in his blood, which purifies my heart, and gives me dominion over the world, and that Christ I know, own and witnesse which saves from sin all that come unto him; but your Christ is denied, which you say you be∣lieve will not set you free from sin here, and so is not the Christ of God; which is the true Light which lighteth every one that cometh into the world, who is manifest to take away sin, and to destroy the works of the Devil, and in him is no sin: And this Christ I own, and bear witnesse of, who is the true Light, the Ordinance of the Father, whom ye hate and destroy, and make void through your traditions; and denie your Mock-Christ, which you say will not save you from sin here, but leaves you in the Devils work, which is sin, (by your own confession) and so your Christ is but transform'd in you like unto an Angel of Light, O ye Professors and People, and your Ministers like unto Ministers of Righteousnesse; and so being not the same Christ, but like him, cannot save ye from sin, and so not from condemnation, but keepes you in it whilest ye are here, and perswades you that ye cannot be set free; and this Christ ye believe in: And heres the mysterie of iniquitie hid, and discovered (even the spiritual wicked∣nesse got into high places) unto all who have an eye to see, and an ear to hear, and an heart to understand, and will not wilfullie blind themselves by hating knowledge and instructi∣on: And this mysterie of iniquitie works not onelie at Rome, and Italy, and Spain, and France, but in England also, and in every particular Member of that Church, which is not in God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the pillar and ground of Truth, whom to know is life eternal, which none comes to know, but such who comes down to know and own the light within them, which is pure, of God, which convin∣ceth
of sin and iniquitie, and shews evil deeds; that's the Light which lets ye see when ye tell a lie, when ye swear, or be drunk, or commit anie other sin, that ye are serving the devil, and not God; when ye are fulfilling the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eie, and the pride of life, that this is not of the Father, but of the World; and the World passeth a∣waie, and the lusts thereof, but he that doth the Will of God, the same abideth for ever; and this being obeyed, (which convinceth) and sin denied, it leads unto Christ from whence the light comes, who leads to the Father of Light, with whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of changing, who of his own good will hath he begotten us by the Word of his Povver, unto a livelie hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, that we should be as the first fruits un∣to him, having slain the enmitie on the Cross, and broken down the Partition-wall, and hath brought in everlasting Righteousness, even by washing and purging of us in his own blood; and his flesh we know, which is meat indeed; and his blood, which is drink indeed; and his covering we know. But the wo from him is unto all such as are found covered, and covering themselves with a covering, and not of the spi∣rit of the Lord; for the Lord our God is come, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with the voice of the Arch Angel, and the shout of a great Trump, to call all vvho are in the Graves to arise and stand up to judgement, they that have done vvell to the resurrection of life, but they that have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation; and the daie dravvs nigh a pace, vvherein the Book of conscience must be opened, and every one come to be judged out of the book of his ovvn conscience for all that ever hath been done in the bodie, vvhether it be good or evil, and he that hath done good shall go into life everlasting; but he that hath done evil into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his Angels, vvhere shall be vveeping, and hovvling, and gnashing of teeth, vvhere the vvorm never dieth, nor the fire is not quen∣ched, vvhich is the second death, out of vvhich there's no Redemption; but blessed and holie is he that hath his part in the first Resurrection, over such the second death shall have
no povver, but they shall reign Kings and Priests to God e∣ven for ever and ever; even so Lord Jesus, come quickly, A∣men. Written to you from the Lord God, vvho is Judge of quick and dead, by a lover of all your souls, that so vvith the Light of Christ Jesus vvithin, you might come to a true sight and discoverie of your estates and conditions, that so coming to be sensible of them, you might return to the Lord in your life time, before you be sealed up in the pit of everlasting darkness; for the day of sealing is come, and the Bride (the Lambs Wife) hath made her self readie, and is entred into the Bed-Chamber, And I John saw the Angel flying through the midst of Heaven, having the Key of the bottomless Pit in his hand, to seal and shut up all such who are found bearing the mark of the Beast in their fore-heads, and in their right hand, that they may be shut up and sealed for ever and ever. And this in love is vvritten to go abroad as a vvarning from the Lord to all people, professors, and priests every vvhere, but in particu∣lar, to them in Hartford and Ware, that so if possible some of them may come to repentance, and to an acknowledg∣ment of the truth in their life time, as it is in Jesus, before it be hid from their eyes, and may serve also for the use of any vvho have an eye to see, and an ear to hear: From a lover of all souls, knovvn to the vvorld by the name of IOHN GOULD, But hath a nevv Name, and a vvhite Stone, vvhich none knovvs but he that hath it. THE END.
