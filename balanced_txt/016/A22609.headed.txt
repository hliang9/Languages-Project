And for such of His Maiesties Subiects, as haue Cause to attend the Master and Councell of His Court of Wards and Liueries, to make their Compositions for Wardships, and suing out of Liueries, and other the businesses of that Court; His Maiesties pleasure is, that all such persons shall giue their attendance on the Master and Councell of the said Court at Acton, in the County of Middlesex, on Munday, being the fourteenth day of Nouember next; And so from time to time as that Court shall direct for dispatch of the businesse of the same Court.
