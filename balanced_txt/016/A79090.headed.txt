royal blazon or coat of arms C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE HIS MAIESTIES SPEECH At Leicester, to the Gentlemen, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of that County. Gentlemen, SInce I have found my presence so very acceptable amongst my good Subjects in these Northerne parts, and that the Errours and Mistakes amongst them, have wholly proceeded from mis-information, and are removed with more satisfaction, and case to them then they were received; I hold it a piece of my duty, to take the utmost paines I can, fully to informe and undeceive my People; and rather to prevent Crimes, then to punish them: In this Errand I am come to you, amongst whom there hath not beene the least misunderstanding, to shew you, That I doe not suspect any malice in the Place, or in the People; though persons of as ill dispositions have been busie in it, and amongst you, as in any County in England, and such who have taken as great paines to doe mischiefe, and to bring Confusion, as good men should for Peace and Happinesse: Though 'tis as true, that very many worthier persons amongst you have appeared of contrary affections, which I shall alwayes acknowledge: I am come to you in a time too, when nothing could invite mee to such a Iourney, but my Affection to, and good esteem of you; having sent such Propositions for Peace and Ac∣commodation to my two Houses of Parliament, that I hope to have no other use of your Affe∣ctions, but in your Prayers; being sure they will submit to them with all alacrity, if the unex∣cusable Enemies to the Peace of the Kingdom be not strong enough to prevail: And then you will find your selves so much concerned (for I have required nothing that with more justice can be denied me (if it be duly weighed) then my Crown, or my Life may be taken from me) that I shall not need to ask your assistance: I know you will bring Horse, Men, Money, and Hearts worthy such a Cause. Your Religion, your Liberties, your Laws (which I will defend with my life, I mean the good known Laws of the Land, not Ordinances without my consent, which till within these twelve Moneths was never heard of from the Foundation of this King∣dom) will be the Quarrell: And in such a Cause, the taking away my Towns, Ships, Armes, and Money from me, shall not dishearten me: The Concurrence and affection of my People with Gods blessing will supply and recover all.
