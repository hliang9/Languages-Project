royal coat of arms By the King, A PROCLAMATION. JAMES R. AMongst other the advantages of these Our Kingdoms, the Staple Commodities of Wooll and Cloth are peculiar thereunto, and the Manufacture of the same under several good and wholsome Laws made and Provided by the Wisdom of Our Royal Ancestors for the better Regulation and Improvement thereof, hath justly been esteemed a principal Happiness of this Our Realm, and long been the Envy of others Nations; And We (who equally de∣sire to promote the Good and Welfare of Our Kingdoms with any of Our Royal Predecessors and Ancestors) consi∣dering that nothing can prove more destructive to the said Manufacture, then the Exportation of Wooll into Fo∣reign parts, have as well by Our several Royal Proclamations, as by a Considerable Charge of Our own ex∣pended therein, shewn Our Gracious Inclinations and Purposes for the Maintenance and Encouragement of the said Manufacture, and for the effectual putting in Execution the Laws already made against such Expor∣tation, And yet the Methods taken for Prevention of the great Abuses therein, have not hitherto met with answerable Success; But the said Offence is now become a most notorious and common Nusance by the practices of divers evil disposed Persons, who being neither terrified with the Severity of the Laws, nor yet regarding Our Iust Displeasure conceived against them, do Combine among themselves, and together with others, Aliens and Foreigners, sometimes by Stealth, sometimes by open Force and Vio∣lence, to Export and Carry out of Our Kingdoms of England and Ireland divers great quantities of Wooll, Wooll-fells, Mort∣lings, Shorlings, Yarn made of Wooll, Wooll-flocks, Fullers Earth, Fulling Clay, and Tobacco-pipe Clay, wherein they are also Assisted by many dissolute and desperate Persons in great numbers, insomuch that Our Officers and others duly Impowered, and endeavouring to resist and prevent them therein, are often in peril even of their Lives, and by the number of Offenders are much discouraged from doing their Duty. And whereas divers of Our Loving Subjects from divers parts of this Kingdom, being Traders and Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture, by their humble Petition have proposed to Vs, That they are willing to make a voluntary Contribution among themselves as a farther means to Suppress the said Offenders, and for that purpose have humbly besought Vs to grant them Our Royal Licence and Authority to make a Collection of Moneys to defray the Charge of Prosecuting and Preventing the said Offences and Mischiefs, which Charge will be very considerable in regard of the great num∣ber of Offenders throughout Our said Kingdoms; We therefore out of Our Gracious and Princely Care of the Good and Wel∣fare of Our People, Have thought fit by Our Royal Commission under Our Great Seal bearing Date the Eight and twentieth day of June last past, directed to several Persons therein mentioned, For preventing the Exportation to Wooll, to Impower and Au∣thorize them, or any Seven or more of them, from time to time to cause to be Prosecuted and put in Execution the several Laws made against the Exportation of Wooll, Wooll-fells, and other the things before mentioned, out of Our Kingdoms of England and Ire∣land; And also to Collect, Gather and Receive, and to cause to be Collected, Gathered, and Received from any of Our Subjects what∣soever, such Sum and Sums of Money as they or any of them shall from time to time voluntarily Contribute, Advance and Bestow, for and in order to the Preventing the Exportation of Wooll, Wooll-fells, and other the things before mentioned, out of Our said Kingdoms, and for the better Discovery and Punishment of the said Offences, and to imploy the said Moneys so Collected according∣ly; Which Voluntary Contributions so to be made by any of Our Subjects whatsoever, to the ends and purposes aforesaid, We have thought fit by the Advice of Our Privy Council, and We do by this Our Royal Proclamation, Allow, Recommend and Ap∣prove, not doubting but Our Loving Subjects will cheerfully and readily assist and promote so useful and publick a Work. And further, as well in pursuance of the aforesaid Laws, as in Virtue of Our Royal Prerogative, We do again hereby streightly Charge, Prohibit and Command, That no manner of Sheep, Wooll, Wooll-fells, Mortlings, Shorlings, Yarn made of Wooll, Wooll-flocks, Fullers Earth, Fulling Clay, or Tobacco-pipe Clay be at any time hereafter by any Person or Persons whatsoever, whether Natural-born Subjects, Denizens or Strangers, Exported, Transported, Sent or Conveyed out of Our Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, or Town or Port of Berwick upon Tweed, or any the Isles, Ports, Creeks or Places thereof, into the Kingdom of Scotland, or any Foreign Parts beyond the Seas, upon pain of Our Highest Indignation, and the utmost Pe∣nalties which by the Laws and Statutes of this Our Kingdom may be Inflicted upon the Offenders, their Aiders, Procurers, Abetters and Favourers, their Lives and Estates; And Our further Will and Pleasure is, That all Wooll, Wooll-fells, Mortlings, and other the things before mentioned, and all Boats and Vessels Seized and Condemned by Force of any the said Laws, shall be brought to London, Kingston upon Hull, Exeter, or one of them, and there (and not elsewhere) disposed of, to pre∣vent Selling them again to the Owners, as hath hitherto been too frequently practiced. And lastly, We do hereby streightly Charge, Require and Command all and every Mayors, Sheriffs, Bayliffs, Constables, Headboroughs, Tythingmen, and all Officers of Our Admiralty, and all and every other Our Officers and Manisters as well Civil as Military by Sea and Land, and all and every Our Subjects whatsoever whom it may concern, diligently to observe, and readily to Aid, Assist and Defend all Per∣sons concerned in the due performance of this Our Proclamation in all things. Given at Our Court at Windsor the Twelfth day of August, 1688. In the Fourth Year of Our Reign. GOD SAVE THE KING.
