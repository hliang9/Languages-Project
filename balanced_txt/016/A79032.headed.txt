C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms BY THE KING. A Proclamation prohibiting the buying or disposing of any the lading of the Ship called the SANCTA CLARA, lately brought into South-Hampton. COMPLAINT having been made unto His Majesty, by Don Alonco de Car∣denas Ambassador from the King of Spaine, that a Ship called the Sancta Cla∣ra belonging to the said King and His Subjects, hath been lately treache∣rously brought to South-Hampton, by one Captain Bennet Strafford and o∣thers, from Sancto Domingo, the said Ship being laden with Silver, Coche∣neale, and other Wares and Merchandizes to a very great value; And that the said Ship and Goods, being by the said Ambassador arrested, and the said Bennet Strafford apprehended, whil'st a suite for the said Ship and Goods is depending in the Court of Admiralty, the Silver (part of the lad∣ing of the said Ship to a very great value) hath been disposed of contrary to Law, without any other security given for the same, then the empty Name of publicke Faith, which without His Majesty cannot (as is well knowne to all the world) be engaged, or if engaged without His Majesty, is not valid, or to be relyed on for satisfaction. And it is further complai∣ned by the said Ambassador, That the Cocheneale, and other Merchandizes formerly sequestred at London and South-Hampton, albeit they are not perishable, but have rather encreased in their Price and Value, are likely to be sold against the Will of those who pretend to be the Owners, (Parties to the suite depending in the said Court of Admiralty) which is alleadged to be apparently against the Rules of Law, and practices of that Court in such Cases. His Majesty well weighing what may be the ill Consequences of such injurious Proceedings, manifestly contrary to the Law, and the Articles of Treaty between the two Crownes, and plainly foreseeing how heavily it may light upon such of His good Subjects, who have Estates in Spaine, and how destructive it may prove to the Trade and Commerce of his Subjects and Kingdomes, doth here∣by not only expresly Charge and Command the Judge of his Admiralty, and all others whom it may con∣cerne, to proceed in a Businesse of such Value and consequence, with Care, Expedition, and accor∣ding to Justice; But doth also expresly prohibite all persons, of what condition soever, upon pretence of any Order or Warrant from one or both Houses of Parliament, or any Authority derived from thence, to buy, meddle with, or dispose of any part of the said Cocheneale, or other Goods or Merchandizes be∣longing to the said Ship, untill the propriety thereof shall be judicially decided and determined, Upon paine of His Majesties high Displeasure, and of being responsible and lyable to payment and satisfacton for whatsoever damage shall happen to any of His Majesties Subjects, whose Goods or Estates shall for that Cause be embargued or seized in Spaine: Given at the Court at Oxford, the second day of January, in the Eigh∣teenth yeare of His Majesties Reigne. God save the King.
