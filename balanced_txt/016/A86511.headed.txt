The Honest Souldier, OR, A VINDICATION OF THE Reduced-Officers, otherwise called REFORMADOES; AGAINST The blastings of most grosse Untruths, wherewith they have been Aspersed: OR, The honest Souldier, that between Jerusalem and Ierico, fell amongst Thieves, who robbed him of his Arrears, stripped him of his live∣lihood, and wounded him in his Reputation. PSALM. 44. vers. 14. All this is come upon us, yet have we not for∣gotten thee; neither have we dealt falsly in thy Covenant. Vers. 18. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way. Vers. 26. Arise, for our help and redeeme us for thy mercies sake. LONDON, Printed in the Yeare, 1648.
The Honest Souldier, OR, A Vindication of the Reduced Officers, otherwise called Reformadoes, against the blastings of most grosse Un∣tuths, wherewith they have been Aspersed. TRuth is my Witnesse (which needs no Screen) a say∣ing (both old and true,) If believed, I have my aime, otherwise, I have performed my endea∣vours; let such as scruple it speak impartially, and (I am confident) when time and their own ex∣perience shall ripen the event, haply then, they may (though late) credit him whose daily wishes are, the God of goodnesse may speedily assist his distressed Church and King∣dome. It hath been observed by divers obliged Officers, such as at S. Law∣rence Church London, entred into a Protestation, by Commissions from his Excellency the Earl of Essex; afterwards, and lastly, by their Solemn League and Covenant; That although they have cordially acted accordingly (God protecting their endeavors thorough much perill,) yet have they not transgressed against those Engagements (either in their affections or actions) really for the Parliament of England, or against its Enemies. And notwithstanding the fidelity of such Officers (to so strong Engagements,) most faithfully and dutifully performed; others have obtruded into, or have conferred on them the most eminent Commands of the Kingdome, (who do not only refuse to joyn in those Engagements, but doe detest and ab∣horre the thing and all that have submitted thereunto;) although it
can never appear that those men shewed themselves more faithfull, or deserved better from the State or people of England; but to the contrary, very many amongst them have disobliged the King∣dome &c. and never looked an Enemy in the face, in any Expedi∣tion or Field (where Field Service was,) being taking into Service since the Kingdomes Enemies were quell'd and all danger past: Be∣sides, it is observable, that the condition of such Officers as acted (to the hazard of their lives, and losse of their bloud) for the Par∣liament of England, are worse and in lesse esteem, then theirs that acted against them; (O most unnaturall times!) It is undeniable, that the Parliaments Intrest became dubious, and few had engaged for them, had not the Champion of Englands Liberties (the Earle of Essex) undertaken it; A man of unparralled worth, Galentry, Noble birth, fixed principles, and known experience in Marshall af∣faires; whose person only and alone formed an Army, for their (and the Kingdomes) Service; when neither the Power, Declarations, or Remonstrances of Parliament, (in all visible appearence) could effect it: But how that matchlesse man (and such gallant spirits as as did engage with him) have been gratified, let the covert and hidden thoughts of those that then voted to live and die with him speake, (as in the presence of the all-seeing God) to which I shall submit. And although matter of much discouragement might also have been observed (in the Occurents of such times) after that excellent man (and the faithfull-men that served the Parliament under him,) had with indefatigable paines raised and marched with a formidable Army, to ballence their numerous and potent Adversaries, and had constrained them to acknowledge the Parliament at Westminster, and encouraged their Masters (the State of England) to own that name, untill his Excellency and they had peaceably laid down their Commissions, and surrendred their Power into the hands that gave it; It, yet being from my purpose and a task to hard for me, I wave it: Only that this may redound to his perpetuall and never dying honour (upon whom every dayes additionall experience multiplies the dear affection of his perplexed Countrey,) that having in sundry great Battels faithfully performed his Trust, fortunately Conquered their Enemies, and triumphed in the love and hearty affections of all; this Champion of his Countrey surrendered his Charge into their hands that gave it, with as much content and quiet, as he had
with magnanimity and courage at first undertaken it; although had he disputed the thing, rubbed up past injuries, or demurred untill repairation or satisfaction had for himselfe and others, whose in∣juries and just Demands were also great, and might more justly have challenged that, then some have since done; certainly, he could never have wanted for power, credit, or greatnesse to support his under-takings therein, and Vindicated himselfe and them: But he owned not so vile and low a thought, selfe respects, or other ends then what did wholly tend to his first undertaken Interest, either to enthrone himselfe, or purchase other being, then what he was born unto, the heir which he aimed to enrich, was the Kingdom and People of England only; for whose weale he contended, and with that contentedly laid down and died. And herein as I intended not a scrutiny of his Excellencies parti∣cular sufferings, so neither have I purposed to numerate or sum up theirs subordinate to him, although their discontents were infinite, (to their perpetuall dishonour be it spoken, that have ungratefully reaped the haverst of their so perillous, pious, and faithfull endea∣deavours;) but where Religion and our duty to God comes into neglect and derision, the pious Professours thereof sleighted, scorned and abased, our great and admirable deliverances ungratefully recei∣ved, and in stead of Reformation (according to Protestations and Covenants promised,) a licencious Toleration of Sects, Schismes, Herisies and prophanesse; O where the sacred Ordinances of God have been sacrilegiously trampled upon! what can men (although never so well deserving) expect. But hence to my further purpose (that is to say) how and in what manner the Services and expectations of the Kingdom, became fruitlesse under the hands of those men commonly called Reforma∣does, is that intended here: This afterwards, there arose another Pharo in Egypt that knew not Ioseph, whose Tax-Masters became cruell &c. Those impose impos∣sibilities, Bricks are expected without Straw; new Lords new Laws, new Mouldings for new Designs. Now Committees (a new and Arbitrary device) have the King∣doms sole Power, commonly chosen in every County of the No gene∣rall rule without excepti∣on &c. for both the Kingdom and Soul∣diers have found some noble con∣scientious Gentlemen amongst those, as the Com∣mittees of Hampshire, Wostershire, Shropshire, Buckingham, and some few besides that were civill to the Coun∣trey and paid the Soldiers. lowest and meanest men (as most proper for the purpose intended) neither shuting with civility &c. or any property becomming so honourable a charge, these have the Kingdomes sole Power in laying Asses∣ments
for Contribution, Excise, 5th and 20th part, Delinquents Fines, Compositions, and Sequestrations; by vertue whereof, as if it had been unanimously agreed upon where ever they came, they make short and clear work of the Kingdomes Treasures, which they hoard up and bank improperly, and the better to shelter their close and fraudelent purposes herein; the Commanders and Officers Millitary (for whose support and entertainment primarily such asses∣ments were intended,) are vilified, aspersed, neglected, thwarted, and discouraged; their wages, pay, and subsistance detained from them, and in a very large measure converted to the unsatiable use of those Vermine; after their supporters, &c. (men generally known) of a straine above those men, and two straines in Covetousnesse before them (under whose screen those Caterpillers are propt up) had been gratified with the more solid weighty part; a practice so fully known to the Kingdom, especially, the Counties where these men are; and to the Searchers of Graves-end, Dover, and other Ports of this Kingdome, that I shall not need expresse here more of it. And wherein the Souldiers (for better satisfaction) have beene necessitated to enter into a scrutiny or closer discovery of such practices; their persons have been calumniated, detracted, affronted, scandalized, discouraged, and so much made unserviceable; that the time which they should have better bestowed in service against the Enemies to manage their weighty employments in; they must be faine to convert into Solicitations, assume the garbe of an Agitator, or humble Orator at a Committee-mans Lodging; their Clark or Door-keepers Chamber, trace Westminster Hall, or by favour crowd into the Loby and there cringe, flatter & faune to the Members for a nod (which hapily may be obtained by the favour of their Servant, Footman &c. a favour beyond their merits or former Service,) a garbe most improper and unbeseeming Souldiers, men of Honour and Gallantry, that would in the face of an Enemy rather breathe their last, then daign so low and ignoble an employment, chiefly from those men for whom their bloud and lives was not thought deare to purchase peace; (but what will not necessity force men unto, especially, from seeming friends) whose civility oblige very much, especiall when strengthened with a conscientious Cause, en∣deared by Protestations, Covenants, and a faithfull winning Generall; wherefore that no just staine might stick upon their Honours, or
blemish their Integrity, in dischage of their duty to God, and their trust to man, the necessities of effecting both being so prevalent, viz. Recruts of men, money, horses, arms, ammunition &c. without which undoubtedly the Kingdomes Expectations was not to be sa∣tisfied, or the Souldiers wished for Victory compleated? and is there any honest minded man, but would rather undergoe any dif∣ficulty, to support and carry on a concernment so high and pious, then desert it thus for a puntilio of honour, although indeed the posture be beneath a Souldier, and although also the causes of their atten∣dance ought to have been provided to their hands (by those men unto whom they became Petitioners;) Neverthelesse such was the gallantry, fidelity, and piety of most Commanders, Officers and Souldiers, (disdaining those discouragements and infinite more be∣sides) they resolve rather to submit, cast themselves upon the worst of miseries and try all conclusions, then desert their Covenant or quit their Trust. Neverthelesse, here resteth not the violent and piercing malice of those beginnings, but daily became more heightned upon them, as well to the encrease of their discontents, as to the ripening of some hidden mystery, then enforcing admiration (but at this day unvailed, and with coulours displayed open,) which then caused their more narrow and particular scrutiny, where in it is discovered, that the longer they struggle or strive to steare fast unto their com∣mands, the more they are ensnared, untill the ends are obtained, which is either to wrest their Commands out of their hands, or become dejected Slaves, and hold by villinage from reall Villains their dunghill Committee Lords. And when it succeeds not effectuall to their expectations thus, secondary attempts are endeavoured, either maliciously objecting (or putting into the mouthes of their impudent and brazen fore-headed crue of Varlets Tub-Preachers Male and Female. to object,) that such and such, are Persecutors of the Saints, debauched, profane &c. or they are treacherous, and may endanger their Trust to the Enemy; the Malignants have accesse and favour more then fitting &c. with infinite besides, the least of which being sufficient cause without Examination, & legall tryall or proceeding Marshall or Civill to deprive them of their Commands, if by tedious attendance full of perplexities, wants and miseries, they have not been forced to quit them or starved out of them. And wherein such or like practices come short of their expecta∣tions,
jealousies and discontents are somented between the Officer in Chiefe, and such as are subordinate unto them; especially, where there they find inclinable men and ambitious spirits, to such offers of perferment are made, as their superiours commands &c. apt suell, and very catching amongst Souldiers, and the only alluring bait to rend and divide Officers and Souldiers. Or otherwise thus, viz. In favouring such men (as are conceived fittest to bring on their Design) with more constant pay or greater allowance, whilst the Chiefe Commander or Officer, on whose shoulders lie the greatest charge (and who frequently have employed with their purses and credits to furnish the defects insident to their Com∣mands) are unjustly sleighted and aspersed. And againe, where a Brigade or other distinct Command have been united by speciall Order for particular Services, yea, and where their duty have been one and the same; notwithstanding, the one as of the Corum or greater Trust, have been constantly payed; the other (although without exception inferiour to none in courage, activity, and integrity,) nothing, of purpose to invite or allure the Souldiers of the one to desert them and inlist with the other. And to this I adde another as probable, viz. such a Garrison, For∣tresse, &c. is superfluous, uselesse, and such Forces Supernumerary, and therefore to be sleighted or Reduced out of hand, though with as much dexterity, a pretended sanctified brother again repossesses that Garrison; and the Reduced Forces by another brother of the same stamp are again inlifted, that the Kingdome may be eased of Supenumeraries, Reprobates as they call them, to enlarge the Domi∣nion of their Saints. But now to another; That is to say, when by Order or Or∣dinance of Parliament, effectuall Authority hath been granted, to such or such to Command such a Garrison, Castle &c. wherein much fidelity and care was performed in many streights and difficulties, where not only Garrisons, but strong filled Forces of the Enemy have continually been (whilst any Enemies did appear in any part of the Kingdome:) Neverthelesse before both Houses had thought expedient or fit to Demolish or sleight such Garrison, Castle &c. or Reduce such Forces, a single Order of the House of Commons hath been by strong Forces of Horse and Foot forced upon them; yea, and often before any Order at all for that purpose, whole
Regiments of Horse and Foot have surrendred their Quarters, and lien upon them so close, as at a Leaguer, when by the encroaching Enemies, they had been left scarce bread, and what the Enemy in their height of prosperity durst not attempt; those brethren of fraud, by a pretended friendship obtain, thinking thereby to ne∣cessitate a Disbanding, and this when the Kingdome was Reduced and wholy at their dispose to Quarter where they would. And here observe the fraudulent usage, these reduced Officers met with all; Ordinances of Parliament, strong Declarations, Covenants, Promises of constant Pay, Honour, and infinite other the like plau∣sible pretences, to raise or induce them to raise and take up Armes, are cast before their eyes; but the danger past, Enemies quelled, and those men triumfantly settled in a flourishing condition of ease and profit: A bare Mandamus from the House of Commons is then thought sufficient Authority to Disband them, without per∣formance of any thing; where to the contrary, their Modell bre∣thren receive encouragement, are applauded and deemed men of much holinesse, for being disobedient and refractory: The other re∣puted for obedience, a reprobate and profane Rabble. But that it may appear, these men of disobedience have been of more repute and better provided for, let the Ordinance of Decemb. 24. 1647. bear witnesse, wherein as a frontis-piece or usher of good hopes, two Ordinances of the same Date, seemingly proffer an ample provision for the generallity of Reduced Souldiers, out of the Excise, De∣linquents Estates, but presently in the Rear marched a third Ordi∣nance of the same Date, which not only cuts of the Reduced Soul∣diers hopes therein, but gives the said Excise and Delinquents Estates, with the addition of Bishops Lands unto their godly, as they call themselves, though indeed the children of disobedience, (most conscientious dealing) those being in standing pay, the other long since reduced and having not wherewithall to buy their bread. And lastly, although these men have neither deserved well from the Parliament, of whom they are ill members and worse principled, bringing dishonour upon that Honourable Assembly, because of their base ends, their Countrey for whose good they pretendedly sate; or to the honest Souldier who deserved better from them; yet that their qualities and not their names may appear (although both are well known unto me, and could justifie the verity of each particular herein Charged, have pointed at the time, when,
where, and by whom, but unwilling to act by their example, & to asperse or lay so grosse calumny upon the particular person of any with whom in a cause so pious we did partake, although degenerate & fallen from good prin∣ciples, & at a most vast distance from us & honesty. Nevertheless, purposing rather to drive home to their consciences their numerous errors & atheisti∣call actions, and to excuse the innocent, then accuse any, I have therefore thought fit to add their ensuing dealings with us, which to the judicious may suffice to clear and vindicate the reduced Officers from that most unchri∣stian like aspersion of protracting the War, suggested purposely to effect the designes now on foot; and which with much greater reason should be charged upon the Sectaries, who unjustly assume the honour of their Coun∣tries Saviours as their due, and onely proper to them: Although the Cove∣nanting reduced souldiers in all Services, to the finishing or full compleating of the War, are known to have born the greatest share; having during three or four yeers continually, and in the strength, heat, cream, and gallantry of their enemies (whilest forreign and home Recruits of money, horses, plate, &c. came abundantly to their aid) withstood them, and spun their gallan∣try, even their prime gentry &c. into a desperate, destitute, and dejected con∣dition, although not without much perill and misery on their part. And though I am not ignorant that these may come into such hands as will joy in our divisions, (having spared my pains herein a long time for that very purpose); yet rather then suffer so unjustly, and that perpetually, and know∣ing likewise that those men are not ignorant of those harsh practises against us, I thought fit publickly to appear in our vindication (which indeed comes not forth without extreme necessity) hoping our long patience un∣der such heavie aspersions may justly excuse us. And here 6 wayes are to be taken notice of whereby deserving men have been injured. 1. The constant practice of detaining pay, that their souldiers might de∣sert them, and repair unto others which were better paid, even those very men, or like them, that are now in high esteem; viz. Sectaries. 2 Shortning Relief or Recruits of horse, arms, &c. whereby the Enemy may get an advantage against them, that they might come to dishonour or disgrace; which being once got into the mouths of such instruments as are for that purpose set on foot, those honest souldiers are nipt off, and the o∣ther renowned champions spoken of are straightways ingrafted in their stead. 3 Not enabling men (of integrity, without exception) with power to punish for any crime, purposely that their Souldiers might grow licentious and unruly, thereby hoping dishonour may come unto their Commander, and Petitions from the Country, or the parts where such Commander ser∣ved, to request his removal, that so, &c.
4 The sending forth their renegado Tub-preachers, male and female, into every Garison, &c. not onely to instruct and teach licentiousnesse a∣mongst the Souldiers, but to try the Commanders how they did affect that Doctrine, that where they were despised, they might not onely shake the dust off their feet against such men, but hasten into the Army to —, and with him, and others of his cut, raise infamous reports against whom they pleased; which must be swiftly carried about, that no authour may be catcht with it: and thus unheard, unseen, these guiltlesse souls are betrayed, whilst up comes a brother, ut supra, &c. 5. That souldiers should more cheerfully decline their imployments, and less earnestly proceed in demand of arears: the Irish service is seemingly of∣fered, to which (being exceedingly devoted) they do with as much reality tender themselves, and with all diligence speedily endeavour to strengthen their forces, still screwing up their credits aswel to recruit as to keep on foot those they have, when words and promises, their remaining remedy for se∣verall months, are thredbare worn, and can prevail no longer, whilest no∣thing of consequent as to the accomplishing of such proposals comes to their relief, until the Country distasting the pressures of free quarter, rise a∣gainst them, and force them to disband, or their other necessities dissipate or disperse them. Colonel Devereux, Colonel Mydhop, and sundry others have suffered much herein: and others there are which obediently quit their commands in the model Army according to order, aswell to shew their o∣bedience, as to take on that service, met with no better usage herein; let Colonel Sheffield, Sir Robert Pie, Quarter-master General Fincher, Colonel Butler and many besides, add to this their knowledge. 6. To bring up the rear with the single example of a singular deserving man (the Van in spight of malice without exception) Colonel Graves is or∣dered to guard the Kings person: but whether doubtfull his command might become permanent or lasting, and in time by his gallantry extinguish those new lights, he is designed to be surprized by a crew of &c's. without order, and hardly escaped with his life: his souldiers, like as Col. Sheffields, Sir Robert Pies, Col. Poynes, and many gallant men besides put on and en∣couraged to mutiny against them. To these I could add infinite other ex∣amples; but let these suffice at present. And though I have willingly past over many unsupportable sufferings of those Reformadoes or reduced Officers, because I would hasten unto the obstructions they met withall after reducement, untill when General Fair∣fax and the Councel of the Army set forth their Representation to both Houses of the 7 of Decemb. 1647. in which their Saint-like charity, with the fruit∣less attendance, and future expectations of those wanting Gentlemen may appear.
And thus having been despitefully dealt withall by their tax-masters, and with menaces unsupportable compeld to quit their fair though deer bought holds in Goshen, neither furnished with jewel &c. or other borrowd stuff to support so endlesse a journy, yea without consideration had of their salary, arears, or other maintenance either for the present or the future, they re∣move and march on towards the Land of promise at Westminster-hall, under the conduct of much promised hope where they incounter not onely with a large and deep sea or gulf full of miseries far unlike that the children of Israel quietly marches over & more in resemblance to the other which met with Pharaoh and his host in the rear) but a wildernesse of endlesse scarcitie, (where in stead of better meat, they are fain to feed on fraudulent Orders, scornful answers, and lying promises; or, what is worse, the pillar, cloud, light, their director, is endeavoured to be vailed from their eyes, and pillars of New light from Satan obtrude, who guide the Kingdoms treasure and these mens wages into his Infernal Country, for the security of these his Saints the blinde guides): A wildernesse not improperly to such as since this reducement have made trial of Westminster-hall, and numerous removes to the several Committees of Associated Counties and others, chiefly that of Accounts at Free-mans Hall, London, a Labyrinth, with the several wind∣ings and turnings whereof, never yet bottomed by any; where they are up∣on Oath to accuse themselves, and never the neerer to effect their purpose; and where also, although they bring good Certificates for actual service, from their chief Officer, sufficient Avouchers, perfect Audits, and full and just Testimonials under the hands of Country standing Committees or Sub-Committees for Accounts; (things past thorow and gotten with exceeding great difficulty and expence from those two last sorts of men especially, who are continually averse and at enmity with Souldiers; it may justly be suspected by order or instruction from their Masters:) difficult indeed, I say, to be attained unto by the reduced Officers; although the godly party (that since the Kingdoms reducement have became their Countries defen∣ders, and neither before or since purchased it at so dear a price) have found better successe: But, as I said, where Reformadoes with much expence, and postings into the remotest Countries of the Kingdom, have at last per∣fected their desires abroad, and full of hopes returned to Free-mans hall; there yet again they are retarded: either there wants an Establishment, a full Committee, their Clerks servants and door-keepers are grown Masters, and cannot be compelled to attend unlesse they may be better paid: a just exce∣ption, and more becoming a Souldier to have stood upon, when his wages was detained, and his life in hazard, then such petty Clerks, and a causlesse complaint too, if well examined: for it is well known, that there are Soul∣diers have sold or pawned their clothes to purchase dispatch and accesse
from those Leeches: but there is yet a remora which retards their proceed∣ings: either it is Term-time, and the Counsellors Members of that Com∣mittee (without whom their Colleagues, Tradesmen and Citizens, igno∣rant, and not so well vers'd in that calling (it should seem) fearful to out∣strip their knowledge, dare not proceed) must attend their profit at West∣minster: or it is Exchange-time, and the vacation of the other concerns them as much: Which shuffle and pack really comes from Westminster, and but in species from those Gentlemen of that Committee, of whom in this I have not the least thought of guilt, onely that they dare not offend—▪ Which may the better be discovered, if observed how often they petition∣ed for redresse herein, but never received satisfaction, neither could they ever understand of any Order, Ordinance, or other Instructions of Parlia∣ment in their behalf, until Birch his Ordinance of the 28 of May, 1647, fast and loose: fast, I say, as to the completing or besting any mans Accounts complete or perfect (an ingratiating policie of a seeming Presbyterian, who needed no Ordinance for audit of his accounts, being well paid before, or he is extremely belyed); but loose, and very clear, as to any thing that could intrap or beat down the Souldiers accounts: all which did give them just cause to suspect that nothing lesse was intended, then by such delays they might be inforced to contract debts upon them, whereby at length they should be necessitated to flee their demands, and quit further claim; or (as by my experience I may speak it) be forced to contract with—for a small part in satisfaction of all. And thus, whilst they lie under the greatest and highest rage that malice can inflict, still chaste and unmoveable to their Covenant, its Parliament and friends, modestly expressing their unfeigned necessities by Petition and other deportments of civility, they reserve rough and sleighting answers, gestures and looks of reproach (fit objects for scorn and revenge in high spirits, and may not unjustly be suspected intendedly to have been put upon them to enforce mutiny, or some act properly fit or apt for Question, and losse of their Arrears: witnesse the black list, and other menaces many, bug∣bears that frequently stand aloft to affright Reformadoes. But that these great professors of Zeale (full as impious in their preten∣ces, as blasted in their piety) could strain at a gnat and swallow a Cammel full glib, let the Records, Orders and Ordinances of their Derby-house and—&c. beare record with their unsanctified consciences and come in Judgement against them: what vast gratuities of thousands have been dar∣ed over & tost from one member to another & joyntly (none dissenting) to their godly deserving brethren, in recompence of pretended (though false) losses, and as many (falsely usurped) services, performed by more deserving men, and by Peters the Post snatcht from them and presented to the—you
may imagine in another shape: some of which members had never been worth the 20 part of the gratuities given them, and others whose estates were vaste, full as great in avarice, without remorse of Conscience or thankfulnesse to God, or those wanting souldiers (that as a scrine stood between the enemie and them, their lives and estates) hurd up their wages, and the Kingdoms treasurs, that rather should (out of their own plentifull estates presented to their hands) have contributed to the releife of their ne∣cessities. And here likewise the ungratefulnesse of many Divines is not to be past over, that in an audience proper, at seasons fit and apt, upon texts of Scripture, rather complain of Leane Benifices, promote themselves and their interest, boast what miraculous victories their prayers have wrought, how they stood in the gap, and what God hath done for them in this worke, in every pulpit inforcing their own praise, and artributing to the souldiers nothing, (where they might have told him to be contented with his wages when he can catch it:) It is undeniable that the prayers of many godly men prevailed much, to which the courage strength activity or force of the Souldiers, (I mean chiefly the first undertakers) was not compatible: for a Horse is a vain help, and shall not deliver any by his great strength: (neverthelesse herein are not such praise worthy instruments (that couragiously indeavoured to perform their obligation to God and their Country) to be forgotten. Now when as much time had been spent in expectations, and many lean faces did expresse the wants they met withall at Westminster (whether a∣shamed such objects of pittie came so frequent into open view, or of pur∣pose to decoy them into the Country, amongst their friends and kindred for recrute of flesh and cloths) the deluding Ordinance of the tenth of De∣cember 1646, is prepared, which directs them for pay to the Countries or assocaitions in which they had formerly served, where those perfidious Committees in obedience to the private instructions of their Masters a∣bove, are prepared with delayes for all, but pay to none, and at the last af∣ter much chargeable time spent and more experience gained to no purpose, they return to Westminster; where objected to grow numerous, new plots are sooner projected then discovered, the houses are in danger, and those quondam friends the Reformadoes must now be reputed new ene∣mies, or to judge more charitably, (the houses being carefull of their safetie in a time of inraged sicknesse (that had rather by much open their treasures to bury a starved soule of them, then to preserve him alive) they must not indanger their persons within 20 miles of London, unto whom the Royal∣lists are thought fit to be coupled, whose penalty extends only to imprison∣ment, but to the other (viz) their old friends the Reformadoes they add be∣sides imprisonment the forseit of their arrears, whereas had they in answer
to any of their modest petitions or humble requests receiv'd but any assu∣rance that they should have been payed or provided for, most of them had of their free accord quit the City and their chargeable attendance at Westminster. Here I though improper to my tax, yet being proper to this subject, I cou'd have spoken on an object of far greater pietie, (viz Gentlemen and o∣thers that have lived in good repute in Ireland, which here have neither friends to recrute flesh or cloths with, or houses that they can confidently put their heades into & also forced to wander in the same progresse at West∣minster-Hall out of their zeal & affection to the truth, (which you seemingly professe) that neverthelesse dayly passe by their wounded brethren full of anguish as the Priest and Levit did, Luke 10. when with Charity and justice, they should have been imployed into their country against the ene∣mies of God and their Peace before any: And had I not undertaken to con∣ceal names, such high crimes happily had forced me here to have culled out certaine of their unworthy country men, men in power and full of envy that comply with any for profit though to the ruine of their country and these poore soules; but this subject requires a volume, and therefore I am forced to shorten it here with this digression. Only let me say, thus much; I finde in Fames record Mr. Anesly and Sir William Persons honest true∣hearted men and beside them few. Forasmuch therefore as their afflictions have been untolerable in the eyes of just men (unto whom only they appeal and before whom they shall alwayes endeavour to approve themselves candid in their acti∣ons, and contienscious to their undertakings) they cannot conceive wherefore any just guilt should stick upon them, being unchang∣ably the same, alwayes as willing and ready as ever they have been, with their blood and lives to stand up in defence of their Covenant and in it, their Religiion &c: their King &c: the Parliament of England &c: the Subjects &c. and all the Covenants Legitimate brethren, defenders thereof against violence and oppression: unlesse it be a crime to acknowledge this, as many reduced officers by their petitions did the last of Iune, unto the Parliement then full and under no force, And within a little after, with their City bre∣thren at Saint Iames-Fields, Guild-Hall, and other places (from whom they expected a fuller measure of love and fixed performance for their kindnesse; But I wish in my heart they may not repent it, or gratfully remember it when God shall please to visite them with better times:) by an order of both Houses should have manifested (and beleeve it) shall again Nemine con∣tra dicenti whensoever that cause and the like authority shall require them: If I say this be a crime wherefore was It Imposed, and being imposed we and not you are the Judges of our own Consciences, you might have made
Interpretation of it to your ends, and our satisfaction in ease of conscience before it came to be imposed; but by your leave being taken, your sophestry may not excuse us before God, he beareth record with our consciences in what sence we received it; which accordingly by the Almighty help with life and limbe we will maintain. To impose it (if a crime) was yours, and the breach thereof shall never be laid to our charge God willing but how that may, be exacted from you, after this life, may be supposed; but because that may be least feared I wave it; however I dare confidently tell you there is in this life a day of account like to come and that speedily, where that pack-horse for carrying on designes, even that very sleighted thing will In∣force their humble submission, even theirs that so much scorned and derided it, where the abuse of Religion, King, Kingdom, and its vaste treasures for selfe ends, will come in judgement against them; in the mean time it behoveth your Committees, Excise men, Sequestrators, and vasalised Rable &c. to presse hard for an act of Indemnity, and it will as much concern you at that day to make strong provision for them as for your selves, for through them your nakednesse will appear, and your galled sides will sore trouble you. I say no more, a few words to the wise, &c. Pray are not those reduced officers oblig'd to defend the Parliaments rights and priviledges? what then is the jealousie? do they not know for whom they acted, how dangerous and fatal it may prove unto them if they should advance any other interest? where then lies the distrust? Is not their pay and arrears the fruits of their hard service utterly lost if they should relin∣quish the Parliament of England? what then on their part can be feared? O mysterie, how is this riddle to be unfolded? mary I conceive by the said Representation of Generall Fairfax and his councel of the Army, and a gratifying Ordinance from the Parliament formerly expressed which tells you of no other arreras or admittance to any audit for arrears but his army and such as did adhere to them, when they marched up—you know when, where and how, &c. how? adhere to that army with whom they had no au∣thority of Parl. to joyn? the army by order of Parliament, molded to a num∣ber certain in officers & souldiers, and then compleat (if not exceeding their number) in both? that army which contrary to its orders from the Parlia∣ment refused to disband, marched up beyond its bonds; forst, awed, and gave orders to &c.—their Masters? An Army that abhor the covenant and such as adhere unto it; disoblige government and all of its tenent? An Army that prise none but sectaries and libertines who onely are advanced by it and none but they from such good Lord, deliver my Reformado friends Say, what have those reduced officers or souldiers gotten, that were not of you, but for a time and necessity marcht with you? What preferment, what arrears, what expected satisfaction? were they not presently after
excepted against and disbanded as supernumeraries, went off without their pay which others had? With such comrades and of such principles, I am confident the reduced Officers will be exceeding cautious hereafter to joyn. But as to those that have been of a long time reduced from other com∣mands, recruted or ignorant at first of the designes, did insist in the Modell army (which are at this day the better part of their Armies horse and foot) old Souldiers who had been marshilled, exercised and drawn forth, under the Earl of Essex and other faithful Commanders of the Covenant stamp, of which sort I say at this day is the better part of the Army (other Officers excepted) to whom as they are honest men and of the first principles, from my heart I wish increase of happinesse and honour (things never to be at∣tained unto in that Army) and now as their reall friend let me advise them to be both vigilant and very circumspect how to take for currant such drosse as their mechanick Officers would force upon them or through their strength and power, build such strong fabricks for their Officers great∣nesse upon the destruction of Covenant, King and Kingdome: be wise in time my friends, come out of her, lest you share in her plagues: It is gene¦rally known that the cup of her filthinesse fornication &c. is brimfull: there fore return in time to your first principles. And in conclusion I shall request that the plainnesse or naked truths of my expressions may be excused in two respects, and not at all imputed to concern a third. First for the anguish of our present sufferings; which was hoped that no heart so adamant in tyranie but would have relented, or relie∣ved ere this, our wants: the other being the continuance without intermi∣ssion of that spirit of inveterat splene & malice with which we were redu∣ced, (remors in neither appearing though long & untill this present which with much patience and constancy expected,) forced these desperate truths with as much modesty as could be is performed, (our sufferings balanced) but if any part therein may seemingly reflect upon the Parliament of Eng∣land or its friends (for when we were by Covenant bound to fight and, pray,) and shall accordingly God assisting) being that meant in the third place let it be clear from my purpose or theirs for whom this is underta∣ken and put upon the score of such degenerte brats who designe and pra∣ctise what to the utmost extent of their power may to overthrow Parlia∣ment, King, Covenant and Kingdome: Ingeniously those are the men meant and no other, over whom in ballance of that black list prepared for us here a Scottish black list or mist stands touring for them and their gene∣ration from whose plots, practises and designes Great Samaritane preserve us. FINIS.
