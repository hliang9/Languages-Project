THE Composers Premonition to the unlearned Reader. THe prime word in the Title of this Booke being Artahthos is compounded of two Greeke words, namely Artos, in latine, Panis▪ Englished, Bread, and Achthos; in Latine, Pondus; Englished, Weight, signiying both together, the weight of Bread, where understand, ch, stands for the Greeke letter (Χ) which is pro∣novnced like chi or i, not like ch in the English word (child) but like ch, in, Christ, to whose tuition, I respectively com∣mended you. Yet once againe. By the Introduction to the At of Numeration prefixed or set before my Preface, those that are ignorant of numbering without figures or Letters, or of numbers in figures or letters, may become intelligent and perfectly understand any number in my table of Assise or elsewhere.
Lastly may it please the Learned (and chiefely Those whom it concernes) no lesse then the unlearned to be advertised that this booke of Assise by Certificate made unto the right ho∣nourable the Lords and others of his Majesties most honoura∣ble privy Councell was certified to be exact and true, but the last Booke of Assise intituled The Assize of Bread, very false and unfit for use; Whereupon their Lordships conceiving that this Booke would be of good use to his Majesties subjects and to the benefit of the Commonwealth, did thinke fit and order. That I should by the same order bee licensed to print the said Booke, and that in recompence of my studie and paines taken therein, I should have the sole benefit of the sale thereof, and that all other persons whatsoever should bee by the same order prohibited to print or vend any, but by my permission. Since which order, his Maiesty hath beene graciously pleased to graunt unto me a speciall Priviledge to that purpose and also a Proclamation commanding all those whose duty it is to looke unto the iust weight and assise of Bread to take care, that the same be duely observed according to this Booke. The Booke to his future Master. Some faults I have, which you may note ith end, And (though I cannot) with your pen amend; So shall you finde my service, in despight Of Enemies detraction, iust and right: Yet how (alas) can Bookes unfaulty be Where None that make them are from Errors free.

THe great care and paines (Right Honourable, and Right Wor∣shipfull) which upon Reference from the Right Honourable the Lords and Others of His Majesties Most Honourable Privie Counsell, Your Lordship, with Others Your Brethren, Committees worthily selected, namely, Sir Ed∣ward Bromfield, Sir Morris Abbot Knights, Master Alderman Abdi and Master Alderman Garwaie, maturely tooke about the examining,
altering and perfecting of this my new Booke of Assise, for both sorts of weights (howbeit, under favour, I may averre, the same was by me exact∣ly computed) together with your high Commen∣dation thereof by Certificate to their Honours, as also the continuall industry and travell of the Lord Major and Sheriffes of this famous Citie, annuis vicibus, or from yeare to yeare, in assising and looking to the Assise and Weight of Bread, have moved me (as one compelled, and as it were challenged by due Gratitude, humbly to present and tender the same Worke to your most deser∣ving Patronage, with firme confidence, that as a Childe of towardly disposition, when hee is growne up, and by honest meanes hath attained a faire estate or certaine livelyhood, cannot be un∣welcome to his Foster-father, by whom hee was carefully cherished, educated and preferred; This Issue of my laborious Art and Study, begot∣ten and brought forth for the general good of this Kingdome, shall now (having received so emi∣nent preferment, compleat condition, and condu∣cible supply) enjoy the benigne Entertainment of Your Lordship and Worships, much transcen∣ding your former approvement; And so much

A Briefe and Plaine Introdu∣ction to the Art of Nu∣meration. THere are Nine severall formes of Figures, besides one of a Cipher: Which are these here ensuing. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 0. The same doe signifie as followeth. 1. one. 2. two. 3. three. 4. foure. 5. five. 6. sixe. 7. seven 8. eight. 9. nine. The Cipher (0) signifies nothing, unlesse it bee placed next after some Fi∣gure or Number on the right hand, and then it increaseth the value or quantity of that Figure or Number, making the same Ten times so much; As 10, sig∣nifies Ten; 20, Twenty; 30, Thirty; 40, Forty; 50, Fifty; 60, Sixty; 70, Seventy; 80, Eighty; 90, Nine∣ty: And where two Ciphers have a Fi∣gure next to them in the Third place, they make the same Figure to increase in value or quantity a hundred times; As 100, signifies One hundred; 200, signifies Two hundred, and so forth. So 1000. (where are Three Ciphers) signifies One thousand; 2000, Two thousand. And so to greater Numbers and further places.
But not to trouble you with any more places then in Numeration there are Figures; where you find any number composed of Figures onely, or of one or divers Figures with one or more Ciphers, you must account the figure or cipher next to your right hand to be in the first place, and the Figure or Cipher next behind the same towards your left hand to be in the Second place, and so backwards to the Ninth place. For the more plaine demon∣stration whereof, this following Table of Nume∣ration is inserted. Where you must note, In the first place, 1, sig∣nifies one; 2, two; 3, three; 4, foure; 5, five; 6, sixe; 7, seven; 8, eight; 9, nine; being all Unites. In the Second place, 1 signifies ten; 2, twen∣ty; 3, thirty; 4, forty; 5, fifty; 6, sixty; 7, se∣venty; 8, eighty; 9, ninety. In the third place, 1 signifies one hundred, 2, two hundred; 3, three hunnred; 4, foure hun∣dred; 5, five hundred; 6, sixe hundred; 7, seven hundred. In the Fourth place, 1 signifies one thousand, 2, thousand; 3, three thousand; 4, foure thousand, 5, five thousand; 6, sixe thousand. In the Fift place, 1 signifies ten thousand, 2, twenty thousand; 3, thirty thousand; 4, forty thousand; 5, fifty thousand. In the Sixt place, 1 signifies one hundred thou∣sand; 2, two hundred thousand; 3, three hundred thousand; 4, foure hundred thousand. In the Seventh place, 1 signifies one million,
which is ten hundred thousand; 2, two millions; 3, three millions. In the Eight place, 1 signifies ten millions; 2, twenty millions. In the Ninth place, 1 signifies one hundred millions: So that the same Table of Numeration may be read as followeth. The Table of Numeration. ninth place. eighth place. seventh place. sixth place. fifth place. fourth place. third place. second place. first place.   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 123 millions 456 thousand 789   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 millions 345 thousand     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 million  ousand 567       1 2 3 4 5 6 123 thousand 456         1 2 3 4 5 12 thousand 345           1 2 3 4 1 thousand 234             1 2 3 123               1 2 12                 1 1 Now for your practice, whereby you may attain the perfect understanding of all the Numbers in my Table of Assise. In the first page or side thereof, under the word (Price) against vjd, you shall finde under the word (Troy) 338, which signifies three hundred thirty eight. For 8 in the first place signifie eight, 3 in the second place signifies thirty, and 3 in the third place signifies three hundred, as is before declared.
Under the word (Avoirdupois) 370 signifies three hundred seventy. For the 0 in the first place signifies nothing, but 7 in the second place signifies seventie, and 3 in the third place three hundred. Yet take away the 0 and the Number is but thirty seven, because 7 be∣ing then in the first place signifies seven, and 3 in the second place thirtie. In the second page or side, under the word (Troy) against vjd, the number 1015 signifies one thou∣sand and fifteene: for 5 in the first place signifies five, 1 in the second ten, 0 in the third no hun∣dred, and 1 in the fourth, one thousand. By the same rule under (Avoirdupois) in the next place 1112 signifies One thousand one hundred and twelue, under (Troy) in the next place 1353 signifies one thousand three hundred fifty three: And under (Avoirdupois) in the next place 1483 signifies one thousand foure hundred eighty three. And this may suffise for the Introduction to the Art of Numeration, and the perfect understand∣ing of my Table of Assise. Where note under the word (Price) d stands for denarii, signifying pence, and s for solidi signifying shillings, and li. for librae, signifying pounds. Yet because the use of the seven numerall Letters is unknown to many, I thought fit to adde this Ta∣ble of numbers following.
The Table of Numbers dige∣sted in foure Columnes. The first second third fourth conteining Numbers in Figures. Numerall Letters, Roman. Numerall Letters English. Plaine words. 1 I i one 2 II ii two 3 III iii three 4 IIII iiii foure 5 V v five 6 VI vi sixe 7 VII vii seven 8 VIII viii eight 9 IX ix nine 10 X x ten 20 XX xx twenty 30 XXX xxx thirty 40 XL xl forty 50 L L fifty 60 LX Lx sixty 70 LXX Lxx seventy 80 LXXX Lxxx eighty 90 XC XC ninety 100 C C a hundred 200 CC CC two hundred 300 CCC CCC three hundred 400 CD CD foure hundred 500 D D five hundred 600 DC DC sixe hundred 700 DCC DCC seven hundred 800 DCCC DCCC eight hundred 900 CM CM nine hundred 1000 M M a thousand Note that IV likewise signifies IIII (where I is set behind V) as IX signifies nine which takes as it were by stelth, or pulls back one from foure and ten. So X set behinde L or C takes away ten, and C behind D or M takes away a hundred, as here appeareth. Note also, that Twenty signifies twice ten; Thir∣ty, thrice ten; Fortie, foure times ten; Fifty five times ten; Sixty sixe times ten, or threescore; Seventy, seven times ten, or threescore and ten; Eightie, eight times ten, or fouscore; and ninety nine times ten, or foure∣score
and ten. For other Numbers, from X to XX, from XX to XXX, and so forwards to C, the former numerall Letters are to be set re∣spectively before them; as for eleven, XI; for twelve, XII, and so forth. Againe, for any Number from C to CC, from CC to CCC, and so forwards to M, the foresaid Numbers respectively are to be placed before them, as for a hundred and one. CI; for a hun∣dred and eleven, CXI; for a hundred twenty and one, CXXI, and so forwards to M. But the Numbers in Figures and Ciphers are otherwise to be used; for from 10 to 20; from 20 to 30; and so forwards to 100, the Ʋnites are to be placed in stead of the Cipher; as for eleven, 11; for twelve, 12, and so forth. Againe, for any Number from 100 to 200, from 200 to 300, and so forwards to 1000, the said Ʋnites must bee there∣unto added, in stead of the latter Cipher, as for a hundred and one, 101, a hundred and two, 102, and so forwards to 1000; as in my Introduction precedent is more at large expressed.
The Composers Preface. SO captious is the Condition and Custome of many (if not most men) in surveying others workes, that whatsoever transcends their se∣dulous apprehension, or in their conceit seemes on the suddaine unnecessarie, or not fitting, without any favourable expostulation, or deliberate con∣sulting, they will unworthily and unwittingly vi∣tuperate and reprehend. Lest therfore this my Labor should come with∣in compasse of their traducing miscensure, who haply will suppose it superfluous, if not a simple part in mee to set downe the price of Wheat, or li∣mit the Assise of Bread at 6 d. the quarter, in re∣spect it was never knowne or heard in this Land, either before or since the Conquest, that Wheate hath beene sold so wonderfully cheap. In this case to vindicate or free both my selfe and it by a faire and (I hope sufficient) Apologie, albeit I cannot prove (I ingenuously confesse) by any Record, Chronicle, or History, such vilitie or cheapnesse of that deere graine, as 6 d. the Quarter, to have had any being in this peaceable Island; neither is it likely here to happen; my respective Request is,
That it would please them to take notice of these reasons following. 1. This Table is computed according to the Statute Law of 51o. H. 3. Whereby it is ordained, that when Wheat is sold at xii. d. the Quarter, the Farthing White loafe of fine Cocket shall weigh 6 li. 18 s. which is 82 ounces, 16 penny weight Troy, so that the ob. white of the same Cocket ought proportionably to weigh 165 ounces 12 penny weight; Again, the farthing white loafe of course Cocket shall weigh 7 li. 1 s. which is 84 ounces, 12 penny weight; so that the halfe-penny white of the same Cocket ought by the like proportion to weigh 169 ounces, 4 penny weight. And ac∣cording to the said Statute, as also the ancient or∣der and custome of this Countrey, the 1 d. whea∣ten (being Bread made of the whole Wheat) ought to weigh 3 halfe-penny white of the same course Cocket, named in that Statute a Cocket and a halfe, and the 1 d. houshold (being Bread made of common wheat, ought to weigh two penny white of the same course Cocket, named there two great Cockets, onely the Assise of the fine Cocket loafe is purposely omitted (as unnecessary) in this Booke. Now the Assise at 6 d. the Quarter being twice so much as that at 12 d. I thought it necessary to be∣gin therewith, much rather than with 12 d. (which is the first in the Old Booke) partly for the more decent formes sake, every page containing 20 se∣verall prices of the Quarter of Wheat, beginning with an odde 6 d. and ending with even shillings;
and all the sorts of Bread presented by every paire of Pages lying open at one Enterview; but espe∣cially because the said Assise at 6 d. the Quarter ap∣peared the fittest foundation of the whole work, or the Fountaine from which all the rest doe di∣mane, and indeed may be used as the Touchstone of Proporrion, whereby the truth of all the other Assises may be tryed; as if the 1 d. Houshold (wheat being at 6 d. the Quarter) shall weigh 1353 oun∣ces, 12 penny weight Troy, the question being ask∣ed, what the same shall weigh when Wheate is at 3 li—3 s—6 d. the Quarter; Seeing in my Table directly against 3 li-3 s-6 d. the weight of the 1 d. houshold by Troy weight is 10 ounces, 13 penny weight, and 21 parts of a penny weight in 127 divided. Not to perplexe or trouble the scrupu∣lous Perusers with any deeper art than Multiplica∣tion, let them multiply the 10—13—21 by 127, because there is 127 times 6 d. in 3 li—3 s—6 d, and the Product will be 1353 ounces 12 penny weight, the Assise at 6 d. the Quarter. Or otherwise if the Rule of Multiplication bee a Stranger to them, they may by the Rule of Addition adde the same 10. 13. 21. together 127 times, and the Totall will bee the same with the Product in Multiplication aforesaid. The like order you may observe in exa∣mination of the Assise by Avoirdupois weight. A∣gaine, seeing against 3 li. 4 s. the weight of the 1 d. houshold is 10 ounces 11 penny weight, and 4 parts of 1 d. weight in 8 divided, multiply the 10. 11. 4. by 18, because there is so many times 6 d. in 3 li. 4 s. or (as aforesaid) adde the same together
128 times, and the Product or Totall will bee the Assise at 6 d, the Quarter. 2. By the Statute Law touching Bakers and Brewers, and other Victuallers, 31o. E. 1. the As∣sise or weight of Bread is ordained not to be chan∣ged, but by the increase or decrease of 6 d. in the sale or price of a Quarter of wheat in the Market; so that the price of wheate rising or falling 6 d. in the Quarter, the Assise or weight of Bread ought to be accordingly diminished, or augmented. And therfore it seemed unto mee the more meet to be∣ginne with 6 d. the Quarter, and so to proceed by Increase of 6 d. in the Quarter, even unto 5 li. where the old Book extended not beyond 3 li. 6 d. the Quarter. Yet as the plenteous blisse of the one Extreme, namely, 6 d. a Quarter never was, nor (I conceive) will be knowne amongst us, so by Gods grace, I do well hope, this Land shall never sustaine the pe∣nurious bale of the other. Howbeit in the 8 yeare of E. 2. the Dearth was so great, that wheat was sold for 40 s. the Quarter, which was as much, or rather more, than 6 li. at this day. Againe, as the old Table of Assise was drawne from 20 s. to Lx. s—6 d. the Quarter, in respect wheat (as the ground that did beare and breed the same, and all other things) became through the populousnesse of the Land, or the plenteousnesse of Gold and Silver, more deere than in former times, or else through the weather; or (as it was in the 36 year of Q.E.) through the Merchants unrea∣sonable
exportation; By the same reason and Pre∣sident I have brought the said Lx. s. vi. d. to 5 li. the Quarter, and the rather to keepe the Baker alwaies within Assise. Lastly, the difference betweene this new Table of Assise, and the old, is not onely in the Extent thereof to 5 li. as aforesaid, but in computing the same as well by Avoirdupois weights, as by Troy weights, being approved exact and true, and by me carefully examined at the Presse. And heere I cannot over-slip in silence, what I have read of the Venetians, viz. They take such course, that every moneth it comes to their know∣ledge, what quantity of Corne their Dominions doe conteine; where certaine discreet and honest men are authorized every Monday to impose a price on the Corne according to the quantity thereof, who thereupon doe declare in writing under their handes in severall publicke places, of what weight the Baker is to make his Bread; so that even the poorest man knoweth what weight he is to have; who in case he shall finde the Baker faulty, may with the assistance of the Constable seise all the Bread extant at the Bakers house, as forfeited, the one halfe to himselfe, and the other to the poore; By which meanes, all Ingrossers and forestallers are cut off, being not desirous to buy, because they are uncertaine what the price of the Market will be from time to time. And again, the Magistrate is not troubled to see this good order executed, for that every man hath a speciall care to receive his due. And (may I without offence ut∣ter
my minde) I could wish that the Magistrates throughout England would take the like order herein, both for their owne ease and the general good of this Commonwealth. Howbeit may the Orders and Articles hereun∣to annexed, be well observed and executed, as al∣so this Booke bee provided and lie ready in the houses, and for the use of the Magistrates, Justices of peace, and other Officers whom it concernes, and of every one that useth Avoirdupois weight, I am verily perswaded the Baker dares not make his Bread under the just Assise. And so I con∣clude my Preface.
Of Troy and Avoirdupois Weights. THere are two sorts of Weights with us most in use and allowed, the one is called Troiae pondus Troy weight, or Libra & vncia Troiana of old Troy, or of Troy∣novant, as the Citty of London was called of old, or else of Tronage as it were Trone weight, as Fleta termes it, the word Trone comming of Tro∣nage, which weight is originally derived from the the Graines of wheat, whereof thirty two made the Penny weight, which was thereupon divided into 24 graines of metall, being now the weight of 3 d. sterling. Of which Penny weights, 20 make the Ounce, and twelue ounces make the Pound Troy; Now this weight serveth to weigh, not on∣ly Gold, Silver, Pearles and other precious things, as Electuaries and Amber, but also Bread by ap∣pointment of the Statute Law, from which weight is derived or drawne the Assise and Gawge of all manner of wet and dry measures. The other Weight is called Avoirdupois (vul∣garly or corruptly Avoirdepois or Haberdepois) of the words Avoir de pois in french, which sig∣nifies in Latine Habere pondus, asmuch to say, To have full weight, whereof 20 graines make a scru∣ple, 3 scruples a dram, 8 drams an ounce, and 16 ounces a pound.
Now this weight serves to weigh all sorts of things not before mentioned, all Grocery and Physicall drugs, and all Grosse wares and merchan∣dize, as beefe, butter, cheese, tallow, sope, wax, ro∣sen, pitch, tarre, hempe, yron, copper, leade, tynne, allome, wooll, silke and all other things that beare the name of Garbell and doe yeeld a refuse or waste. By both which sorts of weights this my Table of Assise is made and computed. Now the difference betweene these two sorts of weights is this. That 14 ounces and a halfe and 2 penny weight Troy, bee equall in weight with 16 ounces Avoirdupois. As I my selfe have pro∣ved by seeing them counterpoised at the Gold∣smiths hall London; whereby it appeares, though the ounce Troy be heavyer than the ounce Avoir∣dupois, yet the Pound Troy is lighter then the pound Avoirdupois. According to which Counterpoise of weights 73 ounces Troy are equall in weight with 80 oun-Avoirdupois. As may more plainely appeare by the threefold Table ensuing.
The Weight of the Quantities of Meale to be contei∣ned in the severall Measures concave of England. According to The Standard Exact computation   conteineth Pounds. or Ounces.

A pinte conteineth one pound or twelve ounces (according to the Standard of his Majesties Exchequer) but (according to exact computation) 1 l. 15 penny weight 12 graines Troy and 24 ounces Avoirdupois. And so of all the rest. Where is to be noted that by the Statute 11 and 12 H. 7. iust 12 ounces Troy make the Pinte, the 15 d and 12 graines being overslipt or not regarded. And albeit 8 Gallons by the same Statute make the Bushell, there is allowed by the same Statute 10 Gallons (which conteine 5 pecks) to the Bushell within Shipboord, for wa∣r measure.

THE Description and Vse of The Table of Assise or Weight of Bread. THe Table being digested in 20 pages or sides, every page conteyneth 3 parts or divisions, whereof the first towards your left hand sheweth the price of a Quarter of wheate in the market, the rest shew the Assise or weight of the severall sorts of Bread by Troy and Avoirdupois weights, to wit, of the halfe penny white, the penny white, the penny wheaten and the pen∣ny houshold, as their severall Intitulations or words on the heads of each part or columne doe evidently declare, where is to be noted, Vnder the word Troy. O. signifies Ounces, P. Penny weight, and the figures there∣under respectively placed doe signifie so many Ounces and Pen∣ny weights, Vnder the word Avoirdupois. O. signifies Ounces, D. Drams and the figures thereunder re∣spectively placed signifie so many Ounces and Drams. Againe, 73 (being a denominator) signifies a dram broken
or divided in 73 parts and the figures thereunder (being Nume∣rators) doe signifie so many parts of a dram so broken or divided. Lastly Vnder the words Troy and Avoirdupois. Nu. signifies Numerators and in the next columne towards your right hand, De. signifies Denominators, the figures under De. signifying a penny weight Troy broken or divided into so many parts; and the figures under Nu. in Troy weight doe signifie so many parts of a penny weight so broken or divided. The fi∣gures under Nu. in Avoirdupois weight signifying so many parts of one part of a Dramin 73 divided. Now for the Vse of this Table. Suppose, when the second wheate, (which is the Red being in meale) is sold for iiii l. the Quarter in the market, you would know what the Assise or weight of Bread should be in London, or any other Citty, Borough or Corporate Towne where white, wheaten and household are usually baked and sold. In this case, considering that the Baker there is allowed by the orders hereunto annexed vi s. for the baking of a Quarter of wheate, over and above the price of the second wheat in the mar∣ket. Looke in the 17 page of the Table under the word (Price) for iiii l. vi s. and directly against it you shall finde the weight of the halfe penny white by Troy weight is 1 ounce 19 penny weight and 15 parts of a penny weight in 43 divided. By Avoir∣dupois weight 2 ounces, 1 dram and 18 parts of a dram in 73 divided, and 7 parts of one part of the 73 in 43 devided. Of the penny white, by Troy weight 3 ounces 18 penny weight and 30 parts of one penny weight in 43 divided. By Avoirdupois weight 4 ounces 2 drams and 36 parts of one dram in 73 divided and 14 parts of one part of 73 in 43 divided. Againe, looke in the 18 page of the Table under the word (Price) for iiii l. vi s. and directly against it you shall find the weight of the penny whea∣ten by Troy weight, 5 ounces 18 penny weight and 2 parts of a penny weight in 43 devided; By Avoirdupois weight 6 ounces 3 drams 54 parts of a dram in 73 divided and 21 parts of one part of 73 in 43 divided. Of the penny houshold, by Troy weight
7 ounces 17 penny weight and 17 parts of a penny weight in 43 divided. By Avoirdupois weight 8 ounces 4 drams 72 parts of a dram in 73 divided, and 28 parts of one part of 73 in 43 divided. Now if you would know what the Assise or Weight of Bread should be out of Cities, Boroughs or Corporate Townes, or in Cities, Boroughs or Corporate Towns, where white and houshold only are used to be baked and sold, considering that the Baker is allowed by the foresaid orders, but iiii s for the baking of a Quar∣ter of Wheat over and above the price of the second wheat in the market. Looke for 4 l. 4 s. under the same word (Price) and di∣rectly against the same in like manner you shall finde the weight of every sort of Bread as aforesaid. As for the Assise of the Halfe penny wheaten and Two penny houshold; The one may bee knowne by taking halfe the weight of the Penny wheaten, the other by doubling the weight of the Penny Houshold. For Example. First the weight of the penny wheaten being by Troy weight 5 ounces 18 penny weight, and 2 parts of a penny weight in 43 divided as aforesaid. Take the halfe of 5 which is 2 ounces 10 penny weight, the halfe of 18 penny weight and the halfe of 2 parts of a penny weight in 43 divided. And all those halfe parts added together make 2 ounces 19 penny weight and 1 part of a penny weight in 43 divid. which is the weight of the ob wheaten. Againe the weight of the Penny wheaten by Avoirdupois weight being 6 ounces 3 drams 54 parts of a dram in 73 divided and 21 parts of 1 part of 73 in 43 divided. Take the halfe of 6 ounces, the halfe of 2 of the 3 drams and then adding 73 for the odde dram to 53 of the 54 parts of a dram which make 126, take the halfe thereof being 63 and lastly adding 43 for 1 part omit∣ted of the 54 to the 21 parts which make in all 64, take the halfe thereof, all which halfe parts added together make 3 ounces 1 dram 63 parts of a dram in 73 divided, and 32 parts of 1 part of the 73 in 43 divided. Secondly the weight of the Penny houshold being by Troy weight 7 ounces 17 penny weight, & 17 parts of 1 penny weight
in 43 divided. Double the same, and the weight of the two penny houshold will be 15 ounces 14 penny weight and 34 parts of one penny weight in 43 divided. Againe, the weight of the penny houshold by Avoirdupois weight, being 8 ounces 4 drams, 72 parts of a dram in 73 di∣vided, and 28 parts of 1 part of 73 in 43 divided. Double the same, and the weight of the two penny houshold will be 17 ounces 1 dram 72 parts of 1 dram in 73 divided, and 13 parts of 1 part of 73 in 43 divided; As by the severall works thereof here ensuing may appeare.   Troy.   Avoirdupois.     O.

The Penny vvheaten 5 18 2 43 6 3 54 21 43 The half penny wheaten 2 19 1 43 3 1 73 43 43               126 64                 63 32             8 4 72 28 43 The penny houshold 7 17 17 43   9 145 56   The 2 penny houshold 15 14 34 43   8 73 43             17 1 72 13   Here you are to observe, in respect the Denominator 43 signifies in Troy weight one penny weight broken or divided in 43 parts, you must adde one to the place of penny weights, when you find the Numerators being doubled do amount to or above 43, as you adde one to the place of ounces, so often as in such doing you find 20 penny weight. And in respect the same De∣nominator signifies in Avoirdupois weight, one part of 73 broken or divided in 43 parts, you must adde one to the Numerators under 73, when you finde the Numerators under Nu. being doubled, doe amount to or above 43, as you adde one to the place of drams so often as in such doubling you find 73, and as you adde 1 to the place of ounces so often as in doubling the drams you find 8. But these Fractions in both sorts of weights are set downe, not to be strictly required or stood upon, but to prove the more exact computation of my Table. And so I leave you to the use thereof.

How the Baker ought to be punish∣ed for breaking his Assize. 1 By the Statute of the Assize of Bread and Ale 51. An. H. 3. (amongst other things) it was enacted. THat if a Baker be convicted for not keeping his Assize, the first, second, and third time, he shall be amerced according to the quantity of his offence, so as he offend not above 2 s. (which is an ounce and 4 d. weight) in his far∣thing loafe, but if he exceed 2 s. then he is to be set on the Pillorie without redemption by mony also, if he offend often, though under 2 s. and will not amend, he shall be set on the Pillorie. 2 By the Statute of Bakers and Brewers, and other vi∣ctuallers. 31. Anno E. 1. it was (amongst other things) enacted. THat a Baker, if his Bread of a farthing be found wanting but 2 s. 6 d. (which is an ounce and a halfe) shall bee amerced, and if it want more weight then that, he shall be set on the Pillory, nor shall not redeeme it by gold and silver.
3 By the Orders of the Lords of his Majesties most ho∣nourable privie councell hereunto annexed. ALl unlawfull Bread may bee taken away by the Clerk of the market, or his deputie, or by the Major, Baliffe, or other Officers of Cities, corporate Townes and Liberties, or by the Master and Wardens of the Company of Bakers of the citie of London, their Officers or Ministers, and distributed to poore prisoners and other poore people. An Order for musty Meale. IF any person shall sell any Meale deceiptfully mix∣ed, musty or corrupt, which may be to the hurt of mans body, or by any deceitfull meanes or false sleight, so to deceive the Subjects. For the first offence he shall be grievously amerced. For the second, he shall loose his Meale. For the third, he shall suffer the judgement of the Pillorie. And the fourth time, he shall forsweare the towne where he dwelleth. Here is to be noted that if the Baker buy corne un∣ground by the Quarter (as was intended by the Sta∣tute) he hath 68 l. Troy to the bushell, and is to pay the Millers tolle, but if Avoirdupois weight, he hath but 56 l. from the Millers tolle. 2 That the Magistrates are not to question the Baker (as some have done) what qvantitie of Bread they make of 56 l. Avoirdupois, but only to see they keep their Assize according to the Statue.
Allowances heretofore made to the Baker for baking a Quarter of Wheat. Anno 1266. 51. H. 3. when Wheat was at 12 d. the the Quarter which was as much as 3 s. at this day. The Baker was allowed.     d. q. for Three Servants 1 2 Two Lads 0 2 Salt 0 2 Yeast or kneading 0 2 Candle 0 1 Wood 2 0 His Boultell 0 2 Two loaves for advantage and his bran. 0 2 In all 6 d. 1 q. In the time of Edw. 1. as it seemeth and as the old Book of Assize (which hath relation to the Statute of Winchester) declareth, The Baker was allowed     d. q. for Growt and furning 3 0 Wood 3 0 The Iourney men 3 2 Two pages or Prentizes 1 2 Salt 0 2 Yeast 0 2 Candles 0 2 His ty-dog 0 2 And his bran. in all 1 s. 1 d
Anno 1495. 12. H. 7. and as the said Book of Assise de∣clareth: When the best Wheat was sold at 7. s. the se∣cond at 6. s. 6. d. and the third at 6. s. the Quarter. The Baker was allowed,   d. For Furnace and Wood 6 The Miller 4 Two Iourney-Men and two Apprentizes 5 Salt, Yeast, Candle, and Sack-bands 2 Himselfe, his House, his Wife, his Dog, and his Cat. 7 In all 2. s. 0 d. And the Branne to his advantage. 2 Iunii, 1592. 34. Eliz. it was presented by a Jury neere London before the Clerk of the Market of her Ma∣jesties houshold, that the best Wheat was at 21. s. 4. d. the second at 18. s. 8. d. and the third at 16. s. the Quarter: And that the Bakers should have allowed unto them for the baking of a Quarter of Wheat in and neere about London 6. s. 10. d. which was then allowed by the said Clerk of the Market to be so, in regard of the great charges and prises of every thing whch was thē much more than in former times the said Allowance being made as followeth, viz.     s. d. For Fuell 0 6 Two Journey-men and two boyes 1 8 Yeast 1 0 Candles and Salt 0 4 Himselfe, his Wife, children, & house-rent 2 0 The Millers tole 1 4 In all 6 10
Yet this allowance of 6 s. 10 d. was afterward re∣duced to 6 s. and 4 s. respectively; as in the epistle to the last book of Assize, directed to all Magistrates, and other his Majesties Officers, is at large expressed. The which said allowances, of 6 s. and 4 s. have been continued to this day, and by the Orders ensuing are still approved and confirmed. Here followeth what sorts of Bread have beene made in their Trials. FIrst, in the yeare of our Lord God 1311 (which is now above 320 yeares sithence) a Triall was made of three Quarters of Wheat, viz. one Quarter of the best Wheat, another of the second, and the last of the third Wheat, all which Quarters were made into se∣verall sorts of Bread, as it appeareth by Record in the Guildhall London, and they which made the same trialls were sworne for the doing thereof, before the then Lord Major of London. Secondly in the eighth yeare of King H. 8. by com∣mand of the Lords, and others of his Majesties most honourable Privie Councell, a Tryall was made of a Quarter of Wheat, viz. two parts thereof into wheaten Bread, one part into white Bread, and the fourth part into houshold, as it plainly appeareth in the time of Sir William Butler Lord Major of Lon∣don, which is entered at the Guildhall in the paper Journall fol. 238. Thirdly, 1 Iunii 1592. Eliz. 34. the like triall was made by the Clark of the market, of her Majesties houshold, and on the second day of the same moneth,
the presentment was made by a Iury, as before under the Title Allowances heretofore made &c. is declared. And the Law doth appoint three sorts of Bread, only to be made, viz. white, wheaten, and houshold, which are used to this day. Orders and Articles, made and set forth, by the right ho∣nourable the Lords, and others of his Majesties most honourable Privie Councell, as well for the making and as∣sizing of all sorts of Bread lawfull and vendible within this Realme, as for the reforming of divers disor∣ders and abuses used, and com∣mitted by sundry persons therein. FOrasmuch as We understand that divers Ba∣kers, and other persons taking upon them the Mysterie of Baking, and uttering of Bread unto the Kings Majesties Subjects, for their owne private lucre, have not only baked and sold Bread of od Assizes, made by their owne in∣ventions, but also sundry sorts of Bread, which are both repugnant to the Lawes of this Realme, and hurt∣full
to the common Wealth. We doe therefore will and require them and every of them, that they ob∣serve and keep the good & antient custome, in making, assizing, and selling of all sorts of their Bread, accord∣ing to the antient Lawes and Orders of this Realme, and the Table of Assize herewithall set forth, and not otherwise. Provided alwayes, And we doe order and appoynt, that according to the last Book of Assize of Bread, and as before in this book is related, the Baker shall be allowed for the baking of a Quarter of Wheat as followeth viz. Every Baker inhabiting in any Citie, Borough, or corporate Town, where white, wheaten, and houshold are usually baked and sold, shall be allow∣ed for the baking of a quarter of Wheat 6 s. the ra∣ther in respect of their great charges, and bearing of scot and lot upon all impositions; which said 6 s. shall be allowed according to the former allowance, in the 12 yeare of King Hen. 7. in the said last Book of Assize expressed; to wit, when the second Wheat is at 3 l. the Quarter, he may make and assize his Bread, as if the same Wheat were at 3 l. 6 s. the Quarter: And so in like sort as the price of the second Wheat shall rise or fall in the market. And that the Bakers not inhabiting in any Citie, Bo∣rough, or corporate Towne, or inhabiting in any Ci∣tie, Borough, or Corporate Towne, where white and houshold Bread only are used to be baked and sold, shall have 4 s. in allowance and no more, for the ba∣king of a Quarter of Wheat, which said 4 s. shall be allowed as the 6 s. before expressed. Item. That the forreigne Bakers which bring their Bread to be sold in the market of any Citie, or corpo∣rate
Towne (in regard they doe not beare scot and lot there as the Bakers of the said places doe) shall keepe and observe such weight in their severall sorts of bread as hereafter ensueth, viz. Their ob. white 1 d. white ob. wheaten 1 d. wheaten 1 d houshold 2 d. houshold shall weigh more than the same sort of the Bakers Bread there inhabiting 1 ounce. 2 ounces. 1 ounce & ½ 3 ounces. 3 ounces. 6 ounces. Item, That every Baker shall set his proper mark up∣on his bread according to the Law for Bakers and Brewers 31 E. 1 ch. 3. Item. That the Bakers shall make and bake to be sold farthing white bread, half-peny white, peny white; half-peny wheaten, peny wheaten; peny houshold, and two peny houshold: and none of greater size, upon paine of forfeiting all such greater bread to bee distributed a∣mongst poore people. The time of Christmas alwayes excepted. Item. That no Baker, nor any other person, shall make or bake to bee sold any other kinds or sorts of bread (except Simnell, Wastell, and Horse-bread, al∣lowed by the Lawes and ancient Ordinances of this Realm) as Spice-cakes, Bunnes, Bisket, or other spi∣ced bread (being bread out of assize, and not by Law al∣lowed) unlesse it be for burialls, or on Fryday next be∣fore Easter, or at Christmas, upon paine of forfeiting all the same Spice-cakes to bee distributed amongst the poore as aforesaid. Item. That no Baker or other person shall sell to any In-holder, Vintner, Victualler, Chandler, or other person either in mans bread or horse-bread to bee retai∣led
more than thirteene peny-worth for twelve pence, without any Poundage or other advantage, nor more than three horse loaves for a peny. And that every horse loafe shall weigh the full weight of a peny white loafe, whether Wheat be cheap or deare. By which As∣size of horse-bred the buyer gaineth 6 d. ob. in every 12 d. Item. Whereas wee understand, it is a common practice with many (if not most) Bakers to slice or cut their stale white bread into Sippets, and being well stie∣ped, and mollified in water, to intermix and knead the same together with their wheaten dow, to the great abuse and scandall of their Mysterie, and the wrong of his Majesties Subjects. We doe hereby order and com∣mand that no Baker doe from henceforth presume to intermix or mingle any such stale Bread, white, or whea∣ten, with, or amongst their wheaten dow, but doe make their wheaten bread as also their white and houshold all of new stuffe and pure, without any such abusive or adulterate mixture. Item, whereas on Tuesday the 22 of September 3. and 4. Phil. and Mary, it was ordered by the then Lord Major and Aldermen of the Citie of London, That no manner of White Baker or Bakers of the said Citie for the time being, should at any time from and after the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangel then next com∣ming, carrie, or cause to be conveyed, sent, or borne by his or their Servants, Apprentize, or Apprentizes, or by any other wayes or meanes at his or their charges, any manner of Bread to the house or houses of any common Inholder, Taverner, Alehouse-keeper, or of any other person whatsoever, which useth to utter, retaile, and sell the same againe, upon paine of imprisonment of the body of every person that should at any time offend in
this behalf, by the space of six dayes and as many nights, without baile or mainprize, whereunto the Wardens of the said Fellowship of the Bakers there present did assent and agree. And whereas on Tuesday the 14 of Febr. 1 Eliz. it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed, by the then Lord Major & Court of Aldermen of the said Citie of London, That every white Baker of the said Citie, for the time being, that at any time thereafter should be found disobedient or negligent in the observing and keeping of the vveight and assize of his Bread, vvhich from time to time should be given and appointed by the Lord Ma∣jor and Court of Aldermen of the said Citie for the time being, should lose and forfeit for every ounce that should lack in the just vveight that his Bread ought to keep, 3 shil. 4 pence, to the use of the Commonalty of the said Citie. And that it should bee lawfull for the Chamberlaine of the said Citie for the time being, to commit to Ward in the name, and by the authority of the said Court, every such offender as should refuse or deny to pay from time to time the said Fine to the use afore-said. Wee doe think fit, order, and require the Lord Major and Aldermen of the said Citie and their Successours, to see the said two severall Orders at all times from henceforth duly observed and executed. And we doe also require all other Magistrates and Offi∣cers in all Cities, Boroughes, and corporate Townes throughout the Realme of England, and Dominion of Wales, vvhom it may concerne, to make, ordaine, and observe the like orders within their severall Jurisdicti∣ons, Liberties, and Precincts, for the better ordering of the Bakers, and the restraining of them from offending, and the punishing of their offences in the like cases.
Item, that no person or persons shall keepe a common Bakehouse in any Citie or corporate Towne, but such persons as have beene Apprentize to the same Mysterie, or brought up therein for the more part of seven years, or otherwise be skilfull in the good making and true assi∣zing of all sorts of Bread. Item, we require the Lord Major and Sheriffs of the Citie of London and their Successours, and all other Magistrates and Officers throughout this Realm, whom it may concerne from time to time, to enter into the Shops and Houses, not only of the Bakers, but of all In-holders, Vintners, Victuallers, Cookes, Chandlers, and other persons which doe use to retaile, utter, or sell Bread, and there to weigh and try the weight and assize of the same. Provided alwayes, And we doe further order, and re∣quire, That the Clark of the Market of his Majesties houshold for the time being, his Deputy or Deputies, As also the Majors, Bailiffes, and other Officers of Cities, corporate Townes, and Liberties, and especially the Master and Wardens of the Company of Bakers of the Citie of London, their Officers, and Ministers, and every of them shall have diligent care and respect unto the due performance and execution of the premises, and shall, and may from time to time freely give and distri∣bute all such unlawfull Bread as shall be made and put to sale (contrary to these Articles) unto poore Priso∣ners, and other poore people. And further, we will and command all Iustices of Peace, Constables, Bailiffs, and other Officers whatsoever, to be ayding, assisting, and helping unto all th'aforesaid Officers in the execution hereof, as they will answer the contrary at their perills. FINIS.
A True Relation or Collection of the most remarkable Dearths and Famines, which have happened within this Realme since the comming in of William the Conquerour. As also The rising and falling of the price of Wheat and other Graine, from time to time, with the severall occasions thereof, briefly set downe according to the English Chronicle (a Book of much worth) the last Edition whereof was set forth with Additions by Edmond How Gent. in Anno 1631. THe course of penning introductive Preambles (fre∣quent with Writers) for brevities sake now avoid∣ed, albeit I might (and not impertinently) in this case treat of Gods three severall Rods or Arrowes, whereof his divine Majestie by ministration of the Prophet Gad, afforded free election to King David and wherewith at sundry times he hath sore afflicted this our land of Canaan, where the diuturnall miserie of Pestilence being with us not fully overpast, and Famine, as also the Sword or worse instruments of warre, incessantly working the most lamentable damage and destruction of our friends and neigh∣bours,
move me to remember that prudent Admonition of Horace to Lollius. lib. 1. Epist. Ecquid Ad te post paulò ventura pericula sentis? Nam tuares agitur, paries cùm proximus ardet. That is, Art thou insensible, or dost not see That dangers will ere long encounter thee? For when thy Neighbours house in flames doth shine, Then it behoves thee to have care of thine. My purpose is only to set before your eyes (Christian Rea∣ders) the Famines, and Dearths, which I find upon Record, England hath sustained, together with the particular occasi∣ons thereof, to the end that Those whom it most concernes may be put in minde of the best wayes under God, to pre∣vent the like future calamities. Beginning in the reigne of William the Conquerour. viz. An. Dom. 1069. In the third and fourth yeare of the said King, by meanes of the Normans wasting of England in Northumberland, and other places in the yeare precedent, such a dearth encreased through all England, especially Northumberland, and the Countries next adjoyning, that men were glad to eat Horses, Catts, Dogges, and mans flesh, for all the land lying be∣tweene Durham and Yorke, lay waste without Inhabitants and people to till the ground, for the space of nine yeares, ex∣cept only the Territory of Saint John of Beverlake. Of this you may read at large in the said Chronicle. An. Dom. 1086. In the 21 yeare of W. C. was a great dearth of cattell, and sore distemperature of the aire, so that many men died of Fea∣vers, and afterwards many others died of Famine. An. Dom. 1093. In the Sixt yeare of William Rufus, was a great Famine,
and afterwards so great a mortality, that the living were scarce able to bury the dead. An Dom. 1112. In the 13 yeare of King Henry the first was a sharp Win∣ter, great Dearth and Mortality of men, with Murraine of beasts of the field, and also of the house, and a great destru∣ction of Fowle. An. Dom. 1124. In the 23 yeare of the same King, by meanes of changing the Coine, all things became very deere, whereof an extreame Famine did arise, and afflict the multitude of the people even to death. An. Dom. 1177. In the three and twentith yeare of Henry the second, The black Book, containing the Orders and Rules of the Ex∣chequer, was compiled; wherein among other things is men∣tioned, That for provision of the Kings houshold from the time of King Henry the first, the Officers of the Kings houshold reducing their victualls into an Estimate of money, did value for a Measure of Wheat to make Bread for 100 men, xij d. for the carcasse of a fat Ox, xij d. for a fat Sheepe 4 d. and for the Provinder of twenty horses 4 d. An. Dom. 1205. In the seventh yeare of King Iohn, began a great Frost, which continued till the 22 of March, so that the ground could not be tilled, whereof it came to passe, that in the Summer following, a Quarter of Wheat was sold in many places of England for a Mark (which for the more part in the dayes of King Henry the second was sold for twelve pence) and a Quarter of Beanes or Peas for a Noble, and a quarter of Oates for 3 s. 4 d. which were wont to be sold for 4 d. An. Dom. 1222. In the seventh yeare of Henry the third, on Holy Rood day was a great Thunder and Lightning throughout all England, and such great Flouds of water followed, with great Winds and Tempests, which continued till Candlemas, that the yeare
following, Wheat was sold for 12 s. the quarter, which is as much as 36 s. at this day. An. Dom 1234. 18. Henry the 3. was a great Frost at Christmasse, which de∣stroyed the Corne in the ground, and the Roots of hearbs in the Gardens, continuing till Candlemasse without any Snow, so that no man could plough the ground, and all the yeare after was unseasonable weather, so that barrennesse of all things en∣sued, and many poore folks dyed for want of victualls, the rich being so bewitched with Avarice, that they could yeeld them no reliefe. Amongst whom Walter Gray then Archbishop of York, was not least covetous, of whom it is recorded that his Corne being then 5 yeares old, hee doubting the same to be spoild with vermine, did command that it should be delivered to the Husbandmen that inhabited his Mannours, upon con∣dition, that they should pay him the like quantity of new Corn after Harvest, but would give none to the poore for Gods sake, whereupon it came to passe, that when men came to a great Stack of his Corne, which stood neere the Towne of Rippon, there appeared in the Sheaves all over the same, the heads of Wormes, Serpents, and Toads, besides, a voice was heard out of the Corne-mow, saying, Lay no hands on the Corne for the Archbishop, and all that hee hath is the Devills. To conclude, the Bailiffes were forced to build a high Wall round about the Corne, and then to set it on fire, lest the vene∣mous wormes should have gotten out and poysoned the Corne in other places. How this Bishop died I have not read, and whether he went to God or the Devill, it is not for me to determine. An. Dom. 1248. 32 Henry. 3. by reason of embasing the Coine a great penury followed. An. Dom. 1258. 43 Henry. 3. A great Dearth followed the wet yeare past, for a quarter of Wheat was sold for 15 s. and 20 s. but the worst was in the end, there could be none found for money,
where-through many poore people were constrained to eat Barks of Trees, and horse flesh, but many starved for want of food, twenty thousand (as it was said) in London. An. Dom. 1288. In the sixteenth yeare of Edward the first, the Summer was so exceeding hot, that many died through the extremity there∣of, and yet Wheat was sold at England for three shillings foure pence the quarter. An. Dom 1289. 1 Edward 1. Great Haile sell in England, and after ensued great Raine, that the yeare following wheat was raised from 3 d. the Bushell to 16 d. and so encreased yearely, till it was sold for 2 s. 6 d. the Bushell. An. Dom. 1295. In the 23. yeare of Edward the first, the King caused all the Monasteries in England to be searched, and the money found in them to be brought up to London, Hee also seised into his hands all their lay Fees, because they refused to pay him such a Tax as hee demanded. Moreover, hee caused the Wooll and Leather to be stayed in England, and there followed great dearth of Corne and Wine. An Dom. 1298. 25 Edward 1. Was a great Famine in England, chiefly want of Wine; so that the same could scarcely be had to mini∣ster the Communion in the Church. An. Dom. 1299. 27 Edward 1. An Act of Common Counsell was made for prices of victualls to be sold at London by consent of the King, and Nobility, viz. a fat Cock for 1 d. ob. Two Pullets 1 d. ob. a fat Capon 2 d. ob. a Goose 4. d. a Mallard 1 d. ob. a Partridge 1 d. ob. a Phesant 4 d. a Heron 6 d. a Plover 1 d. a Swan 3 s. A Crane 12 d. two Woodcocks 1 d. ob. a fat Lamb from Christ∣masse to Shrovetide 6 d. and all the yeare after for 4 d. An. Dom. 1314. In the eight yeare of King Edward the second, the price of victualls being so excessive, that the common people were not
able to live, By Parliament at London 3. Febr. it was ordained, and the Kings Writs were published for prices of victualls not to exceed as followeth, viz. an Ox stalled or Corne fed 24 s. a grasse fed Ox 16 s. a fat stalled Cow 12 s. another 10 s. a fat Mutton Corne fed, or whose wooll is well growne 20 d. ano∣ther fat Mutton shorn 14 d. a fat Hog of two yeares old 3 s. 4 d. a fat Goose 2 d. ob. in the Citie 3 d. a fat Capon 2 d. in the Ci∣tie 2 d. ob. a fat Hen 1 d. in the Citie 1 d. ob. Two Chickins 1 d. in the Citie 1 d. ob. foure Pidgions 1 d. in the Citie three 1 d. 24 eggs 1 d. in the Citie 20 &c. Neverthelesse, all things were sold deerer than before, no flesh could be had, Capons and Geese were not to be found, Eggs were hard to come by, Sheepe died of the rott, Swine were out of the way, a quarter of wheat, Beanes, and Peas, was sold for 20 s. of Malt for a Mark, of Salt for 35 s. &c. An. Dom. 1315 8 Edward 2. The King in Parliament at London, revoked the provisions before made for selling of victualls, and permit∣ted all men to make the best of their owne. Neverthelesse, the dearth increased through the abundance of Raine that fell in Harvest, so that a quarter of Wheat was sold before Midsum∣mer for 30 s. and after for 40 s. There followed hereupon a grievous mortalitie of people, so that the living might hardly bury the dead, The Beasts and Cattel also through corruptnesse of the grasse wheron they fed, died. Horse flesh was accounted great Delicates: The poore stole fat Dogs to eat; Those Doggs became fat by feeding on the Beasts and Cattell that died: Some others in hidden places did mitigate their hunger with the flesh of their owne Children. The Thieves that were in prison, did phick in peeces those that were newly brought in amongst them, and greedily devour'd them halfe alive. The Londoners, the same yeare considering that Wheat was much consumed by the converting therof into Mault, ordained, that from thenceforth it should bee made of other graine, and also that a gallon of the better Ale should be sold for 3 halfe
pence, and of small Ale for one penny, not above. The King according to the Statute of London, sent his Writs through the Realme, commanding that in Cities, Boroughes, Townes, and Villages, as well within the Liberties as without, a gallon of Ale should bee sold for one penny. And that from thenceforth, no Wheat should be made into Mault, which if he had not the sooner caused to be proclaimed, the greatest part of the people should have perished through famine. An. Dom. 1317. 10. E. 2. The Harvest was early, so that all the Corne was Inned before Saint Giles day, being the first of September, a Bushell of Wheat which before was sold for 10 s. was then sold for 10 pence: and a Bushell of Oates which before was sold for 8 shil. was then sold for 8 pence. An. Dom. 1329. In the third yeare of Edw. the third, a Statute was made pro∣hibiting the Importation of Wheat, Rye, or Barly into this Realme, unlesse the price of wheat exceeded 6 shil. 8 pence the quarter, of Rye 4 shil. of Barly 3 shil. at that Port or place where the same should bee brought in, upon paine of forfeiture thereof. An. Dom. 1330. 4. E. 3. The Summer was so wet with abundance of Rain, that the Corne could not ripen; so that in many places they began not Harvest untill Michaelmasse, the house of Craxton got not in their wheat till Alhallontide, and their Peas not be∣fore Saint Andrewes tide. The Monks on Alhallonday and Martinmas day were served with Peas greene in the Cods, in stead of Peares and Apples. An. Dom. 1355. 27 E. 3. The Dearth of Corne by them of Ireland, and the Irish men that brought in corne to sell unto divers Havens of this Realme, was asswaged to the great reliefe of the people. An. Dom. 1358. E. 3. A great Dearth with Pestilence happened in England, which was called the second Pestilence.
An. Dom. 1369. 43 E. 3. Was a great Dearth of corne, so that a Busheil of wheat at London was sold for 2 shil. 6 pence, of Barly for 20 pence, of Oates for 12 pence. The occasion of this Dearth might bee supposed the exces∣sivenesse of a Feast in the yeare before, where the meats that were brought from the Table, would sufficiently have served ten thousand men. An. Dom. 1379. In the third yeare of Richard the second, a Bushell of wheat was sold for 6 pence, a gallon of white wine for 6 pence, of red for 4 pence. An. Dom. 1387. 10 Rich. 2. In the beginning of the yeare, at Leicester, 100 quarters of Barly were sold for 100 shillings. An. Dom. 1391. 15 R. 2. Dearth of Corne now almost continued for two yeares, whereby it came to passe, that when the time of fruits; as Nuts, Apples, Plummes, Peares, &c. was come, many poore people through over-feeding thereof died of the Flux. And if the commendable care of Adam Baume, then Major of London had not relieved the Commons, who continually provided, that from the parts beyond the Seas, Corne was brought to London to the Reliefe of the whole Realme, where otherwise without doubt neither had the Country sufficed the Citie, nor the Citie succoured the Country. To the furtherance of which good work in relieving the poore; The Major and Citizens of London took out of the Or∣phans Chest in their Guildhall, 2000 Marks to buy Corn, and other Victualls from beyond the Seas, and the Aldermen, each of them layd out 20 pound, to the like purpose of buying corn, which was bestowed in divers places, where the poore might buy at an appointed price, and such as lacked money to pay downe, did put in Surety to pay in the yeare following, in which yeare, When Harvest came, the Fields yeelded plen∣tifull encrease, and so the price of Corne began to decrease.
An. Dom. 1438. In the 17 yeere of Henry the Sixt, by meanes of great Tem∣pests, unmeasurable VVindes and Raines, there arose such a scarcitie, that VVheat was sold in some places for 2 shillings 6 pence the Bushell. An. Dom. 1439. 18. H. 6. VVheat was sold at London for 3 shillings the Bushell, Mault at 13 shillings the Quarter, and Oates at 8 pence the Bushell; which caused men to eate Beanes, Peas, and Barley, more then in an hundred yeeres before: where∣fore Stephen Browne, then Maior, sent into Pruse, and caused to be brought to London many Ships laden with Rye, which did much good; for Bread-Corne was so scarce in England, that poore people made them Bread of Ferne rootes. An. Dom. 1454. 22. H. 6. VVheat and other Graine were in such plentie, that a Quarter of VVheat was commonly sold for 12 pence or 14 pence; of Mault, for 16 or 17 pence at the most. A cer∣taine Farmer dwelling in Cruse Roysie, or Rosie Towne in Hertfordshire, sold 20 Quarters of the best VVheat for 20 shillings. An. Dom. 1486. In the second yeere of Henry the seventh, VVheat was sold at 3 shillings the Bushell, and Bay-Salt at the like price. An. Dom. 1491. 7. H. 7. Wheat was sold at London for 20 pence the Bushell, which was accounted a great Dearth. An. Dom. 1494. 10. H. 7. Wheat was sold at the like price.
An. Dom. 1521. In the thirteenth yeere of Henry the Eight, was a Dearth of Corne (with Pestilence) for Wheat was sold at London for 20 shillings the Quarter. An. Dom. 1526. 18. H. 8. In November, December, and Januarie, fell such abundance of Raine, that thereof ensued great Flouds, which destroyed Corne-fields, Pastures, and Beasts. Then was it drie till the twelfth of April; and from that time, it rained every day and night, till the third of June: whereby Corne failed sore in the yeere following. An. Dom. 1527. 19. H. 8. Such scarcitie of Bread was at London, and throughout England, that many dyed for want thereof. The King sent to the Citie, of his owne provision, six hundred Quarters: The Bread-Carts then comming from Stratford towards London, were met at the Miles end by a great num∣ber of Citizens, so that the Maior and Sheriffes were forced to goe and rescue the same, and see them brought to the Mar∣kets appointed; Wheat being then at 15 shillings the Quar∣ter. But shortly after, the Merchants of the Stiliard brought from Danske such store of Wheat and Rye, that it was better cheape at London, then in any other part of the Realme. An. Dom. 1553. In the first yeere of Queene Mary, at her Majesties com∣ming to the Crowne, Victuals were so plentifull, that a Barrell of Beere was sold for six pence, with the Caske, and foure great Loaves of Bread for one penny. An. Dom. 1557. 5. Mary, Wheat was sold before Harvest, for foure Marks the Quarter; but after Harvest, for five shillings: so that a
penny Loafe, which weighed in London the last yeere but 11 ounces Troy, weighed now 26 ounces Troy. An. Dom. 1558. 6. Mary, Corne rose to 14 shillings the Quarter. An. Dom. 1573. About Lammas, Wheat was sold at London for 3 shillings the Bushell; but shortly after, it was raysed to 4 shillings, 5 shillings, 6 shillings, and before Christmas, to a Noble, and 7 shillings; which so continued long after: yet there was no want to him that wanted not Money. An. Dom. 1586. In the 29 yeere of Queene Elizabeth, about Ianuarie, her Majestie observing the generall Dearth of Corne, and other Victuals, growne partly through the unseasonablenesse of the yeere then past, and partly through the uncharitable greedi∣nesse of Corne-Masters, but especially through the unlawfull and over-much transporting of Graine in forreine parts; by the advice of her most Honourable Privie Councell, published a Proclamation, and a Booke of Orders to be taken by the Justices, for reliefe of the Poore: notwithstanding all which, the excessive prices of Graine still encreased; so that Wheat in Meale was sold at London for 8 shillings the Bushell, and in some other parts of this Realme above that price. An. Dom. 1594. 36. Eliz. In May sell many great showers of Raine, but in June and July much more, for it commonly rained day and night till Saint James Eve; and on S. James day in the after∣noone it began againe, and continued for two dayes together. Notwithstanding, there followed a faire Harvest. But in September, great Raines raysed high waters, such as stayed the Carriages, and bare downe Bridges, as at Cambridge, Ware, and elsewhere. Also Graine grew to be of a great price, a
Bushell of Wheat at 6, 7, or 8 shillings, &c. which Dearth happened more through the Merchants over-much transport∣ing, then the unseasonablenesse of the weather past. An. Dom. 1595. 3. Eliz. By the late Transportations of Graine into for∣reine parts, the same was here growne to an excessive price, as in some parts of this Realme, from 14 shillings to 4 Marks the Quarter, and more, as the Poore did feele; and all other things whatsoever were made to sustaine man, were likewise raysed, without all conscience and reason. For remedie where∣of, our Merchants brought back from Danske much Rye and Wheat, but passing deere; though not of the best, yet serving the turne in such extremitie. Some Prentices and other young people about the Citie of London, being pinched of their Victuals more then they had beene accustomed, tooke Butter from the Market folkes in Southwarke, paying but three pence, where the owners would not afford it under five pence by the pound. For which disorder, the said young men were punished on the 27 of June, by whipping, setting on the Pillorie, and long imprisonment. An. Dom. 1596. 37. Eliz. In August, September, October, November, fell great store of Raine, and Wheat in Meale was sold at London for 10 shillings the Bushell; yet through the diligent care∣fulnesse of Thomas Skinner, then Lord Maior, provision was made for Corne to be brought from Danske, and other the East Countreyes, by our Merchants; unto whom was granted Cu∣stome and Stowage free, as also to make their owne price, or transport to any part of this Realme. Whereupon it followed, were the price never so high, this Citie never wanted Corne for their Money. An. Dom. 1597. And 39. Eliz. the price of Wheat in London Markets fell from 13 shillings to 10 shillings the Bushell.
Since which time, how it hath risen and fallen, and what Dearths or Plenties of Corne we have had, I forbeare to re∣late, in respect the same being of so late yeeres, are still fresh in memorie with many, if not most men; and in case ought be forgotten by any, there is no Chronicle to justifie it. Now therefore, to conclude: By all these monumentall verities, or particular narrations of Chronicled Occurrences, it appeares, that the cause of a Dearth or Famine is manifold. 1 Warre, whereby both Corne and Land was wasted, as also people destroyed. 2 Unseasonable weather, extremitie of Cold and Frost or Raine, of Windes, Thunder and Lightning, Tempests, and such like. 3 The abasing of the Coine. 4 Excessive consumption and abuse of Wheat and other Victuals in voluptuous Feasts. 5 The uncharitable greedinesse, or unconscionable hoor∣ding of Corne-Masters and Farmers. 6 The Merchants over-much transporting of Graine into forreine parts. For a seventh Cause, I might here inferre, with accusation, the evill disposition of many, in racking of Rents, whereby the Tenants are moved, if not constrained, to set on their Commo∣dities an unreasonable price. Againe, on the other side, there are divers apparent causes of cheapenesse or plentie. 1 Peace, whereby men have libertie to till the ground, and reape the fruit thereof. 2 Seasonable and kindly weather, with a fruitfull Harvest. 3 Great store of fine Gold and Silver. 4 The moderate use of the Creature, and sparing Dyet, which is very little practised. 5 The Corne-Masters and Farmers charitable bountie, or conscionable exposing of their Graine to sale, which is Rara avis in terris, &c.
6 The importation of Graine from forreine parts, which hath beene divers times knowne, through the carefull meanes of the provident Magistrates within the Citie of London. For a seventh Cause, I might adde the forbearance of rac∣king Rents, whereby the Tenants (farming their grounds at easie rates) may be mooved to affoord their Graine, Kine, Cattell, and other provision at reasonable prices. But so cor∣rupt or prone to Avarice, is the heart of man in these later times, that racking of Rents will never be abandoned, and consequently, cheapenesse of Graine, or other things created for the sustenance or service of man, is not likely to be knowne by any such cause. But some perhaps will here object or alledge (according to the conceit of many) That the scarcitie of people in former times might cause the cheapenesse of Wheat, as also of all other Dyet: And the Grounds likewise that did beare and breed the same, being then rented at very low rates, not onely by reason of the want of occupiers, but of the raritie of Gold and Silver; as appeareth by many ancient Leases, where is reserved but six pence, or little more or lesse, for Land now worth or letten for six or ten pound: and that as the Countrey grew more and more populous, and Gold and Silver more plenteous; so Land and Corne, as also all other things (for the most part) became more and more deare. To which Objection, or Allegation, I answer; That who∣soever shall looke back upon the Ages past, and consider the wonderfull numbers of Souldiers which were sent forth, the exact measuring of Lands in those dayes, the spaciousnesse and capacitie of their Churches, the old Foundations, which now lye demolished, or waste, if not raked up with the Plough; will (by all probable conjecture) conceive, that this Island was then as well peopled as it is now: Albeit the Cities and Townes (especially London) doe now swarme with people, which make the greater shew of a number; the Countrey
being never more naked, and desolate, then in these dayes. And for Gold and Silver, it is most probable by the Shrines and gilding of Churches, the rich Copes and Vestmnts there∣unto belonging, the Robes and Hangings of Princes, their massie and substantiall old Plate, their Borders, Wyers, and other Ornaments of beaten Gold and Silver, their Mines found out at home, their House-keeping, Almes-deedes, and charitable Benevolences: there was no scarcitie, but rather great store of such Mettals in those dayes: the baser Coines being admitted through policie of State, which is usuall with other the most wealthie Nations. Neither does our Coine beare the weight which formerly it did: For it appeares by Stowes Chronicle (since his decease continued and set forth by How) 7. Ed. 1. 1280. as also among the Statutes of Ed. 2. that 20 pence sterling then weighed an Ounce; and 9. Ed. 3. 26 pence, and 2. H. 6. 32 pence, and 5. Ed. 4. 40 pence, and 31. H. 8. 45 pence, and 2. Eliz. 60 pence sterling weighed an Ounce: which 60 pence sterling continues the weight of an Ounce at this day. So that 100 pound heretofore, was as much as 300 pound now, besides the finenesse of their Coine, which did farre exceed ours. And certainely, the prices of all things will immediately follow the Coines, according to their weight, and the finenesse and goodnesse of the Metall, to∣gether with the fertilitie or sterilitie of the Soile, where Nature dayly decayeth. For the whole Earth in generall is growne more unapt and backwards in bearing, and yeelds not such Croppe and burthen, as in the age of our Ancestors. And hereof especially ariseth such penu∣rie amongst us in these later dayes, the prices of things being excessive, and raised above all expectation; where the Famines heretofore did not proceede from any bar∣rennesse of the Earth, but rather from Civill Warres a∣mongst our selves, making havock of Natures blessings, and poore mens labours, as in the Chronicle is at large declared.
Howbeit, there is one more Cause of Dearth and Plen∣tie, not to be over-slipt, but above all, to be considered, as well with feare on the one side, as with hope on the other, which proceedes immediately from God, being indeed miraculous (besides the Famine in Samaria, through long want of Raine, as it is written, 1 Kings, 18 Chap.) where, in the time of Famine, occasioned through the Ene∣mies obsession, or strict Siege, (when an Asses head was sold for 80 pieces of Silver, and women were forced to seed of their owne Children) the Prophet Elisha did pre∣monish the King of Samaria, that the next day a Mea∣sure of fine Flower should be sold in the Gates of Sa∣maria for a Shekel, and two Measures of Barley for a Shekel, as you may reade at large, 2 Kings, 7 Chapter. And how a Lord (on whose hand the King leaned) for his incredulitie, (as the Prophet fore-told him) lived not to eate thereof, though hee saw that miraculous abun∣dance. Also when the Children of Israel were readie to perish with hunger in the Wildernesse, God rained Bread from Heaven, and sent them Quailes, that covered the Campe. By whose Almightie goodnesse, Elias was also sa∣tisfied with Bread and Flesh, through the ministration of Angels, 1 Kings, 17. By all which Examples, and many others, (which for brevitie sake I omit) delivered unto us in that Sa∣cred Record; wee are taught, that in the extremitie of Dearth wee should not despaire, nor distrust in God; neyther in the saturitie of Sustenance, or fullnesse of Bread, be overcome with securitie, or presumption: see∣ing Hee, that is the Giver of all good things, can and will (as hee hath done) both adde and substract from our Store, at his pleasure: converting, in a moment, our Floud of VVeale into an Ebbe of VVoe; or, on the contrarie, being readie to sinke in the desolate Ocean of Adversitie, set us aboard the comfortable Pinnace of Prosperitie.
As in that most remarkable yeere, 1588. VVhen a sad expected VVarre, and pernicious Perill, suddenly was tran∣slated into a glad unexpected Peace, and Triumphant safe∣tie; which requires from our hearts perpetuall Thanks∣giving: as also may serve, not onely for a Symbole or To∣ken of Gods especiall favour, but as a warning-peece of his heavie wrath; who often threatned, and at length ruin'd that renowned Citie of Jerusalem. TO conclude, without ripping up the vices or abuses of every particular Calling or Profession, but onely saluting such as occupie, or hunt for Gaine by Graine, or the Commoditie now in question; with a short and sea∣sonable Exhortation. First, you Dearth-desiring Hoorders, whose Granaries abound with Graine, O bring it forth in time of need, to serve the Needie; but not as our Merchants bring up their Sea-coales, in small dropping quantities, as if your Store were scant, or neere exhausted, onely to rayse the price, for your owne uncharitable Lucre; lest the miserie or crie of the Poore bring downe Vengeance on your heads; whereof some amongst you have had wofull warning or ex∣perience, bringing their golden hopes to a drossie downe∣fall: Three Sermons, preached in Cornewall, and printed in Anno 1631. intituled, The Curse of Corne-hoorders, with the Blessing of seasonable Selling, being a good Lesson by you to be learned and deepely considered. Secondly, you adventurous Merchants give not your selves to give away our necessarie Graine, or other Dyet-provision, in exchange of unnecessarie Gew-gawes, for your private gaine; lest Hee, that in his love sends all to you, doe in his hate send forth prey-hunting Enemies, or with impetuous VVindes provoke your fleeting Friend,
the Sea, to deprive you of your Merchandize, and marre your Market. And lastly, you sophisticating Kneaders, that taking advantage of the last Bookes defects, observ'd no just or conscionable assise: Now let this present Patterne, and Supply, where Divine Precepts prevaile not, be unto you an effectuall Rule of Reformation; lest your pilling of the Poore be punished with most grievous Amerciaments, if not the Pillorie: Nor thinke, though you delude the care∣full Magistrate, by supplying your Shops with a few Loaves of competent Assise, while in your inward Roomes, or secretly behind, a numerous weight-wanting Batch lyes readie to be uttered in his absence, (whom in your sleeves you laught at) unlesse the same, before his com∣ming, bee sent foorth, to your confederate Customers. Thinke not (I say) that you can so evade the eyes of Him that never sleepes, and searches every where, who sees your covert falsehood (though from humane eyes conceal'd) and will detect it unawares to you, (haply by this my publike Admonition) to your Gaine-drowning losse, and overt ignominie. Nor let your Basket-bearing Servitours (as some have done, and boasted) when in their way they descrie the Troy weights, with the Right Honourable and VVorshipfull Examiners of their Carriage approaching, into their Bread, that wants of Sterling weight, convey Ster∣ling Money, lest their Knaverie being discovered, they lose both Bread and Money. Neyther you Masters of that Oven-Mysterie, let your simple VVheat be subtilly inter∣mixt with Barley, nor your sweet Corne with mustie, nor your VVheaten Dowe with stale VVhite Bread, steeped and mollified in water, which is a vile and common trick amongst you: but spend such stale Bread in your Houses, or otherwise, by way of liberall Almes, or cheaper sale, (as I acknowledge some of you have done) make your needie neighbours glad∣some partakers thereof, and generally abandon all your adulte∣rate Impostures.
So shall you, by your diligent conformitie to the good Lawes and Orders of this Realme, and your sustaining Charitie to the Indigent, gaine favour both with God and men, shew your selves obedient Subjects to your So∣veraigne, and dutifull Servants to your heavenly Master; purchase the prayse and prayers of the Poore, with a continuall Blessing on your honest labours, dealings, and proceedings; both you and yours long and happily flourishing like Cedars on Mount Lebanon, to the renowne and benefit both of this Countrey and Com∣mon-wealth.

The Composer of this Worke, being the Author of the Prime Tables of Interest-Money, and Purchase at 8 per Cent. To all those whom it may concerne, respective Greeting. BY my continuall Practice, in resolving Questi∣ons of Purchase, perceiving that all Buyers and Sellers of Land or Houses in Fee, or for yeeres, doe for the most part extremely erre and over-reach themselves in the valuing of Leases and Annuities by the Tables now extant, or at lower Rates then are therein deciphered; I have now, upon better advice, invented a new way of Computation, whereby all such Buyers and Sellers may be infallibly instructed in the premisses. And further, by dayly and long experience finding that many men have beene much damnified and abu∣sed, through ignorance, in the right course of com∣puting Interest-Money, wilfull miscompting thereof, or unwitting over-sight therein; I doe not onely professe to make or prepare Accompts for the Masters of the Chancerie, or others, but also doe undertake to examine any Accompt (by whomsoever made) upon Interest, presuming the same to be false or erroneous, venturing such my paines gratis; which free offer, I am well assured, no provident person (having occasion)
will neglect: And if any defect or error be therein, I will also rectifie the same, and justifie my Compu∣tation, praemii gratia, or for reasonable recompence. At my Chamber in Simonds Inne in Chancerie Lane, where I am now retired from my Studie or glazed Shop against the Rolls, as well for my more convenient practice and study, as for the better entertaining of Clients; and there doe sell not only this Booke, but my Tables of Interest Money and Purchase, with six other necessarie Tables, for the use of Gentlemen, Accomptants, Trades-men, and others, whereby the most experienced Arithmetician may be eased of much labour, and the Artlesse may be readily in∣structed in all the even parts of any number of Pounds, in reduction of Pence and Shillings into Pounds, or other totall summes, in proportioning Stuffe, of whatsoever bredth, to Cloth of any bredth; or on the contrarie, in reduction of Troy, Avoir-du-pois, and Venice weights; to know the price of the subtle Pound, according to the price of the Grosse hundred, and how many such Pounds are in any number of Hundreds, or on the contrarie. Be∣sides divers other Workes of mine owne. I doe also professe to translate old Manuscripts or Bookes in any kind of Latine (according to the qualitie of the subject) into English, Prose, or Verse.
