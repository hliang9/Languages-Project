By the Queene. THe Queenes most excellent Maiestie, foreseeing that in such resort and concourse of people as commonly at the repaire of great Ambassadours into this her Highnesse Realme from forreine Princes is vsually wont to be, there may some disorder fal out amongst the inferiour and meaner sort, which beside the inconueniences likely to ensue thereby, might turne greatly to the dishonour of her Maiestie, a matter whereof her louing Subiects ought to haue great regarde, especially at this time of the repaire of so honourable personages hi∣ther, as the like in such nombers hath not of long time bene sent vnto any of her predecessors from any forreine Prince or Potentate: Doeth therefore by this her Highnesse Proclamation charge and commaund that no person or persons, during the time of the continuance of the said Ambassadors & their retinue, within this her Maiesties Realme, presume, after the publication of this present Proclamation, to offer violence by drawing of any weapon, or to strike, hurt or moue qua∣tels to any person of what Nation soeuer he be, vpon paine of death to be inflicted vpon any person so of∣fending, as a prouision needefull to be at such a time excuted against manifest breakers of peace, to the dishonour of her Maiestie, and her Realme. And for her Maiestie reputeth and taketh the sending of so Honourable personages and in so great a nomber vnto her from her good brother the French King, as a singular testimony of the princely good will and affection he beareth to her, and accordingly is desi∣rous to make it appeare to the world by all the best effects and demonstrations of like good will and affection she can, how greatly she accepteth thereof, and thinketh hee selfe honoured thereby, doth further looke that her louing Subiects of all sorts, shall not onley cary themselues in that orderly and quiet sort, during the time of the abode of the said Honourable personages and Ambassadours here, as no disorder or quarell may fall out, But also that all Lords and Masters hauing company of seruants attending vpon them, will so direct their companies to obserue the peace at this time, not onely towards all stran∣gers, but also all others their owne Countrymen, her Maiesties Subiects: So as on no part by any meanes her Maiesties peace be broken during the abode of the said Ambassadours here. Whereby they shal giue a good demonstration and testimonie not onely of their loyall deuotion to her Maiestie, and the care they haue to doe her that honour, by all possible meanes they can (as in duety to them apperteyneth) but also minister vnto the said Honourable personages and strangers and their traines, a iust occasion to make good report of the good and peaceable gouernment vnder her Maiestie, and of the obedience which her Subiects doe beare her Maiestie, and also of the friendly vsage and enterteinment they haue receiued here greatly to her Maiesties honour, and the honour of the Realme. Giuen at her Maiesties Mannour of S. Iames the xviii. day of Aprill, 1581. in the three and twentieth yere of her Highnesse reigne. God saue the Queene. ❧ Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie.
