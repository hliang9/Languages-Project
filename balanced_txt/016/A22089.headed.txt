THat the Lord Maior shall now presently before Lent, or at the beginning thereof, cause all In∣holders, Keepers of ordinary Tables, Victualers, Alehouse-keepers, and Tauernors, within the Citie and Liberties thereof, to appeare before him, or such persons as hee shall appoint meete for that purpose, and shall take Bonds with sufficient Sureties of euery of them in good summes of money, viz. one hundreth pounds the Principall, and the Sureties thirtie pounds apiece, to his Maiesties vse, not to dresse any Flesh in their houses this Lent time, for any respect, nor suffer it to be eaten: The like Bonds with Sureties shall be taken of the like persons, vpon like Penalties, by the chiefe Officers of Westminster, and the Liberties therof, and euery of the said Bonds to be certified into his Maiesties Exchequer. ANd for the Butchers and others that come with victuals of flesh out of the Country to the Ci∣tie; the Lord Maior shall cause certaine persons to watch at the Gates, and other like places in the Suburbs, where flesh may bee brought in, to viewe and search, and to intercept the same: and if any of those Watchmen be found negligent, and corrupt in his charge, then hee to be commit∣ted to Prison during the whole Lent. ANd to the end the Fishermen may imploy themselues to Sea, with better intouragement then heeretofore; And that the Fishmongers may furnish themselues with such store from time to time hereafter, as shall be expedient aswell for the prouision of the Citie, as for selling the same at reasonable rates: They are hereby required to take notice of his Maiesties commande∣ment, and constant resolution for the obseruance of Lent, and Fish dayes both now and hereafter, as by Law is required. ANd forasmuch as the vse and libertie now taken, is so farre declined from the abstinence, and moderation of former times, as instead of fasting, & forbearing Suppers on Fridayes both in Lent, and other times, which heretofore was duely obserued: there is now nothing more vsu∣all, then to make speciall choise of Friday nights for Suppers & entertainment, and to marke out those dayes for ryot and excesse, to the great offence and scandal of Gouernment: For the auoyding whereof, as it is to be wished, that euery man would be a rule of order to himselfe in his own house, aswell in respect of the Publique, as of his priuate ease and commoditie: So his Maiestie both straitly charge and command all Inholders, Keepers of Ordinarie Tables, Victualers, Ale∣house-keepers, and Tauernors, not to make any Supper for any person, or persons whatsoeuer vpon Friday nights either in Lent or out of Lent, nor to suffer any Meat to be then dressed, vtte∣red, sould, or eaten in their houses, vpon such punishment, as is due to those that shall contemne his Maiesties Royall pleasure and commandement. ANd as these Orders are expressely deuised to bee executed in the Citie of London, and places neere to the same: So his Maiesties pleasure and Commandement is, that the execution of these, or like Orders be performed by the commandement of his Maiesties Iustices of Peace in all Shires within their Rule, and to all other Officers in Townes Corporate, or in any Liber∣ties, with like order for the Bonds to be taken to his Maiesties vse, & certified into the Exchequer. And that no manner of toleration, fauour or conniuencie be vsed by any Iustice of Peace, or other Officer, contrary to the true meaning of these Orders, as both they that shall presume wittingly so to tolerate the offence, as also the Partie himselfe offending, will answere the same at their vt∣termost perils. It being his Maiesties expresse pleasure, that his Lawes in this case shall bee hereafter seuerely executed vpon all offenders whatsoeuer. ¶ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie.
