TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, RIGHT VVorshipfull, and other my be∣loued Parishioners, Inhabitants of the Precinct of Black-friers LONDON, such sufficiencie of Grace as may bring them to fulnesse of Glory. IF noble Birth, high Honour, great Estate, true Piety, bountifull Charity, good Esteeme of Gods word and Ministers, and in particular, intire loue of the Au∣thor, be inducements to choose a Patron for his worke, I, for my part, need not goe farre for a Patron. In mine owne parish are all these. To you therefore (right Honourable, right Wor∣shipfull, and other my beloued Parishioners, most worthy of all due respect) doe I dedicate these my poore paines about Do∣mesticall Duties. To testifie the equall dutie which I owe, and the impartiall respect which I beare to you all, I make you all as one Patron. You were the first ouer whom I euer had any ministeriall charge. To this charge by your free choice was I called. Among you haue I spent Since Mid∣sommer. 1608. almost two full prentiships. You haue alwaies so accepted my paines, and re∣spected
my person, as I neuer had any cause to repent my ac∣ceptance of this place, and calling: but rather to thanke God for the same. My desire is (if so it may seeme good to the di∣uine prouidence) to spend all my daies among you: and, while I am among you, to helpe forward your spirituall edification. This is the maine end of my calling, and the marke, which, as in the ordinary course of my Ministry, so in the publishing of these Eight Treatises of Domesticall Duties, and dedica∣ting them to you, I haue aimed at. As in testimony of Loue and Dutie I haue preached in your hearing, and published in your name these Duties, so doe you manifest your kinde ac∣ceptance of my former, and latter paines, by a conscionable ob∣seruing of them, so farre forth as they are agreeable to Gods word: that all who know you, may know by that euident de∣monstration, how well you haue relished and approued them. Thus shall you gaine much profit, and my selfe much comfort by my paines. Oh if the head and seuerall members of a fa∣mily would be perswaded euery of them to be conscionable in performing their owne particular duties, what a sweet society, and happy harmony would there be in houses? What excel∣lent seminaries would families be to Church and Common∣wealth? . Arist. Eth. lib. 8. cap. 12. Necessary it is that good order be first set in families: for as they were before other polities, so they are somewhat the more necessary: and good members of a family are like to make good members of Church and common-wealth. The subiect matter therefore of these Treatises is worth the hand∣ling, if I were able according to the worth thereof to handle it. I haue endeuoured to doe what I could therein, though I haue not attained to what I would. Be you like vnto God, who, if there be first a willing mind, accepteth according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. Though for such a matter as is handled in these Treatises, the worke may seeme at first sight to be too copious, yet I hope the obseruant Reader
will not finde it too tedious. It is the variety of many, M . Ammon. Multum loqui est rem super∣fluis agere ver∣bis. Aug. Epist. 121. ad Prob. not the prolixity of few points which hath made this booke to swell to that bignesse which it hath. The first Treatise (which is a fourth part of the booke) containeth a Commen∣tary on that part of Scripture out of which Domesticall Du∣ties are raised: wherein the Apostle setting forth Christ and the Church as patternes to husbands and wiues, liuely decla∣reth the great loue of Christ to his Church, and the neere vni∣on betwixt them, together with other deepe mysteries, the vnfolding whereof hath a little the longer detained me. But as I haue a while insisted on maine matters of much moment, so haue I very briefly passed ouer other points. The other Trea∣tises, wherein the Duties themselues are handled, are euery of them much shorter then the first. In them I haue barely pro∣pounded and briefly proued the truth and equity of the seuerall duties, except some choice points which are of especiall vse, or at least through disuse much questioned: and them I haue more largely handled. And because contraries laid together . Arist. Rhet. lib. 3. cap. 2. doe much set forth each other in their liuely colours, I haue to euery duty annexed the contrary fault, and aberration from it. For many that heare the duties thinke all well enough, till they heare also the contrary vices, whereby in their conscien∣ces they are most conuinced. Concerning the many faults and vices of bad Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Masters and Seruants, taxed in these Treatises, let me intreat you, not to ap∣ply them too generally to all Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Chil∣dren, Masters and Seruants. Hath not wise Solomon much taxed the lightnesse, shrewishnesse, pride, flattery, and other vices of women? And shall sober, meeke, humble, honest wo∣men thinke themselues taxed thereby? By like reason might vnchaste strumpets, vntrusty gossips, vnquiet shrewes, and proud dames thinke themselues commended by those excellent commendations which be giueth of good women. Let euery
one, as their conscience (an impartiall Iudge) shall beare them witnesse, make a right application of euery thing to themselues. Thus shall we Ministers be freed from many euill surmizes. I remember that when these Domesticall Duties were first vttered out of the pulpit, much exception was taken against the application of a wiues subiection to the restraining of her from disposing the common goods of the family without, or against her husbands consent. But surely they that made those exceptions did not well thinke of the Cautions and Lamitati∣ons which were then deliuered, and are now againe expresly noted: which are, that the foresaid restraint be not extended to the Parapherna∣lia. Treat. 3. §. 21. proper goods of a wife, no nor ouerstrictly to such Ibid. goods as are set apart for the vse of the family, nor to Treat. 3. §. 22. extraordinary cases, nor alwaies to an Treat. 3. §. 19. expresse consent, nor to the Treat. 3. §. 18. consent of such husbands as are impotent, or farre and long absent. If any other war∣rantable caution shall be shewed me, I will be as willing to admit it, as any of these. Now that my meaning may not still be peruerted, I pray you, in reading the restraint of wiues power in disposing the goods of the family, euer beare in minde those Cautions. Other exceptions were made against some other particular duties of wiues. For many that can pa∣tiently enough heare their duties declared in generall termes, cannot endure to heare those generals exemplified in their par∣ticular branches. This commeth too neere to the quicke, and pierceth too deepe. But (to interpret all, according to the rule of loue, in the better part) I take the maine reason of the ma∣ny exceptions which were taken, to be this, that wiues duties (according to the Apostles method) being in the first place handled, there was taught (as must haue beene taught, except the truth should haue beene betrayed) what a wife, in the vt∣termost extent of that subiection vnder which God hath put her, is bound vnto, in case her husband will stand vpon the
vttermost of his authority: which was so taken, as if I had taught that an husband might, and ought to exact the vtter∣most, and that a wife was bound in that vttermost extent to doe all that was deliuered as dutie, whether her husband ex∣act it or no. But when I came to deliuer husbands duties, Treat. 4. §. 18. I shewed, that he ought not to exact whatsoeuer his wife was bound vnto (in case it were exacted by him) but that he ought to make her a ioynt Gouernour of the family with himselfe, and referre the ordering of many things to her discretion, and with all honourable and kinde respect to carrie himselfe towards her. In a word, I so set downe an husbands duties, as if he be wise and conscionable in obseruing them, his wife can haue no iust cause to complaine of her subiection. That which maketh a wiues yoake heauy and hard, is an husbands abuse of his au∣thority: and more pressing his wiues dutie, then performing his owne: which is directly contrary to the Ephes. 5. 33. See Treat. 1. §. 95. Apostles rule. This iust Apologie I haue beene forced to make, that I might not euer be iudged (as some haue censured me) . Athen. an hater of wo∣men. Now that in all those places where a wiues yoke may seeme most to pinch, I might giue some ease, I haue to euery head of wiues duties made a reference, in the margin ouer a∣gainst it, to the duties of husbands answerable thereunto, and noted the reference with this marke *, that it might the more readily be turned vnto. Yea I haue further parallel'd, and laid euen one against another in one view, the heads of husbands and wiues duties, as they answer each other: and in like man∣ner the contrary aberrations: with a reference made vnto the particular sections where they are handled: that so on the one side it may appeare, that if both of them be conscionable and carefull to performe their owne duty, the matrimoniall yoke will so equally lie on both their necks, as the wife will be no more pinched therewith then the husband, but that it will be like Christs spirituall yoke, light and easie: and that on the Mat. 11. 30.
other side it may be manifest that there is commonly as much failing by husbands in their duties, as by wiues in theirs. This parallel and euen-setting out of each of their duties, and of the contrary aberrations, I haue annexed next to this epistle. And further I haue added thereto a table of the seuerall heads of those points that are handled in the eight following Treatises, that by this helpe you may the more readily finde out such par∣ticular points as you desire most especially to read. To shew that the duties prescribed to Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Masters, and Seruants, are such as in conscience they are bound vnto, I haue endeuoured to shew how they are groun∣ded on the word of God, and gathered from thence. To auoid prolixity, I haue referred most of the quotations to the margin. If your leisure will serue you, you may doe well to search them out. Two things haue beene especiall helpes to me for finding out the many duties noted in these Treatises, & vices contrary thereunto: Obseruation and Disposition. Obseruation both of such duties as the Scripture commendeth and contrary vices as it condemneth: and also of such commendable virtues as I well liked in those Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Masters, and Seruants, that I came among, and such vnseeme∣ly vices as I disliked in them: and Disposition of one point after another in the best order that I could. My method and manner of proceeding brought many things to my minde, which otherwise might haue slipped by. For by method sundry and seuerall points appertaining to one matter are drawne forth, as in a chaine one linke draweth vp another. There is no better way to finde out many obseruations in a text, then by a methodicall resolution thereof. As method is an helpe to In∣uention, so also to retention. It is as the thread or wier whereon pearles are put, which keepeth them from scatte∣ring. And if a man by abundance of matter be cast into a laby∣rinth, by the helpe of method he may easily and readily finde
out the way againe. In which respects method is fitly stiled the Methodusin∣telligentiae pa∣rens est, & magistra memo∣riae. Mother of the Minde, and Mistresse of Memorie. If you well marke the order and dependance of points one vpon ano∣ther, you will finde as great an helpe in conceiuing and remem∣bring Ordo memoriae maximè, lumen affert. Cic. 2. de Orat. them, as I did in inuenting and disposing them. Because there is not one word to comprise vnder it both masters and mistresses, as fathers and mothers are comprised vnder Parents, and sonnes and daughters vnder Children, I haue according to the Scripture phrase comprised Mistresses vnder Masters: so as the duties enioyned to them belong to these, so farre as may stand with their sex. To conclude, in re∣compence of all my paines I heartily pray you all to pray hearti∣ly for him who daily praieth for you, euen Church-court in Black-Fry∣ers London. 2. Febr. 1621.

The first Treatise. AN EXPOSITION OF THAT PART OF SCRIPTVRE out of which Domesticall Duties are raised. EPHES. 5. 21. Submit your selues one to another in the feare of God. §. 1. Of the Apostles transition from generall duties to particulars. AS there are two vocations whereunto it hath pleased God to call euery one; one Generall, by vertue whereof certaine common duties which are to be perfor∣med of all men, are required, (as know∣ledge, faith, obedience, repentance, loue, mercie, iustice, truth, &c.) the other Particular, by vertue whereof certaine peculiar duties are required of seuerall persons, according to those distinct places wherein the Diuine Prouidence hath set them in Common-wealth, Church, or family; so ought Gods Ministers to be carefull in instructing
Gods people in both kindes of duties; both those which concerne their generall, and those also which concerne their particular calling. Accordingly S. Paul (who, as Num. 12. 7. Moses, was faithfull in all the house of God) after he had sufficiently instructed Gods Church in such generall duties, as belong to all Christians, of what sex, state, degree, or condition soeuer they be, proceedeth to lay downe cer∣taine particular duties, which appertaine to particular cal∣lings and conditions: among which, he maketh choise of those which God hath established in a family. With excel∣lent Art doth he passe from those generals, to these particu∣lars: laying downe a transition betwixt them, in these words, Submitting your selues one to another in the feare of God; which words haue reference both to that which go∣eth before, and also to that which followeth after. The forme and manner of setting downe this verse, with a par∣ticiple thus, submitting, sheweth that it dependeth on that which went before, and so hath reference thereunto. Againe, the word it selfe being the very same which is vsed , sub∣mitting. , submit. in the next verse following, sheweth, that this verse con∣taineth the summe of that which followeth, and so hath re∣ference thereunto, as a generall vnto particulars. This man∣ner of passing from one point to another, by a perfect tran∣sition which looketh both wayes, both to that which is past, and to that which commeth on, as it is very elegant, so is it frequent with this our Apostle. Whereby he teacheth vs, Note. so to giue heed to that which followeth, as we forget not that which is past: as we must giue diligent attention to that which remaineth, so we must well retaine that which we haue heard, and not let it slip: otherwise, if (as one naile driueth out another) one precept maketh another to be for∣gotten, it will be altogether in vaine to adde line vnto line, or precept vnto precept. §. 2. Of ioyning seruice to men with our praising of God. As this verse hath reference to that which was deliuered before, concerning our dutie to God, it teacheth vs this lesson:
It is the dutie of Christians as to set forth the praise of God, so to be seruiceable one to another. For this purpose in the Doct. Decalogue to the first table, which prescribeth that duty which we owe to God, is added the second table, which declareth the seruice that we owe one to another: and he that said, Matt. 22. 38, 39. The first and great Commandement is this, Thou shalt loue the Lord, &c. said also, The second is like to this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, &c. whereupon the Heb. 13. 15, 16. Apostle declaring what those sacrifices be wherewith God is well pleased, ioyneth these two together, to giue thankes to God, and to doe good to man. The seruice which in the feare of God we performe one to another, is an euident and reall de∣monstration of the respect we beare vnto God. Psal. 16. 2. To God our goodnesse extendeth not. Iob 22. 3. & 35. 7. He is so high aboue vs, so perfect and compleat in himselfe, that neither can we giue to him, nor he receiue of vs. But in his owne stead he hath placed our brother like to our selues; to whom, Iob 35. 8. as we may doe hurt, so by our faithfull seruice we may doe much Psal. 16. 3. good: in doing whereof God is much honoured. This discouereth their hypocrisie, who make great pre∣tence 1. Vse. A note of hy∣pocrisie. of praising God, and yet are scornfull, and disdain∣full to their brethren, and slothfull to doe any seruice to man: These mens religion is vaine. By this note did the Pro∣phets Iam. 1. 26. Isa. 58. 3 &c. Mic. 6. 6. &c. Matt. 23. 14. 1 Ioh. 4. 20. in their time, and Christ and his Apostles in their time also, discouer the hypocrisie of those among whom they liued: and so may we also in our times. For many there be, who frequently in their houses, and in the mid∣dest of the Congregation sing praise vnto God, and per∣forme other parts of Gods outward worship, but towards one another, are proud, stout, enuious, vnmercifull, vniust, slanderous, and very backward to doe any good seruice. Surely, that outward seruice which they pretend to per∣forme to God, doth not so much wipe out the spot of pro∣phanesse, as their neglect of dutie vnto man brandeth their foreheads with the stampe of hypocrisie. 2. Vse. Put not off one dutie with another. Matt. 23. 23. For our parts, let vs not vpon pretext of one dutie, though it may seeme to be the waightier, thinke to shift off another; lest that fearefull woe which Christ denounced
against the Scribes and Pharisies fall vpon our pates. As God is carefull to instruct vs how to carrie our selues both to his owne Maiestie, and also one to another, so let vs in both approue our selues to him: remembring what Christ said to the Pharisies, These ought ye to haue done, and not to leaue the other vndone. The same Lord that requireth praise to his owne Maiestie, inioyneth mutuall seruice one to ano∣ther; the neglect of this, as well as of that, sheweth too light respect of his will and pleasure: What therefore God Matth. 19. 6. hath ioyned together, let not man put asunder. §. 3. Of euery ones submitting himselfe to another. Againe, as this verse hath reference to that which fol∣loweth, it declareth the generall summe of all, which is mutually to submit our selues one to another in the feare of God. The parts hereof are two: 1. An Exhortation. 2. A Direction. In the exhortation is noted, both the dutie it selfe in this word submit, and also the parties to whom it is to be perfor∣med, one to another. Both branches of the exhortation, viz. the dutie, and the parties ioyned together, afford this doctrine, that It is a generall mutuall dutie appertaining to all Christians, 2. Doct. to submit themselues one to another: For this precept is as generall as any of the former, belonging to all sorts and de∣grees whatsoeuer: and so much doth this word one another . imply: in which extent the Apostle in another place ex∣horteth to serue one another: and againe, euery man to seeke Gal. 5. 13. 1 Cor. 10. 24. anothers wealth. Concerning inferiours, it is without question cleare, that Quest. they ought to submit themselues to their superiours: yea, concerning equals no great question can be made, but they in giuing honour must goe one before another, and so submit Rom. 12. 10. How superi∣ours ought to subiect them∣selues. themselues: but concerning superiours, iust question may be made, whether it be a dutie required of them to submit themselues to their inferiours.
To resolue this doubt, we must first distinguish betwixt Answ. subiection of reuerence, and subiection of seruice. Subiection of reuerence is that whereby one testifieth an eminencie and superioritie in them whom he reuerenceth, and that in speech, by giuing them titles of honour; or in gesture, by some kinde of obeysance; or in action, by a ready obeying of their commandement. This is proper to inferiours. Subiection of seruice is that whereby one in his place is Difference betwixt sub∣iection of Re∣uerence and Seruice. ready to doe what good he can to another. This is com∣mon to all Christians: a dutie which euen superiours owe to inferiours, according to the fore-named extent of this word one another: in which respect euen the highest gouer∣nour on earth is called a minister, for the good of such as . Rom. 13. 4. are vnder him. Secondly, we must put difference betwixt the worke it Difference betwixt the worke and manner of do∣ing it. selfe, and the manner of doing it. That worke which in it selfe is a worke of superioritie and authoritie, in the man∣ner of doing it may be a worke of submission, viz. if it be done in humilitie and meeknesse of minde. The Magistrate by ruling with meeknesse and humilitie, submitteth him∣selfe to his subiect. In this respect the Apostle exhorteth that nothing (no not the highest and greatest workes that Phil. 2. 3. can be) be done in vaine-glory, but in meeknesse. Thirdly, we must distinguish betwixt the seuerall places wherein men are: for euen they who are superiours to some, Euery one vn∣der some au∣thoritie. Matth. 8. 9. are inferiours to others: as he that said, I haue vnder me, and am vnder authoritie. The master that hath seruants vn∣der him, may be vnder the authoritie of a Magistrate. Yea, God hath so disposed euery ones seuerall place, as there is not any one, but in some respect is vnder another. The wife, though a mother of children, is vnder her husband. The husband, though head of a family, is vnder publike Magistrates. Publike Magistrates one vnder another, and all vnder the King. The King himselfe vnder God and his word deliuered by his Ambassadours, whereunto the highest are to submit themselues. And Ministers of the word, as subiects, are vnder their Kings and Gouernours.
He that saith, Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers, Rom. 13. 1. excepteth not Ministers of the word: and he that saith, obey them that haue the ouersight of you, and submit your selues, Heb. 13. 17. Difference be∣twixt Magi∣strates and Mi∣nisters autho∣ritie. excepteth not kings: only the difference is in this, that the authoritie of the king is in himselfe, and in his owne name he may command obedience to be performed to himselfe: but the authoritie of a Minister is in Christ, and in Christs name only may he require obedience to be performed to Christ. The reason why all are bound to submit themselues one Reason. Euery ones Office for the good of an∣other. to another is, because euery one is set in his place by God, not so much for himselfe, as for the good of others: where∣upon the Apostle exhorteth, that none seeke his owne, but euery man anothers wealth. Euen Gouernours are aduanced 1 Cor. 10. 24. to places of dignitie and authoritie, rather for the good of their subiects then for their owne honour. Their callings are in truth offices of seruice, yea burdens vnder which they must willingly put their shoulders, being called of God, and of which they are to giue an account concerning the good which they haue done to others: for the effecting whereof, it is needfull that they submit themselues. Let euery one therefore high and low, rich and poore, 1. Vse. Exhòrtation vnto all to doe seruice. superiour and inferiour, Magistrate and subiect, Minister and people, husband and wife, parent and childe, master and seruant, neighbours and fellowes, all of all sorts in their se∣uerall places take notice of their dutie in this point of sub∣mission, and make conscience to put it in practice: Magi∣strates, by procuring the wealth and peace of their people, as Mordecai: Ministers, by making themselues seruants Est. 10. 3. vnto their people, not seeking their owne profit, but the 1 Cor. 9. 19. & 10. 33. profit of many, that they may be saued, as Paul: Fa∣thers, by well educating their children, and taking heed that they prouoke them not to wrath, as Dauid: Husbands, Prou. 4. 3, 4. by dwelling with their wiues according to knowledge; gi∣uing honour to the wife as to the weaker vessell, as Abra∣ham: Gen. 16. 6. Masters, by doing that which is iust and equall to their seruants, as the Centurion: Euery one, by being of like Luke 7. 2. affection one towards another, and by seruing one another
in loue, according to the Apostles rule. Let this dutie of Rom. 12. 16. Gal. 5. 13. submission be first well learned, and then all other duties will better be performed. Be not high minded, nor swell one against another. 2. Vse. Dehortation from swelling one against another. Though in outward estate some may be higher than other, yet in Christ all are one whether bond or free: all members of one and the same body. Now consider the mutuall affection (as I may so speake) of the members of a naturall body one towards another: not any one of them will puffe it selfe vp, Gal. 3. 28. and rise against the other: the head which is the highest 1 Cor. 12. 27. and of greatest honour will submit it selfe to the feet in per∣forming the dutie of an head, as well as the feet to the head in performing their dutie; so all other parts. Neither is it hereby implied that they which are in place of dignitie and authoritie should forget or relinquish their place, dignitie, or authoritie, and become as inferiours vnder authoritie, no more than the head doth: for the head in submitting it selfe doth not goe vpon the ground and beare the body, as the feet; but it submitteth it selfe by directing and gouer∣ning the other parts, and that with all the humilitie, meek∣nesse, and gentlenesse that it can. So must all superiours: much more must equals and inferiours learne with hu∣militie, and meeknesse, without scorne or disdaine, to per∣forme their dutie: this is that which was before by the Apo∣stle Ephes. 4. 2. expresly mentioned, and is here againe intimated; none are exempted and priuileged from it. We know that it is vnnaturall, and vnbeseeming the head to scorne the feet, and to swell against them, but more than monstrous for one hand to scorn another: what shall we then say if the feet swel against the head? Surely such scorne and disdaine among the members, would cause not only great disturbance, but also vtter ruine to the body. And can it be otherwise in a politique body? But on the contrarie, when all of all sorts shall (as hath beene before shewed) willingly submit them∣selues one to another, the whole body, and euery member thereof will reape good thereby: yea, by this mutuall sub∣mission, as we doe good, so we shall receiue good.
§. 4. Of the feare of God. Hitherto of the exhortation. The direction followeth. In the feare of the Lord. This clause is added, to declare partly the meanes, how men may be brought to submit themselues readily one to another: and partly the manner, how they ought to submit themselues. The feare of the Lord is both the efficient cause that moueth a true Christian wil∣lingly to performe all dutie to man, and also the end where∣unto he referreth euery thing that he doth. For the better conceiuing whereof, I will briefly declare 1. What this feare of the Lord is. 2. How the Lord is the proper obiect of it. 3. What is the extent thereof. 4. Why it is so much vrged. First, feare of God is an awfull respect of the diuine Ma∣iestie. 1. What the feare of God is. The causes of it. Sometimes it ariseth from faith in the mercy and goodnesse of God: for when the heart of man hath once felt a sweet taste of Gods goodnesse, and found that in his fauour only all happinesse consisteth, it is strucken with such an inward awe and reuerence, as it would not for any thing dis∣please Two effects of a filiall feare of God. his Maiestie, but rather doe whatsoeuer it may know to be pleasing and acceptable vnto him. For these are two effects which arise from this kinde of feare of God: 1. A carefull endeuour to please God, in which respect Deum timere est nulla mala fa∣cere, & nulla bona quae faci enda sunt praete rire. Bernar. de modo benè vi∣uen. ser. 4. good king Iehosaphat hauing exhorted his Iudges to execute the iudgement of the Lord aright, addeth this clause as a motiue thereunto, Let the feare of the Lord be vpon you: implying thereby that Gods feare would make them ende∣uour to approue themselues to God. 2. A carefull auoiding of such things as offend the Maiesty of God, and grieue his spirit: in which respect the Wiseman 2 Chro. 19. 6, 7. saith, The feare of the Lord is to hate euill: and of Iob it is Prou. 8. 13. said that he fearing God departed from euill. Job. 1. 1. Sometimes againe, awe and dread of the diuine Maiestie ariseth from diffidence: For when a mans heart doubteth of Gods mercy, and expecteth nothing but vengeance, the very thought of God striketh an awe or rather dread into him, and so maketh him feare God.
From this double cause of feare, whereof one is contrary Difference be∣twixt filiall and seruile feare. to another, hath arisen that vsuall distinction of a filiall or sonne-like feare, and a seruile or slauish feare: which di∣stinction is grounded on these words of the Apostle, ye haue not receiued the spirit of bondage againe to feare (this is Bernard. loc. citat. a seruile feare) but ye haue receiued the spirit of adoption Rom. 8. 15. whereby we cry, Abba, father: this causeth a filiall feare. The filiall feare is such a feare as dutifull children beare to their fathers. But the seruile feare is such an one as bondslaues beare to their masters. A sonne feareth simply to offend or displease his father: so as Est timor ne amittatur gra∣tia beneficij. Hic timor cast us est, non eum chari∣tas eijcit, sed as∣ciscit. August. epist. 120. it is accompanied with loue. A bondslaue feareth nothing but the punishment of his of∣fence; so as it is ioyned with hatred: and such an one fea∣reth not to sinne, but to burne in hell for sinne. Faithfull Abraham like a gratious childe feared God (as Gods An∣gell beareth witnesse, Gen. 22. 12.) when he was ready rather to sacrifice his only sonne, then offend God by refusing to Qui gehennas metuit, non pec∣care metuit sed ardere. Aug. epist. 144. obey his commandement. But faithlesse Adam like a ser∣uile bondslaue feared God (as he himselfe testifieth against himselfe Gen. 3 10.) when after he had broken Gods com∣mandement, he hid himselfe from the presence of God. This slauish feare is a plaine diabolicall feare (for the deuils Jam. 2. 19. so feare as they tremble:) It maketh men wish there were no hell, no day of Iudgement, no Iudge, yea no God. This is that feare without which we must serue the Lord. In this Luke 1. 74. feare to submit ones selfe is nothing acceptable to God: It is therefore the filiall feare which is here meant. Secondly, of this feare God is the proper obiect, as by 2. How God is the proper ob∣iect of feare. this and many more testimonies of Scripture is euident, where the feare of God and of the Lord is mentioned. This feare hath so proper a relation vnto God, as the Scripture stileth God by a kinde of proprietie, with this title Feare: for where Iaakob mentioneth the feare of Isaak, he meaneth Gen. 31. 42, 53. the Lord whom Isaak feared. It is then vnlawfull to feare any but God? Quest. No: Men also may be feared, as Princes, Parents, Ma∣sters, Ans. How men are to be feared. and other superiours; For the Apostle exhorting to giue euery one their due, giueth this instance, feare, Rom. 13. 7.
to whom feare is due. But yet may God notwithstanding be said to be the proper obiect of feare, because all the feare that any way is due to any creature, is due to him in and for the Lord whose image he carrieth: so as in truth it is not so much the person of a man, as the image of God placed in him, by vertue of some authoritie or dignitie appertaining to him, which is to be feared. If there should fall out any such opposition betwixt God and man, as in fearing man our feare would be withdrawne from God, then the rule of Christ is to take place, which is this, feare not them which Matth. 10. 28. kill the body, but are not able to kill the soule: but rather feare him which is able to destroy both soule and body in hell. Thirdly, the extent of this true filiall feare of God is 3. Euery dutie to be seasoned with a feare of God. very large. No one point throughout the whole Scripture is more vrged than this feare of the Lord. It is oft added to other duties, as that whereby they are seasoned, and with∣out which they cannot well be performed: wherefore we are commanded to serue the Lord in feare, to perfect holinesse Psal. 2. 11. in the feare of God, to worke out our saluation with feare: and 2 Cor. 7. 1. the Churches are commended for walking in the feare of the Phil. 2. 12. Acts 9. 31. Lord: so likewise particular men as a Gen. 22. 12. Abram, b & 42. 18. Ioseph, c Iob 1. 1. Iob, and many other: yea the whole worship of God is oft com∣prised vnder this branch of feare: whereupon our Sauiour Christ alleaging this text, thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, Deut. 6. 13. thus expresseth it, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God. And Matth. 4. 10. againe where the Lord by his Prophet Isay saith, Their feare Isa. 29. 13. toward me is taught by the precept of men, Christ thus quo∣teth that text, In vaine doe they worship me, teaching for do∣ctrines Matth. 15. 9. the commandements of men: out of which places com∣pared together, it is euident, that vnder the feare of God, is comprised the worship of God. Yea, all that dutie which we owe to God and man is comprised vnder this title, the feare of God: for Dauid when he would in one word de∣clare the summe and substance of all that which a Minister ought to teach his people, saith, I will teach you the feare of Psal. 34. 11. the Lord. 4. Why a feare of God is so much vrged. Fourthly, The reason why the Holy Ghost so much vr∣geth the feare of God, and that in so large an extent as hath
beene shewed, I take to be this; to shew a difference be∣twixt that integritie and perfection of Gods image which was at mans creation first planted in him, and the renoua∣tion thereof while here he liueth in this world. So com∣pleat and perfect was then Gods image in man, as he nee∣ded no other motiue to prouoke him to any dutie but loue. Wherefore when the Holy Ghost would set forth that per∣fection of Gods image first planted in man, he addeth this title Loue vnto other duties, whether they concerne God or man. Concerning God, Moses exhorteth Israel to loue the Deut. 11. 13. Lord and serue him: and againe, to loue the Lord, to walke in Deut. 30. 16. his waies, to keepe his commandements, &c. Concerning man, the Apostle exhorteth to serue one another by loue: and to doe Gal. 5. 13. all things in loue. Yea, sometimes the Holy Ghost is pleased 1 Cor. 16. 14. to comprise all duties vnder loue: In which respect Christ calleth this commandement (Thou shalt loue the Lord) the Matth. 22. 38. great commandement, which compriseth all the commande∣ments of the first table vnder it: and for the second table, S. Paul saith, that loue is the fulfilling of the law. But by Adams Rom. 13. 10. fall, and the corruption which thereby infected mans na∣ture, the loue of God hath waxed cold in man, and though the Saints be created againe according to that image of God, yet while in this world they liue, that image is not so perfect as it was, the flesh remaineth in the best: in which respect God hath fast fixed this affection of feare in mans heart, and thereby both restraineth him from sinne, and also prouoketh him vnto euery good dutie. §. 5. Of the feare of God mouing vs to doe seruice to men. Hauing briefly declared the nature, obiect, extent, and vse of feare, I returne to the point in hand, viz. to shew 1. how it is here laid downe as a motiue to stirre vp men to performe the dutie here required: for by this clause, in the feare of the Lord, the Apostle implieth that It is the feare of God which moueth men conscionably to sub∣mit Doct. themselues one to another. This made 2. Sam. 23. 3. Dauid so well to rule the people of God: and Gen. 42. 18. Ioseph to deale so well with
his brethren: yea, Isa. 11. 2, 3. this is noted to be the cause of the righteous regiment of Christ himselfe. Well did that good King Iehosaphat know this, and therefore when he appoin∣ted Iudges ouer his people, as a motiue to stirre them vp to execute the iudgements of the Lord aright, he saith vnto them, Let the feare of the Lord be vpon you. So also S. Peter, 2 Chron. 19. 7. to moue subiects to honour their King, prefixeth this ex∣hortation, Feare God. 1 Pet. 2. 17. By feare of man, may one be brought to submit himselfe Obiect. to another: as a magistrate may be moued to deale iustly and mildly with his people through feare of insurrections and rebellions: subiects may by seuere lawes and tyrannie be brought to submit themselues: and so other inferiours also by threats, by hard vsage, and other by-respects. 1. Though feare of man be a motiue, yet it followeth Answ. not, that therefore feare of God should be no motiue: it may be another motiue, and a better motiue. 2. The submission which is performed through feare of Difference be∣twixt doing a thing for feare of God and feare of man. man is a forced and a slauish submission, nothing acceptable to God: but that which is performed through a true filiall feare of God, is a free, willing, ready, cheerefull, conscio∣nable submission: such a submission as will stirre vs vp to doe the best good we can thereby vnto them, to whom we submit our selues, and so is more acceptable to God, by rea∣son of the cause thereof, and more profitable vnto man, by reason of the effect and fruit thereof. For a true feare of God maketh vs more respect what Reason. The power of a feare of God. God requireth and commandeth, than what our corrupt heart desireth and suggesteth: It subdueth our vnruly pas∣sions, and bringeth them within compasse of dutie: It ma∣keth vs deny our selues and our owne desires: and though through the corruption of our nature and inborne pride we be loth to submit, yet will Gods feare bring downe that proud minde, and make vs humble and gentle. It will keepe those who are in authoritie from tyranny, crueltie, and ouer-much seueritie: and it will keepe those who are vnder subiection from dissimulation, deceit, and priuie con∣spiracies.
Behold how necessarie it is, that a true feare of the Lord Vse. The necessitie of a feare of God. be planted in mens hearts, in the hearts of Kings and all Gouernours, in the hearts of subiects and all people, whether superiours or inferiours. Where no feare of God is, there will be no good submission vnto man. Abraham Gen. 20. 11. thought that the men of Gerar would haue no respect to him or his wife, nor make conscience of common honestie, nor abstaine from innocent bloud, because he saw no feare of God in that place: and the Apostle hauing reckoned vp Rom. 3. 11, &c. many notorious effects of mans naturall corruption, con∣cludeth all with this, as the cause of all, There is no feare of God before their eyes. Wherefore let Magistrates, Parents, Masters, and all in authoritie, haue especiall care that their subiects, children, seruants, and all vnder them may be taught and brought to feare the Lord. I dare auouch it, that such inferiours which are taught to feare God, will doe bet∣ter seruiee to their superiours, than such as feare their supe∣riours only as men, and feare not God. Let Ministers espe∣cially vrge and presse vpon the consciences of men a feare of God. Let all inferiours pray that the feare of the Lord may be planted in the hearts of their superiours, that so they may liue a quiet and peaceable life in all godlinesse and honestie vnder them. Happie is that kingdome where Magistrates and subiects feare the Lord. Happie is that Church where Ministers and people feare the Lord. Hap∣pie is that family where husband and wife, parents and children, master and seruants feare the Lord. In such a Kingdome, Church, and family, will euery one, to the mu∣tuall good one of another, submit themselues one to ano∣ther. But if such as feare not God submit themselues, whe∣ther they be superiours or inferiours, it is for their owne ends and aduantages, and not for their good to whom they submit themselues. §. 6. Of limiting all dutie to man, within the compasse of the feare of God. Againe, as this clause (In the feare of the Lord) declareth the manner of submission, it sheweth, that
No submission is to be performed vnto man, but that which Doct. may stand with the feare of God. Whereby we shew that we haue respect to God, and labour aboue all to approue our selues to him. Thus Dauid is commanded to rule in the 2 Sam. 23. 3. feare of God: and other Magistrates to performe their dutie 2 Chro. 19 9. in the feare of the Lord: which Nehemiah that good Gouer∣nour Neh. 5. 15. was carefull to doe. So also subiects are to obey in the feare of the Lord, which the Apostle implieth by prefixing 1 Pet. 2. 17. this precept, Feare God, before that, Honour the King; as if he had said, so honour the King, as in and thereby you may manifest your feare of God: let not this latter crosse the for∣mer. Seruants likewise are commanded to be obedient vn∣to their Masters with this prouiso, fearing the Lord. Such Coloss. 3. 22. phrases as these, For the Lords sake, As vnto the Lord, In the 1 Pet. 2. 13. Lord, As seruants of Christ, with the like, being annexed to Eph. 5. 22. & 6. 1, 6. the duties of inferiours, doe imply as much. Great reason there is that all seruice should be limited 1. Reason. God the highest Lord. with the feare of God: for God is the highest Lord to whom all seruice primarily and principally is due: whatsoeuer seruice is due to any man, high or low, is due in and for the Lord. The Lord hath set superiours in the places of emi∣nencie, wherein they beare the image of God. The Lord also hath set inferiours in their places, and commended them as his charge to the gouernment of those who are ouer them. He that obeyeth not those who are ouer him in the feare of God, sheweth no respect of Gods image: and he who gouerneth not those who are vnder him in the feare of God, sheweth no respect of Gods charge. Besides, God is that great Iudge to whom all of all sorts, 2. Reason. God the Iudge of all. superiours and inferiours are to giue an account of their seruice. Though by our seruice we haue neuer so well ap∣proued our selues to men, yet if we haue not therein had re∣spect vnto God, and approued our selues to him, with what face may we appeare before his dreadfull iudgement seat? 1. Vse. The folly of all those who feare man more than God. Can the fauour of those whom we haue pleased in this world, protect and shelter vs from the fury of Gods dis∣pleasure? Behold the folly of such Gouernours as wholly apply
themselues to the fancie of their people, yea though it be against the Lord and his word. This was Adams folly, who Gen. 3. 6. at his wiues motion did eat of the forbidden fruit. This was Aarons folly, who to please the people, erected an Exod. 32. 1. Idoll. And this was Sauls folly, who against Gods expresse 1 Sam. 15. 21. prohibition suffered his people to take some of the spoile of the Amalekites. The like may be said of Ioash, who 2 Chro. 24 7. hearkned to his Princes to set vp Idols: and of Pilate, who Marke 15. 15. to please the people, against his conscience, deliuered Christ to be crucified. The fearefull issue of this their submission, not seasoned with a feare of God, but contrary thereunto, may be a warning to all superiours, to take heed how they seeke to please them that are vnder them, more than God who is aboue them. The issue of Adams, Aarons, Sauls, and Ioash his base submission, is noted by the Holy Ghost in their seuerall histories. Of Pilate it is recorded, that being Euscb. hist. Eccl. lib 2. cap. 7. brought into extreme necessitie, he laid violent hands vp∣on himselfe. Neither is it to be accounted folly only in superiours to submit themselues to their inferiours against the Lord, but also in inferiours to their superiours: for thereby they shew that they feare man more than God, which Christ expresly Luke 12. 4, 5. forbiddeth his friends to doe. The captaines which went 2 King. 1. 9, &c. to fetch Eliah, obeyed their king therein; but what got they thereby? was the king able to saue them from the fire which God sent downe from heauen vpon them? The wo∣men Ier. 44. 19. reproued for offering incense to the Queene of hea∣uen, did it not without their husbands, yet were they not excused thereby. The children and others in the familie Numb. 16. 32. submitted themselues to Dathan and Abiram in standing in the doore of their tents at defiance against Moses; but be∣cause it was not in the Lord, but against him, they were not exempted from the iudgement. Wherefore let all of all sorts set the feare of God as a marke before them to aime at in all their actions. Let superiours Numb. 11. 29. neither doe any thing to giue content to their inferiours: 1 Sam. 24. 8. & 26. 9. nor suffer any thing to be done for their sakes by their inferiours, which cannot stand with the feare of God. And let inferiours Gen. 39. 10. nor doe, 1 Sam. 22. 17.
Act. 4. 19. nor forbeare to doe at the will of their superiours any thing sweruing from the feare of God: but euery one submit themselues one to another in the feare of God. §. 7. Of performing the duties of particular callings. EPHES. 5. 22. Wiues submit your selues vnto your owne husbands, as vnto the Lord. FRom that generall direction concerning mutuall submis∣sion, the Apostle commeth to certaine particulars, by which he exemplifieth the same: and teacheth vs, that It is not sufficient to performe generall duties of Christianitie, Doct. vnlesse also we be conscionable in performing the particular du∣ties of our seuerall callings. A conscionable performance of those particular duties is one part of our Eph. 4. 1. walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called: and therefore the Apo∣stle, for illustration and exemplification thereof, doth rec∣kon vp sundry particulars, both in this and Col. 3. 18, &c. 1 Cor. 7. 1 Tim. 3. other Epistles: and so doe 1 Pet. 2. & 3. other Apostles. And Tit. 2. Titus is charged to teach them. God himselfe hath giuen a patterne hereof in his Law: for the maine scope of the fifth Commandement See more of this point in The whole ar∣mour of God, Treat. 2. part 1. §. 4. tendeth to instruct vs in the particular duties of our seuerall callings. Hereby much credit is brought to our profession, and the Tit. 2. 10. 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2. doctrine of God our Sauiour is adorned. And much good is hereby both mutually communicated one to ano∣ther, and receiued one from another: for our particular places and callings are those bonds whereby persons are firmely and fitly knit together, as the members of a naturall body by nerues, arteries, sinewes, veines, and the like, by which life, sense and motion is communicated from one to another. Let therefore notice be taken of the particular callings Use. wherein God hath set vs, and of the seuerall duties of those
callings, and conscience be vsed in the practise of them. He is no good Christian that is carelesse herein. A bad husband, wife, parent, childe, master, seruant, magistrate or minister, is no good Christian. §. 8. Of the lawfulnesse of priuate functions in a familie. Among other particular callings the Apostle maketh choice of those which God hath settled in priuate fa∣milies, and is accurat in reciting the seuerall and distinct orders thereof, (for a family consisteth of these three or∣ders, Husbands, Parents, Masters, all which he Wiues, Children, Seruants,   reckoneth vp) yea he is also copious, and earnest in vrging the duties which appertaine to them. Whence wee may well inferre, that The priuate vocations of a family, and functions appertaining 2 Doctr. Priuate duties of the familie well beseeme any Christian. . Arist. Polit. lib. 1 thereto, are such as Christians are called vnto by God, and in the exercising whereof, they may and must imploy some part of their time. For can we thinke that the Holy Ghost (who, as the Philosophers speake of nature, doth nothing in vaine) would so distinctly set downe these priuate duties, & so for∣cibly vrge them, if they did not well become, and neerely concerne Christians? All the places in Scripture which re∣quire family-duties, are proofs of the truth of this doctrine. The reasons of this doctrine are cleere; for the family is Reason. The familie a seminarie. a seminary of the Church and common-wealth. It is as a Bee-hive, in which is the stocke, and out of which are sent many swarmes of Bees: for in families are all sorts of people bred and brought vp: and out of families are they sent in∣to the Church and common-wealth. The first beginning of mankinde, and of his increase, was out of a family. For first did God ioyne in mariage Adam and Eue, made them husband and wife, and then gaue them children: so as hus∣band and wife, parent and childe, (which are parts of a family) were before magistrate and subiect, minister and people, which are the parts of a Common-wealth, and a Church. When by the generall deluge all publike societies were destroyed, a familie, euen the family of Noah, was
preserued, and out of it kingdomes and nations againe rai∣sed. That great people of the Iewes which could not be numbred for multitude, was raised out of the family of Abram. Yea euen to this day haue all sorts of people come from families, and so shall to the end of the world. Whence it followeth, that a conscionable performance of domesticall and houshold duties, tend to the good ordering of Church and common-wealth, as being meanes to fit and prepare men thereunto. Besides, a familie is a little Church, and a little common∣wealth, 2 Reason. A familie is a representation of Church and common∣wealth. at least a liuely representation thereof, whereby triall may be made of such as are fit for any place of autho∣ritie, or of subiection in Church or common-wealth. Or rather it is as a schoole wherein the first principles and grounds of gouernment and subiection are learned: where∣by men are fitted to greater matters in Church or common∣wealth. Wherupon the 1. Tim. 3. 5. Apostle declareth, that a Bishop that cannot rule his own house, is not fit to gouerne the Church. So we may say of inferiours that cannot be subiect in a fami∣lie; they will hardly be brought to yeeld such subiection as they ought in Church or common-wealth: instance Abso∣lom, and Adoniah, Dauids sonnes. This is to be noted for satisfaction of certaine weake 1 Vse. Priuat callings in a familie sufficient cal∣lings. consciences, who thinke that if they haue no publike cal∣ling, they haue no calling at all; and thereupon gather that all their time is spent without a calling. Which conse∣quence if it were good and sound, what comfort in spen∣ding their time should most women haue, who are not ad∣mitted to any publike function in Church or common∣wealth? or seruants, children, and others who are wholly imployed in priuate affaires of the familie? But the fore∣named doctrine sheweth the vnsoundnesse of that conse∣quence. Besides, who knoweth not that the preseruation of families tendeth to the good of Church and common-wealth? so as a conscionable performance of houshold du∣ties, in regard of the end and fruit thereof, may be accoun∣ted a publike worke. Yea, if domesticall duties be well and throughly performed, they will be euen enough to take vp
a mans whole time. If a master of a family be also an hus∣band of a wife, and a father of children, he shall finde worke enough: as by those particular duties, which we shall after∣wards shew to belong vnto masters, husbands, and parents, may easily be proued. So a wife likwise, if she also be a mo∣ther and a mistris, and faithfully endeuour to doe what by vertue of those callings she is bound to doe, shall finde enough to doe. As for children vnder the gouernment of their parents, and seruants in a familie, their whole calling is to be obedient to their parents and masters, and to doe what they command them in the Lord. Wherefore if they who haue no publike calling, be so much the more diligent in the functions of their priuate callings, they shall be as well accepted of the Lord, as if they had publike offices. Yet many therebe, who hauing no publike imployment, thinke they may spend their time as they list, either in idle∣nesse, 2 Vse. Reproofe of such as hauing no publike of∣fice, thinke themselues freed from all dutie. or in following their vaine pleasures and delights day after day, and so cast themselues out of all calling. Such are many masters of families who commit all the care of their house either to their wiues, or to some seruant, and mispend their whole time in idlenesse, riotousnesse, and voluptu∣ousnesse. Such are many mistresses, who spend their time in lying a bed, attiring themselues, and goshipping. Such are many young gentlemen liuing in their fathers houses, who partly through the too-much-indulgencie and negli∣gence of their parents, and partly through their owne headstrong affections, and rebellious will, runne without restraint whither their corrupt lusts lead them. These, and such other like to these, though by Gods prouidence they be placed in callings, in warrantable callings, and in such callings as minister vnto them matter enough of imploy∣ment, yet make themselues to be of no calling. Now what blessing can they looke for from the Lord? The Lord vseth Gods bles∣sing on men diligent in their calling. to giue his blessing to men, while they are busied in their callings. Gen. 31. 42. Iaacobs faithfull seruice to his vncle Laban mo∣ued God to blesse him. Gen. 39. 2. Iosephs faithfulnesse to his master Potiphar was had in remembrance with God, who aduan∣ced him to be ruler in Egypt. Exo. 3. 1, 2. Moses was keeping his
father in lawes sheepe when God appeared to him in the bush, and appointed him a Prince ouer his people. 1 Sam. 16. 11 Dauid was sent for from the field, where he was keeping his fa∣thers sheepe, when he was anointed to be king ouer Israel. 1 King. 19. 19. Elisha was plowing when he was anointed to be a Pro∣phet. Luk. 2. 8. The shepherds were watching their sheepe, when that gladsome tidings was brought to them, that the Saui∣our of the world was borne. Not to insist on any more parti∣culars, the promise of Gods protection is restrained to our callings: for Psal. 91. 11. the charge which God hath giuen to the Angels concerning man is, to keepe him in all his waies. As for those who haue publike offices in Church or 3. Vse. Publike cal∣lings may not hinder priuate duties. common-wealth, they may not thereupon thinke them∣selues exempted from all family-duties. These priuate duties are necessarie duties. Though a man be a magistrate or a minister, yet if he be an husband, or a father, or a master, he may not neglect his wife, children, and seruants. In∣deed they who are freed from publike functions, are bound to attend so much the more vpon the priuate duties of their families, because they haue more leisure thereunto. But none ought wholly to neglect them. Ios. 24. 15. Iosuah, who was a Captaine and Prince of his people, and very much imployed in publike affaires, yet neglected not his familie: for he professeth that he and his house would serue the Lord. It seemeth that 1 Sam. 2. 29. & 3. 13. Eli was negligent in performing the du∣tie of a father, and 1 King. 1. 6. Dauid also. But what followed there∣upon? Two of Elies sonnes proued sacrilegious, and lewd Priests. Two of Dauids sonnes proued very ill common∣wealths-men, euen plaine traitors. §. 9. Of the Apostles order in laying downe the duties of husbands and wiues in the first place. There being three especiall degrees, or orders in a fami∣lie, Why duties of man and wife first deliuered. (as we heard before) the Apostle placeth husband and wife in the first ranke, and first declareth their duties, and that not without good reason: for First, The husband and wife were the first couple that 1. Man and wife were the first couple. euer were in the world. Adam and Eue were ioyned in
mariage, and made man and wife before they had children, or seruants. So falleth it out for the most part euen to this day in erecting, or bringing together a familie: the first couple is ordinarily an husband and a wife. Secondly, most vsually the husband and his wife are the 2. Man and wife are com∣monly the chiefest in a familie. chiefest in a familie, all vnder them single persons: they go∣uernours of all the rest in the house. Therefore most meet it is, that they should first know their dutie, and learne to practise it, that so they may be an example to all the rest. If they faile in their dutie one to another, they giue occasi∣on to all the rest vnder them to be carelesse, and negligent in theirs. Let an husband be churlish to his wife, and de∣spise her, he ministreth an occasion to children and ser∣uants to contemne her likewise, and to be disobedient vnto her: yea, to be churlish and froward one to another, espe∣cially to their vnderlings. Let a wife be vntrustie and vn∣faithfull to her husband, let her filch and purloine from him, children and seruants will soone take courage, or ra∣ther boldnesse from her example priuily to steale what they can from their father, and master. Thus is their breach of Bis peccat qui exemplo peccat. dutie a double fault: one in respect of the party whom they wrong, and to whom they denie dutie: the other in respect of those to whom they giue occasion of sinning. Know therefore, O husbands and wiues, that yee, aboue Vse. all other in the familie, are most bound vnto a conscionable performance of your dutie. Greater will your condemna∣tion be, if you faile therein. Looke to it aboue the rest: and by your example draw on your children and seruants (if you haue any) to performe their duties: which surely they will more readily do, when they shall behold you as guides going before them, and making conscience of your ioynt and seuerall duties. §. 10. Of the Apostles order in setting downe inferiours duties in the first place. Wiues parti∣cular duties first laid downe, be∣cause they are inferiours. In handling the duties of the first forenamed couple, the Apostle beginneth with wiues, and layeth downe their par∣ticular duties in the first place. The reason of this order I
take to be the inferiority of the wife to her husband. I doe the rather take it so to be, because I obserue this to be his vsuall method and order, first to declare the duties of infe∣riours, and then of superiours: For in handling the duties of Eph. 6. 1. children and parents, and of Ephes. 6. 5. seruants and masters, he beginneth with the inferiours, both in this, and Col. 3. 18, 20, 22. in other Epistles; which order also 1 Pet. 3. 1. S. Peter obserueth: yea, Exod. 20. 12. the law it selfe doth in the first place, and that expresly, menti∣on the inferiours dutie, only implying the superiours to follow as a iust consequence, which is this, If the inferiour must giue honour, and by vertue thereof performe such duties as appertaine thereto, then must the superiour carrie himselfe worthy of honour, and by vertue thereof performe answerable duties. Quest. Why should inferiours duties be more fully Inferiours du∣ties first taught, be∣cause they are most back∣ward and loth to performe them. expressed, and placed in the first ranke? Answ. Surely because for the most part inferiours are most vnwilling to vndergoe the duties of their place. Who is not more ready to rule, than to be subiect? I denie not but that it is a farre more difficult and hard matter to gouerne well than to obey well. For to rule and Greater diffi∣cultie in ruling well, than in obeying. gouerne requireth more knowledge, experience, wisdome, care, watchfulnesse, diligence, and other like vertues, than to obey and be subiect. He that obeyeth hath his rule laid before him, which is the will and command of his Ducem velim qui à fronte pa∣riter, & tergo sit oculatus. Timoth. apud Plutarch. superiour in things lawfull, and not against Gods will. But the superiour who commandeth, is to consider not only what is lawfull, but also what is most fit, meet, conuenient, and euery way the best: yea also he must forecast for the time to come, and so farre as he can obserue whether that which is now for the present meet enough, may not be dangerous for the time to come, and in that respect vnmeet to be vrged. Whence it followeth, that the superiour in au∣thoritie may sinne in commanding that which the inferiour in subiection may vpon his command doe without sinne. Who can iustly charge Ioab with sinne in numbring the 2 Sam. 24. 2, &c. people, when Dauid vrged him by vertue of his autho∣ritie See Treat. 7. §. 37. so to doe? Yet did Dauid sinne in commanding it.
Without all question Saul did sin in charging the people by an oath, to eat no food the day that they pursued their ene∣mies (a time when they had most need to be refreshed with food, as Ionathans words implie) and yet did not the peo∣ple 1 Sam. 14. 24. &c. sinne in forbearing: witnesse the euent that followed on Ionathans eating, though he knew not his fathers charge. Who seeth not hereby, that it is a matter of much more difficultie to rule well, than to obey? which is yet further euident by Gods wise disposing prouidence in ordering who should gouerne, who obey. Commonly the younger Seniores & in∣ter eos optimos, & prudentes & potentes o∣portet imperare. Iuniores vero parere. Plat. de rep. lib 3. for age, the weaker for sex, the meaner for estate, the more ignorant for vnderstanding, with the like, are in places of subiection: but the elder, stronger, wealthier, wiser, and such like persons, are for the most part, or at least should be in place of authority. Woe to thee ô land (Eccl. 10. 16. saith Salomon) when thy king is a childe. And Isa. 3. 4. Isaiah denounceth it as a curse to Israel, that children shall be their Princes, and babes shall rule ouer them, and complaineth Isa. 3. 12. that women had rule ouer the people. Now to returne to the point, though it be so that gouer∣nours haue the heauiest burden laid on their shoulders, yet inferiours that are under subiection thinke their burden the heauiest, and are lothest to beare it, and most willing to cast it away. For naturally there is in euery one much Ambition is it which maketh inferiours loth to be subiect. pride and ambition, which as dust cast on the eies of their vnderstanding, putteth out the sight thereof, and so maketh them affect superiority, and authority ouer others, and to be stubborne vnder the yoke of subiection: which is the cause that in all ages, both by diuine, and also by humane lawes, penalties and punishments of diuers kinds haue beene ordained, to keepe inferiours in compasse of their dutie: and yet (such is the pride of mans heart) all will not serue. What age, what place euer was there, which hath 2. Inferiours duties first de∣liuered, to teach them how to winne their gouer∣nours fauour. not iust cause to complaine of subiects rebellion, seruants stubbornnesse, childrens disobedience, wiues presump∣tion? Not without cause therefore doth the Apostle first declare the duties of inferiours. Besides, the Apostle would hereby teach those who are
vnder authority, how to moue them that are in authority ouer them, to deale equally and kindly, not hardly and cruelly with them, namely, by endeuouring to performe their owne dutie first. For what is it that prouoketh wrath, rage, and fury in gouernours? What maketh them that haue authority, to deale roughly, and rigorously? is it not for the most part disobedience, and stoutnesse in those that are vnder gouernment? though some in authority be so proud, so sauage, and inhumane, as no honour done to them, no performance of duty can satisfie and content them, but they will (as Psal. 38. 20. Dauids enemies) reward euill for goodnesse, yet the best generall direction that can be prescribed to in∣feriours, to prouoke their gouernours to deale well with them, is, that inferiours themselues be carefull and conscio∣nable in doing their duty first. If their gouernours on earth be nothing moued therewith, yet will the highest Lord in heauen graciously accept it. Lastly, men must first learne to obey well, before they 3. By obeying, men learne to rule well. Parendo disces imperare. Arist. Polit. lib. 3. c. 3. Use. can rule well: for they who scorne to be subiect to their go∣uernours while they are vnder authority, are like to proue intolerably insolent when they are in authority. Learne all that are vnder authority, how to win your go∣uernours fauour: how to make your yoke easie, and your burden light: how to preuent many mischiefes which by reason of the power of your superiours ouer you may other∣wise fall vpon you: First doe ye your duty. There are many weighty reasons to moue gouernours Reasons why gouernours ought first to performe their duties. first to begin to doe their dutie. For, First, by vertue of their authority they beare Gods image, therefore in doing their duty they honour that image. Secondly, by reason of their place they ought to goe be∣fore such as are vnder them. Thirdly, a faithfull performance of their duty, is an espe∣ciall means to keepe their inferiours in compasse of theirs. Fourthly, their failing in duty is exemplary: it causeth others vnder them to faile in theirs, and so it is a double sin. Fiftly, their reckoning shall be the greater: for of them who haue receiued more, more shall be required.
It were therefore to be wished that superiours and inferi∣ours would striue who should beginne first, and who should Vterque suum praeoccupet offi∣cium. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. performe their owne part best, and in this kinde striue to excell, as runners in a race striue in running to out-strip one another. But if question be made who shall beginne, I aduise infe∣riours not to stand out in this strife, but to thinke the Apo∣stle Reasons why inferiours ought first to performe their duties. first inciteth them: and that it is the safest for them to begin: for in this contention inferiours are like to fare the worst, by reason of the power which superiours haue ouer them. And though it be more against our corrupt, proud, and stout nature, to be subiect and obey, yet let vs so much the more endeuour to yeeld duty in this kinde. For it is an especiall part of spirituall prudence, to obserue what our corrupt nature is most prone vnto, and wherein it most swelleth up, that therein we may most striue to beat it downe: nature is contrary to grace, and the Rom. 8. 7. wisdome of the flesh is enmitie against God. §. 11. Of the reasons why wiues duties are first taught. Quest. Why among other inferiours are wiues first brought into the schoole of Christ to learne their duty? Answ. Many good reasons may be giuen of the Apostles order euen in this point. First, of all other inferiours in a family, wiues are farre the most excellent, and therefore to be placed in the first ranke. Secondly, wiues were the first to whom subiection was inioyned: before there was childe or seruant in the world, it was said to her, thy desire shall be subiect to thine husband. Gen. 3. 16. Thirdly, wiues are the fountaine from whence all other degrees spring: and therefore ought first to be cleansed. Fourthly, this subiection is a good patterne vnto chil∣dren and seruants: and a great means to moue them to be subiect. Fiftly, I may further adde as a truth, which is too mani∣fest by experience in all places, that among all other parties of whom the Holy Ghost requireth subiection, wiues for
the most part are See Treat. 3. §. 4. most back ward in yeelding subiection to their husbands. But yee wiues that feare God, be carefull of your duty: and though it may seeme somewhat contrary to Exod. 23. 2. the common course and practise of wiues, yet follow not a multitude to doe euill. Though it be harsh to corrupt nature, Si propter De∣um viro parue∣ris, noli propone∣re quae ab eo fie∣ri deceant, sed ea quibus te le∣gislator secit ob∣noxiam diligen∣ter exequere. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. yet beat downe that corruption: yea though your husbands be backward in their duties, yet be ye forward, and striue to goe before them in yours: remembring what the Lord saith (Mat. 5. 46, 47.) If you loue them which loue you, what singular thing doe ye? Yea remembring also what the Apo∣stle saith, (1 Tim. 2. 14.) The woman was first in the trans∣gression, Gen. 3. 16. and first had her duty giuen vnto her, and 1 Cor. 11. 9. was made for the man, and not man for the woman. Thus shall ye deserue that commendation of good wiues, Prou. 31. 29. Many haue done vertuously, but ye excell them all. Hauing hitherto handled the forenamed generall instru∣ctions, I will proceed to a more distinct opening of the words; and collect such obseruations as thence arise, and then particularly declare the seuerall duties which the three orders in a family owe each to other. §. 12. Of wiues subiection. EPHES. 5. 22. Wiues submit your selues vnto your owne husbands, as vnto the Lord. THe . word by which the Apostle hath noted out the duties of wiues, is of the middle voice, and may be translated passiuely as Subditae sint. Hieron. Vet. Trans. Erasm. many haue done, or Subijcite vos. Beza. actiuely as our English doth (submit your selues) and that most fitly: for there is a double subiection. 1. A necessary subiection: which is the subiection of order. 2. A Voluntary subiection: which is the subiection of duty. The necessary subiection is that degree of inferioritie,
wherein God hath placed all inferiours, and whereby he hath subiected them to their superiours, that is, set them in a lower ranke. By vertue thereof, though inferiours seeke to exalt themselues aboue their superiours, yet are they sub∣iect unto them, their ambition doth not take away that or∣der which God hath established. A wife is in an inferiour degree, though she domineere neuer so much ouer her hus∣band. The Uoluntary subiection, is that dutifull respect which inferiours carry towards those whom God hath set ouer them: whereby they manifest a willingnesse to yeeld to that order which God hath established. Because God hath placed them vnder their superiours, they will in all duty ma∣nifest that subiection which their place requireth. Because it is a duty which is here required, the Voluntary subiection must needs be here meant: and to expresse so much, it is thus set downe, submit your selues. Though the same word be here vsed that was in the for∣mer verse, yet it is restrained to a narrower compasse, name∣ly to See §. 3. subiection of reuerence. Here learne that to necessary subiection, must voluntary sub∣iection 1. Obser. be added: that is, duty must be performed according to that order and degree wherein God hath set vs. This is to make a vertue of necessity. Vnder this phrase (submit your selues) all the duties which a wife oweth to her husband are comprised, as I shall Treat. 3. §. 2. afterwards more distinctly shew. §. 13. Of the persons to whom wiues must be subiect. In setting downe the parties to whom wiues owe sub∣iection, the Apostle noteth a particle of restraint (. owne) and that to shew that a wife ought to haue but one hus∣band, which is more plainly expressed in another place by the same phrase, let euery woman haue her owne husband: that 1 Cor. 7. 2. . See §. 82, 83. is, only one proper to her selfe: so as It is vnlawfull for a wife to haue more than one husband at once. A wife must submit her selfe only to that one, proper 2. Obser.
husband, and to no other man (as she is a wife and yeeldeth the duty of a wife) so as the subiection of adulteresses is here excluded: and the duty required is, that A wife must yeeld a chaste, faithfull, matrimoniall subiecti∣on 3. Obser. to her husband. Here by the way note the foo∣lish Adamiani ex Adam dicti, cuius imitantur in paradiso nuditatem. Nuptias auersantur. Nudi itaque mares foe∣minaeque conueniunt, &c. August. de Haeres. distinct. 31. Promiscuè inter se viri & foeminae, Veneri operam dabant. Phi∣last. collection of Adamites, Fami∣lists, and such like licentious liber∣tines, who from the generall words which the Apostle vseth (men . and women) inferre that all women are as wiues to all men, and that there needeth not any such neere coniunction of one man with one woman. Which beastly opinion as it is contrary to the current of Scripture, and to the ancient law of mariage (two shall be one flesh) so also to this clause (their owne husbands.) The Apostle, in vsing those generall words, followed the Greeke phrase, which putteth those two words (men women) for hus∣bands and wiues: so also doe other tongues, yea and our En∣glish. The particular relation, which is betwixt the per∣sons who are meant by those two words, doth plainly shew how they are to be taken, and when they are to be restrained to man and wife. To take away that ambiguity, our English hath well translated them, husband and wife. To direct and prouoke wiues vnto their duty, the Apo∣stle addeth this clause (as vnto the Lord) which is both a Rule and a Reason of wiues subiection. It directeth wiues by noting the restraint of their obedience, and the manner thereof. The restraint in that wiues ought so to obey their husbands 4. Obser. See Treat. 3. §. 51. as withall they obey the Lord; but no further: they may not be subiect in any thing to their husbands, that cannot stand with their subiection to the Lord. The manner in that wiues ought to yeeld such a kind of sub∣iection 5. Obser. See Treat. 3. §. 54. to their husbands, as may be approued of the Lord.
Thus the Apostle himselfe expoundeth this phrase, chap. 5. vers. 5, 6. It prouoketh wiues to submit themselues to their hus∣bands, by noting the place of an husband, which is, to be in the Lords stead, bearing his image, and in that respect hauing a fellowship and partnership with the Lord, so as Wiues in subiecting themselues aright to their husbands are subiect to the Lord. And on the contrary side, 6. Obser. Wiues in refusing to be subiect to their husbands, refuse to be subiect to the Lord. 7. Obser. See Treat. 3. §. 70. §. 14. How an husband is his wiues head. EPHES. 5. 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, euen as Christ is the head of the Church: and he is the Sauiour of the body. THe place of an husband intimated in the last clause of the former verse, is more plainly expressed, and fully explained in this verse. His place is expressed vnder the metaphor of an head: and amplified by his resemblance therein vnto Christ. The particle of connexion (FOR) sheweth that this verse is added as a reason: which may fitly be referred both to the duty it selfe: and to the manner of performing it. The metaphor of an head enforceth the duty. The amplification thereof by the resemblance that is made to Christ, enforceth the manner of performing the duty. A wife must submit her selfe to an husband, because he is her head: and she must doe it as to the Lord, because her husband is to her, as Christ is to the Church. The metaphor of an head declareth two points: 1. The dignitie of an husband. 2. The duty  
1. As an head is more eminent and excellent than the body, and placed aboue it, so is an husband to his wife. 2. As an head, by the vnderstanding which is in it, go∣uerneth, protecteth, preserueth, prouideth for the body, so doth the husband his wife: at least he ought so to doe: for this is his office and duty: this is here noted to shew the benefit which a wife receiueth by her husband: so as two motiues are included vnder this metaphor. The first is taken from the husbands prerogatiue, whence note that Subiection must be yeelded to such as are ouer vs. For this is a maine end of the difference betweene partie and par∣tie. Obser. To what end is the head set aboue the body, if the bo∣dy be not subiect to it? The second is taken from the benefit which a wife rea∣peth by her husbands superiority: and it sheweth that They who will not submit themselues to their superiours are Obser. See Treat. 3. §. 73. iniurious to themselues: as the body were iniurious to it selfe, if it would not be subiect to the head. §. 15. Of the resemblance of an husband to Christ. The more to enforce the forenamed reason, the Apostle addeth the resemblance that is betwixt an husband and Christ, as this note of comparison (. euen as) sheweth: whence it followeth that It is as meet for a wife to submit her selfe to her husband, as Obser. for the Church to submit it selfe to Christ. This amplificati∣on is especially added for Christians. Heathens may be mo∣ued to subiect themselues to their gouernours, by the re∣semblance taken from a naturall body. How much more ought Christians to be moued by the resemblance taken from the mysticall body of Christ? These words (and he is the Sauiour of the body) as they doe declare the office of Christ, and the benefit which the Church reapeth, so they note the end why an husband is appointed to be the head of his wife, namely that by his prouident care he may be as a sauiour to her. It is here no∣ted rather to shew the benefit which a wife reapeth by her
husband, then the dutie which he oweth: for that the Apo∣stle declareth afterwards, vers. 25, &c. The meaning then is, That as Christ was giuen to be an head of the Church which is his body, that he might protect it, and prouide all needfull things for it, and so be a Sauiour to it, euen so How an hus∣band is a Saui∣our to his wife See Treat. 3. §. 73. for that very end are husbands appointed to be the head of their wiues. Vpon this ground the Apostle inferreth the conclusion in the next verse. §. 16. Of the resemblance betwixt The Church to Christ. A wife to her husband. EPHES. 5. 24 Therefore as the Church is subiect to Christ, so let wiues be to their owne husbands in euery thing. THis conclusion setteth forth not only the dutie it selfe, but also another Reason, and another Rule to prouoke and direct wiues to performe their dutie: and that vnder the patterne of the Church. The reason may be thus framed, That which the Church doth to Christ, a wife must doe to her husband. But the Church is subiect to Christ. Therefore a wife must be subiect to her husband. The proposition is grounded on that resemblance which is betwixt the Church in relation to Christ, and a wife in relation to her husband: for an husband is that to his wife, which Christ is to the Church; therefore a wife must be so to her husband, as the Church is to Christ. The rule noteth both the Manner (. as) and also the Extent of a wiues subiection (. in euery thing.) See more of the manner and extent of a wiues obedi∣ence, Treat. 3. §. 51. & 63. Quest. Is mortall and sinfull man to be obeyed as the Lord Christ the eternall Sonne of God? Answ. This extent is to be restrained to the generalitie of the things in question. As in other places, where the
Apostle saith, all things are lawfull for me, he meaneth all 1 Cor. 10. 23. indifferent things, for of them his speech was in that place. And where againe he saith, Whatsoeuer is set before you, eat, Vers. 27. he meaneth, whatsoeuer good and wholsome meat: for of that he spake. Thus much of the maine drift of the Apostle in setting before wiues the example of Christ, to whom husbands are like in dignitie, and the example of the Church, to whom wiues ought to be like in dutie. I will further consider these examples of Christ and the Church more distinctly by themselues, without any relation to man and wife: and out of them note such generall in∣structions as concerne all Christians. §. 17. Of the relation betwixt Christ and the Church. EPHES. 5. 23, 24. 23. Christ is the head of the Church: and he is the Sa∣uiour of the body. 24. The Church is subiect vnto Christ in euery thing. BEhold here the mutuall relation betwixt Christ, the Church.   Wherein note concerning Christ, 1. His preheminence ouer the Church, (he is her head.) 2. His goodnesse to her, (he is her Sauiour.) Note also concerning the Church, 1. Her prerogatiue, (she is the body of Christ.) 2. Her dutie. In laying downe whereof there is noted, 1. Wherin it consisteth (The Church is subiect to Christ) 2. How farre it extendeth, (in euery thing.) The title Head, is giuen to Christ in two respects. 1. In regard of his Col. 1. 18. dignitie and dominion ouer the Church. 2. In regard of the Ephes. 4. 15, 16. neere vnion betwixt him and the Church.
This vnion is more fully expressed afterwards, vers. 30. The dignitie of Christ is here principally intended: so as Christ is the highest in authoritie ouer the Church: the titles Doctr. 1 Cor. 8. 6. Lord, Mat. 23. 7, 8, 9. Father, Master, Doctor, Deut. 18. 15. Prophet, Col. 1. 18. First-borne, with the like, being by a kinde of excellencie and proprietie attri∣buted to him, proue as much. The causes hereof are 1. The good pleasure of God his Father. 2. The dignitie of his person being God-Man. 3. The merit of his sacrifice whereby he hath redeemed and purchased his Church vnto himselfe. 4. The omnipotencie of his power whereby he is able to protect it. 5. The all-sufficiencie of spirit, whereby he is able to giue to euery member all needfull grace. Till the Pope of Rome can shew so good reason for this 1 Vse. title (Supreme head of the whole Church) we will account him a blasphemous vsurper thereof. Object. He is not accounted an Imperiall head as Christ is, The distincti∣on betwixt imperiall and ministeriall head discussed. but only a Ministeriall head. Answ. 1. This distinction is without all ground or warrant of Scripture. 2. It implieth plaine contradiction. For to be a ministeri∣all head, is to be an head and a minister, which is all one as an head and a member in relation to the same thing. 3. Though in these two words (Imperiall, Ministeriall) they may seeme to aduance Christ aboue the Pope, yet in their owne interpretation of these words they make the Pope equall Staplet. lib. 6. cap. 16. de prin∣cip. doct. to Christ, if not aduance him aboue Christ. For they say that Christ is an imperiall head to quicken the Church inwardly: and the Pope a ministeriall head to gouerne it outwardly. First let it be noted, how little congruitie this exposition hath with the words expounded. Doth this word (imperiall) intimate a quickning vertue? Doth this word (ministeriall) implie a gouerning power? Nay, is there not great incongruitie in this, that Christ should be the Imperiall head, and yet the Pope an head to gouerne? Besides, doth not this rend asunder two of Christs offices, and leauing one to Christ, giue another to the
Pope, and so make him equall with Christ? If the particular branches of this gouernment which is giuen by papists vnto the Pope by vertue of his headship be obserued, we shall finde that to be verified in him, which the Apostle hath foretold concerning Antichrist, that as God he sitteth in the temple of 2 Thess. 2. 4. God, shewing himselfe that he is God. For they giue to him the keyes of heauen and hell, to shut or open the one or other as In Decretal. pleaseth him: they giue him power to dispense with Gods lawes, to coine articles of faith, to make lawes to binde mens consciences directly and immediatly, to giue pardon for sinne, to free subiects from allegeance to their Soueraignes, to cano∣nize Saints, and what not? But to let these impious blasplie∣mies passe, beside that this prerogatiue of Christ (to be head of Eph. 1. 21, 22, 23 the Church) is incommunicable (for thereby the Apostle pro∣ueth Christ to be aduanced farre aboue all principalitie, and po∣wer, and might, and dominion, and every name, &c.) Christ nee∣deth not for the execution of his office therein any Vicar, or Deputie: for as head he filleth all in all things: and by his eter∣nall spirit is he in heauen, earth, and euery place where any of his members are, according to his Mat. 18. 20. & 28. 20. promises made vnto his Church. Much comfort and great confidence must this needs mini∣ster Vse. to all such as haue assurance that they are of this bodie: for hauing so mightie, so wise, so mercifull an head, an head so sufficient euery way, who can instruct, direct, guide, gouerne, protect, and helpe them in all their needs whatsoeuer, what need they feare? When we are assaulted by Satan, or any way set vpon by any of his instruments, or are in any distresse or need, let vs lift vp the eies of our faith higher then we can the eies of our bodie, and in heauen behold this our head, who is inuisible, and we cannot but receiue from thence much com∣fort, and incouragement. §. 18. Of the benefit of Christs headship. The Goodnesse of Christ is set downe in these words (and he is the Sauiour of the bodie) Euery word almost hath his emphasis. 1. The copulatiue particle (AND) sheweth that The goodnesse which Christ doth for his Church, he doth be∣cause  1. Obser. he is the head thereof.
O how happie a thing is it for the Church that it hath such an head! an head that doth not tyrannize ouer it, nor trample it vnder foot: an head that doth not pole, or peele the Church: but procureth peace and safetie to it. When Naomi sought to make a match betwixt Boaz and Ruth, that he might be her Ruth 3. 1. head, what saith she? Shall I not seeke rest for thee that it may be well with thee? It is therefore the office of an head to be a Sauiour, to procure rest and prosperitie to the bodie whose head it is. Happie were it for Kingdomes, Common-wealths, Cities, Churches, Families, wiues, and all that haue heads, if they were such heads: that, because they are heads, they would en∣deuour to be Sauiours. §. 19. Of Christ a sufficient Sauiour. In laying forth the goodnesse of Christ three things are noted. 1. The Kinde of goodnesse, which is Saluation (the Sauiour) 2. The person that performeth it (he himselfe.) 3. The parties for whom he performeth it (the body.) 1. The Greeke word translated . Sotera instrip tum vidi Syra∣cusis. hoc quan∣tum est? Ita magnum, vt Latino vno ver∣bo exprimi non possit. Is est ni∣mirum soter, qui salutem dedit. Cicer. in Ver. act 4. Sauiour is so emphaticall that other tongues can hardly finde a fit word to expresse the emphasis thereof: it being attributed to Christ, implieth that Christ is a most absolute and perfect Sauiour, he is euery way a sufficient Sauiour: Heb. 7. 25. . Mat. 1. 21. able perfectly to saue euen to the very vttermost. He saueth Soule and Body: he saueth from all manner of miserie: which is intimated by that particular from Doct. which he saueth, namely sinne: he shall saue his people from their sinnes. Sinne is the greatest, and most grieuous euill; yea, the cause of all miserie: they who are saued from it, are saued from all euill: for there is nothing hurtfull to man, but that which is caused by sinne, or poisoned by it. Before sinne seazed on man he was most happie, free from all miserie: and so shall he be after the contagion, guilt, punish∣ment, dominion, and remainder of sinne is remoued. But he that remaineth in the bondage of sinne is in a most wofull plight. In that Christ saueth from sinne, he saueth from the wrath of God, the curse of the law, the venome of all outward
crosses, the tyranie of Satan, the sting of Death, the power of the graue, the torments of hell, and what not? The puritie of Christs nature, and excellencie of his person Reason. is it that maketh him so sufficient a Sauiour: which reason the Apostle himselfe noteth: for where he saith that Christ is able to saue to the vttermost, he addeth, for proofe thereof, that he Heb. 7. 25, 26. is Holy, harmlesse, vndefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher then the heauens. Great matter of reioycing, and of confidence doth this mini∣ster Vses. Consolation. Luk. 2. 10, 11. Luk 1. 47. vnto vs. When the Angell first brought this newes, To you is borne a Sauiour, he saith, Behold I bring you good tidings of great ioy. This made the Virgin Mary say, My spirit hath re∣ioyced in God my Sauiour, and for this did Zacharias blesse God that redeemed his people, and raised vp an horne of saluation. Vers. 68, 69. When the eies of old Simeon had seene this Saluation, he de∣sired no longer to liue, but said, Lord now lettest thou thy ser∣uant Luk. 2. 29, 30. depart in peace. They who beleeue in this Sauiour will be of like minde: and as they reioyce in him, so they will trust vnto him, and say with the Apostle, we are more then conquerors through him Rom. 8. 37. that loued vs, &c. This being so, to what end serueth the supposed treasure of Refut. the Church, wherein are said to be stored vp indulgences, par∣dons, merits, workes of supererogation, and I know not what trash, to adde to the satisfaction of this Sauiour? either Christ is not a sufficient Sauiour, or these are (to speake the least) vaine. But vaine they are: & an emptie, filthie, detestable trea∣sure that is, which God will destroy with all that trust therein. §. 20. Of Christ the only Sauiour. This relatiue particle (. HEE) hath also his emphasis; for as it pointeth out Christ the head of the Church, so it restraineth this great worke to him: it may thus be translated, he himselfe: that is, he in his owne person, he by himselfe, he and none but he. So as to speak properly, Christ is the only Sauiour of men: in which respect he is Doct. called Luk. 1. 69. the horne of saluation, yea & 2. 30. Saluation it selfe: which titles are giuen to him by an excellency and propriety: and in the same respect the name Mat. 1. 21. Iesus was giuen vnto him.
Here by the way note the blas∣phemous arrogancie of those great sectaries among the Papists, who stile themselues Iesuits: assuming that name which is proper to this great office of Iesus Christ. Obiect. Why is this name more blasphemous, then the title Chri∣stians? Answ. One of their owne reli∣gion doth thus resolue that Ob∣iection: We are called Christians of Christ, not Iesuits of Iesus, because we partake of the thing signified by the name Christ, that is anointing: for (as the Apostle saith) we all re∣ceiue of his fulnesse. But he hath not communicated to vs the thing sig∣nified by the name Iesus; for it be∣longeth to him alone to saue, as saith the scripture, he shall saue his people: as if he should say, he alone, and no other. A Christo dicimur Iesuit a blas∣phemous ti∣tle. Christiani, non autem à Iesu Iesuani, seu Iesuitae: quia rem signatam no∣mine Christus, scil. vncti∣onem nobis communicauit. Nam, ut ait Apostolus, omnes nos de plenitudine eius accepimus: sed rem significatam nomine Iesus Why we may be called Christians and not Ie∣suits. non communicauit: nam saluare ipsi soli conuenit: ipse enim (vt dicitur in scriptura) saluum faciet Christus com∣mune dignita∣tis est nomen. Iesus proprium vocabulum sal∣uatoris. Hier. in Mat. 16. populum suum: ac si di∣ceret, ipse solus, & non alius. Guil. Lindwood in Prouinc. siue Constitut. Angl. lib. de Consuetud. But to returne to our matter, Saint Peter doth most plainly and fully proue the forenamed doctrine in these words spo∣ken of Iesus Christ, Act. 4. 12. There is not saluation in any other: for there is none other name vnder heauen giuen among men whereby we must be saued. None is able, Reu. 5. 4, 5. none is worthy to worke so great 1. Vse. a worke: he must doe it, or it can not be done. But Isa. 63. 3. he is so See The whole Armour of God, Treat. 1. part 1 §. 5. able, and so worthy as he can doe it of himselfe, and needeth none to assist him. What a dotage is it to trust to other Sauiours? Legions of Virum multi salutares dici possint non fa∣cile audendum est. Solus enim ipse saluator corporis est. Aug. in Ios. lib. 6. quaest. 23. Sauiours haue Papists to whom they flie in their need. All the Angels in heauen, and all, whom at any time their Popes haue canonized for Saints (which are many millions) are made Sauiours by them. Ier. 2. 12, 13. Be astonished, O ye heauens, at this: for they haue committed two euils: they haue forsaken Christ the foun∣taine of liuing waters, and hewed them out cisternes, broken ci∣sterns that can hold no water.
Let vs for our parts flie vnto this Sauiour only, and wholly 2. Vse. rely vpon him, as we desire to be saued. Thus shall we ho∣nour him by preferring him before all: yea by reiecting all but him: and thus shall we be sure to bring helpe, ease and comfort to our owne soules. §. 21. Of the Church the body of Christ. The persons who receiue any benefit by this Sauiour, are all comprised vnder this metaphor the bodie: whereby the samething is meant that was meant before by the Church. Church according to the notation of the Greeke word sig∣nifieth . Ecclesia ex vo∣catione appella∣ta est. Aug. in Epist. ad Rom. an assembly called together. It is in Scripture by a propriety attributed to them who are called to God. This calling is twofold: 1. Outward, which is common to all that make profession Mat. 20. 16. of the Gospell: in this respect it is said, many are called and few chosen. 2. Inward, which is proper to the elect, none but they, and all they in their time shall both outwardly be called by the word to a profession of Christ, and also inwardly and effectu∣ally by the spirit to beleeue in Christ, and obey his Gospell. This is stiled Heb. 3. 1. an heauenly calling, which is 1 Cor. 1. 2. proper to the Saints. These make that Church, whereof Christ is properly the head: and therefore in relation to that metaphor of an head, they are called the Bodie: and that in these respects; 1. They are vnder Christ, as a body vnder the head. 2. They receiue spirituall life and grace from Christ, as a body naturall receiueth sense, and vigour from the head. 3. Christ gouerneth them, as an head the body. 4. They are subiect to Christ, as a body to the head. §. 22. Of the extent of Christs goodnesse to all his body. This metaphor, by which the persons that reape the bene∣fit of Christs office are set forth, noteth two points. 1. All that are once incorporated into Christ shall be saued. The bodie compriseth all the parts and members vnder it: not only armes, shoulders, breast, backe, and such like: but
also hands, fingers, feet, toes, and all. Christ their head be∣ing their Sauiour, who can doubt of their saluation? 2. None but those that are incorporated into Christ shall be saued. For this priuiledge is appropriated to the bodie. The former point is clearely set forth by a resemblance, which the Apostle maketh betwixt Adam and Christ, thus: As by the offence of one, iudgement came on all men to condemna∣tion, Rom. 5. 18. euen so by the righteousnesse of one, the free gift came on all men vnto iustification of life. Here are noted two roots, one is Adam, the other is Christ: both of them haue their number of branches, to all which they conuey that which is in them, as the root conueyeth the sap that is in it, into all the branches that sprout from it. The first root, which is Adam, conueyeth sinne and death to all that come from him: and the other root, which is Christ, conueyeth grace and life to euerie one that is giuen to him: for saith he, All that the Fa∣ther Ioh. 6. 37. giueth me, shall come to me: and him that commeth to me, I will in no wise cast out: and a little after, he rendreth this rea∣son, This is the Fathers will, that of all which he hath giuen me Vers. 39. I should lose nothing, but should raise it vp againe at the last day. Obiect. Christ himselfe maketh exception of one, where he saith, none is lost but the sonne of perdition. Ioh. 17. 12. Answ. That phrase sonne of perdition, sheweth that Iudas was neuer of this body: for can we imagine that Christ is a Sauiour of a sonne of perdition? Obiect. Why is he then excepted? Answ. By reason of his office and calling he seemed to be of this body, and till he was made knowne, none could other∣wise iudge of him, in which respect Saint Peter saith, he was Act. 1. 17. numbred with vs. 2. Answ. Christ there speaketh in particular of the twelue Apostles, and to be an Apostle of Christ was in it selfe but an outward calling. This is a point of admirable comfort to such as haue assu∣rance Vse. of their incorporation into Christ, they may rest vpon the benefit of this office of Christ, that he is a Sauiour. We need not thinke of climing vp to heauen, and searching Gods records to see if our names be written in the booke of Life.
Let vs only make triall whether we be of this body or no. How we may know whe∣the we be of Christs body or no. For our helpe herein, know we that this metaphor of a body implieth two things. 1. A mysticall vnion with Christ. 2. A spirituall communion with the Saints. 1. By vertue of that vnion they who are of Christs body, 1. Eph. 4. 15, 16. Receiue grace, and life from him. 2. Ioh. 17. 6. Are guided and gouerned according to his will. 3. Joh. 17. 10 Seeke to honour him in all things they doe. 4. Gal. 3. 1. Psal. 116. 136. Are offended and grieued when he is dishonoured by others. 2. By reason of their communion with the Saints be∣ing fellow members, 1. 1 Ioh. 4. 11. They loue the brethren. 2. Mat. 25. 40. They are ready to succour such as are in distresse. 3. Eph. 4. 16. They will edifie one another. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 26. They retaine a mutuall sympathy: reioycing, and mourning one with another. §. 23. Of the restraint of the benefit of Christs headship to them only that are of his body. That none but those who are of Christs body, shall partake of the benefit of his office, is cleare by other like titles of re∣straint, as Mat. 1. 21. his people, and Ioh. 10. 15. his sheepe: but especially by denying to the world the benefit of his intercession. Ioh. 17. 9. I pray not for the world, saith he. In this respect this position (out of the Church no saluation) is without exception true: for the body is the true, Catholike, inuisible Church: he that is not a member of this Church, but is out of it, hath not Christ to be his head Ecclesia corpus Christi est: vnde mani∣festum est, eum qui non est in membris Christi Christianam salutem habere non posse. Aug. de Vnit. Ec l. c. 2. and Sauiour, whence then can he haue saluation? The former point is not more comfortable to those that haue assurance that they are members of this body, then this is terrible to those that giue too great euidence they are no members thereof; as all they doe that haue not the spirit of Christ ruling in them, but rather rebell against him: and beare no loue to the Saints, but rather hate them, and doe them all the spight they can.
§. 24. Of the Churches subiection to Christ. EPHES. 5. 24. The Church is subiect vnto Christ in euery thing. THe duty which the Church in way of thankfulnesse per∣formeth to Christ her head for this great benefit, that he is her Sauiour, is Subiection: Vnder which word is comprised all that obedience and duty, which in any kinde Christ requi∣reth of the Church, in and by the word. Quest. Is it possible for that part of the Church which is here on earth, to yeeld such obedience? Answ. It will faithfully endeuour to doe what it can: and that honest and vtmost endeuour Christ graciously accepteth for a perfect performance of all. In that it is here taken for grant, that the Church is subiect to Christ; I may, as from a generall to particular, infer that Whosoeuer is of the true Catholike Church is subiect to Christ, and yeeldeth obedience to his word. We will runne after thee, Doctr. saith the Church to Christ. My sheepe heare my voice and follow Cant. 1. 3. me, saith Christ of that flocke, which is his Church. Iohn 10. 27. For Christ conueyeth his owne spirit into his mysticall body the Church, and into every member thereof: which spi∣rit is Reason. much more operatiue, and liuely then the soule of man. If therefore mans soule quickning euery part of the naturall body, make them subiect to the head, much more will the spi∣rit of Christ bring the members of his mysticall body in subiection to himselfe. If the spirit of him that raised vp Iesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised vp Christ from the dead, Rom. 8. 11. shall also quicken your mortall bodies, by the spirit that dwelleth in you. Hereby let triall be made of particular visible Churches and of particular persons, whether they are in deed of this true Ca∣tholike Use. Triall of true Churches. Church or no. Those visible Churches which refuse to be gouerned by Christs word, and are wholly gouerned by humane traditions, which rise against Christ and play the adul∣teresses
by committing Idolatry, are not of this Catholike Church which is subiect to Christ. No more are Infidels that defie Christ, Heretiques that deny him, ignorant persons that know not his will, profane persons that despise him, word∣lings that lightly esteeme him, nor any that persecute or scorne him in his members. By this we may see that many haue a name that they are of the Church, who in deed are not. Obiect. Many such persons may belong to Gods election, and so be of that body whereof Christ is a Sauiour. Answ. Election in deed giueth them a title to Christ, but they cannot reape any benefit by that title till they haue a pos∣session of Christ by vertue of their spirituall vnion with him. Neither can they haue any assurance of their election, till they finde by the quickning vertue of the spirit, that they are vni∣ted vnto Christ. Wherefore so long as men remaine destitute of the Spirit of Christ, and are possessed with a contrary spirit, they may well be iudged for the present to be none of this bo∣dy, nor to haue any part in Christ, their future estate being re∣ferred to him who only knoweth what it shall be. §. 25. Of the extent of the Churches subiection. The extent of the Churches subiection to Christ is without any restraint at all, in every thing. For there is nothing which Christ requireth of her, but she may with a good conscience, and must in obedience yeeld unto. Iust, and pure, and perfect are all his commandements, there is no error in any of them: no mischiefe or inconuenience can follow vpon the keeping of them. This extent being here taken for grant, I may further inferre that They who are of the true Catholike Church will yeeld vniuersall Doctr. obedience to Christ: they will obey him in all and euery of his commandements. Dauid turned not aside from any thing that 1 Kings 15. 5. the Lord commanded him. Iosiah turned to the Lord with all his 2 Kings 23. 25. Luke 1. 6. heart according to all the law: and Zacharias, and Elizabeth, walked in all the commandements of God. All these were of this Church: and of their minde are all others that are of this Church. For the spirit of Christ which is in them worketh a thorow Reason.
reformation: euen as the flesh leadeth a naturall man on to eue∣ry sinne, so the spirit of Christ stirreth him vp to euery good duty. In which respect it is said, that whosoeuer is borne of God 1 John 3. 9. doth not commit sinne. Obiect. The best Saints in all ages haue transgressed in many Iam. 3. 2. things. Answ. Their sinnes though grieuous, haue not wilfully in open rebellion against Christ beene committed, but they haue slipped from them partly through their owne weaknesse, and partly through the violence of some temptation. So as that which the Apostle saith of himselfe, may be applied to all that are of the body of Christ, That which I doe I allow not: Now then Rom. 7. 15. 17. is it no more I that doe it, but the sinne that dwelleth in me. This extent is a good proofe of the truth of subiection, for Vse. Triall of in∣tegrity. herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the vpright, and the hypocrite; yea betwixt restraining and renewing grace. That restraining grace which is in many hypocrites stirreth them to doe many things which Christ commandeth, if at least they crosse not their honour, profit, ease, and the like. Herod that notorious hypocrite did many things. None that beareth the Mark. 6. 20. name of the Church, but will be subiect in somethings. But none but the vpright, who are indeed renewed by the sancti∣fying spirit of Christ, will in all things make Christs will their rule, and in euery thing hold close to it, preferring it before their pleasure, profit, preferment, or any other outward allure∣ment. They who so doe, giue good euidence that they are of the body of Christ, and may rest vpon it, that Christ is their Sauiour. §. 26. Of the summe of Husbands duties. EPHES. 5. 25. 25. Husbands loue your Wiues, euen as Christ also loued the Church, and gaue himselfe for it. FRom Wiues duties the Apostle proceedeth to presse Hus∣bands duties. And as he propounded to Wiues for a pat∣terne, the example of the Church, so to Husbands he propoun∣deth
the example of Christ: and Uers. 28, 29. addeth thereunto the pat∣terne of a mans selfe, in regard of that naturall affection which he beareth to his body. Thus he addeth patterne to patterne, Husbands du∣ties most pres∣sed. and doth the more largely and earnestly presse them, because husbands hauing a more honourable place, their failing in du∣ty is the more hainous, scandalous, and dangerous. The Apostle restraineth the duties of Husbands to their . owne Wiues, as he did the duties of Wiues to their . owne Husbands. For though the same word be not here vsed which was before, yet a word of like emphasis is vsed: and as good reason there is that our English translators should haue put in this particle (owne) in this verse, as in the 22. verse, for proofe whereof read 1 Cor. 7. 2. Where . See §. 82. these two words are vsed, and both of them translated owne. This I haue the rather noted, because many who hold that a Wife must haue but one Husband, conceit that a Husband may haue more Wiues then one: which conceit this particle (owne) wipeth away. All the duties of an Husband are comprised vn∣der this one word See the rea∣sons hereof Treat. 4. §. 2. Loue. Wherein that an Husband might be the better directed, and whereto that he might be the ra∣ther prouoked, the forenamed example of Christ, and of his loue to the Church, is very liuely set forth: first generally in these words, euen as Christ loued the Church: and then more particularly in the words following. §. 27. Of the example of Christs loue. The note of comparison (. Euen as) requireth no equality, as if it were possible for an Husband in that measure to loue his wife, as Christ loued his Church; (for as Christ in excellency and greatnesse exceedeth man, so in loue and tendernesse) But it noteth an equity, and like quality. An equitie, because there is as great reason that Husbands by vertue of their place should loue their Wiues, as that Christ by vertue of his place should loue the Church. A like quality, because the loue which Christ beareth to the Church is euery way without exception: and a loue which tur∣neth to the good and benefit of the Church. Hence note two points.
1. Husbands must come as neare as they can to Christ in louing their wiues. In which respect, because they can neuer loue so much as Christ did, they must neuer thinke they haue loued enough. 2. Though their loue in measure cannot equall Christs loue, yet in the manner thereof it must be like Christs, a preuenting, true, free, pure, exceeding, constant loue. The measure and manner of Christs loue is distinctly noted, Treat. 4. §. 61. &c. and the loue which an husband oweth his wife paralleld & applied ther∣to, which application may be also made of that Christian mutuall loue which we owe one to another. The loue of Christ to the Church is amplified, 1. By an Effect thereof, in these words, He gaue himselfe for it. 2. By the End of that effect, largely set downe, verse 26, 27. The effect is noted partly as a Confirmation of the truth of Christs loue. Declaration of the measure     The Act (he gaue) sheweth that his loue was in deed and truth: not only in shew and pretence. The Object (himselfe) sheweth that he loued his Church more then his owne life. A greater euidence of loue could not be giuen: for greater loue hath no man then this, that a man Iohn 15. 13. lay downe his life for his friend. The end of Christs loue (set forth vers. 26, 27.) is noted to shew that he so loued his Church for her good and happi∣nesse, rather then for any aduantage to himselfe. As this example of Christs loue to his Church is set before husbands: so it may and ought also to be applied to all Chri∣stians: and that in a double respect. 1. As a motiue to stirre them vp to loue both Christ him∣selfe, and also their brethren. 2. As a patterne to teach them how to loue. A motiue it is to loue Christ, because loue deserueth loue: especially such a loue, of such a person as the loue of Christ is. Yea, our loue of Christ is an euidence that we are loued of Christ, as smoake is a signe of fire. Wherefore both in thank∣fulnesse to Christ, for his loue to vs, and for assurance to our owne soules of Christs loue to vs, we ought in all things that we can to testifie our loue to Christ.
A motiue it is also to loue our brethren, because Christ being in heauen, our Psal. 16. 2. goodnesse extendeth not to him: but our brethren on earth stand in his stead, and the loue we shew to them, we shew to him; and he accepteth it as done to him: Matth. 25. 35, 40. Ye fed me, yee visited me, saith Christ to them that fed and visited his brethren. This loue also, euen the 1 Joh. 4. 20. loue of our brethren, is an euidence that we are loued of God. Wherefore & vers. 11. if Christ so loued vs, we ought also to loue one another. How the loue of Christ is a patterne, I will Treat 4 §. 61. &c. afterwards shew. §. 28. Of Christs giuing himselfe. EPHES. 5. 25. And gaue himselfe for it. THis fruit and effect of Christs loue extendeth it selfe to all Christ him∣selfe, and all that he did and suffered, are ours. the things that Christ did or suffered for our redemption: as, that he descended from heauen, tooke vpon him our nature, and became a man; that he subiected himselfe to the law, and perfectly fulfilled it; that he made himselfe subiect to many temptations of the deuill and his instruments; that he tooke vpon him our infirmities; that he became a King to gouerne vs, a Prophet to instruct vs, a Priest to make an attonement for vs: that he subiected himselfe to death, the cursed death of the crosse, and so made himselfe an oblation & sacrifice for our sins; that he was buried; that he rose againe; that he ascended into heauen, and there sitteth at Gods right hand to make interces∣sion for vs. For after that Christ had taken vpon him to be our head and Sauiour, he wholly set himselfe apart for our vse, and our benefit: so as his person, his offices, his actions, his suffe∣rings, his humiliation, his exaltation, the dignitie, the puritie, the efficacie of all is the Churches, and to her good doe they all tend. This in generall is the extent of this fruit of Christs loue, he gaue himselfe for it.
More particularly, we may note these three points: 1. The action, what he did, (he gaue.) 2. The obiect, what he gaue, (himselfe.) 3. The end, why he gaue himselfe, (for it) for the Chur∣ches good. The action hauing relation to the obiect, most especially pointeth at the death of Christ. The . Greeke word is a com∣pound word, and signifieth to giue vp. It implieth two things, 1. That Christ willingly died: the simple word (gaue) inti∣mateth so much. 2. That his death was an oblation: that is, a price of redem∣ption, or a satisfaction: the compound word (gaue vp) inti∣mateth so much. §. 29. Of the willingnesse of Christ to die. That Christ willingly died is euident by the circumstances noted about his death: when Peter counselled him to spare himselfe, and not to goe to Ierusalem (where he was to be put to death) Mat. 16. 32, 23 he called him Satan, and said, he was an offence to him: when Iudas went out to betray him, Iohn 13. 27. he said vnto him, That thou doest, doe quickly: & 18. 2. &c. Audiui, Domi∣ne, auditum tuū et expani, dum quaeris à quae∣rentibus quid quaerant, cùm noueris quod te quaerant: & dixisti te esse le∣sum Nazarenū. Cypr. de Pass. Christi. When Iudas was gone out to get companie to apprehend him, he went to the place where he was wont, so as Iudas might readily finde him; yea, he met them in the mid-way that came to take him; and he asked them whom they sought, though he knew whom they sought: and when they said, Iesus of Nazaret, he answered, I am he: When they came to him, he droue them all backward with a word of his mouth, and yet would not escape from them: Matth. 26. 53. He could haue praied to the Father to haue had more then twelue legions of Angels for his safeguard against those that appre∣hended him, but would not: & 27. 42. when by his aduersaries he was prouoked to haue come downe from the Crosse, and could haue done so, he would not. Mark. 15. 39. At the instant of giuing vp the ghost, he cried with a loud voice: which sheweth that his life was not then spent, he might haue retained it longer if he would: and thereupon the Centurion gathered that he was the Sonne of God. Iohn 2. 19. Matth. 28. 6. When he was actually dead, and laid in a graue, he rose againe. These & other like circumstances verifie
that which Christ said of himselfe, Iohn 10. 18. Indicia dedit nullase necessi∣ta e, sed obedi∣entia vrgeri ad mortem. Cypr. de coen. Dom. Reason. No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe. It was therefore no neces∣sitie that compelled him to die, but his voluntarie obedience. Christ is Acts 3. 15. . the Lord, Prince and Author of life, and hath an absolute power as ouer the life of others, so ouer his owne life. Thus then we see that his sacrifice was a voluntarie and free gift: the cause thereof was his owne will and good pleasure. Exceedingly doth this commend the loue of Christ: and as∣sureth vs that it is the more acceptable to God, who loueth a cheerefull giuer. 1. Vse. Let vs in imitation of our head, doe the things whereunto 2 Cor. 9. 7. we are called willingly and cheerefully, though they seeme ne∣uer 2. Vse. so disgracefull to the world, or grieuous to our weake flesh. §. 30. Of the kinde of Christs death, an oblation. That Christs death was an oblation, and a price of redemp∣tion, is euident by the death of those beasts which were offe∣red vp for a sacrifice, and therein were a type of Christs death. But expresly is this noted by this Apostle, where he saith, Ephes. 5. 2. Christ hath giuen himselfe for vs, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling sauour: and againe, 1 Tim. 2. 6. Christ gaue himselfe a ransome. The phrases of 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19 redeeming, Acts 20. 28. purchaesing, 2 Pet. 2. 1. buying, with the like, attributed to Christ and his bloud, doe further confirme the same. Learne hereby to consider Christs death, not as the death of Vse. a priuate man, but of a publike person, of a suertie, of a pledge, that in our roome and stead 2 Cor. 5. 21. was made sinne, and Gal. 3. 13. was made a curse to redeeme vs from our sinnes, and from the curse which by sinne was fallen vpon vs. The comfort and benefit of Christs death is lost, if this be not knowne and beleeued. In this consisteth a maine difference betwixt the death of Christ, and all other men, not the most righteous Martyrs excepted. Their death was but a dutie, and debt: no satisfactory ob∣lation, no price, no ransome, as Christs was. §. 31. Of the infinite valew of the prince of our redemption. The Obiect, or thing which Christ gaue for a ransome was himselfe, not his body alone, nor his body and soule only,
but his person consisting of his two natures, humane, and diuine. Quest. How could his diuine nature be giuen vp? could it How the per∣son of Christ being God∣man, was gi∣uen for vs. suffer? could it die? Answ. 1. The Deitie simply considered in and by it selfe, could not die: but that person which was God, both could and did die. For the Sonne of God assuming an humane na∣ture into the vnity of his diuine nature, and vniting them to∣gether . Symbol. Calced. without confusion, alteration, distraction, separation, in one person, that which is done by one nature is done by the person, and in that respect the Scripture oft attributeth it to the other nature: as where it is said, 1 Cor. 2. 8. They crucified the Lord of glorie: and Act. 20. 28. God purchased the Churchwith his owne bloud. 2. Though the diuine nature of Christ suffered not, yet did it support the humane nature, and adde dignity, worth and efficacie to the sufferings of that nature. 3. Christs diuine nature had proper and peculiar workes in the worke of redemption, as to sanctifie his humane na∣ture, to take away our sinnes, to reconcile vs to God, and the like. Thus then in three respects the whole person of Christ was giuen vnto vs. 1. In regard of the inseparable vnion of both natures. 2. In regard of the assistance of the Deity in those things which the humane nature of Christ did. 3. In regard of some proper actions appertaining to the Deity. Doctr. In that the person of Christ God-Man was giuen vp, I ga∣ther that 1 Pet. 1. 19. Vses. The price of our Redemption is of infinite value. Nor Christ, Quanta se fi∣ducia spes cre∣dentium con∣solatur consi∣derans quantus quanta pro nondum cre∣dentibus passus sit? Aug. de Doctr. Chr. l. 1. c. 15. nor God himselfe could giue a greater. Heauen and earth and all things in them are not of like worth. Well therefore might Saint Peter call it pretious bloud: and prefer it before siluer, gold, and all other things of price. 1. What place can be left for despaire in those that know and beleeue the worth of this ransome? 2. What can be held too deare for him, that notwithstan∣ding the infinite excellency of his person gaue himselfe for vs?
can goods, can friends, can children, can liberty, can life, can any thing else? 3. What iust cause haue we to giue vp our selues a liuing sa∣crifice, Rom. 12. 1. holy and acceptable to him that gaue himselfe for vs? 4. How vngratefull, how vnworthy of Christ are they, that for his sake will not forsake their vnstable honours, fading wealth, vaine pleasures, garish attire, and such like trash? §. 32. Of Christs seeking the good of the Church. The End why Christ gaue himselfe was, for the Church: so Doctr. as Christ in his death aimed at our good. 2 Cor. 5. 21. He was made sinne for vs, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him: Gal. 3. 13. he was made a curse for vs, and hath redeemed vs from the curse of the Law: Gal. 1. 4. he gaue himselfe for our sinnes, that he might deliuer vs: Ioh. 10. 15. he laid downe his life for the sheepe. This proues Christs giuing of himselfe to be a fruit of his loue: for 1. Cor. 13. 5. 1. Vse. Loue seeketh not her owne. Learne we hereby to apply all that Christ did to our selues. If for vs he gaue himself, he, and See §. 28. 2. Vse. all appertaining to him is ours. Learne we also hereby how to manifest loue: namely by see∣king, and procuring the good of others. Let no man seeke his 1 Cor. 10. 24. owne, but euery man anothers wealth. If this were practised, would there be such oppressing, such vndermining, such de∣ceiuing, such wronging of one another as there is? Too truly is the Apostles complaint verified in our daies, All seeke their Phil. 2. 21. owne. But let that minde be in vs which was in Christ Iesus, and thus manifest our loue, as we desire to partake of this fruit of Christs loue. From hence by iust consequence it followeth that Christ me∣rited Christ meri∣ted not for himselfe. not for himselfe. Was there any need that Christ should come downe from heauen on earth, to purchase any thing for himselfe? When he was going out of the world, thus he prai∣ed, Now, O Father, glorifie thou me with the glorie which I had Ioh. 17. 5. with thee before the world was. Did Christ by any thing which he did on earth merit that glorie which he had before the world was? All the exaltation whereunto he was aduanced euen in his human nature, was due to the dignity of his person. 1. Obiect. He endured the crosse, for the ioy which was set Heb. 12. 2. before him.
Answ. He vsed that ioy which of right was due to him as an helpe to support him in the weaknesse of his humane na∣ture, not as a recompence which he should deserue. 2. Obiect. He became obedient to the death of the Crosse, Phil. 2. 9. . WHEREFORE God also hath highly exalted him. Answ. That particle (wherefore) doth not declare the cause, but the order of his exaltation: nothing a consequence that followed after his death. After he had humbled himselfe so low, he was most highly aduanced. 3. Obiect. Christ being man was bound to the Law: and therefore for himselfe he ought to fulfill it. Answ. If he had beene meere man, that were true. But he vniting his humane nature vnto his diuine, and making of both one person, which person was God as well as man, he was bound to nothing further then it pleased him voluntarily to subiect himselfe vnto for our sakes. 2. If Christ were bound to the Law, of dutie he must haue fulfilled it: and if of dutie he was to fulfill it, how could he thereby merit so high a degree of honour as he is aduan∣ced vnto? This conceit of Christs meriting for himselfe, doth much extenuate the glorie of Christs grace and goodnesse in giuing himselfe. §. 33. Of the particular ends, why Christ gaue himselfe, and of the condition of the Church before Christ tooke her. EPHES. 5. 26. That he might sanctifie it, and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. THe generall End of Christs giuing himselfe being before intimated in this phrase (for vs) is in this and the next verse particularly exemplified: and that in two branches. One respecteth the estate of the Church in this world, v. 26. The other respecteth her estate in the world to come, v. 27. The latter of these two is the most principall.
The former is subordinate to the latter, an end for the ac∣complishing of the other end, for the Church is here made pure, that hereafter it may be made glorious. In laying downe the former he noteth 1. The end whereat Christ aimed. 2. The meanes, wherby he effected that which he aimed at. That end is set forth in these words, that he might sanctifie it, . See §. 39. hauing cleansed it (thus may they word for word be tran∣slated) so as that which for order of words is in the latter place, for order of matter is in the first place. The word (cleansing) pointeth out our instification. The word (sanctifying) expresseth our sanctification. The meanes of effecting these, are two. 1. Baptisme comprised vnder this phrase, washing of water. 2. The word. The two branches of the former end, namely Cleansing and Sanctifying doe in generall imply two things. 1. The Condition of the Church in it selfe. 2. The Alteration thereof by Christ. The condition is presupposed, which is, that she was im∣pure, polluted, in the common estate of corrupt man. Things in themselues pure, are not cleansed, but things foule and im∣pure: persons of themselues freed, and exempted from a com∣mon misery, need not anothers helpe to free and exempt them. Seeing then that the Church stood in need to be clean∣sed, and sanctified, surely The Church in herselfe was, as the world, polluted. Very liuely is Doctr. this set forth by the Prophet Ezekiel vnder the similitude of a The Church in her selfe polluted. wretched infant borne of a cursed parentage, whose nauell was not cut, who was not washed, salted, nor swadled, but cast out in the open field, polluted with bloud. Oft doth the Apostle, setting forth Ezek. 16. 3. &c. the wretched estate of the world, note of the true members Eph. 2. 3. of the Church, that Tit. 3. 3. we our selues also were such. 1 Cor. 6. 11. The Church consisteth of none other then of such as came out of Adams loines. Now as all the brood which commeth from vipers, adders, toads, spiders, and other like venomous dams, are infected with poison, so all the sonnes of Adam are polluted with sinne. That which is borne of the flesh (as is euery
mothers childe, not the members of the Church excepted: for they haue fathers and mothers of their flesh) is flesh; that is, polluted and corrupt. Therefore when we are taken into the Church, we are borne againe. Ioh. 3. 3, 5. This our former estate by nature is oft and se∣riously Our naturall condition oft to be thought of. to be thought of, and that in respect of Christ. Our selues.   Others.   1. In regard of Christ, the more to magnifie his loue. Our former estate, before he cast the wings of his mercy vpon vs, sheweth our vnworthinesse, our vilenesse, and wretchednesse, and in that respect it openeth our heart and mouth to thinke and say, Psal. 8. 1, 4. O Lord our Lord, what is man that thou art mindfull of him, and the sonne of man that thou visitest him! Ioh. 14. 22. Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thy selfe vnto vs, and not vnto the world! The right knowledge of our former estate, and a due consideration thereof, maketh vs ascribe all the glory of our present dignity, and happinesse, to Christ that altered our estate, as Saint Paul, 1 Tim. 1. 12. &c. I thanke Christ Iesus our Lord who hath enabled mee, who was before a blasphemer, &c. yea it ma∣keth vs the more to prize and esteeme the present estate, as 2 Sam. 7. 18, &c. Dauid. 2. In regard of our selues this is to be thought of, to hum∣ble vs, and to keepe vs from insolent boasting in those priui∣ledges whereof through Christ we are made partakers. To this purpose doth the Apostle thus presse this point, Who ma∣keth 1 Cor. 4. 7. thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou diddest not receiue? Now if thou diddest receiue it, why doest thou glory as if thou hadst not receiued it? When a man is exalted from a meane, to a great place, and thereupon waxeth proud and insolent, we say, he hath forgotten from whence he came. So as remembrance of our former condition is a meanes to pre∣serue humility, and to suppresse insolencie. 3. In regard of others it is to be thought of, to moue vs the more to commiserate their wofull estate, who yet remaine as we once were; to conceiue hope that their estate may be altered as well as ours was; to pray and vse what meanes we can that it may be altered. To prouoke Christians to shew all meekenesse to them which were without, the Apostle
renders this reason, for we our selues also in times past were foo∣lish, Tit. 3 3, &c. &c.. read how forcibly this is vrged, Rom. 11. 18, 19, &c. §. 34. Of Christs preuenting Grace. In setting downe the alteration of the forenamed conditi∣on note 1. The manner of laying it forth. 2. The matter or substance thereof. The manner is implied in this coniunction . THAT (That he might sanctifie it) Christ loued the Church, and gaue him∣selfe for it, not because it was sanctified, but that he might san∣ctifie it: so as The Grace which Christ sheweth to the Church, is a preuen∣ting Doct. Grace. Sanctification is no cause, but an effect of Christs Ipse nos gratis saluos fecit, ipse nos non eum quaerentes quaesiuit, in∣uenit, &c. Aug. in Psal. 78. loue: and followeth in order after his loue. His loue arose only and wholly from himselfe: in the parties loued, there was nothing but matter of hatred before they were loued. Moses thus saith of the loue of God to Israel, The Lord did not set his loue vpon you because yee were more in number, but be∣cause the Lord loued you. This at first sight may seeme to be (as Non est inue∣nire Domino sed praeuenire. Bern. serm. 78. in Cant. we say) Idem per idem. a womans reason, that the Lord should set his loue on them because he loued them, but it being duly obserued, we shall finde excellently set forth the ground of Gods loue to rest altogether in himselfe, and in his owne good pleasure. Deut. 7. 7, 8. Yea this being noted as the end of Christs loue, that he might sanctifie it, it further sheweth that it was not any foresight of holinesse in the Church that moued him to loue it: first he loued it, and then sought how to make it amiable, and worthy to be loued. Herein differeth Christs loue from the loue of all men to∣wards Difference betwixt Christs loue and Mans. Est. 2 12, &c. their spouses: for they must see something in them, to moue them to loue. When Ahash-verosh was to choose a wife, the maidens out of whom he was to take one, were first purified, and then he tooke her in whom he most delighted: But Christ first loueth his spouse, and then sanctifieth it. Be∣fore he loued it, he saw nothing in it why he should preferre it before the world. Seeing of him, and through him, and to him is all the beauty Vse.
and dignitie of the Church, the glorie be to him for euer, Rom. 11. 36. Amen. §. 35. Of Christs seeking to make his Church pure. The Matter or substance of that subordinate end which Christ aimed at in giuing himselfe for the Church, is in these words (that he might sanctifie it hauing cleansed it) which in ge∣nerall shew that Christ seeketh the purity of his Church. For this end hath he Doctr. shed his owne most pure and pretious bloud (for 1 Ioh. 1. 7. his bloud cleanseth vs from all sinne) and conueyed his holy Spirit into his body the Church, which is called the Rom. 1. 4. Spirit of Sanctification, because it reneweth and sanctifieth those in whom it is. This Christ aimeth at, that he might make his spouse like to Reason. himselfe, pure, as he is pure. That end which Christ aimed at, we that professe our selues 1 Vse. Exhortation. 1 Ioh. 3. 3. to be of this Church, must endeuour after: for euery man that hath this hope in him purgeth himselfe as he is pure. Let vs there∣fore vse all good meanes to cleanse our selues from all filthi∣nesse of flesh, and spirit. This being the end which Christ aimeth at for the good 2 Vse. Triall. of his Church to cleanse it, they who finde themselues clean∣sed haue a good euidence that they are of this Church: they who are not cleansed can haue no assurance thereof. How vnworthy are they of this benefit, that liue as the 3 Vse. Reproofe. world, and like swine vpon euery occasion wallow in the mire, being drawne by euery temptation into sinne? Doe they not, as much as in them lieth, make the death of Christ to be in vaine, and peruert that maine end, which Christ aimed at in giuing himselfe? But what may be thought of such as Ismael-like mocke and scoffe at those that labour to be cleansed? §. 36. Of the Churches Iustification. The two particular parts of the forenamed end, which are Cleansing, and sanctifying, doe more distinctly set forth the puritie of the Church euen in this world. Cleansing hath re∣lation to the bloud of Christ, and so pointeth out our Iusti∣fication.
Sanctifying hath relation to the Spirit of Christ, which worketh our Sanctification. From this cleansing of the Church here meant, I gather, that No sinne lieth vpon the Church: for the bloud of Christ pur∣geth Doctr. from all sinne. This is to be taken of the guilt of sin, which 1 Ioh. 1. 7. by Christs death is cleane taken away: so as that sinne which is in vs, is as not in vs, because it is not imputed vnto vs. Behold here the blessed estate of the Church, for, Blessed is Vse. he whose transgression is forgiuen, whose sinne is couered. Blessed Psal. 32. 1, 2. is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth not sinne. §. 37. Of the Churches Sanctification. From the sanctifying of the Church here mentioned, I further gather, that The Church is made holy and righteous: This is here meant of Doctr. that inherent righteousnesse which the Spirit of Christ wor∣keth in all the members of his body. In which respect they are called Saints: so as not only the guilt of sinne is taken away, 1 Cor. 1. 2. but also the very body of sinne is so destroied in them, as it can Rom. 6. 6. no more raigne in them, nor they obey it in the lusts thereof: but in stead of the dominion of sinne the spirit of Christ raig∣neth in them, and leadeth them vnto all righteousnesse. Behold here the free estate of the Church: whereas the Vse. world lieth vnder the slauerie of sinne, and tyrannie of Satan, the Church is made free from sinne, and a seruant of righteousnesse: Rom. 6. 18, 11. dead to sinne, and aliue to God in Iesus Christ. §. 38. Of the Churches purity before God and Man. From the Connexion of these two benefits of Christs death, Iustification and Sanctification together, we see that The Church is both spotlesse before God and blamelesse before men. The bloud of Christ so cleanfeth her as in Gods sight she hath no spot of sinne: and the spirit of Christ so sanctifieth her, as her righteousnesse shineth before men: for the Grace of God Tit. 2. 11, 12. teacheth her to denie vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. In this re∣spect the Church is said to be all glorious within, and her Psal. 45. 13. clothing also to be of wrought gold. And Zacharias and Eliza∣bet, Luk. 1. 6. members of this Church, are said to be righteous before God, and blamelesse, namely before men. There is no such
purity in any, as in the Church. For true and perfect beau∣tie Vera & perfe∣cta pulcl. ritudo in nullo homi∣num est nisi in corpore Christi quod interpre∣tatur Ecclesia. Hier. in Ezech. 27. is onely in the body of Christ, which is the Church, whereof it is said, Thou art all faire, and there is no spot in thee, Cant. 4. 7. 1. Quest. Is it possible that neither God nor man should espie any fault in those that are of the true Church, while here they liue in this world? Answ. Seeing the flesh remaineth in the best while they re∣maine Sinne is in the best. in the world, it is not possible but that both God and man must needs espie many blemishes in the best. All things are Heb. 4. 13. naked and opened to the eyes of God: if therefore any remnant of sinne be in the Saints (as there are exceeding many in euerie one; so as if we say that we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues, 1 Job. 1. 8. and the truth is not in vs) it is without question manifest in his sight. Yea such is the imperfection and weaknesse of the best Saints, as the flesh continually lusting in them against the Spi∣rit, oft times preuaileth, and so sheweth it selfe in some euill fruit or other, as the eye of man espieth it: instance the exam∣ples of the best that euer liued in any age. 2. Quest. How then are they spotlesse before God, and How the Saints are spotlesse be∣fore God. blamelesse before men? Answ. 1. God so fully dischargeth and acquitteth the Church of all her sinnes, as she is in his account as if she had no specke of sinne at all. Dauid in this respect vseth the meta∣phor of couering sinne, and explaineth his meaning by these two Psal 32. 1, 2. phrases, forgiuing, not imputing sinne. 2. The course of a mans life, not this or that particular How the Saints are blamelesse be∣fore men. Vna hirundo non facit ver. action, is it which maketh a man blame-worthie, or blamelesse: as the flocke of swallowes, and not one here, or another there, is it which sheweth the Spring. Now because the constant car∣riage of those who are of the Church is before men blamelesse, they may iustly be so accounted, notwithstanding some parti∣cular things blame-worthie doe sometimes passe from them. Behold here how the true Saints may boldly lift vp their faces before God and man. The soundnesse of their faith causeth confidence before God. The testimonie of their conscience causeth courage before men. Let all that desire this boldnesse, ioyne a sound faith and a good conscience together, and
labour for assurance both of their cleansing by the bloud of Christ, and sanctifying by the Spirit of Christ. §. 39. Of the order and dependance of iustification and sancti∣fication one vpon another. The order and manner of knitting these two benefits toge∣ther is worthie to be noted. The letter setteth sanctification in the first place: but the sense presupposeth iustification: for thus he saith, that he might sanctifie it, . hauing cleansed it. Be∣cause the cleansing here spoken of is an inward inuisible worke, and the euidence thereof is sanctification, which is an outward and sensible worke, therefore this is first expres∣sed, and then that inferred, as a matter necessarily to be presup∣posed. Hence arise these Doctrines. Our English with this particle (hauing) doth fitly and properly expound the Greeke actiue partici∣ples of the Praeterperfect or finite tenses, which be∣cause the Latines want, they are faine to vse the passiue, or a Periphrasis: as, vt illam sanctificaret mundatam, Erasm. Post∣quam eam purgasset, Beza. 1. Iustification in order goeth be∣fore 1. Doct. Iustificatio non accedit factori∣bus sed factores legis praecedit. Aug. de Spir. & lit. cap. 26. sanctification: I say in order, because at that verie moment that Christ by his bloud cleanseth his Church, he beginneth to sanctifie her: but when he beginneth to sanctifie her, he hath cleansed her, she is iustified. The grace then of iustification is a most free grace: it is not wrought vpon any righteousnesse of ours: for it is before it. 2. Christ sanctifieth those whom he hath cleansed. This the 2. Doct. Apostle copiously proueth in the sixth chapter to the Romans. Let none therefore boast of their cleansing by Christs bloud, till they finde themselues renewed and sanctified by the Spirit of Christ. For note the Apostles description of those who are iustified by Christ, which for more perspicuitie may thus be set downe by question and answer. To whom is there no con∣demnation? Rom. 8. 1. To them that are in Christ Iesus. Who are they? They who walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 3. Sanctification presupposeth iustification: they who are san∣ctified 3. Doct. may rest vpon it, that they are cleansed and iustified.
For sanctification is a fruit of iustification, in which respect S. Iames saith, that we are iustified by works, that is, declared so Iam. 2. 24. to be. Admirable is the comfort which the Saints in this world Use. reape hereby. For their sanctification being imperfect, and the flesh abiding in them, and lusting against the Spirit: yea sinne being present with them when they would doe good, they are oft forced to complaine and crie, O wretched mn that we are: Rom. 7. 24. who shall deliuer vs from this bodie of death! If they had no other ground to fasten the anchor of their hope vpon but their san∣ctification, it could not hold them fast enough against the tempests of Satans temptations. But in that their sanctificati∣on is a fruit and euidence of their iustification, they take heart to themselues, and thanke God that with the minde they them∣selues serue the Law of God, though with the flesh the law of sinne. And thus vpheld and comforted, they continue to striue against sinne, till it be cleane rooted out of them, as well as re∣mitted. §. 40. Of Sacramentall washing of water. One of the meanes which Christ vseth for the cleansing and sanctifying of his Church, is expressed vnder this phrase, with the washing of water. Water is the outward element vsed in Bap∣tisme: Washing is the principall Sacramentall rite therein. Wa∣ter setteth forth Christs bloud: Washing noteth out the appli∣cation and efficacie thereof, which is the purging and clean∣sing of our soules. As water without washing maketh nothing cleane: so the bloud of Christ, without a right application thereof, cleanseth no mans soule. This washing of water here mentioned, being applied to an inward spirituall cleansing, what can it else set forth but the Sacrament of Baptisme, wherein both water and washing is vsed? Obiect. There is but little washing vsed in the Sacrament of Baptisme, nothing but sprinkling a little water on the face of the partie that is baptized. Answ. That sprinkling is sufficient to shew the vse of water. Why water in baptisme is but sprinkled. The partie to be baptized is not brought to the Font to haue
his face, or any other part of his bodie made cleane, but to haue assurance of the inward cleansing of his soule. Now that our mindes may not too much dote on the outward thing done, but be wholly raised vp to the mysterie, the outward element is no further vsed, then may serue to put vs in minde of the in∣ward thing signified thereby: answerably in the Lords Supper there is not so much bread and wine giuen and receiued, as would satisfie ones appetite, or slake his hunger and quench his thirst, but only a little bit of bread, and taste of wine, to de∣clare the vse of bread and wine, and so to draw the mindes of the Communicants to a consideration of their spirituall nou∣rishment by the bodie and bloud of Iesus Christ. §. 41. How Baptisme is a meanes of cleansing and sanctifying. The manner of inferring this Sacramentall washing vpon the sanctifying and cleansing of the Church thus, with the wa∣shing of water, sheweth, that Baptisme is a meanes of sanctifying and cleansing the Church. All Doctr. those places of Scripture that attribute Ioh. 3. 5. Tit. 3. 5. Regeneration, Gal. 3. 27. Iustifi∣cation, Rom. 6. 3. Sanctification, or 1 Pet. 3. 21. Saluation thereunto, proue as much. But that the truth thereof may more fully and distinctly be conceiued, I will briefly shew, 1. In what respect Baptisme is a meanes of our sanctifying and cleansing. 2. What kinde of meanes it is. 3. How necessarie it is. In foure especiall respects it may be said to be a meanes as aforesaid. 1. In that it doth most liuely represent and set forth euen to the outward senses the inward cleansing of our soules by the bloud of Christ, and sanctifying of vs by the Spirit of Christ. Apply the vse of water (by the washing whereof foule things are made verie cleane) to the vertue of Christs bloud and efficacie of his Spirit, and the truth hereof will euidently appeare. For the better helpe in this application, read Rom. 6. 4. &c. 2. In that it doth truly propound and make tender, or offer of the grace of iustification and sanctification to the partie
baptized. In this respect it is thus described, Baptisme of repen∣tance Luke 3. 3. for remission of sinnes: and S. Peter to like purpose saith, Acts 2. 38. Repent, and be baptized euerie one of you for the remission of sins. 3. In that it doth really exhibit and seale vp to the consci∣ence of him that is baptized the forenamed graces, whereby he is assured that he is made partaker thereof. Thus Abraham receiued the signe of circumcision as a seale of the righteousnesse of Rom 4. 11. faith. Hence is it that the Eunuch and others when they were Acts 8. 39. & 16. 34. baptized, went away reioycing. 4. In that it is a particular and peculiar pledge to the partie baptized, that euen he himselfe is made partaker of the said graces: therefore euerie one in particular is baptized for him∣selfe: yea, though many be at once brought to the Font, yet euerie one by name is baptized. To this purpose faith the Apostle, Whosoeuer are baptized into Christ, haue put on Christ; Gal. 3. 27. whosoeuer, whether Peter, Iohn, Thomas, or any other particu∣lar person. Ananias said to Paul in the singular number, Be Acts 22. 16. thou baptized, and wash away thy sinnes. §. 42. Obiections against the efficacie of baptisme answered. 1. Obiect. Many that are baptized receiue no such grace at all, they are neither cleansed nor sanctified. Answ. They are only outwardly washed with water, they are not baptized with the Holy Ghost. The fault is not in that no grace accompanieth that Sacrament, but in that they re∣ceiue not, but reiect the grace which appertaineth thereto: what if some beleeue not? shall their vnbeleefe make the faith of Rom. 3. 3. God without effect? God forbid. 2. Obiect. Many receiue the forenamed graces before they are baptized, as Abraham before he was circumcized, and such Rom. 411. as were baptized after they beleeued. How then is baptisme a meanes thereof? Answ. Their spirituall cleansing is more liuely and fully manifested thereby, and they the more assured thereof. 3. Obiect. Many who long after their baptisme, haue liued like swine in sinne, and so haue not beene cleansed or sancti∣fied, yet diuers yeeres after haue beene effectually called: what meanes hath baptisme beene hereof? Answ. The vse and efficacie of baptisme is not as the act
thereof, transient, but permanent and perpetuall so long as the partie baptized liueth. Whensoeuer a sinner vnfainedly repenteth, and faithfully laieth hold on the promises of God, baptisme, which is the seale thereof is as powerfull and effe∣ctuall as it could haue beene when it was first administred. For the efficacie of baptisme consisteth in the free offer of grace. So long therefore as God continueth to offer grace, so long may a mans baptisme be effectuall. On this ground we are but once for all baptized: and as the Ier. 44. Prophets put the people in minde of their circumcision, so the Apostles of their baptisme long after it was administred. Yea, they speake of it (though the act were long before past) as if it were in doing, in the time present, Baptisme saueth. 1 Pet. 3. 21. §. 43. What kinde of meanes of grace Baptisme is. II. Baptisme is no physicall or naturall meanes of working Aqua exhibet forinsecus Sa∣cramentum gratiae, & Spi∣ritus operatur intrinsecus be∣neficium gra∣tiae. Aug. Epist. 23. grace, as if the grace which is sealed vp thereby were inherent in the water, or in the Ministers act of sprinkling it (as in me∣dicines, salues, hearbs, meats, and the like, there is inherent that vertue which proceedeth from the vse of them: and being applied, they haue their operation, whether a man beleeue it, or no) but it is only a voluntarie instrument which Christ vseth, as it pleaseth him, to worke what grace, or measure of In Baptismo praecipua pars est Spiritus, per quem & aqua sit efficax. Chrys. in Act. Hom. 1. grace seemeth best to him: so as grace is only assistant to it, not included in it: yet in the right vse thereof, Christ by his Spirit worketh that grace which is receiued by it, in which respect the Minister is said to baptize with water, but Christ with the Holy Ghost and with fire, Matth. 3. 11. §. 44. Of the necessitie of Baptisme. III. A meanes of working a thing may be said to be neces∣sarie Things neces∣sarie two wayes. two wayes. 1. Absolutely, so as the thing cannot possibly be without it. Ex Hypothesi. Thus are the proper causes of a thing absolutely necessarie, as in this case, Gods couenant, Christs bloud, and the operation of the Spirit, are absolutely necessarie for attaining any grace. 2. By consequence, so as according to that course and order which God hath set downe, things cannot be without them. Baptisme is not absolutely necessarie as a cause: for then should it be equall to Gods couenant, Christs bloud, and the
worke of the Spirit. Yea then should all that are baptized without any exception be cleansed. But it is by consequence necessarie: and that in a double Exhypothesi. respect. 1. In regard of Gods ordinance. 2. In regard of our need thereof. 1. God hauing ordained this a Sacrament to be vsed, it is necessarie it should be vsed, if for no other end, yet for manife∣station of our obedience. He that carelesly neglecteth; or wil∣fully contemneth any Sacrament which God shall enioyne him to vse, his soule shall be cut off. Gen. 17. 14. 2. Great is the need that we haue thereof, in regard of our dulnesse in conceiuing things spirituall, and of our weaknesse in beleeuing things inuisible. We are carnall, and earthly: and by things sensible and earthly, doe the better conceiue things spirituall and heauenly: therefore hath God ordained visible elements to be Sacraments of inuisible graces. Againe we are slow to beleeue such things as are promised in the word, therefore the more to helpe and strengthen our faith, God hath added to his couenant in the word, his seale in and by the Sacrament: that by two immutable things, (Gods coue∣nant and Gods seale) in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might haue strong consolation. Besides, though in generall we doe beleeue the truth of Gods word, yet we are doubtfull to apply it to our selues: wherefore for better applying Gods co∣uenant to our owne soule, God hath added his Sacrament to his word. §. 45. Of the contrarie extremes of Papists and Anabaptists about the necessitie and efficacie of Baptisme. There are two extremes contrarie to the forenamed points about baptisme. One in the excesse, which is of Papists that attribute too much thereunto, and make it a plaine Idoll. Another in the defect, of Anabaptists and Libertines, which Papists attri∣bute too much to Baptisme. Bellarm. de Bapt lib. 1. cap. 4. derogate too much from it, and make it an idle ceremonie. In two things doe Papists exceed, 1. In the necessitie Of Baptisme. 2. In the efficacie     They make it so absolutely necessary, as if any die vnbaptized
he cannot be saued: which doome they passe against infants, though they be depriued thereof without any fault of their owne, yea or of their parents, being still borne. A mercilesse sen∣tence without any warrant of Gods word: yea against his word & against the order which he hath prescribed. He hath establi∣shed Gen. 17. 7. his couenant, & promised to be the God of the faithfull & of their seed: on which ground S. Peter saith, The promise is vnto Acts 2. 39. you & vnto your children: & S. Paul saith, your children are holy. 1 Cor. 7. 14. Shall all these priuiledges be made void by an ineuitable want Gen. 17. 12. Jos. 5. 5. of baptisme? if so, would God haue enioyned circumcision (which to the Iewes was as baptisme is to Christians) to be put off to the eighth day, before which day many infants died? or would Moses haue suffered it to be forborne all the time that the Israelites were in the wildernesse? If it be said that baptisme is more necessarie then circumcision, I answer, the Scripture layeth no more necessitie vpon it. If it were so necessarie as they make it, then the vertue of Christs death were lesse effectuall since he was actually exhibited then before. For before it was effectuall for infants without a Sacrament, but belike not now. Had the ancient Churches conceiued so of the absolute neces∣sitie of baptisme, they would not haue had set times for the ad∣ministring thereof: nor suffered it to be put off so long as they did. In Thessalia mos fuit vt pa∣schalibus tan∣tùm debus bap∣tismus pera∣geretur, Niceph. hist. lib. 12. cap. 34. Socrat. hist. lib. 5. cap. 22. Some Churches appointed it to be administred only at Easter. Ne quen∣quam Sacerdo∣tes baptizent praeterquam in Pasc a & Pentecosle. L L. Pipi. Carol. M. &c. Some at Easter and Whitsuntide. And though many who gaue euidence of their true faith died before they were baptized, yet Iustus qua∣cun{que} morte praeuentus fue∣rit anima eius in refrigerio erit, dixit Ambr. Orat. de obit. Valent. Qui diem obij antequam bap∣tisaretur. they did not thereupon iudge them to be dam∣ned. This practise and iudgement of the ancients hath made Rhem. annot. on Ioh. 3. 5. many Papists somewhat to mitigate that absolute necessitie, and to say that, In this case, God which hath not bound his grace, in respect of his owne freedome, to any Sacrament, may and doth ac∣cept them as baptized, which either are martyred before they could be baptized, on else depart this life with vow and desire to haue that Sacrament, but by some remedilesse necessitie could not obtaine it. If remedilesse necessitie can helpe the matter, what necessitie so re∣medilesse, as for a childe to be still borne. Againe, they adde such efficacie to baptisme, as it giueth grace Ex opere ope∣rato, B em. loc. citat. of the worke it selfe: wherein they equall it to the verie bloud of Christ; and take away the peculiar worke of the
Spirit; and the vse of faith, repentance, and such like graces. What can there be more in the water of baptisme, then was in the bloud of such beasts as were offered vp for sacrifices? But it is not possible that the bloud of Buls and Goats should take away sin. Heb. 10. 4. They themselues attribute no such efficacie to the word prea∣ched, and yet they cannot shew where the holy Ghost hath giuen more vertue to baptisme, then to the word. This text ioyneth them both together (that he might cleanse it with 1 Cor. 1. 21. Rom. 1. 16. the washing of water through the word) What can be more said of a meanes then that which is said of the word? It plea∣sed God by preaching to saue them that beleeue. The Gospell is the power of God to saluation, &c. On the other side, Anabaptists, and such like Libertines, too Anabaptists extenuate baptisme too much. lightly esteeme this holy and necessary ordinance of God, in that they make it only a badge of our profession, a note of difference betwixt the true and false Church, a signe of mutuall fellowship, a bare signe of spirituall grace, a resemblance of mortification, regeneration, inscition into Christ, with the like, but no more: These indeed are some of the ends and vses of Baptisme: But in that they restraine all the efficacy thereof hereunto, they take away the greatest comfort, and truest be∣nefit which the Church reapeth thereby, as may be gathered out of the points noted §. 41. before. §. 46. Of the inward washing by Baptisme. Ecce quia Chri∣stus sanctificat; ecce quia Chri∣stus ipso laua∣cro aquae in verbo vbi Minister vide∣tur corporaliter operari ipse abluit, ipse mundat. Aug. contr. lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 49. In that with this washing of water, Christ cleanseth his Church, I obserue that Whosoeuer are fully baptised are cleansed from sinne. Fully, that is, powerfully and effectually, as well inwardly by the Spirit, as outwardly by the Minister. Cleansed, both from the guilt of sinne by Christs bloud, and from the power of sinne by the worke of his Spirit. To this purpose tend the many emphaticall phrases attri∣buted by the Apostles to Baptisme, as that we are baptised into Iesus Christ, baptised into his death, buried with him by baptisme; that Baptisme doth saue vs; that Baptisme is the washing of re∣generation, Rom. 6. 3, 4. 1 Pet. 3. 21. Tit. 3 5. with the like. Vaine is the reioycing of many, who boast of their baptisme, Vse. and thinke themselues by vertue thereof to be as good Chri∣stians
as the best, and yet liue and lie in their sinne, being more besmeered and defiled therewith then they were, when they were first borne. Iohn saith, Christ baptiscth with the holy Ghost Matth. 3. 11. and with fire: the Apostle saith, Christ cleanseth with the washing of water. If that fire of the holy Ghost burne not vp the drosse of sinne in thee, and this water wash not away the filth of sinne, thou wert neuer: fully baptised. It may be the hand of some Minister hath sprinkled a little water on thy face, but Christs bloud hath not as yet beene sprinkled on the soule: all the be∣nefit which thou reapest by thy baptisme is, that another day thou shalt dearely answer for the abuse of so honourable an ordinance. §. 47. Of ioyning the word with Baptisme. The other meanes of sanctifying and cleansing the Church here expressed, is the word. This being applied vnto Bap∣tisme, and ioyned with it, must needs be meant of the promise of Grace sealed vp in Baptisme, which is Gods promise of iustifying vs freely and sanctifying vs effectually, plainly made knowne and truly beleeued: This meanes being thus added to this Sacrament, we may well inferre that It is necessary that the word and Baptisme goe together: that Doct. where this Sacrament is administred, the doctrine thereof be truly, plainly, intelligibly taught, so as the nature, efficacy, end, and vse thereof may be made knowne; and the couenant of God sealed vp thereby, beleeued. So saith Christ, Mat. 28. 19. Goe teach all nations baptising them. So did the Luk. 3. 3. Baptist, and the Act. 2. 38. & 8. 12, 37. & 10. 47. & 16. 15, 33. Apo∣stles, they preached the Gospell to them whom they baptised. 1. A Sacrament without the word is but an idle ceremony: Reasons. Detrahe ver∣bum & quid est aqua nisi aqua? accedat verbum ad clementum & fit sacramen∣tum. Aug. in Ioh. 15. tract. 80. no more then a seale without a couenant: for it is the word that maketh knowne the couenant of God. 2. It is the word which maketh the greatest difference be∣twixt the sacramentall washing of water, and ordinary com∣mon washing. 3. By the word the ordinary creatures which we vse are sanctified, much more the holy ordinances of God, whereof Baptisme is one of the principall. Quest. Is it not then lawfull to administer Baptisme with∣out 1 Tim. 4. 5. a Sermon?
Answ. Though it be a very commendable, and honoura∣ble manner of administring that Sacrament, then to admini∣ster it when the word is preached, yet I thinke not a Sermon at that time to be so necessary, as it should be vnlawfull with∣out one, to administer Baptisme. For the ioyning of the word and Sacrament here spoken of is, that they who are baptised, or who present children to be baptised, and answer for them, or are present at the administring of Baptisme, or liue in the places where it vseth to be administred, should be instructed in the Gospell, and taught the couenant which Baptisme sea∣leth vp. Besides, the liturgie and publike forme prescribed for the administring of Baptisme both in our Church and other reformed Churches, laieth downe the nature, efficacy, end, vse, and other like points appertaining to that Sacrament, & plainly declareth the couenant of God sealed vp thereby: so as in our and other like Churches where such formes are pre∣scribed to be alwaies vsed, the word is neuer separated from Baptisme, though at the administring of Baptisme there be no Sermon. The Church of Rome doth directly transgresse against the Papists ioyne not the word and seale. forenamed rule of ioyning the word and Baptisme together. For though they haue a publike forme prescribed, yet it being in an vnknowne tongue, not vnderstood of the people, nor expounded to them, it is all one as if there were no forme at all, no word at all: for that which is not vnderstood is all one 1 Cor. 14. 9. &c. as if it were not vttered. Much more hainous is their transgression who liue vnder the Gospell, where it is preached plainly to the vnderstan∣ding and capacity of the meanest, and yet are carelesse in com¦ming to it, or in attending vnto it, and so remaine as ignorant as if they liued in places where the word is not preached at all, or in an vnknowne tongue. Such ignorant persons if they were not baptised are not worthy while they remaine so ig∣norant to be baptised, nor yet to present their children to be baptised, or to be present at the baptisme of others. As Mi∣nisters that baptise ought to preach the word, so ought they who are baptised to be instructed in the word.
§. 48. Of the Inference of Glorification vpon Iustification and Sanctification. EPHES. 5. 27. That he might present it to himselfe a glorious Church, &c. THe most principall end, in regard of the Churches good, which Christ aimed at when he gaue himselfe for her, is her glorious estate in heauen: this is the end of the forena∣med end. For why did Christ giue himselfe for the Church? That he might sanctifie it, hauing cleansed it: why did he cleanse, and sanctifie it? That he might present it to himseife a glorious Church. Hence note these three points. 1. Iustification and sanctification must goe before glorification. 2. The end why the Saints are cleansed and sanctified in this world, is that they may be presented glorious to Christ in the world to come. 3. The only meanes to make vs glorious before Christ our spouse is righteousnesse. 1. All those places of Scripture which set our righteous∣nesse in this world before our glory in the world to come (as Tit. 2. 12, 13. 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. very many places doe) doe proue the first point, that Iustifica∣tion and Sanctification must goe before Glorification. Among Men must be iustified and sanctified be∣fore they can be glorified. Rom. 8. 30. other proofes note especially the order of the seuerall linkes of that golden chaine that reacheth from Gods eternall counsell before the world, vnto our euerlasting glory after this world, Whom he did predestinate them he also called; and whom he called them he also iustified; and whom he iustified them he also glorified. 1. Heauen, the place of our glorification, is an holy Citie, Reasons. Reu. 21. 10, 27. whereinto no vncleane thing shall enter. 2. In that place the Church is to be maried vnto Christ, and to be euer with him: she must therefore be pure as he is 1 Ioh. 3. 2, 3. pure: for he will not endure the society of a foule filthy spouse. As we desire assurance of our glorification in heauen, so Vse. let vs get, and giue euidence of our iustification and sanctifi∣cation on earth. The euidence of our iustification is a sound and true faith. The euidence of our sanctification is a good and cleare conscience.
The forenamed proofes and reasons doe also confirme the We are here cleansed that we might be hereafter glo∣rified. second point, that The end why the Saints are cleansed and sancti∣fied in this world is, that they may be presented glorious to Christ in the world to come. It is therefore needfull and behouefull, not only in regard of Ex co quod hic accipit Ecclesia ad illam glori∣am quae hic non est, per∣fectionemque perducitur. Aug. Retract. l. 1. c 7. Christs honour, but also of our owne glory and happinesse, that here while we liue on earth we be sanctified and cleansed. If Christ for our sakes had an eie at our future and euerlasting glory, and for that end prepared meanes to bring vs there∣unto, ought not we ourselues much rather haue an eie there∣at, and both auoid all things which may hinder it, and vse all meanes whereby we may be assured of it? Moses had respect vnto the recompence of the reward. Yea Christ for the ioy which Heb. 11. 26. & 12. 2. was set before him endured the crosse, and despised the shame. 3. That Righteousnesse is the only meanes to make vs glorious Righteousnes the only meanes to make vs glo∣rious. before Christ our spouse, is euident by this, that Christ gaue him∣selfe to worke and effect this meanes for this end. Christ him∣selfe by his death, hath consecrated this, and no other meanes. If there be any other meanes then that which Christ by offe∣ring vp himselfe hath procured, what need Christ to haue beene offered vp? To shew that this is the meanes to make the Church glorious before Christ, the holy Ghost resembleth the righteousnesse of the Saints to fine linnen, cleane, and white, Reu. 19. 7, 8. wherewith the wife of the Lambe is made ready against the day of mariage. Christ himselfe loueth righteousnesse and hateth wickednesse: Reason. Psal. 45. 7. they therefore, and none but they that are araied with righte∣ousnesse, are glorious in his eies. This I haue the rather noted against the conceit of our ad∣uersaries, Vse. who place all the glory of the Church in outward Papists place the glory of the Church in outward pompe. pompe. Wherefore their Pope whom they make head of the Church, and after a peculiar manner the spouse of Christ, must haue his triple crowne, his scarlet robes, his throne ad∣uanced aboue kings: Men must be his horses to beare him: and Kings and Nobles must be his men to wait on him. Their Priests also must be araied with glorious copes of the best wrought gold. Their temples must be decked with cu∣rious, carued, gilded images. Their hoast caried about in
manner of a triumph. Their people all besprinkled with wa∣ter. Their superstitious houses must be the fairest buildings in a kingdome, and haue the greatest reuenues of a kingdome belonging to them: with the like. Dionysius Ioui Olympio au∣reum amicu∣lum detraxit, laneum substi∣tuens, non sine dicterio, laneum viz. ad vtram que anni tempe∣statem esse aptius. Is this glory fit for Christs spouse? belike then Christ hath carnall eies and eares: and is delighted with those things wherewith the world is delighted. The wiser among the heathen did scoffe at such base conceits which their people had of their gods. Shall Christians thinke more basely of Christ, then the heathen of their gods? Too much doe most people doat on outward worldly glory: euen so much as they neg∣lect true righteousnesse. For our parts as we desire to appeare before Christ so as he Vse. may thinke vs glorious, let vs be araied with righteousnesse & holinesse, without which no man shall see the Lord, Heb. 12. 14. §. 44. Of the fruition of Christs presence in heauen. EPHES. 5. 27. That he might present it to himselfe a glo∣rious Church, not hauing spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy, and without blemish. HAuing noted the inference of this verse vpon the for∣mer: I will now handle it distinctly by it selfe. In it is contained a description of the glorious estate of the Church in heauen. Of that estate must this description be here meant, Ubicunque commemoraui ecclesiam non habentem ma∣culam aut ru∣gam, non sic accipiendum, quasi iam sit, sed quae praepa∣ratur vt sit, quando appa∣rebit gloriosa. Aug. Retract. l. 3. c. 18. for on earth it is not simply without spot or wrinkle: though it be prepared so to be. This estate is 1. Generally propounded. 2. Particularly exemplified.   In the generall pro∣position is noted, 1. Her condition (she is presented to Christ.) 2. Her quality (glorious.)   The particular exemplification thereof is 1. Priuatiue, by remouing all deformity: noted in two words, Spot, Wrinkle.   2. Positiue, by adorning her with beauty: noted also in two words, Holy, Blamelesse.   The word (present) is taken from the custome of solemni∣zing .
a mariage: first the spouse was wooed, and then set be∣fore her husband that he might take her to wife, to be with him. Thus Gen. 2. 22. Eue was presented by God to Adam that he might take her for his wife: and Est. 2. 13. Esther among other virgins was presented to Ahash-verosh. This sheweth that Doct. The Church in heauen shall enioy the presence of Christ: Ioh. 14. 2, 3. Christ himselfe saith expresly to his disciples, I goe to pre∣pare a place for you, that where I am, there ye may be also. On this ground did the Apostle desire to depart, namely Phil. 1. 23. to be with Christ, and 2 Cor. 5. 8. Reason. to be present with the Lord. In heauen is the mariage betwixt Christ and the Church solemnized, which here on earth hath beene in preparing. God the Father hath giuen his Ioh. 3. 16. sonne vnto the Church, and the & 17. 6. Church vnto his sonne: yea Act. 20. 28. Christ himselfe hath pur∣chased the Church vnto himselfe by his bloud, and Ose. 2. 19, 20. promi∣sed mariage vnto her, and the more to assure the Church of his loue he hath Eph. 4. 8. bestowed many gifts vpon her: he hath further sent Paranymphi. his Ministers in his name to Ioh. 3. 29. wooe and 2 Cor. 5. 20. be∣seech the Church to giue her consent, and to & 11. 2. prepare her as a pure virgin for himselfe: Hereupon the Church hath gi∣uen her consent, for Eph. 5. 24. as a spouse she is subiect vnto Christ as vnto an head. These things being so, how can it be thought that Christ will forsake her, and not receiue her to be with him for euer? Can the thought of death be terrible to such as know and Vse. beleeue the truth hereof? Will not rather the consideration Incoragement against death. thereof make them with the Apostle to sigh, and desire to de∣part, that they may be with the Lord? The highest degree of the Churches happinesse consisteth in this fruition of the Totum tibi sit Deus: quia horum quae di∣ligis, totum tibi est. Aug. in Ioh. 3. tract. 13. Reu. 21. 22, 23. Ioh 17. 20, 21. presence of her spouse: for so he becommeth all in all vn∣to her: not by meanes, as in this world, but immediatly by himselfe: so as there shall need no Minister, no Sacrament, no ordinance to set forth Christ vnto vs: no Gouernour in fa∣mily, Church, or common-wealth, to represent his person, or to keepe vs in subiection: no light to direct vs, no food to sustaine vs; we shall be so assisted with Christ as we shall need nothing. If those seruants were happy that stood continually before Salomon, what are they that alwaies stand not as seruants 1 King. 10. 8.
but as a wife in his presence that is infinitly greater then Salo∣mon? If it were a great grace & fauour, that Moses saw the back∣parts Exo. 33. 23. of God, what a grace and fauour is it, to behold Christ 1 Cor. 13. 12. face to face? For when he doth appeare, we shall see him as he is. 1 Joh. 3 2. Though now we be absent from the Lord, yet let vs vphold our selues with the expectation and assurance of this, that we shall be presented before Christ. §. 50. Of the Glorie of the Church in heauen. The quality of the Church in heauen is as excellent as may be, Doctr. and therefore here said to be glorious: all beautie, all comeli∣nesse, . all grace, whatsoeuer may make the Church amiable, louely, or any way to be desired, or admired, is comprised vn∣der this word glorious. In this respect the Saints are said to shine, and that as Reu. 21. 11. pretious stones, yea as the Dan. 12. 3. firmament, as the starres, and as the Mat. 13. 43. sunne: and to be 1 Ioh. 3, 2. like Christ himselfe: and to Col. 3 4. appeare with him in glory. This glory of the Saints extendeth both to soule and body, and whole person. In regard of their soules they shall be all Psal. 45. 13. glorious within: for they are Heb. 12. 23. Spirits of iust men, made perfect: 1 Cor. 13. 12. perfect know∣ledge, wisdome, and all manner of purity shall be in them. In regard of their bodies, they shall be Phil. 3. 21. fashioned like to Christs glorious body: and that in incorruption, immortality, Ecclesia in fine seculi expectat quo l in Christi corpore prae∣monstratum est, &c. Aug. Epist. 119. beauty, brightnesse, grace, fauour, agility, strength, and the like. It is therefore truly said, that the Church in the end of the world expecteth that which is before demonstrated in Christs body. In regard of their person, as a wife is aduanced to the ho∣nour and dignity of her husband, so shall they to the honour and dignity of Christ, so farre as they are capable of it: for they shall be Luk. 22. 30. next vnto Christ, yea Ioh. 17. 21 one with him, and so Heb. 1. 14. aboue the most glorious Angels. Much more might be spoken of the glory of the Church: but neuer can enough be spoken thereof, no not by the tongue of men or Angels: for 1 Cor. 2. 9. eye hath not seene, nor eare heard, neither haue entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them which loue him. When Paul was rapt vp into the third heauen, and saw but a glimps of this
glory, 2 Cer. 12 4. . he heard vnspeakable words, which are not possible for man to vtter. Wherefore 2 Cer. 4. 17. when he speaketh of it, he vseth such a transcendent kinde of phrase, as cannot in any tongue be fully expressed: we thus as well as we can by one degree of compa∣rison vpon another translate it, . a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glorie. Is not this sufficient to vphold vs against all the reproach and disgrace which the world layeth vpon vs, because we are Use. of the Church of Christ? The world hath Isa. 62. 4. of old counted her, to whom Christ saith, Hephzibah (that is, my delight in her) and Beulah (that is, maried) forsaken and desolate, yea 1 Cor. 4. 13. . as the filth of the world, and the off-scowring of all things. Among Hea∣then, none so vildly esteemed of as Christians; and amongst Papists, none so as Protestants; & amongst carnall Gospellers, none so as they who endeuour 1 Ioh. 3. 3. to purifie themselues as Christ is pure, and to auoid the common sins of the world. When for Christs sake we are basely accounted of, let vs thinke of this. §. 51. Of the Churches freedome from all deformity in heauen. Not hauing spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. The first point noted by the Apostle in his exemplification of the forenamed glorie, is a remouing of all deformitie. The word translated . spot, is taken for a staine on a garment, and a foule specke on a mans face, or other part of the bodie: or a scarre, or other blemish in his flesh by a sore, wound, blow, or the like. The other word (. wrinkl-) is taken for a creast in the face through old age, for it signifieth a gathering together of the skin by old age: by it is meant any manner of breaking (as we speake) by age, sicknesse, trouble, paine, or the like. Be∣cause there may be also deformities other wayes, the Apostle addeth this clause (or any such thing.) These things applied to . the Church, shew that No manner of deformitie shall cleaue to the Church in heauen. Doctr. Thereshall be in her no staine or contagion of sinne receiued from others, no scarre of any euill humour arising from it selfe, no wrinkle, no defect of spirituall moisture, no signe of the old man, nor any thing that may any way make it seeme de∣formed, or vncomely in the sight of Christ. Not only great,
hainous, capitall sins, (which are as botches and boiles, and as open, wide sores, gashes and wounds) but all spots and specks, all wrinkles and defects, all manner of blemishes whatsoeuer within, or without, shall be cleane taken away. Sinne shall not only be subdued in vs, but vtterly rooted out of vs: no relique, no signe thereof shall be left remaining. In this respect it is said, that God shall wipe away all teares, that is, shall take away all Reu. 7. 17. & 21. 4. matter of mourning, sorrow, and griefe. Now there is nothing that ministreth matter of more sorrow to the Saints then sinne. That remnant of sin which was in the Apostle euen after his regeneration, made him thus cry out, O wretched man that I am. Rom. 7. 24. Though this be but a priuatiue good, yet it addeth much to the heauenly happinesse of the Saints. If it were possible that we should enioy the rest and glorie prepared for the Saints in heauen, and withall there should remaine on vs the spots and wrinkles of sinne, these spots and wrinkles would be as the hand-writing which appeared to Belshazzer in the midst of Dan 5. 5. his iollitie: they would be as gall mixed with wine: they would turne all our ioy into heauinesse, and take away the sweet rellish of all our happinesse. The consideration there∣fore of this priuatiue benefit cannot but breed in the hearts of all such as are members of this Church a longing desire after this perfect purging of them from all deformitie. §. 52. Of the perfect puritie of the Church in heauen. But that it should be holy and without blemish. The last branch whereby the celestiall glorie of the Church is set forth, is the perfect puritie thereof: the aduersatiue parti∣cle (BVT) sheweth that the holinesse here spoken of is no im∣perfect . holinesse, such as the sanctification of the Saints is in this world, but an absolute perfect holinesse in all the parts and degrees thereof: such as is without spot or wrinkle: without relique, or signe of sinne: and therefore by way of explanation is added, . without blemish, or blamelesse: such as man, Angell, nor God himselfe can finde fault withall. Heb. 9. 14. This attribute is oft applied to the person and bloud of Iesus Christ, and there∣fore 1 Pet. 1. 19. it must needs set forth perfect puritie. Whence we may obserue that
The Sanctification of the Saints shall be perfect in heauen. They shall not only be iustified by hauing their sinnes couered to them, nor only haue their sanctification truly begun in them, but also in euerie part, point, and degree thereof absolutely perfected: in which respect they are said to be iust men made Heb. 12. 23. perfect. Adam in his innocencie was not more pure then the Saints shall be in heauen: yea they shall farre surpasse Adam as in the measure, so in the stabilite and perpetuitie thereof. In our endeuour after holinesse let vs haue an eye to this Vse. perfection: and not faint, if we attaine not to that measure which we desire. Perfection is reserued for the world to come. Yet know we, that the more holy and blamelesse we are, the neerer we come to that heauenly estate: the more spots and blemishes of sinne we haue, the more vnlike we are vnto it, and the lesse hope we haue of enioying that heauenly happinesse. All the forenamed seuerall points of the glorious estate of Generall vses of the glorious estate of the Church in heauen. the Church in heauen should rauish our spirits, and euen breake our hearts with an holy admiration of Christs good-nesse, and fill our mouths with praises for the same, and make vs sigh, and long after the same, and with all good conscience and diligence vse all the meanes we can to attaine thereunto: no labour will be lost herein. Surely, this is either not knowne, or not beleeued, or not remembred, or not duly and seriously considered by such as make light account thereof. Let that which hath beene but briefly touched be further meditated vp∣on, and let vs pray that the eyes of our vnderstanding may be en∣lightned, Ephes. 1. 18. that we may know what is the riches of the glorious inhe∣ritance of the Saints. Were it not for this hope, the Saints were 1 Eor. 15. 19. of all the most miserable; whereas now they are the most happy. §. 53. Of the application of the things which Christ hath done for the Church, vnto husbands. EPHES. 5. 28. So ought men to loue their wiues, &c. THE first clause of this verse serueth both for an application of the former argument, and also for a transition to an∣other argument. The particle of relation (So) sheweth that that which hath
before beene deliuered of Christs loue to his Church, ought to be referred and applied to husbands. For as Christ loued his Church, So ought husbands to loue their wiues. Quest. Why are these transcendent euidences of Christs surpassing loue to his Church set before husbands? can any such things be expected from husbands to their wiues? Answ. No, See §. 27. not for measure, but for likenesse. For in this large declaration of Christs loue, there are two generall points to be noted. 1. That the Church in her selfe was no way worthie of loue. 2. That Christ so carried himselfe towards her that he made her worthie of much loue. This ought to be the minde of husbands to their wiues. 1. Though they be no way worthie of loue, yet they must loue them. 2. They must endeuour with all the wit and wisdome they haue, to make them worthie of loue. I say endeuour because it is not simply in the husbands power to doe the deed. Yet his faithfull endeuour shall on his part be accepted for the deed. Of these points I shall hereafter more fully speake. §. 54. Of the application of the loue which a man beareth to himselfe, vnto an husband. EPHES. 5. 28. So ought men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies. THe forenamed particle (So) hath also relation to another patterne, namely, of a mans selfe to his bodie: and so it is a transition from one argument to another. There is some more Emphasis here vsed in setting downe an husbands dutie, then was before, vers. 25. There it was laid downe by way of exhortation, Husbands loue your wiues. Here it is laid downe with a straiter charge: Husbands ought to loue their wiues. So as this dutie is not a matter arbi∣trarie, left to the husbands will to doe it, or leaue it vndone:
there is a necessitie laid vpon him: he must loue his wife. Woe therefore vnto him if he doe it not. In setting downe this argument taken from a mans selfe, the Apostle resembleth a mans wife vnto his bodie: wherein he hath relation to vers. 23. where he said, the husband is the head of the wife. Whereby he sheweth, that as an husbands place is a motiue to his wife, for her to performe her dutie: so to him∣selfe, See Treat. 4. §. 74 76. Why the patterne of a mans selfe is added to the patterne of Christ. for him to performe his dutie. He is her head, therefore she must be subiect to him. She is his bodie, therefore he must loue her. This example of a mans selfe is both a reason, the more to moue husbands to loue their wiues, and also a rule to teach them how to loue them. The reason is implied vnder that neere vnion that is betwixt Sicut corpus nunquam à se dissidet, ne{que} anima aduersus seipsum, ita vi∣rum & mulie∣rem non conue∣nit dissidere. Chrys. in Gen. hom. 45. a man and his wife: she is as neere to him as his owne bodie: therefore she ought to be as deere to him. The bodie neuer dissenteth from it selfe, nor the soule against it selfe. So nei∣ther should man and wife. The rule is noted vnder the manner of a mans louing his owne bodie: as intirely as he loueth his bodie, so intirely he ought to loue his wife. Of the manner of a mans louing himselfe, see Treat. 4. §. 74. 76. The more to enforce this comparison, the Apostle addeth, He that loueth his wife, loueth himselfe. Ephes. 5. 28. By this clause two things are implied. 1. That a wife is not only as a mans bodie, namely, his outward flesh, but as his person, his bodie and soule. She is as his bodie, because she was taken out of his bodie: and be∣cause Gen. 2. 23. she is set vnder him, as his bodie vnder his head. She is as himselfe, by reason of the bond of mariage, which maketh one of two. In which respect a wife is commonly called a mans Matth. 19. 5, 6. second selfe. 2. That an husband in louing his wife loueth himselfe: so as the benefit of louing his wife will redound to himselfe, as well as to his wife.
§. 55. Of the amplification of a mans loue of himselfe. EPHES. 5. 29. For no man euer yet hated his owne flesh: but nourisheth and cherisheth it, euen as the Lord the Church. THe former patterne of a mans selfe is here further ampli∣fied. For first the Apostle proueth, that a man loueth him∣selfe: and then he sheweth how he loueth himselfe. Two arguments are vsed to proue the point. One is taken from the contrarie: No man euer yet hated his owne flesh. Therefore he loueth it. The other is taken from the effects of loue: To nourish and cherish ones flesh is a fruit of loue: But euerie man nourisheth and cherisheth his flesh. Therefore he loueth it. This latter argument sheweth the manner of a mans louing himselfe: and therein a mans loue of himselfe is a rule to teach him how to loue his wife. This indefinite particle (no man) is to be restrained to such as haue the vnderstanding and affection of a man in them: as if he had said, no man in his right wits: for furious, franticke, mad, desperate persons will cut their armes, legs, and other parts, mangle their flesh, hang, drowne, smother, choake, and stab themselues. Euen so they are as men out of their wits, who Quia se dili∣gat, & prodesse sibi velit, dubi∣tare dementis est. Aug. de doct. Christ. lib. 1. cap. 25. hate, or any way hurt their wiues: yea, it is the part of a mad man to doubt of louing, and doing good to himselfe. These two words (to nourish and cherish) comprize vnder them a carefull prouiding of all things needfull for a mans bodie. To nourish, is properly to feed. . To cherish, is to keepe warme. . The former is done by food: the latter by apparell. Vnder Proprie dicitur de galina fouen∣te oua, quum illis incubat. food, and apparell the Apostle comprizeth all things needfull for this life, where he saith, Hauing food andraiment, let vs therewith be content. 1 Tim 6. 8. This applied to an husband, sheweth that he ought to haue a prouident care for the good of his wife in all things needfull for her.
That he may yet further presse this point, he returneth againe to the example of Christ (euen as the Lord the Church) The Apostle thought that this naile of loue had need be fast beaten into the heads and hearts of husbands, and therefore addeth blow to blow to knocke it vp deepe, euen to the head: before he confirmed Christs example with the example of our selues: here he confirmeth the example of our selues with the example of Christ againe. This he doth for two especiall reasons. 1. The more forcibly to vrge the point: for two exam∣ples adde weight one to another: especially this latter which is so farre more excellent as we heard out of vers. 25, 26, 27. 2. To giue husbands a better direction for their prouidence towards their wiues, whom they must nourish and cherish, not only as their bodies, but as Christ nourisheth and cherish∣eth his Church, not only with things temporall, but also with things spirituall and eternall. §. 56. Of mans naturall affection to himselfe. EPHES. 5. 28, 29. So ought men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies: he that loueth his wife loueth himselfe. For no man euer yet hated his owne flesh: but nourisheth, and cherisheth it, euen as the Lord the Church. HAuing briefly shewed the generall scope of the 28 and 29 verses, I will proceed to a more distinct handling of them. They setforth The naturall affection of a man to himselfe. Summ 28. & 2 Two points are here to be noted. 1. The generall proposition, that a man is well affected to himselfe. 2. The particular amplification, and manifestation of that affection. This is manifested two waies. 1. Negatiuely, No man hateth his owne flesh.     2. Affirmatiuely, and that in two branches 1. Nourisheth it. 2. Cherisheth    
Both these are iustified by the like affection of Christ to the Church which is his body (Euen as the Lord the Church) In that the Apostle propoundeth the naturall affection of a mans selfe to his body as a motiue and patterne to Christians, to loue their wiues, and also iustifieth the same by a like affe∣ction of Christ to his Church, I obserue that Naturall affection is a thing lawfull and commendable: it is Doctr. an affection which may stand with a good conscience: which Gods word is so farre from taking away, as it doth establish it. For such as are . without naturall affection are directly con∣demned: and we are Rom. 12. 10 commanded to be so kindly affectio∣ned Rom. 1. 30. one to another as  we are to our selues. Yea the law in 2 Tim. 3. 3. the strict rigour thereof laieth downe that naturall affection which is in a man to himselfe as a rule for the loue of his neighbour (Mat. 22. 39. thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.) Hence is it that the Leu. 19. 18. Isa. 58. 7. Prophets, 1 Cor. 12. 26. Jam. 2. 8. Apostles, and Christ himselfe doe oft call vpon vs to haue an eie to that affection which we beare to our selues. Of this patterne Christ saith, Mat. 7. 12. This is the Law, and the Prophets, this is the briefe summe of them, this is it which they doe much vrge and presse. 1. Naturall affection was at first created of God, by him Reasons. planted in man, so that as soule, body, the powers, and parts of them, are in their substance good things, this affection also in it selfe is good. 2. There are the same reasons to loue our selues, as our brethren. For we our selues are made after Gods image, re∣deemed by Christs bloud, members of the same mysticall bodie, keepers of our selues, to giue an account of the good or hurt we doe to our selues, with the like. In the Law, vnder this word neighbour, our selues are comprised: and euery commandement of the second table is to be applied to our selues. §. 57. Of naturall selfe-loue. Obiect. Louers of themselues are condemned in Gods word, as 2 Tim. 3. 2. Phil. 2. 21. 1 Cor. 10. 24. Rom. 15. 1. Answ. There is a double louing of a mans selfe. The seuerall kindes of selfe-loue. One good and commendable:
The other euill, and damnable. Good and commenda∣ble louing of a mans selfe is 1. Naturall. 2. Spirituall.   That which is naturall is in all by the very instinct of nature: and it was at first created, and still is by Gods prouidence pre∣serued in our nature, and that for the preseruation of nature. Were there not such a naturall loue of himselfe in euery one, man would be as carelesse of himselfe, as of others, and as loth to take paines for himselfe, as for others. Wherefore that euery one might haue care at least of one, euen of himselfe, and so the world be better preserued, God hath reserued in man this naturall affection, notwithstanding his corruption by sin. Yea further because euery one is not able to looke to him∣selfe, at least when he is young, sicke, old, or any other way im∣potent, God by his wise prouidence hath extended this natu∣rall affection towards otheralso as they are neerely linked vn∣to vs by the bonds of nature. The next to a mans selfe are (by bloud and bond of nature) children. Admirably much is that which parents doe for their children, which they would neuer doe, if there were not a naturall affection in them to their children. From children againe this affection ariseth towards their parents, that when parents grow old, impo∣tent, or any way vnable to helpe themselues, they might haue succour from their children. And because parents and chil∣dren are not alwaies together, or not able to helpe one ano∣ther, or vnnaturall, God hath yet further extended this natu∣rall affection to brethren, cousins, and other kindred. And for a further extent thereof hath instituted mariage betwixt such as are not of the same bloud, and by vertue of that bond raised a naturall affection not only in husband and wife one to another, but also in all the alliance that is made therby. More∣ouer this affection is wrought in neighbours, friends, fellowes, and other by like bonds knit together, that the bow of Gods prouidence might haue many strings, and if one breake, ano∣ther might hold. In all these kinds, the neerer a man com∣meth to himselfe, the more doth this affection shew it selfe, ac∣cording to the prouerbe, Neare is my coat, but nearer is my skin. God hauing wrought this naturall affection in the seuerall
kindes thereof, and there being good ends and vses thereof, it is not to be condemned. §. 58. Of spirituall selfe-loue. Spirituall selfe-loue is that which is supernaturally wrought in man by Gods Spirit: whereby he is both inlightned to discerne what is most excellent, and best for him, and also mo∣ued to choose the same: so as this serueth to rectifie the for∣mer. Hence it commeth to passe that their chiefest care is for their soules, and for the eternall saluation thereof: for the furthering whereof they can be content as need requireth, to 1 Cor. 9. 27. beat downe their body, to 2 Cor. 11. 27. denie them sometimes their or∣dinary refreshing by food, rest, and other like meanes, yea and to Heb. 11. 36, 37. suffer them to be imprisoned, racked, and otherwaies tor∣tured, and life it selfe to be taken from them. This men doe, Non propterea quisquam di∣cendus est non diligere salu∣tem, atque in∣columitatem corporis sui, quia amplius aliquid diligit: nam aarus &c. Aug. de doct. Chr. lib. 1. cap. 25. and suffer, not for want of naturall affection, but by reason of spirituall affection which perswades them that it is good for them it should be so, A man is not therefore to be said not to loue the health and safety of his body because he loueth some∣thing more. For a couetous man though he loue his money, yet he can be content to part with it for bread to nourish his body: so a spirituall man though he loue his life, yet he can be content to lose it for his soules saluation. For he loueth himselfe sufficiently, who doth his best to enioy the chiefest and truest good. This spirituall affection extendeth it selfe as Ille so satis dili∣git qui sedulo agit vt summo & vero per∣fruatur bono. Aug. de mor. eccl. l. 1. c. 26. farre as, naturall affection, namely to wiues, husbands, chil∣dren, parents, brethren, cosins, friends, &c. Much is this vrged and pressed in the Scriptures, as Isa. 55. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 6. 19, 20, 33. Ioh. 6. 27. 1 Tim. 6. 11, 19. §. 59. Of euill selfe-loue. The selfe-loue which is euill swerueth in the Obiect. Measure.   1. In the Obiect, when it is cast vpon our corruptions, our lusts, our euill humors: when we affect and loue them, and for them pursue whatsoeuer may satisfie them: as the ambiti∣ous, lustfull, riotous, gluttonous, and other like persons. This is expresly forbidden, Make not prouision for the flesh to fulfill Rom. 13. 14. the lusts thereof. 2. In the Measure, when our loue is wholly and only cast
vpon our selues, so seeking our owne good, as we regard no mans good but our owne: nor care what dammage another receiueth, so we may get aduantage thereby. This is also for∣bidden: Phil. 2. 21. 1 Cor. 13. 5. & 10. 24. for it is contrary to the property of true loue, which seeketh not her owne, namely to the preiudice of another. This hath the title of . Selfe-loue appropriated to it. It sprang from the corruption of nature, and is daily increased by the insti∣gation of Satan for the destruction of mankinde. It mani∣festeth it selfe by the many tricks of deceit which most men vse in their dealings with others: by making aduantage of others necessities as in the case of vsurie, of raising corne, and other commodities in time of scarcity, with the like: by mens backwardnesse to helpe such as stand in need of their succour: by want of compassion in other mens miseries: and by many other like vnkindnesses: all which verifie the prouerbe, Euery man for himselfe. But by distinguishing the forenamed points we may see that notwithstanding euill self-loue be a most detestable vice, yet it is both lawfull and commendable to loue ones selfe aright. §. 60. Of the error of Stoicks in condemning all passion. The doatage of Stoicks who would haue all naturall af∣fection 1. Vse. rooted out of man, is contrary to this patterne, and vn∣worthy to finde any entertainment among Christians: for what doe they aime at, but to root that out of man, which God hath planted in him, and to take away the meanes which God hath vsed for the better preseruation of man? That wise man whom they frame to themselues is worse then a brute beast: he is a very stocke and blocke. Not only the best and wisestmen that euer were in the world, but also Christ him∣selfe had those passions and affections in him, which they ac∣count vnbeseeming a wise man. Their doatage hath long since beene hissed out of the schooles of Philosophers, should it then finde place in Christs Church? §. 61. Of well vsing naturall affection. Let vs labour to cherish this naturall affection in vs, and to 2. Vse. turne it to the best things, euen to such as are not only appa∣rently, but indeed good: and among good things to such as are most excellent, and the most necessary: such as concerne
our soules, and eternall life. For this end we must pray to haue our vnderstandings inlightned (that we may discerne Phil. 1. 10. things that differ, and approue that which is excellent) and to haue our wills and affections sanctified, that we embrace, pursue, and delight in that which we know to be the best. Thus shall our naturall affection be turned into a spirituall af∣fection. Here we see how we may make nature a schoolemaster vnto vs: for as Christ sendeth vs to the fowles of the aire, and lillies Mat. 6. 26, 28. of the field to learne of them, so the Apostle here sendeth vs to our owne naturall instinct. We cannot complaine that we haue no schoolemaster neere vs (as many in the country whose children for want of one are rudely brought vp) our selues are schoolemasters to our selues. Wherfore as the Apo∣stle hereby teacheth husbands to loue their wiues, so let vs all more generally learne to loue one another: for 1 Cor. 12. 12. we are all mutuall members of one and the same body: and our brother or neighbour is Isa. 58. 7. Our flesh. §. 62. Of Mans forbearing to wrong himselfe. EPHES. 5. 29. For no man euer yet hated his owne flesh: but nourisheth and cherisheth it. THe first particle (for) sheweth that in this verse an euidence and manifestation of a mans loue of himselfe is giuen. The first part thereof, which is set downe negatiuely, shew∣eth that It is against the common instinct of nature for a man to hate Doctr. himselfe. It is noted as an euidence that deuils were in the Gadarene, in that he cut himselfe with stones: had not the de∣uils Mar. 5. 5. forced him, he would neuer haue done it. Hatred is contrary to loue: it being therefore before pro∣ued Reason. that euery man by nature loueth himselfe, by necessary consequence it followeth, that no man hateth his flesh: for two contrary effects proceed not from the same cause: no foun∣taine can yeeld both salt water and fresh. Iam. 3. 12. Obiect. Many doe macerate their bodies with fastings, watchings, labours, trauels, and the like: others teare and gash
their flesh with whips, kniues, swords, yea and with their teeth also: others lay such violent hands vpon themselues, as they take away their owne liues. Answ. 1. None of these things are done by the instinct of nature which God hath set in man, but through the corruption of nature which the deuill hath caused. Now nature and cor∣ruption of nature are two contrarie causes: no maruell then that contrarie effects come from them. 2. They thinke they doe these things in loue to themselues; as superstitious persons to merit saluation, by macerating their bodie: others to free themselues from ignominie, penurie, slauerie, torment, or such like euils: so as there is an apparent good that maketh them so to doe, and not simply hatred of themselues. They that so doe, are either possessed with a De∣uill, or blinded in their minde, or bereaued of their wits, or ouerwhelmed with some passion, so as they know not what they doe: they doe it not therefore in hatred. 2. Obiect. Holy and wise men deliberately, and on good aduice, haue beaten downe their bodies, and yeelded their liues 1 Cor. 9. 27. Heb. 11. 35. &c. to be taken away, not accepting deliuerance. Answ. That was farre from hatred, and in great loue to them∣selues, as was shewed §. 56. before. §. 63. Of vnnaturall practises against ones selfe. The forenamed doctrine discouereth many practises vsed 1 Vse. by sundry men to be against nature, and in that respect most horrible and detestable. 1. The practise of the idolatrous Baalites, who to moue their I doll to heare them, cut themselues with kniues and lancers, till 1 King. 18. 28. Cassian. Collat. 19. the bloud gushed out vpon them. Not much vnlike to whom are Popish Eremites, Anchorites, Monks flagellants, Grandimon∣tenses, sundrie sorts of Franciscans, and other Friers, whereof D. Willet Sy∣nops. Papism. Contr. 6. quaest. 6. some weare shirts of haire-cloth, some shirts of maile next their bodie, some goe bare-foot, some daily whip themselues till bloud follow, and some waste their bodies with lying hard, watching, fasting, going on pilgrimage, &c. 2. The practise of Gluttons, Drunkards, vnchaste and volup∣tuous persons, who to satisfie their corrupt humours, impaire their health, pull diseases vpon them, and shorten their dayes.
3. The practise of Swaggerers, who by quarrels cause their flesh to be wounded, and their liues taken away. Among these may be reckoned such as bring themselues to great straits, di∣stresses, and dangers for lucre sake: and they who by felonie, treason, and the like euill deeds, cast themselues vpon the sword of the Magistrate. 4. The practise of them that giue the reines to griefe, feare, wrath, and other like violent passions, so as thereby they wea∣ken their bodies, and shorten their dayes. 5. The practise of selfe-murtherers: who herein breake the rule of loue (as thy selfe) and end their dayes in a most horrible Matth. 22. 39. sinne, depriuing themselues of the time, place, and meanes of repentance: so as, whatsoeuer fond pretence they make for their sinne, little better can be thought of them, then that they thrust their soules headlong into hell, vnlesse the Lord betwixt the act done, and the expiration of their breath, extraordina∣rily touch their hearts. Religion, nature, sense, and all abhorre this fearefull fact: so as not only those who haue beene enlight∣ned —Quam vellent aethere in alto, Nunc & pau∣periem, & du∣ros perferre la∣bores. Uirg. Aen. 6. by Gods word, but also the Heathen, who had no other then the light of nature, haue adiudged it to be a most despe∣rate sinne. §. 64. Of haters of others. 2. By that affection which nature moueth men to beare to their flesh, we may see how nature more preuailes with men, then conscience and obedience to Gods word, yea then the 2. Vse. Spirit: for where nature keepeth all men from hating their owne flesh, nothing can keepe many husbands from hating their wiues, and wiues their husbands; nor brothers, cosens, & neighbours (yet these are our owne flesh) no nor many of those Isa. 58. 7. who professe themselues to be of the mysticall bodie of Christ, from hating one another. What shall we say of these? Is na∣ture of greater power, and more mightie in operation then the Spirit? Surely, such either deceiue themselues and others, in pretending to be members of the bodie of Christ: or else the Spirit is verie weake in them, and the flesh beareth a great sway. Let haters of their brethren thinke of this and bee ashamed.
§. 65. Of mans care in prouiding and vsing things needfull for his bodie. The second euidence of that loue which a man beareth to himselfe, is noted in two such branches (nourisheth and cheri∣sheth) as comprize See §. 55. all needfull things vnder them, so as the Apostle implieth thereby, that Nature teacheth all men to prouide such things as are needfull for Doctr. them: needfull for life, as food: and needfull for health, as appa∣rell. Nature is here propounded as a Schoolemaster to Chri∣stians: this therefore which nature teacheth is a bounden dutie. It is much insisted vpon by Salomon, who in this respect Eccl. 2. 24. & 3. 13. & 5. 18. & 8. 15. saith, It is good and comely for one to eat and drinke, and enioy the good of all his labour. If he be worse then an Infidell that prouideth not for his 1 Tim. 5. 8. Inconcussa na∣turae lege diligi∣mus nos ipsos, quae in bestias etiam promul∣gata est. Aug. de Doct. Chr. li. 1. ca. 26. owne, what is he that prouideth not for himselfe? euen worse then a beast: for nature hath taught the bruit beasts to nourish and cherish themselues. If any thinke that it more befitteth beasts, or naturall men then Saints, let them tell me which of the Saints at any time guided by Gods Spirit, hath wholly neglected himselfe. To omit all others, it is expresly noted of Christ, that as there was occasion, he Mat. 8. 24. slept, he Luke 14. 1. eat, he Iohn 4. 6. re∣sted, and otherwise refreshed himselfe. Obiect. Though he were Ioh. 4. 31. &c. hungry, and meat prepared for him, yet he refused to eat. Answ. 1. Forbearing one meale, is no great hinderance of Lawfull fasts no hinderance to the cheri∣shing of the body. cherishing the body. 2. Extraordinarie and weightie occasions may lawfully make a man a little neglect himselfe: that so he may shew he preferreth Gods glorie, and his brothers saluation, before the outward nourishing of his body: to which purpose Christ saith, My meat is to doe the will of him that sent me: that is, I Iohn 4. 34. preferre it before my meat. And Saint Paul saith, I will very 2 Cor. 12. 15. gladly be spent for your soules. We must here therefore take heed of the extremes on both hands. 1. Of vndue, and ouermuch neglecting our bodies, so as the strength of them be wasted, and the health impaired. 2. Of too much caring for it, so as vpon no occasion we will
lose a meales meat, or a nights rest. Fasting and watching as occasion requireth, are bounden duties. But to returne to the point of nourishing and cherishing our flesh. 1. For this end hath God prouided food, apparell, and all 1. Reason. things needfull for our weake bodies, that they should be nou∣rished and cherished thereby: not to vse them therefore, is to refuse Gods prouidence. 2. By well nourishing and cherishing our bodies, they are the better enabled to doe that worke and seruice which God appointeth to be done: but by neglecting them, they are dis∣abled thereto. As this is a motiue, so ought it to be an end whereat we aime in nourishing and cherishing our bodies. §. 66. Of them that neglect to cherish their bodies. Against this good instinct of nature doe many offend. Use. 1. Couetous misers, who so doat vpon their wealth, and so 1. Couetous misers. delight in abundance of goods treasured vp, as they afford not themselues things needfull to nourish and cherish their bodies. Salomon doth much taxe such: of them he saith, that riches are Eccl. 2. 23. & 5. 11, 12, 13, 14. kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. Daily experience giueth euidence to the truth thereof: for, beside that such men make their riches 1 Tim. 6. 9. to be snares, and Mark. 10. 23, &c. hinderances, to keepe them from eternall life; they make this present life to be very irk∣some, Eccl. 2. 23. filling their heads full of much carking care, and kee∣ping them from quiet rest. Many in this case are so besotted, Semper eget li∣quidis, semper abundat aquis. Ouid. in Jbin. as, though they haue abundance, yet they will not in health af∣ford themselues a good meales meat, nor seemly apparell: nor in sicknesse, needfull physicke, no nor fire, and such like com∣mon things. Their case is worse then theirs who want: for others will pitie and succour such as want, but who will pitie and succour such? 2. Such as are too intentiue vpon their businesses, euen the af∣faires 2. They who are too inten∣tiue on their calling. of their lawfull callings (for in good things there may be excesse) herein many Students, Preachers, Lawyers, Trades∣men, Farmers, Labourers, and others offend, when they afford not seasonable times of refreshing and resting to their bodies, but fast, watch, and toile too much in their calling. They who by such meanes disable themselues, doe make themselues
guiltie of the neglect of so much good as they might haue done, if they had nourished and cherished their bodies. Some are so eager on their businesse, that they thinke all the time mis∣pent, which is spent in nourishing and cherishing their bo∣dies; and thereupon wish, that their bodies needed no food, sleepe, or other like meanes of refreshing. These thoughts and Vnlawfull to desire that our bodies needed no refreshing. desires are foolish and sinfull in many respects, as 1. In manifesting a secret discontent and grudging against Gods prouidence, who hath thus disposed our estate for the clearer manifestation of mans weaknes, & Gods care ouer him. 2. In taking away occasions of calling vpon God, and gi∣uing praise vnto him. For if we stood not in such need of Gods prouidence, should we so oft pray vnto him for his bles∣sing: if by the good meanes which he affordeth vnto vs we felt not the sweetnesse and comfort of his prouidence, should we be so thankfull to him? 3. In taking away the meanes of mutuall loue: for if by rea∣son of our weaknesse we stood not in need of succour and help one from another, what triall would there be of our loue? 3. Such as sever these two duties of nature (nourishing and 3. They who make excesse in one need∣full thing, an hinderance to another. cherishing) and make them an hinderance one to another: some so nourish their bodies, as they cannot cherish them; that is, they spend so much in eating and drinking, as they haue no∣thing to cloath themselues withall. Others so cherish them, as they cannot nourish them; that is, they so prancke vp them∣selues with braue apparell aboue their abilitie, as they haue not competent food for themselues. These fall into two contrarie extremes: into the excesse in one thing: and into the defect in another. §. 67. Of contentment in that which is sufficient. As the Apostle by naming these two (nourish, cherish) shew∣eth that both of them are needfull, so by naming them only, and no more but them, he sheweth that they two are sufficient: whence we learne, that Hauing food and raiment, we must be therewith content. Doct. The Apostle in these very words laieth downe this doctrine in 1 Tim. 6. 8. another place. The Prou. 30. 8. praier of Agur, and the tenour of the Matth. 6. 11. fourth Petition proue as much.
Quest. Is a man then strictly bound to care for no more then food to nourish, and apparell to cherish him? Answ. So this nourishing and cherishing be extended to that estate wherein God hath set vs, to the charge which God hath giuen vs, and to the calling which he hath appointed un∣to vs, we ought to care for no more. Let vs therefore take heed of that excesse which ariseth from the corruption of nature, and content our selues with that com∣petency which nature requireth. §. 68. Of Christs forbearing to hate the Church. EPHES. 6. 29. Euen as the Lord the Church. THis confirmation of the patterne of a mans selfe by a like patterne of the Lord, hath relation to both the parts of the manifestation of a mans loue to himselfe: both to the ne∣gatiue, and so it sheweth, that The Lord hateth not his Church. And to the affirmatiue, and so it sheweth, that The Lord nourisheth and cherisheth his Church. That difference which is made betwixt Esau a type of the world (Esau haue I hated) and Iaakob a type of the Church Mal. 1. 2, 3. (Iaakob haue I loued) sheweth that the Lord is farre from ha∣ting his Church. The world, not the Church, is the obiect of Gods hatred. Obiect. The Deut. 1. 27. Church her selfe, and the & 9. 28. enemies thereof oft conceiue by Christs dealing with her, that he hateth her. Answ. It is the flesh abiding in them that are of the Church which maketh them so to conceiue, not the spirit: and in the enemies of the Church the flesh altogether reigneth. But the things of God, and his minde and affection, nor can, nor may be iudged by carnall eies, eies of flesh. The Heb. 12. 6. Spirit of God ac∣counteth such things euidences of Gods Ioue, which flesh iudgeth to be tokens of hatred; namely, corrections. It is not, because there is no matter of hatred in the Church, Reason. that Christ hateth it not: for by nature all are of one and the same cursed stocke, Ephes. 2. 3. children of wrath: and after our sanctifi∣cation is begun, the flesh abiding in vs, we daily giue much
occasion of hatred if Christ should take that aduantage against vs which he might: but it is that neere vnion which Christ hath made betwixt himselfe and the Church that keepeth him from hating her: he hath made her his Spouse, and he will not hate his Spouse: all the occasion of hatred that she giueth, he will either wipe away or couer. Admirable is the comfort which euery true member of the 1. Vse. Comfort. Catholike Church may reape from hence: for so long as the wrath and hatred of the Lord is turned from vs, nothing can make vs miserable: we may in this respect reioyce not only in prosperitie, but also in all manner of affliction. No calamitie can moue Christ to hate his Church, but rather the more to pittie it, as we doe our bodies. Nay, though by sinne he be prouoked, and see it needfull to correct his Church, yet in loue, not in hatred, in mercy, not in wrath will he correct it. What now if all the world have vs? Seeing Christ hateth 2. Use. In courage∣ment. vs not, we need not feare nor care. The subiect which is sure of his Kings fauour, little regardeth the hatred of others. This therefore is to be thought of, both to comfort vs vnder the crosse, and to encourage vs against the hatred of the world. That none may peruert this comfortable doctrine, let me adde two caueats. 1. That men deceiue not themselues with a naked name, thinking themselues to be of the Church, when they are only in it, Ier. 12. 8. such may Christ hate. 2. That being of the Church they waxe not insolent, and too much prouoke Christ to anger: for though he hate not such, yet in wisdome he may so seuerely correct them as if he hated them: and make them repent their folly and insolencie againe and againe. §. 69. Of Christs nourishing and cherishing his Church. 2. That The Lord nourisheth and cherisheth his Church, is euident by his continuall prouidence ouer her in all ages. When first he created man, he Gen. 1. 28, 29. prouided before hand all things needfull to nourish and cherish him. When he was mo∣ued to destroy the earth and all liuing things thereon, he had care of his Church, and prouided an Arke to keepe her out of Gen. 6. 14. 21. the waters, and stored vp in the Arke all things needfull for
her. When he purposed to bring a famine on the world, he sent a man before hand to lay vp prouision for his Church. When Gen. 45. 7. Exo. 16. 15. and 17. 6. his Church was in a barren and drie wildernesse, he gaue them bread from heauen, water out of the rocke, and kept their rai∣ment from waxing old, and their feet from swelling. After this Deut. 8. 4. he brought his Church into a land flowing with milke and honie: and so long as it remained faithfull he preserued it in that pleasant and plentifull land. Thus he dealt with the Church in her non-age: and thus also hath he dealt with her in her riper age vnder the Gospell, as experience of all ages may witnesse. Neither hath he only nourished and cherished her with temporall blessings, but also with all needfull spiri∣tuall blessings: his word and Sacraments, his Spirit and the graces thereof hath he in all ages giuen her for that purpose: yea with his owne flesh and bloud hath he fed her, and with Ioh. 6. 55. his owne righteousnesse hath he clothed her. Isa. 61. 10. Learne we of whom we receiue all needfull things, both 1. Vse. spirituall and temporall, for soule and bodie, that accordingly Ascribe all to Christ. we may giue him the praise of all. And let vs not be like the vngratefull Israelites who Ezek. 20. 11, 12. regarded not the meanes of spi∣rituall Ose. 8. 12. nourishment, and Ier. 44. 17. Ose. 2. 5, 8. ascribed the meanes of their tempo∣rall nourishing and cherishing to their Idols. In this respect the Prophet maketh them Isa. 1. 3. worse then the oxe, and the asse, two of the most bruitish beasts that be. Oh take we heed that the like be not vpbraided to vs. The Lord hath not sparing∣ly, but most liberally and bountifully nourished and cherished vs in this land, and that both with temporall and spirituall blessings, so as he may iustly say, what could haue beene done Isa. 5. 4. more in my vineyard, that I haue not done in it? Learne we also to depend on Christ for all things that we 2 Vse. want: we need not feare penurie: though we haue not that Depend on Christ for all things. plentie which we could wish, yet we shall haue sufficiencie. Christ will not suffer his Church to famish for want of food, nor starue for want of cloathing, whether temporall for body, or spirituall for soule. He that can and will performe it hath said, I will neuer leaue thee nor forsake thee. Lazarus was not Heb. 13. 5. forsaken; witnesse the Angels that caried his soule into Abra∣hams Luk. 16. 22. bosome. If any of Christs Church doe perish for want
of outward meanes, it is because Christ by that meanes will aduance them to that place where they shall stand in need of nothing: so as he doth not forsake them. §. 70. Of the vnion betwixt Christ and the Saints. EPHES. 5. 30. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. THe reason of the forenamed loue of Christ, and fruits Inference. thereof to his Church, is here laid downe, as both the causall particle (FOR) and the inference of this verse vpon the former doe shew. This reason is that neere vnion which is betwixt Christ and his Church, set forth by a metaphor of the members of our bodie. Whereby he implieth, that though there were no other reason to moue an husband to loue his wife then the neere vnion which is betwixt them (they being Vers. 23. one bodie, Vers. 31. one flesh, Vers. 28. one selfe) that were enough, for thereby only is Christ moued to loue his Church. The mysterie of our spirituall vnion with Christ is here laid downe, and that as fully, and distinctly (though very suc∣cinctly) Summe, as in any place of Scripture. I will endeuour to open it as plainly as I can. We are] The Apostle here changeth both person and num∣ber: . Paul ranketh himselfe a∣mong the members of Christ. for before he spake of the Church as of another in the third person, and of one in the singular number: but here he speaketh of the same in the first person including himselfe, and in the plurall number, including all others like himselfe (elect of God, and Saints by calling) whereby he giueth vs to vnderstand what he meaneth by the Church, namely the companie of Saints, to which, though he were a Preacher of the Gospell, an extra∣ordinarie Preacher, an Apostle, he associateth and ioyneth himselfe: noting thereby that he was made partaker of the same grace, and saued by the same meanes that others were. Well might he in this priuiledge not thinke much to ranke himselfe, because it is the highest degree of honour that can be Obser. to be a member of the bodie of Christ: much more then to be a Preacher, a Prophet, an Apostle, or of any other eminent calling.
The metaphor here vsed (members of his body) setteth Metaphors which set forth our vnion with Christ. forth the neere vnion which is betwixt Christ and the Saints. Many other metaphors are vsed in Scripture for the same pur∣pose, as 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6. foundation and edifice, Ioh. 15. 5. vine and branches, 2 Cor. 11. 2. husband and wife, with the like, which are all of them very fit, but none more proper and pertinent to the point then this of a body, the Head and members thereof. What neerer vnion can there be then betwixt the head and members of the same body? If the Apostle had here staid, we might haue thought that he had here meant no other thing then he meant Eph. 1. 23. and 4. 16. and 5. 23. before, where he stiled Christ an head, and the Church a body: but in that he addeth (Of his flesh and of his bones) he declareth yet a further mysterie. In the generall there is a difference betwixt this phrase (. OF his body) and these (OF . his flesh; and OF his bones) the former is a note of the Corporis. genetiue case, the two latter are a Ex. praeposition: for distinction sake the two latter might haue beene translated, out of his flesh, out of his bones, or from his flesh, from his bones (for so a like phrase is trans∣lated Eph. 4. 16. . before, From whom) but seeing these particles out of, or from are ambiguous, the former translation may stand as the best, so as a difference be made in the sense though there be none in the words. The former (members of his body) declareth the vnion it selfe. The latter (of his flesh and of his bones) declareth the meanes How we are of Christs flesh. of making that vnion. This latter hath relation to that which Adam said of Eue, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, (Gen. 2. 23.) which is manifest by the next verse which the Apostle taketh out of the same place. It implieth then, that as Eue was made a woman out of Adams flesh and bones, so the Church is made a Church out of Christs flesh and bones. 1. Quest. Was the very substance of the Saints, their flesh and bones taken out of Christ, as the substance of Eue was ta∣ken out of Adam? Answ. Not so, if the words be literally taken. For so may Christ rather be said to be of our flesh, and of our bones, because he tooke our nature, and that from a daughter of Adam: in
which respect he is said to be 2 Tim. 2. 8. . of the seed of Dauid, and Rom. 9. 5. . of the Iewes, as concerning the flesh. Besides, the Apostle expresly saith (vers. 32.) that This is a great mysterie. The mysterie therefore must be searched out. For this end Christ must be considered as another Adam (and so the holy Ghost stileth him 1 Cor. 15. 45, 47. The last Adam, The second man) that is, a stocke, a root that giueth a being to branches sprouting out of him. 2. Quest. What being is that which we receiue from Christ? What being we receiue from Christ. Answ. Not our naturall being (that we haue of the parents of our flesh) but a supernaturall, and spirituall being, which the Scripture termeth Tit. 3. 5. a new birth, Ephes. 4. 24. a new man, 2 Cor. 5. 17. a new creature. This spirituall being is not in regard of the substance of our soule, or bodie, or of any of the powers or parts, faculties or members of them (for all these we haue by lineall descent from Adam, and all these haue all sorts of men, as well they who are not of the Church, as they who are of it) but in regard of the integritie, goodnesse, and diuine qualities which are in them 2 Pet. 1. 4. Ephes. 4. 24. euen that holinesse and righteousnesse wherewith the Church is endued and adorned. As we are naturall men we are of Adam, as we are spirituall men we are of Christ. 3. Quest. Why is mention made of flesh and bones in this Why we are said to be of Christs flesh. Gen. 2. 23. spirituall being? Answ. 1. In allusion to the creation of Eue, that by com∣paring this with that, this might be the better conceiued. 2. In regard of the Lords Supper, where the flesh of Christ is mystically set before vs to be spirituall food vnto vs. That as before (vers. 26.) he shewed the mysterie of one Sacrament, Baptisme; here he might shew the mysterie of the other Sacra∣ment, The Lords Supper. 3. In relation to Christs humane nature, by vertue whereof we come to be vnited vnto Christ. For the diuine nature of Christ is infinite, incomprehensible, incommunicable, and Diuinitas vni∣geniti facta est particeps mor∣talitatis nostrae, vt & nos parti∣cipes eius im∣mortalitatis essemus. Aug. Epist. 57. there is no manner of proportion betwixt it and vs, so as we could not be vnited to it immediately. But Christ by taking his humane nature into the vnitie of his diuine nature, made himselfe one with vs, and vs one with him: so as by his par∣taking of our mortalitie, we are made partakers of his im∣mortalitie.
4. Quest. Are we then vnited only to his humane nature? Answ. No: we are vnited to his person, God-Man. For as We are vnited to Christs person. the diuine nature, in and by it selfe, is incommunicable; so the humane nature singly considered, in and by it selfe, is vn∣profitable. The Deitie is the fountaine of all life and grace: the flesh quickneth not: but that spirituall life which origi∣nally and primarily floweth from the Deitie, as from a foun∣taine, is by the humanitie of Christ, as by a conduit-pipe, con∣ueyed into vs. 5. Quest. How can we who are on earth, be vnited to his How Saints on earth are vnited to Christ in hea∣uen. humane nature, which is contained in the highest heauen? Answ. This vnion being supernaturall and spirituall, there needeth no locall presence for the making of it. That eternall Spirit which is in Christ is conueyed into euerie of the Saints (as the soule of a man is into euerie member and part of his bo∣die) by vertue whereof they are all made one with Christ, and with one another: by one Spirit we are all baptized into one bodie, 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. which bodie is Christ. This is to be noted against these two errours. The first is I. Error. this, We are vnited first to the diuine nature of Christ which is euerie where, and by vertue thereof to his humane nature. Answ. 1. The Deitie (as we shewed) is immediately in∣communicable: so as this cannot be. 2. Our vnion with Christ is spirituall, not physicall or na∣turall, so as this locall presence needeth not. The second errour is this, The humane nature of Christ hath all the diuine properties in it, II. Error. so as it is euerie where present, and by reason thereof we are vnited vnto Christ. Answ. This also is impossible and needlesse. The proper∣ties of a true bodie cannot possibly admit the incommunica∣ble properties of the Deitie: that implieth direct contradicti∣on, which is, that finite should be infinite. Needlesse also this is, because the vnion we speake of, is (as we said) spirituall. 6. Quest. What kinde of vnion is this spirituall vnion? Our vnion with Christ a true and reall vnion. Answ. A true, reall vnion of our persons (bodies and soules) with the person of Christ (God and man.) For as the holy Ghost did vnite in the virgins wombe the diuine and humane
natures of Christ, and made them one person, by reason wher∣of Christ is of our flesh & of our bones: so the spirit vniteth that person of Christ with our persons, by reason whereof we are of his flesh, and of his bones. A great difference there is betwixt the kindes of these vnions: for the vnion of Christs two na∣tures is hypostaticall and essentiall, they make one person: but the vnion of Christs person, and ours, is spirituall and mysticall: they make one mysticall body: yet is there no dif∣ference in the reality and truth of these vnions: our vnion with Christ is neuer a whit the lesse reall and true because it is mysticall and spirituall: they who haue the same spirit ar as truly one, as those parts which haue the same soule. The effects which proceed from this vnion doe shew the truth thereof: for that spirit which sanctified Christ in his mothers wombe sanctifieth vs also, that which quickned him quick∣neth Rom. 8. 11. Eph. 2. 6. vs, that which raised him from death, raiseth vs, that which exalted him exalteth vs. The many resemblances which the Scripture vseth to set forth this vnion, doe shew the truth thereof: but most liuely is it set forth by that resem∣blance which Christ maketh betwixt it and his vnion with his Father. I pray (saith he of all his Saints) That they may all Ioh. 17. 21, 22. be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in vs: that they may be one, as we are one. This note of com∣parison (as) is not to be taken of the kinde, but of the truth of these vnions, our vnion with Christ is as true as Christs vnion with his Father. So true is this vnion, as not only Iesus himselfe, but all the Unusquisque Christianus non incon∣gruè susti∣net personam Christi. Aug. de Gen. l. 2. c. 24. vide eundem quaest. 69. Saints which are members of this body together with Iesus the head thereof are called CHRIST, 1 Cor. 12. 12. Gal. 3. 16. This is to be noted against their conceit, who imagine this vnion to be only in imagination and conceit: or else only in consent of spirit, heart, and will: or at the most, in participati∣on of spirituall graces. 7. Quest. What is the bond whereby this vnion is made: With what bonds we are vnited to Christ. 1 Joh. 4. 13. namely whereby Christ and the Saints are made one? Answ. There is a double bond, one on Christs part, euen the spirit of Christ (for hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in vs, because he hath giuen vs of his spirit) another on the
Saints part, euen faith (for Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith) Eph. 3. 17. The spirit is conueyed into vs when we are dead in sinnes, wholly flesh, but being in vs, it breedeth this blessed instru∣ment of faith whereby we lay hold on Christ, and grow into him as the science into the stocke. Thus Christ laying hold on vs by his spirit, and we on him by faith, we come to be in∣corporated into him, and made one body, as the science and stocke one tree. 8. Quest. To what end hath Christ thus truly and neerely Why Christ made the Saints one with himselfe. vnited vs vnto himselfe? Answ. Not for any benefit vnto himselfe: but meerely for the honour and good of the Church. By this vnion the ho∣nour of Christ is communicated to the Church, as the ho∣nour of an husband to his wife, and of an head to the body. Great also is the benefit which the Church reapeth thereby: for by this meanes is Christ made more fit to doe good to the Church, as an head to the body, and the Church is made more capable of receiuing good from Christ, as a body from the head, being knit to it by the soule, and by veines, sinewes, nerues, arteries, and other like ligaments. Thus hauing as plainly as I can by questions and answers laid open this great mysterie, I will further note out some of those excellent priuiledges which by vertue thereof apper∣taine to the Saints, and also some of the principall duties which in regard thereof the Saints are bound vnto. §. 71. Of the priuiledges appertaining to the Saints euen in this life by reason of their vnion with Christ. The priuiledges of the Saints which arise from their vnion with Christ respect this life, the time of death, and the life to come. In this life these, 1. A most glorious condition, which is to be a part of Christ, a 1. Saints are members of a glorious body. member of his body. All the glory of Adam in Paradise, or of the Angels in heauen is not comparable to this. In this re∣spect the Saints are said to be crowned with glory and honour, and to haue all things put vnder their feet. Compare Psal. 8. 4, 5. &c. with Heb. 2. 6, 7. &c. and ye shall finde the Apostle apply that to Christ, which the Prophet spake indefinitly of man.
Now those two places cannot be better reconciled, then by Coelo, & Ange∣lis, & omni creatura hono∣rabilior est ecclesia. Chrys. de Pentecost. serm. 26. this vnion of Christ and Saints: for seeing both make one body, which is Christ, that which is spoken of the body may be applied to the head, and that which is spoken of the head may be applied to the body: for the same honour appertai∣neth to both. In which respect the Church is more honou∣rable then Heauen, Angels, and euery other creature. 2. The attendance of good Angels, who are sent forth to mi∣nister 2. Saints at∣tended by Angels. for them who shall be heires of saluation, because those heires are of the body of Christ, who is their Lord. These are those horses, and charets of fire which were round about Elisha: Heb. 1. 14. 2 King. 6. 17. which are also round about euery of Gods Saints in all their distresses, though we see them no more then the seruant of the man of God saw them, till the Lord opened his eies. That charge which is giuen to the Angels ouer the Sonne of God to keepe him in all his waies, and to beare him in their hands lest Psal. 91. 11, 12. he dash his foot against a stone, hath relation to this body which is Christ. 3. An honour to make Christ himselfe perfect: for as the seue∣rall 3. Saints make Christ per∣fect. members make a naturall body perfect, so the seuerall Saints, this bodie which is Christ. In this respect the Church is said to be the fulnesse of him that filleth all in all. Eph. 1. 23. Christ filleth all things, and yet the Church maketh him full: which is to be vnderstood of that voluntary condition where∣unto Christ subiected himselfe, to be the head of a body: so as without the parts of the body he is imperfect, as a naturall body is maimed and imperfect if it want but the least member thereof. How can we now thinke but that he will preserue and keepe safe all his Saints? Will he restore to vs all the parts of our naturall body at the generall resurrection, and will he lose any of the parts of his owne mysticall bodie? 4. A kinde of possession of heauen while we are on earth: for 4. Saints as∣sured of salua∣tion: and how. that which the head hath a possession of, the body and seue∣rall members haue also a possession of. In this respect it is said, he hath raised vs vp together, and made vs sit together in Eph. 2. 6. heauenly places. And, he that beleeueth on him hath euerlasting Ioh. 5. 24. life: is passed from death vnto life. And, he that hath the Sonne, 1 Ioh. 5. 12. hath life. This is somewhat more then hope: and serueth ex∣ceedingly
to strengthen our hope, and giue vs assurance of that heauenly inheritance. They know not the power of God, nor the vertue of this vni∣on, who denie that the Saints haue assurance of saluation. For (to follow this metaphor a little) suppose a man were cast into a riuer, and his head able to lift and keepe it selfe aboue water, would we not say, that man is safe enough, he is aboue water. This is the case of this mysticall body: it being cast into the sea of this world, Christ the head thereof hath lift, and keepes himselfe aloft euen in heauen. Is there now any feare, any possibility of the drowning of this body, or of any member thereof? If any should be drowned, then either Christ must be drowned, or else that member pulled from Christ; both which are impossible. Thus then by vertue of this vnion we see how on Christs safety, ours dependeth: if he be safe, so are we: if we perish, so must he. In this respect yee may be secure O flesh and bloud: yee haue Securi estote caro & sanguis: vsurpastis coe∣lum in Christo: negent & in coelo Christum qui vobis coe∣lum negant. Tertul. de Resur. got heauen in Christ: they who denie heauen to you, may also denie Christ to be in heauen. Learne here how to conceiue of the resurrection, ascension and safety of Christ, euen as of the resurrection, ascension and safety of an head, in and with whom his body and all his mem∣bers are raised, exalted, and preserued. 5. A most happy kinde of regiment vnder which the Saints are: euen such an one as the members of an head are vnder. An head ruleth the body not as a cruell lord and tyrant, rigo∣rously, 5. Difference betwixt in humanely, basely, and slauishly, but meekely, gently, Christ gouer∣ning the Saints and the world. with great compassion, and fellow-feeling. Euen so doth Christ, his Church, binding vp that which is broken, hea∣ling that which is maimed, directing that which wandreth, and quickning that which is dull; which priuiledge is so much the greater because it is proper to the Church. Though he haue a golden scepter of grace and fauour to hold out to his Church (as Ahash-verosh held out his to Esther) yet he hath also Est. 5. 2. a rod of iron to breake the men of this world, and to dash them Psal. 2. 9. in peeces like a potters vessell. Though he be gone to prepare a place for his Saints, that where he is they may be also, yet will Ioh. 14 3. he make his enemies his footstoole. Psal. 110. 1.
6. An assurance of sufficient supply of all needfull things which 6. Assurance of all needfull supply. the Saints want, and of safe protection from all things hurtfull. For by reason of this vnion, Christ our head hath a sense of our want and of our smart. On this ground he said to them which fed and visited his members, Ye fed me, ye visited me: and againe, Mat. 25. 35. Act. 9. 4. to Saul that persecuted his members, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Obiect. How is it then, that the Saints want many things, Why Christ suffereth the Saints to want, and suffer. and oft suffer much smart, and hurt? Answ. Christ in his wisdome seeth it behouefull that they should want, and feele smart (and that we are to be perswaded of) or else he would not suffer them to want or feele that which they doe. Wherefore in all need, in euery distresse and danger, let vs lift vp our head to this our head. 7. A right to all that Adam lost. For Christ is the heire of all, (the 7. Saints haue a right to what Adam lost. earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof) yea as mediator and head of the Church is he heire of all: his body therfore hath a right to all. On this ground the Apostle saith, All things are Heb. 1. 2. yours. So as the Saints & only the Saints can with good consci∣ence Psal. 24 1. vse the things of this world. They who are not of this 1 Cor. 3. 21. bodie (what right and title soeuer they haue before men) are but vsurpers of the things they enioy and vse. They are like to bankrupts, who being not worth one peny, deceitfully bor∣row of others, and therewith keepe a great table, decke and furnish their houses very sumptuously, put themselues, wiues and children, into braue apparell, are frolicke and riotous: what is like to be the end of such? 8. A right to more then Adam euer had: namely, to Christ 8. Saints haue a right to Christ. See §. 28 himselfe, and to all that appertaineth vnto him: as to the pu∣ritie of his nature, to the perfection of his obedience, the me∣rit of his bloud, the power of his death, the vertue of his re∣surrection, the efficacie of his ascension, all is ours: euen as the vnderstanding, wit, iudgement, sight, hearing, and all that is in the head, is the bodies: if the Church it selfe were of it selfe as pure in nature, as perfect in righteousnesse, as powerfull ouer death, and deuill, and graue, and hell, as able to rise from death, and to ascend into heauen, as Christ, it could receiue no greater benefit thereby, then it doth by them in the person of
Christ: so truly and properly is Christ himselfe, and all things appertaining to him, the Churches. What can more be said? what can more be desired? O blessed vnion! blessed are they that haue a part therein! Quest. How is it then that the Church is so basely and mi∣serably Why the Church basely accounted of. 1 Ioh. 3. 1. respected in the world? Answ. The world knoweth vs not, because it knoweth not Christ. It knoweth not Christ the head of this body: it knoweth not the body which is Christ. Let not vs who know both head and body, the neere vnion which is betwixt them, and the priui∣ledges which follow thereupon, be danted, neither with the scoffes or scornes of the world, nor with our owne outward weaknesses, wants, and calamities. What would he that hath Christ, haue more? §. 72. Of the priuiledge of our vnion with Christ in the time of death. The priuiledge which the Saints receiue by their vnion with Christ in the time of death (euen all that time that pas∣seth from the departure of the Saints out of this world vnto the generall Resurrection) is admirable: for when body and soule are seuered one from another, neither soule nor body are separated from Christ, but both remaine vnited to him: euen as, when Christs body and soule were by death se∣uered one from another, neither his soule, nor his body were separated from the Deitie, but both remained vnited thereun∣to. This inuiolable bond that holdeth the Saints, (yea, euen their very bodies as well as their soules) vnited to Christ in death, is the benefit of a spirituall vnion. If our vnion with Christ were corporeall, it could not be so. Ob. Is it possible that the body which is dead should remaine Corruption of the body no hinderance to our vnion with Christ. vnited to Christ, when as it receiueth no vertue from him? Answ. 1. If a member of a naturall body may doe so, why not a member of the mysticall bodie? That a member of a na∣turall body may doe so, is euident by those who haue an hand, arme, foot, leg, or any other member taken, with a dead palsie: they are sometimes so taken, as those parts receiue no manner of sense, or any vigor, or life from head or heart at all: and yet remaine true members of that body.
2. The very dead bodies consumed with wormes or other∣wise, doe receiue a great present benefit from their vnion with Christ: for by vertue thereof there is a substance preserued, and they are kept from destruction: there is nothing destroied in the Saints by death, but that which if it were not destroied, would make them most miserable, namely sinne: that is vt∣terly, totally, finally destroied in them, and all the concomi∣tances thereof, which are all manner of infirmities: but the rotting of the body, is but as the rotting of corne in the earth, 1 Cor. 15. 36. that it may arise a more glorious bodie. The metaphor of sleepe, 1 Thes 4. 13. attributed to the Saints when they die, sheweth that their bo∣dies are not vtterly destroied. Obiect. The bodies of all men, euen of those that are not Difference be∣twixt the pre∣seruation of the Saints bodies and others in the graue. of this vnion, are preserued from vtter destruction. This there∣fore is no benefit of our vnion with Christ. Answ. Though in the generall thing it selfe, which is a pre∣seruation of the substance of the body, the same thing befal∣leth the Saints and the wicked: yet the meanes whereby both are preserued, and the end why they are preserued is farre dif∣ferent. 1. The Saints are preserued by a secret influence procee∣ding 1 Thes. 4. 14, 16. from Christ, as an head: in which respect they are said to sleepe in Iesus, and to be dead in Christ. But the wicked are re∣serued by an Almightie power of Christ, as a terrible Lord and seuere Iudge. 2. The bodies of the Saints are preserued to enioy eternall glory together with their soules: but the bodies of the wicked are reserued to be tormented in hell. In regard of these differēces, the graue is as a bed to the Saints, Isa. 57. 2. for them quietly to sleepe therein free from all disturbance till the day of resurrection: but it is a prison to the wicked to hold them fast against the great Day of Assise, that at Doomes day they may be brought to appeare at the barre of Gods iudge∣ment seat, and there receiue the sentence of condemnation. §. 73. Of the priuiledge of our vnion with Christ after death. The priuiledge which the Saints by vertue of their vnion with Christ receiue after death, farre surpasseth all before. It may be drawne to two heads.
1. Their Resurrection. 2. Their glory in heauen. That which was before said of the difference betwixt the preseruation of the bodies of the Saints and wicked in death, may be applied to the difference of their Resurrection. Resurrection simply in it selfe is not the priuiledge of the Saints, but Resurrection of life: to the wicked appertaineth the Ioh. 5. 29. Resurrection of condemnation. The benefit of Resurrection ari∣seth from the glory which followeth therupon in heauen. That glory hath the Apostle excellently set forth §. 49, 50. &c. before vers. 27. §. 74. Of the duties which are required of the Saints by ver∣tue of their union with Christ. The mysterie of our vnion with Christ, as it is a matter of great comfort, and incouragement (which ariseth from the forenamed priuiledges) so also is it a matter of direction and instigation vnto vs for the performing of sundry duties, where∣of they who desire assurance of the forenamed priuiledges, and comfort by them, must be carefull and conscionable. Some of the most principall of those duties are these. 1. Confidence in Christ. Christ being our head, so mighty, Heb. 3. 6. so wise, so tender, euery way so sufficient an head as he is, we should highly dishonour him, if we should not wholly and only repose our selues vpon him for euery good thing, and against euery euill. 2. Subiection answerable to his manner of gouerning vs. Mat. 6. 10. Christus habet sanctos volun∣tate, peccatores verò necessitate sibi subiectos. The world is subiect to Christ perforce, as he is an absolute and Almighty Lord: but he gouerning vs as an head, we must be subiect vnto him as members, willingly, and readily. What member will rise vp, and rebell against the head? yea, what member is not as ready to obey, as the head to command? Hier. in Eph. 1. 3. A cleansing of our selues from all filthinesse of flesh and 2 Cor. 7. 1. spirit. Shall we defile the members of Christ? The sinnes of the 1 Cor. 6. 15. Saints are in this respect the more hainous because that body, euen Christ, whereof they are members, is defiled thereby. Wherefore in regard of Christ the head, of other Saints their fellow members, and of themselues, must all that professe themselues to be of this bodie be watchfull ouer them∣selues, and cleanse themselues from all filthinesse. Other∣wise
they giue iust occasion to thinke that they are no mem∣bers of this bodie. If a Lions foot, or Beares paw were held out, and said to be the member of a man, would any beleeue it? Can we then thinke that worldlings, drunkards, profane, rio∣tous, vncleane persons, and such like limbs of the Deuill, are members of Christ? 4. A conformitie vnto the image of Christ in true holinesse Ephes. 4. 24. and righteousnesse. It is not therefore sufficient for the mem∣bers of Christ to abstaine from polluting themselues, for they are created in Christ Iesus vnto good works. He that abideth in Ephes. 210. me (saith Christ) and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. Ioh. 15. 5. 5. Heauenly affections. If ye be risen with Christ, seeke those things which are aboue, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of Col. 3. 1, 2. God. Set your affections on things aboue, and not on things on the earth. Where our head is, there also ought our heart to be. Earthly affections come not from that head which is in hea∣uen: nor from that Spirit which proceedeth from him. They Rom. 8. 5. who are after the spirit minde the things of the spirit. 6. Courage against death: seeing that in death we are Christs, what cause haue we to feare death? Be not afraid of Luke 12. 4. them that kill the body, and after that, haue no more that they can doe. The ancient worthies would not accept deliuerance, that Heb. 11. 35. they might obtaine a better resurrection. Hitherto of the vnion it selfe. The meanes of effecting it, remaine to be handled. § 75. Of their regeneration who are members of Christ. EPHES. 5. 30. —Of his flesh, and of his bones. This clause declareth the meanes whereby we come to be members of Christ, namely by receiuing a new being from Christ, which is to be, not of the flesh, and of the bones of Adam, but of the flesh and of the bones of Christ, which be∣ing spiritually taken, as hath beene expounded §. 70. before, shew∣eth that They who are true members of Christ body, are truly regene∣rate. Doct. If any be in Christ he is a new creature: these words are so 2 Cor. 5. 17. . laid downe by the Apostle, as they serue both for a demon∣stration, and an exhortation (he is, or let him be a new creature)
neither is expressed, but either, or both may be vnderstood. As many of you as have been baptized into Christ (that is, made Gal. 3. 27. members of this body) haue put on Christ, (that is, haue beene borne againe) the first branch noteth out our incorporation into Christ, the latter our regeneration. This second man, and last Adam Christ Iesus is a quickning Reason. spirit: he diffuseth life and grace into all his members: if his 1 Cor. 15. 45. Rom. 8. 11. spirit be in vs, it will quicken our mortall bodies. If the head of our naturall bodies conueigh sense into all our members: if the root of a tree diffuse sap into all the branches: shall not Christ much more giue life to all his members? This then is a matter of triall, whereby we may proue whe∣ther Vse. indeed we are of this body or no, and so haue a true right Triall whether we be mem∣bers of Christ. to the forenamed priuiledges. Many boast of this honour that they are members of Christs body, and yet are not of his flesh and of his bones: they haue no other being, then what they receiued from their parents. These vaine professors are like woodden legs, or armes on a man, which may be couered ouer with hose and sleeues for a time, but shall not be raised at the resurrection with the other parts of the mans body: so nei∣ther shall those professors be raised to glory with Christ, though they may be couered ouer with the hose and sleeues of profession, and thereby seeme to be members. §. 76. Of the author of our regeneration Christ. This relatiue particle (HIS) twice repeated (of HIS flesh, . and of HIS bones) sheweth that Regeneration is of Christ. Ioh. 5. 21. The Sonne quickneth whom he will. Doctr. Object. This worke is attributed in Scripture to the 1 Pet. 1. 3. Fa∣ther, to the Ioh. 3. 5. Spirit, to the Iam. 1. 18. word, and to the 1 Cor. 4. 15. Ministers of the word. Answ. Christ may very well stand with all these. The three persons in Trinitie are all one: One in nature and essence: Philem. vers. 10. The worke of the three per∣sons in our re∣generation. One in will and consent: One in vertue and power: what the one doth the other doth also. Yet because there is a difference in their manner of working, this worke (as other workes) is distinctly attributed to each of them. The Father is (as I may so speake) the beginner of this
worke. His will it was that his Sonne should be the head of a bodie, and that there should members be made fit for that head, and haue a new being (of his owne will begat he vs) for Iam. 1. 18. this end he sent his Sonne into the world to be made flesh. The Sonne put in execution the will of his Father: he tooke flesh vpon him, that we might be of his flesh. Thus saith Christ of himselfe, I came downe from heauen to doe the will of him that Joh. 6. 38, 39. sent me; And this is the Fathers will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath giuen me I should lose nothing, but should raise it vp againe at the last day. The Spirit applieth vnto vs the vertue and efficacie of the flesh of Christ, and so finisherh this blessed worke. It is the Spirit that quickneth: the flesh profiteth nothing, Ioh. 6. 63. namely, of it selfe without the Spirit. Thus we see that the applying of this worke of regenerati∣on vnto Christ, excludeth not the worke of the Father, or of the Holy Ghost therein, but excludeth the worke of man: so as it is not of our selues, nor of our parents, nor of any other man: for we are borne not of bloud, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God: in which respect our new birth Ioh. 1. 13. is said to be . from aboue. Obiect. How is it then attributed to the word, and to the Ioh. 3. 3. ministerie of man? How regene∣ration is attri∣buted to the word, and to Ministers thereof. Answ. As vnto instruments which the Lord is pleased to vse: Of the word it is said, God hath begotten vs with the word: of himselfe a Minister thus saith the Apostle, In Christ Iesus I haue begotten you: so as God and Christ are ioyned Iam. 1. 18. with these instruments, or else they are no whit powerfull and 1 Cor. 4. 15. effectuall for so great a worke: for neither is he that planteth any 1 Cor. 3. 7. thing, nor he that watreth: but God that giueth the increase. The worke of regeneration is a new creation, a diuine Reason. worke, aboue humane straine. It must therefore be wrought by the Lord, or it cannot be wrought at all. This is to be noted both of those that haue not yet assurance Use. of this blessed worke wrought in them: and also of those who haue assurance thereof. The former may here learne whither to haue recourse for it: namely, to him who came downe from heauen for that pur∣pose, and who saith, Him that commeth vnto me I will in no wise Ioh. 6. 37.
cast out. In all the meanes that we vse, let vs looke vp vnto him, and seeke a blessing of him. The latter must with the tenth leper returne backe vnto Luke 17. 16. Christ, and glorifie God. Whatsoeuer the meanes were, or whosoeuer the Minister was, the praise and glorie of all must be giuen to him. §. 77. Of the matter of our regeneration, Christ. The preposition (OF) twice set downe (OF his flesh, and . OF his bones) being a proper note of the materiall cause, shew∣eth that Christ is not only the author, but the matter also of our new birth. The new spirituall being which the Saints haue, com∣meth out of him. Col. 2. 19. . From him all the bodie hauing nourish∣ment increaseth with the increase of God. In this respect we are said to be Ephes. 1. 3. blessed with all spirituall blessings in Christ. The metaphor of a Joh 15. 5. vine, which Christ taketh vnto himselfe, pro∣ueth also as much: so doe these phrases, Ioh. 6. 55. My flesh is meat indeed, my bloud is drinke indeed. This Christ commeth to be by his incarnation. God in himselfe is as a bottomlesse and a closed fountaine: from him Reason. immediately we can receiue nothing. But Christ made flesh is Zach. 13. 1. a fountaine opened: Col. 1. 19. In him all fulnesse dwelleth. Ioh. 1. 16. And of him haue all we receiued, euen grace for grace. Behold here the benefit of Christs incarnation: by his ta∣king 1 Vse: part of our mortall flesh, are we made partakers of his spirituall flesh, namely, of that spirituall life and grace which commeth from him, who was made flesh, to conuey the same into vs. To strengthen our faith the more firmly herein, the Lord hath instituted the holy Communion of his bodie and bloud. With what conscience, reuerence, and confidence, ought this blessed Sacrament to be celebrated? By this Doctrine we may further learne how to seeke euery 2. Vse. thing at Gods hands which we desire to obtaine, and how to offer that sacrifice of praise vnto God, which wee would haue Ioh. 16. 23. to be accepted; namely in and through Iesus Christ, by whom Heb. 13. 15. only we haue all that communion which we haue with God. Col. 3. 17. Well therefore doth the Church conclude all her formes of
Prayers and Praises with this, or such a like clause, through Ie∣sus Christ our Lord. §. 78. Of the excellency of Regeneration. The particular matter of our regeneration (the flesh and bones of Christ) here expressed, sheweth that Regeneration is a most excellent worke. The excellencie hereof Doctr. will the better appeare, if we compare it with the great and glorious worke of our creation, and shew how farre it surpas∣seth it: wherein I will hold close to this metaphor, and touch Difference betwixt rege∣neration and creation. no other differences then it doth point out vnto vs. 1. In our creation Christ was only a worker: but he is the verie matter of our Regeneration, we are of his flesh. 2. The relation that then was betwixt Christ and man, was Creator, but here Head, We are members of his bodie. Creature,   Bodie,     The bond is now much neerer. 3. The being which then we had, was from Adam: But the being which now we haue is from Christ, of HIS flesh. 4. That being was but naturall. This is spirituall: for that Ioh. 3. 6. which is borne of the Spirit, is Spirit. 5. Then our being was different from Christs: but now it is the verie same with Christs, Of his flesh. 6. Then might man cleane fall from that estate wherein he was created (as he did) and yet Christ remaine as he was. Now it cannot be so. For if any of the Saints now fall away, either Christ must fall with them, or they must be pulled from Christ, and so Christ remaine a maimed bodie. Behold the riches of Gods mercie. One might thinke it The riches of Gods mercie. sufficient, and more then man could euer haue beene thankfull enough for, that God at first created man after his owne image in a most happie estate. From which when we wittingly and wilfully fell, God might iustly haue left vs, as he did the euill Angels. But he hath not only restored vs againe to that for∣mer estate, but aduanced vs to a farre more excellent and glo∣rious estate: wherein his goodnesse appeareth to be as his greatnesse, infinite, incomprehensible. Who can sufficiently set it forth? For as the heauen is high aboue the earth, so great Psal. 103. 11. is his mercie toward them that feare him.
§. 79. Of the ancient Law of mariage. EPHES. 5. 31. For this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother, and shall be ioyned vnto his wife: and they two shall be one flesh. THe same points which were before laid downe, concerning the neere vnion of man and wife, and of Christ and the Church, are here further confirmed by the ancient law of ma∣riage: which the Apostle doth the rather mention, because it followeth vpon that text, whereunto he alluded in the former verse. For when Moses had alledged these words of Adam concerning Eue, This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, he Gen. 2. 23, 24. addeth this law, Therefore shall a man leaue his father, &c. In this place these words haue both a literall and a mysticall sense. A literall of man and wife. A mysticall of Christ and the Church. The maine thing which the Apostle aimeth at, is to Inference. shew how neerely man and wife are linked together: that thereby they may the rathet be moued to performe those mu∣tuall and seuerall duties which they owe each to other. But because he propounded to husbands and wiues the examples of Christ and the Church, as patternes and motiues to them, to doe their dutie, he applieth that which was first spoken of man and wife, vnto Christ and his Church, to shew that there being so fit a resemblance betwixt these two couples, the pat∣terne propounded is the more pertinent to the purpose, and the reason enforced from thence the more forcible. Because the opening of the literall sense will giue great light to the mysterie, I will first handle this text according to the meaning of the letter. The first clause (for this cause) implieth a necessarie con∣nexion . with that which went before. The neere vnion of man and wife, as well as of Christ and his Church, was before no∣ted. A wife was said to be as the Vers. 28. Gen. 2. 23. bodie of a man, yea as Vers. 28. Gen. 2. 23. him∣selfe. Adam called her his flesh and bones. Hereupon both Mo∣ses and Paul inferre, Therefore, or, For this cause shall a man leaue father. Because man and wife are so neere by Gods
institution, they must also be most deare each to other in their mutuall affection. The Man (meaning an husband) is here in particular men∣tioned, Meaning of the words. because at the first making of this Law the woman was brought to him to see how he would like her: and hauing cast his affection on her, he was to be bound hereby to continue that good liking towards her: as also because of the prehemi∣nencie which man hath aboue his wife. Yet is not the man only tied hereby, but the wife also: the nature and rule of re∣lation requireth as much: if a man must inseparably cleaue to his wife, the wife must answerably cleaue to her husband. These words (shall leaue father and mother) are neither ge∣nerally to be taken of all duties, as if no dutie were to be per∣formed to parents by children after they are maried: nor sim∣ply, as if indeed parents were vtterly to be forsaken: but they are meant, 1. Of that daily seruice which children vnder their parents gouernment performe vnto them, seeking to please them in all things. When children are maried, then their daily atten∣dance must be vpon their wiues, or husbands, taking care how 1 Cor. 7. 33, 34. to please them. 2. Of erecting a new family: for which end their parents house must be left, and the husband and wife must dwell each with other. 3. Of the difference to be put betwixt parents, and wife or hus∣band. So as if by any ineuitable occasion it should so fall out, that a man must leaue his parent, or his wife (as in case parent and wife were both giuing vp the Ghost, and in places so farre remote, as the husband could not possibly be with both, yet both instantly desired his companie) by this Law he must leaue his parent, and cleaue to his wife. Hereby then the bond of mariage is declared to be the most inuiolable bond that can be. For all men know, that the bond betwixt parent and childe is a firme and inuiolable bond: but the bond betwixt husband and wife is more firme and in∣uiolable. To set forth the firmnesse of the mariage bond he addeth this Emphacicall phrase, shall be ioyned, (or as the word properly,
cording to the naturall notation thereof signifieth, shall be glu∣ed) . Glue. to his wife. Things well glued together are as fast, firme, and close as if they were one intire peece. Yea we obserue by experience that a table will oft times cleaue in the whole wood, before it will part asunder where it is glued: so as an husband ought to be as firme to his wife as to himselfe: and she to him. Fitly doth this agree with that which followeth (they two shall be one flesh) Our English cannot well expresse the Greeke . in good sense word for word (which is thus, they two shall be∣into, or in one flesh) the meaning is, They which were two be∣fore mariage, by the bond of mariage are brought into one flesh, to be euen as one flesh: as neerely vnited, as the parts of the same body, and the same flesh. This vnitie is not in regard of carnall copulation (for if they be maried they are one flesh, Matrimonium non facit coi∣tus, sed volun∣tas. Chrysost. in Mat. hom. 32. though they neuer know one another) nor in regard of pro∣creation, because one childe commeth from them both (for though they neuer haue childe, yet are they one flesh) but in regard of Gods institution, who hath set it downe for a law, and as another nature, that man and wife should be so neere one to another. Their consent in mariage (by vertue of Gods institution) maketh them to be one flesh. Well doth our English note the emphasis of the originall in this particle THEY (they two) which sheweth that the bond . of mariage knitteth only two together: one man, and one wo∣man, and no more. This Law setteth forth the Vnion betwixt man and wife. Summe. Therein three things are noted concerning the state of mariage. 1. The praeeminencie of it (a man shall leaue father and mother.) 2. The firmnesse of it (and be ioyned to his wife.) 3. The neerenesse of it (they two shall be one flesh.) §. 80. Of preferring husband or wife before parents. The first point sheweth, that A wife, or an husband must be preferred before parents. The Doct. examples of Gen. 31. 14. Leah and Rachel, yea and of 1 Sam. 19. 11 Micol, are com∣mendable in this respect.
1. The bond of mariage is more ancient, more firme, more Reason. neere. There was husband and wife before there was parent and child: and there is a time when parents & children may de∣part one from another, and that while both liue: but no time, wherein man and wife may part asunder till death part them. And children though they come from the flesh of their pa∣rents, yet are made two (so as of one are two) but husbands and wiues though they were two before, yet are made one (so as of two is one.) What wrong then doe such parents vnto their children, as Vse. keepe them, euen after they are maried, so strait vnder sub∣iection, Parents may not keepe their children being maried too straight. as they cannot freely performe such duty as they ought to their husband, or their wife? This is more then a parents authority reacheth vnto. Yet many thinke that their children owe as much seruice to them after they are maried as before: which is directly against this law. Greater is the wrong, and more sinfull is the practise of Nor keepe them from husband or wife. such as keepe their children from their husbands, or from their wiues. The match (say they) falleth out much worse then we looked for. But this should haue beene looked to more carefully before hand. After mariage it is too late to seeke such a redresse. On the other side, there be many children who so respect Children may not preferre their parents before hus∣band or wife. Apud Romanos sponsa obtecta flammeo ca∣pite quum ex∣tulisset pedem è paternis aedibus, verte∣batur in gy∣rum, itaque ducebtur in domumsponsi, nesiret rede∣undi viam ad aedes paren∣tum. Erasm. their parents, as they neglect their husband or their wife. Some husbands will bestow what they can on their parents, and keepe their wiues very bare, suffering them to want necessa∣ries; not caring how they vex and grieue them so they please their parents. Some wiues also will priuily purloine from their husbands to bestow on their parents. Others can neuer tarrie out of their parents houses, but as oft as they can, goe thither. The ancient Romans, to shew how vnmeet this was, had a custome to couer the brides face with a yellow veile, and so soone as she was out of her fathers house to turne her about and about, and so to carrie her to the house of her husband, that she might not know the way to her fathers house againe. All those pretenses of loue to parents are more preposterous then pious: and naturall affection beareth more sway in such, then true religion. Their pretence
of piety to parents is no rust excuse for that iniury they doe to husband and wife. §. 81. Of the firmnesse of the matrimoniall bond. The second point concerning the firmnesse of the mariage knot in these words (shall be ioyned to his wife) affor deth two doctrines. 1. Man and wife must associate themselues together by con∣tinuall See Treat. 2. part. 2. §. 14. cohabitation: for this end they leaue their parents fa∣mily, and erect a new family. 2. Man and wife are ioyned together by an inuiolable bond. It See Treat. 2. part. 2 §. 2. must neuer be cut asunder till death cut it. Body and soule must be seuered one from another before husband and wife. Be carefull therefore to preserue this indissoluble knot: and so liue together, as with comfort you may liue together, be∣cause you may not part. §. 82. Of two only to be ioyned together in mariage. The third point concerning the neerenesse of man and wife, in these words (they two shall be one flesh) affordeth two other doctrines. 1. Mariage can be but betwixt two, one man, and one wo∣man: for it is impossible that more then two should so neerely, and firmely be ioyned together, as man and wife are. Euery word almost in this law proueth this doctrine. For it saith a man, not men: to a wife, not to wiues: to his wife, not to anothers wife: two, not more then two: they two, not any two: one flesh, not many fleshes. Obiect. This particle (two) is not in the law as Moses re∣cordeth Gen. 2. 24. it. Answ. It is there necessarily implied, for at that time there were but two in the world: God then speaking of them, mea∣neth but two. The same spirit that guided Moses, guided also the Mat. 19. 5. Euangelists, and the 1 Cor. 6. 16. Apostles: so as by their inserting of this particle (two) it is certaine that it was intended by Moses: as the particle (only) which Christ putteth into this text, Deut. 6. 13. Mat. 4. 10. him only shalt thou serue. Quest. Why did God at first make but one man, and one woman?
Answ. The Mal. 2. 15. Prophet answereth, that he might seeke a godly seed. If therefore there be more then two, it is an adulterous seed which proceedeth from thence. §. 83. Of Polygamy and Bigamy. Can Polygamy (the hauing of many wiues) or Bigamy (the hauing of two wiues at once) haue any good warrant against such an expresse law? Are not both of them against the first institution of mariage, so as we may say, Mat. 19. 8. from the beginning it was not so? Yea also and against Deut. 17. 17. Leu. 18. 18. other particular lawes? Gen. 4. 19. Magis pertinere ad nuptiarum bonum, non vnum & mul∣tas, sed vnum & vnam, satis indicat ipsa prima diuini∣tus facta con∣iugum copula, &c. Aug. de Nupt. & con∣cup. l. 1. c. 9. Gen. 2. 18. Gen. 16. 5. & 21. 11. Lamech one of Cains cursed stocke was the first that we read of to haue presumed against that ancient law. Obiect. Afterwards many Patriarkes, and other Saints tooke that liberty vnto themselues. Answ. It was their sinne, and a great blemish in them. The common error of the time, & their vnsatiable desire of in∣crease made them fall into it. Many inconueniences followed thereupon: neither can it be thought but that much mischiefe must needes follow vpon hauing more wiues then one: for whereas God at first made a wife to be as an helpe vnto man, two, or more wiues cannot but be a great griefe and vexation vnto him by reason of that emulation that is betwixt them. Through Hagars meanes was Sarah stirred against Abraham, and Abraham grieued at Sarahs words. Though Leah and Ra∣chel were sisters, yet great were their emulations: the like whereof is noted of Peninnah and many others. Considering the hainousnesse of this sinne, our lawes Stat. 1. Iacob. 11. haue iustly made it felony for a man to haue more wiues then one, or a woman more husbands. §. 84. Of the neere coniunction of man and wife together. 2. The neerest of all other are husband and wife one to another. Doctr. Euery clause in the forenamed law proueth as much. 1. Parents must be left for wife: who neerer then parent and childe? if man and wife be neerer then the neerest, then they are the neerest of all. 2. A man is glued to his wife. This metaphor setteth forth the neernesse of a thing as well as the firmnesse of it: for things glued together are as one intire thing.
3. Man and wife are one flesh: many of one are made two, but no two so neerely and truly made one as man and wife. As God hath limited a propinquity, and vnity of things, so Reason. are they to be accounted: but God hath thus neerely knit man and wife together, and made them one flesh. Those whom Mat. 19. 6. GOD hath ioyned together, saith Christ of man and wife: in which respect matrimoniall coniunction is called the coue∣nant Pro. 2. 17. of God: so as this couenant cannot be released by any, no not by the mutuall consent of man and wife (Those whom GOD hath ioyned together, let no man put asunder) yet may many other couenants made betwixt partie and partie, be re∣leased and disanulled by mutuall consent of both parties. 1. This sheweth that the transgressions of man and wife Vses. one against another are of all the most hainous, more then of 1. Mutuall transgressions of man and wife most hai∣nous. friend, fellow, brother, childe, parent or any other. Who would not cry fie vpon that child that hates his parent, or fie vpon that parent that hates his childe? The heathen & sauages would not thinke them worthy of humane society. What then may be thought of the man that hateth his wife, or the wife that hateth her husband? Apply this to all other transgressions: and well note how the Lord is a witnesse thereof. Mal. 2. 14. 2. This also sheweth how monstrous a thing it is to sow 2. Monstrous to make de∣bate betwixt man and wife. any seeds of discord, and stirre debate betwixt man and wife. The deuils instruments they are therein, and a diabolicall spi∣rit is in them. For Satan most laboureth to vnloose those knots which the Lord knitteth most firmly. Children of se∣uerall venters, and seuerall friends of each partie, are much faultie herein. Cursed be they all before the Lord. 3. 1 Sam. 26. 19. This neere coniunction betwixt man and wife is a great 3. All duties betwixt man and wife to be cheerefully performed. Isa. 58. 7. motiue to stirre them both vp, cheerefully to performe all the duties which God requireth of either of them. For thereby they doe dutie, and shew kindnesse to their owne flesh. No man may hide himselfe from his owne flesh at large: that is, no man may neglect any dutie of mercie, or iustice to his neigh∣bour who is of the same stocke that he is: shall then an husband or wife hide themselues from one another who in the neerest respect that possibly can be are one flesh? not because they come from one flesh, but because they come . into one flesh.
Hitherto of the literall sense of this verse. The mysticall followeth. §. 85. Of the matrimoniall coniunction of Christ and the Church. The forenamed ancient mariage law is here applied my∣stically Quod per hi∣storiam im∣pletum est in Adam, per prophetiam sig∣nificat Chri∣stum qui reli∣quit patrem, &c. Aug. de Gen. lib. 2. c. 24. to Christ and the Church, as is euident by the next verse, where the Apostle hauing reference to this verse saith, This is a great mysterie. There is then a mysterie contained in it. But of what, or of whom is that mysterie? The Apostle him∣selfe maketh answer, in these words: I speake concerning Christ and the Church. The mysterie in generall is this, Christ and the Church are to one another as husband and wife. The particulars of this mysterie are these. The matrimoniall coniunction be∣twixt Christ & the Church is a most Preheminent coniun∣ction. Firme     Neere     First of the generall. The many espousall, and matrimoniall titles, which in Scripture are giuen to Christ and the Church in mutuall rela∣tion of one to another, euidently shew that they are ioyned together by the honourable, inseparable and inuiolable bond of mariage: He is stiled a Ioh. 3. 29. Bridegroome, she a Bride: he Cant. 1. 13, 15. Wel∣beloued, she Loue: he an 2 Cor. 11. 2. Husband, she a Wife: he an Eph. 5. 23. Head, she the Body: both & vers. 31. one flesh. 2. All things requisite to ioyne man and wife together, doe fitly concurre betwixt Christ and the Church. 1. They are persons fit to be ioyned. Though Christ be the things which make Christ and the Church fit to be husband and wife. God, yet for Ioh. 17. 19. this end he became man: and though the Church were impure, yet for this end is she cleansed and san∣ctified. 2. They haue their parents consent: for God is the Ioh. 20. 17. com∣mon father of both. And God hath giuen Rom. 8. 32. Christ to the Church, and the Ioh. 6. 39. Church to Christ. 3. They haue giuen their Cant. 2. 16. mutuall consent each to other. 4. He Eph. 5. 23, 24. beareth an husband like affection to her, and she is willing to yeeld a wife-like subiection to him.
5. He hath Eph. 4 8. giuen her many fauours and gifts as pledges of his loue: and she in testimony of her faithfulnesse was vnder the Law circumcised, and is vnder the Gospell baptized: and doth binde her selfe with all the sacred bonds and couenants which God to that purpose hath sanctified. 6. He hath prepared Ioh. 14. 3. places of habitation for them both to∣gether, and Reu. 22. 17, 20. she earnestly desireth to be with him. Behold another euidence of Christs admirable loue to the 1. Vse. Church, and of the neere vnion betwixt Christ and her. The An high fa∣uour to be the spouse to Christ. former was that she was his body. This, that she is his wife: well might the Church say as Abigaile did, Behold, let thine handmaid be a seruant to wash the feet of the seruants of my 1 Sam. 25. 41. Lord: and as the prodigall child, Make me as one of thine hired Luk. 15. 19. seruants: or as the Baptist, I am not worthy to stoope downe to Mar. 1. 7. vnloose thy shoe-latchets. What a fauour then is it to be made his spouse, his wife, his Queene. Great was the fauour which Ahash-verosh shewed to Esther, when he made her his wife: he was a great Monarch, reigning from India to Ethiopia ouer 127 prouinces: but Esther was a poore orphane and captiue: yet was not this fauour comparable to Christs: for there was no such disparity and inequality betwixt Ahash-verosh and Esther, as betwixt Christ and the Church: neither is Esthers aduancement to be compared with the Churches: and yet there was some cause in Esther to moue Ahash-verosh to doe what he did, for she was very beautifull, and louely, and wor∣thy to be loued: but §. 33, 34. in the Church when Christ first cast his loue on her, there was no such thing. No patterne of loue can be giuen any way comparable to this. Let the Church therefore, and all that professe themselues 2. Vse. to be of the Church, take such notice hereof, as they may en∣deuour Direction. How Christs spouse must cary her selfe. to carry themselues worthy of this honour and ad∣uancement: not to wax proud and insolent thereupon, but to despise all vaine and worldly toies: to answer loue with loue, as the Church is set forth in Salomons song; to be subiect to her husband, to reuerence and obey him, and to performe all duties appertaining to such a wife: seeking by all good meanes to maintaine the honour of her place. The Church is made a patterne of dutie to all wiues: if she should faile, grea∣ter
inconuenience would follow from thence, then from Vash∣ties Est. 1. 16. &c. disobedience. This is the rather to be regarded because it is not only a 3. Vse. matter of instruction but of triall also, shewing both what they Triall. Who are Christs spouse. which are of the Church ought to doe, and also §. 24. what indeed they will doe. Wherefore no prophane person that lightly esteemeth the Lord Iesus, no Idolater that casteth his loue on other husbands, no swearer or blasphemer that dishonoreth the great Name of Iesus, none that any way are rebellious against him, none that hate, scorne, scoffe, or hurt any of his members, can haue any comfort in this aduancement of the Church, because they haue no part therein, nor right thereunto. But great is that comfort which the true Saints may receiue 4. Vse. therein. For by vertue of this matrimoniall bond, Consolation. The priui∣ledges of Christs spouse. 1. Christ is made a yoakefellow with his Church, and her companion. Vnder all the burdens which are laid vpon her, he putteth his shoulder to make it the more easie: yea, the great burdens of Gods wrath, the curse of the law, and sinne the cause thereof, hath he so taken on him, as he hath cleane freed his Church from them, because they would else haue crushed her downe to hell. 2. Christ is as her champion to answer all challenges sent vn∣to her, as her aduocate to plead and answer all the complaints that shall be made against her, as her suretie to discharge all her debts: the Church being couert-baron vnder Christ, he is as her selfe, all in all for her, and to her. 3. All his honours, goods, priuiledges are hers: she hath Ecclesia om∣nem sponsi po∣testatem tenet. Aug. contr. Don. l. 4. c. 1. a right to them, and her part in them, she is a coheire with him (Rom. 8. 17.) a Queene because he a King (Psal. 45. 9.) and all glorious, as was noted, vers. 27. 4. He will assuredly performe all the offices of an husband, as to loue her, beare with her, prouide for her, with the like. Able he is to doe all, for he is omnipotent: willing also he must needs be, because willingly he hath taken vpon him this place: he hath made himselfe a patterne to other hus∣bands: will he not then doe that himselfe which herequireth of others?
If euer any wife might receiue comfort in a match, the Church may receiue comfort in this match. The benefit of this match will yet more liuely appeare by a particular consideration of the three forenamed properties of this matrimoniall bond, the preheminencie, firmnesse, and neere∣nesse thereof. §. 86. Of Christs leauing his Father and mother for his spouse. I. The preheminencie of the matrimoniall bond betwixt Christ and the Church herein appeareth, that Christ left his Father and his mother for his spouse the Church. As Christ is God, God is his Father; as man, the Virgin Marie was his mother. Now the leauing of his Father must be taken only by way of resemblance, in that he came from the place of his Fathers habitation, to the place where his Spouse was. The Scripture saith, that he was in the bosome of his Father: Ioh. 1. 18. by him, as one brought vp with him, his daily delight, reioycing al∣way Prou. 8. 30. before him: yet descended he into the lowest parts of the earth Ephes. 4. 9. where his spouse was. He came out from the Father, and came into Ioh. 16. 28. the world. But truly and properly did he preferre his Spouse before his mother. For when he was instructing his Spouse, and his mo∣ther came to interrupt him, he said to his mother, who is my Mark. 3. 33, 34. mother? and to his Spouse, behold my mother. Of the Vse. same minde must the Church, and all that are of the Church be vnto Christ: she must forget her owne people, and fa∣thers Imitation. All to be forsa∣ken for Christ. Psal. 45. 10. house. Seeing Christ hath gone before vs, and giuen vs so good an example, what an high point of ingratitude would it be for vs, to preferre father, mother, or any other before Christ our husband? Note what he saith in this case, He that loueth Matth. 10. 37. father or mother more then me, is not worthie of me. And againe, If any come vnto me, and hate not his father and mother, he cannot Luke 14. 26. expounded. How parents to be hated for Christ. be mine. To hate here, is to be so farre from preferring father & mother before Christ, as rather then not to loue Christ, to hate father and mother. Or, so intirely to loue Christ aboue all, as our loue of parents in comparison thereof to be an hatted. Thus Leui said vnto his father and mother, I haue not seene him: Deut. 33. 9. for they obserued the word, and kept the couenant of Christ.
This then is our dutie, that we suffer not any naturall affe∣ction and dotage on our parents to swallow vp that loue we owe to Christ, as Pharaohs ill-fauourèd and leane-fleshed kine eat Gen. 41. 4. vp the seuen well-fauoured and fat kine. How much lesse should any loue of this world, of the profits, promotions, or pleasures of this world, draw away our hearts from Christ; should we not rather say and doe as the Apostles did, Behold, we haue for saken Matth. 19. 27. all and followed Christ? §. 87. Of the indissoluble vnion betwixt Christ and the Church. II. The firmnesse of that bond whereby Christ and the Church are said to be glued together, is greater and more in∣uiolable then that whereby man and wife are ioyned together: Death parteth man and wife: but death cannot make a diremp∣tion betwixt Christ and the Church: so as we may well from this metaphor inferre, that Christ and the Church are inseparably Hosea 2. 19. knit together. I will betroth thee vnto me for euer, saith Christ vnto the Church. The couenant which Christ maketh with his Church, is an euerlasting couenant. The mountaines shall de∣part, Isa. 61. 8. & 54. 10. and the hils be remoued, before his kindnesse shall depart from the Church. The stedfastnesse and vnchangeablenesse of his will, is the Reason. only cause thereof. Whom he loueth, he loueth vnto the end. Ioh. 13. 1. His gifts and calling are without repentance. He is not like the Rom. 11. 29. hard hearted Iewes, who vpon euerie sleight occasion would put away their wiues. The Lord hateth putting away. Though Mal. 2. 16. therefore the Church, through her weaknesse, doe depart from him, and play the harlot, yet returne againe to me, saith the Ier. 3. 1. Lord. Learne we by this patterne to cleaue close vnto the Lord, Vse. Cleaue to Christ. which is a dutie most due to Christ who cleaueth so close to vs, and therefore oft Deut. 10. 20. & 13. 4. Acts 11. 23. expressed in the Scripture. Three vertues there are which are of speciall vse to this pur∣pose, Faith, Hope, Loue. Faith is the hand whereby we lay fast hold on Christ, and as it were knit him to our selues, as he by his Spirit knitteth vs to himselfe. This maketh vs rest and repose our selues on him for all needfull things: and not to leaue him for any thing.
Hope is the anchor, which holdeth vs fast against all the stormes of Satan, so as they can neuer driue vs out of our har∣bour, which is the Lord Iesus Christ. Loue is the glue and soader which maketh vs one with Christ: for it is the propertie of loue to vnite those that loue one another in one. Ionathans soule was knit with the soule of 1 Sam. 18. 1. Dauid. For why? Ionathan loued him as his owne soule. He that loueth is well pleased with him whom he loueth, and see∣keth also to please him, that they may mutually delight one in another. Were these three vertues well rooted in vs, we would say, who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? shall tribulation, Rom. 8. 35. &c. or distresse, &c. §. 88. Of the equall priuiledge of all the Saints. III. Concerning the phrase, whereby the neerenesse of All the Saints made one Spouse. man and wife is set forth (they two shall be one flesh) it may be demanded how this can be applied to Christ and the Saints, who are more then two? Answ. Christ by one Spirit knitteth vs all into one bodie, 1 Cor. 12. 13. and so maketh all ioyntly considered together one Spouse. The multitude of Saints doth no more imply many wiues, then the multitude of members which the naturall bodie of a wife hath. This point then teacheth vs, that In the mysticall mariage betwixt Christ and the Church, all and euerie of the Saints haue an equall priuiledge. Some are not See §. 22. Concubines, some wiues, nor some more loued, or preferred to another, but all one wife. All are one in Christ Iesus. Gal. 3. 28. Neither the Father that gaue them all, nor the Sonne who Reason. tooke them all, saw any thing in one more then in another; their meere grace moued them to doe what they did. Well may euerie one apply all the forenamed priuiledges vnto them∣selues: and not one emulate another. This affordeth instruction to the more eminent in the Vse. Church, that like proud dames they insult not ouer others, as if they were their hand-maids: and consolation to the meaner sort, that they may vphold themselues, and possesse their soules with patience, and not enuie, or grieue at the outward prospe∣ritie and priuiledges of others. In the greatest priuiledge they are equall to the greatest.
This of the parties coupled to Christ. For these words (they two) shew that all the Saints are but one: Christ is the other of the two. The next words (are one flesh) shew how neere those Saints are to Christ. §. 89. Of the neere vnion betwixt Christ and the Church. The maine point here to be noted is, that Christ and the Church are most neerely linked together. What Christus nihil aliud deputat corpus suum (i.) Ecclesiam, quam seipsum, quia de Christo & ecclesia veri∣us intelligi∣tur, Erunt duo in carne una. Aug. de pec. mer. lib. 1. cap. 31. can be neerer, then that two should come into one flesh? This is somewhat more then to be of Christs flesh. That shewes we are as it were cut out of Christ: this shewes that we are againe knit to him. That was a preparation vnto this: this is as the consummation and perfection of all. See §. 70. Many meta∣phors are vsed to set forth the neere vnion betwixt Christ and his Church, but this surpasseth them all. As here we and Christ are said to be one flesh, so in another place, one spirit. Well therefore might the name and title Christ be giuen to this Spouse of Christ. §. 84. It was noted on a like ground to this, that of all other per∣sons 1 Cor. 6. 17. & 12. 12. the transgression of a wife against an husband is most hainous. What then are the transgressions of the Church a∣gainst Christ? As we are much more bound vnto Christ for the priuiledges we receiue from him as an Head and Husband, and so our Sauiour hauing made with vs an euerlasting coue∣nant of mariage, then for those we receiued from him as our Creator, Lord and Master: so are the rebellions now com∣mitted against him more monstrous. To Adam that broke the first couenant whereby like a rebellious childe and seruant he sinned against his Father and Master, mercy and pardon was giuen: but to such as now breake the bond of this euerlasting couenant, and make a totall and finall desertion, vtterly re∣nouncing this Husband, or by their adulterie cause him to giue them a bill of diuorce, there remaineth no more sacrifice Heb. 10. 27. for sinnes; but a certaine fearfull looking for of iudgement, and fierie indignation which shall deuoure the aduersaries. This is to be noted, to make vs the more circumspect ouer our waies, re∣sisting sinne in the beginning, and looking diligently lest any Heb. 12. 15. man fall from the grace of God; and giuing no place at all vnto Eph. 4. 27. the Deuill. Satan will most endeuour to dissolue the neerest
bonds that God maketh. This then being the neerest of all, we ought to be the most carefull in preseruing it. §. 90. Of the mysterie of the vnion of Christ and the Church. EPHES. 5. 32. This is a great mysterie: but I speake concerning Christ and the Church. THis verse is a conclusion of that excellent digression which the Apostle hath made concerning the neere vni∣on of Christ and the Church. In it two points are to be noted. 1. A patheticall exclamation (This is a great mysterie.) 2. A particular application of the forenamed law (but I speake concerning Christ and the Church. Here first note that The vnion betwixt Christ and the Church is a great mysterie. The Apostle could not haue said more of it then to call it a mysterie, a great mysterie. A mysterie is a diuine secret. Of a mysterie see more in the whole armour of God, Treat. 3. §. 168. on Eph. 6. 19. A Secret it is in two respects. 1. Because it is not knowne. 2. Because it is vnsearchable: the depth of it cannot be fathomed. It is a Diuine secret, for two other respects. 1. Because it could not haue beene opened but by diuine reuelation. 2. Because when it is opened it cannot be conceiued but by the illumination of the Spirit. That Spirit which openeth and reuealeth the mysterie, must also open the eies of our vn∣derstanding to discerne aright of it. It is further said to be a great mysterie. 1. Simply in it selfe, because the matter thereof is deepe, 1. Vse. The mysterie of our vnion with Christ not to be mea∣sured with the last of our reason. difficult, waightie, and of great moment. 2. Comparatiuely in relation to other mysteries: no mysterie reuealed in Gods word comparable to it. Let vs not presume to measure it with the line of our owne reason. It being a great mysterie, it is aboue our capacitie: yet because it is reuealed we must beleeue it, as we doe the
mysteries of the Trinitie, of Christs eternall generation, of the personall vnion of his two natures, of the proceeding of the holy Ghost, with the like; because the word hath reuealed them, though we cannot fully see the reason of them. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt our estate in this world and in the world to come: here we must beleeue what we know but in part: there we shall perfectly know whatsoeuer is to be beleeued. Preachers can but in part make knowne this myste∣rie, and hearers can but in part conceiue it, let vs therefore wait for perfect vnderstanding of it, till all things be perfected in Christ: but in the meane time beleeue without doubting or wauering, that which is reuealed of it. In our meditation of this mysterie, let vs conceiue no carnall, 2. Use. No carnall thing in our vnion with Christ. Ecclesia Christo in occulto vxor est. Occultè quippe at{que} in∣tus in abscon∣dito secreto spi∣ritali anima humana inhae∣ret verbo Dei, vt sint duo in carne vna. Aug. contr. Faust. Man. lib. 22. cap. 38. no earthly thing of it, because it is a mysterie: it is altogether spirituall and heauenly. From the naturall vnion of our head and bodie, and from the matrimoniall vnion of man and wife, we may and ought to take occasion by way of resemblance, to helpe our vnderstanding in the vnion of Christ and his Church: for this end are these resemblances vsed, and by this meanes may our vnderstanding be much helped, as by the out∣ward elements and rites which are vsed in the Sacraments: but if because of these comparisons we draw this which is only and wholly spirituall, to any carnall matter, we shall make that to be a thicke mist, and darke cloud, which is giuen for a light. The dotage of our aduersaries is here plainly discouered. They make our vnion with Christ meerely carnall. For they conceit it to consist in a corporeall commixtion of Christs flesh with ours, by our eating his flesh with the teeth of our bodies, and drinking his bloud downe our throats, and digesting both 3. Use. Papists make our vnion with Christ a carnall matter. Joh 6. 52. Ioh. 3. 4. in our stomacks as our bodily food, that so it may turne into our substance. Thus they shew themselues like the dull-headed Capernaitans, and like ignorant Nicodemus. There is a great deale of grosse absurditie, but no great mysterie in that conceit. §. 91. Of the Popes vsurping to be Spouse of the Church. The Apostles application of this mysterie to Christ and the Church, discouereth two grosse errours of the Papists. One, that they make the Pope a Spouse of the Church. With what face can any apply that to the Pope and the Church,
which the Apostle so expresly saith is meant of Christ and the Multos adulte∣ros video qui sponsam tanto pretio emptam possidere volunt, & id agunt vt pro sponso a∣mentur. Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 12. Uide Bern. ep. 237. ad Eugen. Church? yea, what arrogant presumption is it, to attribute that to mortall sinfull man, which is proper to the eternall and holy Sonne of God? Is not this to conferre Christs prero∣gatiues vpon himselfe, and so make himselfe plaine Antichrist? Who gaue the Church to the Pope, or the Pope to the Church? When did she giue her consent? (I speake of the true Catho∣like Church of Christ.) What hath he done for her? or rather what hath he not done against her? The See §. 17. distinction of Impe∣riall and Ministeriall Spouse, cannot here serue the turne. As the metaphor of an head, so much lesse the metaphor of a Spouse will admit a ministeriall Spouse. As he is an adulterer that taketh vpon him to be a ministeriall husband, so is she an adulteresse that yeeldeth her selfe to such an one. The Apostle saith, I haue espoused you to ONE husband. 2 Cor. 11 2. §. 92. Of the false Sacrament of Mariage. The other error is, that Mariage is a Sacrament: the maine ground whereof they haue taken from this text, which ground by the Apostles application of this mysterie to Christ and the Church, is as plainly remoued, as if the Apostle had purposely ordered his stile, to preuent this erroneous collection: as if he had said, That none may mistake this mysterie, and apply it to a matrimoniall coniunction of man and woman together, know that I meane no such thing: the mysterie which I speake of, is concerning Christ and the Church. I maruell how they dare misapply that which is so plainly expressed. Though the Apostle had not so clearely shewed his minde and meaning, yet the verie thing it selfe would lead vs so to iudge of it. For, that which in Christ Quod est in Christo & in Ecclesia mag∣num, hoc in sin∣gulis quibus{que} viris & vxori∣bus minimum. Aug. de nupt. & concup. lib. 1. cap. 21. and the Church is a great mysterie, in man and wife is but a small matter. The vulgar Latine translation first led them into this error, for it translateth the word mysterie, a Sacrament. But a translation is no sufficient ground to proue a doctrine. Besides the word Sacrament vsed by that Translator, hath as large an extent as a mysterie: if they should make euerie thing which he translateth Sacrament, a proper Sacrament of the Church, there would be many more Sacraments then the Papists them∣selues doe make. 1. As for this supposed Sacrament, no Papist could euer
shew when or where God ordained it to be a Sacrament. Nay, they agree not among themselues about the time, how long it hath beene a Sacrament. Alphons. à Ca∣stro contr. haer. lib. 3. Some of them hold, that euer since the first institution of mariage in Paradise, it hath beene a Sa∣crament. But the greater number of Papists hold it to be a Sa∣crament Petrus à Soto de Matr. lect. 2. Concil. Trident. Sess. 24. Can. 1. of the new Testament vnder the Gospell, because their Tridentine Councell hath so decreed it. Where we may note how the greater number of them, when two absurdities are questioned, are readie to fall into the worst. Vnder the Law the nonage of the Church needed, and had more Sacraments then vnder the Gospell: yet that which was in vse as much vnder the Law as vnder the Gospell, and had then as much to make it a Sacrament as now, was then none, yet now is one. 2. As they cannot shew where it was ordained for a Sacra∣ment, so neither can they shew what is the Sacramentall signe thereof. Some make carnall copulation to be it. But there may be a true mariage, though the parties maried neuer know each other. Others make the Parents giuing to be the signe. But they hold that that is a true mariage, which is done without parents consent. Others the Priests blessing. Yet they hold the mariage of Infidels and Heretiques who haue no Priests, to be a true mariage. Others, the consent of the parties themselues. Thus shall a par∣tie administer a Sacrament to himselfe. Others, other things. Thus they wanting the light of Gods word, one strayeth in one by-path, another in another, and none of them hit vpon the right. 3. A like difference there is about the forme of this Sacra∣ment. 4. If other positions deliuered by them concerning matri∣monie be noted, a man would thinke that they should be farre from making it a Sacrament. They preferre virginitie before it. Yea, they account it a kinde of pollution. They hold it vnlawfull for Priests, Monks, Nuns, and such like holy orders (as they esteeme them) to marie: so as there is a Sacrament, whereof their holy ones may not partake. The order of
Priesthood is a Sacrament (in their account) yet that order keepeth from mariage, so as one Sacrament fighteth against an∣other. Yea, Infidels may be partakers of a Sacrament, and so their holy and precious things shall be denied to their holy ones, and cast vnto swine. Thus we see a rotten building ere∣cted vpon a sandie foundation: a false Sacrament established vpon a false application of this text. Can it then stand? §. 93. Of the Summe of husbands and wiues duties. EPHES. 5. 33. Neuerthelesse, let euerie one of you in particular so loue his wife, euen as himselfe: and the wife see that she reuerence her husband. THe Apostle hauing made a large digression about the mu∣tuall relation betwixt Christ and the Church, whom he propounded as patternes to husbands and wiues, he now re∣turneth to the maine point intended, namely to the duties of husbands and wiues: and so much doth the first particle imply (Neuerthelesse) as if he had thus said, Though I haue a little di∣gressed . into the mysterie of the vnion of Christ and the Church, yet neuerthelesse doe ye, ô husbands and wiues, call to minde that which I principally aimed at, euen your duties. This verse then containeth a conclusion of the Apostles dis∣course, concerning the duties of husbands and wiues. Two points are especially noted therein. 1. A declaration of their seuerall and distinct duties. 2. A direction to apply their owne proper duties each of them to themselues. Their distinct duties are noted in two words, Loue. Feare.   These two, as they are distinct duties in themselues, so are they also common conditions which must be annexed to all other duties. Loue as sugar to sweeten the duties of authoritie, which appertaine to an husband. Feare as salt to season all the duties of subiection which appertaine to a wife. The Apo∣stle therefore hath set them downe as two marks for husbands and wiues to aime at in euerie thing wherein they haue to deale one with the other.
Of these I will more distinctly speake in the treatises of the particular duties of husbands and wiues. §. 94. Of applying the word to our selues. The direction for a particular application of their owne proper duties to either of them is here especially to be noted. In this direction two things are to be obserued. 1. That euery particular person apply to himselfe that which by a Minister is indefinitly deliuered to all. Euery one . of you in particular, saith the Apostle: which is as much as if he had thus more largely expressed his minde, I haue laid downe such generall duties as all husbands and wiues without exception of any of what ranke or degree soeuer they be are bound vnto; which though by name I haue not seuerally deliuered to euerie one, one by one, but generally to you all, yet doe euerie one of you apply those things to your selues in particular. 2. That euery one apply his owne peculiar dutie vnto himselfe. Loue being peculiar to an husband, to him he saith, Let him loue his wife: and reuerence being peculiar to a wife, to her he saith, let the wife see that she reuerence her hus∣band. The direction in euery of those seuerall Epistles which were sent to the seuen Churches of Asia, (in these words, He that Reu. 2. 7. hath an eare, let him heare what the Spirit saith to the Churches) doth teach euerie member in any of those Churches to apply to himselfe that which was deliuered to the whole Church: so doth a like Luk. 8. 8. exhortation which Christ with an exclama∣tion made to the people whom he taught in parables: and this declaration of the extent of Christs counsell, what I say to Mar. 13. 37. you, I say to all. To this purpose many precepts giuen to whole Churches, and to all sorts of people are set downe in the singular number as giuen to one, as, Awake THOV that Eph. 5. 14. sleepest. THOV standest by faith: be not thou high minded &c. Rom. 11. 20. The life and power of Gods word consisteth in this parti∣cular Reason. The life of Gods word in application. application thereof vnto our selues. This is to mixe faith with hearing: faith, I say, whereby we doe not only be∣leeue the truth of Gods word in generall, but also beleeue it to be a truth concerning our selues in particular: and thus will euery precept thereof be a good instruction and di∣rection
on to vs to guide vs in the way of righteousnesse: euery pro∣mise therein will be a great incouragement, and consolation to vs to vphold vs, and to make vs hold on: and euery iudge∣ment threatned therein will be a curbe, and bridle to hold vs in, and to keepe vs from those sinnes against which the iudge∣ments are threatned. But otherwise, if we bring not the word home to our own soules, it will be as a word spoken into the aire, 1 Cor. 14 9. vanishing away without any profit to vs. Nothing maketh the word lesse profitable, then the putting of it off from our selues to others, thinking that it concernes others more then our selues. That we may make the better vse of this doctrine, let vs obserue both what are generall duties belonging to all Chri∣stians, and apply them as particular to our selues: and also what duties appertaine to such persons as are of our place, cal∣ling, and condition, and more especially apply them to our selues: let all manner of husbands, and all manner of wiues of what ranke or degree soeuer they be that shall read the du∣ties hereafter following, know that they are spoken to them in particular. Let Kings and Queenes, Lords and Ladies, Mi∣nisters and their wiues, Rich men and their wiues, Poore men and their wiues, Old men and their wiues, Young men and their wiues, all of all sorts take them as spoken to them in par∣ticular. It is not honour, wealth, learning, or any other excel∣lency, nor meanes of place, pouerty, want of learning, or any other like thing that can exempt an husband from louing his wife, or a wife from reuerencing her husband. He that saith euery one, excepteth not any one. Therefore euery one in par∣ticular doe yee so. The like application may be made to all Parents and children, Masters and seruants, concerning their duties. §. 95. Of euery ones looking to his owne dutie especially. In the forenamed application an eye must be had rather to the dutie which we owe, and ought to be performed by vs to others, then to that which is due to vs, and others ought to performe to vs: for the Apostle saith not to the husband, see that thy wife reuerence thee, but see that thou loue her: so to the wife.
For this purpose the holy Ghost presseth particular duties vpon those particular persons who ought to performe them: as Subiection on wiues: loue on husbands: and so in others. This therefore is especially to be considered of thee, how thou Vnum duntax∣at tibi conside∣randum est, quo pacto te praestes inno∣xium. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. maist shew thy selfe blamelesse. I denie not but that one ought to prouoke another, and one to helpe another in what they can to performe their dutie, especially superiours who haue charge ouer others, but the most principall care of euery one ought to be for himselfe, and greatest conscience to be made of performing his owne duty. 1. It is more acceptable before God, and more commenda∣ble Reasons. before men to doe duty, then to exact duty. As in matters of free charity, so also of bounden duty, It is more blessed to Act. 20. 35. giue, then to receiue. In particular it is better for an husband to be a good husband, then to haue a good wife: so for a wife. To haue others faile in duty to vs may be an heauy crosse, for vs to faile in our dutie to others is a fearefull curse. 2. Euery one is to giue an account of his owne particular Rom. 14. 12. duty. That which the Prophet speaketh of father and sonne, may be applied to husband and wife, and to all other sorts of people, If a father doe that which is lawfull and right, he is iust, he Ezec. 18. 5. &c. shall surely liue: if he beget a sonne that doth not so, he shall surely die, his bloud shall be vpon him. Againe, if a father doe that which is not good, he shall die in his iniquity: but if his sonne doe that which is lawfull and right he shall surely liue. The righteousnesse of the righteous shall be vpon himselfe: and the wickednesse of the wicked shall be vpon himselfe. That this shall be so betwixt hus∣band and wife, may be gathered out of these words, Two shall Luk. 17. 34. be in one bed, the one shall be taken, the other left. Let this be noted against the common vaine apologies which are made for neglect of duty, which is this, Dutie is not performed to me, why shall I doe dutie? when my husband doth his dutie, I will doe mine, saith the wife. And I mine, saith the husband, when my wife doth hers. What if he neuer doe his dutie, and so be damned, wilt thou neuer doe thine? This looking for of dutie at others hands, makes vs the more care∣lesse of our owne. Doe you therefore O husbands looke especially to your Vse.
owne duties, doe you loue your wiues: and you ô wiues looke Non quae alijs data sunt prae∣cepta quaerimus quando alicu∣ius criminis ac. cusamur. Chrys. loc. citat. you to yours especially, doe you reuerence your husbands. For this end, let husbands read those duties most diligently which concerne husbands, and wiues those, which concerne wiues. Let not the husband say of the wiues duties, there are goodlessons for my wife, and neglect his owne: nor the wife say the like of husbands duties, and not regard her owne. This is it that maketh the subiection of many wiues very harsh and irkesome to them, because their husbands that vrge and presse them thereto shew little, or no loue to them at all: and this is it that maketh many husbands very backwards in shewing loue, because their wiues which expect much loue, shew little or no reuerence to their husbands. Wherefore Let euery one of you in particular so loue his wife, euen as himselfe: and the wife see that she reuerence her husband. §. 96. Of the meaning of the first verse of the sixt Chapter. FRom those particular duties which concerne husbands and wiues the Apostle proceedeth to lay down such as concerne children and parents. As before he laid downe wiues duties before husbands, so here he beginneth with childrens (who are inferiour to their parents) and that for the same reasons which were rendred §. 10. before. Besides children are the fruits of matrimoniall coniuncti∣on, therefore fitly placed next vnto Man and Wife. That which concerneth children is laid downe in the sixt Chapter of Eph. vers. 1, 2, 3. The meaning whereof we will distinctly open. EPHES. 6. 1. Children obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. The first word (children) is in the originall as proper a word . at could be vsed, for according to the notation of it, it signifi∣eth such as are begotten and borne. Answerable is the other word (parents) which signifieth such as beget and bring forth . Who are to be accounted children, who parents. children. Yet are they not so strictly to be taken as if none but such as begat and brought forth, or such as are begotten and brought forth of them were meant: for vnder the title parents,
he includeth all such as are in the place of naturall parents, as Grandfathers and Grandmothers, Fathers in law, and Mothers in law, Foster-fathers and Foster-mothers, Guardians, Tutors, and such like gouernors: and vnder the title children he compri∣seth Grand-children, Sonnes and daughters in law, Wards, Pupils, and such like. For there is an honour and a subiection due by all who are in place of children, to all such as are in place of parents, though in a different kinde, as we shall Treat. 5. §. 56, 57, &c. . after shew. This word children which in the originall is of the neuter gen∣der, doth further include both sexes, males and females, sonnes and daughters: so as either of them are as carefully to apply the duties here set forth to themselues as if in particular both kindes had beene expressed. He expresseth parents in the plurall number, to shew that he . meaneth here also both sexes father and mother, as the law ex∣presseth both: and addeth this relatiue particle your, as by way . of restraint, to shew that euery child is not bound to euery pa∣rent, so by way of extent to shew that whatsoeuer the estate of parents be honourable or meane, rich or poore, learned or vn∣learned, &c. their owne children must not be ashamed of them, but yeeld all bounden dutie to them: if they be parents to children, they must be honoured by children. The word (Obey) vnder which all duties of children are . comprised, according to the Greeke notation, signifieth with an humble submission to hearken, that is, to attend and giue heed to the commandements, reproofes, directions, and exhorta∣tions which are giuen to them, and that with such a reue∣rend respect of the parties who deliuer them, as they make themselues conformable thereto. A dutie proper to inferiours, and implieth both reuerence and obedience: the . verbe noteth out Obedience; the . prepo∣sition, Reuerence. Vnder this word (Obey) the Apostle comprehendeth all All duties of children com∣prised vnder obedience. those duties which thorowout the Scripture are required of children: as is manifest by his owne exemplification thereof in the second verse by the word honour which the law vseth: so as this word (obey) is to be taken in as large an extent as that word (honour.)
Quest. Why is obedience put for all the rest? Answ. 1. Because it is the hardest of all the rest, and that which children are loathest to performe they who willingly yeeld to this, will sticke at no duty. 2. Because it is the surest euidence of that honour which a childe oweth to his parent: and so of performing the fift commandement. 3. Because children are bound to their parents: the du∣ties which they performe are not of curtesie, but necessity. Their parents haue power to command, and exact them. The clause added (in the Lord) is in effect the same which . was vsed Chap. 5. vers. 22. before (as vnto the Lord) and it noteth forth a li∣mitation, direction, and instigation: a limitation shewing that childrens obedience to their parents is to be restrained to the obedience which they owe to Christ, and may not goe be∣yond the limits thereof: a direction shewing that in obeying their parents, they must haue an eye to Christ, and so obey them as Christ may approue thereof: an instigation shewing that parents beare the image of Christ, and in that respect children must the rather obey their parents. The last clause of this verse (for this is right) is an expresse . reason to inforce the forenamed point of obedience: and it is drawne from equity: and sheweth that it is a point agreeable to all law: yea that in way of recompence it is due: and if chil∣dren be not obedient to parents they doe that which is most vniust, they defraud their parents of their right. The former phrase (in the Lord) implying one reason, this plainly noteth out another, as the first particle (for) de∣clareth. §. 97. Of the meaning of the second verse. EPHES. 6. 2. Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandement with promise.) THe very words of the fift commandement are here alleaged Why the mo∣rall law is al∣leaged. by the Apostle as a confirmation of the forenamed reason, that, it is iust and right to obey parents, because God in the mo∣rall law enioyneth as much. The law is more generall then
the Apostles precept: for the law compriseth vnder it all those duties which all kinde of inferiours owe to their supe∣riours, whether they be in family, church, or common wealth: but the Apostles precept is giuen only to one kinde of infe∣riours in the family: yet the argument is very sound and good from a generall to a particular, thus, All inferiours must A genere ad speciem. honour their superiours, therefore children their parents. By adding the expresse words of the law the Apostle sheweth that the subiection which he required of children is no yoke which he of his owne head put on their neckes: but that which the morall law hath put on them: so as this may be noted as a third reason, namely Gods expresse charge in his morall law. If I should handle this law according to the full extent thereof, I should wander too farre from the Apostles scope. I will therefore open it no further then it may concerne the point in hand, viz. the duty of children. Honour compriseth here all those duties which children in Honour com∣priseth all childrens duties. any respect owe to their parents. It implieth both an inward reuerend estimation, and also an outward dutifull submission. Yea it implieth also recompence, and maintenance. Honour in relation to parents, is vsed for two reasons especially. 1. To shew that parents beare Gods image: for honour is properly due to God alone: to the creature it is due, only as it standeth in Gods roome, and carieth his image. 2. To shew, that it is an honour to parents to haue dutifull children: euen as it is a dishonour to them to haue disobe∣dient children. Both father and mother are expresly mentioned, to take away Why both fa∣ther and mo∣ther expres∣sed. all pretence from children of neglecting either of them: for through the corruption of nature we are prone to seeke after many shifts to exempt vs from our bounden dutie; and if not in whole, yet in as great a part as we can. Some might thinke if they honour their father, who is their mothers head, they haue done what the law requireth: others may thinke they haue done as much, if they honour their mother who is the weaker vessell: but the law expressing father and mother,
condemneth him that neglecteth either of them. Yet to shew that if opposition should arise betwixt them, and by reason thereof both could not be obeyed together, the father com∣manding what the mother forbiddeth, the father is to be pre∣ferred, (especially if it be not against the Lord) the father is set in the first place. These words following (which is the first commandement How the fift commande∣ment is the first with pro¦mise. with promise) are fitly included in a parenthesis, because they are not the words of the law, but inserted by the Apostle as a reason to inforce the law, and so make a fourth reason. Quest. In what respect is this commandement called the first with promise? Answ. 1. The * word here vsed by the Apostle properly . signifieth an affirmatiue precept, as our English word (comman∣dement) doth. Now then of the affirmatiue precepts it is the first with promise. 2. The Scripture oft appropriateth the law to the second table, as where he saith he that loueth another hath fulfilled the Rom. 13 8. law, and so in other places. Now this is the first commandement of the second table. 3. It is generally true of all the commandements: for among the ten it is the first with promise. Obiect. The second commandement hath a promise an∣nexed Difference betwixt the promise in the second, and fist comman∣dement. to it. Answ. 1. That which is annexed to the second Comman∣dement, is not expresly a promise, but rather a declaration of Gods Iustice, in taking vengeance of transgressors, and of his mercie in rewarding obseruers of the Law: yet I denie not but that a promise by consequence is implied: but here it is ex∣pressed. 2. The promise there implied is only a generall promise made to obseruers of the whole Law, and therefore he vseth the plurall number, Commandements: but here is a particular promise made to them that keepe this Commandement in particular. 2. Quest. Why is it then said the first, when no other Com∣mandements with promise follow? First simply taken. Answ. This particle (first) hath not alwayes reference to
some other following, but is oft simply taken, to shew that none was before it: so is the word first-borne vsed in the Law: Exod. 13. 2. Matth. 1. 25. and so Christ is called the first-borne Sonne of Marie. The word promise sheweth, that this fourth reason inclu∣deth some benefit redounding to those children themselues that honour their parents: the benefit is expresly mentioned in the next verse, which we will afterwards distinctly consider. §. 98. Of aiming at our owne, in seeking the good of others. Here in generall we may note, that It is not vnlawfull to aime at our owne good and benefit in doing the duties which God requireth at our hands to others: for that which God himselfe propoundeth and setteth before vs, we may seeke and aime at. Many like promises there be in Scrip∣ture, and many approued prayers grounded on those promises whereby the truth of the doctrine is confirmed vnto vs. He∣zekiah Isa. 38. 2, 3. maketh the good seruice he had done to God and his Church, a ground to obtaine longer life: so others. For God layeth no dutie on any man, but therein he aimeth at the good of him who performeth the dutie as well as of him to whom the dutie is performed. Whereby he would shew that his Commandements are no strait yokes and heauie bur∣thens, but meanes of procuring their good who fulfill them. How highly doth this commend the good respect that 1. Vse. God beareth to all the sonnes of men: seeking their good in euerie place wherein he setteth them, either of authoritie, or subiection? How ought this to stirre vs vp willingly and cheerefully to 2. Vse. obserue the Lawes which God commandeth vs, and per∣forme the seruices he requireth of vs, seeing thereby we pro∣cure our owne good? How fully may this satisfie, and euen stop the mouthes of 3. Vse. all such as are discontent with their places, and mutter against that subiection which God enioyneth to them? What a good direction and resolution may this be to many, 4. Vse. who being moued in conscience to seeke the good of others, doubt whether therein they may aime at their owne good or no? To make this case cleare by an instance, which may serue in stead of many. A Minister faithfull in his place, and verie
painfull, and in that respect of a good conscience, but withall of a tender and weake conscience, doubteth whether thereby he may seeke maintenance to himselfe, fearing that so he see∣keth himselfe, and not simply the edification of Gods Church. But by the forenamed doctrine we see that both may be aimed at: for God commandeth the one, and promiseth the other. As we haue one eye on Gods Commandement for direction, so we may haue another on his promise for incouragement. Yet because through the corruption of our nature, we are too Cautions in seeking our owne good. prone to seeke our selues, some cautions are in this point care∣fully to be obserued. 1. That we seeke not our owne good by any transgression, for it is promised vnto obedience. 2. That we doe not so wholly seeke our selues and our owne good, as we neglect others: for God hauing ioyned both to∣gether, no man may put them asunder. 3. That we aime at our owne good, as a reward following vpon the dutie which God commandeth, and so be as willing to doe the dutie, as desirous of the reward. 4. That our owne benefit be not the only, no nor the chiefest thing we aime at in doing our dutie, but rather come as a mo∣tiue to adde an edge, and to sharpen other motiues of greater moment. And thus much the order which the Apostle obser∣ueth in setting downe his reasons, noteth vnto vs: for the three former haue respect to God, and to that good conscience which children ought to carrie towards him: the first pointeth at Gods image which parents carie (in the Lord:) the second set∣teth forth that right which God hath prescribed to children: the third declareth Gods charge: this fourth only, which is the last, hath respect to the profit and benefit of children them∣selues. §. 99. Of preferring honestie before commoditie. From the forenamed order we may further gather, that Equitie and good conscience ought more to moue vs to doe our dutie then our owne profit, and the benefit that thereby redoundeth to vs. If there should come such an opposition betwixt these that they could not both stand togethet, but that for doing that which is right, and which God hath commanded, our
prosperitie must be hindred and life shortned, we should so stand to that which is right and commanded of God, as pro∣speritie, life and all be let goe. To this purpose tend all the exhortations in Scripture, to forsake goods, lands, life, and euerie thing else for righteousnesse sake. So cleare is this point, Cic. lib. 2. de Offic. & Pa∣radox. 1. that the Heathen discerned it by the glimpse of that light of nature which they had: for they could say, that that which is honest and right, is to be preferred before that which is com∣modious and profitable. There is no comparison betwixt honestie and commoditie, right and profit. The one is absolutely necessarie for attai∣ning to eternall saluation, the other giueth but a little quiet and contentment in this world: nay, if profit be without right, it can giue no true contentment or quiet at all. Vnworthie therefore they are of the name of Christians, who Vse. so wholly and only aime at their outward profit and prosperi∣tie, as they regard not what is right, and what God hath com∣manded. If by obeying God, and doing that which is right they may reape some benefit to themselues they can be con∣tent Nihil bonum Scriptura nisi quod honestum asserit. Ambr. Offic. lib. 2. cap. 3. to yeeld thereunto: but if not, farewell all right, farewell all Gods commandements. Though they thinke euery thing that is profitable, be it right or wrong, to be good, yet Gods word accounteth nothing good but that which is honest: such therefore can looke for no blessing from the Lord. §. 100. Of the meaning of the third verse. EPHES. 6. 3. That it may be well with thee, and thou maist liue long on the earth. THe promise mentioned before in generall, is here particu∣larly set downe. The first words (that it may be well with thee) are not in the Hebrew text Exod. 20. 12. there where the Law is first recorded, and thereupon not set in that vsuall forme of the ten Commandements, which is in vse among vs: but yet in Deut. 5. 16. ano∣ther place where the Law is repeated, they are set downe: and the Greeke translation, commonly called the Septuagint (which (as is probable) the Church in the Apostles time vsed) hath expresly noted it in both places. Now this part of the promise
(that it may be well with thee) is prefixed as an amplification of the other part concerning long life, which is the most princi∣pall thing intended, as appeareth in that it only is mentioned where the Law is first recorded. It sheweth that the long life Longlife and prosperitie ioyned toge∣ther. which God promiseth, shall not be a life of woe and miserie, (for then were it no blessing, but the longer life lasted, the worse it would be) but a life full of comfort and happinesse: therefore Moses fetteth this former clause in the latter place af∣ter long life thus (that thy dayes may be prolonged, and that it Deut. 5. 16. may goe well with thee) to shew that the well being here spoken of, is an amplification of the benefit of long life. Whereas the Apostle setteth downe the place where the be∣nefit of this promise is to be enioyed in a most large phrase, thus (on earth) the Law bringeth it to a more narrow compasse thus (in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee) meaning the land of Canaan which was giuen of God as a peculiar in∣heritance to the Iewes: so that the promise (as the Law setteth it downe in peculiar to the Iewes) implieth long life, and pro∣speritie in their owne inheritance: for long life to the Iewes was counted no life out of their owne Countrey. But the Apostle writing to all nations, leaueth out that description of Canaan, and retaineth only the generall substance in this word (on earth) which he setteth downe to shew that euen outward prosperitie, and a long life in this world is here promised. §. 101. Of prosperitie: how farre forth it may be a blessing. For further clearing of this text, and for better application thereof, I will resolue sundrie questions arising out of it, and gather such profitable instructions as it affordeth. The promise consisteth of two branches. The first branch (that it may be well with thee) is very ample . and large: all good things, all manner of blessings whatsoeuer, spirituall and temporall, belonging to soule and body, con∣cerning this life, and the life to come, make to a mans well∣being. Whence may first be demanded; 1. Qust. What may be the extent of this phrase in this place? Temporall prosperitie promised. 1 Tim. 4. 8. Answ. It may generally be extended to all manner of good things. For Godlinesse hath promise of the life that now is and of
that that is to come. But (as I take it) temporall prosperitie is here principally intended: and that for these reasons. 1. It is ioyned with long life, which is a temporall blessing. 2. The last word (on earth) may be referred to this branch of well-being, as well as to the other of long life. 3. In the Law (from whence this clause is taken) it is ex∣presly set downe, thus, that it may goe well with thee in the Deut. 5. 16. land, &c. 2. Quest. Is then outward temporall prosperitie (as ho∣nour, Prosperitie a good thing. health, peace, libertie, goods, &c.) a token of Gods loue and fauour? Answ. Yea: in it selfe it is a blessing, and fruit of Gods loue: as appeareth by these reasons. 1. As at first it was made and ordained of God, it is a good thing. 2. It tendeth to mans good, if it be rightly vsed. 3. It was bestowed on man before he had offended. 4. It is promised of God as a reward to them that feare him Leuit. 26. 4. &c. Deut. 28. 1. &c. and keepe his Commandements. 5. The Saints haue prayed for it, and haue beene thankfull Gen. 28. 20. & 32. 10, 11. for it. 6. The contrarie was first inflicted as a punishment of sinne, Leuit. 26. 15. &c. and is oft threatned as a token of Gods wrath, and so hath also beene inflicted on transgressors. Deut. 28. 16. &c. §. 102. Of prosperitie bestowed on the wicked, how it proues a curse. 3. Quest. Why then is it bestowed vpon the wicked, euen such as are . haters of God, and are hated of him? And why are Gods friends, such as are . loued of him, and loue him againe, depriued thereof? This sore scruple made Dauid stum∣ble, Psal. 73. 13. Ier. 12. 1. Hab. 1. 3. and moued other Prophets to complaine. But the answer is readie. Answ. Outward prosperitie is of that nature, as it may turne to the good or hurt of him that enioyeth it. And herein is Gods admirable and vnsearchable wisdome seene, in that he is able to turne blessings into curses, and curses into blessings. How prosperi∣tie proues a curse to the wicked. He can worke by contraries. 4. Quest. How is prosperitie a curse to the wicked?
Answ. By meere consequence, through their abuse of it. God giues it to them to shew the riches of his mercie: and that all may taste thereof, he doth good to the euill and the good. Be∣sides, Matth. 5. 45. Rom. 2. 4. he thus trieth if by any meanes they may be brought to repentance: which gift because they haue not, their prosperitie proueth to be a meanes to make them the more inexcusable, and the more to increase their iust condemnation. For the more Gods blessings abound towards them, the more they abuse them, adding to all their other sinnes, that most odious sinne of ingratitude, which maketh vp the heape of all. And in these respects I may say of the prosperitie of the wicked, as the Pro∣phet of their King, God giues it in his anger, and takes it away in Ose. 13. 11. his wrath. For by their abuse thereof, it proueth Satans bait to allure them, his snare to catch them, and his hooke to drowne 1 Tim. 6. 9. them in perdition and destruction. In a word therefore, the wicked are fed in a faire pasture like oxen appointed to the slaughter: they are exalted on high, as on a ladder or scaffold, like theeues and traytors, to be brought downe with shame and destruction, as Pharaohs Baker was lift vp. Gen. 40. 19. §. 103. How both hauing, and wanting prosperitie is a blessing to the Saints. 5. Quest. How is the inioying, or wanting of prosperitie a blessing to the righteous? Answ. God in wisdome knowing what is best for them ac∣cordingly deales with them, he bestoweth prosperitie on them so farre as he seeth it will turne vnto their good: and de∣nieth it to them so farre as he seeth it will turne to their hurt. Whensoeuer therefore God bestoweth any temporall blessing on his Saints, it is a token of his favour: and whensoeuer he denieth any, the very deniall is also a fruit of his fauour. Here∣in is it verified that All things worke together for good to them Rom. 8. 28. that loue God, so as, if they abound, it shall goe well with them: if they want, it shall goe well with them: if they be in high place, it shall goe well with them: if in meane place, it shall got well with them: if they be at libertie, if in prison: if they be in health, if sicke: in what estate soeuer, it shall goe well with them. 6. Quest. How is it then that Saints are oft brought to such
extermities that they are forced to complaine that it is very Complaints of Saints im∣peach not their well being. ill with them? Answ. There is flesh and bloud in them, by reason of the weaknesse whereof they are forced to complaine: but the pre∣sent apprehension of weake flesh, is not sufficient to impeach the truth of Gods promise: they consider not in their present extremitie what is Gods minde, what his manner of dealing with them, how needfull it is that so they should be dealt withall, what end and issue the Lord will giue: in truth it is better with them then they wot of. Some weightie reasons there be which moue God to bring them to that extremitie wherein they are, and those respecting his Iob. 9. 3. 2 Cor. 12. 9. owne glorie, or the Epb. 3. 1. edification of others, or their owne good, as Psal. 119. 67 curing some dangerous disease, Iob 1. 12. manifesting the grace of God be∣stowed vpon them, Ose 5. 15. drawing them neerer to God, 2 Cor. 5. 2. making them long the more for heauen, with the like. §. 104. Of long-life: how farre forth it is a blessing. Concerning the second branch of Gods promise (long-life) other questions are to be resolued. 1. Quest. Is long-life a blessing? Long life a blessing. Answ. Yea, else would not God here and in other places haue promised it as a reward, nor haue bestowed it on his Saints. The reasons to proue it to be a blessing may be drawne to three heads. 1. Gods glorie. 2. the good of the Church where they liue. 3. their owne good. 1. Gods glorie is much aduanced by the long life of the Saints: for the longer they liue the more they doe themselues obserue Gods wonderfull workes, and the more they doe make them knowne and declare them to others. But in the graue all Psal. 6. 5. Isa. 38. 18. is forgotten. 2. Gods Church is greatly edified thereby: in which re∣spect the Apostle saith, to abide in the flesh is more needfull for Phil. 1. 24. you: In the Saints that is true which Elihu saith should be, namely that daies speake, and multitude of yeeres teach wisdome. Iob. 32. 7. The longer the Saints liue, the more good they doe: but after death they doe none: when the night commeth no man can worke: Iob. 9. 4.
Gal. 6. 10. vpon which ground the Apostle exhorteth to doe good while we haue time. 3. The Saints by long liuing purchase to themselues great honour, and dignitie among Gods people, and a strong sted∣fast confidence in God. Men regard a good old seruant: much more will God. Two strong props haue old Saints to establish them, and make them bold: one is a remembrance of Gods former fauours, whereby their hope of eternall life is made more sure vnto them: another is a kinde of present ex∣pectation of the accomplishment of Gods promises which they haue long waited for. By this it appeares that this particular promise is no light matter, of small moment: but a strong motiue to stirre vp children to obedience. §. 105. Of long life prouing a curse to the wicked. 2. Quest. Why then is long life giuen to many wicked ones? and why are many Saints cut off? Answ. Long life is of the same kinde that prosperitie is: it may be turned to a curse, as well as proue a blessing. The wicked by liuing long on earth make their sins grow to the full (as is implied of the Amorite) they make their Gen. 15. 16. name to stinke the more on earth, as a carion the longer it re∣maineth aboue ground the more it stinketh: and they cause the greater torment in hell to be inflicted vpon them: for as Rom. 2. 5. sinne is increased, so shall that torment be increased. The righteous haue their daies shortned for their good, when they are shortned, and that in these, and such like respects 1. That they may be 1 King. 14. 13. taken from the euill to come. 2. That they might be made an 1 King. 13. 14. example to others. 3. Isa. 17. 1. That 1 Cor. 11. 32. by a temporall death eternall condemnation might be auoided. 4. That their Gen. 5. 24. Heb. 11. 5. chiefest and greatest reward might be hastened. §. 106. Of limiting the promises of temporall blessings. Thus we see there may be iust cause to alter, as the former branch of this promise, prosperitie, so the latter branch of it, long-life, and yet no wrong thereby redound to the righteous, nor benefit to the wicked.
3. Quest. Is not the truth of the promise impeached thereby? Answ. No whit at all. For first all promises of temporall blessings are limited with such a condition as this, if the per∣formance of it may stand with Gods honour, and the good of the partie to whom it is made. 2. God doth neuer simply depriue his Saints of that which is promised, but only in stead of it giueth a better: as in taking away wealth, he giueth the more store of grace: in restraining liberty of body, he giueth freedome of conscience: with affliction he giueth patience: by taking away this temporall life, he giueth eternall life. God herein dealeth, as if one who hauing promised so much iron, should in stead thereof giue as much siluer: or for siluer giue gold: and so for one pound giue the worth of hundreds or thou∣sands. §. 107. Of appropriating prosperity and long-life to the obedi∣ence which children yeeld to their parents. 4. Quest. Why is long-life and prosperity appropriated to this kinde of righteousnesse? Answ. It is not so appropriated to this, as if it appertained to no other: for it is elsewhere in generall promised to the Deut. 6. 2. obseruers of the whole law, and to other particular branches thereof beside this: yet in these and such like particular re∣spects Psal. 34. 12, 13, 14. is it applied to the obedience of children. 1. Because obedience to parents is one of the surest eui∣dences of our conformity to the whole law: in that thereby we shew our respect of Gods image, and lay a good foundation for the performing of all dutie to man. 2. Because a childes performing of his dutie to his parents is vnder God an especiall meanes that they doe well, and liue long (for as rebellious children make their parents with griefe to come the sooner to their graues, so dutifull children make them to continue the longer in prosperity) the Lord in recompence promiseth to such a childe prosperity and long life. 3. Because parents are an especiall meanes to procure the welfare and long life of their children, partly by their proui∣dent
care, as Noami said to Ruth, shall I not seeke rest for thee, Rut. 3. 1. that it may be well with thee? and partly by their instant praier: for the faithfull praier of parents is of great force with God for dutifull children: whence hath risen the custome of chil∣drens asking their parents blessing, and of parents blessing their children. In this respect the law thus setteth forth the blessing of the fift commandement, they shall prolong thy daies. 4. Because disobedience to parents bringeth much mis∣chiefe on childrens heads, and oft shorteneth their daies, and that many waies. 1. In that parents are oft prouoked by their childrens dis∣obedience How disobe∣dient children hinder their welfare and shorten their daies. to disinherit them, at least to allow them the lesse portion, so as hereby it goeth not so well with them: yea some are prouoked to bring their rebellious children to the Magistrate, who by Gods law was to cut them off, so as Deut. 21. 21. thereby their life is shortened. 2. In that parents are prouoked to complaine vnto God of their childrens disobedience, and God thereby moued both to lay heauie iudgements vpon such children in their life time, and also to shorten their daies: for parents complaint doth make a loud crie in Gods eares. It is said that God by cutting off Abimelech with an vntimely death rendred the Judg. 9. 5 6. wickednesse which he did to his father. 3. In that, when parents are too indulgent ouer their chil∣dren, God doth punish the sinne both of parent and childe, by shortning the childes daies. Instance the examples of 1 Sam. 2. 34. Hoph∣ni and Phinehas, 2 Sam. 18. 14. Absolom, and 1 King. 2. 25. Adonijah. 4. In that disobedience to parents, is a sinne that seldome goeth alone: for an vndutifull childe is commonly a verie lewd person many other waies. Considering the prouenesse of our nature to all sinne, it cannot be auoided but that they who in the beginning shake off the yoake of gouernment, should run headlong into all riot, loosenesse, and licentious∣nesse: thus then sinne being added vnto sinne, it must needs bring mischiefe vpon mischiefe, till at length life be cut off. Wherefore in that these mischiefes are auoided by perfor∣ming due obedience to parents, it may well be said that it shall be well with obedient children, and they shall liue long.
§. 108. Of Gods ordering his fauours so as they may appeare to be true blessings. The particular branches of Gods promise hauing beene How fitly pro∣sperity and long life are ioyned toge∣ther. distinctly opened, we will consider them ioyntly together, for they doe exceedingly amplifie one another: prosperity swee∣tens long life and makes it acceptable: otherwise to liue long, namely in misery and wretchednesse, is very irksome and grie∣uous. Againe, long life added to prosperity maketh it so much the greater blessing. For a good thing the longer it continueth the better it is. If prosperity were but as a flower, soone gone, the very thought of the vanity thereof would much diminish the ioy and comfort of it. But both of them ioyned together, doe shew that this is no small blessing which is promised. From the connexion of them both together, I obserue that God so ordereth his fauours as they appeare to be true blessings, God makes his sauours true blessings. Gen. 17. 19. tending indeed to the good of those vpon whom he bestow∣eth them. Thus when God gaue Abraham a sonne, he esta∣blished his couenant with him, that this gift might be a true blessing. The like I might instance in all the children of promise, as Sampson, Salomon, Iohn Baptist, &c. So in other fauours. When God added fifteene yeares to Hezekiahs life, he also promised Isa. 38. 5, 6. & 39. 8. him deliuerance from his enemies, and peace, and truth all his daies: And when God gaue Dauid a kingdome, he gaue him 2 Sam. 7. 9. &c. great victories and long life, and established his kingdome to his posterity: so also dealt he with Salomon. But not to insist on any more particulars, excellently is this doctrine con∣firmed in the 28 Psalme. Thus God will shew that in loue he bestoweth euen the temporall blessings which he giueth to his Saints, that accor∣dingly they may esteeme them, and that their hearts may be the more inlarged both to admire his goodnesse, and to be thankfull for the same. This vse we must make of those things which the Lord is 1. Vse. pleased to bestow vpon vs, as of long life, good health, ho∣nour, peace, plenty, liberty, and all prosperity: we must re∣ceiue and vse them as God bestoweth them, namely as tokens
of his fauour: and thereby be the more stirred vp to performe the duties he requireth of vs, and not abuse them to his disho∣nour and our owne hurt: but rather so as he may haue ho∣nour, and we profit thereby. §. 109. Of Gods high account of dutifull children. More particularly by this promise we may learne what high 2. Vse. esteeme, and great account God maketh of dutifull children, and of that obedience which they performe to their parents: which ought so much the more to prouoke children to all obedience, if at least they haue any care of Gods fauour, and of the tokens of his loue. Oh consider this all yee that haue parents to honour: consider how carefull, how earnest God is euery way by all meanes to draw you to obedience: he contents not himselfe to vrge the equity of the point, the place of your parent, the charge that himselfe hath giuen, but most presseth your owne profit: and that not only in hope for the time to come, but euen in present fruition for this life: and that because we through our childishnesse are most af∣fected with things sensible and present: dealing with vs as a tender father who prouideth not only a good calling, and a faire in heritance for his childe, but giueth him also plums, peares, and such things as for the present he is delighted with∣all, the more to allure him. §. 110. Of childrens doing good to themselues by honouring their parents. Children may further learne out of this promise, that in 3. Vse. performing their dutie they doe good not only to their pa∣rents, but also to themselues: they procure their owne wel∣fare and long-life. What egregious fooles then are disobedi∣ent children: they regard neither God, their parents, nor themselues, but depriue themselues of their eternall happi∣nesse, hinder their welfare, and shorten their daies. Fitly here∣upon I may applie to vndutifull children these words of the Psalmist, Marke the obedient childe, for the end of him is peace: Psal. 37 37, 38. but the rebellious shall be destroyed: he shall be cut off: and these of the wise-man, I know that it shall be well with the dutifull Eccl. 8. 12, 13. childe, but it shall not be well with the disobedient, he shall not pro∣long his daies: and these of the Prophet, Say ye to the obedient
childe, it shall be well with him, he shall eat the fruit of his doings, Isa. 3. 10, 11. but woe to the transgressor, it shall be ill with him. §. 111. Of parents doing good to their children by keeping them vnder obedience. Out of this promise parents may learne how to doe good 4. Use. for their children, how to prouide for their welfare, and long to preserue their life on earth (a thing whereunto most parents are naturally giuen, and whereof they are much desirous) namely by teaching children their dutie, by keeping them vn∣der obedience: thus haue they Gods promise to assure them, that it shall goe well with their children, and that they shall liue long. When parents are vpon their death-beds they may rest more securely vpon this promise then vpon great store of treasure laid vp for them, and great reuenues reserued for them. Many parents neglect themselues: they moile and toile, they carke and care, they pinch and spare, to leaue their chil∣dren store of wealth, thinking thereby to doe good to their children, when as withall they too much cocker their children, giue the reines vnto them, and care not how little dutie they performe. Gods curse will lie vpon all the store that is laid vp for such children, as a fire to consume it all. Doth not daily experience verifie the truth hereof? The iudgements which are laid on some such children, doe euidently manifest Gods iust indignation against all. Let not rich men therefore thinke they haue left their children well enough if they leaue them a large portion, but rather if they haue obserued them to be obe∣dient children: and if poore mens children be such, let them not feare but that it shall goe well with them. It is said, that a good trade is better then house and land, but by vertue of this promise we may say that obedience in a childe is better then trade and all: this is the trade of a childes Prou. 22. 6. way which parents should teach children. Wherefore as pa∣rents are desirous of their childrens good, so they ought to be wise in procuring it, which is by teaching them this trade of obedience: and so they shall bring much comfort to themselues while they liue, and good to their children after them.
§. 112. Of the perpetuitie of the substance of such things as in their circumstances respecting the Iewes are vanished. In laying downe this particular promise, the Apostle in stead of the limitation thereof vnto the Iewes in these words (in the land which the Lord thy God shall giue thee) putteth a ge∣nerall word, which extendeth it to all nations, namely this (in the earth) whence I gather that The substance of these things which in some circumstances were Doctr. Substance of promises made to the Iewes still re∣maineth. after a peculiar manner restrained to the Iewes, remaineth in force to all Christians. The substance of this promise was, that it should goe well with obedient children, while here on earth they liued, and in this welfare they should long liue. The cir∣cumstance was, that in Canaan they should inioy that blessing. Though Christians liue not in Canaan, which is the circum∣stance, yet well it shall goe with them, and long they shall liue, which is the substance. Thus though the circumstance of Gods couenant with Abraham (which was circumcision) be a∣bolished, yet the substance (which is, to be our God, and the God of our seed) remaineth. This might further be exemplified in many hundred instances: for the substance of all the Iewish sacrifices, and Sacraments, both ordinarie, and extraordinarie, of their Sabbaths, of their fasts, of their feasts, and the like, re∣maine, though the circumstances, as shadowes, be vanished a∣way. Hence is it, that many promises made to them, are ap∣plied by the Apostles to Christians, as this, I will not faile thee, Heb. 13. 5. Act. 2. 39. nor forsake thee: and in generall it is said, The promise to you and to your children, and to all that are afarra off. Hereby we may learne what vse to make of the old Testa∣ment, Vse. euen of those promises and priuiledges which in some particular respects were appropriated to the Iewes: namely, by obseruing the substance, and distinguishing it from the cir∣cumstance; thus shall we finde that to be true which the Apo∣stle speaketh of all the things which were written afore time, namely, that they were written for our learning. In this respect Rom. 15. 4. the same Apostle saith of the things recorded of Abraham, they were not written for his sake alone: and againe of the Rom 4. 23. things recorded of the Israelites, they are written for our admo∣nition. 1 Cor. 10. 11. By this we may learne how to applie the preface to the
ten Commandements, which mentioneth the deliuerance of Israel out of the bondage of Egypt. Pray therefore for the spirit of illumination to discerne be∣twixt substance and circumstance, in reading the old Testament especially. §. 113. Of the determined period of mans life. Hauing declared such orthodoxall points as this text af∣fordeth, I will further note out two hereticall positions, which our aduersaries thence raise. One is of those, that to the dishonour of him whom God raised vp to be a worthy instru∣ment in dispelling the mist of Poperie, which had much dark∣ned the light of the Gospell, call themselues Lutherans: the other of Papists. The former is this, God hath not determined the set period of Hinc patescit humanae vitae terminum, non esse decreto sim∣plici & absolu∣to constitutum, &c. Zach. Mu∣thel. in hunc loc. & N. Heming. alij{que}. mans daies, but it is in mans power to lengthen or shorten them: for if it were otherwise, say they, this and such like promises of long life were to no purpose, nor yet the contrary threatnings of shortning mans daies. For full answer hereunto, I will first shew, that the position it selfe is directly contrarie to the current of Scripture, and then discouer the vnsoundnesse of their consequence. Touching the determined period of mans daies, thus speaketh the Scripture: Is there not an appointed time to man on Mans time set. Iob 7. 1. earth? are not his daies also as the daies of an hireling? Note with what emphasis the point is set forth; euen so, as if it were a point so cleare, as none could doubt of it. Note also two metaphors here vsed, which doe much cleare the point: one taken from souldiers, the other from hired seruants. That of souldiers is implied in the meaning of the originall word translated appointed time, but properly signifieth him that hath  his time appointed for warfare, or the time it selfe so appoin∣ted: the other expressed. Now we know that these times are appointed to an houre: so is the time of mans life. In this re∣spect Iob saith againe, all the daies of my appointed time will I Iob 14. 14. wait, &c. where he vseth the same word that before in the same sense. To this purpose are these, and such like phrases frequently vsed in Scripture, determined daies, number of daies, Iob 14. 5. Eccles. 2. 3. Iob. 7. 30. houre, &c. Did not the Prophet expresly declare to Hezekiah
that he should liue iust 15 yeeres after his sicknesse? He could Isa. 38. 5. not haue told it, if the Lord had not before set that period. Christ saith, our haires are numbred, are not much more our Mat. 10. 30. & 6 27. daies? Againe he saith, who can adde one cubit to his stature? Stat sua cui{que} dies, &c. Virg. Aenied. 10. Can then any adde to his daies? So euident is this point, that the heathen noted it. Touching their consequence (if a mans time be determined all the promises of long life are to no purpose) I answer, that God who hath set downe the iust time and period of mans life, hath also set downe the meanes of attaining to that period. Now the time he hath kept secret to himselfe, the meanes he hath reuealed to vs. In regard of vs therefore who know not the time appointed of the Lord, it may be said that by vsing such and such meanes we prolong our daies, or by doing such and such things we shorten them. Now because these meanes only shew them to be long, or short, Gods decree remaineth firme and stable, and is not altred thereby: yet this worke of leng∣thening or shortning is attributed to vs, because we doe what lieth in vs thereto, and that freely without any compulsion. For Gods decree though it cause a necessitie in the euent, yet it imposeth no constraint on the will of man, but leaueth it as free (in regard of the manner of working) as if there were no decree at all. And herein Gods admirable wisdome is ma∣nifested, that notwithstanding his determined purpose of mat∣ters, man hath no ground of excuse to say he was forced to this or that. The knowledge of this determined period of mans life is of great vse: for it teacheth vs, 1. Wholly to submit our selues to God: and to be prepa∣red Vses to be made of the determined time of mans life. either soone to depart out of this world, or long to liue in it, as God shall dispose of our time: nor desiring longer to liue then God hath appointed: nor grieuing to liue so long as he hath appointed. 2. Not to feare the threats of any man, thereby to be drawne Dan. 3. 17, 18. from God. 3. To doe Gods worke while we haue time, &c. Iob. 9. 4.
§. 114. Of reward promised to obedience, that it implieth no merit. The other heresie which Papists gather from this text, is Against merit. this, Mans obedience is meritorious. Answ. The reward here promised is no matter of wages and due desert, but of meere grace and fauour. Of this error I haue Whole armour of God, Treat. 2. Part. 4. §. 7. on Ephes. 6. 14. elsewhere more largely spoken. §. 115. Of the connexion of Parents dutie with Childrens. EPHES. 6. 4. And ye fathers, prouoke not your children to wrath: but bring them vp in the nurture and admo∣nition of the Lord. THe Apostle hauing vrged children to performe their du∣ties to their parents, he turneth his speech to parents, say∣ing, AND ye fathers, &c. That copulatiue particle AND, ioy∣ning an exhortation to parents, for performing their duties to the forenamed exhortation made to children, giueth vs to vn∣derstand, that Parents are as well bound to dutie as children. Their duties 1. Obseru. Parents bound to du∣ties. indeed be different, yet (notwithstanding their superioritie and authoritie ouer their children) they are bound to dutie. All the directions and exhortations throughout the Scripture gi∣uen vnto parents, concerning their dutie, and all the threat∣nings denounced, and iudgements executed on parents for neglect of their dutie, are pregnant proofes of this point. Though parents be ouer their children, and by them can∣not be commanded, yet they are vnder God: and he it is who hath enioyned them their dutie: so as they are bound there∣unto, as they will answer it to their Father in heauen. The authoritie which parents haue, is not so much for their owne aduancement, as for the better gouerning of their chil∣dren, which being so, their verie gouernment is a dutie. Object. In the morall Law the dutie of children only is ex∣pressed. How parents duties are im∣plied in the 5. Commande∣ment. Answ. Parents dutie (as many others duties) is by iust and necessarie consequence implied, which is equiualent, and as
much bindeth, as if it were expressed. It is thus implied. They who haue honour, must carrie themselues worthie of honour. Now the way to carrie themselues worthie of honour, is to be carefull in doing dutie to them that honour them. This is so equall, as it needed not to be exprest. Wherefore let Ministers follow this patterne of the Apostle, 1. Vse. Ministers must prouoke parents to their dutie. and carrie an euen hand towards all of all sorts: let them not be partiall in laying all the burden of dutie on childrens necks, and none on parents: holding in children verie straitly, but leauing parents to their owne will. Parents are flesh and bloud as well as children, and as prone to transgresse in their place, as children in theirs. Yea, Ministers ought of the two to be more earnest in vrging parents to performe their dutie, because they are vnder no such power and authoritie as children are. Feare of parents authoritie keepeth children much in awe. There is no such thing to keepe parents in awe. They will be more readie therefore to take the greater libertie, if by feare of God, and by a good conscience, they be not kept in compasse. Now ye (ô parents) as you looke for honour, carrie your¦selues 2. Use. worthie of honour: as ye looke for dutie from your chil∣dren, performe dutie to them. Know that another day, euen you shall be called to an account before the highest Iudge: your authoritie will then be no pretence to excuse, but an eui∣dence to aggrauate your fault. For you being elder in yeeres, and more eminent in place, of more experience, and hauing a charge ouer your children, ought to be a light to shew them the way, an example to allure them, that they seeing you care∣full and conscionable in performing your dutie, may be the more prouoked to performe theirs, or at least made ashamed of their neglect of dutie. But if you be carelesse of your dutie, how can ye expect dutie at their hands? nay if by your ill ex∣ample they haue beene made negligent, their bloud shall be re∣quired at your hands. §. 116. Of the extent of these words, Fathers, Children. Though the word (Fathers) be here vsed, which properly . setteth forth naturall parents, and of naturall parents the male kinde, yet (as in many other places) it is to be taken in a lar∣ger extent: euen in as large as this word (children) was before,
that so there may be a iust and equall relation betwixt children Vers. 1. and parents: wherefore both sexes of naturall parents are comprised vnder it, euen mother as well as father, and they also who are in place of parents, whether by mariage as all sorts of fathers and mothers in Law, or by appointment, as all they who of right haue the custodie and charge of children, as Guardians, Tutors, and other like Gouernours: and so it is euerie way answerable to the word (parents) vsed in the first verse: and the word (children) is also here to be taken in the same extent, as it was there. §. 117. Of parents prouoking children. The next phrase (prouoke to wrath) is the exposition of one . Greeke word, which being a compound word, cannot by one English word be fully expressed: the best and neerest that I can thinke of is (exasperate.) The word signifieth an extremitie in the vse of authoritie: euen too much austeritie and seueritie, whereby children are prouoked to wrath: which because it is a fault, it is here expresly forbidden (prouoke not, &c.) In this word there is a trope: the effect is put for the cause: The Apo∣stles meaning is, that parents should take such heed of their cariage toward their children, as they giue them no occasion to be stirred vp to wrath. Vnder this word then are forbidden Occasions of prouoking children to wrath. all such things, as may kindle wrath in children, as too much austeritie in cariage, sowrenesse in countenance, threatning and reuiling in words, too hard handling, too seuere correction, too much restraint of libertie, too small allowance of things needfull, with the like. Parents being flesh and bloud are sub∣iect in this kinde to abuse their authoritie: yea, euen they who fall into the other extreme of too much indulgencie and cocke∣ring of their children, are verie prone to fall also into this ex∣treme: as many who for the most part too much suffer their chil∣dren without due restraint and correction to runne into all riot, will sometimes on a sudden, like Lions, flie vpon them, and after their owne pleasure correct them, and so exceedingly pro∣uoke Heb. 12. 10. their children. Such as are most cockering, are most prone to prouoke to wrath: for, 1. Such least know how to keepe a meane: one will sooner leape out of one extreme into ano∣ther,
then goe from an extreme to the meane. 2. The children of such are soonest prouoked. Quest. Is it a thing lawfull and iustifiable in children to be prouoked to wrath by their parents? Answ. See Treat. 5. §. 31, 41. No. This prohibition intendeth no such thing: the Apostle hath here to doe with parents: and instructeth them how to preuent such mischiefes as their children through their weaknesse may fall into. So as here only he sheweth what is vnlawfull for parents, not what is lawfull for children. Hence then by the way I obserue that Parents must be so watchfull ouer their cariage, as thereby they 2. Obser. make not their children to sinne. If they doe, they make their owne sinne the more hainous, and also they pull downe vpon their owne pates a farre more heauie vengeance, euen the vengeance of their owne sinne, and the vengeance of their childes sinne. For euery parent is made a watchman ouer his childe. If a watchman doe not Ezec. 3. 18. what he can to hinder the sinne of such as are vnder his charge, he pulls their bloud on his owne necke. What doe they then that being watchmen, minister occasion of sinne to them that are vnder their charge? §. 118. Of parents seeking the good of their children. That parents by auoiding the rocke of prouoking, fall not into the gulfe of cockering, the Apostle addeth a BVT, which is . as a stop vnto them, and teacheth them that It is not sufficient for parents to preuent such mischiefes a 3. Obser. children may fall into, but they must also seeke their good. All the precepts in Scripture charging parents to seeke their childrens good, proue the point. Herein lieth a maine difference be∣twixt the affection which parents and strangers ought to beare toward children, and the dutie which one and the other owe to them. Meere strangers ought not to prouoke them: but parents ought moreouer euery way to seeke their good. The maine good which parents ought especially to seeke after in the behalfe of their children, is noted out in these words: Bring them vp in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The word translated (bring vp) properly signifieth to feed .
or nourish with all needfull things; it is the same that is vsed before in the 5. chapter and 29. verse, and there translated nourisheth. Not vnfitly might the proper signification of the . Enutrite, Beza. word be here kept, as the best Latine translations, the French, and others haue kept. This word ioyned with the others that follow, may seeme Nourrissez. Fr. at first sight to be here placed only to make vp the sense, as if he had thus said, nurture your childe in the wayes of God. But if the scope of the Apostle, and signification of the word be well weighed, we shall finde that it further implieth a generall du∣tie, which nature it selfe teacheth parents, euen this, that Parents ought to prouide all needfull things for their children: 4. Obseru. Parents to prouide all needfull things for children. . euen such things as tend to the nourishing of their bodies, and preseruing of their health and life: for this phrase (to translate it word for word) nourish them in discipline, or in instruction, is a concise speech, implying as much as if he had said, nourish and nurture them, or feed and instruct them. But the Apostle hath thus neerely and concisely ioyned them together, to shew that Nurture and instruction is as needfull and profitable, as food and apparell. §. 119. Of parents nurturing their children. 5. Obseru. . The word translated nurture, signifieth as well correction as instruction: as Heb. 12. 7. If ye endure chastening: and 2 Tim. 3. 16. The Scripture is profitable for instruction in righteousnesse. Both senses will here stand, and our English word (as well as the Greeke) will beare both: for to nurture children, is as well to correct them, as to instruct them. Verie fitly is this aduice in this large acceptation inferred vpon the former prohibi∣tion: for lest parents should thereupon take occasion to lay the reines vpon their childrens necks, and let them run whi∣ther they list, the Apostle hereby teacheth, that Parents, as they may not be too austere, so neither too remisse. 6. Obseru. . They must not prouoke their children to wrath, yet they must keepe them vnder discipline. The word translated nurture, ac∣cording to the , Instituere vt puerili aetati conuenit. Greeke notation thereof doth further set forth the meane betwixt the two forenamed extremes: for it noteth out such a discipline as befitteth a lad, or a young childe: so as the thing it selfe, discipline, by instruction and correction keepeth
from one extreme of remisnesse: the kinde or manner of disci∣pline being such as befitteth a childe, keepeth from the other extreme of rigour and crueltie. Extremes on either side are dangerous and pernicious, and that to parent and childe. For remisnesse will make children carelesse of all dutie to God and parent: rigour will make them desperate. But vertue and safe∣tie consisteth in the meane betwixt both. §. 120. Of parents fixing precepts in their childrens mindes. This word (admonition) according to the , menti indere. notation thereof, hath a particular relation to the minde, and pointeth out an in∣forming and instructing of it. It is taken either for the action of admonishing, (as Tit. 3. 10. reiect an hereticke . after the first and second admonition) or for the In monitis. thing admonished, in which latter sense most doe here take it: yet would I not haue the for∣mer cleane excluded, for according to the full meaning of the word, I take thus much to be intended. As parents deliuer good precepts and principles to their children, 7. Obseru. . so they must be carefull, by forcible and frequent admonitions, to fix and settle them in the minde of their children. Deut. 6. 7. The Law expres∣seth as much by another metaphor which it vseth, in a directi∣on which it giueth to parents, saying, thou shalt whet or sharpen Gods Lawes vpon thy children, that is, Doctus inter Hebr. vocem  conti∣nuò loqui ex∣ponit, (i.) incul∣care, vel identi∣dem repetere. Innuit studium & diligentiam qua pueris prae∣cepta Dei incul∣cari debent. Uatabl. in Deut. 6. 7. vide Tr. 6. §. 42. thou shalt teach them diligently vnto them. The more paines is taken in this kinde, the lesse labour will be lost. That which at first is little heeded, by much vrging and pressing will for euer be held, as a naile that at one blow scarse entreth, with many blowes is knockt vp to the head. § 121. Of adding information to discipline. The addition of this word admonition vnto nurture, is not (as some take it) a meere explication of the same point, but al∣so a declaration of a further dutie, which is this: As parents by discipline keepe their children vnder, so by infor∣mation 8. Obser. they must direct them in the right way. Salomon doth both deliuer the point, and also adde a good reason to inforce it: for saith he, Traine vp a childe in the way that he should goe; there is the dutie: and when he is old, he will not depart from it; there Pro. 22. 6. is the reason. Keeping a childe vnder by good discipline, may make him dutifull while the father is ouer him: but well in∣forming
his vnderstanding and iudgement, is a meanes to vp∣hold him in the right way so long as he liueth. §. 122. Of parents teaching their children the feare of God. The last word (of the Lord) intimateth the best dutie that . a parent can doe for his childe. Admonition of the Lord, decla∣reth such principles as a parent hath receiued from the Lord, and learned out of Gods word: such as may teach a childe to feare the Lord, such as tend to true pietie and religion: whence further I obserue, that Parents must especially teach their children their dutie to 9. Obser. God. Come children (saith the Psalmist) hearken vnto me, I will teach you the feare of the Lord. Of this particular more largely Treat. 6. §. 34. hereafter. §. 123. Of the subiection which beleeuing seruants owe. Because there is yet another order in the family besides those which haue been noted before, namely the order of Masters & seruants, the Apostle prescribeth also vnto them their dutie. As he began with wiues and children, in the two former orders, so here he beginneth with seruants who are the infe∣riours, for the same reasons §. 10. Why the Apo∣stle is so copi∣ous in vrging seruants to their dutie. before rendred. The Apostle is somewhat copious in laying forth the duties of seruants, and in vrging them to performe their dutie; and that for two especiall reasons: One in respect of those, whose masters were infidels: another in respect of those, whose ma∣sters were Saints. 1. Many seruants there were in those daies wherein the Seruus beneuo∣lentia prosequa∣tur dominum, quamuis impiū. Qui fidelem habet dominum, saluo eius domi∣nio, diligat vt patrem. Conslit. Apost. li. 4. ca. 12. Gal. 4. 28. Gospell was first preached to the Gentiles, that by the prea∣ching thereof were conuerted, whose masters embraced not the Gospell: whereupon those seruants began to conceit that they being Christians, ought not to be subiect to their ma∣sters that were infidels. 2. Other seruants there were whose Masters beleeued the Gospell as well as they: now because the Gospell taught, that there is neither bond nor free, but all are one in Christ Iesus: they thought that they ought not to be subiect to their master who was their brother in Christ. These two preposterous and presumptuous conceits doth the Apostle intimate, and expresly meet with in 1 Tim. 6. 1, 2. another
place. And because they had taken too deepe rooting in the mindes of many seruants, the Apostle here in this place la∣boureth the more earnestly to root them out, and that by a thorow pressing vpon their conscience that subiection where∣in they are bound to their masters, as masters, whatsoeuer their disposition were. Hereof more Treat. 7. §. 2, 3. afterwards. Here by the way, note three points. 1. The Gospell doth not free inferiours from that subiecti∣on 1. Obser. to men whereunto by the morall law they are bound. 2. Men are ready to turne the grace of God into libertie. 2. Obser. 3. As errors begin to sprout vp in the Church, Ministers 3. Obser. must be carefull to root them out. §. 124. Of the meaning of the fift verse. EPHES. 6. 5. Seruants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh, with feare and trem∣bling in singlenesse of your heart, as vnto Christ. THis title (Seruants) is a generall title, which may be ap∣plied . to all such as by any outward ciuill bond, or right, Origo vocabuli seruorū in Lat. lingua inde cre∣ditur ducta, quod hi qui iure belli possint oc∣cidi à victoribus cùm seruabax∣tur serui fie∣bant: à seruan∣do appellati. Aug. de Ciu. Dei lib. 19. cap. 15. Uide ud Viu. ibid. owe their seruice to another: of what sex soeuer the persons themselues be: or of what kinde soeuer their seruitude is: whether more seruile or liberall. Seruile, as being borne seruants, or sold for seruants, or ta∣ken in warre, or ransomed; For of old they were called ser∣uants, who being taken in warre, were saued from death. Liberall, as being by voluntary contract made seruants, whe∣ther at will, as some seruing-men, iournie men, and labourers; or for a certaine terme of yeeres, as prentises, clearkes, and such like. Wherefore whatsoeuer the birth, parentage, estate, or former condition of any haue beene; being Seruants they must be subiect, and doe the dutie of seruants: the 4. Obser. Apostles indefinite title (seruants) admitteth no excepti∣on of any. The other title (Masters) hath as large an extent compri∣sing . What masters are meant. vnder it both sexes, Masters and Mistresses: and of these all sorts, great and meane, rich and poore, strong and weake,
faithfull and infidels, true professors and profane; superstiti∣ous, idolatrous, hereticall persons, or the like: so as No condition or disposition of the master exempteth a seruant 5. Obseru. from performing dutie to him. Among other degrees and differences, most especially let it be noted that both sexes, mistresses as well as masters, are here meant, that so the duties which are enioyned to be per∣formed to masters may answerably be performed to mistresses (so farre as they are common to both) and that both by maid∣seruants, and also by men-seruants that are vnder mistresses. In families mistresses are as ordinary as masters, and therefore I thought good to giue an especiall item of this. Vnder this word (obey) are comprised all those duties which . seruants owe to their masters: it is the same word that was be∣fore vsed in the first verse: and it hath as large an extent here being applied to seruants, as it had there being applied to children: It sheweth that The rule of seruants (as seruants) is the will of their Master. 6. Obseru. . This clause (according to the flesh) is by some referred to the action of obedience, as if it were added by the Apostle to shew what kinde of obedience seruants owe to their masters, namely a ciuill, corporall obedience in temporall things, opposed to that spirituall obedience which is due to God alone. Ans. Though distinction may be made betwixt that seruice which is due to God, and that which is due to man, yet this ap∣plication of this phrase in this place may giue occasion to ser∣uants to thinke that if they performe outward seruice to their masters all is well, they owe no inward feare, or honour, which is an error that the Apostle doth here mainly oppose against. But because this clause (according to the flesh) is immediatly Why masters are said to be after the flesh. Dominis carna∣libus. vet. transl. ioyned to Masters, I referre it to the persons to whom obe∣dience is to be giuen, and so take it as a description of them, as if he had said, to fleshly or bodily Masters. The Apostle thus describeth masters for these reasons. 1. For distinction: to shew he meanes such masters as are of the same mould that seruants are: so distinguishing them from God who is a spirit: thus doth the Apostle distinguish betwixt fathers of our flesh, and father of spirits. Heb. 12. 9.
2. For preuention: left seruants might say, our masters are flesh and bloud as we are, why then should we be subiect to them? To meet with that conceit, the Apostle expresly saith that obedience is due to masters after the flesh. 3. For mitigation of their seruitude: for their masters be∣ing flesh, they haue no power but ouer the bodies of their ser∣uants: their spirits are free from them: in which respect the Apostle calleth Christian seruants the Lords freemen. 1 Cor. 7. 22. 4. For consolation against their present condition, which is but for a time, because their masters are flesh: whatsoeuer is according to the flesh is of no long continuance, but hath his date. 5. For direction: to shew in what things especially that obedience which properly belongeth to a master consisteth: namely in ciuill, outward things: for euery one must be ser∣ued according to his nature. As God being spirit, must in spirit be serued: so man being flesh must in flesh be serued. Now this seruice in the flesh is not opposed to sincere and vp∣right seruice, but to spirituall. Thus by consequence that may be intended, which some would haue principally to be meant. Obiect. Masters may command spirituall things, namely to worship God, and after such and such a manner. Answ. Of his owne head he cannot command such things: there must be an higher warrant for the doing of them then the commandement of a man. A maine point here intended is this, that Masters are not to be lightly respected because they be after the 7. Obseru. flesh: that is, weake, fraile, of short continuance, of the same na∣ture that seruants are. Lest vpon the forenamed description of masters, seruants Seruants feare of their masters. . should take to themselues too much heart, the Apostle annex∣eth this clause (with feare and trembling, &c.) which hath rela∣tion to the manner of their obedience. No slauish feare is here meant, as if seruants should liue in continuall dread, or trem∣ble at the sight of their masters: a seruant by the tyrannie of some master may be brought so to doe: but to doe so is no Christian dutie: that which the Apostle here requireth is a
dutie belonging to all Christian seruants towards all sorts of masters, euen the mildest that be. It is therefore an awfull respect of the authority of a master, and a dutifull reuerence to his person which is here required: and it is opposed to saw∣cinesse, malepartnesse, boldnesse, stoutnesse, answering againe, murmuring and muttering against their masters, and other like vices. To shew how foule those faults be, and what great respect seruants ought to beare to their masters, these two words (feare, and trembling) are ioyned together: which in Difference betwixt feare and trembling. effect declare one and the same thing: but yet for explication sake they may be distinguished. For . Vers. 33. Feare signifieth a re∣uerend respect of one: it is that which in the former Chap∣ter was required of wiues: though the thing in generall which is required of wiues and seruants is the same, yet the particular manner and measure of a seruants feare is farre different. . Trembling is more proper to seruants: it is a dread of pu∣nishment: and it is required of seruants, not as if they should doe all things simply for feare of punishment, but because God hath put a staffe into a masters hands, seruants must trem∣ble at that power their masters haue, and feare to prouoke them to strike. To this purpose saith the Apostle to subiects in regard of the power which a Magistrate hath, be afraid, for Rom. 13. 3, 4. he beareth not the sword in vaine. Hence learne that The authority of a Master ought to strike a seruants heart with 8. Obser. dread. The dread which seruants ought to haue of their masters power and authority maketh many to care for no more then to auoid their masters displeasure: wherefore the Apostle addeth a further degree of a seruants subiection, namely that . it be in singlenesse of heart, that is, honest, intire, vpright: for this is opposed to hypocrisie, dissimulation, and fraud: yea of YOVR heart, not anothers: another in the simplicity of his heart may thinke you doe a thing better then you doe, by a charitable construction of euerie thing, but if in singlenesse of your owne heart you doe it, it will in truth be as it appeareth to be. So as
All the seruices which seruants performe to their masters must 9. Obser. be done in truth and vprightnesse. The Apostle giues this direction to Christians who haue to doe not only with masters according to the flesh (who only see the outward appearance) but also with the master of spirits 1 Sam. 16. 7. . who looketh on the heart: and therefore also he added this clause, as vnto Christ: teaching seruants thereby that Seruants in their obedience to their masters, must approue 10. Obseru. themselues to Iesus Christ as well as to their masters after the flesh. This phrase (as vnto Christ) implieth as much as that (in the Lord) whereof we spake §. 96. before. §. 125. Of the meaning of the sixt verse. EPHES. 6. 6. Not with eie seruice, as men-pleasers, but as the seruants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. THis and the verse following are added as a further expli∣cation of the last clause of the former verse. It should seeme that seruants, howsoeuer they might in some measure performe the maine dutie of obedience, yet failed exceedingly in the manner of performing it. Because masters were but men, masters according to the flesh, who neither had power ouer the heart, nor could discerne the disposition thereof, seruants thought they had well done their dutie, if they had outwardly performed what their master required: now to root out this bitter weed, and to reforme this corrupt conceit, the Apostle is more large in cleering the point of sincere and vpright ser∣uice: therefore, the more fully to expresse his minde and mea∣ning, first he layeth downe the vice contrarie to the foresaid sincerity (for contraries laid together doe much set forth one Opposita iuxta se posita magis elucescunt. another) and then returneth more distinctly to declare the vertue. Whence note Those points are most to be vrged vpon people, wherein they 11. Obser. most faile. The vice here noted to be contrarie to sincere seruice is ter∣med . eie-seruice. Our English word doth properly and fitly an∣swer
the originall, both in the notation, and in the true sense and meaning of it. It implieth a meere outward seruice only What eie-ser∣uice is. to satisfie the eie of man: And that is twofold, Hypocriticall, Parasiticall.   Hypocriticall seruice is that which is meerely in shew: when that is pretended to be done which indeed is not done; as if a seruant should come from his masters worke all in a sweat, as if he had taken extraordinary paines therein, whereas he hath done nothing at all, but otherwise made himselfe to sweat, or only made a shew of sweat. Parasiticall seruice is that which is indeed done, but in pre∣sence of the master: such seruants are they who will be very diligent and faithfull in doing such things as their masters see, or shall come to their notice: but otherwise behinde their masters backe, and in things which they hope shall neuer come to his knowledge, they will be as negligent, and vn∣faithfull as if they were no seruants. Yet to satisfie their ma∣sters, and to sooth them, they will doe any thing though neuer so vnlawfull. From this vice thus discouered note, that God requireth more then that which may satisfie mans eie. 11. Obser. Gods eie is a piercing eie, and can see much foulnesse, where to mans eie all things seeme very faire: so as they much deceiue themselues who thinke all is well because no man can say to them, blacke is thine eie. Those that content themselues with doing eie-seruice the Men pleasers.  Apostle here termeth men-pleasers: which title he giueth vn∣to them for two especiall reasons. 1. To shew the ground of eie-seruice: which is because all their care is to please their master, who is a man: for well they know that man can see but the outward shew, or that which is done before his face. 2. To shew the hainousnesse of that sinne: for it is tainted with Atheisme, in that the man guilty thereof hath no respect to God: but preferreth his master before God: he careth not to please God so he please his master: for this is the emphasis of that word (men-pleasers) It is spoken in opposition to God,
as the Apostle implieth in another place, saying, If I yet pleased Gal. 1. 10. men, I should not be the seruant of Christ. Obiect. How can it be so hainous a sinne to be men-pleasers, Tit. 2. 9. when the Apostle aduiseth seruants to please their masters in all things? 1. Answ. The aduice there giuen is not simply to please, but to . please well, as the originall word properly signifieth, and the Kings translators haue fitly turned it. 2. Answ. That generall particle (all things) must be re∣strained How masters are to be plea∣sed in all things. to the duties of a seruant, and to all the parts of obe∣dience, which he there mentioneth in the words immediatly going before. Seruants therefore must please their masters in all things that their masters haue power to require at their hands, and they are bound to doe. Men-pleasing, here spo∣ken of, is opposed to pleasing of God. Pleasing of men there mentioned is subordinate to our pleasing of God: here to please men is to sooth them vp in euerie thing good or euill: there to please them is conscionably to obey them in euerie lawfull thing. Here is condemned a seeking to please men in the first place, and that only, and wholly in euery thing, where∣as we ought first to seeke Gods approbation, then the testi∣mony of a good conscience, and after these a pleasing of men, but in, for, and vnder God. Hence then obserue that A seruant must not wholly giue himselfe to sooth and please 12. Obseru. his master: for so may he in many things highly displease Al∣mighty God. To auoid the two forenamed sinnes, eie-seruice, and men-pleasing, the Apostle giueth an excellent direction in these words, as the seruants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart, where we may obserue Seruants of Christ to be opposed to men-pleasers, and doing Gods will from the heart to eie-seruice. Seruants of Christ, are they who know that their masters are in . Christs place, beare his image, haue their authority from him, and are vnder him: so as in seruing their masters they serue Who are ser∣uants of Christ. Christ: and so farre as they may serue both together, they will: but if they proue contrarie masters, and thereupon one of necessity must be left, then they will cleaue vnto the highest master, which is Christ: and in this respect they are called the
Lords freemen, 1. Cor. 7. 22. Thus we see how a seruant may Quo pacto ser∣vus non est ser∣vus? Cum prop ter Deum omnia facit. Chrys. in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. be no seruant, if he doe all things for the Lord. From this opposition betwixt men-pleasers and seruants of Christ, note that They who in all things giue themselues to please men are no ser∣uants of Christ. That we may the better know who are seruants of Christ, 13. Obseru. the Apostle addeth a description of them in these words (do∣ing the will of God from the heart.) Christs will is Gods will: for as Christ is God, the fathers will and his is all one: as he is man he wholly ordereth his will by his fathers, he seeketh not Ioh. 5. 30. his owne will, but the will of the father that sent him. This description of a seruant of Christ the Apostle addeth partly as a direction to seruants to teach them how in seruing their masters, they may be seruants of Christ, (namely, in ha∣uing an eie to Gods word, whereby his will is reuealed both for the matter and manner of all things which they doe) and partly as a motiue to perswade them to be content with their place, and cheerefully to doe their dutie, because so is the will of God. Gods will is that which must direct and settle euery one in the 14. Obseru. things which they doe: for Gods will is the rule of that which is right. Euery thing is very right which he willeth: and no∣thing is right that swerueth from his will. To put a difference betwixt Christ and other masters, and to shew that he looketh not (as man doth) vpon the out∣ward appearance, but beholdeth the heart, the Apostle an∣nexeth this clause (from the heart.) And it declareth that A good thing must be well done. To doe that which is Gods 15. Obseru. will, commended by his word, is for substance a good thing: to doe it from the heart, is the right manner of doing it: That which being good is done after a right manner, is well done.
§. 126. Of the meaning of the seuenth verse. EPHES. 6. 7. With good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men. IN this verse the Apostle doth yet againe inculcate the fore∣named point concerning seruants manner of obeying their masters, and their care therein to approue themselues to their highest master: whence obserue that Matters needfull and weightie are againe and againe to be pres∣sed. 16. Obseru. This is a needfull point, because seruants exceedingly faile therein: and a weightie point it is, because all the com∣fort and benefit of seruice consisteth in Gods approbation. But the former point is not here meerely and barely repeated, but so set downe as other good directions are afforded to ser∣uants What it is to serue with good will. for their manner of obedience. 1. To serue with good will, is somewhat more then with sin∣glenesse of heart. For it further implieth 1. A readinesse and cheerefulnesse in doing a thing; a doing it with a good minde, as the notation of the Greeke word . sheweth. 2. A desire and endeuour that their masters may reape pro∣fit and benefit by their seruice: whereby they shew that they beare a good will, and good minde to their masters. In setting downe seruants duties, the Apostle vseth another word then before in the fift verse, namely this (doing seruice) . wherby he sheweth that a seruants place and dutie is of a more abiect and inferiour kinde then the place and dutie of a childe or a wife: the former word (. obey) was common to all: this word (. doing seruice) is proper to seruants: and the very title of a . seruant, is deriued from thence. Hence note that Though wiues and children be inferiours as well as seruants, yet 17. Obseru. may not seruants looke for such priuiledges as they haue. Another manner of subiection must be performed by seruants. The clause annexed (as to the Lord) is in effect the same . with that in the 5. verse (as to Christ) for by the Lord he here meaneth The Lord Christ. But it is added to meet with a secret Obiection. For if seruants should say, You require us to serue Obiect.
our masters with good will, but what if they be hard-hearted and regard not our good will, but peruert our good minde? The Apo∣stle Answ. giueth them this answer, Looke not so much to men and their reward, as to God and his reward: serue men in and for the Lord, euen as if you serued God: so shall not your seruice be in vaine. The inference of the eighth verse vpon this, sheweth that this is it which the Apostle here intendeth. Learne therefore that An eie is to be cast vpon God euen in those duties which we per∣forme 18. Obseru. to men: and that both for approbation and reward from God. The negatiue clause which followeth in these words (and not to men) is not simplie to be taken (for then would it thwart the maine scope of the Apostle in this place) but compara∣tiuely in relation to God, and that in two respects. 1. That seruice be not done only to men. 2. That seruice be not done to men in and for themselues. Seruice must be done to God as well as men: yea In that ser∣uice 19. Obseru. which we doe to men, we must serue God. Men must be ser∣ued for the Lords sake, because the Lord hath commanded it, because they beare the Lords image, and stand in his stead: in the Lord, and vnder the Lord. From this large declaration of the manner of doing seruice Difference betwixt ser∣uants of men, and of Christ. to masters note the difference betwixt such seruants as are ser∣uants of men, and such as are seruants of Christ. 1. They doe all to the eie. These all from the heart. 2. They seeke to please men. These doe the will of God. 3. They doe their seruice discontentedly. These cheerefully. 4. They doe all vpon selfe-loue. These with good will. §. 127. Of the meaning of the eight verse. EPHES. 6. 8. Knowing that whatsoeuer good thing any man doth, the same shall he receiue of the Lord whether he be bond or free. GReat is the ingratitude of many masters: they will exact Why seruants are put in minde of Gods reward. all the seruice that a poore seruant possibly can doe, but slenderly recompence his paines: yea, it may be, very euilly re∣ward
the same, not affording competent food, clothing, lodging, but frownes, checkes, and blowes. Now to vphold seruants in such straits, and to incourage them to doe their du∣tie whether their masters regard it or no, the Apostle in this verse laboureth to raise vp their mindes to God: and to shew vnto them that he regardeth them, and will sufficiently reward them, so as Seruants labour shall not be in vaine in the Lord. To presse 20. Obser. this incouragement the more vpon them, he setteth it downe as a thing granted by all, so cleere as none of them can be ig∣norant thereof (Knowing) as if he had said, ye all well enough . know that what I now say is most true: hence note that Gods respect of faithfull seruants is so well knowne, as none that 21. Obser. haue any vnderstanding can be ignorant thereof. The Apostles argument is drawne from the generall to a par∣ticular, A genere ad speciem. and the generality is noted in the thing done (whatso∣euer) and in the person that doth it (any man.) But because the generalitie of the thing might be too farre stretched, he addeth this limitation (good) and because the generalitie of the person might be too much restrained, he addeth this ex∣plication (whether bond or free.) This distinction is vsed be∣cause in those daies many seruants were bond-men and bond∣women. Now the Apostles argument may thus be framed: Euery one of what estate and degree soeuer he be, shall be rewarded of God for euery good thing he doth, be it great or small. There∣fore euery seruant shall be rewarded of God for euery good seruice. The recompence promised is set forth vnder a concise speech (the same shall he receiue) meaning that he shall receiue . a reward for the same: that phrase hath relation to the crop which an husbandman receiueth of the corne he sowed, which is of the same kinde he sowed: 1 Cor. 15. 38. the seed being wheat, the crop is of wheat: the 2 Cor. 9. 6. seed being plentifully sowed, the crop will be plentifull: to the same purpose saith this Apostle in another place, whatsoeuer a man soweth . that shall he also Gal. 6. 7. reape. Now to applie this, seruants that by their faithfull ser∣uice bring honour and glory to God, shall againe receiue ho∣nour and glorie. If they aske of whom they shall receiue it, the
Apostle expresly answereth, Of the Lord: for it is the Lord that . said, 1 Sam. 2. 30. Them that honour me will I honour. God will not forget them, though their masters may. From this verse thus opened, I gather these particular obser∣uations, concerning seruants. 1. Seruants may and ought to applie vnto themselues generall 22. Obser. promises made to Christians. Otherwise this generall argument of the Apostle is to little purpose in this place. 2. A Christian may be a bond-slaue: for the Apostle directeth this incouragement to Christians, among whom he presuppo∣seth 23. Obser. some to be slaues, opposing them to free-men, who also were seruants. 3. Faithfull seruice performed to men is a good thing: for the 24. Obser. good things which seruants especially doe is in their seruice. 4. As God accepteth not men because they are free, so neither 25. Obser. reiecteth he them because they are bond. It is not the person, but the worke that he regardeth. 5. The faithfull seruice of seruants is as good seed sowen: it 26. Obser. will bring forth a good crop. The metaphor here intimated implieth as much. 6. God is honoured by the faithfull seruice of seruants: this is 27. Obser. intimated by the application of Gods reward to them, for God honoureth none but them which honour him. §. 128. Of the connexion of masters duties with seruants. EPHES. 6. 9. And ye masters doe the same things vnto them, forbearing threatning: knowing that your master also is in heauen: neither is there respect of persons with him. TO the duties of seruants the Apostle adioyneth the duties of masters, saying, AND ye ma∣sters: whence learne that Masters are as well bound to du∣tie as seruants. A like doctrine was no∣ted from the connexion of parents duties with chil∣drens: there you may see this generall further ampli∣fied, 1. Obser. §. 115. 1. Gods law requireth as much: for it expresly inioyneth
many duties to masters (as in the eighth treatise following we shall see.) 2. So doth also the law of nature which hath tied master and seruant together by a mutuall and reciprocall bond, of do∣ing good, as well as of receiuing good. 3. The law of nations requireth also as much: For in all nations where euer there was any good gouernment, and where wise, and good lawes were made, particular lawes of the duties of masters haue beene made. 4. The law of equitie doth so also. One good deserueth another good: therefore the Apostle saith to masters, giue vn∣to your seruants that which is iust and equall. Col. 4. 1. Now let masters take notice hereof: and know that God the great Lord of all hath made this relation betwixt master and seruant, and hath set each of them in their seuerall and distinct places for the mutuall good of one another, so as seruants are no more for the good of masters, then masters are for the good of seruants. Wherefore, as they looke for dutie, let them per∣forme dutie: if seruants faile in their dutie, let masters see if they themselues be not the cause thereof, by failing in theirs. Their authoritie will be no excuse before Christ, but a meanes to aggrauate their fault, and increase their condemnation: for the greater the talent is, the more diligence is expected, and the straiter account shall be exacted. §. 129. Of the meaning of this phrase, Doe the same things. These two titles (Masters, Seruants) are so taken here as they were §. 124. before in the fift verse. All the duties of masters are comprised vnder this phrase, doe the same things: which at first sight may seeme to be some∣what . strange: for may some say, The things which seruants must doe are these, to feare, to obey, to doe seruice, with the like, and are masters to doe the same things? Answ. 1. These words are not to be referred to those par∣ticular duties which are proper to seruants, but to those gene∣rall rules of equitie which are common to masters as well as seruants; namely, that in their seuerall places, with singlenesse of heart, as vnto Christ, not with eie seruice as men pleasers, but as the seruants of Christ they doe the will of God from the heart.
2. Those words may be referred to the eight verse, the verse going immediatly before, which laieth downe a gene∣rall rule for all men in their seuerall places to doe the good things of their places. Now then as seruants must haue an eie to their places to doe the good things thereof, so masters must doe the same things: that is, they must haue an eie to their pla∣ces, to doe the good things thereof. 3. Those words may be taken without reference to any for∣mer words, and expounded of a mutuall, reciprocall, and proportionable dutie that ought to passe betwixt master and seruant: not in the particulars, as if the same duties were to be performed by each of them, for that were to ouerthrow the order and degrees which God hath set betwixt master and seruant, to crosse Gods ordinance, and inferre contradiction: but in generall, that duties are to be performed of each to other: in which respect the Apostle said §. 3. before of all sorts, superi∣ours, and inferiours, Submit your selues one to another. And thus by this phrase the doctrine before mentioned is confir∣med, that Masters are as well bound to dutie as seruants. None of these answers thwart another, but all of them may well be admitted, and all of them well stand together. They all imply a common equitie betwixt masters and seruants, but no equalitie: mutuall duties, but diuers and distinct duties, appertaining to their seuerall places. Compare with this text, that which the Apostle himselfe hath more plainly and fully noted (Col. 4. 1.) and we shall obserue him to expound his own meaning, for that which here he implieth vnder this phrase (the same things) that he expresseth there vnder these two words, iust, equall: whereof we shall Treat. 8. §. 20, 44. hereafter more distinctly speake. Purposely doth the Apostle infold masters duties vnder this generall phrase (the same things) to preuent a secret obiection raised from the eminency and superioritie of masters aboue seruants, which maketh them thinke, that seruants are only for the vse of masters, and that masters are no way tied to their seruants. But if in the generall masters must doe the same things, then they are for their seruants good, as well as seruants for theirs.
§. 130. Of masters forbearing threatning. The Apostle in these words (forbearing threatning) doth . not simply forbid all manner of threatning, but only prescribe a moderation thereof: and Or, mode∣rating. so much haue the Kings transla∣tors well expressed in the margin against this Text. Threat∣ning is a dutie which, as occasion serueth, masters ought to vse, and that to preuent blowes. But men in authoritie are na∣turally prone to insult ouer their inferiours, and to thinke that they cannot shew their authoritie but by austerit ie: for which reason the Apostle dehorteth husbands from Col. 3. 19. bitternesse, and parents from Ephes. 6. 4. prouoking their children to wrath. Besides, the See Treat. 8. §. 14. Gentiles and Heathen thought that they had an absolute power ouer seruants, and that of life and death: whereupon the Roman Emperors made lawes to restraine that rigour: for they would vse their seruants like beasts. Now that Christian masters should not be of the same minde, the Apostle exhor∣teth them to forbeare threatning. Hence note that Authoritie must be moderated and kept in compasse: else will 2. Obser. Authoritie to be kept in compasse. it be like a swelling riuer without bankes and wals. Threatning is here put for all manner of rigor, whether in heart, looke, words, or actions: for it is vsuall in Scripture to put one instance for all of the same kinde. Forbearing, implieth a restraint of all manner of excesse, as 1. In time and continuance: when there is nothing but continuall threatning vpon euery small and light occasion. 2. In measure; when threatning is too fierce, and violent, so as it maketh the heart to swell againe, and as it were fire to come out of the eies, and thunder out of the mouth, and the body to shake in euery part thereof. 3. In execution; when euery vengeance once threatned shall surely be put in execution, though the partie that caused the threatning be neuer so sorie for his fault, and humble him∣selfe, and promise amendment, and giue good hope thereof. Woe were it with vs the seruants of the high God, if he should so deale with vs. Here note that men may exceed in doing a bounden dutie: and 3. Obser. Excesse in du∣tie not good. so turne a needfull vertue into an hurtfull vice: great respect
therefore must be had to the manner of doing good and lawfull things. Yet further for the extent of this prohibition, we are to know that vnder the vice forbidden the contrarie vertues are commanded, as mildnesse, gentlenesse, patience, long suffe∣ring, with the like. §. 131. Of masters subiection to a greater master. The latter part of this verse containeth a reason to enforce the directions in the former part. The reason in summe layeth downe that subiection wherein masters are vnder God. A point whereof none of them could be ignorant, and therefore he thus setteth it downe, knowing: for, . All men know that there is an higher then the highest on earth. 4. Obseru. The light of nature reuealeth as much, no Pagan, much lesse Christian, can be ignorant thereof. In that speaking to ma∣sters he telleth them that they haue a master, thereby he giueth them to vnderstand, that They which are in authoritie, are also vnder authoritie: masters 5. Obseru. 1 Tim. 6. 15. Gen. 50. 19. haue a master. For God is Lord of Lords, Master of masters. In this respect saith Ioseph a great Gouernour, am not I vnder God? These two little particles (euen your, or your also) adde some . emphasis: hauing reference to seruants, as if he had said, as well your master, as your seruants master. Some Greeke co∣pies, for more perspicuitie, thus read it (both your and their ma∣ster) . the sense is all one which way soeuer we read it: It shew∣eth that in relation to God, Masters and seruants are in the same subiection, and vnder a 6. Obseru. Matth. 23. 8. & 18. 28. like command. There is one master, euen Christ: and all men whosoeuer are brethren, fellow-seruants. §. 132. Of Gods being in heauen. That great Master, vnder whom all masters on earth are, is here said to be in heauen, the more to commend and set forth his dignitie and authoritie: and to make masters to stand in the more awe of him: To like purpose Dauid hauing set forth God Psal. 2. 4, 10, 11. sitting in the heauens, inferreth this exhortation vnto the great Commanders on earth, Be wise now therefore, ôye Kings, be in∣structed, ye Iudges of the earth: Serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce with trembling.
Object. This placing of God in heauen, maketh such as feare not God the more insolent and secure: for they will be readie to thinke and say, How doth God know? can he iudge thorow the Iob 22. 13, 14. darke cloud? Thicke clouds are a couering to him that he seeth not, and he walketh in the circuit of he auen? Answ. 1. The Apostle wrote to Christian masters, who thought better of God then such Atheists did. 2. The placing of God in heauen doth not bound him with∣in the compasse thereof: for 1 King. 8. 27. the heauen, and the heauen of hea∣uens cannot containe him. Ier. 23. 23. He filleth heauen and earth. Matth. 5. 34, 35. Though heauen be his throne, yet the earth also is his footstoole. But be∣cause the Lord doth most manifest his glorie in heauen, and from heauen, therefore . by an excellencie is he said to be in hea∣uen: and that in three especiall respects. 1. To shew that there is no proportion betwixt him and earthly masters, be they neuer so great. For as the heauen is higher then the earth, so is God more excellent, yea infinitely more excellent then any man. Who is like vnto the Lord our God Psal. 113. 5. who dwelleth on high? There is no such difference betwixt ma∣sters and seruants on earth. 2. To shew that he hath his eyes continually on all his ser∣uants: he seeth euerie thing that they doe, as one placed aboue others seeth all that are vnder him. Psal. 102. 19. From heauen doth the Lord behold the earth. & 33. 13. The Lord looketh from heauen, he beholdeth all the sonnes of men. Prou. 15. 3. The eyes of the Lord are in euerie place, beholding the euill and the good. So as this phrase noteth the cleane contrarie to that which was before obiected by wicked Atheists. 3. To shew that he is Almightie: able both to recompence his faithfull seruants (whereupon Dauid saith, Unto thee lift I Psal. 123. 1. vp mine eyes, ô thou that dwellest in the heauens) and also to exe∣cute vengeance on those that are vnfaithfull to God, and cruell to their seruants (whereupon saith Salomon, if thou seest oppression Eccles. 5. 8. &c. maruell not: for he that is higher then the highest regardeth.) From this place of God (in heauen) we learne these lessons. 1. The eie of faith is needfull to behold God withall, for hea∣uen 7. Obseru. Heb. 11. 27. is too high for any bodily eie to pierce into. But by Faith did Moses see him who is inuisible.
2. Though masters had none on earth aboue them, yet is there 8. Obseru. one higher then they. There is a master in heauen. 3. They who cannot be heard on earth, haue yet one to appeale 9. Obser. vnto. There is a master in heauen. 4. The command vnder which earthly masters are, is farre 10. Obseru. greater then that which they haue: for their commander is in heauen. §. 133. Of Gods hauing no respect of persons. The Apostle further addeth of God the great master of all, that with him there is no respect of persons. The Hebrew word vsed to set forth this point signifieth  a face: so doth also the Greeke word here translated . person: it signifieth both face and person. Now we know that the face of a man is outward, and that which of all other parts maketh him most amiable in anothers eie. It is opposed to that which is inward, euen the heart: in which respect it is said that the Lord seeth not as 1 Sam. 16. 7. man seeth, for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. Here by a Synecdoche, face or person is put for euery outward quality, state, or condition which maketh one to be preferred before another in mans appro∣bation, as beautie, comelinesse, stature, wealth, honour, autho∣ritie, and the like. Now in that God receineth not, or respecteth not persons, it sheweth that God preferreth not any one before another for any the forenamed outward respects, or any other like to them. Elihu plainly expoundeth this phrase in these words, he accepteth not the person of princes, nor regardeth the Iob. 34. 19. rich more then the poore. The phrase is taken from them that sit in thrones of iudgement, where their eies should be blinded, that they may not see the face or person of those that are brought before them: but only heare the cause. This properly is here noted of God, to meet with a vaine conceit of many masters, who though they know that God is their master as well as their seruants master, yet thinke that God will not call them so straitly to account, but wil suffer and tolerate them, because they are of a higher ranke, and in a bet∣ter condition then seruants: But by this phrase the Apostle sheweth that To God all are alike: he putteth no difference betwixt any. 11. Obser.
He will shew fauour to the meanest, as well as to the greatest: he will take vengeance of the greatest as well as of the meanest. Many good lessons may be learned from hence: as among other, these, 1. The poorest and meanest that be may haue as free accesse to God as the wealthiest and greatest: and their sure shall be as soone receiued. 2. The great ones on earth, haue as great cause to feare the reuenging hand of God for any sinne, as meane ones. 3. It becommeth magistrates and all in authority to carrie themselues impartially towards all that are vnder them: for they are in Gods roome. Respect of persons is the cause of all that iniustice and wrong which magistrates doe. 4. It becommeth ministers to be faithfull in all Gods house, and with an euen hand to sow the seed of Gods word, and to keepe themselues pure from the bloud of all men: for they are Gods stewards and ambassadors; and therefore they must haue no re∣spect of persons.
The second Treatise. PART I. Of Husband and Wife, who are so to be accounted. §. 1. Of those who may seeke to be maried. HAuing in the former treatise laid downe the foundation of all domesticall duties, by ex∣pounding the words of the Apostle, I purpose now distinctly to lay them forth in order: be∣ginning with the first and chiefest couple in the family, Man and Wife. Here we are first to speake of the persons who are to be ac∣counted true and lawfull husband and wife: and then of the duties which they owe each to other. So as this Treatise consisteth of two parts. 1. The first declareth, who are man and wife. 2. The second noteth out those common mutuall duties which they owe one to another. First of the first. Husband and wife are they who are rightly ioyned toge∣ther Who are husband and wife. by the bond of mariage. See Treat. 1. §. 82. & 84. Whereby two are made one flesh. For the better cleering of this point, we will consider both the parties that may be so nearely ioyned together, and also the manner how they are rightly ioyned in so firme an vnity. About the parties we are to search, 1. Who may seeke a mate for mariage. 2. What kinde of mate is to be taken. 1. All they who are able without ineuitable danger to their Who may marie. yoake fellow to performe the essentiall duties of mariage, may be maried.
Out of this proposition arise three questions to be dis∣cussed. 1. Who are to be accounted able? 2. What danger is ineuitable? 3. Whether mariage be free for all but such? §. 2. Of ripenesse of yeares in them that are to be maried. 1. They are to be accounted able who haue Ephebi. Vt iustas nup∣tias contra∣hant, sint mas∣culi puberes, foeminae viri∣potentes. Iustin. Instit. l. 1. tit. 10. past the floure of their age, and are not by defect of nature, or any other occa∣sion made impotent. 1. Ripenesse of yeares is absolutely necessary for consum∣mating a iust and lawfull mariage: wherefore as God at first, made Adam of full age, so when he sought out a wife for him, he made her of full age too: he made her a woman, not a childe. Gen. 2. 22. 1 Cor. 7. 36. Where the Apostle aduiseth parents to take care for the ma∣riage of their children, he putteth in this prouiso, if they passe the floure of their age. Child-hood is counted the floure of age. While the floure of the plant sprouteth, the seed is greene, vn∣fit to be sowen. Quest. How long lasteth the floure of age? Answ. Iustin. Instit. l. 1. tit. 22. Second part of Reports of Cases. 35. Hen. 6. fol. 41. b. The ciuill law, and common law also, set downe twelue yeares for the floure of a females age, and foureteene, of a males; which is the least: for before those yeares they can haue no need of mariage, nor yet are well fit for mariage, so as if they forbeare some yeares longer, it will be much better for the parties themselues that marie, Est invenum coniugium in∣commodum liberorum pro∣creationi. Cum enim in omni∣bus animanti∣bus imperfecti sunt iuniorum partus, ac multo etiam magis foeminarum, id etiam fiat in hominibus necesse est. Arist. Pol. lib. 7. for the children which they bring forth, for the family whereof they are the head, and for the common wealth whereof they are members. Note the ages of the Kings of Israel and Iudah when they were first maried, and we shall finde few of them to be vnder twenty, and those few, not aboue one or two yeares vnder: and yet of all sorts of people the Kings did vse to marie the soonest, that so they might haue heires betimes. Obiect. 1 Chr. 22. 5. & 29. 1. Salomon was but a childe when he came to the crowne, and yet 2 Chro. 12. 13. he had then a childe of a yeare old at least. Answ. He was said to be a childe not simply, but compara∣tiuely, 1 King. 2. 22. in relation to his other brothers which were elder then he, & & 3. 7. in regard of that great worke he was to vndertake. In the time of his reign he is saidto be 1 King. 11. 4. old: which could not be
if he had beene in yeares a childe when he began to reigne: for he reigned but fortie yeares. 2. Obiect. Ahaz was but twentie yeare old when he be∣gan to reigne, and reigned but sixteene yeares, and yet when he died Hezekiah his sonne was fiue and twentie yeare old, 2 Chro. 28. 1. & 29. 1. by which computation Ahaz had a childe when he was but eleuen, or twelue yeare old at most. 1. Answ. Some say that this was extraordinary, and render this reason, Ahaz so young a father as Elizabet an old mother, Broughton in his Concent of Script. should haue hoped in Emmanuel of a virgin. 2. Answ. The beginning of that reigne when Ahaz was but twentie yeare old, is to be referred to Iotham his father; for Ahaz was twentie yeare old when he (namely Iotham) began to reigne: as 2 Chro. 36. 9. Iehoiachin was eight yeare old, when he (namely his father Iehoiachim) began to reigne: for Iehoia∣chin was 2 King. 24. 8. eighteene, when he himselfe began to reigne. Obiect. Iotham was but 2 Chro. 27. 1. twentie and fiue yeare old when he began to reigne, how then could Ahaz his sonne at that time be twentie? Answ. Iotham was fiue and twentie yeare old when his father Vzziah was strucke with leprosie, from which time he 2 Chro. 26. 21. reigned as King euen in his fathers life time. But after his fa∣ther was dead, the kingdome was established to him alone Parents sinne in marying children vn∣der age. after a more solemne manner; in which respect it is said that then he began to reigne: and then was his sonne Ahaz twen∣tie yeare old, Iotham himselfe being about fortie. Contrarie to the forenamed fitnesse of age is the practise of Puella dum ei aetas matura non est, nulli dari vel pro∣mitti debet. Aug. epist. 233. Matrimonium contractum ve∣rum non est si impubes fuerit qui contraxit. Azpilcuet. Consil. & resp. l. 4. de spons. Cons. 8. such parents, or other friends of children, as make matches for them in their child-hood, and moue them to consent, and so cause them to be maried: such mariages are mock-ma∣riages, and meere nullities. For children cannot know what appertaineth to mariage, much lesse can they performe that which is required of maried persons: their consent therefore is iustly accounted no consent, vnlesse they doe ratifie it after they come to yeares. §. 3. Of impotent persons that ought not to seeke after mariage. 2. They are to be accounted impotent, and in that respect
vnable to performe the essentiall duties of mariage, who (to vse the Scripture phrase) were borne Eunuchs from their mothers Mat. 19. 12. wombe: or by any accidentall occasion are so made: as they who are defectiue, or closed in their secret parts: or taken with an incurable palsie: or possessed with frigidity, or any other such like impediment. These ought not to seeke after mariage: for by those signes of impotencie God sheweth that he calleth them to liue single. Contrarie to this manifestation of Gods will doe they sinne, A sinne to conceale any impotencie. who conceale their impotencie and ioyne themselues in mar∣riage, whereby they frustrate one maine end of mariage, which is procreation of children; and doe that wrong to the partie whom they marie, as sufficient satisfaction can neuer be made. §. 4. Of barrennesse, that it hindereth not mariage. Quest. Are such as are barren to be ranked among those impotent persons? Answ. No, there is great difference betwixt impotencie and barrennesse. 1. Impotencie may by outward sensible signes be knowne Sterilem con∣iugem fas non est relinquere. Aug. de Nup. lib. 1. cap. 10. and discerned, barrennesse cannot: it is not discerned but by want of child-bearing. 2. Impotent persons cannot yeeld due beneuolence: but such as are barren may. 3. Impotencie is incurable: but barrennesse is not simply so. Many after they haue beene a long while barren haue be∣come fruitfull: and that not only by an extraordinary worke of God aboue the course of nature (as Gen. 18. 11. Sarah and Luk. 1. 7. Elizabeth, with whom by reason of age it ceased to be after the manner of women) but also by such a blessing as might stand with the course of nature, being obtained by praier (as Gen. 25. 21. Rebeckah and 1 Sam. 1. 5, 20. Annah) whereof daily experience giueth good euidence: for many after 10, 15, 20, and more yeares barrennesse haue brought forth children. On these grounds many Saints, who haue beene barren, haue maried, and their practise therein not disallowed, nor their mariage dissolued. Tantum valet sociale vinculū coniugum, vt cùm causa pro∣creandi colligitur, nec ipsa causa procre∣andi soluetur. Aug. de bon. Coniug. cap. 7. For though procreation of children
be one end of mariage, yet is it not the only end: and so inuio∣lable is the mariage bond, that though it be made for childrens sake, yet for want of children it may not be broken. §. 5. Of that ineuitable danger which hindereth mariage. 3. They who are infected with such contagious diseases, as diffuse themselues into those who haue societie with them, and infect them also, ought not to seeke after mariage: for that cannot but turne to the danger of the partie with whom they marie. It was for mutuall good one of another Gen. 2. 18. that God ordained the law of mariage; to vse it to the hurt and danger of one another, is against the maine end of the first institution. The law of shutting vp a leper from all societie with men proueth as much; for if lepers might not haue mutuall so∣ciety 2 Chro. 26. 21. with any man, much lesse might they haue matrimo∣niall societie with a wife or an husband. By contagious diseases not only both the parties which company together will be infected, but also their issue: whereby their disease which otherwise might die with them∣selues, is propagated to their posterity. A like restraint may be applied to such foule and loathsome diseases, as make the company and society of that person, who is infected there∣with, irkcsome, and odious to their companion. Contrarie to the end and vse of mariage doe they sinne, A sinne to conceale a contagious disease. who conceale such diseases, and so ioyne themselues in ma∣riage, to the vnanswerable preiudice of the partie whom they marrie. §. 6. Of the lawfulnesse of mariage to all sorts of persons. Where there is no such iust impediment as hath beene be∣fore mentioned, it is lawfull for all sorts of people of what . calling or condition soeuer to marrie. For Mariage is honou∣rable Heb. 13. 4. in all, or among all, namely in, or among all sorts of peo∣ple: whereupon it is accounted a Doctrine of deuils to forbid 1 Tim. 4. 1, 3. to marrie. For it is a Doctrine contrarie to Gods word, and a Doctrine that causeth much inward burning, and outward pollution, and so maketh their bodies, which should be tem∣ples of the holy Ghost, to be sties of the deuils. The disease, for the redressing whereof mariage is sancti∣fied,
is a common disease which hath infected all sorts of peo∣ple: why then shall not the remedy be as common? In this case the Apostle saith indefinitly of all, without ex∣ception of any, to auoid fornication let euery man haue his owne 1 Cor. 7. 2, 9. wife, and let euerie woman haue her owne husband. And againe, If they cannot containe let them marie: for it is better to marie then to burne. Obiect. Mat. 19. 12. There be Eunuchs which haue made themselues Eu∣nuchs (that is, haue abstained from mariage and liued in a sin∣gle A deuillish doctrine to forbid mari∣age. life continently) for the kingdome of heauens sake. Answ. That is spoken of some particular persons to whom the gift of continency was giuen: not of any distinct condi∣tions, and callings, as if all and euerie one of this or that cal∣ling had so done or were able so to doe: whereupon Christ addeth this clause, He that is able to receiue it, let him receiue it, and the Apostle to the same purpose saith, 1 Cor. 7. 7. euery one hath his proper gift of God. Contrarie to this necessarie and warrantable libertie, is the impure and tyrannicall restraint of the Church of Rome, whereby all that enter into any of their holy orders, are kept from mariage. Doe they not herein Act. 15. 10. tempt God by putting a yoke vpon mens necks, which neither our fathers nor we are able to beare? Uide Chrysost. hom. 4. in Isay 6. No such restraint was euer enioyned by Gods word to any of those holy functions which he ordained: for vnder the Law it was lawfull for high Priests, ordinarie Priests, all sorts of Leuites, and extraordinarie Prophets, to marie: and vnder the Gospell, for Omnes Apo∣stoli exceptis Iohanne & Paulo vxores habuerunt. Ambr. in 2 Cor. 11. Apostles, Bishops, Deacons, and all Ministers of the word. Tolle de Ec∣clesia honora∣bile connubi∣um, nonne re∣ples eam con∣cubinarijs in∣cesluosis, semi∣nifluis mollibus, masculorum concubitoribus, & omni deni∣que genere im∣mundorum? Bernard. in Cant. Serm. 66. vide Bernard. de Conuers. ad ler. cap. 29. Fearefull haue beene the effects of this Diabolicall do∣ctrine: as fornication, adulterie, incest, Sodomie, buggerie, and what not? Many wiues put from their husbands, be∣cause their husbands were Ministers, and many Ministers put from their calling because they had wiues: many children by this meanes basely borne, and among them many in their in∣fancie cruelly murthered. Huldricus, seu vt alij, Volusia∣nus in Epist. ad Nichol. Pap. Six thousand heads of infants were found in the ponds of a religious house. How many more thousands haue beene from time to time cast into other ponds, or buried in gardens, or other places, or other wayes conuey∣ed
out of sight? Deuillish must that doctrine needs be, which hath such deuillish effects. Vtinam qui continere non valent perfecti∣onem temerariè profiteri, aut coelebatui dare nomina vere∣rentur. Sump∣tuosa siquidem turris est, & verbum grande, quod non omnes capere possunt. Bernard. de Conuers. ad Cler. serm. 29. Well did he wish, that wished that all they who cannot containe, would take heed how they doe rashly professe perfection, and vow virginitie. §. 7. Of the things which are absolutely necessarie to make a person fit for mariage. They who haue power to marie must be carefull in chusing an helpe meet for them: for Gen. 2. 18. Necessarie for the essence of mariage. this was Gods care when first he in∣stituted mariage. To make an helpe meet for mariage, some things are absolutely necessary for the very essence or being of mariage; others, necessarie for the comfort and happinesse of mariage. In regard of the former sort, there must be chosen, 1. One of the same kinde or nature: for among all the creatures which were made, Gen. 2. 20. Buggerie. there was not found an helpe meet for man: therefore God out of his bone and flesh made a woman of his 1. Persons of the same kind. owne nature and kinde. Contrarie to this is the detestable sinne of buggerie with beasts, expresly forbidden by the Leu. 18. 23. law. A sinne more then beastly: for the bruit beasts content themselues with their owne kinde: Monstrous it is in the kinde thereof: and a cause of abominable monsters. Vide Aug. de Ciuit. Dei lib. 15. cap. 23. & Lud. Uivem in eundem de Incubis, & Succubis. Contrary also is that copulation which witches haue with deuils: then which none more vnnaturall, none more prodigious and odious. 2. One of the contrarie sex: the male must choose a female: the female a male. Thus God hauing made Adam a male, 2. Persons of diuers sexes. Maritalis co∣pula requirit sexuum aptitu∣dinem. Bern. in Cant. serm. 66. Vnnaturall commixtions. Rom. 1. 25, 26. made Eue a female, and ioyned them in mariage. A coniuncti∣on of these different sexes is only fit for increase of mankinde, and other mariage duties. Contrarie are those vnnaturall commixtions of parties of the same sex: which the Apostlereckoneth vp as iudgements in∣flicted on the heathen, because they changed the truth of God in∣to a lie, and worshipped, and serued the creature more then the Creator. 3. One beyond those degrees of consanguinitie and affinitie which Persons without the degrees of consanguinity. are forbidden by the law of God: these degrees are expressed by Moses Leuit. 18. 6, 7, &c. and explained in a table of the de∣grees
of consanguinitie and affinitie within which none may mary, appointed to be hung vp in euery Church. Contrary is incest, a sinne not only forbidden by Gods Incest. O mulieris sce∣lus incredibile, & praeter hanc vnam in omni vita inauditū. O libidinem effrenatam & indomitam! O audaciam, singularem! Non timuisse vim deorum, hominumque famam? Vicit pudorem libido, timorem auda∣cia, rationem amentia. Cic. pro. A. Cluent. word, but so horrible euen to the heathen as (to vse the Apo∣stles words, 1 Cor. 5. 1.) it is not so much as named among the Gentiles. Excellently is that censure verified by the heathen Orators patheticall exclamation against one Sassia who ma∣ried her sonne in law, in these words: O incredible wickednesse of a woman, not heard of in any age but this! O vnbridled and vn∣tamed lust! O singular boldnesse! Not to feare the power of God, and fame of men! &c. Lust, impudencie, madnesse, ouercame shame, feare, and reason. What may we now thinke of the dispensations which the Pope giueth for incestuous mariages, allowed vnto great Prin∣ces euen by the §. 24. cap. 5. Tridentine councell? doth he not herein shew himselfe to be that man of sinne, who opposeth and exalteth himselfe aboue all that is called God? 4. One that is free: nor maried, nor betrothed to another: the law of mariage noteth thus much in this clause, Mat. 19. 5. They two shall be one flesh. And in that Deut. 22. 22, 23, 24. the law inflicteth the same pu∣nishment 2 Thes. 2. 3, 4. 4. Persons that are free. vpon the person which being betrothed commit∣teth vncleannesse, that it doth vpon a maried person, it is eui∣dent that it is vnlawfull to marie one betrothed to another, as well as one maried to another. So firme is a contract, as the law calleth a betrothed maid, a wife: and a betrothed maid might not be put away without a bill of diuorce. Contrary is Bigamy, and Polygamy, whereof Treat. 1. §. 83. before: vnto which head may be referred mariages with such as haue beene espoused to others before. These are vtterly vnlawfull. §. 8. Of the lawfulnesse of other mariages after one of the maried couple is dead. 1. Quest. Are they who haue buried their husband or wife so free, as they may marie againe? Answ. Yea, as free as they who were neuer before maried. The law doth not only permit a widow to marie againe: but Deut. 25. 5, 9. if her husband died before he had any children, it comman∣ded the next kinsman that was liuing and free to marie her, that he might raise vp seed to his brother deceased: which if
he refused to doe, a penalty of ignominy was inflicted on him: the widow reiected was to loose his shooe from his foot, Non concederet hoc Paulus nisi liceret. At pa∣rum dico conce∣dit: vult quo{que}. Volo, inquit, adole∣scentiores nube∣re: nec dubium quin viduas dicat. Bern. serm. 66. in Cant. and to spit in his face in the presence of the Elders. The Apostle expresly saith that a woman, when her husband is dead, is at liberty to be maried (1. Cor. 7. 39.) yea speaking of young wi∣dowes he further saith, I will that they marie (1. Tim. 5. 14.) This libertie which the Prophet of God, and Apostle of Christ grant to a wife, can by no shew of reason be denied to an hus∣band: for the bond of mariage giueth them a like power ouer one anothers body, (1 Cor. 7. 4.) and knitteth one as inuio∣lably as the other, (Mat. 19. 6.) Husbands therefore as well as wiues haue vsed this libertie, as Abraham (Gen. 25. 1.) Rom. 7. 2. The Apostle that giueth this libertie, rendreth a reason thereof, ta∣ken from the limitation of that time wherein maried persons haue power one ouer another, and that is the time of this life only: For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband, so long as he liueth: but if the husband be dead she is loosed, &c. On this ground all the §. 24. Quid largam benedictionem nuptiarum restringis? Bern. loc. itat. Dominus tot maritorum mu∣lierem nulla suae sententiae signi∣ficatione dam∣nauit. Aug. de bon. Vid. c. 12. reasons which war∣rant or moue such as neuer were maried, to mary, may be ap∣plied to them that by death haue their yoake-fellow taken from them. 2. Quest. May this libertie be extended any further then to a second mariage? Answ. We finde no restraint from a third, or fourth, or more mariages, if by the diuine prouidence so many wiues, or hus∣bands one after another be taken away while there is need for the suruiuing partie to vse the benefit of mariage. The woman of Samaria that had fiue husbands one after another, is not bla∣med for being maried to so many, but for liuing with one (af∣ter the other were dead) that was not her husband, (Ioh. 4. 18 Neither did the Lord condemne that woman which was said to haue seuen husbands one after another, (Mat. 22. 25, &c.) Contrarie is the opinion of Secundas nuptias pro for∣nicationibus habent. Aug. de haer. §. 26. Montanists, and Cataphryges, ancient heretiques that accounted those mariages which the suruiuor made after the death of a yoke-fellow, to be adulte∣rous: with which heresie Tertullianus factus est haere∣ticus quia tran∣siens ad Cata∣phryges cepit se∣cundas ruptias nquam upra damnare. Ibid. §. 86. Tertullian an ancient and learned father was so farre infected, as he wrote a treatise in defence thereof. It seemeth by their arguments that one maine ground
of their error was a misinterpretation of those Scriptures which forbid men to haue two wiues at once, and women to haue two husbands at once, as, Two shall be one flesh, Gen. 2. 24. A Bishop and a Deacon must be the husband of one wife, 1 Tim. 2. 2, 10. Let a widow be taken that hath beene the wife of one hus∣band, 1 Tim. 5. 9. These are indeed expresse texts against such Digamists, and Polygamists as haue beene described Treat. 1 §. 83 before: but they make no more against second or other after-mariages one mate being dead, then against first mariages. Into the roll of these heretiques may they be put, who denie such after ma∣riages to any kinde of Ministers. So doe our aduersaries: they Ministerijs mi∣norum ordinum exercendis suffici possunt coniugati, dum∣modo non biga∣mi. Concil. Trid. §. 23. c. 17. Vide Bellarm. de Cler. l. 1. c. 23. exclude such as are maried againe after one wife is dead from such functions of inferiour orders, as they admit those who are but once maried vnto. They alleage many of those Scrip∣tures which Montanists doe (as 1 Tim. 2. 2, 10. and 5. 9) which sheweth that they are infected with the same heresie, though they pretend to renounce it. §. 9. Of equalitie in yeeres betwixt husband and wife. That matrimoniall societie may proue comfortable, it is re∣quisite Acqualē ducito Pittaci dictum. Sivis nubere, nube pari. Ouid. 1. Equalitie in age. that there should be some equalitie betwixt the parties that are maried in Age, Estate, Condition, Pietie. 1. For Age, as the partie that seeketh a mate must be of ripe yeeres, fit to giue consent, and able to performe mariage du∣ties, so the mate which is taken must be somewhat answerable . Arist. Eth. l. 8. c. 12. Luk. 1. 7. in age: if one young, both young: if one of middle age, both so: if one growne to yeeres, the other also. It is noted of Zacharie and Elizabeth, that both were well striken in yeeres. If both were old together, then both also were young together. Equalitie in yeeres maketh maried persons more fit for pro∣creation of children, for a mutuall performance of mariage duties each to other, and for making their companie and socie∣tie euery way more happie. This equalitie is not ouer strictly to be taken, as if the maried couple were to be iust of the same age, but only for some an∣swerablenesse in yeeres: which may be though there be a di∣sparitie Most meet that husbands be elder then wiues. of fiue or ten, or somewhat more yeeres: especially if the excesse of yeeres be on the husbands part: for besides that according to the ordinarie course of nature a mans strength
and vigour lasteth longer then a womans, it is very meet that the husband should be some what elder then his wife, because he is an head, a gouernour, a protector of his wife. The Scrip∣ture noteth many husbands to be elder then their wiues (as Abraham was tenne yeeres elder then Sarah; and if we Gen. 17. 17. narrowly marke the circumstances of the histories of Isaac and Iacob, and their wiues, we shall finde that the husbands were elder then their wiues) To my remembrance an appro∣ued example of an husband younger then his wife cannot be giuen out of Scripture. Contrary to this equalitie in yeeres, is the practise of many Vnmeet for aged persons to mary young ones. men and women, who being aged, to satisfie their lust, or for some other by-respect, mary such as are but in the floure of their age, wherein they doe many times much faile of their ex∣pectation: for those young ones finding the societie of aged folkes to be burdensome, and irksome vnto them, soone be∣gin to loath the same, and thereby cause more griefe and vexa∣tion, then euer they did giue comfort and contentment. On the other side, others there be who in the prime and Vnmeet for young persons to mary aged. strength of their age, for wealth, honour, or such like respects, mary those that with age begin to be decrepit, and vnfit to be maried, hoping that they will not long liue, but that with a lit∣tle trouble they shall purchase much dignitie or riches, & after a while be free againe. But God oft meeteth with such in their kinde, by prolonging the life of those aged persons, and so ma∣king the burden to be much more grieuous and tedious then was imagined, and by taking away those young ones sooner then they looked for, whereby it commeth to passe that all their hopes perish. Ne discrepent aetates sic vt vir suscipere liberos possit; mulier non possit; aut haec possit, ille non possit. Ex his enim seditiones, discordiae{que}, &c. Arist. Pol. lib. 7. The heathen obserued inequalitie in yeeres to be occasions of many mischiefes, and thereupon pre∣scribed rules against it. §. 10. Of equalitie in estat and condition betwixt those that are to be maried together. 2. Some equalitie in outward estate and wealth is also be∣fitting Equalitie in estate. Premitur mag∣no coniuge nupta minor. Ouid. epist. 9. the parties that are to be maried together, lest the dis∣paritie therein (especially if it be ouer-great) make the one nsult ouer the other more then is meet: for if a man of great wealth be maried to a poore woman, he will thinke to make
her as his maid-seruant, and expect that she should carrie her selfe towards him so as beseemeth not a yoake-fellow, and a bedfellow: so as such an one may rather be said to be brought vnto bondage, then mariage. And if a rich woman mary a poore man, she will looke to be the master, and to rule him: so as the order which God hath established will be cleane peruerted: and the honour of mariage laid in the dust. For where no order is, there can be no honour. 3. The like may be said of outward condition, that therein 3. Equalitie in condition. Eas vxores quas inferioris gradus homines ducant, hi qui altioris digni∣tatis sunt duce∣re legibus prop∣ter dignitatem prohibentur. also there be some equalitie: that Princes, Nobles, and Gentle∣men, mary such as are of their owne ranke: and the meaner sort such as are of their degree. Note what sort of wiues Abraham, Isaac, and Iaacob maried, and it will appeare that they had re∣spect to this paritie. Disparitie in condition as well as in estate, is a meanes to make men and women swell and insult aboue that which is meet: yea and to twit one another in the teeth with their former estate and condition. Contrary on the one side are the practises of such as affect Digest. lib. 23. cap. 2. §. 49. A fault to affect to mary a person much aboue ones ranke. Qui longè prae∣stantiores se ducunt, non coniugum viri, sed serui fiunt dotiū. Plut. de Instit. liber. Pro. 14. 1. and 12. 4. to mary aboue their owne estate and degree: thinking by such mariages to aduance themselues. This is the only thing which many seeke after in seeking wiues and husbands; whereby it commeth to passe that they oft meet with the worst matches, and make their mariage a kinde of bondage vnto them. Great portions make many women proud, daintie, lauish, idle, and carelesse; a man were much better, euen for helpe of his out∣ward estate, to mary a prudent, sober, thriftie, carefull, diligent wife, though with a small portion, then such an one. A proud backe, a daintie tooth, and a lauish hand will soone consume a great portion; but a wise woman buildeth her house: and a ver∣tuous woman is a crowne to her husband. Many wiues also that are maried to very rich husbands, are more stinted and pin∣ched in their allowance, then such as are maried to men of meaner estate. It is not the meanes which a man hath, but his minde and disposition that maketh him free and bountifull to his wife. Contrarie are the mariages which men of great authoritie A fault to ma∣ry a person much vnder ones ranke. and abilitie make with meane women, yea their owne maids many times, and those of the lowest ranke, their kitchin∣maids.
parties part that is to be maried: and then if that partie be vnder the gouernment of parents, the matter must be moued to them, before there be any further proceeding therein, as Sampson who seeing and liking a daughter of the Philistims, Judg. 14. 2. told his father and his mother thereof. Yea though the partie be not vnder the gouernment of any, yet it is very meet that counsell be taken of wise and vnderstanding friends: that in a matter so weightie as mariage is, there may be the aduice of more heads then one, for the preuenting of such mischiefes as through rashnesse might fall out. After a liking is thus taken by one partie of a meet mate, that liking must be moued to the other partie so liked, to know whether there be a reciprocall affection of one towards another. Thus Sampson went and Iudg. 14. 7. talked with that woman whom he liked to be his wife. If at first there be a good liking mutually and thorowly setled in both their hearts of one another, loue is like to continue in them for euer, as things which are well glued, and setled be∣fore they be shaken vp and downe, will neuer be seuered asun∣der: but if they be ioyned together without glue, or shaken while the glue is moist, they cannot remaine firme. Mutuall loue and good liking of each other is as glue. Let the parties to be maried be herein well setled before they come to meet with trials through cohabitation, and that loue will not easily be loosened by any trials. Contrarie is the adulterous and brutish practise of such as Too eager and hasty pursuing after mariage, a brutish thing. so soone as they cast their eie on any whom they like, neuer aduise or consult about a right and due proceeding vnto ma∣riage, but instantly with all the eagernesse and speed they can, like brute beasts, seeke to haue their desire and lust satisfied. Though to keepe themselues free from the penalty of the lawes vnder which they liue, they procure meanes to be ma∣ried, yet they declare a lustfull and adulterous minde. And their practise is too like to the practise of the Beniamits, who catcht wiues from among the daughters of Shiloh as they were dancing: or else to the practise of the old world, which so grieued the Spirit of God, that it repented him that he had Iudg. 21. 23. made man, and thereupon he was moued to bring a generall deluge on the whole world. Their practise was this, that they
tooke them wiues of all that they chose: that is, they rashly and Gen. 6. 2. suddenly maried whomsoeuer they liked, without any consi∣deration of their condition. §. 14. Of a contract what it is? II. When both parties haue manifested a mutuall liking Ubi non est con∣sensus vtrius∣que, non potest esse matrimo∣nium. Instit. iur. can. lib. 2. de nupt. tit. 11. each to other, and vpon mature deliberation and good aduice doe conceiue one to be a fit match for another, it is requisite that a ioynt consent and absolute promise of marying one another before sufficient witnesses be made. This rightly made is a contract, which is the beginning of a mariage. The right making of a firme contract consisteth in two things: 1. In an actuall taking of each other for espoused man and wife. 2. In a direct promise of marying each other within a con∣uenient time. So as a forme of contract may be made to this purpose; First the man taking the woman by the hand to say, I A. take thee B. to my espoused wife, and doe faithfully pro∣mise to marie thee in time meet and conuenient. And then the woman againe taking the man by the hand to say, I B. take thee A. to my espoused husband, and doe faithfully promise to yeeld to be maried to thee in time meet and conuenient. This mu∣tuall and actuall taking of one another for espoused man and wife in the time present, and a direct promise of marying one another afterwards, setleth such a right and property of the one in the other as cannot be alienated without licence had from the great Iudge of heauen, who hath by his diuine ordi∣nance setled that right. §. 15. Of the grounds of a contract. Quest. Is a contract absolutely necessary? Answ. Though it haue beene an ancient custome continued Mos ille vete ribus erat ante multum tem∣pus sponsalia facere. Chrys. in Gen. Hom. 43. in all ages, yet I dare not pronounce it to be so absolutely ne∣cessary, as the want thereof should nullifie a mariage, and make it to be no lawfull mariage. But surely it is so meet and requi∣site, as I would aduise all Christians that desire a blessing and good successe on their mariage to be contracted before they are maried.
If there were no other ground for it but this, that God hath sanctified it, and commended it vnto vs by his word, it were enough to perswade such as feare God to vse it. For I demand, why doth God commend vnto his Church any thing by his word, but that his Church should make con∣science of vsing it? Now that by Gods word it is commended, is without contradiction most euident. For, not to insist on that argument which, not without good probability, is allea∣ged for the antiquity of a contract, and thus collected from Gods ordering of that first ancient mariage betwixt Adam and Gen. 2. 22. Euah, God brought Euah to Adam on the first day that they were created to see how he would like her, and vpon the sight of her, and notice which withall he had of her, by that wis∣dome which God gaue him, he then tooke her to himselfe: which taking is supposed to be but a contract, because Gen. 4. 1. he did not know her till after his fall. If it be obiected that Adam and Euah are called Gen. 2. 25. man and wife in the time of their innocencie. It may bee answered that those titles Deut. 22. 24. Gen. 19. 14. Consuetudine Scripturarum sponsi viri, & sponsae vocantur vxores. Hier. in Mat. 1. are in Scripture giuen to such as are only contracted, to shew the neere and firme coniunction betwixt parties espoused. But not to insist on that which is but probable, it is more then probable that Lots daughters were contracted: for it is said that Gen. 19. 14, 8. Quia iam de∣sponsatio facta erat, ideo vocat eos generos. Chrys. in hunc loc. Lot had sonnes in law which maried (or rather should marie) his daughters: and withall it is said that they had not knowne man: now then it must needs follow that they were called Lots sonnes in law because his daughters were espoused to them. But most euident for this purpose is that difference which the Deut. 22. 22, &c. law putteth betwixt a pure vir∣gin, an espoused maid, and a maried wife. So as contracted persons are in a middle degree betwixt single persons, and maried persons: they are neither simply single, nor actu∣ally maried. To shew that this custome of a contract be∣fore mariage continued in Gods Church among the Saints, it is expresly noted that Marie the mother of the Lord Luk. 1. 27. Iesus who liued many hundred yeares after that law, was contracted.
§. 16. Of the reasons which shew how requisite a contract is. Many good and weightie reasons may be alledged to shew how requisite it is that a contract should go before mariage. For 1. It addeth much to the honour of mariage, that it should be deliberatly and aduisedly step after step, by one degree after another consummated and made vp. 2. It putteth a difference betwixt such as intend mariage in the feare of the Lord, for such holy ends as are warranted in the word, and such as intend it only to satisfie their lust, or for other like carnall ends. For these can admit no delay, as was noted In the end of §. 13. before. But they that vse this solemne preparation by a contract before mariage, shew that they desire to haue all things fit for so sacred a matter duly performed; and there∣fore they are content to make some stay for the better effecting thereof. 3. It is a meanes of knitting the hearts of the two parties to be maried more firmely and inuiolably together before they come to dwell together. For a contract being the beginning of a mariage, it is an euident demonstration of Gods counsell concerning the parties contracted, that God hath prepared them each for other to be man and wife: so as after the con∣tract is made, they may simply and absolutely pray each for o∣ther, that God would blesse them one to another, to liue com∣fortably and happily together. Before a contract is made, they can but vpon supposition (if God haue appointed them to be man and wife) pray one for another. For oft it falleth out that after many great hopes and likelihoods of proceeding in such or such a match, by some occasion or other it is cleane broken off: but a lawfull contract knitteth so firme a knot as cannot be broken: so as a man may conclude that being contracted to a woman she shall be his wife: and so may a woman con∣clude of a man. The consideration hereof will further moue them more narrowly to obserue what good qualities, or what other things, which may make them more louely one to ano∣ther, are in each other. 4. It is a meanes to make them before hand prepare them∣selues to perfome such mariage duties as Gods word requireth of man and wife. For a contract giueth them assurance of
mariage if they liue vnto it: so as then they cannot but know that it is high time for them to thinke how they are to carrie themselues, when they come to liue in house together: and withall to consider, what crosses ordinarily doe accompanie the maried estate, that they may be before hand prepared wisely to passe them ouer, or patiently to vndergoe them. 5. It may be a meanes of discouering many hidden and close inconueniences, which otherwise would neuer come to light. For many friends fearing lest the discouering of some euils which are carried closely, should make a breach betwixt themselues and their friends, will not make them knowne till they see some vrgent necessitie to moue them so to doe. Though the euill be such, as being knowne would hinder mariage, yet till they see some sure euidence, that they shall indeed be maried (if no iust exception be put in) they will hope that some other occasion may fall out to hinder the mari∣age, and in that respect conceale their exception. But because a contract is the beginning of mariage, after they haue notice therof, they will not forbeare to disclose what they know. For this end is it, that the contract is three seuerall times openly published in the Church, that if any doe know any iust cause why such persons as are contracted may not lawfully proceed to mariage, they make knowne the same. A commendable cu∣stome: and great pitty, that it is so much neglected as it is. 6. It may preuent many plots and practises of inueigling, or stealing away maids and widowes. For it oft falleth out, that when parents or other friends haue prouided a good match for their daughter, or for some other vnder their go∣uernment, and all things on all parts well concluded, the wedding day appointed, and all things fitted and prepared for the solemnizing of the wedding, some desirous to forestall that mariage, by secret and cunning deuices get the bride a∣way a few daies before, if not on the very morning of the in∣tended wedding day, and mary her out of hand to another. That which maketh men so bold is, that they know a clande∣stine mariage being consummate shall stand firme in law. But a legall contract preuenteth such mischiefes, because it maketh such a furtiue mariage vtterly void. None therfore knowing
that a contract is lawfully made before hand, will be so bold, or rather so mad, as to offer to frustrate a mariage after any such manner. 7. It is a meanes to stirre vp the parties which are to be maried, more carefully and diligently to prouide all things fit for their dwelling together, and well ordering their houshold before hand; that they be not to seeke for necessaries when they should vse them. For being contracted, they know that it cannot be long ere they must come to dwell together. §. 17. Of abusing, or neglecting a contract. There are two extremes contrarie to the forenamed doctrine of a contract. One of attributing too much to it: another of derogating too much from it. Many make it a very mariage, and thereupon haue a greater solemnitie at their contract, then Nonnullis spon∣sis tam impotens est ardor libidi∣nis, vt corpuscu∣lo puellari vim adferant. Eras. in Inst. Matr. at their mariage: yea many take libertie after a contract to know their spouse, as if they were maried: an unwarrantable and dishonest practise. Lots daughters were See §. 15. contracted to husbands, and yet they are said to haue knowne no man. The law stileth her that is contracted Deut. 22. 24. a maid, to shew that she ought to keepe her selfe a virgin till the mariage be consummate. Therefore Mary is thus described, Luk. 1. 27. a virgin espoused. But it is the common course of most to make light account of this warrantable and honourable proceeding to mariage by a con∣tract. Few there be in comparison of the multitudes that are maried, who make any conscience thereof. They thinke it needlesse, and vtterly neglect it. No maruell that they meet with many mischiefes and inconueniences, when the meanes of preuenting the same are not vsed. Let such duly weight the reasons rendred in the former section. §. 18. Of the distance of time betwixt the contract and mariage. Quest. What distance of time must passe betwixt the ma∣king of a contract, and consummating of mariage? Answ. This must be left to the wise consideration of the parties contracted, and of their friends, for the same time can∣not precisely be prescribed to all. Occasions may fall out ei∣ther of hastening, or putting off the mariage. Only extremes on both sides must be auoided. Neither ought the mariage be
too suddenly solemnized vpon the contract: (then the ends and reasons of a contract, before mentioned, are made void) nor yet too long put off (then may Satan take occasion to tempt them for their incontinencie.) The laudable custome of our and other Churches sheweth, that at least three weekes must passe betwixt contract and mariage. For the contract is Rubr. before the forme of solemnizing of matrimony. to be three times published, and that but once a weeke before the wedding be celebrated. And we read that the virgin Mary was at least three moneths contracted before Ioseph tooke her to wife. For when the Angell first came to her she was Luk. 1. 27. 56. espoused: after that she went to her cosen Elizabeth, with whom she abode three moneths: and then being returned home Ioseph was warned by an Angell to take her to wife. I Mat. 1. 20. note not this as a rule for euery one precisely to follow. For the virgin Mary had a iust occasion to tarrie three moneths with her old cosen Elizabeth: and so may others haue occasi∣ons to put off their mariages: which may be lawfull, so the mariage be not put off too long, and that there be a mutuall and ioynt consent of both parties. For after the contract is made, neither the man nor the woman haue the power of their owne body. Contrary is that vnwarrantable course which many take, to Vnlawfull for parties con∣tracted long to absent themselues each from other. Deut. 24. 5. be affianced and made sure to a wife, and then to trauell be∣yond sea, or to any other place, and be absent from their spouse a yeere, or two, or three, or it may be more yeeres. If a man might not goe to warre, nor be charged with any businesse that should draw him from his wife the first yeere of his mariage, much lesse may he absent himselfe for any long time after he is contracted but not maried. This may be a meanes to alienate the heart of his spouse from him for euer. §. 19. Of a religious consecrating of mariage. III. The last degree of consummating a mariage, is the open and publike solemnization thereof: which consisteth 1. In a religious consecration thereof. 2. In a ciuill celebration   A religious consecration of mariage is performed by the blessing of a publike Minister of the word in the open face of the Church in the day time. This of old hath beene vsed of
Christians, and still is continued among vs. Though we haue neither expresse precept, nor particular patterne in Gods word for this manner of solemnizing a mariage (for there is no particular forme thereof set downe in the Scripture) yet it be∣ing agreeable to the generall rules thereof, we ought in con∣science to subiect our selues thereto. The generall rules are these, Let all things be done decently, 1 Cor. 14. 40. and in order. The Churches of God haue such a custome. Submit 1 Cor. 11. 16. your selues to euery ordinance of man for the Lords sake, with 1 Pet. 2. 13. the like. But the foresaid manner of consecrating mariage, is very decent and in good order, a laudable custome of the Churches, and an ordinance of those gouernours vnder whom we liue. Therefore warrantable, and to be obserued. Neither is this order, custome, and ordinance appointed with∣out iust and weightie reasons. For 1. Mariage is a kind of publike action: the well or ill ordering therof much tendeth to the good or hurt of family, Church, and common-wealth. For by mariage families are erected, and Church and common-wealth increased and continued. 2. Heb. 13 4. Mariage is honourable. Treat. 1. §. 80, 81, 82, &c. The most sacred and inuio∣lable bond that knitteth any two persons together. 3. Mariage is Prou. 2. 17. Gods couenant, wherein he himselfe hath a maine and principall stroke. For God is the chiefest agent in ioyning man and woman in mariage. On these grounds it hath beene thought very requisite that mariage should be solemnized in the day time (as a worke of light that need not be couertly and closely done) and that in a publike place, whether any, that will, may haue free accesse, either to except against it, and hinder it (if there be iust cause) or to be a witnesse thereof, and to adde his blessing thereto. And among publike places the Church is thought the fittest, because it is the house of praier, where persons and actions are most solemnly blessed. And of all persons a publike Minister is thought to be the meetest to celebrate mariage, and to ioyne Coniugium be∣nedictione sa∣cer dotali sancti∣ficari oportet. Ambr. epist. 70. the parties to be maried, together, because he stands in Gods roome, and in and by his ministerie God ioyneth them toge∣ther, and blesseth them: so as after the minister hath rightly ioyned man and wife together in matrimony, it may be well
said, Those whom God hath ioyned together, let no man put asunder. The forme of consecrating mariage, which is prescribed in our liturgie or common-prayer-booke, doth so distinctly, per∣spicuously, and fully set downe whatsoeuer is to be obserued and done by the parties to be maried, their parents, or other gouernours, and the Minister that ioyneth them together, that I can adde nothing thereunto. There are declared the grounds, ends, and vses of mariage. There open proclamation is made whether any can except against the intended mariage. There each partie is solemnly charged, that if either of them doe know any impediment, why they may not lawfully be maried, to disclose it. There also each partie is openly demanded if freely and willingly they will take one another for man and wife. There the duties of maried persons are declared, and they seuerally asked whether they will subiect themselues thereto or no. All which being openly professed, the parent or some in his stead is called forth to giue the Bride to the Bridegroome. Then they two actually taking each other to be man and wife, and testifying the same by expresse words, and by mutuall pledges, the Minister in Gods name ioyneth them together, pronounceth them to be lawfull husband and wife, and by prayer craueth Gods blessing vpon the action, and vpon their persons. Thus is the mariage consecrated, and they two made one flesh, that is, lawfully ioyned together by the inuiolable bond of mariage. §. 20. Of clandestine mariages. Contrary are clandestine mariages, such as are made in pri∣uate houses, or other secret places, or in Churches without a sufficient number of witnesses, or in the night time, or with∣out a lawfull Minister of the word, with the like. As such see∣king of secrecie taketh much from the honour and dignitie of mariage, so it implieth some euill cleauing thereto: For euery Ioh. 3. 20. man that euill doth hateth the light. There is little hope that such mariages should haue any good successe. For where such meanes as are sanctified for obtaining a blessing on mariage are neglected, what blessing can thereupon be expected?
§. 21. Of a ciuill celebrating of mariage. Though vpon the forenamed consecrating of mariage it be in regard of the substance thereof fully consummate, yet for the greater solemnity of so honourable a thing, it is very requisite that further there be added a ciuill celebration of it: vnder Magnifico con∣uiuio nuptiae ce∣lebrantur: laeta omnia, munera sponsalia, &c. Greg. Naz. ad Vital. vide plura ibid. de coniugij solennitate. Mariage a time of re∣ioycing. which I comprise all those lawfull customes that are vsed for the setting forth of the outward solemnitie thereof, as meeting of friends, accompanying the Bridegroome and Bride both to and from the Church, putting on best apparell, feasting, with other tokens of reioycing: for which we haue expresse war∣rant out of Gods word. For the generall, that the mariage time is a time of reioy∣cing, some gather from the notation of the word, as if it were stiled mariage of merry age. But to let that passe, The Scrip∣ture vseth to set forth a time of reioycing by the Isa. 62. 5. ioy of the Bridegroome ouer his Bride, and stileth Ier. 33. 11. the voice of a Bride∣groome and a Bride, the voice of ioy and gladnesse. And on the contrary counteth it a iudgement, when Ier. 7. 34. Ioel 2. 16. ioy is taken away from the Bridegroome and the Bride. For meeting of friends at the time of mariage, it is noted that Gen. 29. 22. Laban gathered together all the men of the place, when his daughter was maried. And when Sampson was maried, Iudg. 14. 11. they brought thirtie companions to him. And when a friend of the virgin Marie was maried, Ioh. 2. 2. Iesus and his Disciples, be∣sides many other, were inuited thereto. And in the parable of the mariage of the Kings sonne, it is noted that Mat. 22. 3. many guests were bidden to the wedding. In all which histories it is further noted, that feasts were made at the solemnizing of those maria∣ges. And the phrases which the Prophet vseth of Isa. 61. 10. Ier. 2. 32. a Bride∣groomes decking himselfe with ornaments, and a Brides adorning her selfe with Iewels, giue warrant for putting on the best ap∣parell at that time. Here by the way let good heed be taken, that the things which may lawfully be vsed, be not vnlawfully abused, as commonly mariage-festiuities, and that especially in fea∣stings, are. §. 22. Of ill or well ordering mariage feasts. Mariage feasts are abused, Abuse of ma∣riage feasts.
1. When they are made at an vnseasonable time: as on the Jsa. 22. 12, 13. Lords day, or in a time of mourning. 2. When they exceed the abilitie of him that maketh the Luk. 15. 13. feasts. 3. When the abundance prepared, is immoderatly taken, Luk. 21 34. euen to gluttony and drunkennesse. The lewd practise of drinking healths to the Bridegroome and Bride, oft causeth much excesse in drunkennesse. 4. When too much time is spent therein. Isa. 5. 11. 5. When God is cleane forgotten therein, and the compa∣nie poysoned Isa. 5. 12. with corrupt communication, vnchaste songs, and the like. 6. When the needy and distressed are not remembred Am. 6. 6. therein. For preuenting of these abuses, a seasonable time for cele∣brating Direction for mariage feasts mariage must be chosen out: and moderation vsed both by him that maketh the feast, and also by them that par∣take thereof: moderation I say in the measure of eating and drinking, and in the time spent therein: which time must be sanctified with such communication as is good to the vse of edify∣ing, that it may minister grace vnto the hearers. And for the more cheerefulnesse therein, witty questions and doubtfull rid∣dles may be propounded (as Sampson did) to exercise the wit Iudg. 14. 12. Eph. 5. 19. and iudgement of the guests: there may be also singing Psalmes and hymnes and spirituall songs, making melodie in their hearts to the Lord. Yea further, that the mariage meeting, mirth, and fea∣sting may be the better sanctified, good choice is to be made of the guests that are inuited thereto. Hereof we haue a wor∣thy patterne in those who were maried in Cana of Galile, Ioh. 2. 1, 2. nd inuited to their feast Iesus, his mother, and his Disciples. Such as Iesus, will minister occasion of sauourie and sanctified communication, whereby all the guests may be much edified. uch as the virgin Mary will be a good example of modesty, brietie, and other like Christian graces. Such as the Disci∣ples, will be farre from scorning and deriding wholsome and ood instructions, but rather giue all diligent heed thereunto, d lay them vp in their hearts. Aboue all, that the mirth and ioy of mariage be not dampt,
as Belshazzars was, let them that are maried, and all that come Dan. 5. 5. to reioyce with them, be sure that they haue true assurance of their spirituall mariage with Christ, and of a good right in him to the creatures which they vse. Otherwise their sinnes will be as that hand-writing which appeared to Belshazzar on the wall. Finally, in regard of that libertie which God giueth with plentie and abundance to eat of the fat, and drinke of the Nehe. 8. 10. sweet, let the poore that scarce haue sufficiencie be remembred. Thus by a right celebrating of mariage, is it much honou∣red: and man and wife with much honour are brought together. §. 23. Of the honour of mariage in regard of the first instituti∣on thereof. Great reason there is why mariage should with such honour be solemnized. For it is a most honourable thing. Honoura∣ble in the institution, ends, priuiledges, and mysterie thereof. No ordinance was more honourable in the first institution thereof, as is euident by the Author thereof, the Place where it was instituted, the Time when it was instituted, the Persons who were first maried, and the Manner of ioyning them together. 1. The Author and first Institutor of mariage was the Lord Gen. 2. 18, 21, 22 God. Could there haue beene a greater, or any way a more excellent Author? 2. The Place was Paradise; the most faire, glorious, plea∣sant, honourable, commodious, and euery way most excellent place that euer was in this world, Place, though it be but a circumstance, addeth much to the honour of a thing. Solemat ordinances are made in honourable places. Thus with vs ma∣riages are solemnized in Churches, not in priuate houses. 3. The Time was the most pure and perfect time that euer was in the world, when no sinne or pollution of man had stai∣ned it, euen the time of mans innocencie. Puritie addeth much to the honour of a thing. 4. The Persons were the most honourable that euer were euen the first father and mother of all mankinde, they who had an absolute power and dominion ouer all creatures, and
to whom all were subiect. None but they euer had a true mo∣narchy ouer the whole world. 5. The Manner was with as great deliberation as euer was vsed in instituting any ordinance. For first the three glorious Gen. 2. 18. Cui hoc dicitur? non creatae alicui potentiae, sed ei qui exse natus est, Con∣siliario admi∣rabili, &c. Chrys. in Gen. hom. 14. persons in the Trinity doe meet to aduise about it. For The Lord God said, and to whom should he speake? not to any crea∣ted power, but to him that was begotten of himselfe, that Won∣derfull, Counseller, &c. In this consultation this ordinance is found to be very needfull: (It is not good for man to be alone) thereupon a determination is set downe, to make an helpe meet for man. For the better effecting hereof the Lord proceedeth thereto very deliberatly, by sundry steps, and degrees. 1. All the creatures that liued on the earth, or breathed in the aire, are brought before man, to see if an helpe meet for him might be found among them. 2. Euery of them being thorowly viewed, and found vn∣fit, another creature is made and that out of mans substance and side, and after his image. 3. This excellent creature thus made is by the maker ther∣of presented to man, to see how he would like it. 4. Man manifesting a good liking to her, she is giuen to him to be his wife. 5. The inuiolable law of the neere and firme vnion of man and wife together is enacted. Let all the forenamed branches concerning the first insti∣tution of mariage expresly recorded by the holy Ghost be well weighed, and we shall easily see that there is no ordinance now in force among the sonnes of men so honourable in the insti∣tution thereof, as this. §. 24. Of the Ends of Mariage. 2. The Ends for which mariage was ordained adde much to the honour thereof. They are especially three. Prima societas in ipso coniugio est &c. Id autē est principium vrbis, & quasi seminarium reip. Cic. Offic. lib. 1. 1. That the world might be increased: and not simply in∣creased, but with a legitimate brood, and distinct families, which are the seminaries of cities and common-wealths. Yea also that in the world the Church by an holy seed might be preserued, and propagated, Mal. 2. 15. 2. That men might auoid fornication (1 Cor. 7. 2.) and
possesse their vessels in holinesse and honour. In regard of that Qui tentatio∣num procell as cum difficultate salutis tolerant, coniugij portum petant. Greg. in Post. part. 3. admon. 28. pronenesse which is in mans corrupt nature to lust, this end addeth much to the honour of mariage. It sheweth that ma∣riage is as an hauen to such as are in ieopardy of their saluation through the gusts of temptations to lust. No sinne is more hereditary; none whereof more children of Adam doe partake, then this. Well might Christ say (Mat. 19. 11) all men receiue not this saying. Of all the children of Adam that euer were, not one to a million of those that haue come to ripenesse of yeares haue beene true Eunuches all their life time. Against this heredi∣tary disease no remedie is so soueraigne as this. Yea for those that haue not the gift of continency this is the only warran∣ted, and sanctified remedy. 3. That man and wife might be a mutuall helpe one to Ad adiumen∣tum mulier data est viro. Ambr. Offic. l. 1. c. 28. another, (Gen. 2. 18.) An helpe as for bringing forth, so for bringing vp children; and as for erecting, so for well gouer∣ning their family. An helpe also for well ordering prosperity, and well bearing aduersity. An helpe in health and sicknesse. Ut non solum honestè, sed & commodè viuat. Chrys. in Gen. 2. hom. 14. An helpe while both liue together, and when one is by death taken from the other. In this respect it is said (Pro. 18. 22.) who so findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, which by the rule of relation is true also, of an husband. Licet adiuvent hominem labo∣ribus suis multa irrationabilla, nullum tamen par est rationali mulieri. Chrys. ibid. No such helpe can man haue from any other creature as from a wife; or a woman as from an husband. §. 25. Of the Priuileges of mariage. III. If (Rom. 3. 1. as once of circumcision) it be demanded what is the priuilege, aduantage, and profit of mariage, I answer, Much euery way. 1. By it men and women are made Husbands and Wiues. 2. It is the only lawfull meanes to make them Fathers and Mothers. 3. It is the ordinarie meanes to make them Masters and Mistresses. All these are great dignities, wherein the image and glorie of God consisteth. 4. It is the most effectuall meanes of continuing a mans Unusquis{que} in liberis suis quo∣dammodo re∣nascitur &c. Plato dè Leg. lib. 4. name and memory in this world, that can be. Children are liuing monuments, and liuely representations of their parents.
5. Many priuileges haue of old beene granted to such as were maried. Appian. lib. 2. debel. ciu. In pleading causes, or giuing sentence, they had the first place; and in choice of offices they were preferred. Sucton. in Aug. In meetings they had the vpper hand. Arist. Polit. li. 2. cap. 7. & Codic lib. 10. tit. 63. And if they had many children they were exempted from watchings, and other like burthensome functions. Among vs, if the younger sister be maried before the elder, the preheminency and precedency s giuen to the younger. The priuileges and honours which are giuen to maried persons, were questionlesse the ground of that custome which Laban mentioneth of his country; that the younger was not to Gen. 29. 26. be maried before the elder. §. 26. Of the mysterie of Mariage. IIII. Great is that mysterie which is set forth by mariage, namely the sacred, spirituall, reall, and inuiolable vnion be∣twixt Christ and his Church: which is excellently deciphe∣ed in Salomons Song, and in Psal. 45. and expresly noted, Eph. 5. 32. Hereby man and wife who intirely, as they ought, loue one another, haue an euident demonstration of Christs loue to them. For as parents by that affection which they beare to their children, may better discerne the minde, and meaning of God towards them, then such as neuer had childe, so may maried persons better know the disposition of Iesus Christ, who is the spouse of euery faithfull soule, then single persons. §. 27. Of Mariage and single life compared together. Let now the admirers and praisers of a single estate bring forth all their reasons, and put them in the other scole against mariage. If these two be duly poised, and rightly weyed, we shall finde single life too light to be compared with honest mariage. All that can be said for the single estate, is grounded vpon accidentall occasions. Saint Paul, who of all the pen-men of holy Scripture hath spoken most for it, draweth all his commendations to the head of Expediency, and restraineth all vnto 1 Cor. 7. 26. . present necessity. Obiect. He vseth these words (Vers. 1. good, and Vers. 38. better.) Answ. Those words haue relation not to vertue, but to ex∣pediencie: neither are they spoken in opposition to vice and
sinne, for then would it follow, that to marie (which is Gods ordinance, and honourable in all) were euill and sinfull: which is to reuiue Saturniliani de quibus Epiph. haer. 23. that ancient heresie, that mariage is of the deuill. Si quis coin∣quinationem vocet legitimā commixtionem, habet inhabita∣torem draco∣nem Aposta∣tam. Ignat. Epist. ad Phi∣lad. Of old they who haue called lawfull mariage a defilement, haue beene said to haue the Apostate dragon dwelling in them. But the Apostle stileth that good, which is commodi∣ous, and that better which is more expedient: and yet not simply more expedient, but to some persons at some times. For if any haue not the gift of continency, it is not only com∣modious or more expedient that they marie, but also abso∣lutely necessarie. They are commanded so to doe (1 Cor. 7. 9.) Yet on the other side, if any haue the gift of continency, they are not simply bound from mariage; there be other occasions, beside auoiding fornication, to moue them to marie. It is therefore truly said that Virginity is not commanded, but adui∣sed vnto. Uirginitas non est iussa sed admonita. Ber∣nard. de modo benè viu. serm. 21. We haue no precept for it, but leaue it to the power of them that haue that power. So farre forth as men and women see iust occasion of abstaining from mariage (being at least able so to doe) they are by the Apostle perswaded to vse their liberty and keepe themselues free. But all the occasions which De virginitate praeceptum non habemus: vo∣lentium pote∣stati id relin∣quimus. Constit. Apost. li. 4. cap. 14. moue them to remaine single arise from the weaknesse and wickednesse of men. Their wickednesse who raise troubles against others, their weaknesse who suffer themselues to be disquieted and too much distracted with affaires of the family, care for wife, children, and the like. Were it not for the wic∣kednesse of some, and weaknesse of others, to please an hus∣band 1 Cor. 7. 32, 33, 34. or a wife, would be no hiderance to pleasing of the Lord. If therefore man had stood in his intire and innocent estate, no such wickednesse or weaknesse had seized vpon him: and then in no respect could the single estate haue beene prefer∣red S. Ecclesia & virginitatem glorificat, & nuptias pudi∣cas honorat. Epiph. haer. 48. before the maried. But since the fall, Virginity (where it is giuen) may be of good vse: and therefore the Church doth giue due honour both to virginity and mariage. §. 28. Of celebrating mariage with sorrow. Contrary to the forenamed ioyfull celebrating of mariage are all those indirect courses which bring much griefe, trouble and vexation thereunto: as forced, stolne, vnequall, or any other way vnlawfull mariages: mariages without parents, or
other gouernours and friends consent: or hudled vp to auoid the danger of law for former vncleannesse committed, with the like. Many by their preposterous and vndue performing of so weightie a matter, doe not only cause great trouble and disquietnesse on the mariage day, but also much sorrow all the daies of their life. If such finde no ioy, comfort or helpe in mariage, but rather the contrary, let them not blame Gods or∣dinance, but their owne folly and peruersnesse. The second Treatise. PART. II. Of common-mutuall duties betwixt Man and Wife. §. 1. Of the heads of those common-mutuall duties. IN the first part of this Treatise concerning Man and Wife, hath beene declared, who are so to be accounted: in this se∣cond part their common-mutuall duties are to be laid forth. These are either De necessita∣te ad esse. absolutely necessary for the being and abiding of mariage: or De honestate ad benè esse. needfull and requisite for the well being and well abiding of it, that is, for the good estate of mariage, and for a commendable, and comfortable liuing together. There are two kindes of the former, 1. Matrimoniall Vnity. 2. Matrimoniall Chastity.   The latter also may be drawne to two heads: for they are either such as the maried couple are mutually to performe each to other: or such as both of them are ioyntly to performe to others. Those mutuall duties are 1. A louing affection of one to another. 2. A prouident care of one for another.   Vnder that prouident care I comprise both the Meanes whereby it may be the better effected (which is Cohabitation) and the Matter wherein it consisteth:
And this respecteth, 1. The Soule, 3. The Good-name of each other. 2. The Body, 4. The Goods     The ioynt duties which are to be performed to others, respect 1. Those who are in the house. 2. Those who are out of the house.   They who are in the house are 1. Members of the familie. 2. Guests which come to the familie.   Many more particulars are comprised vnder these generall heads, which I purpose distinctly to deliuer, as I come to them in their seuerall proper places. §. 2. Of Matrimoniall vnitie. The first, highest, chiefest, and most absolutely necessarie common-mutuall dutie betwixt Man and Wife, is Matrimoni∣all Vnitie, whereby husband and wife doe account one another to be one flesh, and accordingly preserue the inuiolable vnion whereby they are knit together. This is that dutie which the Apostle inioyneth to husbands and wiues, in these words, Let 1 Cor. 7. 10, 11. not the wife depart from her husband: Let not the husband put away his wife. He there speaketh of renouncing each other, and making the matrimoniall bond frustrate, and of no effect: which bond he would haue to be kept firme and inuiolable, and they two who are thereby made one, constantly to remaine one, and not to make themselues two againe. This matrimoniall vnitie is so necessarie, as it may not be dis-united or dissolued though one be a Christian, the other a Pagan. If any brother 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13. (saith the Apostle) hath a wife that beleeueth not, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an husband that beleeueth not, let her not leaue him. The reasons of this inuiolable vnion are especially two: One taken from the Author of mariage: the other from the Nature thereof. 1. The Author of mariage is God. It is his ordinance: and Gen. 2. 18, 22, 24 he it is that by his ordinance hath made of two, one flesh. Now marke the consequence which Christ as a ruled case, and vn∣deniable principle inferreth thereon, What God hath ioyned to∣gether Mat 19. 6. let no man put asunder: If no man, then nor wife, nor hus∣band himselfe. 2. Such is the Nature of the matrimoniall bond as it ma∣keth
of two one, and See Treat. 1 §. 79, 80. more firmely bindeth them two toge∣ther, then any other bond can binde any other two together, how then should they be two againe? §. 3. Of Desertion. The vice contrary to matrimoniall vnitie is Desertion, when one of the maried couple through indignation of the true re∣ligion, and vtter detestation thereof, or some other like cause, shall apparently renounce all matrimoniall vnitie, and with∣draw him or her selfe from all societie with the other, and liue among Infidels, Idolaters, heretiques, or other such persecu∣tors, as a faithfull Christian with safetie of life, or a good con∣science, cannot abide among; and though all good meanes that can be thought of be vsed to reclaime the partie so depar∣ted, yet nothing will preuaile, but obstinatly persisteth in re∣nouncing all matrimoniall fellowship. This Desertion is in the case of mariage so capitall, as it Infidelis disce∣dens in matri∣monium peccare dignoscitur: ita{que} non est ei fides seruanda con∣iugij. Ambr. in 1 Cor. 7. freeth the innocent partie from any further seeking after the other. In which respect the Apostle saith, If the vnbeleeuing depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not vnder bondage in such cases, 1 Cor. 7. 15. By bondage he meaneth matri∣moniall subiection (by reason whereof neither of the maried persons haue power of their owne body, but one of the o∣thers.) Now they that are not vnder this bondage, are not bound to seeke after it. That Desertion therefore on the delin∣quents . Phot. in 1 Cor. 7. Luth. de matrim. Calu. epist. 227. Beza in lib. de Diuort. part is such dissolution of mariage, as freeth the inno∣cent partie from the bondage thereof. In many reformed Churches beyond the seas Desertion is accounted so farre to dissolue the very bond of mariage, as libertie is giuen to the partie forsaken to marie another: and it is also applied to o∣ther cases then that which is aboue mentioned: as when an P. Martyr in 1 Cor. 7. 13. Melanct. in loc. de Coniug. Infidell, Idolater, or Heretique shall depart from one of the true religion for other causes then hatred of religion: or when both man and wife hauing liued as Idolaters among Idolaters, Zanchius de Oper. Dei lib. 4. cap. 1. one of them being conuerted to the true faith, leaueth his a∣bode among Idolaters, and goeth to the professors of the true faith, but can by no meanes get the other partie to remoue: or when one of the true religion shall depart from another of the same profession, and will by no meanes be brought to liue
with the partie so left, but openly manifesteth peremptorie obstinacie; the matter being heard and adiudged by the Ma∣gistrate, the mariage bond may be broken, and libertie giuen to the partie forsaken to mary another. But because our Church hath no such custome, nor our law determined such cases, I leaue them to the custome of other Churches. §. 4. Of matrimoniall Chastitie. The second necessarie common-mutuall mariage-dutie is Matrimoniall chastitie. Chastitie in a large extent is taken for all manner of puritie in soule or body: in which respect the Apostle calleth the Church of God a chaste virgin. But in the 1 Cor. 11. 2. sense wherein we here vse it, it especially appertaineth to the body: which is that vertue whereby we possesse our vessels (to 1 Thess. 4. 4. vse the Apostles phrase) in holinesse and honour: or more plain∣ly to our purpose, whereby we keepe our bodies vndefiled. Chastitie thus restrai∣ned to the body is of Single life. Wedlocke.   That of single life is opposed to fornication: and it is ei∣ther of such as neuer were maried. Such an one was S. Paul, in which respect he wisheth that all were as he, 1 Cor. 7. 7. Or of such as are lawfully freed from the bond of mariage. Such an one the Apostle calleth . 1 Tim. 5. 5. Paphnutius congressum cum legitima vxore castitatem esse dicebat. Socr. hist. Eccl. l. 1. cap. 11. a widow indeed. Chastitie of wed∣locke is that vertue whereby parties maried, obseruing the lawfull and honest vse of mariage, keepe their bodies from be∣ing defiled with strange flesh: thus the Apostle commandeth wiues to be chaste, Tit. 2. 5. So as Qui leges coniugij seruat homini conti∣nenti par sit. Greg. Naz. Cygn. Carm. they that keepe the lawes of wedlocke are as chaste as they that containe. Here by the way note the dotage of our aduersaries, who thinke there is no chastitie, but of single persons: whereupon in their speeches and writings Clerici casti∣tatem professi matrimonium contrahere non possunt. Concil. Trid. § 24. Can 9. they oppose chastitie and matrimonie one to another, as two contraries. Some of their holy Fathers and Popes, and those not the least learned, nor of worst note among them, haue inferred by their arguments against Priests mariage, that Mariage is a li∣uing in the flesh, a sowing to the flesh, a pollution of the flesh. To that Siricius & In∣nocentius 3. Gratian. Decr. distinct. 31. 82. 1 Cor. 7. 5. purpose S. Pauls aduice to man and wife to abstaine, that they may giue themselues to fasting and prayer, is vrged: but di∣rectly contrarie to the intent of the Apostle. For,
1. He speaketh there of extraordinarie humiliation. 2. He interposeth this limitation, for a time. 3. He saith not simply, that ye may pray, but that ye may giue your selues. (or haue . Non dixit sim∣pliciter vt ore∣tis, sed vt vace∣tis orationi: ac sirem impediat, non coinquinet. Chrys in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. lea∣sure) to prayer: as if it did only hinder, but not pollute prayer. But how can the forenamed spots and blots of mariage stand with that beautie and glorie wherewith the Apostle set∣teth it forth in these words, Mariage is honourable in all, Hb. 13. 4. If mariage were as Papists set it forth to be, the mariage∣bed were verie vnfitly called a bed vndefiled. Behold how contrarie the spirits of S. Paul and of their Popes were. I wot well farre more contrarie then chastitie and matrimonie. But to returne to our matter, cleare it is, that maried per∣sons may be chaste, and accordingly they ought to be chaste. To which purpose the Apostle counselling men and women, for auoiding fornication, to haue wiues and husbands, inser∣teth this particle OWNE (Let euerie man haue his OWNE wife, 1 Cor. 7. 2. . and euerie woman haue her OWNE husband) whereby he impli∣eth, that they should not haue to doe with any other. That which Prou. 5. 19. See more of this text in Treat. 4. §. 11. Salomon expresseth of an husband, by the rule of rela∣tion must be applied to a wife. As the man must be satisfied at all times in his wife, and euen rauisht with her loue; so must the woman be satisfied at all times in her husband, and euen rauisht with his loue. By the like rule the precept giuen to wiues, to be chaste, must husbands take as directed to them∣selues Tit. 2. 5. also, and be chaste. This dutie did Isaak and Rebekah faithfully and mutually performe each to other. 1. It was one maine end, why mariage (especially since the Reasons for mariage-cha∣stitie. fall of man) was ordained, to liue chastely. This the Apostle implieth, where he saith, to auoid fornication, let euerie man haue his owne wife, and let euerie woman haue her owne hus∣band. 1. Chastitie one end of mariage. 1 Cor. 7. 2. Ibid. vers. 9. And againe, If they cannot containe let them marrie. 2. By chastitie is a godly seed preserued on earth. By this reason doth the Prophet Malachie inforce this dutie. For after he had said, that the Lord made one, meaning of two one flesh 2. By chastitie a godly seed preserued. Mal. 2. 16. by mariage, he inferreth this exhortation, Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deale vnfaithfully against the wife of his youth.
3. An especiall part of the honour of mariage consisteth in 3. Chastitie the honour of mariage. Heb. 13. 4. chastitie: whereupon the Apostle hauing giuen this high com∣mendation of mariage, that it is honourable in all, addeth this clause (and the bed vndefiled) to shew the reason of that honour. As if he had said, Because the mariage-bed is in it selfe a bed vndefiled, mariage is therefore in it selfe honourable, and doth so farre remaine honourable, as the bed remaineth vndefiled. §. 5. Of Adulterie. The vice contrarie to matrimoniall chastitie is Adulterie, one of the most capitall vices in that estate: a vice whereby way is made for Diuorce: as is cleare and euident by the deter∣mination of Christ himselfe, concerning that point, first Matth. 5. 32. pro∣pounded in his sermon on the mount, and againe Matth. 19. 9. Christus ab a∣dultera vero se∣parari permit∣tit. Greg. Naz. Orat. 36. Vir post forni∣cationem non est vir, Chrys. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7. repeated in his conference with the Pharisies, where condemning vn∣iust diuorces, he excepteth the diuorce made for adulterie. And great reason there is thereof. For 1 Cor. 6. 16. the adulterer ma∣keth himselfe one flesh with his harlot. Why then should he remaine to be one flesh with his wife? Two (saith the Law) shall be one flesh: not three. The like may be said of a wife com∣mitting adulterie. §. 6. Of pardoning adulterie vpon repentance. Quest. Seeing by adulterie iust cause of diuorce is giuen, may this fault vpon the repentance of the delinquent person be so forgiuen, as no diuorce be sought by the innocent person, but both continue to liue together in wedlocke as before? Answ. Though it be not meet in this case, to impose it as an inuiolable law vpon the innocent partie, to retaine the de∣linquent, because of repentance (for we haue direct and strict warrant for it) yet I doubt not but they may so doe, if they will, and that without iust exception to the contrarie, they ought so to doe. For the law of diuorce did not necessarily enioyne any to sue out the bill, but only afforded them libertie to vse that punishment if they saw cause. I doubt not but for warrant of this libertie, we may take Gods patterne, in retaining Churches and people after they haue committed spirituall adulterie: and Christs forgiuing the woman that had committed adulterie. For, Postquam Christus ait a∣dulterae, nec ego te damnabo: vade, deinceps noli peccare, quis non intelli∣gat, debere ma∣ritum ignoscere quod videt ig∣nouisse Domi∣num ambor um: nec iam se debe∣re adulteram dicere cuius poe∣nitentis crimen diuina credit miseratione de∣letam? Aug. de adult. Coniug. lib. 2. cap. 6. Seeing Christ said to an adult eresse, I condemne thee not, goe and sinne no more, who cannot conceiue that an husband ought to
forgiue that which he seeth the Lord both of husband and wife hath forgiuen: and that he ought not to account her an adulteresse, whose fault he beleeueth to be blotted out, by the mercie of God, vpon her repentance? §. 7. Of the difference of adultery in a man, and in a wife. Quest. Is the bond of mariage as much violated on the Adultery as great a sinne in a man as in his wife. Lex Jul. de Adult. l. 1. Orif. Codic. in l. Illust. Greg. Sayr. Clau. reg. l. 9. c. 16. mans part when he committeth adulterie as on the womans when she doth so? Answ. Though the ancient Romans and Canonists haue aggrauated the womans fault in this kinde farre aboue the mans, and giuen the man more priuiledges then the woman, yet I see not how that difference in the sinne can stand with the tenour of Gods word. I denie not but that more incon∣ueniences may follow vpon the womans default then vpon the mans: as, greater infamy before men, worse disturbance More incon∣ueniences of a womans adultery, then a mans. of the family, more mistaking of legitimate, or illegitimate children, with the like. The man cannot so well know which be his owne children, as the woman; he may take base chil∣dren to be his owne, and so cast the inheritance vpon them; and suspect his owne to be basely borne, and so depriue them of their patrimony. But the woman is freed from all such mistakings. Yet in regard of the breach of wedlocke, and trans∣gression against God, the sinne of either partie is alike. Gods word maketh no disparity betwixt them. At the beginning God said of them both, Mat. 19. 5. they two shall be one flesh: not the wo∣man only with the man, but the man also with the woman is made one flesh. 1 Cor. 7. 3, 4. Their power also ouer one another in this respect is alike. If on iust occasion they abstaine, Vers. 5. it must be with mutuall consent. If the husband leaue his wife, Vers. 15. she is as free, as he should be, if she left him. Accordingly the punish∣ment Tanto grauius viros puniri oportet, quanto magis ad eos pertinet & vir∣tute vincere, & exemplo regere soeminas. Aug. de adult. Con∣ing. l. 2. c. 8. which by Gods law was to be inflicted on Adulterers is the same, whether the man or the woman be the delinquent, (Deut. 22. 22.) If difference be made, it is meet that adulterous husbands be so much the more seuerely punished, by how much the more it appertaineth to them to excell in vertue, and to gouerne their wiues by example. §. 8. Of the hainousnesse of Adulterie. But to returne to the discouery of the hainousnesse of Adul∣terie,
I finde no sinne thorowout the whole Scripture so noto∣riously in the seuerall colours thereof set forth, as it is. For be∣sides that it is 7. Comman∣dement. by name forbidden in the Decalogue, it is fur∣ther expresly branded to be committed, 1. Against each person in the holy Trinitie: the Father (whose Prou. 2. 17. couenant is broken) the Sonne (whose 1 Cor. 6. 16. members are made the members of an harlot) and the Holy Ghost (whose 1 Cor. 6. 19. Tem∣ple is polluted.) 2. Against ones neighbour, as Gen. 34. 31. the partie with whom the sinne is committed (for this sinne cannot be committed singly by one alone) the husband and wife of each partie Prou. 6. 35. who can∣not rest contented with any satisfaction) the Gen. 21. 10. Iudg. 11. 2. Deut. 23. 2. children borne in adulterie (whom they brand with an indelible character of infamie, and depriue of many priuiledges that otherwise they might enioy) the Leuit. 21. 9. Gen. 34. 7. 2 Sam. 13. 22. alliance and friends of each partie (to whom the griefe and disgrace of this foule sinne reacheth) the whole family appertaining to either of them (for Iob 31. 12. 2 Sam. 12. 10. this is as a fire in an house) the towne, citie, and nation where such vncleane birds roost (for Gen. 34. 27. Iudg. 20. 10. Hos. 4. 3. all they lie open to the vengeance of God for this sinne) and the very Church of God (the Mal. 2. 15. holy seed whereof is by this sinne hindred) 3. Against the parties themselues that commit this sinne, and that against their Prou. 6. 32. soules, 1 Cor. 6. 18. bodies, Prou. 6. 33. name, Prou. 6. 26. goods, and all that appertaineth to them. As this sinne is in it selfe a sinfull sinne, so by the bitter and The bitter fruits of Adul∣terie. cursed fruits which proceed from it, it is made out of measure sinfull. For 1. By it husbands and wiues affection (which of all other ought to be the most inuiolable) is so alienated, as seldome it is reconciled againe. 2. By it the goods of the family are much wasted: the adul∣terous husband spending that wherewith he should prouide for his family, on his harlot: and the adulterous wife purloining what she can from her husband. 3. By it husbands and wiues are stirred vp to wish, and long after one anothers death: and not only inwardly in heart to wish it, but outwardly also in deed to practise it. 4. If from this sinne there arise not a gauling and terrify∣ing
conscience (as oft there doth) then (which is worse) a seared conscience, an hard heart, a reprobate sense, and an im∣pudent face. Wherefore God accordingly deales with such sinners. In Gods iudge∣ments against adulterie. his soule Prou. 22. 14. he hateth them: by his word he hath denounced many fearefull iudgements against them, both in Hos. 4. 2, 3. this world, and in Reu. 21. 8. the world to come (against no sinne more.) This sin is reckoned to be one of the most principall causes of the grea∣test iudgements that euer were inflicted in the world: as of the Gen. 6. 2, &c. generall deluge: of that Ezek. 16. 50. fire and brimstone which destroied Sodome and Gomorrah: of Leuit. 18. 28. Canaans spuing out her Inhabi∣tants: of that Num. 25. 9. plague which destroied in one day 24000: and of the Ier. 5. 7, 8, 9. Israelites captiuitie, with the like: By all which we see that fearefull doome verified, Heb. 13. 4. Whoremongers, and adulterers God will iudge. Now consider what Heb. 10. 31. a fearefull thing it is to fall into the hands of the liuing God. §. 9. Of remedies against Adulterie, and in particular of due beneuolence, and of defect or excesse therein. For preuenting this hainous sinne (to omit many other re∣medies which Gods word hath prescribed, as Pro. 6. 25. a diligent keep∣ing of the heart (that lustfull thoughts proceed not from thence) of the Iob 31. 1. eies (that they wander not on the beautie or propernesse of any ones person, or on lasciuious pictures, or any other like allurements) of the Pro. 7. 21. eares (that they hearken not to any inticements of others) of the Ephes. 5. 4. tongue (that it vtter no vnchaste and corrupt communication) of the Pro. 7. 13. lips (that they delight not in wanton kisses) of the Pro. 6. 29. hands (that they vse no wanton daliance) of the Pro. 7. 25. feet (that they carry thee not too neere to the place where adulterie may be committed) of thy Ephes. 5. 7. company (that thou be not defiled with others wanton∣nesse and vncleannesse) of thy Gen. 19. 33. diet (that it be not immode∣rate) of thine Ezek. 23. 6, 15, 40. apparell (that it be not garish and lasciuious) of thy Gen. 39. 9. Pro. 2. 16. time (that it be not vainly and idly spent) to omit, I say, these and other like remedies.) One of the best remedies that can be prescribed to maried persons (next to an Gen. 39. 9. Pro. 2. 16. awfull feare of God, and a continuall setting of him before them, wheresoeuer they are) is, that husband and wife mutually de∣light each in other, and maintaine a pure and feruent loue be∣twixt
themselues, yeelding that 1 Cor. 7. 2, 3, 5, 9. due beneuolence one to ano∣ther which is warranted & sanctified by Gods word, and ordai∣ned of God for this particular end. This due beneuolence (as the Apostle stileth it) is one of the most proper and essentiall acts of mariage: and necessary for the maine and principall ends thereof: as for preseruation of chastitie in such as haue not the gift of continency, for increasing the world with a legiti∣mate brood, and for linking the affections of the maried cou∣ple more firmely together. These ends of mariage, at least the two former, are made void without this duty be performed. As it is called . beneuolence because it must be performed with good will and delight, willingly, readily and cheerefully; so it is said to be . due because it is a debt which the wife oweth to her husband, and he to her. 1 Cor. 7. 4. For the wife hath not the power of her owne body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not the power of his owne body, but the wife. I haue my warrant from the Apostle to prescribe this dutie as a remedie against adulterie. For 1 Cor. 7. 2, 3. to auoid fornication, he ad∣uiseth man and wife to render due beneuolence one to another. If then this question be moued (How will mariage keep men and women from adulterie?) this answer out of the Apostles words may be giuen (by rendring due beneuolence:) which he further inculcateth by declaring the mischiefe that may follow vp∣on the neglect of this dutie, namely Vers. 5. a casting of themselues into the snares of Satan. Well might he presse this dutie to that end, because no other meanes is of like force: nor fasting, nor watching, nor hard lodging, nor long trauell, nor much la∣bour, nor cold, nor solitarinesse, nor any thing else. Dum solitu∣dinis me deserta vallarent, ardo∣rem naturae fer∣re non poteram: quem cùm cre∣bris ieiunijs frangerem, mens cogitationibus aestuabat. Hier. ad Rust. Mon. Lege eundem ad Eustoc. de custod. virgin. Some that haue by these meanes endeuoured much to beat downe their bodies, and subdue lust (but neglected the forenamed remedie) haue notwithstanding felt lust boiling in them. There are two extremes contrarie to this dutie. One in the defect: another in the excesse. Defect therein is, when in case of need it is not required, or being required by the one, it is not yeelded by the other. Mo∣destie is pretended by some for not requiring it: but in a duty so warrantable and needfull, pretence of modesty is (to speake the least) a signe of great infirmitie, and a cause of much ini∣quitie.
To denie this dutie being iustly required, is to denie a due debt, and to giue Satan great aduantage. The punishment inflicted on Onan, (Gen. 38. 9, 10.) sheweth how great a wrong this is. From that punishment Hebraei in∣quiunt perinde vt homicidam reum esse qui temerè semen profundit. Merc. in Gen. 38. 9. the Hebrews gather that this sinne is a kinde of murther. It is so much the more hainous when hatred, stoutnesse, nicenesse, feare of hauing too many children, or any other like respects, are the cause thereof. Excesse is either in the measure, or in the time. In the mea∣sure, when husband or wife is insatiable; prouoking, rather then asswaging lust, and weakning their naturall vigor more then suppressing their vnnaturall humor. Many husbands and wiues are much oppressed by their bedfellowes vnsatiablenesse in this kinde. In the time, when it is against Pietie, Mercy, or Modestie. 1. Against Pietie, when no day, nor dutie of Religion, no not extraordinarie daies, and duties of humiliation, will make them forbeare. Iol 2. 6. The Prophets bidding the bridegroome and ride goe out of their chamber in the day of a Fast, and 1 Cor. 7. 5. the Apo∣stles excepting of Praier and fasting, where he enioineth this du∣tie of due beneuolence, shew that in the time of a Fast it must e forborne. 2. Against Mercy, when one of the married couple being weake by sicknesse, paine, labour, trauell, or any other like eanes, and through that weaknesse not well able to performe his dutie, the other notwithstanding will haue it performed.  will haue mercy, and not sacrifice, saith the Lord. Shall Gods sacrifice giue place to mercy, and shall not mans or womans ? for so I may well terme this vnseasonable desire. Quest. What if an husband or wife continue so long sicke,  otherwise weake, as the other cannot containe? Answ. In such cases of necessitie the body must be beaten wne, and earnest praier made for the gift of continency: for redly the Lord who hath brought thee to that necessitie, all giue thee grace sufficient. 3. Against Modesty, Quo tempore si vir coierit cū muliere, dicun∣tur concepti foe∣tus vitium se∣minis tral ere: ita vt leprosi & elephantiaci ex hac conceptione nascantur. Hi∣er. in Lam. 1. when husbands require this duty in that me, which vnder the Law was called the time of a wiues sepa∣ration for her disease (Leu. 15. 19. &c.) For what can be expected m such polluted copulation, but a leprous and loathsome
generation? This kinde of intemperancie is expresly forbid∣den (Leuit. 18. 19.) and a capitall punishment inflicted on such as offended therein (Leuit. 20. 18.) Abstinence in this time is set in the catalogue of those notes which declare a man to be righteous (Eccles. 20. 7.) and the contrary intemperancy is put in the roll of such abominations as prouoked God to spue out the Canaanits (Leuit. 18. 28.) and to forsake his owne inheri∣tance (Ezek. 22. 10.) To this kinde of intemperancie Aug. de bon. coniug. ca. 6. Amb. in 1 Cor. 7. some referre a mans know∣ing of his wife after she hath conceiued with childe. But I finde no such matter condemned in Gods word: neither dare I make that a sinne which is not there condemned. Nemo Esse∣norum cū praeg∣nante concum∣bit. Ioseph. de bel. Iud. li. 2. c. 7. Certaine Sectaries among the Iewes are branded for this error. 1. Obiect. No other creature will so doe: so as it may seeme to be against nature. Answ. 1. I denie the argument: though some forbeare, yet all doe not. 2. I denie the consequence: for other creatures are not so tied one male to one female, as an husband to his owne wife. Quod in be∣stijs ipso naturae iure praescriptū est, vt praegnan∣tes ad partum vs{que} non coeant, hoc in homini∣bus sciant ar∣bitrio relictum. Hier. in Eph. 5. Sanchez de Matr. lib. 9. disp. 21, 22. agit de petendo & red∣dendo debito quando men∣struum est: & tempore praeg∣nationis, & dū infans lactatur. Besides, that which beasts by nature are tied vnto, must be left to mans discretion. 2. Obiect. After a woman hath once conceiued, no more conceptions can be expected, till she be deliuered. Answ. Conception is not the only end of this dutie: for it is to be rendred to such as are barren. Quest. What if the wife giue sucke to her childe, ought not her husband then to forbeare? Answ. Because giuing sucke is a mother dutie, man ought to doe what he can to containe. §. 10. Of mutuall loue betwixt man and wife. Hitherto of those common mutuall duties which tend to the preseruation of the very being of mariage, and are in that respect absolutely necessarie. The other common mu∣tuall duties (though they be not of so absolute necessitie as the former) are in their kinde necessary for the good estate of ma∣riage, and for the better preseruing of that knot: so as, if they be not performed, the end and right vse of mariage will be per∣uerted, & that estate made vncomfortable, & very burdensome.
The first of these is Loue. A louing mutuall affection must passe betwixt husband and wife, or else no dutie will be well perfor∣med: this is the ground of all the rest. In some respects Loue is proper and peculiar to an husband, as Treat. 4. §. 2. I purpose to shew when I come to speake of an husbands particular duties. But Loue is also required of wiues, and they are commanded to be louers of their husbands, as well as husbands to loue their wiues: . Tit. 2. 4. Col. 3. 19. so as it is a common mutuall dutie belonging to husband and wife too: and that is true wedlocke, when man and wife are linked together by the bond of loue. Vnder loue all other du∣ties Hoc verum est coniugium, quando vinculo charitatis sunt concatenati. Chrys. hom. 45. in Gen. are comprised: for without it no dutie can be well perfor∣med. Rom. 13. 10. Loue is the fulfilling of the Law, that is, the very life of all those duties which the law requireth. It is the Col. 3. 14. bond of per∣fection, which bindeth together all those duties that passe be∣twixt partie and partie. Where loue aboundeth, there all du∣ties will readily and cheerefully be performed. Where loue is wanting, there euery duty will either be altogether neglected, or so carelesly performed, that as good not be performed at all: in which respect the Apostle willeth, that all things be done 1 Cor. 16. 14. in loue. Loue as it prouoketh the partie in whom it ruleth to doe all the good it can; so it stirreth vp the partie loued to re∣pay good for good. It is like fire, which is not only hot in it selfe, but also conueigheth heat into that which is neere it: whence ariseth a reflection of heat from one to another. Note how admirably this is set forth betwixt Christ and his Spouse in the Song of Salomon: and it is further manifested in the exam∣ples of all good husbands and wiues noted in the Scripture: they did mutually beare a very louing affection one to an∣other. Though loue be a general duty which euery one oweth to an∣other, Matth. 5. 44. euen to his enemie, yet the neerer that God hath linked any together, the more are they bound to this dutie, and the more must they abound therein. But of all others are Treat. 1. §. 79, 80. man and wife most neerely and firmly linked together. Of all others therefore are they most bound hereunto, & that in the highest degree that may be, euen like to Ionathans loue, who loued Da∣uid 1 Sam. 18. 1. Prou. 18. 22. as his owne soule. Salomon saith, He that findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth fauour of the Lord: which by the
rule of relation is also true of an husband, Shee that findeth an husband findeth a good thing, and obtaineth fauour of the Lord. Man and wife therefore are each to other an especiall pledge of Gods fauour, and in this respect aboue all others vnder God to be loued. If this be the ground (as it ought to be) of their mutu∣all That which in Treat. 4. §. 2. 9. 11. is spoken of an husbands loue and intire affection, may also be ap∣plied in some respects to a wife: and so serue to amplifie this common mutuall dutie of loue. loue, their loue will be feruent and constant. Neither will the want, or withering of any out∣ward allurements, as beautie, perso∣nage, parentage, friends, riches, ho∣nours, or the like, with-hold or with-draw, extinguish or extenu∣ate their loue: neither will any ex∣cellencies of nature or grace in other husbands and wiues draw their hearts from their owne to those other: nor yet will the loue of a former yoake-fellow dead and gone, any whit lessen the loue of the liuing mate. This instance I haue the rather mentioned, because in many, Loue of after venters to be as intire as of former. who are farre from setting their affection on strange flesh, their loue of a former husband or wife departed is so fast fixed in their heart, as they can neuer againe so intirely loue any other. They who are so minded are not fit to be ioined with another yoke-fellow after they are loosed from one. If they mary againe, and manifest such a minde, they plainly shew that they respect this or that person more then Gods ordinance. By Gods or∣dinance man and wife are no longer bound one to another then they liue together. Death is an absolute diremption, and maketh an vtter dissolution of the mariage bond. If the man Rom. 7. 2, 3. be dead, the wife is deliuered from the law of the man, so as shee may take another man. Which liberty is also giuen to the man. Being now free, if they mary another (that other being now a true husband or wife) their loue must be as intire to that other as it was to the former: yea, and more intire, if there were any defect in the former. For as children maried out of their parents house must not retaine such a loue of their pa∣rents as shall swallow vp their loue of the partie to whom they are maried, but must according to the law, leaue father and
mother, and cleaue to their yoke-fellow: so neither must the loue of a former husband or wife be predominant when they are maried to another. This other must be as close clea∣ued vnto, as if they had neuer beene ioined to a former. The liuing husband or wife is the present pledge of Gods fauour. He is now thine owne husband: and she is now thine owne wife: and not the partie that is dead. I denie not but the memorie of a vertuous husband or wife ought to be pretious to the suruiuing partie: for the memoriall of the iust is blessed. Prou. 10. 7. But as the vertue of a person deceased may not be buried with the dead corps: so neither may the person be kept aboue ground with the memorie of his or her vertue: which after a sort is done, when loue of the partie deceased either ta∣keth away, or extenuateth the loue of the liuing. This is to giue dominion to the dead ouer the liuing: which is more then the law enioyneth. §. 11. Of husbands and wiues mutuall hatred contrary to loue. There is a generation of so crabbed and crooked a disposi∣tion * See Treat. 3. § 8. & Treat. 4. §. 10. as they cannot loue, but rather hate one another because they are man and wife: for many husbands hauing wiues, and wiues husbands euery way worthy to be loued, will not∣withstanding say to the astonishment of the hearers, I haue indeed a good husband, or I haue a good wife: but I cannot loue him, or I cannot loue her: and being deman∣ded a reason, sticke not openly and impudently to reply, I thinke I could loue him if he were not mine husband, or I thinke I could loue her if she were not my wife. O more then monstrous impudencie! Is not this directly to oppose against Gods ordinance, and against that order which he hath set betwixt man and woman? Is it not to trample vnder foot Gods fauour? Though there were nothing else to moue loue but this, that such an one is thine hus∣band, or such an one is thy wife, yet this should be motiue enough. And shall this be the ground of thine hatred? Assuredly such a spirit is a plaine diabolicall spirit, contra∣ry to that spirit which is from aboue; and if it be not
cast out, it will cast those whom it possesseth into the fire of hell. §. 12. Of mutuall peace betwixt Man and Wife. Among other meanes of maintaining an inward louing af∣fection betwixt man and wife, outward mutuall peace, concord, and agreement is one of the principall. Whereupon the A∣postle exhorteth to keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of Ephes. 4. 3. peace: for peace is a bond that tieth one to another, and maketh them to be as one, euen one in spirit: as on the contrary side outward discord disunites mens spirits. We are enioined to follow peace with all men: how much more of all persons ought Heb. 12. 14. husbands to haue peace with their wiues, and wiues with their husbands? they are neerer then brothers and sisters. Behold then how good and pleasant a thing it is for them to dwell together in vnity. §. 14. Prou. 21. 9. Dwell together they must: but without peace there is no dwelling together: It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top then with a contentious woman in a wide house. Persons at variance were farre better be out of sight and place, then present together. Out of sight and place man and wife must not be, at peace therefore Portus est mu∣lier, & maximū securitatis re∣medium. Si ventis & flucti∣bus portum li∣beraueris ex foro reuersus tran∣quillè viues. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. they must be. Mutuall peace betwixt them is a great re∣freshing to their mindes, being beaten with the discords of others. It is said that a wife is in this respect as an hauen to man (how much more man to his wife?) If the hauen be calme, and free from stormes and tempests, what a refreshing will it be to the Mariner that hath beene tossed in the sea with windes and waues? For maintaining peace, 1. All offences so much as possibly may be must be auoi∣ded. Directions for maintaining peace betwixt Man and Wife. The husband must be watchfull ouer himselfe that he giue no offence to his wife: and so the wife on the other side. Offences cause contentions. 2. When an offence is giuen by the one partie, it must 1. Auoid of∣fence. not be taken by the other; but rather passed by: and then will not peace be broken. The second blow makes 2. Take not offence. the fray. 3. Offer re∣conciliation. 3. If both be incensed together, the fire is like to be the
greater: with the greater speed therefore must they both la∣bour to put it out. Wrath must not lie in bed with two such Eph. 4. 26. bed-fellowes: neither may they part beds for wrath sake. That this fire may be the sooner quenched, they must both striue first to offer reconciliation. Theirs is the glory who doe first begin, for they are most properly the blessed peacemakers. Not Mat. 5. 9. to accept peace when it is offered is more then heathenish: but when wrath is incensed, to seeke atonement is the dutie of a Christian, and a grace that commeth from aboue. 4. Children, seruants, nor any other in the family must be 4. Take no part with others. bolstred vp by the one against the other. The mans partaking with any of the house against his wife, or the wiues against her husband, is an vsuall cause of contention betwixt man and wife. 5. They must forbeare to twit one another in the teeth 5. Make not comparisons. with the husbands or wiues of other persons: or with their owne former husbands or wiues (in case they haue had any before.) Comparisons in this kinde are very odious. They stir vp much passion, and cause great contentions. 6. Aboue all they must take heed of rash and vniust iealou∣sie, 6. Be not iealous. which is the bane of mariage, and greatest cause of discon∣tent that can be giuen betwixt man and wife. Iealous persons are ready to picke quarrels, and to seeke occasions of discord: they will take euery word, looke, action, and motion, in the worse part, and so take offence where none is giuen. When iealousie is once kindled, it is as a flaming fire that can hardly be put out. It maketh the partie whom it possesseth im∣placable. Pro. 6. 34, 35. 7. In all things that may stand with a good conscience they must endeuour to please one another: and either of 7. Please one another. them suffer their owne will to be crossed, rather then discon∣tent to be giuen to the other. Saint Paul noteth this as a com∣mon 1 Cor. 7. 33, 34. mutuall dutie belonging to them both, and expresseth their care thereof vnder a word that signifieth more then or∣dinarie . care, and implieth a diuiding of the minde into diuers thoughts, casting this way, and that way, and euery way how to giue best content.
§. 13. Of contentions betwixt man and wife. Contrary to mutuall peace are contentions betwixt man and wife: which are too frequent in most families, and by which Cùm vir & vxor domi dissentiunt, nihilo melius naui iactata domus illa disponitur, cùm guberna∣tor aduersus prorae directo. rem dissentiat. Chrys. loc. citat. Gen. 13. 8. the common good is much hindered. Discord betwixt man and wife in an house is as contention betwixt the master and pilot in a ship: may not great danger, and much mischiefe be thence iustly feared? We heard before that man to his wife, and she to him, is as an hauen. Now by experience we finde that if the hauen be tempestuous it is much more trou∣blesome, and dangerous to the Mariner then the wide sea. Wherefore let man and wife be of the same minde one to ano∣ther as Abraham was to Lot, and when occasions of discord are offered, say, Let there be no strife betwixt thee and me, for we are man and wife: no more two, but one flesh. §. 14. Of husbands and wiues dwelling together. From a mutuall affection of loue proceedeth a mutuall pro∣uident care in husband and wife one for another. In handling whereof we will first note the meanes whereby their mutuall prouidence may be the better effected and manifested, and then the matter whereabout it must be conuersant. The meanes in one word is cohabitation. For a dutie it is that man and wife dwell together. The phrase vsed in setting out the womans creation (he built a woman, whereby the erecting of  Vide Musc. in Gen. 2. 22. See Treat. 1. §. 79. a family is intimated) implieth as much: so doth the law of mariage whereby man is enioyned to leaue father and mother, and to cleaue vnto his wife, that is, to goe out of his fathers house, and to dwell with his wife: and so doth this phrase (forget Psal. 45. 10. thy fathers house) taken from the dutie of a wife, and mystically applied to the Church. Saint Peter expresly chargeth hus∣bands 1 Pet. 3 7. to dwell with their wiues: and Saint Paul layeth it to 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13. the charge both of husbands and wiues not to leaue one ano∣ther, but to dwell together, yea though the one be an infidell. Surely it was conscience of this dutie which made the Iudg. 19. 3. Leuite to goe after his wife, that went away from him, to bring her home againe: and which made Gen. 31. 14. Iaakobs wiues to leaue their fathers house, and goe with their husband.  con∣iux.  vxor. The word vnder which Saint Peter compriseth this dutie is a title appropria∣ted to an husband: and an answerable title is appropriated to
a wife: from which the notation of our two vsuall English words (husband, housewife) doth not much differ. The power which the one hath of the others body, and Reasons for cohabitation. the aduantage which by liuing asunder, they giue vnto Satan, (both of which are expresly noted, 1 Cor. 7. 4, 5.) doe shew the necessity of this dutie: and the many benefits arising from thence doe further presse the equity of it. By husbands and Benefits of cohabitation. wiues dwelling together all mariage duties are better per∣formed: mutuall loue is better bred, preserued, and increased: the good gifts of either of them are better obserued by the other: better helpe and succour is mutually by each afforded to the other: and in fine they are made more capable of do∣ing good one to another, and of receiuing good one from another. Why then should they haue any minde of liuing asunder, vnlesse they be forced by extraordinary occasions, as captiuity, close imprisonment, contagious sicknesse, and such like, which are no faults of theirs, but crosses to be borne with griefe; and instant praier, together with all other good meanes, to be vsed to bring them together againe? Yea if the imprisonment, banishment, or other like kinde of ab∣sence, D. Fulke against Rhem. on 1 Cor. 7. §. 6. be such as one may if they will come at the other, the partie that is free ought to come to the other, if at least that other require it. §. 15. Of the respects for which man and wife may for a time liue asunder. Quest. May there be any iust causes for man and wife wil∣lingly to liue asunder? Answ. There can nor ought to be any cause of vtter re∣linquishing one another, which is a kinde of §. 3. desertion: but for liuing asunder for a time there may be iust causes, as 1. Weighty and vrgent affaires which concerne the good of the Church, or commonwealth: as when a man is sent forth to warre, or on an ambassage (in which case though he may take his wife with him, yet is he not necessarily bound there to, especially if the place whither he is sent be farre off, the passage thereto difficult and dangerous, and his abode there not long.) When Numb. 32. 26, 27. Reuben, Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manassch passed ouer Iorden to helpe their brethren in their battels
against the Canaanites, they left their wiues behinde them in their families: 2 Sam. 11. 3, 6. when Vriah went to warre, he left his wife at home: and Exo. 18. 2. when Moses was to bring Israel out of Egypt, his wife remained at her fathers house. 2. Maine duties of their particular calling: as of Mariners, who are oft to be on the sea: Merchants who trade in other countries: Lawyers who attend publike places of iustice: Cour∣tiers, who in their months, or quarters, attend their Prince: Keepers of women in child-bed, and sicke persons: and other nurses. Prouided alwaies that in these, and other like cases, there be Absence, 1. not without con∣sent. 1 Cor. 7. 5. a ioynt and mutuall consent of both parties: for if man and wife may not defraud one another for a time to giue them∣selues to fasting and praier without consent: much lesse may they for lighter occasions liue any time asunder without 2. Not with delight. Si vir ad pere∣grina contende∣rit, nulla longin. quitas, nulla absentia com∣placitam mi∣nuat charita∣tem. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7. consent. Prouided also that they take no delight to liue asunder, but rather be grieued that they are forced so to doe: and in testimony thereof to take all occasions that they can to manifest their longing desire one after another by letters, messages, tokens, and other like kindnesses: and to returne with all the speed they can. No distance, or absence ought any whit to diminish their mutuall loue. §. 16. Of the errour of Papists about man and wifes sepa∣ration. Si quis dixerit Ecclesiam erro∣re cùm ob mul∣tas causas sepa∣rationem inter coniuges quoad thorum, sen co∣habitationem, ad certum, in∣certumue tem∣pus fieri posse decernit, Ana∣thema sit. Concil. Trid. §. 24. can. 8. Contrarie to the dutie of cohabitation is the doctrine of Pa∣pists, whereby they teach, that Separation may be made betwixt man and wife for many causes from bed, or cohabitation, for a certaine or vncertaine time. The Councell of Trent is bold to denounce Anathema against such as say, the Church erreth therein. If the many causes which they alledge, besides adulterie, be well weighed, we shall finde them without all warrant of Gods word. Bellarm. de Matrim. l. 1. c. 14. They draw them to two heads, 1. Mutuall consent. 2. Demerit. By consent (say they) of both parties maried to attaine a greater and perfecter estate, mariage consummate may be loosed from bed and cohabitation. Answ. 1. In mariage there is a couenant of God (Prou. 2. 17.)
as well as of the two parties: the consent therefore of parties is not sufficient to breake it. 2. No estate in this world can be greater or perfecter then is meet for maried persons. Adam and Eue in their best estate were maried: and now is mariage honourable in all. Heb. 13. 4. 3. The estates which they count more perfect, are either such as are not in mans power (as perpetuall continencie) or such as may be as well performed by maried persons as by single persons (as Ecclesiasticall functions) if at least they be such as are warranted by Gods word. High Priests, and other Priests, all sorts of Leuites, extraordinarie Prophets and Apostles were maried. What greater functions then these? The causes which for demerit, they say, make a separation, re 1. Adulterie. 2. Departing from the Catholike faith. 3. Soli∣iting or impelling vnto sinne. Concerning See §. 5. Adulterie, we denie not, but that it giueth ust cause of diuorce: but withall we say (as Matth. 5. 32. we haue good warrant from Christs words) that it is the only cause of iust di∣orce. For to make a separation for departing from the Catho∣like faith, Fidei gratia vxorem ne eijci∣as. Chrys. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7. is directly contrarie to S. Pauls and S. Peters do∣ctrine, 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13, 14. 1 Pet. 3. 1. As for soliciting and impelling vnto sinne, though it may be cause to moue an husband or a wife to walke more warily and Si ferus mori∣bus fit coniux, perferat illum vxor, nec vllam ob causam socie∣tatem, vincu∣lum{que} dissoluere patiatur. Basil. Hexaem. bom. 7. Matth. 5. 29. wisely, and in extremitie to auoid societie for a time, or to com∣laine to the Magistrate for releefe, who may see it meet to lay he delinquent person in prison, or else otherwise keepe them sunder till that delinquent be reclaimed and brought to a bet∣ter minde: yet is it no sufficient cause finally to dissolue ma∣age in regard of bed and cohabitation. They vrge that if the right eye cause to offend, it must be pluc∣d out. Ans. 1. That is but a metaphor, and may sundry other wayes  applied. 2. The words are not simply, but by way of comparison to e taken, rather plucke it out, then to be made to stumble thereby. 3. Plucking out, applied to the point in hand, may be by any other wayes, then by dissoluing mariage. 4. That generall inhibition (whosoeuer shall put away his wife, Matth. 5. 32.
causeth her to commit adulterie) restrained only with the excep∣tion of fornication, admitteth neither this, nor any other such cause of dissoluing mariage. §. 17. Of husbands and wiues vnlawfull absenting themselues one from another. Contrarie also to the forenamed dutie of cohabitation, is the practise of many men, who liuing themselues in one place (suppose at London) send their wiues vnto some countrey house, and there euen mew them vp, as Hawkes, neuer caring to come at them, but are then most merrie, when their wiues are farthest off. If their wiues liue at home they will be abroad, mealing and lodging where their wiues shall not know: their owne house is as a prison to them: they are not well, but when they are out of it. Of the like lewd conceit and practife are many wiues, who on no other occasion then meere lightnesse, being eager in pursuing their pleasures, and satisfying their lusts, gad out of their owne houses in the day, lie out of them in the night, and remaine in other company dayes and nights: or at least are glad when their husbands haue occasion to be from home; not vnlike to the light huswife which Salomon de∣scribeth, Prou. 7. 10. &c. I speake of matters too famous, or rather infamous. I would there were no iust cause to taxe this lightnesse. But let such as desire to approue themselues to God or man, take heed of these hainous and more then hea∣thenish vices. Though Israel play the harlot, yet let not Iudah Hos. 4. 15. offend. Too neere to the forenamed kinde of vnlawfull separation Man and wifes fault in par∣ting roomes and beds in the same house. doe they come, who though they liue both in one house, yet make that house by their estranging themselues one from ano∣ther as two houses: the man abiding in one end thereof, his wife in another: and so haue their seuerall roomes, seuerall ta∣bles, seuerall seruants, all seuerall: Or if the straitnesse of their house will not suffer them so to part other roomes, yet they will haue seuerall bed-chambers, or at least seuerall beds: so as they that shall call them bed-fellowes, shall but nicke-name them. Thus they rob each other of that due beneuolence which they mutually owe one to another, they expose them∣selues to the deuils snares, they more and more estrange their
hearts one from another, and depriue themselues of such mu∣tuall comforts and helpes, as by matrimoniall societie they might afford to, and receiue from one another. §. 18. Of husbands and wiues mutuall prayers. The matter whereabout husbands and wiues mutuall pro∣uidence ought to be conuersant, is in generall the good of one another; that each of them doe that for the other, which Sa∣lomon in particular applieth to a wife, viz. good and not euill all Prou. 31. 12. the dayes of their life. Now the good of man extendeth to his soule, bodie, good name, and goods. A generall dutie tending to the good of all these is prayer. Prayer a mu∣tuall dutie. 1 Pet 3. 7. S. Peter requireth such a cariage of man and wife one towards another, as their prayers be not hindred: whereby he taketh it for grant, that prayer is a mutuall dutie which one oweth to the other: which dutie Isaak performed for his wife. Herein may Gen. 25. 21. man and wife be helpfull each to other in all things needfull to either of them: for it is the meanes which God in wisdome Matth. 7. 7. I am. 5. 16. hath sanctified for the obtaining of euerie needfull blessing for ourselues or others. By many it is counted but a slight dutie and of small vse; but the truth is, that to performe it aright, in truth and faith, is both difficult in the deed, and powerfull in the effect. It is the best dutie that one can performe for ano∣ther, and the least to be neglected. We heard before, that Isaak prayed for his wife: and to shew the good he did to her there∣by, it is noted, that the Lord was intreated of him: so as she, be∣ing Gen. 25. 21. barren before, by that meanes conceiued. All the physicke in the world could not haue done her so much good. . Luke 18. 1. Alwayes therefore, . 1 Thess. 5. 17. without ceasing is this dutie to be performed. Whensoeuer man and wife make any prayer, therein they must be mindfull of one another: yea and oft must they of purpose take occasion to make prayers in speciall one for another: and that both in absence, and also in presence of one another. This latter doth especially concerne the husband, who is as a Priest vnto his wife, and ought to be her mouth to God when they two are together: yet I doubt not, but that the wife may pray in the husbands presence when they two are alone, ither for triall (that he may haue knowledge of her abilitie and gift in that kinde) or for helpe (if the wife be much better
able to performe that duty then the man is, as many wiues are.) Not without cause therefore haue I reckoned this among common mutuall duties. §. 19. Of the things for which husbands and wiues are to pray alone. There are sundry needfull blessings which husbands and wiues are to pray for that appertaine only to themselues, and are most meet to be mentioned in priuate praier betwixt them∣selues, as 1. That as they two are one flesh, so they may be also one spirit: that their hearts may be as one, knit together by a true, spirituall, matrimoniall loue: alwayes delighting one in ano∣ther, euer helpfull one to another, and readie with all wil∣lingnesse and cheerefulnesse to performe all those duties which they owe one to another. 2. That their mariage bed may be sanctified: and as it is by Gods ordinance, so it may remaine to them by their well vsing it, a bed vndefiled. There is no other thing, for which mutuall prayer in priuate betwixt man and wife is more need∣full: and that so much the rather, because of the naturall heat of lust which is in most: which if it be not by prayer (the best meanes for that purpose) asswaged, it may proue a defilement Intemperans in coniugio quid aliud nisi qui∣dam adulter vxoris est? Aug. ex Ambr. contr. Iulian. lib. 2. of the vndefiled bed: and man and wife become adulterers one to another. As other things, so this also is sanctified by the word and praier. The word giueth a warrant and direction for the vse of it: praier both seasoneth it, and procureth a bles∣sing vpon it. 3. That they may haue children, and those such as may be heires of saluation, and liue in this world to their owne and others good: that they may be comely and well proportio∣ned children: nor ideots in vnderstanding, nor monsters in bodily shape, nor yet lewd and infamous in their liues: which could not but be a griefe to their parents, and might also open the mouthes of the wicked against them. 4. That God would giue them competencie of this worlds goods, and other good meanes well to nourish, nurture, and place forth their children: and a sufficiencie for the mainte∣nance
of their family, and of that estate wherein God set∣teth them. 5. That such needfull gifts and graces as are wanting in either of them may be wrought: and such vices and infirmities as they are subiect vnto may be redressed. These and many other like things giue occasion to man and wife in speciall manner to pray one for another, and one with another. §. 20. Of husbands and wiues hatefull imprecations and wishes one against another. Contrary to that holy and heauenly dutie of praier are those direfull and hellish imprecations and execrations, which ordi∣narily doe passe out of the mouthes of many husbands and wiues against one another (and that many times for very light occasions) cursing the day that euer they knew one another, and wishing that one of them had beene vnder the ground be∣fore they came together. Most odious are these and such like execrations in any mans mouth, but more then most odious in the mouth of man and wife against one another. Many who for outward shame for beare to belch forth such rotten stinking speech, make small conscience of wishing the like in their hearts. If an husband be any whit harsh, and a wife shrewish: or if through sicknesse, or any other like occa∣sion they seeme burdensome each to other: or if any dislike of one arise in the heart of the other: or if their hearts be set vpon others: or if the suruiuor be to carry away the goods and ands, their hearts will be filled with a thousand wishes of one anothers death. Yea, many times such as haue very good hus∣bands or wiues, without any shew of reason (only through an inward corrupton of their heart, and malicious instigation of Satan, not taking notice of their owne good) are ready to wish they were in heauen: making thereby a pretence of their eternall blisse to whom they so wish, whereas indeed their on∣ly desire is to be loosed and freed from them. God oft meets with such wicked wishers (whereby he sheweth how hatefull such wishes are to him) for sometimes according to their wish he taketh away good husbands and wiues from those that are euill: and when they are gone he maketh their losse to be so
sensibly felt, as those vngodly wishers doe, (as we speake) in euery veine of their heart repent them of their rash wishes. Yea, to aggrauate their wretchednesse the more, he giueth them such crabbed and peruerse husbands and wiues in the roome and stead of those good ones (for seldome comes a better) as they are forced with many deepe sighs and groanes to wish (but all in vaine) their former wiues and husbands Quam chara sint carendo intelligunt. Cic. in Orator. aliue againe, and so to verifie the prouerbe, A good thing is not so well discerned by enioying, as by wanting it. Sometimes againe God in anger crosseth their wishes, and first taketh away the wishers of others death: or else prolongeth the life of both to Amicitiae quid haberent volup∣tatis carendo magis intellexi quàm sruendo. Idem in oration. post red. their greater vexation. §. 21. Of husbands and wiues neglect of mutuall praier. The very neglect of mutuall prayer in husbands and wiues for each other is also a sinne contrary to the forenamed dutie of praier: whereof if all that are guiltie were as well knowne to man as to God, how many vnkinde husbands and wiues carelesse of one anothers good would be noted, more then are? Rare are those husbands and wiues, that haue their seasons to pray alone together one with another, if euer they pray one for another. Though in outward complements they may seeme very kinde, and in the outward things of this world, very prouident, yet if they pray not one for another, they are neither kinde, nor prouident. Heartie, feruent, fre∣quent prayer is the greatest token of kindnesse, and best part of prouidence that can be. §. 22. Of husbands and wiues mutuall care for one anothers saluation. From the generall dutie of praier which is profitable to all things, I come to the particular branches of man and wiues Admonendi sunt coniuges vt exhortantes inuicem saluent. Greg. in Past. part. 3. Adm. 28. mutuall prouident care: and will first begin with that which is first to be sought, the good of one anothers soule: which the Apo∣stle intimateth to be a thing to be sought after, where he saith, 1 Cor. 7. 16. What knowest thou, ô wife, whether thou shalt SAVE thine husband, or what knowest thou, ô man, whether thou shalt SAVE thy wife? 1 Pet. 3. 1. S. Peter enioyneth wiues to doe their endeuour to win their husbands: and Epb. 5. 25. S. Paul setteth before hus∣bands
the patterne of Christs loue, which had especiall respect Of the parti∣cular dutie of husbands in this respect, See Treat. 4. §. 47. to the soule and the saluation thereof: so as this is a mutuall dutie appertaining to them both, which S. Peter further im∣plieth where he stileth them coheires of the grace of life. It is the greatest good that one can possibly doe for another, to be a meanes of helping forward his saluation. And there is 1 Pet. 3. 7. . nothing that can more soundly and firmely knit the heart of one to another, then to be a meanes thereof. §. 23. Of husbands and wiues care to win one the other, when one of them is not called. That the saluation of the soule may be the better effected, respect must be had to the present and particular estate of hus∣band or wife. If one be a beleeuer the other not, the beleeuer must vse all the meanes that may be, to draw on the other also to beleeue. If both be beleeuers, their mutuall care must be to edifie one another in thier most holy faith. For the first, it is the maine drift of S. Peters exhortation to 1 Pet. 3. 1. beleeuing wiues, about their conuersation, to draw on their vnbeleeuing husbands to the true faith. His phrase (that they . may be wonne or gained) as in generall it hath respect to their soules saluation, so in particular to their first conuersion. Now if this dutie appertaine to a wife, much more to an husband, who is appointed an head to his wife, and a Saniour. To this end doth S. Paul aduise beleeuing husbands and wiues that Eph. 5. 23. 1 Cor. 7. 12, 13 are maried to vnbeleeuers, to dwell with them. For what a wofull thing is it, that two which in this world A wofull thing that one flesh should be in heauen and hell. Luk. 17. 34. are so neerely linked together as to make one flesh, should in the world to come be so farre separated one from another, as heauen is from hell. This indeed shall so fall out in many: for Christ hath expresly foretold it, that of two that were in one ed together (who are more fitly set forth vnder this phrase then man and wife, who most vsually are stiled bedfellowes?) ne shall be taken (to mercy and glory) the other shall be for saken or left to endlesse and easelesse torture and torment.) But though it be foretold that thus it shall fall out with many a ouple, yet our care must be, and that with our vttermost po∣wer, Meanes of conuersion the best cause of loue. to preuent it, as in our selues, so in our bedfellow. If it please the Lord to giue such a blessing to the endeuour
of an husband or wife, as to be a meanes of the conuersion of their bedfellow, then will the partie conuerted both intirely loue the other, and also heartily blesse God (as there is iust cause) that euer they were so neerely linked together. This dutie of winning one another, is to be applied to such as are maried not only to plaine infidels, but also to Papists or other like Idolaters, to Atheists, or any other profane persons, to heretiques, separatists, schismatiques, or any that beleeue not aright. §. 24. Of husbands and wiues edifying one another. The second dutie tending to the soules saluation is, that two beleeuers being maried together, they endeuour mutually to build vp one another more and more. 1 Thess. 5. 11 One Christian oweth this dutie to another: much more man and wife. Heb. 12. 15. Take heed (saith the Apostle) that no man fall away from the grace of God. If no man, then nor wife nor husband. A spirituall edifying of one another is the best vse which Spiritual edifi∣cation a main end of matri∣moniall con∣iunction. we can make (and ought to make) of those Col. 2. 19. ioynts and bonds whereby we are knit one to another. By vertue of them Eph. 4. 16. the body (namely the mysticall body of Christ) receiueth increase to the edifying of it selfe, and Col. 2. 19. increaseth with the increase of God. Now the bond of mariage being of all other the firmest, and that whereby we are neerest knit together, by vertue of what bond should we edifie one another, if not by vertue of the ma∣riage bond? §. 25. Of husbands and wiues hindering sinne one in another. Two things are requisite vnto spirituall edification. One respecteth the hinderances of growth in grace. The other the helpes thereof. The hinderances of grace are all manner of sinnes. Sinne to grace is as water to fire: it slaketh the heat of it, and if without hoe it be powred on it, it will cleane put it out. In re∣gard hereof there ought to be a mutuall care in husbands and wiues, both to preuent sinne before it be committed, and also to make what redresse they can after it is committed. That it is a mutuall dutie for husbands and wiues so much Man and wife to preuent sin in one ano∣ther. as they can, to preuent sinne one in another is euident, by that reason which the Apostle vseth, to keepe them from defrau∣ding
one another, in these words, that Satan tempt you not. 1 Cor. 7. 5. For out of the scope and matter of those words, this generall doctrine may be gathered, Husbands and wiues ought to be care∣full to keepe one another from the temptations of Satan, that is, from sinne, whereunto all his temptations tend. Gen. 27. 6, &c. Rebekah performed the dutie of a good wife in keeping Isaak from blessing Esau: which if he had done, he had sinned against Gen. 25. 23. Gods expresse word. Though she failed in the manner of do∣ing it, yet her end was good. As that loue they owe one to another, so that care which they By preuenting sinne in each other, they keepe iudge∣ments from themselues. ought to haue of themselues requireth as much, for sinne pro∣uoketh Gods wrath, his wrath sendeth downe vengeance, that vengeance which falleth on the husband can hardly misse the wife, or that the husband, which falleth on the wife; and that by reason of their neere vnion: though it fall not on both their pates, yet it cannot but much affect, and euen afflict the partie that escapeth. The wiues of those rebells who were Num. 16. 27, 32 swallowed vp quicke in the wildernesse, perished in like man∣ner with their husbands. For they who are so neere as husbands and wiues, and doe not what they can to preuent one anothers sinnes, make themselues accessary thereto. For the better effecting of this dutie, husbands and wiues Direction for preuenting sinne. must be watchfull ouer one another, and obserue what sinnes either of them are giuen vnto, or what occasions are offered to draw either of them into sinne. If either of them be chole∣ricke or prone to be angry on a sudden, the other must ende∣uour to take away all occasions of offence: and if both should be testie and hastie to wrath, when the one seeth the other first moued, the partie whose passion is not yet stirred, ought the rather to be setled and composed to all meeknesse and pati∣ence, lest, if both together be prouoked, the whole houshold be set on fire. If either of them be giuen to drunkennesse, co∣uetousnesse, or any other sinne, the other ought by wise and gentle perswasions to keepe them (as much as they can) from those sinnes. Yea they may also get others, that are discreet and able, to disswade them: or vse what other good meanes they can to that purpose.
§. 26. Of husbands and wiues redressing sinne in one ano∣ther. When either husband or wife is fallen into any sinne, a mu∣tuall dutie it is for the other, to vse what redresse may be of that sinne: as if one of them were wounded, the other must take care for the healing of that wound. Abigail performed 1 Sam. 25. her dutie in this kinde, when, after she had heard what chur∣lish entertainment her husband gaue to Dauids seruants, she hastened to carry store of prouision to Dauid, and humbled her selfe before him, and so moued Dauid to asswage his wrath: yea she tooke a seasonable time also to tell her husband his fault, and the danger whereinto he brought himselfe thereby. More directly, and with better successe did Iaakob redresse the superstition, or rather Idolatrie of his wife Rachel, as may be gathered by comparing Gen. 31. 19, 34 Gen. 35. 2, 4.   A brother at large must not suffer sinne to lie on his bro∣ther: Leu. 19. 17. much lesse may husband or wife the one vpon the other. Thou shalt not hate thy brother (saith the law) and suffer It is a branch of hatred to suffer sin to lie on any. sinne to lie on him. To doe this then is a token and fruit of ha∣tred. If an husband should see his wife, or a wife her husband lying in the fire, or water, ready to be burnt or drowned, and not afford their best helpe to pull them out, might they not iustly be thought to hate them? But sinne is as fire and wa∣ter, which will burne and drowne men in perdition. This dutie may be performed by meeke instructions, pithy perswasions, gentle reproofes: yea, and by the helpe of some Mat. 18. 16. good Minister, or other discreet and faithfull friend. §. 27. Of husbands and wiues helping forward the growth of grace in each other. Hitherto of preuenting, and redressing hinderances of grace. Hereunto must be added an helping forward of the growth thereof: which man and wife must mutually endeuour to effect one in another. The care which Elkanah had to carry his 1 Sam. 1. 4. &c. wiues along with himselfe vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord yeere by yeere, sheweth that his desire was to vphold them in the feare of God: yea the gifts and portions, which at that time he vsed to bestow on them, implie the care that he had to
encourage them to hold on in seruing the Lord. It was with∣out question the maine end which the Shunamite aimed at in 2 King. 4. 10. prouiding lodging for the Prophet, that both she and her hus∣band might be built vp in Grace. This duty may be the better effected by these means following. How growth in grace may be helped for∣ward. 1. By taking notice of the beginning, and least measure of Grace: and approuing the same. 2. By frequent conference about such things as concerne the same: mutually propounding questions one to another thereabouts, and answering the same. 3. By their mutuall practise and example: making them∣selues each to other a patterne of pietie. 4. By performing exercises of religion, as praying, singing psalmes, reading the word, and the like together. 5. By maintaining holy and religious exercises in the fami∣lie. Nemo magi∣ster ita persua∣dere poterit quemadmodum vxor. Chrys. hom. 19. 1 Cor. 7. Though this dutie especially appertaine to the husband, yet the wife must put her husband in minde thereof, if he for∣get it; and stirre him vp, if he be backward: Thus did the good Shunamite, 2 King. 4. 9, 10. No mans perswasion in this kinde, can so much preuaile with a man as his wiues. 6. By stirring vp one another to goe to the house of God, Maritum co adducito vt sanctorum die∣rum rationem habeat. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. to heare the word, partake of the Sacrament, and consciona∣bly performe all the parts of Gods publike worship. Great need there is, that husbands and wiues should ende∣uour to helpe forward the growth of grace in each other, be∣cause we are all so prone to fall away and wax cold, euen as 1. Great need thereof. water if the fire goe out, and more fewell be not put vnder. 2. Husbands and wiues may be very helpfull one to another there∣in. And of all other, husbands and wiues may be most helpfull herein, because they can soonest espie the beginning of decay by reason of their neere, and continuall familiaritie together. §. 28. Of the sinnes of husbands and wiues contrary to a mu∣tuall care of one anothers saluation. The vices contrary to that generall mutuall dutie of hus∣bands and wiues in procuring the Saluation of one another, and to the particular branches comprised vnder it, are many: As 1. A carelesse neglect thereof: when as husbands and wiues 1. Care only for temporall things. so minde earthly things, as they thinke it enough if they be prouident one for another in the things of this life. Hereof
most that liue in this earth are guiltie: and among others, euen many of them who haue the name of very good and kinde husbands and wiues. But whatsoeuer the opinion of others be of them, the truth is, that if they faile in this point, they goe no further then the very heathen haue done, and their kindnesse may be as the apes kindnesse, which causeth death. 2. The vnworthy walking, and vnchristian cariage of a belee∣uer 2. Vnworthy walking. that is maried to one that beleeueth not: hereby the vnbe∣leeuer is kept off from embracing the Gospell, and made the more to dislike and detest it. If a popish or profane husband be maried to a wife that maketh profession of the truth of the Gospell, and she be stout, proud, wanton, waspish, wastefull, or giuen to any other like vices, will he not be ready there∣upon to inueigh against the religion she professeth, and vtterly protest against it? So also a popish or profane wife, if she be maried to such an husband. 3. Negligence in obseruing one anothers disposition or conuer∣sation: 3. Negligence in preuenting sin. whereby it commeth to passe that they keepe not backe, nor restraine one another from running into any sinne: but proue such husbands and wiues one to another as Eli proued a father to his sonnes: whence it fell out, that Gods seuere ven∣geance fell vpon the necke of the one, and of the other. Pilats wife though an heathenish woman, shall rise vp in iudgement against many such wiues, for she did what she could to keepe Mat. 27. 19. her husband from shedding innocent bloud. 4. Acomplement all soothing of one anothers humour, and see∣king 4. Man-plea∣sing. mutually to please one another in all things, without re∣spect of good or euill. Such as these the Scripture termeth Eph. 6. 6.  men-pleasers. Hence it commeth to passe that husbands and wiues are so farre from drawing one another from sinne, that the better rather yeelds vnto the worse, and both runne into Diabolus saepe sollicitus est subuertere viros per os coniu∣gum. Orig. in Iob. lib. 2. euill, as Adam was perswaded by his wife to transgresse against Gods expresse charge: and wise Salomon was drawne by his wiues vnto Idolatrie, 1 King. 11. 4. and Sapphira consented to the sacriledge of Ananias her husband, Act. 5. 2. 5. An vndue feare of offending one another by Christian in∣struction, 5. Vndue feare of offence. admonition, reproofe, and the like. Many who are oft
moued in conscience to make knowne to their husbands and wiues the sinnes wherein they liue, and the danger wherein they lie by reason thereof, doe notwithstanding through care∣lesse and causelesse feare, refraine and forbeare to doe so. 6. An impious, and enuious disposition, whereby many hus∣bands 6. Scoffing at the signes of grace. and wiues are moued to mocke, and scoffe at that holy zeale, and forwardnesse which they obserue in their bed∣fellowes: as Michal who resembled Dauid to a foole, or 2 Sam. 6. 20. vaine-fellow, because he manifested his zeale by dancing before the Arke. Thus doe many nip the worke of the spi∣rit in the very bud, and cause grace soone to wither. But cur∣sed be that husband, or wife, that thus peruerteth the maine end of their neere coniunction. §. 29. Of husbands and wiues mutuall care ouer one ano∣thers body. After the good of the soule followeth the good of the body, wherein husband and wife must shew their prouident care each ouer other: and doe what lieth in them to procure the well-fare of one anothers person, and to nourish and cherish one anothers body. This dutie the Apostle layeth down vnder the comparison of a body which he calleth flesh, saying, Eph. 5. 29. No man hateth his owne flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it: now man and wife are Eph. 5. 31. one flesh. This dutie the Apostle in particular applieth to husbands. At the first institution of ma∣riage it was in particular applied to the wife, whom God made to be Gen. 2. 18. an helpe meet for man: so as it is a mutuall dutie appertaining to both. It seemeth that Gen. 27. 14. Rebecha was so care∣full of Isaak in this respect, that she could readily make sauory meat for him, such as he loued. This dutie extendeth it selfe to all estates both of prospe∣rity and aduersity, of health and sicknesse: for so much doe they mutually couenant and promise when they are first ioy∣ned together in mariage, I take thee (saith each to other) for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sicknesse and in health to loue and to cherish. Wherefore they ought mutually both to reioyce in the well-fare of one another, and also in all distresse to succour and comfort each other, putting their shoulders vnder one anothers burden, and helping to ease one another
as much as they can. That which Salomon said of a friend and a brother, may fitly be applied in this case to husband and wife, a friend loueth at all times, and a brother is borne for aduer∣sity, Pro. 17. 17. that is, a trusty and faithfull friend is constant in his good∣will, and ready to performe all duties, of kindnesse at any time, whether it be prosperity or aduersity: the change of out∣ward estate maketh no alteration in his louing affection and friendly cariage: yea he seemeth to be as it were borne and brought forth against the time of trouble and affliction, be∣cause then is his prouident care and tender affection most manifested. Of all friends none ought to be more carefull, none more faithfull one to another then man and wife. How then ought they to loue at all times, and if any triall come to either of them, the other so to carrie himselfe, as it may be truly said they were ioyned together for aduersity? Thus shall they verifie the truth of that whereby God was moued to creare of mankinde male, and female, namely that it was not good for man to be alone, but that it was rather good, Gen. 2. 18. that is, needfull, profitable, and comfortable for man and wo∣man to be together. In which respect the wise-man saith, he that findeth a wife findeth a good thing; and by the rule of Pro. 18. 22. relation we may inferre, she that findeth an husband findeth a good thing. §. 30. Of husbands and wiues backwandnesse to helpe one another in time of need. Contrary to this duty is a certaine vnnaturall affection in sundry husbands and wiues, who much grudge to prouide the things that are needfull for one another. The man com∣monly thinkes the charge too great, the woman thinkes the paines too much: they are affected one to another as if they were meere strangers: nay many strangers will be more ready to performe, and more cheerefull in performing needfull du∣ties (as occasion is offered) then such vnnaturall husbands and wiues. If a little sicknesse, or other like crosse fall on one of them, the other thinkes, neuer any had such a burden; and by their discontent make the burden much more heauy then otherwise it would be: euen as when two oxen are in one yoke, and the one holdeth backe, the draught is made much
harder to the other. Thus doe they peruert one of the prin∣cipall ends of mariage, which is to be a continuall comfort and Gen. 2. 18. helpe each to other, and to ease the burdens of one another: in which respect they are made yoke-fellowes. Iobs wife by her vnnaturall cariage towards him in his affli∣ction Iob 2. 9. did much aggrauate his misery: when he stood in most need of her helpe, she afforded least vnto him: it appeares by Iobs complaint of her, in these words, my breath is strange to Iob 19. 17. my wife, that she altogether neglected him in his misery. The common speech of many after their husband or wife hauing long lien sicke is departed, bewrayeth their vnnaturall affecti∣on: their speech is this, if my husband (or wife) had died so much sooner I had saued so much mony. What doth this intimate but that they could haue beene contented their husband (or wife) should haue died sooner that they might haue spared the more. §. 31. Of Husbands and Wiues mutuall respect of one ano∣thers good name. The prouident care of husbands and wiues ought further to extend it selfe to the credit and good name of one another. As deare ought the good name of the wife be vnto the hus∣band, and of the husband to the wife, as their owne. Mat. 1. 19. The great regard that Ioseph had of the credit of Marie his espou∣sed wife, made him thinke of putting her away priuily when e obserued her to be with childe and knew not of whom: or he was not willing . to make her a publike example. The ame respect moued 2 Sam. 11. 5. Bethsheba to send secretly to Dauid, and ell him that she was with childe. The commendation which he good husband (Pro. 31. 28. 1. A good name is pre∣tious. noted by Salomon) giueth of his wife be∣ing approued by the holy Ghost, sheweth how man and wife aght in that respect to honour each other: and that on good ounds. For 1. A good name is a most pretious thing: Eccl. 7. 3. better then pre∣ious ointment, which giueth a sweet sauour, and Pro. 22. 1. to be chosen oue great riches. 2. The good name of the one is the ho∣nour of the other. 2. So neerely are husbands and wiues ioyned together, the good name of the one cannot but tend to the honour
and credit of the other; so that herein they seeke their owne honour also. §. 32. Of husbands and wiues preuenting each others dis∣credit. For direction herein, consider we how this dutie may be Directions concerning a good name. performed, and how it may be manifested. For the better performing of it, care must be had both to preuent and redresse an ill name, and also to procure and preserue a goodname. To preuent an ill name respect must be had of these three things following, 1. Preuent an ill name, and that 1. What one relateth of another, and how. 2. What eare they giue to things related by others. 3. What censure they giue of one another. For the first, husbands and wiues may in no case delight to 1. By con∣cealing things of ill report. discouer vnto others, and spread abroad the infirmities, and imperfections of one another, or any thing that may tend to the discredit of either of them: but rather couer and con∣ceale them as much as they may with a good conscience. It is expressed that Mat. 1. 19. Ioseph being a iust man laboured to conceale that blemish which he imagined to be in his wife, so as this may stand with iustice: yea also it is a part of Ioue, for 1 Pet. 4. 8. loue co∣uereth a multitude of sinnes. For the second, husbands and wiues must not haue their 2. By closing eares against ill reports. eares wide opened to heare euery tale and report that shall be brought to one against the other, but rather shew themselues displeased and offended with them that are ready to relate things of euill report. If an husband or wife manifest a wil∣lingnesse to hearken after tales and reports of one another, the deuill will stirre vp instruments enow to fill their heads with tales, and those for the most part both friuolous and for∣ged: not only strangers, but children, seruants, and they which are of the same family will euer be telling some tale or other, to currie fauour, as we speake. But an vtter dislike of such flattering tale-bearers, will take away occasion from them of telling vntrue, or slight reports. For the third, the iudgement and censure which husbands 3. By forbea∣ring to cen∣sure rashly. and wiues giue one of another must either be very charitable,
or verie sparing. If one heare reported any notorious crime of the other, they may not be ouer-headie or hastie to iudge and condemne, no though they thinke they see some euidence thereof, but rather suspend their iudgement. This seemeth to be the minde of Ioseph: though he obserued Marie to be with Mat. 1. 19. childe, yet would he not presently iudge her to be a notorious adulteresse, or condemne her for an hypocrite, vnworthie to liue, and therefore would not make her a publike example. In briefe, that husbands and wiues may be the more sparing in censuring one another, they must not rashly beleeue any euill report of one another, but rather suppresse all light suspi∣tions as much as they can. That the iudgement which they giue one of another, may be charitable, in iudging they must well obserue the proper∣ties of loue, which are 1. To interpret doubtfull things in the better part. 2. To mitigate, so farre as truth and iustice will suffer, the faults which are euident. Michal offended against 2 Sam. 6. 20. the first in an high degree, and was cursed. Abigail obserued 1 Sam. 25. 25. the latter, and was blessed. §. 33. Of the wisdome of husbands and wiues, in redressing one anothers ill name. To redresse an ill name, husbands and wiues must first giue one another notice of the report that goeth of them, and en∣deuour 2. Redresse an ill name. to worke in them both a sight, and also a sense of those euils which are in the mouths of others: after notice gi∣uen, they must labour to bring them to repentance of those sinnes, for which they are ill reported of, and to a manifestati∣on of repentance, by doing things meet for repentance, which is by a zealous and conscionable practise of such vettues as are cleane contrarie to the vices for which they were euill spoken of. It may with good probabilitie be gathered out of the hi∣storie of the Leuite, whose wife plaid the whore, that thus he Iudg. 19. 1, 2, &c. dealt with her. And thus Abigail endeuoured to deale with her husband. 1 Sam. 25. 37. §. 34. Of husbands and wiues care in procuring one anothers good name. To procure a good report, husbands and wiues must 3. Procure a good report. First, take notice of the good qualities which are in one
another, and as one hath occasion to speake of the other, to make those good qualities the subiect of their speech: as we l Pro. 31. 28, 29. heard it before commended in the husband of that wife which is described by Salomon. Secondly, they must lend a willing and ioyfull eare to such as shall (so farre as they can conceiue) truly and vnfainedly, without flatterie or hypocrisie, speake any thing in commen∣dation of the one or of the other: not thinking themselues dis∣praised (which is the conceit of many) when their bed-fellow is praised: but rather hauing their hearts the more enlarged to praise God, for bestowing on them such an excellent token and pledge of his fauour. Thirdly, they must imitate those good things which they behold, or heare to be in one another, and so imitate them as they which haue before time knowne both husband and wife, may say, this she learned of him, or this he learned of her. §. 35. Of husbands and wiues wisdome, in preseruing each others good name. To preserue a good name, it will be meet for an husband or 4. Preserue a good name. wife, wisely and seasonably to giue one another notice of that good fame which is raised of them, thereby to prouoke them both to giue glorie to God for the same (Col. 1. 3, 4. as the Apostle than∣keth God for that report which was spred abroad of the faith and loue of the Colossians) and also to walke worthie of that good report (as the Apostle who had giuen a great testimony of the bountie of the Corinthians, earnestly exhorteth them to finish their beneuolence, lest (saith he) I should be ashamed in 2 Cor. 9. 4. this my constant boasting.) For if they of whom there is once a good report raised, decay, wax cold, grow backward, or fall into notorious and scandalous sinnes, they will cleane extin∣guish and put out their good name among men, and turne it into an euill report, according to that which Salomon saith, Dead flies cause the ointment of the Apothecarie to sendforth a Eccles. 10. 1. stinking sauour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdome and honour. 5. Manifest a care of one anothers good name. §. 36. Of husbands and wiues like affection towards one ano∣thers credit. In the last place, to manifest a mutuall prouident care of one
anothers good name, husbands and wiues must be so affected with the report that goeth of either of them, as if the report were of their owne selues. If the report be good, to be glad thereof, and to reioyce thereat; if it be euill, to be grieued, and after an holy manner vexed at it: thus shall they shew a true sympathie and fellow feeling of one anothers credit, according to that generall rule of the Apostle, Rom. 12. 15. Reioyce with them that re∣ioyce, and weepe with them that weepe. §. 37. Of the vices contrarie to that mutuallcare, which man and wife should haue of one anothers credit. Vices contrarie to these duties concerning the good name of Contrarie vices. an husband and wife, are in generall two. One is a readinesse to disgrace and discredit one another, 1. To discredit each other, and that like Michal the wife of Dauid, of whom we heard before. A hatefull and detestable vice this is, which cannot stand with 2 Sam. 6. 20. true matrimoniall loue, but rather argueth an vtter dislike, and a plaine hatred of one another. Husbands and wiues discredit one another, either by pro∣curing an ill name, or hindring a good name. An ill name in procured by these meanes following. 1. By blazing abroad one anothers infirmities: as when 1. By blazing one anothers infirmities abroad. tatling Gossips meet, their vsuall prae is about their husbands, complaining of some vice or other in them: My husband, saith one, is couetous: I cannot get of him any thing almost: he maketh me goe as no body goeth. And my husband, replieth another, is so furious as none can tell how to speake to him: so one after another goeth on in this tracke, some discouering such infirmities as should be con∣cealed; others (which is worse) plainly belying their hus∣bands. In like manner also husbands when they meet with their boone companions, make their wiues the common subiect of all their talke: one accusing his wife of one vice; another his, of another. There are two re∣spects for which this vice (most detestable in it selfe) is made more odious in an husband or a wife. 1. Because they know more then any other of one anothers infirmities: so as if they be so euilly minded, they may much more dis∣credit one another, then any other can. 2. Because in re∣gard
of their neere vnion they are most bound to conceale and couer each others imperfections. Gen. 9. 22, 25. Cam was cursed for reuealing his fathers nakednesse. but a more horrible curse doe husbands and wiues deserue, that so doe. 2. By opening their eares, and giuing credit to euery light 2. By hearing and beleeuing others ill re∣ports. report that any shall raise. More secret heart-burning of one against the other, and more open quarrels and conten∣tions betwixt them, ordinarily arise from hence then from any other thing. 3. By peruerting and mis-interpreting one anothers acti∣ons, 3. By turning euerie thing to the worst. words, yea and thoughts also: taking euery thing in the worst part. 4. By concealing from one another the common euill ru∣mors 4. By concea∣ling euill ru∣mors. which are raised of them, and are in euery mans mouth: of all other, bedfellowes are most fit to disclose such things one to another: and most bound to doe it. Most fit, because of their mutuall familiaritie: most bound, because of their neere vnion. Many husbands and wiues doe hinder one anothers good 5. By enuying and gaine∣saying good reports. name by enuying one at the good report that is made of the other, and gainsaying the same: as if the credit of the one must needs turne to the discredit of the other. Thus as water quen∣cheth hot iron, so this enuious disposition is a meanes to ex∣tinguish the heat of fame, and to put out the glorious light of a good name. Whereby as they impaire the credit and honour of one another, so they monstrously discredit and dishonour themselues. The other generall vice in this kinde, is a carelesse regard, 2. Neglect of each others fame. or plaine neglect of one anothers fame: when the husband is no way affected with any report that goeth of his wife, nor the wife with any of the husband: but as if they were meere stran∣gers one to another, they passe by all reports made of one an∣other. What mutuall loue can there be in such? howsoeuer their hands haue beene ioyned together, surely their hearts were neuer vnited, so as it had beene better they had neuer knowne one another, vnlesse the Lord doe afterwards knit their hearts, and vnite their affections more neerely and firme∣ly together.
§. 38. Of husbands and wiues mutuall prouidence about the goods of the family. Yet there remaineth one thing more, whereabout husbands Treatise 3. §. 29. and wiues ought to manifest a mutuall prouident care each ouer other: and that is about the goods of this world. How∣soeuer the husband, while he liueth with his wife, hath the truest propertie in them, and the greatest title vnto them, yet I referre this to those mutuall duties which man and wife owe each to other, in three respects. First, because in conscience they appertaine to the vse of the wife, as well as of the husband. Secondly, because the wife is by Gods prouidence appoin∣ted a ioynt gouernour with the husband of the familie, and in that respect ought to be an helpe in prouiding such a sufficien∣cie of the goods of this world, as are needfull for that estate wherein God hath set them, and for that charge which God hath committed to them. Thirdly, because the wife, if she suruiue the husband, ought to haue such a portion of those goods, as are meet for her place and charge. In these respects we see it requisite, yea a bounden dutie, that husband and wife, euen in a mutuall regard one of ano∣ther, be as prouident as they can be with a good conscience in getting, keeping, and disposing competent goods and riches for the mutuall good one of another. Concerning the hus∣bands dutie in this respect no question is made: the practise of all good husbands mentioned in Scripture, the care of proui∣ding for their 1 Tim. 5. 8. See Treat. 4. §. 46. owne enioyned to them, their place and office to be their wiues head, with many other like arguments, where∣of we shall more distinctly speake, when we come to declare the particular duties of husbands, doe proue as much. The greatest question is concerning the wife, whether she be bound to take any care about the goods. But if the Scripture be tho∣owly searched, we shall finde proofe enough to shew that euen he also is bound hereunto. For first, the generall end which God aimed at in making the woman (namely to be Gen. 2. 18. an helpe o man) implieth as much: for herein may she be a verie great helpe, as we shall see by and by in sundry particulars. 2. That
generall property attributed to a wife to be Prou. 18. 22. a good thing, con∣firmeth as much: for that which is profitable is called good: and it is one respect wherein a wife is termed a good thing, that she may by her prouidence and diligence bring much profit to her husband: and therefore in this, among other respects, the good wife which Salomon describeth, is said Prou. 31. 12. to doe good to her husband all the daies of her life: for by her industry and prouidence shee did so preserue and increase his goods, that Vers. 11. the heart of her husband trusted in her, and he had no need of spoile. If the particular actions whereby that good wife is de∣scribed be well noted, we may easily obserue that she was an especiall helpe vnto her husband, euen in his outward estate. From all which, we may inferre these two points. First, that this prouident care about outward temporall goods is lawfull, not vnbeseeming a Christian man or woman. Secondly, that it is a mutuall dutie appertaining both to husband and wife. For the first, how needfull the goods of this world are for preseruation of life and health, estate of the family, good of Church and Common-wealth, releefe of the poore, with the like vses, no man can be ignorant. God hath giuen them as blessings to his children, and that often times in great abun∣dance; and his children haue accordingly beene thankfull for them: so as a prouident care about them is not vnlawfull, but very expedient and needfull. For the second, If there should not be a ioint care herein, the care and paines of the one might be altogether in vaine. For suppose an husband be industrious, as Gen. 31. 40. Iaakob was, and get much abroad, if the wife either by her vnthriftinesse, idle∣nesse, negligence, or the like vices, suffer that which is brought home to be embeaseled and wasted; or by her prodigalitie, bra∣uerie, or loue of vaine companie, consume it her selfe, where will be the profit of the husbands paines? Or on the other side, if a wife should be as painfull and prosperous in getting, as Prou. 31. 10. &c. the good houswife before mentioned was, and the husband by carding, dicing, drinking, reuelling, or other like meanes should waste all away, what fruit would remaine of the wiues prouidence? In this mutuall prouident care of husband and wife, each of them must haue an eye to their owne place:
affaires abroad doe most appertaine to the man, and are especi∣ally Externa negotia viro permitte. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. to be ordered by him: that which the wife is especially to care for, is the businesse of the house: for the Apostle laieth it downe as a rule for wiues (as we shall hereafter more particu∣larly declare) that they Tit. 2. 5. keepe at home, and 1 Tim. 5. 14. gouerne the house. By this means may they be very profitable each to other. §. 39. Of the vices contrary to the good prouidence of hus∣band and wife, about the goods of the family. Contrary to that dutie, are these vices following. 1. Couetousnesse, and ouermuch care for themselues: as Contrary vices. when an husband so raketh, and scrapeth, and hoordeth vp for himselfe, as he neither affordeth vnto his wife so much as is 1. Couetous∣nesse. meet for her place while he liueth with her, nor thinketh of prouiding sufficient maintenance for her, if shee ouer-liue him, but rather thinketh how to defraud her of that which the law casteth vpon her. Or when a wife secretly hoordeth vp what∣soeuer she can get, either by her owne industry, or else by pur∣loining from her husband: sometimes selling corne, wares, houshold-stuffe, or other like commodities, so priuily as the husband shall neuer know it: sometimes taking money out of his counter, box, bagge, chest, or the like, so as either it shall not be missed, or if it be, it shall not be knowne who had it. Many there be who in mistrust of their husbands proui∣dence, or in dislike of them, or on some other by-respects, com∣mit whatsoeuer they can get to the trust and custody of others, whereby it oft commeth to passe, that they themselues, meet∣ing with deceitfull friends, are vtterly defeated, euen because they dare not make their fraud knowne. As Couetousnesse is in it selfe an odious sinne; so it is made much more hainous by defrauding husband or wife, who ought to be as deare each to other as themselues. 2. Prodigalitie, and too lauish spending vpon themselues, 2. Prodigality. and those things which are most agreeable to their owne cor∣rupt humor: as when husbands without any meane or mea∣ure, spend their goods abroad in hunting, hauking, carding, icing, eating, drinking, or the like, and suffer their wiues to want at home, and yet tooke their wiues to maintaine them, and therefore had their portion. Or when wiues bring their
husbands into debt, and weaken, if not cleane ouerthrow their estate, by gorgeous decking and adorning their houses, by braue and costly apparell, by dainty fare, by gossipping a∣broad, with the like. Many wiues are so violent herein, that if their desire and humour be not satisfied, their husbands shall haue no rest (forsooth they brought a portion, and maintained they must and will be; it skilleth not whether their husbands estate can beare it or no) in so much as many are forced wit∣tingly, for quietnesse sake, to suffer their estate to sinke. O foo∣lish and wretched wiues! how little do they consider that they were maried to doe their husbands good, and not euill all the daies of their life? is this to be an helpe to man? or rather is it not cleane to thwart Gods counsell, and peruert his purpose? can we thinke that God will forbeare, and not be auenged of them? yet much more will God be auenged of the forenamed husbands, because of that image of himselfe which he hath placed in them, and because of that place and authority where∣in he hath set them. The Apostle expresly saith of them, that they are worse then Infidels, which being so, they must looke for 1 Tim. 5. 8. the greater iudgement. 3. Idlenesse, and a carelesse neglect of their estate. Many 3. Idlenesse. men spend day after day, like a bird that flieth vp and downe, as it falleth out, from tree to tree, from twigge to twigge: they goe from place to place, but know not for what end: as they meet with any company, so they abide as long as the company tarrieth, and then seeke after other company, and are ready to goe with any to Ale-house, Tauerne, Play-house, Bowling∣alley, or other like places. Many women also spend all the fore∣noone in lying a bed and tyring themselues, and the after∣noone as occasion is offered in sitting idly at home, or walking forth to little purpose, but only to weare out time, little re∣garding their husbands estate, whether it increase, or diminish. Thus by the idlenesse and carelesnesse of husband and wife, come faire estates many times to ruine, and both of then brought to penury and beggery. §. 40. Of husbands and wiues ioint care in gouerning the family. Hitherto I haue deliuered such common duties as mutually
respect the husband and wife, and are to be performed of each to other. There are other common duties which they are both iointly bound to performe to other persons: and those either members of the family, or strangers comming to the family. Concerning the members of the family, though there be some peculiar duties belonging to the master, and some to the mistresse, some to the father, and some to the mother, of which we shall speake in their due place; yet in generall the gouern∣ment of the family, and the seuerall members thereof belon∣geth to the husband and wife both (if at least they haue a fa∣mily) and a ioint common dutie it is to be helpfull one to an∣other therein. Obiect. Seeing it is not necessarily required, that a hus∣band and wife should haue a family to gouerne, for two may be maried and haue neither children nor seruants (as many are) and yet be true husband and wife; why is this care of a family ranked among the duties of husband and wife? Answ. 1. Because ordinarily when two are maried they ga∣ther a family, and are the gouernours thereof: so as though it faile in some particulars, yet for the most part it holdeth. 2. Because the ioint gouernment whereof I speake in this place is by vertue of the mariage-bond: for if a man and a woman should liue together in an house, and by mu∣tuall consent haue a ioint authority and gouernment, this would be very offensiue to all that should know it, or heare of it: neither were they by any ordinance of God bound to be so helpfull one to another as husband and wife: nor the members of a family so bound to subiect themselues to both. 3. The duty whereof I speake, though it be about the gouernment of a family, yet hath it respect to an hus∣band as he is an husband, and to a wife as shee is a wife; namely, that by vertue of their mariage-bond, and neere vnion, they be helpfull one to another in well-ordering the things of the family. Whether the man ought to look to the good gouernment of
his house is a question without all question. He is the highest in the family, and hath both authoritie ouer all, and the charge of all is committed to his charge: he is as a king in his owne house: as a king is to see that land well gouerned where he is king, so he that is the chiefe ruler in an house. The dutie which the Apostle applieth in particular to Bishops & Deacons, in ge∣nerall appertaineth to all husbands, 1 Tim. 3. 4. that they rule their owne house honestly: and againe, Vers. 12. that they be such as can rule their children well, and their owne housholds. The care of many hus∣bands is in this respect commended in Scripture, as of Gen. 18. 19. A∣bram, of & 35. 2, &c. Iaakob, of Js 4. 15. Iosuah, of Psal. 101. 2. &c. Dauid, the Ioh. 4 53. Ruler at Galile, and of many other. That the wife also ought to be an helpe to him therein, is very euident: for the Apostle layeth it expresly to their charge, 1 Tim. 5. 14. that they gouerne the house: would the Wise man haue so highly commended a wife Prou. 31. 11, &c. for well gouerning her hus∣bands house if it had not appertained to her? It is very likely that wise Abigail had a great hand in gouerning Nabals house, because the seruants made complaint to her of Nabals churlish∣nesse, and because she had the seruants at command, readily to doe what she would haue them; yea also, because she could so readily prepare such store of prouision for Dauid and his men, as she did. Hence is it that the wife is called Mater-fa∣milias. mistresse of the house, as well as the husband Pater-fa∣milias. master of the house. Obiect. 1 Tim. 2. 12. A woman is not to teach, nor to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man. Answ. 1. That branch of teaching hath respect to publike assemblies, and Churches, in which she may not teach: but not to priuate families, in which she may, and ought to teach: for Pro. 31. 4. Barthshebah taught Salomon. When Acts 18. 26. Apollos was brought to the house of Aquila, Priscilla the wife of Aquila did helpe to expound to Apollos the way of God more perfectly. 2. The other branch concerning authoritie, hath not refe∣rence to the inferiour members in the family, ouer which the wife of an houshold gouernour hath authoritie, but only to the husband, ouer whom if she take any authoritie, she vsurpeth it. Therfore neither this place of Scripture, nor any other doth ex∣clude the wife, being iointly considered with the husband, to rule & gouerne those in the family which are vnder them both.
2. Obiect. This ioint gouernment of the wife doth much impaire the dignity and authority of the husband. Answ. Nothing lesse: for she is subordinate to her husband, and must so rule others as she be subiect to her husband, and not command any thing against his command, (prouided that his command be not against the Lord, and his word.) We see that in all estates the king or highest gouernour hath other Magistrates vnder him, who haue a command ouer the sub∣iects, and yet thereby the kings supreme authoritie is no whit impaired, but rather the better established, and he the more honoured. So is it in a family. 1. Reason. Husbands and wiues by their mutuall assi∣stance bring great help one to another. Plus vident o∣culi quàm ocu∣lus. Arist. Polit. li. 3. c. 7. Let therefore husbands and wiues herein assist one another, for so they may be very helpfull one to another, and bring, by their mutuall helpe in gouerning, much good to the family. The husband by his helpe aiding his wife, addeth much au∣thoritie vnto her, and so causeth that she is not despised, nor lightly esteemed. The wife by her helpe causeth many things to be espied, and so redressed, which otherwise might neuer haue beene found out: for two eies see more then one, especi∣ally when one of those is more at hand, and in presence, as the 2. Reason. Many things in a family more fit for the one to meddle with, then for the other. wife is in the house. Besides there are many things in well gouerning a family more fit for one to meddle withall then for the other: as for the husband to meddle with the great and weightie affaires of the family (as performing Gods worship, appointing and setling good orders, prouiding conuenient house-roome, and other necessaries for the family: keeping children when they grow In familia di∣spertita sunt of∣ficia: sunt{que} alia viri, alia vxo∣ris propria. Pro▪ sunt ergo vter{que} alteri sua in commune confe rentes: ob e∣am{que} causam suauitas in hac tali amicitia in∣est, vtilitas{que} maxima. Arist. Eth. li. 8. ca. 12. great, or waxe stubborne, in awe: ruling men seruants, with the like) And for the wife to meddle with some lesse, but very needfull matters, as nourishing and instructing children when they are young, adorning the house, ordering the prouision brought into the house, ruling maid seruants, with the like. Yea further, as the man especially is to performe the very acti∣ons of prayer, reading the word, catechizing, and other like duties in the family, so the wife may be a great helpe in put∣ting her husband in minde both of the dutie it selfe, and of the time of performing it, and incouraging him to doe it, in gathering the family together, and exhorting them to be for∣ward,
in making her selfe an example to the rest by her diligent and reuerend attention, in oft vrging and pressing to her chil∣dren and seruants such points of instruction as her husband hath taught; yea, in praying, reading, teaching, and performing like exercises her selfe, so farre as she is able, when her hus∣band is absent, or negligent and carelesse, and will not himselfe doe them; or it may be, is not able to doe them: or if she per∣forme them not her selfe, in getting some other to performe them. §. 41. Of the vices contrary to a ioint care of gouerning the family. The minde and practise of many, both husbands and wiues, Vices con∣trary. is contrary to this dutie. Many a husband because the wiues office is especially to 1. When hus∣bands put off all gouern∣ment to their wiues. abide at home, will put off all gouernment to the wife: lea∣uing it to her not only to order the things in the house, but al∣so to bring in all needful things, to order and gouerne the chil∣dren both young and old, yea euen to prouide for them also, to take in, to put out, to vse all sorts of seruants as pleaseth her: yea, if seruants shall be stubborne and stout against her, he will take no notice of it, nor endure to be told of it, much lesse afford her his assistance, but suffer her to be disgraced and despised. As for religious duties, he will no way med∣dle with them. Oh base minded men, vnworthy to be hus∣bands and heads of wiues! shall your wiues who were made to be an helpe to you, haue no helpe from you, o not in those things which especially belong to your charge? shall the weaker vessels beare all the burden? Assuredly as the man carrieth away the greatest reputation and honour when a family is well gouerned (though it be by the ioynt care and wisdome of his wife) so lieth he most open to the iudgement of God if the gouernment thereof be neglected, and through the neglect thereof, children and seruants grow impious: instance 1 Sam. 3. 12, 13. Elie, and 2 Sam. 15. Dauid. For as in a com∣mon-wealth, the greatest honour of good gouernment, victo∣rious battels, happy peace, and prosperity, and the greatest dis∣honor and dammage of the contrary, redoundeth to the king, so to the man who is chiefe gouernour in a family: for it is presupposed, that all which doe any good are instruments of
the highest gouernour: if any euill or mischiefe fall out, that it is through his negligence. On the other side, because the husband is the most princi∣pall, 2. When wiues refuse to adde their aide. many wiues thinke that the gouernment of the family nothing at all appertaines to them, and thereupon are care∣lesse of the good thereof, and will not stirre their least finger to order any thing aright: but, if any thing be amisse, lay all the blame on their husbands. Doe not such peruert that maine end for which God made them, euen to be an helpe? Doe they not carrie themselues most vnworthy of the place where∣in God hath set them, namely to be ioynt-gouernours with their husbands, and partakers of their dignities? As by their negligence they make themselues accessary to all the euill which falleth out in the family, so assuredly shall they haue their part in those iudgements which are executed on the head thereof. Most contrary to the forenamed dutie is the practise of 3. When husbands or wiues are hin∣derances each to other. such as are hindrances one to another in gouerning the fa∣mily: as when wiues are not only negligent themselues in comming to religious exercises, but keepe backe children and seruants, and so are a great griefe vnto their religious hus∣bands: or when they vse any of the children or seruants to be instruments of iniquity; or are themselues disquiet and trou∣blesome in the house, like to her of whom Salomon speaketh in this prouerbe, It is better to dwell in the corner of the house Pro. 21. 9. top, then with a contentious woman in a wide house. Husbands also are oft an hinderance to that good gouern∣ment which their wiues would helpe forward, when they scoffe and scorne at that good counsell which their wiues giue them for that purpose, or when they will not suffer their wiues to meddle with any thing at all, nor endure that they should finde any fault, much lesse take in hand to redresse any thing that is amisse. These and such like peruerse dispositi∣ons are in husbands and wiues, whereby it commeth to passe that they who were ioyned together to be a mutuall helpe each to other, proue heauy, yea intolerable burdens. §. 42. Of husbands and wiues mutuall helpe in hospitality. The next common duty of husband and wife respecteth
such as come to their house, but are no particular members thereof, whether they be kindred, alliance, acquaintance, or strangers, especially if they be Saints, to whom Heb. 13. 2. Rom. 12. 13. hospitality, that is, a kinde and courteous entertainment, is due. Herein therefore must husbands and wiues be helpfull one to ano∣ther: for as it is required of 1 Tim. 3. 2. husbands, so also of & 5. 10. wiues to be harborous, namely while they are maried, together with their husbands, and when they are widowes, of themselues. Gen. 18 6. &c. Abraham and Sarah were herein an helpe one to another, when the three Angels in shapes of men came to their house: so were 2 King. 4. 8. the Shunemite and her husband when Elisha the Prophet came to their house. For hospitality, that it is a commendable dutie belonging Reasons. 1. Hospitality a commenda∣ble dutie. to such as are house-keepers and able to giue entertainment, is euident by the precepts and examples before specified, as also by the blessing which God thereupon hath brought to the houses of them that were giuen thereunto, which the Apostle intimateth in these words, Heb. 13. 2. thereby some haue enter∣tained Angels vnawares. Now therfore husbands and wiues be∣ing (as we haue heard) ioynt gouernours, as in other things, so in this they ought to lend an helping hand each to other, and that for these reasons. 1. Because in giuing entertainment there are sundry 2. The enter∣tainment will be the better by a mutuall helpe. things to be done, whereof some are proper to the husbands place, and some to the wiues. To take order for the prouision of things without doores is more fit for the husband, Gen. 18. 7. Abra∣ham did it: to order the smaller things within doores is more fit for the wife; that was left to Vers. 6. Sarah. 2. Because it is meet that guests should know they are wel∣come 3. Guests will be more cheerefull. both to the husband and to the wife, that so they may be the more cheerefull. 3. Because a mutuall consent, and cheerefull help herein will 4. Mutuall loue will be more firme. be an especiall means, as to manifest their mutuall affection, so to hold the hearts of man and wife firme and close together, and make them the better like and loue one the other: espe∣cially if the husband shall shew himselfe as ready and willing to entertaine his wiues friends and kindred as his owne, and so the wife her husbands (as they ought.) For as they themselues
are made one flesh, so ought each of them to esteeme of the others friends as of their owne. 4. Because thus they shew a mutuall desire of bringing 5. A desire of one anothers good mani∣fested. Gods blessing on each other, and vpon their whole family. §. 43. Of vices contrary to mutuall helpe in hospitality. Contrary to this dutie is for the most part couetousnesse in the husband, and lasinesse in the wife. The man, because the charge of the family lieth on him, distrustfully feareth lest he should want for his owne. I denie not but that a prouident care for our owne, & namely for them of the family, is needfull and commendable, 1 Tim. 5. 8. he that prouideth not for them is worse then an infidell: so as a man may be ouerlauish in giuing entertainment, if he goe beyond his meanes, impouerish his estate, and disable himselfe to prouide for his owne, as many doe: yet when a man hath sufficient, yea and abundance, when there is no iust cause, but meerely vpon an vndue feare too carkingly, and distrustfully to pinch, and grudge to giue entertaiment to any, is vnbeseeming a Christian, yea also to be worse then an infidell; not worthy to haue an house, or any thing fit for entertainment; no nor worthy of common society. The woman on the other side grudgeth at the paines she must take, and trouble she must vndergoe about entertai∣ning guests, and thereupon is loth that any at any time should come to their house. Concerning a wife, I denie not but that an husband may be in this kinde ouerburdensome to her, by being too ioueall, as they speake, and bringing guests too often into the house, especially if they be guests of no good name; and by that meanes make her euen weary of her life: but yet for a wife to refuse all paines in that kinde, and to be discontented when her husband inuites any friends, or when any come (as the three Angels did to Abraham) vnawares, argueth not a louing affection, nor a wiuelike subiection vnto her husband, to be in her. These faults are so much the greater when the husband, or wife, are free and forward in entertaining their owne kindred
and friends: but are backward, and grudge at the entertain∣ment of each others friends and kindred. Hence commonly ariseth much heart-burning of one against the other: yea much iarre and contention betwixt them: and from dislike of the practise of one another in this kinde oft followeth a dislike of one anothers person: so that as the fault is bad in it selfe, it proues to be much worse in the mischiefes that follow vpon it. §. 44. Of husbands and wiues mutuall helpe in releeuing the poore. The last common and ioynt dutie wherein husband and wife ought to be helpfull each to other, respecteth those that are without the house, namely the poore, and such as stand in need of their helpe, who are to be releeued and succoured. Be∣cause man and wife vsually meale together, and are ioynt par∣takers of Gods good creatures, they must put one another in minde of that precept of charity which was giuen to the Iewes when they were at their meales, Neh. 8. 10. send part vnto them for whom none is prouided. The good wife which is set forth by the holy Ghost for a patterne and example vnto others to follow, together with her husband, are noted to be helpfull one to another in this dutie: for she is said Pro. 31. 20. to stretch out her hand to the poore, and to the needy: and he is said Vers. 28. to praise her, thereby incouraging her to hold on in doing those good things which she did. What liberty the wife hath, or howfar forth she may be restrained in case her husband vtterly refuse to giue consent, we shall Treat. 3. §. 23. 33. hereafter declare in the particular duties of wiues: the point here noted is, that both the hus∣band himselfe must according to his abilitie be bountifull to the poore, and suffer his wife, yea prouoke her so to be, and withall allow her wherewithall to be bountifull: and that the wife also must stirre vp her husband to liberalitie in this respect, and her selfe open her hand to the poore in the things which lawfully she may giue. There is nothing wherby a man or wife can bring more profit to the house, then by giuing to the poore: that which is giuen
to the poore is Prou. 19. 17. lent to the Lord, and he will repay it with great increase: it is as 2 Cor. 9. 6. seed, which being liberally sowen, will bring forth a plentifull haruest: yea, it is a meanes to make vs Luke 16. 9. friends, to speake a good word for vs at the barre of Christs iudgement seat: and it bringeth not only the Iob 29. 13. & 31. 20. blessing of men, but Matth. 5. 7. of God also, euen the greatest blessing of all, the Mat. 25. 34. blessing of eternall life: for it is Heb. 13. 16. a sacrifice with which God is well pleased. The Apo∣stle noteth this to be one of Christs oracles, which by word of mouth he left vnto his Disciples, Acts 20. 35. It is more blessed to giue then to receiue. Besides, husbands and wiues in distributing almes, may re∣ceiue 2. Husband and wife in place to giue good directi∣on one to an∣other. good direction one from another: the husband by tel∣ling the wife who are fit to be releeued (for commonly hus∣bands better know those which are abroad out of the family) the wife by telling the husband what things are fittest to be giuen away: for wiues commonly know of what things there is greatest store, and what may in the house be best spared. §. 45. Of husbands and wiues vnmercifulnesse to the poore. Contrarie is the vnmercifulnesse of many husbands, who Vices con∣trarie. are not only hard-hearted themselues (neuer giuing any thing vnlesse by the law of the land they be forced, & then they part 1. Vnmerci∣fulnesse of the husband. with that which is giuen, so grudgingly, as it is nothing at all acceptable to God (for 2 Cor. 9. 7. God loueth a cheerfull giuer) but also tie their wiues hands, and suffer them to giue nothing. Wherein 2. Binding his wiues hands. they bring both the cry of the poore, and also the groanes and griefe of a mercifull wife who is thus restrained, vpon their owne necks, and aggrauate their sinne in an high degree. On the other side, the vnmercifulnesse of many wiues is also contrarie to the forenamed dutie: for there are many, who though they haue libertie to giue of the common goods, and also allowance of their owne out of which they may giue, yet couetously hoord vp all they can get, giue not a pennies worth, out rather suffer victuals and other things to perish in the house, and when they are naught to fling them away, then that any thing whilst it is good should be giuen out of the house. Shall not the creatures which are spoiled in an house,
and the poore that haue wanted, make a loud crie in the eares Read Iam. 5. 1, 2. &c. of the Lord against them? Yea further, many wiues are grieued at their husbands bountie, and still mouing him to shut his hand, and giue no more. Are they not plaine deuils herein, opposing against that which is good?
The third Treatise. Of wiues particular duties. §. 1. Of the generall heads of this treatise. EPHES. 5. 22. Wiues submit your selues vnto your owne husbands as vnto the Lord. Vers. 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, euen as Christ is the head of the Church: and he is the Sauiour of the bodie. Vers. 24. Therefore as the Church is subject to Christ, so let wiues be subiect to their husbands in euerie thing. IN the particular declaration of wiues du∣ties, the Apostle noteth two points, 1. The dutie required. 2. The reason to enforce it. In setting forth the dutie, he declareth 1. The matter wherin it consisteth. 2. The manner how it is to be per∣formed. In the matter we may note, 1. The thing required, . subiection. 2. The person whom it respecteth, their . owne husbands. The manner respecteth, 1. The qualitie of that subiection. 2. The extent    
To declare the qualitie of wiues subiection to their hus∣bands, two rules are set downe. 1. That it be such a subiection, as As vnto the Lord. should be performed to Christ. 2. That it be such a subiection as the As the Church is sub∣iect to Christ. Church performeth vnto Christ. The extent of wiues subiection doth stretch it selfe verie farre, euen to , In euerie thing. all things. The reason to enforce all these points is taken from that place of eminencie and authoritie, wherein the husband is set aboue his wife: which is, 1. Propounded vnder the metaphor of an head (for the hus∣band is the head of the wife.) 2. Amplified by that resemblance which therein he hath vnto Christ. In which resemblance two points are noted. 1. That the husband, by vertue of his place, carrieth the verie image of Christ (euen as Christ is the head of the Church.) 2. That the husband by vertue of his office is a protector of his wife (and he is the sauiour of the body.) §. 2. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 2. subiection in generall. The first point to be handled in the treatise of wiues parti∣cular duties is the generall matter of all (Subiection) vnder which all other particulars are comprised, for it hath as large Maritum habe∣re Dominum meruit mulieris culpa, quod ta∣men nisi serue∣tur, deprauabi∣tur ampliùs na∣tura, & auge∣bitur culpa. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. lib. 11. c. 37. Ante peccatum non aliter fa∣ctam fuisse de∣cet credere mu∣lierem nisi vt vir ei domina∣retur. Ibid. an extent as that Honour which is required in the first com∣mandement, being applied to wiues. When first the Lord declared vnto woman her dutie, he set it downe vnder this phrase, Thy desire shall be subiect to thine husband, Gen. 3. 16. Obiect. That was a punishment inflicted on her for her transgression? Answ. And a law too, for triall of her obedience, which if it be not obserued, her nature will be more depraued, and her fault more increased. Besides, we cannot but thinke that the woman was made before the fall, that the man might rule ouer her. Vpon this ground the Prophets and Apostles haue oft vrged the same. Sarah is commended for this, that she was subiect to her husband (1. Pet. 3. 6.) Hereby the holy Ghost would teach wiues, that Subiection ought to be as salt to season
euery dutie which they performe to their husband. Their ve∣ry opinion, affection, speech, action, and all that concerneth the husband, must sauour of subiection. Contrary is the dispo∣sition of many wiues, whom ambition hath tainted and cor∣rupted within and without: they cannot endure to heare of subiection: they imagine that they are made slaues thereby. But I hope partly by that which hath beene before deliuered concerning those common duties which man and wife doe mutually owe each to other, and partly by the particulars which vnder this generall are comprised, but most especially Quem vocavit ad culpam mu∣lier, iustum est vt eum guber∣natorem assu∣ma, ne iterum foeminea facili∣tate labatur. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7. by the duties which the husband in particular oweth to his wife, it will euidently appeare, that this subiection is no seruitude. But were it more then it is, seeing God requireth subiection of a wife to her husband, the wife is bound to yeeld it. And good reason it is that she who first drew man into sin, should be now subiect to him, lest by the like womanish weaknesse she fall againe. §. 3. Of an husbands Treat. 4. §. 6, 7. superioritie ouer a wife, to be acknow∣ledged by a wife. The subiection which is required of a wife to her husband implieth two things. 1. That she acknowledge her husband to be her superiour. 2. That she respect him as her superiour. That acknowledgement of the husbands superioritie is twofold, 1. Generall of any husband. 2. Particular of her owne husband.   The generall is the ground of the particular: for till a wife be informed that an husband, by vertue of his place, is his wiues superiour, she will not be perswaded that her owne hus∣band is aboue her, or hath any authoritie ouer her. First therefore concerning the generall, I will lay downe Proofes that the husband is aboue the wife some euident and vndeniable proofes, to shew that an husband is his wiues superiour, and hath authoritie ouer her. The proofes are these following. 1. God of whom, Rom. 13. 1. the powers that be ordained, are, hath po∣wer to place his Image in whom he will, and to whom God giueth superioritie and authority, the same ought to be ac∣knowledged
to be due vnto them. But God said of the man to the woman, he shall rule ouer thee, (Gen. 3. 16.) 2. Nature hath placed an eminencie in the male ouer the Mari & foemi∣nae ae natura tri∣buium est, vt hi, praesit, illa obediat, cum mas praestanti∣or sit. Arist. Pol. lib. 1. female: so as where they are linked together in one yoake, it is giuen by nature that he should gouerne, she obey. This did the heathen by light of nature obserue. 3. The titles and names, whereby an husband is set forth, doe implie a superiority and authority in him, as . Lord, (1 Pet. 3. 6.)  Master, (Est. 1. 17.)  Guide, (Prou. 2. 17.) . Head, (1 Cor. 11. 3.) . Image and glory of God, (1 Cor. 11. 7.) 4. The persons whom the husband by vertue of his place, and whom the wife by vertue of her place, represent, most euidently proue as much: for an husband representeth Christ, and a wife, the Church, (Eph. 5. 23.) 5. The circumstances noted by the holy Ghost at the wo∣mans creation implie no lesse, as that she was created after man, for mans good, and out of mans side, (Gen. 2. 18, &c.) 6. The very Sicapilli pro velamine dati sunt, qua gratia aliud addendū est velamen? Vt non tantum na∣tura, sed etiam voluntate sub∣iectam se esse confiteatur. Chrys. in 1 Cor. hom. 26. attire which nature and custome of all times and places haue taught women to put on, confirmeth the same: as long haire, vailes, and other couerings ouer the head: this and the former argument doth the Apostle himselfe vse to this very purpose, 1 Cor. 11. 7, &c. The point then being so cleere, wiues ought in conscience to acknowledge as much: namely that an husband hath supe∣riority 1. Wiues must acknowledge a superioritie in husbands. and authoritie ouer a wife. The acknowledgement hereof is a maine and principall dutie, and a ground of all o∣ther duties. Till a wife be fully instructed therein and truly perswaded thereof, no dutie can be performed by her as it ought: for subiection hath relation to superioritie and autho∣ritie. The very notation of the word implieth as much. How then can subiection be yeelded, if husbands be not acknow∣ledged superiors? It may be forced, as one King conquered in battell by another, may be compelled to yeeld homage to the conqueror, but yet because he still thinketh with himselfe, that he is no whit inferiour, he will hardly be brought willingly to yeeld a subiects dutie to him, but rather expect a time when he may free himselfe and take reuenge of the conqueror.
§. 4. Of a fond conceit, that husband and wife are equall. Contrary to the forenamed subiection is the opinion of ma∣ny wiues, who thinke themselues euery way as good as their husbands, and no way inferiour to them. The reason whereof seemeth to be that small inequalitie Of all that are inferiours, the wife commeth neerest to a paritic. which is betwixt the husband and the wife: for of all degrees wherein there is any difference betwixt person and person, there is the least disparitie betwixt man and wife. Though the man be as the head, yet is the woman as the heart, which is the most excellent part of the body next the head, farre more excellent then any other member vnder the head, and almost equall to the head in many respects, and as necessary as the head. As an euidence, that a wife is to man as the heart to the head, she was at her Gen. 2. 21. first creation taken out of the side of man where his heart lieth; and though the woman was at first 1 Cor. 11. 12. of the man created out of his side, yet is the man also by the woman. Euer since the first creation man hath beene borne and brought forth out of the womans wombe: so as neither the man is without the woman, nor the woman without the man: yea, as 1 Cor. 7. 4. Cùm de pudici∣tia sermonem habet, magna paritas. Chrys. hom. 19. in 1 Cor. 7. the wife hath not power of her owne body, but the husband, so the husband hath not power of his owne body, but the wife. They are also 1 Pet. 3. 7. . heires together of the grace of life. Besides, wiues are mothers of the same children, whereof their husbands are fa∣thers (for God said to both, Gen. 1. 28. multiplie and increase) and mi∣stresses of the same seruants whereof they are masters (for Sa∣rah is called & 16. 4. Obiect. Answ. mistresse) and in many other respects there is a common equitie betwixt husbands and wiues; whence many wiues gather that in all things there ought to be a mu∣tuall equalitie. But from some particulars to inferre a generall is a very weake argument. 1. Doth it follow, that because in many things there is a common equitie betwixt Iudges of Assise, Iustices of peace, and Constables of townes, that therefore there is in all things an equalitie betwixt them? 2. In many things there is not a common equitie: for the husband may command his wife, but not she him. 3. Euen in those things wherein there is a common equity,
there is not an equality: for the husband hath euer euen in all things a superioritie: as if there be any difference euen in the forenamed instances, the husband must haue the stroake: as in giuing the name of Rachels youngest childe, where the wife would haue one name, the husband another, that name which the husband gaue, stood, (Gen. 35. 18.) Though there seeme to be neuer so little disparitie, yet God hauing so expresly appointed subiection, it ought to be ac∣knowledged: and Possunt con∣iuges per chari∣tatem seruire inuicem, sed mulierem non permittit Apo∣stolus dominari in virum. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. l. 11. c. 37. though husband and wife may mutually serue one another through loue: yet the Apostle suffereth not a woman to rule ouer the man. §. 5. Of a wiues acknowledgement of her Treat. 4 §. 9. owne husbands superioritie. The truth and life of that generall acknowledgement of husbands honour, consisteth in the particular application ther∣of vnto their owne proper husbands. The next dutie therefore is, that wiues acknowledge their All wiues must acknowledge their owne husbands wor∣thy of honour. owne husbands, euen those to whom by Gods prouidence they are ioyned in mariage, to be worthy of an husbands honour, and to be their superiour: thus much the Apostle intendeth by that particle of restraint (. Eph. 5. 22, 24. owne) which he vseth very often: so likewise doth 1 Pet. 3. 1, 5. S. Peter, exhorting wiues to be in subiecti∣on 1 Cor. 7. 2. to their owne husbands: and hereunto restraining the com∣mendation of the ancient good wiues, that they were in sub∣iection to their owne husbands. Obiect. What if a man of meane place be maried to a wo∣man of eminent place, or a seruant be maried to his mi∣stresse, or an aged woman to a youth, must such a wife acknow∣ledge such an husband her superiour? Answ. Yea verily: for in giuing her selfe to be his wife, and Wiues inferi∣our to those ouer whom they were be∣fore mariage. taking him to be her husband, she aduanceth him aboue her∣selfe, and subiecteth her selfe vnto him. It booteth nothing what either of them were before mariage: by vertue of the matrimoniall bond the husband is made the head of his wife, though the husband were before mariage a very begger, and of meane parentage, and the wife very wealthy and of a noble stocke; or though he were her prentise, or bondslaue; which also holdeth in the case betwixt an aged woman and a youth:
for the Scripture hath made no exception in any of those cases. 2. Obiect. But what if a man of lewd and beastly conditi∣ons, as a drunkard, a glutton, a profane swaggerer, an impi∣ous swearer, and blasphemer, be maried to a wife, sober, religi∣ous Matron, must she account him her superiour, and worthy of an husbands honour? Answ. Surely she must. For the euill qualitie and disposi∣tion Subiection due to hus∣bands of euill qualities. of his heart and life, doth not depriue a man of that ci∣uill honour which God hath giuen vnto him. Though an husband in regard of euill qualities may carrie the Image of the deuill, yet in regard of his place and office he beareth the mage of God: so doe Magistrates in the common-wealth, Ministers in the Church, parents and masters in the familie. Note for our present purpose, the exhortation of S. Peter to Christian wiues which had infidell husbands, 1 Pet 3. 1, 2. Be in subiecti∣on to them: let your conuersation be in feare. If Infidels carrie ot the deuils Image, and are not, so long as they are Infidels, assals of Satan, who are? yet wiues must be subiect to them, and feare them. §. 6. Of wiues denying honour to their owne husbands. Contrary thereunto is a very peruerse disposition in some A peruerse o∣pinion to thinke other husbands wor∣thy of ho∣nour, and not their owne. wiues, who thinke they could better subiect themselues to any husband, then their owne. Though in generall they acknow∣ledge that an husband is his wiues superiour, yet when the application commeth to themselues they faile, and cannot be brought to yeeld, that they are their husbands inferiours. This is a vice worse then the former. For to acknowledge no husband to be superiour ouer his wife, but to thinke man and wife in all things equall, may proceed from ignorance of hinde, and error of iudgement. But for a wife who knoweth and acknowledgeth the generall, that an husband is aboue his wife, to imagine that she her selfe is not inferiour to her hus∣band, ariseth from monstrous selfe-conceit, and intolerable rrogancy, as if she her selfe were aboue her owne sex, and ore then a woman. Contrary also is the practise of such See Treat. 2. part. 1. §. 9. women, as purposely ary men of farre lower ranke then themselues, for this very
end, that they may rule ouer their owne husbands: and of others who being See Ibid. aged, for that end mary youths, if not ve∣ry boyes. A minde and practise very vnseemely, and cleane¦th warting Gods ordinance. But let them thinke of ruling Indecens est vt mulier magistra viri fiat. Orig. in Isa. hom. 7. what they list, the truth is, that they make themselues subiects both by Gods law and mans: of which subiection such wiues doe oft feele the heauiest burden. Salomon noteth this to be one of the things for which the earth is disquieted, when Prou. 30. 21, 22. a seruant reigneth. Now when can a seruant more dominere, then when he hath maried his mistresse? As for aged women who are maried to youths, I may say (as in another case it was said) woe to thee ô wife whose husband is a childe. Vnmeet it is Eccle. 10. 16. that an aged man should be maried to a young maid, but much more vnmeet for an aged woman to be maried to a youth. §. 7. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 11 inward feare of her husband. Hitherto of a wiues acknowledgement of her husbands supe∣rioritie. It followeth to speake of that answerable respect which she ought to beare towards him. A wiue-like respect of her hus∣band consisteth in two points: 1. Reuerence. 2. Obedience.   The reuerence which she oweth to him is Wiue-like feare. 1. Inward. 2. Outward.   Inward reuerence is an awfull respect which a wife in her heart hath of her husband, esteeming him worthy of all ho∣nour for his place, and office sake, because he is her husband. Doubtlesse Sarah had in her heart a reuerend respect and ho∣nourable esteeme of her husband, when Gen. 18. 12. being alone, and thinking of him in her very thought she gaue him this title Lord. This inward reuerence the Scripture compriseth vnder this word Feare: as where our Apostle saith, Eph. 5. 33. . Let the wife see that she feare her husband: and where 1 Pet. 3. 2. . S. Peter exhorteth wiues to haue their conuersation in Feare. It is no slauish feare of her husband which ought to possesse the heart of a wife, dreading blowes, frownes, spightfull words, or the like; but such an awfull respect of him as maketh her (to vse the Apostles word) 1 Cor. 7. 34. care how she may please him. This wiue-like Feare is mani∣fested
by two effects: one is Ioy, when she giueth contentment to her husband, and obserueth him to be pleased with that which she doth: the other is griefe, when he is iustly offended and grieued, especially with any thing that she her selfe hath done. Vnlesse this inward reuerence and due respect of an hus∣band True feare a ground of other duties. be first placed in the heart of a wife, either no outward reuerence and obedience will be performed at all, or if it be performed, it will be very vnsound, only in shew, hypocriti∣call and deceitfull: so that as good neuer a whit as neuer the bet∣ter. For according to ones inward affection and disposition will the outward action and conuersation be framed. 2 Sam. 6. 16. Michal first despised Dauid in her heart, and thence it followed that she Uers. 20. How feare may be wrought in a wiues heart. vtteredmost vnreuerend and vile speeches of him, euen to his face. Wherefore after the iudgement of a wife is rightly informed of an husbands superioritie, and her will perswaded to account her owne husband her head and guide, it is very needfull that her heart and affection be accordingly seasoned with the salt of good respect, and high esteeme, which bree∣deth feare: and that thus her heart may be seasoned, she ought oft and seriously to meditate of his place and office, and of that honour which the Lord by vertue thereof hath planted in him. And if he haue gifts worthie his place, as knowledge, wisdome, pietie, temperance, loue, and the like, she ought to take notice thereof, and to thinke him worthie of double honour. §. 8. Of a wiues base esteeme of her husband. Contrary to this inward reuerence of the heart is a base and wile esteeme which many haue of their husbands, thinking no better of them then of other men; nay worse then of o∣thers; despising their husbands in their heart, like Michal, of whom we heard before. This, as it is in it selfe a vile vice, so is t a cause of many other vices, as of presumption, rebellion, A base esteem which wiues haue of their husbands, ariseth yea and of adultery it selfe many times: and it is also a maine hinderance of all dutie. It commonly riseth either from selfe-conceit (whereby wiues ouerweene their owne gifts, thinking them so excellent 1. From selfe∣conceit. is they need no guide or head, but are rather fit to guide and
rule both their husband and all the houshold: of which proud and presumptuous spirit Iezabel seemeth to be, who with an audacious and impudent face said to Ahab her husband, 1 King. 21. 7. Dost thou now gouerne the kingdome of Israel? Up, I will giue thee the vineyard of Naboth. So also all those wiues which are noted to draw away their husbands hearts from the Lord, as the wiues of 1 King. 11. 4. Salomon, 2 King. 8. 18. Iehoram, and others: which they learned of their great grandmother Gen. 3. 6. Euah:) or else from some infirmi∣ties of minde or body, or of life, which they behold in their 2. From their husbands in∣firmities. husbands (whence it commeth to passe, that many husbands who are highly honoured and greatly accounted of by others, are much despised by their wiues, because their wiues alwaies conuersing with them are priuie to such infirmities as are con∣cealed from others:) or, which is worst of all, from vniust sur∣mizes 3. From vniust suspicions. and suspicions, suspecting many euill things of their husbands whereof they are no way guiltie, and misinterpre∣ting, and peruerting things well done, as 2 Sam. 6. 20. Michal peruerted Dauids holy zeale. For redresse of this enormous vice, wiues ought first in re∣gard How wiues may redresse a light esteeme of their hus∣bands. of themselues to purge out of their hearts pride, and selfe-conceit, thinking humbly and lowly of themselues, and that euen in regard of their sex and the weaknesse thereof: and if the Lord haue endued them with any gift aboue the ordinary sort of women, to note well their owne infirmities, and to lay them by their eminent gifts: thus by looking on their blacke feet, their proud-peacock-feathers may be cast downe. Yea also when they behold any infirmities in their husbands, they ought to reflect their eies on their owne infirmities, which it may be are euen as many and as grieuous, if not more in num∣ber, and more hainous in their nature and kinde: at least let them consider that they are subiect to the same, if God leaue them to the sway of their owne corruption. Secondly, wiues ought in regard of their husbands to sur∣mize no euill whereof they haue not sure proofe and euidence: but rather interpret euery thing in better part: and follow the rule of loue, 1 Cor. 13. 7. which beareth all things, beleeueth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. If they note any defects of nature, and deformity of body, or any enormous and notorious vices
in their husband, then ought they to turne their eies and thoughts from his person to his place, and from his vicious qualities to his honourable office (which is to be an husband) and this will abate that vile esteeme which otherwise might be occasioned from the forenamed meanes. §. 9. Of Treat. 4. §. 4. wiue-like sobriety. A wiues outward reuerence towards her husband is a ma∣nifestation of her inward due respect of him. Now then see∣ing A wiues out∣ward reue∣rence. the intent of the heart, and inward disposition cannot be discerned by man simply in it selfe, that the husband may know his wiues good affection towards him, it is behouefull that she manifest the same by her outward reuerence. A wiues outward reuerence consisteth in her reuerend Gesture. Speech.   For the first, that a reuerend gesture & carriage of her selfe to A wiues re∣uerence in her gesture. her husband, and in her husbands presence, beseemeth a wife, was of old implied by the vaile which the woman vsed to put on, when she was brought vnto her husband, as is noted in the Gen. 24. 65. example of Rebekah: whereunto the Apostle alludeth in these words, 1 Cor. 11. 10. the woman ought to haue power on her head. That couer on the womans head, as in generall it implied subiection, so in particular this kinde of subiection, viz. a reue∣rend carriage and gesture. But most expresly is this dutie set downe by 1 Pet. 3. 1. . Saint Peter who exhorteth wiues to order their conuersation before their husbands, so as it be pure, with re∣uerence. This reuerend conuersation consisteth in a wiue-like sobrie∣tie, mildnesse, courtesie, and modestie. By sobriety I meane such a comely, graue, and gratious car∣riage, as giueth euidence to the husband that his wife respect∣eth his place & the authority which God hath giuen him. So∣briety in generall is required of all women by reason of their sexe; and surely it doth well become them all: but much more doth it become wiues: most of all, in their husbands presence. 1 Tim. 3. 11. The Apostle in particular enioyneth it to Deacons wiues, yet not so as proper vnto them, but in a further respect appertai∣ning to them not only as wiues, but as the wiues of Deacons. Contrary to this sobriety is lightnesse and wantonnesse:
which vices in a wife, especially before her husband, argueth little respect, if not a plaine contempt of him. Obiect. Thus shall all delightfull familiarity betwixt hus∣band and wife be taken away. Answ. Though the forenamed sobriety be opposed to light∣nesse Difference betwixt wan∣tonnesse and familiarity. and wantonnesse, yet not to matrimoniall familiarity: which is so farre permitted to man and wife, as if any other man and woman should so behaue themselues one towards another as an husband and wife lawfully may, it might iustly be counted lightnesse and sinne: instance the example of Isaak and Rebekah, who so sported together, as Abimelech, Gen. 26. 8, 9. knowing them to be such as feared God, gathered by that spor∣ting that they were man and wife: for he thought that other∣wise they would not haue beene so familiar together. See Treat. 4. §. 42. This familiarity argueth both liking and loue: and sheweth that the man and wife delight in one anothers person. But the lightnesse here condemned in a wife, is not so much a mutuall familiarity with her husband by his good liking, as a wanton dallying with others to his griefe and disgrace. §. 10. Of Treat. 4. §. 13, 22. wiue-like mildnesse. Mildnesse in a wife hath respect also to the ordering of her countenance, gesture, and whole cariage before her husband, whereby she manifesteth a pleasingnesse to him, and a conten∣tednesse and willingnesse to be vnder him and ruled by him. Excellently is this set forth in the spouse of Christ whose eies are said to be as doues eies, her lips to drop as honie combs, and Cant. 4. & 6. & 7. she her selfe euery way pleasant: whereupon it is noted that she appeared to her husband as the bright morning, and that his heart was wounded with her. Assuredly the cleere skie is not more pleasant in time of haruest, then a milde and amiable countenance and carriage of a wife in her husbands presence. Is cui leonum cura commissa est, blanda manu, mollique verborum sono permulsos do∣mat. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. And though her husband should be of an harsh and cruell dis∣position, yet by this means might he be made meeke and gen∣tle. For the keepers of Lions are said to bring them to some tamenesse by handling them gently and speaking to them fairely. Contrary to this mildnesse is a frowning brow, a lowring eie, a sullen looke, a powting lip, a swelling face, a deriding
mouth, a scornefull cast of the armes and hands, a disdainfull turning of this side and that side of the body, and a fretfull flinging out of her husbands presence: all which and other like contemptuous gestures are as thicke clouds ouerspreading the heauens in a Summers day, which make it very vncomfor∣table. They oft stirre vp much passion in the man, and bring much mischiefe vpon the wife her selfe. §. 11. Of Treat. 4. §. 15. wiue-like courtesie and obeysance. Courtesie is that vertue whereby a wife taketh occasion to testifie her acknowledgement of her husbands superiority by some outward obeysance to him. Rebekah, so soone as she saw Isaak, whom she had taken for her husband, lighted from her Camell and came to him on foot, which was a kinde of obey∣sance. This is not so to be taken as if no difference were to be made betwixt the carriage of a seruant, or childe, and a wife: or as if a wife should bow at euery word that she speaketh to her husband. Though in the kinde and extent of many duties the same things are required of wiues which are required of chil∣dren and seruants, because God hath made them all inferiours, and exacted subiection of all: yet in the manner and measure of many duties there is great difference: as in this, the obey∣sance of children and seruants ought to be more submissiue, and more frequent. Yet because God hath placed authority in the husband ouer his wife, she is euery way to testifie her reue∣rend respect of her husband, and therefore at some times, on some occasions (as when he is going on a iourney for a time from her, or when he returneth home againe, or when she hath a solemne and great sute to make vnto him, or when he offe∣reth an especiall and extraordinary fauour vnto her, or (as I haue obserued such wiues as know what beseemeth their place, and are not ashamed to manifest as much) when she sit∣teth 1. A wiue∣like courtesie worketh a good respect in her hus∣band to her. downe or riseth vp from table) to declare her reuerence by some obeysance. This cannot but much worke on the heart of a good and kinde husband, and make him the more to respect his wife, when he beholdeth this euidence of her re∣spect to him. Yea it cannot but be a good patterne to chil∣dren 2. It maketh her husband be honoured of others. and seruants, and a motiue to stirre them vp to yeeld all submissiue obeysance both to her husband and to her selfe.
For it may make them thus to reason with themselues, shall 3. It bringeth honour to her selfe. we scorne or thinke much to yeeld that to our father or ma∣ster which our mother or mistresse thinketh not much to yeeld to her husband? shall-she bow to him, and shall not we much more bow to her? Thus a wiues honouring of her husband by yeelding obeysance to him, maketh both him and her selfe to be more honoured of others. Contrarily minded are they, who not only altogether omit Contrary scorne in wiues. this dutie, but also gibe and scoffe at the very hearing thereof, saying, thus wiues shall be made no better then children or seruants. But though scornefull dames deride these outward euidences of their subiection, yet such wiues as feare the Lord ought not to be hindered thereby from doing their dutie: for by such euill examples they might be discouraged from euery good dutie. It is sufficient that such holy women as trusted in God so behaued themselues. But for this particu∣lar, we know that equals scorne not vpon occasions to per∣forme this kinde of courtesie in making obeysance one to ano∣ther: how much lesse ought wiues, who are their husbands inferiours? §. 12. Of Treat. 4. §. 49, 52. 1 Tim. 2 9. 1 Pet. 3. 3. wife-like modestie in apparell. Modestie appertaining to a wife is much manifested in her apparell. S. Paul requireth this modestie in generall of all sorts of women: but S. Peter presseth it in particular vpon wiues. For as it well beseemeth all women, so wiues after a peculiar manner, namely, in attiring themselues, to respect ra∣ther their husbands place and state, then their owne birth and parentage, but much rather then their owne minde and hu∣mour. A wiues modestie therefore requireth that her appa∣rell be neither for costlinesse aboue her husbands abilitie, nor for curiousnesse vn beseeming his calling. As a poore mans wife must not affect costly apparell, so neither Ministers, graue Counsellours, sage Magistrates, no nor conscionable Profes∣sours wiues, hunt after new fashions, or in light and garish ap∣parell attire themselues. It is a token of great reuerence in a wife towards her husband, to haue an eye to his place and state in her apparell. On the contrarie, such proud daines as must haue their
owne will in their attire, and thinke it nothing appertaineth Contrarie wiues attire not fitting their hus∣bands state or place. to their husbands to order them therein, who care not what their husbands abilitie, or what his place and calling be, they shew little respect and reuerence to their husbands. Such are they, who are no whit moued with their husbands example: but though the mans apparell be plaine and graue, yet the wiues shall be costly and garish. Yea many there be that stand in some more awe of their husbands sight, but shew little more respect vnto him, who haue their silken gownes, Beauer hats, and other like attire not agreeable to their place and state, lie in the countrey, if they be of the citie; or in the citie, if they be of the countrey, in a friends house where their husbands shall Quae se pingit comitque secus quàm viro gra∣tum esse nouit, satis declarat sese pluribus velle placcre quàm oportet mulierem pudi∣cam, cuius prae∣cipua laus est vni placuisse cui desponsata est. Erasm. Instit. Matr. not know it, and when their husbands are not with them, weare them, and paint their faces, lay out their haire, and in euerie thing follow the fashion. What can they which behold this thinke, but that such a wiues care is more to please other light vaine persons, then her graue, discreet husband: or that her husband can nothing at all preuaile with her: which as it staineth her owne credit, so it leaueth a blot of dishonour euen vpon him. If the care of a wife were to giue euidence of the re∣uerence which she beareth to her husband, his desire and ex∣ample would in this respect more preuaile with her, then the humour of her owne heart. §. 13. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 24. reuerend speech to her husband. As by gesture, so by speech also, must a wiues reuerence be manifested: this must be answerable to that. For by words as well as by deeds, the affection of the heart is manifested, Matt. 12. 34. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A wiues reue∣rence is manifested by her speech, both in her husbands pre∣sence, and also in his absence. For this end in his presence her words must be few, reuerend and meeke. First few: For the A wiues words in her hus∣bands pre∣sence must be few. Apostle enioyneth 1 Tim. 2. 12. silence to wiues in their husbands presence, and inforceth that dutie with a strong reason in these words: I permit not the woman to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to be in silence: the inference of the latter clause vpon the former sheweth that he speaketh not only of a womans silence in the Church, but also of a wiues silence before her husband: which is further cleared by another like place, where the same Apostle
enioyneth wiues to 1 Cor. 14. 35. learne of their husbands at home. The rea∣son before mentioned for silence, on the one side implieth a reuerend subiection, as on the other side too much speech im∣plieth an vsurpation of authoritie. Obiect. Then belike a wife must be alwayes mute before her husband. Answ. No such matter: for silence in that place is not op∣posed to speech, as if she should not speake at all, but to loqua∣citie, to talkatiuenesse, to ouer-much tatling: her husbands presence must some what restraine her tongue, and so will her verie silence testifie a reuerend respect. Otherwise silence, as it is opposed to speech, would imply stoutnesse of stomacke, and stubbornnesse of heart, which is an extreme contrarie to lo∣quacitie. But the meane betwixt both, is for a wife to be spa∣ring in speech, to expect a fit time and iust occasion of speech, to be willing to hearken to the word of knowledge comming out of her husbands mouth. This argueth reuerence. Iob 32. 6. Elihu manifested thereuerend respect, which as a younger he bare to his elders, by for bearing to speake while they had any thing to say. How much more ought wiues in regard both of their sex and of their place? Contrarie is their practise, who must and will haue all the Contrarie too much prate. prate. If their husbands haue begun to speake, their slipperie tongues cannot expect and tarrie till he haue done: if (as verie hastile and forward they are to speake) they preuent not their husbands, they will surely take the tale out of his mouth be∣fore he haue done: Thus-they disgrace themselues, and disho∣nour their husbands. §. 14. Of the Treat. 4. §. 24. titles which wiues giue their husbands. As their words must be few, so those few words must be re∣uerend and meeke: both which are also implied vnder the forenamed word 1 Tim. 2. 12. . silence: which in the originall signifieth also 1 Tim. 2. 12. . quietnesse. Reuerence hath respect to the titles whereby a wife nameth her husband. Meeknesse to the manner of framing her speech to him. Reuerend ti∣tles to be gi∣uen to hus∣bands. For the titles which a wife in speaking to her husband, or naming him, giueth vnto him, they must be such as signifie
superioritie, and so sauour of reuerence. Such are the titles wherewith husbands are named in the Scripture; See §. 3. they are ti∣tles of honour. Such also are the titles which the Church (who by our Apostle is made a patterne for wiues in all subiection) giueth to her Spouse Christ Iesus, as may be gathered out of the Song of songs. It is likely that Sarah did vsually giue this title Lord to her husband. For hauing occasion to thinke of him, presently this title Gen. 18. 12. Lord was in her heart: which would not so suddenly haue risen vp, if she had not ordinarily vsed it. According to the vsuall titles which we giue to any, doe we in our hearts name them, when we haue occasion to thinke of them. Among all other titles the name husband, as it is the most vsuall, so it is the fittest and meetest title. It intimateth re∣uerence, and sauoureth not of nicenesse & singularitie, as these titles, Head, Guide, Master, Man, and the like doe: which though they be lawfull titles, because the Scripture attributeth them to husbands, and they signifie superioritie, yet because they are vnusuall and sauour of singularitie, they are not so meet. Common vse and practise hath made the addition of the husbands surname to this title Master, more meet. 1 Pet. 3. 6. Saint Peter by this argument proueth that Sarah obeyed Abraham, because she called him Lord. Contrarie are those compellations which argue equalitie or inferioritie rather then superioritie, as Brother, Cosen, Friend, Man, &c. if a stranger be in presence, how can he tell by this manner of compellation, that he whom thou speakest vnto is thy husband? If he espie any matrimoniall familiaritie betwixt you, what can he iudge of it otherwise to be, lightnesse and wantonnesse? Remember the fearefull issue that had like to haue fallen out by reason of such compellations giuen by Gen. 12. 19. & 20. 2. Sarah and & 26. 9. Rebekah to their husbands. Not vnlike to those are such as these, Sweet, Sweeting, Heart, Sweet-heart, Loue, Ioy, Deare, &c. and such as these, Ducke, Chicke, Pigsnie, &c. and husbands Christian names, as Iohn, Thomas, William, Henry, &c. which if they be contracted (as many vse to contract them thus, Iack, Tom, Will, Hall) they are much more vnseemly: seruants are vsually so called. But what may we say of those titles giuen to an husband by
his wife, not seldome in passion, but vsually in ordinarie speech, which are not fit to be giuen to the basest men that be, as Grub, Rogue, and the like, which I am euen ashamed to name, but that the sins of women are to be cast as dirt on their faces, that they may be the more ashamed? Obiect. Many of the forenamed titles are titles of amitie and familiaritie. Answ. Subiection is that marke which wiues are directed to aime at in their thoughts, words, deeds, and whole conuersa¦tion towards their husband. Such tokens of familiaritie as are not withall tokens of subiection and reuerence, are vnbesee∣ming a wife, because they swerue from that marke. §. 15. Of wiues Treat. 4. §. 24. &c. meeknesse in their speeches. Meeknesse in a wiues manner of framing her speech to her husband, doth also commend her reuerend respect of him. This is an especiall effect of that meeke and quiet spirit which S. Peter requireth of wiues; which dutie he doth strongly in∣force by this weighty argument, 1 Pet. 3. 4. which is before God a thing much set by. Is a wiues meeknesse much set by before God, and shall not wiues hold it both a bounden dutie, and comely or∣nament, and grace vnto them? As the forme of words which a wife vseth in asking or answering questions, or any other kinde of discourse which shee holdeth with her husband, so her moderation in persisting, arguing and pressing matters, yea and the milde composition of her countenance in spea∣king, declare her meeknesse. If she be desirous to obtaine any thing of him, fairely she must intreat it, as the 2 King. 4. 10. 22. Shunemite: If she would moue him to performe a bounden dutie, mildly she must perswade him. If she would restraine and keepe him from doing that which is euill, euen that also she must doe with some meeknesse, as Matt. 27. 19. Pilats wife: If she haue occasion to tell him of a fault, therein she ought to manifest humilitie and reuerence, by obseruing a fit season, and doing it after a gentle manner as 2 Sam. 25. 31, 37. Abigail: who as she wisely behaued her selfe in this respect with her husband in obseruing a fit season, so also with Dauid by intimating his fault vnto him, rather then plainly reprouing him, when she said, It shall be no griefe nor offence vnto my Lord, that he hath not shed bloud causelesse. This
meeknesse requireth also silence and patience, euen when she is reproued. Contrary is the waspish and shrewish disposition of many Contrary wiues shrew∣ish speeches to their hus∣bands. wiues to their husbands, who care not how hastily and vnad∣uisedly they speake to them, like Gen. 30. 1. Rahel; nor how angerly and chidingly, like 1 King. 21. 7. Iezabel; nor how disdainfully, and spight∣fully, like Exo. 4. 25, 26. Zipporah; nor how scoffingly, and frumpingly, like 2 Sam. 6. 20. Michal; nor how reproachfully and disgracefully, like Iob 2. 9. Iobs wife. If they be reproued by their husbands, their husbands shall be reproached by them: & they are ready to answer again, not only word for word, but ten for one. Many wiues by their shrewish speeches, shew no more respect to their husbands, then to their seruants, if so much. The least occasion moueth them not only inwardly to be angry and fret against them, but also outwardly to manifest the same by chiding and brawling. The very obiect whereupon many wiues vsually spit out their venomous words, is their husband; when their stomacks are full, they must needs ease them on their husbands: wherein their fault is doubled. Let wiues therefore learne first to moderate their passion, and then to keepe in their tongues with bit and bridle, but most of all to take heed that their husbands taste not of the bitternesse thereof, no not though they should by some ouer∣sight of their husbands be prouoked. It is to be noted how Salomon calleth the iarres which are betweene man and wife, the contentions of a wife, whereby he intimateth that she com∣monly Prou. 19. 13. is the cause thereof, either by prouoking her husband, or not bearing with him. §. 16. Of a wiues speech of her husband Treat. 2. Part. 2. §. 36. in his absence. The reuerence which a wife beareth to her husband, must further be manifested by her speeches of him in his absence. So did Sarah manifest her reuerence, and so must all such as de∣sire Gen. 18. 12. to be accounted the daughters of Sarah. The Church speaking of her Spouse, doth it with as great reuerence, as if she Cant 5. 10. &c. had spoken to him. It was for honour and reuerence sake, that the Virgin Mary called Ioseph the Father of Iesus, when she Luke 2. 48. spake of him. This sheweth that a wiues reuerend speeches in presence of
her husband and to his face, are not in flatterie to please him and fawne vpon him, but in sinceritie to please God and per∣forme her dutie. Contrary therefore to their dutie deale they, who in pre∣sence Contrary wiues bitter speeches be∣hind their hus∣bands backs. can afford the fairest and meek est speeches that may be to their husbands face, but See more hereof Treat 2. part 2. §. 36. behinde their backs speake most re∣proachfully of them. §. 17. Of a wiues obedience in generall. Hitherto of a wiues reuerence, it followeth to speake of her obedience: The first law that euer was giuen to woman since her fall, laid vpon her this dutie of Obedience to her husband, in these words, Gen. 3. 16. Thy desire shall be to thine husband, and he shall rule ouer thee. How can an husband rule ouer a wife, if she obey not him? The principall part of that submission which in this Ephes. 5. 22. text, and in many other places is required of a wife, consisteth in obedience: and therefore it is expresly commen∣ded vnto wiues in the example of Sarah who 1 Pet. 3. 6. . obeyed Abra∣ham. Thus by Obedience doth the Church manifest her sub∣iection to Christ. The place wherein God hath set an husband; namely, to be an Ephes. 5. 23. head; the authoritie which he hath giuen vnto him, to be a 1 Pet. 3. 6. Lord and Ester 1. 17. Master; the duty which he requireth of him Gen. 3. 16. to rule, doe all require obedience of a wife. Is not obedience to be yeelded to an Head, Lord, and Master? Take away all authori∣tie from an husband, if ye exempt a wife from obedience. Contrary is the stoutnesse of such wiues as must haue their Contrary to obedience, stoutnesse. own will, and doe what they list, or else all shall be out of quiet. Their will must be done, they must rule and ouer-rule all, they must command not only children and seruants, but husbands also, if at least the husband will be at peace. Looke into fami∣lies, obserue the estate and condition of many of them, and then tell me if these things be not so. If an husband be a man of courage, and seeke to stand vpon his right, and maintaine his authoritie by requiring obedience of his wife, strange it is to behold what an hurly burly she will make in the house: but if he be a milke-sop, and basely yeeld vnto his wife, and suffer her to rule, then, it may be, there shall be some outward quiet. The ground hereof is an ambitious and proud humour in
women, who must needs rule, or else they thinke themselues slaues. But let them thinke as they list: assuredly herein they thwart Gods ordinance, peruert the order of nature, deface the image of Christ, ouerthrow the ground of all dutie, hinder the good of the family, become an ill patterne to children and seruants, lay themselues open to Satan, and incurre many other mischiefes which cannot but follow vpon the violating of this maine duty of Obedience, which if it be not performed, how can other duties be expected? §. 18. Of the cases wherein a wife hath power to order things of the house without her husbands consent. A wiues obedience requireth Submission. Contentment.   Submission in yeelding to her husbands minde and will. See §. 49. Contentment in resting satisfied and content with his estate and abilitie. That Submission consisteth in two things. First, in abstaining from doing things against her husbands minde. Secondly, in doing what her husband requireth. The for∣mer of these requireth that a wife haue her husbands consent for the things which she doth. For the better cleering whereof we are to consider, 1. What kinde of husbands they must be whose consent is required. 2. How many waies his consent may be giuen. 3. What are the things whereabout his consent is to be expected. For the first, as on the one side it oft falleth out that a wife, In two cases a wife hath pow∣er to order things of her selfe, without her husbands consent. prouident, and religious man is maried to a foolish woman, a very ideot, that hath no vnderstanding, of whom there can be no question, but that such a wife is to doe nothing of her selfe, and of her owne head, but altogether to be ordered by her husband: So on the other side, it oft falleth out that a wise, vertuous, and gratious woman, is maried to an husband de∣stitute 1 In case of her husbands impotency. of vnderstanding, to a very naturall (as we say) or a renzy man, or to one made very blockish, and stupid, vnfit to manage his affaires through some distemper, wound, or sick∣nesle.
In such a case the whole gouernment lieth vpon the wife, so as her husbands consent is not to be expected. Quest. What if the husband be a wicked and prophane man, and so blinded and stupified in his soule, doth not this spirituall blindnesse and blockishnese giue a religious wife as great libertie as naturall stupiditie? Answ. No verily: For S. Peter exhorteth faithfull wiues 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2. that were maried to Infidell husbands to be subiect to them, and that in feare. The reason is cleare: For spirituall blindnesse disableth not from ciuill gouernment: indeed nothing that such a man doth is acceptable to God, or auailable to his owne saluation; but yet it may be profitable to man: a wicked man may be proui∣dent enough for wife, children, and whole family in outward temporall things. Againe, it oft falleth out, that an husband is a long time In case of impossibilitie for her hus∣band to doe it. farre off absent from the house: sometimes by reason of his calling, as an Ambassadour, Souldier, or Mariner; sometimes also carelesly or wilfully neglecting house, goods, wife, chil∣dren and all: and in his absence hath left no order for the or∣dering of things at home: in this case also there is no questi∣on, but that the wife hath power to dispose matters without her husbands consent: prouided that she obserue those rules of Gods word concerning iustice, equitie, truth and mercie, which an husband in his disposing of them ought to obserue. The first of these cases declareth an impotencie in the hus∣band: the other an impossibilitie for him to order matters: wherefore the wife being next to the husband, the power of ordering things is diuolued on her: she is not bound to haue his consent. §. 19. Of diuers kindes of consent. II. A consent may be generall or particular. A generall 1. A generall consent. consent is giuen, when without distinct respect to this or that particular, libertie is granted to a wife by her husband to doe all things as seemeth good in her owne eyes. Prou. 31. 10, &c. That excellent good wife, and notable good house-wife that is set forth by the Wise-man, had such a consent. For first, it is said, Vers. 11. The heart of her husband trusteth in her; and then it is inferred, that
she ordereth all the things of the house, whereof many particu∣lars are there specified. Whence I gather, that her husband obser∣uing her to be a godly, wise, faithfull, and industrious woman, gaue her power and liberty to doe in the house-hold affaires, what she thought good, (he being a publike magistrate, for Vers. 23. he was knowne in the gates, sitting among the Elders of the land) and ac∣cordingly she vsed her liberty. A particular consent is that which is giuen to one or more par∣ticular 2. A particu∣lar consent. things, as that consent Gen. 16. 6. which Abraham gaue to Sarah about Hagar; and 1 Sam 1. 23. that which Elkanah gaue to Hanna about tarrying at home till her childe was weined. This particular consent may be expressed or implied. An ex∣pressed consent is when the husband manifesteth his good liking by word, writing, message, or signe, and that whether his con∣sent be asked (as was noted in the example of Elkanah) or freely offered. An implicit consent, when by any probable coniecture it may be gathered that the husbands will is not against such a thing, 4. An impli∣cit consent, though he haue not manifested his minde concerning that very particular. This implicit consent may be gathered either by his silence when he is present to see a thing done, or otherwise hath knowledge thereof: or else when he is absent, by his former ca∣riage or disposition in other like cases. The Scripture accounteth an husbands silence, when he knoweth a thing and may, but doth not forbid it, to be a consent: as Num 30. 8. in the case of a wiues vow. For any thing we read to the contrary 2 King. 4. 10, 23. the Shunemite had no other consent to prepare a chamber for the Prophet, and to goe vnto him, then her husbands silence, and not forbidding it when he knew it. As for the other kinde of implicit consent, it may be set forth in this following instance: suppose a good wife hath an husband whom she knoweth by his former cariage and disposition to be a pittifull and charitable man, taking all occasions to shew mercy, and in his absence there falleth out a fit and needfull occasion of shewing mercy; if she take that occasion to shew mercy, she hath an implicit consent, for she may well thinke that if her husband knew it he would approue what she doth. It is to be supposed that 1 Sam. 1. 11. Annah vpon some such ground vowed her childe to God.
For it is not likely that she who would not tarry at home to weine her childe without her husbands consent, would much lesse vow him to the Lord (which was a farre greater matter) without some perswasion of her husbands good liking there∣of. Now that a wife may shew she dealeth vprightly in this case vpon a true perswasion of her heart concerning her husbands minde, she ought (when conueniently she can) to make known to her husband what she hath done: as without all question Annah did; and so much may be gathered out of these words which Elkanah vttered to Annah, 1 Sam. 1. 23. the Lord establish his word. §. 20. Of the things whereabout a wife must haue her hus∣bands consent. The things whereabout an husbands consent is to be ex∣pected, are such as he by vertue of his place and authoritie hath power to order: as for example, ordering and disposing the goods, cattell, seruants, and children of the family, entertai∣ning strangers; yea, also ordering euen his wiues going abroad, and making of vowes, with the like: now then distinctly to lay downe a wiues dutie in this first branch of obedience, it is this: A wife must doe nothing which appertaineth to her husband authoritie simply without, or directly against his consent. Doe not these words of that old law (thy desire shall be to thy husband) Gen. 3. 16. imply as much? I deny not but that there may be sundry things proper and peculiar to a wife, wherein I will not re∣straine her libertie: and therefore I vse this phrase (which ap∣pertaineth to her husbands authoritie.) And I grant the fore∣named generall and implicit consent, to be a true consent, so as there needeth not an expresse particular consent for euery thing, and therefore I haue added these clauses (simply without, or directly against consent.) That is done simply without consent which is done without all warrant from the husband, and that so couertly as she is afraid it should come to his notice, imagining he would by no meanes like it: As Rahels taking her fathers idols without all Gen. 31. 32. consent of Iaakob. That is done directly against consent which is expresly for∣bidden and disclaimed by the husband.
But to descend to the particulars before mentioned: First concerning the goods of the family: It is a question contro∣uerted whether the wife haue power to dispose them without or against the husbands consent. Before I determine the question, I thinke it needfull to declare, 1. What goods, 2. What occasion of giuing the question is about. §. 21. Of the things which a wife may dispose without her husbands consent. 1. For the goods, some are proper and peculiar to the wife: Quaedam bona sunt propria vxoris, vt sunt bona parapher∣nalia. Greg. Sayr. Clau. reg. l. 9. c. 16. others are common. Goods proper to the wife are such as be∣fore mariage she her selfe, or her friends except from the hus∣band to her sole and proper vse and disposing, whereunto he also yeeldeth: or such as after mariage he giueth vnto her to dispose as she please: suppose it be some rent, annuity, fees, ailes, or the like. These kindes of goods are exempted out of the question  bona apud iu∣risconsultos, dicuntur  (i.) quae sponsa praeter dotem à parentibus pactam secum fert: vel (vt Sayrus loc. citat.) habet le∣gata ei, seu do∣nata. in hand; the wife hath liberty to dispose them as she please without any further consent then she had by vertue of her hausbands former grant. To these I may referre other goods, but of another nature, namely such as some friend of hers, suppose father, mother, brother, or any other, obseruing her husband to be a very ard man, not allowing sufficient for her selfe, much lesse to distribute on charitable vses, shall giue vnto her to dispose as e please, charging her not to let her husband know thereof. How because it is in the power of a free doner to order his ift as he please, and because he so ordereth this gift as he will not haue her husband know of it, I doubt not but she may of her selfe according to the doners minde without her hus∣bands consent, dispose such goods. She is herein but as a offee in trust. Againe of common goods some are set forth by the hus∣band to be spent about the family, other he reserueth for a ocke, or to lay forth as he himselfe shall see occasion. Concerning those which are set forth to be spent, I doubt ot but the wife hath power to dispose them; neither is she ound to aske any further consent of her husband. For it
is the wiues place and dutie to guide or gouerne the house, 1 Tim. 5. 14. . by vertue whereof, prouiding sufficiently for the family, she may, as she seeth good occasion, of such goods as are set apart to be spent, distribute to poore, or otherwise. This I haue noted for such tender consciences as thinke they cannot giue a bit of bread, or scarp of meat to a poore body, or make a messe of broth or caudle for a sicke body, ex∣cept they first aske their husbands consent. Prouided that if her husband expresly forbid this liberty, she take it not except necessity require it. But our question is concerning such goods as the husband hath not set apart, but reserued to his owne disposing. §. 22. Of a wiues liberty in extraordinary matters. II. For the occasion of disposing goods it may be ordinary or extraordinary. Extraordinary for the good of the husband himselfe, and others in the family, or such as are out of the fa∣mily. If there fall out an extraordinary occasion whereby the wife by disposing the goods without or against the con∣sent of her husband may bring a great good to the family, or preuent and keepe a great mischiefe from it, she is not to stay for his consent; instance the example of 1 Sam. 25. 18. &c. Abigail. Thus a faithfull prouident wife obseruing her husband to riot, and to spend all he can get in carding, dicing, and drinking, may without his consent lay vp what goods she can for her husbands, her own, her childrens, and whole housholds good. This is no part of disobedience, but a point wherein she may shew her selfe a great good helpe vnto her husband; Gen. 2. 18. for which end a wife was first made. Concerning such as are out of the family, if they be in great need, and require present releefe, though the wife know her husband to be so hard-hearted, as he will not suffer her to re∣leeue such an one, yet without his consent she may releeue him. The ground of this and other like cases is that rule laid downe by the Prophets, and by Christ himselfe, viz. Ose. 6. 6. Mat 9. 13. & 12. 7. I will haue mercie and not sacrifice. If God in case of mercie dis∣penseth with a dutie due to himselfe, will he not much more dispense with a dutie due to an husband?
§. 23. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 54. restraint in disposing goods without consent of her husband: and of the ground of that restraint. Out of all these things thus premised I gather the true state Non potest vxor ex bonis communibus occulte accipere ad donandum vel ad erogan∣dum in alios vsus sine ex∣pressa, aut prae∣sumpta saltem viri licentia. Gre. Sayr. loc. citat. of the question in controuersie concerning the power of wiues in disposing the goods of the family to be this, Whether a wife may priuily and simply without, or openly and directly against her husbands consent distribute such common goods of the family as her husband reserueth to his owne disposing, there being no extraordinary necessity? The most ancient and common answer vnto this question hath beene negatiue, namely, that a wife hath not power so to doe: whereunto I for my part subscribe. The ground of this answer is taken from that primary law of the wiues subiection, Gen. 3. 16. Thy desire shall be vnto thine husband. How is her desire subiect to her husband, if in the case pro∣pounded she stand not vpon his consent? It is further con∣firmed both by the §. 17. forenamed, and also by all other proofes that might be produced out of the Scripture concerning the subiection of wiues vnto their husbands. If in ordering the goods of the family she yeeld not subiection, wherein shall she yeeld it? Against this ground-worke some obiect that Gen. 4. 7. the same law of subiection is imposed vpon a younger brother in the very same words, and yet a younger brother was not therby bound How the law of subiection is applied to younger bro∣thers. to haue his elder brothers consent in disposing his goods. Answ. The law of the regality (as I may so speake) and preheminency of the first borne was vnder those words ordai∣ned: and therfore a younger brother was made a subiect to his elder, while he remained in the family, as a sonne to the fa∣ther. The elder brother was as a lord ouer his other bro∣thers: whereupon when Isaak conferred the right of the first borne vpon Iaakob (thinking he had beene his eldest sonne Esau) he vsed these words, Be lord ouer thy brethren, and let thy Gen. 27. 29. mothers sonnes bow downe to thee. Which being so, questionlesse the younger brother might not simply without or directly against the elder brothers consent dispose the goods of the family: so as this obiection more strongly establisheth the fore∣named argument.
Againe it is obiected that that old law is to be expounded of weighty matters. Answ. The Apostle who was guided by the spirit of the Eph. 5. 24. law-maker, extendeth that law to euery thing: But is not this matter of disposing goods a weighty matter? The conse∣quences which I shall by and by note to follow hereupon will shew it to be a matter of moment. §. 24. Of the example of the Shunemite in asking her hus∣bands consent. 2 King. 4. 9, 22. As another reason may be alleged the Shunemites patterne who asked her husbands consent before she prepared the things that were thought meet for the Prophets entertain∣ment: and before she vsed the things which were meet for her iourney. Obiect. It is indeed commendable for wiues to seeke their husbands consent as she did, but where such consent cannot be had, it is not necessary. Answ. This example being grounded vpon a law (as we shewed §. 23. before) it doth not only declare what may be done, but also what ought to be done. And if a wife be bound to haue her husbands consent for doing of a thing, by consequence it followeth that she is bound from doing it, without her hus∣bands consent. 2. Answ. They that except against this reason taken from example, vse themselues the like reason in other points, as the examples of Abigail, Ioanna, and Susanna for the con∣trarie. 2. Obiect. In the Shunemites example there was more then a mercifull releefe of the Prophet, namely bringing him into the house to diet and to lodge, wherein the husband must haue a chiefe stroake. Answ. The word of God maketh not that difference be∣twixt releeuing and entertaining: it extendeth a wiues sub∣iection to euery thing: wherefore the husband hath a chiefe stroake as well in the one, as in the other. §. 25. Of the law of a wiues vow. A third reason is taken from the law of a wiues vow: where∣by Num. 30. 7. &c. in generall is implied, that a wife might not make a vow
without her husbands consent: whence it followeth as an ar∣gument taken from the greater to the lesse, that she may not dispose the goods without his consent. Yea, Vers. 13. the Law further expresly saith, that though she hath vowed, yet her husband hath power to disanull her vow. Note here, how the Lord will rather depart from his owne right (as I may so speake) then haue that order which he hath appointed betwixt man and woman broken. The Lords right, was to haue what was vowed to him performed: the order which he appointed, was to haue the wife subiect to her husband: rather then the wife should doe that which the husband would not haue done, the Lord remitted a wiues vow in case her husband would not con∣sent to haue it performed. Now then I demand, is the dispo∣sing of goods a greater matter then the performing of a vow? or hath a wife in these dayes more libertie then in former? if she haue, by what law? was there euer vnder the Law a straiter charge laid vpon wiues then this, Let wiues be subiect to their husbands in euerie thing. Obiect. That point of a womans subiection in performing her vow, is a particular ruled case: but not this of disposing goods. Answ. The Scripture by particular Lawes and examples teacheth directions for other cases like to them: and argu∣ments drawne by iust and necessarie consequence, are counted as sound as expresse testimonies. Whereas it is said, that this particular in question is not expresly decided, I take the reason thereof to be this, that in former times they so well marked the extent of the generall law of a wiues subiection, as they made no question of doing this or other like things without their husbands consent. Neither did good wiues take that libertie, neither had they any patrons of such libertie. 2. Obiect. The case of a wiues disposing goods is vnlike to that of vowes, because vowes are voluntarie, but disposing goods, as a worke of mercie, is necessarie. Answ. Though it were a voluntarie thing to make, or not to make a vow: yet a vow being made, it was not in the power of the partie that made it, not to performe it: it was a Num. 30. 3. Deut. 23. 21. Eccles. 5. 4. necessa∣rie dutie to performe a vow, euen expresly commanded. As
for the pretended worke of mercie, I will §. 34. hereafter shew, that a wife is not necessarily tied thereunto. §. 26. Of humane lawes which restraine wiues from disposing goods, without or against their husbands consent. A fourth is taken from the lawes of men whereunto we are subiect, and which we must obey euen for conscience sake, so farre as they thwart not Gods Law, which in this case they doe not, as the reasons before gathered out of Gods word doe shew. Now our Law saith, that 45. E. 3. Fitz. Couen. 18. euerie gift, grant, or disposition of goods, lands, or other thing whatsoeuer made by a woman 1. H. 5. 12. b. Perk. cap. de Grant. Nat. Breu. fol. 120. G. couert, and all and euerie obligation and feoffment made by her, and recouerie suffered, if they be done without her hus∣bands consent, are void. Yea, Nat. Breu. fol. 188. H. if she doe wrong to another, she hath not any thing to make satisfaction during couerture: either her husband must doe it, or by imprisonment of her person must it be done. And Perk. fol. 2. a. though she haue inheritance of her owne, yet can she not grant any annuitie out of it during her couerture, without her husband: if any deed be made to that purpose without his consent, or in her name alone, it is void in law. Yea, Perk. fol. 2. b. if there be debate betweene the husband and his wife, whereby certaine lands of the husbands be assig∣ned to the wife with his consent, if out of such lands she grant an annuitie to a stranger, the grant is void. And 27. H. 8. 27. p. 12. if he coue∣nant to giue her yeerely such and such apparell, she cannot dis∣pose it as she list without his consent, but only vse and weare it her selfe. Perk. fol. 3. a. Neither can she lease her owne land for yeeres, for life, &c. if she doe, it is void, and the Lessee entring by force thereof, is a Disseisor to the husband, and Trespassor. And 21. H. 7. 18. p. 29. Nat. Breu. fol. 120 G. if she sell any thing, the sale is void, except she be a merchant, where by the custome she is enabled to merchandize. Finally, Ognels case, Coke Rep. 4. 3  3. Deu. 12. she cannot make executors without the consent of her hus∣band, nor a deuise, or will. Plowd. Com 344. a. Bret and Rig∣dons case. If she make a will, and thereby de∣uise her owne inheritance, and her husband die, and she after die without any new publication of it, it is of no force, because it was void at first. These and many other like cases which might be alleaged euidently shew that by law a wife hath not
power of her selfe, without her husband, to dispose the com∣mon goods of the familie. §. 27. Of the inconueniences which may follow vpon a wiues disposing goods without or against her husbands con∣sent. A fit reason may be taken from the mischiefes which would 1. A mans e∣state may be wasted before he can tell how to re∣dresse it. fall out if this liberty were giuen vnto women: which are these that follow: 1. The estate of the family might be wasted before any re∣dresse could be thought of: for if the wife may dispose the goods without her husbands consent, it must also be granted without his knowledge: for it is to be supposed that if he knew of the disposing of that which he liketh not, he would hinder it: if without his knowledge, then may that which he thinketh to be remaining as a stocke for the family, be laid out by the wife, and nothing left: whereas if he knew of the spend∣ing of that stocke, it might be he would be more thrifty and sparing in other expences. Obiect. This liberty is not granted to wiues beyond their husbands ability. Answ. Wiues cannot alwaies know their husbands ability: for their husbands may be much indebted, and yet to main∣taine his credit, whereby he hopeth to raise his estate, may al∣low liberall maintenance for his house, if thereupon his wife shall gather that he is very rich, and accordingly be very boun∣tifull in her gifts, she may soone goe beyond his ability, and so increase his debt, as he shall neuer be able to recouer himselfe. 2. Persons of contrary religions and dispositions being 2. Professors of contrarie religions may be sustained by the goods of the same family. out of the family, might be maintained by the goods of the same family: for if the husband were of one religion, and the wife of another, he without her knowledge might maintaine those of his religion, and she without his knowledge might maintaine them of her religion. Obiect. This liberty of disposing goods giuen to the wife is limited within the bounds of the houshold of faith. Answ. If Diuines grant them this liberty, they will them∣selues iudge and determine who be of the houshold of faith:
Popish wiues will say (say we what we can to the contrary) that Iesuites, Priests, and Friers, are of the houshold of faith, principall members thereof. 3. Many iarres and contentions would thence arise betwixt 3. Iars would arise betwixt man and wife. husband and wife: for if a wife shall persist to doe that which her husband will not consent vnto, assuredly one of a thousand will not well brooke it, but will rather seeke all the wayes he can to crosse her; thinking himselfe despised, if she, whether he will or no, haue her minde. Obiect. Wiues must vse this libertie with all due respect vn∣to their husbands authoritie. Answ. If the husband peremptorily stand vpon his au∣thoritie, and by all the faire meanes that can be vsed, will not yeeld this libertie, I know not what better respect she can shew to this authoritie, then to forbeare and abstaine from doing that which otherwise she would most gladly doe: But if when it commeth to the vttermost point, and she shall say it is her right, and if she cannot haue his consent, she will doe it with∣out his consent, she therein sheweth no great respect. Many other inconueniences might be reckoned vp, but I will not longer insist on them, only from these let it be well con∣sidered, whether it were not better for a familie, that the hus∣band should be bard from disposing the goods without consent of his wife (so as there might be according to the prouerbe, but Though she had a proprie∣tie, yet hath she not there∣upon libertie to dispose the goods. one hand in the purse) then both husband and wife to haue libertie to dispose them without each others consent. §. 28. Of propertie in goods, whether it giue libertie to dispose them as a wife will. To iustifie a wiues libertie in disposing the common goods Licet vxor pro∣prietatem ha∣beat, admini∣strationem ta∣men, & vsum. fructū bonorum viuente marito non habet. Greg. Sayr. clau. reg. lib. 9. cap. 16. of the family without her husbands consent, it is said, that she hath a true right and propertie in those goods. 1. Answ. Though it were granted that a wife hath a true property in the goods, yet this conclusion would not follow thereupon, that she hath power of her selfe to dispose the goods without her husbands consent: for the authoritie which God hath giuen an husband, and subiection which he hath laid on a wife, restraine her power and libertie in that
which is her owne: as for example, suppose See Doctr. & stud. fol. 13. that a woman at the time of her mariage haue a lease for yeeres, or the ward∣ship of the body and lands of an infant, or haue it by gift or Perk. plito. 560. 26. H. 8. 7. p. 1. Plowd. com∣ment. 418. b. purchase after mariage, she cannot giue it away whatsoeuer the extremitie be: but her husband may any time during couer∣ture, dispose of it: and such his disposition shall cut off the wiues interest. Or suppose that the only childe of her father be an inheretrix of land, and haue in her selfe (her father be∣ing dead) the full possession thereof: or that a widow haue the right vnto, and possession of her husbands estate, and thus possessed be maried to an husband, hath she being a wife liberty to dispose that estate which she brought with her with∣out or against her husbands consent? I thinke none will say it. Sure I am that what she giueth, lendeth, selleth, or otherwise disposeth without his consent, he if he will, may for his life∣time recouer againe: and yet no man will denie but that she hath the truest interest and propertie in the forenamed lands and inheritance. Obiect. May she not as well dispose of her owne inheri∣tance, as of those goods, or reuenues which her husband gi∣ueth her? Answ. No, for the gift of the husband is a generall con∣sent of his for her to dispose that which is giuen her as she seeth meet. §. 29. Of the reasons against a wiues propertie in the common goods of the family. 2. Answ. It may safely be denied that a wife hath a proper∣tie in the common goods of the family whereof she is no heire, for property in goods is a ciuill matter, and to be limited ac∣cording to the law of man vnder which we liue. Where the law, or custome of the place, make all the children coheires, all haue an equall right to their seuerall parts: where the eldest only is made heire, he hath a right to all: where the youngest only is made heire, he hath a right to all: but neither the law of nations, nor of the land where we liue giue the wife a pro∣perty. 12. H. 7. 22. Coke rep. 5. fo. 36. 28. H. 6. Dier fol. 6. plito. 5 Doct. & stud. fo. 13. Plowd. Comment. Bracebriges Case. By the common law mariage is a gift of all the goods and chattels personall of the wife to her husband, so that no kinde of propertie in the same remaineth in her. 4. H. 6. 31. And all
personall goods and chattels during mariage giuen to the wife are presently ipso facto transferred (as to the property of them) to the husband. So that by our law she is so farre from gaining any property by her mariage in her husbands goods, as she loseth all the property she formerly had in her owne goods. Yea 18. E. 4. 11. p. 4 her necessary apparell is not hers in property. While she remaineth a wife she is (to vse the law-phrase) vnder couert baron. See §. 26. She can neither let, sell, alien, giue, nor otherwise of right make any thing away, no nor yet make a will so to dis∣pose any goods while her husband liueth without his con∣sent: which yet an husband may while his wife liueth, and that without or against her consent. Obiect. The law states a wife in a great part of the husbands goods, prouiding for her iointer or thirds which the husband cannot make away without her consent. Answ. This prouision is only for the time of her widowhood in case she ouerliue him: but for the time that she remaineth his wife he may make away all, and she can recouer none, till he be dead. Obiect. This restraint of wiues is only in the court of men. Answ. Seeing it is not against the law of God, it must also hold good in the court of Conscience. Nay it is agreeable to the law of God and grounded thereupon. For (to omit the proofes before alleaged) what might be the reason that the daughters of Zelophehad, who were heires to their father, were forbidden to mary out of their fathers tribe, and that a law was made that no daughters that posses∣sed any inheritance should mary out of their fathers tribe, but because all that a woman had before mariage, passed vpon the husband and became his by vertue of mariage? This also for that purpose is by some not vnfitly, nor without probabilitie noted, that it is the common phrase of Scripture to terme hus∣bands Si quis abduxe∣rit vxorem cum bonis familiae dicitur abducere vxorem cum bonis viri. Fitzherb. Nat. breutum fol. 89. (but not wiues) rich, implying thereby that riches by a property appertaine to husbands: yea vsually in Scripture goods and lands are said to be the husbands. Obiect. The wiues of Iaakob doe terme the goods which their husbands had theirs, saying, the riches which God hath taken from our Father is OVRS, Gen. 31. 16.
Answ. They vse the word Ours in opposition to their fa∣thers house, and in relation not to their persons, but to their Ut vinum tem∣peratum licet maiori ex parte aquae constat, vinum appella∣mus: sic census quamuis plus contribuerit vxor, nuncu∣pandus viri est. Plut. in praec. connub. husbands family, and therefore they adde and our childrens: So as by that place no greater right can be proued for wiues, then for children. When the holy Ghost speaketh of the same goods, he saith not in relation to husband and wiues both, their flockes, their substance, but only in relation to the hus∣band, his flockes, his substance. For as in mixture of wine and water, though the greater quantitie be water, yet we call the whole, wine: so in the common goods of the family, though the wife should bring the greater part, we call all the husbands. §. 30. Of answers to the reasons for a wiues property. To proue a wiues property in the common goods of the family the reasons following are alledged. 1. Obiect. Mariage giuing a wife right of her husbands bo∣dy, Cor. 7. 4. doth much more of his goods. Answ. I denie the consequence. For the vse of the body is a proper act of the matrimoniall bond, wherein the difference betwixt superioritie and subiection appeareth not: the wife hath as great a power ouer the husbands body as the husband ouer the wiues: which is not so in the goods: no one thing can be named, wherein the power and authoritie of the husband more consisteth, then in the goods. 2. Obiect. In the forme of mariage the man saith to his wife, with all my worldly goods I thee indow. Answ. 1. Those words are to be taken of the vse of his goods, and not of a property in them. 2. If an husband shall intend a property by them, that property which she hath thereby, she hath not by vertue of the generall law of mariage, but of his particualar free do∣nation. 3. In all countries those words are not vsed in the forme of mariage. If those words giue the wife her property, then such wiues as are maried without those words vsed, haue no pro∣perty: so as this cannot be a generall ground of liberty for all wiues. 3. Obiect. A wife hath as good an estate in her husbands
goods as the Church in Christs bloud: but there the Church hath a property. Answ. Neither of those points can be proued. But if a wiues right in her husbands goods be as the Churches in Christs bloud, what is gotten thereby? The Church hath not power without or against Christs consent to dispose his bloud: The Church of Rome is counted a proud vsurping strumpet for taking vpon her so to doe. §. 31. Of the priuiledges of wiues aboue Children and seruants in and about the goods of the familie. Quest. Where then is the preferment of the wife aboue ser∣uants and children, if she haue not a property? I answer, Much euery manner of way. 1. Treat. 4. §. 52. 54. There is due to her a more free and plentifull vse of all the goods, then vnto them. 2. By her place she hath the ordering and disposing of the goods allotted for the common vse of the familie: as was §. 21. before granted. 3. Her husband ought to giue her a portion to dispose as she shall see good, Treat. 4. §. 54. as we shall after shew, when we come to the husbands duties. 4. She is a ioint gouernour with her husband ouer the children and seruants, as was shewed §. 4. before. Againe I answer, that this argument might as well be al∣ledged against that feare, subiection, and obedience which the Scripture expresly requireth of wiues, and it might be de∣manded, if wiues must feare and obey their husbands and be subiect vnto them, where is their preferment aboue their chil∣dren and seruants. But §. 11. it hath beene shewed that though the same things for matter be required of wiues which are requi∣red of children and seruants, yet there is a great difference in the manner of performing them. §. 32. Of examples and other reasons alleadged for libertie of wiues to dispose goods. 2. Abigails example is alleadged for a wiues libertie: and 2. Reason. Examples. 1 Sam. 25. 18. &c. Pro. 31. 11, &c. the example of the good house wife described by Salomon. Answ. 1. Abigails example was extraordinary; besides, who can tell whether the heart of her husband so trusted not in her
as he referred the whole gouernment of the house to her, and so she had a generall consent for what she did. 2. It is cleere that the other good-wife had her husbands consent for what she did: for besides that it is said the heart of her husband trusted in her, it is also said, that he praised her. Therefore he was neither ignorant of that which shee did, nor vnwilling she should doe it: it was neither without nor against his consent. 3. It is alleadged that wiues haue as great a care in getting 3. Reason. Wiues haue a like care in getting goods. goods, or in preseruing them for the good of the familie: therefore it is iust and equall, that they should haue a like power in disposing them. Answ. Though question may be made of the former part, at least for the greater sort and number of wiues, yet for answer to this reason I need not question it; for the consequence doth not follow, though that be granted. The right of disposing goods doth not simply rise from the care and paines of get∣ting and preseruing them: but from that order that the Lord hath beene pleased to set downe. A wise and industrious childe may be a meanes to raise and increase his fathers estate, when his father taketh little care and paines about it: yea a faithfull and wise steward or other seruant (as Iaakob and Io∣seph were) may doe much more by his paines and care in get∣ting and preseruing the goods of the familie, then his master: yet will it not thereupon follow, that such a childe, or such a seruant hath as great a right and power to dispose such goods as his father or his master. 4. The neere coniunction betwixt man and wife is allea∣ged: 4. Reason. Wiues are yoak-fellowes with their husbands. they are said to be yoake-fellowes, and thence is inferred that they haue a like power in disposing goods. Answ. They are yoak-fellowes in mutuall familiaritie, not in equall authoritie; and in relation to others as children and seruants, not in opposition each to other. In this respect she is subiect, not equall. If therefore he will one thing, and she another, she may not thinke to haue an equall right and power, she must giue place and yeeld.
§. 33. Of the Treat. 4. §. 54. subiection of wiues in distributing goods to charitable vses. Some that grant that a wife is so subiected to her husband in a ciuill manner, as she may not dispose any part of his goods at her pleasure to any ciuill vse, denie this subiecti∣on to extend to giuing of almes, and such like charitable vses. Before I come to determine this question, let it be remem∣bred, that it was before granted, that § 22. ordinarie dutie must giue place to extraordinarie need, so that releefe in present necessitie is not controuerted. Let it be also remembred that §. 21. a wife may haue goods proper to her selfe, yea Treat. 4. §. 54. it shall be shewed that an husband ought according to his abilitie to commit something to her discretion and disposition: of these and such like goods she is as much bound as her husband to expend something to charitable vses: and (as God offe∣reth occasion) Pro. 31. 20. to reach forth her hand to the poore and needy. Yea further let this be premised, that in case a wife be for∣bidden or restrained by her husband, she ought to vse all the good meanes she can by her selfe and her friends to moue her husband to grant her some libertie, that she may haue some triall of her mercifull and charitable disposition: if herein she cannot preuaile, then she ought to make knowne vnto her husband such persons cases as she thinkes meet to be relee∣ued, and vse all the motiues she can to perswade him to afford them some releefe. But put the case a wise, religious, mercifull wife, be maried State of question. to a couetous worldling, who though he haue wit, and vnder∣standing enough to manage ciuill affaires, and to prouide for the outward temporall estate of the house, yet hath no heart to releeue the poore, and is not only vnwilling himselfe to doe good in that kinde, but will not suffer his wife to doe it, whether may a wife priuilie take of such goods as he hath re∣serued to his owne disposing, and simply without any kinde of consent distribute them to charitable vses, or though he expresly forbid her, yet directly against his consent dis∣pose them?
With reuerend respect to better iudgements, I thinke she may Non excusbit bona intentio vxoris, etiamsi ea acciperet ad eleemosynam fa∣ciendam. Greg. Sayr. clav. reg. lib. 9. cap. 16. not (except before excepted.) For it being before proued in ge∣nerall, that she had no such liberty in disposing goods, I cannot see how this particular end of giuing almes can dispence with her generall subiection in euery thing, except there were some particular warrant for it in Gods word. §. 34. Of generall exhortations to works of mercy. How far they binde wiues. Obiect. The many generall exhortations vnto workes of mer∣cy, which without limitation to any particular persons, are inde∣finitely directed to all, doe giue sufficient warrant to wiues: such as these, Luke 11. 41. Giue almes. Gal. 6. 10. Let vs doe good. Heb. 13. 16. To distribute forget not, &c. Answ. All these are strong motiues to prouoke wiues to be mercifull and charitable in such things as they may, by any means with their husbands consent, or in such things as by their hus∣bands are giuen to them. Yea also they are strong motiues to pro∣uoke husbands to allow them liberty to giue almes. But in the case propounded they giue no liberty to wiues: for it is a ruled case laid downe by Christ himselfe, that workes of charity must be done, and almes must be giuen of such things Luke 11. 41. . as we haue, or which are in our power to giue. Now if the husband will not giue her that power, she hath not power to giue, and so is excu∣sed. Date quae habe∣tis eleemosynam Tertul. contr. Marcion. l. 4. 2 Cor. 8. 12. In this case her true will, and her faithfull and earnest desire shall be accepted for the deed, according to that which the Apo∣stle saith, if there be first a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. Many cases may be giuen wherein inferiours are restrained from workes of mercy; as suppose a sonne or seruant be desirous to visit one sicke r in prison, but his Parent or Master (though leaue be asked) will not suffer him, but charge him not to stirre out of doores, or o goe with him another way, shall this sonne or seruant not∣withstanding that charge, doe that worke of mercy? §. 35. Of obedience to an husband in such things as he sinfully forbiddeth. Obiect. 2. This restraint is not in the Lord, but rather against him and his word, therefore a wife is not bound thereunto. Answ. Though the husband sinne in restraining his wife, yet
shee in that restraint may obey, and that in the Lord: because the Lord who hath commanded her to be subiect in euery thing, hath no where warranted her not to be subiect in this particular. It is expresly said in the law concerning a wiues vowes, that if her hus∣band breake them after he hath heard them, he shall beare her ini∣quity. Numb. 30. 16. Did not he then sinne in restraining her, and was not she guiltlesse though she yeelded to his restraint? The condition be∣twixt husbands and wiues in this case, is not vnlike the case be∣twixt other superiours in authority, and their inferiours in subie∣ction. But other inferiours may lawfully abstaine from such things as their gouernours doe sinfully charge them to abstaine from. For suppose a sonne growen to be a man, liue in his fathers house at his fathers finding, and haue no set portion of his owne, and his father will not giue him leaue to bestow any thing on chari∣table vses, is he now bound to giue almes? shall the curse be exe∣cuted on him if he giue not? A crosse indeed I acknowledge it to be, both to such a sonne, and also to a wife to be so restrained: but not a curse or sinne; the sinne and curse lieth on their head, who restraine them by vertue of their authority, wherein they abuse their authority: as other gouernours may do and oft do, and yet neither liberty granted thereby to subiects, nor authority taken from gouernours. In this resemblance betwixt a sonne and a wife I desire not to be mistaken; for I alleadge it not to make the state of a wife and a sonne all one: but to shew that those generall precepts of giuing almes, may haue their exceptions, as they which in particular handle that point, giue other examples. There must therefore be a further ground then the generall commande∣ment of almes-giuing to proue the forenamed liberty of wiues. §. 36. Of Zipporahs case in circumcising her sonne. Obiect. 3. A wife was made to be an helpe to her husband: in those things therefore wherein he faileth, she must make sup∣ply, as Zipporah who performed a duty which belonged to her Exod. 4. 25. husband, and not vnto her. Answ. She may be an helpe in many other things, though this be out of her power: yea and in this also by counsell, perswasion, and other like meanes she may be a great helpe. The case of Zip∣porah was extraordinary, and of an vrgent present necessity, euen to saue the life of her husband. Besides, Moses was of himselfe
vnable to doe it, but willing that she should doe it. Now what is this to ordinarie cases, and such cases as husbands are able enough themselues to doe, but altogether vnwilling that it should be done by their wiues? Factum Zepho∣rae singulare est, & extraordina∣rium, ne{que} con∣stat illud simpli∣citer à Deo ap∣probatum fuisse. Simler. in Exod. 4. Luke 8. 3. But what if Zipporahs example herein be not warrantable? for it doth not appeare that it was simply approued of God: God doth oft remoue temporary iudgements for the very workes sake that is done, though in the manner it be sinfully done. Instance the repentance of Ahab, 1. King. 21. 29. §. 37. Of the wife of Chuzas case in ministering to Christ. 4. Obiect. Ioanna the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, mini∣stred vnto Christ of her substance without her husbands con∣sent. Answ. If this could be proued it were somewhat to the purpose; but this clause without her husbands consent (wherein the maine state of the question consisteth) is not in the text, nor by any good probabilitie can be gathered out of it. All the shew of probabilitie that can be shewed for it is, that Ioanna is there said to be the wife of Chuza, Herods steward. But to shew that that is nothing, let it be noted, 1. That phrase doth not imply that Chuza was then liuing. It is said that Dauid begat Salomon of the wife of Vriah, but Matth. 1. 6. . Vriah was not then liuing: therefore the translators for perspi∣cuitie sake doe insert these words (her that had beene) the wife of Vriah. So likewise Onan is commanded to goe in to his Gen. 38. 8. brothers wife, yet doth not this imply that his brother was then liuing. Obiect. Why should mention be made of Chuza, Herods steward, if he were not then liuing? Answ. To shew that Ioanna was a woman of great place, whereby this fruit of her faith in following Christ was the more commended. Thus in another kinde Matthew is intitled Matth. 10. 3. . the Publican, after he had cleane relinquisht that office, the more to commend his faith. I doe not here directly affirme that Chuza was then dead, but for ought that this phrase doth imply, he might be dead. 2. Some gather that this steward was that Ruler whose Chemnit. Harm. Euang. cap. 33. Ioh. 4. 53. sonne Christ healed, who thereupon beleeued with all his house.
Which if he were, then it cannot be doubted, but that his wife followed Christ with his good liking and consent. 3. Chuza being Herods steward, and so a man of great place, and publike imploiment, might, if he were then liuing, depute the managing of all affaires at home to his wife, as the Prou. 31. 11. husband of the good wife commended by Salomon, and so she might haue at least a generall consent. I doe not certainly determine any of these expresly to be so, I doe but note them as probabilities, yet such as doe suffici∣ently ouerthrow the surmised libertie of a wife in giuing almes without any consent of her husband: for this of all other pro∣babilities seemeth to be most improbable. Into my heart it can neuer enter to imagine that Christ would giue such an occasion of slander vnto his enemies, as to say he caried about with him other mens wiues, without or against the consent of their husbands, and suffered them to spend the goods of their hus∣bands vpon him. I had much rather thinke that either such women as followed him had no husbands liuing, or if they had, that they did that which they did with the consent of their husbands. §. 38. Of the Treat. 4. §. 18. 52. restraint of wiues about allowance for them∣selues or families without their husbands consent. That which hath hitherto beene deliuered concerning a wiues subiection in disposing goods, may also be applied to other things concerning her selfe, children, seruants, &c. whereof I will giue some examples. A wife hath not power to appoint what she list her selfe without or against her husbands consent, either for her owne allowance, or for her family; she must rather rest satisfied with that which he appointeth: for he being the head, must haue the ouer-ruling stroake therein. Besides he better knoweth what may be afforded. Quest. What if an husband make himselfe poorer then he is: and the allowance which he appointeth be meaner then his meanes, and vnbeseeming his place and state? Answ. She ought, if possiby she can by her owne instant perswasion, or any other faire meanes, moue him to that which tendeth to his honour and reputation: but if she can
no way preuaile, her subiection requireth contentment and patience. §. 39. Of a wiues Treat 4. §. 18. subiection to her husband about children. A wife may not simply without, or directly against her hus∣bands consent, order and dispose of the children in giuing them names, apparelling their bodies, appointing their cal∣lings, places of bringing vp, mariages, or portions. 1. For giuing names to children, besides that it is through∣out 1. Names. the Scripture for the most part enioyned to the husband, as to Gen. 17. 19. Abraham, to Luk. 1. 13. Zacharias, and to others, and that accor∣dingly husbands haue ordinarily done, as Gen. 5. 3. Adam, 29. Lamech, & 21. 3. Abraham, and others. It is to be noted that when there was a difference betwixt the man and his wife in giuing a childes name, he giuing one name, she another, the name which he gaue, stood; though Gen. 35. 18. Rachel named her youngest sonne Ben∣oni, yet Beniamin (which name Iaakob gaue) was the childes name. So also when Luk. 1. 62. Elizabeth told her friends that her childes name must be Iohn, they would not rest therein, till Zacharias had ratified that name. Yea though Ioseph were but the supposed father of Iesus, yet because he was the hus∣band of Mary the mother of Iesus, Mat. 1. 21. he had this honour gi∣uen him, to giue the name vnto her childe. Whereas in Scripture it is sometimes said that the mothers named their children, as Gen. 29. 32. Leah, & 30. 24. Rahel, and others, it is vpon the forenamed ground to be supposed that they had their husbands consent. 2. For appointing place and mariage it is noted that Gen. 27. 43, &c. Re∣bekah 2. Place and mariage. asked the consent of her husband: though she told her sonne Iaakob that he should goe to Haran to his vncle Laban to be there kept in safety from the fury of Esau, yet she would not send him till Gen. 28. 1, 2. Isaak had giuen his consent for his abode there, and taking a wife from thence. 3. For deputing vnto a calling, it is noted of 1 Sam. 1. 11. Annah, that 3. Calling. though before her childe was borne she had by solemne vow dedicated him to the Lord, yet when the childe was borne Vers 22. she asked her husbands consent about it. 4. Apparell. 4. That which is noted of 1 Sam. 2. 19. Annahs carrying a little coat to
her sonne yeare by yeare when she went vp with her husband, sheweth that she did it not without her husbands consent. Women are for the most part prone to pranke vp their chil∣dren aboue their husbands place and calling, and therefore good reason that therein they should be gouerned by their husbands. Obiect. What if husbands be more forward to haue their children attired vainly and vnseemely, then wiues? Answ. A wife must doe what she can to hinder it: if she can no way preuaile with him, she by reason of her subiection is much more excused, then he could be, if he would suffer his wife therein to haue her will. 5. The law that layeth the charge vpon husbands to giue 5. Portions. Deut. 21. 15, &c. such and such portions to his children, and the answerable practise of husbands from time to time, shew that the wife of her selfe hath not power to order them. §. 40. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 18. subiection to her husband about ordering seruants and beasts. If wiues must haue their husbands consent in ordering and disposing of their children which come out of her wombe, much more of their seruants. They may not take in, or thrust out seruants against their husbands minde. In this point, as in many other, Sarah ma∣nifested her wiue-like obedience; in that Gen. 16. 5. she would not deale roughly with her maid though she were prouoked: much lesse & 21. 10. put her out of doores till she had made the matter knowne to her husband. Though she failed in the manner, yet in the thing it selfe she is a good example. It is further noted and approued in the 2 King. 4. 22. Shunemite that she asked her husbands consent about sending a seruant with her. My meaning is not that such wiues as haue seruants allowed them to attend vpon them should aske their husbands con∣sent whensoeuer they haue occasion to vse them; for their husbands by allowing them men for their attendance manifest their will and consent that they may vse them as they see occasion: but that they should not vse and imploy their ser∣uants in such things as they know their husbands would dislike, except they can gaine their husbands consent.
Against those particulars of children and seruants it may be obiected, that wiues are parents of their children as well as husbands, and mistresses of seruants as well as they masters, and therefore haue altogether as great power ouer them as their husbands. Answ. Indeed if the authority of the husband come not betweene, that may be granted in relation betwixt her and them: but her power being subordinate to her husbands in relation to him she hath not so great a power: the power of a wife that now we speake of is directly in relation to her husband. The like may be said of their beasts and cattell, a particular point noted also in the example of the Shunemite, who ha∣uing occasion to vse a beast went to her husband, and said, send I pray thee with me one of the asses. 2 King. 4. 22. §. 41. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 18. subiection in entertaining strangers iourny∣ing abroad, and making vowes. If wiues may not at their pleasure vse the things appertai∣ning to the house, much lesse may they bring strangers into the house and entertaine them without or against their hus∣bands consent. The good Shunemite so often named as a pre∣sident 2 King. 4. 10. for good wiues, first asked her husbands consent, before she lodged a Prophet of the Lord. The same patterne is also commended vnto wiues to moue them not to iourney abroad without their husbands consent. For though that good wife had a very weighty and iust oc∣casion 2 King. 4. 22. to goe vnto the Prophet, yet she would not before she knew her husbands minde. As for a wiues power to make vowes, in that the law giueth an husband power to disanull her vow when he knoweth it, it implieth that she ought to haue his consent in making it, if Num. 30. 9. at least she desire to haue it established, which she ought to de∣sire, or else she mocketh God. I haue thought good to mention these particular points for illustration of a wiues subiection, because they are all of them grounded on Gods word: many other might be added to them, but these are sufficient.
§. 42. Of aberrations contrary to a wiues subiection in doing things without or against their husbands consent. Now consider we the vsuall vices and aberrations contrary to those duties: the generall summe of all is, for a wife to take on her to doe what she list, whether her husband will or no, either not willing that he should know what she doth, or not caring though it be against his minde and will. Of this sort are 1. Such as priuily take money out of their husbands clo∣sets, 1. Priuy pur∣loyning hus∣bands goods. counters, or other like places where he laieth it, neuer tel∣ling him of it, nor willing that he should know it: likewise such as after the like manner take ware out of the shop, corne out of the garner, sheepe out of the flocke, or any other goods to sell and make money of: or to giue away, or otherwise to vse so as their husbands shall neuer know, if they can hinder it. Such wiues herein sinne hainously, and that in many respects. First they disobey the ordinance of God in a maine branch of their particular calling, which is subiection. 2. They ill repay the care and paines which their husbands take for their good. Many such wiues recompence euill for good, which is a deuillish qualitie. 3. They are oft a meanes to impaire and impouerish their husbands estate. 4. They shew themselues no better then Si vxor ex bonis commu∣nibus sie viri licentia saltem praesumpta ac∣cipiat, verè furtum com∣miit. Greg. Sayr. clau. reg. l. 9. c. 16. pilfring theeues thereby. All that can be iustly and truly said for their right in the common goods, cannot defend them from the guilt of theft: they are the more dangerous by how much the more they are trusted, and lesse suspected: and their fact is so much the more hainous by how much the more deere their husbands ought to be vnto them. 5. They are a verie ill example to other inferiours in the house, for seldome hath a man a deceitfull wife, but some of the children or seruants, are made accessarie thereunto, being made her instruments to take the goods, and bestow them as she or∣dereth, and so are made vnfaithfull. 6. They make themselues slaues to their owne children and
seruants, whom they dare not displease, lest they should tell what was done. 7. They teach their children and seruants to be theeues: for besides that such as are vsed by their mistresses to purloine for them, are thereby made accessarie to their sinne, they will also purloine for themselues, when their mistresses shall not know. So as what with the wiues purloining one way, and the childrens or seruants another way, a mans estate may be wasted as dew before the Sunne, and he not know which way. 2. Such as will haue what allowance they thinke best for 2. Taking what allow∣ance they list. themselues and family, and scornfully say, They will not be at their husbands finding: they know best what allowance is fittest for the family, and that it shall haue. Many will make their hus∣bands eare tingle againe, yea and make the whole house (if not the street also) ring of it, if they thinke their allowance be not answerable to the vttermost extent of their husbands estate. This impatiencie and insolencie, as it crosseth Gods ordinance, so it maketh both their liues vncomfortable. 3. Such as cocker, attire, or any way bring vp their chil∣dren 3. Ordering children a∣gainst their husbands minde. otherwise then their husbands would, euen to the griefe and dishonour of their husbands: keeping them at home when their husbands, for their better education, would haue them abroad: as these sinne in hindring the good of their children, so also in not yeelding to their husbands. 4. Ordering seruants a∣gainst their husbands minde. 4. Such as will haue their owne will about seruants, taking in, and putting out whom they please, and when they please: vsing some seruants whom they finde for their turne to the preiudice of their husbands: and carying themselues so sharp∣ly 5. Lending forth their husbands cattell. and shrewishly to others that are for their husbands turne, as a good, trustie, faithfull seruant cannot long stay in the house. 5. Such as secretly lend out their husbands horses, or other 6. Feasting when their husbands shall not know it. Absente marito compotationes domi ne excita. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. like cattell, more respecting to pleasure a vaine friend, then to please a good husband. This fault is so much the greater, when it is done to the dammage and preiudice of the husband. 6. Such as are then most frolicke and iolly, when their hus∣bands are furthest off and cannot know it. Salomon sets it downe as a note of a strumpet, Prou. 7. 19. then to tricke vp her house and to seeke for guests, when her husband is gone a iourney farre
off. Then ought she to be most solitarie, and by abstaining from merrie meetings, to shew that there can be no greater dampe to her mirth, then the absence of her husband. 7. Such as thinke their houses a prison vnto them, that can∣not 7. Gadding a∣broad at their owne plea∣sure. Noli pedem tuum limine crebro efferre. &c. Naz. loc. citat. long tarrie at home: they thinke they haue power to goe when and whither they will, and to tarrie out as long as they list, thinke their husbands of it what they will. 1 Tim. 5. 13. The Apostle layeth downe this as a marke of a wanton wife, and an idle house-wife, being idle (saith he) they goe about from house to house: therefore in Tit. 2. 5. another place he exhorteth them to be keepers at home. The Wise-man goeth further, and maketh this to be an∣other note of a strumpet, that Prou. 7. 11. her feet cannot abide in the house: which we may see verified in Judg. 19. 2. the Leuites adulterous wife, whose fearefull end was a stampe of Gods iudgement on such loose lewdnesse. 8. Such as care not how or what they binde themselues vnto 8. Binding themselues without con∣sent of hus∣band. without their husbands consent, or knowledge: Herein especi∣ally offend such as being seduced by Iesuites, Priests, or Friers, take the Sacrament, and thereupon by solemne vow and oath binde themselues neuer to read an English Bible, nor any Prote∣stants bookes, no nor to goe to any of their Churches, or to heare any of their Sermons: and such most of all as enter into some Po∣pish Nunnery, and vow neuer to returne to their husbands againe. Obiect. 1 Sam. 1. 15. Annah vowed her childe to God without her hus∣bands consent, why may not they much more vow themselues to God? Answ. Assuredly she was perswaded that her husband would not be against it, and so had an implicit consent: which may well be gathered, because afterwards she made it knowne to him, as both the  componitur ex diuersis vocibu  Petiui eum a Deo, I haue asked him of God. name giuen to the childe, and 1 Sam. 1. 22. that speech of Annah, I will bring him that he may appeare before the Lord, and there abide for euer, and the answer of her husband, Uers. 23. The Lord establish his word, and 1 Sam. 2. 19. his going vp with her when he was dedicated to the Lord, doe all shew. Thus farre of the first branch of a wiues submission in abstai∣ning from doing things without her husbands consent. The second followeth, in doing the things which here∣quireth.
§. 43. Of a wiues actiue Obedience. It is a good proofe and triall of a wiues obedience, to abstaine from doing such things as otherwise she would doe, if her hus∣bands contrarie will did not restraine her: but yet that is not suf∣ficient, there must be an actiue, as well as a passiue obedience yeel∣ded. That old Law before mentioned (thy desire shall be subiect to thine husband, and he shall rule ouer thee) implieth so much al∣so. If she refuse to doe what he would haue her to doe, her desire is not subiect to him, but to her selfe, neither doth he rule ouer her. This actiue part of her obedience hath respect 1. To his commandements, readily to doe what he lawfully A wiues actiue obedience re∣specteth first her husbands commande∣ment. commands. 2. To his reproofes, carefully to redresse what he iustly bla∣meth. For the first, so farre ought a wife to be from thinking scorne to be commanded by her husband, that the very knowledge which by any meanes she hath of her husbands minde and will, ought to haue the force of a straight commandement with her. This readinesse to obey is commended in the wiues of Iaakob, to whom when Iaakob had declared what motiues he had to depart from their fathers house, intimating thereby that he meant to de∣part, and would haue them to goe with him, yet before he parti∣cularly expressed his will, they readily answered, Whatsoeuer God Gen. 31. 16. hath said vnto thee, doe: whereby they gaue him to vnderstand that they were ready to yeeld vnto whatsoeuer he would haue done. §. 44. Of a wiues willingnesse to Treat. 4. §. 18. dwell where her husband will. To make this part of a wiues obedience somewhat more cleare, I will exemplifie it by two or three particular instances, recorded and approued in Gods word. The first is, that a wife ought to be willing to dwell where her husband will haue her dwell. The wiues of Abraham, Isaak, and Iaakob, herein manifested their wiue-like obedience: though their husbands brought them from their owne countrey, and from their fathers house, yet they refused not to goe with them, but dwelt in a strange countrey, and that in tents.
Note in particular what Iaakobs wiues say to their husband in this case, Is there any portion or inheritance for vs in our fathers Gen. 31. 14. house? implying thereby, that seeing it was their husbands plea∣sure to be gone, they would not any longer tarry in their fathers house, to looke for any more portion or inheritance there. These examples doe further shew that if an husband haue iust occasion to remoue from one country to another, and in those countries from place to place, his wife ought to yeeld to goe with him, if he require it at her hands. Note what the Apostle saith, haue we not power to lead about a wife? That interrogation 1 Cor. 9. 5. implieth a strong asseueration. The husband then hauing power to lead about a wife from place to place, she ought to submit her selfe to that power. This clause (as well as other Apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas) sheweth, that this was not only a power which might be vsed, but which was vsed by hus∣bands, and yeelded vnto by wiues. Obiect. The forenamed examples are extraordinary, and that vpon extraordinary occasions. Answ. Yet they may be patternes for ordinary occasions which are lawfull and warrantable. Was it not an extraordi∣nary fact of Eliah to pray first that there might be no raine, and Iam. 5. 17. then againe that there might be raine? yet is this propoun∣ded as a generall patterne to moue vs to pray for things law∣full. Now in laying downe this dutie I added the clause and ca∣ueat of iust occasion, to meet both with such as vpon discon∣tent, or superstition, leaue the land where the true Gospell is maintained, and preached, and goe into idolatrous places: and also with such wandring giddy heads as only to satisfie their owne humour, and to see fashions, as we speake, can ne∣uer rest in a place, but are continually remouing from countrey to countrey, and from place to place: I thinke (to vse the words of the Apostle) a wife is not vnder bondage in such cases. 1 Cor. 7. 15. But if a man be sent of an ambassage by his Prince, or coun∣trey: or if a Preacher or Professor be called into another countrey, as Bucer and Peter Martyr were into England in King Edwards daies (which to this day is vsuall in other coun∣tries) or if a man be adiudged vnto long imprisonment, and
vpon these and other like occasions shall require his wife to be with him, she ought in dutie to yeeld vnto his demand. Contrary is the minde and practise of many wiues, who Contrary, when a wife makes her hus∣band dwell where she will. being affected and addicted to one place more then another, as to the place where they were bred and brought vp, where their greatest, best, and most friends dwell, and where they haue good acquaintance, refuse to goe and dwell where their husbands calling lieth, though he require, and desire them ne∣uer so much. Thus many husbands are forced to their great dammage for peace sake to yeeld vnto their wiues, and so either to relinquish their calling, or to haue two houses; whence it followeth, that sometimes they must neglect their seruants and calling, and sometimes be absent from their wiues, if not from their children also. Some wiues pretend that they can∣not endure the smoake of the citie, other that they cannot en∣dure the aire of the countrie: whereas indeed their owne hu∣mour and conceit stuffes them more then either citie smoake or countrie aire. I cannot call such the daughters of Sarah herein: 1 Pet. 3. 5, 6. they are not like those forenamed holy women that trusted in God, and were subiect to their husbands, but rather like to that light housewife of the Leuite, who would not dwell in her hus∣bands Iudg. 19. 2. house at mount Ephraim, but at her fathers house in Beth-lehem Iudah. Such wiues as I speake of, in matrimoniall chastitie may be more honest, but in wiuelike subiection are little more dutifull. Let this be taken for a fault, and it will be the sooner amended. §. 45. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 29. readinesse to come to her husband when he requires it. Another particular instance of a wiues readinesse to yeeld vnto her husbands commandement is, to come to her husband when her husband requireth it, either by calling her, or sending for her. The forenamed Gen. 31. 4. wiues of Iaakob being sent for to their husband in the field where he was, made no excuse, but came presently. So farre ought wiues herein to subiect their wills to their husbands, that though it may seeme to them some disparagement to come, yet if their husbands will haue it so they must yeeld, otherwise they seeme euen to Esth. 1. 17. despise their husbands.
Contrary is Vashtie-like stoutnesse, when wiues thinke and Contrary, stoutnesse in refusing to come. say, it is a seruants part to come when they are called or sent for, and they will neuer yeeld to be their husbands seruants, to come at his command. By the same reason may all duties of subiection be reiected. But for this particular, let such stout Esh. 1. 16, &c. dames note the issue of Vashties stubbornnesse. As many excuses might be alleaged for her as I thinke for any: for First, she was Hebraei docent Vastam na∣tam fuisse ex Baltbasare rege Chaldaeorum. Feuard. in Esth. 1. Alij, ex Cyro. Merl. in Esth. royally descended, being the daughter of a King. Secondly, she was then among the honourable women of the kingdome. Thirdly, the King was in drinke when he sent for her. Fourth∣ly, he sent for her to shew her beautie before multitudes of men, which was not seemely. But all these were not sufficient to excuse her fault, and free her from blame. First, though she were of royall parentage, yet she was a wife, and her husband sent for her. Secondly, being among the noble women of the kingdome, she should the rather haue shewed her selfe a pat∣terne of subiection in this kinde. Thirdly, though he were in drinke, yet remained he an husband: and the thing which he commanded was not such but that she might haue done it without sinne. Fourthly, if she thought the thing vnseemely, she should first haue vsed all the faire meanes she could to haue beene spared; but if by all she could not haue preuailed, then (the thing being not simplie vnlawfull and a sinne) she should haue yeelded. Obiect. Her fault was not in that as a wife she came not to her husband, but in that as a subiect she came not to her Soueraigne. Answ. Her fault was in both: and in the iudgement passed against her, that former was most vrged, namely that by her Esth. 1. 17. example all women might learne to despise their husbands. 2. Obiect. Her fact is so censured but by heathen men, that had no vnderstanding of Gods word. Answ. 1. The holy Scripture by the seuerall circumstances so distinctly noted intimateth that her rebellious fact was a notorious fault: and accordingly both Pellican. Lauater. Gualt. Strigel. Cuper. Merlin. Feuard. Bellator. Rupert. Isiodor. Hisp. Raban. alij{que} Comment. in Esth. iudicious commen∣ters, and also Preachers doe taxe her of sinfull disobedience to her husband. 2. Though they were heathen, yet they shewed what sub∣iection
is required of wiues to their husbands by the very light of nature, whereby this sinne is aggrauated. 3. Abimelech was but a heathen man, yet his sentence con∣cerning a womans subiection in these words, he is to thee a Gen. 20. 16. couering of the eyes, is taken to be iudicious, and being appro∣ued by the holy Ghost, to be a good proofe. As for that parti∣cular of Uashtie, why is it so largely recorded in the Scrip∣ture but for instruction, and admonition vnto wiues? §. 46. Of a wiues readinesse to Treat. §. 29. doe what her husband re∣quireth. A third particular instance of a wiues readinesse to yeeld vn∣to her husbands commandement, is, to performe what businesse he requireth of her. When of a sudden there came three men to Abram, and he was desirous to entertaine them, he bid his wife make readie quickly three measures of meale, &c. and she Gen. 18. 6. did it accordingly. Ieroboam hauing a weightie occasion to send to Ahijah the Prophet, thought it meet to send by his 1 King. 14. 2, &c. wife, she accordingly (though a Queene) went: she did as her husband would haue her. Contrary is the humour of many wiues who will not doe Contrary, stubbornnesse in refusing to doe a thing vpon com∣mand. any thing vpon command. If such a wiues husband being desirous to entertaine a friend on the sudden, shall vse Abrams phrase, make readie quickly, &c. she will say, let him come and doe it himselfe, if he will haue it so quickly done, I will not be his drudge: or if, hauing a matter of moment and se∣crecie, he will his wife her selfe to doe it, she will reply, I am none of your seruants; cannot you put it to one of them, or doe it your selfe? Yet will such wiues be ready to command their husbands to doe euery toy, and if he doe it not, they can reply, is this such a matter? and may not a wife speake to her husband? Were the point of obedience well learned, it would cast such wiues into another mould. These few particulars may serue for direction in many hundreds. I proceed to the other part of a wiues actiue obe∣dience, which respecteth the reproofes of her husband. §. 47. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 34, 35. meeke taking a reproofe. The husband hauing authoritie ouer his wife, by vertue thereof he hath power, yea it is his dutie as there is needfull
cause to rebuke her: By iust consequence therefore it follow∣eth, A wiues actiue obedience to her husbands reproofe. The best triall of obedience. that it is her dutie to yeeld obedience thereunto. Which ought the rather to be done because the chiefest triall of sound obedience lieth herein. For nothing goeth so much against ones stomach as reproofe: she that yeelds when she is rebuked, will much more when she is intreated. This point of obedi∣ence is manifested two waies. 1. By meeknesse in taking a reproofe. 2. By endeuour to redresse what is iustly reproued. The very point of obedience especially consisteth in this latter: the former is as a good preparatiue thereunto, without which it will hardly be done, at least not well done. Meeknesse in this case is one of the most principall fruits of 1. She must meekly take reproofe. 1 Pet. 3. 4. Gen. 30. 1. that meeke and quiet spirit which S. Peter commendeth vnto wiues. Howsoeuer Rachel iustly deserued blame for comming in a fuming chafe, and with an imperious command to her husband, yet in that she meekly tooke his sharpe reproofe (for she replied not against it, but meekly gaue a direction for the better accomplishment of her desire) her example is commen∣dable: commendable I say, not in the matter of her directi∣on, but in her patient bearing of reproofe. Much wisdome may be learned hereby: for when any Wisdome learned. meekly take a reproofe, thereby they suppresse their passion, and keepe it from rising as a cloud before their vnderstan∣ding and darkning it, and so may they better iudge of the matter reproued whether it be iust or no: and whether it need redresse or no: whereof they who are impatient of reproofe, and fret and fume against it, cannot so well iudge. The virgin Mary made good vse of Christs reprouing her, and thereby Joh. 2. 4, 5. learned and taught a good point of wisdome, namely so to referre our affaires to Christ as we expect his pleasure; and not prescribe time, meanes, manner, or any other like circumstan∣ces vnto him. Quest. What if the husbands reproofe be bitter? Suadeo mulie∣ribus vt viros etiam asperiores perserant. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. Answ. He therein forgets his place, yet thereupon she must not forget her duty. If Iaakobs reproofe be well noted, we shall finde it very tart, for it is expresly said that his anger was kindle against her, (Gen. 30. 2.) so as he spake in anger: the manner
and forme of his words being with an interrogation, and the Excandescenti marito cede, & molli oratione iuva. Greg. Naz. ad Olymp. matter also, am I in Gods stead, &c. declare tartnesse: yet (as was declared before) she shewed meeknese. Quest. What if his reproofe be vniust? 2. Answ. Yet may not meeknesse be forgotten. In such a case a wife may make a iust apologie to cleare her owne innocencie, and manifest her husbands error: but if he refuse to heare her, or will not beleeue her, then (as S. Peter speaketh in another 1 Pet. 2. 19, 20. case) she must endure griefe for conscience toward God. The two reasons which there he rendreth in that other case may not vnfitly be applied to this. 1. In generall this is thank-worthy, it is a grace, a glory to . her: a matter that deserueth praise and commendation. 2. In particular it is acceptable to God: howsoeuer their hus∣bands . may deale roughly and vntowardly with them, yet God will graciously respect them, if they shall patiently in obedi∣ence to his ordinance beare their husbands vniust reproofes. 3. I may adde this reason also, that thus they shall shew themselues good Christians indeed, in that they are not ouer∣come Rom. 12. 21. of euill. Contrary is their minde who by no meanes will brooke a rebuke at their husbands hands: it skills not whether it be iust or vniust: if their husbands reproue them, they shall be sure to haue the reproofe rebounded backe againe vpon their faces, and that with greater violence then euer it came from them. There be some that seeme to be very good wiues till they be tried by the touch-stone of reproofe: but then though the re∣proofe be for matter most iust, for manner most milde, and that in priuate betwixt their husbands and themselues, yet they grow so impatient, or rather mad, as they forbeare not to giue their husbands the most scornfull speeches that they can inuent, vsing withall bitter imprecations and execrations, and threaten to drowne or hang themselues if they be crossed of their wills. Yea further, if wise husbands shall forbeare them in their passion, and after it is allaied tell them how vnbesee∣ming their places they carried themselues, they will seeke to iustifie themselues, and lay all the blame on their husbands for crossing them in their will: or if they cannot but see their
fault, yet they will only say, it is my infirmitie: but yet euer continue in that infirmitie: and though they make shew of fearing God, yet labour not to purge this corrupt humour out of their hearts. Hence is it for the most part that contentions arise betwixt man and wife. If wiues would learne in this point to be subiect, many iarres, which from time to time a∣rise betwixt them, would be allaied, if not preuented. Mi∣chal 2 Sam. 6. 20, &c. Iob 2. 10. the wife of Dauid, and Iobs wife (though they gaue iust occasion to be most sharply reproued, yet) shall rise vp in iudgement against these wiues, because they were silent after they were reproued, and replied not. Salomon oft titles such as cannot beare rebuke scorners: so as hereby wiues shew that Prou 9. 7, 8. they are very scornfull. §. 48. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 35. readinesse to redresse what her husband iustly reproueth in her. A further degree of obedience in bearing reproofe is, that 2 She must re∣dresse what is iustly repro∣ued. a wife readily redresse what is iustly reproued by her husband: I say iustly, because where no fault is, there needs no amend∣ment: patience may be needfull (as was before shewed) but no repentance of that which is not amisse. But where any thing is amisse, there must be a redresse. Rachel did amisse in Gen. 31. 19. brin∣ging Idols into her husbands house: her husband in & 35. 2, 4. bid∣ding her among others to put away their strange gods, repro∣ued them all. Whereupon she with all the rest gaue to him all their strange gods. This was a good redresse. A reproofe may be iustly giuen either for a good dutie omit∣ted; or for an euill thing committed: and accordingly must the redresse or amendment be. A dutie formerly omitted must after the reproofe be more carefully obserued and performed, if it be a continuall dutie, and may be againe performed: otherwise the redresse is a testification of true sorrow for that fault. When an euill is committed, if any meanes can be vsed to make vp the hurt, and redresse the mischiefe that fol∣lowed thereupon, it must be done: if not, sorrow as before, must be testified, and care taken that the same, or the like be not committed againe. As a good conscience requireth as much of all Christians by whomsoeuer they be reproued, so the respect which a wife
oweth to an husband doth after an especiall manner require it. Otherwise her fault is doubled, 1. by continuance in her sin; 2. by disobedience to her husband. Contrary is their spirit who for reproofe waxe the worse: Contrary, to be worse for reprouing. Prou. 9. 8. being like those scorners (of whom Salomon speaketh) that hate those that reproue them. It is the speech of some wiues, that if their husbands would let them alone they would doe the better: but vpon rebuke they will neuer amend: the more their husbands finde fault, the more will they goe on, in doing what they doe. What other iudgement can be giuen of such, then that which the wise man giueth, there is more hope Prou. 26. 12. of a foole then of them. §. 49. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 50 contentment with her husbands present estate. Of submission hitherto. Contentment is also a part of obedience: it hath respect to a mans outward estate and abilitie, in and with which a wife must rest satisfied and contented, whether it be high or low, great or meane, wealthy or needy, aboue, equall, or vnder that estate wherein she was before mariage: yea though a man haue beene sometimes great in estate, yet, if he decay therein, and be brought to a meane estate, she ought to rest content. Thus much Iob implieth in his replie to his wife, saying, shall we re∣ceiue Job 2. 10. expounded. good at the hand of God, and not receiue euill? The euill he speaketh of was the losse of his goods, seruants, and children, to∣gether with other miseries that Satan through Gods permissi∣on inflicted vpon him: the receiuing of euill which he speaketh of was a resting content with it, and a patient bearing of it. Euill may be laid on any, and so they forced to beare it: but they on∣ly receiue it, who are content with it. Now in that he vseth the plurall number (WE) and speaking to his wife saith (shall not we receiue euill) he sheweth that his wife ought as well as he to haue rest contented in that poore and miserable estate: For 1. Man and wife being one flesh, by vertue of their matri∣moniall vnion, both his aduancement, and also his abasement is hers: as she riseth with him, so she falleth with him. Where∣fore as she is willing to be aduanced with him, so she must be content to be abased with him. 2. If at the time of mariage her husband was of meaner estate
then she, she voluntarily put her selfe into that meane estate: for a wife taketh her husband (as he her) for better for worse, for richer for poorer. And shall she not be content with her own act? If after mariage his estate decay, and wax meaner then it was, she is to be perswaded that by God it was so ordered, and that God aimed at her humiliation as well as his: and thereupon she ought in her dutifull submission to Gods ouer-ruling proui∣dence to be patient and content: this Iob implieth vnder this phrase, shall we not receiue euill at the hand of God? and vnder this, The Lord taketh away. 3. A wiues contentment is a great ease to her husband lying vnder a crosse: and it maketh the burden seeme much lighter then otherwise it would, if at least he be a kinde husband, and affected with his wiues passion, as he ought to be. For a louing husband in euery distresse is more perplexed for his wife, then for himselfe. §. 50. Of wiues discontent at their husbands estate. Contrary is the impatiencie, and discontent of wiues at Discontent manifested. the meannesse, and (as they thinke) basenesse of their husbands estate: which is many waies manifested. 1. Some when they are maried finding their husbands estate 1. By repen∣ting their ma∣riage. weaker then they imagined, repent their mariage, and sticke not to tell their husbands, that if they had before knowne them to be no better men then they finde them to be, they should haue beene no husbands for them. Wherein first they bewray their foolish indiscretion by saying, when it is too late, if I had Non est sapien∣tis dicere non putâram. Cic. Offic. lib. 1. thought this; and withall they manifest their own rashnesse and vnaduisednesse, in that they gaue their hands and plighted their troth to those whom they knew not. If they say, they were deceiued by their friends whom they put in trust, I answer that mariage is too weightie a matter to be wholly referred ouer to the trust of friends: euery one that yeeldeth to be ma∣ried, ought wel to know the party vnto whom in this case they yeeld: and aboue all they ought to seeke direction, helpe, and blessing from God. If notwithstanding all the meanes which possibly they could vse, they be deceiued, they are to looke vnto God, and to behold his prouidence therein: and duly to weigh whether the Lord haue crossed their desire for their
humiliation, or for triall of their patience, wisdome and other like graces, or else to weine them from some vaine and world∣ly delights, whereunto they were too much addicted. 2. Others obseruing their husbands estate to be decaied 2. By impati∣ent cariage. and wasted, neuer search after the occasion, but lay all the blame vpon their husbands, and with their discontented lookes, passionate words, and impatient cariage, so vex their hearts, as they make the crosse much more heauy then other∣wise it could be. Though the estate should be ouerthrowne by the vnthriftinesse of an husband, yet ought a wife to looke vnto Gods prouidence therein, as was noted before. 3. Others scorning to stoope, and to come downe to their 3. By refusing to stoope. husbands present condition, through their pride and vaine∣glory are a great means to make his estate much the worse: for they, so long as by any meanes they can get it, will not abate any thing of their braue apparell, dainty cheere, rich furniture, and other like things, which are causes of great expence to their husbands: hereby also it commeth oft to passe that hus∣bands are thought to be wealthier then indeed they are, and so greater taxations and charges then they can beare are laid vp∣on them for King, Countrey, Church, Poore, and the like. 4. Others, through discontent lie long lazing in their beds, 4. By refusing to helpe. or idly sit still when they are vp, and will not take any whit the more paines to raise vp and increase their husbands estate: whereby God is prouoked more and more to weaken their estates, that so he may the more punish such pride and lazinesse in wiues. §. 51. Of Treat. 4. §. 26. cases wherein a wife ought not to forbeare what her husband forbiddeth. So much of the distinct branches of a wiues subiection. The limitation and manner of performing it next followeth. To know the limitation of a wiues obedience, and the man∣ner how she ought to yeeld subiection vnto her husband, two things must be considered: 1. The place of an husband. 2. The place of a wife. The husbands place is noted in this phrase, as to the Lord: Eph. 5. 22. whereby is shewed that the husband euen by vertue of his
place is to his wife in Christs stead: which is further more plainly laid downe in these words following, the husband is Vers. 23. the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church. The wiues place is intimated in these words, as the Church Vers. 24. is subiect vnto Christ, so let wiues be to their owne husbands: whereby it is cleere that the obedience which a wife perfor∣meth to her husband must be such an obedience as the Church performeth to Christ. From the place of an husband, I gather this generall ground concerning a wiues subiection, that Subiection must be yeelded to the husband as to Christ, whence will follow two conclusions, one negatiue, which is this, The wife must yeeld no other subiection to her husband then what may stand with her subiection to Christ. The other affirmatiue, which is this, The wife must subiect her selfe to her husband in that manner that she would or should subiect her selfe to Christ. The former is a necessary condition required of all inferi∣ours in their subiection, and obedience (as I shewed Treat. 1. §. 6. before) much more in a wiues subiection to her husband, because there is of all vnequals See §. 4. of this Treat. the least disparity betwixt husbands and wiues. Hence for our present purpose, I gather these two other more particular conclusions, The first whereof is this, 1. If God expresly command the wife any duty, and her hus∣band will not by any meanes giue consent that she shall doe it, but for∣bid her, she may and ought to doe it without, or against his consent. Two cautions are warily to be obserued about this con∣clusion: 2. Cautions for limiting a wiues per∣sisting to doe that which her husband for∣bids. 1. That the wife be sure that God hath commanded her that which she doth without or against her husbands consent. If she doubt, then she must stay, and for beare till she gaine his consent. When two opposite cases meet together, and the one be doubtfull, the other plaine and expresse: the doubt∣full case must giue place to the more euident. Now the law of subiection is indefinite, thy desire shall be subiect to thine hus∣band; Gen 3 16. the extent of it is generall, in euery thing; the only re∣seruation and exception is in the Lord; wherefore if the wife
be not sure that that which her husband forbiddeth her is against the Lord, she must forbeare to doe it. The second caution is that she vse all good meanes she can to gaine her husbands consent, before she doe, euen that which is commanded, against his consent. Thus shall she testifie her subiection both to God and her husband. To God, in that nothing can keepe her from doing his expresse commande∣ment: she will rather offend her husband then God, when one of them must needs be offended. To her husband, in that she putteth it to the vttermost push, and vseth all the meanes she can to auoid his offence, in so much as he himselfe might see (if the god of this world blinded not his eies) that the of∣fence is no way giuen on her part, but meerely taken on his. For proofe of this, it is without all contradiction true, that the wife is not bound to greater subiection vnto her hus∣band then the subiect is vnto the magistrate: but a subiect ought not to forbeare a bounden duty commanded of God, be∣cause his gouernour forbids him. Instance the example of Da∣niel, Dan. 6. 7, &c. who daily made his praiers to God, though the King had made a solemne decree that none should aske any petition of God or man within thirty daies but of the king. Instance also the Apostles, Act. 4. 18, &c. who preached the Gospel, thogh they were expresly forbiddē. Though the Scripture be plentifull in affording examples of wiues subiection, yet it is very sparing in recording exam∣ples of those who in such warrantable cases refused to be sub∣iect, lest wiues from thence should take too great liberty. Some are recorded, but such as are either extraordinary, or not euery way instifiable. Abigails example was extraordinary, 1 Sam. 25. 18. and therfore not imitable but in such like extraordinary cases. The example of Rebekah, which may seeme somewhat more Gen. 27. 6. pertinent, is not euery way to be iustified. For though the thing which she intended were for the substance of it very good, and ought to haue beene done, namely the blessing of Iaakob, (for God foreshewed that the blessing appertained to Iaakob, in that he said, The elder shall serue the younger) yet Gen. 25. 23. because she put not her husband in minde of Gods word, nor laboured to perswade him to fulfill the same, but went about the matter deceitfully, she cannot therein be iustified. But in
the generall this example sheweth that Gods word must be yeelded vnto rather then an husbands will. For better application of this point I will lay downe some particular instances agreeable to Gods word. Suppose a wife well instructed in the true religion be maried to an idola∣trous or profane husband, and he without any iust cause for∣bid her to goe to the Church, especially on the Lords daies, to pray in English, to read the word, to teach her children the principles of religion, to restore that which she hath vniustly and fraudulently gotten, with the like, she may, and must doe them notwithstanding. Obiect. Why may not giuing of almes be reckoned among these? Answ. 1. Because the husband hath a greater power ouer the goods, then ouer these things. 2. Because almes-giuing is not simply commanded to all, but to such as haue wherewithall to giue: but these things are simply commanded to all. §. 52. Of cases wherein a wife ought to forbeare what her husband requireth. The other particular conclusion is this, that If an husband require his wife to doe that which God hath forbidden she ought not to doe it. Two cautions like the former are likewise to be obserued 2. Cautions for limiting a wiues refusing to doe that which her husband com∣mands. about this point. First, that she be sure (being truly informed by Gods word) that that which she refuseth to doe at her husbands command, is forbidden by God. Secondly, that she first labour with all meekenesse and by all good meanes that she can to disswade her husband from vr∣ging and pressing that vpon her, which with a good consci∣ence she cannot doe. A like proofe may be brought for this as was for the for∣mer: for we know that a wife is not bound vnto greater sub∣iection to her husband then a sonne is vnto a father: but a sonne may in the case propounded forbeare to doe that which his father requireth and commandeth him to doe: instance the approued example of Ionathan, who refused to bring Da∣uid 1 Sam. 20. 31.
vnto Saul to be slaine, though his father commanded him so to doe. I might also instance the same in Sauls subiects and 1 Sam. 22. 17. seruants, who refused to slay the Priests of the Lord at his command. Though an husband be not reckoned in particu∣lar among those to whom we are forbidden to hearken if they Deut. 13. 6. intice vs to idolatry, yet by the rule of relation he is implied, and by iust consequence gathered from this clause, thy friend which is as thine owne soule; for who so deare as an husband? To exemplifie this in some particulars as I did the former, If an husband shall command his wife to goe to Masse, to a stage play, to play at dice, to prostitute her body to vncleannes, to goe garishly and whorishly attired, to sell by scant weights, short measures, or the like, she ought not to doe so. §. 53. Of wiues faults in shewing more respect to their hus∣bands then to God. Contrary to this limitation is on the one side a fawning flattering disposition of such wiues as seeke to please their husbands, so as they care not to displease God, (Iezabel was such an one; to please her husband most lewdly she did 1 Ki. 21. 7. &c. practise Naboths death) and on the other side a fainting timo∣rous heart which maketh them feare their husbands more then they feare God. Good Sarah, that worthy president of Gen. 12. 13. &c. good wiues in other things, somewhat failed herein. Did wiues duly consider, and alwaies remember that they haue an husband (namely Christ) in heauen, as well as on earth, and that there is greater difference betwixt that and this husband, then betwixt heauen and earth, and that both in giuing re∣ward, and taking reuenge, there is no comparison betwixt them, their care of pleasing, or their feare of offending their husband in heauen would be much more then of pleasing, or offending their husband on earth: if any thing were comman∣ded or forbidden them by their husbands on earth against Christ, they would say, If I doe this, or forbeare that, I should worke falshood against mine owne soule; for nothing can be hid from mine husband in heauen: yea I should herein obey Satan, rather then God. §. 54. Of the manner of a wiues subiection to her husband. The second generall conclusion concerning the manner of a
wiues subiection, which was gathered from the place of an husband, was this, that The wife must subiect her selfe to her husband in that manner, that she would or should subiect her selfe to Christ. The particle As in this clause (as vnto the Lord) importeth so much. This verie conclusion is also inferred out of the place of a wife: In the same place that the Church is to Christ, a wife is to an husband: therefore such subiection as the Church yeel∣deth to Christ, must a wife yeeld to her husband; which the verie words of the Apostle doe expresly affirme. Now we Ephes. 5. 24. know that euerie Christian wife in her particular ought to yeeld that obedience to Christ which the Church in generall doth: therefore also she must yeeld such subiection to her hus∣band as she should to Christ. Quest. See §. 5. of this Treatise. What if an husband be an enemie of Christ? must such subiection be yeelded to an enemie of Christ as to Christ himselfe? Answ. Yea: because in his office he is in Christs stead, though in his heart an enemie. In this case will the wisdome, patience, and obedience of a wife be best tried. It is noted of the Church, that she is a Lilly among thornes. She remaineth Cant. 2. 2. Lilly-like, white, soft, pleasant, amiable, though she be ioyned with thornes, which are scraggie, prickly, sharpe: so a wife must be milde, meeke, gentle, obedient, though she be mat∣ched with a crooked, peruerse, profane, wicked husband: thus shall her vertue and grace shine forth the more clearely, euen as the stars shine forth most brightly in the darkest night. Among wiues Abigail deserueth great praise, that forgot not her dutie, though she were maried to a churlish, couetous, drunken sot, a verie Nabal in name and deed. As for those who take occasion from the wickednesse of their husbands to neglect their dutie, they adde to their crosse a curse: for a crosse it is to haue a bad husband, but to be a bad wife is a sinne, which pulleth downe a curse. Let wiues therefore remoue their eyes from the dispo∣sition of their husbands person, to the condition of his place: and by vertue thereof, seeing he beareth Christs image, be sub∣iect to him as vnto Christ. This generall conclusion might be applied to the matter of
subiection as well as to the manner, for the Church acknow∣ledgeth Christ her superiour, feareth him inwardly, reueren∣ceth him outwardly, obeyeth him also both by forbearing to doe what he forbiddeth, and also by doing what he comman∣deth, which points hauing beene before distinctly and largely handled and applied to wiues, I will not repeat them againe. Wherefore now to insist in the manner only, there are foure Foure graces needfull to season a wiues subiection. vertues which are especially needfull hereunto, whereby the Church seasoneth her subiection to Christ, and wiues also may and must season their subiection to their husbands. These are the foure, 1. Humilitie, 2. Sinceritie, 3. Cheerefulnesse, 4. Con∣stancie. §. 55. Of wiues Treat 4. §. 15. humilitie in euery duty. Humility is that grace that keepes one from thinking high∣ly of himselfe aboue that which is meet: and in regard of that meane conceit which he hath of himselfe maketh him thinke reuerendly, and highly of others: so as if humility be placed in a wiues heart, it will make her thinke better of her husband then of her selfe, and so make her the more willing to yeeld all subiection vnto him. The Apostle requireth it of all Phil. 2. 3. Ephes. 4. 2. Christians as a generall sawce to season all other duties: but af∣ter a peculiar maner is it needfull for inferiours: most of all for wiues, because there are See before §. 4. many prerogatiues appertaining to their place, which may soone make them thinke they ought not to be subiect, vnlesse they be humbly minded. That the Church doth herewith season her subiection, is cleare by the booke of Canticles, where oft she acknowledgeth her owne meannesse, and the excellency of her spouse. Therefore as the Church is humbly subiect to Christ, so let wiues be to their husbands. §. 56. Of wiues pride. Contrary is pride, which puffeth vp wiues, & maketh them thinke there is no reason they should be subiect to husbands, they can rule themselues well enough, yea and rule their hus∣bands too, as well as their husbands rule them. No more pesti∣lent vice for an inferiour, then this: it is the cause of all rebelli∣on, disobedience, & disloyalty: only by pride, commeth contention. Pro. 13. 10.
§. 57. Of Wiues Treat. 4. §. 63. sinceritie in euery dutie. II. Sincerity is that grace that maketh one to be within euen in truth, what without he appeareth to be in shew. This is that Ephes. 6. 5. Singlenesse of heart which is expresly required of seruants, and may be applied to wiues, for indeed it appertaineth to all sorts. Because it is only discerned by the Lord, who is the Acts 1. 24. searcher of all hearts, it will moue a wife to haue an eye to him in all she doth, and to endeuour to approue her selfe to him aboue all: therefore vprightnesse and walking before God are oft ioyned together: he that is vpright will assuredly walke before God, that is, endeuour to approue himselfe to God, as Gen. 6. 9. Noah did, and as & 17. 1. God commanded Abraham to doe. Though there were no other motiue in the world to moue her to subiection, yet for conscience sake to Christ she should yeeld it. 1 Pet. 3. 5. S. Peter testifieth of holy women, that they trusted in God and were subiect to their husbands: implying thereby, that their conscience to God made them be subiect to their hus∣bands. Was not Sarahs subiection seasoned with sinceritie, when Gen. 18. 12. within her selfe, in her heart she called her husband Lord? Great reason there is that wiues should in sincerity subiect Reasons for sincerity. themselues: for 1. In their subiection euen to their husbands they haue to 1 Because wiues haue to doe with Christ. doe with Christ, in whose roome their husbands stand: so as, though their husbands who are but men, see only the face and outward behauiour, yet Christ seeth their heart and inward disposition: though their husbands see only the things which they doe before their faces, and can heare only of such things as are done before others: yet Christ seeth and knoweth the things that are done in the most secret places that can be, when no creature beside themselues is priuie thereunto: Now let it be granted that in their outward carriage they giue very good contentment vnto their husbands, and please them euery way, yet if sinceritie haue beene wanting, with what face can they appeare before Christ? he will take another manner account of them: before Christ all their outward complement will stand them in no stead at all.
2. Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt true, Christian, 2. This ma∣keth a diffe∣rence betwixt holy women and others, religious wiues, and meere naturall women: these may be sub∣iect on by-respects, as namely, that their husbands may the more loue them, or liue the more quietly and peaceably with them, or that they may the more readily obtaine what they de∣sire at their husbands hands, or for feare of their husbands displeasure and wrath, knowing him to be an angry, furious man, so as otherwise it might be worse with them, they might want many needfull things, or carry away many sore blowes if they were not subiect. But the other haue respect to Christs ordinance, whereby their husbands are made their head, and to his word and will, whereby they are commanded subiecti∣on. Thus 1 Pet. 3. 5. holy women subiected themselues; they cannot be holy that doe not thus subiect themselues: for this is a sweet perfume that sendeth forth a good sauour into Christs nostrils, and maketh the things we doe pleasant and acceptable to him. 3. The benefit of this vertue being planted in a wiues heart 3. Great is the benefit hereof. is very great, and that both to her husband, and also to her selfe. To her husband, in that it will make her manifest her respect of him before others, behinde his backe, as well as before him∣selfe in his presence: and also will make her faithfull to him, and carefull to doe his will wheresoeuer he be, with her, or from her. To her selfe, in that it will minister inward sweet comfort vnto her, though her husband should take no notice of her subiection, or mif-interpret it, or ill requite it; for she might say as Hezekiah did, Isa. 38. 3. Remember ô Lord how I haue walked be∣fore thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is good in thy sight. That the Church doth season all her subiection with since∣ritie is cleare, in that she is said to be Psal. 45. 13. all glorious within: (there is no glory within, without sinceritie) and in that she is oft said Cant. 3. 1, 2. to seeke him whom her soule loued: if her soule loued him, in sinceritie of heart she was subiect to him: Therefore as the Church is sincerely subiect to Christ, so let wiues be to their hus∣bands.
§. 58. Of wiues complementall subiection. Contrary to sinceritie is dissimulation, and meere outward, complementall subiection: when a wife doth euen despise her husband in her heart, as Michal did Dauid and yet carry a faire 2 Sam. 6. 16. Pro. 30. 20. face before him, as that adulterous woman, who eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith I haue not committed iniquitie. Salomon maketh it a note of a lewd wife to flatter with her words. Pro. 2. 16. Though such a wife should performe all the duties named be∣fore, yet would those all be nothing to God, if they were done with a double heart, and not in singlenesse of heart. For as ma∣ny outward imperfections are pardoned by God, where since∣ritie is, so no outward actions are accepted of him though they seeme neuer so faire, where there is no sinceritie. §. 59. Of wiues Treat. 4. §. 65, 74. cheerefulnesse in euery dutie. III. Cheerefulnesse is more apparant then sinceritie, and maketh subiection the more pleasing not only to God, but also to man, who by the effects thereof may easily discerne it. For God, as he doth himselfe all things willingly and cheere∣fully, so he expecteth that his children should therein follow him, and thereby shew themselues his children. God loueth a 2 Cor. 9. 7. cheerefull giuer: not only a cheerefull giuer of almes, but of all dutie to God and man. For men, it maketh them also much better accept any dutie when they obserue it to be done cheerefully: this did euen ra∣uish Dauid with ioy, to see his people offer their gifts willingly 1 Chro. 29. 9. vnto the Lord: when an husband seeth his wife willingly and cheerefully performe her dutie, it cannot but raise vp loue in him. This cheerefulnesse is manifested by a ready, quicke, and speedy performance of her duty. Sarahs readinesse to obey, Gen. 18. sheweth that what she did, she did willingly. That thus the Church subiecteth her selfe to Christ is eui∣dent by that which Dauid saith, They shall be willing in the day Psal. 110. 3. of thy power. Therefore as the Church is cheerefully subiect vnto Christ, so let wiues be to their husbands. §. 60. Of wiues sullen and forced obedience. Contrary to this cheerefulnesse is the sullen disposition of some wiues, who will indeed be subiect to their husbands, and obey, but with such a lowring and sowre countenance,
with such powting and muttering, as they grieue their hus∣bands more in the manner, then they can be pleased with the thing it selfe that they doe: herein they shew themselues like to a curst cow, which hauing giuen a faire soape of milke, ca∣steth all downe with her heele, and so verifie the prouerbe, A good neuer a whit as neuer the better. Such subiection is in truth no subiection, it can neither be acceptable to God, nor pro∣fitable to their husbands, nor comfortable to their owne soules. §. 61. Of wiues Treat. 4. §. 72. constancy in doing their dutie. IIII. Constancy is a vertue which maketh all the rest per∣fect, and setteth the crowne vpon them; without which they are all nothing. This is in those who after they haue begun well, continue to doe well vnto the end, and thereby reape the fruit of all. It hath respect both to continuance without intermission, and also to perseuerance without reuolting, and giuing cleane ouer. So as it is not enough to be subiect by starts and fits: one while yeelding all good obedience, another while stout and rebellious: neither is it sufficient in former times to haue beene a good wife, and after proue bad: but there must be daily proceeding and holding on from time to time, so long as husband and wife liue together. This grace was in her of whom it is said, She will doe him good, and not euill all the daies of her life. Such were all the holy wiues commended in Scripture: among other particulars, mention is made of the wife of Phinehas, who on her death-bed shewed the reuerend 1 Sam. 4. 21. good respect she bare to her husband, though he were a wic∣ked and lewd man. This grace doth the Church adde to all her other vertues, she in all parts of her subiection remaineth con∣stant, & faithfull vnto the death, whereby it commeth to passe, that at length she receiueth the reward of her holy obedience, which is full and perfect communion and fellowship with her spouse Christ Iesus in heauen. In regard of her vnmoueable constancy it is said, that the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile a∣gainst Matth. 16. 18. her. Therefore as the Church is constantly subiect vnto Christ, so let wiues be to their husbands. §. 62. Of wiues repenting their former goodnesse. Contrary, 1. Intermission. Contrary to this Constancie is first intermission of duty, a re∣turning
to it, and a leauing it off by turnes: like one that is sicke of an ague, sometimes well, sometimes ill, one while hot, another while cold. That sometimes ceasing taketh away all the vertue, grace and glory, from sometimes doing. Besides, it is twenty to one that through the corruption of nature, that di∣uersitie and entercourse of fits at length will cease, and end in the worse. It is very likely that Michal was such an one: for one while she shewed her selfe so full of respect to Dauid, as 1 Sam. 19. 11, &c. for his sake she incurred the King her fathers displeasure: an∣other while in her heart she despised him, and with her tongue 2 Sam. 6. 16, 20. taunted him. Contrary also to the forenamed Constancy is Apostasie, 2. Apostasie. that is, a cleane relinquishing of the former good course, as if a wife repented her of her former good beginning. Such an one is she that is said to for sake the guide of her youth, and forget the Pro. 2. 17. couenant of her God. For ought we reade to the contrary, Iobs wife was such an one. And such are many who in their youn∣ger yeares, while their religious parents liued (as Ioash while 2 Chron. 24. 2. old good Iehoiada liued) haue behaued themselues very well like good dutifull wiues, but being grown to elder yeeres, haue growne also so stout and rebellious, as if they cleane repented themselues of their former good beginning. This reuolt ariseth sometimes from the euill counsell of wicked Gossips, and some∣times from their owne proud humour. I may say of these wiues subiection, as the Prophet saith of the righteousnesse of reuolters, Ezek. 18. 24. their subiection shall not be remembred, but in their rebellion they shall die. Therefore as the Church is subiect to Christ, let wiues be to their husbands. §. 63. Of the Treat. 4. §. 26. extent of a wiues obedience. The extent of a wiues subiection (which remaineth now to be handled) is set downe vnder these generall termes (in euery thing) which are not so generally to be taken as if they admit∣ted no restraint or limitation, for then would they contradict such cautions as these, in the feare of the Lord, as to the Lord, in Eph. 5. 21. & 22. Col. 3. 18. the Lord. For man is so corrupt by nature, and of so peruerse a disposition, that oft he willeth and commandeth that which is contrary to Gods will and commandement: which when he
doth, that Christian principle laid downe as a ruled case by the Apostle must take place, we ought rather to obey God then men. Acts 5. 29. Quest. Why then is this extent laid downe in such generall termes? Answ. 1. To teach wiues that it is not sufficient for them to obey their husbands in some things, as they themselues thinke meet, but in all things whatsoeuer they be wherein the husband by vertue of his superioritie and authoritie hath power to com∣mand his wife. Thus this generall extent excludeth not Gods will, but the wiues will. Shee may doe nothing against Gods will; but many things must she doe against her owne will if her husband require her. 2. To shew that the husbands authoritie and power is very large: it hath no restraint but Gods contrary command, whereof if a wife be not assured, she must yeeld to her husbands will. §. 64. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 28, 29. labouring to bring her iudgement to the bent of her husbands. From that extent I gather these two conclusions: 1. A wife must labour to bring her iudgement and will to her husbands. 2. Though in her iudgement she cannot thinke that most meet which her husband requireth, yet she must yeeld to it in practise. In the former of these, I say not simply that a wife is bound to bring her iudgement to the bent of her husbands; for he may be deceiued in his iudgement, and she may see his error, and then vnlesse her vnderstanding should be blinded, she cannot conceiue that to be true which he iudgeth so: but I speake of endeuour (when she hath not sure and vndeniable grounds to the contrary) to suspect her iudgement when its contrary to her husbands, and to thinke she may be in an error, and thereupon not be too per∣emptory and resolute in contradicting her husbands opinion. This submission euen of her iudgement respecteth not only things necessarie, for which her husband hath an expresse deter∣minate warrant out of the Scripture, but also things doubtfull & indifferent: for euen so farre doth this clause (in euery thing) extend: and the subiection of a wife respecteth not her practise only, but her iudgement and opinion also: which if she can bring to the lawfulnesse and meetnesse of that which her husband re∣quireth,
she will much more cheerefully performe it. To this purpose (as I take it) may be applied that exhortation of the Apo∣stle vnto women, that they learne in silence with all subiection: 1 Tim. 2. 11. which though it be principally meant of learning in the Church, yet it excludeth not her learning at home of her husband: for in the next words he addeth, I suffer not a woman to vsurpe authori∣tie ouer the man, but to be in silence. §. 65. Of wiues ouerweening conceit of their owne wisdome. Contrary is the presumption of such wiues as thinke them∣selues wifer then their husbands, and able better to iudge matters then they can. I denie not but that a wife may haue more vnder∣standing then her husband: for some men are very ignorant and blockish; and on the other side, some women well instructed, who thereby haue attained to a great measure of knowledge, and discretion; but many though they haue husbands of sufficient and good vnderstanding, wife and discreet men, yet thinke that that which they haue once conceiued to be a truth, must needs be so: and such is their peremptorinesse, that they wil not be brought to thinke that they may erre: but say they will neuer be brought to thinke otherwise then they doe, though all the husbands in the world should be of another opinion: not much vnlike to the Wisemans foole, who thinketh himselfe wiser then seuen men Pro. 26. 16. that can render a reason. §. 66. Of a wiues Treat. 4. §. 27. yeelding to her husband in such things as she thinketh not to be the meet est. The latter conclusion concerning a wiues yeelding in practise to that which her husband requireth, though she cannot bring her iudgement to thinke as he doth about the meenesse of it, Si res aliqua occurrat, quae consilio opus ha∣beat, quin ipsa quo{que} quid cen∣seas di as mini∣mè prohibe: sed viri tui senten∣tiam vim maio∣rem semper ob∣tinere volo. Gre. Naz. ad Olymp. hath respect to indifferent things, namely, to such as are neither in their particulars commanded, nor forbidden by God: as the outward affaires of the house, ordering it, disposing goods, en∣tertaining guests, &c. Quest. May she not reason with her husband about such mat∣ters as she thinketh vnmeet, and labour to perswade her husband not to persist in the pressing thereof, yea endeuour to bring her husband to see the vnmeetnesse (as she thinketh) of that which she seeth? Answ. With modesty, humilitie, and reuerence, she may so
doe: and he ought to hearken vnto her, as the husband of the Shunemite did, 2. King. 4. 23, 24. but yet, if notwithstanding all that she can say, he persist in his resolution, and will haue it done, she must yeeld. First, her subiection is most manifested in such cases: herein she apparantly sheweth, that what she doth, she doth in respect of her husbands place, and power: were it not for that, she would not doe it. Other things are not so euident proofes of her sub∣iection to her husband: for if he command her to doe that which God hath expresly commanded, and so she ought to doe it, whe∣ther her husband commanded it or no, it may be thought she doth it on Gods command, and not on her husbands. If her husband command her to doe that which God hath expresly forbidden, then ought she by no meanes to yeeld vnto it: if she doe, it may rather be termed a ioint conspiracie of husband and wife toge∣ther against Gods will (as S. Peter said to Sapphira the wife of Ananias, How is it that ye haue agreed together to tempt the Acts 5. 9. spirit of the Lord?) then subiection to the image of God in her husband. Secondly, her yeelding in indifferent things tendeth much to the peace of the family, as subiects yeelding to their Magistrates in such cases maketh much to the peace of the Common wealth. For in differencies and dissentions one side must yeeld, or else great mischiefe is like to follow: now of the two, who should yeeld but the inferiour? §. 67. Of wiues making their owne will their law. Contrary is the custome of many wiues, who neuer will doe any more then they themselues thinke meet, though their hus∣bands require it neuer so much: surely they come farre short of this Apostolicall extent (in euery thing) though in their own eies they may seeme to be very much subiect. But when wiues will no further be subiect, then their owne iudgments, wils and affections concurre with their husbands, what can be thought but that they are subiect rather to their owne wils, then to the will of their hus∣bands? Many such wiues, from the least difference in iudgement & opiniō, euen in the smallest matters, take occasion to refuse sub∣iection, and thinke they haue warrant enough so to doe: whence oftentimes there ariseth much contention, the fault whereof li∣eth
especially on the wiues necke, though the occasion may arise from the husband: and I thinke that wiues themselues would so iudge of the like cases betwixt them and their children. §. 68. Of care in choosing such husbands as wiues may without See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 11. griefe be subiect vnto. Obiect. If the case be such betwixt man and wife, it is not good to marry. Answ. This is no good inference; for all the seeming hard∣nesse of a wiues case is in the lewdnesse of an husband, who abu∣seth his place and power: and not in that subiection which is re∣quired by God. For if an husband carry himselfe to his wife as Tutū obsequium est, quoties qui dux est, ipse Dei Spiritu ducitur. God requireth, she will finde her yoke to be easie, and her sub∣iection a great benefit euen vnto her selfe. Wherefore I would exhort parties that are vnmaried, whether maidens or widowes, to be very carefull in their choise of husbands: and in their choise to respect aboue all, their good qualities and conditions, therein bearing the image of Christ, as well as in their office, and authoritie: so as their wiues may with ioy and comfort, not with griefe and anguish, be subiect vnto them: then will subiection proue a vexation, when the husband is an ignorant, profane, ido∣latrous, worldly, wicked man: wiues of such husbands are oft brought into many straits. Ye widowes and maidens who are free, be not too free and forward in giuing your consent to whom you know not: among other motiues, oft thinke of this point of subiection, to which all wiues are bound: this I say, both of the seuerall branches, and also of the extent thereof. After you are maried it is in vaine to thinke of freedome from subiection. By taking husbands, and giuing your selues to be wiues, you binde your selues to the law of the man, as long as he liueth. Then as you desire to be accepted of God, and to finde mercy and com∣fort from him, you must beare this yoke, how heauy and grie∣uous soeuer it seeme to be.
§. 69. Of the reasons to moue wiues to doe their duties. Hitherto of wiues duties: The reasons noted by the Apo∣stle to enforce those duties now follow. They are laid downe in these words. EPHES. 5. 22.—As vnto the Lord. Vers. 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, euen as Christ is the head of the Church: and he is the Sauiour of the bodie. Vers. 24. Wherefore as the Church is subiect, &c. THe maine ground of all the reasons which the Apostle here intimateth, is taken from the place wherin God hath set an husband, which is first by consequence implied in these words, as to the Lord: and then more plainly and directly ex∣pressed in these, the husband is the head of the wife. The particle prefixed before these words (for) being a causall coniunction, doth shew, that they are here set downe as a reason, which is first propounded vnder a metaphor (head) and then amplified by that resemblance which an husband hath therein vnto Christ (euen as Christ, &c.) which resemblance is further com∣mended by the vertue and benefit that proceedeth from the head-ship of Christ properly, and of an husband also by con∣sequence, in these words (and is the Sauiour of the bodie.) Vpon an husbands resemblance vnto Christ, he inferreth that a wife should haue a resemblance vnto the Church, and so concludeth, Therefore as the Church is in subiection to Christ, so let wiues be to their husbands. Out of the forenamed ground of a wiues subiection, and the seuerall amplifications thereof, and the inference thereup∣on made, fiue seuerall and distinct reasons may be gathered to enforce a wines subiection to her husband. The first is taken from an husbands place: he is in the Lords stead to his wife (as to the Lord.) The second from his office: he is an head to his wife. The chird from the image he beareth, or from the resemblance betwixt him and Christ (euen as Christ &c.)
The fourth from the benefit that his wife receiueth from him (he is the Sauiour &c.) The fift from the example and patterne of the Church (as the Church is in subiection, &c.) § 70. Of an husbands place. The place wherein God hath set an husband as it serueth 1. Reason. to direct a wife in the manner of her subiection, whereof I haue spoken §. 51. before, so also it serueth to moue a wife to yeeld such subiection as is required: which will euidently appeare by these two conclusions following from thence. 1. A wife by subiecting her selfe to her husband, therein is sub∣iect vnto Christ. 2. A wife by refusing to be subiect vnto her husband, therein refuseth to be subiect vnto Christ. That these two conclusions are rightly and iustly gathered from the forenamed ground I proue by like conclusions which the holy Ghost inferreth vpon the like ground. It is euident that Christ Iesus, euen incarnat and made flesh, was in the roome and stead of his father, whereupon Christ said to Philip that desired to see the father, he that hath seene me hath seene the father: Now marke what Christ thence inferreth both on Ioh. 14. 9. Mat. 10. 40. Ioh. 5. 23. the one side (he that receiueth me receiueth him that sent me) and on the other (he that honoureth not the sonne, honoureth not the father that sent him.) It is also euident that Ministers of the Gospell stand in the roome and stead of Christ: for thus saith the Apostle of himselfe and other Ministers, we are am∣bassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by vs, we pray you in Christs stead, &c. Now marke againe the conclusions inferred thereupon by Christ, on the one side, he that heareth Luk. 10. 16. you, heareth me, and on the other, he that despiseth you, despiseth me. On this ground it was that God said to Samuel concer∣ning the people that reiected his gouernment, they haue not cast thee away, but they haue cast me away. 1 Sam. 8. 7. To apply this reason, I hope such wiues as liue vnder the Gospell haue so much religion and piety in them as to ac∣knowledge, it becommeth them well to be subiect vnto the Lord Christ Iesus: here then learne one especiall and prin∣cipall part of subiection vnto Christ, which is to be subiect
vnto your husbands: thus shall you shew your selues to be the wiues of the Lord Christ, as the Apostle saith of obedient seruants, they are the seruants of God. 1 Pet. 2. 16. Againe I hope none are so void of all religion and piety as to refuse to be subiect vnto Christ: here then take notice, that if wilfully yee refuse to be subiect to your husbands, yee wilfully refuse to be subiect to Christ: fitly on this ground may I apply that to wiues, which the Apostle speaketh of sub∣iects, whosoeuer resisteth the power and authority of an husband, Rom. 13. 2. resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receiue to themselues iudgement. A strong motiue is this first motiue. If it were duly consi∣dered of wiues, they would more readily, and cheerefully be subiect, then many are; they would not so lightly thinke of their husbands place, nor so reproachfully speake against Gods Ministers who plainly declare their duty vnto them, as many doe. §. 71. Of an husbands office. The second reason is like vnto this taken from an husbands 2. Reason. 1 Cor. 11. 3. office, he is the wiues head: which is also vrged to this very pur∣pose in other places. This metaphor sheweth that to his wife he is as the head of a naturall body, both more eminent in place, and also more excellent in dignity: by vertue of both which, he is a ruler and gouernour of his wife. Nature teacheth vs that this is true of the head of a naturall body: and the Apostle by intituling an husband, an head, teacheth vs that it is as true of an husband: whence it followeth, that it standeth with common equity, and with the light of nature, that the wife should be subiect to her husband. This argument doth the Apostle in plaine termes vrge in another place, saying, doth not nature teach you, &c. 1 Cor. 11. 14. Goe therefore, ô wiues, vnto the schoole of nature, looke vp∣on the outward parts and members of your bodies. Doe they desire to be aboue the head? are they loth to be subiect vnto the head? Let your soule then learne of your body. Were it not monstrous for the side to be aduanced aboue the head? If the body should not be subiect to the head, would not de∣struction
follow vpon head, body, and all the parts thereof? As monstrous, and much more monstrous is it for a wife to be aboue her husband: and as great, yea and greater disturbance and ruine would fall on that family. The order which God hath set therein would be cleane ouerthrowne thereby: and they that ouerthrow it would shew themselues oppugners of Gods wisdome in establishing order. This reason drawne from nature is of force to moue very Pagans, and Sauages to yeeld subiection, how much more Christian wiues, it being also agreeable to Gods word, and ratified thereby? §. 72. Of the resemblance betwixt Christ and an husband. The third reason taken from an husbands resemblance vnto 3. Reason. Christ herein, addeth an edge vnto that former reason: in being an head, he is like Christ. So as there is a kinde of fel∣lowship and copartnership betwixt Christ, and an husband: they are brethren in office, as two kings of seuerall places. Obiect. There is no equality betwixt Christ the Lord from heauen, and an earthly husband: the disparity betwixt them is infinite. Answ. Yet there may be similitude, resemblance, and fel∣lowship: inequality is no hinderance to these. Two kings may be more different in estate then a subiect and a king; yet those two kings brethren and fellowes in office. There may be a resemblance where there is no parity, and a likenesse where there is no equality. The glorious and bright Sunne in the firmament, and a dimme candle in an house, haue a kinde of fellowship, and the same office, which is to giue light: yet there is no equality betwixt them. So then an husband re∣sembleth not only the head of a naturall body, but also the glorious image of Christ, and is that to his wife which Christ is to his Church. To apply this point, marke how from it two positions (wor∣thy to be noted) doe arise. 1. Subiection is due to an husband as well as to Christ. Subiection due to an husband as well as to Christ. I say not as great, because of the difference in glory: but as well, because of the likenesse in office. A Constable (though a poore meane man) must be obeyed as well as an high sherife: A beggars childe must obey his father, as well as a kings
childe. Such wiues therefore who are not subiect, wrong their husbands, as well as they wrong Christ who are not subiect to him. 2. They who by their subiection maintaine the honour of their husbands place, maintaine thereby the honour of Christs place: and againe by the rule of contraries, They who by refusing to be subiect impeach the honour of their husbands place, impeach there∣by the honour of Christs place. The obedience of a poore mans childe or seruant iustifieth that obedience which kings children and seruants owe their father and soueraigne: and so on the contrary, disobedience in meane ones, dishonoureth the place of great ones. The argument of Memucan drawne from the greater to the Est. 1. 16. lesse (in these words, Vashty the Queene hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and all the people) may be applied from the lesse to the greater. Disobedient wiues doe wrong not only to their owne particular husbands, but also to all heads, euen to Christ the head of the Church. If a naturall body, and the Church were flexible, and could be seduced, and drawne to presume, and rebell against their heads, the ill example of wiues were enough to moue them thereunto, for, as much as in them lieth, they by example se∣duce them. From the last forenamed positions (viz. that the obedience of a good wife maintaineth the honour of Christs place, and on the contrary side that the disobedience of an ill wife impaireth the honour thereof) I may iustly inferre two other conclusions. 1. That Christ will assuredly reward the good subiection of Christ will re∣ward the good subiection, and reuenge the rebellion of wiues. good wiues: for he hath said (and what he hath said he can and will performe) them that honour me will I honour. 2. That he will sorely reuenge the rebellion of euill wiues: for againe he hath said, they that despise me, shall be despised. We know that fellowes in office are ready to stand for the 1 Sam. 2. 30. credit of one anothers place, and to maintaine the honour thereof: and that not without good reason: for thereby they maintaine their owne honour and credit. Wherefore as good wiues may well expect a reward at Christs hands, howsoeuer their husbands respect their obe∣dience,
whether well or ill: (a great incouragement for wiues to performe their duties, though their husbands be neuer so ill) so euill wiues haue iust cause to feare reuenge at Christs hand, how soeuer their husbands beare with them. They who duly weigh this reason taken from that resem∣blance which is betwixt Christ and the Church, cannot but hold it to be a motiue of great moment. §. 73. Of the benefit which a wife hath by an husband. The fourth reason taken from the benefit which a wife recei∣ueth 4. Reason. from her husband, doth yet further presse the point in hand. Though Christ be properly the Sauiour of the bodie, yet euen herein an husband carieth a resemblance of Christ, and is after a manner a Saniour: for by vertue of his place and office he is on the one side her protector, to defend her from hurt, and preserue her from danger; and on the other side, a pronider of all needfull and necessarie things for her: in which respect she is taken from her parents and friends, and wholly committed Gen. 31. 14. to him: (as Iaakobs wiues said, Haue we any more portion or in∣heritance in our fathers house?) yea she her selfe, and all she hath is giuen to him: and he againe communicateth what soeuer he hath to her good, and for her vse. Dauid compareth a wife to Psal. 128. 3. a Vine, in relation to her husband: intimating thereby, that by him she is raised to that height of honour she hath, as a vine by the tree, or frame neere vnto which it is planted. By his ho∣nour is she dignified, by his wealth is she enriched. He is, vn∣der God, all in all to her; in the family he is a King to gouerne and aid her, a Priest to pray with her and for her, a Prophet to teach and instruct her. As the head is placed in the highest place ouer the bodie, and vnderstanding placed in it, to go∣uerne, direct, protect, and euerie way seeke the good of the bodie, and as Christ is vnited to the Church as a spouse, and made her head, that she might be saued, maintained, and pro∣uided for by him; so for this end was an husband placed in his place of superioritie; and his authoritie was committed to him, to be a Saniour of his wife. Wherefore if none of the for∣mer motiues preuaile with wiues, and moue them to be sub∣iect to their husbands, yet ought this. For from this reason flow these two conclusions.
1. The subiection required of a wife is for her owne good. 2. In refusing to obey she sheweth her selfe both vngratefull to her husband, and also iniurious to her selfe. That her subiection is for her owne good, is euident by this A wiues sub∣iection tend∣eth to her owne good. end for which an husband is made an head, to be a Saniour: not to puffe him vp, to make him insult and tyrannize ouer his wife. So as if she be subiect vnto him, she may reape much good from him. As the Church is wisely gouerned, and safely protect∣ed by subiecting her selfe to her head Christ Iesus; and as the bo∣dy partaketh of much good, and is preserued from much euill by subiecting it selfe to the head, so if a wife be subiect to her hus∣band, she will fare much the better thereby, all the ease, profit, and benefit thereof will be hers. If therefore she tender her owne good, this is a way and meanes ordained of God for this end; let her herein seeke it. If notwithstanding this she refuse to be subiect vnto her hus∣band, doth she not (as we say) stand in her owne light? She be∣ing by her sex the weaker, and the more vnable to helpe her selfe, f she shall reiect this good helpe which God hath prouided for her, is she not most iniurious to her owne selfe? And conside∣ring Gratitude re∣quireth a wife to be subiect. the care and pains her husband vndergoeth for her sake, is it not most vnnaturall and monstrous ingratitude, inwardly to de∣pise, or outwardly to scorne such an head? No better testimony f a gratefull heart can be giuen by a wife to her husband, then heerefull and ready subiection: and no greater ingratitude can e shewed, then rebellion, and disdaine. Now among vices in∣ratitude is one of the most odious to God and man: so as both o auoid the blacke spot of ingratitude, and to carry away the ame of gratefulnesse, ought wiues to be subiect. §. 74. Of the example of the Church set before wines. The last reason taken from the example of the Church is also 5. Reason. f good force to perswade wiues vnto subiection. Example more reuailes with many then precept. If any example may be of orce, then this most of all: for it is not the example of one only, ut of many; not of many ignorant, and wicked persons, but of understanding, wise, holy and righteous persons, euen all the aints that euer were, are, or shall be: for the Church compriseth l vnder it, euen that whole society of Saints, which are chosen
of God in his eternall counsell, redeemed of Christ by his preci∣ous bloud, and effectually called by the Gospell of faluation, Gods spirit working inwardly and powerfully vpon them, those very soules of iust and perfect men now triumphing in heauen, not excepted: note how this Church is described in the 26, and 27. verses. Let this example therefore be oft thought of: it will neuer repent any to follow it: for it treadeth the only right path to eternall glory, whereunto they shall assuredly come that follow it. But to shew the force of this reason a little more distinctly, note these two conclusions following from it. 1. Wiues are as much bound to be subiect to their husbands, as the Church to Christ. Else why should this example be thus set before them, and pressed vpon them? why are husbands set in Christs stead, and resembled to him? 2. A wiues subiection to her husband, answerable to the Chur∣ches subiection vnto Christ, is an euidence that she is of the Church, guided by the same Spirit that the Church is. For it cannot be performed by the power of nature, it is a supernaturall worke, and so an euidence of the Spirit. Wherefore, ô Christian wiues, as your husbands by their place resemble Christ, so doe you by your practise resemble the Church. Of the two this is the more commendable: for that is a dignitie, this a vertue: but true vertue is much more glorious then any dignitie can be. These reasons being well poised, and the force of them all ioyned together, they cannot but worke on the stoutest sto∣macke that is: wherefore if this point of subiection seeme to be too bitter a pill to be well digested, let it be sweetned with the syrupe of these reasons, and it will much better be swallowed, and haue the more kindly worke.
The fourth Treatise. Husbands Particular Duties. §. 1. Of the Generall Heads of this Treatise. EPHES. 5. 25, &c. Husbands loue your owne wiues, euen as Christ also loued the Church, &c. AS the wife is to know her dutie, so the hus∣band Husbands bound to du∣tie. Propterea de∣bent mulieribus suis ad virtutis exemplum se praebere, quia viri sunt. Aug. de adult. Con∣iug. l. 2. c. 8. much more his, because he is to be a guide, and good example to his wife, he is to dwell with her according to knowledge, (1 Pet. 3. 7.) the more eminent his place is, the more knowledge he ought to haue how to walke worthy thereof. Neglect of dutie in him is more dishonourable vnto God, because by vertue of his place he is 1 Cor. 11. 7. the Imag eand glory of God, and more pernicious not to his wife only, but also to the whole family, because of that power and authority he hath, which he may abuse to the maintenance of his wickednesse, hauing in the house no supe∣riour power to restraine his fury: whereas the wife, though neuer so wicked, may by the power of her husband be kept vnder, and restrained from outrage. Wherefore to goe on in order, in laying downe the husbands Husbands particular du∣ties. duties (as we haue the wiues) we are to consider, 1. The Duties themselues. 2. The reasons to inforce them. In setting downe the duties we must note 1. The matter wherein they consist.
2. The manner how they are to be performed. The Apostle compriseth the whole matter of them all vn∣der Loue, which is the summe and head of all. This we will first handle: and then proceed to other particulars. §. 2. Of that Treat. 3. §. 2. 1. Husbands must loue their wiues. loue which husbands owe their wiues. This head of all the rest, Loue, is expresly set downe, and alone mentioned in this, and in many other places of Scrip∣ture, whereby it is euident, that all other duties are comprised vnder it. To omit other places, where this dutie is vrged in Eph. 5. 25, 28, 33. this place, Loue is foure times by name expressed, beside that it is intimated vnder many other termes and phrases. Whosoeuer therefore taketh a wife, must, in this respect that she is his wife, loue her: as it is noted of Isaak (the best pat∣terne of husbands noted in the Scripture) Gen. 24. 67. he tooke Rebekah, she was his wife ana he loued her. Many good reasons hereof may be rendred. No dutie well performed without loue. 1. Because no dutie on the husbands part can be rightly performed except it be seasoned with loue. The Apostle ex∣horteth all Christians to doe all their things in loue: much more 1 Cor. 16. 14. ought husbands: though in place they be aboue their wiues, yet loue may not be forgotten. 2. Because of all persons on earth a wife is the most proper 2. A wife the most proper obiect of loue. Deut. 13. 6. obiect of loue: nor friend, nor childe, nor parent ought so to be loued as a wife: she is termed, the wife of his bosome, to shew that she ought to be as his heart in his bosome. 3. Because his place of eminency, and power of authority 3. Loue keepes a man from abusing his authority. may soone puffe him vp, and make him insult ouer his wife, and trample her vnder his feet, if a intire loue of her be not planted in his heart. To keepe him from abusing his authority is loue so much pressed vpon him. 4. Because wiues through the weaknesse of their sex (for 4. Loue ma∣keth him beare with her infirmities. 5. His loue draweth loue from her. they are the weaker vessels) are much prone to prouoke their husbands. So as if there be not loue predominant in the hus∣band, there is like to be but little peace betwixt man and wife. Loue couereth a multitude of imperfections. 5. Because as Christ by his loue first manifested prouoketh
the Church to loue him, so an husband by louing his wife should prouoke her to loue him againe: shewing himselfe like the Sunne which is the fountaine of light, and from which the Moone receiueth what light she hath: so he should be the foun∣taine of loue to his wife. Obiect. Loue was before laid downe as a common dutie ap∣pertaining both to man and wife: how is it then here required as a particular and peculiar dutie of an husband? Answ. In regard of the generall extent of loue it is indeed a common dutie belonging to the one as well as to the other, yea How loue is an husbands par∣ticular dutie. 1 Cor. 13. 5. belonging to all Christians, to all men: for it is the very na∣ture of loue, and an especiall property thereof, to seeke not her owne things, but the good of others, which all are bound to doe by vertue of the bond of nature; more then others, Christians by vertue of the bond of the spirit: among Chri∣stians, especially wiues and husbands by vertue of the matri∣moniall bond: of maried couples, most of all husbands by vertue of their place and charge. Their place is a place of au∣thoritie, which without loue will soone turne into tyrannie. Their charge is especially and aboue all, to seeke the good of their wiues: as wiues are the chiefest, and greatest charge of husbands, so their chiefest and greatest care must be for them: the parents and friends of wiues as they giue ouer all their au∣thority to their husbands, so they cast all care vpon them: wherefore that husbands may take the more care of their wiues, and the better seeke their good, they ought after a pe∣culiar manner to loue them. Husbands are most of all bound to loue: and bound to loue their wiues most of all. Thus this affection of loue is a distinct dutie in it selfe, pe∣culiarly Loue a com∣mon condi∣tion to be an∣nexed to eue∣rie dutie. appertaining to an husband: and also a common con∣dition which must be annexed to euery other dutie of an hus∣band, to season and sweeten the same. His looke, his speech, his carriage, and all his actions, wherein he hath to doe with his wife, must be seasoned with loue: loue must shew it selfe in his commandements, in his reproofes, in his instructions, in his admonitions, in his authoritie, in his familiaritie, when they are alone together, when they are in company before o∣thers, in ciuill affaires, in religious matters, at all times, in all
things: as salt must be first and last vpon the table, and eaten with euery bit of meate, so must loue be first in an husbands heart, and last out of it, and mixed with euery thing where∣in he hath to doe with his wife. §. 3. Of an husbands hatred and want of loue. Contrary hereunto is hatred of heart: which vice as it is Contrary, 1. Hatred. very odious and detestable in it selfe, so much more when the wife is made the obiect thereof. As loue prouoketh an hus∣band to doe his wife what good he can, so hatred, to doe her what mischiefe he can. Moses noteth a mans hatred of his Deut. 22. 13, &c. wife to be a cause of much mischiefe: for the neerer, and dea∣rer any persons be, the more violent will that hatred be which is fastened on them. Hence was it that a diuorce was suffered to be made betwixt Deut. 24. 3. a man and his wife, in case he hated her: which law question∣lesse was made for releefe of the wife, lest the hatred which her husband conceiued against her should worke her some mischiefe, if he were forced to keepe her as his wife: which Christ seemeth to imply in these words, Moses, because of the Mat. 19. 8. hardnesse of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wines. This therefore being so pestilent a poison, let husbands take heed how they suffer it to soake into them. Neither is it sufficient for an husband not to hate his wife, 2. Want of loue. for euen the want of loue, though it be only a priuation, yet is it a great vice, and contrary also to the forenamed dutie of loue. Where this want of loue is, there can be no duty wel performed, euen as when the great wheele of a clocke, the first mouer of all the rest, is out of frame, neuer a wheele can be in good order. They that thinke lightly hereof, plainly discouer that there is little or no loue of God in them at all: for if the Apostles infe∣rence be good, taken from a mans neighbour or brother whom 1 Ioh. 4. 20. he hath seene, it will much more be good hauing relation to a wife: for how can he who loueth not his wife, (whom God hath giuen to him as a token of his fauour, and as an helpe meet for him, to be in his bosome, and euer in his sight, yea to be no more two, but one flesh) loue God whom he hath not seene? If any man saith, he loueth God, and hate his wife, he is a lier. Let
husbands therefore by louing their wiues giue euidence that they loue God. §. 4. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 9. Branches of loue. wise maintaining his authoritie. All the branches which grow out of this root of loue, as they haue respect to husbands duties, may be drawne to two heads: 1. A wise maintaining of his authoritie. 2. A right managing of the same. That these two are branches of an husbands loue, is euident by the place wherein God hath set him, which is a place of au∣thoritie; for the best good that any can doe, and so the best fruits of loue which he can shew forth to any, are such as are done in his owne proper place, and by vertue thereof. If then an husband relinquish his authoritie, he disableth himselfe from doing that good, and shewing those fruits of loue which otherwise he might. If he abuse his authoritie, he turneth the edge and point of his sword amisse: in stead of holding it ouer his wife for her protection, he turneth it into her bowels to her destruction, and so manifesteth thereby more hatred then loue. Now then to handle these two seuerally, and distinctly: I. That an husband ought wisely to maintaine his autho∣ritie, II. Husbands must main∣taine their au∣thoritie. is implied vnder this Apostolicall precept, Husbands dwell with your wiues according to knowledge, that is, as such as are well able to maintaine the honour of that place wherein God 1 Pet. 3. 7. . hath set you: not as sots and fooles without vnderstanding. The same is also implied vnder the titles of preheminence which the Scripture attributeth to husbands, as Lord, Master, See Treat. 3. §. 3. Reasons. head, guide, image and glory of God, &c. The honour and authoritie of God, and of his Sonne Christ 1. Gods autho∣ritie maintai∣ned by the husbands. Iesus, is maintained in and by the honour and authoritie of an husband, as the Kings authoritie is maintained by the autho∣ritie of his Priuy Councell and other Magistrates vnder him; yea, as an husbands authoritie is in the family maintained by the authoritie of his wife: (for as the man is the glory of God, so 1 Cor. 11. 7. the woman is the glory of the man.) The good of the wife her selfe is thus also much promoted, 2. The wiues good promo∣ted thereby. euen as the good of the body is helped forward by the heads
abiding in his place; should the head be put vnder any of the parts of the body, the body and all the parts thereof could not but receiue much dammage thereby: euen so the wife and whole family would feele the dammage of the husbands losse of his authoritie. 1. Quest. Is it in the power of the husband to maintaine his owne authoritie? Answ. Yea, in his more then in any others: for note the It is in the mans power to maintaine his authoritie. 1 Tim. 4. 12. counsell of the Apostle to Timothie, (though in another case, yet very pertinent to this purpose) Let no man despise thy youth. It was therefore in Timothies power to maintaine his honour, and not to suffer it to be despised; and so is it in an husbands power. 2. Quest. How may an husband best maintaine his autho∣ritie? Answ. That direction which the Apostle giueth to Timothie How a mans authority may be well main∣tained. Ad viros per∣tinet virtute vincere, & ex∣emplo regere foe∣mina. Aug. de Adult. Coniug. lib. 2. cap. 8. to maintaine his authoritie, may fitly be applied for this pur∣pose vnto an husband; Be an ensample in conuersation, in loue, in spirit, in faith, and in purenesse: as if he had said, If thou walke before them worthy of thy place and calling, and wor∣thy of that honour and respect which is due thereunto, shew∣ing forth the fruits of loue, faith, and other like graces, assu∣redly they will reuerence thy youth; but if otherwise thou car∣rie thy selfe basely, and not beseeming a minister, thou giuest them iust occasion to despise thee. Euen thus may husbands best maintaine their authoritie by being an ensample in loue, grauitie, pietie, honesty, &c. The fruits of these and other like graces shewed forth by husbands before their wiues and family, cannot but worke a reuerend and dutifull respect in their wiues and whole house towards them: for by this means they shall more cleerely discerne the image of God shine forth in their faces. Obiect. Very goodnesse and grace it selfe is hated of wicked and vngodly wiues: it was an act of pietie that made Michal despise Dauid. Answ. 1. Grant it to be so: yet this may be a good direction for such husbands as haue not such wicked wiues. 2. This doth not alwaies so fall our, no, nor yet for the most
part in those that are wicked; true vertue and integritie doth oft cause admiration in such as loue it not. 3. Though some be of so crooked and peruerse a dispositi∣on as to take occasion of contempt, where none is giuen, yet shall that husband iustifie himselfe before God and man, that carryeth himselfe worthy of his place. §. 5. Of husbands losing their authoritie. Contrary is their practise who by their profanenesse, rio∣tousnesse, Contrary, 1. base carriage drunkennesse, lewdnesse, lightnesse, vnthriftinesse, and other like base carriage, make themselues contemptible, and so lose their authoritie: though a wife ought not to take these occasions to despise her husband, yet is it a iust iudge∣ment on him to be despised, seeing he maketh himselfe con∣temptible. Contrary also to the forenamed directions is the sterne, 2. Cruell dea∣ling. rough, and cruel carriage of husbands, who by violence and ty∣ranny goe about to maintaine their authority. Force may in∣deed cause feare, but a slauish feate, such a feare as breedeth more hatred then loue, more inward contempt, then outward respect. And contrary is their seruile disposition, who against their 3. Yeelding in vnlawfull things. owne iudgement yeeld to the bent of their wiues minde in such things as are vnlawfull: they will lose their authority ra∣ther then giue discontent to their wiues: which is a fault ex∣presly forbidden by the Dent. 13. 6, 7. law: and yet a fault whereinto not only wicked 1 King. 21. 7, 9. Ahab, but also wise Salomon fell: how hei∣nous a fault, and how grieuous a fall this was in Salomon, the fearefull issue thereof sheweth. Like to him not in wisdome, but in this point of egregious folly, are such as vpon their wiues 1 King. 11. 4. instigation, suffer Priests and Iesuites, to lurke and celebrate Masses in their houses, and yeeld to be present thereat them∣selues. Like to Ahab are such Magistrates as suffer their wiues to ouersway them in course of Iustice: hence it commeth to passe that more petitions and suites are made to the wiues of Magistrates in the cases of Iustice then to the Magistrates them∣selues: and the fauour of their wiues is more esteemed then their owne: so as the power of gouerning, and the maine stroke in determining matters, is from their wiues; they are but
the mouthes and instrument of their wiues, in so much as a∣mong the common people the title of their places and offices is giuen to their wiues. Some husbands suffer this by reason of their fearefull, and foolish disposition, wanting courage and wisdome to maintaine the honour of their places against the insolency of their wiues: others vpon a subtil, couetous, wicked minde, that by the meanes of their wiues there may be more freedome for receiuing bribes. Among these I may reckon those who against their owne minde, to satisfie their wiues minde, suffer both wiues and children to follow the fashion, to attire themselues vnbeseeming their places, to frequent light company, with the like; and also those who vpon their wiues importunitie are moued (as Sampson was) to reueale such se∣crets Maximè obser∣uate vos at{que} attendite ani∣m bus vestris ô viri ab vxoris concitationibus atque malis in∣stigationibus, per hanc enim in vltimo supplan∣tare Job visus est diabolus, &c. per istas etiam nunc plu∣rimos subuertit. Orig. in Ioh. lib. 2. as are not meet to be knowne. Husbands may hearken to their wiues mouing good things, but they may not obey them in euill things: if they doe, their fault is double: 1. in doing euill: 2. in losing their authoritie. Let husbands therefore be very watchfull against their wiues euill instigations. Satan laboured to supplant Iob by his wife: and by this doth he subuert many in these daies. §. 6. Of husbands Treat 3. §. 3. How a mans authority may be well ma∣naged. high account of wiues. As authority must be well maintained, so must it be well managed: for which purpose two things are needfull: 1. That an husband tenderly respect his wife. 2. That prouidently he care for her. An husbands tender respect of his wife is Inward. Outward.   Inward in regard of his Opinion of her. Affection to her.   Outward in regard of his cariage towards her. For an husbands opinion of his wife, two things are to be weighed, Her place, Her person.   1. Her place is indeed a place of inferiority, and subiection, yet the neerest to equality that may be: a place of common Husbands must account their wiues yoke-fellowes. 1 Pet. 3. 7. equity in many respects, wherein man and wife are after a sort euen fellowes, and partners: Hence then it followeth that The husband must account his wife a yoke-fellow and companion. This is one point of giuing honour to the wife: and it is im∣plied
vnder that phrase wherby the end of making a wife is no∣ted, Gen. 2. 18.  which in our English is translated, meet for him, word for word as before him that is, like himselfe, one in whom he might Eph. 5. 28. . see himselfe, or euen (to vse our Apostles word) himselfe. These phrases imply a kinde of fellowship: as also the many prero∣gatiues that are common to both, which haue beene noted Treat. 3. §. 4. before. As a wiues acknowledgement of her husbands superiority is the ground-worke of all her duties, so an husbands acknow∣ledgement of that fellowship which is betwixt him and his wife, will make him carry himselfe much more amiably, fa∣miliarly, louingly, and euery way as beseemeth a good husband towards her. §. 7. Of that fellowship which is betwixt man and wife, not∣withstanding a wiues inferiority. Obiect. Fellowship betwixt man and wife cannot stand with a wiues inferiority and subiection. Answ. They are of very meane capacity that cannot see how these may stand together. Is there not a fellowship be∣twixt superiour and inferiour magistrates in relation to their subiects? yea the Scripture mentioneth a fellowship betwixt Christ the head and other Saints in relation to the glory Rom. 8. 17. . whereof all are made partakers (for it termeth vs ioynt heires with Christ:) and in relation to Gods people a fellowship be∣twixt God and his ministers (for it termeth them labourers to∣gether 1 Cor. 3. 9. . with God) yet none can denie the Saints, and ministers to be inferiour and in subiection to Christ, and God. But di∣stinctly to answer the obiection. 1. There may not only be a fellowship, but also an equality in some things betwixt those that in other things are one of them inferiour and subiect: as betwixt man and wife in the power of one another bodies: for the wife (as well as the hus∣band) Vxor & serua & domina est viri, Chrysost. in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. is therein both a seruant, and a mistresse, a seruant to yeeld her body, a mistresse to haue the power of his. 2. There may be fellowship in the very same things where∣in is inferiority: for fellowship hath respect to the thing it selfe, inferiority to the measure, and manner: as in giuing light the Sunne and Moone haue a fellowship, but in the measure and
manner the Moone is inferiour: the Moone hath not so much light as the Sunne, and that which it hath it hath from the Sunne: and as in gouerning, the king and other magistrates haue a fellowship, but in the measure, and manner of gouern∣ment they are inferiour to him: Euen so is it betwixt man and wife, in many things wherein there is a fellowship, the wife is notwithstanding inferiour: so as inferiority may stand with fellowship. 3. There are no vnequals betwixt which there is so neere a parity as betwixt man and wife: if therefore there may be a fellowship betwixt any that are superiour, and inferiour one to another, then much more betwixt man and wife. Debet in vx∣orem vir domi∣nari, vt animus in corpus, cōsen∣tiens ei, & con∣spirans bene∣uolentia. Plut. praec. connub. As the soule therefore ruleth ouer the body, by a mutuall and louing consent and agreement, so must a man ouer his wife. §. 8. Of husbands too meane account of wiues. Contrary is the conceit of many who thinke there is no Non es domi∣nus sed mari∣tus: non an∣cillam sorti∣tus es, sed vxorem: gu∣bernatorem e Deus voluit esse sexus infe∣rioris, non prae∣potentem. Ambr. Hexaem. lib. 5. cap. 7. difference betwixt a wife and seruant but in familiarity: and that wiues were made to be seruants to their husbands, be∣cause subiection, feare and obedience are required of them: whence it commeth to passe that wiues are oft vsed little bet∣ter then seruants. A conceit and practise sauouring too much of heathenish, and sottish arrogancy. Did God at first take the wife out of mans side, that man should tread her vn∣der his feet? or rather that he should set her at his side next to him aboue all children, seruants, or any other in the family, how neere, or deare vnto him soeuer? for none can be neerer then a wife, and none ought to be dearer. §. 9. Of husbands good esteeme of their Treat 3. §. 5. IIII. Hus∣bands must account their owne wiues best for them. owne wiues. 2. For the person of a wife, An husband ought to esteeme that particular person to whom by Gods prouidence he is ioyned in ma∣riage, to be the fittest, and best for him. This is implied vnder that particle of restraint (OWNE) noted by the Apostle where he saith Eph. 5. 25. husbands loue your OWNE wiues, and againe presseth it vnder a comparison of the body (as Ves. 28. your OWNE bodies) Euery one thinketh his owne body best and fittest for him. A man might happily wish some defects or enormities in his owne body to be amended, and desire that his were like an
others, more strait, strong, and comely then his owne, yet would he not haue his head to be vpon that other mans body: the same opinion ought a man (that would loue his wife) to haue of her. Good reason there is for him so to doe: for true is the pro∣uerbe, Reason. Euery ones wife is proui∣ded by God. if it be rightly taken, mariages are first made in heauen, that is, God hath an ouer-ruling hand in ordering them: which Pro. 19. 14. Salomon implieth by that opposition which he maketh betwixt wealth and a wife: that is from our fathers, this from the Lord: in which respect he saith, & 18. 22. he which findeth a wife receiueth fauour of the Lord. If therefore thou art loued of God, and louest him, he will make thy wife proue a good thing to thee. Obiect. A wife may be a very lewd and wicked woman: how then can she be accounted the best wife? Answ. 1. It may be she was good enough when first she was brought to thee, but thou by thine euill example, or neg∣ligent gouernment, or hard vsage, hast made her so bad as she is. Which if it be so, then is she to be considered not as thou hast marr'd her, but as thou diddest marie her. 2. Though she be not in relation to other wiues the best in condition, yet in relation to thee she may be the best in euent: if not for thine ease and quiet, yet for triall of thy wisdome and patience: and so as Socrates in∣terrogatus qua gratia vxoris mores toleraret, respondit, vt gymnasium & palaestram phi∣losophiae domi habeam. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. a schoole of vertue she may be vnto thee. As Ars tua Ti∣phy iacet si non sit in aequore fluctus Ouid. de Trist. l. 4. eleg. 3. a skilfull pilots sufficiency is tried and knowne by tem∣pestuous seas, so a mans wisdome by a troublesome wife. Yea she may be giuen thee as a punishment of some former sinnes, as seeking after a beautifull, honourable, rich, proper wife, ra∣ther then a religious and honest one: or seeking her without any direction or helpe first sought of God, or otherwise then thou hast warrant from God, as by stealth, and without parents consent; or some other sinnes in another kinde, to bring thee to repentance: or as a meanes to restraine and weane thee from some future sinnes whereunto thou are subiect, and so proue a blessed crosse to keepe thee from a fearefull curse. §. 10. Of husbands preposterous opinion of their owne wiues. Contrary is a corrupt and peruerse opinion which many haue of their owne wiues, thinking them of all other the worst
and vnfittest; yea though they be such as euery way both in gifts and qualities of minde, and also in grace and comelinesse of body deserue all good respect and esteeme. Whereas others (which looke with a single eye) commend their good parts, they Misinterpret and misiudge all: if their wiues be religi∣ous, they thinke them hypocrites: if graue, sober and modest, melancholicke: if cheerefull, wanton: if they keepe at home, idle drones: if they take occasion (though neuer so iust) of go∣ing abroad, gadders, and lightfooted. This bad opinion of their wiues is a cause that their hearts are cleane remoued from their owne, and set vpon strange flesh: whereby the de∣uill gaineth what he desireth, that is, to put asunder such as God hath ioyned together, and to ioyne those whom God hath put asunder. §. 11. Of husbands Treat. 3. §. 7. V. Husbands must intirely delight in their wiues. intire affection to their wiues. An husbands affection to his wife must be answerable to his opinion of her: he ought therefore to delight in his wife intirely, that is, so to delight in her as wholly and only delighting in her: In this respect the Prophets wife is called the Ezec. 24. 16.  desire, or de∣light, or pleasure of his eyes: that wherein he most of all deligh∣ted, and therefore by a propriety so called. Such delight did Isaak take in his wife as it droue out a con∣trary strong passion, namely the griefe which he tooke for the departure of his mother: for it is noted that he Gen. 24. 67. loued her, and was comforted after his mothers death. This kinde of affection the wise-man doth elegantly set forth in these words, Reioyce with the wife of thy youth: Let her Pro. 5. 18, 19. expounded. be as the louing Hinde, and pleasant Roe, and be thou rauisht al∣waies with her loue. Here note both the metaphors, and also the hyperbole which are vsed to set forth an husbands delight in his wife. In the metaphors againe note both the creatures whereunto a wife is resembled, and also the attributes giuen to them. The creatures are two, an Hind and a Roe, which are the females of an Hart and a Roe-Bucke: now it is noted of the Hart and Roe-Bucke, that of all other beasts they are most ina∣mored (as I may so speake) with their mates, and euen mad againe in their heat and desire after them. These metaphors hath Salomon vsed to set forth that vnfai∣ned
and earnest, intire and ardent affection which an husband ought to beare vnto his wife: which being taken in a good sense, and rightly applied, so as they exceed not the bonds of christian modesty and decency, are very fit, and pertinent to the purpose: if we stretch them beyond modesty, we wrong the pen-man of them, or rather the Holy Ghost that direct∣ed him, and propound a pernicious patterne vnto husbands. The attributes giuen to the forenamed creatures much am∣plifie the point: the former is termed a louing Hind, the latter  Col. 1. 13. . a pleasant Roe, word for word an Hind of Loues, a Roe of fauour, that is, exceedingly loued and fauoured: (for to set forth the extent of Gods loue vnto his Sonne, Christ is called the sonne of his loue:) These comparisons applied to a wife, doe liuely set forth that delight which an husband ought to take in her, and yet is it much further amplified by the hyperbole vsed in this phrase, be thou rauisht with her loue, word for word erre thou in her loue,  by which no sinfull error, or dotage is meant, but a lawfull earnest affection: implying two things especially: First so far to exceed, as to make a man ouersee some such blemishes in his wife, as others would soone espie and mislike: or else to count them no blemishes, delighting in her neuer a whit the lesse for them. For example, if a man haue a wife, not very beautifull, or proper, but hauing some deformity in her body, some im∣perfection in her speech, sight, gesture, or any part of her bo∣dy, yet so to affect her, and delight in her, as if she were the fairest, and euery way most compleat woman in the world. Se∣condly, so highly to esteeme, so ardently to affect, so tenderly to respect her, as others may thinke him euen to doat on her. An husbands affection to his wife cannot be too great if it kept within the bonds of honesty, sobriety and comelinesse. The wiues affection ought to be as great to her husband, yet because of the husbands place of authority, he must especially take all occasions to manifest this his inward affection. Read the Song of Songs, and in it you shall obserue such affection manifested by Christ to his Spouse, as would make one thinke he did (with reuerence in an holy manner to vse the phrase) euen erre in his loue and doat on her. A good patterne and
president for husbands. For nothing is more louely them a Nihil viro vx∣ore bona ama∣bilius. Hier. in Ezec. 24. good wife. §. 12. Of the Stoicall disposition of husbands to their wiues. Contrary is the disposition of such husbands as haue no heat, or heart of affection in them: but Stoick-like delight no more in their owne wiues then in any other women, nor account them any dearer then others. A disposition no way warranted by the word. The faithfull Saints of God before mentioned, as also many other like to them, were no Stoicks, without all affection: nor did they thinke it a matter vnbeseeming them after a peculiar manner to delight in their wiues (witnesse Isaacks sporting with his wife) for this is a priuiledge which ap∣pertaineth Gen. 26. 8. to the estate of mariage. But that I be not mistaken herein, let it be noted that the affection whereof I speake is not a carnall, sensuall, beastly affection, but such an one as may stand with Christian grauitie and so briety: hauing relati∣on to the soule of a mans wife as well as to her body, groun∣ded both on the neere coniunction of mariage, and also on the inward qualities of his wife. Thus farre of an husbands inward respect of his wife. It followeth to speake of his outward cariage towards her. §. 13. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 10. kinde acceptance of such things as his wife doth. S. Peter giueth a generall rule for an husbands outward cariage to his wife, which is, that he dwell with her according to knowledge, that is, as a man able to order his cariage wisely to his owne honour and his wiues good, that so she may haue iust cause to blesse God that euer she was ioyned to such an hus∣band. Out of this generall these two branches sprout forth. 1. That an husband giue no iust offence to his wife. 2. That wisely he order that offence which is giuen by her. To auoid giuing of offence he must haue respect, 1. To that which she doth as duty to him. 2. To that which he doth as duty to her. In regard of the former two things are requisite:
1. That he kindly accept what she is willing and able to doe. 2. That he wisely commend and reward what she doth well. Thus hauing for orders sake laid downe these heads, I will distinctly handle the seuerall points. The first particular wherein an husband sheweth himselfe VI. Husbands must kindly accept euery good duty of his wife. Gen. 21. 8. to be a man of knowledge in walking before his wife, is by a kinde and respectiue acceptation of euery good duty which his wife performeth. Abraham in testimony of his good acceptance of Sarahs pains in nursing her childe, made a great feast when the childe was weined: and Elkanah on a like respect gaue liberty 1 Sam. 1. 23. to his wife to doe what seemed her best. A great incouragement must this needs be vnto wiues to be subiect vnto their husbands in all things, when they obserue no part of their subiection to be carelesly neglected, but rather graciously accepted: it quickens the spirit of a wife to thinke that her care and pains in pleasing her husband shall not be in vaine. §. 14. Of husbands sleighting and reiecting their wiues good∣nesse. Contrary is their practise who thinking all which a wife Contrary, 1. To take no notice of their wiues good∣nesse. doth to be but her duty, take little or no notice thereof; or if they cannot but take notice of it, yet lightly regard it, and sleightly passe it ouer. This oftentimes maketh a wife euen re∣pent the good she hath done, as Dauid repented the seruice 2. Sleightly to passe it ouer. 1 Sam. 25. 21. which he had done for Nabal. The truth is that wiues ought rather to looke vnto God for his acceptation then vnto their husbands: and though their husbands will take no notice, or not regard what good thing they doe, yet for conscience sake, and for the Lords sake to doe their duty: But yet notwith∣standing considering our weaknesse and backwardnesse vnto euery duty, it can not be denied but that an husbands sleight re∣garding of his wiues goodnesse is an occasion to make her wea∣ry thereof: and that he doth as much as in him lieth to make her repent thereof. But what may we say of such as scornfully reiect their wiues 3. Scornfully to reiect it. duty, yea like them the worse for making conscience thereof,
and so (cleane contrary to the rule of christianitie) ouercome goodnesse with euill? Surely they shew a very diabolicall spirit Rom. 12. 21. to be in them: and cannot but minister much griefe, and of∣fence to their wiues, and make that which they doe to be very irksome and tedious. Fathers ought not to prouoke their Ephes. 6. 4. children, much lesse husbands their wiues. §. 15. Of husbands Treat. 3. §. 11. 55. courteous accepting their wiues reue∣rend cariage. For the better conceiuing of this so needfull a point I will How a mans good accep∣tance of his wiues duty is manifested. somewhat more particularly and distinctly applie the same to the seuerall duties of a wife: which were drawne to two heads Reuerence. Obedience. For the first, if a wife manifest her dutifull respect of her 1. By answe∣ring reue∣rence with courtesie. Depone asperi∣tatem morum cum tibi sedula vxor occurrit, &c. Ambr. Hexaem. lib. 5. cap. 7. husband by any reuerend behauiour, gesture, or speech, he ought to meet her (as we say) in the middest of the way, and manifest his gratious acceptance thereof by some like cour∣teous behauiour, gesture, and speech, being seemely, not foolish. Obiect. Thus shall an husband abase himselfe, and disgrace his place. Answ. The courtesie which I speake of as it commeth from a superiour, being a meere voluntary matter and a token Courtesie may stand with superio∣rity. of kindnesse and fauour, is no abasement of himselfe, but an aduancement of his inferiour: a great grace to her, no dis∣grace to him. Abram was counted of the Hittits a Prince of Gen. 23. 6, 7. God, yet in communing with them he bowed vnto them. It is noted as a commendable thing in Esau, that though at that time he was his brothers superiour (at least he tooke himselfe so to be) yet obseruing how Iaakob reuerenced him, bowing seuen times to the ground, he ranne to meet him, and embraced Gen. 33. 3, 4. him, and fell on his necke. Most pertinent to the point is the example of King Ahashverosh, who beholding Esthers reue∣rend Esth. 5. 2. standing before him, held out his Scepter vnto her, which in a King is great courtesie. But to put the matter out of all question, let the example of Christ noted in Salomons song be obserued, and we shall finde his courtesie euery way answering the reuerence of his Spouse.
§. 15. Of husbands too great loftinesse. Contrary is a loftie carriage of husbands to their wiues, who ouerlooke all reuerence shewed by wiues, no more re∣specting their wiues in this case, then children or seruants: or then Kings doe respect the reuerence of their subiects. Oft haue I noted that there is a great difference betwixt a wife and all other inferiours, in which respect all euidences of reuerence should much better be respected; yet we know that Kings and Queenes will put out their hands to be kissed by their subiects when they kneele before them, which is a token of courtesie: how much more ought husbands to shew cour∣tesie? Vnworthy they are to be reuerenced of their wiues, who too Lord-like ouerlooke them. §. 16. Of husbands Treat. 3. §. 15. ready yeelding to their wiues humble suits. Againe, it being a token of reuerence in a wife humbly to 2. By granting her humble request. make knowne her desire to her husband, he ought to shew so much courtesie as readily to grant her desire: this courtesie the forenamed Est. 5. 3. Ahashuerosh afforded to Esther: 1 King. 1. 28. &c. Dauid to Bathsheba: Gen. 28. 1. Isaak to Rebekah: & 16. 6. Abraham to Sarah, and ma∣ny other husbands to their wiues. & 21. 10. 11. Abraham shewed herein such respect to his wife, that though the thing which she de∣sired were grieuous to him, yet he yeelded to his wife. Obiect. God first commanded him so to doe. Answ. This addeth the more force vnto the argument, shewing that it is Gods expresse will, that an husband should shew this kinde of courtesie to his wife. Much more ought a man to doe at his wiues request then at any others, whether friend, childe, or parent: yea much more free, forward and cheerefull ought he to shew himselfe in granting his wiues re∣quest then any others: prouided notwithstanding that her desire be of that which may lawfully be granted: to yeeld in things vnlawfull is to lose his authoritie, as was shewed §. 5. before. §. 17. Of husbands harshnesse to their wiues. Contrary is the harshnesse of their disposition who yeeld to their wiues request as an hard-milch-cow letteth downe her milke, not without much adoe: whereby the grace of all their
yeelding is taken away. There can be no courtesie in yeelding, when it is against their minde and will forced from them: their wiues must aske, and intreat againe and againe, yea be forced to vse the mediation of others to perswade their hus∣bands to yeeld to their request before they will yeeld, if at all they yeeld. What is this but to proclaime to all the world that there is no affection in them to their wiues? If a wiues breath be strange to her husband, assuredly his heart is first strange to her: which is the readie way to make him set his heart on strange women. §. 18. Of husbands Treat. 3. § 38, 39, &c. & §. 43 44, &c. forbearing to exact all that they may. As a wiues reuerence so also her obedience must be answered with her husbands courtesie. In testimony whereof, An hus∣band 3. By accep∣ting what she is willing to doe. must be ready to accept that wherein his wife sheweth her selfe willing to obey him. He ought to be sparing in exacting too much of her: in this case he ought so to frame his cariage to∣wards her, as that obedience which she performeth, may ra∣ther come from her owne voluntary disposition, from a free conscience to God-wards, euen because God hath placed her in a place of subiection, and from a wiue-like loue, then from any exaction on her husbands part, and as it were by force. Husbands ought not to exact of their wiues, whatsoeuer 4. By forbea∣ring to exact too much. wiues ought to yeeld vnto if it be exacted. They must obserue what is lawfull, needfull, conuenient, expedient, fit for their wiues to doe, yea and what they are most willing to doe before they be too peremptorie in exacting it. For example. 1. Though the wife ought to goe with her husband, and 5. By suffering her to dwell where it is meetest for her. dwell where he thinkes meet, yet ought not he (vnlesse by vertue of some vrgent calling he be forced thereto) remoue her from place to place, and carrie her from that place where she is well setled without her good liking. Gen. 31. 4, &c. Iaakob consulted with his wiues, and made try all of their willingnesse, before he carried them from their fathers house. 2. Though she ought cheerefully to entertaine what guests 6. By forbea∣ring to tire her with guests. he bringeth into the house, yet ought not he to be grieuous and burdensome therein vnto her: the greatest care and pains for entertaining guests lyeth on the wife: she ought therefore to be tendred therein.
If he obserue her conscionable and wise, well able to ma∣nage 7. By suffering her to manage the affaires of the house. and order matters about house, yet loth to doe any thing without his consent, he ought to be ready and free in yeelding his consent, and satisfying her desire, as 1 Sam. 1. 23., Elkanah: and if she be bashfull and backward in asking consent, he ought volunta∣rily of himselfe to offer it: yea and to giue her a generall con∣sent to order and dispose matters as in her wisdome she seeth meet, as the said Elkanah did: (Doe (saith he to his wife) what seemeth thee good:) and Pro. 31. 11. the husband of that good house∣wife which Salomon describeth. A generall consent is especially requisite for ordering of houshold affaires: for it is a charge laid vpon wiues to 1 Tim. 5. 14. . guide the house: whereby it appeareth that the businesses of the house appertaine, and are most proper to the wife: in which respect she is called the Materfami∣lias. hous-wife: so as therein husbands ought to referre matters to their ordering, and not restraine them in euery particular matter from doing any thing with∣out a speciall licence and direction. To exemplifie this in What things are to be put to the wiues disposing. some particulars, it appertaineth in peculiar to a wife, 1. To Pro. 31. 21, 22. order the decking and trimming of the house. 2. To Uers. 15. dispose the ordinary prouision for the family. 3. To Gen. 16. 6. rule and gouerne maid seruants. 4. To 1 Tim. 5. 10. Tit 2 4. bring vp children while they are young, with the like. These therefore ought he with a generall consent to re∣ferre to her discretion: with limitation only of these two 2 King. 4. 19. cautions. 1. That she haue in some measure sufficient discretion, Cautions a∣bout referring matters of the house to the wiues orde∣ring. wit, and wisdome, and be not too ignorant, foolish, simple, lauish, &c. 2. That he haue a generall ouersight in all, and so interpose his authority as he suffer nothing that is vnlawfull or vnseem∣ly to be done by his wife about house, children, seruants, or other things: for 1. The generall charge of all lieth principally vpon him. 2. He shall giue an account vnto God for all things that are amisse in his house. 3. The blame of all will also before men lie vpon him. But those two cautions prouided, he ought together with
his generall consent Pro. 31. 11. put trust in his wife, (as Gen. 39. 6. Difference betwixt the trust put in a wife, and in others. Potiphar did in Ioseph) making herein a difference betwixt a wife, and all others whether children of yeeres, friends, or seruants whom he imployeth in his affaires. Them in euery particular he may direct for matter and manner, and take a strait account of them for expences laid out, or other things done: because what they doe is wholly and only for another. To his wife (who is a ioynt parent of his children, and gouernour of his house, to whose good the husbands wealth redoundeth, and in that re∣spect doth for her selfe that which she doth for her husband) greater liberty, and licence must be giuen. §. 19. Of husbands too much strictnesse towards their wiues. Contrary is the rigour and austeritie of many husbands, who stand vpon the vttermost step of their authoritie, and yeeld no more to a wife then to any other inferiour. Such are they 1. Who are neuer contented or satisfied with any dutie the In what things an husband manifesteth too much strictnesse. wife performeth, but euer are exacting more and more. 2. Who care not how grieuous and burdensome they are to their wiues: grieuous by bringing such guests into the house as they know cannot be welcome to them: burdensome by tu frequent, and vnseasonable inuiting of guests, or imposing o∣ther like extraordinary businesses, ouer and aboue the ordina∣ry affaires of the house. Too frequent imposing of such things, cannot but breed much wearisomnesse. Vnseasonable (as when the wife is weake by sicknesse, childe-bearing, giuing sucke or other like meanes, and so not able to giue that contentment which otherwise she would) cannot but much disquiet her, and giue her great offence. 3. Who hold their wiues vnder as if they were children or seruants, restraining them from doing any thing without their knowledge and particular expresse consent. 4. Who are ouer busie in prying into euery businesse of the house, and will haue their hand in all. Besides that such hus∣bands afford no opportunity to their wiues of giuing proofe of that vnderstanding, wit, wisdome, care, and other gifts which God hath endowed them withall, they take away that maine end for which a wife was giuen a man, namely, to be a
helpe. Such husbands cannot but neglect other more weighty Gen. 2. 18. matters, which more properly belong vnto them. For obserue it and you shall finde, that such husbands as are most busie about the priuate affaires of the house appertaining to their wiues, are most negligent of such affaires as appertaine vnto themselues: they thinke they walke in integrity, but yet are they not iust nor wise therein: for the iust man walketh in HIS inte∣grity, Pro. 20. 7. & 14. 8. and the wisdome of the prudent is to vnderstand HIS way: (i.) that integrity which appertaineth to his owne peculiar place; and his owne way: but euery foole will be medling, name∣ly, with things not belonging to his place. & 20. 3. 5. Who are ouer suspicious of their wiues, and thereupon ouer strickt in taking account of them. S. Paul calleth surmi∣zes 1 Tim. 6. 4. euill, and that not without iust cause: for euill they are in their nature, and euill in their effects, being occasions of many mischiefes: but in none so euill as in husbands ouer their wiues. If a wiues fidelity (to whose good the welfare of the family, and increase of the stocke redoundeth as well as to the hus∣bands) be without iust cause suspected, who shall be trusted? It is the ouerthrow of many families, that seruants are trusted, and not wiues. Thus farre of an husbands kinde acceptance of that which his wife is willing and able to doe. §. 20. Of Husbands encouraging their wiues in good things. The loue which an husband oweth to his wife, further re∣uireth Husbands must com∣mend and re∣ward good things in their wiues. that he wisely commend and reward what she hath well one. That which the Apostle faith of the Magistrates authori∣ty, may fitly be applied to an husbands in relation to his wife, Doe that which is good, and thou shalt haue praise of the same. It is expresly noted in the description of a good husband, a Rom. 13. 3. hat he praiseth his wife: and in that he saith, Vers. 31. Giue her of the b Prou. 31. 28, 29. uit of her hands, it is implied also that he rewardeth her. This is an vndoubted euidence of his good acceptance of er duty, and a further incouragement to stir her vp to goe on and continue in well doing. Yea this is also an euidence of his by and delight both in her person, and also in her well doing.  there be no delight in ones person, well doing will rather
stir vp enuy then ioy: and they that enuy a mans well doing, will neuer commend, or reward him for it. In an husbands commending of his wife this caueat must be put: that he so order his commendation as it sauour not of flattery, or dotage: nor yet Lege apud T. Liv. Dec. 1. l. 1. quid inde eve∣nit, quòd regij iuuenes suam quis{que} vxorem miris modis lau∣dare. stir vp lust or enuy in others. §. 21. Of husbands vngratefull discouraging their wiues. Contrary is an vngratefull, if not enuious disposition of such Quisque suam laudot, studijs certamina cres∣cunt. Ouid. Fast. lib. 2. husbands, as passing by many good things ordinarily and vsu∣ally euery day done by their wiues without any approbation, commendation or remuneration, are ready to dispraise the least slip, or neglect in them; and that in such generall termes as if they neuer did any thing well, so as their wiues may well com∣plaine and say as it is in the prouerbe, Oft did I well, and that heare I neuer: Once did I ill, and that heare I euer. Yet such will be ready to praise other mens wiues, and vp braid their owne wiues with the examples of those other, when their owne doe farre excell them in all kinde of goodnesse. What doth this shew but that either they take no notice of their own wiues goodnesse, or else by reason of the commonnesse there∣of little regard it? If their wiues haue not the more grace in them, this disposition is enough not only to discourage them from doing any good duty, but also to breed iealousie in them, and to alienate their hearts from them. §. 22. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 10. mildnesse. Hitherto of that respect which an husband is to haue of that duty which his wife performeth to him. For auoiding iust offence, an husband must further haue good respect to that which as duty he doth to his wife. As kindly he must accept duty at his wiues hands, so mildly he must performe that Oportet virum praecsse vxori oblectando, & indulgendo. Plut. praec. Con∣nub. duty which he oweth to her. This mildnesse is an especiall fruit, and euidence of loue, and a notable meanes to take away all offence that otherwise might be taken from many things which he doth. Sugar and Hony are not more pleasant to the tongue, then mildnesse to the heart; it causeth such things as otherwise are irksome and grieuous to the soule, to be well taken and applied, euen as bitter pils dipt in sweet syrrop, or rolled vp in the soft pap of
an apple, are soone swallowed downe and well digested. If an husband desire to be accounted a seruant of the Lord he must learne this lesson: For the seruant of the Lord must be gentle to all men. If any other seruant of the Lord, much more hus∣bands: 2 Tim. 2. 24. if to all men, most of all to their wiues: and that in ma∣ny respects. 1. Because of the neere vnion betwixt man and wife. 2. Because of the ioynt authority she hath with him ouer others: that herein he may be a president and example to her. 3. Because of her weaknesse: glasses are tenderly handled: a small knocke soone breakes them. §. 23. Of husbands bitternesse. Contrary is bitternesse, a vice expresly forbidden, and that in particular to husbands. A vice that cannot stand with an hus∣band-like loue: whereupon the Apostle commanding the one forbiddeth the other, Loue (saith he) and be not bitter. Nothing Col. 3 19. more turneth the edge of his authority, peruerteth the vse of his gouernment, prouoketh the stomacke of his wife, maketh his words and deeds lesse regarded, then bitternesse. It is as gall and wormwood mixed with sweet and wholesome meats, which causeth that they cannot be well digested, but with vio∣lence are spit out againe so soone as euer they be tasted. Men in authority are much prone hereunto: and therefore O husbands be so much the more watchfull against it, loue your wiues and be not bitter vnto them. §. 24. Of the Treat. 3. §. 13. 14. Wherein a husbands mildnesse is manifested. Titles which an husband giueth to his wife. The forenamed mildenesse of an hus∣band must be manifested in his Speech, Cariage.   For so far as reuerence extends it selfe in the duties of wiues, must mildnesse be extended in the duties of husbands. Whether an husbands speech be to his wife before her face, or of her Of his speech about her be∣hinde her backe, See Treat. 2. Part. 2. §. 36. The speech of husbands to their wiues sweetned with mildnesse. behinde her backe, it must be sweetned with mild∣nesse. 1. For his speech to her, 1. The titles wherewith he cal∣leth her. 2. The instructions which he giueth her. 3. The commandements which he layeth vpon her. 4. The reproofes wherewith he checketh her, must all be mixed with mildnesse. Among other titles, the most ordinary and vsuall title (wife) 1. Mild and kinde titles.
is a milde and kinde title, and least offensiue of all other: if an husband giue any other title to his wife, it must be such an one as manifesteth kindnesse, familiaritie, loue, and delight. Such are all the titles which Christ giueth to the Church, as Spouse, Loue, Doue, with the like. I doe not deny but that in the Song of Salomon, and in other places of Scripture many titles are giuen and speeches vsed by Christ to the Church which are not meet to be vsed by husbands to their wiues, be∣cause they are metaphoricall, and hyperbolicall: but yet in them all we may obserue tokens of amiablenesse, kindnesse, and mildnesse, which is the end for which I haue alledged his example. But contrary are such titles as on the one side set the wife Contrary, vn∣seemely titles. in too high a place ouer her husband, as Lady, Mistresse, Dame, Mother, &c. And on the other side set her in too meane a rancke, as woman, wench, &c. And their Christian names contracted, as Sal, Mal, Besse, Nan. &c. and names of kindred, as Sister, and Cosen: and, opprobrious names, as stut, drab, queant; and names more befitting beasts then wiues, as Cole, Browne, Muggle, &c. Obiect. These are titles of mildnesse, kindnesse, and much familiarity: for husbands call their wiues by these names, not when they are angry with them and displeased, but ordinarily, and vsually, euen when they are best pleased. Answ. The mildnesse and familiarity which is required of an husband must be such as may stand with his authority and place of eminency (as some of those names doe not,) and with that neere coniunction which is betwixt man and wife about all others (as other doe not,) and with Christian grauity and discretion (as other doe not.) Christians therefore must take heed that by their practise they iustifie not corrupt customes. §. 25. Of an husbands manner of instructing his wife. 2. To instruction the Apostle expresly annexeth meeknesse, Instruction to be giuen with meeknesse. Instruct (saith he) with meekenesse, those that oppose themselues. If ministers must vse meekenesse when they instruct their peo∣ple, much more husbands when they instruct their wiues: if 2 Tim. 2. 25. . in case of opposition meekenesse must not be laid aside, then in no case, at no time.
In this case to manifest meekenesse, let these rules be ob∣serued. Directions to instruct with meekenesse. 1. Note the vnderstanding and capacity of thy wife, and accordingly fit thine instructions: if she be of meane capacity, giue precept vpon precept, line vpon line, here a little and there a little: a little at once oft giuen (namely euery day some∣thing) will arise in time to a great measure, and so arise, as, to∣gether with knowledge of the thing taught, loue of the person that teacheth will increase. 2. Instruct her in priuate betwixt thy selfe and her, that so her ignorance may not be blazed forth: priuate actions pas∣sing betwixt man and wife are tokens of much kindnesse and familiarity. 3. In the family so instruct children and seruants when she is present, as she may learne knowledge thereby: there can be no more meeke and gentle manner of instructing, then by one to instruct another. 4. Together with thy precepts mixe sweet and pithy per∣swasions, Contrary, harshnesse. which are testimonies of great loue. Contrary is an harsh and rough manner of instructing, when husbands goe about to thrust into their wiues heads, as it were by violence, deepe mysteries which they are not able to conceiue, and yet if they conceiue not, they will be angry with them, and in anger giue them euill language, and proclaime their ignorance before children, seruants, and stran∣gers. This harshnesse is ordinarily so fruitlesse, and withall so exasperateth a womans spirit, as I thinke he were better cleane omit the duty then doe it after such a manner. §. 26. Of an husbands manner of Treat. 3. §. 43, 51, 52. 63, 64. &c. Commande∣ments to be ordered with mildnesse. commanding his wife any thing. 3. The commandements which an husband giueth to his wife, whether they be affirmatiue (bidding her to doe some∣thing) or negatiue (forbidding her to doe this or that) must all be seasoned with mildnesse. For which end respect must be had to the matter and manner of his commandements. In regard of the matter the things which he commandeth What things he may com∣mand his wife. his wife to doe, must be 1. Such as are indeed lawfull and honest.
2. Such as she is perswaded to be so. 3. Such as beseeme her place. 4. Such as are of weight and moment. And on the contrary, the things which he forbiddeth must be 1. Such as are indeed vnlawfull to be done. What things he may for∣bid his wife. 2. Such as he can euidently proue vnto her to be vnlawfull. 3. Such as are vnbeseeming her place. 4. Such as will haue some euill and mischieuous effect if they be done. 1. To command a thing vnlawfull, or forbid a thing which ought to be done, is to bring his owne authority into oppo∣sition with Gods: in which case he bringeth his wife into this strait, either to reiect Gods commandement or his. How then can she thinke that her husband loueth her, when he bringeth her into such snares and straits, that she must needs fall into the gulfe of Gods displeasure, or knocke against the rocke of her husbands offence? Mildnesse is farre from such commandements. 2. The like may be said of such things as to a wiues con∣science Such things as a wife maketh doubt of, not to be pressed vpon her. seeme to be sinnefull, if they be enioyned to her; or her bounden duty, if they be forbidden: especially if she haue any ground for her conscience out of Gods word. The con∣science is subiect to God alone: if it be forced it will be a feare∣full horror, and a very hell in that party whose conscience is forced: She that doubteth is condemned if she doe that whereof Rom. 14. 23. she maketh doubt. 1. Obiect. In doubtfull matters the commanding power Of what doubtfull things the commanding power of a gouernour may be a warrant. of a gouernour is sufficient warrant and ground to resolue the conscience of them that are vnder authority. Answ. 1. In things meerely doubtfull concerning which the partie in subiection hath not warrant out of Gods word one way or other, it may be so. But when the conscience doth not doubt and hang in suspence, but is out of some ground taken from Gods word perswaded that that which is com∣manded is vnlawfull, or that which is forbidden is a bounden dutie, then to doe this, or to leaue that vndone, is to the party so perswaded a sinne: and this is the doubting (whereof the
Apostle speaketh) that condemneth a man. In this case to vrge a wife to doe this, or not to doe that, is to vrge her to sinne: which a milde spirit and louing heart will not doe. 2. Though the husbands command be sufficient warrant to the wife, and if he peremptorily presse her to this or that, she ought to yeeld, yet the loue and mildnesse required of an husband should make him so to tender her as to remit some∣thing of his power, and when he seeth her conscience troub∣led about his command, to releeue her conscience by for bea¦ring to presse that which seemeth so burthensome to her. A husband may sinne in pressing that too much vpon his wife, which she vpon his pressing may without sinne yeeld vnto. §. 27. Of an husbands Treat. 4. §. 66. wise carriage when his wife is erro∣neeusly scrupulous. 2. Obiect. What if an husband vpon his knowledge ob∣serue his wife to be erroneously scrupulous, and to misinter∣pret and misapply the word of God which she maketh the ground of her scruple? Answ. He must first labour to resolue her conscience by a plaine discouery of her error; which is a true and a great token of loue: if notwithstanding all that he can doe in that kinde she cannot be brought to yeeld to that which he would haue, then he must carefully obserue these two things. 1. Whether her refusing to yeeld, be an obstinacy, or weakenesse. 2. Whether it be about a sleight or weighty matter. By the reasons which she rendreth, and her manner of pres∣sing How a wiues refusing to yeeld may be discerned to be on obsti∣nacy or weakenesse. them, he may discerne whether weakenesse or obstinacy make her stand out against him: if the reason which she resteth on taken from Gods word be doubtfull, and to one that hath not a good sound iudgement, and a sharpe discerning wit, it may appeare to make something for her, it is to be presup∣posed that there is more weakenesse then stoutnesse in her. But if she can render no good reason, but only take euery shew that any way seemeth to incline to her words, and perempto∣rily holdeth the conclusion, and stifly standeth on her owne resolution, though the vanity of her pretences be euidently discouered to her, so as she hath not any thing further to ob∣iect;
or if she render no reason at all but her owne thought, conceit and will, and yet refuseth to yeeld, surely obstinacy possesseth her heart. In case of obstinacy it is very expedient that an husband stand vpon his power to maintaine his au∣thority, and by the best wisdome he can (vsing only such meanes as are lawfull) bring her to yeeld from her stoutnesse to that which he requireth: especially if the matter be weighty: as in case a religious man haue been maried to a Po∣pish wife, and she by no reason will be moued to forbeare go∣ing to Masse, or yeeld to goe to the preaching of the Gospell. But if through weakenesse she cannot be perswaded of the lawfulnesse of that her husband requireth, and the matter re∣quired be of no great consequence, nor the weakenesse of her conscience cause any great error, an husband ought so farre to manifest his mildnesse as to forbeare to presse her con∣science. §. 28. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 43, 44. &c. forbearing to presse things vnbeseeming a wiues place. 3. Things vnbeseeming the place of a wife are dishonourable vnto her: for an husband to vrge his wife by strict charge to doe them, implieth more rigorousnesse then mildnesse. Had the spi∣rit of that stout Monarch Ahashuerosh beene more milde towards his wife, he would not haue so farre pressed his wife vnto so vn∣seemly a thing as he did, namely, to come before all his Princes and people to make shew of her beautie. It is true indeed (as we shewed Treat. 3. §. 28. before) that she offended in refusing to yeeld thereunto, he peremptorily requiring it; but that offence on her part doth not justifie his fact, and free him from all blame: it is noted, that he was merry with wine, when he gaue that commandement, Est. 1. 10. whereby is intimated, that his practise was more beseeming a drunken, then a sober man: such is their practise who exact of their wiues to doe such businesses as beseeme maid-seruants ra∣ther then wiues, or strumpets rather then honest women; as to goe to tauernes, ale-houses, play-houses, and such places where light companions be. §. 29. Of an husbands pressing his authoritie in weighty matters. 4. To vse a mans authoritie about weightie matters, matters of moment, maketh it to haue such weight in it, as it will much bet∣ter
be regarded: for thus a wife will either be brought to yeeld vnto that which is commanded, or to condemne her selfe for not yeelding: yea thus a wife may see, that it is not his owne will so much which maketh him to vse his authoritie in commanding, as the necessitie of the thing it selfe, which redoundeth especially to her good that doth it: for the performance of a dutie is for the most part most aduantageable to the partie that performeth it, so as hereby an husband sheweth loue to his wife in pressing that which he presseth. This token of loue that it may the better appeare, it is behoue∣full Reasons of pressing a cō∣mandement to be rendred. that an husband adde to his commandement iust & weightie reasons, that thereby his wife may the better discerne the meet∣nesse, lawfulnesse, expediencie, and necessitie of the things com∣manded. We know that all the things which God commandeth are weightie and necessarie: yea his will (being the very rule, and ground of all goodnesse) maketh things absolutely necessarie, yet vnto his commandements he vseth to adde weightie reasons; shewing on the one side the benefit and blessednesse that will come to such as obey his commandements; and on the other side, the mischiefe and miserie that will fall on their pates who re∣fuse to obey; whereby he sheweth the great good respect which he beareth to vs, and the earnest desire he hath of our good. Thus may an husband euen in his commandements shew much loue and kindnesse. §. 30. Of husbands too great pride in commanding. Contrary is the peremptorie pride of husbands, when they will haue their owne will done: it booteth not whether the thing commanded be lawfull or vnlawfull, whether their wiues consci∣ences can yeeld vnto it or no, whether it stand with the honour of their places or no, and whether it be weightie or light; their will it is it should be done, and done it shall be, there is all the reason they will giue. Some thinke it a glory to command what they list; and thinke that there is no proofe of their authoritie, and of their wiues subiection, but in such things as vpon their own will, without any further ground or reason, they command. If such husbands meet with confronts; if though they command much, they finde not answerable performance; they may thanke them∣selues,
who runne the ready course to haue their authoritie con∣temned and euen troden vnder foot. §. 31. Of husbands rare and milde vsing their commanding power. Respect must be had by husbands to the manner of vsing their authoritie in commanding as well as to the matter. In regard of the manner his commandements must be 1. Rare, not too frequent. 2. By way of intreating, not too peremptorie. Authoritie is like a sword, which with ouer much vsing will 1. Comman∣ding must be rare. be blunted, and so faile to doe that seruice which otherwise it might when there is most need. A wise, graue, peaceable man, may alwayes haue his sword in readinesse, and that also very bright, keene, and sharpe: but he will not be very ready to plucke it out of his scabberd; he rather keepeth it for a time of need, when it should stand him in most steed. Such husbands therefore as are too frequent in their commands, shew themselues nor graue, nor wise, nor louers of peace. As the vse of an husbands authoritie in commanding must be 2. Comman∣ding must be by way of in∣treating. Philem. 9. rare, so when there is occasion to vse it, it must be with such mild∣nesse and moderation tempered, so as (according to Saint Pauls example) though he haue power to command that which is conuenient, yet for loues sake he rather intreat it. Note how mildly Abram frameth his speech to his wife, Say I pray thee Gen. 12. 13. (saith he) thou art my sister. Though the thing he required fa∣uoured of too much weaknesse, yet his manner of requiring it was well beseeming a kinde husband. §. 32. Of husbands insolencie and peremptorinesse. Contrary is the insolencie of many, who cannot speake to their wiues, but in commanding-wise. Their authoritie is like a swag∣gerers sword, which cannot long rest in the sheath, but vpon euery small occasion is drawne forth. This frequent vse of comman∣ding, maketh their commandements nought regarded. The like may be said of them who are too peremptorie in commanding: there must be no saying of nay, to that which they say: vpon com∣mand they will haue their minde done, and no other way: no perswasion, no intreatie shall be vsed: they will rather not at all haue their will done, then not vpon absolute command: nay they
will not suffer others, in case of any refusall, to intreat, or per∣swade, but will try what absolutely they can doe by authoritie. Thus as by trying to bend steele how farre it will goe, it oft breaketh; so by putting their authoritie to the vttermost triall, they oft lose all their authoritie: in which case the mends (as we speake) is in their owne hands. §. 33. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 47. Husbands ought to re∣proue. reprouing his wife. 4. The authoritie and charge which God hath giuen to an husband ouer his wife, doe require that as good and iust occa∣sion is offered, he should reproue her: for this is an especiall meanes to draw her from those sinnes, wherein otherwise shee might liue and lie, yea and die also; and so liue, lie, and die vnder Gods wrath: out of which miserie and wretchednesse to free a wife, is as great a token of loue, as to pull her out of the wa∣ter when she is in danger of drowning, or out of the fire when she is in danger of burning. Solomon thus stileth reproofes, Pro. 15. 31. reproofes of life, and expresly noteth & 6. 23. reproofes to be the way of life, a meanes to breed and preserue spirituall life, and to bring one vn∣to eternall life, and so to escape death and damnation. In these re∣spects rebukes are called a pretious balme, or excellent oyle, which may heale a wound, but make none: it Psal. 141. 5. See the fruits of reproofe, Treat. 3. §. 47. breaketh not the head, as the Psalmist speaketh. Vpon this ground, no doubt, it is noted of many good husbands, who were without all question, louing, kinde, meeke, and milde husbands, that they reproued their wiues: as Gen. 30. 2. Iaakob, Iob 2. 10. Iob, 2 Sam. 6. 21, 22. Dauid, and others. §. 34. Of neglecting reproofe. Contrary is a seruile and timorous minde of many husbands, who are loth to offend, and (as they thinke) to prouoke their wiues; and thereupon chuse rather to let them continue in sinne, then tell them of it. Wherein they both dishonour their place, and the image of God, which by vertue of their place they carry, and also in effect and in truth hate their wiues; which the Law impli∣eth, where it saith, Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, Leuit. 19. 17. but shalt plainly rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sinne vpon him. §. 35. Of Treat. 3. §. 47 An husbands reproofe must be sweetned with mildnes. well ordering reproofe in the matter thereof. That an husband may euidently demonstrate that his repro∣uing of his wife is indeed a fruit of his loue, he must haue an espe∣ciall
care to sweeten it, especially with mildnesse: for it is the bit∣terest pill that by an husband can be giuen to a wife. It is a verball correction, & in that respect a middle meanes (as I may so speake) betwixt admonition and correction; partaking somewhat of both: it goeth no further then words, and so is an admonition: the words of a reproofe are sharpe, and so it is a correction: though it be but a milde correction, yet it is a sharpe admonition; and all the cor∣rection which by himselfe an husband can giue his wife: for we shall §. 44. after shew that he may not proceed to blowes, and strokes. To sweeten reproofe with mildnesse respect must be had (as be∣fore was noted of commanding) both to the matter, and also to the manner thereof. The matter of reproofe must be Matter of reproofe. 1. Iust. 1. Iust. 2. Weightie.   Iustice requireth that it be a truth, and a knowne truth, euen a thing whereof he is assured, for which he reproueth his wife. Christ in giuing direction for reprouing aright, layeth downe this as a ground, If thy brother shall trespasse, &c. a trespasse Matth. 18. 15. therefore must goe before reproofe: where no trespasse is, there reproofe is vniust. Againe, the Apostle aduiseth that an accusation should not 1 Tim 5. 19. be receiued but vnder two, or three witnesses; whereby he im∣plieth that a light report must not be receiued, but where blame is laid, there must be two or three witnesses to confirme it, so as he that censureth may haue good and sure ground for that which he doth: indeed that aduise was in particular gi∣uen about an elder, but from the lesse to the greater it will fol∣low to be a good aduise concerning wiues: for no kinde of person must be more warie in laying blame vpon another and reproouing for the same, then an husband on his wife. Equitie further requireth that the matter for which an hus∣band 2. Weigh. y. reproueth his wife be weightie; namely for some fault that is dangerous to her soule, hurtfull to their estate, contagi∣ous by reason of ill example to children, and others in the family, but most of all for sinne against God which prouoketh his wrath, and pulleth downe his heauie curse vpon him, her, and the whole family. When that for which a wife is reproued is a truth, a knowne
truth, and a weightie truth, the husband in performing this dutie iustifieth his deed, sheweth that there was need thereof, and so giueth euidence of his loue, maketh his reproofe to pierce the more deeply, and so maketh her the more ashamed of her fault; whence it will follow, that either she will amend her fault or at least will haue her mouth stopped, so as she shall haue nothing to except against it. The reproofe of the three Saints before mentioned, Gen. 30. 2. Iaakob, Iob 2. 10. Iob, and 2 Sam. 6. 21, 22. Dauid, were answerable to these points of Iustice and wisdome: and the effects thereof answerable to those which we haue noted in this reason, as the silence of the three wiues implieth: for none of them replied againe. §. 36. Of vndue reproofe. Contrary to the forenamed Iustice and equitie are ouer∣light Contrary, 1. Credulitie. credulitie and vndue suspicion. Credulitie is when cre∣dence is giuen to euery light report, and thereupon blame laid vpon the wife before any iust proofe be made of that for which she is blamed: whereby it oft commeth to passe, that she is wrongfully and vniustly blamed: which if she be, what good fruit can proceed from such reproofes? yea what euill fruits are not like to proceed from thence, as secret discon∣tent (if not malice and hatred) and open contentions and brawlings? The like may be said of light and causelesse suspicion, which 2. Suspicion. is the mother of iealousie, and the very bane of mariage, from whence the deuill taketh great aduantage against them both, seeking thereby to vnloose that knot which God hath so firm∣ly knit betwixt them. Suspicion to the minde is as a colou∣red glasse to the eie, which representeth things to the sight not as indeed they are in their owne true colour, but as the colour of the glasse is. Suspicion will make a man peruert euery thing that his wife doth, and blame her many times for such things as are praise-worthy: in which case what can be thought, but that an husband seeketh aduantage against his wife, rather then any good vnto her? If to those two forenamed vices (credulity and suspicion) he 3. Rashnesse. dde rashnesse and hastinesse in reprouing, and make euery mall and light matter which any way he disliketh, matter of
reproofe, doth he not proclaime to all that shall know it, that he loues chiding more then he loues his wife? Yea is not this the ready way to make all his reproofe (if not scorned) lightly regarded? What then will be the profit of them? §. 37. Whether an husband may reprooue his wife for such things as he is guilty of. To the matter of reproofe some adde, that an husband ought not to reproue his wife for that fault whereof he him∣selfe is guiltie: but I make doubt of this direction. I denie not but that he ought to haue an especiall care that he be not guiltie of that crime for which he blameth his wife; other∣wise, 1. he blunteth the edge of his reproofe, so as readily it cannot peirce into her heart. 2. He causeth it to rebound backe againe vpon himselfe with these reproches, Physitian healethy Luk 4. 23. Mat. 7. 5. Rom. 2. 21. Rom. 2. 1. selfe: Hypocrite first cast the beame out of thine owne eye. Thou that teachest another teachest thou not thy selfe? 3. He is an heauy witnesse against himselfe; for in that he iudgeth another he condemneth himselfe. But thereupon to infer, that because he is guiltie of such vices as are in his wife, he ought not to reproue her though she be worthy to be reproued, is scarse sound and good diuinitie: for thus he maketh himselfe guilty of a double fault, one of committing the sinne himselfe, the other of suffering his wife to lie therein: whereas if he repro∣ued his wife, he might thereby reclaime both her and him∣selfe: for I doubt not but his reprouing of his wife would strike deeper into his owne conscience then if a third should reproue them both. How were Iudah and Dauid stroken to Gen. 38. 26. 2 Sam. 12. 13. the heart after they had giuen sentence against such crimes as they themselues were guiltie of? It is a good aduice that no man be guiltie of that which he reproueth in his wife, but it is no good rule to say, no man ought to reproue his wife of that whereof he is guiltie. §. 38. Of well ordering reproofe in the manner thereof, Like directions to those which were giuen for the manner Manner of reprouing. of commanding must be obserued in the manner of reprouing. Reproofes therefore must be Rare. Meeke.   When reproofes are seldome vsed, not but vpon vrgent and 1. Seldome.
necessary occasion, 1. It sheweth that an husband taketh no delight in rebuking his wife, but is euen forced thereto. 2. It maketh his wife much more regard it. 3. It is like to worke a more perfect cure, for seldome and rare reproofes doe com∣monly peirce most deeply. Contrary is continuall chiding, and finding fault with a Contrary, continuall chiding. wife for euery thing amisse: if not only the wife her selfe, but a childe, or seruant, or any else in the house doe amisse, the wife shall be blamed for it. This is too common a fault in hus∣bands: whereby they much prouoke their wiues; yea and many times make them no more regard a reproofe then any other word. For as birds which alwaies abide in Belfries where much ringing is, are not a whit afrighted with their lowd sound; so wiues who haue their eares from time to time filled with their husbands rebuke, by vse are brought, nothing at all to be moued therewith. 2. That a reproofe must be giuen in meeknesse is cleere by 2. Reproue mildly. Gal 6. 1. the Apostles generall precept of restoring one in the spirit of meeknesse: for a right manner of reprouing is thereby particu∣larly intended. Now of all with whom we haue to doe, no fitter obiect for meeknesse then a wife, who in a more peculiar manner then any other is thine owne flesh. Meeknesse hath respect both to secrecie of place, and to softnesse of words. When an husband is alone with his wife, then is the fittest 3. Reproue in secret. Mat. 18. 15. season for reproofe: thus will reproofe be answerable to Christs direction: tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone (saith Christ of a brother:) but no brother must be tendred more then a wife. Thus will it also soake better into her soule, when no conceit of dishonour and discredit shall arise vp to hinder the worke of it: which conceits will be ready to arise when a reproofe is giuen in publike before others. Thus like∣wise will occasion be taken away from children and seruants of despising her: which otherwise they would quickly take, f before them she should be rebuked; gathering from thence, hat she is kept vnder as much as they: now because she is with him a ioynt gouernour of them, he ought by all meanes to maintaine her reputation before them.
1. Quest. What if she regard not a rebuke in secret? Direction for reprouing such a wife as regardeth not a secret re∣proofe. Mat. 18. 15. Answ. He may follow Christs direction, Take one or two more, namely wise, graue, faithfull friends, if it may be, of her kindred, as her parents (if she haue any liuing) or such as are in course of nature next to parents (if they be not partiall on her side) and before them rebuke her: but by no meanes be∣fore any of the house vnder her gouernment. 2. Quest. What if her fault be publicke, such an one as Direction for reprouing a wife whose offence is publike. may be an ill example to them of the house, it being commit∣ted in their sight, or brought some other way to their know∣ledge? Answ. Wisely he must so manifest his dislike of her fault, as he no way impaire her honour: he may therefore declare that such a thing was not well done, and fore-warne his houshold of committing the like; yea roundly threaten them that if any of them doe the like they shall dearely repent it; and if such as are vnder correction offend therein, the more surely and se∣uerely correct them, euen because they haue taken example. Thus shall he testifie a great good respect of his wife, and also a thorow dislike and hatred of her sinne. 2. A soft tongue (as Salomon noteth) breaketh the bones, 4. Reproue gently. Pro. 25. 15. that is, softneth an hard heart, and beateth downe a stout sto∣macke. How will it then worke vpon a soft heart, and gentle disposition? If therefore an husband looke to doe good by re∣prouing his wife, his reproofe must be so ordered, as it may seeme to be rather a gentle admonition, then a sharpe rebuke. He may and ought plainly to declare her fault vnto her, but in milde and meeke tearmes, without reuiling, opprobrious and ignominious words. Quest. What if her fault be an heinous notorious sinne? Answ. In an extraordinary case some sharpnesse may be A reproofe may be sharpe not bitter. Gen. 30. 2. Iob 2. 10. vsed: as the reproofes of Iaakob, Iob, and Dauid doe shew, for they were euery one of them sharpe: but yet this sharpnesse must not be made bitter by any euill language. A womans wickednesse may not moue an husband to be froward, and 2 Sam. 6. 21, 22. Rebuke neuer to be giuen by a man in passion. outragious; but rather to be the more watchfull ouer himselfe, that he containe himselfe within the bounds of discretion and moderation. For which end it is meete that husbands lay it
downe for a rule, neuer to rebuke their wiues when they are in passion. Passion raiseth a darke mist before the eies of reason; which, while it remaineth, keepeth reason from giuing any good direction. Yea passion is as a fire, and it so incenseth a man, and distempereth him, that in his disorder he can keepe no meane or measure. Howsoeuer a man be not able to rule himselfe when passion is stirred vp, yet, if before hand while his eie is single, and his whole body light, while he is in tune (as we Mat. 6. 22. speake) and well tempered, he resoluedly determine with himselfe not to doe such or such a thing in his passion; that fore-going resolution will be an especiall means to make him forbeare doing that in passion, which if he should doe, he could not in passion well order and moderate. For if once he begin to doe a thing in passion, the least prouocation that can be, will be as bellowes to blow vp that fire into a flame. In regard of the violence of passion (wherein women by Rebuke to be put off while a wife is in pas∣sion. reason of the weaknesse of their iudgement are for the most part most violent) it is also the part of a wise man to forbeare this duty of reprouing his wife euen when she is in passion. For as it is needfull that he should be in case well to giue a re∣proofe, so as needfull it is that she should be in case well to take a rebuke. Passion both filleth and festereth ones heart. The heart then being full of passion, what roome is left for good aduice? will a man powre wine into a vessell full of water, or stay, till all the water be dreaned out? The heart also being so festered as it sauoureth of nothing but passion, what good can then good aduice doe? It is therefore an especiall point of wisdome, and sheweth a good respect that a man beareth to his wife, yea it sauoureth of much meeknesse and moderation for an husband, well to weigh both his owne and his wiues temper when he repro∣ueth her, and to forbeare doing it while either he or she be in passion. §. 39. Of vndiscreet reproouing a wife. Contrary is the indiscretion of husbands who regard nor place, nor persons, nor time, nor temper of themselues or their wiues, nor any other circumstance in reprouing, but like Saul (who at a table where a great feast was, in presence of his No∣bles
and Captaines, when he was inraged with anger, with most virulent and bitter speeches not rebuked onely but re∣proached also his sonne, and that with such words as he spared not his owne wife; for in his passion he called his sonne, sonne 1 Sam. 20. 30. of the peruerse rebellious woman:) like this foolish and furious Saul, I say, they take the most open place of the family before children, seruants, and whole house, to reproue their wiues; and that with such bitter and disgracefull termes, as either they prouoke their wiues to answer againe for maintaining (as they thinke) their owne credit and reputation, (thus Ionathan 1 Sam. 20. 32. was prouoked to answer his father againe:) or else giue them of the house that behold her thus trampled vnder foot, occasion to set their feet also vpon her. Most husbands are forward enough to reproue, but few doe it in meeknesse, and moderation. They cannot doe it but in company, nor without bitter words. Many in rebuking their wiues, sticke not to vse all the euill termes that they can thinke of, euen such as tend not only to their wiues dishonour, but also to their owne and their childrens infamy. The reason whereof is, because they neuer rebuke but when they are in passion, and so scarse know what they doe: whereby also they stirre vp passion in their wiues, and yet for all that refraine not any whit the more, but rather grow more violent: as when the heat of two fires meet together, the flame must needs be the greater. This being the preposterous practise of many husbands, is it any maruell that ordinarily so little good, and so much hurt is done by reprouing? Nay, would it not be a wonder, if any good, and no hurt should be done thereby? This therefore though it be a duty, yet a dutie rarely and with great moderation to be vsed. Thus farre of an husbands mildnesse in his speeches to his wife. §. 40. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 10. amiable countenance towards his wife. An husbands cariage towards his wife must be answerable An husbands cariage must be milde. to his speech, or else all the mildnesse thereof will seeme but complementall.
A mans cariage compriseth vnder it, his Countenance, Ge∣sture, Actions: in all which must mildnesse be seated. 1. His countenance in his wiues presence, and towards his 1. A milde countenance. wife, must be composed to an amiable pleasantnesse. His au∣thority ouer her, and eminencie aboue her, may not make him forget the neere coniunction and vnion betwixt them. Vnder the face and countenance I comprise head, brow, eies, lips and such other parts which are, according as they are framed, signes of amiablenesse, or discontentednesse. Now a∣mong, and aboue other parts of the body, the outward compo∣sition of the countenance doth soonest and best declare the in∣ward disposition of the heart. By Esaus pleasant countenance Iaakob perceiued that he was pacified in his heart towards him, and thereupon said, I haue seene thy face as though I had Gen. 33. 10. seene the face of God, that is, an amiable, gracious countenance. On this ground Dauid desired God, to lift vp the light of his Psal. 4. 6. countenance vpon him, that thereby he might know the fauour and loue of God towards him. On the other side by a frow∣ning and lowring face, by hanging downe the head, putting out the lips, with the like, anger, malice, griefe, with other like affections of heart, are manifested: by Caines casting downe Gen. 4. 6. of his countenance God discerned anger and enuy to be in his heart: by Labans countenance Iaakob obserued that his affe∣ction Gen. 31. 2. was turned from him. A wife then beholding mild∣nesse and amiablenesse in her husbands face, beholds it as the face of God, and therein as in a looking glasse beholds the kindnesse and loue of his heart, and so hath her heart there∣by the more firmely knit vnto him, and is moued the more to respect him. §. 41. Of husbands too great austeritie. Contrary is 1. A loftie proud countenance, as of an imperi∣ous Contrary. 1. A lofty brow. Lord ouer his vassals. 2. A grim sterne countenance, as of a iudge ouer poore prisoners. 2. A grim looke. 3. A lowring frowning countenance, as of a discontented 3. A frowning forehead. reditor ouer a desperate debtor. 4. A fierce fiery countenance, as of an angry King ouer a 4. A fiery eye. biect that hath displeased him.
These and such like countenances as they manifest a proud, stout, furious discontented disposition of heart, so they cannot but giue great discontent to a wife, yea and much affright her being but a weake vessell, and alienate her heart and affection from him. §. 42. Of an husbands familiar gesture with his wife. II. An husbands gesture ought to be so familiar, and amia∣ble 2. Mild ge∣slure. towards his wife, as others may discerne him to be her husband, and his wife may be prouoked to be familiar with him. They which this way are ready to shew themselues kind and milde husbands, are prone to exceed and so to fall into an extreame on the right hand: for some are neuer well but when they haue their wiues in their laps, euer colling, kissing, and dallying with them, they care not in what company; thus they shew more lightnesse, fondnesse, and dotage, then true kind∣nesse and loue, which forgetteth not an husband-like grauity, sobriety, modesty and decency. Some sticke not to alledge Isaacks sporting with Rebeckah, to Obiect. countenance their lasciuiousnesse. Gen. 26. 8. But they forget that what Isaak did, was when he and his Answ. wife were alone: he was seene through a window. Much greater liberty is granted to man and wife when they are alone, then in company. Besides there are many other waies to shew kindnesse and familiarity, then by lightnesse and wantonnesse. §. 43. Of an husbands strangenesse to his wife. Contrary to the familiaritie I speake of, is (as we speake) strangenesse, when an husband so carrieth himselfe towards his wife as if she were a stranger to him: if he come in cōpany where his wife is, of all other women he will not turne to her, nor take notice of her. This fault is so much the greater if such a man be of a free pleasant cariage, and vse to be merry and familiar with other women. Though his mirth and familiarity be such as is not vnbeseeming a Christian, yet his cariage being of a∣nother temper towards his wife, it may be a meanes to breed iealousie in her. Many thinke outward kinde gesture towards
wife to be fondnesse, but if they knew what a meanes it is to stirre vp, increase, and preserue loue in a wiues heart to her husband, they would be otherwise minded. §. 43. Of an husbands giuing fauours to his wife. III. Actions are of all other the most reall demonstrations of true kindnesse, wherein an husband must not faile, as he would haue his kinde speech, countenance, and gesture to be taken in the better part. Kindnesse and mildnesse in action consisteth in giuing fauours (as we speake) vnto his wife. This is expresly noted in Elkanah, who euery yeere gaue fauours to 1 Sam. 1. 4, 5. his wiues. Thus an husband as he testifieth his loue to his wife, so he will much prouoke her to doe all duty to him. A small gift, as an action of kindnesse freely giuen, not vpon any debt, but in testimony of loue, doth more worke on the heart of her to whom it is giuen, then much more giuen vpon con∣tract, or for a worke done, whereby it may seeme to be de∣serued. In giuing fauours to a wife, an husband ought to be more bountifull and liberall, then to others, that so she may see thereby he loues her aboue all; as it is noted that Elkanah gaue Annah a worthy portion, because he loued her. And in gi∣uing 1 Sam. 1. 4. fauours it is best to bestow them with his owne hands, vnlesse he be absent from her. §. 44. Of husbands beating their wiues. Contrary are the furious, and spightfull actions of many vnkinde husbands (heads too heady) whose fauours are buf∣fets, Vipera virus ob venerationem nuptiarum euo∣mit. Et tu du∣ritiem animi, tuferitatem, tu crudelitatem ob vnionis re∣uerentiam non deponis? Basil. Hexaem. hom. 7. Ambr. Hexaem. l. 5. c. 7. vrget hanc ipsam si∣militudinem. blowes, strokes, & stripes: wherein they are worse then the venemous viper. For the viper for his mates sake casteth out his poison: and wilt not thou, ô husband, in respect of that neere vnion which is betwixt thee and thy wife, lay aside thy fiercenesse and cruelty? Many wiues by reason of their hus∣bands furie, are in worse case then seruants: for 1. Such as will not giue a blow to a seruant, care not what load they lay vpon their wiues. 2. Where seruants haue but a time and terme to be vnder the tyranny of such furious men, poore wiues are tied to them all their life long.
3. Wiues can not haue so good remedy by the helpe of law against cruell husbands, as seruants may haue against cruell masters. 4. Masters haue not such opportunity to exercise their cruelty ouer seruants as husbands ouer wiues, who are to be continually at boord and bed with their husbands. 5. The neerer wiues are, and the dearer they ought to be to their husbands, the more grieuous must stroakes needs be when they are giuen by an husbands hand, then by a masters. Huiusmodi vi∣rum (siquidem vir appellandus est potius quàm fera) & patri∣cidae, & matri∣cidae similem dixeris. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. 6. The lesse power and authority that an husband hath to strike his wife, then a master to strike a seruant, the more heauie doe his stroakes seeme to be, and the worse doth the case of a wife seeme to be in that respect, then of a seruant. Not vnfitly therefore is such a man (if he may be thought a man rather then a beast) said to be like a father-queller and mother-queller. Quest. May not then an husband beat his wife? An husband may not beat his wife. Answ. With submission to better iudgements, I thinke he may not: my reasons are these. 1. There is no warrant thorowout the whole Scripture Reasons. 1. No warrant in the word. by precept, or example for it: which argument though it be negatiue, yet for the point in hand is a forceable argument in two respects. 1. Because the Scripture hath so plentifully and particularly declared the seuerall duties of husbands and wiues: and yet hath deliuered nothing concerning an hus∣bands striking and beating his wife. 2. Because it hath also plentifully and particularly spoaken of all such as are to cor∣rect, and of their manner of correcting, and of their bearing correction who are to be corrected, and of the vse they are to make thereof; and yet not any thing at all concerning an husbands punishing, or a wiues bearing in this kinde. The Scripture being so silent in this point, we may well inferre that God hath not ranked wiues among those in the family who are to be corrected. 2. That small disparity which (as I haue §. 4. before shewed) is 2. Small dispa∣rity. betwixt man and wife, permitteth not so high a power in an husband, and so low a seruitude in a wife, as for him to beat her. Can it be thought reasonable that she who is the mans
perpetuall bed-fellow, who hath power ouer his body, who Summa iniuria est vitae sociam, & in rebus ne∣cessarijs tibi coniunctam, taquàm manci∣pium ignominia affioere. Chrys. ibid. is a ioynt parent of the children, a ioynt gouernour of the family, should be beaten by his hands? What if children or seruants should know of it? (as they must needs: for how can such a thing be done in the house and they of the house know it not?) can they respect her as a mother, or a mistresse who is vnder correction as well as they? 3. The neere coniunction, and very vnion that is betwixt 3. Neere con∣iunction. man and wife suffereth not such dealing to passe betwixt them. The wife is as a mans selfe, Eph. 5. 31. They two are one flesh. No man but a frantike, furious, desperat wretch will beat himselfe. Two sorts of men are in Scripture noted to cut and lanch their owne flesh, idolaters, as the 1 King. 18. 28. Baalites, and Daemoniacks, as Mar. 5. 5. he that was possessed with a legion of deuils. Such are they who beat their wiues, either blinded in their vnderstanding, or possessed with a deuill. Obiect. He that is best in his wits will suffer his body to be pinched, pricked, lanched, and otherwise pained, if it be need∣full and behoofull. Answ. 1. A mans heart will not suffer him to doe any of these himselfe: their are Chirurgions whose office it is to doe such things: if the Chirurgion himselfe haue need of any such remedy for his owne body, he will vse the helpe of ano∣ther Chirurgion. If the case so stand as a wife must needs be beaten, it is fitter for an husband to referre the matter to a publike Magistrate (who is as an approued and licensed Chi∣rurgion) and not to doe it with his owne hands. 2. Though some parts of the body may be so dealt withall, yet euery part may not, as the heart, which the wife is to the man. 3. The comparison holdeth not. For the fore-named pinching, lanching, &c. is no punishment for any fault, as the beating of a wife in question is, there is no question but a man that hath skill may if need be open a veine, lanch a boile, splinter a broken bone, or disioynted ioynt in his wiues body, which may be more painfull then correction: and here∣in the comparison holdeth, but not in the other. 2. Obiect. There is as neere a coniunction betwixt Christ
and his Church, as betwixt man and wife: yet Christ for bea∣reth not to correct and punish his Church. Answ. There is a double relation betwixt Christ and the Church: he is an husband vnto it, hauing made it of his flesh, and of his bones: and a supreme Lord ouer it, hauing all power Eph. 5. 30. Mat. 28. 18. in heauen and earth committed vnto him. In this latter respect he punisheth, not in the former. An husband is not such a su∣preme Lord ouer his wife: therefore Christs example, is no warrant to him. 4. There is no hope of any good to proceed from an hus∣bands 4. No profit: much mis∣chiefe. beating of his wife: for where the party cor∣rected is perswaded that the party which correcteth hath no authority or right so to doe, it will not be brought patiently to take it: but will resist, and striue if it be possible to get the mastery. Let a stranger strike such a childe of yeeres or a ser∣uant as will patiently beare many stroakes at a parents or ma∣sters hand, they will turne againe at that stranger, and indea∣uour to giue him as good as he brings: now a wife hauing no ground to be perswaded that her husband hath authority to Adhibitis ver∣beribus morbus non tollitur, sed augetur, & exasperatur. Melch. Iun. quaest. Polit. par. 2. beat her, what hope is there that she will patiently beare it, and be bettered by it? Or rather is it not likely that she will, if she can, rise against him, ouer-master him (as many doe) and neuer doe any duty aright? A fault in a wife is not taken away but increased by blowes. Obiect. Smart and paine may make her dread her husband, stand in awe of him, and doe her duty the better. Answ. Such dread and awe beseemes neither the place of an husband to exact it, nor the place of a wife to yeeld it. Though perforce she may be brought to yeeld some outward subiection, yet inward hatred of her husbands person may be ioyned there∣with, which is as bad, if not worse then outward disobedience. Obiect. She may be of so outragious a disposition, as, but by Nullum sit tam magnum peccatum, quod ad verberan∣dum vxorem compellat. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. force, she will not be kept in any compasse. 1. Answ. It hath beene of old time answered, that no fault should be so great, as to compell an husband to beat his wife. 2. Answ. Other forceable meanes may be vsed besides beating by her husbands hands: she may be restrained of libertie, denied such things as she most affecteth, be kept vp, as it were, in hold;
and, if no other meanes will serue the turne, be put ouer to the Magistrates hands, that if she be of so seruile a disposition, as by no other meanes she will be kept vnder then by feare and force, by smart and paine, she may feare the Magistrate, and feele his hand, rather then her husbands. Obiect. If a wife waxe so mannish, or rather mad, as to offer to strike and beat her husband, may he not in that case beat her to make her cease her outrage? Answ. I doubt not but that that good prouision which is made in law to preserue a mans life, may be applied to this pur∣pose. The law simply condemnes all murther; yet if a man be so assaulted, as there is no way to preserue his owne life, but by ta∣king away his life that assaults him, it condemneth not him as a murtherer, because he did it in defence of himselfe. So if an hus∣band Sedefendendo. be set vpon by his wife, it is lawfull and expedient that he defend himselfe, and if he can doe it no other wayes but by stri∣king her, that is not to be reckoned an vnlawfull beating her. §. 45. Of an husbands bearing with his wines infirmities. Hither to of the husbands auoiding of offence, a word concerning his bearing with offence. A generall dutie it is, common to all of all sorts, to beare one Gal. 6. 2. anothers burden: in which extent euen a wife is to beare her hus∣bands burden, because he, as euery one else, is subiect to slip and fall, and so hath need to be supported. Yet after a more speciall and peculiar manner doth this dutie belong to an husband, and that in two respects. 1. Of the two, he is more bound then his wife, because in re∣lation to his wife he is the stronger: for she is the weaker vessell, Considera mu∣lierem debile vas esse: tu au∣tem vir propte∣rea princeps factus es, vt subditae feras imbecillitatem. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. 1. Pet. 3. 7. But the strong are most bound to beare with the infir∣mities of the weake, Rom. 15. 1. 2. He is bound to beare with his wife more then with any other, because of that neere coniunction which is betwixt them: he that cannot beare with his wife, his flesh, can beare with no bodie. The reason alleaged by the Apostle to moue a man to dwell with his wife according to knowledge, and to giue honour to her, intima∣ted in this phrase, as to the weaker vessell, sheweth that this is a pe∣culiar dutie belonging to an husband, wherein, and whereby he 1. Pet. 3. 7.
may both manifest his knowledge and wisdome, and also doe ho∣nour to his wife. For why is he put in minde of her weaknesse, but to shew he should beare with her? As that phrase intimateth the dutie, so also it intimateth a good reason to inforce it. For pretious things, whereof we make high account, the weaker they be, the more tenderly, and charily are they handled, as Cheney dishes, and christall glasses: and of all parts of the bodie, the eye is most tenderly handled. Now what things, what persons are more deare and pretious then a wife? yet withall she is a weake vessell: therefore she is much to be borne withall. For an husbands better direction herein, difference must be Directions to husbands for bearing with their wiues in∣firmities. made betwixt infirmities: for some are naturall imperfections, other are actuall transgressions. Naturall imperfections are inward, (as slownesse in conceit, dulnesse in apprehension, shortnesse of memorie, hastinesse in passion, &c.) or outward, (as lamenesse, blindnesse, deafnesse, or any other defect, and deformitie of bodie.) These infirmities should breed pitie, compassion, commiseration, yea and greater tendernesse and respect, but no offence. Note Abrahams example in this case: his wife was barren, yet he de∣spised Neque Saram tanquam steri∣lem contempsit Abraham: n{que} quicquam tale exprobauit. Si vxor pauper sit, noli exprobare: & si stulta, noli ei insultare, Ibid. Uxor ira∣cunda &c. ad∣monenda & ad∣iuvanda consi∣lio, & omni co∣natu anniten. dum, vt illis li∣beretur affecti∣bus, Ibid. her not for it, nor vpbraided her with any such thing. Actuall transgressions are breaches of Gods law: whereof such are here ment, as are most directly tending to his owne disquiet, and disaduantage, as shrewishnesse, waiwardnesse, nicenesse, stub∣bornnesse, &c. In the bearing of these must an husband especi∣ally shew his wisdome, and that sundry wayes. 1. By vsing the best and mildest meanes he can to redresse them, as meeke admonition, seasonable aduice, gentle intreatie, and compassionate affection. Elkanah supposing that his wife offended in her passion, thus dealt with her and supported her. 2. By remouing the stone whereat she stumbleth, by taking away the occasion (so far as conueniently he can) which maketh her offend. Thus Abram, and that by Gods aduice, put Hagar and her sonne out of the house, because they were an offence to Sarah. 3. By turning his eyes away (if the matter be not great, but 1 Sam. 1. 8. Gen. 21. 14. such as may be tolerated) and taking no notice of the offence, but rather passing by it, as if he perceiued it not. Solomon saith, that
it is a mans glory to passe ouer a transgression: and he exhorteth a Prou. 19. 11. Eccl 7. 23. man not to giue his heart to all the words that men speake. 4. By forgiuing and forgetting it (if notice be taken thereof.) Iaakob tooke notice of Rachels rash, and froward demand, for he Gen. 30. 1. 2, &c. rebuked her for it: yet in that he readily yeelded to that which afterwards she moued him vnto, it appeareth that he forgaue the offence, if not forgat it. The best triall of a mans affection to his wife, and of his wis∣dome Reason. Best tryall of a mans wis∣dome & loue. in ordering the same, is in this point of bearing with offen∣ces. Not to be offended with a wife that giueth no offence is not praise-worthy: heathen men may goe so farre. Note what Christ saith of this case, If yee loue them which loue you, and doe good to Matth. 5. 46. Luk. 6. 32, 33. them that doe good to you, what thanks and reward haue ye? for publicans, and sinners doe the same: but gently to forbeare, and wisely to passe ouer offences when they are giuen, not to be pro∣uoked when there is cause of prouocation ministred, is a true Christian vertue, a vertue beseeming husbands better then any other kinde of men. §. 46. Of husbands testinesse. Contrary is testinesse, and peeuishnesse, when husbands are moued with the least prouocation, like tinder catching fire at the least sparke that falleth vpon it: yea many are like gunpowder, which not only taketh fire, but also breaketh out into a violent flame, vpon the least touch of fire: as gunpowder is dangerous to be kept in an house, so such husbands to be ioyned so neerely to wiues as mariage ioyneth them. If it be said, that as gunpowder doth no hurt, if fire come not at it; so they are good and kinde, if they be not prouoked and displeased. I answer, that we haue a prouerbe that saith, The deuill is good while he is pleased, yet it is not safe to haue the deuill too neere. It is as impossible (conside∣ring mans weaknesse) that he should liue and conuerse with any, and not giue offence, as for flint stones long to beat and dash a∣gainst one another, & no sparke of fire to come from them. How then may it be thought possible for a wife, who is so continually conuersant with her husband, and the weaker vessell, to liue with∣out giuing him offence? It is no very kinde speech, which hus∣bands vse, especially if they be told of their vnkindnesse, Let my wife deserue fauour, and she shall haue it. How little fauour would
such husbands haue of Christ their husband, if he should be of that minde towards them? Thus farre hath beene handled the first part of an husbands well managing his authoritie, by a tender respect of his wife. The second is a prouident care for her. §. 46. Of an husbands prouident care for his wife. An husband that tenderly respecteth his wife, but prouidently careth not for her, sheweth more affection then discretion: he may haue a kinde heart, but he wants a wise head. How then can he be a good head vnto his wife? Some present contentment she may haue by him: but small profit and benefit can she reape from him. Those duties therefore which haue beene deliuered must be done, but these that follow must by no meanes be left vndone. An husbands prouident care is noted in that office of Christ, wherein an husband resembleth him, namely, to be a Sauiour of Eph. 5. 23. the bodie, as hath beene Treat. 1. §. 15. & Treat. 3. §. 73. before declared. It consisteth 1. In prouiding things needfull for his wife. 2. In protecting her from things hurtfull. 1. A carefull prouiding of things needfull, is a principall part of 1. Prouiding things need∣full. that honour, which husbands are to giue vnto their wiues. For where the Apostle saith, that Elders are worthy of double honour, 1 Pet. 3. 7. 1 Tim. 5. 17. he meaneth maintenance as well as reuerence. The Apostle coun∣teth him worse then an Infidell, that prouideth not for his owne, and specially for those of his owne house. Who are of an husbands house, 1 Tim. 5. 8. if not his wife? in his house, who more properly his owne, then his wife? If then an husband prouide not for his wife, what is he Recordare quòd pater vxoris tā∣quam depositum quoddam filiam tibi tradidit, & omnibus reli∣ctis, matre, do∣mo, & seipso, omnem eius cu∣rā tuae dexterae commisit. Chrys. hō. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. to be accounted? Great reason he should prouide for her, because he hath taken her from her parents and friends, and hath receiued that portion which they allotted her, and hath authoritie committed vnto him ouer her, and she is put in subiection vnder him: her friends ha∣uing giuen away her portion, and their power ouer her, and com∣mitted all to him, will take no further care for her: she being in subiection vnder him cannot without him prouide for her selfe. Who then shall prouide for her if he doe not, whose wholy and only she is?
Contrary is their minde, who take a wife only for their owne Contrary, to take a wife on∣ly for him∣selfe. content, or delight, or gaine, and neuer thinke of that charge which together with a wife they take vpon them. According to their minde is their practise: for when they haue a wife they neglect her in euery thing but what may stand with their owne ends. Much haue they to answer for: and so much the more, because a wife is an especiall pledge of Gods fauour. Pro. 18. 22. §. 47. Of an husbands prouiding meanes of spirituall edisica∣tion for his wife. In this prouident care which an husband ought to haue of     his wife, we will consider the Extent thereof. Continuance     It ought to extend both to her selfe, and to others. In regard of her selfe, to her Soule. Body.   For her Soule, meanes of spirituall edification must be pro∣vided, and those both priuate and publike. Priuate meanes, are Priuate means of edification. holy and religious exercises in the house, as reading the word, praier, catechising, and such like; which being the spirituall food of the soule are to be euery day, as our bodily food, pro∣uided and vsed. An husband as a master of a family must pro∣vide these for the good of his whole house; but as an husband, in speciall for the good of his wife: for to his wife, as well as to the whole house he is a King, a Priest, and a Prophet. By himselfe therefore, for his wiues good, ought he to per∣forme these things, or to prouide that they may be done by some other. Craelius himselfe performed those exercises. Act. 10. 2, 30. Iudg. 17. 10. Micah hired a Leuite (though his Idolatry were euill, yet his care to haue a Leuite in his house was commendable.) The 2 King. 4. 11. Shunemites husband prouided a chamber for the Prophet, and that especially for his wiues sake, for it was at her request. Publike meanes are the holy ordinances of God publikly Publike meanes of edification. performed by Gods Minister. The care of an husband for his wife in this respect is, so to order his habitation, and prouide other needfull things, as his wife may be made partaker there∣of. It is expresly noted of Elkanah that he so prouided for his 1 Sam. 1. 7. & 2. 19. Luk. 2. 41. wiues, that they went with him euery yeere to the house of God: the like is intimated of Ioseph the husband of the virgin
Mary. In those daies there was a publike place and house of God, whither all Gods people (how farre soeuer they dwelt from it) were to resort euery yeere: the places where Elkanah and Ioseph dwelt, were farre remote from the house of God, yet they so prouided, as not only themselues, but their wiues also went to the publike worship of God. Now there are many houses of God, places for the publike worship of God, but yet through the corruption of our times, the ministery of the word (the most principall meanes of spirituall edification) is not euery where to be enioyed: therefore such ought an hus∣bands care for his wife in this respect to be, as to dwell where she may haue the benefit of preaching the word, or else so to prouide for her, as she may weekly goe where it may be had. If men of wisdome and abilitie make a purchase, or build an house for their habitation, they will be sure it shall be where sweet riuers and waters are, and good pasture ground, and where all needfull prouision may be had. Gods word prea∣ched is a spring of water of life; the place where it is preached a pleasant, profitable pasture; all needfull prouision for the soule may there be had. Let this therefore be most of all in∣quired after: and no habitation setled but where this may be had. §. 48. Of neglecting their wiues edification. Contrary is their practise, who hauing their calling in pla∣ces where the word is plentifull, yet vpon outward respects of pleasure, delight, ease, and profit, remoue their families into remote places where preaching is scarce, if at all; and there leaue their wiues to gouerne the family, not regarding their want of the word, for as much as they themselues oft comming to London or other like places by reason of their calling, en∣ioy the word themselues. Many Citizens, Lawyers, and o∣thers are guiltie of great neglect of their wiues in this respect. So also are they, who abandon all religious exercises out of their houses, making their houses rather stewes of the deuill, then Churches of God. If for want of meanes, either publike or priuate, a wife liue and die in ignorance, profanenesse, infi∣delitie, and impenitencie, which cause eternall damnation,
assuredly her bloud shall be required at his hands: for an hus∣band Ezek. 3. 18. &c. is Gods watchman to his wife. §. 49. Of an husbands prouiding things needfull for his wiues boay. To the body also must an husbands prouident care of his wife extend: and that both in health and sicknesse. In health by prouiding such things as are needfull to preserue health, as competent food, raiment, and the like necessaries. Where the Jsa. 4. 1. Prophet to aggrauate the misery of the people saith, Seuen women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our owne bread, and weare our owne apparell, only let vs be called by thy name, intimateth, that it was an husbands dutie to prouide bread and apparell, that is, all necessaries for his wife. Which the Exo. 21. 10. law also implieth, where it inioyneth him that taketh one wife vpon another, not to diminish the food and raiment of the former. In sicknesse such things are to be prouided as are needfull either to recouer her health, or to comfort, cherish and refresh her in her sicknesse. This was Treat. 2. Part. 2. §. 29. before noted among common mutuall duties; for by vertue of the matrimoniall bond it belongeth both to man and wife: but to the man it appertaineth by vertue of that power and charge which he hath ouer his wife: and there∣fore it was needfull here to be touched. §. 50. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 49. prouident care for his wife about her child-bearing. Most proper to this place is that prouident care which hus∣bands ought to haue of their wiues both before and in the time of their trauell and child-bed: and that in two things especially. 1. In procuring for their wiues to the vttermost of their power and abilitie, such things as may saue their longing, in case they doe long (as in all ages women in the time of bree∣ding and bearing childe, haue beene subiect thereunto.) For it is well knowne, that it is very dangerous both for mother and childe to want her longing: the death sometimes of the one, sometimes of the other, sometimes of both hath followed thereupon. 2. In prouiding such things as are needfull for their trauell
and lying in childbed. This time is especially to be prouided for, in many respects. 1. Because it is a time of weaknesse, wherein the woman can∣not well prouide for her selfe. 2. Because her weaknesse is ioyned with much paine: the The paines of womens tra∣uell. paine of a women in trauell is the greatest paine that ordinari∣ly is endured by any for the time: none know it so well as they that feele it: and many husbands because they are not subiect thereto, thinke but lightly of it: but if we duly weigh Psal. 48 6. Isa. 13. 8. & 21. 3 Ier. 4. 31. & 30. 6. Mic. 49. that the holy Ghost when he would set forth the extremitie of any paines and pangs, resembleth them to the paines of a wo∣man in trauell, we may well gather, that of all they are the greatest: which is further manifested by the screekes and out∣cries which not only weake, and faint-hearted women vtter in the time of their trauell, but also are forced from the strongest, and stoutest women that be, and that though before hand they resolue to the contrary. Neither may we wonder thereat; for their body is as it were set on a racke (if at least the trauell be sharpe) and all their parts so stretched, as a wonder it is they should euer recouer their health and strength againe: or that they should hold out the brunt, and not die with their trauell, as Rachel, and the wife of Phinchas, and many in all ages haue Gen. 35. 16, &c. 1 Sam. 4. 19. 20. done. Surely among ordinary deliuerances I know none so neere a miracle, none wherein the Almighty doth so euidently manifest his great power and good prouidence, as in the safe deliuerie of women. Besides the great pang of trauell, wo∣men are also after their deliuerie subiect to many after-throws which are very painfull. From all these paines and great weaknesse which befalleth women in childbed, especially if they nurse their children, men by reason of their sex are freed: Now then to apply this point, seeing women are brought to such paines and weaknesse in bringing forth those children which are the mans as well as hers, and he freed from all; is it not very iust and meet that he should prouide all things need∣full for her welfare, ease, and recouery of strength? 3. Because the want of things needfull is at that time very dangerous: dangerous to the health and life of the woman and childe also.
§. 51. Of neglecting wiues in their weaknesse. Contrary to an husbands prouident care in generall are those vices which were taxed in the treatise of common du∣ties, * See Treat 2. Part. 2. § 30. 39. as grudging at the charges bestowed on a wife: Couetousnesse, Prodigality, and Idlenesse. But contrary in particular to an husbands care for his wife in childbed, is the inhumane and more then barbarous vn∣kindnesse of many husbands, who no whit consider the weak∣nesse of their wiues in this case, to helpe, ease, and comfort them, but rather make their burden much more heauy. For, 1. Some through couetousnesse refuse before hand to af∣ford meanes to their wife to prouide such things as are needfull for her selfe and child: & when the time commeth, if their wife be desirous of a Midwife that requireth somwhat more charges then she that is next, she shall haue none if she will not haue the next. And as for a nurse to tend her, they thinke their Maid will serue the turne wel enough: they need not be at the charges to bring a Nurse into the house. In regard of conuenient lodging some will not sticke to say, Cannot my wife be brought to bed in a roome without a chimney as well as the Virgin Mary? Why should my wife need more things then she did? Yea fur∣ther there be many that whē the time that their wife should be deliuered approacheth neere, carie her from al her friends into a place where she is not knowne, lest her friends should by im∣portunity draw him to expend and lay out more vpon his wife then he is willing. In the time while their wife is weake in childbed, many are loath to allow them any other diet then is for themselues and children prouided in the house, not consi∣dering that her stomach cannot be like theirs. Many other such bitter fruits of vnkinde husbands arising from couetousnesse might be reckoned vp, whereby husbands plainely shew that they loue their wealth better then their wiues: they had rather lose them, then part with that. 2. Others through iealous suspicion forbeare not euen in Si quid vxor peccauerit con∣solare & noli moerorem auge∣re. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. the time of their wiues paine and weaknesse, to vpbraid them with lightnesse, and to say that the childe is none of theirs. To lay this to a wiues charge vniustly, is at any time a most shamefull and odious reproach: but in the time of childebirth
whether iust or vniust, a thing too too spightfull and reuenge∣full. Some wiues are so farre ouercome thereby, (especially in the time of their weaknesse) as they are not able to beare it, but euen faint and die vnder the reproach: others more stout vow neuer to know their husbands againe. Many like mis∣chiefes follow on such vnkindnesse. §. 52. Of an husbands Treat. 3. §. 38. prouiding for his wife according to his estate and abilitie. In an husbands prouiding for the body of his wife respect must be had to the measure, and to the manner. The measure must extend to his ability: for an husband ought to maintaine his wife in as good an estate and fashion as himselfe; by mariage she is aduanced to as high an estate, and dignity in relation to others as he is: and for her owne vse she is made a partner of all his goods, and accordingly ought to partake thereof. For the manner, he must suffer her (if at least he obserue her to haue any competent discretion) to order such things as are needfull for her selfe according to her best liking: as Elkanah in another case said to his wife, Doe what seemeth thee best. 1 Sam. 1. 23. Both in the measure and in the manner of prouiding, there must be a difference put betwixt a wife, and seruants or chil∣dren. These may haue their portions of meat, apparrell, and like necessaries, proportioned out and stinted vnto them, which is vnmeet to be done to a wife. Neither is it needfull that so plentifull a prouision be made for them as for her. §. 53. Of an husbands nigardlynesse to his wife. Contrary is an husbands nigardly dealing with his wife: when the allowance she hath is both farre vnder his estate, and also so giuen her by little and little, as if she were a childe. Many husbands make their wiues drudge at home, fare hardly, and goe meanly; who are themselues braue in apparrell, fro∣licke in their feasting abroad, and so exceed their wiues as they are ashamed to be seene in company with them. They who marry their maids, or others of meaner ranke then themselues, oft so deale with them: esteeming them but as seruants and meane persons though they be their wiues. But it hath beene §. 6. before shewed, that wiues by marriage are aduanced to their
husbands dignity, how meane soeuer they were before. §. 54. Of husbands Treat. 3. §. 23. 29. 33. allowing their wiues to bestow on others, as they see good occasion. So farre ought the prouident care of an husband for his wife to extend, as she may haue (beside things needfull to her selfe) to bestow on such as it is requisite for her to giue vnto: as namely, on children and seruants in the house, and others also out of the house. For so much is noted in Salomons description Pro. 31. 15. &c. Vers. 21. Uers. 28. of a good wife; She giueth meat to her houshold, and a portion to her maidens: all her houshold is clothed with scarlet (namely, by her ordering and disposing the matter.) Her children rise vp and call her blessed, as for her generall cariage in the family, so for her particular fauours bestowed on themselues. As for Vers. 20. others out of the house, it is also noted, that she stretcheth out her hand to the poore, and reacheth forth her hands to the needie. These things she did by virtue of that power and liberty which her husband gaue her: as appeareth by two points there no∣ted: 1. In that before any mention is made of those things Vers. 11. which she did, it is said, The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her. 2. In that, after all her good deedes are reckoned vp, it is Uers. 28. said, Her husband praiseth her. After this patterne it is meete that other husbands (whose wiues are wise and faithfull) should deale with their wiues: that in the house they might haue the more honour of children and seruants: and that out of the house they might giue the better tryall of their charity. For considering the many excellent promises that are made to workes of mercy and charity, and the many terrible threat∣nings that are denounced not onely against such as exercise cruelty, but also against such as shew no mercy: considering also that wiues together with their husbands, are heires of the 1 Pet. 3. 7. grace of life, it is very needfull yea euen necessary, that they should manifest their faith by some worke of mercy and cha∣rity. Now vnlesse her husband doe giue vnto her something at her owne discretion to bestow on others, true and through
try all of her mercifull and charitable minde cannot be made. If she giue of that which her husband hath reserued to him∣selfe, as her giuing is vnlawfull, so she may be thought liberall, not because she is mercifull, but because notwithstanding her liberality she parteth with nothing of her owne: yea though she haue a generall consent to giue as she seeth cause of the common goods of the family, yet is not that so sure and sound a tryall of her charity, and mercifulnesse, as if she had something of her owne which she might retaine or giue away as pleaseth her selfe; and what she giues not away, lay vp as her owne stocke proper to her selfe. For there is naturally such a selfe loue in man, and a desire to keepe that which is proper to ones selfe, that he is very loath to part with any of it, vnlesse conscience and grace alter this corruption of nature, and so moue him readily to lay out something on charitable vses. But otherwise of that which in whole or in part belongeth to another (be that other, husband, parent, master, friend, or any else) he is easily moued to be liberall and bountifull: a man will willingly cut a large thong (as we speake) out of ano∣thers leather. It is knowne that many children and seruants, who, when they come to be possessers of their owne, are very niggards and misers, haue beene liberall of their parents and masters goods vnto the poore. Yea parteners in a stocke will be much more forward in giuing away that which is common with an∣other, then that which is proper to each of them. The truest triall of a mercifull and charitable heart lieth in the distribu∣tion of that which is proper to ones selfe. It is therefore meet vpon this very ground, that an husband should according to his ability let his wife haue some stocke, and portion of her owne, free to her selfe to dispose as she seeth good: intimating vnto her that the principall end why he prouideth so plentifully for her, is, that she may shew forth the fruits of her faith by some workes of charity: and exhor∣ting her so to doe. Many religious, wise, kinde husbands thus doe: some giuing quarterly allowance in money to their wiues, others giuing their wiues power to receiue a certaine portion of rent out of certaine lands or houses; others making
their wiues an absolute estate of some inheritance, and suffe∣ring them to receiue the profits and reuenewes thereof; others giuing them certaine fees of their offices, or of their trade; others, that are poore, suffering them to worke for themselues, & dispose their earnings as they see cause: some one way, some another: euery one in his place best knoweth the meanes how to gratifie his wife in this kinde: it shall be sufficient for me to haue laide downe the generall rule. §. 55. Of husbands too great straitnesse ouer their wiues. Contrary is their strait-handednesse to their wiues, who allow them no more then may be for their owne priuat vse. They thinke it a great matter and as much as an husband is bound to doe, to let her haue apparrell, meat and drinke, and such necessaries as are befitting her ranke, but all other ouer∣plus they thinke needlesse. Thus their wiues are not only de∣priued of meanes to gaine respect of their children and ser∣uants at home, and to gratifie such as are obedient and ready to doe seruice to them, but also to performe such workes of mercie as both opportunity requireth, and also their con∣science moueth them to doe. Yea many wiues of rich hus∣bands are brought to great shame hereby, in that being in places where there is iust occasion of contributing to some charitable vse, and by reason of their rich and costly apparell it is expected they should be bountiful, they haue not any thing at all to bestow. The fault of some husbands in this respect is great many waies. As 1. in that they bring shame and griefe to their wiues, whom they ought with all tendernesse to re∣spect. 2. In that they dishonour their owne places: for they who take notice of this straitnesse to their wiues, will be ready to iudge them both couetous, and vnkinde. 3. The omitting of that worke of mercie which their wiues should haue done shall be laid to their charge: they shall heare that dreadfull doome; Goe yee cursed into euerlasting fire, for I was an hungred and yee fed me not &c. and if they answer, When saw we thee an hungred &c. it shall be replied, In that yee suffered not your wiues to doe it, you did it not. Thus much of the extent of an husbands prouident care
for the good of his wife. It followeth to speake of the conti∣nuance thereof. §. 57. Of an husbands care to prouide for his wife so long as she shall liue. The continuance of an husbands prouident care for his wife must be so long as she liueth, yea though she out-liue him: not that he can actually when he is dead prouide for her, but that he may before his death so prouide for her, as she may haue wherewithall to maintaine her selfe, and to liue according to that place whereunto by him she is aduanced: at least that he leaue her not only so much as he had with her, but something more also in testimony of his loue to her, and care for her. Husbands haue the example of Christ to presse this duty vp∣on them: for when he went away from his Church here on Eph 4. 8. earth, he left his spirit, which furnished it with gifts as plenti∣fully, as if Christ had still remained with her, if not more aboundantly. For the better performance of this duty, husbands which die before the wiues, must obserue among other things two especially. 1. That plainly and expresly they declare their minde and Husbands be∣fore they die must make their will euen for their wiues good. will before they die, lest their wiues should be circumuented and defrauded of that which they intended them. Thus did Dauid vpon the motion of Bathshebah, he setled his estate, and caused Bathshebahs sonne to be actually crowned before he himselfe gaue vp the Ghost: which he did, as for other weighty reasons, so in particular for his wiues good, as may be gathered from that reason she alleaged to the King in these 1 King. 1. 21. Husbands on their death∣bed must com∣mend their wiues to some faithfull friend. Iob. 19 26, 27. Reason. Truest triall of loue at de∣parture. words; Else when my Lord the King shall sleepe-with his fathers, I shall be reputed vile. 2. That he request some faithfull friend in his steed to be an helper vnto her; (as Christ commended his mother vnto his disciple Iohn) which will be needfull in regard of her weak∣nesse, by reason of her sex, and want of experience to manage such affaires especially as are out of the house. At the time of a mans departure out of this world from his wife, will the truest triall of his affection to his wife be giuen: for many that beare their wiues faire in hand while they liue
with them, at their death shew that there was no soundnesse of affection in their heart towards them: all was but a meere shew for some by-respects. §. 58. Of husbands neglect of their wiues future estate. Contrary are diuers practises of vnkinde husbands. For Contrary. 1. A wilfull inability. 1. Some through improuidence, vnthriftinesse and pro∣digality, disable themselues from doing good to their wiues after their death; and so leaue their wiues nothing, or (that which is worse then nothing) in debt, and with a great charge of children. That care which husbands ought to haue of their wiues should make them thinke before hand of the time to come, and euen for their wiues sake be some-what the more diligent, thrifty, and prouident, and cut off many vnnecessary expences, else their sinne is doubled. 1. By a needlesse wa∣sting their estate. 2. By neglecting their wiues. 2. Others by fawning, or forcing meanes draw their wiues 2 Making away their wiues ioynter, or any other right. to yeeld vp that interest they haue in money, goods, house or land by ioynter, inheritance, or any other way, and yet make them no sufficient recompence in another kinde: but at their death leaue their wiues in a farre worse estate then they were in before mariage, beside a greater charge then they had be∣fore. As this is a great part of vnkindnesse, so also a maine point of iniustice. 3. Others grudging against the lawes vnder which they 3. Defeating of thirds. iue for prouiding for a wife by thirds or otherwise, vse all the raudulent meanes they can to depriue her of that which otherwise the law would lay vpon her. The ciuill politique awes of the place where we liue ought to be the rule of our ciuill actions (so farre as they are not repugnant to Gods word) and we ought for conscience sake to be subiect vnto Rom. 13. 5. them. Besides an husband ought (though the law forced him ot) to leaue at least the thirds to his wife, as a testimony of his loue to her, and care for her: so as this also is a dou∣le fault. 1. A transgression of the law. 2. A note of vn∣indnesse. 4. Orthers hauing aged and sickly wiues, or otherwise 4. Making no will. hinking that their wiues may, or rather hoping that their iues will die before themselues, put off the making of their
wills of purpose that they might not put in their wiues thirds, but dispose them some other way. Besides that these husbands shew no good affection towards their wiues, they prouoke God to disappoint them of their hopes: and so he doth of∣ten-times: for he taketh them away before their wiues, and so taketh them away, as hauing no time to make their will, not only their wiues enioy their thirds (which they so much de∣sired to auoid) but also some other (whom of all in their life time they misliked) seaze vpon the other two parts. §. 58. Of an husbands protecting his wife from danger. Hauing shewed how an husband is to prouide things need∣full for his wife: It remaineth to shew how he is to pro∣tect her from things hurtfull. In regard of that protection which an husband oweth his wife, he is called the veile of her eies: which phrase as it impli∣eth Gen. 20 16. Subiection on the wiues part, so also Protection on the hus∣bands: to protect one, is as it were, to couer them, namely, from danger; to be negligent and carelesse of them, is, as it were, to lay them open to danger. The same duty is implied vnder another like phrase of spreading his wing ouer his wife. Ruth 3. 9. The metaphor is taken from winged fowles, which to keepe their young ones from hurt, vse to spread their wings ouer them: this phrase and metaphor is also attributed to God, to Ruth 2. 12. set forth his protection. But most pertinent to this purpose is the title, Treat. 1. §. 15. and treat. 3. §. 73. Saniour, giuen to an husband in relation to his wife. For this end the Lord who subiected a woman vnto her husband, gaue to his sexe greater strength, courage and bold∣nesse then to hers, that he might protect her which is the wea∣ker vessell. In this duty of protection Christ sheweth himselfe an excellent patterne and president vnto husbands. The better to performe this dutie, an husband must bee carefull, 1. To preuent, as much as he may, such dangers as his wise is like to fall into. 2. To recouer her out of such as she is fallen into. For this purpose did Dauid carry his wiues into Gath, lest, if 1 Sam. 27. 3. they were left in Israel, Saul should worke them some mischiefe:
and againe, when they were taken by the Amalakites, he recoue∣red & 30. 18. them. According to that danger whereunto wiues are subiect, must an husbands care of protecting his wife be manifested. 1. If she be in danger to be seduced and inticed, as Euah was, A wife must be kept from being sedu∣ced. by any euill instruments of the deuill, as Iesuits, Priests, Friers, profane, blasphemous, lasciuious, or riotous persons; his care must be either to keepe them away that they come not at her, or to put them away from her so soone as he can: he may not suffer them to harbour in his house. 2. If by any sleight she be drawne from his house, he must A wise stolne away must be fetched home. Iudg. 19. 2. 2 San. 3. 13, 14. 1 Sam. 30. 18. A wiues credit must be main∣tained. seeke her, and fetch her againe, as the Leuite did his wife: or cause her (if he can) to be brought home againe, as Dauid caused Michal to be brought: especially if they be taken away by force, as Ahinoam, and Abigail, Dauids wiues, were. 3. If she be vniustly slandered, he is to maintaine her credit and reputation as much as his owne: as Christ accounteth him∣selfe despised, when his Church is, so must he. This care must he See Treat. 2. Part 2. §. 31. &c. haue of his wiues credit, euen after her death, as well as while she liueth. 4. What other mischiefe so euer is intended or practised against Luke 10. 16. A wife must be defended against stran∣gers, seruants, and children. Est. 7. 7, 8. &c. her, he must be a tower of defence to protect her, (as Ahoshuerosh was to Ester against Haman) and that not only against strangers without the house, but also against children and seruants in the house. Children growne to yeeres, that are stout and stubborne, will be ready to rise vp against their mother, especially if she be a mother in law, because she is the weaker sex: the countenance of a father for the most part keepeth most in awe. Wherefore the husband must be an helpe to his wife, and maintaine her honour against them: yea though they be children of a former wife. §. 59. Of an husbands maintaining his wife against children of a former venter, and seruants. Obiect. Mothers in law often proue vnkinde, and vniust step∣mothers, and deale vnmercifully with their husbands children: must an husband in such cases assist his wife against his children? Answ. The protection, I speake of, is in case a wife be wron∣ged, then her husband is to doe what he can to right her (as we speake.) But if she be the wrong-doer, he may by no meanes boul∣ster
her vp against his children, and so make their wrong the greater. Yet so far ought he to respect his wife, as by all the faire meanes he can, to labour to pacific her minde, and turne her heart towards them: and if he obserue her heart to be cleane alienated from them, then to put them forth to be brought vp in some other place, and so to take away from her the obiect of her dis∣pleasure, that he and she may liue more quietly together. For if a man must forsake father and mother, he must also forsake chil∣dren, and cleaue to his wife. Peace and vnitie betwixt man and wife must of all other be kept inuiolable. Though thou cast away Licèt omnia proijcias, nihil molestius con∣tinget quàm non habere be∣neuolam domi vxorem: pecca∣tum nullum magis dolen∣dum inueneris, quàm cum vx∣ore seditionem habere. Chrysost. hō. 26. in 1. Cor. 11. Genes. 16. 6. & 21. 14. all, nothing can happen more troublesome to thee then not to haue a quiet wife at home. Thou canst finde no sinne more grieuous then to haue contention with a wife. If a wife must be maintained against the stubbornnesse of chil∣dren, much more against the insolencie of seruants: for which purpose the example of Abraham is recorded, whose seruant might haue a priuiledge aboue others, because he had made her his bedfellow; yet when she waxed insolent against her mistresse, first he put her into her mistresses hand to doe to her as it pleased her; and afterwards he cast her out of his house. §. 60.

If Magistrates in a Com∣mon-wealth shall answer for suffering seducers to come into their dominions to deceiue their people, much more shall husbands answer for suffering them to come and deceiue their wiues. 1. Because they haue a greater charge ouer their wiues then Magistrates ouer their people. 2. Because wiues ought to be dearer to husbands then people to Magistrates. 3. Because they may sooner espie them in their house, then Magistrates in the Common-wealth. 4. Because they may be much more easily kept out of an house, then out of a Common-wealth, or a Citie. 2.

If Christ our husband should so deale with vs, we should soone be lost: for wee oft goe astray like wandring sheepe, but hee is that good shepherd, who seeketh after the lost sheepe vntill he Luke 15. 4. finde it. 3.

In not re∣garding ill re∣ports of wiues. with the ill reports and rumors raised against their wiues, when they so little regard who come to them, or whither they goe. Assuredly the discredit of a wife will turne to the mans disho∣nour: for as a vertuous wife is a crowne to her husband, so by the Pro. 12. 4. rule of contraries, an infamous wife is a shame to her husband. If therefore not for his wiues sake, yet for his owne sake a man ought not too carelesly passe ouer the ill reports which are raised against his wife. 4. There be such vnkinde husbands as are moued with no ill 4.

As this beseemeth not any Christian to suffer his neighbour to be wron∣ged, (for it is noted as a commendable matter in Moses, that Exod. 2. 13. when he saw two Hebrewes striuing together, he tooke his part that had wrong done to him, and reproued the other) so much esse an husband, to whose safe-guard his wife is committed.

As the wrong which is done by those who are in subiection n the house vnder the wife, is greater then that which is done by trangers: so is the husbands fault the greater in suffering it: for e hath more power ouer them in his house, then ouer others. Si illam quae secundum post te locum obtinet contumelia af∣ficis, non pa∣rum tui princi∣patus honori derogas. Chrys. loc. cit. What then may we thinke of such, as either by their conniuence, r by taking part against their wiues, suffer both children and ser∣ants to insult ouer them? Assuredly those husbands them∣selues will finde some smacke of the bitter and euill fruit thereof: d that not only by that great discontent which their wiues must eeds take thereat; but also by that contempt which will follow
on their owne persons, both by their wiues (who cannot thinke them meet heads to gouerne others) but also by their children and seruants, who thereby will take occasion to waxe proud, and presumptuous against him. By despising the weaker, men grow by little and little to despise the stronger. This men of wisdome and experience well know: whereupon in Common-wealths and Policies gouerned by wise men, the authoritie of inferiour Magistrates is vpheld and maintained: superiour Magistrates will not suffer them who are in authoritie vnder them to be despised: for it is well knowne, that it tends not to the honour and ease only, but to the safetie also of the supreme Magistrate, to haue the power and authoritie of inferiour Magistrates respected, and not trampled vnder feet. It argueth therefore both want of affection, and of discretion and vnderstanding in husbands, to suffer childe, seruant, or any other in the house, to insult ouer their wiues, who are ioynt gouernours with them ouer the house. §. 61. Of an husbands first beginning to loue his wife. The generall matter together with the particular kindes of husbands duties being thus farre handled, The manner also of performing them is to be deliuered. To instruct an husband in the manner of performing his duties to his wife, the Apostle laieth downe two patternes, 1. Christ, vers. 25. 2. Our selues, vers. 28.   As Christ loueth his Church, and as we loue our selues, so must men loue their wiues. That we may the better follow these patternes, we must distinctly note how Christ loueth his Church, and how we The manner of an husbands loue set forth by Christs manner of lo∣uing his Church in six branches. 1. Christ first loueth the Church. loue our selues. The loue of Christ to his Church is commended vnto vs in six seuerall points: which are 1. The order 4. The qualitie thereof. 2. The truth 5. The quantitie   3. The cause 6. The continuance   I. For the Order, Christ began to loue his Church: he ma∣fested his loue to her before she loued him: as the aire heated by the Sunne is hote, and a wall on which the Sun-beames
smite, giueth a reflexion of heat backe againe: so the Church, as it were heated and warmed at heart by the sence of Christs loue, loued him, as the Apostle expresly noteth, (We loue him 1 Joh. 4. 19. because he loued vs first:) and the Church her selfe acknow∣ledgeth saying, Because of the sauour of thy good ointments Cant. 1. 2. (wherewith we are reuiued, and cheered) the virgins loue thee. There is in vs by nature no sparke of loue at all: if Christ Husbands must by their loue prouoke their wiues to loue. Pro. 2. 17.  by his louing of vs first, did not instill loue into vs, we could no more loue him then a liuing bird rise out of a cold egge, if it were not kept warme by the dammes sitting vpon it. Thus must an husband first begin to loue his wife. His place of eminencie, and authority requireth, that he should be to his wife, a guide, which title is expresly giuen to him by the holy Sicaput est vir, praecedere debet in omnibus bo∣nis factis vxo∣rem suam, vt illa imitetur virum, & se∣quatur caput suum. Aug. de decem chor. c. 3. Ghost, to teach him to goe before her, and by his example to instruct, and incite her to doe her dutie. What a shame would it be for a man who is the Image and glory of God, the head of his wife, in the same place to her that Christ is to his Church, to be prouoked by his wiues wiue-like carriage (she being the weaker vessell, vnder him, to learne of him) to loue her? Treat. 1. §. 10. Rea∣sons there be to stirre vp a wife to indeauour to preuent her husband in doing her dutie, which if she doe, it is the greater glory to her; but this patterne of Christ should stirre him much more to striue to goe before her. §. 62. Of husbands repaying vnkindnesse for loue. Contrary, is their disposition, who hauing louing and duti∣full wiues, are notwithstanding nothing moued to loue them againe: but are as vnkinde and churlish as if they had the most eeuish, and peruerse wiues that could be. But what shall we say of such as loue their wiues the lesse, yea and hate them for their forwardnesse to loue, and (in testimony of true loue) to performe all good dutie? What, but that they are very deuils ncarnate? For it is the deuils property to ouercome good with cuill. These make the doctrine of a wiues subiection to seeme harsh, and a carefull performance thereof, an heauy burden. Neuer shall they partake of Christs loue, that in their place ew themselues so vnlike to Christ.
§. 63. Of the Treat. 3. §. 57. 2. Christ lo∣ueth in truth. truth of husbands loue. II. The truth of Christs loue was manifested by the fruits thereof to his Church: He gaue himselfe for it. It was there∣fore not in word only, no nor only in heart, but in deed also. Thus his loue proued profitable, and beneficiall to his Church, which thereby was clensed, and made a glorious Vers. 26, 27. Church. Had he only borne a tender compassion and pittifull affection towards it, or laboured only with comfortable and sweet words to vphold and succour it, it had still laine pollu∣ted with sinne, in the power of the deuill, and vnder Gods wrath, and so receiued no profit and benefit at all. So must husbands loue their wiues in truth and in deed. Husbands must loue in deed. 1 Ioh. 3. 18. Such a loue is required of a man to his brother: much more therefore to his wife, who is not only a sister (as 1 Cor. 9. 5. the Apostle expresly stileth her) but neerer then sister, mother, daughter, friend, or any other whatsoeuer. This therefore serueth to presse the practise of all the forenamed duties appertaining to an husband. §. 64. Of husbands dissimulation. Contrary is their dissimulation and hypocrisie, who make great shew of much loue, and pretence of earnest affection, vsing many outward complements, but faile when they come to the truest triall, the deed. Some like suters or wooers, will promise mountaines, but not performe moul-hills: others will coll and kisse their wiues much, but trust them with nothing, nor prouide for them things requisite: there be that will weepe much when their wiues are sicke, yet not afford physicke and such like things for their recouery: yea many will carrie a faire face all their life long towards their wiues, and at their death leaue them nothing to liue by. Hence it is that many who by others are accounted to be very kinde husbands, are by their wiues found to be farre o∣therwise. If triall be made of husbands loue by their practise and performance of the forenamed duties, it will be found that they for the most part come as farre short in loue, as wiues in subiection.
§. 65. Of the freenesse of husbands loue. III. The cause of Christs loue, was his loue, as Moses no∣teth, 3. Christ lo∣ueth freely. Deut. 7. 7, 8. He set his loue on you, because he loued you. His loue arose only, and wholly from himselfe, and was euery way free: as there was nothing in the Church, before Christ loued her to moue him to loue her, so can there be nothing that he could hope for afterwards, but what himselfe bestowed. Indeed he delighteth in that righteousnesse wherewith, as with a glori∣ous robe, she is clothed; and with those heauenly graces, wherewith as with pretious Iewels she is decked: but that righteousnesse, and those graces are his owne, and of his free gift, He presents it to himselfe a glorious Church. Eph. 5. 27. Husbands loue must be free. In imitation hereof husbands should loue their wiues, though there were nothing in wiues to moue them so to doe, but only that they are their wiues: yea though no future bene∣fit could after be expected from them: true loue hath respect to the obiect which is loued, and the good it may doe there∣unto, rather then to the subiect which loueth, and the good that it may receiue. For loue seeketh not her owne. 1 Cor. 13. 5. Christs loue in this branch thereof should further moue husbands to doe what lieth in their power, to make their wiues worthy of loue: thus will it be in truth said, that they dwell with their wiues according to knowledge: and thus will their 1 Pet. 3. 7. oue appeare to be as Christs loue, free. §. 66. Of husbands louing for aduantage. Contrary is their loue which is only for their owne content nd aduantage. Many can loue no further then they may haue ome bait to allure their affections, as beauty, wealth, honour, r the like by-respects; or at least hope of some inheritance or ortion aboue that which they haue, or of some fauour that they xpect from their wiues friends. This cannot be a true sound ue: such a man may be thought to loue his wiues beautie, heritance, and friends rather then his wife. This loue can∣not last. §. 67. Of the puritie of husbands loue. IIII. Christs loue for the qualitie is an holy, pure, chaste, 4. Christs loue pure. Eph. 5. 26, 27. ue: as he himselfe is, so is his loue, as is euident by the fect thereof: for it moued him to sanctifie and clense his
Church, to make it a glorious Church without spot: he did there∣fore no way pollute or defile his Spouse: and that his loue might the better appeare to be chaste loue, cast only vpon one Spouse and not many, he vnited all his Saints together by the 1 Cor. 12. 12, 13 bond of his Spirit, and made them all one body. Hereby husbands must learne so to be affected towards Husbands loue must be chaste. Heb. 13. 4. their wiues as may stand with holinesse, and chastitie: though much loue be required, yet it may not ouer-flowe those banks. Mariage is honourable and a bed vndefiled. It must therefore be vsed as an vndefiled thing. This indeed appertaineth to the wife as well as to the husband. But because he is the head, and guide of his wife, and ought to be as a patterne and president before her, as Christ is before him, therefore is it more speci∣ally applied to him. The puritie of an husbands loue here spoken of, hath a double vse, 1. It restraineth an husbands loue to his owne wife. There is a generall Christian loue whereby all occasions of doing good are taken, with which an husband may, and ought to loue others: and a particular matrimoniall loue, whereby he is moued to preferre his wife before all, and to haue his heart set and fixed on her, and so proper and peculiar to her. 2. It orders and moderates his loue, so as it turneth not into sinfull lust, whereby that estate, (which in it selfe by vertue of Gods ordinance, is holy) is polluted. §. 68. Of husbands lightnesse. Contrary, is not only adulterie, whereof we haue spoken Treat. 2. part. 2. §. 5, 8. before, but also wantonnesse, lightnesse, and vncleannesse with his wife. For many intemperate and vnchaste husbands, giuing the raines to their headstrong lusts, manifest as much vnseemlinesse and plaine filthinesse in their words, gestures, and actions (to say nothing of their thoughts which are not seene) to their wiues, as other doe to strumpets and harlots which is a most shamelesse thing, and I am euen ashamed  mention: but because it is mentioned, let such know, th they shall be accounted among such whoremongers and adul∣rers Heb. 13. 4. as God will iudge.
§. 69. Of husbands louing their wiues more then themselues. The quantity of Christs loue cannot be expressed: for the 5 Christs loue extended to the giuing of himselfe measure of it was aboue measure. Ephes. 5 25. He gaue himselfe for his Church, and in that respect he calleth himselfe that Iohn. 10. 11. Good sheepheard that gaue his life for his sheepe. & 15. 13. Greater loue then this hath no man. What will not he doe for his spouse, that gaue his life for her? This may seeme to be too high a straine, and pitch of loue for an husband to attaine vnto: a matter wherein he is to How hus∣bands must loue their wiues more then them∣selues. 1 Iohn. 3. 16. eaue his patterne, and not to follow Christ: but yet S. Iohn addeth euen this extent to the loue of our brethren: We ought saith he) to lay downe our liues for the brethren: therefore by ust consequence for our wiues. But that this extent be not stretched too farre, and husbands cast into a pit of needlesse erill, two cautions must be noted, 1. That there be an absolute necessity, to bring vs to this Cautions a∣bout an hus∣bands louing his wife more then himselfe. raite of parting with our life: which is, when the good we ime at in the behalfe of our wiues cannot any other way be ffected, but by venturing our life. There was no other way  redeeme the Church, but by the bloud of Christ. 2. That the good we intend in this case to our wiues be of reater valew then our temporall life: as is the good of her ule, the sauing of it. Thus the Apostle saith, I will most gladly bestowed for your soules. Which minde men must much more 2 Cor. 12. 15. rie towards their wiues. It was for our saluation that Christ ue himselfe. §. 70. Of husbands vnkindnesse. Contrary is their vnkindnesse that preferre euery trifle of eir owne before the good of their wiues: their profit, their easure, their promotion, cleane draw away their hearts and fections from their wiues. If any extraordinary charge must  laid out, or pains taken for their wiues good, little loue ll then appeare: whereby it appeares that there was no true d sound loue setled in their hearts towards their wiues. As ld and other like mettals are tryed by the fire, so loue by ictions and crosses. §. 71. Of combats in pretence of wiues honour. Contrary in another extreme is the ouer-bold and ouer-hea∣dy
pretended manhood of such husbands as vpon euery iea∣lous surmize and sleight report, are ready to make challenges of fight, and to enter into single combats and duels, on pre∣tence of maintaining their wiues honour. This being no war∣rantable course of righting a wrong, no honour can redound to the wife thereby, but much dishonour and danger to the husband. If he preuaile ouer his aduersarie and kill, he is made guilty of murther thereby, and so reproach and shame must needs come to himselfe, wife, and whole family: if he be ouercome and slaine, she may be reputed more guilty then she was before. And oft it falleth out that God in iust iudgement giueth ouer the challenger into his aduersaries hand, because he hath vndertaken so indirect a course. §. 72. Of husbands Treat. 3. §. 6. 6 Christs loue perpetuall. Constancy in loue. VI. The continuance of Christs loue was without date: Ioh. 13. 1. Hauing loued his owne, he loued them vnto the end. His loue was constant (not by fits, now louing, then hating) and Hos. 2. 19. euer∣lasting (neuer repenting thereof, neuer changing or altering his minde) no prouocations, no transgressions could euer make him forget to loue, and cease to doe that good which he intended for his Church: note what he said to her euen when she reuoulted from him, Thou hast played the harlot with many Ier. 3. 1. 2 Sam. 7. 15. louers, yet returne againe to me: and againe, My mercy shall not depart away. For his loue resteth not on the desert of his Church, but on the vnchangeablenesse of his owne will. As this manifested Christs loue to be true sound loue, so it made it profitable and beneficiall to the Church, which, notwithstanding her many frailties, by virtue hereof is glorified. This last branch must be added to all the former branches Husbands must be con∣stant in their loue. of an husbands loue, or else they will be all in vaine and to no purpose. This giueth the truest tryall of sound loue. Such was the loue betwixt Dauid and Ionathan: the soundest loue that euer was, betwixt partie and partie. This bringeth the greatest glory to the partie which loueth: and the greatest be∣nefit to the partie which is loued. That a mans loue may thus remaine firme and inuiolable, 1. He must be sure to lay a good foundation; he must
ground his loue on Gods ordinance: and loue his wife in re∣gard of the matrimoniall bond which knitteth them together, and that neere vnion which thence ariseth; and so it will last so long as that knot lasteth. 2. He must further support and strengthen it with an inui∣olable resolution to be changed and altered with no prouoca∣tion, but rather to passe by all infirmities; indeauouring in loue to redresse them if possibly he can: if not, to beare with them. §. 73. Of husbands variablenesse. Contrary is their variablenesse, whose loue is ready to turne as a weather cocke with euery blast of a contrary winde: now ender-hearted, then againe hard-hearted: now smiling, then owring: now giuing this and that fauour, then denying eue∣ry thing, euen such things as are needfull. Many whose loue was as hot as fire while their wiues were oung, or their friends liued, or while they pleased them, when hose occasions are taken away, proue in their loue as cold s ice. Againe others by some continuance in doing good to their wiues, thinke it a burden: and waxing weary cleane leaue off heir former good course; which plainly sheweth that they ne∣er truly and intirely loued their wiues. By this patterne of Christ here propounded to husbands, e haue on the one side a good direction to teach vs how to ue our wiues, as hath beene particularly declared; and on the ther side, matter of humiliation, in that it sheweth vs how re short we come of our bounden duty. Howsoeuer, wiues ay most complaine of their burden, because it is a Subiection hereunto by nature we are all loath to yeeld: yet I am sure See Treat. 1. §. 10. e heauiest burden is laid vpon the husbands shoulders: and uch more easie it is to performe the part of a good wife, then a good husband. §. 74. Of husbands louing their wiues Treat. 3. §. 59. as themselues. To the example of Christ the Apostle annexeth the pat∣ne of ones selfe, in these words: So ought men to loue their Eph. 5. 28. es as their owne bodies.
Quest. Is not the former patterne sufficient? Is this latter more excellent, or more perfect? Answ. Christs example is a full, compleat, perfect, and To Christs ex∣ample, the patterne of ones selfe is added. euery way sufficient patterne; farre more excellent then this of a mans selfe: this is not annexed to adde any thing to that, or in regard of the excellency hereof, but only in regard of our dulnesse, to make the point somewhat more plaine and per∣spicuous. 1. Because it is more sensi∣ble. For this patterne is more sensible and better discer∣ned. Euery one knoweth how he loueth his owne body: but few or none know how Christ loueth his Church. Besides, 2. Because it is more imita∣ble. that example of Christ may seeme too high and excellent for any to attaine vnto, euen inimitable; therefore to shew that he requireth no more then a man may performe, if he will set himselfe with care and conscience to doe his duty, he addeth the patterne of ones selfe; that which one doth to his body, if he will, he may doe to his wife. No direction can be taken from this latter patterne, but The patterne of louing ones selfe setteth forth the same things that Christs loue doth. might be referred to the former, as most of the former (though in a farre meaner manner) may be referred to the latter. For the loue which a man beareth to himselfe is true, and intire without all dissimulation: the most dissembling wretch in the world (who in his dealings with other men doth nothing vp∣rightly) nor will nor can dissemble with himselfe; though o∣ther men shall neuer know the depth of his heart, yet the spi∣rit 1 Cor. 2. 11. which is in him, euen himselfe, knoweth it: so as this patterne also presseth truth and sincerity on husbands in their affection towards their wiues: of all other they may not dissemble and deale doubly with them; but let them know the intirenesse of their affection towards them: and see they neither faune o them, nor flatter them. They which pretend great loue to their wiues in shew only, offend against nature it selfe. As the foresaid loue of a mans owne selfe is for manner intire and true, so also free not forced: and for measure as great as possibly i can be, and for continuance, constant, and so like to Christ loue. But there are two points especially to be considered in the loue of ones selfe which aboue others are most sensibly dis∣cerned Man is tender towards him∣selfe. in this patterne. 1. Tendernesse. 2. Cheerefulnesse. No other man will or can so tenderly handle a mans hand
arme, legge or any other part of his body, as himselfe: he is very sensible of his owne smart. The metaphors which the Apostle vseth in these words, He nourisheth and cherisheth it, doe liuely set forth this tender∣nesse: Eph. 5. 29. for they are taken from fowles and birds which very charily, and tenderly houer ouer their young ones, couering them all ouer with their wings and feathers, but so bearing vp their bodies as no weight lieth vpon them. Thus ought husbands with all tendernesse, and mildnesse Husbands must deale tenderly with their wiues. to deale with their wiues, as we haue before noted in many particulars: only this example of a mans selfe I thought good to set before husbands, as a liuely patterne wherein they might behold a president without exception, going before them, and whereby they might receiue excellent direction for the better performing of the particulars before noted. Againe, no friend, no parent, no other party will or can so Man is cheere∣full in doing himselfe good. willingly and cheerefully doe any kindnesse for one, as a man for himselfe. This among other is one especiall point which the law aimeth at, when it enioynes a man to loue his neighbour Leu. 19. 18. as himselfe, namely, as willingly and readily as himselfe. What∣soeuer a man doth for himselfe he doth much more cheere∣fully then for another. There needeth no other proofe then experience. Let men take notice of their owne minde and dis∣position when they doe things for themselues, and this will be as cleere as the light when the Sunne shineth forth at oone day. Such an affection ought husbands to haue to their wiues: Husbands must be cheerefull in seeking their wiues good. they ought more willingly and cheerefully to doe any thing or their wiues then for parents, children, friends or any other. Though this cheerefulnesse be an inward disposition of the eart, yet may it be manifested by a mans forwardnesse and adinesse to doe his wife good: when his wife shall no soo∣ner desire a kindnesse, then he will be ready to grant it: as ooz saith to Ruth, I will doe to thee all that thou requirest; yea, Ruth 3. 11. by any meanes he may know that this or that will be be∣oofull to her, though she desire it not, yet to effect it for her: which was the minde of the said Booz to Ruth, as the history  many particulars sheweth.
Contrary is the disposition of those husbands who so grudgingly, repiningly, and discontentedly doe those things which they doe in their wiues behalfe, as their wiues had ra∣ther they were not done at all. The manner of doing them causeth more griefe to tender hearted wiues, then the things themselues can doe good. Hitherto of the manner which husbands ought to obserue in performing their duties. The reasons to inforce the same remaine to be handled. §. 75. Of Christs example, a motiue to prouoke husbands to loue their wiues. The forenamed examples of Christ and of our selues as Generall reasons. 1. Christs example. they are patternes for our direction, so generall motiues to prouoke and stirre vs vp the more to performe all the fore∣named duties after the manner prescribed. A greater, and stronger motiue cannot be yeelded then the Christs exam∣ple the grea∣test motiue that can be. example of Christ. Example in it selfe is of great force to pro∣uoke vs to doe any thing: especially if it be the example of some great one, a man of place and renoune. But who greater then Christ? What more worthy patterne? If (as was Treat. 3. §. 74. shewed) the example of the Church be of great force to moue wiues to be subiect to their husbands, the ex∣ample of Christ must needs be of much greater force to moue husbands to loue their wiues. A great honour it is to be like vnto Christ: and his example is a perfect patterne. Two things there be which in Christs example are espe∣cially Two things in Christs pat∣terne pro∣uoke hus∣bands to loue their wiues. to be noted to moue husbands to loue their wiues. 1. That great inequality which is betwixt him and his spouse. 2. That small benefit which he reapeth by louing her. For the better discerning of that inequality, the greatnesse of 1. The great inequality betwixt Christ and his spouse. Christ on the one side, and the meanesse of the Church on the other, are duly to be weighed. Christs greatnesse is in Scripture set forth by comparing him with creatures, and the Creator. Compared with creatures he is farre more excellent then the most excellent, as the Apo∣stle by many arguments proueth in the first chapter to Hebr. that whole chapter is spent in proofe of this point: And in
another place it is said that Eph. 1. 21. He is set farre aboue all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and euery name that is named not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. Compared with the Creator he is no whit inferiour to him, but Phil. 2. 6. equall: Heb. 1. 3. Being the brightnesse of glory, and the expresse image of his person: and that Iob. 1. 1, 3. word of whom it is said, In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God: All things were made by him &c. So as he is the very Creator himselfe, eternall, infinite, incomprehensible. Thus is Christs greatnesse inexplicable. The meanesse of the Church is as low on the other side: she is a creature, fashioned out of the earth, proceeding from the loines of corrupt Adam, not only finite, but in it selfe vile and base: The Prophet Ezec. 16. 1. &c. Ezechiel doth set her forth in her liuely colours as she is in her selfe. Compared therefore vnto Christ she is Isa. 40. 17. nothing, lesse then nothing. What equality, what proportion can there then be betwixt Christ and her? But if man and woman be compared together, we shall finde a neere equality: and that both in the points of their humi∣liation, and also of their exaltation. In regard of the former, they are both of the same mould, of the same corrupt nature, subiect to the same infirmities, at length brought to the same end. In regard of the latter the best and greatest priuiledges are common to both of them: they are both made after the same image, redeemed by the same price, partakers of the same grace, and heires together of the same inheritance. Quest. What is then the preferment of the male kinde? What is the excellency of an husband? Answ. Only outward and momentany. Outward, in the things of this world only: for Gal. 3. 28. in Christ Iesus they are both one. Momentany, for the time of this life only: for Mat. 22. 30. in the resur∣rection they neither marie, nor are giuen in mariage, but are as the Angels of God in heauen: then all subiection of wiues to husbands ceaseth. To conclude this point, the inequality betwixt Christ and the Church, and equality betwixt man and wife being such as hath beene declared; seeing Christ vouchsafeth to loue his Church, ought not man thereby be moued to loue his wife?
The other point concerning the small benefit which Christ 2. The small benefit that Christ rea∣peth by louing his Church. reapeth by his Church, will yet further inforce the point: for il∣lustration whereof we will note the great benefit which man reapeth by his wife. The benefit which Christ reapeth from the Church is in one word nothing. For Christ is in himselfe Al-sufficient: he neither needeth any thing, nor can receiue any thing: Iob 35. 7. If thou be est righteous, what giuest thou to him? Or what receiueth he of thine hand? Yet abundantly he bestoweth all manner of gifts, temporall, and spirituall, earthly and heauenly. It was not therefore his owne good that he respected in louing the Church, but her good: for he being 1 Tim. 3. 16. God became man; being Lord of heauen and earth, he tooke vpon him Phil. 2. 6, 7. the forme of a seruant; being 2 Cor. 8 9. rich he became poore: hauing the Reu. 1. 18. Keyes of hell and of death, and being Act. 3. 15. the Lord of life, he Phil. 2. 8. humbled himselfe, and became obedient vnto the death: thus to shew loue to his Church he left much for her sake, but receiued nothing of her. But the benefit which man reapeth from a wife is very great: for Gen. 2. 18. It was not good for a man to be alone: in so much as Pro. 18. 22. He who findeth a wife findeth a good thing; and that in all the points of goodnesse, a profitable thing, a comfortable thing, a de∣lightfull thing. They know not the benefit of the maried estate, who See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 27. prefer single life before it, especially if the maried estate be ordered by Gods word, and man and wife carefull to performe their owne duty each to other. To apply this point also, and to bring it to the conclusion: Christs ex∣ample remo∣ueth all pre∣tences which men make for not louing their wiues. If Christ who can receiue nothing from the Church notwith∣standing loue her, ought not men much more to loue their wiues, who many waies receiue much good from them, and without whom they cannot well be? This example of Christ is the rather to be noted, because it cleane wipeth away all those false colours, and vaine pretences which many alledge as reasons, to shew that there is little rea∣son they should loue their wiues: some of their pretences are these. 1. Their wiues are of a farre meaner ranke then 1. Obiect. themselues; should they then performe duty to their inferi∣ours?
They commonly who marrie their kitchin maids, or others farre vnder their degree, alledge this pretence. Answ. I might reply, That mariage aduanceth a wife to the degree of her husband: and that it was his owne follie to marrie one so meane: but for the purpose and point in hand, let any tell me, whether the supposed disparitie betwixt them & their wiues, be in any degree comparable to that which is betwixt Christ and the Church: yet Christ thinketh not much to doe duties of loue to his Church. 2. There is nothing in their wiues worthy to be loued. 2. Obiect. Answ. This very thing, that such an one is thy wife, is matter enough to make her worthy of loue. But what was there in the Church to make her worthy of Christs loue? If it be said that she is endued with many excellent graces, which make her amiable in Christs sight: I answer, that of her selfe she hath none of those graces, Christ hath bestowed them vpon her, and so made her miable: and thus oughtest thou to endeuour by vsing all good meanes thou canst to make thy wife answerable to thy loue: but howsoeuer, to loue her. 3. Their wiues giue iust occasion to be hated by reason of their 3. Obiect. beeuishnesse, stoutnesse, insolencie, and other like intolerable ices. Answ. No occasion may seeme iust to moue an husband to hate his wife: nor any vice seeme to him intolerable: with goodnes he ught to ouercome euill. If notorious sins seemed intolerable to Christ, or that he thought any occasion iust to cause hatred, many hat are of his Church would oft draw his hatred vpon them: but Christ hateth neuer a member of his Church. 4. There is no hope that euer I shall receiue any helpe of my 4. Obiect. wife, or benefit from her. Ans. There is little charitie in such as can conceiue no hope: for ue hopeth all things: but yet the case so standeth with Christ. The 1. Cor. 13. 7. Church is so vtterly vnable to help or benefit him, as he may iustly y, he cannot hope to receiue any thing frō her. Christ loueth the hurch for her own good, not for his; so ought husbands. Thus if Christs example be well weighed, & obserued of husbands, it will ford matter enough to remoue euery doubt or scruple raised to enate their affections from their wiues. Fitly therefore hath the
Apostle set it before husbands, both to direct them how to loue their wiues, and also to moue them so to doe. §. 76. Of a mans loue to himselfe, a motiue to prouoke him to loue his wife. To the same purpose that Christs example tendeth, tendeth also the patterne of a mans selfe. Great is the affection that a man beareth to himselfe, to his owne flesh, his owne bodie: he neuer hateth, but euer loueth himselfe: no sore, no disease, no paine, no stinch that the flesh bringeth to a man, can make him hate it: but rather all manner of infirmities doe make him the more to pitty, tender, and cherish it. This is a worke of nature: the most hea∣thenish, and barbarous, that euer were, doe it. Now a wife being to a man as his bodie and his flesh (for they two are one flesh) and God hauing commanded men to loue their wiues as their owne bodies, these conclusions will necessarily follow from this motiue: 1. He that loueth not his wife is more caried with the instinct of nature, then with the expresse charge of the God of nature. Na∣tures instinct moueth him to loue his bodie. But Gods expresse charge moueth him not, to loue his wife. 2. He that loueth not his wife is worse then an infidell and a barbarian, yea then a very beast: for all these loue their owne bo∣dies, and their owne flesh: but a wife (by Gods ordinance) is as ones bodie, and his flesh. 3. He that loueth his wife loueth himselfe: the Apostle him∣selfe vers. 28. in these very words layeth downe this conclusion: from whence by the rule of contraries this also will follow, He that lo∣ueth not his wife, loueth not himselfe. 4. He that loueth not his wife cannot but bring woe and mis∣chiefe vpon himselfe. For the damage and mischiefe which fol∣loweth on a wife, through any neglect of dutie on her husband part, followeth also on him: as the mischiefe which followeth on the bodie through any negligence of the head, lighteth also on the head. If these be not motiues sufficient to prouoke an husband to loue his wife, I know not what can be sufficient.
The fifth Treatise. Duties of Children. §. 1. Of the generall Heads of Childrens duties. EPHES. 6. 1. Children obey your Parents in the Lord: for this is right. 2. Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandement with promise.) 3. That it may be well with thee: and thou maist liue long on the earth. THe second couple in a familie are Parents. Children. In laying downe their duties, the Apostle beginneth with children: his direction, and instigation vnto them is laid downe in the three first verses of the sixt chapter: wherein 1. He declareth their dutie. 2. He addeth reasons to inforce the same. In laying downe their dutie he noteth three points. 1. Wherein it consisteth, (obey, honour.) 2. To whom it is to be performed (your parents.) 3. After what manner it is to be done (in the Lord.) The reasons vsed by the Apostle are foure. 1. The place of parents (in the Lord.) 2. The aequitie of the thing (this is right.) 3. The charge of God (Honour thy father, &c.) 4. The reward promised (That it may goe well, &c.)
Vnder this word (obey) which the Apostle vseth, and that word (honour) which the law vseth, are all those duties com∣prised, which any where thorowout the whole Scripture are inioyned to children. We will therefore set them downe in some order, and han∣dle them distinctly one after another. 1. The Fountaine of childrens duties is to be searched out. 2. The Streames that flow from thence are to be obserued. The Fountaine is an inward disposition of the heart com∣pounded of loue and feare. The Streames issuing from thence extend vnto parents, both while they are liuing, and also when they are dead. Childrens duties which are to be performed to their pa∣rents while they liue, haue respect to their Authoritie. Necessitie.   The Authoritie of parents requireth of children Reuerence. Obedience.   Their Necessitie requireth Recompence. The duties which children owe to their parents deceased, respect their Body. Credit.   Their Body with decency must be buried. Their Credit with honour must be maintained. §. 2. Of Childrens loue to their Parents. I make the fountaine of childrens duties to be a mixed and compound disposition, in respect of that authoritie and affecti∣on which is mixed together in parents. The authoritie of pa∣rents requireth feare in children: and their affection, loue. So intire and so ardent is parents affection towards their children, as it would make children too bold and insolent if there were not authoritie mixed therewith to worke feare: and so supreme and absolute is their authoritie ouer them, as it would make children like slaues to dread their parents, if a fatherly affection were not tempered therewith to breed loue. But both these ioyned together make a very good composition: loue like su∣gar sweetneth feare, and feare like salt seasoneth loue: and thus, to ioyne them both together, it is a louing-feare, or a fearing∣loue, which is the ground of childrens duties.
Where Christ forbiddeth an excessiue loue in children to Mat. 10. 37. their parents, he implieth that parents are a fit obiect for chil∣dren to loue (so as their loue be wel moderated:) yea he implieth that it is an affection euen by nature ingraffed in children to loue their parents. Ioseph is commended vnto children as a worthy patterne in louing his father, and that from his youth till the decease of his father: in testimony whereof in his younger yeeres he brought to his father the euill report of his Gen. 37. 2. brethren, whereby he incurred their enuie and hatred, which he would neuer haue done, if he had not loued his father: and hauing beene long absent from his father, when by Gods pro∣uidence there was offered an occasion for him to meet with his brethren, one of his first questions to them was about their fa∣ther: Gen. 43. 7. and hearing that he was liuing, he thought it not enough to send him food for his need, but must also needs see his face, Gen. 45. 9. and haue him dwell with him: and while his father was in the way he went out to meet him, and at first sight fell on his neck, Gen. 46. 29. and wept a good while (a token of great affection.) That loue which naturally parents beare to their children, Reasons. 1. Equitie. ought in equitie to breed in children a loue to their parents. For loue deserueth loue: and most vnworthy are they to be loued, who cannot loue againe. The loue of parents aboue all others is to be answered with loue on childrens part to the vttermost of their power, because it is free, great, and constant. Besides, there is a necessitie of loue in children to their pa∣rents, 2 Necessitie. lest for want thereof, their subiection (which of all o∣thers ought to be most free) should turne into slauish seruitude. This ought children the rather to labour after, because by nature they are nothing so prone to loue their parents, as their parents are to loue them. Loue is weightie, and, as weighty things, it descendeth. Children therefore with conscience of dutie must labour to make supply of this defect, and helpe na∣ture by grace. I denie not but naturally there is in children a greater loue to their parents, then to others: yet in compari∣son of the heat of parents loue to them, their loue to their pa∣rents is but cold. Wherfore as the heat of the Sun shining much and long on a stone wall, draweth a reflection of heat from that wall: so the hot beames of parents loue, which with
feruency and constancy is cast on children, ought to prouoke and stirre vp children to send forth a reflection of loue on their parents. Two extreames are contrary to this affection of loue. One is want of naturall affection, which is a vice most odious . Rom. 1. 30. 2 Tim. 3. 3. and abominable in all, but most of all in children. The Apo∣stle reckoneth this among the most heighnous vices that be. The other is hatred and despight of parents: a vice more then monstrous, and vnnaturall. From thence commeth mocking and cursing of parents, whereof we shall afterwards heare. §. 3. Of a childes feare of his parent. To the forenamed dutie of loue, must feare be added, which is a childes awfull respect of his parent. This awfull respect ariseth from an honourable esteeme which a childe in his iudgement and opinion hath of his pa∣rent, as he is his parent; and from it proceedeth on the one side, a desire and indeauour in all things to please the parent, and on the other side a loathnesse to offend him. In this respect the feare of a childe is opposed to the feare of a slaue. For a childes feare being mixed with loue, hath respect to the offence which a parent may take; but a slaues feare, which is ordinarily mixed with hatred, hath respect to no∣thing but the punishment which his master may inflict vpon him. The forenamed feare is so proper to children, as that awfull respect which the Saints beare to God, is called a See Treat. 1. §. 4. sili∣all or child-like feare. This feare in a childe is an especiall branch of that Exo. 20. 12. honour which the law requireth of children to their parents: and it is in Leu. 19. 3. expresse termes inioyned to children by the law. That phrase which God vseth of Miriam (Num. 12. 14. If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seuen daies?) sheweth that there ought to be such a feare of the parent in a childes heart, as should worke shame in it when the parent is offended. A worthy patterne we haue hereof in Gen. 27. 12. Iaakob, who was loath to gaine the blessing with offence of his father. This feare keepeth loue in compasse: and restraineth a childe Reasons. 1. Feare orde∣reth loue. from ouermuch saucinesse, and malipartnesse.
And it is a cause of a childes reuerend and dutifull carriage 2. It well gui∣deth the carri∣age. to his parent. For as the heart is affected the carriage will be ordered. Contrary hereunto is that light, or (which is more abomi∣nable) Contrary, light and base esteeme of parents. that base and vile esteeme of parents, which is in the heart of many children: especially if parents be poore, of low degree, vnlearned, ignorant, or subiect to any infirmities. It cannot be but that Gen. 9. 22. Cham had too light, if not a base e∣steeme of his father, when he derided him. A true filiall feare would haue restrained him from that extreme. Wherefore to breed and cherish this feare, and to preuent, How to breed and cherish a filiall feare. r redresse the contrary extreme, let children well informe themselues of their parents place and authoritie, how they are in Gods stead, and a meanes vnder God of their childrens being: children haue receiued their very substance from the sub∣tance of their parents. In which respect though they should eeme contemptible to others, yet not to their children. Thus much of a childes inward disposition towards his pa∣rent. The manifestation thereof must be by his outward carriage: and that in two things; Reuerence, and Obedience: both which respect a parents authoritie. §. 4. Of a childes Reuerence in refraining speech before his parent, and in hearkening to his parent. The outward reuerence which children owe to their pa∣nts consisteth partly in their speech, partly in their carriage. Their speech both to and of their parents must sauour reuerence. To their parents in presence. OF their parents in absence. In presence, by refraining their speech. well framing     For refraining speech two vertues are requisite Silence. Patience.   Silence in forbearing to speake. breaking of speech. Children ought to for∣beare speaking in their pa∣rents presence   Patience in hearkening to their parents. The two branches of silence, in forbearing to speake (espe∣lly when parents are speaking, or till parents giue leaue to
their children to speake,) and in breaking off speech, when parents come into the place where children are speaking, are tokens of great reuerence. Thus children testifie that there are some in place whom they much respect and honour. Iob doth thus set forth the respect which Princes and others did beare to him in his prosperitie, The Princes (saith he) refrained Iob. 29. 9, 10. talking, and laid their hand vpon their mouth, the Nobles held their peace, &c. Namely, while he was in presence, or while he spake. The like may be said of childrens patience in induring Children must patiently hearken to their parents speech. Vers. 25. their parents speech; which Iob also noteth in these words, Vnto me men gaue eare, and waited, and kept silence. Though parents in their speech seeme to be long and tedious, yet must children indure it. And it is very needfull that patience be added to silence, be∣cause many parents in tender loue of their children, and ear∣nest desire of their good, thinke they can neuer speake enough in instructing and admonishing them. The many exhortati∣ons Gen. 49. 2. Pro. 1. 8, & 4. 1. & 7. 1. giuen in Scripture vnto children to heare, hearken, giue eare, giue heed, marke, and obserue the words of their parents, doe imply the forenamed silence and patience: for they who Iam 1. 19. ought to be swift to heare must be slow to speake. I denie not but much more is intended vnder those phrases, namely, obe∣dience: yet must these also be presupposed: for he that will not in silence patiently hearken to his parents while they speake, will much lesse obey what they say. Contrary to silence is sawcinesse (as we speake) and ouer∣much Contrary, 1. boldnesse of speech. boldnesse in children, when, without due respect of their parents presence, they will be prating of this thing or that thing: insomuch as if strangers should come into the roome where such children are, they would not thinke that their parents were in presence; or if they knew it, they might well thinke that such children beare little respect to their parents. Contrary to patience in hearing, is fretting and murmuring 2. Impatient hearkening to parents. against parents (if at least their speech be any whit long) an flinging or slinking away before they haue done. These faults are the greater, if children by their loquacitie, or impati∣encie hinder or interrupt their parents speech when they are
giuing any admonition or instruction: for thus they shew both too light a respect of their parents: and also too little regard of the meanes of their owne good. §. 5. Of a childes reuerend framing his speech to his parent. A childes reuerence in well framing his speech to his pa∣rents A childs reue∣rence in speech is ma∣nifested, 1. By reuerend titles. may many waies be manifested, as 1. By giuing vnto them reuerend and honourable titles. No title can be more honourable then that which is most pro∣per and vsuall, Father to the one parent, and Mother to the other. God taketh the title Jer. 31. 9. Gal. 4. 6. Father vnto himselfe, as a title of great dignity. Obiect. This title is so proper to God, as Matt. 23. 9. We are to call none n earth Father. Answ. This is not simply to be taken of the title it selfe, but of the minde of him that giueth or affecteth that title. If it be affected or giuen to obscure Gods Fatherhood, or to make a man a Father of himselfe without dependance on God, r reference to him, who is properly the father of all, it is an mpious and sacrilegious title. But otherwise lawfull and warrantable. In Scripture the title Father is giuen to all degrees of digni∣ties among men, as to 1 Sam. 24. 12. Kings, 2 Kin. 5. 13. Captaines, and other chiefe Gouernours, to Judg. 18. 19. Priests, 2 King. 6. 21. Prophets, 1 Cor. 4. 15. Apostles, and other 1 Tim. 5. 1. Mi∣nisters. In the fift commandement all superiours are compri∣ed vnder it, therefore Father is a title of great honour: and y the rule of relation Mother is a title of as great honour to e female sex. Religious and dutifull children haue euer vsed  giue those titles to their parents. My Father, saith Gen. 22. 7. Isaak to Abraham, and & 27. 18. Iaakob to Isaak. 1 King. 2. 20. My Mother, saith Salomon to athsheba. I finde also the title of Matt. 21. 30. Sir or Lord, vsed: a title . Gen. 31. 35.  f honour. 2. By vsing few words before their parents: and those few 2. By few words. ot without iust occasion, being first spoken to by their pa∣nts, or hauing leaue of them, or making knowne to them me needfull matter: at least not against their parents liking, as their parents should be offended thereby. And if they bserue their parents to be vnwilling to heare them speake any ore of such and such a matter, then ought they to lay their
hands vpon their mouthes, as Isaak (Gen. 22. 7.) and Iaa∣kob (Gen. 27. 12.) This is a token of great respect. 3. By meeke and humble speeches. Such was the speech of 3. By humble speech. 1 Sam. 19 4. Ionathan the naturall sonne of Saul, and of & 24. 10. Dauid his son in law, wherewith he was much contented, and his wrath pa∣cified. 4. By obseruing a fit opportunity: as when parents are not 4 By seasona∣ble speech. seriously busied, or in company, or in passion. When 1 Sam. 19. 6. Saul was out of passion, how well did he accept Ionathans Apolo∣gie for Dauid? but & 20. 30. in his passion, how ill did he take it? This wise obseruing of fit opportunity sheweth great reuerence. 5. By a present, ready, willing, pleasing answer, when by 5. By ready answers. their parents they shall be spoken vnto. Eli was as a father to Samuel: therefore when 1 Sam. 3. 4, 6, Samuel thought that Eli called him, he presently and readily answered, Here am I: and when Eli was instant to know what the Lord had said to him, 18. Samuel told him euery whit, and held nothing from him. Mat. 21. 30. The younger son (no∣ted in the parable) shewed a sonne-like reuerence in giuing a willing and ready answer to his father, though he failed in his obedience, by not performing what he promised. §. 6. Of the vices in children contrary to the forenamed reue∣rence in speech. Contrary to those branches of reuerence in speech are, Contrary, 1. Scorning to acknow∣ledge a pa∣rent. 1. Pride: when children scorne to giue the title of Father, or Mother, to their parents. This is the minde of many who haue gotten more wealth or honour, then euer their parents had. In publicke especially such children most refuse to giue those titles. Salomon was not so minded. He being a great king, sitting vpon his throne, in sight and hearing of all his people that were about him, called Bathsheba Mother. 1 King. 2. 20. If children had that regard to the honour of their parents which they should, they being themselues in places of honour and dignity, would the rather openly call their parents Father and Mother, that they might be knowne to be the father and mother of so eminent a person. 2. Loquacity, and too much importunity, or rather impu∣dency 2. Too much importunitie. in speech, when children hauing to doe with their pa∣rents, can neuer haue done (as we speake) but must needs v
matters to the very vttermost. Many parents are oft much pro∣uoked hereby. It skilleth not that the childe haue the right, especially in a matter of no great consequence. For reuerence sake the childe must forbeare, at least for a time. And if the matter of difference be weighty, as in points of religion, the child must either take some other opportunity of better infor∣ming his parent, or else get some other wise friend to doe it. 3. Stoutnesse, when children answer their parents as if they 3. Stout an∣swers. Ne filius cum patre quoquo modo expostu∣let, cum lex in∣terdixit, tum anteleges ipsa natura. Greg. Naz. in senten. Matt. 21. 29. Luke 15. 29. were their equals: giuing word for word. It doth as ill become children to answer againe, as seruants (to whom the Apostle hath expresly forbidden it, Tit. 2. 9.) Both law and nature forbiddeth children to be prouoked hereunto, by any thing that their parents say or doe; how great then is their fault who giue scornefull and stout words to their parents when they are no way prouoked, as the elder sonne noted in the pa∣able, and the elder brother of the prodigall childe? 4. Indiscretion, when children haue no respect to any time, businesse, or temper, of their parents in speaking to them, and 4. Vnseasona∣ble speech. Ephes. 6. 4. so, much prouoke them. It is laid downe as a caueat to parents, that they prouoke not their children to wrath. How much more must children obserue that cauear? 5. Stubbornesse, when children pout, loure, swell, and giue 5. Stomach∣full silence. o answer at all to their parents. This is too common a fault in children, and many parents are much offended and grieued hereat. We heard §. 4. before of a childelike silence which was ery commendable, and a token of great reuerence; but this is worthy of much blame, a token of great vndutifulnesse; and carefully to be avoided, as that to be practised. §. 7. Of childrens reuerend speeches of their parents. So true and intire ought that reuerend respect to be which children beare to their parents, as their speech not only to them efore their faces, but also of them behinde their backes, must  so framed both for matter and manner, when they haue any casion to fall into speech of their parents, as all that heare em may note them to beare a reuererend respect to their rents. Direction for children how to speake of their parents. As a generall direction for the better performing of this ty, let children speake nothing of their parents that they
would be loath should come to their parents eare. More par∣ticularly, let them speake of those things which most tend to their commendation, that so (as Christ said of his fa∣ther Iohn 8. 49.) they may honour their parents. Let other things be bu∣ried in silence so much as in them lieth. And if others speake of matters disgracefull to their parents, let them interpret in the better sense things doubtfull, and, so farre as they may, ex∣tenuate things euident, and sharply reproue them that slander their parents. This is that blessing which children owe to their parents, for neglecting whereof the wiseman taxeth chil∣dren saying, There is a generation that doth not blesse their Prou. 30. 11. mother. Contrary to that kinde of blessing is discouering of parents Childrens vn∣reuerend spee∣ches of their parents. infirmities, noted in cursed Gen. 9. 22. Cham, and broaching vntruths of them, noted in impious 2 Sam. 15. 3. Absolom, and mocking and cur∣sing them Prou. 30. 11. expresly condemned. The reward whereof is by Leu. 20. 9. Gods law death: yea a shamefull and ignominious death, for the Pro. 30. 17. Rauens of the valley shall plucke out his eies, and the young Ea∣gles shall eat it: Gen. 40. 19. which phrase setteth forth the end of a noto∣rious malefactor that is hanged. §. 8. Of a childs reuerend cariage to his parent. As the speech, so the cariage of children towards their pa∣rents must be seasoned with reuerence: for 1. This is a fruit, and proofe of filiall feare as well as that. 2. Of the two, this is the surer euidence: for actions are better signes of the disposition of the heart then words. 3. Faire words ioyned with contrary deeds, cannot but be accounted meerely complementall and hypocriticall. 4. Where there is a contrariety betwixt words and deeds, the one will be a witnesse against the other, and that mans condemnation the greater. Childrens re∣uerence to their parents manifested, 1. by meeting them. Wherefore let all reuerence be manifested in childrens be∣hauiour to their parents, and that in these and such like in∣stances. 1. If a parent be comming to a childe, and the childe ob∣serue it, let him haste to meet his parent: so did Gen. 46. 29. Ioseph to his father, and 1 King. 2. 19. Salomon to his mother. Which two examples
are the rather to be noted, because both were in eminent place: one a great gouernour, the other a king. 2. Let such child-like obeisance be performed as becom∣meth 2. By obey∣sance to them. the age and sex, either in going to, remaining before, or going from a parent: as vncouering the head, bending the knee, bowing the body, standing vp, with the like. The two forenamed eminent persons, Gen. 48. 12. Ioseph and 1 King. 2. 19. Solomon, bowed, the one to his father, the other to his mother. 3. Let the countenance, and gesture of the body be so so∣berly 3 By well composing the counte∣nance. and modestly ordered in the presence of the parent, as may argue due respect. 4. Let the vpper place, and hand be giuen to parents: and 4. By giuing the vpper hand. if occasionally a childe be aboue his parent, let him come be∣low him. For that is a manifest token of inferiority and sub∣iection. What maketh men to striue for the vpper hand, but because they would be accounted better then those with whom they striue? But that ought not to be the minde of children to their parents. Quest. What if children be in estate more wealthy, or ho∣nourable then their parents, are they then to giue the hand to them? Answ. No honour is comparable to the dignity of father∣hood: it giueth a greater eminency to the parent ouer his childe, then any other honour can to the childe ouer his pa∣rent. I grant that a childe may by some office, and outward dignity be so aduanced aboue his father, as other men may more honour and reuerence the childe, and giue the vpper place to him: and for order sake the childe may and ought to take it in company: but when they are alone, the childe must rather reuerence the father. 5. According to the custome of the time and place where∣in 5. By asking blessing. they liue, let children aske their parents blessing. §. 9. Of childrens asking their parents blessing, whether it be lawfull or no. Some doubt is made of this duty both in regard of the thing it selfe, and also of the gesture of kneeling vsed in the performance thereof: I will therefore distinctly proue both. For the thing, it is noted of Iaakob that he carried sauory
meat to his father, that he might blesse him: and of Ioseph, that Gen. 27. 19. he went to his father, and carried his two sonnes with him, Gen. 48. 1. &c. that his father might blesse both him and them: for which end the twelue sonnes of Iaakob assembled to their father. Gen. 49. 1. &c. How the bles∣sings which the patriarchs gaue their children are patterns to others. Obiect. These were extraordinary examples: the Patri∣archs were indued with the spirit of prophesie, whereby they reuealed to their children what their estate should be in the times to come: for knowledge whereof their children came to them. 1. Answ. Their blessings were more then predictions of things to come: they were confirmations and assurances to the See Treat. 6. §. 58. children that God would indeed performe that blessing which their parents had pronounced. For they sustained a double person: the person of a Prophet, and of a father; as prophets they foretold things to come: as fathers they obtained the blessings pronounced, and an assurance thereof to their chil∣dren, Heb. 11. 20. and that by faith and praier. 2. Answ. Though all parents cannot with such an extra∣ordinary spirit assure vnto their children any distinct particu∣lar blessing, yet the faithfull praier of parents is an especiall, and ordinary meanes to obtaine a blessing from God vpon their children: and that because of Gods promise which ex∣tends Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. it selfe not only to fathfull parents, but also to their seed. Wherefore as the children of the patriarches came to their fathers to be assured of some extraordinary blessing, so may other children goe to their parents as a meanes to obtaine an ordinary blessing. It is noted of Eliah that by an extraordi∣nary spirit in praier he obtained extraordinary matters: Yet Iam. 5. 17. the Apostle setteth forth that example to all Christians as a motiue to stirre them vp in faith to pray for ordinary bles∣sings. But for further clearing of this point, note the phrase  vsed in the fift commandement as a reason to moue children to honour their parents: this it is word for word, That they may prolong thy daies, &c. how can parents prolong their chil∣drens daies, but by begging that blessing of God? See Treat. 6. §. 4. Prou. 15. 8. How wicked parents may blesse their children. The praiers then of parents are a great blessing to children, and children ought to seeke this blessing of their parents. Obiect. If parents be wicked, their praier is abominati∣on:
what blessing then can children looke for from wicked parents? Answ. Though God heare not wicked parents in loue and goodnesse to themselues, yet for the good of their children he may and will heare them: and that the rather to maintaine a reuerend respect of parents in the heart of their children. For asking a blessing is an acknowledgement of superiority and authority, according to that of the Apostle, The lesse is blessed Heb. 7. 7. of the greater. Concerning the gesture of kneeling, it is answerable to the It is lawfull for children to kneele to their parents. Gen. 48. 12. gesture which of old was vsed by Gods people in like case: of Ioseph it is said that he bowed downe himselfe with his face to the earth. Obiect. Kneeling is a gesture proper to Gods worship. Answ. It is not so proper, but that it may be vsed in ciuill cases: else Christ would haue reproued the young man for kneeling before him as well as for calling him good: for he con∣ceiued Mar. 10. 17. Christ to be but a meere man, and the worship he did him was but ciuill. It is not simply the gesture, but the occasion of the gesture, the minde of him that performeth it, and the end why he per∣formeth it that maketh it diuine, or ciuill. Cornelius fell down before Peter with conceit of some diuine excellency in him, and was not allowed: his manner of worshiping was diuine. The iaylor fell downe before Paul and Silas in acknowledge∣ment of some outward eminency in them, and was not re∣proued: his manner of worshipping was meerely ciuill. The same gesture may be performed to different persons with a different respect. A childe may kneele to his parent, and to the king. Yet it followeth not that he maketh his parent a king. Neither will it follow that by kneeling to his parent he maketh him a God, because men kneele to God. §. 10. Of the vices contrary to childrens reuerend gesture to∣wards their parents. Contrary to the forenamed branches of reuerend gesture, are, Vnreuerend gestures of children. 1. Rudenesse and vnmannerlinesse, when children know not how to put difference betwixt their parents and strangers, but can 1. Rudenesse.
suffer their parents to come to them, and they abide in their place and not stirre to meet them. 2. Disdainfull statelinesse, when they thinke much to stand 2. Stateli∣nesse. bare-headed any while in their parents presence. It falleth out many times, that when parents and children are together before their betters, they will shew more reuerence then these: for the father will stand, and be vncouered, when the sonne sitteth downe and puts on his hat, vpon conceit that his father doth more reue∣rence then is meet: but if it were so, yet the sonne for the fathers sake should stoope somewhat the lower. 3. Wantonnesse and boldnesse, when children are ouer-familiar 3. Boldnesse. with their parents: toying and gigling vpon euery light occasion. This kinde of cariage cannot but much tend to the disgrace and dishonour of parents. For what can they who behold it thinke, but that such children haue beene too much cockered and ill nurtered? 4. Ambition, when children are so ambitiously desirous of place, 4. Ambition. especially in companie, as rather then be vnder some whom they suppose to be at least their equals, they will be aboue their pa∣rents. This oft falleth out, when parents being of a lowly minde, giue place to such as their children, being of a lofty minde, thinke meaner then themselues. Now rather then they will be vnder their inferiours (as they suppose) they will be aboue their pa∣rents. A point of great insolencie. Such ought to be the respect of a childe to his parent, as he should debase himselfe below those that are his inferiours, rather then exalt himselfe aboue his pa∣rent. As with other men, for peace sake, in many cases, a man must depart from his right; so especially with his parent, in case of su∣perioritie. Would not euery one that knowes what honour a childe owes to a father, condemne that childs ambition, that should so stand vpon the place and hand, as to take them of his parent? 5. An ouer-nice and erroneous opinion of those, who thinke it 5. Refusing to aske blessing. vnmeet for any childe to aske their parents blessing. Their owne conceit more swayeth them, then the continuali approued pra∣ctise of Gods people in all ages: not vnlike him whom Solomon saith to be wiser in his owne conceit, then seuen men that can render Pro. 26. 16. a reason. Others, though they doe not so generally disaow this
dutie, yet they thinke it meet only for yong children: not consi∣dering of what yeeres, stature, and state, Ioseph was, when he per∣formed it. As for those, who thinke it not vnlawfull, yet carelesly neglect it, they little consider the benefit of a parents blessing. Profane Esau shall another day rise vp in iudgement against them. He Gen 27. 34. Heb. 12 17. beggd and beggd againe and againe, and that with a loud cry and salt teares, a blessing of his father. Thus much of childrens reuerence. Their obedience followeth. §. 11. Of childrens obedience. The obedience of children doth most proue the authoritie of parents, and is the surest euidence of the honour a childe giueth to his parent: therefore is it Eph. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20. by name in the text expressed, and all other duties are comprised vnder it. Reuerence without obe∣dience is a meere mockage, nothing at all acceptable. Of the two, a childe were better faile in the former: instance the Matt. 21. 31. parable of the two sonnes. Reuerence in comparison of obedience is but a complementall honour. Obedience is a true reall honour; the surest triall of a dutifull childe. Obedience is a dutie so proper to children, as the Apostle applieth it to them as a proper attribute, saying, 1 Pet. 1. 14. as obedient children fashion not, &c. The example of Christ is herein set before vs as a patterne: Luk. 2. 5 1. he was subiect to his parents. Solomon counteth the neglect thereof a Pro. 23. 22. despising of a parent. Contrary is disobedience and rebellion: the greatest impeach∣ment Disobedience most contrary to parents au∣thoritie. of parents authoritie that can be. For to what end is autho∣ritie ouer those who resist it, and rebell against it? The 2 Tim. 3. 2. Apostle reckoneth disobedient children among the lewdest persons that be: and setteth forth their disobedience by Tit 1. 6. . a metaphor taken from vntamed, head-strong beasts, that will not be brought vnder the yoke: the word therefore is not vnfitly translated vnruly: and it is somewhat answerable to an Deut. 13. 13.  ex non & pro∣fuit. Hier. abs∣que iugo. quasi  Hebrew phrase giuen to disobe∣dient children, viz. sonnes of Belial, which is according to the notation as much as sonnes without profit; or, as some will haue it, sonnes without yoke, that is, such children, as refusing to be in subiection vnto parents, are no way profitable, but worke much
mischiefe, and cause great griefe. The Deut. 21. 18, &c. punishment which by Gods law was appointed to disobedient and rebellious children, was a publike shamefull death. §. 12. Of childrens forbearing to doe things without consent of parents. That children may the better know their dutie in this respect, The parts of a childs obedi∣ence. I will distinctly set forth, both the parts, and also the extent of a childs obedience: 1. Wherein it consisteth. 2. How farre it extendeth. The generall parts wherein it consisteth are two: 1. A forbearance from doing things without consent of pa∣rents. Of the seuerall wayes where∣by consent may be giuen, see Treat. 3. 2. A performance of such things as parents will haue done. The former of these is a dutie whereunto children are must bound while they are vnder their parents gouernment. For that §. 19. Num. 30. 17. time the consent of parents is not only meet, but necessarie: and that for these reasons. 1. Children are as the goods of their parents, wholly in their power, to be ordered and disposed by them. On this ground Sa∣tan hauing all that Iob had put into his hand, tooke libertie ouer Iob 1. 12, 19. his children as well as ouer his goods and chattell. 2. Children while they be vnder gouernment, (euen the eldest that are heires) differ nothing from seruants. Galat. 4. 1. 3. By Gods law giuen to the Iewes, parents had power to sell Exod. 21. 7. their children. 4. Parents had power to disanull such things as children had done. Instance the case of a vow made to God, which was one of Num. 30. 4. the most inuiolable things that one could doe. Contrary is the opinion and practise of many, who hold pa∣rents consent at the most but a matter of conueniencie: that it is good, if children will, to haue their parents consent: if they haue it not, the matter is not great: their contracts or other things which they doe, are as firme, and good, without, as with their con∣sents. If this were so, wherein is the authoritie of a parent more then of a wise experienced friend? It is meet, and good to haue such an ones consent. But that the power of parents, and dutie of children in this
point, may the better be seene, I will exemplifie it in fiue particu∣lar cases. 1. Entring into a calling. 2. Making mariage. 3. Dispo∣sing of goods. 4. Ordering apparell. 5. Making vowes. §. 13. Of consent of parents for childrens entring into a calling. I. That children ought to haue the consent of their parents in making choise of their calling, and not place themselues as they please, is euident by the approued practise of the Saints recorded in Gods word. Gen. 28. 2. Iaakob was sent by his parents to Laban to be educated vnder him. 1 Sam. 16. 11, 19. Dauid was appointed by his father to keep sheepe: when Saul was desirous to haue Dauid attend vpon him, he sent to Ishai, Dauids father, for him. In that 1 Sam. 17. 17. Ishai was o carefull to send prouision to his three eldest sons that followed Saul to the warre, we may well thinke, that they went to the warre with his consent. It is noted of Jer. 35. 7. Ionadab, that he appointed his onnes to dwell in tents, and that accordingly they did so, and are ommended and rewarded for this their obedience. It is collected oth by Iustin. Mart. in Dial. cum Tryph. contr. Iud. ancient and Erasm. pa∣raphr. in Mar. 6. Bez annot. in Mar. 6. later Diuines, that our Lord Iesus Christ Basil. lib. de vit. solit. cap. 15. Theod.

This collection is made by comparing Luk. 2. 51. (where his sub∣ction is noted) with Mar. 6. 3. and Mat. 13. 55. where he is cal∣d Muscul. in Mat. 13. Danaeus schol. in Mar. 6.

Equitie requireth that parents should haue an hand in placing th their children, because they brought them forth into the orld, and brought them vp with much care, paines, and charge, hile they were young, and till they were fit for a calling. Besides, Godhath laid it as a charge vpon parents, that they ould see their children well trained vp: great reason therefore 1. Equitie. at parents consent be had in setting forth children to a calling. 2. Gods charge. Bellarm. de Mon. lib. 2. cap. §. 14. Of the vnlawfulnesse of childrens entring into religious orders without consent of parents. Contrary is the opinion of Papists, who say, that children may 36. Licet filijs ingredi religio∣nem inuitis parentibus. er into religious orders, not only without consent, but also a∣nst the minde and good like of their parents. Whereby they  not only patronize apparent disobedience in children, against
the expresse word of God; but also disable children from helping their parents in case of necessitie: for both which Christ rebuked the Scribes and Pharisies in a like case. Obiect. Papists doe grant that if parents be in such necessi∣tie, Conditio est, vt parentes non sint in tali ne∣cessitate, vt sine siliorum auxilio viuere non pos∣sint. Tunc enim tenentur ex prae∣cepto Dei paren∣tibus adesse. Bellarm. loc. cit. as they cannot liue without their childrens helpe, their children may not by entring into any religious order forsake their parents. For they are bound by the law of God to suc∣cour their parents. Answ. 1. This caution hath beene extorted from them by euidence of argument taken from Gods word, and pressed by their aduersaries. 2. It toucheth not the principall argument taken from Gods precept, which they make of none effect by this their tradition. 3. Though parents be not at that present, when children first enter into their religious order, in such extreme need, yet they may be afterwards. But after that children are once en∣tred, they hold it vtterly vnlawfull that children for any ne∣cessitie of the parent, should attend vpon them for their succour. Obiect. Children being entred into religious orders may Eos iuvant quo∣modo religiosos decet, nimirum precibus apud Deum. Bellarm. ibid. helpe them, as becommeth religious persons, by their praiers to God. Answ. 1. This is iumpe the Pharisies Corban, whereof Christ maketh mention, Mar. 7. 11. and whereby he notably discouereth the hypocrisie of the Pharisies, who made pre∣tence of religion, an hinderance to that obedience which God required of children. 2. To pray for that which a man indeuoureth not to doe, when he may doe it, is a plaine mocking of God. The arguments which they alledge for confirmation of their erroneous opinion, are taken from extraordinary examples, or from mysticall resemblances, as 1. Abrahams leauing his fathers house. Gen. 12. 1. Deut. 33. 9. 2. Leuies speech of his father and mother, who said, I haue not seene him. 3. The aduice giuen to the royall Queene, Forget thy fa∣thers Psal. 45. 10. house.
4. The triall of our loue of Christ by louing him more Mat. 10. 37. then father or mother. 5. Christs forbidding one that followed him to goe and Luk. 9. 60. burie his father. Answ. 1. For Abrahams example, 1. it cannot be proued that he left his fathers house without the consent of his father. 2. He was then maried, and so of another house. 3. He had Gen. 12. 1. an expresse particular charge of God to leaue his fathers house, euen as he had to sacrifice his sonne. Except the like charge can be shewed, his example maketh nothing to the pur∣pose. 2. For Leuies speech, 1. It was noted by Moses in relation Exo. 32. 26, &c. to a particular zealous fact of the Leuites in executing the ven∣geance of the Lord, and so to be reckoned among such extra∣ordinary things as are not exemplary. 2. That which moued the Leuites to make no difference betwixt their parents and others, was the Lords cause: their parents and kindred as well as others had notoriously sinned against God, and in that re∣spect the Leuites took no notice of them. But they are not such parents which Papists teach children to forsake, but any pa∣rents. Now what consequence is this; Some children haue been Gods Ministers in executing iust punishment on their wicked parents, therefore children may enter into such places as shall exempt them from helping any parents, though well deser∣uing? 3. The Leuites had an expresse charge for that which they did: but that which Papists inferre from their Exo. 32. 27. example doth make the commandement of God of none effect. Mat. 15. 6. 3. For the Psal. 45. 10. aduice to the Queene, 1. It is mystically to be taken. 2. If it should be literally taken, it is to be taken as giuen to her after mariage, when she was out of her parents gouernment. 3. It hath relation to the Gen. 2. 24. law of mariage, nd implieth not a simple forsaking of parents, but a prefer∣ring of a husband before them. 4. For the louing of father and mother more then Christ, . It doth not necessarily imply a forsaking of our parents: or we may loue Christ more then them, and yet performe uty to them. 2. If they be forsaken, it must be in opposition
to Christ, that either Christ or they must be forsaken, in that if we cleaue to them they will draw vs from Christ. 5. For Christs forbidding one that followed him to goe and burie his father: 1. It was because of an extraordinary calling which he had. 2. It is set downe as a patterne to Mini∣sters, to shew that they should especially attend vpon their pro∣per function, and leaue other secular matters to be performed by such as can performe them well enough. To apply it to childrens forsaking of parents, is to peruert the sense of it. Thus we see to how little purpose the forenamed argu∣ments are alledged to proue that erronious opinion of chil∣drens entring into religious orders without their parents con∣sent. I might further shew how irreligious their pretended re∣ligious orders be, and so shew how vnlawfull it is to enter in∣to them, euen with consent of parents: but that maketh no∣thing to the point in hand. §. 15. Of the vnlawfulnesse of childrens trauelling, and bin∣ding themselues prentises without consent of parents. Contrary also to the forenamed part of childrens obedi∣ence, is the practise of such children as trauell, and seeke their fortunes (as they speake) without consent of parents, like the Prodigall childe, if not worse: for it is likely that he forced Luk. 15. 12, &c. from his father a generall consent, in that he obtained of him his portion of goods. These vsually bring great griefe to their parents, and many times make them feare more then is cause, as old Iaakob feared, when he knew not what was become of Gen. 37. 35. his sonne. Among those aberrations may be reckoned a custome in this land more vsuall then lawfull, for children to binde them∣selues prentises without consent of parents: to which fault they who take indentures of such children, or otherwise co∣uenant with them without knowledge of their parents con∣sent, make themselues accessary. Arguments to proue that children may not marie without pa∣rents consent. §. 16. Of parents consent to the mariage of their children. II. That children ought to haue their parents consent vnto their mariage is without all question euident. For 1. God himselfe hath giuen vs herein a patterne: He first
brought the woman to the man (Gen. 2. 22.) whereby he would shew that he who gaue a being to the woman, had a right to dispose her in mariage: which right parents now haue: for from them vnder God, children receiue their being. In this case parents stand in Gods roome, and are as it were Gods hand to ioyne their children in mariage. 2. God hath giuen expresse lawes concerning this point. To omit that generall morall law, Honour thy father and thy mother (which, as it is the ground of all other duties apper∣taining to children, so of this also) the authoritie and charge which God by his law (Deut. 7. 3) hath laid vpon parents, to giue their daughters to husbands, and to take wiues for their sonnes, hath the force of a law to binde children from taking wiues or husbands, without or against their parents consent. This law was not proper to the Iewes only; but as a branch of the morall law it is pressed vpon Christians, 1 Cor. 7. 36. 37. To this may be added the iudiciall law (if it be to be ac∣counted meerely iudiciall) of a parents power in giuing his daughter, or refusing to giue her in mariage to him that had defloured her, Exo. 22. 17. 3. Answerable to the law hath beene the practise of Gods Saints recorded and approued in Scripture. Isaak married the wife which his father prouided (Gen. 24. 67.) Iaakob both obeyed his father in going to Labans house for a wife (Gen. 28. 2.) and also when he came to Laban asked his daughter of him (Gen. 29. 18. &c.) Though Sampson saw a daughter of the Philistims which Non est virgi∣nalis pudoris eligere mari∣tum: electionem mariti parenti∣bus deferat. Ambr. de Patr. l. 1. c. 9. pleased him well, yet would he not marry her before he had his parents consent, Iudg. 14. 2. 4. These words of Thamar (2 Sam. 13. 13.) Speake vnto the King (who was her father,) for he will not with-hold thee from me, shew that children were not wont to be married with∣out consent of parents: Which is further confirmed by this oath of the Israelites, There shall not any of vs giue his daughter Legitimum non est coniugium nisi vxor peta∣tur a parenti∣bus.

Many Diuines of good note and name haue iudged such marriages as haue beene made simply without, or direct∣ly against parents consent (especially if parents haue iust cause of exception against those mariages) to be of no force till the parent be brought to ratifie them: and in many Churches vpon due examination of the matter, they vse to account them as no mariages.

Iustin. Instit. l. 1. tit. 10. Digest. l. 23. tit. 2 and made indissoluble, though they haue beene made simply without or directly against parents consent. Many children thinke, though it be vnlawfully done, yet being done it shall stand. Whereupon if they doubt of their parents consent, they will cast how to get their mariage consummate, so as their parents may not know of it to hinder it before it is done: and after it is done, impudently resolue to beare out as well as they
can, the storme of their parents displeasure. To preuent such contempt of the power of parents, and to establish that autho∣rity which God hath giuen them ouer their children, mariages without or against parents consent as aforesaid, are in many Churches made voide. §. 17. Of the equity of the point, and reasons why children should haue their parents consent vnto their mar∣riage. 1. By mariage children are put from their parents: for The reasons alleadged §. Gen. 2. 24. Man must leaue his Father and Mother, and cleaue vnto his wife. Is it not then great reason that they from whom children 12. may be ap∣plied to this particular. had their being, and by whom they haue beene maintained and trained vp till the time of their mariage, should haue no∣tice of that kind of leauing them, and consent thereto? 2. A parents power by the marriage of his childe is passed ouer to the husband or wife of the childe. And shall such a po∣wer be taken away without consent of parent? 3. Children for the most part being heady and rash for want of experience; and seeking more to satisfie their present car∣nall desire, then to prouide a good lasting helpe for them∣selues: but parents by the instinct of nature louing their chil∣dren as well as children loue themselues, and hauing by much experience better vnderstanding of a meete helpe, and better able to vse their discerning gift in this case, because it is not their owne case, and yet the case of one whom they loue as themselues, and to whom they wish as much good as to them∣selues; is it not meete euen for the childs good, that in a matter of such moment as mariage, the parent should haue a stroake? §. 18. Of a childs cariage in case a parent prouide an vnfit mate or none at all. Quest. What if parents vrge their children to marry such Whether pa∣rents may force their children to marry, or no. as they can not affect and loue: must children therein against their minde and liking yeeld obedience? Answ. If there be no iust exception against the partie com∣mended, they ought with the vttermost of their power to en∣deauour See Treat. 6. §. 54. to bring their affection to the bent of their parents will: and as an helpe thereunto, be perswaded that their pa∣rents are as carefull of their good as they themselues are, and
wiser then themselues: yea aboue all they ought to make in∣stant prayer vnto God (in whose hand mans heart is to turne it Prou. 21. 1. whither soeuer he will) that he would be pleased to alter the course of their affection, and to settle it on the party whom their parent hath chosen for them; if at least they see no iust cause to the contrary. But if notwithstanding all the meanes that they can vse, they still finde their heart altogether auerse, they may in a reuerend manner entreat their parent to forbeare to presse that match, and to thinke of some other. 2. Quest. What if the parent be negligent, and in due time prouide no fit match, may not the childe prouide one for himselfe? Answ. A parents negligence is not a sufficient pretext to make a child cast off that subiection which he oweth to his pa∣rent. Yet I deny not but that a childe knowing where a fit match is to be had, may make knowne as much to his parent (as Sampson did) and craue both his consent and help there∣unto. Iudg. 14. 2. And if his parent giue no eare to his humble suit, he may vse the mediation of his kindred or other friends. Yea if necessity require that the childe be married, and his parent adde wilfulnesse to negligence, and will not be moued at all, neither by the humble suit of his childe, nor by the earnest so∣licitation of any friends, meanes may be made to the Magi∣strate (who is in Gods place ouer the parent as well as ouer Qui liberos in∣iuria prohibue∣rint ducere vx eres vel nubere, per praesides co∣gantur in ma∣trimonium col∣locare Di est. lib. 23. tit. 2. § 19. the childe, and ought to afford releefe vnto the childe) and what the Magistrate doth in that case is as good a warrant to the childe as if the parent had done it. The like meanes may be vsed if a parent be an Idolater, He∣reticke, or Atheist, and will not yeeld that his childe be mar∣ried to any but to one of his owne profession and dispo∣sition. §. 19. Of the sinne of Children in marrying without their pa∣rents consent. Contrary is the minde and practise of such children as ouer lightly esteeming their parents power, take matches of their owne choice: and that sometimes priuily without giuing any notice at all to their parents: and sometimes most rebelliously against their parents mind and charge: not much vnlike those
who in the old world are condemned for taking wiues of all that Gen. 6. 2. they chose (which was one branch of that wickednesse for which the world was drowned) or rather like Esau who tooke Gen. 26. 35. such wiues as proued a griefe to his parents. What blessing can be expected to fall vpon such mariages? or rather what curse may not be feared to follow them? Gods law is transgres∣sed thereby: his Image in parents despised, that which is more proper to them then any goods; or fraudulently, or vio∣lently taken from them: their soules grieued thereat: and they See more mis∣chiefes follow∣ing such mari∣ages, §. 21. oft prouoked to cast off their children, and curse their maria∣ges. Now Gods curse doth oft follow the iust curse of a parent. §. 20. Of obiections for childrens marrying without parents consent, answered. 1. Obiect. Though Iaakob married one wife according to his parents direction, yet he married other three (at least the two maides) without their consent. 1. Answ. Iaakobs example in marrying more wiues then one is not iustifiable. 2. Answ. Iaakob had a generall consent of his parents to Gen. 28. 2. take a wife of the daughters of Laban: if therefore his marying of two wiues had beene lawfull, neither this nor that daughter had beene taken without all consent of his parents. As for the two maids of whom he had children, neither of them was his wife: for long after they had children they are called his maids, Gen. 32. 22. and distinguished from his wiues. 2. Obiect. Seruants may mary without their masters con∣sent: why then not children without their parents? 1. Answ. See Treat. 8. §. 17. It is not lawfull for seruants so to doe while the ate of their couenant lasteth. 2. Answ. Though the seruitude of a seruant be greater hen of a childe, yet a parent hath in many respects a greater ower ouer his childe, then a master ouer his seruant. The ower which a master hath is by a mutuall couenant betwixt him and his seruant, and by the voluntary subiection of a ser∣ant vnto his master. But the power of a parent is by the bond of nature, in that a childe hath his being from his parents. Be∣ides, this subiection of a childe to his parents in case of mar∣riage,
is not for seruitude but See the third reason in §. 17. for the good of the childe. 3. Obiect. Children marry for themselues and not for their parents, why then should parents consent be so much stood vpon? 1. Answ. Though they marie not for their parents, yet they marie See the se∣cond reason in §. 17. Psal. 127. 3. from their parents: by mariage they are freed from the power of their parents. 2. Answ. Children are not their owne: they are the inhe∣ritance of the Lord: the Lord hath giuen them to parents as an inheritance: a childe therefore may no more marry for him∣selfe without consent of parents, then alienate his parents goods for himselfe. §. 21. Of stealing children from parents for mariage sake. To the §. 19. forenamed sinne, and to the vengeance thereof, doe they make themselues accessary, who fraudulently allure, or violently take away children to marry them otherwise then their parents would. This is a worse kinde of felony then stea∣ling away the goods of a man. For children are much more properly a mans owne, then his goods: and dearer to him then any goods can be: yea and so much more highly to be e∣steemed, by how much reasonable creatures are to be prefer∣red before senselesse, and sensuall things. Our Anno 4. & 5. Phil. & Mar. stat. 8. statute law expresly condemneth this, and imposeth a seuere punish∣ment on such as shall offend therein. And iustly doe such offenders deserue to be seuerely punished, both in regard of the heinousnesse of the sinne, and also in regard of the ma∣ny Mischiefes a∣rising from marriages without pa∣rents consent. mischiefes which follow thereon, as, Alienation of parents affection from their children, Disinheriting heires, Enmity betwixt the friends of each party so married, Litigious suits in law, Ruine of families, and (if the personages, whose children are married without their parents consent, be great and noble) Disturbance of whole townes, cities, and nations. Instance the destruction of the Shechemites Gen. 34. Causa mali tanti coniux. Virg. Aeneid. 6. Qui rapta lon∣gum cum coniu∣ge bellum At∣tulit in patri∣am. Ouid. Met. l. 12. lege. Hor. Carm. l. 1. Od. 15. This is said to haue beene the cause of the tenne yeares warre betwixt the Grecians and Troianes, and of the ruine of Troy. §. 22. Of ministers sinne in marying children without parents consent. Such ministers also as through Carelesnesse, not taking due
account of the parties whom they marie, whether they haue their parents consent or no; or through bribery, being hired by reward, doe marie such children as they know haue not their parents consent; doe in an high degree make themselues ac∣cessary to the §. 19. forenamed sinne. Their fact is as bad as the fact of the principals themselues. Their solemnization of such mariages emboldneth both the parties that are so ma∣ried, and also all the persons that are present thereat. They highly dishonour Gods holy ordinance, in that bearing the person of God they say of such as God hath forbidden to be so ioyned together, Those whom God hath ioyned together let no man put asunder. If ministers had not their hand in such vn∣lawfull mariages, they could not be made: for our Church ra∣tifieth no mariage but what is made by a minister. Where∣fore some minister or other is guilty of this foule sinne, when∣soeuer any childe is maried without consent of parents. Well therefore doth our Church (to preuent this sinne) expresly forbid ministers to marie any without parents consent: and inflict a seuere censure on them that shall offend therein. §. 23. Of childrens forbearing to dispose any of their parents goods without consent. A third branch of the subiection of children in forbearing to doe any thing without their parents consent, is about their parents goods. That children though liuing in their parents house, ought not without their parents consent to dispose their goods, is euident by the extent of their obedience, in all things. In that Isaak was pleased to send Iaakob to Padan Aram with∣out any great prouision, it seemeth that Iaakob made consci∣ence of taking any thing priuily, but went as his father sent him Gen. 32. 10. with his staffe. And the Gen. 31. 36. apology which he made to Laban his father in law concerning things taken away, shew∣eth that he held it vnlawfull for children priuily to conuey way their parents goods. What is my trespasse? what is my sinne? (saith he) what hast thou found of all my houshold-stuffe? Doth he not hereby imply, that if Labans daughters had aken away any of their fathers goods, it had beene a trespasse nd sinne?
The Apostle saith of the heire (who of all the children may Reasons. 1. Children vnder parents are as ser∣uants. seeme to haue the greatest right) that as long as he is a childe (that is, vnder the gouernment of his parents) he diffe∣reth nothing from a seruant, though he be Lord of all. If he dif∣fer not from a seruant, what right can he haue at his plea∣sure Gal. 4. 1. to dispose his parents goods? Hath a seruant any such right? It is very requisite that children herein should be tied to their parents consent, both for the good of parents, and of chil∣dren themselues. Of parents, that they may know what they haue, or haue 2. Good of parents. not, and accordingly order their expences. How can parents tell what they haue, if children priuily without their know∣ledge purloin and dispose their goods? Of children, that their lauish humor might by this meanes 3. Good of children. be restrained: (for youth is much prone beyond moderation to spend, if it haue wherewithall) and that their parents may the better lay vp for them. 2 Cor. 12. 14. §. 24. Of the sinne of children in purloining and wasting their parents goods. Contrary is both the opinion and practise of many It is a sinne for children. children. For opinion, many thinke and say, that whatsoeuer is their 1. To mutter at their pa∣rents allow∣ance. parents, is theirs also: and thereupon being through the watchfull eie and prouident care of their parents restrained from ouerlauish spending, or from laying out any thing with their owne hands, they murmure against that restraint. Knowledge and perswasion of their subiection in this case, would be a good meanes to suppresse that repining humour. For practise, 2. Priuily to purloine their parents goods. Gen. 31. 19. Who coun∣sell children to conuey away parents goods are ac∣cessary to theft. 1. Some priuily take away and purloine what goods, mo∣ney, wares or any thing else they can come by of their parents. This the holy Ghost accounteth plaine theft: for Rachel ha∣uing priuily taken away her fathers idolls, the Scripture saith that she stole them. Hereunto doe they make themselues accessary, who coun∣sell and incourage children so to doe: as many busibodies, and deceitfull persons aduise daughters, when God hath taken
away their mothers, to take away linnen, and other-like hous∣hold-stuffe from their father, pretending that their father may marie another wife, who will carrie all away: And vpon like pretence also perswade sons when their fathers die, to con∣uey away what they can from their mother. But such preten∣ces are no sufficient warrant vnto children to deceiue their pa∣rents. It were better for children to be depriued of their pa∣rents goods, then to enioy them with such deceit: for they will be like that bread which is sweet to a man, and afterward his Pro. 20. 17. mouth is filled with grauell. 2. Others riotously spend their portion, like the prodigall 3. Wastfully to spend. Luk. 15. 13. childe, and runne into debt, and so make their parents either to pay it, or to leaue them to the law. Many Schollers at the Vniuersities, Gentlemen at Innes of Court, and such children as are somewhat liberally trained vp in their parents, or other friends houses, doe much offend herein. Little doth this ex∣cesse and riot differ from the forenamed kinde of theft: and ordinarily it bringeth as many mischiefes as that doth. 3. Some also be so vngracious and vngratefull, that being 4. To defeat their parents of their goods cunningly. come to yeeres, and their parents growne old, seeke to de∣feat their parents of all they haue, and to bring their parents vnder them, to be ordered by them: labouring to get posses∣sion of all before their parents be dead, or before they be wil∣ling to resigne any such right vnto their children. Such were 2 Sam. 15. 10. &c. Absolom, and Adoniah. How highly displeasing such practi∣ses are to God, the vengeance which fell vpon the pates of 1 King. 1. 5. &c. those two Brethren in euill, traiterous, and disloyall children, doth shew. All such children as seeke after the forenamed, or any other like meanes to defraud their parents, doe very ill repay their parents care ouer them, and more like Barbarians, then Chri∣stians, recompence euill for good: they oft bring pouerty and ignominy vpon their parents and themselues: they are worse then other theeues, because they are more deerely accounted of, and more freely trusted: yea they are a very bad example to seruants in the house, or subiects in the commonwealth.
§. 25. Of childrens contentednesse to be apparelled after their parents minde and liking. IIII. A fourth branch of the foresaid subiection of chil∣dren is about their apparell, that it be no other, then may stand with their parents good liking. It is noted that Israel Gen. 37. 3. made Ioseph a coat, doth not the particular mentioning of that circumstance shew, that parents must haue the ordering of their childrens apparell? Which is also intimated in the reason giuen of Tamars garment of diuers colours, namely because 2 Sam. 13. 18. with such garments were the kings daughters, that were virgins, apparelled. And whereas Rebekah had the keeping of her Gen. 27. 15. sonne Esaus clothes, it appeareth that his clothes were to the minde of his parents: else he would haue hid them from them: for further confirmation whereof it is noted that his apparell was pleasing to his father. Contrary is the vaine-glorious humour of many children, Childrens sin in apparelling themselues to the griefe, and disgrace of their parents. who to the griefe and discredit of their parents, apparell them∣selues both against the minde, and also aboue the ability, and vnbeseeming the place and calling of their parents. Among others, many ministers children bring much discredit on their parents hereby. Let all such proud Youths note how the Lord hath threatned to visit euen Kings children that are clo∣thed Zeph. 1. 8. with strange apparell. §. 26. Of childrens forbearing to binde themselues to doe any thing against their parents consent. V. The fift and last branch wherewith I will exemplifie the forenamed subiection of children, shall be that which is expresly noted in the law, namely a childes binding of it selfe by a vow. The law giueth the parent power to disanull his childes Num. 30. 4. vow. It is therefore a childes dutie to abstaine from vowing without his parents consent. Contrary are such vowes as Papists allure children to make, Vnlawfull vowes of chil∣dren. namely, vowes of continencie, perpetuall virginitie, regular obedi∣ence, voluntarie pouertie, with the like. Though by these they be not drawne to forsake their parents (which §. 14. before we proued to be vtterly vnlawfull:) and though these in their nature were lawfull (which they are not, because
they are against Gods law and ordinance, and against Christi∣an libertie, and sauour too rankly of Iudaisme, yea of a worse superstition,) yet without parents consent might they not be made. As vnlawfull are oaths, and other like meanes, whereby chil∣dren binde themselues to the performance of such indifferent things, as their parents are not willing they should doe. What doth this but bring a snare vpon the consciences of children, and cause a necessitie of breaking one of Gods commandements? ei∣ther the third, in breaking their vow or oath; or the fift, in diso∣beying their parents. §. 27. Of childrens actiue obedience. The affirmatiue and actiue part of a childs obedience, consists in yeelding himselfe pliable to his parents will; which must be added to the forenamed negatiue and passiue part of obedience in forbearing to doe things without consent of parents, for manife∣station of a true child-like affection and disposition toward the parent. Passiue obedience may arise from meere fullennesse, and stoutnesse of stomach. For there are many who will forbeare to doe this or that without consent of parents, because they are loth to aske their consent: they had rather haue their owne wills crost in the things they desire, then be made subiect to their parents will. What doth this argue, but a stout stomach, and a disdainfull heart? Besides, to forbeare the doing of an vnlawfull thing, is but to abstaine from euill. But it is required of Christians Psal. 34. 14. to doe that which is good, as well as to abstaine from that which is euill. This is it which is commended in Iaakob: he did not only forbeare to take such a wife as would be a griefe to his parents (wherein his Gen. 26. 34, 35. brother Esau had offended) but also obeyed his parents in Gen. 28. 2. & 29. 18. ta∣king such a wife as they willed him to take. This generall point we will exemplifie in foure particular in∣stances, namely, in a childs obedience to his parents commande∣ments, instructions, reproofes, corrections. §. 28. Of childrens obedience to their parents commandements. I. What lawfull commandements soeuer parents giue to their children, they must be ready to the vttermost of their power to obey. Ephes. 6. 1. Obey your parents, saith the Apostle to children.
Parents, by vertue of their place, haue power and authoritie to command: Children therefore must obey, or else that power is to no purpose. To demonstrate this by some particulars: 1. If a parent call his childe, or send for him, he must readily A childe must come at the parents call. come, yea though he know not the occasion. Eli was in place of a parent to Samuel, whereupon the childe supposing that Eli called him, 1 Sam. 3. 5, &c. ranne to him once, and againe and againe. & 16. 12. Dauid when he was sent for by his father out of the field to be anointed King, knew not the occasion, yet came. Gen. 49. 1. The twelue sonnes of Iaakob, though men growne, yet called for by their father, assem∣bled themselues together before him. 2. If a parent be disposed to send his childe any whither, or of A childe must goe at his pa∣rents word. any errand, though it be farre off, and may seeme somewhat troublesome, yet he ought to goe, and doe it. The §. 27. forenamed example of Gen. 28. 5. Iaakob, the example also of & 37. 14. Ioseph (being sent to see whether it were well with his brethren) and of the & 42. 2, 3. tenne sonnes of Iaakob (being sent by their father into Egypt,) and of 1 Sam. 17. 17, Dauid (sent to visit his brethren in the hoste) are in this case commended by the holy Ghost. Of Dauid it is noted, that 20. he arose vp early and went as Ishai had commanded him: which set∣teth forth his ready obedience. 3. If a parent require his childe to attend vpon him, he must A childe at command must attend vpon the pa∣rent. also doe that. When Abram was going vp to the top of Moriah his will was that his seruants should tarrie behinde, and that his sonne Isaak should attend him, and carry the wood for the sacri∣fice, and accordingly Isaak obeyed. Gen. 22. 6. 4. If a parent inioyne any taske, or commit any businesse to A child must do the message his parent will haue him doe. his childe, he ought faithfully to performe it. This kinde of faith∣full obedience is commended in Gen. 50. 5. Ioseph, in the Ier. 35. 8. Rechabites, and in 1 Sam. 17. 20. Dauid, with many others. Ioseph, by reason of his great place, might not goe out of Egypt, yet to performe that which his father inioyned him, he asked leaue. The Rechabites were tempted to breake their fathers charge, yet they would not. Dauid when he was sent by his father, from the sheepe which were com∣mitted to his custodie, was carefull to leaue them with a keeper: 1 Sam. 17. 20. and againe, when a Beare at one time, and a Lion at another came vers. 34. to the flocke, he put his life in hazard to preserue the flocke: all
these circumstances are thus noted, to set forth the great care that these children had to discharge that charge which their parents had committed to them. §. 29. Of childrens disobedience to their parents commandements. Contrary is a rebellious disposition in children, manifested by these and such like practises, 1. By refusing to be at their parents call; or comming (as we speake) at leisure, and making their parents wait for them. 2. By a lazie, sluggish pretending of vaine and friuolous ex∣cuses, when their parents would send them of an errand, like that sluggard, who saith, Prou. 22. 13. A lion is without, I shall be slaine in the streets. Such pretences are as & 10. 26. vineger to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes. 3. By scorning to wait on their parents; and in that respect they will slinke out of doores, and absent themselues, when they imagine their parents will vse their seruice in that kinde: they forsooth will not be their parents seruants: and impious conceit. 4. By refusing to doe what their parents inioyne them to doe, and require at their hands, like Matt. 21. 30. the younger sonne, that went not to worke in the vineyard at his fathers command. Such children for the most part offend herein, as through pride thinke the busi∣nesse inioyned to them too meane, and base to doe. Had Dauid, or the daughters of Reguel beene of this minde, the one would 1 Sam. 16. 13, 21. & 17. 15. not haue returned to his fathers sheepe, after he was anointed to be King ouer Israel, and after he had beene called to the Court; and the other would not haue watered their fathers sheepe, espe∣cially Exo. 2. 16, 17. among such rude and biosterous clownes, as without all re∣spect to their place and sex, would driue them away. §. 30. Of childrens obedience to their parents instruction. II. Such wholsome instructions as parents giue their children for the well ordering of their cariage, children ought conscionably o obey: a point which Pro. 1. 8. 9. & 4. 1. Solomon much presseth: My sonne, saith he, heare the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy another, &c. And to moue children the rather to doe so, he sets before them Pro. 4. 3. his owne example, shewing that he required no more of them then himselfe had performed. Exo. 18. 24. Moses, though growne to yeeres, and a prince among his people, testified his o∣bedience to his father in law hereby.
1. Parents haue an expresse commandement to instruct their Reasons. 1. Parents ought to instruct. children (as we shall Treat. 6. after shew.) Great reason therefore that their children heare and obey them therein. The good instructions of any one are to be regarded, much more of parents. 2. Great wisdome may be attained thereby: for the desire that §. 26, &c. parents haue of their childrens good, maketh them giue the best 2. Children get much wis∣dome thereby. directions they can vnto them, euen what themselues haue lear∣ned of others, or obserued by their owne experience: in this re∣spect, Solomon stileth him Prou. 13. 1. a wise sonne that obeyeth the instru∣ction of his father: and resembleth the fruit and benefit thereof, to Prou. 1. 9. & 4. 9. acomely ornament, to chaines, and bracelets, and to a crowne of glory. 3. Much ioy and comfort is brought to parents by seeing 3. Much ioy is brought to pa∣rents. their children obserue their instruction: for Prou. 10. 1. a wise sonne maketh aglad father. Now this is a thing which children ought to aime at, Prou. 27. 11. to reioyce their parents heart. Esau is taxed for Gen. 26. 35. grieuing his parents. Contrary is their proud and foolish humour, who thinke they need no instruction, their parents are too iealous of them, they are wise enough of themselues; if their parents would but let them alone, they should doe better: thus they shew themselues impi∣ous against God, rebellious against their parents, and iniurious to themselues. Such were 1 Sam. 2. 25. Elies, and Gen. 19. 14. Lots sonnes. Now note the vengeance that fell vpon them. §. 31. Of childrens patience to their parents reproofe. III. The obedience of children must further Treat. 3. §. 47, &c. The reasons alledged, and the di∣rections giuen concerning a wiues sub∣iection to her husbands reproofe, may fitly be applied to this part of chil∣drens obedience. Here therefore the same order is obserued, and the seue∣rall points confirmed by proofes per∣tinent to children. extend it self to their pa∣rents reproofe: and that by patient bearing all manner of reproofes, and by amending what is iustly reproued. That shame, whereof the Lord speaketh, which should be in a childe, Num. 12. 14. when her father hath spet in her face, that is, by some outward signe manifested his anger, implieth a childs patient bearing of a parents reproofe. This patience in a childe must be manifested
to his parent, whether his reproofe be milde or bitter, iust or vn∣iust. In this respect a childe must more consider the person who reproueth, then the matter or manner of the reproofe. Iaakobs reproofe of Ioseph, for his dreames which came of God, was vniust: Gen. 37. 10. the manner of vttering it, with many short pauses, and that inter∣rogatiuely, implieth some tartnesse: yet such was his patience, as we read not of one discontented word that he gaue. But most me∣morable is the patience of Ionathan in this kinde. His father Sauls 1 Sam. 20. 30, &c. reproofe of him was directly vniust, and out of measure bitter: yet with what patience did he beare it? all that he replied was to make some little apologie for Dauid: he replied nothing against his fathers opprobrious speeches. Great wisdome may be learned by this patience: for so may a Reason. Wisdome learned. childe better iudge of his parents reproofe, whether it be iust or no. Though it be vniust, yet thereby may he obserue what is displeasing to his parents: at least he may obserue his parents infirmitie, and so know the better how to carry himselfe towards them. Contrary is the practise of such children, as vpon euery re∣proofe of their parents are ready to * answer againe. Our parents See. §. 6. are wayward, say they, who can beare them? If none else could beare them, yet should children: for parents ordinarily beare such waywardnesse, and vntowardnesse at their childrens hands, especially while they are young, as none else would or could. Quest. If a parent be mistaken in a matter, and vniustly reproue his childe, may the childe make no answer? Answ. Yes, he may, so he doe it mildly, reuerendly, and sea∣sonably: not too peremptorily crossing or thwarting his pa∣rent. Obiect. Christ tooke vp his mother very roundly for repro∣uing Luk. 2. 49. him vniustly. Answ. Christ as God-man was greater then his mother, and in that respect with authoritie blamed her for her vniust reproofe. The Virgin Marie was not ignorant thereof, and therefore was silent. §. 32. Of childrens readinesse to amend what is iustly reproued by their parents. If a childe be iustly for his fault reproued by his parents, See Treat. 3. §. 48.
both conscience toward God, and obedience to his parent, re∣quireth that he readily redresse that which is amisse. Vnlesse amendment of the thing iustly reproued be added to patient bearing of reproofe, that patience can be no better accounted of, then dissimulation, and plaine mockage. When the father Exo. 18. 17. in law of Moses told him, that what he did was not well, he forthwith amended it. But contrarily many lewd and vngracious children conti∣nue to goe on in their wicked courses, though their parents againe, and againe rebuke them for it. Iust was Elies reproofe of his children, but yet no amendment followed. Now note the inference made thereupon by the holy Ghost, They obeyed 1 Sam. 2. 25. not the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them: whereby is implied, that to despise the iust reproofe of parents is an euident signe, and forerunner of Gods heauy iudgement. Salomon calls the childe which will heare no rebuke, a Scorner, Pro. 13. 1. which noteth out a most obstinate sinner that cannot be reclai∣med, and in that respect is scorned of the Lord. Pro. 3. 34. §. 33. Of Childrens submission to their parents correction. IIII. Correction is a reall reproofe, a reproofe in the high∣est degree, euen the seuerest kinde of reproofe: so as by sub∣iection hereunto great tryall of obedience is made. By the same meanes must a childes submission to his parent in this kinde of reproofe be manifested, as in the former: namely, 1. By bearing patiently the correction which his parent shall giue him. 2. By amending readily that for which he is iustly cor∣rected. The former of these is noted by the Apostle as a ruled case, a matter not to be denied, in these words, Heb. 12. 9. We haue had fa∣thers of our flesh which corrected vs, and we gaue them reuerence. One speciall part of this reuerence is a patient suffering: there∣fore he inferres thereupon, ought we not to be in subiection? &c. The latter is set forth by Salomon vnder an effect which fol∣loweth vpon the performance thereof: for hauing aduised a parent to correct his childe, he addeth this reason, Pro. 29. 17. He shall giue thee rest, yea he shall giue delight vnto thy soule: how can
this rest, and delight be giuen, but by the childes amendment of that for which he is corrected? A parent taketh no delight in the paine, and smart of his childe, but in the fruit that fol∣loweth thereupon. As a childes transgression is Gen. 26. 35. a griefe, and vexation to the parent, so his amendment causeth rest and delight. Now this effect followeth not simply vpon correction, but vpon the good vse thereof which is made by the childe. It lyeth therefore in the childe, and so lyeth vpon him as a du∣tie, to giue this rest and delight to his parent by amending the fault for which he is corrected, as he brought griefe to him by prouoking him to vse correction. Thus shall neither parent repent the inflicting, nor the childe repent the induring of cor∣rection. That a childe may attaine to this degree of obedience, he Direction for well vsing cor∣rection. must duly consider both the Cause whereby his parent is mo∣ued to correct him, and also the End which he aimeth at there∣in. The cause is the Pro. 13. 24. loue he beareth to his childe. The end which he aimeth at, is his childes & 22. 15. good. If these motiues worke not obedience, what can? §. 34. Of refusing, or abusing correction. Contrary is disdaine on the one side, and obstinacie on the other. Disdaine, when children scorne to be corrected by their parents: and in that respect when by all the meanes they can vse, they cannot auoid it, they will mutter and murmure, fret and fume, rage and raue against their parents, and despise and hate them for it. Obstinacie, when they will be no whit bette∣red thereby, but still runne on in their leaud courses, and ra∣ther waxe the worse for being corrected. This may be coun∣ted the highest pitch of a childes rebellion: for this is the last meanes which a parent can vse to reclaime his childe from desperate courses. If this preuaileth not, the law of God re∣quireth, Deut. 21. 18. &c that a parent should giue vp his childe into the hand of the Magistrate, that he may be put to death. Hitherto of the distinct branches of childrens Obedience. The Extent thereof followeth.
§. 35. Of childrens conforming their iudgements to their parents. The extent of childrens o∣bedience is only implied in this Epistle to the Ephesians, but it is expressed (Col. 3. 20) in these words, Children obey your parents . IN ALL THINGS. A large extent, but not sim∣ply to be taken without any limitation: for the Apostle himselfe noteth a restraint in these words, Eph. 6. 1. . In the Lord. So farre forth as children transgresse not any of Gods commandements in obey∣ing their parents, they ought to obey. This is to obey in all things, in the Lord. Treat. 3. §. 63, 64, &c. The extent of childrens obe∣dience. The extent of childrens duties being the very same that was of wiues duties: and the restraint also the same, that order which was there obser∣ued shall here also be kept. Only other proofes more pertinent to childrens place, shall be brought to con∣firme those generall propo∣sitions which may be appli∣ed to any inferiours. Many generall reasons there alled∣ged for proofe of the propo∣sitions shall here be omitted. Wherefore compare this place with that. Thus we see that parents authority is very large: there is no restraint of it but Gods contrary command, whereof a childe must be assured, if he refuse to obey his parent in any thing. It is not enough for a childe to say I haue thus long, and in thus many things obeyed my parent, I hope in some things if I haue mine owne will, I may be excused. No: All things com∣prise more then many things. Wherefore Many are not enough. And though Gods will be exempted, yet is not thine owne will exempted: though thou maiest doe nothing against Gods will, yet thou oughtest to doe many things against thine owne will, if it be contrary to thy parents. Two things are to be laboured after by children for attai∣ning to this extent of obedience in all things. 1. They must labour to bring their iudgement and will to the bent of their parents: to thinke that meet and conueni∣ent for them to doe which their parents will haue them doe. Though Isaak thought it somewhat strange that he should Gen. 22. 6, 7. carry wood vp to an hill to offer sacrifice where was nothing for a burnt offering, yet it being the will of his father that he
should doe so, he thought it meet enough for him to doe so. This subiection of iudgement and will is to be yeelded in all the particular cases of obedience which were §. 13. 14. &c. before pro∣pounded, as in their calling, mariage, apparrell, allowance, &c. So as children are to thinke that kinde of calling, that particu∣lar match, that apparrell, and that allowance to be meetest for them, which their parents thinke meete. If the iudgement be perswaded of the meetnesse of a thing, Reason. and the will inwardly brought to yeeld vnto it, outward obe∣dience will more readily and cheerefully bee yeelded there∣unto. Contrary is the ouerweining conceipt which many chil∣dren Childrens o∣uer-weining conceit of their owne iudgement a∣boue their pa∣rents, causeth much mis∣chiefe. haue of their owne iudgement and will, who thinke they can better discerne what is fit and meete for themselues, then their parents. They imagine their parents to be too strict and precise, or too suspicious and iealous, or too couetous and worldly. This maketh them take what callings, what matches, what apparrell, what allowance they thinke best; whence ma∣ny mischiefes arise, which would all easily be auoided, if they would lay downe that presumptuous conceit, and labour to obserue the forenamed direction. §. 36. Of childrens yeelding to practise at their parents com∣mand, such things as in their iudgements they can∣not thinke very meet. 2. Though children cannot in their iudgements thinke that which their parents require to be the fittest and meetest, yet being pressed thereto by the peremptory command of their parents, in practise they ought to yeeld vnto it, saying to their parents as Peter to the Lord, Neuerthelesse at thy word I will doe this, Thus did Gen. 27. 6. &c. Iaakob yeeld to Rebekah: he thought by doing that which his mother bid him, he should seeme a ocker to his father, yet she vrging him, he did it. Quest. May not a childe, yeelding better reason then his parent, refuse to doe what he thinketh vnmeet, or at least for∣eare to doe what he is commanded, till he be better informed f the meetnesse thereof? Answ. With reuerence and humility he may render his
reason why he thinketh it not meete, and desire his parent not to vrge it vpon him. (This did Gen. 43. 3. Iudah one of the sonnes of Iaakob, and is not blamed for it:) and parents ought in such a case to yeeld to their children (as Vers. 11. Iaakob did.) But yet if in things indif∣ferent, parents be otherwise minded then their children, and will haue their children yeeld to them, they must yeeld. For, 1. In in different things the command of a parent is a warrant to the childe, by reason of this extent (all things:) so as the parent may sinne in commanding that, in doing where∣of the childe may not sinne. Who can cleare Rebeckah of sinne in commanding Iaakob to deceiue his father? yet I take it, that Iaakob cannot iustly be blamed for obeying. 2. Children doe thus manifest an high esteeme of their pa∣rents, and very great respect towards them: they shew how de∣sirous they are to please them, and how fearefull to offend them. When the will of parent and childe consent, there is no such triall. 3. By this meanes peace and loue is better preserued be∣twixt parent and childe: a parents anger is stopped, the effects thereof auoided, and many other mischiefes preuented, which oft fall out when inferiours refuse to yeeld to their superiours who haue authority ouer them. Contrary is their preposterous peremptorines who will doe A fault for children to be too perempto∣ry -against their parents command. nothing against their own mind & will, though their parents require it neuer so much. This phrase (Gen. 43. 5. If thou wilt not send, we will not goe downe) which Iudah vsed to his father, though in a good cause, was too peremptory for a childe. They who obstinately refuse to doe those things which are against their owne minde, must needs come short of this extent, Obey in all things. Yea they shew that what they doe is rather for their owne sakes because they like it, then for their parents sake. What obedience then may that be thought to be? Yet this is all the obedience which many children will yeeld. If they thinke not that which their parents require to be meet, nor faire, nor foule meanes shall moue them to doe it; whereby many children doe much prouoke their parents. Let such chil∣dren know, that it is euery way more safe for them at the in∣stant
command of their parent to doe that which they con∣ceiue to be vnmeet, then peremptorily to disobey their pa∣rents, which is more then vnmeet, euen vnlawfull. §. 37. Of the restraint of childrens obedience. The restraint of childrens obedience is expressed in this clause, in the Lord: which phrase affordeth a necessary limi∣tation Heb. 12. 9. . in obeying their parents, who are but parents of our flesh, men and women, subiect to erre in their commandements, and to require such sinfull things as their children may not with a good conscience performe. The limitation then which the forenamed clause (in the Lord) affordeth, is this, Children must performe no other obedience to their parents, then may stand with their obedience to God. The reasons rendred by the Apostle proue as much: This is right, this is well pleasing to Ephes. 6. 1. Col. 3. 20. the Lord. But to obey parents against the Lord is neither right nor wellpleasing to the Lord. If therefore parents command their children to doe any thing See the two paire of cau∣tions annexed to like limi∣tations of a wiues obedi∣ence, Treat. 3. §. 51. & 52. and apply them to these 1 Sam. 19. 11. &c. limitations of childrens obedience. which the Lord hath forbidden them, they ought not to doe it. On this ground did Michal well in suffering her husband Dauid to escape out of the handes of Saul her father. I iustifie not her manner of carying the mat∣ter, with vntruths, and false tales; but her refusing to yeeld to her fathers minde and will is iustifiable, and that in two re∣spects. 1. In that the difference was betwixt her husband and fa∣ther. Now Gen. 2. 24. & 3. 16. by Gods law a wife is to yeeld to her husband ra∣ther then to her father. 2. Because she knew her father sought to slay him: if then she had deliuered him into the hands of her father, she had made her selfe accessary to murder. In this latter respect Io∣athan also did well in refusing to fetch Dauid at his fathers 1 Sam. 20. 31, 32. command. Thus if a father command his childe to goe to Masse, to for∣sweare himselfe, to marry an Idolater, to steale, to lie, or to
commit any other sinne forbidden by God, the childe ought not to obey: those things cannot be done in the Lord. Againe if parents forbid their children the doing of any ne∣cessary duty commanded of God, the childe ought to doe it notwithstanding the parents inhibition. We may well thinke that Ahaz who set himselfe so violently to deface the holy things of God, to prophane his ordinances, and to shut vp the doores of Gods House, gaue strait charge to his sonne that he 2 Chr. 29. 3. &c. should not repaire them againe; yet Hezekiah so soone as he had power did repaire all. If a parent forbid his childe to goe to the Protestants Chur∣ches, to heare a Sermon, to pray in a knowne tongue, to giue iust weight, and measure, to speake the truth when he is cal∣led to witnesse it, with the like; he must be of Daniels minde, Dan. 6. 10. and notwithstanding that prohibition, doe the things which God requireth. §. 38. Of childrens sinne in yeelding to their parents against God. Contrary to this limitation is on the one side a flattering eie-seruice in many children, who care not what they doe, be 1. Eie seruice. it good or euill, lawfull or vnlawfull, so they may please their parents thereby: and on the other side a slauish fearefulnesse, 2. Feareful∣nesse. which maketh them so to dread their parents as they feare not God at all: they will rather choose to sinne and so prouoke Gods wrath, then doe any thing whereby their parents wrath may be prouoked. It is a brand set vpon euill kings that they ½ Kin. 22. 52. walked in the waies of their fathers, and mothers: and did wickedly 2 Chr. 22. 4. as they counselled them. Wherefore the following and obeying of their parents in euill was so farre from exte∣nuating their sinne, as it did rather aggrauate the same. The preferring of father and mother before the Lord Christ shew∣eth that such a childe is Matt. 10. 37. not worthy of Christ: In comparison of Christ Luke 14. 26. Father and mother must be hated. But that vndue and vnchristian-like respect of parents aboue Christ, is it that maketh so many young Papists, young swagerers, swearers, Motiues to prouoke chil∣dren to prefer God before their parents. liars, deceitfull persons, and lewd liuers. For auoiding the two forenamed extremes let thine heart be filled with a true feare of God, and withall consider the diffe∣rence
betwixt our earthly parents and our heauenly Father. They are but parents Heb. 12. 9. of our flesh, he is the Father of spirits. Luk. 12. 4, 5. They can but touch the body, he can cast body and soule in∣to hell. They are but a while ouer vs, he for euer. Their au∣thority is subordinate to his, his supreme & absolute of it selfe. They can giue but a light temporary reward; he, an eternall weight of glorie. They cannot shelter vs from his wrath, he can from theirs. Hitherto of such duties of children as respect their parents authority, such as respect their necessity follow. §. 39. Of childrens Recompence. The generall head whereunto al the duties which children owe to their parents in regard of their Necessity, is in one word Recompence, which is a dutie whereby children indea∣uour as much as in them lieth, to repay what they can for their parents kindnesse, care, and cost towards them, and that in way . Arist. Ethic. l. 8. c. 14. of thankfulnesse; which maketh a childe thinke he cannot doe too much for his parent, & well may he thinke so, for a parent doth much more for his childe before it is able to doe for it selfe, then the childe possibly can doe for the parent. So as if the parents authority were laid aside, yet the law of equity re∣quireth this dutie of Recompence: so also doth the law of piety and charity. Wherefore of all other Duties this is most due. 1 Tim. 5. 4. . It is in expresse termes giuen in charge to children by the Apostle, who willeth them to learne to requite their parents. Contrary is neglect of parents in their need, which is more It is mon∣strous ingra∣titude for children to neglect their parents. then monstrous ingratitude. As all ingratitude is odious to God and man, so this most of all, and yet very many are guilty thereof. In them the prouerbe is verified that loue is weighty. For it is the property of weighty things to fall downe apace, out to ascend slowly, and that not without some violence. Thus loue from the parent to the childe falleth downe apace, ut it hardly ascendeth from children to parents. In which respect another prouerbe saith, One father will better nourish nine children, then nine children one father. Many children in his kinde doe no more for their parents, then for strangers. They either consider not how much their parents haue done
for them; or else they conceit that what their parents did, was of meere dutie, and needeth no recompence. Fie vpon such barbarous and inhumane children! §. 40. Of infirmities whereunto parents are subiect. The rule of the forenamed recompence is on the one side A rule of re∣compence. the parents Necessity, and on the other, the childes Ability. So as in euery thing wherein a parent needeth his childes helpe, the childe to his power must afford his best helpe. Beyond ones power nothing can be expected. Ultra posse non est esse. A parents Neces∣sity may be through Naturall infirmities. Casuall extremities.   Naturall infirmities are Inward. Outward.   Inward Infirmities are weakenesse of iudgement, slipperi∣nesse of memory, violence of passion with the like; whence proceed frowardnesse, testinesse, suspiciousnesse, iealousie, feare, griefe, &c. Outward Infirmities are such as arise from some instant temp∣tation, as were Gen. 9. 21. Noahs and & 19. 33. Lots drunkennesse; & 19. 33. Lots and 2 Sam. 11. 4. Dauids vncleanesse; Gen. 12. 13. Abrahams and & 26. 7. Isaakes dissimulation; & 37. 34, 35. Iaakobs and 2 Sam. 18. 33. Dauids excessiue lamentation, &c. Some of these latter, which may seeme most heinous and odious sinnes, are then to be accounted infirmities, when they who commit them make not a sport of them, nor delight to liue and lie in them, as swine to wallow and lie in the mire: but only at some times, through some temptation, as it were vnawares, fall into them; and after they are committed they are themselues more ashamed of them, and more grieued for them, then any other that see them, or heare of them. In regard of the naturall infirmities of parents, the dutie of children is both to beare with them, and also to couer them so farre as they can. §. 41. Of childrens bearing with their parents infirmities. Children beare with their parents infirmities when they doe not the lesse reuerendly esteeme their place, or person, nor performe the lesse dutie to them because of their infirmities. This is the first particular branch of recompence. For chil∣dren in their yonger and weaker yeares are subiect to many
infirmities: if parents had the lesse respected them for their infirmities, and from thence had taken occasion to neglect them, and would not haue borne with them, surely they could not haue beene so well brought vp. That great pati∣ence, long-sufferance, and much forbearance which parents haue shewed towards their children, requireth that children in way of recompence shew the like to their parents as occa∣sion is offered. It was a great infirmity in Isaak to preferre Esau a prophane childe, before Iaakob a religious childe, espe∣cially against Gods expresse word concerning Iaakob; yet Iaakob respected not his father a whit the lesse for it, as ap∣peares by his Gen. 27. 12. feare to offend him, and by his & 28. 5. readinesse to obey him. & 37. 10. Iaakobs vniust reproofe of Ioseph was no small in∣firmity, and yet how much Ioseph reuerenced and euery way respected his father the history following sheweth. Sauls in∣firmities were farre more and much greater then any of theirs, yet what dutie and faithfulnesse did Ionathan his sonne per∣forme to him, euen to their deaths? for 1 Sam. 31. 2. he died with him. We haue herein the patterne of Christ himselfe: how great infirmity did his mother bewray, when ouer-rashly she rebu∣ked him being about a good worke, a bounden duty, his Fa∣thers businesse? yet immediatly thereupon it is noted that he went downe with his parents, and was subiect to them: which Luk. 2. 51. manifesteth the honour he gaue to his mother, notwithstand∣ing her infirmitie. Contrary to this duty doe they, who take occasion from their parents infirmities to thinke basely of their person and A childe may not dispise a parent for any infirmity. their place, and thereupon grow carelesse in duty, either re∣fusing to doe any duty at all, or else doing it carelesly, grudg∣ingly, disdainefully, and scornefully. Absolom made a suppo∣sed infirmity of his father the ground of his rebellion. Had 2 Sam. 15. 3. his pretence beene true, yet had it not beene a sufficient cause for him to disgrace, and rise against his father, as he did. The law that threatneth Gods vengeance against such children as mocke at their father, or despise to obey their mother, maketh Pro. 30. 17. no exception of parents infirmities. §. 42. Of childrens couering their parents infirmities. Children couer their parents infirmities both by passing by
them (as we speake) and taking no notice of them, and also by concealing them from others as much as they can. The Scripture noteth it to be a property of loue to couer a multi∣tude 1 Pet. 4. 8. of sinnes: now in whom should loue abound, if not in children? And who should more manifest this property of loue then children? Of passing by and concealing from others a parents infir∣mity, we haue a worthy patterne in Shem and Iaphet: when Noah their father being drunken lay vncouered in the midst of his tent, they went backward (that they might not themselues Gen. 9. 23. see their fathers infirmity) and couered his nakednesse (that others might not see it.) The blessing which vpon this occa∣sion was then promised to them and their posterity, sheweth how acceptable this dutie was to God. Contrary was Chams practise, who discouered, and made A Sinne for a childe to dis∣couer a pa∣rents infir∣mity. knowne his fathers nakednesse. The curse thereupon denoun∣ced against him, sheweth how odious that sinne was vnto God. Too many there be of Chams cursed brood, who blaze abroad their parents infirmities, and make such things knowne of them, Gen. 9. 22. Vers. 25. as otherwise would not be knowne: whereby they bring much dishonour and shame vpon their parents (which can be no ho∣nour Parent is im∣precatione nihil perniciosius excogitari po∣test. Plato de Leg. lib. 11. to the children,) and withall a curse from their parents on themselues, which the heathen accounted very dreadfull. More contrary was Absoloms practise, who raised a most ma∣licious slander of his father, and thereby alienated his subiects hearts from him. Too many Absolom-like seeke to raise a suppo∣sed More then monstrous for a childe to raise a slan∣der of a pa∣rent. reputation and honour to themselues by vilifying and disgra∣cing their parents: but let them note Absoloms end. Assuredly, if they hold on in that course, the like, or a worse, shall be their end. §. 43. Of childrens bearing with their parents casuall neces∣sities. 2 Sam. 15. 3. Casuall extremities, are all manner of crosses which by the pro∣uidence of God are laid vpon a man: whether vpon his bodie, as blindnesse, lamenesse, sicknesse, &c. or on his person, as captiuitie, banishment, imprisonment, &c. or on his estate, as pouerrie, pe∣nurie, &c. In all these, children must beare with their parents, as in the forenamed infirmities; neither lesse reuerendly esteeme of
them, nor performe the lesse dutie because of them. These are such necessities, as are not sinfull in themselues; and therefore in regard of these, parents are much more to be borne withall. Though Isaak were blinde, yet did not Iaakob a whit the lesse re∣spect Gen 27. 1. Ruth 1, 16, 21. him. Though Naomi were poore, yet Ruth her daughter in law continued to doe a childs dutie and seruice vnto her. Contrary is the vnnaturall disposition of such children, as Vnnaturall to despise a pa∣rent for any casuall infir∣mitie. take occasion from these casuall necessities of their parents to de∣spise them. God hath made an expresse law against despising those who are by any outward defects impotent, as deafe, blinde, &c. If no person may despise another, for these, much lesse chil∣dren Leu. 19. 14. their parents. They are worse then Cham that doe so, and may looke for an heauier curse. §. 44. Of childrens releeuing their parents according to their neede. Besides bearing with parents necessities, in such cases as pa∣rents stand in need of their childrens releefe and succour, they must afford it them. In sicknesse they must visit them, as Gen. 48. 1. Ioseph visited his father. In time of mourning, they must comfort them, as & 37. 35. the children of Iaakob. In want, they must prouide things needfull for them, as & 42. 8. the sonnes of Iaakob, who went vp to buy food for their father; and as & 47. 12. Ioseph, who sent for Iaakob into Egypt, and there nourished him. It is noted of Ruth 2. 18. Ruth, that shee did not only gleane for her mother a poore woman, but also re∣serued some of that food which was giuen to her selfe to eat, for her. In time of danger they must doe what they can for their protection and preseruation, as 1 Sam. 22. 3, 4. Dauid had in this respect an especiall care of his father and mother. Yea, if God be pleased to Vetustissima lex erat inscripta mentibus om∣nium, vt liberi si hoc officij gra∣uentur impen∣dere quod pulli ciconiarum re∣ponunt suis pa∣rentibus, velut impij conijcian∣tur in vincula. Erasm. Instit. Matrim. take children out of this world before their parents, and their pa∣rents be succourlesse, they must take what order they can for the well-being of their parents after their owne departure, as Iohn 19. 27. Christ, who commended his mother to his disciple Iohn a little before his death. These and such like duties are particular branches of re∣compence, and are all comprised vnder that 1 Tim. 5. 4. . requitall, which the Apostle requireth of children: And they are but a small part of requitall of all the paines, care, and charges, that parents haue been at with their children. Yea, this only thing, that parents haue brought forth children into the world, can children neuer suffici∣ently
requite. Nature hath taught thus much, not only vnto hea∣then men, but also vnto the vnreasonable creatures. Among other vnreasonable creatures, the example of the Arist. Plin. Suidas. Storke is worthy to be noted: for it is recorded of that kinde, that when the dammes are old, the young ones feed them; and when through age, they are ready to faint in their flying, the young ones will helpe; and when they are past flying, the young ones carrie them on their backs. The  Sin of Phari∣sies in freeing children from relieuing their parents. Greeke name of a Storke is taken from that word, which signifieth, to requite a parents kindnesse: or else this word is taken from that name: they are both of the same notation. Contrary is the opinion of Pharisies, who thought that children by consecrating their substance to the Temple, might be freed from this dutie of recompence to parents, which is the mysterie of that Hebrew word Mar. 7. 11. Corban. They made a meere pretext of piety to God, a cause of manifest impietie against parents. Christ giueth this verdict of them, that vers. 13. they make the word of God of none ef∣fect. See §. 14. 1. Sin of chil∣dren in deny∣ing releefe to parents. Papists are of the same opinion, and so vnder the same censure. Contrary also is their practise, who hauing the goods of this world, suffer their parents to want. 1 Ioh. 3. 17. Iniquissimum est patrē egere, cùm filius sit in facultatibus. Digest. lib. 25. tit. 3. §. 5. S. Iohn saith, that the loue of God dwelleth not in him, who shutteth vp his compassion from his brother in that case; how then can it dwell in such a childe? Not they only who suffer their parents to starue, offend in this ex∣treme, but they also who suffer them to liue poorely, and basely, when themselues Luk. 16. 19. 2. In bringing parents into extremities. Diues-like fare delicately, and goe gorgeously attired euery day. In an higher degree doe they offend, who bring their parents to such extremities, as to pouertie by their lauish spending; to pri∣son by importuning them to be their sureties; to excessiue griefe by their mischieuous practises, as Gen. 37. 34. 3. In striking parents. the sonnes of Iaakob. But what shall we say of such gracelesse children, as dare strike their parents? Exod. 21. 15. 4. In murthe∣ring parents. Gods law accounteth such a childe vnworthy of life, and adiudgeth him to death. Nay, what may be said of father-quellers, and mother-quellers? There was of old no particular law made against them, because it is, supposed, that no childe can be so vnnaturall and inhumane. In imitation whereof Solon cùm in∣terrogaretur, cur nullum supplicium con∣stituisset. in eum qui parentem necasset, respon∣dit, se id nemi∣nem facturum putasse. Cic. pro Ros. Amer. Solon, that wise law-maker among the heathen, made no law against them: and his reason being as∣ked,
he answered, that he thought no childe would commit such a fact. When afterwards such inhumane impietie was manifested in the world, the Ciuill Law ordained this punishment; Si quis paren∣tus fata propera uerit, neque gladio, neque ignibus, neque vlli alij solenni poenae subiuge∣tur, sed insutus culeo cum cane, & gallo galli∣naceo, & vipe∣ra, & simia, vel in vicinū mare, vel in amnem proijciatur, &c. Justin. Cod. l. 9. tit. 17. Cur vo∣luerint parri∣cidas insui in culeum viuos, atque ita in flumen deijci, docet Cicero pro Ros. Amer. Ad famam filij attinet, vt vide∣atur honorem debitum patri defuncto prae∣stitisse. Cic. Philip. 9. If any shall kill his parent, let him not be put to the sword, nor fire, nor any other vsuall punishment: but let him be sowed in a sacke with a dog, and a cocke, and a viper, and an ape, and cast into the next sea, or riuer; that while life is in him, he may begin to want all vse of the elements, and be depriued, while he liueth, of the aire, and when he is dead, of the earth. This sinne hauing beene committed among the heathen, the Apostle reckoneth it vp among other most notorious and barba∣rous sinnes, 1. Tim. 1. 9. As murther is one of those sinnes, which the earth can least beare, and which cryeth loudest to heauen for vengeance; so among the seuerall kinds of murther, this is the most vnsupportable, and crying. Thus much of the duties of children, which they are to performe while their parents liue. It remaineth to speake of those which they are to performe when their parents are dead. §. 45. Of childrens care to burie their parents being dead. The duties which children owe to their parents after they are dead, concerne the Bodie of their de∣ceased parēt. Credit     It is the dutie of children to bring the bodies of their parents deceased, with such decencie and honour, as may be answerable to the place and reputation wherein they liued. So as both the thing it selfe, and the manner of doing it, is to be obserued. Buriall a meanes to maintaine hope of resur∣rection. The thing it selfe, namely Buriall of the corps of such as are deceased, hath euer beene in vse in Gods Church: and it hath beene vsed as a meanes to maintaine our hope of the resurrection of our bodies. Many of the heathen, who neuer dreamt of the re∣surrection, Constituere py∣ras: huc corpora quisque surum More tulere arum, subie∣ct siue ignibus, &c. Virg. Aeneid. 11. were wont to burne the dead bodies of their friends: other heathen learned this manner of buriall from the Church, though they knew not the mysterie thereof. It is more cleare then needs be proued, that Gods people, from the beginning of the world, haue performed this dutie of buriall to their friends; but
it is not pertinent to the point in hand, to insist vpon the generall: that it belongs especially to children to procure this dutie to be performed, is now the point to be proued, which is readily done by the approued examples of Gen. 25. 9. Isaak, & 35. 29. Iaakob, & 50. 7. Ioseph, and o∣thers expresly recorded in Scripture. And great reason there is for it: for 1. It is a testimonie of great loue and good respect to the par∣tie 1. Reason. deceased. Now who should manifest more loue, and greater respect then a childe? 2. It is a kinde of 1 King. 14. 13. 2 King. 22. 20. blessing, promised by God to his Saints, to 2. Reason. be buried: as on the other side, it is a Ier. 22. 19. 1 King. 21. 23, 24. Psal 79. 3. curse threatned against ob∣stinate sinners, not to be buried. In this respect, 2 Sam. 2. 5. Dauid blesseth the men of Iabesh Gilead for burying Saul, and acknowledgeth it a kindnesse done to Saul. Now who ought rather to procure a blessing, and doe a kindnesse to parents, then children, who are oft blessed through their parents meanes? 3. It being a great deformity to haue a mans corps lie aboue 3. Reason. ground (for no carkase will be more loathsome then a mans if it lie vnburied) children, who are most bound to couer their parents deformity, are in this respect bound to burie their corps. Sinne of chil∣dren to neg∣lect their pa∣rents dead corps. Contrary is their practise whose mindes are so set on their parents goods, as they cleane neglect their bodies. So soone as their parents breath is out of their body, they so busie them∣selues about the things which they haue left behinde them, as their corps is ready to stinke before care be taken for the buriall of it. Yea, some will purposely keepe their parents corps aboue ground till they be exceeding noisome, for re∣ceiuing some reuenues, or debts, or other accounts, which must be paid before the corps be buried. If their corps must needes for sometime be kept aboue ground, let them be im∣balmed, or so vsed as they may not sauour. They who are carelesse hereof, shew that they respect their parents wealth Sinne of chil∣dren entring vpon their pa∣rents estate before they are dead. 1 King. 1. 5. more then his person and honour. In which respect they also heinously transgresse, who are so greedy of their parents estate, as they must needs preuent his departure, and like Adoniah enter vpon their fathers estate, and take possession of his goods before breath is out of his
body: whereby they doe oft cause great disquietnesse to him that would depart in peace. Againe, others bearing an inward grudge and secret hatred Sinne of chil∣dren distur∣bing their pa∣rents funerall. against a brother, or other kinsman, whom their parent intire∣ly loued, and in that respect durst not meddle with him in their parents life-time, so soone, as their parent is dead, picke a quarrell with the party hated, and so disturbe and hinder their parents funerall. Such a plot Esau intended: but God defea∣ted Gen. 27. 41. it, whereby it appeareth that God is displeased therewith. §. 46. Of the decency wherewith children ought to see their parents buried. The manner after which children ought to see their parents buried, must be with such decency as is agreeable to the com∣mendable custome of the countrie and Church where their parents die, and with such honour as is in some measure answe∣rable to the estate, and place of their parents while they liued (at least if it be not aboue the meanes that the parent hath left, or aboue the abilitie of the childe that maketh the solemnitie.) Ioseph was a great Gouernour in Egypt, by reason whereof his father when he came thither was highly accounted of: accor∣dingly Gen. 50. 7. with great honour did he carry him to his graue. There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed decency Contrary, 1. Too sump∣tuous funerals. nd honour. One is an ouerlauish and prodigall sumptuousnesse nd solemnitie at their parents funerall, farre aboue the estate, nd farre beyond the meanes which the parent hath left, and arre also aboue the estate and ability of the childe himselfe. ome by the needlesse solemnitie of their parents funerall are  farre cast into debt, as they are neuer able to recouer them∣selues againe, and so bring more dishonour to their parents by he weaknesse of their childes estate, then honour by the so∣mnitie of the funerall: there may be great honour, and much decency in a funerall, where is not extraordinary char∣es: instance Steuens funerall. Act. 8. 2. The other extreme is too base and priuate a manner of 2. Too base funeralls. urying their parents, much vnbeseeming both their parents nd their owne estate, and means; which ariseth from a mixture f pride, and couetousnesse possessing their hearts. Pride ma∣eth them haue no solemnity at all, because couerousnesse will
not suffer them to exceed in their solemnitie. Hence it com∣meth to passe that they chuse out strange places where neither their parents or selues are knowne, and the dead of the night that none may espie them; and appoint an vncertaine time, that no friend may accompany them. God oft meeteth with such proud, couetous children in their kinde, and causeth them with like dishonour to be brought to their graues. §. 47. Of childrens paying their parents debts after their death. As children must haue respect to the body of their parents Childrens re∣spect to the credit of their deceased pa∣rents. deceased, so also to their credit and name, which is a thing of greater account, and honour: a thing wherein they may bring a kinde of blessing to their parents and make them liue after their death. Parents themselues cannot doe any thing when they are dead to preserue the same: children therefore being the liuing Image of their parents must indeuour to doe it. Three things there be which children must make consci∣ence of, euen in regard of their deceased parents credit, and reputation; one, to pay their debts: another, to suppresse ill rumors: a third, to imitate their good example. I. If the estate of parents, their goods or lands come to their children, their dutie is to pay their debts, so farre as they can: especially if by law those debts may be recouered at their hands. For what law may force others to doe in equitie and Iustice, conscience must moue good children to doe in chari∣tie, and recompence to their parents. The holy Ghost makes it a Psal. 37. 21. note of a wicked man to borrow and not to pay. Wherfore to wipe away that blot from the name of a parent deceased, children must be ready in this kinde to doe what the parent himselfe, if he were liuing, would, or should doe. Yea if children of them∣selues be well able, though their parents left not sufficient to pay all their debts, they ought to pay them. Herein especially a childlike affection is manifested to the parent. Contrary is their practise who striue to get all they can of their parents, and yet make no conscience of paying any debts at all, vnlesse law force them thereto. What they doe in this case cannot be thought to be done for their parents sake, but rather
for their owne sake. Many so little respect their parents credit in this kinde, as they priuily conueigh away and vtterly con∣ceale much of their parents estate, of purpose to defeate Credi∣tors: which as it is a part of apparent iniustice, so it is a cause of opening the mouthes of men against their parents, to their discredit and shame. §. 48. Of childrens suppressing euill reports against their pa∣rents deceased. * The direction giuen before concerning childrens speech §. 7. of their parents behinde their backs, may fitly be applied also to the care which children ought to haue of the speeches and reports which are made of their parents after their departure. It followeth as from the lesse to the greater, that what children doe for their parents credit in absence behinde their backes, they must much more doe when they are dead: for then there is no hope, no possibilitie that parents should doe any thing to right their owne wrong in that kinde: it lyeth therefore vpon children to doe it. Doe not they cleane contrary, who take occasion from the departure of their parents, both to open their eares to receiue any ill reports of them, and also to open their mouthes to speake ill of them: then blazing abroad all their infirmities, and stretching their ill reports of their parents beyond the lists of truth. Ill birds they are that so bewray their owne neast. They know that their parents being dead can haue no notice thereof: whereby they shew what little piety to God or pa∣rent is in their heart. But there is an euer-liuing, all-seeing, and all-knowing Father that taketh notice of all: who beside other engeance will cause such measure to be meated out to them, s they mete to their parents. There is no one thing wherein this prouerb, (With what measure you mete it shall be measured Mat. 7. 2. o you againe) is more often verified then in childrens ingra∣itude Quaecun{que} pa∣rentibus stipen∣dia intuleris, eadem ipse a fi∣liis expecta. Thal. Miles. apud Dig. Laert. l. 1. to their parents. All ages haue giuen many instances thereof. (The very heathen obserued it.) Which sheweth Gods great indignation against it. §. 49. Of childrens imitating their parents good example. If parents haue beene persons of good carriage in their life
time, as religious towards God, iust in their dealings with men, mercifull to such as stood in need of their helpe, doing much good in their place, and so ended their daies with much credit; it is an especiall meanes to maintaine and continue this their credit, for children to walke in their steps, and to indeuour to be like them. Thus is a blessed memorie of their parents kept fresh and greene (as we speake) though their bodies be rotten. For when they who knew the parents behold the like good quali∣ties and actions in their children, they will thereby be put in minde of the parties deceased, and say, Oh how such parents yet liue! behold a liuely, and liuing Image of them. Thus did Salomon, Asa, Iehosaphat, Hezekiah, Iosiah and such like good Kings which came of the stocke and linage of Dauid, keepe the memory of their father Dauid, fresh, faire, and flou∣rishing (long after his body was rotten) as is euident by these and such like phrases, He walked in the ordinances of Dauid his 1 King. 3. 3. father: he walked in all the waies of Dauid his father: he did 2 King. 22. 2. that which was right as Dauid his father, &c. There can be no 1 King. 15. 11. better monument of a parents pietie, honestie, and vertue, then a childes liuely representation of the same. Wherefore Nullum monu∣mentum clarius relinquere potu∣it, quàm effigi∣em morum suo∣rum, virtutis, constantiae, pie∣tatis filium. Cic. Philip. 9. as a motiue to stirre vp children to walke in the good waies of their parents, God hath promised to shew mercy to thousands of them that loue him and keepe his commandements, that is, such as hauing religious and righteous parents walke in their steps. Contrary are both those that are vnlike good parents, and those that are like euill parents. The former sort doe much impeach and dishonour the reputation of their parents, as Re∣hoboam, who by his foolish rigorous and vniust carriage, made the people speake contemptuously of Dauid. 1 King. 12. 16. The latter sort continue in memorie the euill name, and the shame of their parents, and cause them to stinke more and more: as the sonnes and successors of Ieroboam, who follow∣ing his idolatrous course, made it the more remembred, and caused this blur to remaine in his stile from age to age, Ierobo∣am which made Israel to sinne. 1 King. 15. 26. As they stop the current, and hinder the passage of the bles∣sing
of righteous parents: so these propagate, and open a way for the curse of vnrighteous parents. §. 50. Of the superstitious dutie enioyned by Papists to chil∣dren after their parents decease. To the two forenamed duties of burying the corps, and pre∣seruing the credit of parents, Papists adde a third, and Heathen a fourth, whereof neither are warrantable by Gods word, but directly contrary thereto. That which Papists adde is, that children after their parents Bellar. Tom. 2. Contr. 3. De Purgator. l. 2. c. 16. &c. death ought to procure Diriges, Masses, Pardons, Releases, and such like toies for them, and make continuall prayers to free them out of Purgatory, and bring them to rest in heauen: of the vanity of these prayers, and folly of the other toies I haue In whole ar∣mour of God Treat. 3. §. 39. 40. in Ephes. 6. 18. elsewhere spoken. The Scripture expresly teacheth that after death the soule goeth to the place appointed for it, of endlesse blisse or woe: so as there is no meanes of altering the one, or helping forward the other. §. 51. Of the vnlawfulnesse of childrens seeking to reuenge their parents wrongs. That which Heathen adde, is, that children after their pa∣rents Seneca in Aga∣mē. Poetae tra∣diderunt filios patris vlciscen∣di causa suppli∣cium de matre sumpsisse, id{que} deorum iussis, at{que} oraculis fe∣cisse. Cic. pro. Sex. Ros. death reuenge such wrongs as haue beene done to them in their life time. And they presse this so farre vpon children, as they affright them with their parents Ghost, saying, that if they neglect to reuenge their parents wrongs, their Ghost will follow them, and not suffer them to liue in quiet, but molest them continually. This conceipt ariseth from the corruption of nature, which is exceeding prone to reuenge: but it is ex∣presly forbidden in Scripture, in these and such prohibitions, Resist not euill, Rom. 12. 17, Recompence to no man euill for euill. 19. Auenge not Mat. 5. 39. our selues &c. Yet some in iustification thereof alledge 1 King. 2. 5. 8. Da∣ids charge to Salomon of taking vengeance on Ioab and She∣ei, after his death. Answ. The charge which Dauid gaue, & Salomons executi∣on thereof, was no matter of priuate reuenge, but only a lawfull execution of iustice which children may and ought to doe. Iust reasons there were to moue Dauid to put off the execution of ustice vpon the one & the other so long. 2 Sam. 3. 39. Ioab was too migh∣tie
to haue execution done on him in Dauids time: and She∣meis & 19. 23. offence was committed in the time of Dauids humiliati∣on, which made him sweare that he would not himselfe take Vengeance of him. Besides, Salomon executed iustice on the one and the other, not for the wrongs they did to his father, but for other crimes which they committed in his time: onely their former offences were remembred to aggrauate the matter. Thus farrc of childrens duties. The manner of performing them followeth to be declared. §. 52. Of the manner of performing childrens duties. That clause which § 37. noted out the limitation of childrens duties, affoordeth also an excellent direction for the manner of performing them. It is this, in the Lord: that is, Children must so performe their duty to their parents as they would or should per∣forme it to the Lord. More particularly it implieth these six points: How children obey their pa∣rents in the Lord. 1. That their duties be performed in conscience, or for con∣science sake, which is all one as for the Lords sake: for the Lord onely is Iudge of the conscience and hath power ouer it. Thus 1. By obeying for the Lords sake. Rom. 13. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. Col. 3. 20. must subiects performe duty to magistrates: much more chil∣dren to parents. The reason which the Apostle rendereth in these words, This is wel-pleasing to the Lord, sheweth that chil∣dren in obeying their parents must labour to approue them∣selues to God. 2. Their duties must be in sincerity, which is when children 2 In sincerity. pretend in shew to doe no more, then in truth and heart they meane: Whatsoeuer ye doe, doe it heartily as to the Lord, saith Col. 3. 23. the Apostle. Parents vse to deale with none more heartily then with their children: accordingly must children deale with pa∣rents. 3. They must be performed cheerefully, with a willing and 3. With cheereful∣nesse. ready minde: for the Lord loueth cheerefulnesse. Herein ly∣eth a maine difference betwixt a filiall and seruile, a childe 2 Cor. 9. 7. like and slauelike obedience. 4 With reue∣tence. 4. They must be performed reuerendly as to them which beare the Image of God. Hereof we spake §. 3. before. 5. They must so be performed, as in performing them no 5. In the feare of God.
sinne be committed against God. Hereof also we spake §. 37. & 38. be∣fore. 6. Constancy must be added to all other vertues. For as the 6. With perse∣verance. Lord himselfe is constant in all his waies and workes, so he ex∣pecteth that children should be in the duties which he requi∣reth at their hands. He that beginneth well, and holdeth not on, loseth all the glory of his good beginning. If the examples of all good children commended in Scrip∣ture be well weighed, we shall finde their duties, so farre forth as they were acceptable to God, performed after the foresaid manner, in all the branches thereof. §. 53. Of the aberrations of children in the manner of their obedience. Contrary are these aberrations. 1. When children performe their duties on by-respects: Faults in the manner of doing duty. 1. By-respects. for feare of parents wrath, and the punishment following there∣on: for hope and expectation of greater portion and allow∣nce: vpon instant perswasion of friends, with the like: these respects simply in themselues are not for the Lord. 2. When they performe them only outwardly in shew, 2. Comple∣mentall. complementally while parents are in presence, or may know thereof. This is not with respect to God who seareheth the eart. 3. When they performe them grudgingly, mutteringly, 3. Rudely. disdainfully: as if their parents authority were an vsurped ower and not giuen them of God. Is this in the Lord? 4. When they performe them rudely and vnmannerly: 4. Grudging∣ly. his sheweth they consider not the glory of Gods Image shi∣ing in their parents. 5. §. 38. When they care not how they sinne against God, so 5. Onely to please man. ey may please their parents. 6. When, as if they repented of what they haue well done, 6. Vnsetledly. ey refuse to doe any more duty to their parents. They waxe eary, thinking that God hath laid too heauy a burden vpon em. Many shew themselues more dutifull in their young∣ then in their riper yeares. That which maketh children eary in doing duty, is commonly the great and long neede of eir parents, as long sicknesse, long impotency, long po∣uerty,
with the like. It appeares that such children looke only on their parents as men, which, as they imagine, can neuer re∣compence their paines and cost: they looke not to God who is able abundantly to recompence all. These therefore per∣forme not their duty in the Lord. §. 54. Of the equall respect that children are to beare to both parents. As the distinct duties of children haue beene set forth, so I thinke it requisite to declare distinctly who the parties be to whom those duties are to be performed. These principally are the naturall parents, both Father and Mother. Seconda∣rily such as are in the place of parents. The first point then to be noted is, that children beare an equall respect to both their naturall parents, and performe du∣ty to both alike. The law expresly mentioneth both, Honour thy Father and thy Mother. Well may we thinke that there was some iust and vrgent cause, that the law which so briefly vnder as few words as well could be, compriseth exceeding much matter, should expresly mention father and mother, when as there is one word, parent, which includeth both. Now what other reason can be rendred then the point in hand? It is worthy to be noted, how the Apostle contenteth not himselfe to haue named parents, which implieth both, but also annexeth the expresse words of the law, which in particu∣lar setteth downe, father and mother. It is expresly set downe of Iaakob that he obeyed his father and his mother. Among o∣ther Gen. 28. 7. pen-men of Scripture Salomon expresly mentioneth both father and mother, euen almost twenty seuerall times in Prou. Many reasons there be to inforce this point. 1. Both parents are vnder God a like meanes of their chil∣drens Reasons. being. Children come out of the substance of both alike. 2. The care and pains of both for the good of the children is very great: I know not of whether the greater. The mothers paines and care in bringing forth the childe is indeed the grea∣ter, and it may be also the greater in bringing vp the childe, especially while it is young, at least if she giue it sucke her selfe: yet afterwards the fathers exceedeth in prouiding fit calling,
sufficient meanes of maintenance, yea and portion or inheri∣tance for it, and that after he himselfe is dead. Thus one way or other the childe is equally bound to both: and according∣ly Gods law maketh no difference betwixt them. Obiect. The wife is subiect to her husband: therefore a childe ought to preferre his father before his mother. Answ. Though there be a difference betwixt father and Both parents to be of like account with children. mother in relation of one to another, yet in relation to their children they are both as one, and haue a like authority ouer them. Now children are not to looke to that difference that is betwixt their parents in that mutuall relation that is be∣twixt husband and wife, but to that authority which both pa∣rents haue ouer their children: and so to carry an equall re∣spect to both. 2. Obiect. What if the fathers and mothers disposition Direction for a childe when one parent commandeth one thing, the other another. be contrary: and the one command what the other forbids. Answ. The thing commanded or forbidden must be ob∣serued: if it be about a thing simply good or euill, lawfull, or vnlawfull, then the parent which would haue the thing lawfull to be done, or vnlawfull to be for borne (though it be the mo∣ther) must be obeyed: for in this case she is backt with Gods authority. But if the matter be meerely indifferent, then I doubt not but the father must be obeyed: yet so as the childe no way shew any contempt to his mother, but with all reue∣rence and humility make it knowne to her that it is best both for her-selfe and himselfe, that his father be obeyed. But if the fathers contrary authority be not interposed, or if the father be dead, then is a mother as simply and absolutely to be obey∣ed in all things, as a father. §. 55. Of pretences alledged to obey father rather then mo∣ther. Contrary on the one side is their childish fondnesse who so wholly respect their mother, and seeke to please her, as they little regard their father, vnlesse through feare they be forced thereto: and on the other side, their scornefull spirit who only beare respect to their father, and altogether neglect their mo∣ther, if not despise her. For the most part, of the two, the mo∣ther is lesse regarded. The reasons whereof I take to be these
following, whereunto I will annex particular meanes to re∣moue the seeming force of those reasons, as antidotes or reme∣dies vnto them. 1. The mother by reason of her sex is commonly the wea∣ker, and subiect to more infirmities. Answ. Children ought rather to looke vpon their mo∣thers place and authority, then their person and infirmitie: so these would no whit impaire their respect of the other. 2. The mother is more indulgent and tender to her chil∣dren: and vseth more familiarity towards them: now familia∣rity Familiaritas parit contemp∣tum. Teren. in Andr. breedeth contempt. Answ. This is the abuse of familiarity: loue should breed loue: and loue must be ordered according to the condition of the parties louing, and loued. As children with one eie be∣hold the affection of the mother, so with another they should behold Gods image in the mother; and then (that which is §. 2, 3. noted as the ground of all childrens dutie) a louing-feare would be wrought in their heart, which would cast out all contempt. 3. The mother hath not that power to reward or reuenge that a father hath. Answ. 1. This is not to obey in the Lord. No outward re∣spect should moue the childe to obey his parents so much as conscience to God-wards. If children duly considered God, how he hath made no difference, but commanded them to obey both alike, and how he is able abundantly to reward, and seuerely to reuenge, that reason would be no reason. 4. The mother is subiect to the father. Answ. This was remoued §. 54. before. As a generall answer to these and all other such pretences as can be alledged, let it be noted that the Lord doth not only in expresse termes charge children to feare their mother, but also (the more to presse this point) sometime setteth the mo∣ther in the first place, thus; Yee shall feare euery man his mother, Leu. 19. 3. and his father: which is not so to be taken as if the mother of the two were the more excellent (in this respect the father for the most part is first named) but because it is the truest triall of a childes subiection to be subiect to his mother. He that
willingly and conscionably subiecteth himselfe to her, who is in relation to her husband the inferiour, in sex the weaker, in condition subiect to more infirmities, in her affections lesse moderate, in power lesse able to reward, or to punish, will much rather (no doubt) subiect himselfe to his father. §. 56. Of the difference of childrens subiection to naturall parents, and to such as only are in the place of parents. Beside naturall parents, there are others by God so set ouer children, as they owe in conscience child-like dutie vnto them. These in generall are such as are in the place of parents, and so performe, or at least ought to performe, the dutie of pa∣rents to children. They are of two sorts. 1. Such as are ioyned to a naturall parent in mariage, com∣monly called Step-fathers, and step-mothers, or fathers in law, and mothers in law. 2. Such as haue the gouernment and tuition of children committed to them, commonly called Guardians, Tutors, Go∣uernours: yea also foster-fathers, and foster-mothers. Quest. Is the same dutie in euery respect due to those who are in place of parents, as to naturall parents themselues? Answ. Not so. There is such a prerogatiue appertaining to naturall parents from whom children haue receiued their be∣ing, that many things wherein children by an absolute neces∣sity De necessitate. are bound to them, are bound vnto the other who are but in place of parents, only by the law of honesty, of meetnesse & De honestate. conueniency. Whence it commeth to passe that such things as being done by children rebelliously without, or against the consent of naturall parents proue meere nullities, will stand in force though they be done without or against the consent of such as are only in the place of parents: instance contracts made about goods, lands and such other things as parents re∣taine a right in: whereunto many good Diuines adde See §. 16. con∣tracts of mariage, of calling and the like. Yet notwithstanding seeing in conscience we are bound to those things which the law of honesty, and conueniency re∣quirety (for whatsoeuer things are honest, iust, and of good report, Phil. 4. 8.
are to be done) great is that dutie which children owe to those who are in place of parents. §. 57. Of childrens subiection to fathers and mothers in law. Fathers and mothers in law are to be ranked in the first de∣gree of those who are in the place of naturall parents. Very good proofe there is in Scripture for childrens subiection to them. The respect which Moses beare to his father in law, Exo. 18. 7. Ruth. 1. & 2. Luk. 2. 51. and Ruth to her mother in law, and Christ himselfe to his sup∣posed father, are commended for this very purpose. Subiection is noted in Christs example: Reuerence in Moses: Recompence in Ruths. The mariage bond maketh man and wife one flesh: where∣upon 1. Reason. the naturall parent that marieth another, maketh that other one with him, and in that respect is as a parent to the chil∣dren, and by them ought to be accounted so. The law of God maketh it plaine inst for a sonne to vnco∣uer Leu. 18. 8, 17. the shame of his mother in law, or for a father in law to vn∣couer the shame of his daughter in law. Whereby it appeareth that fathers and mothers in law, are by Gods law in the very place and steed of naturall parents to their children, and ac∣cordingly as naturall parents are to be honoured. Besides it is a great honour which a childe doth to his na∣turall 2. Reason. father or mother to respect such as they haue made one flesh with themselues, as they doe their owne parent. So as to honour a father, or mother in law, is to honour a naturall parent. Contrary is the minde and cariage of most children. Very few beare a reuerend, dutifull, and child-like respect to step∣fathers, and step-mothers: but for the most part despise them in heart, grumble at them in speech, and are very vndutifull in their behauiour: whence it commeth to passe that they bring much griefe to their naturall parent, and oft cause much dis∣cord and dissention betwixt their naturall, and step-parent being herein set on worke by Satan, who laboureth what he can to disunite those whom God hath neerely vnited together and made one flesh. Lamentable experience sheweth that the second, third, or any after-mariages are seldome so comfortable and peaceable as the first: especially if either the one, or other,
or both haue children. The cause thereof, for the most part, is in children, who brooke not fathers or mothers in law. Obiect. Nature cannot so well brooke a step-parent, as a na∣turall parent. Answ. 1. If not so well, yet despise them not: there is a difference betwixt extremes. 2. Conscience and religion ought to alter corrupt nature. Looke to Gods ordinance: and let Gods feare possesse thine heart, that that may bring thee to doe what nature cannot. 2. Obiect. Fathers and Mothers in law seldome respect their husbands or wiues former children. Answ. This obiection more beseemeth the mouth of a bar∣barian then a Christian. The Gospell teacheth to be subiect not 1 Pet. 2. 18. Rom. 12. 21. only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward: and not to be ouercome of euill, but to ouercome euill with goodnesse. The Scripture reckoneth such as rise vp against their parents Mic. 7. 6. in law, among such as rise vp against their naturall parents: shew∣ing thereby that the impietie of those, is as blame-worthy, as the impietie of these. §. 58. Of childrens subiection to Guardians, Tutors, &c. For childrens subiection to Gouernours, Guardians, and Tu∣tors, the Apostle saith that a childe is vnder them. If by the law Galat. 4. 2. children are vnder them, they ought in equitie to be subiect to them. It is expresly noted of Esther, euen after the King had cho∣sen her for his wife, that she did the commandement of Mordecai Esth. 2. 20. (who was as a Guardian to her) like as when she was brought vp with him. A memorable patterne for this purpose. What preten∣ces might she haue made to haue cast off all manner of subiection? Mordecai was but her cosen: she was now aduanced aboue him: a wife she was, and so subiect to her husband: yea a Kings wife, and so her selfe a Queene: yet she was subiect, and her subiection commended. We reade that the children of the Prophets much 2 Kin. 2. 15, &c. & 6. 1. respected Elisha, did reuerence to him, and were obedient to him, because he was as a father and tutor vnto them: in which respect also Elisha was as a childe subiect to Eliah, whom he cal∣led 2 King. 2. 12. father. Guardians, Tutors, and such like ouer-seers of children, haue a parents charge laid vpon them, as we shall Treat 6. §. 74, &c. after shew: great rea∣son
therefore that child-like dutie should be yeelded to them. Their honour must be answerable to their charge and care. Contrary is the conceit of many lawlesse children, whose pa∣rents being dead, or they being sent and placed abroad out of the gouernment of their parents, thinke they are cleane free from all gouernment, and may liue as they list. Their practise being cor∣respondent to this opinion, they runne into all riot, and in time bring themselues to vtter ruine. It is the ouerthrow of many chil∣dren, that they regard not their Guardians, Tutors, and Gouer∣nours: and God in iudgement bringeth many such refractarie children to some fearefull & shamefull end or other. Let children therefore be wise, and not take too much libertie to themselues. Thus farre haue beene handled the duties of children in their seuerall kindes, the manner of performing them, and the parties to whom they are to be performed. It remaineth to speake of the reasons which the Apostle alledgeth to in∣force those duties. §. 59. Of the place of parents, whereby children ought to be mo∣ued to obey them. The reasons which the Apostle vseth to moue children to per∣forme their dutie are foure: The first is taken from the place of the parent. The second from the equitie of the thing. The third from Gods expresse charge. The fourth from Gods promise. I. The place of a parent is noted forth by this phrase, IN THE LORD: which as it affordeth a . 37. limitation, and giueth a §. 52. dire∣ction to children, so it addeth a spur vnto them, to stirre them vp to performe their dutie: for it sheweth that parents are to then children in the Lords steed: as an euidence thereof hath God Liberis suis pa∣ter Dei vice est. Greg. Naz. ad Vitit. communicated to them this glorious and honourable title (FA∣THER) which is See §. 5. proper and peculiar to himselfe. Now then parents being to their children in Gods steed, and by vertue of their place bearing Gods image, children in obeying their parents, obey God; in refusing to obey them, refuse to obey God. A strong motiue is this first motiue. For who is so void of religion, but will thinke it most meet, that God should be honoured? or
who so impious, as to refuse to yeeld dutie to God? Here then children may learne in one maine point how to honour the Lord, & shew themselues children of God. And let them here by know, that disobedient and vndutifull children, that resist the authoritie of parents, resist the ordinance of God, and receiue to themselues Rom. 13. 2. damnation. §. 60. Of the equitie whereby children should be moued to obey their parents. II. The second reason in these words, for this is right, though it be not of greater force, yet is it more plainly and expresly no∣ted to be a reason, as the causall particle (for) prefixed before it, sheweth. It is a generall reason drawne from common equitie; a reason which may moue all sorts, euen Infidels and Pagans: there∣fore much more Christians. In saying, It is right, he implieth three things. 1. That it is agreeable to all law. To the law of God, which Right implieth three things. 1. It is agree∣able to all law. is the fountaine of equitie. To the law of Nature, which proceeds from thence. And to the law of Nations, which is answerable in many respects. The forenamed proofes out of Gods word, shew it to be agreeable to Gods law. The precepts which heathen men haue giuen of this point, shew it to be agreeable to the law of na∣ture. And the many Constitutions of Law-makers, in all ages, shew it to be agreeable to the law of nations. 2. That the place of parents requireth as much. For RIGHT 2. It is due by vertue of pa∣rents place. requireth that euery one haue his owne, that which is his due. It being therefore right, that children obey their parents, that dutie s due to them. 3. That parents deserue as much: for right presupposeth de∣ert. 3. It is a debt. That which is done of right, is done by way of recompence. The cause of this desert, is the loue which parents beare to chil∣dren, the paine, paines, care, and cost they haue beene at, in bring∣ing them forth, and bringing them vp. These things being implied vnder right, note what followeth rom the force of this reason, 1. Disobedient and vndutifull children, transgresse against Gods law, against common equitie of all nations, and against light f nature: so as they are vnworthy of the name of Christians, hey are worse then Infidels, yea worse then the brute beasts.
2. They haue no respect to the place of their parents, they dis∣grace the image of God, which their parents by vertue of their place carrie, and they disturbe that comely order and degree, which God hath set among men. 3. They ill repay their parents care and paines for their good, and shew themselues both vngratefull and vnnaturall: which are two most monstrous and odious sinnes. §. 61. Of Gods accepting childrens obedience. The forenamed reason is by this same Apostle in another place thus set downe, This is well-pleasing to the Lord. By comparing Coloss. 3. 20. that place with my text, I obserue, that What is right is well-pleasing to the Lord. And againe, What is well-pleasing to the Lord is right. These two propositions, are (as we speake in Schooles) conuer∣tible and reciprocall; either of them true of the other euery way. Wherefore the Apostle, in another place, ioyneth them both to∣gether. For hauing exhorted children to recompence their pa∣rents, he saith, That is good and acceptable before God. . Good or 1 Tim. 5. 4. honest is in effect the same that . right. This sheweth, that dutifull children, as they doe that which is good, or honest, and right vnto their parents; so also therein they highly please God: so as they may be sure not to lose thereby. At Gods hand they shall receiue a reward, though their parents should little regard their dutifulnesse. Thus God dealt with Iaa∣kob. His father in law ill repaid his faithfulnesse: but God looked Gen. 31. 7, &c. vers 42. vpon him, and abundantly recompenced all his paines. This sheweth againe, that vndutifull children, as they doe not that which is right, but rather wrong vnto their parents; so they highly displease God: they may be sure therefore not to escape vnpunished, though their parents, through ouer-much indulgen∣cie, should let them alone: instance the two impious children of Elie, Hophni and Phinehas: and the two rebellious children of 1 Sam. 2. 34. 2 Sam. 18. 9. 1 King. 2. 25. Dauid, Absolom, and Adoniah. This therefore addeth force to the second reason, and moueth children to doe right to their parents, by obeying them, as they respect God, his good pleasure, or displeasure: as they looke for recompence, or feare vengeance from him.
§. 62. Of Gods charge, how inuiolable a bond it is to tie chil∣dren to obey their parents. III. The third drawne from Gods charge is not only in ex∣presse termes noted, but for more weight the very words of the morall law are quoted (Honour thy father and thy mother:) and it is added, that this is a commandement, yea the first com∣mandement, and that with promise, all which is for amplifica∣tion of the point. Here then consider we 1. The reason it selfe. 2. The amplification thereof.   From the reason that it is Gods charge, I gather these three points. 1. That it is no arbitrary matter left to childrens discretion Childrens o∣bedience to parents is, 1. No arbitra∣ry thing. whether they will obey their parents or no: but a matter whereunto in conscience they are bound, euen as they owe alleageance to God himselfe the great law-giuer: so as in neg∣lecting dutie to parents, children sinne euen against God him∣selfe: for the same God who hath commanded vs to honour himselfe, hath commanded vs to honour father and mother. 2. That this is a perpetuall and a generall law: a law where∣unto 2. An eternall law, and gene∣rall to all children. all children of all times, places, sexes, estates and degrees alwaies haue beene, still are, and euer shall be bound. For the morall law is of that extent: it is generall for all persons: per∣petuall for all times. Therefore no children may thinke to be exempted from it. Quest. What if children be growne to yeeres, and not vn∣der their parents gouernment? Answ. There may be some difference both in some parts of subiection, and also in the manner of subiection betwixt such children as remaine vnder their parents gouernment, and such as are freed from it: but yet so long as a childe hath a parent, of what age or estate so euer he be, he oweth an honour vnto his parent. Gen. 47. 12. & 48. 12. & 50. 5. Ioseph when he was a great Gouernour of Egypt, a man growne, hauing wife and children, yet performed the honour of reuerence, obedience, and recompence vnto his father. 1 King. 2. 19. 3. Indispensa∣ble. Salomon when he was in an higher place then Ioseph, euen an absolute King, did the honour of Reuerence to his mother. 3. That no man can giue children any dispensation, or ex
emption from their dutie to parents. If any may, he must be either the law-maker himselfe, or one greater then he, one that hath power ouer him. Now God is the author and giuer of that law, God spake all these words, &c. But is any greater then Exo. 20. 1. God? hath any power ouer him? Who then can dispence with children in this kinde? Hence then I inferre these two conclusions. 1. That the Popes dispensation is nothing worth: they who make it to be of force, must make him greater then God, which is a horrible blasphemy. 2. Though parents themselues should not exact dutie of their children, yet children were bound to performe dutie to them, because of Gods charge. To this therefore are children to looke. This sheweth that there is no lesse paine hanging ouer the heads of the transgressors of this charge, then the curse of the law, eternall condemnation. §. 63. Of the title FIRST giuen to the fift commandement. In the amplification of the forenamed reason, the Apostle stileth the commandement of honouring parents the first with promise, as to shew that it is the first which hath a particular promise annexed to it; so it is the first that God gaue of any dutie to be performed vnto man. The very order of the deca∣logue manifesteth the truth hereof. The reason is cleere: Ho∣nour due to parents is the ground of all the duties required in the second table: for if dutie be not performed to such as we are bound vnto by some peculiar bond, may we thinke that it will be performed to such as we are bound vnto at large? Now of all to whom we are first and most bound, and to whom we owe our first dutie, our parents are the persons. They there∣fore who are rebellious against their parents, and refuse to doe their dutie to them, will hardly performe dutie to any other. Little hope that a disobedient childe will proue a profitable member in Church or common-wealth. Absolom, who was a rebellious childe, proued but a traiterous subiect: and Hoph and Phineas that refused to hearken to the voice of their fa∣ther, proued but sacrilegious Priests. Wherefore if any pre∣cept of the second table be conscionably to be obserued (as all are, for the same law-maker gaue all, and Christ hath said that
the second table is like the first) then is this of honouring father Mat. 22. 39. and mother, among the rest, and aboue the rest to be obserued, at least if difference of obseruing any may be made, But this particle (first) being set downe, not simply but with a connexion of promise with it (The first with promise) we are duly to consider the promise thereof: whence a fourth reason ariseth. §. 64. Of Gods promise mouing children to obey their parents. The fourth reason taken from Gods promise, is both gene∣rally propounded and particularly exemplified. Propounded in this clause (first with promise.) Exemplified in the third verse. For the Generall. Gods promise made to the performance of any duty, cannot but be a strong motiue to stirre vs vp to performe it. Men hereby doe stirre vp, and prouoke one ano∣ther Promise of re∣ward a great motiue. to performe any thing. Thus Kings when they would faine haue their subiects doe this or that, promise such and such rewards vnto them: Thus masters incite their seruants, pa∣rents their children, and one man another. If the promises of men incourage vs to performe the things which they giue vs in charge, how much more ought the promise of God? Men How Gods promise is a stronger mo∣tiue then any mans. re deceitfull, and may deale doubly, pretending one thing with their mouthes, and intending another with their heart, nd neuer meane to performe what they promise: But God is faithfull and true: his words are as deeds: his promises as per∣formances; so as he neuer maketh shew of more then he means o performe. Againe, mans power is limited; though he truly tend what he promiseth, yet in the performance he may faile ither in that he knew not his owne power, but thought when e made the promise he could haue done more then in the e∣ent he findeth he can doe; or in that he is after wards by some occasion hindered, or disabled. But Gods power cannot be so aitned, or hindered. Besides, men may be taken away before etime of performing their promise is come: but God euer eth, and changeth not. If then mans promises be any mo∣ues to any thing, much more Gods who euer remaineth the me. Betwixt God and man there is no proportion, no com∣rison. How Gods promise com∣mendeth Gods loue. This motiue doth exceedingly commend Gods fatherly
indulgencie towards vs, and the earnest desire he hath of our good. For he hath such power and authoritie ouer all his crea∣tures, that the very knowledge of his will ought to prouoke them to performe any dutie which he shall command: and if they obey not, he might presently execute vengeance vpon them. But considering that we are his children, and need ma∣ny allurements to draw vs on by little and little, he according∣ly dealeth with vs. He standeth not wholly and only vpon his authoritie, but addeth promises thereto: (for this is a comman∣dement with promise.) If notwithstanding all this, children refuse to obey their parents, may not the Lord iustly expostu∣late the matter with them, as sometimes in another case he did with the Israelites, and say, Iudge betweene me and these chil∣dren: Isa. 5. 3, 4. what could I haue done more that I haue not done? I gaue them an expresse charge to honour their parents: I laid it downe in the first place as a maine and principall charge: to incourage them to keepe it, I added a promise of good to redound to them∣selues: what could I doe more? Doe not they iustly deserue ven∣geance that regard none of these? Thus, in that this is a com∣mandement with promise, we see how children disobedient to their parents are both rebellious against God in regard of the commandement which they transgresse, and iniu∣rious to themselues in regard of the promise which they make to be void and of no effect. Of this particular promise see more in the first treatise, §. 97, 98, &c.
The sixth Treatise. The Duties of Parents. §. 1. Of the heads of Parents duties. EPHES. 6. 4. And ye Fathers prouoke not your children to wrath, but bring them vp in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. NExt to childrens, follow Parents duties, which the Apostle layeth down in this fourth verse: where he noteth, 1. The duties 2. The parties 1. That are to performe the duties, Fathers. 2. To whom they are to be performed, Children. The duties are set downe, 1. By prohibition. 2. By precept.   The prohibition noteth out one extreme, which is ouer∣much rigour, (Prouoke not to wrath) The inference of the precept vpon the prohibition noteth out another extreme, which is ouer-much-remisnesse. The precept it selfe enioyneth to parents three duties. 1. To nourish children, namely with food, apparrell, and other like necessaries (Nourish them.) 2. To nurture them, namely with good discipline (In nurture.)
3. To instruct them, namely in the waies of God (And ad∣monition of the Lord.) Nature teach∣eth Vnreasonable Creatures to doe the First Ciuility Reasonable Men   Second   Piety Christians   Third.   To these heads may all the seuerall points which I shall de∣liuer concerning parents duties, be referred. That Parents may the better discerne how one dutie follow∣eth another, I will proceed in this order. 1. The fountaine of all duties, shall be declared. 2. The streames that issue thence,   The streames shall be diuided into two riuers. In the first are those generall duties that are continually to be done. In the second, such particular duties as are to be applied to the seuerall ages of children. There are two principall generall duties. 1. Faithfull prayer to God. 2. Vpright walking with God. All the particulars may be comprised vnder this one head, A prouident care. And this hath respect, 1. To the Infancy of children, 2. To their Youth, 3. To the time of their placing forth, 4. To the time of parents departing out of this world. §. 2. Of that Loue which parents owe to their children. The Fountaine of parents du∣ties is Loue. Tit. 2. 4. This is expresly enioyned to them. Many ap∣proued examples are recorded hereof: as Gen. 22. 2. Abrahams, & 25. 28. Isaacks, Ibid. Rebekahs, and others. Great reason there is why this affection should be fast fixed in the heart of parents towards their children. For great is that paine, paines, cost, and care, which parents must vndergoe
for their children. But if loue be in them, no paine, paines, cost, or care, will seeme too much. Herein appeareth the wise prouidence of God, who by nature hath so fast fixed loue in the hearts of parents, as if there be any in whom it aboundeth not, he is counted vnnaturall. If loue did not abound in pa∣rents, many children would be neglected and lost. For if pa∣rents look not to their children, who will? If none looke to them, they must needs perish: for they are not able to helpe them∣selues. As God by nature hath planted loue in all parents, so Christians ought euen for con∣science sake, to nourish, increase, and blow vp this fire of loue, that they may thereby be made more forward to doe euery duty with cheerefulnesse. The more feruent loue is, the more readily will euery duty be per∣formed. As I haue heretofore laid downe Loue a fountaine of wiues, husbands, and chil∣drens duties; so must I con∣tinue my course, and set it forth as the fountaine of parents duties. For the Scripture hath noted it as a dutie belonging to all and euery of them: and there∣fore I might not omit it in any of them. Yet let not any thereupon thinke, that the same point is oft handled, and repeated againe and a∣gaine. For according to the seuerall parties, and the se∣uerall relation they haue to others, there are seuerall fruits of loue: euen as the same moisture of the earth causeth seuerall and diuers fruits, according to the se∣uerall kindes of plants that receiue that moisture. Com∣pare the seuerall places, where this generall duty of loue hath beene handled, and you will finde the man∣ner of handling to be diffe∣rent, and to afford new mat∣ter. Obiect. As too much fire is dangerous, so too much loue. Answ. True. Wherefore as in other things, so in this, the golden meane must be kept. No dutie so holy and necessarie, ut may be peruerted. Let the extremes be auoided, and the meane will better be kept. §. 3. Of the contraries to loue. The extreme contrary to loue in the defect is want of natu∣rall Want of natu∣rall affection in parents. affection, which is reckoned in the Rom. 1. 30. Tit. 3. 3. catalogue of notorious nnes. Though loue of children be by nature engrauen in mans heart, yet many cleane put it out through couetousnesse, st, vaine-glory, superstition, idolatry, and other vices: where∣by it commeth to passe that in stead of the good which they ould doe for their children, they bring much mischiefe vpon hem. Some spare not the pretious life of their children.
Among these, barbarous idolaters doe most exceed in this kinde of vnnaturall cruelty, sacrificing their children, and of∣fering them vp to deuils. To this the great bloud-sucker Sa∣tan of old brought not only the heathen, who being ignorant of God did seruice to the diuell, but also the 2 King. 16. 3. & 21. 6. Ezek. 16. 20. Israelites to whom Iehouah the true God made himselfe knowne, and ex∣presly Leu. 18. 21. forbid this cruelty, and that & 20. 2. vnder paine of death. Behold how superstition and idolatry blinde the eies of men. Purc. Pilgr. in Americ. cap. 7. & cap. 11. They who haue beene among the Sauadges in Virginea, Florida, India, and other like places testifie that such cruelty is vsed to this day. And it is rendred as a maine reason why, notwithstanding such spacious places as they haue, they in∣crease no more in multitude, because many of their children from time to time are offered vp in sacrifice. Reasonable men herein shew themselues more vnreasona∣ble then vnreasonable beasts, which doe what possibly they can to preserue their young ones. Though not so high, yet too high on this ladder of vnna∣turalnesse Haters of chil∣dren for piety. doe they climbe, who hate their children, and that (which maketh the sin to be out of measure sinful) for piety and integrity; as many Popish and profane parents, who haue chil∣dren truly religious: and in that respect ought so much the more to be loued. The extreme in the excesse is too much doting vpon chil∣dren: Doting on children. as they doe who so vnmeasurably loue them, as they make reckoning of nothing in comparison of children. Euen God himselfe is lightly esteemed, his worship neglected, his word transgressed, all dutie to others omitted, their owne soules forgotten thorow care of children. Is not this mee apish kindnesse? for Apes kill their young ones with hugging. This is no loue, but plaine dotage. But what may be said of those that are so hellishly enamoured with their children as to commit incest or buggery with them? §. 4. Of Parents praying for their children. The first and best streame which issueth out of the forena∣med fountaine of loue is faithfull and feruent prayer. This extendeth it selfe to all things, at all times, thorowout the whole course of the childes life. It is the first and it is the last
dutie which parents ought to performe to their children: 1 Thes 5. 17. . euen that which they must doe without intermission; Pray without ceasing. Though praier be a generall dutie which all Christians owe Praier a pecu∣liar dutie of parents. one to another, yet after a peculiar manner doth it apper∣taine to parents: and of all others they are most bound to it. For the promise which God maketh to a parent is extended to his seed and children, as these and such like Scriptures shew, Gen. 17. 7. I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed: Deut. 5. 29. That it may be well with them and with their children: Act. 2. 39. The promise is vnto you, and vnto your children. Parents therefore with most assurance of faith may call vpon God for their children. For Gods pro∣mise is the ground of faith: so farre as Gods promise is exten∣ded, so farre our faith may and ought to extend it selfe. Hence hath arisen the commendable custome of childrens asking Treat 5. §. 9. their parents blessing: which intimateth a desire that parents would pray for Gods blessing on them. This dutie of praier must be performed before parents haue children (that they may haue some, as Gen. 25. 21. Isaak, 1 Sam. 1. 10. Paulam antè votis quàm vtero concepisti. Hier. ad 1 aet. Annah and others did Gen. 25. 21.) and so soone as children are conceiued, espe∣cially if they obserue them to be quicke in the wombe (as Gen. 25. 22. Rebekah did) and againe when they are borne (as Luk. 1. 64. Zachariah did) and thorowout the whole course of their life (as Iob. 1. 5. Iob did) and when they are going out of this world, and leauing their children (as Gen. 27. 4. Isaak did.) There is no one thing wherein and whereby parents may doe more good for their children, then in and by true praier. God hath sanctified praier as a meanes to receiue all needfull blessing from himselfe the fountaine of all blessing. If there∣fore Gods blessing be of vse to children (what Atheists are they that beleeue it not?) then also is praier by which it is ob∣tained. §. 5. Of vices contrary to parents praying for their children. The very neglect of this dutie is a sinne contrary to the du∣tie Parents neg∣lect of praier. it selfe: and many parents there be that stand guilty of this sinne. Some thinke it needlesse to pray for a childe before it be borne, not considering that in sinne it is conceiued. When it is borne they referre this dutie to the midwife, whereas it
properly appertaineth to the father. After it is growne to any ripenesse, they put it off to the childe to pray for it selfe. And when they are on their death-bed, they thinke it enough if they can pray for their owne soules. Such parents shew lit∣tle true loue to their children: but lesse faith in God. But what may we say or thinke of such impious parents as Parents im∣precations against chil∣dren. feare not to make fearefull imprecations against their chil∣dren? God oft in wrath and vengeance heareth such impreca∣tions to the woe of parent and childe: whereby he sheweth his great indignation against them for the same. §. 6. Of parents endeauouring to be righteous that they may leaue Gods blessing to their children. Another generall branch proceeding from parents loue to their children, is, that for their childrens sake they endeauour to walke vprightly before God, and to please him. This I doe the rather note, because I finde the reward promised to righte∣ous parents to be extended vnto their children Psal. 1. 12. 2. The genera∣tion of the righteous shall be blessed, saith Dauid. And Salomon, Pro. 20. 7. Blessed shall his children be after him: and againe, & 13. 22. The good man shall giue inheritance vnto his childrens children. Deut. 5. 29. This mo∣tiue is therefore vrged by the holy Ghost to prouoke parents vnto all righteousnesse. Thus doth the Lord extend the reward of righteous parents vnto their children to shew his great good liking, and high ap∣probation of righteousnesse. Reade for this purpose, 1 King. 11. 34. & 2 King. 10. 30. 1. Obiect. Ezec. 18. 20. The righteousnesse of the righteous shall be vpon himselfe. Answ. That is meant rather of a mans personall righteous∣nesse, and grace it selfe which is not communicated to chil∣dren, then of the fruit thereof: That faith in Christ, feare of God, obedience to Gods word, or any other personall grace which is in righteous parents, shall not iustifie or saue their children. For the iust shall liue by his owne faith. Yet this hin∣dereth Hab. 2. 4. not but that the benefit and blessing of righteous pa∣rents may fall vpon their children according to the extent of Gods promise. 2. Obiect. By experience we finde it verified, that the chil∣dren
of some righteous parents are cursed: and the Scripture giueth vs many examples thereof: as Gen. 4. 11. Cain, & 9. 25. Cham, 2 Sam. 18. 15. Abso∣lom, and others like them. 1. Answ. Such children by their vnworthy, and degene∣rat cariage make forfeiture of Gods couenant and 1 Sam. 2. 30. so depriue themselues of the benefit thereof. 2. Answ. Many good reasons may be giuen why God should sometimes alter his course, and with-hold his blessings from the children of his seruants. As 1. Lest Gods gifts and blessings should otherwise seeme to come rather by naturall propagation from the parent, then by free donation from God. 2. Lest parents should thereby be drawne to neglect the meanes of good education. 3. Lest children also themselues, trusting too much to their parents righteousnesse, should take too much liberty, and waxe licentious. 4. Lest Gods free election should seeme hereby to be re∣strained. 3. Obiect. If this be so, what motiue can it be vnto parents to labour after righteousnesse for their childrens sake? Answ. Though God doe reserue in himselfe a freedome to order his blessings as it pleaseth him, and to bestow them vpon whom he will: and thereupon sometimes blesseth the childe of a wicked parent (instance 2 Chr. 28. 27. Hezekiah) & denieth his blessing to the childe of a righteous parent (instance 2 Sam. 13. 14, 29. Relinque bonam filijs memoriam magis quàm diuitias mul∣tas. Bas serm. in Scrip. loc. Ammon) yet in that it is a very vsuall course with him to extend his blessing (according to his promise) to the children of the righteous, it is a strong motiue to such as desire the good of their children, the rather for their childrens sake to endeauour after righte∣ousnesse: for thus doe they vse the meanes which by Gods word is warranted and sanctified for procuring Gods blessing to their children. Leaue therefore a good memory to thy chil∣dren rather then much wealth. §. 7. Of the preposterous course which couetous and vniust pa∣rents take for the good of their children. Contrary is the course of such parents as by vnrighteous meanes thinke to prouide well for their children. For many
doe not only too carkingly, and distrustfully moile and toile to scrape together great masses of money, or great store of land, or other stockes for their children, neglecting duties of piety and mercy, but also by vniust and wrongfull courses defraud others to make their children rich. So common is this vndue course of prouiding for children, as thence hath arisen this prouerbe, Happy are those children whose parents goe to the de∣uill. A cursed prouerbe. For what other thing can it intend, but this, that they who feare not God, nor take care for their owne saulation, will haue most respect to the outward estate of their children, and be most carefull to make them great, and rich in this world? Wherein note how many waies they be∣wray their notorious folly. 1. They preferre the outward estate of their children be∣fore the eternall saluation of their owne soules. Yea and be∣fore God himselfe. 2. They place the happinesse of their children in the goods of this world; Pro. 23. 5. then which nothing more vaine. 3. They make themselues drudges to their children, and so debase themselues below that dignity which by reason of Gods image on them, appertaineth to them. 4. They with much paines, care, griefe, and feare are long gathering that which their children in short time most rio∣tously and prodigally will lauish out. 5. They make themselues vassals to Satan and seeke by him to be made rich: whereas indeed Tro. 10. 22. it is the blessing of God that maketh rich. Thus they take a wrong course to get wealth. If it be said that many are thus made rich, I answer, that as Hos. 13. 11. Ne liberos prae∣texas. Qui enim filium fecit, & te fecit: qui etiam tibi occasiones nu∣triend praebet, & filio praebe∣bit vitae sub∣sidia. Basil. loc. it. God gaue a King to Israell, so he giueth wealth to them, in wrath: and in wrath will he take it away. 6. They bring Gods curse into their house, and leaue it vn∣to their children: So as these are the riches that are reserued to the owners thereof for their euill. Let not therefore care for chil∣dren draw thee to any coueteous or vniust courses: but know that he who made thy sonne made thee also, and he who af∣foorded thee meanes of nourishment, will also affoord thy children sufficient succour.
§. 8. Of Parents prouidence for their children. How farre pa∣rents proui∣dence exten∣deth it selfe. The head, whereunto all the particular duties, which parents owe to their children, may be referred, is A prouident care for their childrens good. This extendeth it selfe to all times, and to all things. To all times, as to the infancie, youth, and man-age of their children: and that not only while parents liue, but after their de∣parture. To all things, namely, tending both to the temporall good of their children, and also to their spirituall good. Children are of the very substance of their parents, & therefore ought parents so farre to seeke their childrens good as their owne. The patternes of holy parents recorded and commended in Scripture, doe liuely set forth this prouident care. But this generall we will exemplifie in the particulars: and in order declare how parents must prouide both for the temporall, and also for the spirituall good of their children in euery degree of their age. They who at any time in any thing are negligent and carelesse of their childrens good, offend in the contrary to this generall dutie. The heinousnesse of which offences will appeare in the particulars. §. 9. Of a mothers care ouer her childe while it is in her wombe. The first age of a childe is the infancie thereof. I will therefore first shew how therein parents must procure the temporall good of their children, and then their spirituall good. The first part of a childs infancie is while it remaineth in the mothers wombe. Here therefore the dutie lieth principally vpon the mother: who so soone as she perceiueth a childe to be concei∣ued in her wombe, ought to haue an especiall care thereof, that (so much as in her lieth) the childe may be safely brought forth. (Grauidae corpora curare debent. Mens item earum quietem deside∣rat. Quae enim procreantur à matre in cuius aluo continen∣tur, alimentum capiunt, vt à terra ea-quae gignantur ex ea. Arist. Pol. lib. 7. The heathen Philosophen, by light of nature, obserued this to be a dutie; and prescribed it to mothers.) A mother then must haue a tender care ouer her selfe when shee is with childe: for the childe being lodged in her, and receiuing nourishment from her (as plants from the earth) her well-being tendeth much to the good and safetie of the childe: but the hurt that commeth to her, maketh the childe the worse, if it be not a meanes to destroy it.
Why was the charge of Iudg. 13. 4. abstaining from wine, strong drinke, and vncleane things, giuen to Manoahs wife, but because of the childe which she conceiued? In this case there is a double bond to make mothers carefull of themselues. 1. Their owne, 2. Their childs good. Husbands also in this case must be very tender ouer their wiues, and helpfull to them in all things needfull, both in regard of that dutie which they owe to their wiues, and also of that they Iudg. 13. 11, &c. owe to their children. Why was Manoah so desirous to heare himselfe the forenamed direction which the Angell gaue to his wife? and why did the Angell againe repeat it to him, but to shew it belonged to him to see her obserue it? They who through violence of passion, whether of griefe, or Contrary. anger, or through violent motion of the bodie, as by dancing, stri∣uing, 1. To miscarry through neg∣ligence. running, galloping on horsebacke, or the like: or through distemper of the bodie, by eating things hurtfull, by eating too much, by too much abstinence, by too much bashfulnesse in con∣cealing their desires and longings (as we speake) cause any abor∣tion or miscariage, fall into the offence contrary to the forenamed dutie. If women were perswaded that in conscience they are bound to the forenamed dutie, they would, I thinke, be more carefull of themselues. For if through their default, they them∣selues or their childe miscarry, they make themselues guilty of that miscariage: if both miscarry, they make themselues guiltie of the bloud of both; at least in the court of conscience before God. But they who purposely take things to make away their chil∣dren 2. To make a∣way a childe in the wombe. Omne quod for∣matam animam à Deo accepit vindie abitur si iniuslè interi∣matur. Constit. Apost. l. 7. c. 4. in their wombe, are in farre higher degree guiltie of bloud: yea euen of wilfull murther. For that which hath receiued a soule formed in it by God, if it be vniustly cast away, shall be reuenged. So farre forth as husbands are carelesse of their wiues being with childe, denying them things needfull, they are accessarie to the hurt, which the woman, or childe taketh, guiltie of the sin, and liable to the iudgement. §. 10. Of prouiding things needfull for the childe, so soone as it is borne: and of crueltie contrary thereunto. The next degree of a childs infancie, is while it is in the swad∣ling
bands, and remaineth a sucking childe. In this also the care especially lieth vpon the mother: yet so as the father must afford what helpe he can. The first dutie here required is, that sufficient prouision of all things needfull for a childe in that weaknesse be before hand pro∣uided. What the particulars be, women better know, then I can expresse. For me, it is sufficient, to lay downe the dutie in gene∣rall: which is commended vnto vs in that worthy patterne of the Virgin Marie, who though she were very poore, and forced to tra∣uell farre, and brought to bed in a strange place, where she was so little respected, as she was not afforded a place meet for a woman in her case, but was faine to content her selfe with a stable in a common Inne, yet she prouided for her childe. For it is said, She wrapped him in swadling clothes, Luk 2. 7. Contrary is the practise of such lewd and vnnaturall women, as leaue their new-borne children vnder stalls, at mens doores, in Church porches, yea many times in open field. It is noted as a point of vnnaturalnesse in the Ostrich, to leaue her eggs in the earth, and in the dust: in which respect she is said to be hardned against her young ones, as though they were not hers, Iob 39. 14, 16. Much more hardned are the foresaid lewd women. The Eagle is Iniquiffima vo∣lucris Aquila dicitur, quiae taedio nutriendi pullum quem genuit, ipsa fu∣gat. Tales pa∣rentes ij sunt, qui liberos suos infantes expo∣nunt. Basil. Hexam. hom. 8. Necare videtur qui partum ab∣ijcit, & qui pub∣licis locis mise∣ricordiae causa, quam ipse non habet, exponit. Digest. l, 25. tit. 3. §. 4. 1 Pet. 2. 2. counted an vnnaturall bird, because she thrusteth her young ones, which she hath brought forth, out of her nest. Are not then such mothers much more vnnaturall? They oft lay their children forth in publike places, for others to shew that mercy, which they them∣selues haue not. The Ciuill Law iudgeth this to be a kinde of further. §. 11. Of giuing sucke to children. Among other needfull things, the milke of the breast is fit for oung babes, and with it they are to be nourished. I thinke none oubt of the equitie of this. It hath in all ages, and in all coun∣ies, beene accounted the bestfood that can be for young babes. The metaphor, which S. Peter vseth, taken from young infants in these words, As new-borne babes desire the sincere milke of the ord) confirmeth as much. So doth also the desire which such nfants haue to the milke of the breasts: and the abilitie, and omptnesse which is in them to sucke: and Gods prouidence in using a womans breasts to yeeld forth such milke: and the con∣stant
manner of nourishing little infants after this manner, com∣mended in the Scriptures: and (to conclude) the naturall instinct which many vnreasonable creatures haue thus to nourish their young ones. They who on meere curiositie (where no vrgent necessitie re∣quireth) try whether their children may not as birds be nourished without sucke, offend contrary to this dutie; and reiect that meanes which God hath ordained as the best: and so oppose their shallow wit to his vnsearchable wisdome. §. 12. Of mothers giuing sucke to their owne children. Of nourishing children with brest-milke, there is no great que∣stion: therefore I haue with a touch passed it ouer. The chiefest question of doubt is concerning the partie who is bound to this dutie; namely, whether the mother be bound to doe it her selfe or no. Many strong arguments there be to presse it vpon the consci∣ences Postquam ab∣lactaueris cam, &c. dixit Hier. ad Laetam de filia sua. of mothers, and to shew that (so farre as they are able) they are bound to giue sucke to their owne children. Some are taken from the light of Gods word; and some from the light of nature. Gods word doth in many places by iust consequence imply, that it is a bounden dutie: in other places it doth expresly com∣mend it by the practise of holy women: and againe in other pla∣ces it taketh it for a granted truth, and ruled case, not to be denied. 1. The consequences whereby the word implieth this dutie are these: 1. In the blessing giuen to Ioseph thus speaketh old Iaakob, God shall blesse thee with the blessing of the breasts, and of the Gen. 49. 25. wombe. By the blessing of the wombe, what can be meant, but children? By the blessing of the breasts, what, but milke, whereby those children are nourished? As if he had said; I will blesse thee with such women, as shall both beare thee children, and also giue sucke to them which they beare. The consequence then is this: As it is a blessing to haue children of a true lawfull wife; so to haue those children nursed of the same wife their mother. Obiect. They haue the blessing of breasts that haue other women to nurse their children. Answ. By the same reason it may be said, they haue the blessing
of the wombe who haue strange women to beare them chil∣dren. But the ioyning of these two branches of blessing toge∣ther, sheweth that both must be taken in the same kinde: so that as the blessing of the wombe is to haue children of a mans wife, so the blessing of the breasts is to haue them nursed of his wife. If it be a blessing for the woman which beareth the childe to giue it sucke, then mothers are bound to performe this dutie. 2. It is denounced as a curse, that women shall haue a barren Ose. 9. 14. wombe and drie breasts. If it be a curse for women to haue drie breasts, then may not women wittingly make them drie: which all mothers doe, that giue not sucke to their children. 3. Manoahs wife being promised to beare a sonne, had this charge giuen her, Drinke no wine, nor strong drinke. &c. those things were especially hurtfull for her milke. It is therefore implied thereby, that she should so order her diet, as she might well nurse her childe, and haue good milke for him. 4. God by his good prouidence brought it to passe, that the mother of Moses (though she were forced to cast out her Exo. 2. 7, &c. childe) should nurse her owne childe. Yea the mother her selfe was desirous to doe it, and therefore appointed her daughter o watch who should take it vp. These two circumstances mplie that it appertaineth to a mother to nurse her children. 5. The Apostle layeth this downe as a note of a good wo∣man, 1. Tim. 5. 10. who in her place hath beene carefull to doe her dutie, nd thereupon fit to doe seruice in Gods Church (If she haue . ourished her children, or word for word, If she haue fed her children.) Now the proper food for young babes is breast-milk, which, by the Apostles rule, the mother must giue. 6. The same Apostle commandeth mothers to loue their Tit. 2. 4. children. How can a mother better expresse her loue to her oung babe, then by letting it sucke of her owne breasts? As his is a testimony of loue, so it is a meanes of preseruing and increasing loue: for daily experience sheweth that mothers ue those children best to whom they themselues giue sucke. Summe these seuerall consequences together, and we all finde the dutie in question to be very strongly inforced hereby.
1. As a blessing it is promised, that mothers shall giue sucke to the children that they beare. 2. As a curse it is threatned, that women shall not be able to giue sucke. 3. An Angell gaue direction to a mother so to carrie her selfe as she might haue store of good milke for the childe which she should beare. 4. God by his speciall prouidence manifested that the pro∣per mother was the best nurse for a childe. 5. It is the note of a good woman to performe this part of her particular calling, namely to nurse her owne childe. 6. Women ought to doe all the best duties of loue that they can to their children. Therefore mothers ought to nurse their owne children. II. Some of the most worthy patternes, in whose example this dutie is commended to mothers, are these. 1. Sarah gaue sucke to Isaak. This example is to be noted Gen. 21. 7. especially of the greater sort: as rich mens wiues, honourable mens wiues, and the like. For Sarah was an honourable wo∣man, a princesse, a rich mans wife, a beautifull woman, aged and well growne in yeeres, and a mistresse of a family. Are not these excuses pretended by many mothers for not nursing children themselues? 2. The virgin Mary gaue sucke to Iesus. This example is to be noted especially of the meaner sort, for the virgin Man was young, poore, persecuted, forced to remoue and flie with her childe from countrie to countrie. Are not these excuses pretended by other mothers? These two patternes doe not only commend the duty, but also strippe all mothers that are negligent therein, of all excuse. To these may be added the examples of 1 Sam. 1. 22. Annah, of Psal. 22. 9. Da∣uids mother, and of many others. What if also I adde the exam∣ple of that true, naturall, affectionate mother who stood before Salomons throne to plead for her childe? she thus saith of her selfe, 1 King. 3. 21. I arose to giue my sonne sucke, &c. If this had not beene a good motherly dutie, she would not then and there haue pleaded it.
III. The places of Scripture which take this dutie for a matter granted, and for a ruled case, are such as these. 1. Where Sarah saith, Who would haue said to Abram that Gen. 21. 7. Sarah should haue giuen children sucke? In this phrase she set∣teth forth Gods blessing in giuing Abram a sonne by her. Now in that she expresseth the blessing vnder this phrase of giuing sucke, she taketh it for grant, that the mother which beareth children must giue them sucke. 2. Where Dauid saith, thou diddest make me hope vpon my Psal. 22. 9. mothers breasts, he doth not onely imply that his mother gaue him sucke, but by the phrase maketh it a ruled case that the childe which suckes must hang vpon the mothers breast. 3. Where Salomon saith, O that thou wert as my brother that Cant. 8. 1. sucked the breasts of my mother, he taketh if also for grant, that brothers and sisters, as they come out of the same wombe, so they should sucke the same breasts, euen the breasts of her out of whose wombe they came, their owne mothers breasts. 4. Where the woman said to Christ, Blessed is the wombe that Luk. 11. 27. bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked, she taketh it for grant (as it was an vsuall practise in those daies) that the aps of that woman, whose wombe beare him, gaue him Ipsa suggerit natura matri∣bus ipsis lactan∣dos esse suos foetus. Idoirco enim ani∣manti enixae lactis alimen∣tum omni prae∣buit▪ Sapiens verò etiam pro∣uidentia mam∣mas foeminis binas effinxit, &c. Plut. de Justit. lib. In ijs animanti∣bus quae lacte aluntur, omnis ferè cibus la∣ctescere incipit. Cic. de Nat. D. ucke. These arguments we haue from the light of Gods word: other we may haue from Gods workes and the light of nature, as 1. God hath giuen to women two breasts fit to containe nd hold milke: and nipples vnto them fit to haue milke drawne from them. Why are these thus giuen? to lay them rth for ostentation? There is no warrant for that in all Gods ord. They are directly giuen for the childs food that com∣meth out of the wombe; for till the childe be borne, there is o milke in the breasts: anon after it is borne, milke ordinari∣ floweth into the breasts: yea a great part of the meat which ey eat turneth into milke. They make this admirable worke f Gods prouidence to be in vaine, that drie vp this spring, d suffer not their children to partake of the benefit of it. 2. That nourishment whereon the childe fed in the mo∣ers wombe, and whereby it was there sustained, turneth into
milke, and commeth into the breasts when the childe com∣meth out of the wombe. Whence we may gather, that of all womens milke, that womans milke is fittest for the childe, out of whose wombe the childe came. 3. Together with the milke passeth some smacke of the Mater Bernardi liberos suos ali∣enis vberibus nutriendos com∣mittere refugie∣bat, quasi cum lacte materno materni quo∣dammodo boni infundens eis naturam. Guil. Abb. de vit. Bern. l. 1. c. 1. affection and disposition of the mother: which maketh mo∣thers to loue such children best as they haue giuen sucke vnto: yea and oft times such children as haue sucked their mothers breasts, loue their mothers best: yea we may obserue many who haue sucked others milke, to loue those nurses all the daies of their life. 4. Other things are nourished by the same that they are bred. The earth out of which plants grow, ministreth nourish∣ment to the said plants: trees that bring forth fruit yeeld sap to that fruit, whereby it groweth to ripenesse: vnreasonable crea∣tures, and among them the most sauage wilde beasts, as Tigers and Dragons, yea sea-monsters giue sucke to their young ones; whereupon the Prophet saith of women that giue not sucke Lam. 4. 3. to their Children, that they are more cruell then those sea∣monsters, Like the Ostriches in the wildernesse: for the cruell Ostrich, and the hatefull Cucco are the two kinde of creatures which are noted to leaue their young ones for others to nou∣rish; the Ostrich leaueth her eggs in the dust: the Cucco lea∣ueth hers in other birds nests. Other creatures (if nature afford them not milke and dugges, as to birds it doth not) feed their young ones other waies, yet by themselues. 5. Shall I adde another argument which daily experience confirmeth, namely Gods blessing vpon this motherly dutie: Matres maiore studio & cura nutrient, nempe ex ipsis visceri∣bus diligunt li∣beros suos. Cum nutrices vtpote quae mercedem ament, charita∣tem praebeant subditiciam. Plut. de Instit. lib. commonly such children as are nursed by their mothers, pro∣sper best. Mothers are most tender ouer them, and cannot in∣dure to let them lie crying out, without taking them vp. and stilling them; as nurses will let them crie and crie againe, if they be about any businesse of their owne. For who are com∣monly chosen to be nurses? euen poore countrie women which haue much worke to doe, and little helpe; and so are forced to let the childe lie and crie, many times till it burst againe. Children nursed by their mothers are for the most part more cleanly, and neatly brought vp, freer from diseases;
not so many die; I am sure not so many through negligence cast away. The number of nurse children that die euery yeere is very great. It hath beene obserued in many countrie villa∣ges, that the most part, that from time to time die there, are nurse children. Are not mothers that might haue nursed their owne children if they would, accessary to the death of those that are cast away by the nurses negligence? On these and other like reasons heathen women, and very Arist. Oecon. l. 2. c. 3. Plutarch. loc. citat. A. Gellius Noct. Attic. comment. li. 12. cap. 1. sauages, haue in all ages beene moued to nurse their owne chil∣dren: and some heathen Philosophers haue vrged and pressed the necessitie of this dutie. Neuer was it more neglected, then among those that beare the name of Christians. Let mothers know of what ranke or degree so euer they be, that (out of the case of necessitie) they haue no warrant to put forth their children to others to nurse. We read not in all the Scripture of any holy women that euer did it. §. 13. Of the obiections for putting children forth to nurse. Obiect. Many nurses are mentioned in Scripture, as Rebe∣kahs Gen. 24. 59. 2 Sam. 4. 4. 2 King. 11. 2. nurse, Mephibosheths nurse, Ioash his nurse, and others. 1. Answ. Such nurses mentioned in Scripture were com∣monly drie nurses. Rebekahs nurse went with her before she was maried: how can it be thought that she was a milch nurse? Could they tell when Rebekah should haue a childe? or when Gen. 35. 8. he had one, that Deborah (the nurse there mentioned) should haue milke for her? It is said that Naomi became nurse to Ruths Ruth 4. 16. & 1. 12. hilde: now Naomi was old, long before this she was past hild-bearing, without an husband for many yeeres: how then was it possible that she should giue sucke? She was therefore a rie nurse, as other nurses mentioned in Scripture. 2. Answ. The mothers of those children which are said to aue nurses (if those nurses were milch-nurses) might be ead: or if liuing, not able to giue sucke for want of milke, ipple, or for some other like defect: or if able, sinne in put∣ting forth their children. 3. Answ. Though it be said that there were nurses, yet is no where said, that a mother put forth her childe to sucke. 2. Obiect. Pharohs daughter put forth the childe which she Exod. 2. 7. oke for her owne to nurse.
Answ. She bare not this childe, nor was the naturall mo∣ther of it, so as this is nothing to the purpose. Yea it maketh against the obiectors, in that the true mother of this childe nur∣sed it. 3. Obiect. The metaphor taken from nurses is oft vsed, Num. 11. 12. 1 Thes. 2. 7. and applied to God, and to Gods ministers. 1. Answ. The vsing of a thing by way of comparison and resemblance doth not simply iustifie it: instance the parable of the vniust steward, and of a theefe. Luke 16. 1. &c. Reu. 15. 16. 2. Answ. The metaphor may be taken from a drie nurse as well as a milch nurse: for the comparisons are not vsed of giuing sucke, but of bearing and carrying in armes, as drie nur∣ses vse to carry children. 3. Answ. The metaphors are most fitly taken from mo∣thers that are nurses to their owne children. 4. Obiect. Many mothers haue not such skill in giuing sucke as nurses haue. Answ. Let them learne seeing it is their dutie. 5. Obiect. Mothers that are of great wealth and high place cannot endure the paine of nursing, nor take the paines in handling young children as they must be handled. 1. Answ. The greatest that be must set themselues to doe that duty which God requireth at their hands, though it be with paine and paines. Note Sarahs example before recor∣ded. 2. Answ. By this it appeareth, that if other women could beare their children in the wombe nine moneths, and endure the paine of trauell for them, they would hire them to doe it. But seeing they doe the one (namely beare and bring forth their owne children with hard labour) why should they not doe the other? If they say there is an vnauoidable necessity of bearing and bringing forth their children; I answer, that con∣science ought to moue them to nurse those children, which necessity forceth them to bring forth. God by this latter o nursing children maketh triall of women whether they will for conscience sake, doe that duty which they may if they will put off. But because God knew that many will doe no more then necessity laieth vpon them, he hath made it a matter o
impossibility for women to beare and bring forth their chil∣dren by another. 3. Answ. If women would with cheerefulnesse set them∣selues to performe this duty, much of the supposed paine and paines would be lessened. 4. Answ. Though they put not forth their children to nurse, they may for their ease entertaine a nurse, so they giue sucke themselues. 6. Obiect. A mother that hath a trade, or that hath the care of an house, will neglect much businesse by nursing her childe: and her husband will saue more by giuing halfe a crowne a weeke to a nurse, then if his wife gaue the childe sucke. Answ. No outward businesse appertaining to a mother can be more acceptable to God then the nursing of her childe: this is the most proper worke of her speciall calling, therefore all other businesses must giue place to this, and this must not be left for any other businesse. As for the husbands sauing by putting the childe forth to nurse, no gaine may giue a dispensation against a bounden duty. 7. Obiect. It will breake tender faire women, and make them looke old too soone. 1. Answ. Gods ordinance must not giue place to womens icenesse. Sarah was faire and old: The Virgin Mary was faire and young. 2. Answ. Drying vp a womans milke will more breake her, then her childes sucking of it: for it is a meanes both of better health, and also of greater strength, as to beare children, so to giue them sucke. Barren women and bearing women which put forth their children to sucke, are most subiect to sicknesse and weaknesse. The drawing forth of a womans milke by her childe is a meanes to get and preserue a good stomach, which is a great preseruatiue of good health. 8. Obiect. Husbands are disturbed in the night time, and hindred of their sleepe by their wiues giuing sucke to their children. 1. Answ. By this reason neither mothers nor other nurses
which haue husbands, should giue sucke to children. 2. Answ. Seeing children come from the loines of the fa∣ther, as well as out of the wombe of the mother, they must be content to endure some disturbance as well as their wiues, and so much the rather that they may the more pitty their wiues, and afford vnto them what helpe they can. 9. Obiect. Many husbands will not suffer their wiues to nurse their children themselues. Answ. Because it is a bounden duty, wiues must vse all the meanes they can by themselues or others to perswade their husbands to let them performe it: they must take heede that they make not this a pretext to couer their owne sloth, and lothnesse to this duty: they may not make themselues acces∣sarie to their husbands fault by prouiding a nurse, and sending the childe away themselues: if their husbands will stand vpon their authority, and be perswaded by no meanes to the con∣trary, they must be meere patients in suffering the childe to be taken away. 10. Obiect. Many poore women maintaine their house by nursing other folkes children. Answ. If they were not that way imployed, they might take paines in some other thing. But the gaine of one may not make another neglect her duty. 11. Obiect. Some mothers cannot giue sucke, they haue no milke: others cannot very well, in that they haue no nipples, or they haue sore breasts, or are sickly, or it may be that they haue such a disease, as the childe, if it should sucke of their milke, would draw to it selfe, and so the sucking might proue very dangerous to the childe. 1. Answ. God requireth no impossibilities: wherefore in pro∣pounding the duty I put in this caution (so far as they are able.) 2. God requireth mercie, and not sacrifice: if therefore in Hos. 6. 6. Matt. 9. 13. truth it be so that the mothers giuing sucke to the childe will be dangerous to her selfe or to the childe, she may and ought to forbeare: for giuing sucke is but as sacrifice to preuenting of danger, which is mercie. But women must take heed that they pretend not inability, and danger without iust cause. Some are themselues the cause of wanting milke because they
will not let it be drawne downe; or because they will not vse meanes (for meanes there are) to get and increase milke. There are meanes also to raise nipples where the breasts are very flat. Refusing to giue sucke many times causeth some sickish∣nesse in a woman, and sore breasts, which might be preuen∣ted with the childes sucking. If the forenesse be only in the nipples, a mother with enduring a little more paine may safely giue the childe sucke. Many mothers haue giuen their children sucke when bloud hath runne by the mouth of the childe by reason of sore nipples, and yet both mother and childe done very well. 12. Obiect. Diuers children being nursed by the mother haue died one after another. Answ. Due and thorow search must be made by those that are skilfull: and if any cause be found in the mother, then the rule holdeth, Mercy and not sacrifice: but if none can be found, the issue must be referred to Gods prouidence: and the vncertaine euen must not be an hinderance to a knowne dutie. Thus the answering of the forenamed obiections maketh the point so much the more cleere. §. 14. Of the fathers dutie in incouraging his wife to nurse her childe. The dutie which on a fathers part in this respect is required, is that he incourage his wife, and helpe her with all needfull things for the performance of this dutie. It is noted of Elka∣ah, that he suffered his wife to tarry at home while she gaue sucke to her sonne, and would not force her to goe vp to the tabernacle as his other wife did, but gaue her all the ease and content he could, saying to her, Doe what seemeth thee good. 1 Sam. 1. 23. And of Abraham it is noted, that after Sarah had done gi∣uing the childe sucke, he made a great feast, euen the day that Gen. 21. 8. Isaak was weined: one end whereof was to testifie his reioy∣cing for Gods blessing on her motherly dutie so well per∣formed. §. 15. Of the faults contrarie to a mothers nursing her childe. Contrary to this dutie doe all such mothers offend, as for
any by-respects when no necessity requireth put forth their children to be nursed by others. 1. Some doe it for ease and quiet, because they cannot en∣dure to haue their sleepe broken, or to heare their childe wrangle and crie. 2. Others doe it for nicenesse, because they are loth to open their breasts, or to soile their cloathes. 3. Others vpon pride, conceiting that their beauty would be impaired, and they looke old too soone. 4. Others vpon gaine, because they can haue a childe cheaper nursed abroad then at home, where, at least, they must hire a maid the more. 5. Others vpon pleasure, that they might more freely ride abroad, and meet their Gossips. 6. Others vpon other by-respects: all which doe argue much selfe-loue: little loue to their childe, and little respect to God. They can be counted but halfe-mothers: for nursing a childe is as much as bearing and bringing it forth. §. 16. Of a fathers fault in hindring his wiues nursing of her child. To the forenamed fault of mothers doe all such fathers make themselues accessary, as forbid their wiues to nurse their children, or are a griefe to them by their complaints of trouble, disquiet and expence: or afford not things need∣full, or doe not incourage them all they can to doe it. The mothers both paine and paines is the greatest: it is in comparison but a small thing that fathers can endure there∣in. Their fault therefore must needs be the greater, if any way they be an occasion of their childes putting forth to nurse: which I haue the rather noted, because husbands for the most part are the cause that their wiues nurse not their owne chil∣dren: and that partly by suffering, and partly by egging them on to put out their children. If husbands were willing that their wiues should performe this dutie, and would per∣swade and incourage them thereto, and afford them what helpes they could, where one mother now nurseth her childe, twenty would doe it. §. 17. Of parents ioynt care about their childrens Baptisme. There is a further dutie to be performed of parents to their
children euen in their infancy, and that is in regard of their spirituall good, which is this, Parents ought to procure that their children be rightly bapti∣zed in due season. This is indeed a common dutie appertaining to both pa∣rents, but most principally to the father, and that for two reasons. 1. The father is the chiefe and principall Gouernour, and hath the greatest charge: accordingly he ought to haue the greatest care euen in such matters as are common to both. 2. The mother at that time by reason of her trauell and de∣liuery is weake, and not in case to haue her head much trou∣bled with many cares; much lesse able her selfe to take order for such weighty matters. Only the husband is to make knowne to his wife (if she be not extraordinarily weake) what his purpose is concerning the place, time, manner, and other like circumstances of baptizing the childe, and to aduise with her about the name, witnesses, and such like points. And if the husband be too backward and negligent, the wife ought so farre as she is able to put him in minde of his dutie there∣in, and to stirre him vp by her selfe or some other to per∣forme it. §. 18. Of the reasons to moue parents to see their children baptized. That parents are bound to procure Baptisme for their chil∣dren these reasons declare. 1. The commandement of God concerning circumcising Veraciter con∣ijcere possu∣mus quid va∣leat in parvulis baptismi sacra∣mentum ex circumcisione, &c. Aug. de Bap. l. 5. c. 24. Gen. 21. 4. Luk. 1. 59. & 2. 21. Ios. 5. 5. hildren: in the roome whereof Baptisme succeedeth now nder the Gospell (Col. 2. 11, 12.) Gods commandement to his dutie was first giuen to Abraham: and that for himselfe nd all his posterity to obserue (Gen. 17. 10.) After this it was n the law laid downe as a positiue statute, Leu. 12. 3. 2. The practise of the Iewes in a faithfull and constant ob∣ruance of this ordinance: as of Abraham; of Zachary and lizabeth: of Ioseph and Mary, and many others. Obiect. The children which were borne in the wildernesse were not circumcised.
Answ. They had no abiding place in the wildernesse, but were euer and anon remouing: so as it would haue beene dan∣gerous for the children to haue beene circumcised: in that extraordinary case this rule tooke place, I will haue mercy and Mat. 12. 7. not sacrifice. 3. The practise of Christians, who beleeuing were them∣selues Act. 16. 15, 33. and their whole houshold baptized. Vnder whole hous∣hold children must needs be comprised. 4. Christs embracing and blessing such children as were Mat. 19. 13. brought to him: and rebuking those that would haue kept them from him. 5. The promise of God made to them: for seeing God is so Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. gratious as to extend his promise to our children: our care must be to procure the seale which God offereth for the con∣firmation of that promise. 6. The right they haue to Gods Kingdome. Baptisme is an Mat. 19. 14. euidence of that their right. It is parents duty to get them that euidence. If children haue iust title to any lands and re∣uenues, or to any earthly honours and dignities, parents will doe what they can to make that title sure vnto them euen in their infancy: much more carefull should they be to make that rich and glorious inheritance, which is in heauen reser∣ued for them, as sure vnto them as they can: now no better meanes for the effecting of this then Baptisme. 7. Their conception and birth in sinne. Children drew con∣tagion Psal. 51. 5. from their parents: therefore great reason it is that their parents should see them washed with the water of rege∣neration. 8. The comfort which from the performance of this dutie will arise to Christian parents, yea and to the children also themselues when they come to the age of vnderstanding. When parents behold the couenant of God surely sealed and confirmed to their children, they cannot (if at least they beare any loue to their children) but much reioyce therein. And it must needs also much comfort the childe when (being of vn∣derstanding) he shall know that from his infancy he hath ca∣ried the seale and pledge of his regeneration. 9. The constant continued custome of the true catholicke Consuetude ma∣tris Ecclesiae in
Church, which euer since the Apostles time hath afforded the baptizandis paruulis nequa∣quam spernenda est. Aug. de Gen. l. 10. c. 23. sacrament of baptisme to children. §. 19. Of Parents procuring their children to be rightly baptized. There being such forceable motiues to stirre vp parents to per∣forme the dutie, (which motiues shew it to be a weightie dutie) I will further shew how this dutie ought to be performed. Two things in childrens baptisme ought to be obserued. 1. That it be rightly done. 2. That it be seasonably done. In the right performance thereof, some things are necessarie, and some expedient. Things of necessitie are these especially: 1. That the childe be baptized by a Minister of the word. Matth. 28. 19. Ioh. 3. 5. 2. That it be baptized with the element of water: the only ele∣ment sanctified to this purpose. 3. That the forme prescribed by Christ (Matth. 28. 19.) be In Patrem, & in Filium, & in Spiritū Sanctū baptizamur, vt Trinitatis vnū appareat sacra∣mentum: sed in vno nomine quod intelligi∣tur Deu. Hier. in Eph. 4. vsed, In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost: whereby the vnitie of the Godhead, and trinitie of Per∣sons is plainly set forth. 4. That the proper rite be vsed of applying the water to the bodie of the childe, so as at least the face of the childe may be sprinkled therewith. Things of expediencie are, 1. That the childe be baptized in a publike place, where Gods people ordinarily meet together, being set apart for the worship and seruice of God. 2. That such a time be chosen out, as an assembly of Saints may be there present. These two circumstances are the rather to be obserued, because Baptisme is one of the solemne parts of Gods publike worship; a pledge of our incorporation into the bodie of Christ, and commu∣nion of his Saints, and therefore with the more solemnitie, (as a matter of great moment) before many witnesses, with the assi∣stance of the faithfull prayers of an assembly of Saints, to be per∣formed.
§. 20. Of Parents care to giue a fit name to their childe at his Baptisme. A third matter of great expediencie about a childs baptisme, is, that Parents be carefull in giuing a fit name. It belongeth to Parents to giue the name to their childe: for so Parents must giue the childs name. holy parents (whose patterne in Scripture is in this respect com∣mended vnto vs) haue done from time to time: and for their warrant to doe it, it is worthy to be noted, that when God was pleased to appoint a name to a childe, he gaue in charge to the Parent so to name him, saying to him, Gen. 17. 19. Matth. 1. 21. Luk. 1. 13. Thou shalt call his name thus and thus. It is also euident, that the time of Baptisme is the fittest time for giuing the name. Luk. 1. 59. & 2. 21. Vnder the Law, childrens names were gi∣uen at their Circumcision: and so vnder the Gospell it hath in all ages beene vsed: and that for these reasons. 1. That their names may be a testimonie of their baptisme. Why the name is giuen at baptisme. 2. That so oft as they heare their names, they may be put in minde of their baptisme. 3. That they might know how by name they are giuen to Christ to be his souldiers, and therefore there must be no starting from him. 4. That they may also be assured, that being baptized with wa∣ter and the spirit, by name they are registred in heauen. Now because names are so solemnly giuen, and of so good vse, Fit names to be giuen. most meet it is that fit names should be giuen to children. And for proofe hereof, let the names which in Scripture are recorded to be giuen by God himselfe, and by such holy men and women as were guided by his spirit, be obserued; and we shall finde them to be holy, sober, and fit names. For direction to parents in this dutie, I will set downe some sorts and kinds of names as be fit, and beseeming Christians. 1. Names which haue some good signification: and among them such as are warranted by the Scripture, as Iohn (the grace of God) Ionathan (the gift of God) Andrew (manly) Clement (meeke) Simeon (obedient) Hannah (gratious) Prudens (wise) and such like: that thus their name may stirre them vp to labour after the vertue signified thereby. 2. Names which haue in times before vs beene giuen to per∣sons
of good note, whose life is worthy our imitation, as Isaak, Dauid, Peter, Marie, Elizabeth, and such like: that the names may moue them to imitate those worthies. 3. Names of our owne ancestors and predecessors, to preserue a memorie of the familie: which appeareth to haue beene an anci∣ent practise euen among Gods people, in that the friends would haue had Zachariahs sonne named Zachariah; and when the Luk. 1. 59, &c. mother had iust cause to name him Iohn, they answer, none of thy kindred is called by this name. 4. Vsuall names of the country, which custome hath made fa∣miliar, as Henry, Edward, Robert, William, and such like among vs. §. 21. Of Parents care in bringing their children to be baptized in due season. Though Christians are not so strictly tied to a set day, as the Iewes were to the eight day; yet from that strict direction giuen to the Iewes, we may well gather, that it is not meet for Christians to defer the baptizing of their children beyond eight dayes: for a young childe of that age may with more ease, and lesse danger, be baptized, then circumcised. The most seasonable time I take to be the day whereon Gods Read the ru∣brick before the forme of administring Baptisme in our Common Prayer booke. people vse in the place where the childe is borne, publikely to assemble together to worship God next after the birth of the child, if at least it fall not out within two or three dayes after, which is somewhat with the soonest both for mother and childe. Whether we respect the honour of God (the riches of whose mercy is liuely set forth in the sacrament of baptisme) or the good of our childe (which in that sacrament receiueth a pledge and seale of that rich mercy of God) Baptisme is of great consequence: and therefore the first season of performing it to be taken. For parents by their diligence and due speed therein, giue euidence both of their zeale to Gods glory, and also of their earnest desire of the childs spirituall good. §. 22. Of Parents faults in neglecting their childrens Baptisme. Contrary to the forenamed dutie of Parents about well bapti∣zing their children, are many aberrations, as 1. The corrupt opinion of Anabaptists, who denie the lawful∣nesse of baptizing children. The arguments before noted are suffi∣cient to stop their mouthes.
2. The practise of Separatists (comming too neere to Anabap∣tisme) who excepting against the ministerie and orders of our Church, doe what they can to keepe their children from that Sa∣crament. And to that end carry their wiues ready to be deliuered vnto a strange place, where they are not knowne, and anon after they are deliuered, priuily conuey wife, childe, and all away, that so the Magistrate may not, against their will, cause their childe to be baptized: and hauing no ministerie of their owne, nor meanes to conuey the childe ouer sea, keepe it many yeeres vnbaptized. Where is the euidence of their faith in Gods promise, of their Christianorum filij si baptisma non receperint, scelus refertur ad eos qui dare noluerint: ma∣xime eo tempo∣re quo contra∣dicere non pote rant qui accep∣turi erant. Hier. ad Laet. respect to Gods ordinance, and of their desire of their childs spiri∣tuall good? Though it be a great wrong to children to be kept from baptisme, yet the sinne lieth on such parents as procure not baptisme for their children: especially at that age when their chil∣dren cannot gainsay it. 3. The peruerse opinion and practise of certaine ancient he∣retikes, who in stead of baptizing children with water, had them branded with an hot iron. They grounded their error on a false interpretation of this phrase (he shall baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire.) Seleuciani bap∣tismum in aqua non accipiunt. Aug. de Haer. 59. Chemnit. harm. Euang. cap. 16. Answ. 1. They erre in taking this word (fire) literally and pro∣perly, which was meant mystically and metaphorically. 2. They erre in applying that to the outward action of a Mini∣ster, which was meant of the inward operation of Christ. By this their misinterpretation they thwart the maine scope of him who first vsed that phrase, which was to manifest the difference betwixt Sine mysterio Trinitatis quic∣quid in vnam aut alteram per∣sonam accipitur imperfectum est. Hier. in Ioel. 2. all other Ministers and Christ Iesus. 4. The opinion and practise of those, who vse other formes of Baptisme, besides this, (In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost.) Their opinion and practise is grounded on certaine concise phrases vsed by the Apostles: such as these, Baptized in the name of Iesus Christ: In the name of the Lord: In Act. 2. 38. & 10. 48. & 19. 5. the name of the Lord Iesus, &c. Answ. Those phrases rather set forth the very substance and inward matter of Baptisme, then the forme thereof. 5. Their opinion and practise, who care not by whom their children are baptized, whether heretiques, idolaters, laicks, or wo∣men: Little doe they regard the comfort of conscience, and
strength of faith, that ariseth from this; that a lawfull Minister in Gods roome and name, as Gods ambassador, putteth the seale of God to his couenant. 6. The practise of those as (I know not vpon what nice∣nesse or state) must haue their children baptized at home in their priuate house. This manner of baptising taketh away much from the honour of that high ordinance, which ought to be done with all the seemly solemnitie that may be. 7. Their practise who bring their childe to Church to be baptised, accompanied only with the Midwife, and three witnesses. It were almost as good be baptised in a priuate house: for it is not the walls of the Church, but the assembly of Saints, that addeth to the honour of the Sacrament, and is most of all to be respected. 8. Their practise who vpon state, or for great witnesses, or such by-respects put off the baptising of their children longer then is meet, some, two or three weekes, some, two or three moneths, some longer: whereby they shew too light esteeme of this Sacrament, in that they preferre meere complementall circumstances before a matter of so great moment. God oft sheweth his iust indignation against such, in taking away their hildren vnbaptised before the time set downe by them for baptisme be come. 9. Their practise who care not what heathenish, idolatrous, Lasciua nomina paruulis bapti∣zandis impo∣nenda non sant. Ioh. de Bur. idiculous names they giue to their children. What respect oe they shew either to God in whose name their childe is aptised, or to the holy Sacrament it selfe, or to the congrega∣ion of Saints before whom the name is giuen, or to the childe  selfe who all his life is to carrie that name? §. 23. Of parents prouiding things needfull for the life and health of their children. Hitherto of the duties of parents respecting their childrens Infancie. Such as respect their childhood follow. The childhood of a childe is eckoned from the time that it eginneth to be of any discreti∣on and vnderstanding till it be t to be placed forth: euen so Many distinguish the whole course of a mans life into foure parts. 1. Childhood 2. Youth. 3. Man-age 4. Old-age.
long as ordinarily it liueth vn∣der the parents gouernment. The duties which parents for this time must performe to their children may be drawne to these two heads. 1. Care to bring them vp. 2. Care to place them forth. For their well training vp, re∣spect must be had both to their temporall and also to their spiri∣tuall good. Two things are required of parents, in regard of the tempo∣rall good of their children. 1. To nourish them well. 2. To nurture them well. Children must be well Fed. Taught.   Child-hood from his birth to 14. yeeres. Youth from 14 to 25. Man-age from 25. to 50. Old age from thence to his death. But for better distingui∣shing the duties which pa∣rents are to performe, I fol∣low not so accurate a diuisi∣on, but rather distinguish the degrees of age accor∣ding to the times wherein new duties are to be per∣formed: and therefore I make a distinction be∣twixt infancie and child∣hood. Feed them in discipline, saith the Apostle. Vnder nourishment are comprised all needfull things for . In prole attendi∣tur vt amanter suscipiatur, be∣nignè nutria∣tur, religiosè educetur. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. l. 9. c. 7. Refectionis tem∣pus, & mensu∣ra, & qualit as pueris compe∣tenter discer∣nantur. Basil. Ascet. c. 15. health and life: which parents ought to prouide for their children, as 1. Food, which Christ taketh for a ruled case. Whence he draweth his argument to shew that God will prouide for his children. What father (saith he) if his sonne aske him bread would giue him a stone, &c. Mat. 7. 9, 10, 11. 2. Apparell, for it is expresly noted, that Israel made his son a coat, (Gen. 37. 3.) 3. Recreation, which in young children especially is need∣full for their health. In that Zachary chap. 8. vers. 5. told the Iewes, and that in way of blessing, that boyes and girles should be playing in the streets, he implieth that it is a lawfull and meet thing, which parents should permit vnto their children. But yet the time, and measure, and kinde of recreation must be well ordered. 4. Meanes for recouery of health when they are sicke: for this end was it, that 1 King. 14. 2. Ieroboam sent his wife to the Prophet,
in behalfe of his sonne who was sicke: that Ioh. 4. 47. the Ruler came to Christ for his sonne also who was at point of death; and that many others came to him for their sonnes and daughters being ill. Whatsoeuer other things are needfull, parents to their po∣wer 1 Tim. 5. 8. must prouide for their children: else the Apostle counteth them worse then Infidels. Both equitie and necessitie require thus much of parents. Equitie, in that children owe all their paines and seruice to their parents while they are vnder them, and are wholly at their command, and in that regard haue no meanes to prouide needfull things but by their parents helpe. Parents therefore in all right must herein be helpfull to them. Necessitie, in that, if the life and health of children be not well prouided for, no dutie, no seruice can be expected at their hands. §. 24. Of parents too much niggardlinesse, and carelesnesse to∣ward their children. There are two extremes contrary to the forenamed proui∣dent 1. Contrary, Couetousnesse Non est boni parentis qucm procrearit, & eduxerit, cum non & vestire & ornare. Cic. de Orat. Nonne ipsae ferae foetus suos arctissimè a∣mant? Nihilne fando de pardis, apris, boum{que} armentis au∣dijsti, quanto cum tremore eorum saluti consulant? Greg. Naz. ad Ueial. care of parents for their childrens good: In the defect, Couetousnesse. In the excesse, Lauishnesse. Some parents so farre faile in the defect, as they almost starue their children through want of necessaries: not affording them sufficient wholesome food, nor meet and comely appa∣ell, but suffer them to goe tagged and ragged like beggars rats: if they be sicke, God may recouer them if he please, but the parents will vse no meanes when they are well, they afford them no time of refreshing themselues by any recreation, but uer-strictly hold them in. There is not only want of charity, ut plaine vnnaturalnesse in such parents: euen more then in e most cruell beasts. For the wilde beasts doe with much ten∣ernesse prouide for their young ones. §. 25. Of parents too much lauishnesse and indulgency vpon their children. Others surpasse as much in the excesse, feeding them too intily: attiring them too garishly: tending them too
cockeringly: and letting them spend too much time in sport and play. Many and great are the mischiefes that follow there∣upon: as 1. They who are in their childhood daintily fed, and too much pampered, besides that for the most part they are most sickly, they will in time grow so squeamish, and choice of meats, as their parents shall not know what to prouide for them, or when to giue it them: The full soule loatheth an hony Pro. 27. 7. combe: yea if a stranger commeth to the table, where such a childe sitteth, he may soone obserue that he hath beene too daintily fed. If at first children be fed with ordinary moderate diet, they will afterwards both be in better health and liking, and also more contentedly, and thankfully accept whatsoe∣uer shall be prouided for them. But excesse breedeth diseases both in body and minde. 2. Vanity in apparell doth also much corrupt young chil∣dren: for there is in them euen from the cradle a naturall dis∣position to outward brauery: now for parents to pranke them vp, what is it but to blow vp the fire of that vanity, and make it arise into such a flame as in time may much scorch the pa∣rents themselues, and vtterly consume the children: and yet how vsuall a fault is this? how monstrously doe many parents offend therein? what foolish fashion is vsed of the greatest swaggerers, and lightest strumpets, which they will not bring their children vnto, and that when their children are not able to discerne betwixt stuffes or colours? what can this proclaime but parents pride and folly? Proud maids are many times the instruments of pranking vp children (especially when they are little ones) more then is meet: but yet the blame lieth on parents for suffering it. 3. Tending children too cockishly maketh them too long children, and too tender: and oft altereth a good constitution of body. Some are so ouer-much tender of their children, as if a childe neuer so little complaine, or refuse the meate (though for daintinesse or fulnesse) the Physician must pre∣sently be sent for, and the Apothecary sent vnto, and the childe with supposed and apish kindnesse made much worse. 4. Too much sport maketh them wilde, rude, vnfit to be
trained vp to any good calling, and spendeth their spirits, and wasteth their strength too much. Yet many parents care not how much time their children spend in sport, and how little in learning: they thinke it duls their children too much to be held to schoole, or to any learning: whereas indeed too much play infatuates them more, and learning would much sharpen their wits. §. 26. Of well nurturing children. I referre good nurture in part to the temporall good of chil∣dren, because (as afterwards we shall heare in the particulars) it is an especiall meanes of the outward temporall welfare of the childe euen in this world. Vnlesse this be added to nou∣rishing, wherein doe reasonable men and women exceed vnrea∣sonable beasts? the most cruell beasts that be are very tender (as we heard before) towards their young ones, nourishing them, and prouiding all things needfull for them till they can shift for themselues. But as God hath giuen to man a reasona∣ble soule, an vnderstanding head, capacity, docility and apt∣nesse to learne, so ought parents to make vse of those parts and gifts, lest for want of vsing them, in time they be lost: and so children proue little better then bruits. In this respect the pro∣uerbe is true, better be vnfed then vntaught. Experience shew∣eth that good education is better then a great portion. The Holy Ghost doth very much presse this point on parents, as we shall after heare in the particulars. For I will handle these three points. 1. The kindes of nurture. 2. The time when it is to be done. 3. The meanes of well doing it. §. 27. Of parents neglect in nurturing children. Contrary to good nurture is too much liberty: which oft bringeth much woe, and vtter ruine vpon children: it is the greatest enemy that can be of good education, and the nurse of all vice Yet many parents care not to let their children liue as they list: all the care they take, is that they be fed and ap∣parelled. This is a common fault both of rich, and of poore parents. The rich pretend that their children need no educa∣tion, because they haue enough to leaue them: not knowing
that education is an especiall meanes to make them keepe and well vse that enough. The poore pretend that they are not able to bring vp their children to any thing: not considering that the Lord by his prouidence hath so ordered the affaires of men, that as there are fit imployments for the greatest, so also Si parentum in∣curia filij in in∣temperantiam labentur, genito∣res rei anima∣rum illarum fient. Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 11. I. The kinds of nurture. for the meanest, which without much cost may be vsed. The fault therefore wholly resteth in the negligence of parents. And if thereupon children fall into any riot, their parents shall answer for it. §. 28. Of parents teaching their children good manners. The nurturing of children before mentioned consisteth 1. In teaching them good manners. 2. In training them vp to a good calling. Not only heathen men, and other moralists which were but meere naturall ciuill men, but also the Holy Ghost himselfe hath prescribed many rules of good manners, and much vr∣ged and pressed the same. 1. The word . See Treat. 1. §. 110. nurture mentioned by the Apostle in this text which we haue in hand, implieth as much: and the phrase which Solomon vseth, Pro. 22. 6. Traine vp a childe in the way he should goe: that is, teach him how to order the course of his life. 2. The many Leu. 19. 32. Pro. 25. 6. Luke 14. 8. precepts of reuerencing our superiours, and carying our selues with respect one to another, are rules of good manners. Hereof there be very many in scripture. 3. Those rules are Gen. 23. 7. & 43. 33. Iob 32. 4, 6. commended by many examples of ho∣ly men recorded in Scripture. 4. Such as haue Iob 30. 1, 12. Luke 14. 7. failed in the rules of good manners, and rudely carried themselues, are reproued by the Holy Ghost. Neither is it without good reason that this point is so set forth. For 1. Good manners are a very comely and seemely thing. But 1. Cor. 14. 40. it beseemeth Christians to doe all things decently. That decency is not only to be applied to the affaires of Gods Church, but also to the whole course of our life, in which respect we are commanded to walke . Rom 13. 13. 1 Thes. 4. 12. decently, that is, to order all our actions and the whole course of our life mannerly. 2. They are a thing of good report, and that both to parents and children: Now we must doe all things that are of good report. Phil. 4. 8.
3. They worke a kinde of delight, and loue, and admirati∣on, in those that behold them, as is noted of the Queene of 1 King. 10. 5. Sheba when she beheld the comely cariage of Solomons ser∣uants: and of the Egyptians when they beheld the orderly Gen. 43. 33. sitting of Iosephs brethren. 4. They are an outward ornament to piety and religion, and make it to be much more respected: in which respect S. Peter exhorteth beleeuing wiues well to order their conuer∣sation 1 Pet. 3. 1. before infidell husbands: and S. Paul exhorteth all sorts of christians to walke decently toward them that are without. 1 Thes. 4. 12. The Holy Ghost hauing thus vrged the point of good man∣ners, we may not thinke it a meere complementall matter, and a needlesse point, but a bounden duty. §. 29. Of the obiections against good manners. 1. Obiect. Religion and grace consisteth not in good man∣ners: many that haue not a sparke of Gods feare in their hearts, are able to carry themselues in their outward behauiour very orderly and mannerly. Answ. Though grace consist not wholly in it, yet cannot grace well be without it: it is a great ornament and comeli∣nesse thereunto. And though mannerlinesse may be seuered from a feare of God, yet Gods feare will not be seuered from it. Restraining grace may be in him who hath no renewing grace: but renewing grace presupposeth restraining grace, euen as reason presupposeth sense, though sense may be without rea∣son. If such as feare not God can carry themselues comely and mannerly, what a shame is it for such as seeme to feare God, not to doe so? shall not those be a witnesse against these? 2. Obiect. Good manners are an hinderance to grace: they who are most diligent in teaching or practising the one, are commonly most negligent in the other. Answ. This is a meere cauill. Sure I am that grace is no hin∣derance to good manners. If any make good manners an hin∣derance to grace, it is their fault. 3. Obiect. Good manners to grace are as mint, annise and cummin, to the great and weighty things of the law. Answ. Grant it to be so: yet seeing both may stand toge∣ther, why should they be seuered? Christs rule is this, These
things ought ye to haue done, and not to leaue the other vndone. Matt. 23. 23. 4. Obiect. Many that make great shew of religion are very rude, and vnmannerly. Answ. If there be onely a shew of religion in them, no mar∣uell that they haue no manners. If some examples of such as are truly religious and want good manners should be shewed, their patterne is no president, much lesse can it proue that to be no duty which Gods word hath set downe for a duty. Many that well performe some duties, much faile in other duties. Who almost followeth Gods word as he should in euery thing? §. 30. Of parents suffering their children to be rudely brought vp. Contrary to parents care in teaching their children good manners, is dissolutenesse: when parents suffer their children to grow vp in rudenesse, not caring how they carry themselues at home or abroad, toward their parents, or toward others. Rude bringing vp maketh children to be of a crooked, per∣uerse, stubborne, churlish, furly, doggish disposition; as on the other side, good nurture in this kinde breedeth in genuity, amiablenesse, curtesie, and kindnesse. If such as are rudely brought vp be children of professors of the true religion, they bring a staine vpon their profession: yea they dishonour God, as if he were the author of vnmannerlinesse and confusion, against which the Holy Ghost protesteth: and they make 1 Cor. 14. 33. themselues and their children a scorne in the eie and mouth of profane persons, who will be ready to point and say, Behold the children of professors, how rudely they are brought vp, and ill taught: they haue not so much as good manners in them. For auoiding this blemish, Schoole-masters and all such as Admonition to Schoole∣masters. haue the charge of trayning vp young children, must bean helpe to parents in teaching children good manners. §. 31. Of parents training vp their children to some good calling. The second branch of good nurture is a training vp of chil∣dren vnto a good calling. This charge (traine vp a child in Pro 22. 6. the way that he should go) directly condeth to this purpose. This duty hath from the beginning of the world beene per∣formed
by parents, and their performance thereof commen∣ded by the holy Ghost. Adam brought vp his sonnes to se∣uerall callings: one was a Gen. 4. 2. keeper of sheepe, another a tiller of ground. The like is noted of Gen. 37. 12. Iaakobs sonnes, Gen. 29. 9. Labans, and Exo. 2. 16. Reguels daughters, 1 Sam. 16. 7. Ishas sonne, and many others. Much good may from hence arise to parents themselues, to their children, and to the people and places where such chil∣dren Benefits of a good calling. shall liue. 1. A good calling is an especiall meanes for children to maintaine themselues and family, to releeue those that stand in need, to ease their parents, and (if the need of parents require it) to releeue and maintaine them. 2. It is that way wherein Gods Angels haue a charge to Psal. 91. 11. keepe them while they walke in it. 3. It is a meanes wherein and whereby they may be ser∣uiceable to the common wealth where they liue. 4. It is the best place wherein the generall duties of Chri∣stianity may be most manifested, and best performed. 5. It is the best ordinary meanes that can be prescribed to keepe a childe from the vanities of youth, from immoderate pursuit of pleasures, from vnlawfull games, from idlenesse, from ill company, and such like euils; which, as they are sinnes in themselues, so occasions and prouocations to other most grieuous and enormous sinnes, and proue to be the very bane of youth. Obiect. Many parents haue good lands to leaue to their chil∣dren: what need is there of a calling to such? Answ. 1. Much land may soone be consumed by such as haue not skill well to vse it. 2. Maintenance is but one end of a calling, and that not the chiefest and most principall. 3. More good may be done by skill in a calling, then by great store of land. 4. We are borne for others as well as for our selues: it is not therefore sufficient to say I haue enough to maintaine my selfe.
§. 32. Of parents care in choosing a fit calling for their children. The point in generall being declared to be a dutie, I will Directions for choise of cal∣lings. 1. Generall principles are to be taught. adde some directions for the better performing of it. 1. Children are to be trained vp in those things which are the ground worke of all callings, as reading, writing, and prin∣ciples of learning. Whatsoeuer the particular calling be, these will be of great vse to any one. Many that haue not beene taught them at first, would giue much for them afterwards. Parents at the first might teach their children those things with much ease and small charge, which afterwards cannot be Non sunt con∣temnenda quasi parua, sine quibus magna constare non possunt. Hier. ad Laet. 2. The calling must be law∣full. so well learned, partly for want of leasure, and partly because the parts of those who are growne in yeares are not so fresh and fit to learne, as in child-hood they were. Those things are not to be contemned as small, without which great things cannot stand. 2. The calling whereunto children are trained vp must be lawfull, approued by Gods word, and not against the generall rules thereof: so may they keepe a good conscience in the ex∣ercise thereof. 3. The calling must be fit for the childe that is trained vp 3. The calling must be fit for the childes ability. to it. As there are diuers callings, so there are diuers abilities of sundry children: some are fittest for callings of wit and lear∣ning: others for callings that require an able and strong body. Wherein the wise disposing prouidence of God is much com∣mended: for thus are men much more vsefull one to another. Now for choise of a fit calling, a childs best ability wherein especially it consisteth, whether in the exercise of minde or of body, is duly to be obserued: and also his inclination, to what calling he is most disposed. 4. Among fit callings (for there may be many) that which 4. The best callings must be preferred. 1 Cor. 12. 31. is best and the most excellent is to be preferred. To this pur∣pose not vnfitly may I apply that of the Apostle, ccuet earnestly the best gifts. On this ground let parents be exhorted to traine vp such Children to be trained vp to the mini∣stery. children as they finde fit, to the great and weighty calling of the ministery: no calling wherein any may doe more good, and wherein (if they be able and faithfull Ministers) they can
receiue more comfort and contentment. This exhortation is the more to be regarded, because in comparison of those who are trained vp to other callings, so few are trained vp to this. § 33. Of parents faults contrary to their dutie of training their children vp to a calling. On the contrary, many parents much offend in not trai∣ning vp their children to a calling as they should. And the offence in this kinde is committed many waies. As 1. When parents suffer their children to liue like little ma∣sters at home, and passe ouer all their youth in idlenesse. Thus they proue very drones, and caterpillars in the common wealth: if they haue a patrimony, they soone waste it: if they haue none, they oft proue either theeues or beggars: they are fit for all companies: the readiest prey for the deuill that can be: for they are like the house empty, swept and garnished, which Mat. 12. 44. when the euill spirit espieth, he presently entereth into it with seuen other spirits worse then himselfe. The wise law-maker among the heathen is said to order Solon legibus cauisse legitur, vt filius, quem parentes nullam artem docuis∣sent, non coge∣retur illos alere senio confectos, aut ad inopiam redactos. Eras. Instit. Matrim. that the childe which by his parents had beene taught no Art, should not be forced to nourish them though they were old or poore. This I all eage not to iustifie the law (for it is against the Christian rule of ouercomming euill with goodnesse) but to shew how the very heathen iudged the neglect of this dutie a great fault in parents. 2. When parents neglect to teach their children in their child-hood the generall and common grounds of all callings: some vpon niggardlinesse; others vpon carelesnesse. Thus poore men make their children vnfit for many meanes, where∣by they might well maintaine themselues: and rich men make theirs vnfit for magistracy, and for good society. Yea poore and rich are thus nousled vp the more in ignorance, and made the more vnfit to profit by the preaching of the word, and other meanes of spirituall edification. 3. When parents bring vp their children in vnwarranta∣ble and vnlawfull callings, as to be of popish and idolatrous orders; to attend vpon papists; to be stage-plaiers, keepers of dice-houses, &c. Some (which is horrible to thinke of) traine
vp their daughters to be common strumpets: and some Phoenices Ve∣neri donum dabant de pro∣stitatione filia∣rum, antequam iungerent eas viris. Aug de Ciu. D. l. 4 c. 10. vide Lud. Uiu. in hunc loc. Recte dicuntur parentes filios daemoniorum sacrilegijs ob∣ligare conantes, spir taliter ho∣micidae. Aug. Epist. 23. (which is yet more horrible) traine vp their children to be sor∣cerers and witches. How can they in these keepe a good con∣science, when the very workes of their calling are sinne? Is not this to thrust them headlong into hell? They who thus binde their children to the deuils sacrileges are spirituall murtherers of them. 4. When parents haue no respect at all to the fitnesse of the calling: as when they traine vp children of able bodies, but dull and slow capacity, of a stuttering tongue and other like imperfections, to learning, wherein they proue very dunces, and lose all their time, or are not able to make vse of the lear∣ning which they haue: or when they traine vp children which haue a great inclination to learning, and are very fit thereunto, in some other trade, which, after many yeeres speut therein, they are forced to leaue. 5. When parents only seeke after the most gainfull trade, and neuer thinke to educate their children most to the ho∣nour of God. How can such expect Gods blessing vpon the meanes vsed for their childrens good? Hence is it that among Papists so many are trained vp to Ecclesiasticall orders and functions: and so few among Protestants. For there is very great maintenance and reuenues for such among Papists: but little in comparison among Protestants: Infans tibi est? ab infantia sanctitate im∣buatur: abipsis vnguiculis Spi∣ritui consecre tur. Greg. Naz. Orat. 40. in S. Bapt. Lege Hier. Epist. ad Laet. §. 34. Of parents teaching their children piety. The spirituall good of children, and that in their child∣hood, is to be procured by parents as well as their temporall. Wherefore Parents must traine vp their children in true piety. This is expresly commanded in my text vnder this phrase ad∣monition of the Lord. Vnder the law God did both sim∣ply Deut. 4. 9. & 6. 7 & 11. 19. Psal. 78. 5, 6. command it, and that very often, and also ordained diuers outward Exo. 12 26. & 13. 14. rites, and caused many visible and extraor∣dinary Ios 4. 6, 7, 21. monuments to be set vp, that thereby children might be occasioned to aske of their parents the mysterie of them, and that parents from that inquirie of their chil∣dren might take occasion to Deul. 6. 20. teach them the ordinances of the Lord.
This expresse charge of the Lord is further commended by that practise which holy parents from time to time haue yeelded thereunto: instance the examples of Gen. 18. 19. Abraham, Pro. 4 4. Dauid, & 31. 1. Bath∣sheba, 2 Tim. 1. 5. Reasons. 1. Benefit of pietie. Lois and Eunice, with many others. 1. Pietie is the best thing that a parent can teach his childe: for as reason maketh a man differ from a beast; and as learning and ciuilitie maketh a wise and sober man differ from sauages and swaggerers; so pietie maketh a sound Christian much more to differ from the most ciuill and well ordered naturall man that can be. Learning, ciuilitie, calling, portion, are all nothing without pietie. Now it is an especiall point of wisdome, to seeke the best good that we can, as for our selues, so also for our children: yea this is an euident signe of a parents true loue of his childe. 2. There is a necessitie that children be taught pietie, because 2. Necessitie of pietie. Fiunt non nas∣cuntur Christia∣ni. Hier. ad Laet. they are not borne but made Christians: by nature they are vt∣terly destitute of all pietie: for by nature euery imagination of the thoughts of mans heart is only euill continually (Gen. 6. 5.) and in that respect man is borne like the wilde asse colt (Iob 11. 12.) so as a man were better be vnborne then not taught pietie. 3. The charge and office of parents bindeth them to teach their 3. Charge of parents. children pietie: for they are by God made watchmen ouer their children: if therefore their children liue and die in impietie through their parents negligence, their bloud shall be required at their parents hands: instance the example of 1 Sam. 3. 13. Elie. Obiect. This dutie appertaineth to Ministers. Why Parents as well as Mi∣nisters are bourd to teach pietie. Answ. 1. God hath giuen an expresse charge hereof to parents, as we heard before. 2. In the familie a parent is all in all ouer his childe: a King, a Priest, and a Prophet. Therefore that which a Minister is to doe for matter of instruction in the Church, a parent must do at home. 3 Children haue need of daily instruction: the parents paines in this kinde must be added to the Ministers: and both are little enough. 4. Parents hauing more familiaritie with their children then Ministers, must needs better know their capacitie, and their dispo∣sition: and so may better know after what manner to instruct them: whether to giue them milke or strong meat, whether to deale mildly or roughly with them.
5. Instructions from parents are commonly more kindly ac∣cepted then from others: and children will the better rellish them, when they come from their parents. They say that a plant will best grow in the soile out of which it first sprung: so instru∣ctions comming from those who both brought vs forth, and first brought vs vp, are like to doe most good. 6. There is no such meanes to breed loue in a childs heart, as to be an instrument of bringing piety thereinto. Now who should more seeke the true loue of a childe then a parent? In this respect a parent is more bound to this dutie then a Minister. 7. It is impossible, that a Minister, who, it may be, hath many hundred children vnder his charge, should well instruct them all: It is therefore requisite, that each parent looke to his owne children. As these distinct answers satisfie the obiection, so they serue as so many more reasons to inforce the dutie: wherefore to proceed in adding other reasons, 4. Great equitie there is that parents teach their children piety, 4. Equitie. because they Psal. 51. 5. conceiued and brought them forth in iniquitie. If they suffer them to lie and die in that corrupt estate, they are more cruell then the Ostrich and Dragon. 5. Children are most properly Gods: Ezec. 16. 20, 21. borne to God: he is the 5. Gods chil∣dren. most proper parent of them: in comparison of God, fathers and mothers of the flesh are but nurses. They must therefore nurture them in the admonition of the Lord. 6. Pietie is that, which of all other things, will make the childe 6. Cause of obedience. most obedient, and gratefull to his parents: for thus there is a double bond to binde him: 1. his birth. 2. his new birth: espe∣cially when the cause of the one hath beene also the cause of the other. 7. Nothing can more settle the heart of a wise parent on his 7. Comfort of parents on their death∣bed. death-bed concerning his children, then assurance that pietie is planted in them: for then may he with stronger confidence com∣mend them to Gods prouidence, and with greater assurance ex∣pect his blessing vpon them after he is dead. 8. Parents, by teaching their children pietie, are an especiall 8. Propagation of pietie. meanes of propagating true religion from age to age, and from generation to generation. No better meanes can be thought of.
For if all parents were carefull of their dutie in this kinde, as there is a succession of children, and thereby a preseruation of man∣kinde, so there would be a succession of those that feare God, and thereby a preseruation of true religion. My children that are taught by me, may be fathers of children, and so teach that to their chil∣dren, which they haue learned of me: yea after them may grand∣children proue fathers of other children, and they teach their chil∣dren the same, and so from age to age others after them. This is the meanes on our part: and in our time we must doe our part: and for those who come after vs, leaue the issue to God. Not only the great benefit of this point, but also the too much neglect thereof, in most families, hath moued me the longer to insist on it, and the more forcibly to presse it. For the better per∣forming thereof, I will adde some directions. §. 35. Of directing parents how to teach their children true pietie. 1. Whatsoeuer principle of pietie, parents doe teach their chil∣dren, 1. Principles of pietie to be all taken out of Gods word. they must be sure that it be grounded on Gods word: thus much this phrase (admonition of the Lord) implieth. Thus shall parents be sure to feed them with good wholesome spirituall food, such as shall make to their spirituall nourishment, and eternall life. In this respect principles of religion grounded on Gods word are called sound, or wholsome, or healthfull words: 2 Tim. 1. 13. . and that both in regard of their matter and substance, and also in regard of their effect; they cause and preserue good, sound, spiri∣tuall health. We know that naturall men haue a care to giue their children such food as is wholsome for their bodie: (for will a fa∣ther Mat. 7. 9, 10, 11. that is euill, giue his childe a stone, or a serpent, and not that which is good?) Conscience must moue religious parents, to haue the like care of the soules of their children, as nature teacheth all parents to haue of their bodies. If parents be carefull to draw those principles, wherein they instruct their children, out of Gods word, they shall be sure not to poyson their soules with any error, heresie, superstition, or idolatrie. 2. When children begin to read, let them read the holy Scrip∣ture: 2. Let children at first read the Scripture. so was Timothie trained vp from a childe (2 Tim. 3. 15.) Thus will children sucke in religion with learning: for there is a secret vertue lurking in the holy Scripture (which is Gods owne
word) more then in any bookes of men: so as through Gods Sacrae Scrip∣turae nominibus vtantur, & loco fabularum se∣lectae illis histo∣riae narrentur, & sententijs prouerbialibus ex Solomone in∣stituantur. Basil. Ascet. c. 15. 3 Catechise children daily. Deut. 6. 7. blessing there may by this meanes be an inward worke of grace in children euen in their young yeeres. Besides, no bookes are more easie then many parts of Scripture; and no histories more admi∣rable and delightfull, then the histories of the Scripture. It is the aduice of an ancient Father, that young children be made acquain∣ted with the words and names of holy Scripture: and that, in stead of tales and fables, choice histories of the Bible be made knowne to them: and that they be instructed in the Prouerbs of Solomon. 3. Let children be catechised constantly from day to day: re∣hearse them continually vnto thy children, saith the Law. That which is daily done, is in Scripture said to be done continually: as the sacrifice which was daily offered was called a continuall offe∣ring. Here let this caueat be noted, that in giuing this spirituall food, parents deale with their children, as skilfull nurses and mo∣thers doe in feeding infants: they will not at once cram more into their mouthes, then their stomach is able to digest, but they will rather oft feed them with a little: so it is not meet, that parents be too tedious; that will but dull a childs vnderstanding, and breed wearisomnesse, and make it loath to be againe instructed: but pre∣cept vpon precept, precept vpon precept, line vpon line, line vpon line, Isa. 28. 10. here a little, and there a little. Thus shall they learne with case and delight: and this being oft performed, in time a great measure of knowledge will be gained thereby. If a vessell haue a little mouth, we vse not to fill it by powring whole paile-fuls vpon it, for so all may be spilt, and it receiue little or nothing: but we let the liquor fall in by little and little, according to the capacitie of the mouth; so is nothing lost, and the vessell filled the sooner. Thus are chil∣dren to be dealt withall. 4. To the set times of catechizing children, let other occasions 4. Take all oc∣casions from sensible things to make a spi∣rituall vse. of teaching them pietie be added: as at table, by resembling the spirituall food of their soules, to that corporall food, whereby their bodies are nourished: when they are walking abroad, by shewing them the starres, how they remaine stedfast in their course; the trees, how they bring forth fruit in their season; how all things are for the vse and benefit of man, and thereupon make spirituall vses: note the direction which for this purpose the Law giueth to parents, Thou shall talke to thy children of my words, Deut. 6. 7.
when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest downe, and when thou risest vp. 5. Let parents open to their children the mysteries of those 5. Open the mysteries of the rites of the Church. Exo. 12. 26. & 13. 14. outward rites which God hath ordained in his Church, as of Preaching, Baptising children, administring the Lords Supper, ceasing from worke on the Lords day, with the like. This was expresly commanded vnder the law. Visible rites are great helpes to the weake vnderstanding of children, when they are plainly opened and applied: yea they are also especiall meanes of keeping in memory the mysteries contained vnder them: as course threds or wiars are meanes to preserue pearles put vpon them. So oft as they see the rites they will be put in minde of the mysteries implied vnder them. 6. To this may be referred a declaration of such great and 6. Let Gods great workes be declared. admirable workes as God in former times hath done for his Church: especially such workes as haue beene done in their time: and if any memorials be remaining of them, make them knowne to children. This direction was also giuen vn∣der Jos. 4. 6, 21. the law, concerning the monuments which were set vp of the great deliuerances that God gaue to his people. In parti∣cular when the day of the gunpowder-treason is solemnized, parents ought to teach their children the occasion of solemni∣ing that day. And as God doth any great workes of mercy r of iudgement, point them out to children. When there is great famine, plague, or any mortality, instruct children in he causes thereof: when victory, plenty, peace, or the like, ach children from whence these come. Outward sensible things doe best worke vpon children. 7. Let religious schoole masters be chosen for children: so∣ewise 7. Let religious masters be chosen. other masters to whom children are put forth: and religious houses where they are placed. Hannah commended er first borne childe to old Eli, a good, religious high Priest. 1 Sam. 1. 25. Magister probae aetatis, & vitae, at{que} eruditionis est eligendus. Hier. ad Laet.  masters themselues be religious, there is good hope that they will instruct in piety such as are vnder them: which if they oe, what an helpe will that be to parents? If both parents and masters ioyne therein, it must needs be very profitable to e children. If parents should faile, yet might masters make a ood supply.
8. Let parents be to their children a good patterne and ex∣ample 8. Be an ex∣ample. in pietie. I and my house (saith Ios. 24. 15. Iosua) will serue the Lord: he setteth himselfe first as a guide to the rest. Psal. 101. 2. Nihil in te & in Patre suo vi∣deat, quod si fe∣cerit peccet. Mementote vos parentes virgi∣nis, magis eam exemplis doceri posse, quàm voce. Hier. ad Laet. I will walke in mine house with a perfect heart, saith Dauid, whereby he would make himselfe an example, as to others of his family, so to his children. Example is a reall instruction, and addeth a sharpe edge to admonition. Much more shall a religious parent doe by practise then by precept. For children are much inclined to follow their parents: let them goe before, children will soone follow after. Practise is an euident proofe of the necessitie of the precept deliuered. §. 36. Of Parents faults contrary to their dutie of teaching their children piety. Many are the aberrations contrary to the forenamed care of teaching pietie. For 1. Most parents care only for the temporall and ciuill good of their children: so their children may be well fed and clo∣thed, and brought vp in some profitable calling, whereby they may well maintaine themselues in this world, little thought is Iob non tantum pro corpore fili∣orum sollicitus erat, sed plus de anima cogita∣bat. Orig. in Iob. lib. 1. had, or care taken for their spirituall life in this world, or eter∣nall life in the world to come. Wherein are these parents bet∣ter then heathen? Iob was otherwise minded: he was more carefull for their soules then for their bodies. 2. Many are so farre from teaching piety, as they teach their children profanenesse, pride, riot, lying, deceit, and such like principles of the deuill. It had beene better for such children to haue liued among wilde beasts, then vnder such parents. As the children hereby are thrust headlong to hell, so their blood shall be required of their parents. 3. Others thinke it enough that their children be taught a religion, but what religion it skilleth not. Such are they as hauing rich kindred but popish, commend their children to the education of such kindred, in hope of some temporall benefit, that their children may reape from them. If they were as carelesse of their childrens bodies, they would be accoun∣ted little better then murtherers: and is not the soule more pre∣tious then the body?
4. So farre are many from catechising their children and that daily, as they teach them not so much as the Lords praier, the Beleefe, and the ten Commandements. Wherein Papists shall rise vp in iudgement against them, that are very diligent in teaching their children, Pater noster, Aue Maria, and such like Latine principles, as the children cannot possibly vn∣derstand. 5. Few vse the forenamed outward helpes, as the holy rites appointed of God, the great and glorious workes of God, his extraordinary workes of mercy or iudgement, to instruct their children thereby. As they themselues care not to take notice of any such thing, so they care not whether their children doe it or no. 6. So much doe some preferre a little pelfe before the true Alexander & in moribus, & in incessu l. eo∣nidis paedagogi sui non potuit carere vitijs, quibus adbuc paruulus fuit infectus. Hier. ad Laet. good of their children, as they care not to what schoolemaster they put their children, be he profane, or popish, or vnlearned, especially if he be a kinsman, or one of their friends. Few will so doe in case of their health or outward estate: but will ra∣ther get the best Physitian, or the best Lawyer that they can. Children oft learne such euill qualities of their schoolemasters as they can neuer shake off againe. 7. Many proue very bad patternes to their children, and giue very ill example by profanensse, riotousnesse, swea∣ring, drinking, playing at vnlawfull games, &c. These parents as they brought forth their children in sinne, so they lead them on forward to hell. Their euill example is not only an hinderance to the good instruction of others, but also ma∣keth all their owne counsells (if at any time they doe giue any good counsell) to be in vaine: for the left hand of euill exam∣ple Parentes non e∣ducant filios in eruditione do∣mini quia solli∣citi non sunt pro salute vel perdi∣tione eorum. Orig. loc. citat. soone pulleth downe more then the right hand of in∣struction can build againe. To conclude, those parents whose children are not brought vp in the instruction of the Lord, shew plainly that they regard neither the saluation or damnation of their soules. §. 37. Of instructing children so soone as they are capable. Hitherto of the Kindes of nurture. The Time thereof followeth.
In handling the time of II. The Time of nurture. Nurture must be begun be∣times. good nurture, I wil shew 1. When it ought to be begun. 2. How long it ought to be continued   1. Parents ought to begin to nurture their children so soone as they are capable of any instruction. Euen as young birds are taught by their dammes to flie so soone as their wings can carry them. Pro. 22. 6. Traine vp a childe (saith Solomon) that is, while he is young and tender: and againe, & 13. 24.  mane∣inde in Picl  mane facere, id est, mature. He that loueth his childe nurtureth him be times. Thus was Samuel sent when he was ve∣ry young to be trained vp vnder Eli, (1 Sam. 1. 24.) and So∣lomon was instructed by his father when he was tender, (Pro. 4. 3.) and Timothy was taught the Scriptures 2 Tim. 3. 15. . Puer re∣cens natus. Reasons. 1. Euils pre∣uented. from a young childe, or infant. There are both priuatiue, and positiue reasons to presse this point. Priuatiue, in regard of the mischiefes that may be pre∣uented thereby. Positiue, in regard of the good that may be gained thereby. 1. Many are the euils which children by nature are prone vnto, euen as ranke ground is subiect to bring forth many weeds: for Gen. 8. 21. the imagination of mans heart is euill from his youth: and Pro. 22. 15. foolishnesse is bound in the heart of a childe. If there∣fore they be not well nurtured betimes, what can be looked for, but the fruits of euill, and folly. But timely nurture will preuent such fruits, and be an excellent preseruatiue against their owne naturall corruption, against Satans temptations and against the allurements or discouragements of the world 2. Continuance in euill maketh children obstinate, and 2. Continu∣ance in euill maketh in∣flexible. 1 Sam. 2. 25. inflexible therein. Elies sonnes being suffered to goe on in wickednesse till they came to ripenesse of yeeres, would not afterwards harken to the voice of their Father. What creature can be tamed, if it be not begun with while it is young? 3. When children first begin to be capable of instruction 3. Young children most pliable. they are most pliable to follow the direction of their parents as is euident by the ordinary course of nature in all things Clay, wax, and such other things while they are soft receiue any impression: twigs while they are tender are bowed any way: birds and beasts are easily tamed when they are young: corne sowne betimes bringeth a timely and plenti∣full haruest.
4. That which in childhood is learned, is longest retai∣ned: 4. What first learned best remembred. Prou. 22. 6. Quo semlest imbuta recens seruabit od∣rem Testa diu. Hor. Traine vp a childe in the way he should goe, and when he is old he will not depart from it. A vessell longest keepeth that sa∣uour with which at first it is seasoned: and by experience we may note old men best to remember the things which in their childhood they learned: yea by well educating children from their infancy much labour may afterwards be spared: for con∣stant vse of vertue bringeth it vnto a law. Si liberis ab ip∣sis statim initijs leges optimas imponamus, mi∣nimum posthac laborabimus. Consuetudo ipsa virtutis in le∣gem transiet. Chrys. in 1. Tim. Hom. 9. Obiect. To teach children while they are young, is but as to teach a Parrot or such like vnreasonable creatures: they may learne what is taught them, but they cannot conceiue it. 1. Answ. Though children haue not so deepe an appre∣hension while they are young, as they haue when they come to riper yeares, yet so soone as they are capable of instruction, they doe much better conceiue what is taught them, then vnreaso∣nable creatures can doe. 2. Though that were granted, yet it would not thereupon follow, that it is better not to be taught while they are young. For, first it is better that they should be framed and squared to a good course, before they can discerne betwixt good and euill, hen be suffered to runne on in euill, till they get an habit herein; which after it is got, will hardly be cast off. Second∣ly, by teaching them before they can well conceiue, their ap∣prehension is much helped. What may be the reason that hildren of kings, and great men are commonly of more vn∣derstanding at 12. or 14. yeares of age, then poore and meane ens children at 17. or 18. but that they are sooner, and bet∣er instructed? Thirdly, as by age their vnderstanding com∣meth to more and more ripenesse, they will more and more nceiue that which at first they did not so well vnderstand. Then schollers first learne their Latine rules, they learne them eerely by rote, without vnderstanding the meaning of them, Obsequentes fa∣cite filios vestros ab infantia, at∣tendentes ne in vos potestantem habeant praeter vestram senten∣tiam. Constit. Apost. l. 7. c. 4. t afterwards come to make very good vse of them. Where∣ children are to be instructed betimes euen for the benefit at may be after reaped, as corne is sowne in winter to receiue op the haruest following: and to preuent the mischiefes at may fall out, lest they get head ouer their parents against ir minde.
§. 38. Of mothers peculiar care in nurturing young children. By the way let mothers especially note this point of timely nurture, as a point in peculiar appertaining to them. The Compare 2 Tim. 1. 5. with 3. 15. grandmother Lois, and mother Eunice, first taught Timothy, Prou. 31. 1. Bathsheba taught Salomon when he was young. Oft doth Sa∣lomon warne children & 1. 8. & 6. 20. not to forsake their mothers teaching. Whereby he implieth that mothers should teach their chil∣dren especially while they are young: which duty so belon∣geth to a mother, as Prou. 29. 15. Salomon laieth the blame, and shame of the neglect thereof vpon her: on the other side the honour of well nurturing children redoundeth especially to the mother. To this purpose is it, that the 1 King. 15. 2, 10. particular names of the mo∣thers of the kings are recorded in Scripture: intimating there∣by that mothers were a maine cause of the piety, or impiety of such children. Salomon and Absolom had both one father, but di∣uers mothers. May we not well thinke that Salomons mothers care to instruct him was an especiall meanes of his piety: and that Absoloms mothers neglect of this duty, was some cause of his impiety? It is expresly noted of Ahaziahs mother, that she was his counseller to doe wickedly, which made him so wicked 2 Chro. 22. 3. as he was. Home-experience confirmeth as much: for if father and mother be of diuers religions, most of the children will fol∣low the mother. For while children are young, their mother is most in their sight: she feedeth, she apparelleth them, she tendeth them when they are not well, (when the Shunemites childe being ill, said to his father, my head, my head, he said to his seruant, carrie him to his mother.) Her precepts therefore 2 King. 4. 19. and practise in that respect are best heeded by the children, and she hath the best opportunity to perswade them to what she liketh best: so as what they learne in their younger yeares, commonly they learne of their mothers: and that which then they learne, for the most part sticketh most close vnto them, and is longest retained by them, as was noted §. 37. before. I haue not thus in particular pressed this point vpon mo∣thers, as if I exempted fathers from all care of nurturing their children in the beginning: for in my text the Apostle named Fathers: and Salomon saith, that his father taught him eue while he was tender: and Dauid felt the smart of neglecting hi
other children. It is therefore (as hath before beene proued) a ioynt duty belonging to both. Fathers therefore must doe their best endeuour, and see that mothers doe theirs also, be∣cause he is a gouernour ouer child, mother, and all. §. 39. Of letting slip the best time for nurture. Contrary is the negligence of most parents, who let the best yeares wherein their children are most docible passe ouer in wantonnesse, vanity, and folly: and so lose that which can neuer be recouered againe, most precious time. Hence is it that when they goe about to reclaime their children, they finde them exceedingly peruerse and head-strong: much like to a strong bigge arme of a tree, which if a man goe about to strai∣ten, he cannot easily make it bow: and though it bow, yet will it not continue to stand as he would haue it: nay it may be that it will rather breake then bow much. Such a branch was Ado∣niah. It is apparent that in his childhood he was not well nur∣tured, for his father would not displease him from his childhood. 1 King. 1. 6. The fathers putting off this duty to the mother, and the mothers putting it off to the father, is a great cause of the neg∣lect thereof. Were both of them perswaded that it belonged to them both, and in that respect would to their power be helpfull each to other, children would much better be in∣structed. §. 40. Of parents continuing to nurture their children. As parents must begin betimes to nurture their children, so they must hold on therein, as long as they retaine any gouern∣ment ouer them: yea so long as they remaine to be parents vn∣to them. Some difference there may be in the manner of per∣forming this duty: for children are to be vsed as children: and they who are growne in yeares, and of riper vnderstanding, accordingly to be dealt withall: yet still must parents haue a care of their well doing. The word vsed in my text and trans∣lated Children, is a generall word which in Scripture and other . writers is vsed to set forth all sort of children, of what sexe, of what age, of what degree soeuer they be. In handling the du∣ty of children we Treat. 5. §. 62. shewed, that children owed a subiection to parents so long as they liued together: wherefore by the rule of relation, so long also an authority remaineth in parents ouer
their children, and accordingly they ought to haue a fatherly care for their good. On this ground Eli did well in admo∣nishing 1 Sam. 2. 25. Iob 1. 5. Hoc faciebat ille beatus vir, non semel, aut secun∣do, neque vno anno, aut duo∣bus, sed sic facie∣bat Iob omnibus diebus vitae eo∣rum. Orig. in Iob lib. 1. his children after they were maried: his fault was that he went not farre enough in doing his duty: somewhat he did, but not all that he should and might haue done. Iob is com∣mended for the care he had ouer his children when they were growne in yeares: for day by day he sent for them and sancti∣fied them: and that after they had seuerall houses of their owne, and dwelt apart: and this all their daies. For the performance of that which is now vrged, parents must so carrie themselues from time to time towards their chil∣dren, as they euer keepe the reines in their owne hands, and Direction. retaine a power to curbe their children as they see occasion. They may, as their children grow vp in yeares, slaken the reines more and more, but neuer let them cleane goe, and cast them loose on their childrens necke. §. 41. Of parents folly in letting goe all their power ouer their children. Contrary is their folly who put themselues in their chil∣drens power, and let goe all their authority ouer them. Many Aegrè repren∣das quod sinis consuescere. Hier. ad Laet. parents that haue thus done, hauing by wofull experience found the mischiefe and inconuenience that hath followed thereupon, haue much repented their folly, and vsed meanes of redresse, but all too late. For a mischiefe is much more ea∣sily preuented then redressed. All the power that Dauid had could not hold in Absolom after he was permitted to haue 2 Sam. 15. 1. horses, and chariots, and men at his command. If Dauid, as he begun, had continued to keepe him within a compasse, and still held him vnder, all the treasonable plots which he put in execution, might easily haue beene preuented. Our times af∣ford too many examples of parents folly in this kinde, and of the mischiefes following thereupon. Of Time of nurture thus farre. The meanes thereof follow. §. 42. Of adding admonition to instruction. The meanes of helping forward the good worke of nurture III. The means of nurture. are especially two. 1. Frequent admonition. 2. Due correction.
Both of them are implied in this text: one in the word translated admonition, which (according to the notation of the . See Treat. 1. §. 120. Greeke word) is a putting of a thing into the mind, an vrging and pressing of it: the other in the word translated nurture. . See Treat. 1. §. 119. Now both these are to be ioyned together, as being very helpfull each to other. For admonition without correction is like to proue but meere vanity: and correction without ad∣monition will be too much austerity. The dutie which the first of these setteth forth, is this, Parents must oft whet instruction vpon their children: they Annuncia, prae∣cipe, impera, suade eis, &c. Aug. de salut. docum. cap. 29. may not thinke it enough to tell their children what they ought to doe, but to instruction they must adde admonition: and, as it were, beat into their childrens heads the lessons which they teach them: that so they may make a deeper im∣pression in their hearts. Thus shall their instructions be like the words of the wise which are as nailes fastened, or fast knocked Eccl. 12. 11. in: they remain firme where they are once fastened, and cannot easily be pluckt out: for as many blowes doe knocke a naile vp to the head (as we speake) so many admonitions doe settle good instructions in a childes heart, and cause that the heart be established in that which is taught, Heb. 13. 9. which is a thing to be laboured after. The generall exhortation of being 2 Tim. 4. 2. instant in season and out of season may be applied to this purpose: but more pertinently that Deut. 6. 7.  Acuit. in Piel acuit valde, vel fre∣quenter. Meta∣phora ducta à gladio, qui dum acuitur saepius impellitur ad cotem. Vatab. in annot. in hunc loc. vide Treat. 1. §. 120. direction which is in particular giuen to parents of whetting Gods words vpon their children. To this purpose is it that Solomon vseth to double his in∣structions, and vrge them againe and againe, as Pro. 1. 8. heare the in∣struction, forsake not the law: & 2. 1, 2. Direction. receiue my words, hide my com∣mandements within thee: incline thine eares, apply thy heart, &c. yea of the repeateth the very same precepts. The apprehension of children is fickle, and their memory weake: if they be but once, or seldome, or sleightly instructed, that which is taught will soone slip away, and doe little or no good. For the better performing of this dutie, parents must thinke of the best meanes they can to fasten their instructions vpon their children: and obserue their inclination and dispo∣sition, and see with what they are most moued. Constant ex∣hortations,
and powerfull perswasions are comprised vnder admonition, which in their kindes, as occasion requireth, are to be vsed. §. 43. Of parents wearisomnesse in instructing their children. Contrary is the practise of those parents who soone waxe weary in instructing their children. The Apostle laieth it downe as a generall caueat in good duties that we wax not Gal. 6. 9. weary: if in no good thing we must wax weary, shall parents wax weary in doing good to their children? Yet how many be there that hauing once taught their children, thinke they haue done dutie enough in that kinde: if their children will take it, they may. They are loth to take too much paines in often vrging the points which they haue taught them. Thus that teaching vanisheth away: and so it falleth out, as we say in the prouerbe, as good not at all as neuer the better. This is one point wherein old Eli failed: for he gaue very good instruction to his children: but because he there staied, neither was that accepted of God as a sufficient discharge of his duty, nor were his children any whit bettered thereby. If this were a fault in him notwithstanding his children were come to yeares of discretion, and to ripenesse of vnderstan∣ding, how much greater is the fault in those whose children are but young? Obiect. If a childe take not instruction at first, he is but of an vntoward and peruerse disposition: all the paines that can be taken will be lost. Answ. It may be childishnesse rather then peruersnesse, or some imperfection, rather then obstinacy. Considering the necessity of good nurture, no paines may be thought too much. There is more peruersenesse, and vntowardnesse i such parents as wax weary in doing this dutie, then in such children as at first are not wrought vpon: for this is a means ordained of God to cure this vntowardnesse. §. 44. Of parents reprouing their children. The other meanes of helping nurture is correction. Which is of two sorts; Verball, by Words. Reall,   Blowes.   The former is reprehension: and it must alwaies goe before
the latter, which is most vsually and properly called Cor∣rection. Reprehension is a kinde of middle thing betwixt admo∣nition and correction: it is a sharpe admonition, but a milde correction. It is the rather to be vsed because it may be a meanes to preuent strokes and blowes, especially in ingenuous, and good natured children (for Pro. 17. 10. a reproofe entereth more into him that is wise, then a hundred stripes into a foole) and because it may be vsed, when it is not so meet to vse strokes and blowes: as when children are growne to man-age. The many good fruits which the holy Ghost noteth to pro∣ceed from due reproofe doe shew that it is a dutie whereof parents ought to make conscience as they desire to promote the good of their children: and so much the rather because many good fruits redound to the parents that reproue, as well as to the children reproued. In regard of their good who are reproued, it is said, Pro. 6. 23. Reproofes for instruction are the way of life: they cause & 15. 32. vnderstanding; and make & 15. 5. prudent. In regard of their good who reproue, it is said, & 24. 25. To them that rebuke shall be delight (that is, much comfort and matter of reioycing, so as they shall not need to repent what they haue done) and a blessing of good shall come vpon them, that is, either a blessing of good men, who will blesse, praise and commend them: or a blessing of good things, and that from the Lord who will reward them for this conscionable performance of their dutie. Vpon these grounds Gen. 9. 25. & 34. 30. & 49. 4. holy men haue not spared to rebuke their children as there was occasion. Though 1 Sam. 2. 23. Eli dum filijs molestus esse seuera increpa∣tione recusat, & illos & seip∣sum na perdi∣dit, Chrys. in 1 Tim. hom. 9. 1 King. 1. 6. Eli did some∣what in this duty, yet because he was not more seuere therein, he brought destruction both vpon himselfe and his children. The direction noted §. 40. and 47. and Treat. 4. §. 35. may be here applied. §. 45. Of parents cockering their children. Contrary is their too much doting on children, who are oth to giue them a foule word. Dauid (though otherwise a very wise man) herein manifested much folly, for he displeased ot Adoniah at any time in saying, why hast thou done so? and like
enough it is, that also he so cockered his other rebellious sonne Absolom. Note the fearefull issue that followed there∣upon both to father and children. Though their father would not displease them, yet they cared not to displease their father, yea to grieue his heart, and vex his soule. The like may all foolish doting parents looke for at their childrens hands. For first parents by neglect of this dutie highly displease God: therefore in iust reuenge will God giue their children ouer to Omnia quae deliquerint filij, de paren∣tibus requirun∣tur qui non erudierint silios suos. Orig. in Iob. lib. 1. displease and vex them. Secondly, neglect of reproofe is a meanes to make children rude, presumptuous, rebellious, and so carelesse to please their parents. Yea all things where in chil∣dren offend through want of education shall be required at their parents hands. §. 46. Of correcting children. The latter and more proper kinde of correction which is by stripes and blowes is also a meanes appointed by God to helpe the good nurture and education of children. It is the last remedy which a parent can vse: a remedy which may doe good when nothing else can. It is by the holy Ghost both expresly commanded, and also very oft pressed vnder these and such like phrases, Pro. 19. 18. Chsten thy sonne: & 29. 17. correct thy sonne: & 23. 13. with-hold not correction from the childe: Vers. 14. thou shalt smite him with the rod. Were there no other motiue, this were sufficient. Gods charge was such a motiue to Abraham, as at it he would haue sacrificed his sonne: Gen. 22. 2, 3. and wilt not thou at Gods command correct thy childe? It is further commended by Gods owne example, which is not only set forth in some particular instances, but by his ge∣nerall constant dealing with all, and that as an especiall token and fruit of his loue. For whom the Lord loueth he chasteneth, Heb. 12. 6, 8. and scourgeth euery sonne whom he receiueth. If ye be without chastisement wherof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sonnes. Let this example of God be well weighed, for it is of great weight. Who can better tell what kinde of dealing is fittest for children then God? Who can better nurture chil∣dren then God? Who doth more truly aime at, and procure the good of children then God? Yea who doth more tender children then God? If God the father of spirits in wisdome and
loue thus deale with his children, fathers of the flesh may not thinke by the contrary to shew wisdome or loue. Their wisdome will be folly, their loue hatred. Vpon these grounds it is taken for a thing granted, that parents (who tender the good of their children as they should) doe chastise their children as need requi∣reth: for it is said, that the Pro. 3. 12. Lord correcteth whom he loueth, as a father the sonne in whom he delighteth. If parents vsed it not, this were no good inference to say, as a father: againe, as a thing without controuersie it is said, Heb. 12. 9. we haue had fathers of our flesh which corrected vs. The grounds of the equitie of this dutie, respect partly the Reasons to moue parents to correct. children corrected, and partly the parents that correct. In regard of children, it freeth them from much euill, and worketh in them much good. Correction is as physicke to purge out much corruption 1. Benefits of correction to the parties cor∣rected. which lurketh in children, and as a salue to heale many wounds and sores made by their folly. In which respect Solomon saith, that Pro. 22. 15. Foolishnesse is bound in the heart of a childe, but the rod of corre∣ction shall driue it farre from him: and againe, & 20. 30. The blewnesse of a wound is a purging medicine against euill: so doe stripes the in∣ward parts of the belly. In regard of the inward operation of this physicke, correction is further said to preserue a childe from death, (Pro. 23. 13. if thou beatest him he shall not die) and that not only from temporall death (as many children are thus preserued from the Magistrates sword) but also from eternall death (Vers. 14. thou shalt de∣liuer his soule from hell.) Note this ye cockering parents, whose ouer-much lenitie is very great crueltie. For may we not iustly count him a cruell parent, that should suffer diseases, boiles, sores, and wounds to remaine, increase, and fester in his childe, and giue him no physicke, nor apply any plaisters, or medicines to him? Nay rather who seeth his sonne running into a flaming fire, or deepe water, and would not hold him backe? Euen so cruell, and more cruell are they, who suffer their children to runne on in euill, rather then correct them. Obiect. Who can endure to make his owne childe smart, and to put him to paine? Answ. The future fruit is more to be considered, then the present paine. Potions, pills, and corasiues, are fulsome, bitter,
and painfull; but because there is a necessitie of vsing them, and great mischiefe is preuented by the vse of them, wise parents will not forbeare them for the sensible bitternesse, and paine. Fitly doth the Apostle thus answer that obiection, No chastning for the Heb. 12. 11. present seemeth to be ioyous, but grieuous; neuerthelesse, afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousnesse. This may be ap∣plied to parents corrections as well as to Gods. The good which correction bringeth to children, is by Solo∣mon noted in this and such like phrases, The rod giueth wisdome: Pro. 29. 15. for it maketh children obserue, what is good, and what euill; what commendable, and what blame-worthy: and accordingly to doe the good, and leaue the euill, which is a great point of wisdome. Obiect. Instruction will better doe this. Answ. Instruction may giue them more knowledge, but it is correction which bringeth them to practise what they know, which is the Matt. 7. 24. chiefest point of wisdome. In regard of parents, due correcting of their children both freeth them of many inconueniences, and also bringeth to them 2. Benefits of correcting to him that cor∣recteth. much quiet. 1. It spareth them much paines. For many admonitions oft repeated, and inculcated againe and againe, will not make many children so much to heed wholsome and good aduice, as a little correction. They are much more sensible of smart, then of words. 2. It preuenteth much griefe, shame, and vexation: for Pro. 17. 25. a foo∣lish sonne is a griefe to his father, and bitternesse to her that bare him. But it is & 22. 15. the rod of correction that driueth away foolishnesse, and so preuenteth that griefe and bitternesse. 3. It freeth them from the guilt of their childrens sinne, so as they are not accessarie thereto, as Sam. 3. 13. Eli was. For correction is the last remedie that a parent can vse: if by that he can doe no good, it is presupposed that he hath done his vttermost endeuour: in which respect, though the childe die in his sinne, yet the parent hath deliuered his owne soule. The quiet which is brought to parents by correcting their chil∣dren, is thus noted out by Solomon, Pro. 29. 17. Correct thy sonne, and he shall giue thee rest, yea he shall giue delight vnto thy soule. For children well nurtured, and by correction kept in a filiall awe,
will so carrie themselues, as their parents may rest somewhat se∣cure, and not disquiet themselues (as they doe with children set at libertie) yea, as trees well pruned, and ground well tilled, they will bring forth pleasant and abundant fruit; and so their parents will haue iust cause to reioyce in them. §. 47. A direction to parents in correcting their children. For well vsing this biting corasiue of correction, parents must haue respect to the matter for which they doe correct, and to their manner of correcting. In regard of the matter, these three things must be noted. Three things noted in the matter, for which corre∣ction is to be giuen. 1. That they be sure there is a fault committed: that so there be iust cause of correcting: else more hurt then good will proceed from thence. If a corasiue be laid where there is no sore, it will make one. If correction be vniustly giuen, it may prouoke to wrath, but will doe little good. This is it wherein earthly fathers are taxed, and made vnlike to God, for that many times they correct after their owne pleasure: which is a point of great in∣iustice. Heb. 12. 10. 2. That the fault be made knowne to the childe corrected: and he apparantly conuinced thereof. Correction must be for instru∣ction, which cannot be, except the childe know why he is corre∣cted: for it is all one to him, as if he were corrected for no fault, if he know not his fault. God thus a first proceeded with the ser∣pent, Gen. 3. 11, &c. with Eue, and with Adam. Thus Iudges proceed in puni∣shing malefactors. Yea thus will men deale with a dog. Should they not much more with a childe? 3. That the faults be such especially, as the parents can shew to their children (if at least they be of so much discretion) to be against Gods word; as swearing, lying, pilfring, and the like: for 1. these are most dangerous faults, and therefore more carefully to be purged out. 2. the childe corrected will thus be the better euicted of his fault, the more condemne himselfe, and more con∣tentedly beare the correction. In regard of the manner of correcting, foure generall, and foure Foure general rules for the manner of correcting. particular rules are to be obserued. The generall rules are these. 1. An eye must be had to Gods manner of correcting his chil∣dren, and in particular of Gods correcting the parent himselfe:
no better generall direction can be giuen: for Gods patterne is a perfect rule. 2. Prayer must be made by parents for themselues and for their children: for themselues, to be directed in doing it: for their children, to be bettered by it. Thus will good Physitians in mi∣nistring physicke. In all duties is prayer to be vsed; especially in this: for a parent is ready, partly through his owne intemperate passion, and partly through the childs impatiencie, to fall into one extreme or other. This is not to impose vpon all, whensoeuer they take vp the rod, to goe and make a solemne prayer, but to lift vp the heart for direction and blessing. 3. Correction must be giuen in loue. All things must be done in 1 Cor. 16. 14. loue: much more this, that carieth a shew of anger and hatred. In loue they will giue physicke to their children, and splinter a ioynt, if need be. God correcteth his children in loue: so must Reu. 3. 19. parents. Loue will make them doe it with tendernesse and com∣passion. 4. Correction must be giuen in a milde moode, when the affe∣ctions Nunquam, ira∣tus qui accedit ad poenam, me∣diocritatem te∣nebit, Cic. Offic. lib. 1. Ier. 10. 11. Foure particu∣lar rules for the manner of correcting. are well ordered, and not distempered with choler, rage, fu∣rie, and other like passions. Disturbed passions cast a mist before the vnderstanding, so as a man cannot discerne what is enough, what too much. When passion is moued, correction must be de∣ferred. God correcteth in measure. The particular rules are these. 1. Due order must be kept. Correction by word must goe before correction by the rod. Reu. 3. 19. Vt ad vrendum & secandum medici, sic nos ad castigandū, rarò, inuitique veniamus, nec vnquam nisi ne∣cessario, sinulla reperietur alia medicina. Cic. Offic. lib. 1. I rebuke and chasten, saith the Lord. Thus a parent will shew that he taketh no delight in smiting his childe: it is necessitie that forceth him thereunto. Thus a parent sheweth himselfe like to God, who doth not punish willingly, Lam. 3. 33. Physitians, when they minister strong phy∣sicke, will giue a preparatiue: rebuke may be as a preparatiue. Good and pitifull Chirurgions will try all other meanes before they come to launce and seere. 2. Due respect must be had to the partie corrected: if he be young and tender, the lighter correction must be vsed. Solomon oft mentioneth a rod, as meetest for a childe; for that is the lightest correction. So if the childe be of a flexible and ingenuous dis∣position, soone sneapt, the correction must accordingly be mode∣rated.
If he be well growne, and withall be stout, and stubborne, the correction may be more seuere. 3. Due respect must be had to the fault: Sinnes directly Cauendum ne maior poena, quàm culpa sit. Cic. loc. citat. against God, open, notorious, scandalous sinnes, knowne sinnes, sinnes often committed, in which they are growne vp, and whereof they haue gotten an habit, are with greater seue∣ritie to be corrected. 4. A parent must behold his owne faults in correcting his childes: so more compassion will be wrought in him. §. 48. Of parents too much indulgency. Contrary to this dutie of correcting are two extremes. 1. Too much lenitie. 2. Too much seueritie. Many so cocker their children, as they will suffer them to Qui non corri∣piunt filios suos, & eorum ani∣mas igni inex∣tinguibili in interitum tra∣dunt, & semet∣ipsos in furorem iudicij demr∣gunt. Orig. in Iob. lib. 1. 1 Sam. 2. 29. run into any misdemeanour, rather then correct them. They cannot endure to heare their children cry: and therefore their children must be pleased in all their humours and euill desires. These parents bring shame to themselues, and mischiefe vpon their children: for God is oft forced to correct such. Heauy are Gods corrections: and oft light on parent and childe both: as appeareth by the iudgement on Eli and his sonnes: for such parents make themselues accessary to their childrens sinnes: yea also to the iudgements laid vpon their children. God saith of such parents, that they honour their children aboue God. It is therefore a fond indulgency which maketh parents regard nei∣ther Gods honour, nor their owne or childrens safetie. Mothers for the most part offend herein, who are so farre from performing this dutie themselues, as they are much of∣fended with their husbands if they doe it. And to proclaime their folly to all the world, they cannot commit their children to a Tutor or Schoole-master, but with a strait charge, that they correct them not. Obiect. Correction maketh children sots and blocks. Answ. If Gods spirit deserue to haue more credence then such foolish women, that obiection is most false, for we heard §. 46. before how correction giueth wisdome, and driueth out foolishnesse. 2. Obiect. Mothers may be the more borne with herein,
because with long trouble they did beare, and with great tra∣uell bring forth their children. Answ. That may be a good motiue for them to seeke the true good of their children, that so their trouble and trauell may not be in vaine: but not to vphold them in the broad way that leadeth to destruction. §. 49. Of parents too much seueritie in correcting their children. They who offend in the other extreme of seuerity, of the Patres non o∣portet asperos esse circa filios. Cyp. Testim. l. 3. c. 71. two are the more vnnaturall parents; they offend directly a∣gainst the first branch of this text (Prouoke not to wrath.) No∣thing more prouoketh then immoderate seuerity: for 1. It argueth no loue in the parent, but rather hatred, at least wrath, and other such like distempered affections. 2. It softeneth not the childes heart, but hardeneth it rather. Uerendum ne, si parentes ob quaevis errata filios coarguant, frontem tandem ipsi perfricent. Greg. Naz. ad Vital. 3. It maketh him dull, and stupid, and cleane peruerteth the right and true end of correction. 4. It oft maketh a childe thinke of doing some mischiefe to his parent or himselfe. That parents may the rather take heed of this extreme, I will briefly note wherein excesse in seueritie is shewed. It is shewed, when correction is giuen 1. For no fault. In this case, though correction be neuer so light, it is too seuere. 2. For small faults, in wrath and furie, though the stripes be few and light, yet the parents behauiour is too much seueritie. 3. To children that are young and tender, or soft, milde and ingenuous, as if they were in some yeeres, the most obsti∣nate and peruerse that could be. 4. Too often: for euery thing done amisse: whereas parents Multa quae vi∣dent parentes videre se dissi∣mulent; multa se minime au∣disse fingant quae auribus infixa habent. Greg. Naz. ad Vital. should seeme not to see or heare many things which they see, and heare. 5. Too sorely: so as the childe is lamed, or some way so hurt as he shall feele it as long as he liueth. §. 50. Of Parents care in prouiding fit callings for their children. Hauing laid downe such duties of parents as especially re∣spect
the childhood of children, I proceed to lay forth such as haue respect to their riper yeeres wherein they are to be placed forth. Here we are to note 1. The kindes of those duties. 2. The meanes of performing them.   The kindes may be drawne to two heads. 1. Prouiding fit places and callings for them to exercise their gifts. 2. Prouiding fit mariages for them. We heard §. 31. before how children were to be trained vp, and fitted to some good calling euen in their childhood. Now further, when by vertue of good education they are inabled to discharge the functions and duties of a calling, and by yeeres they are well growne vp, so as it is time they should be set to some particular calling: Parents ought to prouide fit callings for their children, and fit Fit callings to be prouided. places for them to exercise the gifts which by nature or educa∣tion they haue gotten. For example, If children haue beene brought vp in learning, parents must vse what lawfull and ho∣nest meanes they can to settle them in such a place and course as they may professe and exercise their gifts, according to their seuerall kindes, be it Diuinitie, Law, Physicke, or the like: or if they haue beene brought vp in any trade, to prouide that they may set vp (as we speake) and exercise their trade. The two first children that euer were borne of woman, Gen. 4. 2. Cain and A∣bel, were placed forth in seuerall callings; and without doubt their places were so ordered by their parents. The like may be gathered out of these phrases, & 25. 27. Esau was a man of the field, and Iaakob dwelt intents. 1 Sam. 8. 1. It is noted of Samuel, that he made his two sonnes Iudges. Had they beene as faithfull in well vsing their places, as their father was carefull in prouiding them, they might haue liued well themselues, and done much good to others. Ishai hauing many sonnes, had a care hereof: for 1 Sam. 17. 13. he sent his three eldest sonnes to the war; and placed them in a souldiers course of life: &. 16. 11. his youngest he made a shepheard, which was in those daies and places a calling of greater reckoning then now it is with vs. 1. Thus shall they make vse of that abilitie whereunto by The benefits of a fit calling.
their parents prouidence, and their owne diligence they haue attained: otherwise that abilitie may soone be lost. Doth not daily experience shew that many who haue beene well trained vp by their parents in learning, so farre as they haue beene fit to haue entred into the ministerie, for want of place and im∣ploiment, haue in time so forgotten all, as if they had ne∣uer beene trained vp in learning: and so in other sciences. 2. Thus come they to doe much more good in Church or Common-wealth: till men be placed in distinct callings, they are but fitting and preparing for future times. I denie not but that both Church and Common-wealth may reape much be∣nefit by the paines and labour of the younger sort, who are trained vp vnder others: but most properly are they counted members of the Church and Common-wealth, and actuall in∣struments of the good thereof, who haue some particular di∣stinct calling, whereby they doe good to others. 3. Thus they come to liue of themselues, and to be able to releeue others also. All the time of their education, they are commonly at the charge of others: at least, though by their paines they may gaine much, yet the gaine returnes to others: they themselues for the most part haue but a bare maintenance, meat, drinke and cloth (as we say:) little haue they to lay vp for themselues for the time to come, or to giue to others for the present. 4. They thus come to traine vp others against after times, as they themselues haue beene trained vp: whereby a continuall and perpetuall succession of all kindes of callings, is from time to time preserued: and thus Family, Church, and Common-wealth vpheld and maintained. In short time would all cal∣lings and functions vtterly decay, if a continuall supplie were not thus made. §. 51. Direction for parents in prouiding callings for their children. Two especiall cautions are to be obserued by parents in Cautions in prouiding callings. prouiding callings for their children. 1. That such callings be prouided as their children haue beene trained vp vnto, and are in some measure fitted and en∣abled to performe the duties thereof: as to prouide a Ministers
place for him that hath beene brought vp in learning and stu∣died diuinity: so in other callings such, as their children may be their crafts-masters therein. Thus shall their children doe the more good therein, both to others and themselues. Beza∣leel and Aholiab were chosen to build the tabernacle because they were filled with wisdome to worke all manner of worke: like∣wise Exod. 35. 35. the seruants of Hirom were chosen to hew Cedar trees for the temple, because among the Iewes there were not any that 1 King. 5. 6. could skill to hew timber, like vnto the Sidonians. Pharaoh was carefull to haue men of actiuity rulers ouer his cattell. Gen. 47. 6. 2. That such meanes be vsed for prouiding a calling as pa∣rents in vsing them may with faith call vpon God for his bles∣sing. They that by lawfull meanes are brought into a calling whereunto they are fitted, are set therein by God, as is implied by this phrase, as God hath called euery one, &c. A lawfull en∣trance into a calling is a matter of great moment: he that so entreth may in a right vse thereof cast himselfe vpon Gods blessing, and with strong confidence expect the same, saying as the Prophet did, Lord I haue not thrust in my selfe thou Ier. 17. 16. knowest. §. 52. Of the extremes contrary to a parents lawfull care in prouiding fit callings for his children. 1. Extreme in the defect. The extreme in the defect contrary to a parents prouident care in prouiding a fit calling, is, a carelesse neglect of children after they are well educated, a leauing them to shift for them∣selues. Imitari noli crudelitatem earum auium quibus vngues aduncisunt: hi cùm suos sen∣serint foetus vo∣landi iom po∣testatem conse∣quutos esse, alis eos verberantes ac impingentes nidis pellunt, nullam{que} pror∣sus erga illos extrusos curam dinceps adhi∣bent. Basil. Hexam. hom. 8. It is noted of the rauenous fowles that haue sharpe ta∣lents, that so soone as they perceiue their young ones to be able to fly, they will flap and beat them with their wings, and driue them out of their nests, and after that take no further care of them. We may not be like such cruell birds: reason nd religion teacheth vs otherwise. Good education is a good duty, but not a parents whole duty: the stay which is here made, may make all the former care and paines to be of little se. Obiect. This is to be left to Gods prouidence. Answ. Meanes rightly vsed are subordinate to Gods proui∣dence, and by them doth God manifest his prouidence and bring his counsell to passe: to neglect meanes is to thwart and
crosse the diuine prouidence. It is therefore well done to re∣ly on Gods prouidence: but ill done to neglect the meanes of effecting it. Gods blessing is best discerned in the vse of meanes. The extreme in the excesse is a preposterous greedinesse in 2. Extreme in excesse. parents to bring their children to a calling. This is manifest∣ed two waies. 1. When they care not how fit their children be for the 1. Vnfit cal∣ing. place, so it be a place of gaine and honour. Experience shew∣eth that this is the bane of Church and commonwealth. Here∣by it falleth out in the politique body, as it would in a naturall body; if the hand should take vpon it to see, or the leg to heare, or the foot to taste, what could from thence be expected but ruine to the body? Trades-men oft vndoe themselues, their families and friends, by vndertaking such trades as they haue no skill in, or whereof they are not crafts-masters. The more excellent the calling is, the more mischiefe is done by this gree∣dy preposterousnesse. This extreme is so much worse then the former, as it is worse to doe much hurt, then no good. 2. When they make no conscience of the meanes which 2. Vndue en∣trance. they vse to bring their children into callings: but by vnlawfull meanes purchase their desires: as, by Simony to procure an ecclesiasticall function (whence oft followeth also periury) or by bribery to procure an office. These indirect meanes take away difference betwixt fitnesse and vnfitnesse of persons: for the vnfittest that be may by mo∣ney purchase a place. Besides, though children be neuer so  for these callings, yet there is little hope of any blessing from God, when the first entrance is without him: yea against his will and word. Who can thinke that God hath placed such a one in his place? if God haue not placed him, with what faith can he seeke a blessing? with what hope can he expect a bles∣sing? Much terror is by this meanes brought to many men conscience: and they are oft in a great strait, not knowing whether it be fittest for them to retaine, or relinquish the What is to be done after one is vnlaw∣fully setled in a fit calling. place. But by the way to resolue that doubt, if one that hath vn∣lawfully entred be fit for the performance of his place, it
then safest for him to seeke pardon for the former offence, and reconciliation with God, and vpon true and vnfained repen∣tance to hold the place (if at least the law vnder which he li∣ueth establish him therein) and be so much the more faithfull in the discharge of the duties thereof. §. 53. Of parents care in prouiding fit mariages for their chil∣dren. God hath further laid a charge vpon parents to prouide ma∣riages Date operam vt cùm ad adultā aetatem filij per∣uenerint matri∣menio iungan∣tur. Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 11. lege Chrys. in 1. Tim. hom. 9. for their children: for thus saith the Prophet in the name of the Lord vnto parents, Ier. 29. 6. Take wiues to your sonnes, and giue your daughters to husbands: and thus the Apostle, 1 Cor. 7. 36. If any man thinke that he behaueth himselfe vncomely toward his virgin, if she passe the floure of her age, and need so require, let them marry. This direction was giuen in times of persecution, when by reason of the present necessity it was better not to marry: if then a parent ought to be carefull (need requiring) to prouide a mariage for his daughter, much more ought he in times of peace. Holy parents commended by the Holy Ghost haue beene carefull in performing this duty, as Gen. 24. 4. Abraham, & 28. 2. Isaak, Rut. 3. 1. Naomi, and others: yea Gen. 21. 21. Hagar had learned this duty in Abrahams house. But the perfect patterne (which surpas∣seth all other examples) is of & 2. 18. God himselfe, who prouided a fit match for his Luke 3. 38. Reasons. sonne Adam. 1. Children may not marry without consent of parents, (as was Treat. 5. §. 16, 17. before shewed) Parents therefore must be carefull in time to prouide for them. 2. Parents are to children in Gods place: they must there∣fore take vpon them this care of God. 3. Mariage is the meanes which the Lord hath sanctified to preserue our bodies chaste and vndefiled: as parents therefore desire to keepe their children from vncleannesse and polluti∣on, they must take care that this meanes be vsed. Not only ho∣ly Apostles, but also Liberos qui voluptatibus ni∣mis sunt dediti dabis operam vt coniugio astrin∣gas: vinculum enim hoc est tu∣tissimum inven∣tutis. Plut. de Instit. lib. heathen Philosophers, and that by the light of nature, haue found this to be the fittest course. 4. This also is a meanes as to Gen. 1. 28. increase the commonwealth, and Mal. 2. 15. preserue an holy seed, and to erect new families, so to continue parents owne houses and name.
§. 54. Direction to parents in prouiding mariages. Two cautions are to be obserued of parents in prouiding mariages for their children. 1. That the match which they prouide be meet: so said God when he was about to prouide a match for Adam, I will Gen. 2. 18. make him an helpe meet for him. Therefore See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 9, 10 &c. the match proui∣ded must not be too neere of kin, of a contrary religion, of too vnequall an age, of too great disparity in estate. These things will hinder loue, and cause disdaine and hatred of one ano∣ther. 2. Though the match may seeme meet in the parents eie, yet he may not force his childe thereto. Could a fitter match haue beene found out for Rebekah then Isaak? yet Rebekahs friends Gen. 24. 57. What to be done if chil∣dren like not such a match as parents thinke meet. Non cogitur fi∣lius-familias vxorem ducere. Digest. l. 23. c. 2. §. 21. asked her consent. I denie not but parents may vse all manner of faire meanes to moue their children to yeeld to that which they see good for them: but if they cannot moue them to yeeld, to referre the matter to God, and not against their childrens minds to force them. When God had made a most meet match for Adam, he brought her to the man: name∣ly to see how he would like her. For the neerest bond of all is betwixt man and wife; a man must leaue father and mother, and Gen. 2. 22. Sacra in hoc negotio paren∣tibus authori∣tas esse debet: sed tenenda est media ratio, vt sponte ac mutuo consensu inter se contrahant partes. Cal. in Gen. 24. vers. 57. cleaue vnto his wife; man and wife must alwaies liue together: great reason therefore that at the first ioyning them together there be a mutuall liking of one another, lest euer after there be a perpetuall dislike: and though the authority of parents ought in this case to be inuiolable, yet a middle course is so to be held, as the parties may willingly with a mutuall consent ioyne themselues together. §. 55. Of the extremes contrary to parents care in prouiding fit mariages for their children. The extreme in the defect is, when parents carelesly let their children passe the floure of their age: and neuer consider whe∣ther need require that they should mary or no. Their children may sit long enough before they seeke out a match for them, vnlesse it be brought to them: and when one is offered though it be neuer so fit, yet except they may make an aduantage there∣of to themselues, they will hardly yeeld to it. Thus they make their children to seeke out mariages for themselues, and
without their consent to make them vp: or else to liue in dis∣content, Si filij innupti feruore aetatis in consuetudi∣nem sornicandi inciderint, vos parentes in die iudicij ra∣tionem deo estis reddituri. Con∣stit. Apost. l. 4. c. 11. if not in vncleannesse. By the carelesnesse of parents in this respect are children oft made a prey to the deuill: whereof at the day of iudgement parents shall giue an ac∣count to God. The extreme in the excesse is, See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 2. when parents through a co∣uetous desire to get great and rich matches for their children, marie them before they be of yeares of discretion to like or dislike, to know what is meet or vnmeet; or able to performe euen the essentiall duties of mariages: seldome doe such vn∣lawfull mariages prosper. In a like excesse doe they offend who for outward aduanta∣ges match their children to such as by nature are vnfit for ma∣riage, to ideots, to See Treat. 2. Part. 1. §. 11, 12. idolaters, to profane persons, or they care not to whom. And if their children like not these matches, they will doe to the vttermost of their power what they can to force them thereunto. Many mischiefes ordinarily fall out vpon such mariages, as vtter dislike betwixt husband and wife, continuall complaining one of another, inquiring after diuorce, or any other separation, wishing, yea practising one anothers death. To all these mischiefes doe parents, the cause thereof, make themselues accessary. §. 56. Of parents prouiding a stocke for callings and mariages of their children. An especiall outward meanes whereby parents may be the better inabled to prouide fit callings and mariages for their children, is, before hand to lay vp some stocke, or competent portion for their children. This is comprised vnder that ge∣nerall prouision, whereof he that is carelesse is counted by the Apostle 1 Tim. 5. 8. worse then an insidell: but more expresly is it noted in these words, 2 Cor. 12. 14. Parents ought to lay vp for their children: and commended in Gen. 25. 5, 6. Abrahams example. While children are vnder their parents they haue no meanes to lay vp for themselues: for all their seruice is for their parents. But in regard of the times wherein we liue, it is needfull for setting vp in a good calling, and for obtaining a fit match, that children haue some stocke and portion. It
lieth therefore vpon the parents, and their duty it is to pro∣uide it. Obiect. Christ forbiddeth to lay vp treasures on earth. Ma. 6 19. expounded. Answ. If the scope of that place be rightly marked, it will appeare that Christ there forbiddeth not simply the thing it selfe, but 1. The minde of him that layeth vp: namely when it is fil∣led full of carking, and distrustfull thoughts: fearing that in the time to come he shall not haue sufficient. To this purpose doth Christ propound Gods prouidence ouer fowles and Vers. 26, 28. lillies. 2. The manner of laying vp, when temporall things are preferred before spirituall and heauenly: therefore he addeth this precept, but lay vp treasures in heauen, &c. Uers. 20. 3. The measure, when men neuer thinke they haue laid vp enough: but scrape what they can come by iustly or vniustly; and spare more then needs, euen things necessary, from them∣selues and others, to make a great stocke and portion for their children. The word of . Direction for laying vp por∣tions. treasuring vp (which Christ there vseth) implieth an immoderate measure. Among other needfull cautions for parents to be obserued in laying vp for their children, these three are especially to be noted. 1. That iustly they come by that which they lay vp: and lay nothing towards a childs portion which is any way vniustly gotten; for the treasures of wickednesse profit nothing: they may Pro. 10. 2. proue a fire to consume parents themselues, their children, their house, and whole posterity. 2. That they couet not too much to make their children rich, and for that purpose liue meanly and basely themselues, yea and depriue themselues of many necessaries. An egregi∣ous Eccl. 5. 12. point of folly is this, which Solomon hath much taxed. 3. That all needfull duties of charity to the poore, and of iustice to the Church and common-wealth be performed, and pretext of laying vp for children hinder none of these. §. 57. Of the extremes contrary to a parents prouiding por∣tions for his children. The extremes contrary to the forenamed dutie are these:
1. When parents liue at the vttermost extent of their estate, and from time to time spend all their reuenues or all their gaines, and so are scarce able to make euen at quarter day, or yeares end. What stocke or portion can they lay vp for children? 2. When parents liue aboue their estate, and spend rio∣tously their ordinary gaines, or reuenues, and for other neces∣sary affaires are forced to runne into debt. Many are so farre from helping their children in this kinde, as they are maine hinderance vnto them, vrging their eldest sonne especially who is their heire, to be bound for them, and so lay such a bur∣den on his backe, as (to vse the common phrase) they make it cracke againe. 3. When parents haue enough for themselues and their children, and yet so couetously dote vpon their wealth, as they will not bestow a groat to helpe them in calling and mariage, but say they keepe all for them. What a wretched and foolish disposition is this, that they should still lay vp more and more for their children, and yet refuse to bestow any part thereof vpon them in their greatest need, when it might redound to their greatest benefit? God oft meeteth with such couetous misers, and crosseth their purposes, by making strangers to enioy that which they greedily hoorded vp. §. 58. Of parents last speech to their children. The last dutie which parents owe to their children, is, when they cease to be parents: that is, when they are going out of this world. Their dutie at that time in generall is to doe what lieth in them, that it may goe well with their children after their depar∣ture. Both See §. 6. the reasons which are oft vrged by the Holy Ghost, to stir vp parents to yeeld obedience to God, taken from ex∣tent of Gods blessing (in this kinde of phrase, Pro. 20. 7. Blessed shall their children be after them) and Gods Deut. 5. 29. promises made to that pur∣pose doe proue as much. For the better performing of this dutie, three generall points, tending both to the temporall, and also to the spirituall good of children, are to be obserued: and two particular points most ten∣ding to their temporall estate. The three generals are these.
1. Good direction. 2. Faithfull prayer. 3. A wise choise of some friends to be as parents to them. 1. Parents on their death∣bed to leaue good lessons to their chil∣dren. For direction. When parents obserue their time to draw neere, they ought to commend some wise and wholsome pre∣cepts vnto their children, the better to direct them in their Chri∣stian course. So did Gen. 28. 2, 4. Isaak, and & 49. 1. &c. Iaakob. Ob. These Patriarchs had an extraordinarie spirit of prophe∣cying, & by vertue thereof foretold their children things to come. Answ. See Treat. 5. §. 9. They sustained a double person: one of a prophet, another of a father: as prophets, they had an extraordinarie spi∣rit; as parents, they performed ordinarie dutie: by their extraor∣dinarie spirit, they foretold things to come: the ordinarie dutie which they performed, was to direct their children how to carrie themselues in those times to come. For their prophesies were not only predictions, but also instructions, to direct and teach them what to doe. What they did by an extraordinarie spirit in extra∣ordinarie things, we must doe in ordinarie duties by the ordinarie spirit of vnderstanding and wisdome which the Lord giueth vs. But the direction which Gen. 28. 2. &c. Isaak gaue to Iaakob, when he sent him to Laban, was no extraordinarie prophesie: nor that which 1 Chro 28. 9. Da∣uid, when he was old, gaue to Solomon: and againe, 1 King. 2. 2, 3, &c. when he lay on his death-bed. Now these things are thus written for our imi∣tation. And great reason there is to imitate those holy men in these things. For 1. The words of a dying parent are commonly most regarded: his last words doe make a deepe impression (Gen. 50. 16. this doe the bre∣thren of Ioseph presse vpon him.) If euer therefore there be a time seasonable for a parent to giue good instructions to his children, then is the time when parents are cleane departing from their children. 2. Thus shall a parent manifest his true affection, and earnest desire of his childrens good: for now they cannot thinke that he seeketh his owne ease, and profit, more then their good: as at other times some will be ready to say of their parents instructions and admonitions, Our parents know what is good for themselues. That the last words of parents may be the more seasonably and Direction. profitably deliuered to their children, they must note, on the one
side, what euils their children are most prone vnto, what tempta∣tions they are most assaulted withall, what snares they are most like to fall into; and on the other side, what vertues and graces are most needfull for them, and wherein they faile most, and accordingly they must order and frame their last words. Note for a patterne herein Gen. 28, 2, &c. Isaaks counsell to Iaakob, when he sent him to Laban, and thought he should neuer see him againe: and 1 King. 2. 2, 3. Da∣uids to his sonne Solomon. §. 59. Of Parents last blessing to their children. II. Concerning the prayers of parents for their children, I noted it §. 4. before to be a generall dutie neuer to be omitted: yet here in particular I mention it againe, because a parents blessing consisteth therein especially: and then is the most proper time for parents to bestow a blessing on their children, as Gen. 28. 3. Isaak, & 48. 15. Iaakob, 1 Chro. 29. 19. Dauid, and others did. Let parents therefore as they commend their owne soules into Gods hand, so commend their children vnto Gods grace and blessing. Gods prouidence is a good inhe∣ritance: many children doe thereby exceedingly prosper, though they haue but small outward meanes; whereas others that haue great meanes vsed for their good, come to ruine; Gods curse following them. Now no such meanes can be thought of to procure Gods blessing, or to with-hold his curse, as the faithfull prayers of parents for their children; especially when parents are leauing their children, and going to God. §. 60. Of parents care to commend their children to some faith∣full friends. III. The third generall point of making choise of some faith∣full friends to commend their children vnto, is especially in be∣halfe of such as are not of sufficient age and discretion to looke to themselues, or to those weightie affaires which belong vnto them. The friends, which in this case are made choise of, ought to be such as the parents themselues by good experience haue found to be honest, wise, faithfull, and louing to them and theirs; whom parents are to set in their owne place for the good of their children. This meanes did Dauid vse when he was old in the be∣halfe 1 Chro. 22. 17. & 28. 21. of his sonne Solomon. Many children haue found much helpe thereby. Such may make a good supply of the departure of parents. These are so much the more needfull, by how much
the more vnstable, and vnbridled youth is; and by how much the lesse able children are to helpe and guide themselues. §. 61. Of parents neglect of their children for the time to come. Contrary to a parents prouidence for the good of his children after his departure, is the carelesnesse of parents for the time to come. They thinke the world is gone with them when they are gone, and therefore they will take no thought for the future times that shall be after them; as if it were enough for euery one to looke to his owne time. There may seeme to be more selfe-loue in such parents then loue of their children, in that their care de∣termineth with their owne time, and extendeth not it selfe to the time and continuance of their children. Hence is it, that not a word of direction and exhortation commeth out of their mouths to their children when they are departing, no blessing that they will leaue behinde them, no friends shall be deputed by them, to be as parents to their children. Let God prouide, say they. But where there is a referring of matters to Gods prouidence, without the vse of those meanes which God hath warranted and commen∣ded by his word, there can be little hope that God should take care of that which is so commended to him. Such men doe not in faith depend vpon Gods prouidence, but make the very name thereof a pretext to cast off that care, which God as a bounden du∣tie requireth of them. As there is little loue of their children in such parents, so there is lesse zeale of Gods glory: for a parents care of his childrens welfare, especially of their continuing to feare and serue the Lord after their owne departure out of this world, is an especiall meanes of preseruing Gods feare in the world, and propagating it from age to age: so as this neglect is a greater fault then many are aware of. §. 62. Of parents making a Will before they die. The two particular things to be obserued by parents for mani∣festation of their prouident care ouer their children for the time to come, euen after their departure, especially in regard of their temporall estate, are these, 1. That they make a will. 2. That they leaue their estates to their children. 1. It hath beene an ancient commendable practise both a∣mong A Will to be made. Gods people, and others also, that haue beene guided with
common ciuilitie, when they who haue any estate, waxe old, or sicke, and haue any occasion of expecting death offered vnto them, to make their last Will and testament. This is set forth in the old Testament vnder this phrase (Put thy house in order.) A dutie it is expresly 2 King. 20. 1. commanded by God: and that not without good reason. For 1. A parents Will is an especiall meanes to settle peace among children after his departure, and to make them content with that allowance which he hath set out vnto them, because by the Will they know it was their fathers pleasure they should haue such and such a portion. If controuersies should arise, yet a Will is a meanes for the law speedily to determine the same without any tedious and chargeable suits: for the Apostle taketh it for a ruled case, that no man disanulleth or addeth any thing to a mans' testament. Gal. 3. 15. 2. After a parent hath made his Will, he may the more quietly settle himselfe for heauenly contemplations, and preparations to death: and thinke of such good instructions as are most fit to giue as his farewell to his children: and the more willingly expect the moment of his dissolution: and the more patiently submit him∣selfe to the very stroke of death. In performing this dutie, a man must both obserue a fit time, Direction. and also take good aduice. The fit time is while his vnderstan∣ding is good, and his memorie perfect: so as he may call to minde his debts, what he oweth, and what is owing to him: as also what goods he hath to bestow, and with discretion and wis∣dome order his estate. And because through the cauils which many vnconscionable lawyers and others are like to make, his true meaning may be peruerted, it is meet to haue the ad∣uice of such as can in distinct words and phrases so expresse his meaning, as they shall be free from exception. Matters of weight are wisely to be managed. §. 63. Of neglecting to make a Will. Contrary is the daily practise of too many parents who are not willing to make any will at all: or else on vaine hope that they may liue longer, and when they are sicke, vpon conceit that they may recouer, or at least longer continue to enioy the vse of their vnderstanding and memory, put off the ma∣king of their Will till it be too late: and so die without Will,
or make such a Will as ministreth more matter of sute, then if they had no Will at all; either because doubt is made whether he that made it had his vnderstanding and memory or no: or because his Will is so abrupt and ambiguous, as his meaning cannot be knowne. The mischiefes that follow these neglects, Inconueni∣ence of dying without a Will. are many. As 1. Discredit to the partie deceased. 2. Contentions among his suruiuing children. 3. Wasting a great part, if not his whole estate, in suits of law. 4. Defeating many creditors of their due debt. The reason which maketh many to put off the making of their Will is a foolish conceit, that if a mans Will be once made, then he must needs die out of hand. But what ground haue men for any such conceit? If sicknes grow vpon a man, so long as his Will is vnmade his minde is vnsetled, his minde being vnsetled, the physicke that is ministred to him cannot so kindly worke; so as his death may be the more hastened for not making a Will. Besides, if his speech faile before his vn∣derstanding, the thought that then he shall die without a Will may so perplex him, as his departure will be very vnquiet and troublesome. §. 64. Of parents leauing their estate to their children when they die. It was §. 56. before shewed that parents were to lay vp a portion for their children against their entrance into a calling, and mariage: There is a further duty required when they are go∣ing out of the world, namely that they leaue their whole estate The estate of parents to be left to their children. to their children. (Where I say whole, I exempt not workes of charity, nor payment of debts, which is a point of iustice, but I include more then is giuen as portions or stockes in their life time.) That estate especially which parents haue receiued from their progenitors are they most bound to leaue vnto their children. It is expresly recorded that Abraham gaue all Gen. 25. 5. that he had to Isaak. Gods law did prouide for this among the Iewes: for a man might not sell his land to cut it off from Leu. 25. 23. his posterity. This was it that made Naboth refuse to sell his vineyard to Ahab, as his answer implieth, God forbid that I 1 King. 21. 3.
should giue the inheritance of my fathers vnto thee: because it was the inheritance of his fathers, that is, he had receiued it from them, he thought it vnlawfull to depriue his children of it. This phrase (if children, then heires) taketh it for a granted Rom. 8. 17. truth that children haue a right to their parents estate: and if they haue a right thereto, they may not be defeated thereof. God giueth wealth vnto parents but for their life time: in which time they are but as Guardians vnto Gods children, and are accountable to God: so as they haue not an absolute power to doe with it what they will, but according to the di∣rections of the great Lord and Master they must vse it, reserue it, and leaue it. For this end parents must order their manner of liuing ac∣cording Direction. to that portion which the Lord hath appointed vnto them, and by his prouidence bestowed vpon them; they must (as it is said in the prouerbe) cut their coat according to their cloth. Of the two it is much better for parents to liue vnder, then aboue their meanes. Prouided that they neglect no duty of charitie, or iustice: nor through miserablenesse and nig∣gardlinesse carry themselues vnbeseeming the place wherein God hath set them, and estate which he hath bestowed vpon them. He that liueth somewhat vnder his meanes, hath op∣portunitie to lay vp portions for other children (if he haue many) and to reserue his inheritance intire to his eldest (be∣side many other good workes of charity as God shall offer oc∣casion) which he that liueth aboue his meanes cannot doe. §. 65. Of the inconueniences which improuident parents bring their children vnto after their death. Contrary to this branch of a parents prouidence, are many courses of improuident parents: For 1. Some parents lauish and bezell out all their estate in their owne life time, making it to determine in their persons. Vnworthy they are to receiue any inheritance from ancestors. Their fault is double. 1. In spending prodigally aboue their estate. 2. In wronging their children, and depriuing them of their right: for particular persons succeding one another are but as diuers linkes of a continued family, which are by Gods
prouidence added one to another: this chaine is not to be broken at any mans pleasure; but for the preseruation there∣of, that which hath beene receiued of the predecessors, must be left to the successors. 2. Others leaue their estate to their children, but so incum∣bred with debts, bonds, recognizances, and statutes, as their children were better be without it, then haue it. For the ha∣uing it maketh them liue at an answerable rate, and bringeth many burdens vpon them: besides, the debts wherein they stand obliged make them as Pro. 22. 7. seruants to their creditors: and in time they must be forced to sell all, or as captiues lie in prison. 3. Others though they deale not so hardly with their chil∣dren, yet they deale too hardly by peeling and polling their inheritance as much as they can: they wil not forbeare to make any present gaine that they can, though it tend neuer so much to the preiudice and dammage of their children after them: as they who cut downe all the timber and wood that they can, and take out all the heart of their land. 4. Among these may be reckoned such parents as by meere negligence suffer things to goe to decay for want of timely re∣parations: whereby it commeth to passe, that such dammages as in the parents time might haue beene preuented with lay∣ing out a few shillings, cannot be renewed with many pounds. 5. Such also as care not in their life time to cleere the titles of those things which they leaue to their children: but leaue all things so vnsetled and litigious, as it oft costs children more in suit of law to maintaine the inheritance which their parents leaue them, then the inheritance is worth: and yet after all their paines and cost lose the inheritance too: where∣as the parent that knew more then the childe can, might with small paines and charge haue well setled and cleered all. These are mischiefes that many children haue beene brought into by the improuidence of their parents: which are the rather to be made knowne, that such as come after, may proue the more prouident for their children.
§. 66. Of parents impartiall respect to all their children. Hitherto of parents duties. The persons to whom those duties are to be performed, are distinctly to be considered. The parties to whom parents are to performe all the fore∣named duties are expressed vnder this word (Children) which . hath not any speciall respect to prioritie of birth, to constitu∣tion of body, to affection of parent, or any such thing, as if first borne, proper, beautifull, darling, or the like children were only meant, but all that are begotten and borne of pa∣rents, all their children are meant. Whence I obserue, that Parents ought to haue an impartiall respect to all their children, and performe dutie indifferently and equally to all. We haue for proofe hereof Gods patterne, who accounteth all his chil∣dren deare or beloued children. The Greeke word translated . Eph. 5. 1. deare is very emphaticall: it is properly attributed to an only childe: the seuentie that translated the Hebrew Bible into Greeke, doe with this word interpret that phrase, Only Sonne: Gen. 22. 2. . Hesychius  exponit . Plutarchus di∣cit  vocari . for where in Hebrew it is thus said to Abraham, take thy sonne, thine only one, they thus translate it, take thy sonne, thy deare one, or thy beloued one. Other Greeke authors doe so attribute the same word to an only childe, yea also and to an only eie: as when a man hath but one eie they call it a beloued eie. This word then sheweth that God so respecteth all his children, as if all were but one, all a first-borne, all a darling childe. So rare a vertue this impartiall respect is (rare in the excellencie of it, rare also in the scarcitie of it) as thorow∣out the Scripture I can scarce finde a perfect patterne thereof Arist. Rhet. 1. vocat vnicum oculum . among the sonnes of men. Many may be giuen of the con∣trary, as we shall after heare. But the more rare it is, the more we must labour after it, that so we may resemble Gods fatherhood. 1. All our children come from our owne substance and Reasons. bowels. Why then should we respect one childe aboue ano∣ther, more then we doe one eie, or one eare aboue another? We are as tender ouer one as ouer another, though it may be we haue more vse of one then of another. 2. All our children are alike committed to vs by God: the same precepts and directions giuen for all alike: the like ac∣count to be giuen for all. If a King should commit many of
his children to one nurse, would not he be offended (and that iustly) if she should put such a difference betwixt them, through a foolish partialitie, as to respect some, and neglect others? §. 67. Of parents preferring a dutifull childe before a diso∣bedient childe. Obiect. What if one childe be more pious to God and pa∣rent, another more rebellious, may not a parent respect that more then this? 1. Answ. He may take notice of their different carriage, and accordingly reward the one, and punish the other, and yet carrie an equall desire of doing good to both of them alike: for the punishing of the rebellious childe is a parents dutie; an euidence of loue, and a meanes of doing him good. 2. Answ. It is no partialitie to like grace and goodnesse in a childe, and for grace and goodnesse sake to loue his childe so much the more, as also for impietie and obstinacy in rebellion to haue his heart the more alienated from his childe: this is rather a vertue in a parent. Partialitie is when on by and vn∣due respects one childe is preferred before another. §. 68. Of the prerogatiue of the first-borne sonne. Quest. May not a parent preferre his first-borne childe, and heire before his other children? Answ. We must put difference betwixt a fathers disposing his estate vpon his children, and the ordering of his affection towards them. A parents affection, and care of good educa∣tion, and desire of true good, and faithfull praiers to God, may be as great towards his younger children, as towards his eldest sonne and heire, and yet may he bestow the greatest pa∣trimony vpon the heire: which is no partialitie. 2. Quest. Is it then iust and equall that the eldest sonne should haue a greater patrimony then any of the rest? Answ. It is most iust and equall. For 1. God hath so appointed it: yea Deut. 21. 17. he made this to be one of the prerogatiues of the first-borne, to haue a double porti∣on. Vpon this ground 1 Chr. 5. 2. Ioseph, who was the first-borne of the true wife, had a double portion; and as a testimony there∣of his posteritie made two tribes.
2. The lawes of all nations doe order as much. 3. Our law giueth the whole inheritance of freeholds to the eldest sonne: in which respect it is due vnto him. For in ciuill and temporall matters this rule is true, we liue by law. I take it to be a matter of conscience for a parent to leaue that to euery childe which by law is due to him. Neither is it with∣out good reason that the law ordaineth that a parents whole estate of freehold land should descend: for 1. There is an excellency in the first borne, as is euident by Iaakobs speech to his eldest sonne, Gen. 49. 3. thou art my first borne, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power. And thereupon Exod. 13. 2. God tooke the first borne as peculiar to himselfe. 2. Houses and families by this meanes are vpheld and con∣tinued from age to age. How needfull it is for the establish∣ment of a commonwealth that families should thus be conti∣nued, is euident both by experience to all such as haue but halfe an eie to see wherein the stability of a common wealth consist∣eth, and also by the many lawes which God ordained among the Iewes for this purpose: as 1. That Leu. 25. 23. no land should be quite cut off from a family. 2. That Vers. 25. if any through pouerty were forced to sell his land, the next of kin was to buy it. 3. That Vers. 28. if a man that had sold his land, could by no meanes redeeme it againe, at the yeere of Iubilee he was to haue the possession of it againe. 4. That Num. 36. 8. if daughters were heires they should not marry out of their fathers tribe: and this reason is giuen, that euery man may enioy the inheritance of his fathers. Obiect. By leauing the whole inheritance to the eldest, he may be made a Gentleman, and all the other beggars. Answ. In this respect parents ought to be so much the more prouident for their other children, in training them vp to cal∣lings, or laying vp portions, or setling other estates vpon them beside the maine inheritance, or in taking order that comp∣ent portions be raised out of the inheritance of the eldest son, n case God take them away before they haue otherwise pro∣ided for their children.
Out of this answer may a third reason be gathered, to shew that it is a behouefull law for the commonwealth that the heire should haue all the land. For this law maketh parents more carefull in training vp their younger sonnes to sundry callings which are profitable to a commonwealth. If euery childe should haue a part of his fathers lands, they would all so depend thereupon, as none of them would exercise them∣selues to such callings as are meanes of mens maintenance. §. 69. Of parents partiality towards some children. Contrary to the forenamed duty of a parents equall respect to all his children, is partiality in fathers and mothers, mani∣fested sundry waies. For 1. Many parents haue their darling children, to whom so Iniquissima vo∣lucris aquila in educanda sua prole dicitur esse. Pullorum enim alterum alis percussum abigit: alterum solum vti suum educat. Basil. Hexaem. hom. 8. much affection is shewed, as in comparison none is shewed to others. When some are hugged in the bosome, others are neg∣lected as if they were none of their owne, but basely borne. The vnnaturalnesse of the eagle is noted in this kinde, that she flaps and driues out of the nest one of her young ones, and fee∣deth only the other as her owne. From such partiality in pa∣rents proceed many mischiefes: as these, 1. They giue occasion to such as obserue it, to suspect that those children who are so little respected, are none of their owne. 2. They cause enuy, malice, and much contention to arise among children. When Iosephs brethren saw that their father Gen. 37. 4. loued him more then all them, they hated him, and could not speake peaceably vnto him. 3. They prouoke God to inflict some iudgement on those children that are so cockered, and preferred before the rest: that so they may the better see their folly. This sinne of parents partiality is so much the greater, when vpon outward respects they preferre the wicked and vngodly children before pious and gracious children. Isaak herein much failed, for Gen. 25. 28. he loued Esau (a Heb. 12. 16. profane wretch) because he did eat of his Venison. 2. Other parents so set themselues to raise their house, as a their care is to aduance their eldest sonne, by education, by liberall allowance, and by leauing all they haue to him: and i
the meane while neglect their younger children. Though (as was noted §. 68. before) the maine inheritance may iustly without shew of partiality be left to the heire, yet to be carefull only for him, and to neglect the other, sauoureth ranke of partiality. It is most agreeable to naturall reason, that as life is giuen to all Consentaneum est rationi na∣turae vt aequè tribuere cui{que} vitam, sic etiam viuendi facul∣tates praestare. Basil. loc. citat. children, so meanes of maintaining life should be giuen to all. 3. In the number of partiall parents may they be reckoned, who vniustly disinherit their first borne. For the inheritance of right belonging to them, and they not deseruing to be dis∣inherited, assuredly it is some by respect or other which ma∣keth parents prefer the younger before the elder: and this is plaine partiality. This kinde of partiality is commonly in such parents as haue had children by seuerall wiues. Sometimes dis∣like of a former wife maketh a father dislike the children he hath by her, and through dislike to disinherit the heire by her. God gaue the Iewes an expresse law against this kinde of Deu. 21. 15. &c. partiality. Sometimes againe a gripulous seeking of aduantage to themselues maketh parents to disinherit the right heire: as when a man after he hath buried the mother of his first borne, hearing of another woman which is of great wealth, maketh sute for her. She refuseth because he hath an heire of a former wife. He to remoue that blocke entereth couenant to make the sonne which he hath by her (if he haue any) his heire: here∣upon the mariage is consummate: his second wife bringeth forth a sonne: he for his couenant sake disinheriteth the first heire. An vniust, and vnlawfull practise. §. 70. Of the causes for which the first-borne may be disinhe∣rited. Quest. May not then a first-borne sonne be disinherited? Answ. Yes, The Scripture noteth two causes wherein the first-borne may be put from the inheritance. 1. If he be illegitimate: for such an one hath no good ti∣tle: The sonne of the bondwoman shall not be heire with my sonne, Gen. 21. 10. saith Sarah, and that iustly. To like purpose say the sons of Gi∣leads wife to Iephthah, Thou shalt not inherit in our fathers house, Iudg. 11. 2. for thou art the sonne of a strange woman. Iust was that blame which Iotham laid vpon the men of Shechem for making Abi∣melech Iudg. 9. 18.
the base sonne of Ierubbaal King: and iust was Gods vengeance vpon them for that wrong done to Ierubbaals legi∣timate children. 2. If he be notoriously wicked. Thus Gen. 49. 4. 1 Chro. 5. 1. Ruben for commit∣ting abominable incest lost his birthright. Many particular crimes are reckoned vp by the Sum. Syluest. part. 1. Tract▪ de haered. ciuill Law∣yers, which would be too long here to recite. §. 71. Of the dutie of fathers and mothers in law. The extent of this title (Fathers) is in the last place to be Who are in place of pa∣rents. considered. Not only naturall parents themselues, but also all that are in their place are comprised vnder it. As they who are in the place of parents, 1. By the bond of mariage. 2. By propinquity of bloud. 3. By voluntary appointment. The first sort are fathers and mothers in law: who are so reckoned either by the mariage of parents themselues, or by the mariage of their children. That man or woman which is maried to a parent that had children before their mariage, is in the place of a naturall pa∣rent: thus Ioseph was a Luke 2. 48. father to Iesus, and Gen. 25. 1. Keturah a mother to Isaak. So againe the naturall parents of that sonne that hath maried a wife, or of that daughter that is maried to an husband, are in the place of parents to the wife of their sonne, and to the husband of their daughter. Thus Exod. 18. 1. Iethro was a fa∣ther to Moses, and Ruth 3. 1. Naomi a mother to Ruth. All these are to account their children in law (that is, the Parents in law to per∣forme like du∣ties as naturall parents. children of their husband and wife, or the wiues of their sons, and the husbands of their daughters) as their owne naturall children, and according to the age and place of these children to performe the forenamed duties, and euery way to seeke their good (except in such duties as after a peculiar manner belong to naturall parents, as nursing to a naturall mother, leauing the inheritance to a naturall parent.) For a patterne hereof take the forenamed examples of Ioseph and Naomi. What naturall parents could doe more for their owne children then Ioseph did for Iesus, and Naomi for Ruth? The history noteth how Ioseph tooke care to haue his wiues
childe Luk. 2. 21, 22. circumcised, and presented in the temple: how he Mat. 2. 14. fled from place to place to preserue the childs life: how Luk. 2. 48. perplexed he was when he thought the childe was lost: how he Uers. 51. trained him vp in his owne house. The history also no∣teth how Ruth 1. 22. Naomi brought Ruth her sonnes wife into her own countrey, and retained her with her selfe, and & 2. 22. directed her whither to goe, and & 3. 1. what husband to haue, and & 4. 16. became a nurse to her childe. 1. Mariage maketh man and wife one flesh: in which re∣spect Reasons. they ought to haue one minde, and the same affections, as mutually each to other, so ioyntly to the children of each other. On which ground also the husband and wife of a childe, being one flesh with the childe, ought as the childe to be respected. On this ground God counteth the Saints his Eph. 5. 1. . deare children, because they are 2 Cor. 11. 2. espoused to his naturall son. 2. To respect the children of an husband or wife as their owne, is a great euidence of intire loue to the husband and wife. And to respect the husband and wife of a childe is a great euidence of loue to the childe it selfe. If the worlds pro∣uerbe hold true (loue me and loue my dog) how much more true is this Christian rule, loue me and loue my childe: or loue me and loue mine husband: or loue me and loue my wife. 3. This also is an especiall meanes to kindle and preserue mutuall loue betwixt man and wife, who haue children of former husbands and wiues: as also betwixt parents and children. §. 72. Of the peruerse cariage of fathers and mothers in law to their children. Contrary is the cariage of most fathers and mothers in law: especially of those who are maried to husbands or to wiues that had children before mariage: so farre they are from per∣forming the forenamed duty, as rather they enuy at the pro∣sperity of their husbands and wiues children: and secretly endeuour to hinder it in what they can: and cunningly leeke to alienate the naturall parents affection from them: whence Senecae Hip∣polytus. fearefull tragedies haue beene made, and lamentable mis∣chiefes haue followed. What other reason can be giuen here∣of Ouid. Meta∣morph. l. 15. sab. 45. but a plaine instigation of the deuill, who thus laboureth to
disunite those whom God hath ioyned together? For auoi∣ding this snare note the mischiefes that follow from thence. 1. Such parents sinne against Gods ordinance: and as Eue, leane more to Satans suggestion then to Gods direction. 2. They alienate the hearts and affections of one from another: not only from their children, but from themselues. 3. They prouoke their children in law to contemne and despise them, and to yeeld no duty vnto them. Hence note into what an hell vnkinde fathers and mothers in law doe cast themselues. If this were duly weighed, I thinke they would be otherwise minded. But the god of this world doth so blinde their eies with selfe-loue, and with enuy, that they cannot see the mischiefes whereinto they implunge themselues. This is a point the more to be weighed, because the fault here taxed is so common, and hath in all ages beene too com∣mon. Lurida terri∣biles miscent aconita nouer∣cae. Ouid. Me∣tam. l. 1. fab. 4. What grieuous complaints haue in former times beene made, and still are made by children against fathers and mo∣thers in law? Whence also direfull imprecations haue fol∣lowed. Let widowers and widowes that haue children seriously thinke of it before hand: and be the more circum∣spect in taking a second or third husband or wife: and after they are maried let them take heed of Satans snares: and let conscience of dutie more preuaile with them, then corruption of nature. §. 73. Of the faults of parents to their childrens husbands and wiues. Many parents to the husbands and wiues of their children doe also much transgresse and swarue from their dutie: for 1. They will shew much more respect to their owne chil∣dren then to the children of their husbands or wiues: as by comming to their daughters when their husbands are abroad, and neuer but then: and sending for their sonnes to their house, but not for their wiues. 2. In all differences they will take part with their owne children, though it be in the worse part, and shew great par∣tiality. 3. They will oft giue very ill counsell: aduising their sons
to keepe their wiues short: aduising their daughters not to be too subiect to their husbands, yea priuily to purloine from their husbands. 4. If they liue with their children, they will so prie into euery thing that their childrens husband or wife doth, and shew such suspicion and iealously in euery thing, as they can∣not but cause much discord: and hence it oft commeth to passe, that either parent and childe, or husband and wife must be parted: they cannot all in peace liue together. These faults I thus note, that they may the more carefully be auoided. §. 74. Of their dutie who are in stead of parents to Orphants. The next sort of those who are in stead of parents, are those who in bloud and kindred are next to parents: as grand∣fathers, grand-mothers, vncles, aunts, elder brothers, or sisters, their husbands or wiues, and cosins. These commonly are counted to be in the place of parents, The next of kin to Or∣phants to be as naturall parents. when God taketh away naturall and immediate parents from their children: so as they are parents to Orphants. The duties which were prescribed to naturall parents ap∣pertaine to them (except §. 71. before excepted.) Their dutie is to see these Orphants well educated, well placed in some good calling, well maried, and (if the Orphants be left destitute of meanes) well prouided for. Mordecai is a worthy president and patterne for this kinde of parents. Est. 2. 7. He brought vp Esther his vncles daughter (for she had neither father nor mother) he tooke her for his owne daughter: when she was taken from him, Vers. 11. he went to know how she did, and what should become of her: and Vers. 20, 22. Chap. 4. vers. 13. he gaue her aduice from time to time how to carrie her selfe. Let such as are pa∣rents to Orphants take this example as a direction, and as a motiue to performe the other duties prescribed to naturall parents as need requireth, and occasion is offered. God by his prouidence taking away naturall parents com∣mitteth their Orphants as a charge to the next of kin: that as their naturall parents brought them forth, these should bring them vp: therefore for their recompence let them looke to God, (who taketh vpon himselfe to be Psal. 68. 5. a father of the father∣lesse)
and for their incouragement remember the reward which Mordecai receiued of the Lord: yea also let them remember the blessing that God bestowed vpon Esther. God doth oft so blesse the meanes vsed for the education of Orphants, as they who take the care thereof haue no cause to repent their paines and cost, but rather haue much matter of comfort, ioy and thanksgiuing. §. 75. Of the common neglect of Orphants. Too too common is the contrary disposition of most kins∣men, and kinswomen; they thinke they are bound to none but their owne children, and if they haue no children, to none at all. Many are of Ruths kinsmans minde, they feare to marre Ruth 4. 6. their owne inheritance. Though they be themselues exceeding rich, and spend much in apparell, pastimes and house-keeping, yet they can suffer the Orphants of their poore kindred to want, and to beg for need. This is it that maketh the losse of naturall parents to be so much the greater. And herein many Christians are more in∣humane then the heathen: which the Apostle implieth, where he faith, they are worse then infidels: for Orphants next of kinne 1 Tim. 5. 8. are to be reckoned among those whom the Apostle termeth a mans . OVVNE. §. 76. Of the dutie of Guardians. The last sort of those who are in place of parents, are such as haue the charge of children committed to them by voluntary appointment of parents, or are chosen by children themselues, or by the magistrate when parents are dead, or lunatike, or any other way impotent, and vnable to traine vp their owne children. Of these care and conscience is rather required, then cost and charges: for commonly both their charges are allowed, and their paines recompenced. They who by reason of the death or impotency of naturall parents haue the charge of children committed to them, are commonly called Guardians: of whom two generall duties are required. 1. That they looke to their Pupils good education. 2. That they preserue their patrimony and inheritance.
For their education, the directions giuen before to naturall pa∣rents are to be obserued by them. For preseruation of their patrimonie, they must doe for their Pupils what they would doe for their owne children; and so carry themselues, as with good conscience they may giue that ac∣count to their Pupils, or any other, which the law requireth. The two forenamed duties, are the rhaine ends for which Guardians are chosen: in performing whereof, if they be faithfull, great redresse will be made of the vntimely death of parents; and notwithstanding parents die before their children be of discretion to manage their estate, yet will their houses and families be main∣tained, and young heires kept from cunnie-catchers and cheaters. It is noted of Iohn, who had the mother of Iesus commended Ioh. 19. 27. to him, that he tooke her to his owne home: whereby is implied his prouident care for her good. §. 77. Of the fraud of Guardians. Contrary is the practise of most Guardians, who take Pupils Tutela ad vtili∣tatem eorum qui commissi sunt, non ad co∣rum quibus commissa, ge∣renda est. Cic. Offic. l. 1. for their owne aduantage, and make a prey of them. The heathen could say, that Guardianship is to be performed for the benefit of the Pupill, and not of the Guardian. Yet among Christians is the forenamed fault of Guardians. 1. There are few children (that haue not naturall parents to looke to their good education) but are exceedingly neglected therein, and brought vp very rudely and licentiously: yea many times too sparingly and iggardly for diet, apparell, and other needfull things, though they haue sufficient to discharge all that shall be laid out vpon them. 2. The maine estate & patrimonie of many Pupils is much im∣paired: and if they haue lands, as much waste is made vpon them as possibly can be: and when a reckoning is to be giuen, it shall be a large, vniust, and most vnconscionable reckoning of the Guardian can but get a generall release, it is all that the caueth for. 3. Mariages are after a for forced vpon many Pupils: and such matches put vpon them as they cannot like; yea such as are no way fit for them, neither for estate, nor yeeres, nor proportion of bodie, nor qualities of minde. Little doe these Guardians thinke of that account where unto they shall be brought an other day before the Lord, who stileth
himselfe the Psal. 10. 14. helper of the fatherlesse, and who beholdeth mis∣chiefe to requite it. Fearefull is that iudgement which the Lord hath Exo. 22. 22, &c. threatned against those that oppresse the fatherlesse. Let not therefore vniust Guardians thinke, that the gaine they get wrong∣fully from their Pupils shall prosper: but rather let them looke for Gods curse vpon their owne children, and goods. If such as parents themselues haue vpon their death-beds com∣mitted their children vnto, in confidence of their faithfulnesse, shall deale deceitfully with their Pupils, their sinne is doubled, and trebled. For 1. They violate the bond of friendship, faithfulnesse, and trust reposed vpon them. 2. They sinne directly against iustice. 3. Most monstrously they transgresse the rules of charitie. §. 78. Of the dutie of Schoolemasters and Tutors. Among those who are by voluntarie appointment set in the place of parents, are Schoolemasters and Tutors to be reckoned. The authoritie and charge of a parent is for a time committed to them: therefore for that time they ought to performe a parents dutie. Their dutie is appropriated to education: it appertaineth not to them to maintaine the children committed to them: they are rather themselues by their paines that way maintained. All the duties which were before comprised vnder nurture, belong to Schoolemasters and Tutors. More particularly they are to instruct children in three things. 1. In learning. 2. In ciuilitie, and good manners. 3. In true pietie, and religion. I shall not need to speake more of these points then hath §. 28, 34. be∣fore beene deliuered: only to prouoke them to be diligent in well nurturing children in those three points, let the benefit of good Schoolemasters and Tutors be well noted. Schoolemasters commonly cast the first seed into the hearts of The benefit of a good Schoolmaster. children: they first season them: as the seed is, such will the crop be: as the first seasoning is, so will the sauour continue to be. If they sowe no good seed at all, what haruest can be looked for? If they sowe a corrupt seed of rudenesse, licentiousnesse, profane∣nesse,
superstition, and any wickednesse, the crop must needs be answerable thereto. But if they sowe the good seed of learning, ciuilitie, and pietie, there is great hope of a good crop. Hence it followeth that they are of great vse, and may bring much good, not only to the children themselues, and their pa∣rents, Scholas & phrontisteria virorum & mulierum phi∣losophiae ethnicae addictorum constru it. Ni∣cep. eccl. hist. l. 10. c. 21. The benefit of a good Tutor. but also to the Church and Common-wealth. Iulian the Apostat was not ignorant hereof: and therefore endeuouring to root Christianitie out of the world, he suffered no man that pro∣fessed himselfe a Christian, to teach a schoole: but in stead of Christian Schoolemasters, he set vp in euery part of his domini∣ons, heathenish Schoolemasters. Tutors, to whose gouernment young schollers, that are sent to the Vniuersities, are committed, haue to deale with children in their riper yeeres; euen when the time of setling them in a course is come: the very time wherein much good may be done to chil∣dren, or else wherein they may be vtterly peruerted. There will be little hope of bowing them, and drawing them into another course after they be freed from the gouernment of a Tutor. Tu∣tors therefore, as they haue need of great wisdome, so of good conscience, that they may haue the greater care of their Pupils, and take the greater paines in teaching them the three forenamed points, learning, ciuilitie, and pietie. A good Tutor may doe much to repaire the negligence, and amend the defects of a Schoole∣master: but there remaine none to redresse the failings of a Tu∣tor: children for the most part are past redressing, when they cease to haue a Tutor. §. 79. Of the negligence of Schoolemasters and Tutors. The vices contrary to the forenamed dutie of Schoolemasters, are these. 1. Unskilfulnesse. Many that are more fit to be taught then to teach, take vpon them this weightie calling. Some haue not suffi∣cient learning: some againe are rude, and know not themselues good manners: and some know not the first principles of the ora∣cles of God. No good can be expected from these. 2. Couetousnesse. All that many seeke, is to multiply the num∣ber of their schollers, and to get as much as they can for boording, and teaching: they aime more at their owne gaine then at their schollers profit. Children are not like to thriue well vnder them.
3. Negligence. Many are loth to take the paines of a Schoole∣master, and thereupon come as little into the schoole as they can: take euery small occasion to be gone againe: care not how much their children play: if they be able to hire a poore Vsher, all the burden shall be cast vpon him. Little is that fruit that can be looked for from them. 4. Want of pietie. Many skilfull and painfull Schoolemasters, vnder whose teaching children come forward exceeding well in learning, thinke it nothing appertaineth to them to teach the grounds of religion, so as they altogether neglect pietie. Assuredly they want it themselues: for were their owne hearts seasoned with true pietie, their consciences would moue them to teach it to their children. The things of the kingdome of God are like vnto eauen, which seasoneth the whole batch of dough with that sea∣son and sauour which it selfe hath. When children spend almost all their time with their Schoolemasters, of whom should they learne it, if not of them? What blessing can be hoped from the paines of such Schoolemasters? I might to these adde the ouer-much remisnesse of some (whereby children get too great an head) and the too great seue∣ritie of others, either in frequencie of correcting, as if they de∣lighted therein; or in the measure thereof, as if they had to doe with beasts, whereby they affright children, make them dull, yea and impudent also. But these extremes were §. 48, 49. before handled. The common fault of Tutors is altogether to neglect their Pu∣pils. Many thinke a Tutor to be a meeretitular matter: no more to be required of them but to beare the very name; and to vn∣dertake that the Colledge be discharged for their Pupils diet. This conceit, and the practise answerable thereunto, is the blemish and bane of the Vniuersities. Many children well trained vp in schooles, vtterly lose the benefit of all their former education when they are sent to the Vniuersitie, because their Tutors altoge∣ther leaue them to themselues: and so they are made a prey to idle and lewd companions. By reason hereof many parents are vtterly discouraged to send their children to the Vniuersitie.
The seuenth Treatise. Duties of Seruants. §. 1. A Resolution of the Apostles direction to Seruants. EPHES. 6. 5. Seruants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh, with feare and trembling in singlenesse of your heart, as vnto Christ. 6. Not with eie-seruice, as men-pleasers, but as the seruants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. 7. With good will doing seruice, as to the Lord, and not to men. 8. Knowing that whatsoeuer good thing any man doth, the same shall he receiue of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. THe third and last couple of a family are— Masters. Seruants.   The direction which the Apostle giueth to seruants, is in this text set downe. Therein he 1. Declareth their duties. 2. Addeth motiues to per∣forme them.  
I. In declaring seruants duties he noteth— 1. The kindes of them. 2. The manner     3. The extent     1. The kindes of seruants duties are noted in two words,— Obey, vers. 5. Serue, vers. 7.   2. The manner is set downe Affirmatiuely, vers. 5, 7. Negatiuely, vers. 6, 7.   1. Affirmatiuely by shewing what graces are requisite: to which purpose he reckoneth vp foure particulars. 1. Feare and trembling. 2. Singlenesse of heart. 3. Conscience to Christ. 4. Good will. Vnder which are comprised— 1. Cheerfulnesse. 2. Readinesse.   3. Diligence.   4. Faithfulnesse.   2. Negatiuely, by shewing what vices are to be auoided, and these are two especially, 1. Eie-seruice, which is oppo∣sed to doing of things— as Christs seruants. from the heart.   2. Men-pleasing, which is opposed to doing the will of God. 3. The extent of seruants duties is noted in these foure phrases,— 1. Masters after the flesh, vers. 5. 2. As to Christ, vers. 5.   3. As seruants of Christ, vers. 6.   4. Doing Gods will, vers. 6.   II. The motiues which the Apostle vseth are partly— Implied. Expressed.   They are implied three waies. 1. By declaring the place of a Master (as to Christ.) 2. By noting out the honour of their seruice (as seruants of Christ.) 3. By shewing the ground of seruants subiection (Gods will.) The motiue expressed is the Recompence which seruans shall haue for their paines largely laid forth, vers. 8. Therein these distinct points are noted in order. 1. The assurance thereof (knowing.) 2. The ground thereof, taken from a generall rule (what∣soeuer good thing any man doth.)
3. The particular application thereof (whether bond or free.) 4. The kinde thereof (the same shall he receiue.) 5. The author and giuer thereof (of the Lord.) §. 2. Of the lawfulnesse of a masters place and power. In handling seruants duties I will proceed according to the order propounded. In the first place therefore I will note out the kindes of seruants duties. For finding out the kindes, I will obserue the method fol∣lowed in handling childrens duties. Note then 1. The Fountaine of seruants duties. 2. The Streames that issue from thence. The Fountaine resteth partly in the opinion, and partly in the affection of seruants. In their Opinion they must be informed and resolued that the Seruants must be informed of the lawful∣nesse of a ma∣sters autho∣ritie. place of a master and a seruant is lawfull and warrantable: that God ingenerall ordained degrees of superioritie and infe∣rioritie, of authority and subiection: and in particular gaue to masters the authoritie which they haue, and put seruants in that subiection wherein they are. Till the iudgement be re∣solued hereof, nor reuerence, nor obedience will be yeelded as it ought. For Reuerence hath reference to Eminencie and superioritie: and Obedience to Authoritie and power. Who will reuerence or obey him whom he taketh to be his equall? This was the ground of the conspiracie of Corah, Dathan and Abiram, that they thought Numb. 16. 3. Moses and Aaron tooke too much vpon them, and lift themselues vp aboue the congregation of the Lord. Wherefore I will here note the grounds of a masters authoritie, and seruants subiection. Grounds of masters and seruants pla∣ces. 1. God hath giuen expresse commandement vnto masters to gouerne their seruants: and vnto seruants to be subiect to their masters. Exo. 20. 10. In the fourth commandement God giueth a charge to masters ouer their seruants, to see that they doe no manner of worke. And the Angell biddeth Hagar Gen. 16. 9. humble her selfe vnder her mistresse hands. And here seruants are com∣manded to obey their masters. 2. Many directions are giuen both to masters and seruants in regard of their different places how to carry themselues one
to another. Read for this purpose the many lawes which Mo∣ses prescribed to both: the many counsels which Solomon, in his prouerbs especially, giueth also to both: and particularly the directions of this and other Apostles. 3. Saints in all ages haue beene set in these places: some in the places of masters, and some in the places of seruants: and according to the place wherein God hath set them, they haue performed their dutie: masters the duties of masters, and ser∣uants the duties of seruants. 4. The many parables which Christ vseth taken from the power which masters haue and exercise ouer their seruants, and the subiection which seruants yeeld to their masters, shew that the authoritie of the one, and subiection of the other, are things without question granted and not denied. 5. God hath made many promises of reward both to ma∣sters, and seruants, that conscionably performe the duties of their place: and hath made many threatnings against the one and the other that are negligent therein. All these grounds are so cleerely and plentifully noted in the Scripture, that any one who is any whit acquainted there∣with may know them to be so. Were there no other argu∣ments then this text which I haue in hand, it were enough to confound all gainsaiers: and to moue such as beleeue the ra∣ther Serui cum cre∣diderint plus dominis carna∣libus seruire de∣bent. Cypr. Testim. l. 3. c. 72 See Treat. 1. §. 123. for their faith and profession sake to serue their masters af∣ter the flesh. §. 3 Of the Anabaptists arguments against the authoritie of masters, and subiection of seruants. Contrary to this first ground of seruants subiection is the opinion of Anabaptists, who teach that all are alike, and that there is no difference betwixt masters and seruants. Their rea∣sons, whereby they would make shew to proue their vnreaso∣nable opinion, are these. 1. Obiect. Masters are either Infidels or Christians, and so ser∣uants either one or other. If masters be Infidels, and seruants Christians, how vnmeet is it that Christians should be sub∣iect to Infidels? and if master and seruant be both Christi∣ans, they are brothers: but brothers are equalls, and neither subiect to other.
Answ. Rule and subiection are matters of outward policy, they tend to the outward preseruation of Church, Common∣wealth, and family, in this world: but faith, piety, and such gra∣ces are inward matters of the soule, tending to a better life. These being thus different, one that is more excellent in the one, may be inferiour in the other. Yea though there be an equality in the one, namely, in spirituall things, yet there may be a disparity in the other, namely, in ciuill and temporall mat∣ters. And though Saints may be farre inferiour to infidels in outward estate, yet they are not a whit the lesse glorious before God. The honour proper and peculiar to Saints is inward, not visible to the carnall eye of a naturall man. 2. Obiect. It is against nature for one to be seruant, especi∣ally a bond-seruant to another. Prima seruitu∣tis causa pecca∣tum est, &c. Verum & poe∣nalis seruitus ea lege ordinatur, qua naturalem ordinem conser∣uari iubet, &c. Aug. de Ciu. Dei l. 19. c. 15. Answ. To grant that it is against that absolute and perfect nature wherein at first God created man, and that it came in by sinne, yet is it not against that order and course of nature wherein God hath now setled man. God hath turned many punishments of sinne to be bounden duties; as subiection of wife to husband, and mans eating bread in the sweat of his brow. 3. Obiect. It is the prerogatiue of Christians to be Gal. 3. 28. all one: but subiection of seruants to masters is against that prero∣gatiue. Answ. That prerogatiue is meerely spirituall: for in Christ all are one, as they are members of Christ, which is a spirituall body: not as they are members of a politique body. A poli∣tipue inequality is not against a spirituall equality. 4. Obiect. This subiection is against the Gal. 5. 1. liberty that Christ hath purchased for vs, and wherewith he hath made vs free. Answ. It is not. For that liberty is from the curse and rigor of the morall law: from the ceremoniall law and the rites there∣of: from Satan, sinne, death, and damnation: but not from those degrees which God hath established betwixt man and man, for the good of mankinde. 5. Obiect. We are expresly forbidden to be 1 Cor. 7. 23. seruants of men. Answ. To be a seruant in that place is not simply to be in sub∣iection See Treat. 1. §. 124, 125, 126. vnder another, and to doe seruice vnto him, but to be
so obsequious to a man, so addicted to please him, and so sub∣iect to his will, as to doe whatsoeuer he will haue done: to re∣gard nothing but his pleasure: to prefer it before Gods word and will. It is not therefore the thing it selfe, but an excesse therein which is there forbidden. §. 4. Of a seruants feare of his master. The other part of that fountaine, from whence the duties Seruants ought to feare their masters. of seruants flow, resteth in the affection: and it is in one word Feare: which is an awfull dread of a master. An awe in regard of his masters place: a dread in regard of his masters power. An awe is such a reuerend esteeme of his master, as maketh him ac∣count his master worthy of all honour: which 1 Tim. 6. 1. S. Paul expresly inioyneth seruants to doe. A dread is such a feare of prouo∣king his masters wrath, as maketh him thinke and cast euery way how to please him. This is it which the Apostle here in∣timateth vnder these two words, feare and trembling. In both these respects S. Peter commandeth seruants to be subiect in al feare. 1 Pet. 2. 18. So proper is this feare to a seruant in relation to his master, as where it is wanting, there is a plaine deniall of his masters place and power; which God intimateth vnder this expostu∣lation, If I be a master, where is my feare? that is, you plainely Mal. 1. 6. shew that you account me not your master, because in your heart there is no feare of me. This feare will draw seruants on, cheerefully to performe all duty: the more it aboundeth, the more desire and endeuour there will be to please, and to giue good contentment (and this is a point commanded to seruants, to please well in all things:) Tit. 2. 9. yea it will glad the heart of a seruant to see his seruice prosper well: hereof we haue a worthy patterne in Abrahams seruant, Gen. 24. whose care to doe his businesse, as his master would haue it, and prayer for Gods assistance therein, and thanks for Gods bles∣sing thereon, sheweth an awefull respect which he bare to his master. Againe, on the other side, this feare will keepe men from of fending their masters (which was one reason that moued Io∣seph not to yeeld to his mistresse) and in this respect it may Gen. 39. 8.
preuent many mischiefes which their masters offence and wrath might bring vpon them. One especiall meanes to breed and preserue this feare in ser∣uants, is, a due consideration of the ground of their masters Direction. place and power: which is Gods appointment: God hath placed them in his stead, and in part giuen them his power: they are the Deputies and Ministers of God, and therefore in Scripture the title ( Gen. 24. 9. . Eph. 6. 5. Lord) is after a peculiar manner giuen to them. What maketh subiects stand in awe of inferiour Magi∣strates? Is it not because they beare the Kings person, and haue authority and power giuen vnto them of the King? §. 5. Of the extremes contrary to seruants feare of their ma∣sters. Two extremes are contrary to this seruant-like feare. 1. In the excesse a slauish feare: when they feare nothing but Slauish feare in seruants. the reuenging power of their master: the staffe or the cudgell, as we speake: so they may auoid that, they care not whither their master be pleased or no. This maketh them oft to wish that their masters had no power ouer them: or that they were dead. This was that feare which possessed the heart of that vnprofitable seruant, who said to his master, I knew thee that Mat. 25. 24, 25. thou art an hard man, and I was afraid. Such seruile seruants will neuer be profitable. 2. In the defect, a light esteeme and plaine contempt of Seruants de∣spising their masters. Mal. 1. 6. masters. That this is contrary to feare is euident by that oppo∣sition which God maketh betwixt them in these words, If I be a master, where is my feare, ô ye that despise my name? As if he had said; Hereby ye shew that ye feare me not as a master, be∣cause ye despise me. This sinne of despising masters is expres∣ly 1 Tim. 6. 2. forbidden: and for it was Gen. 16. 6. Hagar dealt hardly withall. When masters are poore, meane, weake, aged, or otherwise impotent, then proud seruants are prone to despise them: which argueth a base minde, shewing that they respect their masters power more then his place: the poorest and weakest haue the same place and authority ouer seruants, that the rich∣est and strongest haue; all beare Gods image alike: but disdain∣full proud seruants shew that they regard not Gods image at all.
§. 6. Of seruants reuerence in speech. The two maine streames which issue out of the forenamed fountaine, are— Reuerence. Obedience.   Reuerence is manifested in Speech. Cariage.   In Speech by Refraining Speech. Well ordering     Seruants reuerence in refraining speech is manifested 3. waies. 1. By sparing to speake, without iust cause in their masters presence or audi∣ence: This phrase (1 King. 10. 8. they stand continually before thee and heare thy wisdome) spo∣ken of Salomons seruants, sheweth that they were slow to speake and swift to heare in their masters presence. 2. By forbearing to reply when they obserue their masters vnwilling that they should speake any more. Thus did Peter forbeare when his master gaue him this short answer, Iohn 21. 22. What is that to thee? 3. By attending to that which their masters shall deliuer to them: for seruants ought to shew such a respect to their ma∣sters speaking to them, as Samuel did to God, when he said, 1 Sam. 3. 10. Speake for thy ser∣uant heareth. The titles of Lord and Ser∣uant doe shew, that this speech is taken from the duty of seruants. The notation of the . See Treat. 1. §. 96, 124. Greeke word vsed by the Apo∣stle, & translated Obey, implieth as much. This reuerence did Abrahams Gen. 24. 9. seruant shew to his master, when he gaue him a charge about choosing a wife for his son. Seruants for well ordering their speech vnto their masters must obserue fiue cau∣tions. 1. That they haue iust occasion to speake: and that is either when their ma∣sters require them to speake (as Mat. 16. 14. the dis∣ciples) or when they see it behouefull for their masters that they should speake. In such cases speech argueth reuerence, as well as silence in other cases. The generall points which were before deliuered of the reuerence of Treat. 3. §. 13. wiues to their husbands, and of Treat. 5. §. 4. 5. &c. children to their parents, may be applied to ser∣uants: and pressed vpon them as an argument from the lesse to the greater thus, If wiues (who in many things haue a ioynt au∣thority with their husbands) & chil∣dren (who are not in so seruile a de∣gree subiect to their parents, as ser∣uants to their ma∣sters) must mani∣fest their inward feare of their hus∣bands and parents by outward reue∣rence, much more must seruants to their masters. To declare the force of this consequence so much the more, let it be noted that the Apostle ad∣deth another kind When behoue∣full for ser∣uants to speake to masters. of word here, then he did before, ei∣ther in wiues or childrens duties, namely See Treat. 1. §. 124. trembling.
Quest. In what cases may it be be∣houefull for masters that their seruants speake to them? Answ. 1. When they know any thing that may be profitable for their masters, they ought to declare it, though they be not asked: as 2 King. 5. 3. that maide which told her mistresse Naamans wife, that there was a Pro∣phet in Samaria that could deliuer him of his leprosie. 2. When masters through ignorance, passion, or such like cause, refuse to doe that which their seruants know to be good for them, they ought to perswade their masters to doe it; as Naamans seruants perswaded their master to wash himselfe in 2 King. 5. 13. Iordan as the Prophet aduised him. 3. When seruants are not fully instructed in those things which they ought to doe for their master, they ought to aske of him what is to be done, as the disciples who said to their master, where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Mat. 26. 17. passeouer? 4. When some scruple ariseth in their minds about any charge that their master shall giue them, they may inquire of their master, as Abrahams seruant when he said, what if the wo∣man Gen. 24. 5. will not come with me? 5. When their master vniustly suspecteth any euill of them, they may speake to cleere their owne innocency, as Da∣uid 1 Sam. 24. 10. did to Saul. A second caution for seruants well ordering their speech is, Directions for seruants well framing their speech to masters. That the very forme and manner of their speech when they haue iust occasion to speake to their masters, doe sauour of re∣uerence: for which purpose let these particulars be noted. 1. That seruants giue reuerend titles to their ma∣sters. It was in an honourable respect of their master that the ser∣uants
of Naaman, called him Father. In Scripture §. 4. one of 2 King. 5. 13. Gods titles is attributed to masters, as Lord. 2. That their words be few, no more then must needs, euen when they haue occasion to speake: as may be gathered out of the forenamed examples alleaged to shew when seruants might and ought to speake. 3. That all their words spoken to their master be meeke, milde and humble: note for this purpose how the children of the Prophets framed their speech to their master. 2 King. 6. 2. &c. 1. They humbly beg leaue for themselues to goe to Iorden. 2. They intreat him to goe, in these words, vouchsafe I pray thee to goe with thy seruants. 3. When one of them had lost the head of his hatchet, as if he durst not be so bold as to speake to his master to get it him againe, he referreth the thing to his good pleasure, saying, Alas master it was but borrowed. A third caution is, That they obserue a fit season to speake to their master: as when he is at leasure to heare them: (thus it is noted of the disciples that when their master was alone they propounded their questions vnto him) or when his minde is quiet, not Mar. 4. 10. troubled with passion (thus when Dauid obserued that Sauls minde was somewhat pacified towards him, by that speech he vsed, Is this thy voice my sonne Dauid, then he tooke occa∣sion more freely to speake to him.) 1 Sam. 26. 17. A fourth caution is, That they giue a ready and present answer to their master. This is oft commended in Peter, that when Christ propoun∣ded any question to his disciples, he would presently and Mat. 16. 16. Ioh. 6. 68. readily answer. A fift caution is, That all their speeches and answers to their master be true, not daring to tell a lie vnto them: this argueth a very reue∣rend respect of a master. When Eli demanded of Samuel what the Lord had said to him, Samuel told him euery whit and hid nothing from him. And when Dauid bid the woman of Te∣koah 1 Sam. 3. 18. 2 Sam. 14. 18, 19. not to hide the thing that he should aske her from him,
she told him the whole truth. There is a double bond to tie seruants hereunto. 1. Their conscience towards God, who is a God of truth. 2. Their respect to their masters with whom they ought to deale faithfully. Lastly, a seruants reuerence ought to be manifested by his speech of his master euen behinde his backe: speaking good of him, and no euill: this part of reuerence also did Abrahams seruant shew to his master. Thus shall they shew themselues Gen. 24. 35, &c. good, true-hearted, faithfull seruants, and not parasites. §. 7. Of the vices contrary to a seruants reuerence in speech. Offences contrary to the forenamed Reuerence of seruants to their masters are these. 1. Sawcinesse and boldnesse in seruants when they haue no more respect to their masters presence then to any others, but are full of prate, and loud in speech before their master, or in the roome next to him, where they may be heard as well as if they were in the same roome: much offence is thus oft times giuen to masters. 2. Importunity in speaking, and replying againe and againe, though their masters doe not only shew their dislike thereof, but also expresly charge them to speake no more. Scolding maids that will haue the last words of their mistresse much offend herein. This is directly against the Apostles prohi∣bition to seruants, that they answer not againe. Tit. 2. 9. 3. Impatiency, when they cannot endure to heare their master make an end of his speech, but either they will inter∣rupt him, or fling away. 4. Stoutnesse, when (as Solomon noteth) though they vnder∣stand, Pro. 29. 19. they will not speake: though they know very well that it is their masters pleasure they should speake, yea though they are bidden to speake, yet their stout stomach, and sullen heart will not suffer them to speake: no though it be neuer so be∣houefull for their masters: if they know that their master go∣eth on in a course very preiudiciall to him, yet will not they tell him of it: nay if their master vniustly suspect any euill of them, they will let him abide in that iealously rather then speake to cleare themselues: and if their master doe not ex∣presly
appoint them from time to time what to doe, they will neuer aske: nor if they be doubtfull of that which he giueth them in charge, will they further inquire to be resolued there∣of. This kinde of silence, in these and such like cases, argueth more doggednesse then dutifulnesse. 5. Disdaine, when they See §. 5. scorne to giue the title Master to him that is set ouer them, because he is a poore and meane man. 6. Arrogancy, when their words are high and lofty against their master, pretending that they are as good as he, though for a time they be vnder him. Clerkes, prentises, waiting women, and such like, being borne of gentlemen, and men of good degree, are for the most part guilty of this fault: the rea∣son is, because their birth and parentage maketh them forget their present place and condition; or else (which is worse) maketh them wilfully presume aboue it. 7. Muttering and murmuring vpon euery occasion of dis∣content: whereby it commeth to passe that they oft prouoke much wrath (for grieuous words stirre vp anger.) Pro. 15. 1. 8. Vnseasonable interruption of their master: speaking to him when he is seriously occupied in some weighty businesse (as they who told Christ of his mother and brethren when he was preaching) or vnseasonably speaking vnto him while he Mar. 3. 32. is in passion, whereby they oft bring much mischiefe vpon themselues. 9. Answering their master at their owne leisure, suffering him to call, and call againe and againe. This doth Iob complaine of, saying, I called my seruant and he gaue me no answer. Iob 19. 16. 10. Flapping their master in the mouth with a lie: like Gehazi, who, when he had lewdly fetched money and apparell of Naaman, and his master asked him where he had beene, said with a faire face, Thy seruant went no whither. Let the iudge∣ment 2 King. 5. 25. executed on him make all seruants take heed of the like sinne. For Lying is in it selfe an hainous sinne: yet so much the more hainous when it is told to one that hath authority ouer vs, and by reason thereof standeth in Gods place. Lastly, Euill language of their master behinde his backe. This is a sinne, though that which is spoken to a masters disgrace
be true: for the infirmities of a master ought rather to be co∣uered, then reuealed and laid open by a seruant. How mon∣strous a sinne is it then, to raise slanderous reports against a master which are vntrue? This was Zibas sinne against Me∣phibosheth his master. 2 Sam. 16. 3. Hitherto of seruants Reuerence in speech to their masters. Their Reuerence in cariage followeth. §. 8. Of seruants reuerend behauiour to their masters. For manifestation of a seruants reuerence in cariage towards his master, three things are especially required. 1. Dutifull obeysance. 2. Respectfull behauiour. 3. Modest apparell. I. Such dutifull and submissiue obeysance and curtesie, as be∣seemeth their sex and place, and that according to the most vsuall 1. Seruants obeysance to their masters. custome of the country and place where they are, must seruants performe to their masters, as they haue occasion to goe to them, to come from them, to receiue any charge of them, or to bring any message vnto them. Where Isaak saith in his blessing giuen to Iaakob, Be lord ouer thy brethren, and let thy mothers sonnes bowe Gen. 27. 29. downe to thee, by that phrase of bowing downe, he noteth the con∣dition of a seruant, and withall implieth a seruants dutie: on this ground, when the children of the Prophets saw that the spirit of Eliah rested on Elisha, they taking it for an euident signe that God had made him a gouernour and master ouer them, they came to 2 King. 2. 15. meet him, and bowed themselues to the ground before him. II. Answerable to a seruants obeisance must be his whole be∣hauiour 2. Seruants du∣tifull behaui∣our before their masters. before his master, seasoned and ordered with such mode∣stie and humilitie, as may manifest an honourable respect to his master: as 1. To stand in his masters presence; which testifieth a readi∣nesse to performe any seruice which his master shall appoint him to doe: this was one thing noted, and commended by the Queene of Sheba in Solomons seruants: she saw their 1 King. 10. 5, 8. standing, and said, happy are these thy seruants that stand before thee. Whereas it is said that she saw also their sitting, that phrase shew∣eth a seemly order which they obserued euen when they were out of his presence, by giuing and taking their right and due place.
2. By vncouering their heads in their masters presence: this in our dayes, and in the parts of the world where we dwell, is in the male kinde a signe and token of subiection. 3. By sobrietie and modestie both in countenance, and in the whole disposition of bodie, especially when seruants are in their masters presence: for to compose countenance and whole bodie soberly, because of the presence of one, argueth a reuerend respect of that person, for whose sake that sobrietie is shewed. III. The apparell also which seruants weare must be so fa∣shioned 3. Seruants seemly appa∣rell. and ordered, as it may declare them to be seruants, and vnder their masters, and so it will argue a reuerend respect of their masters. One end of apparell, is to shew a difference betwixt su∣periours and inferiours, persons in authoritie and vnder subie∣ction. It pleased the Holy Ghost to note this particular (and their 1. King. 10. 5. apparell) as an obseruable point in Solomons seruants. §. 9. Of the faults of seruants contrary to reuerence in cariage. The cariage of many seruants towards their master is cleane contrary to the forenamed reuerence. For 1. Some through rudenesse, and want of good bringing vp, 1. Rudenesse. come to their masters, and goe from them, as to and from their fellowes: no testimonie of reuerence by any obeysance: they know not how to giue it: whereby they dishonour their parents, and manner of education. 2. Others, if at first comming to their master they giue some 2. Too much familiaritie. salutation, yet, through too much familiaritie with them, all the day after they will carry themselues fellow-like, scarce vncouering their heads in their masters presence, not enduring to stand long before him, but either setting themselues downe, or slinking away when they should be in presence. Doubtlesse from this ouer∣much familiaritie arose this prouerbe, Good morrow for all day. This vnmannerly familiaritie is commonly in such seruants, as haue poore and meane masters: for rich and great mens seruants can be so full of curtesie, as not a word shall be spoken by their masters to them, or by them to their masters, but the knee shall be bowed withall: they can stand houre after houre before their ma∣sters, and not once put on their hat: if they be walking after their masters, their master shall not turne sooner then their hat will be off, and that so oft as he turneth or speaketh to them. Why should
rich masters haue so much reuerence shewed to them, and poore masters none at all? Doe not the poore beare Gods image as well as the rich? Doth Gods word make any difference betwixt rich and poore? Doth it say, Serue rich masters with feare and trem∣bling? Surely it is the corruption of mans heart, which maketh this difference. Seruants naturally more regard their masters out∣ward abilitie, then inward authoritie: the honour which the world conferreth on men, more then the honour which God conferreth: for God hath giuen as much honour and authoritie to a poore master as to a rich, in that he is a master. Seruants commonly most faile in this dutie of reuerence to∣wards their masters there where they should most of all shew it, namely, in the courts of God, and assembly of Gods people, where the very Angels are present to behold our seemly cariage: thus they cause the ministerie of the word to be euill spoken of, and thereby make their sinne so much the more hainous. 3. Exceeding great is the fault of seruants in their excesse in ap∣parell. 3. Pride. No distinction ordinarily betwixt a mans children and seruants: nay none betwixt masters and their men, mistresses and their maids. It may be while men and maids are at their masters and mistresses finding, difference may be made: though euen then also, if they can any way get wherewithall, they will do what they can to be as braue as they can. But if once they be at their owne finding, all shall be laid out vpon apparell, but they will be as fine as master or mistresse: if not so costly, yet in shew as speci∣ous and braue. New fashions are as soone got vp by seruants as by masters and mistresses. What is the end of this, but to be thought as good as master or mistresse? If the Queene of Sheba were now liuing, she would as much wonder at the disorder of seruants in these dayes, as then she wondred at the comely order of Solomons seruants. Let these proud seruants looke to it: for if God haue threatned to visit Princes children that walke in strange apparell, Zeph. 1. 8. can seruants that so walke thinke to goe scot-free? Thus much of seruants reuerence. Their obedience followeth. §. 10. Of seruants obedience. No inferiours are more bound to obedience then seruants: it
is their maine, and most peculiar function, to obey their masters. It is therefore here in my text expresly mentioned (Seruants obey your masters) and all other duties are comprised vnder it. Treat. 3. §. 17. The reasons alleadged to moue wiues and children to obey, ought much more to moue seruants. Treat. 5. §. 11. They who are contrary minded, who are rebellious, and dis∣daine to be vnder the authority of another, and are ready to say of their Master, We will not haue this man to reigne ouer vs, are fit∣ter Luke 19. 14. to liue among Anabaptists, then orthodoxall Christians. For to what end is the lawfulnesse of authoritie acknowledged, if sub∣iection be not yeelded vnto it? of the two a man were better be blinded with error, then not obey the truth which he knoweth. In handling this point of obedience, I will follow the same order, which I did in laying forth the obedience of wiues and children, and consider 1. The parts of seruants obedience wherein it consisteth. 2. The extent thereof, how farre it reacheth. The parts are two, One negatiue. Another affirmatiue. The negatiue is to abstaine from doing things of their owne head, without or against their masters consent. The affirmatiue is readily to yeeld to doe that which their ma∣sters would they should doe. §. 11. Of seruants forbearing to doe things without their masters consent. Seruants ought to forbeare doing of things on their owne heads without or against consent of their masters, because while the time of their seruice lasteth, they are not their owne, neither ought the things which they doe, to be for themselues: both their persons and their actions are all their masters: and the will of their master must be their rule and guide (in things which are not against Gods will.) The rite vsed vnder the Law of boaring a seruants eare, implied as much. Dauid therefore alluding vnto Exo. 21. 6. that rite, saith to God (both of himselfe, and also of Christ, whom vnder a type he prefigured) mine eares hast thou boared; and from thence inferreth that he would do the will of God. We haue Psal. 40. 6. a notable patterne hereof in Abrahams seruant, who in a busi∣nesse committed to his charge propounds such scruples as came Gen. 24. 5.
into his head to receiue direction from his master therein, lest he should be forced to doe something of his owne head without par∣ticular warrant from his master. This generall will the better be cleared, if it be exemplified in some particulars. Take therefore these instances gathered out of the Scriptures of things which seruants may not doe without their masters consent. 1. Seruants may not goe whither they will. The phrase which the Centurion vseth (I say to one goe, and he goeth) implieth, that except his master bid him goe, he ought not to goe. Mat. 8. 9. 2. They ought not to doe their owne businesse and affaires. It is noted of Iaakob being Labans seruant, that, though he Gen. 30. 35, 36. had flockes of his owne, yet he fed his masters flockes, and committed his owne to his sonnes. 3. They ought not to doe what businesse they list them∣selues. Ahimaaz had a great desire to carrie the newes of Ab∣soloms 2 Sam. 18. 19, &c. death to Dauid: yet without the leaue of Ioab his Cap∣taine and master he would not doe it. The good mistresse giueth the portion to her maides, namely, the portion of worke: Pro. 31. 15. that therefore must they doe which she giueth them to doe. The seruants of the Centurion did euery one as by their ma∣ster Mat. 8. 9. Mat. 25. 16, 17. they were inioyned: and the seruants that had talents committed to them looked each of them to their owne talent. 4. They ought not to mary while the time of their coue∣nant for seruice lasteth, vnlesse their master giue consent there∣to. The law of God thus setteth forth the lawfull mariages of seruants, If his master haue giuen him a wife: whereby is im∣plied; Exo. 21. 4. that if a seruant mary, it must be with his masters consent. Obiect. The Apostle, without exception of seruants saith, to auoid fornication let euery man haue his wife, &c. 1 Cor. 7. 2. Answ. He there sheweth what meanes the Lord hath sancti∣fied to euery one to auoid fornication, but he doth not thereby giue libertie to euery one headily to vse that meanes against that order which God hath set downe. 2. That precept is giuen to such as are Sui iuris. in their owne power: for of children he saith, that 1 Cor. 7. 36, &c. parents must see what is meet or not meet for them.
3. That which seruants are to gather from thence is, if need so require, to make knowne their desire to their master, and to vse all the good meanes they can by themselues or others to obtaine their masters consent. 5. They ought not to dispose their masters goods at their owne pleasure, no not for charitable vses. The Steward which Luk. 16. 1, 2. wasted his masters goods was iustly put out of office for it. Yea he is called vniust for disposing some of them for his owne vers. 8. future maintenance; therefore it was a point of iustice and vnlawfull. Obiect. The Lord commended him therein. Answ. He commended his wisdome, not his iniustice: his prouident care for the time to come, not the meanes of proui∣ding for himselfe. In regard of his generall prouidence he is commended: in regard of the particular meanes by deceiuing his master, he is called vniust. 6. They may not before their couenanted time be expired goe away from their master. When Gen. 30. 26. Iaakob after long seruice had a minde to be gone, he asked leaue, and because his vncle and master would not willingly let him goe, he tarried still. Obiect. Afterwards & 31. 20. Iaakob priuily stole away from his master. Answ. 1. His couenanted time was out. 2. He had an ex∣presse warrant from God to be gone. 3. His manner of going away is not to be iustified, and in that respect it is no good patterne. §. 12. Of the vnlawfull libertie which seruants take to them∣selues. Contrary to the forenamed limitations of seruants libertie are these, and such like lewd and licentious pranks as follow. 1. When seruants watch their times to goe whither they list, and their master not know it: as when their masters are seri∣ously imployed, or abroad, or in bed. Thus that lewd seruant Gehazi watched his time to run after Naaman, thinking that 2 King. 5. 20. his master should not know it. 2. When being bound to their masters seruice, they doe their owne businesse, and seeke their owne profit; and that without their masters leaue. This aggrauated Gehazi his pri∣uie
stealing and withdrawing himselfe from his master, that he went to receiue gifts for himselfe. Many such lewd seruants there be, that knowing such and such friends of their master, who will be ready to doe any kindnesse for them, will vse their masters name to borow money, or get some other fauour, and neuer let their-masters know of it. 3. When seruants will chuse their owne worke, and doe that which liketh themselues best, or else doe nothing at all. Thus where many seruants be in one house together, if they be not in such places as they like themselues, they will mum∣ble, and grumble, and doe nothing well. 4. When seruants, especially maid-seruants, that are bound, doe purposely mary to free themselues: because our lawes doe free a maide that is maried from her seruice to master and mistresse. 5. When they are liberall of their masters goods in giuing them away. Some thinke that because they are of the house, they may dispose the things of the house vpon charitable vses. But pretence of charitie is no excuse for iniustice. Seruants may giue notice to their masters or mistresses, that there are in the house such and such things meet to be giuen away, or that there are such and such poore folkes that stand in great need: but priuily without any consent at all, they may not giue away any thing of their masters. 6. When vpon discontent they run away from their ma∣sters. The two seruants of Shemei which run from their ma∣ster 1 King. 2. 39. Philem. ver. 12. Gen. 16. 9. are taxed for it by the holy Ghost. One simus that run from his master is sent backe againe by S. Paul: and Hagar is sent backe by an Angell. Obiect. What if master and mistresse be sharpe, rigorous, and cruell. Answ. An Angell from heauen giueth one answer, (Submit Gen. 16. 9. thy selfe vnder her hands:) And an Apostle giueth another, Be subiect with all feare to the froward: for conscience toward 1 Pet. 2. 18, 19. God endure griefe, suffering wrongfully. These faults are thus noted, that seruants taking notice of them, may the more carefully auoid them.
§. 13. Of seruants obedience to their masters commandements. The affirmatiue and actiue part of seruants obedience, con∣sisting in a ready yeelding to that which their masters will haue done, hath respect (as the like kinde of childrens obedi∣ence) to the Commandement, Instruction, Reproofe, and Corre∣ction of their master. I. A master hauing power to command his seruants, it is What masters command, ser∣uants must doe. a dutie of seruants to obey their master therein. The particular worke which appertaineth to a seruant by vertue of his place is to haue an eie to his master, to see what he requireth at his hands. Dauid thus describes the property of good seruants, Their eies looke to the hand of their master. That looking, as it Psal. 123. 2. implieth an expectation of releefe and succour, so also a rea∣dinesse to receiue and execute any thing from them that they would haue done. The Centurion commendeth this duty Mat. 8. 9. in the example of his seruants, who euery one of them did what their master commanded them to doe. It is further com∣mended in the examples of Gen. 24. 9. Abrams seruant, 1 King. 18. 43. Eliahs ser∣uant, and many others. Note how farre the Lord Christ ex∣acteth this dutie of seruants; Luk. 17. 7, 8. Though a seruant hath beene all day plowing (a laborious and wearisome worke) yet when he commeth home, his master commanding him to dresse his supper and wait, he must doe it. By all these proofes it appea∣reth, that if a master bid his seruant, come, goe, doe this, or that, he must obey. The contrary hereunto is the highest degree of disobedi∣ence, Contrary. Refusing to be at command. 2 Sam. 19. 26. as when seruants refuse to be at their masters command, and to doe what they charge them to doe: as Ziba, who being commanded to saddle his masters Asse, went away and did it not: and Iobs seruants, who being called would not answer. Iob 19. 16. Of all other offences this doth most prouoke masters: for it is a plaine contempt of their authoritie. §. 14. Of seruants hearkning to their masters instructions in matters of their calling. II. As a master hath power to command, so his dutie it is to See Treat. 8. §. 21, 38. instruct his seruants in the way of righteousnesse, and in that ciuill course of life wherein he is to walke. The dutie then of seruants it is, in both to hearken and be obedient vnto them.
1. Such seruants as are vnder masters to learne their trade, are bound many waies to hearken to them. 1. That for the time they may doe the better seruice to their masters. 2. That by learning a trade or skill in any good calling they may be the better able when the time of their seruice is out to maintaine themselues, to teach other seruants which shall be vnder them, and to doe the more good in the place where they shall liue. 3. That thus they may the better discharge a good consci∣ence in that particular place wherein God hath set them. Contrary is the idle, sluggish, dull disposition of many ser∣uants, who by reason of their carelesnesse and vntowardnesse in doing that which they are taught, vex and grieue their ma∣sters, yea and make them weary of instructing them. Many prentises spend all the time of their prentiship without reaping any good at all: they neuer proue their crafts masters: so many in the countrey liue vnder good husbands, many Clearks vn∣der good Lawyers, many maids vnder good houswiues, and that many yeares together, yet through their negligence get no good at all, whereas if they would haue beene attentiue and carefull, they might haue learned much. Enemies these are to their masters, to themselues, to the city and country where they liue, and to their friends and parents, especially if they haue any aliue. §. 15. Of seruants hearkning to their masters instructions in piety. Such seruants as haue religious masters who are carefull to Obedience of seruants to pi∣ous instructi∣ons. instruct their houshold in the way of righteousnesse, ought to be obedient to their instructions: so were Iosuahs seruants, (or else could not Iosuah haue vndertaken for them Ios. 24. 15. as he did) and the seruants of that Ruler of whom it was said that himselfe be∣leeued c Iohn 4. 53. and all his house: and the seruants of Lidia, and of the Iay∣er, concerning whom it is said, Acts 16. 15, She was baptised and her hous∣hold: 34. he beleeued in God and all his house. Vnder these words house and houshold, none doubteth but that seruants are com∣prised. Now then if the seruants of these had not hearkened and
yeelded to the instructions of their master and mistresse, would they haue beleeued in him in whom their masters beleeued, or beene baptised when their mistresse was? The like may be ga∣thered out of this phrase, Rom. 16. 5. Philem. v. 2. The Church in their house: for there∣by is implied that all in the house were of the same faith that their master and mistresse were. It is expresly noted of the Act. 10. 7. Souldier that waited continually on Cornelius, that he was a deuout man, whereby it is presupposed that he hearkned to his masters instructions: for it is noted of the master also, that Vers. 2. he was a deuout man and feared God. The benefit which redoundeth to seruants by obeying such instructions, is vnspeakable: much more good may be got by following the spirituall directions of religious masters, then the witty and commodious directions of the wisest statesmen, and the skilfullest artists, or tradesmen that be: so as there is a double bond to binde seruants to obey this kinde of instructi∣ons: 1. The bond of duty. 2. The bond of profit and benefit to themselues. §. 16. Of Seruants faults contrary to obedience in matters of religion. Notwithstanding the forenamed duty be so behouefull to seruants, yet of all other duties is it by many least thought to be a duty, and most neglected, the cleane contrary for the most part being practised, as may appeare by these particulars. 1. Many seruants are of so impious a minde, as of all masters Contrary, 1. Loth to serue religious masters. they will not serue such as are religious, and make conscience to instruct their seruants in the way to saluation: they had ra∣ther serue profane masters, meere worldlings, and very Papists. For why? any thing better agreeth to corrupt nature then to be kept within the bounds of religion: few like the strait gate and narrow way that leadeth to life: for the god of this world so blindeth mens eies, that they cannot see the blessing of life at the end of this way, they only see the straitnesse of it: or if they should see it a farre off, yet they so sauour the things of the flesh, and of this present euill world, as they would not re∣gard that which is so farre off. Now religious masters will en∣deuour what they can to keepe all their seruants in that nar∣row
way; but irreligious masters will suffer them to follow the sway of their owne corruption, to sweare, to profane the Sab∣both, and spend that whole day in sleeping, sporting, eating and drinking: to goe to bed without prayer, or catechizing, or reading the word of God, and so to rise againe and goe about their businesse: to which holy duties, such deuout ma∣sters as Cornelius was, will hold their seruants. 2. Others that are placed by their friends vnder such de∣uout 2. Mutter a∣gainst them being in ser∣uice. masters, or not knowing before hand the disposition of their masters, haue themselues couenanted with them to be their seruants, after they haue beene a while in the house, thinke their masters house a prison to them, muttering and murmuring against their strait keeping in, as they deeme it: and being called in to any religious exercise, they will be rea∣dy to say, I was not hired for this, neither am I bound to you here∣in, set me about your worke and I will doe it. 3. Some againe are the more negligent and dissolute in their 3. Negligent because ma∣sters religious. businesse, because their masters are religious. It is a common complaint, that profane, worldly masters shal haue more seruice then religious and godly masters, yea though these giue better wages, diet and lodging then those. Many thinke the fault hereof to be in the master: but assuredly for the most part the fault is the corrupt disposition of seruants, that esteeme plea∣sure in sinne, and libertie thereunto more then wages, diet, and lodging: whereby they shew themselues impious against God, vngratefull to their masters, iniurious to themselues. Let this peruerse disposition be noted, that the rule of the Apostle verie pertinent to this point, may be the better obserued, They 1 Tim. 6. 2. that haue beleeuing masters let them not despise them, but rather doe them seruice, because they are faithfull and beloued. §. 17. Of seruants obedience to reproofe and correction. The same directions may serue for yeelding to reproofe and correction: for they may both be brought to one head: and in the generall they doe both agree. For reproofe is a verball correction, and correction is a reall reproofe. The obedience which seruants in regard of these must shew to their masters is twofold. 1. Patiently to beare all manner of reproofe and correction.
2. Readily to amend that for which they are iustly repro∣ued or corrected. For the first of these, seruants haue an expresse precept, en∣forced 1 Pet. 2. 18. &c. by many reasons in these words, Seruants be subiect to your masters with all feare, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. For this is thanke worthy if a man for conscience toward God endure griefe, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye take it patiently? but if whey ye doe well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is accep∣table with God. Here we see, 1. That correction is patiently to be borne by seruants: if correction, then much more reproofe. 2. That though correction be iniustly inflicted, yet it is pa∣tiently to be endured: therefore much more when it is de∣serued. 3. That buffeting and that of a froward master is to be borne: therefore much more lighter correction of a good and gentle master. Ioseph patiently endured Psal. 105. 18. fetters, and yron chaines, and Gen. 39. 20. imprisonment inflicted vpon him most vniustly, euen for his faithfulnesse to his master. Great was the recompence which God made vnto him: & assuredly God will recompence all the wrong, paine, and griefe, that in this case shall be endured for conscience sake. For the Apostle saith, that this is thankworthy, that is, worthy of praise and commendation, and so worthy of recompence and reward. Againe he saith that it is acceptable to God, so as God will recompence it, though men may account it but basenesse and blockishnesse: yea though vniust masters may thereupon take occasion the more to trample vpon, and insult ouer their seruants. To these motiues I may adde the rule of our Christian pro∣fession (which is also intimated by the Apostle in these words, 1 Pet. 2. 21. Euen hereunto were ye called.) For our Christian calling re∣quireth all men to Rom. 12. 19. giue place vnto wrath: Matt. 5. 39. To turne the other cheeke when one is smitten: Rom. 12. 21. To ouercome euill with goodnesse. 1 Pet. 2. 21. If all Christians must shew such patience to all men, euen their equals: how much more seruants to masters? The Apostle commendeth to seruants the example of Christ in this case: he was reuiled and much he suffered, and that most iniuriously, and
yet patiently did he beare all: if seruants thus suffer with him, they also shall reigne with him. §. 18. Of the extremes contrary to seruants patient bearing of reproofe and correction. Patient bearing of rebuke and blowes, seemeth an hard say∣ing to most seruants: they cannot endure to heare it: for their minde and carriage is cleane contrary thereunto. 1. Some being but reproued, though iustly, are ready to answer againe, and to chop word for word: a sinne Tit. 2. 9. . expresly forbidden. It seemeth by the Apostles expresse mentioning of it, that answering againe hath beene an old euill quality in seruants. Obiect. If a master vniustly reproue his seruant, and the ser∣uant answer not againe, he wittingly suffereth his master to continue in his error, and so maketh himselfe accessary to his masters sinne. Answ. There is difference betwixt a spightfull, reuengefull contradicting of that which is spoken, and an humble, mild, reuerend, seasonable apologie for that which is vniustly cen∣sured. This is lawfull: but that is forbidden. 2. Others scorne to be corrected: which disdaine they ma∣nifest many waies: as 1. By muttering, and saying they came not for that end. But though that were not the maine end of their subiection, yet is it a meanes to keepe them vnder subiection: and therefore to be endured by them. 2. By running away, as See §. 12. Hagar. 3. By strugling and striuing with their master or mistresse: and taking the staffe or wand by the end: or by holding the hands of those that correct them. Obiect. Shall I suffer my selfe wrongfully to be beaten, when I can helpe my selfe and hinder it? Answ. 1. Seruants may not be their owne Iudges whether their correction be iust or vniust: for men are so prone to sooth themselues and to extenuate the euill actions which they doe, as if they be not corrected till they thinke it iust, they would neuer be corrected. 2. To endure punishment (that I may vse Saint Peters
word) is not otherwaies thanke-worthy. If iustly thou beest punished, thou hast but thy desert. If forcibly so as thou canst not resist, necessity maketh thee beare it. The sturdiest theeues that be, being pinnied, suffer themselues to be turned ouer, because they see a necessity. But Christ (whose 1 Pet. 2. 21. exam∣ple in this case is set before seruants) Mat. 26. 53. could haue freed him∣selfe but would not. If seruants endure for conscience sake, they will not resist, though they be able. 3. Others if they be smitten by master or mistresse, will giue as much as they receiue, they will smite againe: a practise vnbeseeming any Christian, but most vnseemely for Christian seruants: who manifest thereby a despight of Gods image and power in their masters. 4. Others are so possessed with a deuill, as they will seeke all the reuenge they can, if they be corrected: whence it com∣meth to passe that some hot, heady, hardy youth, sticke not to challenge their masters into the field: and others, more mali∣ciously minded, secretly endeuour to take away the life of their masters. Many that haue not the opportunity to practise such villanies, doe notwithstanding in their hearts wish their masters destruction, and make most fearefull imprecations against them; whereby they make themselues guilty of blood before God. §. 19. Of seruants amending that for which they are iustly re∣proued or corrected. More then patience is required of them that are deseruedly rebuked or corrected for their faults: namely See more of this point Treat. 5. §. 33. & 34. repentance, and amendment. Thus shall the smart and paine which ser∣uants endure, be as good physicke vnto them, and turne to their good. True amendment of former faults may make one a better seruant then he was before he committed those faults: witnesse that which Saint Paul saith of Onesimus, Philem. vers. 11. in time past he was to thee vnprofitable, but now profitable to thee and me. Contrary is their disposition, who notwithstanding all re∣buke and correction goe on still in their euill and lewd cour∣ses: and continue to prouoke their master more and more, and so make them adde blow vnto blow, and stroke vnto stroke, till they haue no hope of them, but are forced to put them out
of doores. This commeth either from a scornfull, disdainfull stomach (for Pro. 13. 1. a scorner heareth not rebuke) or from a base, ser∣uile, stupid, blockish, brutish nature, that is not moued with any smart or paine, like a restie iade that will not stirre though he be whipt or beaten neuer so much. Pro. 26. 3. Solomon implieth thus much by putting into one leash an horse, an asse, and a foole: meaning by a foole a scornfull, blockish seruant: to whose backe a rod is as a whip to an horse: of such a foole he saith, that Pro. 17. 10. an hundred stripes enter not into him: and againe, Pro. 27. 22. Though thou shouldest bray a foole in a morter among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishnesse depart from him. But what shall we say of such as for rebuke and correction are the worse? What, but that shame, beggery, and some igno∣minious death or other is like to befall them. Hitherto of the kindes of seruants duties. The next point respecteth the manner of performing them. §. 20. Of seruing with trembling. The Manner how seruants ought to performe their duties is noted in foure phrases: The first whereof is this, with feare and trembling. I. Feare is both as a fountaine from whence all other duties flow: and also as a sawce to season them all. Commonly the season and sauour of waters commeth from the fountaine: which Saint Iames implieth, where he saith, no fountaine doth yeeld salt water and fresh: for if the fountaine be Iam. 3. 12. salt, the streames issuing from thence will be salt: and fresh, if the fountaine be fresh: so if feare be seated in the heart of ser∣uants, all their obedience and submission will be seasoned therewith. Let therefore seruants here learne by their man∣ner of performing all their duties, to declare that there is a true seruant-like feare seated in their hearts. Hereof I shall need say no more then what hath beene §. 4. before deliuered. The other word See Treat. 1. §. 124. trembling added to feare, addeth empha∣sis, shewing that it is no small feare that is required of seruants: and it giueth them to wit that their masters hauing a power to punish them, they must so carrie themselues as they prouoke not their master to wrath, but be very carefull and circum∣spect to auoid his displeasure, that they giue him no iust oc∣casion
of offence. This care had that seruant of Dauid which first espied Absolom hanging in a tree, and told Ioab thereof: 2 Sam. 18. 12. he so feared the displeasure of the king his master, as to gaine a thousand shekels of siluer he durst not kill Absolom. The like is noted of Obadiah, who was afraid to tell his master Ahab where Eliah was, left his master might haue thought he had mocked him, if the Spirit had carried Eliah away. 1 King. 18. 9. &c. This trembling feare is needfull in regard of the small loue that seruants commonly beare to their masters. There are not those motiues to stirre vp loue in seruants to their masters, as in children to their parents: except therefore through awe and dread they be kept in compasse, they will exceedingly transgresse: and because this is so needfull, seruants must la∣bour to nourish it, as a meanes to keepe them from ouer-much boldnesse. Contrary on the one side is a proud despising of a masters authority (saying, if not with their mouthes, yet in their heart, as Gaal of Abimelech, who is he that we should serue him? or as those that despised the gouernment of Christ their master, Iudg. 9. 28. Luk. 19. 14. we will not haue this man to reigne ouer vs: and againe, Psal. 2. 3. let vs breake his bonds asunder, and cast away his cords from vs.) And on the other side a wretched carelessenesse, not fearing any punishment before they feele it: like to many desperate theeues that no whit feare the power of the Iudge, but desperatly say, we haue but one death to pay. The authority of God himselfe is despised, and his reuenging hand is lightly regarded by such proud and desperate seruants: so as their sinne is no small sinne. §. 21. Of seruing with sincerity. The second branch concerning the manner of seruants performing their dutie is in these words, in singlenesse of heart, 11. so as all must be performed with an honest and vpright heart: whatsoeuer yee doe, doe it heartily, saith the Apostle to seruants Col. 3. 23. in another place. Thus did Ioseph in singlenesse of heart serue his master: instance his refusing to abuse his mistresse in Gen. 39. 11, 12. a priuate chamber when she desired it, and no other body was in the house. Happy were it for masters to haue such seruants: then might they take no more care then Potiphar did, but put Gen. 39. 6.
all that they haue into their seruants hands. Neither would this rare vertue in seruants be only profitable to their ma∣sters, but also very comfortable to themselues, and bring them much peace of conscience. Contrary is hypocriticall seruice: when seruants haue a heart, and a heart, making shew-of one heart outwardly, and haue another, euen a cleane contrary heart within them. Such Psal. 12. 2. an one was Gehazi, who came in and stood before his master, as if he had performed some good seruice for his master, when 2. King 5. 25. he had most highly dishonoured him: and such an one was Iudas who carried as faire a face to his master as any of the disciples, and yet was an arrant traitor: for when he was thought to goe out to buy prouision for his master, he went to Iohn 13. 29. betray him. All eye-seruice is contrary to the forenamed singlenesse of heart: when seruants are diligent so long as their masters eye is on them: Eye seruice. like little children that will doe any thing their mother will haue them doe, while her eye is vpon them; but nothing, when her backe is turned. The world is full of such eye-seruing seruants, who while their masters are present, will be as busie as Bees: but if he be away, then either idling at home, or gadding abroad, or nothing but wrangling, and eating, and drinking with the drun∣ken; like that lewd seruant whom Christ noteth in the parable Matth. 24. 49. Let the iudgement denounced against him be noted of such seruants. §. 22. Of seruing for conscience sake. The third branch of the manner of seruants performing III. Sit seruus non vt seruus ad oculum, sed vt domini studio∣sus. Constit. A∣post. l. 4. c. 12. their dutie is in these words, as vnto Christ, as the seruants of Christ, doing the will of God, as to the Lord: all which doe set forth a good conscience, or such seruice as is performed for conscience sake, or for the Lords sake, which is all one: because the consci∣ence hath an eye only to the Lord, to his will, and to his ordi∣nance. Though there were no other motiue in the world to moue them to obey their masters, yet their conscience to God would moue them. Such was Iosephs manner of seruing his master, as the reason which he himselfe rendreth to his mistresse sheweth, How can I doe this great wickednesse, and sinne against God? The Gen. 39. 9. prayer which Abrahams seruant made to God, and the thanks Gen. 24. 12, 27.
which he rendred to him for blessing his iourney, shew, that he serued his master for the Lords sake. It is more cleare then needs be proued, that such was Iaakobs seruice to his master. This is the rather to be noted of Christian seruants, because herein lieth the greatest difference betwixt beleeuing seruants, and others: others may serue with feare and trembling, in singlenesse of heart, and with good will; but only Saints doe seruice as to Christ for con∣science sake: If this be not that which only they aime at, yet assu∣redly they doe chiefly and principally aime at it: which maketh them not to content themselues with doing the thing, but to en∣deuour to doe it after the best manner that they can, so as God may best accept thereof: whereby as they approue themselues to God, so they doe much good to their masters, and bring much comfort vnto their owne soules. Contrary is the minde of most, who doe all the seruice which Seruice on by-respects. they doe on by-respects: they may performe much dutie, and it may be doe much good to their masters; and thereupon they may get good wages at their masters hands, and extraordinarie recompence also, and liue in much quiet vnder them: but no re∣ward can they looke for at Gods hands: so as I may say to such ser∣uants, as Christ said to those who did all to haue glory of men, They haue their reward. Matth. 6. 2. §. 23. Of seruants willingnesse to performe their dutie. The fourth branch respecting the manner of seruants per∣forming IIII. their dutie, is noted in this phrase, with good will. This good will of a seruant to his master, hath respect partly to the dis∣position of the seruant, and so it implieth willingnesse and cheere∣fulnesse; Seruice to be done cheere∣fully. and partly to the benefit of the master, and so it implieth faithfulnesse. Of willingnesse to doe that dutie which belongeth to a seruant, Christ Iesus (who Phil. 2. 7. tooke vpon him the forme of a seruant) hath made himselfe a worthy patterne. Psal. 40. 8. I delight to doe thy will, saith he to him that sent him: and againe, Joh. 4. 34. My meat is to doe the will of him that sent me, and to finish his worke. Doth not a man eat his meat willingly, with delight and cheerefulnesse? euen so did Christ the worke of him that sent him. So cheerefully did Iaakob serue his Vncle Laban, that Gen. 29. 20. seuen yeeres seemed to him but a few dayes.
Obiect. The reason thereof was the loue he had to Rachel. 1. Answ. This was one reason, but not the only reason: had he not borne good will to his Vncle and Master, as well as loue to his wife, the time might haue seemed tedious enough: but both mee∣ting together, made the time passe away the better. 2. Answ. If the loue he had to Rachel made him doe his seruice so cheerefully: then if seruants loue God, for whose sake they ought to doe their seruice, it will cheerefully be done. 1. That which the Apostle applieth to giuing of almes (2 Cor. 9. 7.) may be extended to all manner of duties which God requi∣reth, God loueth cheerefulnesse: that worke therefore which is not seasoned therewith God regardeth not. 2. As cheerefulnesse maketh God the better to like the worke, so it maketh the worke much more easie to him that doth it. Our common prouerbe noteth as much, Nothing is hard to a willing minde. 3. Apostolus ser∣uos monet do∣minis suis ex animo cum bona voluntate ser∣uire, vt scilicet si non possunt à dominis liberi fieri, suam ser∣uitutem ipsi quodammedo liberam faciant. Aug de Ciu. Dei, l. 19. c. 15. Direction. Let there be cheerefulnesse in a seruants minde, and he is as free as his master: for such a seruant is the Lords freeman (1 Cor. 7. 22.) and when he cannot be made free of his master, he doth after a manner make his seruice free. Haue an eye to God, to his acceptation, and remuneration, and it will quicken thy spirit. Mans reward maketh poore men glad of worke, and cheerefull in doing their worke: it is as sugar to sharpe wine. Tradesmen, Physitians, Lawyers, all sorts of men, are by gaine drawne on with great willingnesse to take great paines. Should not Gods recompence of our paines make vs much more willing? Surely it would, if we had such an eye of Heb. 11. 26. faith as Moses had, thereby to see the recompence of reward which he saw. Contrary is heauinesse of spirit, and discontentednesse of minde, Contrary, Discontented∣nesse. when seruants doe their seruice lowringly, grudgingly, by com∣pulsion (as Beares are brought to a stake) and of necessitie, as slaues in a galley. Such seruice must needs be vntowardly done: but though outwardly it be well done, yet can the doer haue little comfort therein, because God accepteth it not. §. 24. Of seruants quicknesse and diligence in their seruice. Seruants, in testimonie of their willingnesse and cheereful∣nesse, must be both quicke and diligent in their seruice: for these
are effects of willingnesse. Quicknesse hath respect to the time of doing a thing. Diligence to the paines that is taken about it. He that is quicke in his seruice taketh vp no more time about Quicknesse. one thing then must needs; but is ready to doe one thing after another; and thus doth much more seruice. It is expresly noted of Rebekah, that she Gen. 24. 18, 20. hasted, and let downe her pitcher: and ha∣sted and emptied her pitcher, and ran againe to the Well. And Abrahams seruant hauing made what speed he could to the place whither he was sent, Gen. 24. 33. would not eat till he had told his errand: after he had told it, if he had not sped, vers. 49. he would not haue delaied time, but haue gone againe forthwith: when he had well dispat∣ched all, vers. 56. he would not stay vpon any complements, but hasted away to his master. 2 Sam. 18. 23. Ahimaaz stroue with Cushi who should soo∣nest bring their message to their master: and Ahimaaz outstript Cushi, for he had a very willing minde to doe the businesse. The manner of charge which Elisha gaue to his seruant, implieth all the speed he could make: it was this, 2 King. 4. 29. Gird vp thy loynes, goe thy way: if thou meet any by the way, salute him not: and if any salute thee, answer him not againe. He that is diligent in his seruice, will not only be quicke for the Diligence. time, but also hold on, and imploy all the labour and paines that he can for the well effecting of that which he is to doe. That gene∣rall charge laid vpon all men, in particular appertaineth to a ser∣uant (Gen. 3. 19. In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread) and that which Solomon noteth (Eccl. 9. 10. what soeuer thine hand findeth to doe, doe it with thy might.) Great was Iaakobs diligence (for he saith of himselfe in doing his masters businesse, Gen. 31. 40. In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleepe departed from mine eyes.) Great also was the diligence of those shepherds, that Luke 2. 8. kept watch ouer their flocke by night: and of Mat. 25. 16, 17. those seruants, that by their paines doubled the talents which were committed to them. As diligence is by these and many like examples commen∣ded vnto vs, so is it further set forth by the many promises which are made vnto it, as, Pro. 10. 4. The hand of the diligent maketh rich: & 12. 14. The recompence of a mans hands shall be rendred vnto him: vers. 24. The hand of the diligent shall be are rule: & 14. 23. In all labour there is profit. The worke which seruants are by their master appointed to doe, is to them the worke of God: whereupon the Apostle saith
to seruants as well as to others, 1 Cor. 7. 17. as God hath called euery one, so let him walke: but the worke of God is to be done with all dili∣gence: for Jer. 48. 10. Cursed is he that doth the worke of the Lord negli∣gently. Contrary is the idlenesse, lazinesse, slothfulnesse, and slug∣gishnesse Idlenesse. of seruants. These are faults too too common. Solo∣mon much inueigheth against these vices, setting them forth in their kinde, and setting downe the many mischiefes that follow thereupon. Thus he deciphereth them; Pro. 26. 13, 14, 15. The slothfull man saith, there is a Lion in the way (that is, he pretendeth vnlikely danger) As the doore turneth vpon the hinges, so a slothfull man vpon his bed. The slothfull hideth his hand in his bosome, it grieueth him to bring it againe to his mouth. & 24. 33. Yet a little sleepe, a little slumber, a little fol∣ding of the hands to sleepe. These are the mischiefes which he noteth to come from idle∣nesse and sloth, & 10. 4. Pouertie, & 12. 24. Seruitude, & 13. 4. Fruitlesse wishes and de∣sires, & 19. 15. Hunger, & 20. 4. Beggerie, & 21. 25. Death. And to shew what small ioy or comfort masters may haue in slothfull seruants, he compareth them to vineger and smoke, which are as irkesome to the teeth and eyes as can be: & 10. 26. As vineger (saith he) is to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. And because many idle packs thinke and say they doe no hurt, he fur∣ther saith, that & 18. 9. He that is slothfull in his worke is brother to him that is a great waster: in which respect Christ stileth a slothfull seruant, Mat. 25. 26, 30. a wicked and vnprofitable seruant: and giueth him the portion of those who doe much hurt. How lightly soeuer many seruants esteeme idlenesse and sloth, the truth is, that it is a plaine theft. For the best seruice that ser∣uants can doe, is due to their master: and they ought to be as di∣ligent in their masters worke, as if it were their owne. So as it is not enough to auoid idlenesse in doing nothing at all, but they must take heed that they be not slothfull in doing something: for as good not at all, as neuer a whit the better. I haue the further pressed this point, because it is noted as a blemish in such seruants as professe religion to be most lazie and negligent, least sedulous and diligent. Much of that time which they should spend about their masters businesse (which is their
particular calling) they spend in prating about state, and Church-businesse, (matters not belonging to them.) Thus they make their masters weary of their seruice; and by reason thereof they are oft shifted from house to house, and as rolling stones, gather no mosse: they neither learne skill, whereby they may, when they are of themselues, maintaine themselues, and doe good to others: nor lay vp any stocke or portion, as o∣thers which are diligent doe: yea they get such an habit of idlenesse, as they can neuer shake it off againe: for they who are slothfull being vnder masters, seldome proue diligent when they are for themselues. In these is Solomons prouerbe verified, The talke of the lips tendeth only to penury. Pro. 14. 23. §. 25. Of seruants faithfulnesse. It was §. 23. before noted, that the good will here required of seruants to their masters had respect to the profit and benefit which seruants by their seruice might bring to their masters: and in that respect it compriseth faithfulnesse vnder it, Faith∣fulnesse (I say) whereby seruants doe well discharge that trust which is committed to them. Expresly it is commanded to seruants, Tit. 2. 10. To shew all good faithfulnesse, and 1 Cor. 4. 2. it is required in stewards that a man be found faithfull. The phrase which is vsed of Moses, Heb. 3. 5. He was faithfull as a seruant, sheweth that faithfulnesse by a kinde of proprietie appertaineth to a ser∣uant: and Mat. 25. 21. where Christ coupleth these two, good and faith∣full, he giueth vs to vnderstand that a seruants goodnesse con∣sisteth in his faithfulnesse. Great is the benefit that by seruants faithfulnesse will re∣dound both to master and seruant. The benefit which commeth to the master, Solomon noteth in this prouerbe, As the cold of snow (is very acceptable, com∣fortable Pro. 25. 13. and profitable) in the time of haruest (when men are euen sweltered with heat) so is a faithfull messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soule of his masters: and againe in this, A faithfull ambassadour is health, that is, he bringeth safetie to his master. Pro. 13. 17. The benefit which redoundeth to the seruant himselfe by his faithfulnesse Christ noteth in this his approbation, and remuneration thereof, Well done thou good and faithfull seruant, Mat. 25. 21.
thou hast beene faithfull ouer a few things, I will make thee Ruler ouer many things, enter thou into the ioy of thy Lord. Euery ser∣uant shall be called to his account: if not by his master on earth, yet by his master in heauen: he will say to euery one, Giue an account of thy stewardship: now then if seruants haue not beene Luk. 16. 2. faithfull, what other discharge can they looke for, then that which the wicked, slothfull, and vnprofitable seruant (who hid his talent in a napkin) receiued, namely this, Cast ye the Mat. 25. 30. vnprofitable seruant into outer darknesse, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Let all vnfaithfull seruants note this: for to faithfulnesse is contrary all vnfaithfulnesse, as negligence, deceit, theeuery, treachery, and such like vices. Much dam∣mage, disgrace, and vexation is brought by such seruants to masters: and better it had beene that they neuer had come in∣to a mans house. But that the point of faithfulnesse may be the better discer∣ned, and obserued, I will exemplifie it in seuen particulars whereabout it ought especially to be exercised, which are, 1. The Goods, 2. The Businesses and affaires, 3. The Counsels and secrets, 4. The other seruants, 5. the Children, 6. The Bed∣fellow, 7. The Person of their master or mistresse. §. 26. Of seruants faithfulnesse about their masters goods. Two things are required of seruants to testifie their faith∣fulnesse about their masters goods. 1. 1. A safe keeping of them. 2. An increasing of them. 1. Whatsoeuer is committed by masters vnto their seruants, they must so carefully preserue, as it be not lost, spoiled, or im∣paired Seruants must well preserue their masters goods. vnder their hands, whether they be things within doores, or without. I may to this purpose not vnfitly apply that charge vnto seruants which in another case the Apostle gaue to Timothy, 1 Tim. 6. 20. . Keepe that which is committed to thy trust: the Metaphor is taken from seruants, and so sheweth what is their dutie. Great was Iosephs faithfulnesse in this kinde, which made his master Gen. 39. 4. put all that he had into his hand. So great was Iackobs faithfulnesse, that & 31. 38, 39. in twentie yeeres his masters ewes and she Goats, being vnder his hand, cast not their young, nor the Rammes were deuoured: if any thing were torne of
beasts, he brought it not to his master, but bare the losse of it himselfe. If seruants espie any dammage or hurt done by o∣thers to their masters goods, they must redresse it, if they can, or at least make it knowne to their masters, that he may giue order for the redressing of it: as the seruants of him that sowed good seed among which tares were sowed, mentioned Mat. 13. 27. in the parable. Masters that put seruants in trust, securely goe about other affaires, and looke not themselues to those goods which are vnder their seruants custodie, which is to be presupposed they would doe, if they trusted not their seruants. Great reason therefore it is that seruants be carefull of those things which are so committed to them. 2. They ought further to doe what lieth in them to ad∣uance Seruants must endeuour to increase their masters estate. Gen. 30. 30. Mat. 25. 16, 17. their masters estate, and to increase his stocke. The little which Laban had was by Iaakobs faithfulnesse in this kinde in∣creased vnto a multitude. The talents which were committed to the two faithfull seruants were by their industrie increased to as many more. So as it is not sufficient for seruants not to impaire their masters estate, but they must better it: for he that kept safe his masters talent, and gaue him his owne againe, was counted an vnprofitable seruant, and receiued the doome of wasters. Most masters take seruants for their aduantage and benefit, for it is but little ease for a master to prouide diet and lodging for many seruants, and to giue them wages, if they reape no profit and benefit by them. §. 27. Of seruants carelesnesse ouer their masters goods. Contrary to seruants fidelitie in safe keeping their masters goods committed to their charge is Carelesnesse and negli∣gence in suffering losse and dammage come to their masters as in the fields, when they looke not to his sences and gats: or neglect his cattell so as they be stolne, or suffer diseases to grow vpon them, or giue them not fodder and water in due season. Or in the house, when they leaue doores or windowes open, and theeues come in and take away, or hooke out their masters goods: or carelesly leaue the fire, or let candles burne
so as the house may be see on fire: or suffer houshold-stuffe, and apparell to lie till it be moth-eaten or otherwise spoiled: or suffer any thing in the house to be broken: or victuall to lie in corners moulding, or to be cast vp and downe for dogs and cats. When Christ so increased the bread and fish, wherewith many thousands were fed, that many fragments were left, he bid his disciples gather vp what remained, and rendred this reason, that nothing be lost. The dammage which may come by Iohn 6. 12. seruants carelesnesse, may be more then euer they can be able to make satisfaction for: and therefore they ought the more carefully to preuent it. §. 28. Of seruants fraud. Contrary to the other branch of seruants faithfulnesse in in∣creasing their masters estate, is all manner of theft and fraud, whether it be by retaining that which is due to their masters, or by purloining from them that which they haue. Tit. 2. 10. . The Apostle expresly forbiddeth seruants to purloine. The word translated purloine, is the same whereby the fraud of Ananias is set forth, who Acts 5. 2. . kept backe part of the price of a possession which they sold: so as thereby is forbidden not only open and manifest stealth, as pilfering money out of their masters purse, chest, or counter; or conueying away their corne, wares, or any other goods: but also putting more into the account of ex∣pences then hath beene expended, or into the account of debts lesse then is due (as the vniust steward, who for a debt of an hundred measures of oyle put in fiftie, and for an hundred of Luke 16. 6, 7. wheat put in fourescore) or spending more then needs, or bringing in ill company into the house when their masters are absent, and entertaining them on their masters cost, or concea∣ling part of the price which hath beene taken for any wares, or borowing money in their masters names, or taking greater fees then their masters wot of, or receiuing bribes or gifts which their masters refuse (as Gehazi) or hiring others to doe their worke vpon their masters cost, or inueagling away their ma∣sters 2 King. 5. 22. customers, or purloining away other mens goods com∣mitted to their masters trust (as Taylors seruants, who thereby both much discredit their masters, and also hinder their cu∣stome.)
Obiect. What if masters detaine their seruants wages? may they not by priuy meanes right themselues? Answ. A masters sinne is no warrant to make seruants an∣swer sinne with sinne. The law is as open for seruants as for masters: if not, Gods eares are open for their complaints: he can and will redresse all, or here or hereafter. Gen. 31. 42. Note Iaakobs ex∣ample. Many make this a iust pretence: but whether it be iust or no, it is not safe to open this gap of deceit. These and such like kindes of deceit are the more hai∣nous sinnes because of that trust which masters repose in ser∣uants: for they violate both the bond of iustice, and of fidelity also. If a seruant imbezill or defraud his master of any of his 21. Of Hen. 8. Stat. 7. And 5. of Eliz. Stat. 10. goods to the value of forty shillings, he is adiudged a felon by our statute law. §. 29. Of seruants faithfulnesse in the businesses which they are to dispatch for their masters. In the businesses which masters commit to the care of II. their seruants to be dispatched by them, they must doe their best endeuour that all may prosper vnder their hands: as it is noted of Ioseph, Gen. 39. 2. he was a prosperous man: we haue not only a pregnant proofe, but also an excellent direction for this point, in the Gen. 24. example of Abrahams seruant, who was very faithfull in dispatching the businesse of fetching a wife for Isaak: there∣in let these particulars be noted. 1. He feared God: the whole cariage of that businesse testi∣fieth as much. There is a double bond to tie seruants hereun∣to: one in respect of themselues, that in the thing which they doe they may be accepted of God: another in respect of their masters, that their masters businesse may prosper vnder their hands: God prospereth such as feare him, in all things they take in hand: instance the examples of Gen. 30. 27. Iaakob, & 39. 2. Ioseph, and 1 Sam. 18. 14. Dauid. 2. He Gen. 24. 12. called vpon God to prosper his endeuours: now prayer is the best meanes that possibly can be vsed to obtaine any blessing from the Lord. Without it all our endeuours are vaine (Psal. 127. 2. It is in vaine to rise vp early and sit vp late, and to eat the bread of carefulnesse, except Gods blessing accompany all.) 3. He Gen. 24. 27. gaue thankes when he saw the Lord begin to pros∣per
that he tooke in hand: thanksgiuing for the beginning of a blessing, is an effectuall meanes for continuance of that bles∣sing: yea it is also an effectuall meanes to moue God to prosper other things that we take in hand: so as, if seruants desire to prosper in all the affaires which they vndertake for their ma∣sters, they must render thanks for the first successe which he hath giuen, and so for the second, third, fourth, and for euery successe. 4. He tooke all the opportunities he could: Gen. 24. 17, 23. when he saw a maid to inquire of, he ran to her, and inquired what was behouefull for his matter: when he had ground to thinke she was the maid, Vers. 22. he presented gifts to her: Vers. 33. so soone as he was brought to the house, he falls vpon the matter for which he came, euen before he did eat any thing: after matters to his li∣king were concluded, he maketh no tarrying, but with all speed carieth the maid to Isaak. In a word, he omitted nothing that in the vttermost of his wisdome he conceiued to be be∣houefull for that matter: more he could not haue done, if the matter had wholly concerned himselfe. I shall need no further to vrge this point, then by setting this patterne before ser∣uants. Contrary is their disposition who care not whether the things which they doe for their master prosper or no: if they haue taken any paines therein, so as their master cannot say they haue altogether neglected it, there is all that they care for. If it succeed not well, they will say they are not in Gods place to make euery thing which is done to prosper. But though the whole blessing rest in God, yet hath he sanctified meanes for obtaining his blessing (as faith, prayer, thanksgi∣uing, and the like) which because they vse not, they faile in this point of faithfulnesse. Nay further, they vse those things which doe mainly hinder and keepe away Gods blessing, and in stead thereof bring a curse vpon all they do, as profanenesse, vncleannesse, drunkennesse, and all manner of riotousnesse, yea despising Gods word and holy ordinances, reproaching his Saints, taking his name in vaine by swearing, forswearing, and blaspheming, lying, also backbiting, pilfering, and other like vices. These irreligious and wicked seruants, as they sinne
against God and their owne soules, so also against their master: it is not for masters profit to keepe such seruants. §. 30. Of seruants faithfulnesse in keeping their masters se∣crets, and concealing their infirmities. By reason of that neare bond which is betwixt master III. and seruants, and their neare and continuall abiding together, and the many imploiments which masters haue for their ser∣uants, seruants come to know many of their masters secrets: faithfulnesse therefore requireth to keepe them close. Prouided that they be not such secrets as tend to the dishonour of God, or to the danger of the Commonwealth and Church, no nor of a priuate person: for 1 Sam. 20. 12. Ionathan is commended for discoue∣ring the mischiefe which Saul had secretly intended against Dauid. For proofe of the point, note what Solomon saith, Pro. 11. 13. He that is of a faithfull spirit concealeth a matter: namely, a secret matter. Note also how faithfull Ier. 38. 27. Ieremiah was in keeping Zedekiahs counsell: though the Princes enquired after it, yet would he not reueale it to them. To this head is to be referred a faithfull concealing of ma∣sters infirmities: for the best that be are subiect to many: and seruants which are vnder their masters roofe continually wait∣ing on them, cannot chuse but espie many: if herein seruants be not faithfull, masters were better be without seruants in their houses. Contrary to keeping close the secrets of masters, is blabbing abroad all such things as seruants know concerning their ma∣sters: which is too common a fault: for when seruants of di∣uers houses men or maids meet together, all their talke for the most part is of their masters and mistresses, whereby it com∣meth to passe that all the secrets of an house are soone knowne about the whole towne or city. Solomon stileth such an one a tale-bearer: A tale-bearer, saith he, reuealeth secrets: or, he that Pro. 11. 13. & 20. 19. reuealeth secrets is a tale-bearer: for many of Solomons prouerbs are conuertible, they may be turned either way. Now note how Solomon noteth out the mischiefes that tale-bearers worke: The words of a tale-bearer are as wounds, (they wound the pretious name and credit of a man) and they goe downe into the innermost Pro. 18. 8.
part of the belly, that is, they doe, as it were, strike thorow the very heart of a man. Againe he noteth them to be the cause of all strise, and to raise discord betwixt chiefe friends: and in Pro. 16. 28. Pro. 26. 20. that respect fitly resembleth them to wood which is the very fuell of fire. What enemies then are such seruants to an house? They are euen as treacherous spies, the most dangerous ene∣mies that be. Thus we see that this is no light sinne: yet is it so much the more odious when masters and mistresses in∣firmities (the publishing whereof may much impaire their credit) are made knowne. §. 31. Of seruants faithfulnesse in helping one another. Where many fellow seruants are together, faithfulnesse re∣quireth that one be helpfull to another in what they may; IV. as by good example, good counsell, incouragement in good courses, disswasion from lewd and wicked practises, peace and vnity, with the like. The Lord Christ expresly calleth such an one a faithfull seruant, and pronounceth him blessed. Mat. 24. 45, 46. Example and aduice of ones equall preuaileth much with another, so as a fellow seruant may in this kinde doe more good then the master himselfe: and if by his meanes he bring his fellow seruants to be faithfull, his owne faithfulnesse is doubled and trebled; and his master receiueth a double and treble benefit thereby: namely the benefit of this good ser∣uants faithfulnesse, and the benefit of all the other seruants faithfulnesse whom he hath made faithfull. Contrary is their practise who by their ill example cor∣rupt Mat. 24. 49. their fellowes (as that euill seruant, who, when his master was away, did eat and drinke with the drunken, that is, did cause Gen. 37. 18, &c. others to be drunken with him) or by ill counsell draw one another on to euill (as the sonnes of Iaakob, who when they saw Ioseph a farre off, said one to another, Behold this dreamer Mat. 24. 49. commeth, come now and let us slay him, &c. and as they, who, when they saw their masters sonne, said among themselues, This is the heire, come let us kill him, and let us seize on his inhe∣ritance) or are euer quarrelling with their fellowes, and smi∣ting them (as that forenamed euill seruant whom the Lord threatneth to cut off) or disswade one another from obedience and subiection (as they who said, Let us breake their bonds Psal 2. 3.
asunder, and cast away their cords from vs; and as Sheba, who said, we haue no part in Dauid: euery man to his tents O Israel.) 2 Sam. 20. 1. These faults are very rife among seruants: whence it com∣meth to passe that there are so few good, and so many bad ser∣uants: too true is this prouerbe, One skabbed sheepe mars a whole flocke. Let there be in a great family one seruant that is pro∣fane, proud, riotous, stout, rebellious, or otherwise vicious, and all will soone be like him. Among other parts of vnfaithfulnesse in this kinde one of the most monstrous (which yet is too too frequent) is to allure one another to vncleannesse, and men and maids to defile one another. We shewed §. 11. before, that it was vnlawfull for ser∣uants during the time of their seruice to marie without their masters consent: how abominable then is it to defile one ano∣ther? The sinne is doubled being betwixt seruants: for as it is a beastly sin in it selfe, so in the forenamed respect it is great∣ly dishonourable to their master and his house: besides that the maid so defiled is oft disabled to doe her seruice well: nay many times the charge of the childe lieth vpon the master. Thus shame and dishonour, griefe and vexation, losse and dammage all meet together, the more to gall & pierce him to the very heart. Is not this then a great part of vnfaithful∣nesse? Deserueth it not to be seuerely punished, and that openly, and publikely with shame and smart too, tht others may take warning thereby? Many vse meanes to escape the reuenging hand of man: but though they escape mans hand, they shall be sure to meet with Gods heauy vengeance: whore∣mongers God will iudge. Daily experience sheweth what mi∣sery Heb. 13. 4. such wretches bring themselues vnto, and how God meet∣eth with them, and that most fearefully. §. 32. Of seruants faithfulnesse about their masters children. Great faithfulnesse may seruants manifest to their ma∣sters V. in and about their children: as while they are young and not able to looke to themselues, to be tender ouer them, and well to tend them: maids especially neatly to handle and looke to them, and cleanly to bring them vp: and they that haue a particular charge of them, to seeke their good in euery thing they can, and giue them their due portion: and (be∣cause
children are much in seruants company) to vse in their hearing such speech as may minister grace to them, and to teach them good things, and (when they grow to some ripe∣nesse of yeares) to beare a reuerend respect to them, and esteeme them their betters because they are their masters chil∣dren. It is noted of Abrahams seruant, that he called his ma∣sters Gen. 24. 65. sonne, Master. Children are deare to parents: the honour and kindnesse done to them they account as done to themselues: this kinde of faithfulnesse therefore must needs be highly esteemed by masters in their seruants: and assuredly it is a great meanes to worke a good respect in masters towards them. Yet Contrarily doe many seruants carrie themselues to∣wards Points of vn∣faithfulnesse in seruants about their masters children. their masters children, as is apparent by these parti∣culars. 1. Some in their cariage are very hoggish and churlish to their masters children when their parents are out of sight. 2. Others are very carelesse of them, and tend them very sluttishly, not caring how they goe: whereby they oft procure great displeasure from their master and mistresse. 3. Others get from their masters children what they can: and depriue them of their allowance, turning it to their owne gaine. 4. Others exceedingly corrupt their masters children with their filthy and corrupt communication: teaching them to sweare, blaspheme, and vse all manner of vncleane speeches: thus is that prouerbe verified, euill communications 1 Cor. 15. 33. corrupt good manners. Children oft times in their young yeeres learne such ill language and behauiour of lewd seruants, as their parents can neuer get them to leaue againe: so as they may curse the day that euer such seruants came into their house. 5. Others allure them to stage-plaies, to dice-houses, and other like places, which are the very bane of youth: and draw them to spend in riot such allowance as their parents allow them, yea and beyond that allowance, so as they runne in debt, and get such an habit of spending, as at length they make away their whole estate.
6. Others inueagle their affections: and oft draw them to folly and vncleannesse. This filthy kinde of vnfaithfulnesse is so much worse then that which was §. 31. before noted betwixt fellow seruants, by how much neerer and dearer children are to their parents then seruants to their masters. 7. Others that dare not commit this abominable wicked∣nesse, sticke not to doe that which is little better, namely to draw them on to be contracted, yea and maried to them often times, and that priuily without consent of their parents: whereby parents affections are oft so alienated from their chil∣dren, as they will not acknowledge them for children, but cleane cast them off. These are the fruits of this lewd kinde of vnfaithfulnesse in seruants. §. 33. Of seruants faithfulnesse in regard of their masters, or mistresses bed-fellow. So faithfull ought seruants to be to their masters and VI. mistresses, that if one of them should labour to vse a seruant in any manner of deceit to the other, the seruant ought not to yeeld. As if a master should moue his maid priuily to take away iewels, plate, mony, linnen, or any such thing as is in her mistresse custody. It skilleth not that the master hath the chiefest power ouer all the goods: a secret taking of them away without the priuity of the mistresse in whose custody they are, is in the seruant deceit, and a point of vnfaithfulnesse. Much lesse ought any seruants be moued by their mistresse priuily to take away their masters corne, wares, or any goods for her priuate vse. Of the two this is the greater part of vn∣faithfulnesse. If such deceit ought not to be vsed about any goods, much lesse about the body of master or mistresse. As if a master should allure his maid to commit folly with him, or a mi∣stresse her man, both their conscience to God, and also their faithfulnesse to their master or mistresse should make them vt∣terly to refuse it, and to giue no place to any such temptation. Gen. 39. 7. &c. Ioseph is propounded as a patterne herein: and against the suggestion of his mistresse he rendreth the two forenamed reasons: his conscience to God in these words, how can I doe this great wickednesse and sinne against God? His faithful∣nesse
to his master in these, He hath not kept backe any thing from me but thee, how then &c. To this head may be referred seruants faithfulnesse in making knowne to their master the sinne of his wife, and to their mistresse the sinne of her husband, especially if it be such a sinne as may tend to the ruine of the familie, and that by the knowledge there∣of, the party that is not blinded and besotted with the sinne, but rather free from it, may be a meanes to redresse it. Thus 1 Sam. 25. 14. Na∣bals seruants made knowne to Abigail the churlishnesse of Nabal towards Dauids seruants: by which means the mischiefe inten∣ded against the house was preuented. Thus if seruants know that their master intendeth some mortall reuenge against another, to tell his wife thereof in time, may be great faithfulnesse: or if they know their mistresse hath appointed to goe away priuily from her husband, to tell him of it, is a part of faithfulnesse. This may be applied to many other like cases. The contrary is yeelding to masters or mistresses in any point of deceit one against another: whereunto seruants are too prone, because they thinke to be boulstred out by the authoritie of the partie that setteth them on worke to deceiue. But no authoritie can be a warrant for any deceit, or wickednesse. §. 34. Of seruants faithfulnesse about their masters persons. Masters and Mistresses are flesh and bloud as well as seruants, VII. and so subiect to weaknesse, sicknesse, old age, and other distresses, wherein they may stand in great need of seruants helpe: seruants therefore must be faithfull in affording them the best helpe that they can. Sauls seruants did a part of faithfulnesse to their master, when, he being vexed with an euill spirit, 1 Sam. 16. 16. they inquired after meanes to ease him. So did Dauids seruants, when he being bed∣red, 1 King. 1. 2. they sought out one to cherish him. It was a point of faith∣fulnesse in Naamans 2 King. 5. 3. maid, to tell her mistresse of a meanes whereby her master might be cured of his leprosie: and in his vers. 13. seruants, to perswade him to vse the meanes prescribed by the Prophet. Contrary is a seruants vngratefull and inhumane leauing of his master in his time of need, as the seruants of Iob did: for when the hand of God lay heauy vpon him, and all his goods were ta∣ken from him, and his bodie full of sore boiles, Iob 19. 15, 16. they that dwelt
in his house, and his maids counted him for a stranger: and he was an aliant in their sight: he called his seruant, and he gaue him no answer. So did 2 Sam. 19. 26. Ziba leaue Mephibosheth in his greatest need: and Mat. 26. 56. the Disciples flie from their master Iesus Christ. But what shall we say of those that take occasion from their masters impo∣tencie to murder him themselues, as 2 Sam. 4. 6. Rechab and Baanah; or to betray him to his enemies, as Mat. 26. 15. Indas betrayed the Lord Christ? what, but that such traiterous seruants may looke for such ends. §. 35. Of the meanes to make seruants faithfull. Among many other meanes to make seruants faithfull to their master, and carefull to performe other duties sincerely, willingly, cheerefully, and diligently, as hath before beene noted, this is one of the most generall, namely, that seruants, in all things they doe for their master, make their masters case their owne, and so doe for him as they would for themselues, or as they would haue their owne seruants doe for them. The generall rule of the Law is, Leu. 19. 18. Loue thy neighbour as thy selfe; and Mat. 7. 12. whatsoeuer you would that men should doe to you, doe you even so to them. If thus euery man must respect another, yea though he be a stranger, then much more must seruants respect their master, because all that they can doe is after an especiall manner as a debt due to their masters: in which respect Christ saith, that when they haue done all that is Luke 17. 10. commanded, they haue but done their dutie. This I haue the rather noted, because the practise of most ser∣uants is contrary thereunto. For while they worke for their ma∣sters, they will cry out that they are ouer-burdened, and tired with that worke which they will easily goe thorow withall when they worke for themselues. They that while they worke for their ma∣ster, must be called to it againe and againe, and forced to stand to it, and to hold out till it be done, what paines will they take, how early will they rise, how late will they sit vp, how diligent will they be for themselues? When Iourneymen receiue increase of wages according to the worke which they doe, they will dispatch more then a prentise that hath but cloth, food, and lodging. Againe, many that in their masters goods are very lauish, and wastfull, when they come to befor themselues are very sparing, sauing, and prouident. What doe these things argue but that ser∣uants doe not beare to their masters that minde which they
should: they doe not for them as they would doe for themselues. Very requisite it is therefore that the forenamed generall rule be obserued. Hitherto of the seuerall kindes of seruants duties, and of the manner of performing them. It remaineth to speake both of the extent of their duties, and also of the restraint of that extent. §. 36. Of seruants endeuour to make their iudgement agree with their masters. The extent of seruants duties is in my text only implied vnder this indefinite particle (Obey) (wch being not restrained to any particulars, must be extended to euery thing) but in other places it is expresly laid downe in these generall termes, Col. 3. 22. Obey in all things, Tit. 2. 9. Please well in all things. It is not therefore sufficient that seruants performe their duties well in some things, they must doe it in all things, yea in things that may be against their owne minde and liking, if their master will haue it so. For this end let seruants note these two rules. The same extent and re∣straint Extent of ser∣uants duties. that was Treat. 3. §. 63, &c. & Treat. 5. §. 35. before no∣ted in laying forth the duties of other inferiors, is here also to be obserued in the duties of seruants: for therein they all agree. The same rules ther∣fore that were before set downe, may here againe be applied. I refer the reader to those places for a more large amplification of the gene∣rals: and here I will content my selfe with adding such particular proofes as are most proper and pertinent to ser∣uants. 1. That they labour to bring their iudgement to the bent of their masters iudgement, and to thinke that meet and good which Seruants must labour to bring their iudge∣ment to agree with their ma∣sters. he doth. Thus the Iudg. 19. 11, 12, &c. seruant of the Leuire which thought it mee∣test to turne into one of the Cities of the Iebusites to lodge there, because the day was far spent, when he saw his master to be of another minde, yeelded to him. So did Luk. 19. 25, &c. those seruants yeeld to their master, who at first thought it vnmeet that he that had ten talents should haue one peece more: and Mat. 13. 28, &c. those seruants also, that at first thought it meet that the tares should be plucked vp from the wheat. This rule is to be obserued in the particular points before deliuered, as the worke which seruants doe, and the man∣ner
of doing it, their apparell, their allowance, yea and in the cor∣rection which their master giueth them, and the rest. Contrary is that great conceit which many seruants haue of Seruants con∣ceit of their owne wit. their owne iudgement, wit, and wisdome, thinking themselues wiser then their masters; as Gehazi, who opposing his owne wit to his masters wisdome, said, 2 King. 5. 20. Behold my master hath spared Naa∣man this Syrian, in not receiuing at his hands that which he brought: but as the Lord liueth, I will runne after him, and take somewhat of him. This was also a fault in 2 King. 2. 16. the children of the Prophets, that would not rest on Elishas iudgement, but impor∣tuned him against his minde to send some to seeke the bodie of Eliah. This selfe-conceit is the cause of many mischiefes: as of discontentednesse at the worke their master appointeth them, and at the allowance of meat and drinke which they haue; of much libertie they take to themselues, of pride in apparell, and other vi∣ces before noted: if the forenamed rule were duely obserued, many of those mischiefes would be auoided, and much better o∣bedience yeelded. §. 37. Of seruants yeelding to doe such things at their masters command, as they cannot thinke to be most meet. The second rule which seruants must obserue is this, that Though they cannot in their iudgement thinke that fit to be done which their master will haue done, yet vpon his peremptorie command they must yeeld to the doing of it: It appeareth by Pe∣ters answer to Christ that he did so, for being commanded to let downe his net for a draught, thus he answereth, Master, we haue toyled all the night, and haue taken nothing (here he sheweth that Luke 5. 5. his opinion was that it would be in vaine to let downe their nets) neuerthelesse at thy word I will let downe the net (here is his obedi∣ence against his opinion.) More cleare is the example of Ioab for this purpose: when the King commanded him to number the 2 Sam. 24. 2, &c. people, he declared that he thought it a very vnmeet thing to doe, by this phrase, Why doth my Lord the King delight in this thing? yet against his iudgement he yeelded to the Kings peremptorie command, for it is said, that the Kings word preuailed against Ioab. Obiect. This is no fit example, because Ioab sinned in obeying. Answ. Ioab cannot iustly be charged with sinne, because it was
not simply vnlawfull to number the people. Dauids sinne was not in the act of numbring the people, but in his minde which moued him to doe it: for there was no iust cause to doe it: on∣ly pride and curiositie moued him, as may be gathered out of his owne reason in these words, that I may know the number of the people. To doe such a thing only to know it, was curiositie. But why would he know it? surely on a proud conceit that he had so many worthies, so many Captaines, so many men of warre. Out of Ioabs example seruants may here learne in humili∣tie and reuerence to render some reasons to moue their master not to presse vpon them that which they thinke to be vnmeet; but yet if their master will not hearken to their reasons, but stand vpon his authoritie, his word must preuaile. Contrary is their peremptorinesse, who by no meanes will be drawne to doe any thing at their masters command, which they themselues thinke not most meet to be done. Such an one is that foole whom Solomon thus describeth, Though thou shoul∣dest Pro. 27. 22. bray a foole in a morter among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishnesse depart from him. These fooles bring much mischiefe vpon their owne pates in disobeying their masters: for exceedingly they prouoke his wrath who hath power to take vengeance of them. Neither let them thinke to receiue comfort in their suffering, because they refuse an vnmeet thing, for meetnesse is not a sufficient warrant against vnlawful∣nesse. To disobey in a thing which lawfully may be done, is vnlawfull: if therefore the pretext be only an vnmeet thing, meetnesse is preferred before lawfulnesse, and vnlawfulnesse lesse accounted of then vnmeetnesse. §. 38. Of seruants forbearing to obey their master against God. That the extent of seruants obedience be not too farre stret∣ched, Restraint of the extent of seruants duties the Apostle setteth downe an excellent limitation there∣of: and that in these foure phrases, As vnto Christ, As the ser∣uants of Christ, Doing the will of God, As to the Lord; all which doe shew that the Obedience which seruants yeeld to their master See the cauti∣ons, Treat. 3. §. 51, 52, &c. must be such as may stand with their obedience to Christ. So that if masters command their seruants neuer so peremptorily to
doe any vnlawfull thing, that is, any thing forbidden by Gods Nolite fieri ser∣ui hominum, i. nolite eis parere cùm turpia prae∣cipiunt. Chrys. in 1 Cor. 7. hom. 19. Exo. 1. 17. word, they may not yeeld to it. The midwiues of the Hebrew women did well in refusing to doe any thing to helpe forward the murderous practises of the King of Egypt in slaying all the male-children of the Hebrewes: it is expresly said, that they feared God and did not as the King commanded them: so as their disobedience in this kinde was a token of their feare of God. In this case Ioseph is commended for not hearkening to his mistresse: and the seruants of Saul for refusing to slaie the Gen. 39. 9. 1 Sam. 22. 17. Lords Priests at their masters command. Thus if a master should command his seruant to kill, to steale, to forsweare himselfe, to lie, to vse false measures and weights, to goe to masse, or doe any other vnlawfull thing, he ought not obey him. Againe, if masters forbid their seruants to doe that which Seruis competit vt obediant do∣minis in ijs qui∣bus mandato Dei nihil dero∣gatur. Basil. God hath commanded them to doe, they must, notwithstan∣ding their masters prohibition, doe it. The Rulers of Israel forbid the Apostles to preach, yet because Christ had com∣manded them to preach, they would not forbeare: nor would Daniel forbeare to pray to God, though the King and Nobles Ethic. defin. 75. Act. 4. 19. Dan. 6. 10. by expresse decree forbad him. So if a profane or popish ma∣ster shall forbid his seruant to goe to Church, or to heare the word, or to take the Sacrament, or to dwell with his wife if he be maried, or to make restitution of that which he hath frau∣dulently gotten, or any other bounden dutie, herein they must say, we ought to obey God rather then men. For when ma∣sters Act. 5. 29. command and forbid any thing against God, they goe beyond their commission, and therein their authoritie ceaseth. Contrary to this restraint is both a parasiticall pleasing of masters: and also a base feare of them. It is the property of a Ais? aio. Ne∣gas? nego. Te∣rent. in Eun. parasite to say what a master will haue him say, and denie what he will haue him denie, and so to doe what he will haue him to doe. Doeg that fawning dog at Sauls word slew all the Lords 1 Sam. 22. 18. Priests: and Absoloms seruants at his word killed Amnon: for 2 Sam. 13. 28, 29. all the reason which they had to commit that murder was this speech of their master, haue not I commanded you? So prone are seruants to sooth their masters, as there is no sinne so horri∣ble which at their masters command they will not be ready to
doe. Thus is that verified which the Prophet long since fore∣told, Isa. 24 2. like master like seruant, like mistresse like maid. It is also the propertie of base fearefull seruants to doe nothing but what their master will haue them doe, and to forbeare any dutie, though neuer so necessary, that he forbiddeth them to doe. What dutie more necessary then praier? We are commanded to pray continually: yet the seruants of Darius were content to 1 Thess. 5. 17. Dan. 6. 7, &c. forbeare that dutie thirtie daies together, because it was against the decree of their Lord and King. The like is noted of the people in Christs time, they durst not make open profession of Ioh. 7. 13. & 9. 22. Christ for feare of the Iewes. So in our daies many seruants there be that dare not make profession of the Gospell, nor goe to Church, nor read the word, nor performe other holy reli∣gious duties, which they know to be bounden duties, for feare of their masters. Had not then the Apostle iust cause to strike so much vpon this string as here he hath done, expresly for∣bidding eie-seruice, man-pleasing, and doing seruice to men, name∣ly in opposition to God? §. 39. Of seruants chusing good masters. As a iust consequence following from the forenamed extent and restraint of seruants duties, I may further gather these two lessons for seruants. 1. It is very behouefull that seruants make choice of good masters: at least if it be in their power to chuse. 2. It is behouefull that they continue and abide vnder good masters: at least if they continue seruants, and abide vn∣der any masters. That these consequences iustly follow as aforesaid, is eui∣dent: for seeing seruants are bound to obey in all things which are not against God, and must obey in nothing but what is in the Lord, it is very requisite that seruants be vnder such masters as beare the Image of God in the inward disposition, and grace of their heart, as well as in their outward function and place: and will goe along with God in vsing their autho∣ritie, commanding nothing but what a seruant may doe with a good conscience, and without transgressing against God: and forbidding nothing that God hath bound a seruant to doe. There will be comfort in seruing such masters: and our obe∣dience
to them will be obedience to God. Such masters there∣fore must be chosen. Yea and with such must seruants abide, (if not with the very same, yet with such as they are, of the same disposition) for if they goe to other, their former com∣fort will be taken away, and their seruitude will seeme so much the more miserable, by how much more knowledge and expe∣rience they haue had of the benefit of their former libertie (for Qui fidelem habet domi∣num, saluo eius dominio, diligat vt patrem. we may well call seruice vnder vnconscionable masters serui∣tude, and in opposition thereunto, seruice vnder religious ma∣sters, libertie.) He therefore that hath a master that is faithfull, due respect had to his authoritie, must loue him as a father, and Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12. so abide with him. For choice of good masters, note what is Exo. 12. 38. recor∣ded of many of the Egyptians and other people: they left their owne countrie, and went out with the Israelites: what should moue them but conscience of the true God whom they knew that Israel serued? Now many of these went out as seruants, as may be gathered from those many Leu. 25. 45. Deut. 5. 14. & 12. 18. & 23. 15. & 23. 7. lawes which were made in the behalfe of seruants that were strangers, and in speciall that were Egyptians. The knowledge which Ruth 1. 16. Ruth had that Naomi her mother in law serued the true God, mo∣ued her to leaue her owne countrie, and to goe as a seruant with Naomi. For abiding with good masters we haue a worthy patterne in the twelue Disciples. Ioh. 6. 66. &c. When many of Christs Disciples at large, went backe, and walked no more with him, Christ asking the twelue whether they also would goe away, Peter in the name of all the rest answered, Lord to whom shall we goe? Thou hast the words of eternall life. Contrary is the minde and practise of many seruants: they neuer inquire after the religious disposition of their master, nor care though he be popish, or profane, so they may haue good wages, diet and lodging: and yet by this meanes, if at least there be any sparke of Gods feare in their heart, they cast them∣selues vpon many sore temptations, and bring themselues into many hard straits, and dangerous snares. And, if God open their eies to see that wretched condition whereinto they haue implunged themselues, they will be forced to crie out and
complaine as Dauid did, when he was in forraine countries where he could not freely serue his God, Psal. 120. 5. Woe is me that I so∣iourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar. Much more contrary is their minde and disposition who re∣fuse to serue religious masters, and shun them most of all: or being in their seruice are neuer quiet till they be out of it a∣gaine. Of these we spake §. 16. before. Hitherto haue we dealt about seruants duties. The reasons which the Apostle rendreth to enforce those duties remaine to be declared. §. 40. Of the first motiue, the place of masters. The first reason which the Apostle vseth to inforce ser∣uants I. duties is implied vnder this phrase, as to Christ; it inti∣mateth the place of a master, which is to be in Christs stead. In this respect the title Lord is giuen to a master. The word which the Apostle vseth in Greeke is that which in the new testament . answereth to that proper Hebrew name of God Iehouah, and it setteth forth the absolute soueraignty of God, and power ouer all creatures: Matt. 28. 18. which power Because the Father hath giuen to his sonne as Mediator, God-man, he is called the 1 Cor. 8. 6. . one or on∣ly Lord: and because masters by vertue of their office and place beare Christs image, and stand in his stead, by communication of Christs authority to them, they are called Lords, yea also Psal. 82. 6. Gods (for that which a Magistrate is in the Common-wealth a master is in the family) Hence it followeth that seruants in performing duty to their master performe duty to Christ, and in rebelling against their master they rebell against Christ; as the Lord said to Samuel of the peoples reiecting his gouernment, they haue not reiected 1 Sam. 8. 7. thee, but they haue reiected me that I should not raigne ouer them. Is not this a strong motiue to prouoke seruants to all duty, and to restraine them from rebellion? if it be well weighed what Christ is, it cannot be but a weighty reason. For though ma∣sters should neither reward their good seruice, nor reuenge their ill seruice, yet will Christ doe both.
§. 41. Of the second motiue, the place of seruants. The second reason is implied vnder this phrase, as seruants II. of Christ: it noteth the place of a seruant: which though it may seeme to be a meane and base place, yet is it indeed an ho∣nourable place. Men count it an honour to bee seruants to a King: but Christ is higher then all Kings. On this ground the Apostle saith, Art thou called being a seruant? care not for it: 1 Cor. 7. 21, 22. and that vpon this reason, He that is called in the Lord being a seruant, is the Lords freeman. This reason is to be noted a∣gainst the conceit that most haue of a seruants place, that it is so meane and base as there can be no honour nor comfort in doing the duties thereof. But that is a foolish, and vniust con∣ceit: looke to Christ the highest master, and there is as much honour, and comfort in doing the duties of the lowest seruants place, as of the highest masters. §. 42. Of the third motiue, Gods will. The third reason is implied vnder this phrase, doing the III. will of God, which declareth the ground of seruants subiection. God in his word hath plainly made it knowne that it is his pleasure that they who are vnder the authority of masters should obey them, therefore as seruants would please God, they must obey: if they refuse to obey, they thwart the will of God. This also is a motiue of moment: for Gods will is that marke which euery one ought to aime at, and it is much vrged by the Holy Ghost, as a generall reason to all duty in these and such like phrases, 1 Thes. 4. 3. This is the will of God, 1 Pet. 2. 15. So is the will of God: vpon which ground we are exhorted to Ephef. 5. 17. vnderstand, and to Rom. 12. 2. proue what is the will of God. Good reason there is to presse this reason: for 1. Gods will is the very ground of goodnesse: things are therefore good because they are agreeable to Gods will: Gods will giueth the very being to goodnesse. 2. Gods will is a rule to square all our actions by, euen as the kings statutes and proclamations are to his subiects. 3. It is a perfect rule (the law of the Lord is perfect) so as we Psal. 19. 7. may be sure not to swerue, if we hold close thereunto.
4. It is a sufficient rule, it will giue euery one (and among other, seruants) direction how to carry themselues in euery thing they take in hand, yea in euery thing that appertaineth to them. For, Gods word is giuen to make vs perfect, thorowly 2 Tim. 3. 17. furnished vnto all good workes. 5. It is a good warrant to iustifie vs in all our actions: so as, going along with it, we need not care what any man can say against vs. If a man be sure that he haue statute law, or the kings proclamation on his side, he is bold. From this reason which is of such weight, I gather two pro∣positions to adde force to this motiue. 1. That seruants obey their masters, is no arbitrary matter, but a necessary duty: not left to his will whether he will doe it or no, but a thing whereunto he is bound: and that not on∣ly by ciuill constitutions of men, but also by a diuine institu∣tion of God: so as it is not only a matter of ciuill policy, but also of conscience, to be done for conscience sake. 2. That no creature can dispence with seruants, so as they should be exempted from doing their duty to their master. If they could, they were greater then God, and their will aboue Gods will. Among creatures, masters themselues are to be reckoned: now because it is Gods will that seruants should be in subiection, their masters cannot exempt them from it. Ma∣sters may let them goe free: but retaining them as seruants, they cannot exempt them from a seruants subiection. Where∣fore though masters be carelesse in exacting dutie, yet let ser∣uants be conscionable in yeelding duty, because it is Gods will. §. 43. Of the fourth reason, the reward of good seruice. The fourth reason is plainly and largely expressed in these IIII. words, Knowing that whatsoeuer good thing any man doth, the Sciat seruus Deum redditu∣rum seruitutis mercedem. Con∣stit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12. Col. 3. 24. same shall he receiue of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. The generall summe whereof is a Declaration of the reward of good seruice. To which purpose saith the Apostle to seruants in ano∣ther place, Of the Lordye shall receiue a reward. This first is to be noted to adde force to the former reasons.
For if any aske, what if masters stand in Christs stead, what maketh that to the purpose? surely it maketh much to moue seruants: because masters stand in his roome who will reward that which is done for his sake. If againe they aske, what benefit is it to be Christs seruant? it may be answered, very great: for Christ will reward all his seruants. If further it be asked, what is gotten by doing Gods will? Answ. Euen that which all aime at, reward for seruice. As this addeth weight to al the other reasons, so is it in it selfe a weighty reason, as weighty as any can be to our corrupt na∣ture. Hope of reward is it which maketh all sorts of people to take the paines which they doe in their seuerall places. But ha∣uing Treat. 1. §. 127. before handled this generall point of reward, I will here more distinctly shew what kinde of reward it is wherewith the Lord will recompence the good seruice of faithfull seruants. Gods reward is both of temporall and eternall blessings. The temporall blessings which heretofore God hath be∣stowed What reward God giueth to good seruants. on faithfull seruants, and which on that ground other like seruants may expect, are these especially. 1. He will moue masters to respect such seruants, as he mo∣ued Est. 6. 3. Ahash-verosh to recompence the fidelity of Mordecai. 2. If masters faile therein, he will moue strangers to recom∣pence them: as he moued Gen. 39. 21. the Iaylor to fauour Ioseph when his master had cast him in prison: and & 41. 40. Pharaoh to aduance him to great dignity. 3. To draw the hearts of their masters and others the more vnto them, he will make the things which they take in hand to prosper. Thus did he blesse Gen 39. 2. Ioseph, and & 24. 56. Abrahams ser∣uant. 4. In dealing for themselues he will blesse their labours, as he blessed Gen. 30. 43. Iaakobs. 5. He will, when they come to keepe seruants, prouide such seruants for them, as they were to their masters. Gen. 43. 23. In Egypt God blessed Ioseph with a faithfull seruant. Dauid, who 1 Sam. 17. 34. ven∣tured his life to saue his fathers sheepe, had 2 Sam. 21. 17. & 23. 15. many seruants that ventured their liues for him. To this purpose may be applied that prouerbe which
Christ oft vseth, Luk. 6. 38. with what measure yee mete shall it be measu∣red to you againe. The eternall reward is expressed in this phrase, Col. 3. 24. the reward of the inheritance, for that inheritance is meant which Christ mentioneth in this clause, Mat. 25. 34. Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world, and Saint Peter in this, 1 Pet. 1. 4. an inheritance incorruptible, and vnde∣siled, and that fadeth not away, reserued in heauen. What can be more said? What shall not be vndergone for this reward? How willingly doe prentises passe ouer their prentiship in hope of a temporarie freedome of an earthly citie? Gen. 29. 20. Many yeares seruice were but as a few daies to Iaakob because he liked his reward. But behold here a greater reward, which we must needs like much better. If this be not sufficient to moue seruants to all dutie, I know not what can be suffici∣ent.
The eighth Treatise. Duties of Masters. §. 1. Of the heads of Masters duties. EPHES. 6. 9. And yee Masters doe the same things vnto them: forbearing threatning: Knowing that your Master also is in heauen: neither is there respect of persons with him. IN the last place the duties of masters are declared by the Apostle, and that in this verse, where he noteth, 1. The kindes of their duties. 2. A Reason to enforce the same. The kindes are set forth Generally (doe the same things.) Particularly (forbearing threatning.) The reason is taken from that subiection wherein masters are to an higher master (knowing that your master also.) And it is amplified, 1. By the equall subiection of masters and seruants to that master (your also.) 2. By the place where that master is (in heauen.) 3. By his property, in this phrase (neither is there respect of persons with him.) Because the seuerall duties of masters are here but pointed at, and infolded vnder generall termes, I will (as in former
treatises hath beene done) propound a distinct order, where∣by we may the better finde out their duties, and handle them one after another. All may be drawne vnto these two heads. 1. Care in choosing good seruants. 2. Conscience in well vsing them. For well vsing their seruants, masters must haue an eie to their place, and authority: and in respect thereof, 1. Wisely maintaine their authority. 2. Rightly manage the same. The well managing of their authority is generally noted in this phrase, doe the same things: but more particularly in Col. 4. 1. ano∣ther place referred to these two branches 1. Iustice. 2. Equity. Of these in order. §. 2. Of masters choosing good seruants. The first thing that a man, who taketh vpon him to be a master, must take care of, is to entertaine good seruants into his seruice. Psal. 101. 6. Mine eies (saith Dauid) shall be vpon the faithfull of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a per∣fect way he shall serue me. What doth this phrase (mine eies shall be vpon the faithfull) imply, but that he will diligently and carefully inquire after such: yea mine eies (saith he) not another mans eies: he would not put all the trust vpon others: he would himselfe make what proofe and triall he could. Such an emphasis hath this phrase (mine eies) where Iob 19. 27. Iob saith; whom I shall see for my selfe, and mine eies shall behold, and not an∣other for me. 1. Seruants are of all other things (except wife and chil∣dren) Reasons. of best and greatest vse. If then men be carefull in well choosing other things, as houses, land, houshold-stuffe, horses, and all manner of cattell (as men are very circumspect therein) should they not be much more carefull in well choosing seruants? 2. Thus will masters shew that they seeke, and aime at the good of their family: yea and in their family at the good of Church and common-wealth: for good members of a family are likeliest to proue profitable to Church & common-wealth.
3. When good seruants are chosen, there is hope of recei∣uing the more good from them, and doing more good vnto them. They will be pliable to all good admonition, docible by all good instruction, seruiceable in all things they take in hand. Obiect. A master may make a bad seruant to become a good one. Answ. There is a great hazard and venture therein, espe∣cially if they be growne to ripe yeares: no creature is easily tamed, or brought from the naturall course it hath taken, af∣ter it is growne vp: a bough that hath growne crooked many yeares together will hardly be made straight. It is not in mans power to make a bad seruant good: neither can man expect Gods blessing therein, when he obserueth not a right course warranted by God. Quest. What course is fittest for choice of seruants? Direction for choosing of seruants. 1. If they be young, see how they haue beene from their in∣fancy educated. Great is the benefit of good education: and much good may be expected from thence: for it is the means which God hath sanctified for good. But if they be growne to ripe yeares, choose such as feare God, such were they vpon whom Psal. 101. 6. Dauid cast his eies. On this ground did Philem. vers 10. Saint Paul aduise Philemon to take Onesimus againe, because grace was then wrought in his heart. 1. Gods feare is the ground of all good obedience and Why such seruants as feare God are to be cho∣sen. faithfulnesse: note the examples of such good and faithfull seruants as are commended in Scripture, and you shall finde them all to feare God. 2. Such will not only be diligent in their worke, but they will also faithfully call vpon God to prosper those things which they take in hand in their masters be∣halfe, instance the example of Gen. 24. 12. Abrahams seruant. 3. God will haue such respect vnto those seruants which feare his name, as for their sakes to blesse their masters house. Thus was Gen. 39. 5. Potiphars house blessed for Iosephs sake. 2. Make some triall of their fitnesse to that calling, worke
and seruice whereunto thou shalt put them. From such there may be hope of profit & benefit by their seruice. Gen. 29. 14. Laban made triall of Iaakob a moneth before he couenanted for any long continuance. 3. Take such especially as are of meane and poore estate, and know not how to maintaine themselues but by seruice. Thus will a double worke of charitie be done therein: and thus maist thou looke for better seruice: for commonly such are most industrious, and most obedient to their masters. Obiect. When men haue taken all the care they can in their choice, they may be deceiued. Answ. 1. Then much more likely is it, that if they be carelesse therein, they shall be deceiued. 2. Diligent, and wise search, is a meanes to finde out the dispo∣sition and abilitie of seruants. 3. If hauing vsed the meanes men be deceiued, they may haue the more comfort in bearing the crosse, because they haue not wittingly or carelesly pulled it vpon themselues. §. 3. Of masters carelesnesse in chusing seruants. Contrary is their carelesnesse, who are ready to receiue any into their house, euen Atheists, Papists, swearers, swaggerers, profane wretches, vncleane persons, and such like, against whom Dauid protesteth, he would not haue him that worketh deceit to dwell in Psal. 101. 7. his house; nor him that telleth lies to tarrie in his sight. They who entertaine such, make their houses to be cages of vncleane birds, seminaries of wicked persons, and vnprofitable members: for one scabbed sheepe is enough to infect a whole flocke. No mar∣uell though many mischiefes fall vpon such a familie: for a man were as good bring so many Snakes and Adders into his house, as such persons: yea with them is brought Gods curse. Can any good then be looked for? Such foolish masters regard neither themselues, nor their houshold: no nor yet Church or Com∣mon-wealth. If none would entertaine such, it might be a meanes to make them alter their condition. Many are not only carelesse in chusing good seruants, but also except against such as are religious; thinking it a matter of re∣proach to entertaine them. By which conceit they oft put away Gods blessing from their house. Others so stand vpon a great portion of money with a prentise,
or a clerke, or other seruant, as they will take none but rich mens children. Whence it commeth to passe, that this point (which is a great point) of charitie is neglected: persons most vnfit for ser∣uice are entertained, and such many times as scorne to doe seruice. Thus their masters grow weary of them: the seruants lose their time: neuer proue to be their crafts-masters: and their parents repent the giuing of such a portion with them. §. 4. Of masters maintaining their authoritie. After that masters haue chosen good seruants, their dutie is well to vse them: which by reason of the difference betwixt masters and seruants cannot be well done, except masters wisely maintaine their authoritie. A master therefore must be able 1 Tim. 3. 4. . well to rule his owne house: this is a dutie which the Apostle in particular requi∣reth of a Bishop, who is master of an house, but it appertaineth in generall to all masters of families. Women also who by vertue of their places are mistresses, are commanded 1 Tim. 5. 14. . to guide the house, or to rule, and performe the part of a mistresse therein. It was the Mat. 8. 9. Centurions commendation, that hauing seruants vnder him, he had them at his command. 1. Gods image and authoritie, which a master carrieth, is thus pre∣serued. 2. Thus shall a master haue much better seruice done. Not one ser∣uant of a thousand, that is not kept vnder authoritie, will doe good ser∣uice. A like dutie to this was enioyned to an husband in relation to a wife, Treat. 4. §. 4. Some of the reasons, directions, & other points there handled, may be here applied. Read it therefore. For this end three things are to be obserued. Direction. 1. That masters carrie themselues worthy of their place, and worthy of that honour which is due to them: which may best be done by making themselues a patterne of such good things as in their places appertaine to them. Jos. 24. 15. I and my house will feare the Lord, saith Iosuah: he would not only put them to it, but he also would doe it, he would goe before them. I will behaue my selfe wisely, I will walke within my house with a perfect heart, saith Psal. 101. 2. Dauid. 2. That masters keepe their seruants in awe and feare. 1 Tim. 3. 4. Chil∣dren must be kept in subiection: much more seruants.
3. That masters doe the things which they doe in their cariage towards their seruants with authoritie: Command, forbid, rebuke (to vse Tit. 2. 15. the Apostles phrase) with all authoritie. The manner of speech which the Centurion vsed to his seruants (Mat. 8. 9. goe, come, doe this) sauour of authoritie. So the Church taking vpon her the person of a mistresse, vseth a word of authoritie, Cant. 3. 5. I charge you not to doe this. §. 5. Of masters making their authoritie to be despised. The aberrations in the defect contrary to the forenamed dutie How masters lose their ho∣nour. and point of wisdome, are many: as 1. When masters carrie themselues basely and abiectly before 1. By basenes. their seruants: being light in their behauiour, foolish in their ca∣riage, giuen to drunkennesse, vncleannesse, lewd companie, and other vices. Nabal was such an one: for his seruant could say of him, 1 Sam. 25. 17. He is a sonne of Belial. Dauid, though he did not giue himselfe ouer to such foule sinnes as these are, yet he oft failed in an vnseemly cariage before his seruants, as when 1 Sam. 21. 13. he changed his behauiour, and fained himselfe mad, and scrabled on doores, and let his spittle fall downe vpon his beard: and againe, 2 Sam. 19. 3, 5. when he gaue such reines to his passion, for the death of his traiterous sonne Absolom, as his people being ashamed stole away from him, and Ioab his seruant was forced roundly to tell him of it, saying, thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy seruants, &c. Mistresses oft lose their authoritie by conspiring with their seruants to goe abroad, take away goods, gossip, and doe such other like things priuily without their husbands consent: they make themselues thereby slaues to their seruants, not daring to doe any thing which may offend their seruants, lest they should discouer to their masters such lewd pranks as their Mistresses did. 2. When masters are too remisse and sheepish: intreating and 2. By remisnes. praying their seruants to doe such things as they ought to com∣mand and require at their hands: and if it be not done, all their remedie is patience, or else to doe it themselues. Howsoeuer this might be counted meeknesse, and gentlenesse towards equals and strangers, ouer whom we haue no authoritie, yet towards seruants it is too base remisnesse: yea it is a relin quishing of that power which God hath giuen, and whereof God will take an account. 3. When masters suffer their seruants to be their companions, 3. By familiari∣tie.
playing, drinking, reuelling with them, and saying (as it is in the prouerbe) haile fellowes met. Thus seruants oft take libertie to presume aboue their master: for men are naturally prone to ambi∣tion; and, if an inch be giuen, they will take an ell. They who in this kinde so farre debase themselues, as to giue their seruants power ouer their owne bodie, doe make both themselues, and their true lawfull bedfellow to be despised: themselues, in that such seruants as are so made one flesh, will thinke to keepe in awe such a master or mistresse, as they haue knowne, through feare of reuealing that sinne: their bedfellow, in that such seruants will thinke to be maintained, and boulstered vp by the master or mistresse, whom they haue so knowne. On this ground was Gen. 16. 3, 4. Sarah despised in the eyes of Hagar her maid. 4. When masters are ouer-ruled by their seruants to doe any 4. By letting goe the reines. vniust or vnlawfull thing: as 2 Chro. 14. 17. Ioash, who by his seruants was drawne to idolatrie: and Ier. 38. 5. Zedekiah, who gaue the Prophet Iere∣miah into his seruants hands, vsing this base and abiect speech, Ier. 38. 5. The King is not he that can doe any thing against you. Thus will seruants soone proue masters: and if they once come to this high pitch to rule, rather then to be ruled, they will quickly proue in∣tolerable. For Pro. 30. 22. this is one of the foure things noted by the Wise∣man, which the earth cannot beare, namely, a seruant when he reigneth: and Eccl. 10. 5, 7. this is one of those euils which proceed from rulers, that seruants ride vpon horses, that is, are aduanced aboue their place and degree: whence it followeth, that Eccl. 10. 5, 7. Gouernours walke as seruants vpon the earth, they are deiected below their place and degree. It falleth out in this case betwixt seruants and masters, as betwixt scoales, or ballances; if the weights that vse to lie in one ballance to keepe it downe be taken away, it will sud∣denly flie vp, and so the other ballance will be kept downe. §. 6. Of masters too great rigour. The contrary in the excesse is too great rigour and aufterity manifested in looke, speech, and actions. 1. In looke, when a master cannot cast a good eie on his ser∣uant. Gen. 31. 2, 5. Iaakob was much discountenanced by the countenance of his master. Many masters by their continuall frowning browes, and fiery eies, doe much terrifie their seruants. 2. In speech, when masters cannot giue a good word to their
seruants, but if they be moued neuer so little, cast vpon them all the reproachfull names that they can call to minde: little thinking of this fearfull doome, Mat. 5. 22. Whosoeuer shall say, thou foole, shall be in danger of hell fire. Thus did Saul manifest a malitious and mischieuous minde against Ionathan and Dauid by the foule language he gaue. Some haue such a froward and peruerse tongue, as they can neuer speake directly to their seruants: but if they command or forbid a thing, they will doe it after such a manner as their seruant can scarce tell what they meane: and this not only when their seruant hath offended them, but in their best mood. So shrewish are others, as their tongues seldome lie still: but they are euer chiding vpon euery small occasion: whereby it commeth to passe that their seruants are no more moued with it, then the Doues, and Stares that continually abide in Belfraies, are moued with the ringing of bels. Such bitternesse also is mixed with the childings of many, as they belch out of their blacke mouthes, most direfull imprecations. What can be said of such tongues, but that they are Iam. 3. 6. set on fire of hell? As other aberrations wherein masters are reproued, are to be applied to mistresses, so this especially. For mistresses doe commonly most offend in shrewishnesse of speech. 3. In actions, when masters are too frequent, and too furi∣ous Quamuis do∣minus seruo praestet, tamen se aequalem iudi∣cet quatenus homo existit. Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12. strikers: striking their seruants on euery occasion, not ca∣ring how they strike. In these and other like euidences of too much austeritie and plaine arrogancy masters forget that they are men. Though for outward order a master be more excel∣lent then a seruant, yet as a man he ought to iudge himselfe equall. This extreme can be no good meanes to maintaine authoritie: but it is a plaine abuse thereof. Masters ought so Serui colant potius te quàm timeant. Senec. epist. 47. to carrie themselues as their seruants may rather reuerence, then dread them. §. 7. Of masters commanding power restrained to things lawfull. Extent of ma∣sters power. That a master may the better know how to maintaine his authoritie, I will distinctly declare the extent of his power, and that in these foure particulars, 1. In Commanding. 2. In Cor∣recting. 3. In ordering the mariage of their seruants. 4. In dispo∣sing their person.
Within the lists of these two vertues Iustice and Equitie (whereunto all the duties which masters owe their seruants shall §. 20, 21, &c. afterward be referred) must the commanding power of masters be bounded. 1. Iustice requireth two things, 1. A restraint of masters commandements. 2. An execution thereof. The restraint is vnto Gods law, that a master command no∣thing against it, but what is agreeable to it. Abishai would Nothing vn∣lawfull to be commanded by masters. 1 Sam. 26. 9. faine haue had Dauids warrant to haue killed Saul: but Dauid was so farre from commanding him to doe it, as he kept him from it. Masters are but subordinate ministers vnder God: they must therefore command nothing against his law. As a Iudge, high-Sheriffe, and all other officers vnder the King, must make the Kings law the ground of all those things which they require of the Kings subiects: so masters must make Gods law the ground of all those things which they require of their ser∣uants, who are also the seruants of Christ. Besides, to what purpose is it to command that which a seruant may and must refuse to doe? But in no Treat. 7. §. 38 vnlawfull thing may he obey. §. 8. Of masters presuming aboue their authoritie. Contrary is the arrogancie and presumption of many ma∣sters, who make their owne will the rule of their seruants obe∣dience. This must needs be a leaden rule, which may be bowed this way, that way, and euery way, because of the flexible and variable humour of man. Hence is it that many most vile and horrible things are commanded, because they are agreeable to the commanders humour. Absolom bid his seruants commit a most detestable murder vpon his owne brother, and note how he presseth it, Haue not I commanded you? 2 Sam. 13. 28. More presumptuous is he that taketh vpon him to be the The Popes presumption. great commander of all Christians, the Pope of Rome, and other masters and gouernours of Iesuites, Friers, Monkes, and other like orders, who command such as are vnder their au∣thoritie to commit treasons, raise rebellions, kill Kings, and doe other like execrable villanies. And to iustifie the Pope from whom all inferiour gouer∣nours
receiue their power, and by whose will they must be ru∣led, these blasphemous positions doe Papists hold of his po∣wer, He can doe all things of right as God. He is as God hauing Extrauag. de maior. & obed. Alban. in lib. de potestat. Pap. & Eccles. Gratian. in Decret. dist. 40. on earth fulnesse of power. If he shall draw with him innumerable soules of men into hell, yet none may say to him, what doest thou? Doth not the Apostles 2 Thess. 2. 4. In Ecclesia cath. semper credi∣tum est Rom. Pontificem posse sua autho∣ritate leges ferre, quae in conscientia ob∣ligent. Bellar. de Rom. Pontif. l. 4. c. 15. description of that man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, agree to him of whom those things are spo∣ken? Is he not in Papists account, as God, shewing himselfe that he is God? Which is further confirmed by that power which they giue him of making lawes to binde the conscience, and coining new articles of faith. Not only popish, but profane masters also too much exceed in this presumptuous vse of their power aboue their power: as they who enioyne their seruants to kill, to steale, to sweare, to forsweare, to lie, to giue false measures, and weights, to goe to masse, to profane the Sabbath, with other like sinnes. In all these, and all other things like to these, being against Gods law, masters haue no power to command: they goe aboue their commission: and shall accordingly answer for it. §. 9. Of masters commanding seruants to doe their dutie. 2. The execution of a masters commanding power con∣sisteth in those things which God hath enioyned as bounden duties. These a master by vertue of his authoritie must com∣mand his seruants to doe: as to worship God, to sanctifie his Sabbath, to be diligent and conscionable in his calling, with other like duties, which God compriseth vnder these words, the way of the Lord, righteousnesse and iudgement: and saith that he knew that Abram would command his houshold to doe them. Gen. 18. 19. The charge giuen to masters in the fourth commandement concerning seruants, (thou nor thy man-seruant, nor thy maid∣seruant) Exo. 20. 10. proueth as much. Iosiah is commended for causing his 2 Chr. 34. 32. people to stand to the couenant of God. On this ground if a ma∣ster haue seruants that are papists, separatists, or profane per∣sons, he ought to command them, and cause them to goe to the holy ordinances of God. It is one of the principall ends why God hath giuen power and authoritie to some ouer others, that by their authoritie they may cause them which are vnder them to obserue the
commandements of God: euen as inferiour officers haue au∣thoritie giuen them, to see the Kings lawes kept. §. 10. Of the sinne of masters in suffering seruants to neglect their dutie. It is contrary to that commanding power which God hath giuen to masters, to suffer their seruants to omit, and neglect those bounden duties which God hath commanded them: as if a seruant be so popish or profane as to refuse to goe to the word, or Sacrament, or to performe any dutie whereunto he is bound, to let him alone. Though they themselues doe those duties, and though they doe not hinder and keepe their ser∣uants from doing them, yet if they cause not their seruants also to doe them, they make themselues accessarie to their ser∣uants sinne. Obiect. Euery mans conscience is free, and cannot be forced; therefore masters may not compell seruants to such things as are against their conscience. Answ. Though the conscience be free to a man, and out of anothers power, yet their outward actions are not free: and though faith, pietie, righteousnesse, nor any grace can be forced into men, yet they may be forced to vse the meanes which God hath sanctified for the breeding and increasing of them. Though they cannot be forced to haue a religious and righte∣ous heart, yet they may be forced to doe religious and righte∣ous duties: or if a master cannot force these, yet he may and ought to doe his vttermost endeuour: by which means though he cannot free his seruant from death, yet he shall free his owne soule from the guilt of his death. §. 11. Of a masters wisdome in ordering things indifferent. Equitie hath respect to those things which are in a masters power to command or not command: such are all ciuill acti∣ons as concerne himselfe, concerning the particulars whereof God hath giuen no direct charge for an absolute performance of them: as to goe of such an errand, to doe such a message, to dispatch such a businesse. Concerning these things I may say of a masters power, as the Apostle doth of a parents power in 1 Cor. 7. 36, 37. another case; If he seeth it meet to be done, and commandeth his seruant to doe it, he doth well, he sinneth not. If he seeth it
not meet to be done, and commandeth it not, he doth also well, he sinneth not. Of this kinde of things speaketh the Centurian, Matt. 8. 9. where he saith, I say to one, goe, to another, come, to a third, doe this. The marke which masters must aime at in commanding or forbidding these, must be expediency: for all things that are 1 Cor. 10. 23. lawfull, are not expedient. Expediency dependeth much vpon circumstances, and consequences which may follow vpon the doing of any thing: in obseruing whereof the wisdome of him who hath power to haue a thing done, or not done, especially appeareth. When Dauid suffered not Hushai his good friend, 2 Sam. 15. 33, 34. and wise counseller, to goe with him when he fled from Ab∣solom, but bid him returne to the citie and there abide, he had an eie to the good consequence that might follow thereupon. And when Ioab commanded Cushi rather then Ahimaaz to 2 Sam. 18. 20, 21. carrie the newes of Absoloms death, he had an eie to the meet∣nesse of the persons, and to the kinde of message. To apply this to our purpose, Equity requireth that ma∣sters (in commanding things indifferent, which they haue power to command or not to command) haue an eie to their seruants ability, sex, age, disposition, conscience, and other like circumstances, that the thing which they command be some∣what agreeable to them, not aboue their ability, not vnbesee∣ming their sex, not vnfitting their age, not thwarting their dis∣position, not against their conscience. §. 12. Of masters offence against expediency. It is contrary to equity for a master to regard only himselfe, and his own mind, euen in things that are lawfull. Paul was not 1 Cor. 10. 33. of this minde, when he said, He sought not his owne profit: no nor his owne will. Expediency and inexpediency were great motiues vnto him, to forbeare things which were otherwise lawfull: yet little is this regarded by many: for 1. Many command things to the very vttermost of their ser∣uants strength, if not aboue it, (as Pharaoh) or else things dan∣gerous, Exod. 5. 7. which may bring much mischiefe vpon them. Dauid 2 Sam. 23. 17. was touched in heart for mouing only by a wish his seruants to fetch him water with the danger of their liues.
2. Others against comelinesse put men to doe maids workes, and maids to doe mens worke. 3. Others vpon meere partiality keepe vnder old and good seruants, and preferre much younger before them. 4. Others will forcibly make seruants doe things against their naturall disposition, as to handle, yea and eat such things as they cannot endure to touch or see. 5. Others in doubtfull matters will vrge and presse them against their conscience. Howsoeuer in these and other such like things not vnlaw∣full, seruants ought to doe what they can to satisfie their ma∣sters command, if he be peremptory in vrging them: yet ought not a master to be too peremptory in pressing his authoritie and power. §. 13. Of the power of masters to correct their seruants. The second point wherein a masters power consisteth is cor∣rection: which may be giuen by lookes, words, or deeds. By a mans looke his anger and wrath against another is manifested.  In Hebrew the same word signifieth a face, and wrath: because wrath soonest sheweth it selfe in a mans face. It is noted of Cain, that being very wrath his countenance fell Si quis in domo per inobedienti∣am domesticae paci aduersa∣tur, corripiatur seu verbo, seu verbere, sea quo. libet alio gene∣re poenae iusto at{que} licito. Aug. de Ciu. Deil. 19. c. 16. downe, Gen. 4. 5. Now the manifestation of a masters wrath a∣gainst his seruant is a correction. But words whether of rebuke, or threatning, doe much more declare the same. This phrase which Solomon vseth Pro. 29. 19. (a seruant will not be corrected with words) sheweth that there is a correction by words: and though it be negatiuely pro∣pounded, yet doth it not imply that correction by words is not to be vsed to a seruant, but rather, if thereby he be not mo∣ued, that blowes must be added thereto: which is a correction by deeds, whereof Christ maketh mention in the parable of those seruants that according to the greatnesse of their fault are Luke 12. 47. to be beaten with many stripes. It is therefore in a masters power to correct his seruant with stripes, or blowes. Which being so, I will shew, 1. How farre his power herein extendeth. 2. How it is to be ordered.
§. 14. Of the restraint of masters power: that it reacheth not to their seruants life. Concerning the extent of a masters power in correcting his seruant, this question is to be resolued, Whether a master haue power for any fault to take away his seruants life. Answ. His power reacheth not so farre, as is euident by these reasons. 1. There is no precept, nor approued example, nor any other warrant out of Gods word for it. The Iewes had great power ouer such seruants as were strangers: Of them they might Leu. 25. 44, 45, 46. buy bond-men and bond-maids: they might haue them for a pos∣session: and take them for an inheritance for their children after them, to be bond-men for euer: they might be put to the most toyling, droyling, base, and abiect workes that they had, as drawing water, hewing wood, and the like; but yet their ma∣sters Ios. 9. 27. had not power ouer their liues. 2. A master might not dismember his seruant: if vnawares he did smite out an eie or tooth of his seruant, he must make a recompence: which was to let him goe free. Much lesse there∣fore Exod. 21. 26. might he take away his seruants life. 3. If a seruant died vnder his masters hand when he cor∣rected him, though he intended not wilfully to murder him, that master was to be punished. It was not therfore lawfull for Exod. 21. 20. a master wittingly to kill a seruant. 4. The power of life is proper to the publike magistrate, who doth all things in open publike places, that so there may be many witnesses of his iust proceeding. If masters had this power, many might priuily be put to death, and no man know for what cause, as it is in popish inquisitions. 5. Si Dominus seruum cecide∣rit, vel lethale vulnus inflixe∣rit, reus homici∣dij sit. Iustin. Cod. l. 9. tit. 18. The approued lawes of men make it wilfull murder for a master to slay his seruant wittingly, though the seruants fault be neuer so hainous. Neither the authority of the master, nor desert of the seruant, shall exempt the master that slayeth his seruant from the guilt and punishment of felony. Obiect. In ancient times masters had this power. Answ. They neuer of right had it, though some might ex∣ercise it. Among Gods people it was neuer exercised in any age of the world. That liberty which was taken, was among
the heathen: and yet among them as polities came to be more Apud Gentes animaduertere possumus Do∣minis in seruos vitae, necis{que} po∣testatem fuisse. Sed hoc tempore nullis homini∣bus qui sub im∣perio nostro sunt, licet fine causa legibus cognita in ser∣uos suos supra modum saeuire Nam ex constit. Antonini qui sine cause ser∣uum suum occi∣derit, non mi∣nus puniri iube∣tur, quam si ali∣enum seruum occiderit. Iustin. Jnstit. l. 1. Tit. 8. Domini mitio∣res esse debent. Cypr. Testim. l. 3. c. 73. and more ciuilly gouerned, that vsurped liberty by the lawes of Magistrates was much restrained: and when Emperors and Kings became Christians, it was vtterly taken away. Obiect. If a man take an enemie by warre, he hath power to kill him. Answ. If in the time of the warre he slay him not, but then spare him, and take him as a captiue, and make him his ser∣uant, though but a bondslaue, he hath not power of his life. §. 15. Of masters excesse in correcting seruants. Contrary to their iust and due power doe they, who in their rage stab their seruants, or otherwise make them away: yea they also who so vnmercifully and vnmeasurably beat them with rod, cudgell, or any other thing, as death follow there∣upon: for many there be who hauing once begunne to strike, know not when to cease, but lay on as if they were striking stocks and blocks, and not their owne flesh. God foresaw that masters were prone to such cruelty, and therefore Deut. 25. 3. set a stint number of stripes, which none that beat another might ex∣ceed. Among these may be reckoned such desperate masters as in their moode will strike their seruant with any thing that com∣meth next to hand, be it heauy, cragged, hard, or sharpe, they care not (Pro. 26. 18. As a mad man who casteth fire-brands, arrowes, and death.) These things may endanger a seruants life, if not, they may breake his head, or otherwise wound, bruise, and lame him. It is beyond a masters power by any correction to impaire life, health, or strength of his seruant, or any way in his body to disable him from doing that which otherwise he might haue beene able to doe. If masters, no not for punishment of any sinne, may not take away or endanger the life of his seruant, what may we thinke of such masters, as without any fault of their seruants, cause them to be made away by putting them vpon some de∣sperate attempt, either to maintaine their owne quarrell, or for some other vniust end? 2 Sam. 11. 15. Dauid dealt thus with Uriah: but afterwards he Psal. 51. 14. sorely repented this part of iniustice. At ano∣ther
2 Sam. 23. 15, &c. time when three of his seruants had fetched him water, which he longed for, with ieopardy of their liues, though in safety they returned, yet his heart smote him for his longing, and he would not drinke of that water because they had ventu∣red their liues to fetch it. But what may we say of such masters, as cause their seruants for their sakes to commit felony, murther, treason, rebellion, and such other things, as cause the publike magistrate to vn∣sheath his sword against them, & cut them off? We noted this §. 8. before to be a grienous fault in regard of the vnlawfulnesse of the thing: here further we may note it to be much more hainous in regard of the mischiefe that followeth thereupon, which is the losse of their seruants life: so as thus they make themselues accessary to a detestable sinne, and guilty of the bloud of their seruant. §. 16. Of masters ordering that correction they giue to their seruants. 2. That masters may well order that correction which they giue to their seruants, difference must be put be∣twixt the age, sex, disposition, and faults of those whom they correct. 1. Masters ought not to be so forward to strike such as are growne in yeares, as the younger sort. Yeares bring vn∣derstanding, and a rebuke will make one of vnderstanding more sory for a fault, and more carefull to amend it, The direction prescribed to pa∣rents (Treat. 6. §. 47.) for well ordering that cor∣rection which they giue to their chil∣dren, may in many points be here fitly applied. Read it. then blowes: smart more workes vpon the younger sort. But if notwithstanding their yeares they be stout, and will not regard words, their stoutnesse. must be beaten downe with blowes. Pro. 19. 25, 29. Smite a scorner, saith the wise man: and againe, Iudgements are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the backe of fooles. Seeing seruants in yeares are in this case to be corrected, it is further requisite to put a difference betwixt the kinde or measure of correction which is giuen to them, and to the younger sort: if they be corrected as children, they may either
make a toy of it, or the more disdaine at it. Pro. 20. 30. Heris in famu∣los saeuitia ad∣hibenda est, si aliter teneri non possunt. Cic. Offic. l. 2. Blewnesse, wound, and stripes piercing into the inward parts of the belly, are a pur∣ging medicine against euill, to stout seruants of ripe yeares. 2. If there be a master and mistresse ioynt gouernours ouer an house, it is fittest for the master to correct men-seruants, the mistresse maids. Seruam ver∣berare viro maximae igno∣miniae est. Chrys. hom. 26. in 1 Cor. 11. Abraham put his maid ouer to Sarah in such a case. Yet if a maid should wax stout, and mannish, and turne against her mistresse, she being weake, sickly, with child, or otherwise vnable to master her maid, the master may and must beat downe her stoutnesse and rebellion: Exo. 21. 20. so much did the law of God permit. 3. If seruants be of an ingenious disposition, willing and forward to doe that which belongeth vnto them, sorry when they haue committed a fault, and carefull to amend their faults, many things may be passed ouer in them, which must be corrected in others. To this may be applied the coun∣sell of the wiseman, Take no heed to all the words that are Eccl. 7. 21. spoken. 4. Correction must be measured according to the great∣nesse —Adsit Regula peccat is quae poenas ir∣roget aequas: Nec scutica dignum horri∣bili sectere fla∣gello. Horat. l. 1. Sat. 3. of the fault punished, and the circumstances whereby the fault may iustly be aggrauated. The seruant that knew his masters will and did it not shall be beaten with many stripes: But he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes, Luk. 12. 47, 48. Many aberrations are daily committed contrary to euery branch of this direction, in that masters and mistresses in exer∣cising this part of their power are carried away with passion, and doe that which they doe in this kinde after their owne pleasure. Thus they turne a dutie into sinne, and by vndue cor∣recting of their seruants prouoke God to correct them in his wrath, either here or in the world to come. §. 17. Of masters power ouer their seruants in and about their mariage. The third point to be noted concerning a masters power ouer his seruant, is about his seruants mariage. Sundry que∣stions
are moued about this point, which I will briefly resolue. 1. Quest. Haue masters power to order and dispose their seruants mariage as they please? Answ. No, not without the free consent of the seruants themselues: for mariages must be made with the free consent of the parties that are maried. Obiect. The law implieth that a master hath power to giue Exo. 21. 4. his seruant a wife, for it sheweth whose those children shall be that are borne to that seruant, to whom a master hath giuen a wife. Answ. 1. That law is to be vnderstood of such seruants as being strangers were bond-slaues, ouer whom masters had a more absolute power then ouer others. 2. The masters power of giuing did not simply force the seruant to marie the party so giuen: but restrained the seruant from marying any other then whom the master should giue. 2. Quest. Is not a masters power in the matter of mariage as great ouer a seruant, as a parents ouer a childe? Answ. No. See the reason Treat. 5. §. 20. 3. Quest. May a master denie his seruant liberty to marie? Answ. Yea, for the time that the seruant hath couenanted to be a seruant with his master. For that time a seruant is part of his masters goods, and possessions. As bond seruants were a masters possession for euer: so couenanted seruants are his possession for the time of their couenant. When God gaue the deuill leaue to seize on all that Iob had, by vertue of that Iob 1. 15, 16. permission he seized on all kindes of Iobs seruants bond and free, as well as on his goods: which he could not haue done, if Iobs seruants had not beene as his goods. Yet notwithstanding if seruants shall make it knowne to their master, that necessity requireth they should marie, such respect ought to be had to the chastity euen of seruants, as in this case I may vse the phrase with the Apostle vseth in reference to children, Let them be maried. 1 Cor. 7. 36. 4. Quest. What if seruants marie without consent of ma∣sters, is that mariage nullified thereby? Answ. No. The mariage being otherwise rightly per∣formed, Quod fieri non debet factum valet. remaineth a firme mariage: though the seruants in
so doing haue sinned: for which their master may iustly pu∣nish them. 5. Quest. May a master keepe his seruants so maried with∣out his consent from their bed-fellowes? Answ. He may exact the whole time of his couenant for seruice: but that power which by the bond of mariage hus∣bands and wiues haue ouer one anothers bodies, suffereth 1 Cor. 7. 3, 4. them not to be altogether separated one from another. Be∣sides, our law freeth a maid-seruant when she is maried, from her masters couenant. §. 18. Of masters rigour in forcing mariages on seruants: or in separating man and wife. Contrary to a masters power doe they, who force their ser∣uants to marie whom they like not: as when a master hath defloured his maid, to couer his shame he will make one of his seruants marie her. They also doe contrary to their power who seeke to sepa∣rat their seruants that are maried from their bed-fellow: some will keepe the man at his house day and night from his wife, and so the wife from her husband: others will send one of them into remote parts of the land, where the other shall not know: yea others will be sure to keepe them one from ano∣ther, for they will send one of them beyond sea for many yeares together, if not for euer. These practises are against the law of mariage, and too rigorous and vniust. §. 19. Of masters power to dispose their seruants persons. The fourth point to be noted of a masters power ouer his seruants respecteth their persons, which so properly belong to a master for the time of their seruice, as he may not only keepe them himselfe for his owne seruice, but also passe them ouer, and giue, or sell them to another. By Gods law not only Leu. 25. 39, 44. strangers, but Iewes also might be sold for seruants. The customes and statutes of our land doe also permit ma∣sters Masters care in putting off seruants. to make ouer their seruants from one to one: and on their death-beds to bequeath them to whom they will, euen as their goods and possessions. That this power be not abused, in the executing thereof,
masters must principally respect the good of their seruants: and for that end put them ouer to fit masters, such masters as may doe them good and not euill, all the time of their abode with them, and seruice vnder them. Contrary hereunto doe they, who aime meerely at their owne aduantage, not caring to whom they put ouer their seruants, so they may make gaine thereby. Some will sell them, namely, when they haue them beyond sea, to Turks and Infidels; some to Pa∣pists, and other Idolaters; some to profane persons; some to cruell inhumane beasts; some to men of vnlawfull trades; some to men of no trades. Such masters as make their seruants ouer to such as these are, or like to these, shall answer for all the wrong is done to them. §. 20. Of masters well managing their authoritie. This Apostle in Coloss. 4. 1. . another place giueth this charge to masters, Giue vnto your seruants that which is iust and equall. By doing these two things masters shall well manage their authoritie. Iustice respecteth the place, and seruice of seruants. Difference be∣twixt iust and equall dealing. Equitie respecteth their minde, and manner of doing seruice. All seruants, in that they are seruants, and doe their masters worke, must haue that which of right belongeth to seruants. This is Iustice. Such seruants as beare an especiall loue and liking to their masters, doing seruice not by constraint, or with eye-seruice, as men-pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart with good will, and all good faithfulnesse, seeking to the vttermost of their power, their masters good, must be accordingly respected and dealt withall. This is Equitie. As the Apostle compriseth Iustice vnder this phrase (doe the same things) for seruice giue due recompence: so more especially he compriseth Equitie vnder it: for seruants good will and more then vsuall respect of their masters, let masters returne good will, and more then ordinarie respect to seruants. S. Peter noteth these two vertues vnder two other words, good, 1 Pet. 2. 18. gentle: A masters goodnesse hath relation to Iustice: his gentle∣nesse to Equitie.
§. 21. Of masters endeuouring the saluation of their seruants. That Iustice which is required of masters respecteth the soule, bodie, and estate of their seruants. In respect of their soules good, masters must seeke the spiri∣tuall I. Iusti patres se∣cundum haec temporalia bo∣na, filiorum sortem à seruo∣rum conditione distinguebant: ad Deum autem colendum, in quo aeterna bona speranda sunt, omnibus domus suae membris pari dilectione consulebant. Aug. de Ciu. Dei l. 19. c. 15. edification of their seruants. When Zacheus first beleeued, Christ said, Saluation is come to this house (Luk. 19. 9.) why to this house, rather then to this person, but because he knew that Zacheus would doe the dutie of a good master, and seeke the sal∣uation of his houshold? Herein must masters beare an impartiall respect to all in their house: as the holy Fathers, who though about temporall goods they put difference betwixt the place of children, and condition of seruants; yet in seruing God, where∣in eternall happinesse is looked for, they did with an equall re∣spect prouide for all the members of their house. The proofes alleadged for seruants obedience to masters care in this point, doe shew that this dutie appertaineth to masters. See Treat. 7. §. 15. The respect which masters owe to God, themselues, their ser∣uants, the Church, and Common-wealth where they liue, requi∣reth as much. 1. God hath commanded as much (Deut. 6. 7.) as this charge implieth, Thou shalt talke of my Lawes when thou sittest in thine house: and God hath manifested his approbation thereof, by commending Abraham for commanding his children and house∣hold to keepe the way of the Lord, Gen. 18. 19. 2. Masters themselues reape great benefit by a faithfull dis∣charge De salute eorum qui in domo tua sunt sollicitus, ac peruigil exi∣stas, quia pro omnibus tibi subiectis rationē Domino reddes. Aug. de salut. docum. cap. 29. of this dutie: and that both by discharging a good consci∣ence to God, (who requireth this at their hands, in that he hath made them prophets and priests in their house, as well as kings; and will require an account of them for all that are vnder their gouernment:) and also by bringing their seruants to doe more faithfull seruice to them. For there is no such meanes to stirre vp seruants to doe all good dutie, as the feare of God planted in their hearts. That seruant that shall finde true grace either first wrought, or further increased in him by his mastersmeanes, will thinke him selfe so beholding to such a master, as he shall neuer be able to make any sufficient recompence, & therefore will endeuour to do what good seruice he can in way of thankfulnes: he will not only be faithfull & diligent in his businesse, but he will call vpon God
to prosper his seruice for his masters good, and to recompence that kindnesse which his master hath done to him. 3. No earthly thing that a master can doe for his seruant (be it portion of money, preferment to any place of profit or credit, or skill in a good trade and calling) can be comparable to the edify∣ing of a seruant in grace. 4. Seruants well instructed in pietie are likeliest to proue most profitable not only to the familie, but also to the Church and Common-wealth where they liue. That masters may the better edifie their seruants, 1. They must daily instruct them in the principles of religion, Directions for edifying ser∣uants. and all duties of pietie: admirable is the profit which will arise from a daily and constant vse of religious exercises: though but a little time be spent at once, yet will much knowledge be gained by a frequent vse of them. This dutie is so much the more ne∣cessarie, because publike Ministers cannot take such particular notice of euery seruant in their Parishes, as masters may in their families. 2. Masters must cause their seruants to goe to the publike mini∣sterie of the word, and worship of God, to be further built vp thereby, and confirmed in their faith. Masters vnder the Law were Exo. 12. 44. commanded to let their seruants eat of the Passeouer, which was a solemne sacrament. The Law which enioyneth all males to ap∣peare Deut. 16. 16. on the solemne feast dayes before the Lord, implieth that seruants also should goe. This dutie must especially be performed on the Lords day: for the charge giuen to masters in the fourth commandement for sanctifying that day, is extended to seruants in these words, Thou, nor thy man-seruant, nor thy maid-seruant. 3. Masters, beside instructing seruants at home, and causing them to goe to Church, must take an account of their profiting, both by the publike, and also by the priuate meanes of edification. Otherwise they shall not know how to order their manner of in∣structing them: when to giue them milke, & when strong meat. 4. To make the meanes more effectuall and profitable, they must to instruction adde prayer. Meanes, without Gods blessing vpon the meanes, are nothing. As they obserue any grace wrought in their seruants, they must be thankfull vnto God for the same, and pray for the increase of it.
§. 22. Of masters neglecting to edifie their seruants. Contrary is the minde and practise of most masters: they thinke if they allow their seruants sufficient diet, lodging, and clothing, or wages according to their couenant, they haue done all that they need to doe: and answerably they doe no more: wherein they shew themselues no better then the heathen. For doe not the heathen so? Obiect. At first taking of a seruant no more was couenanted. Answ. There are two couenants whereunto a master standeth bound: one with God; the other with his seruant. Though his couenant with his seruant requireth no more then some tempo∣rall commodities, yet Gods couenant requireth spirituall edifica∣tion. Many masters are so greedie of their seruants worke, as they are loth to afford any time, at morning or euening, for religious exercises: they thinke by their seruants labour to thriue, and thinke not of Gods blessing which maketh rich. Some goe so far therein, as they keepe their seruants from the publike worship of God, euen on the Lords day. Thus it commeth to passe, that ser∣uants, who came ignorant and profane to a master, after long abode with him, so goe away as they came. Many that themselues make some conscience of fearing God, much faile herein: they re∣gard not to teach their seruants the feare of God, whereby they depriue themselues of much blessing, and pull Gods curse vpon their persons and houses. §. 23. Of allowing seruants sufficient food. In regard that seruants haue not bodies of brasse, or steele, II. but of flesh and bloud as all others, masters that haue the benefit of their strength and abilitie of their bodies, must be carefull of nourishing, and cherishing them: and that both in health, and sicknesse. For preseruing seruants health, respect must be had to their Food, Clothing, Labour, Rest. A due prouision of food for seruants is commended in Solo∣mons Sufficient food to be allowed to seruants. Pro. 31. 15. & 27. 27. good house-wife, who giueth meat to her houshold. And in the direction which he giueth to housholders, in these words, Let the milke of thy goats be sufficient for thy food, and for the food of thy family. The food which masters prouide for their seruants must be
for qualitie, good and wholesome; for quantitie, sufficient to preserue health and increase strength; for time, giuen in due season. It is noted that the hired seruants of the father of the Luk. 15. 17. prodigall childe had bread (by bread according to the Scripture phrase is meant all kinde of needfull wholsome food: in which sense it must needs be there taken, because it is opposed to huskes, which are not very wholsome, fitter for swine then men) yea they had bread enough. It is further noted of that good steward who was, as a master, ruler ouer the houshold, that Luk. 12. 42. he gaue the houshold their portion of meat in due season. Quest. May not seruants be stinted of their food? Answ. In regard of superfluitie they may and ought to be stinted, but not in regard of sufficiencie. It is not meet that all seruants should haue as much as they can deuoure: for then ma∣ny of them would doe but little worke: but most meet it is that euery one should haue as much as is needfull for strength, that so he may be the better able to doe and endure his worke: the Greeke word translated in the Luk. 12. 42. . place before quoted por∣tion, implieth as much. There is a double bond to tie masters to performe this dutie: one in regard of themselues: the other in regard of their seruants. Masters themselues shall haue the profit and benefit of the health and strength of their seruants: for their owne sakes therefore it is requisite to afford them sufficient food. Men that desire to haue their worke well done by their beasts, or in their iourney to be well carried to the end thereof, will be care∣full that their beasts shall be well fed. But beside this, considering the health and strength of ser∣uants is spent in their masters businesse, iustice requireth that their health and strength should be repaired and preserued by them. §. 24. Of defect and excesse in allowing seruants food. There are two extremes contrary to this dutie. One of those that are too niggardly, and (as we speake) miserable in the allowance of food to their seruants: and that sometimes in the quantitie, when seruants bellies are too much pinched: euen so as their bodies are weakned for want of food. The Prodi∣gall
childe was thus serued: these are both vniust and iniuri∣ous Luk. 15. 16. masters: vniust to their seruants: iniurious to their ser∣uants, and themselues too. Sometimes againe such miserable masters offend in the qualitie of that food which they giue to their seruants, as when it is kept too long, and growne musty, mouldy, or otherwise vnsauoury: or when the worst kinde of food, for cheapnesse sake, is bought, euen such as is scarce fit for mans meat: the more abundance that there is of such stuffe, the more loathsome it is. Lastly, though I thinke it not meet to binde masters vnto set houres for their seruants meales (Christ affordeth a greater Luk. 17. 7, &c. libertie vnto masters, in the parable of a masters vsage of his seruant after he came from his worke) yet there may be a fault, as there is, in many masters, in keeping their seruants too long from meat, not suffering them to interrupt their worke for meat sake, but to tarry for their supper till ten a clocke at night, when they giue ouer worke: surely this cannot be good for the bodies health and strength. Another extreme doe such masters fall into, as bring vp their Pro. 29. 21. seruants too delicatly. Solomon hath expresly taxed such, and noteth that this mischiefe is like to follow thereupon, he shall haue him become his sonne at the length: such a seruant will for∣get his place, scorne to be as a seruant, but aspire to be as his masters childe, which is next to a masters mate. §. 25. Of masters care about their seruants apparell. A wise care for seruants cloathing is also commended in the example of Solomons good housewife, She is not afraid of the snow for her houshold, that is, for the coldest season in win∣ter, for all her houshold are clothed with Pro. 31. 21.  double garments: that is, with such clothing as is fit for cold weather. Fit and decent apparell is both a meanes of preseruing health, and also a matter of good report, tending to the credit of a master. Yet contrary is the humour of many: they care not how tagged and ragged their seruants apparell is: insomuch as many ser∣uants haue neither comely nor warme apparell. The Hebrew word is oft vsed for scarlet. But accor∣ding to the proper notati∣on of it, it signifieth things doubled: which I take to be most pertinent to this place, and therefore I haue so translated it. The Kings translators haue noted as much in the margin.
This point concerneth those masters especially that finde their seruants (as we speake) and prouide all things for them: as in old time masters did for most seruants, and as now they doe for prentises whether male or female. If seruants by coue∣nant be at their owne finding for apparell, masters are not so strictly bound therein: yet they must haue a care that their ser∣uants fall neither into the one extreme of too base, slouen-like, or sluttish apparell, nor into the other of too garish, or too costly apparell. Masters hauing authority ouer their seruants, must keepe them in order and good compasse, and haue respect to decencie in this as in other things. For apparell is one of those outward signes whereby the wisdome of masters and mi∣stresses in well gouerning their seruants is manifested to the world. If therefore seruants be attired vnseemly for their place and abilitie, all that see them will thinke their masters and mistresses are of such a minde as the seruants are, or at least too remisse and carelesse of their gouernment. §. 26. Of moderating seruants labour. Though labour and paines be proper to a seruants place, yet he may be so put vnto it, as the health and strength of his body may be impaired thereby. For the well ordering of this therefore a dutie lieth vpon masters: and that in two things especially. 1. That they well moderate the labour whereunto they put their seruants, so as they may be able for the time to vndergoe it, and to endure so long as their time of labour is appointed. It was a good reason which Saul rendred to keepe Dauid from 1 Sam. 17. 33. entring combat with Goliah, because (as he thought) Dauid was not able to fight against the Philistim, Dauid being a youth, and Goliah a man of warre. And indeed if Dauids faith had not exceeded the strength of his body, it had beene vnmeet to haue put Dauid to that taske. They which are put to things aboue their abilitie, are like to faile, and sinke vnder the burden of them. It is contrary hereunto to put seruants to such hard taskes
as impaire their strength, endanger their lims, and venture their liues. Saul shall rise vp in iudgement against such: for he supposing that it was too hard a taske for Dauid to vndertake combat with Goliah, was loth to put him to it. Dauid excee∣dingly 1 Sam. 17. 33. failed herein, when he gaue direction that Vriah should be set in the forefront of the hottest battell, and yet the Generall 2 Sam. 11. 15, with his strength to retire from him. Many seruants being put to seruices aboue their strength, either lose their liues there∣by, or (as we speake) are neuer their owne men againe. It is also a fault in this kinde, to put seruants to such toiling Memineris ser∣uos homines esse. Cato. Exo. 1. 13, 14. workes as are fitter for beasts then men: or to oppresse them with too much worke, as the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites. Let Gods hearing the cry of those seruants so oppressed, and reuenging their oppressors for it, make all masters take heed & 3. 7. of the like crueltie. §. 27. Of affording seruants fit meanes for their worke. 2. The other thing required of masters for wel ordering their seruants worke is, that they afford their seruants things need∣full, and behouefull for that worke whereunto they are put: which minde was commendable in Saul, who assaied if his 1 Sam. 17. 38. armour might be fit for Dauid when he was to goe against Go∣liah. To reckon vp all the particulars were an infinite taske: euery seuerall trade and worke hath proper meanes of helpe appertaining to it: this generall direction may be sufficient to moue masters to applie it to the particular workes and seruices whereunto they put their seruants. Fit meanes are such an helpe, as that which with them may easily be done, without them can hardly, if possibly at all be done. It is contrary hereunto to deale with seruants as the Egypti∣ans did with the Israelites, exacting worke at their hands, and Exo. 5. 7. not affording them meanes to doe it: whereby many times they exact impossibilities. Some will haue much worke done in the night time, and not afford candle light: so in other par∣ticulars. §. 28. Of affording seasonable rest to seruants. Intermission, ease, and rest from labour at seasonable times, is as needfull and requisite, as food and apparell. The reason which God rendreth of the fourth commandement sheweth
that masters ought to afford rest to their seruants: it is this, that Deut. 5. 14. thy seruant may rest. Without intermission and rest the body cannot endure la∣bour: it will wax weake, faint, and vtterly vnable to continue: but, as labour decaieth strength, so rest repaireth it. There are two especiall times of rest, which seruants may not be denied. 1. The rest of the night. 2. The rest of the Lords day. The first is ordinary for all liuing creatures: for it was one Seruants must rest in the night time. principall-reason why God caused the light of the Sunne to be withdrawen from the face of the earth, that the inhabitants thereof might rest from their labour. Vntill the euening man Psal. 104. 23. goeth forth vnto his labour and worke. Time of darknesse is more fit for rest then worke. Let not this be so taken as if no worke were to be done, after the light of the day is taken away: (then would but little worke be done in the depth of winter, when the daies are short: and then would not God haue affor∣ded artificiall lights) but to shew that difference must be made betwixt the day and night: and that the night is affor∣ded for that time wherein men are most to rest. The other time of rest (being the Sabbath day) is by di∣uine Seruants must rest on the Lords day. Gen. 2. 3. institution. It was sanctified vnto man in the time of Adams innocency, when he stood as a publike head and stocke of all mankinde. The very name Sabbath, (which in Hebrew signifieth rest) and the expresse prohibition of doing any worke on that day, doe shew that it is a day of rest: and that one end thereof was for seruants to rest therein, is euident by the reason thereof, that thy seruant may rest. So as there is a double bond to tie masters to afford rest to their seruants on the Lords day: 1. The bond of piety to God. 2. The bond of charity to seruants: for in that God did thinke it meet for seruants to rest one day in seuen, we ought to Masters who afford not time enough of sleepe to seruants of∣fend. thinke that it is needfull and behouefull for them. §. 29. Of denying seasonable rest to seruants. Contrary to both the forenamed times of rest doe many masters offend: as first, they who make their seruants watch
too long at night, and againe, rise too soone in the morning, not affording so much time of rest and sleepe as is needfull for refreshing their bodies, and repairing their strength: whereby it commeth to passe that (beside the wrong done to their poore seruants) their worke cannot be done so well. Obiect. It is said of the forenamed good houswife, that her Pro. 31. 18. candle is not put out by night. Answ. That is a tropicall speech: and some-what hyperboli∣call. The word night is put for a part thereof. The phrase on∣ly implieth vigilancy, shewing that she is not, as many, in the euening betimes in bed, and in the morning late vp; but late downe and early vp. This phrase (she riseth while it is yet night) Vers. 15. vsed before, sheweth that that which I haue noted, is the true sense. If not putting out her candle by night, should imply a sit∣ting vp all night long, how could it be said that she riseth vp? Quest. What time may be thought sufficient to afford sleepe How long time for sleepe to be allowed. vnto seruants? Answ. As the same quantity of food is not ouer-strictly to be proportioned to all alike, so nor the same continuance of sleepe. Yet by experience it hath beene obserued that for sound and healthy bodies, fiue houres is the least time that may be allowed, and seuen houres is time sufficient for any. §. 30. Of masters offence in keeping seruants from the rest of the Lords day. 2. Against the rest of the Lords day, doe too too many ma∣sters offend: as 1. By keeping seruants at their ordinary worke on that day. 2. By sending them vp and downe on that day on many er∣rands, as to gather vp debts, or to doe such other seruices as they are loth to afford time for on other daies. 3. By making that the greatest day of paines and labour, namely to such as are in the kitchin, or haue any other businesse about feasts: for the Lords day is by many ordinarily made a day of feasting. 4 By keeping them vp too late on Saturday nights: euen till one of the clocke. Many that make some conscience of the Lords day vse to offend herein: for that their seruants might
not worke on that day, they keepe them vp till the very mo∣ment that they thinke the Sabbath beginneth: but herein they commit a double fault: one in not allowing their seruants sufficient time of rest: another in making them vnfit through want of sleepe to doe the holy seruices of the Lords day. §. 31. Of allowing time of recreation to seruants. Concerning times of recreation, I may say as the Apostle doth in another case, I haue no commandement of the Lord, 1 Cor. 7. 25. namely expresse commandement to presse vpon the conscience of masters any set time for recreation: yet questionlesse it is ve∣ry meet that seruants should haue some times to refresh them∣selues this way: for recreation rightly vsed is a great meanes to put life, and adde spirit, to youth especially. With worke and businesse not only mens bodies, but their mindes also are occupied and imployed: herein the labour and trauell of men differeth from the labour of beasts: for refreshing therefore both of body and minde is good and moderate recreation needfull. But I referre this point to the wise consideration of masters themselues, who may better by their owne obseruati∣on discerne what in this kinde is fittest, then we prescribe. §. 32. Of masters care ouer their seruants in sicknesse, and af∣ter death. Masters prouident care for the good of their seruants is not to be restrained to the time of their health, but to the time of their sicknesse also, if it please God to visit them while they are in seruice. Wherefore all things needfull are in this case to be prouided for them by their master. First spirituall comfort for their soule, that so they may the better beare their infirmity: then such things as may for the present giue them ease and re∣freshing, and also, if it please God to adde his blessing, worke a recouery. The care of the Centurion for his sicke seruant is Matt. 8. 6. in Scripture commended: he did as much for his seruant as he could haue done for his sonne: The King of Arams care also 2 King. 5. 6. was in this kinde commendable: he did not forbeare to write to his enemie, and to make himselfe beholding to him, in the behalfe of his seruant that was leprous. If the seruant haue beene formerly a faithfull, diligent, and Reasons. 1. Recom∣pence. profitable seruant, recompence requireth as much. For it is
a most vnkinde, and inhumane part to denie that seruant suc∣cour in sicknesse, who in health hath beene profitable to his master. But if a master be carefull of his sicke seruant, affording vnto 2. Future be¦nefit. him the best meanes he can for his ease, and recouery, and that seruant, through Gods blessing vpon the meanes, recouer, he will, if he haue any sparke of goodnesse in him, hold himselfe so obliged to his master, as he shall neuer be able to make suf∣ficient recompence: and thereupon be moued to vse all the di∣ligence he can for his masters good: so that a master may reapebenefit to himselfe by this kinde of kindnesse. But though the seruant that is sicke haue in former time 3. Charity. beene vnprofitable, and there be little hope of future benefit by him, yet for charity sake, and in subiection to Gods dispo∣sing prouidence, whereby that seruant is fallen sicke in his ma∣sters house, must he in that case be well looked vnto. If the Sa∣maritan Luke 10. 33, 34. did well in taking care of a meere stranger out of his house, because he saw him succourlesse, surely that master which neglecteth his seruant that is sicke in his house, doth very ill. 1. Quest. What if he be not a couenanted seruant for a set time, but a Iourney-man at will, or one that worketh by the day or weeke? Answ. Though a master be not so much bound to such an one, yet if he fall sicke in his house, he may not in that case thrust him out of doores, vnlesse he know where he may be wel prouided for. 2. Quest. What if a master be poore, and not able to pro∣uide that which is requisite for a sicke person? Answ. If the sicke person haue friends and kindred that are better able, they must prouide for him: if not, the Church must helpe: but it is the masters duty, to make the sicke mans case knowne to his friends, or to the Church. If, after all good meanes are vsed for recouery, the seruant Seruants that die, to be de∣cently buried. die, his master must see the last duty in some seemely manner, performed for him, which is Christian buriall. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt the vsage of mens bodies which af∣ter death shall be raised againe, and beasts that vtterly perish.
Iaakobs care of burying his mothers nurse is expresly mentio∣ned, Gen. 35. 8. in way of commendation. §. 33. Of neglect of seruants in sicknesse: and when they are dead. Many masters much offend in the contrary to the forena∣med duties. For 1. Some, when they obserue their seruants begin to be sicke, will put them out of their houses, and leaue them to shift for themselues, as that cruell Amalekite who left his sicke ser∣uant 1 Sam 30. 13. abroad in the fields. But note the vengeance of God which followed thereupon: The leauing of that sicke seruant in that case was the occasion of the destruction of that master and all his company. By that meanes they were discouered to their enemies. 2. Others, when they cannot remoue their sicke seruants out of their house, will suffer them there to lie succourlesse, and to perish for want of things needfull. Many rich men that are able to prouide well enough for them, will send them to some out, backe roome, and take no more care for them. In this kinde many of them shew more kindnesse to a dogge, or other beast that is not well, then to a seruant. An inhumane part. 3. Others, that seeme not so inhumane, deale too hardly with their seruants in such a case: they will afford them things needfull, but all at the poore seruants cost: and if those seruants haue not present money, they will cut it off their wages if they recouer health to doe them seruice. Is this to vndoe the heauy burdens? Or is it not to lay burden vpon Isa. 58. 6. burden? 4. Others, that are at some charges for their seruants sick∣nesse, doe so mutter at their seruants, and fling out such dis∣contented speeches (namely, that they tooke them for their worke, and not to keepe them in their bed: to get some thing by them, not to be at such cost with them: or that they make themselues more sicke then needs: they may rise, if they will, (with many other like discontented speeches) that the poore sicke seruants are more grieued and troubled with their ma∣sters discontent, then with their sicknesse: and oft moued to
striue aboue their strength to rise, euen when death is seasing vpon them, and so hasten the approach of death. 5. Many that may be carefull enough of the bodily estate of their seruants in sicknesse, See. §. 21, 22. haue no respect at all to the spi∣rituall comfort of their soules, they neither giue them a word of comfort themselues, nor send for minister or any other to doe it: but let them in this respect lie, and die as beasts. Of all points of vnmercifulnesse this is the greatest: and most vnbeseeming Christians. 6. Others, if their seruants die, will scarce afford them a winding sheet, but say, let any one that will, burie them for their clothes. Notice is to be taken of these in humane cariages, that the detestation of them may make other masters more tender hearted towards their seruants. §. 34. Of masters prouiding for the future estate of seruants. Next to the Soule, and Body of seruants, masters must haue some care of their estate: and that not only to keepe them while they are in their seruice, but also to endeuour and pro∣uide that they may liue of themselues, and doe good to others. When shall I prouide for mine owne house? saith Iaakob to his Gen. 30. 30. master. Which expostulation sheweth that this is a masters dutie. Contrary is the mind of most masters: for in entertaining seruants they thinke of nothing but seruing their owne turne. Whence it commeth to passe that when masters die many ser∣uants are put to very hard shifts. Some forced to beg, others moued to filch and steale. Thus caterpillars are nourished to annoy the common-wealth. That I may not be thought to lay the care of parents on masters, and to equall seruants with children, I will note out foure particulars which will shew what manner of care and prouidence it is that is here required of masters in regard of their seruants estate. One is, that masters accustome their seruants to paines. Another is, that they exercise them in some vsefull calling. A third is, that they giue them sufficient wages.
A fouth is, that after sufficient seruice they suffer them to prouide for themselues. §. 35. Of well imploying seruants. That charge which the master gaue to his seruants when he was going abroad (occupie till I come) sheweth that masters Luk. 19. 13. must keepe their seruants exercised and imployed about some businesse or other: which is also implied vnder this part of a good mistresses commendation, she giueth a portion to her mai∣dens, Pro. 31. 15. meaning a portion of worke. As there is neuer an idle member in a naturall body, but euery one is imploied, so should it be in a family. 1. Thus seruants being, while they are in subiection, inu∣red to paines, they will be more industrious when they are of themselues: yea they will both more willingly vndergoe, and more easily goe thorow matters which require paines and di∣ligence. Use maketh perfect. 2. Thus will masters themselues, and others afterward re∣ceiue the more profit, and greater benefit by them. 3. Thus will many temptations be auoided, and euils pre∣uented: continuall imployment to the corrupt nature of man is as a running streame which carrieth away all the mud and filth in a brooke, so as none setleth there. It is contrary hereunto to harbour idle-packes in a mans Contrary. house: to giue meat, and drinke, and lodging to such as doe no worke at all. The Apostle expresly commanded, That if 2 Thes. 3. 10. any man would not worke, neither should he eat. These are not only a prey to the deuill, but also instruments of the deuill, by which he worketh much mischiefe: for these are they that are most ready to discouer the secrets of an house, to be tatling of euery thing that is done, to sort them∣selues with all companies, and not content to doe no good themselues, disturbe, interrupt, and draw away such as are bu∣sie at their worke. §. 36. Of exercising seruants to a calling. Though it be a good thing to keepe a seruant alwaies oc∣cupied and imploied, yet for the benefit of the seruant it is fur∣ther requisite, that his imployment be about some setled mat∣ter, whereabout he may also exercise himselfe when he is out
of seruice. This especially concerneth such as haue taken Masters must teach their prentises their trade. prentises. They must teach them their trade. 1. For that end are prentises bound to masters. 2. The couenants on the masters part require as much. 3. The good which thence is like to come to the master himselfe, his prentise, and others, will recompence the paines. Other seruants also must be tied to a worke which may be a meanes of maintenance: as in a great house, to offices about that house: in the country, to husbandry: in offices about the law, to some imployment therein; and so in other callings. It is contrary hereunto for masters to enuy their prentises the mysterie of their trade: to imploy them from time to time about messages, and errands, and such things as tend only to the masters present need, but cannot be profitable for the ser∣uants in time to come. These are like old, growne, broad trees, which keepe all the sunshine from the shrubs that grow vnder them, and so keepe them downe from growing. Obiect. Prentises will be as iuy to the trees about which they cling, soone ouer-topping them, and foking all the life out of them: they will hinder their masters trading, and get away all his custome, if they be too expert in his trade. Answ. 1. This is but a meere surmise. It implieth that such masters as feare that which is pretended, deale not so cur∣rently, and faithfully with their customers as they should; or else how could they surmise that wise chapmen would leaue one of whom they haue had long and good experience, to goe to a new beginner? 2. Daily experience sheweth that God by his prouidence so ordereth mens affaires, that masters who from time to time traine vp and send forth many prentises well exercised and skilfull in their trade, doe hold on, yea and increase in their owne dealings and gaine which they get thereby; and yet withall their prentises also come well forward. Why should any masters so distrust Gods prouidence, as to be afraid to make their prentises skilfull in their trade? 3. When masters by death or otherwise giue ouer trading, how shall trades be continued, if masters be so enuious, and distrustfull? What if their masters had so dealt with them?
And what if all masters should so deale? For what one doth in such a case, he must presuppose that all may doe. In this kinde also doe such mistresses offend as keepe their maids many yeares together to drudgery worke, and neuer teach them, nor afford them meanes or leisure to learne points of huswifery, things whereby they may get better maintenance for themselues. Such masters and mistresses vse their seruants as beasts, only for their owne turne, without any respect to the seruants good: whereby they peruert the maine end of that relation betwixt ma∣ster and seruant, which is a mutuall and reciprocall good to passe from the one to the other. §. 37. Of appointing to euery seruant his particular function. For the better exercising of seruants vnto some calling, let these Directions for fitting seruants to some functi∣on. directions be noted. 1. That masters appoint to their seruants their proper and pe∣culiar worke, that they may know what to doe, and wherein to exercise themselues. And if there be many seruants in one house, to set vnto euery one their distinct function. The phrase before noted of the good mistresse (she giueth a portion to her maidens) Pro. 31. 15. proueth thus much. This was one thing which the Queene of Sheba obserued and admired in Solomons house, the standing of 1 King. 10. 5. his seruants, namely, euery one in his owne place, at his owne taske. To this purpose it is noted, that the great master gaue to Matt. 25. 15. each of his seruants their distinct talents. It is thus in the bodie naturall: euery member is not only imployed, but also imployed 1 Cor. 12. 8. &c. Quod plurimo∣rum commune est, in eo procu∣rando minima diligentia adhi∣betur. Rerum enim propria∣rum maximam curam habent, communium autem mino∣rem. Arist. de Repub. l. 2. c. 3. in his owne function: the eye in seeing, the eare in hearing, the foot in standing or going, and so the rest. It is thus also in Christs mysticall bodie: one hath the spirit of wisdome, another of know∣ledge, another of faith, and so in other gifts. Thus also ought it to be in a familie where are many seruants. This is an especiall meanes to make euery one the more dili∣gent and faithfull. For when euery one hath his particular worke, they know, that they in particular are to giue an account thereof: so as if it be not done, or ill done, they shall beare all the blame: if done, and well done, they shall haue all the praise. 2. Thus shall euery one be made skilfull and expert in some
thing, by continuall attending vpon it, and exercising themselues therein. §. 38. Of disorder in families through masters negligence. The great disorder which is in many families is contrary here∣unto: for there are many masters that hauing sundry seruants doe looke that all things should be well done, and yet appoint no par∣ticular place or worke to any one; but thinke and say, that euery one should be forward to doe euery thing; and when they finde Praeter alias causas eosunt in rebus com∣munibus negli∣gentiores, quod eus alijs curae esse existiment: quemadmodum euenire solet in ministerijs ser∣vilibus. Arist. loc. citat. not things done to their minde, they fret and fume, and com∣plaine that they keepe so many seruants, and yet nothing well done. Such seruants are not free from all blame: but surely the masters haue greatest cause to complaine of themselues, and of their owne disorder in gouerning. For their negligence in ap∣pointing no set worke to their seruants, is the cause that all is neg∣lected. For where many things to be done are left to many ser∣uants, one will put off this, and another that, and say it belongeth not to them. Thus is it verified, that what is spoken to all is spoken to none: and that generall charges, are no charges. §. 39. Of masters ouerseeing the wayes of their seruants. The second direction is, that masters vse inspection ouer their seruants, and haue an eye vpon their seruants, to see how they spend their time, and dispatch the businesse committed to them. The good mistresse looketh well to the wayes of her houshold. This Pro. 31. 27. Ruth 2. 4. is noted of Booz, that he went to his field to see what his rea∣pers did. The eye of a master is a great motiue to make a seruant diligent and faithfull: for thus he knoweth that both his diligence, and also his negligence shall be seene, and accordingly dealt withall. Hence arose that prouerbe, The eye of the master maketh the horse Oculus Domini pascit equum. Matt. 24. 48. fat. The conceit which the euill seruant had that his master de∣layed his comming, and so could not see what he did, made him so vnfaithfull as he was. If a masters place will beare it, it is behouefull that he be pre∣sent with his seruants, and as a good president goe before them. It is recorded of the good mistresse, that shee riseth and giueth a Pro. 31. 13, 15. portion to her maids: shee is with them her selfe; shee worketh willingly with her hands. This note of difference is put betwixt a prouident thriuing master, and a dissolute carelesse master: This
man saith to his seruants, goe yee: but that man saith, goe we; or thus, goe sirs, and ga'w sirs. It is contrary hereunto to let all goe (as we speake) at six and Contrary, carelesnesse. seuens; and neuer to see what seruants doe. How can such expect that their seruants should be diligent in doing that which tendeth to their masters good, when they themselues are negligent in ouerseeing that which tendeth to their owne good? Such masters as giue themselues to gaming, and following their pastimes all day long, doe much offend herein. So also such mistresses as spend all the morning in lying a bed and dressing themselues (a custome cleane contrary to that which is noted of the good mi∣stresse) Prou. 31. 15. and at noone when they come out of their chamber, chide and brawle, because things are not more forward. §. 40. Of prouoking seruants to their dutie both by faire and foule meanes. The third direction is, that masters vse what meanes they can to prouoke and stirre vp their seruants to be diligent and faithfull: as in the first place, exhortation, admonition, perswasion, promi∣ses of reward, with other like faire meanes. Such were the meanes which Saul vsed to make his seruants faithfull vnto him, when he said, Will the sonne of Iesse giue euery one of you fields, and vine∣yards, 1 Sam. 22. 7. &c. had the thing which he expected from them beene good, this manner of dealing with them had beene commenda∣ble. But if faire meanes preuaile not, then they may and ought to See §. 13. rebuke, threaten, and correct their seruants. And if seruants be impudent in sinning, and neither faire nor foule meanes will reclaime them, they must then be thrust out of doores. Note what the master in the parable said to his seruant, Thou maist be no longer steward: to which purpose Dauid also Luke 16. 2. Psal. 101. 7. said, He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within mine house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. When Ismael grew a scoffer at Gods word, Abraham thrust Gen. 21. 9. &c. him and his mother out of doores, and that by Gods appoint∣ment. The parable of cutting downe the fruitlesse figtree may fit∣ly be applied to this point: and the reason also there rendred (why combereth it the ground?) Why should incorrigible ser∣uants Luke 13. 7. &c. take vp the roome of good seruants? yea why should they remaine to insect and peruert other seruants?
Obiect. This is so farre from helping seruants in their estate, as it may proue their vtter vndoing. Answ. 1. They haue then none iustly to blame but them∣selues, Iustice (in case of necessitie) must haue her course, though through the iniquitie of man some mischiefe follow thereupon. 2. The execution of this on some, may make others better looke to themselues. 3. It may make them that are thrust out to be the more du∣tifull vnder another master, or more diligent in another course of life. Contrary is their course who obserue no course, or order A seruant is not for euery offence to be thrust out of doores. in drawing on their seruants to doe their dutie, but begin with that which should be last: nay only vse that remedy which should not be vsed, vnlesse no remedy will serue the turne, which is to turne their seruants out of doores for euery small occasion. No instruction, perswasion, admonition, rebuke, threatning is vsed by many when their seruants haue offended, but this thunderbolt cast at them, be gone, get you out of doores. If this were taken notice of as a fault, longer might seruants tarry in an house then ordinarily they doe: and more good might master and seruant reape one from another: yea and the secrets of an house be better kept; for the oft chopping and changing of seruants is it that maketh all things done priuat∣ly in houses to be blazed vp and downe. §. 41. Of paying seruants their wages. A third thing required of masters in respect of the estate of their seruants, is to giue them their iust wages: euen this is in∣cluded vnder that generall precept, Rom. 13. 7. render to all their dues: and more particularly expressed in the example of Matt. 20. 8. that ma∣ster who hired labourers into his vineyard and at the end of their worke gaue them euery one their wages: yea there is an expresse Deut. 24. 15. law to this purpose. Obiect. These places concerne labourers hired by the day. Answ. Seruants are in the same ranke: and the ground for both is the same: for both worke for wages. Yea the argu∣ment will more strongly follow from the lesse to the greater thus, If a labourer and seruant for a day must haue his wages
iustly paid, much rather a seruant, and labourer for a yeere and yeeres. 1. A masters couenant requireth as much: if there were no other bond, yet that bond whereby he voluntarily bindeth himselfe, tyeth him in conscienc thereto. Among the fruits of the Spirit Gal. 5. 22. S. Paul reckoneth Faith, meaning thereby fideli∣tie in keeping promise and couenant. 2. Common equitie and iustice requireth as much: for wa∣ges is as due for labour, as money for wares. Christ taketh it for an vndeniable principle, that Luke 10. 7. the labourer is worthy of his hire: so also doth 1 Tim. 5. 18. the Apostle. This dutie is to be performed to such as are hired for wages: of them that are found all things by their master, I spake §. 23, 25. before. In giuing seruants their wages these three things are to be Direction for giuing wages. obserued. 1. That there be a sufficient competency of wages allowed: euen so much at least as may serue to prouide such necessaries as are fit for a seruant: for there is great reason, that he that worketh should liue of his worke. 2. That it be giuen in due season. Leu. 19. 13. Deut. 24. 15. God would not haue the labourers hire be vnpaid one night after it was due. The time couenanted by a seruant for his wages, is the seasonable time: then he expecteth it: to that time he putteth his occasi∣ons of vsing it: at that time therefore it ought to be giuen him. 3. That it be paid to the full, according to the couenant: the masters promise, and the seruants need require as much. §. 42. Of masters iniustice about their seruants wages. Iniustice contrary to the forenamed dutie of due paying their seruants wages is many waies committed. 1. When masters doe altogether detaine their seruants wa∣ges: Deut. 24. 15. Jam. 5. 4. this is a crying sinne, which entreth into the eares of God. 2. When they make their seruants aske for their wages a∣gaine and againe, euen till they be ashamed: yea to stay and wait for it till they be forced to sigh vnto God: or else to filch and steale to supply their necessities: though these masters
haue not a purpose vtterly to defraud their seruants of their due, yet the putting them off, and delaying to pay it, putteth seruants, that for the most part haue but from hand to mouth, vnto great straits: which the Lord well knew: and therefore Leu. 19. 13. Deut. 24. 15. expresly forbad the detaining of a seruants hire one night. This therefore is a point not only of vnkindnesse, but also of iniustice. 3. When masters alter and change the couenanted wages, and seeke to diminish it, as Gen. 31. 41. hard-hearted Laban did: they shew thereby that they repine at their seruants welfare, and seeke only themselues. §. 43. Of suffering seruants to prouide for themselues. A fourth thing required of masters in regard of their ser∣uants estate is, that after sufficient seruice done they suffer their seruants to prouide for themselues. This Iaakob required of Laban as a most equall and reasonable matter, saying, Gen. 30. 30. when shall I prouide for mine owne house also? (as was §. 34. before noted in the generall.) This hath respect especially vnto such seruants as haue beene a long time with masters as apprentises, and spent their time, labour, and paines only and wholly for their masters good. Exod. 21. 2. Deut. 15. 12. Gods law tooke expresse order for such, that after certaine yeeres seruice they should goe free. So doe also the lawes of our land, especially the orders of London. Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt seruants (who are vnder subiection, and held to worke for their owne good) and beasts (which are only for mans seruice, and good.) They therefore who are of a contrary minde, keeping ser∣uants Contrary. as long as possibly they can, euen all their life long vnto hard labour, and vnder seruitude, deserue to be serued with beasts rather then men and women. This kinde of masters ri∣gour to their seruants is in particular noted to be Ier. 34. 16, 17. one of the causes of that great indignation of God against the Iewes, whereby he was prouoked to giue them ouer, as captiues to their enemies. §. 44. Of kindnesse to be shewed to good seruants. As masters must giue that which is iust to all seruants, so that which is §. 20. equall to them that deserue it: that is, they must be of an answerable minde and disposition to good, honest,
louing, kinde, faithfull seruants, who stand not so much vpon that which is exacted, as vpon that which they are able to doe for their masters, and in that respect, as they see occasion doe oft times much more then is exacted, or expected. Goodnesse requireth goodnesse; good will, good will; and this is to doe the same things. This kinde of Equitie consisteth in these and such like particulars. 1. Masters must well esteeme of such good seruants: and haue them in high account. Gen. 15. 2, 3. Abram accounted his old good faithfull seruant as his childe, and till he had a childe thought of making him his heire. Great was that esteeme which Poti∣phar Qui vere pa∣tresfamilias sunt, seruis in familia sua tan∣quam filijs con∣sulunt. Aug. de Ciu. Dei, l. 19. c. 16. had of Ioseph, when of a bondslaue he made him ouerseer ouer his house, Gen. 39. 4. Why is the title Father giuen to ma∣sters, (2. King. 5. 13.) and the title Sonnes to seruants, (Ios. 7. 19. & 1 Sam. 24. 16.) but to shew that seruants should beare a child-like affection to their masters, and that masters should beare a fatherlike affection to such seruants? 2. Masters must take notice of the goodnesse, and kind∣nesse of such seruants: and manifest as much, both by giuing them due praise, and a good reward: both which are noted in the patterne of that great master who said, well done thou good Matth. 25. 21. and faithfull seruant, thou hast beene faithfull ouer a few things, I will make thee ruler ouer many things. Thus will those good seruants be the more encouraged to hold on, and others will be moued to imitate them. This incouragement doth the Apostle giue to all vnder authoritie, doe that which is good, and Rom. 13. 3. thou shalt haue praise of the same. Which phrase implieth that gouernours ought to praise those that doe well. 3. If such seruants be accused of any hainous crime, ma∣sters must not rashly giue credit thereto, but rather thorowly sift, and examine the matter. Herein Potiphar exceedingly Gen. 39. 19. failed, and by that meanes lost such a seruant as he could neuer get againe. If a good seruant doe by occasion slip, and com∣mit a fault, his master ought in wisdome either to take no no∣tice of it: or with some milde admonition passe it ouer: and not deale with him as with a lewd, gracelesse seruant. 4. When such seruants (their couenanted time being ex∣pired) depart, their masters must not let them goe away empty: Deut. 15. 13.
but helpe them in their mariage (as Moses his master did) or Exod. 2. 21. in their setting vp, as the great master, who made his wise and faithfull seruant ruler ouer all his goods. Matth. 24. 47. §. 45. Of vnkinde dealing with good seruants. Vnworthy they are of good and kinde seruants who are of a contrary minde: as many masters are For 1. Some make no difference betwixt seruants: but esteeme of bad and good all alike: they thinke that the best seruants doe but their duty, therefore no extraordinary respect is to be borne towards them. But it is a point of wisdome sometimes to account a duty as a kindnesse: especially when good will of heart is ioyned with outward performance of duty. 2. Others thinke it policy to take no notice of any seruants extraordinary faithfulnesse and diligence to praise and reward the same, lest it puffe them vp too much. But there is much more feare of seruants fainting, and waxing weary of doing good if they haue no incouragement, then of growing insolent by incouragement. 3. Others will be more ready to checke and rebuke such for euery slip, and for failing in any thing, then others: because others lesse regard their rebuke: whereby they shew want of wisdome in well managing their authority. 4. Others when their seruants are about to goe away, or to marry, or to set vp, will seeke some occasion or other to fall out with them, of purpose to send them away empty. Many will carry a faire face toward profitable seruants till the time of recompence commeth, and then beginne to frowne, as Laban Gen. 31. 2. did. Yea so farre are some masters from seeking the prosperity of faithfull, wise, diligent, skilfull seruants, as they will hinder Sic cum infe∣riore viuas, quemadmodum tecum superio∣rem velles vi∣uere. Senec. epist. 47. them in what they can, and keepe them downe: fearing lest as their seruants rise, they themselues should decay and fall. These are both vnkinde, and vngratefull masters. Would masters be so dealt with by their superiours? Thou oughtest so to liue with thy inferiour, as thou wouldest haue thy superiour liue with thee. Hitherto of masters duties. The reasons to moue them to per∣forme their duties follow.
§. 46. Of the subiection vnder which masters are. Ephes. 6. 9. Knowing that your master also is in heauen: neither is there respect of persons with him. There is in generall but one reason alledged by the Apostle, to prouoke masters to doe their duties, but it is so laid downe as it compriseth other forcible reasons vnder it. The principall reason is taken from the subiection wherein masters are. The other reasons are taken from the description of that authority vnder which masters are: for it is such an autho∣rity, as, 1. In relation to it there is no difference betwixt master and seruant. 2. It is farre surpassing all dignities on earth. 3. It is moued with no outward respect of any thing. The first reason which declareth the subiection of masters, in that they haue a master ouer them, putteth them in minde of that account which they are to make, and reckoning which they are to giue of the well vsing of their authority, and of their cariage towards such as are vnder them. For they are but as stewards ouer fellow seruants: euery one of them therefore shall heare this charge, giue an account of thy stewardship. Luke 16. 2. In this respect this reason is both as a spur, and as a curbe vn∣to masters. As a spur, to pricke them on forward conscionably to per∣forme all those duties which are required of them: for they haue a master that will take notice thereof, and reward them for it. As they approue, and recompence the good seruice which their seruants doe: so much more will their master ap∣proue and recompence them if they doe well. Doe masters therefore looke that their seruants should performe their duty? let them then performe theirs: for there is the same reason of both. Let this be applied to all the particular duties before mentioned. It is also as a curbe, to restraine masters from doing any thing
to their seruants but what they can be able to iustifie vnto their owne master. With this curbe did God hold in the Israelites, saying, Leu. 25. 43. Thou shalt not rule ouer thy seruant with rigor, but shalt feare thy God. Ioseph was held in with it, when he said, Gen. 42. 18. This doe and liue, for I feare God. And Nehemiah, when he said, Neh. 5. 15. The former Gouernours were chargeable to the people, but so did not I because of the feare of God. And Iob, when he said, Iob 31. 13, 14. If I did de∣spise the cause of my seruant, when God visiteth, what shall I an∣swer him? Thinke of this ô masters, when you are about to ex∣act any thing of your seruants that is not lawfull or meet, when you are incensed and in passion stirred vp to strike your ser∣uants vniustly or cruelly, when you detaine from them any thing that is their due, when you lay more on them then they are able to beare, when any way you wrong or oppresse them: thinke and say with your selues, can this be iustified? how shall we be able to hold vp our head to our master when he calleth vs to account? What stronger motiue to doe all dutie? what stronger restraint from all iniustice and rigour? The conceit which ma∣ny haue that they are free, vnder none, to giue no account, ma∣keth them both negligent of their owne dutie, and insolent ouer others; as Pharaoh, who said, Exod. 5. 2. Who is the Lord that I should obey him? and Sennacherib, who said, 2 Chr. 32. 15. Shall your God de∣liuer you out of mine hands? and Nebuchadnezzar, who said, Dan. 3. 15. Who is that God that shall deliuer you out of mine hands? Note the issue of this insolency. Pharaoh after many extraordinarie plagues laid on him and his people, Exod. 14. 28. was drowned in the red sea with all his host. Isa. 37. 36, 38. Sennacherib after his host was destroied, was slaine by his owne sonnes. Dan. 4. 30. Nebuchadnezzar became a very bruit. But to let these abominable blasphemers passe, there be many masters who, though they vtter not with their mouthes such execrable blasphemies, yet by their carriage to∣wards their seruants shew themselues to be little better min∣ded, in that they make their owne will a rule to their seruants, and will haue them doe such things as are vnmeet and vnlaw∣full, vsing their seruants as slaues, or rather as beasts. Let all such masters know that they haue a master.
§. 47. Of the equality betwixt masters and seruants in relation to God. The second reason in this particle also (your master also) declareth an equality betwixt masters and seruants in relation to God. As God is the masters of seruants, so he is the master of masters also. As seruants are the Lords 1 Cor. 7. 22. freemen, so masters are the Lords seruants. In this respect they who are made ru∣lers, and they who are vnder them, are called Matt. 24. 49. ominus fide∣lem habens ser∣uum di'igat vt frarem propter fidei societatem salua sibi serui∣tute. Constit. Apost. l. 4. c. 12. Dominum pa∣trem familiae appellauerunt, seruos familia∣res. Seec. Epist. 47. fellow seruants. For howsoeuer in outward dignity there is great difference betwixt master and seruant, yet as the seruants of God they are of a like condition, and in many things may be accounted equall: especially if both be of the same faith, and so brethren in Christ. This is another spur and curbe too. A spur in that God will the more kindly accept that good∣nesse which masters doe to their seruants, because it is done to Gods seruants. A curbe, in that seruants shall be heard before God as well as masters, for he is the master of both. Many thinke that all the kindnesse which is shewed to ser∣uants is lost, because they are so meane as they are able to make no recompence. But their master is able. Others thinke, their seruants can neuer take any reuenge of them, and thereupon vse them as they list. But the master of seruants, who is also the master of masters, can take vengeance, euen such as shall make masters sorely repent all the wrong they haue done. If masters did duely weigh this point, that, howsoeuer in re∣gard of outward gouernment there be some difference betwixt them and their seruants, yet before God they are as fellow ser∣uants, would they be ouer-rigorous and cruell? would they not be kinde and gentle? §. 48. Of Gods being in heauen, how it is a motiue to prouoke ma∣sters well to respect their seruants. The third reason (taken from the place of God, in heauen) declareth the surpassing excellencie of that great master, who is the common master of masters and of seruants: and it addeth an edge to the former motiues.
1. It sheweth that though the wrong which masters doe to their seruants be within the walls of their house, so as no mortall eye can see it, yet God who is in heauen seeth it: and though ser∣uants cannot be admitted into the courts of men to make their complaint, yet heauen is open to them; to that great master that is in heauen they may haue accesse when they will. That which made the euill steward deale hardly with his fellowes, was the con∣ceit Mat. 24. 48. which he had of his masters absence. But no such conceit can they haue of this great master, who know that he is in heauen, and Pro. 15. 3. that as heauen is ouer euery place, so the eyes of the Lord are in euery place, and behold the euill and good: he seeth all the good, and all the euill that masters doe to their seruants. 2. It sheweth that the kindnesse which the Lord will repay, and the vengeance which he will inflict, is infinitely greater then the good or euill that masters can doe to their seruants, euen as heauen i, higher then earth, and as he that is in heauen is greater then they that are on earth. Doest thou therefore, who art a master on earth, reioyce, or grieue the soule of thy seruant? God in heauen can much more make glad or sad thy soule. Doest thou therefore de∣sire the fauour, or feare the frownes of thy master in heauen? shew fauour to thy seruant on earth, and forbeare threatning. Remem∣ber the infinite disparitie betwixt thy mastership and Gods, and this will the more moue thee to deale with thy seruant, as thou wouldest haue God deale with thee. 3. It sheweth that there is much more reason we should take notice of our seruants, of their paines, of their diligence, and of their faithfulnesse, then that God should take notice of ours: and lesse reason that we should scorne, or neglect our seruants, then God scorne or neglect vs. For there is far greater difference be∣twixt God and vs, then betwixt vs and our seruants. We and our Vis tu cogitare istum quem ser∣uum  vo∣cas, exijsdem se∣minibus ortum, eodem fruicoelo, aequè spirare, aequè viuere, aequè mori. Senec. Epist. 47. seruants are all of the earth, of the same mould, nature, and dispo∣sition, subiect to the same passion, and to the same dissolution. (The heathen obserued as much.) But God is in heauen, eternall, vnchangeable, euery way surpassing glorious. How can we then looke to be respected of this master, if we respect not our ser∣uants? O masters, in all your dealings with your seruants, re∣member your master is in heauen.
§. 49. Of Gods impartiall respect of all. The fourth reason (in these words, neither is there respect of persons with him) declareth Gods iust and equall manner of proceeding with all men, of what ranke and degree soeuer. God will doe the same things to all sorts of masters that they doe to their seruants. To the consideration of this impartiall iustice of God doth the Apostle call masters, both because of that outward power which they haue ouer their seruants, and also because for the most part masters are backt with the power and authority of magistrates on earth, who in matters of dif∣ference betwixt master and seruant are ordinarily partiall, re∣specting masters more then seruants. But let masters here learne to cast off all such fond conceits, and foolish hopes. Though they be higher in place, haue more wealth, and better friends then their seruants, and though men who haue carnall eies may thereby be much mo∣ued to respect them, yet will not God goe an haires bredth from iustice for the whole world. If the greatest man that euer was in the world should haue a seruant that were the meanest that euer was, and a case betwixt that master and that seruant should come before God, God would not any whit at all leane to that master more then to the seruant. If the grea∣test that be abuse the meanest, they shall not escape. Wherfore, O masters, giue no iust cause of complaint to any seruant. The Apostles manner of setting downe these points, noted in this word (knowing) implieth that ignorance of God, of that authority which he hath ouer masters, of that equality which in relation to God is betwixt masters and seruants, and of Gods heauenly excellency, and impartiall respect towards all, maketh masters to abuse their power, by neglecting all dutie, and insulting & tyrannizing ouer their seruants: where∣fore you that haue heretofore beene ignorant of these points, now take knowledge of them; and you that know them, oft call them to minde: and doe that which becommeth good masters, Knowing that your master also is in hea∣uen, neither is there respect of per∣sons with him.
