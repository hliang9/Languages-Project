THE DUTCH Way of Toleration Most proper for our ENGLISH DISSENTER Written at the Request of a Friend. O! Imitatores servum pecus. Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea Nodo? Hor. As free, and not using your Liberty for a Cloak of Malici∣ousness, &c. St. Pet. Ep. 1. Ch. 2. V. 16. LONDON, Printed for the Author
THE DUTCH Way of Toleration, Most proper for our ENGLISH DISSENTERS. SIR, THis returns my Thanks, for the Favour of your last, and candid Acknowledgment, that I had reason in affirming, the Sword would continue to halt it on be∣tween St. Paul's and Pinner's-Hall, as long as this was Mayor; for now you were come over to my Opinion, and saw it would not only be so, but that his Successor, finding the Ice thus broken, would, probably, follow in the same Track, or otherwise improve the Affront to our old Establishments, ac∣cording as the several Factions, which plac'd him in the Chair, should think fit to direct: Hereupon you desire me to communicate what I know in reference to the Dutch Toleration, (whereof you have heard several hints in our private Converse) and how it comes to pass, that the many differing Perswasions amongst them enjoy their Liberty with a continued Peace and Quiet, whereas ours are always restless and encroaching, every day grasping at more, and seem still dissatisfied unless they can engross all. Indeed, Sir, it was to my no little surprize, when last in Town, to find your self, and some other Friends, so positive, that a Re∣primand from the Court of Aldermen, and some by-Reflections in an Higher Court, would stifle their Delign, or make them give it over, which I perceived was deeper laid, and had greater Encouragements, than any of you did then imagine; yet sure this you must
v'd, that 'tis very rare to find those Parties doing their business by halves; whatever Lights they may pretend to, there is an infal∣lible Argument to prove them Children of this World, being so wise, that is, cunning, in their Generations. No People carry on their Projects with greater Intrigue, nor more nicely observe the several steps and degrees by which they must be accomplished: Their Legal Indulgence, as it was a great Point gain'd, so the timing of it was very critical; for, being in the heat of the Revolution, there might be several Casus omissi, which upon farther Debate would have been better considered; particularly, I question very much, whe∣ther any Dissenter would have been allow'd going to the Conven∣ticle during his Magistracy, especially to carry the Insignia thither; the former of which hath been all along practis'd in several Corpo∣rations throughout the Kingdom; and, doubtless, the President your Lord Mayor has set, will be Ap'd by several of his Brethren in other Places: (notwithstanding, as the Act runs at present, 'tis a Moot Case among the Gentlemen of the Long Robe, whether al∣lowable thereby) But that your Lord Mayor may not have the sole Honour of the first Attempt, at least, that was done the First Year of their Indulgence, at a Corporation in my Neighbourhood, where an old Zealot of the 41 Cause (brought in perhaps for that purpose) would needs have the Mace attend him to the Barn; but the honesty, or as they term'd it, obstinacy of the Officers, the Serjeants, would not comply, and so he went without it. After∣wards, Indeed, when one of the same Stamp was in course to be chosen, the Company capitulated, that however the Mayor might take his liberty, the Mace should be confin'd to Church; which some thought a little hard on the Mace's side, since 'twas believ'd every whit as tender-conscienc'd as the Man who follow'd it. But, to return to our purpose, you see how their Affairs stand at present, and how little they scruple stretching to the utmost any Liberty which is indulg'd them, whereof now they have a fair Prospect to make a greater enlargement; for you know next Win∣ter a New Parliament will come in course; and they are so far from being ignorant thereof, or idle thereupon, as 'tis hard for a Person of your undesigning Integrity, to imagine how earnestly they already stickle to carry on their Point in that Critical Juncture, leave never a Stone unturn'd, are tampering with all Interests, and in all Places, to get confiding Members chosen, such Root and Branch-men, as shall effectually carry on the Work of the Lord, and once more esta∣blish the Good Old Cause; and then let the State look to it as well as the Church, for 'tis hard to resolve whether suffer'd most from
such thorough Reformers. Now his to me is Demonstration, that a Religious Liberty, a Freedom as to  Consciences, is not the sole, nor main thing they aim at; for then would they press no farther, that being confirm'd to them by Legal Establishment, to all Intents and Purposes imaginable; But to be dabbling in the Government, is as natural to them as Water to a Fish; and if they may not com∣mand the Royalty, and controll at Pleasure, prescribe who are worthy Men, and Men worthy, those Waters will be always troubled, ne∣ver free from foul Weather, and Storms: Nay, farther to remark, how scandalously they prostitute their Spiritual Liberty, their Right of Conscience, to obtrude themselves upon the Temporal Power, their double dealing, playing fast and loose with our Church and Sacrament, is an irrefragable Argument. Formerly, the Church of England (to use their great Patriarch's J. O's Words) was a meer Antichristian Encroachment upon the Inheritance of Christ, all her Darling-Errors, Stones of the Old Babel; and therefore by no means to be communicated with: The Faithful of the Lord must not touch such defiled Garments; and this indeed was the common Cant of them all, for some score of Years together: Yet now we see to serve a State-turn, or rather overturn the State, the Holy Sacrament goes down as glib with them as the Covenant of old; there is no Scruple, when the Cause is con∣cern'd: In the mean while, I dare engage, that if this next Ele∣ction, they can make a Party prevalent enough to repeal the Test, as they have already cancell'd the other Penal Laws, they will re∣turn to their Old Invectives, Our Sacrament shall be Reprobated as an Anti-christian Rite, and all Communion with our Church sinful and abominable. Now here, if they would give me leave to expostulate a little, I would desire them to consider, whether any thing can bring a greater reproach upon Religion, the Innocence, and Simplicity of the Gospel, than such vain Tergiversations as these? Such Linsy Woolsy Consciences? Such profane Halters between God and Baal? Can we imagine there should be any thing more in all these Mockeries, than a sordid Interest, spiteful Revenge, or popular Humour? To be cry'd up by the Factions, and make something of a Figure amongst the Mob-Sectaries, which they despair'd of obtaining from Men of Sense and Principles. This indeed is not exactly the Laodicean Tem∣per; but the little difference is for the worse, being so hot, where they need not be so much as lukewarm, and less than so, where they should express a religious Fervour: And since Almighty God threa∣tened to spew the former out of his Mouth, I fear his Blessings may be the less, if these others be not spew'd out of the Government.
And this, Sir, brings me to the estion you propounded (and what I presume was chiefly aim' at in the Acknowledgment you made) How it comes to  Dutch live in so much Peace and Quiet, notwithstanding the may Perswasions tolerated amongst them? Which may be clearly answered in very few Words; viz. because no such troublesome, easie People, as aforementioned, have to do in the Govern∣ment. And I have sometimes admir'd our great Sticklers for Li∣berty, and Toleration, who upon all occasions are too forward in crying up the Low-Country Model, and pretend to be of a much quicker Scent than others, never hit of this; but, upon second Thoughts considered, they generally belong to some of the Factions, and would be sure not to exclude themselves: Yet, doubtless, what, Horace observes in Poetry, is as true in Politicks, Decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile, 'tis hard coming at the same end, without the like means: To imitate their Toleration, without their Caution and Restrictions, will not only be sordid, as the Poet terms it, but in∣effectual, prove a Remedy worse than the Disease; for from thence, more especially, it proceeds, that their Toleration has turn'd to Account: In all other Places, where Ʋniversal and unlimited, it has fallen a Prey to the undermining Stratagems of that Spiritual Ʋsur∣per upon all Christian Liberty whatsoever, as will hereafter appear. For your fuller satisfaction therefore, I shall give you an Account of the Dutch Toleration; as likewise how hard it will be to bring us to that Model, and yet shew you 'tis that alone can do our bu∣siness: All other Courses will be much more unpracticable, and un∣safe, and multiply those Distractions which we design'd to prevent. And that you may give the greater Credit to what I shall say herein, it shall not depend upon my sole Authority (though it was my chief Enquiry during some Years abode there) but have the Confirma∣tion of Sir William Temple's Observations upon those Provinces; which, as I think it was the first, so 'tis, generally believed, the exactest Piece we have had from that Ingenious Gentleman; Clear Matter of Fact, without that partiality and by respect, which ma∣ny times is not avoided by such as pretend most thereunto. Now what makes it seem more difficult and unpracticable a∣mongst us, than them, is, That the Constitution of their Government, and Temper of their People, will be found better adapted thereunto, with some other Advantages of lesser Moments: All which take, as follows. First, Then the Constitution of Their Government seems better adapted thereunto: To which purpose, I must let you know, that however those Provinces are given out to be a Common-Wealth, a
Free State, with such other swelling Titles of Liberty, Priviledges, &c. as if the People had the sole Controll, the Dernier Resort, in all Pub∣lick Determinations (and so indeed it was in those little Democra∣cies of Greece, and that great one of Rome, where no Laws could be enacted, nor Magistrates chosen, &c. but by their Consent) up∣on Enquiry it will appear quite otherwise; the Populace, the Burghers, have no more to do in the Government, than you and I, if we dwelt, or but sojourn'd amongst them: 'Tis the exactest Oli∣garchy that is this day, or perhaps ever was in the World, where the Magistrates of every City, or Province, are as absolute as any Prince in Christendom: Enact Laws, levy Taxes, chuse one another into the several Offices of Government, and upon a Vacancy (which seldom happens, but by death) elect another to fill up their number, without any controll, but from their Stadtholder, who hath a nega∣tive Voice, or somewhat like it in all their Elections; and tho' a reasonable Check, is what their Hogan Moganships have been most uneasie under, and endeavoured more than once to free themselves from. Sir W.T. instances more particularly in the City of Amster∣dam, as chief of the Province of Holland,Obs. p. 9. and in that, as chief of the Seven Provinces; and tells you, the Government of that City is in the sole management of Thirty six Persons, whom he calls Sena∣tors; and saith, indeed, they were formerly chosen by the Voices of the Richer Burghers, or Freemen of the City; who, upon the death of a Senator, met together either in a Church, a Market, or some other Place, spacious enough to receive their Numbers, and there made an Election of the Person to succeed, by a Ma∣jority of Voices. But about One hundred and thirty, or forty, Years agoe, when the Towns of Holland began to encrease in Circuit and People, so as these frequent Assemblies grew into danger of Tumult and Disorders, upon every occasion, by reason of their Number and Contentions: This Election of Senators, came by the Resolution of the Burghers in one of their General Assem∣blies, to be devolv'd forever upon the standing Senate for that time; so that ever since when any of their Number dies, a new one is chosen by the rest of the Senate, without any interven∣tion of the other Burghers, which makes the Government a sort of Oligarchy, and very different from a popular Government, as it is generally esteemed by those, who passing, or living in these Countries, content themselves with common Observations, or Inquiries. And this Resolution of the Burghers either was agreed upon, or followed, by General Consent, or Example, about the same time, in all the Towns of the Province, tho' with some
difference in the Number of the Senators. Thus far the foremen∣tioned Gentleman; whereto I must farther add, that these Sena∣tors both here, and in all other Towns, are of the same Communion, as to the Publick Exercise of Religion; which, after some Debates, and Alterations, upon their Defection from Spain, was fix'd upon the Geneva-Model, with an Allay of Erastianism, the better to keep under the Insolency of their Presbyteries, so troublesome else∣where. 'Tis not of much moment to tell you farther, that as these Senators marry generally into one anothers Families, so they keep the Government, for the most part, amongst themselves, the Chil∣dren, with other Relations, coming in, and gradually ascending, if capable of it; which nevertheless being faithfully discharg'd, with∣out Partiality, Avarice, or any other such by-respects, the People seem no ways dissatisfied therewith. This, Sir, is a small Scratch of the Present Establishment of that People, which I shall farther confirm to you, upon the Authority of the present Bishop of Sarum; who, speaking of the Low-Coun∣tries, how they got their Liberty, and how they maintain'd it,Peace and union, p. 9. adds, yet after all this, tho' the Name of their Government has a greater sound towards Liberty than our own, we are really the much freer Peo∣ple of the two, where every Man has a more open access to a proportion'd Share in the Government, than among them. The high-flown Demagogues of our Nation, I know, will censure this as a great defect, a giving up their Rights, a betraying their Priviledges, with a great deal such like Commonwealth-Cant, as has betray'd us into confusion more than once; whereas doubtless those thoughtful People made a sober Judgment of Things, and well understood such Priviledges not worth keeping, as tended only to the distraction of their Debates, and might, in the end, destroy their Government: To be sure the General Toleration, which fol∣lowed soon after, could have stood upon no other Bottom; and those at the Helm were so well satisfy'd with this New Constitution, as to set the Sovereingty of all the Seven Provinces upon the same Foot: For so the Assembly of the States General,Sir W. T. p. 110. which consisted of a∣bove Eight hundred Persons, who meeting together in one Place from so many several Parts, gave too great a shock to the whole Body of the Ʋnion, made their Debates long, and sometimes confused, the Resolutions slow, and upon sudden Occasions out of time, was by mutual Consent of the whole Body, devolved upon those, now stil'd the States General, which consists of so many Deputies from each Province, more or less, as they are pleased to send; which makes no difference, as to their Votes, be∣cause given according to their several Provinces, not number of
sons, altho' their number seldom arise to so many as the at Amsterdam consists of. Now, Sir, to come to the disparity, in reference to our selves, none of this is done, or must be thought off amongst us, as to the whole Body of the Government; which, though a Free Monarchy, is so, well temper'd, as we see every Subject own'd to have more Liber∣ty, than under a Free State: 'Tis pity it should be so much abused; yet since it is so, might there not be some Abridgment as to par∣ticular Persons, without the least Infraction upon the whole Con∣stitution, an Exchange of Temporal for a Spiritual Liberty? They that will have a New Religion, let them live according to this New Model of our Neighbours, and forbear meddling in Civil Concerns; otherwise I cannot see how the Old Establishment should be long up∣held: For whilst the Tolerated Parties are free to Vote, and put in their Claims to all Publick Administrations, all Offices of Honour, Trust, or Profit, they may carry things as they please; what tho∣rough their Industry and Importunity, Cabals and Clamours, Libels and Lies, 'tis as possible to stop a raging Sea, as the Madness of such People: No man of Sence will attempt it; for tho' they are divi∣ded amongst themselves, in Doctrines, Modes of Worship, and Forms of Government, Ephraim against Manasseh, and Manasseh against Ephraim; yet the Judah of the Church of England, is the united Ob∣ject of all their Spites, and what they study most implacably to supplant and destroy: And if we reflect how many or them, in the late Reign, comply'd with the Dispensing Power, and super∣seded all those Laws, which the Nation, for above an hundred years successively, had compil'd to secure the Protestant Religion, there needs no Window into any of their Breasts, (as a leading Holder-forth then wish'd in an Address) to discover the Reality of their Intentions. 'Tis too clear from thence, and all their other Practi∣ces, that the Church of England is the only Popery they have a Pique against; and can confederate with that which is really so, nay, Turk or Jew, to effect its Ruine. In my Judgment, therefore, It would be a very reasonable, and necessary Test, (and, I fancy, re∣duce the truly conscious Dissenters to a very small number) to try the sincerity of their Intentions, and steadiness of their Principles, by an Indulgence of that Liberty they are so zealous for, upon Con∣dition not to intermeddle in Civil Affairs, which their, weak Ʋnde∣standings, strong Prejudices, and vain Enthusiasms, render them most unqualified for: Will the Freeholder, even to the Cottager with his Cabbage-ground and Apple-Tree, recede from the Right he has of throwing up his Cap at a County-Election? The Members of smal∣ler
Burroughs, as well as larger Corporations, of putting their to an Expence upon the like account, together with being on the Livery, strutting at Common Halls, Common Councils, and the like? Nay, even in Country-Parishes, will they recede from serving as Constable in their turns, controling the Poor as Over∣seers or Parsons as Church-Wardens? So likewise the Country-Gen∣tleman; how will he take being left out of the Peace, or not ap∣pearing upon the Bench at Sessions, and Assizes, as well as his Con∣forming Neighbours? If I mistake not the Temper of the several Parties, these little things will be of hard digestion, since, they have been ever observ'd as forward to command, as uneasie to obey; yet if we would go according to the Low-Country-Plan, (to use the New Word) this course must be taken; for 'tis this, alone has se∣cur'd them, and this, or nothing, will secure us: And therefore a very learned Person, about Eighteen or Twenty Years since, who understood the Ʋnreasonableness of our several Separations extreme∣ly well, had fully studied all their Cavils, and as fully evinced them, if any thing of Eviction could work upon that sort of People: Yet,Pref. p. 85. in his Preface to that Demonstrative Piece, whether it was to let the Dissenters see, he was averse to nothing which might, tend to a Settlement, or propounded it from a Friend, whose Head hath been always pregnant with Comprehension, and Toleration-Projects: Or, perhaps, to humour some great Men at the Helm, who about that time stickled very much for a Suspension of Penal Laws; upon what Design, as every Eye then discover'd, so, I fear, in spite of all Endeavours to the contrary, that Design will be ever concern'd therein, and advanc'd thereby; I say, upon whatever Account it was, this Reverend Worthy Person, in his Preface, makes a short Essay as to a Toleration, laying down such Restrictions and Limitations, as are requisite to prevent the Mischiefs of an unlimited Licentious∣ness, which he saith would certainly bring Confusion amongst us, and in the end, Popery: Now the first of his Restrictions, is, That none be permitted this Indulgence, who do not declare, that they hold all Commu∣nion with our Church unlawful; for it seems unreasonable to allow it to o∣thers, and will give countenance to endless and causeless Separations. And give me leave to add, will gratifie the Capricio's of such wan∣ton Libertines, as live Scepticks, and dye Atheists: To which kind of Scepticism I find several, who associate with at least, and abtt the Dissenters, much inclin'd. Quere, as to your Lord Mayor. Ano∣ther Restriction is, That no Person, so indulg'd, be capable of any Pub∣lick Office; it being unreasonable, that such should be trusted with Govern∣ment, who look upon what the Government hath already establish'd as un∣lawful▪
A Third is, That all such as enjoy it, must declare the part∣cular Congregation they are of; and enter their Names before such Com∣missioners as shall be authoriz'd to that purpose. I shall mention no more, (tho' there be several others tending to the same purpose) but only appeal whether you, or any Man else of sober Sence, must not acknowledge these to be highly reasonable, and absolutely necessary; that we may know what Men are, and where to have them. In Martial-Law, none are more severely proceeded against, than such as fly from their own, or are taken as Spies in the Enemies Camp; yet we must suffer these Enemies of our Church, tho' they have been all along in the Dissenters Service, to enter our Line at pleasure, take our Word, our Test, and Sacrament, that they may be the better qualified to work our Ruine; nay, are so stupidly senceless, as not only to let them alone, but entertain and caress them as Friends: Just thus the Amalakites serv'd Israel, and we know how highly Almighty God was incensed thereat, and what the People suffer'd thereby. But not to ramble too far, or be thought too much concern'd upon the Church-Account, let us con∣sider our Government in General, whether it can be so well secur'd by such an Hodge-podge of Perswasions, who will be continually pulling several ways, and aiming at several Interests, as the Low Countries, where a few understanding Men Act unanimously for the Publick Welfare, without any by-Regards, or Factious Designs. Secondly, What I mentioned, in the next place, by way of Disparity, as likely to make a Toleration less feasable amongst us, than the Dutch, is the different Temper and Humours of the Two Nations: They are a serious, and thoughtful People, wholly intent upon their own private Concerns, and very industrious in all their particular Callings; frugal and parsimonious to the utmost; truly speaking, necessitated thereunto, by reason of the many and con∣tinual Imposts laid upon them, which no People under Heaven so contentedly bear, nor so indefatigably wade through, being abun∣dantly satisfied with the Prudence and Integrity of their Governours, and highly transported with an imaginary Conceit of Liberty, which no body can see into, or understand, but themselves: So that, as the forementioned Gentleman observes, All Appetites and Passions seem to run lower here, than in other Countries. I am sure they do not run so low in ours, which, on the contrary, is too sanguine to be settled as it ought; for, to pass by that old Charge of Rex Diabo∣lorum, the English good Nature was so strongly sowr'd by our late Times of Libertinism, and Confusion, Men contracted such a habit of Self-conceit, Opposition, and Disobedience, were so totally given
over to a perverse Enthusiastical Spirit; and for so long a time, as now indeed it may be look'd upon, next to impossible, absolutely to conjure it down; yet doubtless it ought to be confin'd to its own home, the melancholy Tombs of their restless unquiet Thoughts, and not wander up and down the World, to possess others with the Legions of such Frenzies; which, if let alone, will certainly be; for 'tis a Pestilent Infection, and without due Caution spreads like the Plague. And that this unhappy Disposition began from the Sepa∣ration-Fraternity, and is much more incident to the English, than Dutch Temper, take this single Instance: There were more Dis∣putes, Contests, and Quarrels, amongst the few Brownists, and other Independent Sectaries, which resorted thither the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's, King James the First's time, and so on, than among the whole Dutch Nation ever since they Reform'd: Tis un∣accountable what impertinent Controversies arose between them, even to the Colour of Aaron's Ephod, whether it were Blew, or a Sea-green, which made an irreconcilable difference between their Pastors, and consequently the Flocks divided. Once indeed there was a Controversie amongst the Dutch, about some School-Points (and I think that the only Instance can be given) which rose to a great height; but then you must know it was occa∣sion'd principally by two great State-Factions, wherein most Di∣vines, especially of the Geneva-cut, are too easily made Properties: In this, to be sure, they serv'd themselves to purpose; for obtain∣ing by Power, what they could not get by Argument, one Party became Judge of the other, and thrust them down amongst the several Herds of Tolerated Dissenters. And here give me leave to observe a farther Evidence of the peaceable Temper and Dispo∣sition of those People; for tho' the ablest, and most learned in their Government, have all along laugh'd at the Stoical Fatality and Re∣probation-Rigours of their Divines, and known what hard measure the Remonstrants the Arminians had met withal; yet never thought it worth while to have the Debate reviv'd, which might only revive new Exasperations about insignificant Opinions; or, as I find it express'd in a late Poem, for Points by neither Party understood. On the other side, to return home, how differently have these Disputes been manag'd amongst us, and how vexatiously conti∣nued? Arminian and Papist, pass'd a long time for Terms synoni∣mous; which not only the Pulpit-Beautifeus, but several Grandees of the House, maliciously apply'd to every Orthodox Divine, and indeed all others, who would not go along with them in those cursed Desolations they then brought upon Church and State; which having
wretchedly effected, how did the Religious Brawl multiply upon their Hands? With what implacable Enmity, did the Presbyterian and Independant prosecute each other? And how violent in their several ways, both against them, and one another, were the nu∣merous Spawn of Equivocal Sects, which like the overflowing Nile, their Deluge of Mischief so fatally produc'd? Insomuch, as when Cromwel had bestrid the Commonwealth, and set himself in the Saddle, he was presum'd to connive at several Church of England-Congregations, both in Publick Parishes, and Private Assemblies, in spite to the Presbyterians, and other Sectaries, whom he dreaded as much as the Loyal Party; and did, with reason, expect they should improve those Calumnies, and Invectives against him, whereof he had been the grand Promoter against their Righful and Lawful King; and so he found it to his End, which that per∣plexity and vexation he met with from Fanaticks of all sorts, and in all Places, City, Country, but especially his Army, was presum'd to hasten. 'Tis true, when the Legislative Power, the other day, thought fit to establish them an Indulgence, there was a Project set on-foot to make Two Sticks one, (to use their own Canting Terms) and se∣veral Proposals laid down in order thereunto; yet we find them still separated from one another, and the several Parties, upon every little occasion, dividing among themselves, tho' much Art is used to smother and conceal it: At the best, it was but a Flou∣rish, a Cord of Vanity, which bound them together, and it held accordingly; neither can you expect otherwise, upon consideration of the Causes which that great Ʋndertaker assigns of those Divisions, the Root from whence their Discords spring: Come they not hence, even of our Lusts? Whatever you find to have been the Cause of them,Two Sticks made one, p. 28. whe∣ther Spiritual Pride, or a Contentious Disposition, or an Affectation of Singularity, or Error of Opinion, or Admiration of Mens Persons, or a Sowrness of Spirit, or an Ambition of drawing Disciples after us: Let the Cause be what it will, it must be remov'd, &c. All which is sooner said than done; such Pecadillo's, and of so long Continu∣ance, are not easily dislodg'd: Although he might as well have taken his Character from St. Paul's Perillous Times,2 Tit. 3 Ver. 9. which he foretells in the last Days, when Men should be Heady, High-minded, Cove∣tous, Proud, Boasters, &c. so far from growing better, as he de∣clares they should wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being, deceived. Now, Sir, whatever Censure I may incur from others, my Ap∣peal is to your self, whether the Account here given of these Peo∣ple be any other, than what their daily Practices do sadly; veri∣fie?
And if left to their own Culture, and Ingenuity, any likeli∣hood they should reform? 'Tis grown as customary, as habitual with them, to thwart, contradict, and oppose, as with the Dutch to live quietly, and mind their own business: From which Disposition of theirs, I may continue the Disparity, and observe, Thirdly, How their constant application to Business and Imploy∣ment, afford them no time to dream of New Lights, or trouble themselves about any other Perswasion, as to Religion, than what they were brought up in; For, as at their first Establishment, there were Three predominant Way of Opinion, (I won't say Doctrine) and Worship, which they had then Reform'd themselves into, Lutherans, Calvinists, and Anabaptists; so the Toleration more espe∣cially extended to them, and has been generally continued down in the same Families, from Father to Children ever since; neither is it so usual with them to flitt up and down, from one Maggotty Perswasion to another, as among us. Those upstart puny Sects, which arose of later Days, are mostly Foreign, and mostly from England too, as the Brownists, and Independents first, the Sabbata∣rians after them, then Quakers, Muggletonians, and what not? Who have, prevail'd with some of the Natives to be as foolish and mad as themselves, but not many; and, perhaps, had they been kept to the same Thoughtfulness at home for Bread, and all other Necessaries of Life, would not have so wantonly gone a-Whoring with their own Inventions. And the like reason may be given, that there are not so many Libertines, Atheistical, Profane Persons, as in many other Parts, where all Religions are Tolerated: It cannot seem strange there should be some without any; and that there are not more, shall not be attributed so much to their Vertue as Necessity: For not only their Mechanicks and Tradesmen, but Persons of the best Quality, are oblig'd to the like Care and Industry, as to the Concerns of Hu∣mane Life. The Ground on which their many populous Cities stand, is of small Compass; and the Rents of that little Land they have, are very low, not able to maintain any one in the Port of a Gentleman; (that is, an Idleman, which is their Term for that degree) whereof as there are few Ancient Families amongst them, so the Children of those that are, as likewise of their Chief Ma∣gistrates, and Rich Merchants, are constantly brought up to some Imployment, Military or Civil, with an Education agreeable there∣unto, which, together with their Natural Disposition, keeps their Thoughts fix'd upon things really advantageous; and so you shall generally find them very intent upon their Designs, and assiduous
in their Application. Will you give me leave to apply this and observe how opposite their Course is to that of our Mercurial Wits, who being born to great Fortunes, and valued for the great Worth of those Predecessors which rais'd them, as if nothing else were wanting which should recommend them to the World, think themselves above any serious Application, either as to Business, or Knowledge. I need not tell you now little, or no, Education our young Master has from his very Cradle; how careful the good Lady-Mother is, he should not be kept in too much at School; what a fruitless Figure he makes in the Ʋniversity; and when he comes up to the Extravagancies of the Town, is as much for living a∣bove sober Sence, as our Dissenters above Ordinances. God forbid this should be a General Rule; yet it could be wish'd there were more Exceptions, than daily Experience will permit us; to observe: Li∣berty of Life, tho' not so much clamour'd for, is as much in Vogue as Liberty of Conscience, and the one doubtless consequent of the other: For the practical Atheist hath been ever thought to intro∣duce the Speculation; and when Men are left free to all Religions, that is the proper time to set up for none. I remember, during Cromwel's Ʋsurpation, the Leviathan-Doctrine was first started; and as some Gentlemen of too good Parts, unless better employ'd, were industrious to cultivate and improve it, so many of our Airy Sparks about Town, and elsewhere, became their sordid Imitators: Nothing would go down with them, but a State of War, with a total Abolition of all difference between Good and Evil, Right and Wrong. Now, whether it was their being weary, or asham'd, of such unreasonable Notions, or an affectation of Novelty, the delight of vain Minds, Deism seems to have superseded that, and is be∣come at present the Darling-Subject of every young Libertine's Dis∣course; who will presume to expose, and run down Reveal'd Reli∣gion with all Confidence imaginable, altho' the little Impertinent never thought a sober hour in its life; and understands the Philo∣sophy of Matter and Motion, no farther, than that his own Brains are in a continual Hurry: Not but that these Engines too are set on work by some more plodding Heads, who have several secret De∣signs in exploding the Authority of Scripture, upon the Politick as well as Prophane Account; and, among the rest, to buoy up such Models of Government, as the Belief thereof expresly overthrows. Here then arises the main Quere: What shall we do with such Dissenters as these? The Sceptick, the Deist, the Atheist, under what Class shall we place them? They have the same Plea to be conside which the others always brought, that is, Number and
being able to vie, in either Particular, with any of their differing Factions, and, for ought I see, in a short time, may outdo them all; since daily Experience assures us 'tis the last result of Fana∣tick Zeal; for being over-heated, and weary, with running its se∣veral Courses of Faction and Opinion, it sits down in the end, and centres here. And yet, all this while, the rest will not see what a fine Thread they have spun for themselves, as well as us; whilst the one are undermining the Church of England, these others are doing the same to the Christian Religion: Altho', to speak im∣partially, the Latitude some Divines have taken, as to the Socinian, and other Points of like Nature, must be acknowledg'd not a lit∣tle conducing to this Grand Apostacy; so readily will Corrupt Minds improve bad Principles, deny those Mysteries by wholesale, which some Mens rash and nice Enquiries had made more perplex'd and intricate, than the Simplicity of True Religion stands in need of, or did ever design. And this, Sir, is the result of an Ʋnlimited Toleration; which going on at this rate, (unless the Pater Noster Men interpose their Inquisition) must necessarily end in a Sit anima mea cum Philosophis. Fourthly, Another thing which makes the Dutch Toleration sit the more easie, is, That Their Government is most exact and punctu∣al in the Administration of Justice, and Execution of Law; which as they are enacted at first, upon the mature deliberation of a few sober understanding Men, with sole regard to the Common Weal, the Publick Good; so, once proclaim'd, there is no evading their true Import, or escaping the Penalty of a Violation: The Lawyers among them dare not Open, or so much as Qutch against what their Superiours have thought fit to establish, much less study Flaws, and hammer out Niceties, to gratifie bad Men, in frustrating what∣ever good the Legislative Power design'd, and put them to the trou∣ble of an Explanatory Act next Session, which runs the same risque: Yet that we are under these very Circumstances, I need not tell you; which, with the Insolency of Faction, the remissness and in∣differency of the Executive Power, hath brought us too nigh an Affinity with that deplorable Estate of the Jewish Anarchy, where e∣very one did what seem'd right in his own Eyes. Otherwise, we have Laws more than enough; and could they have executed themselves, all Allegations for a Toleration had been long since quash'd; not on∣ly the Externals of God's Publick Worship had been kept up in Decency and Order, but every Man's Temporal Concern, his Right and fix'd upon a much surer Bottom. On the contrary, a Indifferency, as to Religious Duties, hath so far unprincipled,
and debauch'd Mens Minds, that our modern Faith is not only with∣out Works, but so wholly confin'd to some Spiritual Chimaera's, as there is little of Truth or Trust in the ordinary Transactions of Hu∣mane Life: Our Meum and Tuum is in a very precarious Condition, what with the Latitude of their new Notions, and the advantage to be taken from the Perplexity, the Niceties of our Laws, with the little Tricks of Practice, so shamefully now a-days alla-mode, an un∣designing Integrity can scarce tell whom to trust, and is frequently at a loss, either to recover Right, or repel Wrong: Neither will it be ever otherwise, as long as so many Law-jobbing Make-bates are suf∣fered to swarm in every County throughout the Kingdom. Were Grievances to be redress'd by their Malignity and epidemick Contagion, I know no one thing sooner to be consider'd; that it is otherwise, you and I cannot help. In short, Sir, a strict and Regular Execu∣tion of Laws, is the Life and Soul of any Government. Take these two different Instances: In the Spanish Netherlands, we find the Romish Religion solely establish'd, with the Rigour, tho' not the Name, of that Inquisition; which was the most plausible Plea for their first Defection: On the other side, in the Ʋnited Pro∣vinces, there is a general Toleration; both which, the Ʋniformity of the one, and Indulgence of the other, are supported, and kept up, by a vigorous Execution of such Laws as were thought most proper thereunto; and if either, the latter are the more exact and severe, by reason it is so natural for different Opinions to clash with, and thwart each other; so far are they from admitting them into the Magistracy, giving the least way to New Lights, and Fanciful Enthu∣siasms there, as well knowing such a Freedom is enough to make any Government as monstrous as that Picture, which had an Hanc Populus affix'd. Fifthly, I shall only add farther, that the Dutch Toleration was established in the Infancy of the Reformation, when Men had a sin∣cere and unfeigned Zeal for the Truth of Religion, desired nothing more than to have her free'd from Ignorance and Superstition, such spurious Doctrines, and burthensome Ceremonies, as rust of Time, neglect of Enquiry, and, above all, the Intrigues of Papal Ʋsurpa∣tion, had impos'd upon the World, and for several Centuries together made pass for Catholick. Now, altho' this Zeal was not always ac∣cording to Knowledge, the different, and, in some Places, not justi∣fiable Methods which were taken, did much obstruct, ay, and scanda∣lize so good an Undertaking; yet the maint Point being gain'd in shaking off the Roman Yoke, whether out of Interest, Prudence, or Piety, I shall not determine, Men generally sat down abundantly
satisfied with the Enjoyment of that Perswasion, which deepest Impression upon their Minds: And this happened in such a juncture for the Ʋnited Provinces, as perhaps no Age will be ever able to paralell. For the Spanish Interest prevaling in Brabant, and Flanders, with the Walloon Provinces, whoever could; or would not submit, retreated hither, as likewise great multitudes out of France and Germany; which made them the Pantheon, the common Re∣ceptacle of all People pretending to the Liberty of Conscience, the only thing then desired, and in the enjoyment whereof (whether well or ill-inform'd we are not now to enquire) they were abun∣dantly satisfied. How much the World (especially amongst us) is cool'd as to such a Temper, and heated as to much worse Dispositions, our many Feuds and Factions, unreasonable Cavils, and implacable Enmities, too sadly declare. Men, now a-days, bellow out the Protestant Religion, the Protestant Religion, as the Jews of old, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, as if the very name, or relation there∣unto, might authorize the grossest Impieties, their wilful Perjuries, and seditious Practices, the Violation of Publick Laws, and disturbance of Publick Peace, even to a most unnatural Rebellion, and execrable Regicide: This, Sir, impartially speaking, is undeniable Matter of Fact; and if ever the Nation returns to its Wits again, sober Sence, and sound Principles, such Protestants will be recorded with a very black Character, the Reproach not only of the Reformation, but of every thing which tends to true Religion, like the Pharisees and Zea∣lots among the Jews, sacrificing all to their own gross, Hypocrisie, sordid Avarice, and self-will'd Ambition; and God grant they do not bring the like fatal End upon our Place and Nation: The dread∣ful apprehension whereof makes not only my hand, but my heart, tremble; and, amid'st such melancholy Reflections, wish to have been born in an Age, when Wise Men had had the Ascendent of Fools, and Honest Men of Knaves. On the contrary, as things now stand, you know the Close of that Old Rhime, Knaves and Fools will quite undoe us. Neither can our Prospect be much better, if we look upon the Reformation abroad: What a strange Indifferency have some Great Princes of the Empire lately discover'd? And how gross the Apo∣stacy of others? To be sure, where there was a General Toleration of Lutheran and Calvinists, together, with the several other differ∣ing Perswasions, Anabaptists, Arrians, Socinians, &c they are ei∣ther wholly extirpated, as in Bohemia, Moravia, the Two Austria's, Poland, &c. or in a fair Tendency thereunto, as at present in
Hungary, and Transilvania: In all which Places they were very nu∣merous; but what with contending amongst themselves, and in∣novating, or opposing the Establish'd Government, they have been ei∣ther worm'd, or beaten out, with all the contempt and ease ima∣ginable: And that the same Design is carrying on amongst us, and the same Event expected, they must be wilfully blind who do not see, what with Licentiousness on the one hand, and Hypocrisie on the other, the no-Reality of such as pretend most, and great Indiffe∣rency of all the rest; as we are naturally prone to fall into Extreams, so we seem strangely dispos'd (and the more, because unwilling to believe it, to fall into that which we have all along pretended most vehemently to avoid. Thus, Sir, have I impartially, and perhaps too freely, told you what I know, and what I think of the Dutch Toleration; yet with∣out this Freedom, it had been impossible to set you in a True Light, so as to discover the gross mistakes of our Commonwealth Preten∣ders, who are always admiring the Hollanders, with the Excellent Administration People live under there; which nevertheless they understand no more, than how the Empire, and Army of Russia, is now manag'd during the Czar's Absence; and the many Projects they are so troublesome withal, both in Theory and Practice, are as op∣posite thereunto, as one Pole to the other: Yet, since things are brought to that pass, as a Toleration must be, give me leave to tell you, that venturing in any other than a Dutch Bottom, will ship∣wreck the whole Cargo; that is, without a Metaphor, keeping the Magistracy in such hands as shall be of one Piece, Ʋniform, and Ʋna∣nimous in the Management thereof; for which I shall briefly lay down these following Reasons, and so end your Trouble. 1st. We shall have some Face of Government in an Establish'd Na∣tional Religion; which I mention solely upon a Civil Account, and that not only in regard to the outward Decorum, (which yet ought to be consider'd) but the absolute Necessity thereof, as the only means of preventing those continual Contrasts and Caballings, which the several Factions will have one against another; and if admitted to Debates, all together against that which is uppermost; the Mischief, and Inconveniencies whereof, can no other way be re∣dress'd, than by fixing the Ruling Power in one Perswasion, to whom it shall solely appertain to take care of the whole, see the several Parties enjoy their private Opinions, without the least Infra∣ction upon our Publick Peace. On the other side, let us reflect, first, upon the Ʋndecency of the thing, how preposterous it must seem to any Man of Sence, whether Native or Foreigner, that the Sword
should dance attendance from one Place to another, according to the Caprice of each prevailing Faction: This Year's Lord Mayor has a Conscience of such Latitude, as to Trim it between Church and Con∣venticle, without the least regret; whereas his Successor may have one so squeamish, and streight-lac'd, as not to come within the Sound of St. Paul's Organ, or under the roof of that Sumptuous, and there∣fore Superstitious Structure. But then too having got the Sword to go their own way, how strangely must it wander up and down, as each Party prevail to get into the Chair; one Year it must attend a Presbyterian-Meeting, the next, perhaps, will fall to the Indepen∣dant's Lot, and the Anabaptists will ill resent it to go without their turn; nay, we are not sure but the Quakers may put in their Claim, and without any Offence to the Inward-Man, desire it should attend their Motions on a bulk in Grace-Church-street. This, Sir, I take to be as Natural to the aspiring Spirits of those several Schismatical Herds, as Milk to a Calf, and they will low as much if kept without it; yet how decent this will be, how unbecoming the State and Gravity of any Magistracy, I leave for you, and the World to judge. However that of Publick Security is much more to be consider'd; for whatever Pleas may be alledg'd, or Protestations made, we know how things went, when the weak Conscience had got the strongest Sword, Dominion was then founded in Grace, and the appointed time come for the Saints to inherit the Earth, and bring in Subjection all the Powers of Darkness. 2dly, The Ancient Grandeur and Hospitality of our City-Magistra∣cy, and proportionably of all other Corporations, will be hereby con∣tinued and kept up; which since it came into these hands, hath been most scandalously slighted, and disus'd; for the Character which our Poet Laureat gave of that cursed Shimei, who first led the Van to Faction and Frugality, is true of all the rest, Cool are their Kitchens, tho' their Brains are hot. To speak freely, a sneaking, single-soul'd Sectary, cannot exert it self to any thing that is Great or Generosn, Gain is their Godliness, and Profit their Preferment; in order whereunto, upon Enquiry, you shall find, that those Great Offices wherein worthy Citizens were formerly wont to expend se∣veral thousand Pounds, are now made to bear their own Charges, and bring somewhat into Pocket too: And, as a farther ill conse∣quence hereof, there are those will tell you all Places of Inferiour Trust are dispos'd off accordingly; and whoever makes a hard Bar∣gain, will be more solicitous for his own Reimbursement, than the Commonweal. 'Twas nobly said of Tully, Nec quidquam aliud vi∣dendum est nobis, quos Populus Romanus hoc in Gradu collocarit, nisi ne
quid privatis studiis de operâ publicâ derahamus; neither can it possi∣bly go well with any Government, if Men in Publick Places have not Publick Spirits, under which defect I am afraid our poor Nation, at present more especially, very much labours. 3dly, This will make an exact Discrimination between the truly conscientious Dissenter, and the Politick, the Factious Intriguer; for when every Man must declare to what Body of Church-Membership he will join, and is oblig'd therein to abide (whether in the Lord, or not, the same Lord shall judge at last) our sundry shifting Proteus's such Amphibious Christians, as can live both in Land and Water, Church and Conventicle, (and that, more especially, to get Prey) will intirely be defeated of their many base Ends; Conscience shall have its full Liberty, but the State-Libertine wholly abridg'd from promo∣ting their Maggotty Commonwealth Innovations; or abusing the Sa∣cred Robe of Magistracy, for a Cloak of Maliciousness, Avarice, or both; and were this reasonable▪ distinction effectually prosecuted, and their little factious Properties excluded from voting the Sword into such unworthy Hands, it must fall in course to some honester Man's Lot, who will be the Minister of God for good, and bear it not in vain. 'Tis likewise to be hop'd, this may tend by degrees to the better Information of the deluded People, make them reflect upon the Inconsistency of their Principles, and Unwarrantableness of Schism, how naturally they tend to a licentious Prophanation of all things Sacred and Civil, whilst Men of corrupt Minds can so easily prostitute the most solemn Obligations of Religion, and Conscience, to two such servile respects as Interest and Humour. Neither are we to despair, but it may work a Reformation in the Persons themselves; for generally when Men get nothing by acting the Hypocrite, they care no longer to wear the Vizard, chuse rather to appear as they really are, and fall at last to desire a right Information of Things, since Error and Deceit has fail'd in those Advantages, which were formerly the main Support of their Ʋnrighteous Mammon. But whatever the Event be as to them, I am confident you are satisfied no Government can be safe in such slippery hands; for they that can be any thing, will be every thing, and are good for nothing; having betray'd their own Consciences, is it possible they should demur serv∣ing others in the like kind? 4thly, But to come to that which is most considerable in this case, indeed the main Support of every Government: By this means all Publick Deliberations, and Resolves, will be carried on in a smooth and even, steddy, uniform Course, free from Factious Oppositions, with the many other by-respects of Intriguing Interests: This, I say, in a
, at least, would abate the several Feuds, ay, and Expences too, at the Election of our National Represen∣es, and secure their Debates, when Assembled, from frequent Embarassments, according to the French Term, the Obstructions and Delays, which such as cannot obtain their own private, pettish Hu∣mours, are prone to interpose in the most weighty Transactions, tho' never so prejudicial to the Common Good. In like manner all other sinister Practices, Plots, and Brangles, whether in Towns Cor∣porate, City, or Country, would be reduc'd to something of Temper, Noise and Nonsence being once excluded, such Men in course must come in place, as would speak to the purpose, and act upon a Prin∣ciple. And if any one objects this would be too great an Invasion upon their Liberties, I shall only reply, as at first, 'tis no more than what their admired Neighbours the Hollanders, did upon their own accord, to prevent the dangerous Consequences of their many Popu∣lar Heats, and Tumultuous Assemblies, when they gave way that all their Right thereto should be devolv'd upon a few sober understanding Men, who knew better how to act for the Common Welfare than themselves: But whether many, or few (for this propounds only the exclusion of some, no alteration in the whole Constitution, as well knowing neither Oligarchy, nor Polygarchy will do with us, how∣ever there be zealous Pretenders to both) so they be all of one Piece, Business will go on much the smoother, and be sooner brought to a Conclusion: And therefore give me leave to transferr St. Paul's Comparison, from the Church to the Body Politick, it being equally dangerous to them both, as in the Natural: If the Head be a Mo∣narch, and the Feet Commonwealths-men; the Eye of the Presbyterian, and the Ear of the Congregational Perswasions, with the Devil and all of little Maggotty Sectaries grumbling in the Belly, what care can be taken of the whole? What will become of it in the end? Amongst sundry pretty Crotchets, which in the Low Countries hang out for Signs, there is one at Harlem, call'd the Misforstand, that is, a Barrel of Beer between two Dray-men, turn'd Back to Back, and so pulling two contrary ways. I have known a Nation standing in this unhappy Posture for nigh these Sixty Years together, with these aggravating Circumstances, that as there have been many more than two Pullers, so they pull'd more than Twenty several ways, that the poor Vessel hath been able to hold out thus long is much; yet that it should hold out much longer, will be more to admiration. 5thly, That the Monarch, and Monarchy, will be hereby very much secured, cannot be disputed; for, as we see, how fatal it is, when a Prince differs  his Perswasion from the Establish'd Religion,
so one of that Perswasion is as little secure, if his Ministers, ∣ther inferiour Officers, and Dependants, are of different Sentiments, and Inclinations; and that not only as to Divine Matters, but the very Nature and Original of all Humane Constitutions, and Civil Socie∣ties: And whoever wears the Crown of England, upon any other than the Old Church of England Principle, will neither find that sit easie, nor himself long safe; for notwithstanding the many Protesta∣tions, and Acknowledgments, which either Flattery, or Interest, may for some time, oblige them unto, there is not One in Ten of the seve∣ral Factions, could they have their own Wills, would endure a Mo∣narchy, any more than the Kingdom of Heaven a Commonwealth. That such a Book as Ludlow's Memoirs should come abroad at this time of day, is somewhat odd, and argues his Admirers Men of no little As∣surance; yet really however it may prevail upon the infatuated Se∣ctaries, the many Plots and Counter-Plots there discover'd, their im∣placable Enmities one against another, persidious Hypocrisies, and clandestine Ʋnderminings, with a continued Irresolution as to any thing of Accord and Settlement, must convince every man of Sence, that (like their Infernal Abettor) their sole Talent lay in doing Mischief, opposing, and pulling down; which, having effected, they could no more agree what should succeed, than the Mob of Capua, when they had brought things into the same condition. Read over his whole Second Volume with a serious Attention; and then tell me, whether Hell it self can be represented in greater Confusion, than he doth there the Conduct of Affairs, the Contrasts, and Counterminings of the several Ʋsurping Powers, till things being brought to the Extre∣mity of Distraction, with an Expence of Blood and Treasure, never be∣fore paralell'd, they were forc'd, like the Evil Spirit in the Gospel, to return from whence they set out, and cease troubling the World, till their former Freaks, and its own Follies should be quite forgot; yet these were our Commonwealth-Patriots, the Keepers of our Liber∣ties, and what not: From whom, and all such, God keep this Poor Nation for evermore. 6thly, Were I not sure, you would expect something in reference to the Church of England, I had been wholly silent as to that Point, being of a Perswasion somewhat more sanguine, than most of her Son's Clergy as well as Lay, viz. that what a wise Observer said of the whole Nation in general, is more applicable here, None can destroy her but her self. There is, as I hinted just now, so strict and mutual a dependance between the Crown and Mytre, that they must both stand and fall together: And, give me leave farther to add, we must never expect a settl'd State, or continued Peace, without keeping
, and Necessities themselves , to bring in their true, whenever a Nation is so unhappy divided  it self, fall into Parties, and Fractions, upon any  clesiastical, or Civil; as some Church-men will make themselves  be made Properties therein, so the Church must expect to bear her poportion in such Distractions, and that to a large degree; yet still if the main Body keeps steady to its self, wal by the same Rule, and minds the same Thing, such a reserve of Mercy and Providence will constantly attend her, as tho' persecuted, she shall never be forsaken, cast down, but not destroy'd; and it very rarely happens some great Good does not come out of that Evil. But if she forsakes her self, folds her Arms in a careless Despair, or consults her Peace by an Ʋnion with Faction and Schism, and as the Ju∣dicious Bishop Lay observ'd,Last Ser∣mon at Court, p. 26. pulls down her old Walls, her Confessions of Doctrine, and Canons of Discipline (like the foolish Trojans) to let in a comprehensive Horse, full of those very Enemies, which have us'd all other means, tho' God be prais'd in vain, to effect her ruine. This would be a Perditio tua ex te, and as the same good Man farther declares, against all the Rules of Wisdom and Government, by which it was ever thought necessary, that the People should conform to the Laws of the Church, never that the Church should conform to the Humours of the Peo∣ple; and therefore, as he very well distinguishes, to such as be con∣tent to leave their Faults and Errors behind them, we ought to set our Gates wide open, and need not pull down our Walls; but if they bring their Errors, Animosities, and divided Judgments along with them, to admit such, only secures them from Punishment, but leaves them free to all other Causes of Dissension, or rather fortifies and animates them to pursue their Differences with the greater Violence. God, to be sure, receives none but upon Repentance and Amendment; and why his Church should do otherwise, I am yet to learn; if they will not be the same with us, let them Her by themselves, and not come among us, their Room is better than their Company: And therefore I have always suspe∣cted, either want of Ʋnderstanding, or Affection, in those Persons, who trouble their Heads so much in that Affair, without any re∣gard to the Caution in the Gospel, as likewise the reason of the thing, and will be treating with, ay, and courting too, those Wolves, because they appear in Sheeps Cloathing; or can otherwise alledge some plausible Prnces, which the Devil is never without, nor fails of a supply to such as act on his behalf; whereas Matter of Fact hath all along spoke quite the contrary, the continued Experience of nigh an hundred Years most sadly assur'd us, that they could never
be oblig'd by any Kindness, nor satisfy'd And now, Sir, without doubt you must find the Trouble I was complemented into,  upon your receiving a Volume instead of a Letter. Yet, be assur'd, 'twas with some difficulty it ended here; for having once set my Thoughts afloat, the Current ran so strong, I could not stem its Force so as to stop at pleasure: And by this you may see confirm'd what I have hitherto entertain'd you withal; for if a single Person cannot take his Liberty, in so little an Affair too, without somewhat of Inconvenience and Trouble, how much worse must it prove in a whole Body, a Community of People, who are so easily hurried on, without knowing what they do, or from whom they act, till all end in Mischief and Confusion: And therefore give me leave to declare, that the Restraints propounded in the Premises, whatever satisfaction they may give you, and some few of your Temper, will be no ways acceptable to that extravagant Li∣centiousness, both Corporal and Spiritual, Ecclesiastical and Civil, which hath so long had the Ascendant amongst us, and bears too nigh Affinity to that Acknowledgment in Livy; Nec Morbum ferre possumus, nec Remedium. God, in his due time, make us sen∣sible both of the Folly and Danger, which such Courses tend unto: In the mean while, and ever, continue to defend our Church from all her Enemies, within, as well as with, the daily Pray∣er of, SIR, Yours, &c. —M—. FINIS.
