A Prayer for HIS MAJESTIES Preservation and Safety, in this His present imminent Danger. OMnipotent God, upon whose alone disposition all things depend; We acknow∣ledge and bewaile before thy divine majesty, that our walking unworthy of the late light of the Gospel, and glorious presence amongst us; hath most justly begat thy dereliction, and the giving of us up unto our owne vile and corrupt affections, (the seed-plots of our growing calamities) and put the Sword of thy justice, into the hands of cruell men, and skilfull to destroy. Hence O Lord (through thy just anger) it comes to passe, that thy House, thy beauti∣full House lies wast, that thine Anointed, our King, his feet are fast in the stocks; and that he is pointed out by men of Belial unto death, and destruction: Our sins (O Lord) the great and crying sinnes of this Nation are the fountaine of these, and all the miseries which flow upon us: We beseech thee, through thine infinite mercy, by the power of thy grace, to stay the course of our sinnes, to divert the torrent of thy overflowing judg∣ments, and to pardon our transgressions; O remember not against us former iniquities; let thy tender mercy speedily prevent us, for we are brought very low; Help us O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and purge away our sinnes for thy names sake: Returne, O Lord, returne unto the place of thy worship, and let the light of thy countenance shine againe upon the face of thine Anointed; make up the breaches of thy Church, and restore His Majesty; O let the sighing of the Prisoner come before thee according unto the greatnesse of thy power, preserve thou him who is ap∣pointed to die; And now (O Lord) that he is in the power of his Enemies, let his life be pretious in thy sight; and make it so in theirs also: Remember him, O Lord, concerning this, and wipe not out the good deeds which he hath done for thy house, and the offices thereof; and because the King trusteth in the Lord, therefore through thy mercy (O most High) let him not miscarry: take from them who have a will to hurt him, power; and from them that have power, take away a will: asswage the fury of their malice, we beseech thee, and convert the cruelty of their hatred, (as thou didst Esau's towards Ja∣cob) into the duty of loyall affection: Thou (O Lord) who onely canst still the raging of the Sea, and the madnesse of the People; frustrate their intendments, change their pur∣poses, divert their power, alter their wills: And, as to rescue the life of thy Prophet, thou didst first smite the Syrians with blindnesse; and after didst open their eyes and shew them, that there were more with him, than those that were against him: So we beseech thee to defeat the bloudy Contrivances, and change the cruell resolutions of those whose designe is to take away the Life of thine Anointed our Soveraign Lord King CHARLS; shew unto their Consciences the great guilt of so horrible impiety; let the power of thy word prevaile over the power of their wills; teach them, that thy permission unto such sinfull actions doth no way warrant thy approbation, but manifest thy forsaking of them: Therefore (O Lord) in mercy unto His Majesty; unto them, unto us, and unto the three Kingdomes, oppose powerfull impediments, and sufficient hindrances unto their per∣verse purposes; awe them with thy feare, and make them afraid to stretch forth their hands against thine Anointed. And thou (O Lord) who hast the sole direction, and limitation of sinne; and onely canst bring good out of evill; bring good out of the evill of these mens sin; bring good thereout unto thy Church, Safety and Honour unto His Majesty, and Peace and tranquillity unto these Kingdomes, by subduing the affections of His People under thy Vicegerent, by restoring them unto their former, loyall, and Christian subjection unto Him, and by uniting all His Subjects in the fast bond of mutuall love, and Christian kindnesse one towards another. Thou (O Lord) who gavest thine onely begotten Sonne for thy Church, heare our Prayers for thy Church, and for thy Churches sake; heare us for our Soveraigne the nur∣sing Father of this Church, and that for thy Words sake, and for thy Christs sake, Unto whom with thee, and the Holy Ghost, be ascribed all praise, power, and dominion, now and for ever, Amen.
