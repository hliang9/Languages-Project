A true Relation of the Trauels of M. Bush. a Gentleman: who with his owne handes withou any other mans helpe made a Pynace, in which hee past by Ayre, Land, and Water: From Lamborne, a place in Barkshire, to the Custome house Key in London. 1607 London printed by T. P. for Nathaniel Burter, 1608.
To the Reader. IN different Readers, whose iudgments are sophistically mixt with humors, or con∣ceits, as many are now a dayes, who are more ready to condemne with their turbulent tongues, then to amend with sensible iudg∣ments: As for them, or any such carpers, I am reasonably perswaded to set as lightly by their censures, as they are farre from conceiuing well of any thing, but what agrees with their owne humors, or fictions. To those that are of more plausible spirits, who (for the most part either say little, or conceit the best, and either applaud what is good, or passe ouer with silence what is not hurtfull: And to those that ha∣uing some vnderstanding themselues in this Arte, as either Nauigators, or Shipwrights, and are de∣sirous to be partakers of the Experiments & Pra∣ctises of other mens knowledge. To the one I commit the censure, to the other the profitte of this Trauellors labours: knowing that such as are
wise, will rather winke at samll faults, then rashly reproue what may pleasure others. Though such as are curious, and thinke themselues sufficiently expert in this Arte, finde nothing herein contei∣ned that may satisfie their expectation: yet the Gentlemans hope is, they will iudge fauourably of his intentions and proceedings, and passe it ouer with patience, for affections sake to the Arte it selfe: and hereafter doubts not but to doe them more profit and pleasure in matters of some other deepe performances. If any thinke, that what this booke speakes, is very strange; he may see the very title saies as much: And it is good for an Au∣thor to be as good as his title. If any thinke it is but a Tale, and no truth, I cite you my Tales∣maister, (which is more then most men will doe.) And he to auoide euery such imputation, hath his confirmation hereof, vnder the hands and seales of the chiefest of the Custome house in London, besides many thousand witnesses in the Coū∣trey. Then sit downe and read it, if it doe not profit thee, yet his trust is, it shall not displease thee. A. N.
A True relation of the trauels of VVil∣liam Bush gent: that without more helpe then his owne, made a Py∣nace, by which he past by Ayre, Land, and Water: No man ayding, or assisting him. THe Bée, by serious industrie, gathering a certaine hidden vertue from sundry sortes of flowers and hearbes, and making thereof (by labour and trauell,) a materiall lumpe, namely, the Honny-combe; is not therefore to be condemned of any, but ra∣ther highlie to be commended of all. The Phisition of many simples, making one compound medicine, doth not onely reape profit to himselfe by the same, but purchaseth commendations, and applaudities of o∣thers. And the studious Reader, out of sundry Au∣thors doth select some cheife principles, which he re∣cordeth as memorials, either to aduantage himselfe, or to adde pleasure to others.
Of these thrée comparisons: The first is excellent for imitation in generall. The second very necessarie for diuers in particular. And the last, though not so highlie estéemed of the common sort of people, by rea∣son of their ignorance in Artes, and Sciences: yet for the good that may come thereby to a common wealth, nothing inferiour to the best: Especially where the studie tendeth to good and vertuons exercises, or the practise and contemplation thereof to laudable Artes, and experiences: Of which Artes, namely, Mathe∣maticall; the practise of Nauigation is a principall member: as hauing participation in Arithmeticke, Geometry, Geography, Cosmography, and Astrono∣mie, or rather (to say the trueth) the quintessence, yea the very proofe and tryall of them all: For albeit men read or here neuer so much of Cosmography, or Astro∣nomie, yet without practise and experience it is vn∣perfect. And how can perfection bee attained, but by making vse & transporting from place to place, therby beholding the diuersities of daies and nightes, with the temperature of the Ayre in sundrye regions, by which the whole course and reuolution of the spheare, is made apparant to mans capcity? Séeing therefore that the same Art and skill is not performed, either by rashnes of chaunce, or strangenes of miracle, but ac∣cording to certain vniuersall precepts, or documents deriued from the mathematicall fountaines, beeing the very essentiall matter and substance thereof; I thought good (being intreated thervnto) not to omitte a most strange, and well deseruing labor, of no lesse worth than wonder, effected and brought to passe by a Gentleman of our owne countrey: The which (but that we are very much adicted to admire strange, and contemne our owne, according to the old prouerbe: Forsooth it must needes be true: For I haue learn'd it of a Iew.)
would beget as good an opinion amongst vs: for first inuenting the same, as that same miraculous instru∣ment did amongst them of Amelphis, reported of by Pandulphus Collenutius, in his Neapolitane history. Not therefore to beguile Expectation, without any longer continued preāble of his practices, I make no doubt but vpon relation of his aduenturous and strange Uoyage, you will ioyne in admiration of his skill, and fortune. Insomuch, as such as haue conferred with the skil∣fullest Nauigators of our Land: with such as haue béen principall Actors in our furthest North-east, and North-west discoueries: with such as haue béen in the South Sea, and at the Cape of Bona Speranza, could neuer report of such a performance as this gen∣tlemans, which for rarenes, hath the wonder and ap∣probation of all men, and for trueth, the confirmation of many thousand eye-witnesses. And it was this. With a fewe tooles, or instrumentes, and with his owne handes (no man in the least measure ayding or assisting him) he framed and fashioned a Pynace by his cunning and skill Mathematique and Geometri∣call, which without the helpe either of man, or beast to moue the same forward, past by Ayre, Land, and Water, onely by his owne industry, and labor, viz. Thréescore yardes in the Ayre, Sixe and Twentie myles vpon the Land, and an hundreth miles vppon the water.
The true manner of this Pynaces deuises for her proceedings in the Ayre. FOr her passage in the Ayre she had twoo stronge Cables al∣most of Thréescore and sixe yardes in length, and an hundreth weight a péece, stra∣ned by wyndlesses, and other strange, and vnheard-of deui∣ses very stiffely from the bat∣tlements of the Church To∣wer of Lamborne in the Countie of Berke: being a Tower of great height, aboue an hundreth foote dis∣tant one from the other, iust the breadth of the Py∣nace, to twoo trées in the same Churchyard an hun∣dreth foote likewise distant from the Tower: On which Cables or Ropes the Pynace did slyde, with certaine yron ringes on either side the same framed for that pupose, and diuers other engins that caused her (by one mans strength in her) without other helpe to mount vp to the top of the same Tower, and to des∣cend againe to the ground at his pleasure: and that with great facilitie, although the beholders iudged it at first as possible as to quench fire with fewell, drown an Eagle with water, or extinguish a burning ague with hotte wines. There was likewise a frame of Timber vppon the toppe of the Tower, to which the maine great Cables were fastened with windlesses, and other deuises in
it; Another frame also of Timber was fastened déepe in the earth with windlesses, and other Engins to straine the ropes, and assist the Pynace in moouing by other deuices: Two ropes turned in the windles∣ses vppon the top of the Tower and in the foresaid frame with counterpoises in pullyes, to assist the mo∣tion of the Pynace, and to cause her to moue by de∣grées either ascending, or descending. Thus, Art ioy∣ned with industrie and labor, turnes to good effect and purpose, exercises of most ambiguous doubts and dif∣ficulties. The skilfull Marryner who hath read ma∣ny bookes of Nauigation, vnto his skill must of neces∣sitie adde labor and frauell, else it nothing auaileth: But compared to a burning candle, that (hild vnder a bushell) yéeldes no light, or comfort. Art is the in∣duction, and plat-forme: But Trauell, and Labor bring all things to good end, and perfection. The manner of her proceeding by land. THis Pynace that thus serues to such seuerall v∣ses, as Ayre, Land, and Water, might séeme to performe things not to bee marshalled within the ly∣mits and bounds of humane reason, and to be incom∣prehensible vnto mans sence, and to lead and carry it away captiue to astonishment and admiration; but that hée, that distributes knowledge and vnderstan∣ding among men, according to such measure, times, and means, as séem best vnto himselfe, opens the eies of beliefe. The causes therefore known, the wonder may cease. For the Pynaces passage by land shée had fower whéeles, all made and framed by this gentleman, whereof thrée serued to carry her, and the fourth tur∣ned in her, with diuers other Engyns that caused her by one mans labor and strength to passe forward ei∣ther
vp a hill, or in déepe way, and he himselfe in her. Her whéeles were thus placed, two of them being foure foote and an halfe high, were set in the forepart of the Pynace on either side one, vpon a square iron axeltrée: The third turned in a frame of thrée foote high, and was fastened by deuises at the hinder part of the Pynace, directly vnder the Sterne, with which he would make such swift spéed on land, as many fol∣lowed to behold him, and to witnesse with their eies, what their thoughts could not conceiue to be credible. But as, Ea habentur optima, quae & iucunda, honesta, & vtilia, So this workeman, so highlie commended, and respected for this péece of workemanship, trauel∣led vp and downe with as great a troope after him, as are commonly congregated vpon any feriall▪ or festi∣uall assembly, which may happily worke such good ef∣fects in some of them, that (as Tacitus reporteth the Germaines to haue encouraged themselues to the warres, with séeing, and singing the worthy wonders and heroicall exploytes of Hercules.) So some may be drawn by example of his industrious indeauours, and labour to lay asyde, and shake of the fruitles im∣bracementes of Idlenes, and betake themselues to such necessarie experiments as may worthyly tend to praise, profit, or pleasure. The manner of her proceeding by Water. TWo things, are in euery instrument or vessell of speciall & most necessary consideration: The one, The body (as it were) and substance of it: The o∣ther, The end, and purpose wherevnto it serues: The body and substance of euery one, as namely of this lit∣tle Pynace (whereof is now spoken) we may call the
Materiall partes of which it consists, with their parti∣cular formes, such▪ as wherby that end may be best at∣tayned: I meane best, both with the greatest cer∣taintie, and most possible facilitie: The Purpose, or end, wee may tearme, either the commodities to bee reaped thereby, or the sin guler and pleasant vses wherevnto it is or may bee applyed. The materiall parts of this little Pynace beeing already set downe, with some partes of the vses, the rest follow thus. For her passage by water, shee was very carefully calked, and pitched to kéepe the water forth: Shée had also a seat placed in her, iust in her middle part, and doubtles right opposite one against the other: she had oares likewise of an equall length and weight to rowe her with, and foure mastes and yardes of the most fine light timber that might be had, or procured: shée was orderly rigged with ropes and sailes, and in all poyntes had all manner of tacklings prouided for her as fit and necessarie, as belongeth to a ship of her burthen: Shée had twelue péeces of Ordinance in her, that went off by a strange deuise in iust order one after the other; They were planted on a platforme framed for that purpose vppon the Tower-decke in their equall proportions, and no man neere them at their discharging: Her forecastle was framed lower then the sterne by a foote; vpon euery toppe, and yard arme shée was garnished, and set forth with flagges, auncients, streamers, and pendents of rich Taffetie, the coulours sable, and argent, according to the cou∣lours of him that made and framed her: Her seue∣rall flagges were beautified with diuers Coates of Armes, as the Armes of England, the Essex coate, the Harecourtes, and the Waynemans: And the coate of the Shippewright, and his ancestors, with diuers other Gentlemen of woorthe, and wor∣ship in that Countrey. Had the speculation of this
matter come to our imagination by sence, or memo∣rie. The respect hereof had not so déepely resided in mens contentments, for ignoti nulla Cupido, But being an obiect presented to the eyes, and ratified to be true by the Testimonie of many thousand witnes∣ses (all one mans labour and workemanship) it hath or awne many mens humors and affections to concur in pleasure, and admiration, and (but that it hath bin séen) it might be thought a thing impossible to be com∣passed by humane vnderstanding. And yet it may be that some superficiall shippe-wrights, or vngrounded Schollers in that Arte, who, ad pauca respicientes de facili iudicant, will thinke this easy to bee performed, because they can say, they knowe it: But that will not suffice, because the sphere of knowledge doth infi∣nitely excéed the limits of coniecture, or not déepe, and profound capacities: yet they will oftentimes goe a∣bout to derogate from others woorth, for that they themselues hunt gréedily after admiration. I haue heard a merry report: That ships of sundry Nations, lying in harbour in faire weather, The young Mariners were climing, and shewing feates of Actiuitie, one of one Nation to outbragge the other, At length a nimble yonckster gets him to the very top of the foremast, and raysing himselfe bolt vpright▪ tur∣ned round vppon his foote without any stay, challen∣ging his Antagonist or any of the Nation to doe the like: His Antagonist presently vndertaketh the chal∣lenge: But hauing turned scarce halfe about, fell downe, and (as god would) in his tumbling by good hap, caught hold of the shrowds: And as soone as e∣uer he had a litle recoured his spirits, being halfe dead for feare, yet set a bold countenance on the matter: & he also againe with a loud voice dared his aduersarie or any other of that Nation to doe the like: as though that which befell him by his error, he had done of very
purpose: Euen so diuers that haue performed some sleight matters, or voyages, wil take vpon them, and crack and boast they haue done great things, and ac∣cording to Artes and happely will speake and talke of strange wonderes such as haue neuer béene heard of, and of gulfes▪ and currents, more by many then euer God made, when indeede these shifts are but to shadowe their ignorance, and when all sauours of as much Art, as that was which the fellow before speci∣fied wrought his feare by. To such I could with they would haue in remem∣brance a saying of Apelles vnto Megabysus a noble man of Persia, who comming into his shop, although his knowledge was but small, yet was hee loath to haue it, appeae that he was ignorant of any thing. And therefore began to question, a dispute of liues, of shadowes, and of such like matters belonging to the Art: But Apelles intreated him to make more spare of his speech, for (saith he) my youthes which grind my colours, hearing your idle discourses, doe derive them, which before had you in great admi∣ration for your gallant shew, & presence: Now to the manner of his further proceedings. The manner of the Pynaces trauell. I doe not thinke there is any man that either regar∣deth Gods glory, or esteemeth of humane society, but holdeth this Arte and faculty of Nauigation and Shipwrights, (for this Gentlemans practise partici∣pates of both) the most excellent that are exercised amongst men. And therefore it is of very due right, that the practisers thereof, should be had in deserued reputation: Neither is there any other Arte where∣in God sheweth his diuine power so manifestly, as in this: permitting vnto them certaine rules to
worke by, & increasing them from time to time, gro∣wing still onwards towards perfection, as the world doth towards his end: and yet reserueth vnto him∣selfe the managing of the whole: That when the pra∣ctises of this faculty haue done what they can accor∣ding to the skill they haue, or shall learne heereafter, he yet alwaies maketh manifest, that none but hee a∣lone is Lord of the Ayre, Land, and Water, that all stormes and tempests doe but fulfill his wil and plea∣sure, and all the waues of the waters are continually at his commandement: Sufficiently verified by the seuerall occurrents that befell in this aduenturers voyage, which was thus begunne and proceeded. Upon Monday being the twentieth day of Iulie last past, betweene the houres of nine and ten of the clocke in the forenoone, This said Pynace was brought foorth of the house of the right worshipfull William Essex Esquire, of Lamborne aforesaid, be∣ing neere vnto the Church, to proceede and passe for∣wards in her iourney, viz. From the battlements of the Church tower of Lamborne, by Ayre, Land, and Water vnder LONDON bridge to the Custome house Key of the Citie of London, by the industrie and labour of one only man that framed her. Being brought into the Church yard, she shot of her ordi∣nance, being twelue peeces, in order one after ano∣ther, to the wonderfull admiration of the multitude of people that were there assembled to behold her, for the most part of them neuer sawe shippe, or py∣nace before, except it were some few of the better sort. There the multitude of people was so great, that by reason of the throng, and presse amongst them, one whole houre was spent before the Pynace could be brought to the ground platforme; and set∣led vpon the Cables to ascend vp to the battlements of the Tower,
Shée was no sooner set vppon the Cables, but was ascended by degrees vp into her place vppon the battlementes, not hauing any man in her: where shée continued till two of the clocke in the afternoone: At which time shee was let of from the Tower, the distance of twentie foote to hang in the ayre, in the full viewe, and sight of all the people there present: As shée so hunge in the Ayre, her Ordinance went of, and no man neare her by Twentye foote with many fire woorkes, and other strange and worthy deuises, to satisfye the peoples expectation for that day, for the voyage was determined to beginne the next day following. But the vngouern'd vulgar sort of people not content with these shewes (albeit they came Gratis) began to gather together in a tu∣multuoue and vnruly head, as if they meant soure hurt or preiudice to the woorke, or workman, for they pretended themselues not satisfied with all this, ex∣cept they might sée one come downe from the toppe of the Tower in the same boate or Pynace: which the framer of the woorke perceiuing, and knowing the multitude to bee compared to a beast of manye heads, vnstayed in respect of many guides, vncon∣stant in respect of many mindes, and vnruly in re∣spect of many members, thought good to preuent by satisfying their murmuring mindes with the ef∣fect of their desires: For the Authour of all that businesse, to please the incredulous people, and to fulfill the insacietie of the Common sort, went vp to the battlementes and downe againe in her, to the astonishment of many, and to the full sa∣tisfaction and content of all, béeing twoo thousand in number at the least: and about sixe of the clocke in the afternoone shée returned into the place from whence shée came.
Vpon Tuesday the one and twenteth day of Iuly, betweene the houres of twelue and one of the clocke that day, this Pinace was prepared to set forward on her voyage, little thinking that the concourse of people had bin so great, as was there the day before to hinder her passage: but when shee was brought foorth into the Churchyard, she found there the num∣ber much increased, and the company as troublesome and vnruly, as the day passed: yet that did not let, or with-hold the determinate purpose of her procee∣dings, but with the great labor and paines of twen∣tie men at the least that were helping, shee was brought to be set vppon the Roapes, and there rested fortie foote from the ground, out of the peoples reach, vntil such time as al things were sufficiently viewed by him that was to trauaile in her: for it behooued him to extend his care in a case of such danger, where he had so great a wager, as the venture of his life, in the performance of his vndertaken voyage; and the rather, for that the loue, the demeanor and dispositi∣on of the people that were there, were altogether vn∣knowne vnto him, whose rule and vndiscreete beha∣uiors afterwards appeared to bee such, as by their negligence they had purchased to themselues and o∣thers, an vntimely ruine and ouerthrowe, had not Gods loue, and mercy beene beyond all hope, mea∣sure, and expectation. For this Aduenturer hauing many friends (for hee was very well beloued) to the number of threescore persons, men, women and chil∣dren being assembled together, and got vppon the top of the Towre, contrary to his knowledge, where the platforme was, & where diuers other ropes belong∣ing to the pullies, and counterpoises were fastened to the maine pynnacles thereof: the common multitude little regarding, and lesse knowing to what vses they were made, some leaned, some hung, & some sat vpon
the ropes, othersome gate vp to the top of the pynna∣cles to which the ropes were fastned, and there stood holding the yron (whereon the Uane was sixt) in their handes, that they might the better, haue full sight of the comming vp of the Pynnace: But as Mala minus expectaeta grauiora, so the mischiefe that then suddenly befell was the more grieuous, by how much it was the lesse expected, or dreamed vpon. For at the first motion of the Pynace hauing her Com∣mander in her, determined to ascend towards the top of the tower, 2. of the maine pynnacles, with men vp∣on them, fell down into the tower, amongst the people yt was there standing as thick as might be, that euery one was in great hazard & dāger. But here God shew∣ed his wōderfull mercy, for neither they vpō the pin∣nacles, nor vpon the ropes, nor any of them that were standing vpon the leades vnder the fall of the pinna∣cles had any harme or hurt, or receiued any bruise by the fall thereof, although by estimation they were ei∣ther of thm iudged 2000. waight. There might you haue heard a grieuous stir and la∣mētation of the people for the suspected losse of friends, some crying for the losse of their husbandes, some for the lacke of wiues and children: other some for their friends, and kinsfolke, all greatly doubting, and mis∣trusting that a great part of the people in the Tower, had by that fall bin vtterly killed, or at least grieuous∣ly hunt or maymed: but when an happy voyce gaue notice from the top of the Tower, that no person had sustained either losse of life or limbe, or receiued any hurt or bruise, the people all wondered at so strange a miracle, and gaue God the glory: yet some of the most incredulous sorte remayned doubtfull and would not bee confident of such happinesse or good fortune, vntill they might see their husbands, wiues, and children come downe and descend from the toppe
of the Tower: which was not long a doing, for e∣uery man striued to make most hast, and he thought himselfe most fortunate that could attaine to bee for∣most. All this time, hée that had vndertaken this iourney sat ready in the Pynace to procéede in her, and beheld all that disasterous chaunce which had happened, But when he sawe that all was in safetie, and that neither man, woman, nor child had receaued the least hurt by that accident, hée was much ioyfull for them, greatly comforted in himselfe, and gaue God hearty praise, and thankes, for sending consolation in such hopelesse extremitie. But as the musition neither strayneth the string of his instrument too high for feare of breaking, nor letteth it too lowe for feare of bistuninge: So God still kéepeth a meane, nei∣ther suffering men to be careleslie secure, nor driuing them for want of comfort to despaire. After this, the Gouernour of the Pynace came forth of her, and went vp into the Tower to bee an Eye-witnes of what had happened, and finding all things sufficient, and stronge for his procéeding, not∣withstanding this misfortune, he came downe chéer∣fully, and with a resolute heart to goe forward on his iourney, But many of his friendes both learned Preachers, and others went about to disswade him from this aduenturous enterprise: Alleaging his attempt too venturous, his purpose dangerous; and his presumption egregious, and to be a great sinne in tempting the mercie of God in so strange and vnhearde-of manner of boldenesse. WHO sodainelye made answeare that this president being so wonderfull, and beyonde hope, did more en∣courage and anymate his procéedinges, than a∣ny mans perswasions could possiblye preuayle to the contrarie: For now hée felt the helping hand
of his mercifull God to bée readye to assist him in all his actions, especially in this his iourney: So in the name of God hée ascended vp to the battle∣mentes of the Tower in the Pynace, where stan∣ding vp hée turned himselfe to salute all his friends, and taking them all by the handes, hee sat downe in the Pynace, and by his owne industrie, and labour let himselfe downe by degrées to the ground to the ioye and wonder of all the beholders. At the lower end of the ropes were the wheeles, and diuers other Engyns, prouided for his trauell by Land, readye attending his comming downe: On which whéeles after some little time hée pla∣ced the Pynace; and all their other Engyns in their seuerall places; and sitting in her, made her passe too and fro in the church-yarde, as well to sée that all things should be fit, and well appoin∣ted for his trauell, as to content the people that stoode desirous to sée the rest performed of that no∣uell aduenture: From thence hée proceeded to the place from whence shee came in the morning, be∣ing partlye in his waye to London, yet that small part of his iourney did more vexe and trouble him, than a whole dayes trauell in the rest of his voyage, by reason of the multitude of people, that did so followe, and pester him, and the deepenesse and straightnesse of the way that did so excéedingly hin∣der him, that hée was constrained to rest the hbest part of the next day from the trauelling any fur∣ther. Thus although his beginninges aswell in respect of the former mishappe, and vnexpected ac∣cident, the vnrulye concourse of the common people, and the badnesse of the way, were very combersome and might haue ministred much cause of discourage∣ment, yet his resolutions were so setled, and his hopes so fully bent vppon gods helpe in those his businesses,
that his procedings proued excéeding prosperous, and the end was concluded with the fulnes of all content and expectation both of himselfe, and all his welwil∣lers; as appeares by his further progresse in the same. Upon Wednesday the two and twentieth of Iuly, betwéene the houres of foure and fiue of the clocke in the after noone, this gentleman enterprised by degrées to make prosecution of his trauell, which notwith∣standing it was laboursome vnto him, yet séem'd it swéete and pleasing in that his mind was led with a desire, and delight to sée the performance and executi∣on of the same; for a firme hope and assurance of those things we loue, and labour to bring to passe, alwaies causeth delight: Spes alit agricolas: Hope nourisheth the Country-men. The hope of gayne causeth the la∣bouring husbandman, not to féele the scorching heate of the summer, nor the hoary frosts of winter. Hope of glorye enritcheth the Souldiour with a certaine swéetnes in all his dangerous encounters: and the Marchant, although he lye tossed with billowes, and tempest-shaken in the middest of the Ocean, yet is he made merrie at mid-night with the hope of Lucre. He that is mooued with delight in this matter of hope exactly declares his certaine confidence of apprehen∣ding the subiect of his hope, & the vndoubted grounds, and probable securitie of obtayning the thinges ex∣pected. So fared it with this Traueller, who moued with this passion of hope, or rather certaine perswasion of his prosperours procéeding, beganne now to addresse himselfe to the apt disposing of his Pynace, and to the making of her goe vpon the maine land, and so tra∣uelled from Church Lamborne, to Vp-Lamborne, bée∣ing by iudgement and estimation some quarter of a myle distant the one from the other. In euery Vertue,
there is a lowe degrée, a meane, and an Excellent: There be beginners, goers forward, and perfect, In∣cipientes, perficientes, & perfecti: In euery vertue there is a supreame Excellencie, rare, singuler, and admirable, as in Fortitude, apert perills of death, in Prudence, present Resolutions, &c. which degries this pratitioner had brought to such perfection in his Arte, that he effected the same to the great commen∣dation of his Vertue, and the déepe contentment of all the beholders. And about seuen of the clocke in the euening of this same day, he ceased from his labour for that time, and the next day following being Thursday he there rested, and tooke his repose. For▪ —inter iecta vigorem for requies, reparant tempestius atia vires. Uppon fryday being the 24. day of Iuly betwéene the howers of thrée and foure of the clocke in the af∣ternooone, he began to trauell with his boate from Vp-Lamborne▪ where he had well rested, and refresht his wearines, vp an excéeding high hill towardes Chil∣derie downes, which he could very hardly attayne the top of, but with great enforcement of paines, and la∣bour. And then descended into the next vallye, The passage to which hée found to be so easie, that he was thereby encouraged to attempte the climing to the top of the next hlll, béeing farre higher, and stéeper than the first, but that proued so difficult, and full of toyle to him in the trauell, that it was full night be∣fore he could attanie to the top thereof; and his bones were so ouerwearied, and grieued with the extremity of that labor, That hauing then trauelled a Mile, and an halfe he was there constrained to rest and to pro∣céed no further, but to put a déepe crosse into the earth, where hee left his boate, and some people with her there that right, and hee with diuers others returned to Lmbborne where he rested.
Upon Saterday the fiue and twentieth of Iulye betwéene the houres of seauen and eight a clocke in the morning, hee beganne to procéede forward on his Iourney, and trauelled from the foresaid Crosse on Childerie Downes to the lodge of the right worship∣full Sir Edmond Fetiplace, being from thence distant some two miles and an halfe, and there by reason of the tempestuous weather, as extremitie of Lightning, Thunder, and Raine, he was constrayned to rest from passing any further, and there being about the houres of Two and Thrée of the clocke in the afternoone, hée ceased and left of to labor. The rayne hauing falne so wonderfully fast, that the Pynace (had shee béene from the whéels) might haue swome vpon the downs, for (the shower being ended) there was in her by esti∣mation fortie gallons of water. At that place he res∣ted the next day béeing Sunday. Munday the seauen and Twentie day of Iuly. If any man should inquire why the Vyne so loueth the Elme by nature that it wrappeth more kindely about it, and bringeth forth more plentie and better Grapes, then planted at the roote of any other Trée, no other reason questionles could be giuen, than a cer∣taine secret simpathye of naturé, a proportionate a∣gréeablenesse, and naturall conueniencye. If any should demaund, why this traueller hath so bended his studies and indeauours in this Art, séeing there is such perill, both in the proofe and practise, I thinke no better reason can be yealded than this, that if pro∣céedeth from a certaine loue he hath therevnto, groun∣ded vpon the agréeablenesse, and concordance with his Nature: For neither feares, misfortunes, nor bad weather, or tempests could disanimate or deterre him from his further procéedings, but that as before, so
vpon Munday being the Seuen and Twentieth day of Iuly betwéene Seauen and eight of the clocke in the forenoone, taking time by the forehead, and de∣sirous not to be idle, but alwaies in action, hée began to trauell from Sir Edmond Ferryplace his lodge, but by reason of the multitude of people that in a distrac∣ted desire, came and followed him to behold this vn∣heard of manner of trauelling, which was a thing so incredible & strange vnto them, That a Pynace should passe ouer the the toppe of the downes, he was in some sort by the peoples importunitie, enforced to rest and remaine here thrée houres after he had trauelled thrée miles. Héere Vertue was encouraged by the vulgar sort, as it was remembred by the better, for euery one that had béene Spectator of this strange enterprice, caused such sustenance to be brought vnto him, as either that place or their store and prouision could afford him, and that in such timely manner, that as a showre of raine after a long droughte is more woorth than tenne showers another time: and money lent to a Marchant falling Banckrupt to vpholde his credit, may bee acounted so much money giuen: So the same was the more pleasing and acceptable vnto him, in that it was so néedefull by reason of the greatnesse of his former labour and trauell. Af∣ter he had well receaued, and refreshed himselfe with such prouision as they had plentifully bestowed vpon him, he addrest his course towardes Catimslow hill, being about a mile from the place hee thus rested at, and there tooke his repose that night, hauing trauel∣led fiue mile the same day. The next morning being Tuesday, the eight and twentie day of Iulie, betweene the houres of nine and ten of the clocke in the fore noone, he desisted not to goe forward▪ and proceeded in his wearisome iour∣ney,
finding it now very painefull, and irksome vnto him, as well by reason of the extremity of the hotte weather, as by meanes of the infinite company of people, which gréedelie followed after him in such great troupes, being two miles from any Towne, or Uillage, that he was almost stifled, and pestered for want of ayre, for notwithstanding he himselfe ma∣ny times intreated them to forbeare, yet neither hée, nor all his friends or follewers could preuaile, or per∣swade them to refraine from pressing so néere him, & the boate. So incapable oftentimes are the actions of the common multitude, either sence, order, or mea∣sure: but that for the most part, they more earnestly pursue that which they are must forbidden and desi∣red to leaue. According to that, Nitimur inuetitum, semper cupimus{que} negatum. About two of the clocke in the afternoone, by a sini∣ster accident and misfortune, the chiefest key of his worke brake sodenly, by which the Pynace was gui∣ded, and gouerned: by reason whereof, he was forst to cease going forward any further, hauing not tra∣uailed aboue a mile that day. Upon Wednesday the nine and twentith of Iulie, betwéene the houres of nine and tenne of the clocke in the morning, after the yron engine was mended, the day before was broken, he began to proceede on his iourney, from Cutchinglow hill vpon the downes with as much spéede as he might. And after hee had trauelled almost three miles be practised in his boate, The concealed Arte for swift speed in running. Which he performed with inexpected admiratiō, for in twelue score, he outran all the people twentie yardes, being of men, women and clildren, to the number of fiue hundred. This day he trauailed further to Alse worth Parish, to a place called Harberts lodge, where per∣force he was constrayned to rest, by reason that the
engine so lately mended, was newlie broken againe, about foure of the clocke in the afternoone, hauing trauailed that day sixe miles, and better. This day he passed the highest and steepest hill, that was in all his iourney, being from the foote to the toppe thereof, by estimation a long mile. Thursday the thirtieth of Iulie. ARistotle (Eth: 2. Cap. 3.) reduceth all our moti∣ons of the minde, to Pleasure, and Paine: For as we see (saith he) there is no wickednesse but men will attempt for Pleasures: So we trie many to be deter∣red from the studie of Uertue onlie for the feare of Paine. Some other moderne Philosophers (ayming almost at the same marke) distinguish in generall, All Affections into two Members, (that is) Some consist in procuring, and prosecuting some good thing, either pleasant, or profitable vnto them. Others, in flying or eschuing some ill thing that might annoy them: They aymed (I say) both almost at one marke, be∣cause who prosecuteth anye matter that conduceth to his nature, receaueth thereby pleasure; So hee that shunneth any thing disagréeing to nature, shunneth consequently Paine. With these diuisions consent the proceedings of this Traueller, who pro∣secuting with all vehemencie his motions of minde, and affections of Desire, and Hope, was strengthned, and encouraged to attempt any difficulties, and was not disanimated by any paine, to prosecute the end of his profit, and pleasure. Insomuch that vpon Thursday the thirtieth of Iu∣lie, betwéene the houres of nyne and ten of the clocke in the forenoone, after the remending of the said En∣gine of yron this industrious gentleman no waye va∣riable in his resolution, or swaruing any whit from
his determinate purpose, addrest himselfe and his course from Harberts lodge, to a place called Streatly, being some two miles distant from the lodge, To which place he came about twelue of the clocke of the same day, where he rested that day, and the day fol∣lowing béeing Frydaye, onely to calke, pitche, and trimme his Pynace, because shée was so maruellously shaken by the long and weari-some iourney she made vpon the land: Launching her foorthwith into the water, to make tryall whether (without further repa∣ration) shée was able to indure her trauell vppon the Water: which vpon search hee found so sufficient, as that her former shaking by Land, had not much hurt, or annoyd her. Upon Saterday beeing the first of August, about twelue of the Clocke, this Gentle-man intended to commit both himselfe, and his Pynace to the mercie of the water, and very earely in the morning pre∣pared diuers great waights, and put them into her, so by the greatnes of the waights caused the Pynace to sinke vnder the water, to enable her by the swel∣ling of the Timber and planckes to defend any breach that might happen by her going vpon the wa∣ter in that iourney, and that with more speede and safetie hee might ariue at the end of his determined voiage: being in good hope he should receiue lesse da∣mage vpon the water then he had sustained vpon the land. This done, he thought himselfe in such securi∣ty as if he did in Portu nauigare. But it fell out cleane contrary; for a company of rude persons, béeing Bargemen, (a kinde of people by nature, and educa∣tion immoderate, barbarous, and vnciuil) wading in the water to the Pynace, with great violence ha∣led, and pulled her vp and downe, as if they inten∣ded nothing else but to haue shaken her asunder. Which when the Commander of her heard of, and
perceiued, with what kind and milde speeches and intreaties as hee could, hee perswaded them to disist from their rude and vnciuill manner of behauiour. But all preuailed not, they were so farre from lea∣uing of to continue these wrongs and iniuries, as they returned vild and vnciuill spéeches to the Gen∣tleman: and not contented with that, their company increased to the number of tenne, or twelue persons, all Bargemen, some with long Pike staues, some with long hookes, and other weapons, and barbarous∣ly assaulted this distressed Uoyager, hauing but two men with him, attendants in his company, who were both grieuously wounded and hurt in their heades & other places, by these ryotous persons: for all this these rude fellowes were not satisfied, neither for the abuse offered to himselfe, nor the hurtes done to his men, but they manifested their further cankred sto∣macks and malice, (after the hurt men were retyred into their lodgings, for safegard of their liues) and went vnto the Pynace where they had left her, and with great stones, hookt staues, and other weapons, maliciously rent and spoiled her, and beat great holes through her, not forbearing to continue this violence and out-rage, vntill they thought they had sufficient∣ly torne her for trauailing any more, either by land or water. Thus to be led by the brain-sick resoluti∣ons of idle humors, & to follow the multitude, (which the Philospher termeth to be Monstrū multorum Ca∣pitum, A Monster with many heades) is but to de∣light in sturbance, to take pleasure in doing iniuries, and to heape one mischiefe on the necke of another. This was a great ouerthrow, and hinderance to this Trauellers voyage, and might haue béene his vtter vndoing, if their diuellish purposes had taken their full effects: for by this misfortune he was con∣strained to stay at Streatley, Satterday, Sunday, and
part of Munday, as well to cure and recouer his men, as to mend & repaire his boate; which (God be than∣ked) were both reasonably well performed by the Munday following: so that by this time his men were somewhat recouered, and inabled in the after∣noone to passe in a boat which he had hired of purpose, to carry them some foure miles a day, as they were able to endure the ayre, with drummes and sortes of Musicke, by which both himselfe, and his men recei∣ued much consolation and comfort. The first, second, or last occasions of feare did not cause him to distrust of hopefull end: but as a wise ship-master when hee setteth foorth from the shoarer and goeth to Sea, laying aside the remembrance of wife, children, house, and familie, imployeth his body and minde only to the due performance of his shippe to a gainefull hauen: So notwithstanding all dan∣gers that befell him, either by misfortune or disorder, he patiently vnder went them, and still carried his minde and intendments ready and prepared to doe their best to bring his busines to happy and succesfull conclusion: And so vpon Monday being the third of August betwéene the houres of one and twoo of the clocke in the afternoone, he began to trauell by water at the place where hee left the Thursday at his com∣ming thither, for his Pynace was water-borne being vpon whéeles, as shée trauelled vpon the land: From thence hée directed his course from Streatley to Pang∣bornelocke, béeing distant from Streatley by wa∣ter foure miles: And comming thither about sixe of the clocke, rested there that day. Uppon Tuesday béeing the fourth of August bée∣tweene the houres of eight and nine of the clocke in the afternoone he proceeded forward on his Iourney, and passed from the place where hee left the night be∣fore, ouer the banckes of the said Locke vppon his
whéeles into the water on the other side of the locke, vntill hee was water-borne, and then hee cast the whéeles with other deuises from him, and so beeing cleare in the water, rowed with his oares, going soft∣ly forward vntill hee came to Maple Dirrham-locke, bing distant from Pangbornelock, some thrée miles, where he came a shoare in his boat againe, vpon the whéeles, and passed through a long Wood wharfe, there by land a very deepe and troublesome passage, which was so painefull by reason of the bad way, and the extremitie of heat, that the people (beeing very many of the better sort, pittied him much, and were greatly sorry for his painefull labor. All which hee did by his owne toyle and industry: and yet not so re∣lying vpon his Art, but that hee ascribed the meanes to Gods will and pleasure, without which hee could not haue done any thing. Two things therefore are wished to be increased in men of his Profession: the first is, the true feare of God, & then a carefull diligēce in all things belonging to their Arte; where the feare of God is not, no arte can serue the turne, for that were to make of arte an Idole; yet those that feare God, must take héed they tempt him not: they ought therefore to vse arte as the meanes that God hath ordayned for their benefite, and be thankfull. After he had rested himselfe about two houres, and well recreated and refresht his body at Sir Michael Bluntes, he prepared to proceed forward passing in the boate vpon the whéeles below the locke into the wa∣ter, and when she was water-borne againe, hee cast the whéeles from him, and passed forwarde with his Dares towards Reading-locke. Unto which place be¦fore he came, he might discry a far off a whole army of people, vpon Causum-bridge,  vpon the banks of the riuer, which followed the Pynace with her drumms and musicke, vntill shee came to the Locke. There
might you haue séene the number of the people double encreased, and the Trauailer with diuers Gentle∣men, and others in his company (all strangers) very kindly receiued and entertained by Knights, Ladyes, Esquiers, and sundry persons of the best rancke and fashion, to the number of two thousand people and vp-ward, of men women, and children, beeing halfe a Mile from the towne, whether with great paines the Pynace was brought, and placed in the Kings forge at the Pryorie: and such as were in the Trauailers company passed into the town, comming thither about sixe of the clocke, and rested there, ha∣uing trauialed that day eight miles. Upon Wednesday beeing the fifth of August, betwene the houres of ten and eleuen of the clocke in the fore-noone, he conuayed his Pynace as priuily as might be to the water, to auoyde and beguild the presse of people, beeing then dinner time: at which time he thought that people would haue least minde to looke after his procéeding. Notwithstanding vpon the least newes of his departure muttured, the people instantly increased, and flocked together in greater troopes and abundance, then were there the day be∣fore, with their drums & seuerall instruments musick, of aswell to shew their owne gladnesse and content of mind, as to adde comfort to the Trauailer, for Mu∣sicke doth iubilate the heart with pleasure, excites and stirs vp humors and inuites so magnanimity: and no other cause can bee yeiled then this, that betwixt mens hearts and musicke, there is a certaine sympha∣tie, correspondencie, and proportion. Who can giue any other reason why the Loadstone draweth yron, but a sympathy of Nature? why the needle touched but with such a stone, should neuer leaue looking to∣ward the North-pole? who can remember other rea∣son then Simpathie of nature? So wee may say, that
such is the nature of mens mindes, as musicke hath a certaine proportionate Simpathye with them: As our tastes haue with varietie of daintie cates: our smelling with varietie of odours, &c. But not to insist vpon this, they followed (I say) this traueller all a∣long vpon the shore, a mile and better vpon Sunning-Locke, where (but that God miraculously protected, and defend him) both the Pynace and hee in her had béene cast away and drowned: for vnaduisebly by the counsell of a Miller he presumed to shut a narrow straight, which had a great fall ioyning to the Locke: where a stumpe had almost ouer whelmed the Py∣nace, but shée escaped that danger, onely receauing some quantity of water néere about thrée or foure gal∣lons. About foure, or fiue of the clocke in the after∣noone he came to Sunning, where by diuers people of the better sort and condition with him and his compa∣nye were verie kindlye entertained. There hee res∣ted that night, casting in his minde, how he might escape the like troublesome lockes and dangers. Upon Wednesday being the sixt of August, be∣twéene the houres of ten and eleauen of the clocke in the forenoone, he prepared his Pynace to trauell vpon her whéeles by land to Maydenhead, vnderstan∣ding it to be thithér thirtie miles by water, and but eight miles by land, besides many dangerous lockes which might put him in great hazard: so he procee∣ded to trauell by land to Twyford, but had not passed halfe a mile, when the maine Exe of the pron-worke brake: by reason whereof, he could passe no further then Twyford, for it was foure houres before it could be mended againe: So there he rested that night, com∣ming thither about six of the clocke. These crosses and impediments would haue wea∣ried many, & mooued them to discontentment as well for the often exercising of one thing which ength
satiety, and for that by nature men affect to bee vari∣ous: As for that also they found such discouragements in the estate and condition of the exercise and busines which they had in hand: yet these could not set warre and battell in his thoughts, or hinder the progresse of his intendments. But that on Friday being the sea∣uenth of August, betwéene the houres of nine and ten of the clocke in the forenoone, he began to procéed and goe forward on hís painefull iourney, which he found to be full of taile and labour, by reason of the déepe∣nesse of the sand, which caused the Pynace to trauell very sadde and heauilie. That day she trauailed to little Weeke, in Maydenhead thicket, being distant from Twyford foure miles, and there rested about six of the clocke. Upon Saturday the eight of August, betwéene the houres of nine and ten of the clocke that day, he tra∣uelled from little Weeke in the Thicket aforesaid, to Maydenhead: Through which Towne, he endured the most painefull toyle and trauell, that he had in all his iourney, by reason of the déepenesse of the myre in the stréete, wherein the whéeles pierced a foot déepe at the least: and so forward to Maydenhead Bridge, ouer the Thames. Into which Riuer he passed with his whéeles, vntill he was water-borne, where hée purposed to procéede on his iourney on Monday fol∣lowing: So for that day he returned to Maydenhead about foure of the clocke, hauing trauailed the same day some three miles, and there rested he that night, and the next day being the Saboth day. Upon Monday, being the tenth of August, betwéen the houres of nine and ten in the morning, he began to trauell from Maydenhead Bridge by water, to which place hee came from Maydenhead vppon his wheeles, being intreated by diuers Knights and Es∣quires, that were there assembled, that they might sée
the manner of his trauell by land, which after they had fully viewed at their pleasure, hee tooke off hee wheeles, and lanched her at the place where the was water-borne the Saturday before vpon her wheeles: and so passed by water to Winfor, and there stayed to refresh himselfe two houres, and from thence rowed to Staynes with his oares attending him, hauing a set of loude Instruments of musike in them, from May∣denhead to London, to doe him comfort and encou∣ragement in his iourney. And hauing trauailed eigh∣teene miles this day, hee rested at night at Staynes, comming thither about six of the clocke. Upon Thursday being the eleauenth of August, betweene the houres of six and seauen of the clocke that morning, he began to proceed forward towards Kingstone, and arriued there betwéene 10 and 11 of the clocke the same forenoone, Notwithstanding hée staied at Hamptō Court halfe an hower by the intrea∣tie of Sir Charles Manners, where he refresht himself: So by estimation hee rowed his Pynace aboue fiue miles an hower, for foure houres together: by which the watermen were brought into a wonderous dis∣traction, and admiration, one while conceiuing the best of it; another while the worst: Sometimes thin∣king it might be done by art and cunning; and some∣times againe, iudging it a thing impossible: So as the earth being vnmanured, bringeth forth brambles, and briers, with many stincking wéedes; and manu∣red also, springeth forth here and there darnell, and cockle; Euen so their vnderstandings were so ill gui∣ded, that sometimes they did not onely yeild vaine i∣maginations, but in the middest of their best conceits, many times vniust surmises, and impertinent distrac∣tions. Hee staied at Kingston thrée houres, and from thence passed to Braineford, he landed at maister Har∣rions keye there dwelling, and rested there Wednes∣day,
and Thursday, comming thither about 5 of the clocke in the after-noone, and hauing rowed that day thirtie miles. Upon Thursday being the 13. of August betwéene the houres of seauen and eight of the clocke in the e∣uening, he priuately bended his course towards Lon∣don, onely with one paire of oares in his company to carry sufficient witnesses of his landing at the Cus∣tome-house Key, leauing his musitions, and the rest of his company behind him, doubting the multitude of boates, and people might much annoy him, if hee should attempt to land there by day. So betwéene the houres of 12 and 1 of the clocke that night he landed at the Custome-house Key, in the presence of 4 of the kings seruants of the Custome-house, and diuers other witnesses that saw the whole performing of the iour∣ney, and came with him thither. From thence he returned againe to Braineford with his Pynace, and there landed by 4 of the clocke in the morning intending to prepare his Pynac and his company in some better fashion, vnderstanding the peoples expectation of his comming to London, and of his landing at the Custome house Keye, which had béene performed againe, but for the misbehauiour, and vnrulynes of the boates, that with such a multi∣tude and throng prest so néere the Pynace, that shée could not any way haue frée passage. The most part of Frydaye, Saterday, and Mun∣day he spent in painting and rigging her with masts, yardes, Sailes, Flagges, Ancients Streamers, and pendents: And all other prouision for her ordinance, and fyer workes, in as laudable a sort, and fashion, as for a ship of greater burthen: which the knightes,
Ladies, and gentlemen néere Braineford, and all sorts of the common people, rounde about that place, hearing, and vnderstanding of, resorted thither vp∣pon the Mondaye, expecting the Pynace shoulde that day haue departed, but shee intended not to proceede till the morrowe following. Then the better sorte intreated the commaunder of her to do them that especiall fauour that they might see the manner of his trauell both by Land and Water: which request made by so worthy personages, hee willingly subscribed to, and with all expedition pla∣ced the Pynace on her wheeles, and brought her from whence shée stoode priuate, into a large Court, where there stoode priuate so many Coaches, and the great gates were so lowe, as shée could not that waye haue passage into the stréete, But another waye béeing found by which shee was brought foorth, there wanted no Spectators to attend her comming, but the streete was full of people, and most of the better sorte, for there were two hun∣dreth knights. Ladyes, and Gentlemen, who ha∣uing seene the Pynace passe by Lande, desired also that they might see her swymme on the wa∣ter: This was likewise graunted by the tra∣ueller. And they all satisfied to their full contents and pleasure. Uppon Tuesday beeing the Nyneteenth of Au∣gust betweene the howres of Foure and Fiue of the clocke in the morning, the Pynace was brought and launched into the water, and passed forwardes towardes LONDON, with Drummes, and lowde Instruments of Musicke, shooting off her ordinance at her departure from Brayneforde:
Shée came before Westminster betwéene 7 and 8 a clocke in the morning, which beeing discried a farre of, there came such a multitude of all sortes of boates, that neither shée, nor any of her company could rowe, or stirre any way, by reason of their rude thrusting vpon her: So shée was constrayned to presse by all meanes shée could to Sumerset Court at the wall, not beeing able to come néere the staires, at which place she was drawne vp by roapes with force of men, and by them carried into a house in the Strande, where we now leaue her vntill her further procéedings. Upon Wednesday being the ninetéenth of August, betwéene the houres of ten and eleauen of the clocke in the forenoone, the commaunder of the foresaid Py∣nace shap't his course to the Custome-house of the Ci∣tie of London, with diuers witnesses for the perfor∣mance of his iourney with him. Who in the presence of the Customer, Controller, and Surueyor there, did of¦fer to make oath of the performance of the voyage, in∣treating a certificate of what he had effected: which was willingly granted, & deliuered vnder these Offi∣cers hands, and seales. And he himself very kindly entertayned by all the officers, and feasted at the Customers house and all his company. FINIS.
