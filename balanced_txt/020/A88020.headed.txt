A Letter sent to His MAJESTY: by an Honourable Member of the House of COMMONS. SIR, BY necessary Perswasion and inducement on the behalfe of my selfe & the other your faithfull subjects members of your house of Commons accused of high Treason: I am forced to informe your Majesty of the integrity of our affections and innocency of our proceeding, in the great affaires of this Common wealth wherein we have bin imployed by your Majesty. Besides our sorowes (which pressed us very sore and still remaineth upon us) the troubles and griefe that fell upon us, for the lamentable breaches in Church and State, and so your sacreed Majesty and hopefull off∣spring filled up our sorrowes and in our thoughts were
grieved that such feares and desolations fell out in your dayes, we confesse that charity suspects not, and the best minds thinke the least hurt, and the freer a man is from vice in himselfe, the more charitable he is of others, and this is that which hath proved prejudicall to your Ma∣jesty, but had your MAJESTIE bin the first that had bin misinformed, or ill rewarded it would be an hard thing to command patience, but griefe is asweged by presidents or examples. Jt is true your Majesty be∣ing misinformed against us your faithfull servants and subjects, your Majesty thought to have dealt with us, as Joseph thought to have dealt with Mary, and so put them a way farr from you, but with Mary they travil∣led as it were with child, and that which they traviled withall might not appeare an illegtinate the only wise God sent as it were an Angell unto you, to let you see that like Mary they being contracted unto you in love they have not as yet defiled their marriage bed, but re∣maine like Mary faithfull to their head and Soveraigne; And your Majesty seduced by false oppinions from o∣thers against them, we hope you will be now reduced to them by true perswasions; and that you may be soe the only wise God, that gave your Majesty your being, and so knew you better then your selfe, hath dealt with your Majesty as he did with Adam in Paradise, provid∣ed you a meete helper, when with Adam you thought
we need of it; And if your Majesty yeeld as Adam did in sparing a superfluous rib, will becom a great gainer, for your Majesty shall not only loose those who may ve∣ry well be spared, but you will gaine to your selfe and posterity a meete helper, that will endeavour by all meanes that may be lawfull to ease you of the many burthens that lye heavy upon you, and considering the paines of that body whereof you are the head, great in∣justice is done them by accusing them; for by this me∣anes your good subjects are bereaved of those benifits that ought to be common to all: As for your Com∣mons, they goe not about to steale your favour, but purchase them legally, and are become unto you as Abrahams servant was unto his Mr. who would not ei∣ther eate or drinke, untill he had done his Masters bu∣sinesse; And J dare say if your Commons (as the late menopolits and others did seeke themselves or their owne advantages more then the good of King & King∣dome, they would have bin received after so much la∣bour before now, but we say as Adam and let us be but one and that it might have bin so we have bin willing to be seperated from our demesticke imployments, yea, to forsake all and runn through many hazards and per∣ilous dangers to cleave onely to your Majesty in a so∣emne contract, therefore to make up the contract you must part with your evill Councellors that are neere un∣to
you and spare a part to save the rest, being done it will prove to your Majesty as comfortable and welcom as Rebeckca was in Isaakes tent. This happie match being made, it would not only refresh your people but make glad your hearts in these tims of feares & dangers, it is the nighest way to a blessing, and the hopes of this is that which hath brought us to renew and con∣firme the Covenant that your Majesty made with us; from your first entrance to the Crown, and because you could not sweare by no greater, swore by the Eternall God that you would defend us, and at the first of our contract we made but one, your power and all that you had was ours to defend us; and do us good; But those now neere you and about you have set your Majesty a∣gainst us, and perswade you to beat us, and force us to obedience; though of our selves willing to obey: being fore troubled within our selves, when we see your your Majesty (whoe is become our head and husband) strange unto us, but wee hope these unnaturall breaches being composed and reconciled love will be united stronger then before, wherefore be reconciled to your Commons and to us your faithfull and Loyall servants shall live love and dye togather and be more firme in your new unian then ever devided in your heart un∣kindnesses so shall you meete in the end and new Por but be like Rachell and Leah which two built up th
house of Israell, we have endeavoured to put you in a∣way to unity now you are in the way keepe it, it is said that whylest Abraham servant was in in the way God blessed him, the same God blesse your Majesty and for your comfort and incouragement know by somuch that you grow to perfection by how much you draw nere to unity we confesse had the baules and baulums of our times beene so evill as they would have bine the world had bene overcome with evill but such is the wisdome of God that offtimes he hides from evill men those times and seasons that might prove prejudicicall to his People, but we have seene and felt, both great in∣ward sorrow and outward perplexity that by the meanes of our baalems your Majesty is become to your People and commons as the Angell are unto Gideon and so made them afraid, but we humbly and earnestly desire your Majesty to recomfort your People by retur∣ning to the wholesome concell of your Parliament, and injoy them againe by a willing contract and not by ra¦vishment, we shall you appeace unto your your People like moses who had more glory by his vaile then by his face and we doubt not but when all things thus be made manifest, and the integrity and innocency of our proceedings rightly understood by your Majesty, but that one faithfull david will be in more accompt with your Majesty then all the Pharasites and Atchittophells
of your campe, for our plaine conditions we doubt  but the effect of our endeavoures will make it appear to all the world (to the Conunceing or confusion o our malitions enemies, who are no otherwise to you Majesty if they might be onceased) and satisfaction o your M. that we have aimed at nothing but the vvord of God in defending his true Religion your Majestie person and posteritie from force and violence, and the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, and just prero∣gatives of the Crowne from distraction.
