TO My loving Neighbours and Christian Friends, at FORDHAM. Brethren, MY hearts desire and request unto God for you is, that yee may bee saved: I say the truth in Christ also, I lye not, my conscience bearing mee witnesse in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heavinesse, and continuall sorrow in my heart, for them amongst you, who as yet walk disorderly, and not as beseemeth the Gospel, little labouring to acquaint them∣selves with the mystery of godlinesse; for ma∣ny walk, of whom I have told you often weep∣ing, and now tell you again with sorrow, that they are the enemies of the crosse of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their
belly, who minde earthly things. You know (Brethren) how I have been amongst you, and in what manner, for these two yeers past; and how I have kept back nothing (to the utmost of the dispensation to mee committed) that was profitable unto you; but have shewed you and taught you, publickly, and from house to house, testifying to all, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lor Jesus Christ. Now with what sincerity this hath bin by mee performed; with what issue and suc∣cesse by you received, God the righteous Judge will one day declare; for before him, must both you, and I appear, to give an account of the dispensation of the glorious Gospel amongst us: in the mean while, the desire of my heart is, to bee srvant to the least of you in the work of the Lord. And that in any way, which I can conceive profitable unto you either in your persons or your families. Now amongst my indevours in this kinde, after the Ordi∣nance of publick Preaching the Word, there is not, I conceive, any more needfull, (as all will grant that know the estate of this place, how taught of late dayes, how full of grossely igno∣rant
persons) then Catechising, which hath caused me to set aside some houres for the com∣piling of these following, which also I have procured to bee Printed meerly because the least part of the Parish are able to read it in writing, my intention in them being, principally, to hold out those necessary truths, wherein you have been in my Preaching more fully in∣structed: as they are, the use of them I shall briefly present unto you. 1. The lesser Catechisme may bee so learned of the younger sort, that they may bee ready to answer to every question thereof. 2. The greater will call to minde much of what hath been taught you in publick, especial∣ly concerning the person a Offices of Jesus Christ. 3. Out of that you may have help to instruct your families in the lesser, being so framed for the most part, that a Chapter of the one, is spent in unfolding a question of the other. 4. The texts of Scripture quoted, are dli∣gently to bee sought out and pondered, that you may know indeed whether these things are so. 5. In eading the Word, you may have light
into the meaning of many places, by conside∣ring what they are here produced to confirme. 6. I have been sparing in the doctrine of the Sacraments, because I have already been so frequent in examinations about them. 7. The handling of morall duties I have wholly omitted, because by Gods assistance I in∣tend for you a briefe explication of the Lords Prayer, and the ten Commandements, with some Articles of the Creed, not unfolded in these, by themselves, by the way of Question and Answer. Now in all this as the paines hath been mine, so I pray that the benefit may bee yours▪ and the praise his, to whom alone any good, that is in this or any thing else, is to bee ascribed. Now the God of heaven continue that peace, love, and amity amongst our selves, which hitherto hath ben unshaken, in these divided times, and grant that the Scepter and Kingdome of his Son may bee gloriously advanced in your hearts, that the things which concern your peace, may not bee hidden from your eyes in this your day: which is the daily prayer of From my Study, Septem. the last, Your servant in the work of the Lord, J.O.
