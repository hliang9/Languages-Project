Die Martis, 9. Feb: 1640. VVHereas complaint hath beene made un∣to us by Iames Lord Arch-Bishop of Ar∣magh, and Primate of all Ireland, that a certaine Pamphlet hath been lately most injuriously fa∣thered upon him and spread abroad under the false title of The Bishop of Armaghs direction to the house of Parliament, concerning the Liturgie and Episcopall Governement. It is this day ordered in the Commons House of Parliament, that the Master and Companie of Stationers, and all others whom it may concerne, shall take such course for the suppressing of the said Booke, that they shall not suffer it to be put in print, or if it be already printed, not permit the same to be divulged. And if any man shall presume to print or publish the Booke above mentioned, That he or they shall be then lyable to the Cen∣sure of the said House. Elsynge Cler: Domus Com:
