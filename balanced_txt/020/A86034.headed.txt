The Epistle Dedicatory. TO THE Professors & Practisers Of the COMMON-LAW OF ENGLAND. Candid Reader. THis Tract in French, was bequeathed to me by an Alliance, William Glis∣son Esquire deceased, which I have transla∣ted into our own Language for the Com∣mon benefit of all. I am not singular in it, for daily experience manifests the contrary: neither is it a Novelty for Law-books to ap∣pear in this dresse. Antiquity may be plead∣d, Sr. Germin Perkins, Stanford, Cromp∣on, Lambert, Sr Henry Finch, Dalton, and di∣vers others have in former dayes troden this path. My desires are it may not be perused by those who read only to fault, what they
cannot mend, but by those whose judicious Pen will correct the errors as Cognizances of humane frailty, I wish it successful to all, be he Pleader or Practiser, and that the Common Law of England may shine forth in these Cloudy, and ecclipsed dayes is the prayer of him, who is A Well-Wisher to the Laws HEN.

The Proces against a Guardian in Soccage. 1. before appearance. 2. after appearance. The Process at common Law was but a di∣stresse infinite, Coke 3. parte 12. A. Herberts Case.

When he hath the Custody till such a day  from such a day, and accounts till the full agc of the Plaintif without that, that he was Guardian before or after, Lib. Intr. 21. cap. Sect. 2.

By the Common Law it was but a Levari fa∣cias  or fieri facias: Coke 3. part 12. A. Herberts Case. And this only within the year, for if the year passed he was put to his action of debt. If the Process were not continued, 33 Hen. 6. 49. pl. 33. Per Westm. 2. cap. 45. Scire facias is given after the year. Per Westm. Cap. 2. 18. Elegit is given, Coke 3. part. 12. A. Per Marlebridge Cap. 23. & Westm. 2. cap. 11. Capias was given in Process and by conse∣quence, Capias ad satisfaciendum: Coke 3. parte. 12. A. Per Westm. 2. cap. 11. If an Accountant be∣fore Auditors be found in Arrearages, he shall be by them committed to the next Goal in execution; but then they ought to commit him forthwith. Coke 8. parte. 119. b.

If one testifie his receipt by deed he cannot plead that he never was his receiver. 10 Edw▪ 3. 383. pl. 18. Defendant pleads that he is executor of B. and that he received the money as a debt of B.
this not good, because the Plantiff supposeth him his receiver; but ought to say, without that, that he received it as the money of the Plain∣tiff, 11 Hen. 4. 79. pl. 20. 13 Hen. 4. pl. 1.

The Defendant pleads the Receit by deed, and demands judgement of the Writ without shewing it, this is no plea to the Writ; because the Receit and not the dead is the cause of
Action, 1 Hen. 6. 8. 28 Hen. 8. Dyer 20. pl. 121. But the 9 Edw. 4. 50. B. per Choke contra. 2 Hen. 6. 9. quaere.

Pl. 32. for this drowns the contract: otherwayes he ought to plead this before Auditors. So if the Plaintiff grant, that if the Defendant pay 20 l. will withdraw his Action, a good Bar:

Quare Impedit against the Ordinary and B. the 6. moneths passe the plaintiff shall have double damages although the ordinary did not collate because he had jus conferendi and also a writ to the Bishop, 43 Edw. 3. 10. pl. 33.
The plaintiff recovers double damages be∣cause the 6 moneths were passed and also a writ to the Bishop and his Clerk instituted be∣cause the Bishop did not collate but this was not done by the party, 8 Edw. 3. 280. pl. 9.

But note, that this lies before any certifi∣cate made, that a Quare Impedit or darrein presentment is depending, Nat. br. 37. H. Yet the party grieved shall have a Writ to the chief Justice, to certifie if any writ be de∣pending, and if he certifie none, then a Su∣persedeas shall be awarded, Nat. br. 37. H. Note.

Quare non admisit. 11. Excommunication cannot be pleaded in the Plaintiff, because the Writ supposeth a contempt that the Plaintiff hath presented his Clerk in the Writ named after Judge∣ment; But a good plea that the Incumbent did not make request after Judgement, 21 Hen. 7. 71. pl. 14.

pleaded in Bar of the Avowry for corrody granted with distress, a good bar, 27 Edw. 3. 81. pl. 13. Seisin. When the Lord varies from the truth of the quantity of his services by reason of seisin, there he cannot traverse the seisin, Coke 9. part 33 A. Com. 94. B. Mantels case. But if they vary of the quantity by reason of seisin, there the seisin is traversable, Coke 9. part, 33. A. Bucknals case, Com. 94. B. Mantels case, 18 Edw. 2. Avowry 217. Not sei∣sed. Not seised generally a good Bar, for by this he shall have no remedy of the Lord, Coke 9. part 34. B. Bucknals case, 22 Hen. 6. 3 A. 30. Henry 6. Avowry 15. But if he avow and alleadg seisin by the hands of the Plaintiff or other, the Plaintiff shall say, never seised by his hands, Coke 9. part 35. A. Bucknals case, 22 Hen. 6. 3. A. The seisin is not traversable, but for that only for which the Avowry is made, Coke 9. part 35. A. Bucknals case, 26 Henry 8. 1. pl. 1. unless seisin be alleadged of a superior ser∣vice, as if tenure be alleadged per Homage fealty, and rent and avow for rent and sei∣sin in all, the seisin of the rent is only traver∣sable, Coke 9. part 34. A. But if it be of Homage, fealty, rent, and escuage, and avow for Homage, and alleadg seisin in all, there the seisin of escuage is tra∣versable, because this is seisin of all, Coke 9. part 34. A.

Not seised within 40 years a good bar, 32 Hen. 8, cap. 2. Coke 9 part. 36. Bucknalls case, 14 Eliz Dyer. 315. pl. 101. But he that pleads this ought first to con∣fesse a tenure to the intent that the Lord may have a writ of customes and services 15 Rich. 2. avowry 214. Coke 9 part. 34. B. Bucknalls case. But this is no plea in avoury for rent upon a grant or reservation by deed because the deed is the title, Coke 8 part. 65. A. Fosters case. Or upon a gift in Tayle because the com∣mencement is within the time of memory, Coke 8 part. 64. A. Fosters case, 4 part 11. A. Bevills case. Or if it be for casual services as homage, fe∣alty or to go to war because perchance it may not happen within 40 years, Coke 4 part. 10, 11. Bevills case. So if the Lord release to the tenant so long as A. hath heirs of his body because A. may have heirs a long time after, Coke 4 part. 11. A. Bevills case So if land be conveyed toa Mayor and com∣monality which was held by homage and feal∣ty which conveyes this over, this is no plea because the Mayor and communality cannot do homage or fealty, Coke 4 part. 11. A. Bevills case.
Seisin a∣voided in avowry. 1. The Issue in tayle shall avoid seisin by the hands of the tenant in tayle, Coke 9 part. 34. A. Bucknalls case, 34 Edw. 3. Avowry 131. But this is intended when the tenant makes a gift in Tayle remainder in fee, for the te∣nant in tayle shal himself avoid the encroach∣ment between, by the donor because he ought to shew the commencement of the reservati∣on, Coke 8 part. 65. A. Fosters case, 10. part. 108. Lofeilds case. 2 Successor of a Bishop shall avoid seisin be∣tween by the hands of the predecessor, Coke 9 part. 34.

Buck∣nalls case, vide 21. Edw. 4, 64, pl. 36, et fol. 84, pl. 3▪ Tenure. In avowry the seisin is traversable and not the tenure, Crooke, 13 Hen. 7, 31. B.
When the Lord varies in Avowing of the verity of the quantity of the services by co∣lour of seisin, the tenure shall be traver∣sed, Coke 9. part 33. A. Bucknals case, 10 Henry 7. 11. pl. 31. Com. 94. Mantels case, Crook 13. Hen. 7. 31 B. But then the tenant ought to confess the tenure in part, for he needs not traverse all the tenure, but may disclaim or plead out of his fee, Coke 9. part 35. A. Bucknals case, 10 Hen. 6. 6, 7. pl. 20. 37 Hen. 6. 25. pl. 13. 15 Rich. 2. Avowry 214. But note 11 Hen. 4. 10. pl. 2. the Tenant said, that the Avowant did give the Lordship to A. in tayl, the remainder to B. in tayl, A. dies without issue, B. yet living, there he needs not suffer▪ a Disclaymer, or plead out of his fee, but there fol. 7. pl. 40. he had judge∣ment of the Avowry and admitted. When they agree in the quantity of the services, and vary in the quantity of the Land, there the Plaintiff may traverse als∣que hoc, that he held modo & forma, or that he held one only, Coke 9. part 35.

part 35. A. & B. Bucknals case, 5 Henry 5. 4. 3. When one distrayns for fealty, rent, and sute, and alleadges seisin in all, and avows for rent, the Tenant may confess that he held by fealty and rent, and to the rent no∣thing arrear, without that that they held by fealty, rent, and sute, modo & forma, and good, and if upon issue joyned it be found, that he held by fealty and rent, and not sute, although that the Avowry be for rent, yet in so much that the tenure alleadged by the A∣vowant was traversed and found against him, Judgement shall be given against the Avow∣any, for in vain shall he make this traverse∣able, and yet that he should have the return when it is found against him, Coke 9. part 35, & 36. Bucknals case. Tender. Tender of Homage ought to be to the per∣son of the Lord, ubicunque fuerit infra reg∣num propter reverentiam, Bracton, Lib. 2. fol. 80. A. Judgement.

C. pleads he took them not, D. justifies in right of C. and found for him, yet he shall not have a re∣turn, 22 Hen. 6. 52. pl. 27. Defendant pleads property in another, and found so there, he shall have a return without an Avowry, for the Plaintiff had de∣liverance without cause, 39 Henry 6. 35. pl. 47. Prisott. One avows for rent at two daies, one is not come, the Plaintiff is non-suited; there shall be a return for one day, because he is not merely an Actor, per 4 Justices against 3.

Replevin, the Defendant prescribes to have all the Pasture of such a place in in W. except Common for the Inhabitants of D. and the prescription being tra∣versed, the Jury was of the Visne of W. only, and this was a good rule in Er∣ror, because the exception to the Inhabi∣tants of D. was voyd, therefore this was not in issue, Trin. 11 Iac. Ban. Regis, Wicker versus Stockeman. In waste.

Berks, the Defendant said that it was by Covyn, without this, that it was a good Ti∣tle,
the Plaintiff said that it was upon a good title, the Visne shal be of the County of Berks where the issue is joyned upon the good, Title, and where the Land lyes: but contrary if the issue be joyned upon the County, but it was said, if it were a personal Action it shall be where the Recovery is alleadged, Mich. 9 Iac.

Ban. Regis. Debt. Debt for 20 l. Defendant pleads that at a∣nother time, the Plaintiff sued him in Lon∣don in such a Parish and shews the Record certain, &c. and that he had exectution in a∣nother Parish, &c. the Plaintiff said that it was in debt for another 20 l. for the which execution was awarded absque hoc that the plaint and the execution was for the same 20 l. yet the Visne shall be in both pa∣rishes, because the issue is as well of the exe∣cution as of the plaint, 5.

the Tenant in Tayl, 3 Elizabethae, Dyer 188. pl. 9. But if he in reversion in Tayl disseises Tenant in Dower, and suffers an erroneous Recovery, and Tenant in Dower releases with warranty and dyes, this is a good Bar, Coke 3. part 60. 61. Lincolne Colledge case. A Release of one bars another, when two are to recover a personal thing, but when they are to discharge themselves it is otherwayes, Coke 6. part 25. Ruddocks case. Seisure.

Fine reversed for the Proclamations only, and yet remain good, for the other is but a Discontinuance, 4 Eliz. Dyer 216. pl. 54. Execution in Error. Lib. intra. 307. C. sect. 1. FINIS.
