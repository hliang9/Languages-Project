To the Honourable the COMMONS of ENGLAND in Parliament Assembled. The Second Humble Petition of Abel Carew an Excluded Door-keeper from this Honourable House, with a True Account of the Cause of the present Serjeants Acting against your Petitioner. Also a Description of the Serjeant's Power in refe∣rence to any Place belonging to this House: Humbly Sheweth, THAT whereas your Petitioner lately Petitioned your Honours, setting forth the Cause of his being Secluded the last Parlia∣ment by Serjeant Shoreditch of his wearing the Ribbon at Oxford with this Motto, No Slavery, No Popery. Your said Petitioner further sets forth, That as he was the last Parliament taken into Custody for speaking some Words of an Alteration against Popery in Seven Years time, he has sufficient cause to believe, that the whole House was at that time acquainted of him; for it happened within a day or two after he was discharged: When the House was up, he went in to see what it was of the Clock by the Dial; there re∣mained some of the Members behind, who took notice of him; and one of them asked your Petitioner, What he did there? and bid him be gone, Saying, That he was one that wish'd for the time to wear the Ribbon again. Thus your Petitioner, through much difficulty, by the Intercession of a Friend, obtained his Liberty from a Prison, with paying of Fees. And Serjeant Topham being now restored to his Place, your said Petitioner agreeing to the Authority of this House against Popery, and expecting for the said Serjeant to do likewise, he was willing to humble him∣self to the said Serjeant in any manner that your Honours should require of him: But the said Serjeant having thwarted the Authority of the Mem∣bers, in not admitting your Petitioner to his said Place; therefore your said Petitioner further sets forth, That the Cause of the said Serjeants acting against your Petitioner, and of his being offended at him, in keeping him out of his said Door-keepers Place, doth arise upon some old Grudge: Ever since he did belong to this House, he has endeavoured to undermine, and to sell your Petitioner out of his said Door-keepers Place for 20 or 30 l. And accordingly in the late King Charles's time, he was pleased to tell your Petitioner, he was offered so much for it; and within a a short time after he turn'd your Petitioner out, and was then Restor'd by some of the worthy Members of the House; but was first told by one of the Worthy Members, that the Serjeant said, That he should ask pardon; whereas your Petitioner is Conscious of no Crime that he had committed against him; and the said Serjeant having no objections against him, he was then restored without asking Pardon, and without paying any Mony for it. But it may be objected, That the Serjeant is a Patent Officer, and so he has a Power to Depute Servants under him. For Answer, He has no Patent to act unjustly, and to twhart the Authority of any of the Members of this House against Popery; and your Petitioner being thankful to those Worthy Members, who have spoken to the Serjeant in his behalf; and the said Serjeant pretends to some of them, that he shall have share of the Profits, which is nothing at all; and that he pretends that he offered your Petitioner a Messengers Place, which your Petitioner is not capable of; and this is only with a design to exclude your Petitioner for ever from his said Door-keepers Place; and so to make him his Bondslave, and to turn your Petitioner out at his pleasure: And he makes an Objection concerning Letters, which was occasioned about Six or Seven years ago, upon the said Serjeants receiving some Money out of the Exchequer for the Under-Servants belonging to this House, which was never paid to any other Serjeant before this; for the Under-Servants did formerly use to receive it themselves, (as the Door-keepers to the House of Lords, the Usher of the Black Rod did never concern himself with their Mony that they received out of the Exchequer) but this Serjeant has endeavour'd to en∣gross that Mony to himself; and accordingly he kept back part of your Petitioners Mony, and threatned to turn him out of his Place; thereupon he sent a Letter to the said Serjeant at Windsor for his Mony, who sent him an answer by his Son, wherein he doth seem to question your Petiti∣oners due, and yet acknowledges the Debt: But your Petitioner having confuted him in that Letter, and so fully convinc'd him of his due, that he sent another Letter by his Son of what time he would be at London, within some time after he paid him half a Guinea in part, though it was in a great rage and storm: But when the said Serjeant came to Town again, your Petitioner went to demand the rest of his Mony; thereupon he storm'd at your Petitioner, and said, that it was not his due, and that he would not pay it him; and after the said Serjeant received many Letters from your Petitioner, and would shew him no Reason and Justice; so that at the last, as he was in Town, he storm'd at your Petitioner and threatned to serve a Warrant upon him: Thereupon your said Petitioner reply'd, That he would save him that trouble, and go with him be∣fore any Magistrate without a Warrant; and if it was not his due, he would not have a Farthing of him; and so your said Petiti∣oner went voluntarily with him without a Warrant, before Justice Dewcy, who forthwith ordered the said Serjeant to pay him the rest of his Mony. And thus your Petitioner recovered his due: And by the payment thereof, (as your Petitioner is able to make manifest by Letters) the said Serjeant doth acknowledge the said Inward Door-keepers Place to be your Petitioners Right, and his due, by the Authority and Command of any Member of this House, who is pleased to give it him, as being above the power of the Serjeant; though the said Serjeant, by his Arbitrary Power, has denied divers of the Members, and doth still keep your Petitioner out of his said Place; and though the Serjeant is trusted with a Power to depute in case of a Vacancy, yet as he is a Servant himself, it is all in reference to the Service of this House; and so they are all Servants under the command of all your Honours, according to the Example of other old Servants, and of Mr. Cooper, who was Outward Door-keeper to this House about 40 years, till he died; and so was continued in by the Authority of the Members against any Serjeant at Arms that opposed him; and according to the Example of a Serjeant at Arms, (within the memory of your Petitioner) who disobeyed the Order of the House; thereupon the House turn'd him out, and sent for another Serjeant; yet notwithstanding the Door-keepers continued in their Places; and if they were his Servants, then they were dismiss'd too; but they were Servants to the House; and so they were mentioned in the Resolves of the House for Collections to pay the Under-Servants attending the Service of this House; and by a former Resolve of the House, as in the year 1671. for them to be recommended to his Majesty to give order for a Recompence and Satisfaction of the said Servants attending the Service of this House. And your Petitioner doth remember, that in the late King Charles's time, when the said Serjeant threatned to turn him out; your said Petitioner told the said Serjeant, That he was a ervant to the House of Commons; thereupon the said Serjeant threatned to break your Petitioners Head, if he told him so again, saying, That he was the Kings Serjeant at Arms; but, by the Serjeants Favor, as he is the Kings Serjeant at Arms, so he is the Kings Servant; and as he is the Kings Servant, so he is constituted by the King to attend the Service of this House. But your Petitioner has sufficient cause to believe, that the said Serjeant at Arms would Assume a Regal Power to himself. And now your Petitioner may say, that it is an undeniable Argument by the Serjeants denying divers of the Worthy Members for your Petitioner to be admitted to his said Place, who has been a Sufferer for speaking against Popery, that the said Serjeant doth look upon his Old Grudge; that it ought to take place before Loyalty, or it ought to extirpate Loyalty, or any part of Loyalty to his Present Majesty; yea, if it was in his power for lucre of gain, he would take any man into custody, that acts against Popery; for he has commanded your Petitioner to depart the Lobby, and laid hold on him to turn him out by Violence, when he has given him no provocation; and has told him that the Door-keepers Place is no Place for him, who doth agree to the Authority of all your Honours against Popery. And thus the said Serjeant stands brazening and confronting the Authority of your Honours in your Loyalty to the Kings most excellent Majesty, who is Defender of the Faith against Popery and Arbitrary Government. And the said Serjeant may consider, that though he frowns upon your Petitioner, yet the Times do smile upon him: But the said Door being still kept by the same Man that was put in the last Parliament by Serjeant Shoreditch, who turn'd your Petitioner out for being against Popery. And thus all the Places belonging to this House being under the Authority and Jurisdiction of all your Honours; Therefore your Petitioner doth further humbly pray for the Consideration of this Honourable House, That as it was his Fathers Place be∣fore him, so he hopes that as consistent to the Benevolence of this House in point of Charity, and his suffering upon the account of Popery, as concurrent to the Authority of this House against Popery or Arbitrary Government, will be Arguments to prevail with all your Honours to reconcile the said Serjeant to him, so that he may be restored to his said Door-keepers Place. And your Petitioner shall Pray, &c.
