An Address from the Corporation of Albany to his Excellency, returning Thanks for his Excellency's early Assistance for their Relief, &c. A Journal kept by Coll. Nicholas Beyard and Lieut. Coll. Charles Lodwick, who attended his Excellency in this Expedition. SUnday, the 12th of February, 1692, about ten a Clock at night, an express from Lieut. Coll. Beekman of Ʋulster County, gave his Excellency an account of Advice from Albany of the French and Indians, consisting of 550 being within 20 miles of Schenectady on the 8th instant, an hour before day, ready to fall upon the two first Castles of the Mohaques. Whereupon his Excellency ordered the Collonol of the Militia of the City of New-York to draw out his Regiment the next Morning Munday the 13th, Orders were sent to Coll. Courtland of Kings County, and Coll. Willet of Queens County, to detatch out of their Regiments a hundred and fifty men, to be forth-with ready to imbarque at the Ferry.
About eight a Clock in the Morning the City Regiment being under Arms, his Excellency on Horse-back, at the head of the Regiment, demanded, Who were willing to follow him to the Frontiers against the Enemy? They unanimously threw up their Hats, and cryed, One and all. Upon which the Collonol was ordered to detach 150 of the fittest men, to be under the Command of 3 Captains, with their Subalterns, ready at the first Beat of Drum, and dismissed the Regiment, and ordered all Sloops for Transportation to be secured. About ten a Clock his Excellency did send the express forward to Coll. Beekman, with orders to get all the Horses in the County of Ʋlster together in readiness, to carry his Excellency and the Detachments from Kingstone to Albany by Land, in case the River was not open, and to forward any Confirmation of the News to his Excellency. Tuesday the 14th, by break of day came an express from Major Ingoldsby, con∣firming the former News, and that the two first Castles were taken by the French and Indians. Whereupon eight Sloops were ordered, with necessary Provisions and Amunition to go round the Fort, and be ready to sail, and the Detachment of the City Regiment did immediately imbarque. About four a clock afternoon the Tide offering, his Excellency attended with the Officers of the Detatchments, and several Volunteers, did imbarque and set sail. Friday the 17, about 9 a clock his Excellency arrived at Albany, being 50 leagues distant from New-York, with five of the Sloops, having met with much Ice in the River, which gave some difficulty; the rest arrived towards evening. As soon as they came on shore, his Excellency ordered Capt. Schuyler to march 50 of the men for Schenectady; about 11 a clock his Excellency followed, with 26 Horse, leaving Instructions with Coll Beyard to forward all the rest of the Detach∣ments, as they did arrive, , without loss of time together with the Amunition and Provisions. About 3 a clock afternoon, his Excellency met Major Ingoldsby about 8 miles from Schenectady, on his return for Albany, having gone from thence to visit Sche∣nectady that morning. His Excellency arrived at Schenectady, being 20 miles from Albany, about 5 a clock. About 9 a clock at night Capt. Schuyler, with his men arri∣ved, and found Provisions & Quarters in readiness for his men Saturday morning the 18th, by break of day the men were ready to be transport∣ed over the River but a violent Storm did hinder their Transportation till afternoon, and sundry Indian Women loaden with Provisions, were sent along with them. This day about Noon Major Merrit, with the rest of the City Detachment, did ar∣rive at Schenectady, and were immediately furnished with Quarters, Amunition and Provisions, ready to march next morning. Sunday the 19th, by break of day, the rest of the Forces that were fit to march, did attempt to get over, but great Quantities of loose Ice did hinder, till about ten a clock the Ice settling, they got over it on foot, which in two hours was dispersed, and the River open again. This partly carried a further supply of Provisions and Amunition. Munday the 20th, by break of day, those of the City Detachments, who were not able to march the day before, being refreshed, his Excellency detached from the Garrison of Schenectady, so many of them as made 42 who did immediately march with 13 Horses loaden with Provision and Amunition. About 2 a clock afternoon arrived at Schenectady Capt. Stillwell, with the Detach∣ment of Kings County, consisting of 50 men, who were ordered to refresh them∣selves till next morning, and three Horses with Provisions ordered to be in ready∣ness to attend them.
Tuesday the 21st, the Horses being carried over the River, and the men ready o to be transported, came an express from Major Schuyler, giving intelligence of his being near at hand on his Return, who arrived about 4 a clock afternoon, upon which the men and Horse were remanded, and sent back to their own homes. There marched by his Excellency's order (to joyn Major Schuyler) since his arrival 208. effective men, besides Guides and Carriers of Supplyes, with considerable quantities of Provisions and Amunition, which are since returned. Wednesday the 22d his Excellency returned for Albany, accompanied with Major Schuyler, and several of the Forces come from pursuit of the Enemy, and arrived about 3 a clock afternoon, much dissatisfied at the Enemies escape. His Excellency did order Major Schuyler, with some other Officers, to give the Journal of their Action in the Woods. At 4 a clock arrived Coll. Willes at Albany, with 120 men from Queens County, who were next morning remanded home to their Habitations, together with the rest of the Detachments. At night his Excellency sent to call those Indians that were returned from the Fight, to meet him next morning at Albany. Thursday the 23d, a Proclamation issued, requiring all the out Farmers to draw themselves into Neighbourhoods, for their better security against the sculking Enemy, and to fortify with Stockadoes. Fryday the 24th, his Excellency received an Address from the Corporation of Albany, congratulating his safe return, and returning Thanks for his early Assist∣ance with his Personal Presence for their Relief, &c. Saturday the 25th, the Indians being arrived last night, and giving their attend∣ance, this morning his Excellency, being accompanied with the Magistrates of this City, and the Souldiers and Militia in Arms, came to the City Hall, and made his Speech to the Indians, which was interpreted to them by the Interpretess Helle. In the afternoon they gave their Answer to his Excellency by the same Interpretess. Sunday the 26th, about 8 a clock in the morning, four of the chief Sachims came to his Excellency, with some further Propositions, which he immediately answer'd to their Satisfaction. Munday the 27th, his Excellency caused a Proclamation to be published, prohi∣biting the selling of Rum to the Indians, and did imbarque for New-York, where he arrived Thursday morning following, and was received with such Expressions of Joy and Thankfulness, as the place could afford. Nicholas Beyard, Coll. Charles Lodwick, Lieut. Coll. IN Obedience to his Excellency's Command, Peter Schuyler Mayor, with the other Officers under his Command, give this following Account of their proceedings since the first Intelligence of the Enemy's descent into the Country of the Mohaques. February the 8th, being Wednesday, about 2 a clock afternoon, we had the alarm from Schenectady, that the French and their Indians had taken the Mohaques Castles; soon after we had the News, that a young man, called Jan Baptist van Eps, (taken at Schenectady 3 years a go) was run over from the French, as they were to attack the first Castle of the Mohaques, and come to Schenectady, who related, that the French were 350 Christians and 200 Indians. Major Ingoldesby sent forth-with his Warrants, to command in the Farmers of Capt. Genits and Capt. Tunis's Compa∣nies
of Militia. This night Lieut. John Schuyler and Cornet Abeel with 55 Horse, marched to Schenectady. February 9. Cornet Abeel came express from Schenectady, and desired that Major Schuyler or Major Wessels might be sent thither to pacifie the Indians, who were enraged that no Christians went out in pursuit of the Enemy. Upon which Major Schuyler at his own request was permitted to go that Evening. As soon as Major Schuyler arrived there, he sent out scouts to spy the Forts, and the Enemies motion, and withal to go & warn the Tionondoge Indians of the Enemies coming, but they having gone 12 miles, returned, about 12 a clock at night, saying, they could not get over the River. Feb. 10. Major Schuyler sent Lieut. Johannes Schuyler and Lieut. John Sanders, and six more to view the Mohaques Fort that was possessed by the Enemy, who brought news, that the French were in both the Forts; of all which he gave advice to Major Ingoldsby at Albany. Feb. 11. Major Schuyler sent 10 Christians and 40 Indians to lie near the Enemy, and to watch their motion, who made a small Fort to retreat into, and so spyed what the Eenemy did. Feb. 12. News was brought to Schenectady by some of the said Scouts, that they had heard firing at the Mohaques Forts, which was supposed the Tionondoge Indians against the French; which News Major Schuyler sent forward to Albany. Where∣upon Major Ingoldsby detached about 200 men out of the several Companies of the Militia Fuzileers and Troop, commanded by Capt. Peter Matthews, Capt. Arent Schuyler, Capt. Benj. Phips, Capt. Kihad van Renslaer, and Capt Tho. Gartin, who arrived at Schenectady about   clock afternoon▪ and joyned Major Schuyler: The Waggons with Bread arrived that night. This day our Scouts brought us the News, that the French were there still, & that they had also cut off the third Castle of the Mohaques, called, Tionondoge, and that none of the upper Indians were come down; all which was advertised to Major Ingoldsby forthwith, and Major Schuyler sent to him for Orders to march. Feb. 13. This morning having received no answer of the said Express, Major Schuyler sent another for Orders to march, and being pressed with the Indians, who threatened else to desert us, was forced to march the men over the River without Orders, which came about 4 a clock in the afternoon, when most of the men were got over the River. This very time we had News by our out Scouts, that the French had burnt the Mohaques three Castles, and were marched away, which Major Schuyler ordered Lieut. Young to signifie to Major Ingoldsby We marched 12 miles that evening, being 273 Christians. In the night about 10 a clock one of our Scouts came in, and told us, that 600 of our uppermost Indians were coming down; Major Schuyler forthwith sent the same Messenger, that brought us the News, to Major Ingoldsby, and desired that Provision and Amunition should be sent after us, not knowing what the Indians might have occasion for. Feb. 14. About 1 or 2 a clock in the morning we decamped, and marched to the small Fort which was made by our 50 Scouts, about six a clock in the morning, where we had advice, that the Enemy was not above eight mile from us; upon which Lieut. Harme van Slyk and two Indians were sent to discover the Enemy, who brought us word, they were marched; two Indians came to us with News, that there were 300 of our upper Indians within 20 mile of us, whereupon we sent two Indians back to hasten them up, and to let them know we were there to joyn them. We sent out three Mohaques to discover the Enemy; about 4 a clock in the after∣noon we decamped, and marched to the place where the Enemy had lain the night before.
Feb. 15. In the morning two of our Indian Scouts returned (the third being run over to the Enemy) who brought us news they had seen the Enemy within ten miles. Our Indians came up with us about 12 a clock, being 290 Men and Boys, some Armed, and some without Arms, a Consult being had, we marched about 4 a clock, and encamped all together, having marched about ten miles that after∣noon. This night a Consult was held, and Spyes sent to discover the Enemy. Feb. 16. We marched early in the morning, and having gone ten miles, sound the place where the Enemy had lain two nights before; we halted there, an Onyde Indian came from the Enemy, being sent to our Indians to debauch them over to the French, which Messenger we did not think sit to send back, being one of the Prisoners taken at Tionondoge. We sent an express to Major Ingoldsby to acquaint him that the Enemy had built a Fort, and were resolved to fight us, and sent for supplies of Provision, Amunition and Men. We marched on toward the Enemy, and met with one of our wounded Indians, who informed, that the Enemy stayed for us in a Fort; upon which we marched about two miles, where a Christian Boy (Arnaut the Interpreters Son) came to us, who had been three years a Prisoner among the French. he gave account, that the Enemy were about 6 or 700 men, and within three miles, we marched forward to find some convenient place to en∣camp, and to fortifie our selves from the Enemy that night; we had Scouts out (Christians and Indians) all night to watch the Enemies motion, who brought ac∣count in the morning that we were within a mile of their Fort. Feb. 17. We decamped, and marched toward the Enemy, with Scouts before us, and did not take a direct line, but went round, for fear of an Ambuscade, and came in sight of their Fort about eight a clock in the morning, where our Scouts came and shewed us where the nemy lay, upon which all the Officers were command∣ed to take their Posts, and make ready to engage, being 250 Christians, and 290 Indians, the Enemy seeing us, gave three , which we answered with as many, and as loud as they, and made the Woods ring; our Indians went to work to fall Trees and fortifie, but the Enemy sallyed out immediately, we engaged them, and beat them back into their Fort, our Indians fell to work again, and de∣sired our Christians to help, which they did; the Enemy sallyed out with all their strength a second time, encouraging their men, crying, They Run, we ill cut them all off, and get their Provisions: We received them briskly, & beat them back into their Fort, with the loss of several of their men: Our men fell to work again about the Fort; the Enemy sallyed out the third time, but were as well repulsed as be∣fore, and beat into their Fort, with considerable loss, our Indians bringing several of their Heads and Scalps into our Fort; after this the Enemy was quiet, and we finished our Fort; as soon as this Skirmish was over, we sent an Express to Major Ingoldsby, to acquaint him what had passed, praying him to hasten our Recruits with Provision and Amunition, for that greatest part of our men had not had any Provision in two days time; we sent out Scouts of Christians and Indians all that night, to discover the Enemy's motion, and lay all night in our Fort; it was ex∣tream bad cold snowy weather. Feb 18. Being cold stormy Weather, and Snow, insomuch that we could scarce see any Tract, our Scouts came in this Morning, which gave account that the Enemy were in their Fort, some being still popping at our People. About nine a clock an Indian that left the French in their Fort told us, He thought the Enemy would Retreat, that they were packing up their Baggage. Upon which Major Schuyler order∣ed the Captains to draw out their men to march round the Enemy's Fort to stop them; but the same time had an account they were fled; he commanded the Offi∣cers
to pursue them, and to hinder their Retreat, till Men and Provisions came up▪ but the Men wanting Provision, refused to march; the Officers, with 60 Christians and some Indians pursued the Enemy till they had made a small Fortification, but the Officers not having men to engage them, nor to make a Fort, returned back▪ leaving two Officers with 40 men and 100 Indians to watch their motion, expect∣ing our Provision to come up that night. Feb. 19. About 7 a clock in the morning we had an acoount, that our Provisions were near at hand, which came up to us about nine or ten a Clock, with 80 men, commanded by Capt. Simms; the Provisions being immediately distributed among the men, those that were first served, were commanded away after the Enemy. with five Biskets a man: About four a clock, the van being commanded by Capt. Peter Matthews and Capt. Arent Schuyler, came up near the rear of the Enemy, the Scouts telling us, the Enemy were within less than an English mile; we desired the Indians to joyn with us to fall upon their Rear, till the rest of our men came up, sending in the mean time to our People, to march up in all haste, but the Indians halted, and could not be perswaded to march, the Mohaques being most unwilling, because the Enemy had dropt several Prisoners, who told them, that if they pursued them, they would kill all their Wives and Children, whom they had Prisoners; after an hours Consultation of the Indians, most of our men came up, we marched with all speed, thinking to overtake the Enemy before they got to the River side, but there being a flake of Ice in one part of the River, and all open above and be∣low, the Enemy got over before we got up▪ We encamped by the River side that Night. Feb. 20. In the morning Major Schuyler resolved to march over the River, to pursue the Enemy, ordering the Officers to get the men ready for that purpose, but many of the men being wearied with fatigue, their Shoes being quite wore out, and Provisions , were not able to make any further pursuit▪ But that which did most of all discourage us, was, that the Indians had great averseness to pursue or fall upon the Enemy, because of their Wives and Children; whereupon we marched back. In this Engagement we lost four private Souldiers, & four Indians, two Officers and twelve Christians, and Indians wounded; and we had an account by some of our Indian Prisoners that made their escape, that we killed of the Enemy 33, whereof we found but 27, among which was their Commandant, one Captain, and two others Officers, with two of their commanding Indians, and 26 wounded. We rescued between forty and fifty Prisoners. Since their Retreat we are informed by divers of the Prisoners, who come home daily, that all our men Prisoners except five, have made their escape, or are set at liberty, and but few Women and Children left with them, not being able to carry the Prisoners off, by reason of their wounded men, whereof they carry thirteen. As we did not hear, so we could not expect that your Excellency should in so shorttime (at that season of the Year) be advanced so near us as to Schenectady, and that so considerable Supplies could be so speedily got together: And we observed it was no small encouragement to our Indians to see your Excellency at the head of 300 men, besides Volunteers, for our Relief, and theirs; of which we are all sensible.

The Examination of Andries Casparus & Cornelius Claese van den Bergh, both Dutchmen, taken before his Excel∣lency Benj. Fletcher, Governour, who have made their escape from Canada, who were Prisoners there, and have been 32 days by the way. THe said Cornelius Claese van den Bergh was taken at Canactagiere in July 1691▪ a little before the Mayor, Peter Schuyler went to Canada, and Andres Caspares who was gone out with some of our River Indians last fall to hunt, and withal to see how the far Natians, called, the Turchtuicks lived, was taken last March by a party of Turchtuicks and Davaganhaes, and brought to a Castle where said Indians lived, and was there to be burnt and eat by said Indians, from whence he run away that very day he received his cruel Sentence, and was sixteen days in the Woods, and came to a place where Monsieur Tontys People were making a Fort, and the said Mons. Tonty and Mons. La Free brought him to Canada. The said Prisoners say, that the French informed them, that there were ten Ships come from France with Provision and Amunition, but no men, scarce so many as could sail their Ships, that they had brought 120000 pound of Flower, and 160000 pound of Pork, also some great Guns, and two Morter Pieces. That there is a Fort built below Quebeck, in a narrow Passage where Ships must pass; the French spoke of two Forts (but an English man told him only of one Fort) and twelve Guns in each Fort. They had 1600 Souldiers three year ago, of which 1000 are killed and taken; this is besides 200 Inhabitants who are killed. The said Cornelis has lived all this while at the Governour of Mont Royal his House, called Monsieur d'Cellier, & judges there are about 400 men in Mont Royal with Souldiers and all, altho' the said Monsieur d' Cellier often told them, they had 700 men there. The Inhabitants seem to be much wearied of the War, and cry much for Peace, and pray that God would turn the Prince of Orange's heart, and incline him to make Peace, for it is his fault that all these Miseries are come upon them. There is a man come over with those Ships to be Mons. d' Cellier's Cock, who says, that the English had fallen upon the French Fleet unawares, and done them some damage, and pursued them to Brest, and if they had come but a quarter of an hour sooner, they had taken Brest, and all the Province of Brittanine The French have lost this Summer 37 French and 70 Indians at one time, going up the Falls to Ottawawa, and at a second time they lost 30 French the same way, and often times smaller Parties killed by our Indians. The said Andres Casparus says further, that when he came to the French House, after he had escaped from the Indians, the French tyed hm two dayes, but he being so lean and mager, having had no food all that time, but 11 Eggs he found in a Turkies Nest, and 6 Swan eggs he found in another place, so that the French did unty him. About eight days after Monsieur Tonty came (who is in the manner of a Governour among them) and he went down with said Tonty to Ottawawa, which was 200 Leagues from that place; the said Tonty depatched about 25 or 30 great
Canows full of Beaver to Canada; and after they had been two days from Ottawawa, they met one Monsieur de Lille, who had been out a skulking upon the great River▪ and had taken two Prisoners, who told that 300 of our Indians lay at a carrying place on the great River, waiting for the Ottawawa Company, and 200 were near Mont Royal Island upon the same design. They stopt said Company till M. Tonty sent for them back, and resolved to go to Canada with 200 men Indians and French without Beavers, in which Company the said Andres Casparus came, being reckoned 300 Leagues between Ottawawa and Canada. As soon as the said Andries came to Mont Royal, M. Tonty delivered him to the Governour of Mont Royal, who put him in Prison four days, and then released him to work in his House; but as soon as he got out, consulted with his Comrade Cornelis to run away, which they did accordingly. After they had been about a moneth or five weeks together in said M. d' Celliers house, the said Andries says, he saw a great prodigious Quantity of Beavers at Ottawawa; an Inhabitant of Canada, called Jaques de Tallie, told him, he had 3000 Beaver of his own there, and that there was as many Beavers now in Ottawawa as would load 200 Canows to Canada, and each Canow generally holds nine or ten hundred Beavers▪ which the said Andries doth credibly believe to be true, there being none gone from thence to Canada in a great while. There is a Fort at Ottawawa burnt by accident this spring, where Mons. la Free had the Command, wherein was great store of Beavers and Peltry, and several Goods and Merchandize. This is the Account the said two Prisoners gave at Albany the 4th of October, 1692. and is entred down from their Mouthes, by his Excellency's Command. Robert Livingstone. The Examination of Joachin Lebert, a French Man of Canada, and Native of Mont Royal, taken before his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, at Albany the 4th of October, 1692. THat he lived at Prerie de lay Magdelain. That it is 60 Leagues from Mont Royal to Quebeck. That Mr. de Cellier is Governour of Mont Royal. That there is 2000 men carrying Arms in his Government, Souldiers and Inhabitants. That the Town of Mont Royal is inclosed with Stockadoes. That there is 53 pieces of Canon, Brass and Iron, eight Companies of Souldiers, unequal in number, 50 men being the most. That the Fort of Magdelaine contains 23 Families, 400 men in Arms, 2 pieces of Canon, and 5 Patteraroes. There is 200 men in the Indian Fort, called, Ganawagne. That there is ten Men of War arrived at Quebeck, from France, laden with Amu∣nition, & that he saw the said Ships. That he hath been taken 43 days, and says, that the day before his being taken he being at Mr. Celliers house, he saw a Canow arrive there from Mr. Le Count, sent to Mr. Cellier to demand the Collers of Beeds, which are usually presented at the concluding a Peace, the which occasioned him to say there was Ambassadours coming to treat a Peace.
Upon the Objection made, That there could not be so many People in Canada▪ he says, that the two French men that were sent to York some time since, being now at Canada, did inform Mr. Le Count, that the English had assembled all their Na∣tions, with a design upon Canada, which obliged Mr. Le Count to raise all the men he could possible, which was that Number he said. And says, he knows nothing more. His Execellency Benjamin Fletcher's Speech to the Indians at the State-House in Albany, February 25, 1692. BRETHREN, IT is not unknown to some of you, that I came last October into these parts upon no other occasion than to view the Fronteers, and put them in the best posture I could, to secure us and you, from the Attempts of the French and their Indians, our Enemies and yours. And in order to this I sent a supply of Amunition, Artil∣lary, and Christian Souldiers, sufficient to prevent any Insult from our Enemies, and it had the effect I expected, for they durst not face the weakest of our Garrisons. I came now for your Relief, and have lost no time; the same day that I had an ac∣count from hence that our Enemies were in this Country. I put my self on board a Sloop, and brought with me 150 Christian Souldiers, besides Volunteers, and arri∣ved here before I could be expected; I then immediately marched to Schenactady, from whence I sent you supplies of 200 and odd men, Amunition, Provision, &c. with which those that joyned you before, under the Command of Major Schuyler, might have secured an entire Victory, and prevented the French and their Indians from any possibility of getting back to their own houses, but it has pleased God to order it otherwise. I had also 200 Christians more upon their march, who arrived here, and would have been a considerable Reinforcement to us, but the Action be∣ing over, I commanded them back to their former Residence, till further Orders. It is obvious to me, and I believe to you all, that this Calamity is fallen on you by your own faults. I could never suppose my Brethren, the Mohaques, would be so supine and careless, as to suffer the French, and their Indians▪ to enter their Castles without the least Resistance. These men that have an Enemy near, must sleep with Arms in their Hands, and one eye open, that is, they must keep Scouts and Spves, so as never to become a prey to their Enemies, by their own negligence. I must advise you, that for the future, you keep strict watch, so that I may have timely notice of the Enemy's motion, and you will then see how easily they will be defeated. I hope it is now apparent to you, that the great of King of England is ready to apply his Arms for your defence, when you consider, that in a very few days I am come personally to your Assistance, with near 400 Christian Souldiers. I have had the Honour to bear Command under the great King of England, my Master▪ where I have seen the French fly before his Victorious Arms; and last Summer it pleased God to add to his Victories, by the defeat and destruction of their Fleet, in which most of their Ships were burnt or sunk. I came now in great haste, and brought no Presents with me, but design (by the blessing of God) to be with you at the beginning of Summer, to give you some∣thing to wipe off your Tears for the Brethren that are lately lost, to renew the antient Covenant Chain, and to give you further Assurances of the Great King of
England's Favour, and of my own Readiness upon all occasions to appear as his Servant, for your Protection against our Enemies and yours. My present care now is, to provide for the Mohaques Nation, about which I have given my directions to Major Sehuyler, who will appoint them a place for their Residence; I have also ordered some Corn for their present support, which they will receive from him. I must add, that it concerns your Honour & Reputation to make some brisk attempt upon our Enemies, and this with what secrecy and expedition you can, that those People may see you retain the antient Courage of your Ancestors, and I do not question but God will give you success by a severe Revenge on our Enemies and yours. I am informed, that your Young Men have killed the Horses of some Christian Souldiers, who were upon the same service with you (it is not Brotherly) and I desire for the future, you will take care to prevent such Outrage, that the antient Covenant Chain may be preserved inviolably on your parts, as it will be on the part of my Master, the great King. To conclude, I must tell you, that I doubt there is some false Brother among us, who keeps intelligence with our Enemies, concealing their designs, and exposing ours; if you have one French man among you, he will be true to his Country▪ by betraying you. I have order'd you some Bread and Bear, and desire you will drink the Healths of my great Mr. and Mrs the Victorious King and most Illustrous Queen of Great Brittain, France and Ireland, and all their Majesties Territories in America; and so bid you farewell. The Answer of the Five Nations, viz. the Mohaques, Oneydes, Onondages, Ca∣youges and Sinnekes, To his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Captain General and Governour in thief of their Majesties Province of Nèw-York, &c. in Albany this 25th of February, 1692. Sadeganaktie, Saehim of the Onondages, Speaker. Interpreted by Hille, the Interpretess. Brother Cayenquirago, which signifies a great swift Arrow, a Name the five Na∣tions have given his Excellency, because of his speedy arrival here, with so many Men for their Relief, when the Enemy had fallen upon the Mohaques Country. WHen we arived at Schenectady, after our march against the Enemy, you was pleased to desire us to come hither, where we heard you, Great Swift Arrow, speak, and participated of your Favours, we acknowledge that the Enemy, the French of Canada have fallen upon our Brethren, the Mohaques, and destroyed their three Castles, which we can attribute to nothing else but their not hearkening to the great Swift Arrow's good Advice, which was to keep good Guard and out Scouts. We return you, Brother great swift Arrow, our hearty Thanks for your care in pro∣viding for the Mohaques, that they may not starve, nor be in want in this extremity. Brother, great swift Arrow, You propose to us the atracking the Enemy in their Country, to shew them that we have not lost the Courage of our Ancestors; we return you our hearty Thanks for your good Encouragement, for we are in a man∣ner drunk with the Blood lately shed by them. It is not usual for us, while we are in that grief and annixity, as now we are, to proceed to revenge our selves of the Enemy; you have lost your Blood as well as we, there ore that Blood ought to be revenged unanimously by both sides. Brother, Great Swift Arrow, You recommend us to go and attack the Enemy
where they are at home in Canada, but you are acquainted with us of old, that it hath alwayes been our Custom, first to bewail & condole the Death of them kiled by the Enemy; for we are all one Heart, one Blood, one Soul; nevertheless we de∣sign to go out and to fall upon the French, but we must first secure our Castles, since we know, that the Governor of Canada is intended to send out a considerable party, but whither we know not. Brother, Great Swift Arrow, While you press us to go and attack the Enemy of Canada by Land, we expect, according to the many Promises and Engagements made to us, to hear of a considerable Force to go with great Guns by Sea, that the Enemy might be assaulted both ways, and so over-come; we press this the harder, because a great part of our strength is now broke, and therefore take it not amiss that we push this point of taking Canada by Sea, since its impossible to be done by Land alone. Brother, Great Swift Arrow, We return you our hearty Thanks, that you are so ready to assist us upon any occasion, and for the good advice to be watchful, and keep out good scouts and spyes; it is probable, that we would have done a great deal more damage to the Enemy had we been so well provided with all sorts of Amunition, as the Indians of Canada are; but some of our men have Guns, and no Powder nor Ball, and some but Bows and Arrows, as Major Schuyler saw, when we came up to him; but the Governour of Canada supplies his Indians with all sorts of Arms and Amunition, which we found now when we engaged them. We pray you, Great Swift Arrow, to have a careful Eye over us, since this party of the French that has destroyed the Mohaques Castles, is but part of his strength, he is working with the Ottawawa and Dowaganhaes Indians, where he has a great Ma∣gazeen, and supplies them with all sorts of Amunition, and we fear that that force will come down upon us still. Brother, Great swift Arrow, We return you thanks for remembring our dead, and that you will condole their death, when you come up in the beginning of Summer, but you can expect no Return from us, being in so mean a capacity and condition. Brother, Great Swift Arrow, You inform us of the great Victory that our Lord of Lords (meaning the great King of England) has got upon the French, the common Enemy at Sea, which is admirable, and all the Nations are heartily rejoyced at it, and we hope that the great God that has his Seat above the Heavens, will give the same success to our great Lord of Lords Arms in this part of the World, over his and our Enemies, the French of Canada. We pray that you would be pleased to acquaint our great Lord of Lords, who lives over the great great Lake, of our mean Condition, and what posture we are in, and how easy it is to destroy Canada, if all our great Lord of Lords subjects in these Collonies would unite and joyn together, with some Ships that carry great Guns, which our great Lord of Lords can easily spare us, after this late Victory over the French at Sea. We desire that you would be pleased to order a Smith to be with us in our Coun∣try to repair our Arms, that we may defend us from the French. His Excellency replyed, That he hoped they were sufficiently satisfied of his rea∣diness to assist them, and that the Force the French had now sent was the most they could make; and if they would but keep out scouts, and advertise his Excellency timely of the Enemies coming, his Excellency does not doubt, with the strength he has in his Province, to deal with the Governour of Canada, and all his Power. The Governour granted their Request of the Smith to be in their Country to re∣pair their Arms.
Proposals made by four of the chief Sachims of the five Nations, to his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, in Albany the 26th of February, 1692. Brother, Great swift Arrow; WE are come to acquaint you, that one of our men has last night in a drunken fit, killed an Indian that came over from the French, at which we are much concerned, and therefore come to see how our Brother great swift Arrow resents it. We desire that you would be pleased to prohibit the selling of Rum while the War is so hot, since our Souldiers cannot be kept within Bounds, if they be drunk. Brother great swift Arrow, We answered your Excellency's Proposals yesterday, but had not time to consult with that deliberation as we ought, and if therefore there be any thing omitted, or if we failed of our duty, we beg that you would be pleased to pardon that omission; for we must declare in behalf of all the Nations, that we are singularly obliged to you, Brother great swift Arrow, for your so extra∣ordinary dispatch and suddain arrival here for our Relief, with so considerable a Force, the like never having been done before, whereby we see your readiness and allacrity to help and assist us. And we do also return you thanks for leaving your directions with Major Schuyler to take care of the Mohaquas Nation. We are thank∣full for your kind expressions, to be so ready to come for our Relief, and that you warn us to come and acquaint you as soon as we see the Enemy a coming a far off, not doubting of your Power to protect us, since we have seen a sufficient proof of that already by this late Expedition. Brother great swift Arrow, we do emgage to make a narrow enquiry as soon as we come into our Country, about the French Prisoners, who we supect may betray us: we have had two bouts with the Onedeys about the Priest Milet that is among them, and we intend to try the third time. We desire that you, Brother great swift Arrow, may come up as soon as the Bark is loose upon the Trees, since we have a design upon the Enemy. We forgot to answer you in that business about the Young men killing the Horses we acknowledge, its not Brotherly, but very ill done, and as soon as we come into our Country we will take such methods that it may be prevented, by finding out them that have done it, causing them to make Satisfaction. His Excellency replyed, that he was much concerned that they should exercise their Arms one against another, while there is an Enemy in the Field, and hopes they will for the future endeavour to prevent such Irregularities: That they may be now sufficiently convinced how ready the Arms of the great King of England is to succour them; & that his Excellency, for his own part will never spare to expose his Person for their security. That the Rum shall be prohibited upon their Re∣quest; and that the most he requires of them, is to be vigilent and careful, and not suffer themselves to be surprized, and then they need not fear the French.
To his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Captain General and Governour in Chief of their Majesties Province of New-York, Vice-Admiral of the same. The Humble Address of the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonaty of the City of Albany. May it please your Excellency; WE are extreamly sensible of your Excellency's special Care, not only for the Safety and Security of your Excellency's Government in general, but in particular for the extraordinary Regard taken for this City, being the utmust Frontier thereof, seated near One Hundred and Fifty Miles up in the Country▪ whilest the same was attacked by the Enemy of Canada, who had surprized and burnt the three Castles of the Mohaques, killed divers of their fighting men, and lead in Captivity upwards of 130 Women and Children, and that your Excel∣lency should within two days after notice received from hence, make that dispatch as to be here so suddainly with 300 men, and sufficient Provisions and Stores of War for our immediate Relief, which was more than ever could be expected in this Winter Season. We therefore out of a deep sence of your Excellency's unparralleled Affection to and Care for us, cannot but esteem our selves highly obliged to your Excellency, and beg of you to accept our Unfeigned Thanks, assuring your Excellency, as we shall never forget your extraordinary care of us, so shall we ever admire and beg the continuance of your Excellency's benigne Government over us; and since the Mohaques Nation is wholly dispersed by the Enemy's burning all their three Castles, and our Farmers live stragling up and down the Gountry, in great danger to be cut off by the skulking Indians, We pray that your Excellency in your Wisdom will be pleased to order some convenient place where the Remnant of said Nation may be convened together, and fortified for any attack of the Enemy, and that the Frmers may be ordered to fortifie themselves in Companyes together▪ that the Enemy may not have an advantage of them. And we humbly beg your Excellency to believe, we are always ready to venture our Lives and Fortunes for their Majesties Service, the Defence of this Province, and with all chearfulness and allacrity shall endeavour, when-ever it lies in our Power, to demonstrate our true Affection to your Excellency in particular, and to approve our selves, Your Excellency's most Dutiful, And most Obedient Servants, Peter Schuyler, Mayor, Lvinus V. chaick, Alderman, Rymen Barentse, Asistant. Dirk Wessells, Recorder, Evert Banker, Alderman, Johannis Roseboom.
