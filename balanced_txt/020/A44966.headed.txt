An Humble ADDRESS TO ALL The Truely Loyal COMMONS OF ENGLAND, By a true Lover of his King and Country. GENTELMEN, I am not ignorant that whatever comes forth in Print, altho it assert Allegiance to the King, and Obedience to Magistrates, yet now a days it is Alamode to Libel it: as I fancy not the sheltring my self under any mans Wings in a matter of this na∣ture, because it signifies in my apprehension a distrust of what is written; which were I Guilty of, I would not come in publick View. So also I decline to Court the Readers with a flattering Epistle for their approbation, it being irrational, yea redicu∣lous, to think that judicious men will be wrought upon by any thing but what convinces their Judgments and Reasons, and not according to mens Fancies and Affections, and he that judges o∣therwise, is not a competent Judg, neither shall I vallue what such men say. Gentelmen, if you seriously consider what ama∣zing Cirtumstances have of late attended the managemet of State-Affairs in this our Hemisphear; it must needs be matter of wonder and astonishment; and I will appeal to all sober per∣sons who are not byassed by Interest, or swayed by Passion, whe∣ther they believe any History can parallel the impudent Libels and saucy Pamphlets that have lately been exposed to publick View, Tempora mutantur a principio non fuit ita, the excellent saying of the reno wired Lord Chief-Justice North, is truely ve∣rified,
That his Majesty is merciful even to a Miracle, and not∣withstanding all the violent Commotions in State-Affairs, how great hath been the Prudence of our Royal Soveraign, who in Concurrence with his honourable Privy-Council in the great in∣terval of the Parliament hath continued us in Peace. How great have been the Clamors of Popery and Arbitrary Government; yet whose Rights and Priviledges have been in the least measure invaded. Gentlemen, I earnestly implore of you, that you will let Reason have its Domination and Rule in you, and suffer not your selves to be misled, nor insinuated by men who pretend Loy∣alty to the King, and prosperity to the Government, when in reality, Ambition is their only Aim; for no man who is Compo∣mentis can believe that those men who in their Caballs strive to carry on private Designs contrary to the know'n will of their Soveraign, can wish real happiness to his person or good to his Government, but only to become popular. Therefore I do positively aver it is the undoubted Right of our Soveraign to ad∣mit whom he pleaseth to be of his Privy-Council and at his plea∣sure, for Reasons best know'n to himself, to send them a Quietus est, and by this he fully understands their Tempers and Inclina∣tions, and in whose Judgments he may faithfully rely; and it is a Duty incumbent upon all, from the highest to the lowest, still to return their Fidelity and Allegiance to the King, and not to murmur nor slighly to insinuate into the people, a misconstru∣ction of their Princes Actions and a mislike of his Government; it was a true saying by a Peer who received eminent and signal Favours from his Prince, that they that, fall under the displeasure of their Prince fall gentely; God grant it may work a thorow Reformation. It is common among all men to cry long live the King, let not their Actions give their Tongues the Lie. Let them speedily put in practise those things that tend to administer peace to their Soveraigns Mind and tranquility to his Life; and now Gentelmen and fellow-Citizens, I will address my self more par∣ticularly unto you: I very well know you are not ignorant of an Address lately presented to my Lord Mayor, wherein the Com∣mons are earnest with my Lord to represent them Loyal to the King, and that they are ready to joyn in the defence of his Royal person and the Protestant Religion against all Attempts and Plots. There are many hundreds of the Commons likewise, who were not present at the delivery of that Address, who desire that those Gentelmen that were, will be pleased in a second Address to my Lord Mayor, desire him to acquaint his Majesty of their readiness to joyn with those Gentlemen that were not there, in the defence of his Majesties Royal person, and the Protestant
Religion established by Law, without any Alteration either in Church or State; and that the Parliament may Convene when his Majesty shall judg it most convenient for his own benefit and the Nations welfare; and that then all Animosities and Distin∣ction of Parties by Names may be obliterated, and that we may all strive to exceed each other in our fearing God and honou∣ring the King; then may we expect Peace and plenty to coha∣bit amongst us, which that it may faxit vni. I shall take the freedome to reassume the Address, it were well if those worthy Citizens who delivered the Address, would acquaint their fel∣low Citizens particularly with the Names of the persons who misrepresented us to the King, that innocent persons might not be in the Catalogue of indiscreet informers: I could heartily wish (my dear fellow-Citizens) that those persons whose in∣clinations have in them a propensity to Passion and Ambition would permit of Reason to bear sway; and that they would se∣riously consider of the speech lately spoken by our present Loyal Lord Mayor; who therein declares, that he calls God to wit∣ness he never did misrepresent the Citizens to his Majesty, nor he does not easily believe any would. Were there but a candid Construction put on mens Actions, and that men could not cre∣dit every idle and impertinent Story, there would then be no room left for Jealousies and Animosities amongst us. O I do positively aver, never any Magistrate served his Majesty more faithfully, nor the City more honesty than our present Magistrate considering the present circumstances that we lie under, and it is very plain he is not easily insinuated and wheedled by the little Artifices of hot headed and turbulent men. It is well known he has a plentiful Estate, and therefore he does not covet Ambiti∣on, but makes it his greatest Care to serve his King and Country, and that which many men strive to attain, per fui & nefas, he is invested with power in himself, to wit, to be a Member of Par∣liament. It is to be hoped that our noble Senators at their Con∣vention, being very sensible of the Designs and Caballs of Men of Republican Spirits in this long Enterval, will frustrate them, and will by a unanimous concurrence amongst themselves follow the Examples of their Ancestors, and supply his Majesty frank∣ly; and by this means they will endear his Majesty to his Sub∣jects, and his Subjects to him: whoever they are that are of con∣trary Opinion, their discent is not from the Result of a delibera∣ted Judgment, or a well regulated Reason, but upon the score of self-Interest; or else they are such who thorow inadvertencie or secular advantage, have been formerly concerned in Lands be∣longing either to Church or State; and it is evident what the
Designs of such Men are, and what they aim at: witness some Wills which have been lately made, wherein after they had bequeathed great part of their Estates, they are pleased to insert in order to the Lands formerly in their pos∣session. If Providence shall order a return they bequeath it for such and such Uses. It is very obvious to considering men, they have a mind to be fishing with the old Bat; but from Men of such Principles, Libra nos Domine, and I think his very perspicnous to all sober good men, that some Citizens amongst us, who were very Zealous for the Convention of the Parliament, their Zeal was not out of publick good either to the King or people; but for advantage to them∣selves; and to be accounted great in the esteem of the Vulgar; and yet these are the Men who are very fierce against worshiping of Jeroboams Calves, either at Dan or Bethel, yet account it nor Icolatry to be Idolized themselves. For had they not been half witted, they must needs have remembred what his Majesty had formerly declared, that it was his Resolution to continue the Parliament by short Prorogations, not resolving their Sitting til November, unless Affairs from abroad occasioned him to appoint their sooner Convention. I do believe there is no rational Man but is of Opinion it is the Subjects Right to Petition their Prince, but to Petition for that which his Majesty had resolved should be, looks as if they doubted of his Majesties performance; and none but men of shallow principles would entertain such Notions. It is very well known there are some persons amongst us of Antimonarchial Principles, who are for mode∣lzing of Government according to several Chimeras in their Brains, and they are waspish and angry because they are not admitted to understand the Arcana Imperii, but if they please to go to Jerico till their Beards are grown, or they grown wiser, it is very probable if his Majesty hath occasion to use them, he will give them timely notice; or they should do well to converse with their Grammar again, and put in practise that excellent Rule, Sorte tua contentus abi, it is very likely, that Midsummer-Moon being past they may be reduced again to their right temperament of mind: There is one thing worthy of the inspecti∣on into by our Senatos, which is the Licentiousness of the Press, which hath greatly occasioned our Domestick jars: I could heartily wish, that many of those Gentlemen who discent from the Church of England, not in Fundamen∣tals but in Circumstantials, would not allow nor manifest their approbation to many of those pernicious and lying Pamphlets which reflect on his Majesty and his Government, would they but openly in Print declare their dislike and de∣testation of them, it would greatly demonstrate o the King of their true Loyal∣ty to his Person, and submissiveness to his Government: It is our Coffe Houses those Posts of the Nation, that occasion much Contention amongst us, there Lies are minted, and boldly asserted by many impudent beggarly Coxcombs, and many grave Fops give as much Credit to them as they do to their Creed: would men mind their Shops and frequent these Houses less, there would be more Love and less Contention amongst us. Hither it is in Parliament time that the Petty-fogging Solicitors, and the Excrementious Gistepipes, with ma∣ny other Impudent Fellows resort to hear what News, and to Censure the Acti∣ons of our Grave Senators, and Cavil at whatsoever pleases not their Humors. It is to be hoped our Senators will take Cognizance of many things worthy of their speedy and serious Consideration in this long Interval, and will be happy Instruments of setling this our distracted Nation, in Peace and quietness, what an happy Sight will it be to see the King and his People Accord, a threefold Cord is not easily broken. I hope God will still preserve his Anointed, our gracious King, this present Parliament, and all his Loyal Subjects, from all dangers what∣soever, for Si Deus nob scum quis contra nos. London, Printed by D Mallet, 1680.
