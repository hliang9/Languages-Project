Pharonnida: A HEROICK POEM. BY WILLIAM CHAMBERLAYNE Of Shaftsbury in the County of Dorcet. . Hom. Odyss. Lib. XIX. LONDON, Printed for Robert Clavell, at the Sign of the Stags-head neer St. Gregories Church in St. Pauls Church-yard, 1659.
TO The right Worshipfull, SIR WILLIAM PORTMAN, BARONET. Honoured Sir, THough by that Splendor with which the boun∣tifull hand of Fortune, illustrated by the more excellent Gifts of Na∣ture, hath Adorn'd you, to the illuminating the Hopes of all your expecting Friends: I might justly fear these Glow∣worms of Fancy may be out-shone, to the obscurity of a contemptible Neg∣lect; You being like, ere long, to prove that glorious Luminarie, to whose ascending Brightness the happiest Wits
that grace the British Hemisphear, like Persian Priests, prostrated to the rising Sun, will devote the Morning Sa∣fices of their Muses: Yet Animated by your late Candid Reception of my more Youthfull Labours, whose humble flights having your Name to beautifie their Front, past the publick View unsullied, by the cloudy Aspect of the most Critick Spectator: I have once more assumed the boldness to let the Infirmities of my Fancy take Sanctuary under the Name of so honoured a Patron. Though my Abilities could not Cloath Her in such Robes, as would render Her a fit Companion for your serious Studies, yet I hope her Dress is not so sordid, but she may prove an acceptable Attendant on your more vacant Hours. For my Subject (it being Heroick Poesie) it is such as the wiser part of the World
hath alwaies held in a Venerable Esteem, the Extracts of Fancy being that noble Elixer, which Heaven ordain'd to Im∣mortalize their Memories, whose wor∣thy Actions being the Products of that nobler part of Man, the Soul, is by this made, almost Commensurate with Her Eternity; which otherwise (to the sor∣row of succeeding Ages) who are in debt for much of their Vertue to a noble E∣mulation of their glorious Ancestors, had either terminated in a Circle of no larger a Diameter then Life; or like short breath'd Ephemera's, only surviv'd a while in the Aiery Region of Di∣scourse. This, Sir, having been the past Fortune of our Predecessors; And, as the Pregnant Hopes of your bloom∣ing Spring, promises the World like to be yours in the future; yours, when
both the splendid Beauties of your most glorious Palace, and the lasting Stru∣cture of your Marble Domitory, time shall have so levigated, that the wanton Winds dally with their Dust: I doubt not but to find you so much a Mecaenas, as to affect the Eternizing of your Name, more from the lasting Linea∣ments of Learning, then those vaine Phainomena of Pleasures, which are the low Delights of more Vulgar Spirits. Though I confess these  be∣neath the serious View,  a Wit Acuated with the best Adjuncts of Art, will, ere long, render the ordinary Re∣creations of your Progressive Studies; yet, as in relation to the Latitude for which they were Calculated: I hope they may not appear unworthy a present Su∣pervisall; It being intended (like the
weak Productions of the early Spring) but for the April of your Age; where, though my Hopes tell me it may subsist, whilst irrigated with those balmy Dews of Passion, which are the usuall Con∣commitants of Youth: I am not guilty of so un-becoming a Boldness, as to think it fit to stand the heat of your more vigo∣rous Maturity, when the Meridian Al∣titude of your Comprehensive Judgment shall have attain'd so neer an universali∣ty of Knowledge; As the Sun when in its Apogaeum, doth of Light, that being on∣ly hindred by a Comparatively Punctil∣lo of Earth; As the powerfull Energies of noble Souls, are by the upper Gar∣ments of their Mortality, from being at once Ubiquitary Blessings. Fortifi'd by these Considerations, with the hope of your Acceptance, and assur'd, that prefixing your Name, is an
Amulet of sufficient power to preserve me from the Contagion of Censure; I have, with an unruffl'd Confidence, given these Papers a Capacity of being pub∣lickly viewed: If their being lik'd at∣tain but neer the Dimensions of your be∣ing belov'd, it will co-equate the know∣ledge the World shall have of them; that being so universall, as the Serenities of your Bliss is the happiness of your neerest Relations; so is it much of the hopes of those, that only know you at a remoter distance: And shall be still the Prayer of, SIR, Your devoted Servant, William Chamberlayne. Shaftsbury, May 12. 1659.
TO THE READER. SInce Custome obliges me to give a Welcome at the Gate, I shall not be so irregular, as not to meet that common Civility, with a fair Compliance. And though like the passive Elements, I lie open to all the Incongruity of Aspects, of which I have some reason to doubt, the most pow∣erfull may be found in a disdainfull oppo∣sition; yet, like the noblest of Active Creatures (Light) I shall not think my self sullied by every Vapour; nor sollicite his Acquaintance, that cannot so long spare his Eyes from beholding more Active Va∣nities. I have alwaies held it a Soloescim for En∣tertainers to be Beggers. And, although by exposing these Papers to the publick View, I must consequently expect variety
of Censures; should be loath to descend so low to court the Applause of every Rea∣der, from whose various Genii, I am ne∣cessitated to take such Welcome, as Af∣fection in most (though Judgment in so the) shall incline them to give. For the first of which, as their Censures are doubt∣full, so their Calumnies are small, not of weight sufficient to ballance the indifferent temper of my thoughts: But for the latter, since look'd upon as competent Judges, though their Sentence may be formidable; I shall beg no further favour, then what their Abilitie thinks fir to bestow; only, for what they may justly except against, could rather wish that whilst these Papers were private, I had had their Advice to reform, then now they are publisht their Censure to condemn. Fortune hath plac'd me in too low a Sphear to be happy in the Acquaintance of the Ages more Celebra∣ted Wits: Wherefore wonder not, that I appear un-usher'd in with a Train of Enco∣miums, which (though I confess) If from knowing and juditious Friends, they add a Luster to the Authors ensuing La∣bours;
yet the Custome of these Times often makes them appear as ridiculous, as a splendid and beautifull Front to an emp∣ty and contemptible Cottage. I have made bold with the Title of He∣roick, but have a late Example that deters me from disputing upon what grounds I assumed it: If it suits not with the Abili∣ties of my Pen, yet it is no un-becoming Epithite for the Eminence of those perso∣nated in my Poem. For the place of my Scean, manner of Composure, and the like; though in Prefaces they often find an im∣mature Discovery, and perhaps, but acu∣ate an Apetite to what, on further progress may prove but a distastfull Banquet: I hold them so impertinent, that if Will, and Leasure serves you to read, you may suddenly with more Advantage, satisfie your self, if not omit them as strangers to your other Affairs, and not to be under∣stood but in their own Dialect. I have done with all that in probability may prove my Readers; And now a
word to such, whom I presume, will be none, for they are desir'd to do no more then the Epistle, It being fit to serve them like Vagabonds, let them enter no further then the Gate; I mean, all squint-ey'd Sectaries, from the Spawn of Geneva, to the black Brood of Amsterdam: together with some Rascals of a lower Rank, such as usurp the abus'd Title of, Sons of Art, and with an empty Impudence, endea∣vour to pollute those Immaculate Virgins; whilst the other, with an exalted Villany sully the Celestiall Beauties of Divine Truth. For the first of which, the prepo∣sterous Genius of the Times hath so far fa∣vour'd them, that now nothing is more vendible then the surreptitious off-springs of their immagin'd Wit: Every Stationers Shop affording pregnant examples of it, in big bulk'd Volumes of Physick, Astro∣logie, and the like: By these indigent Vermine, either to satisfie their clamorous Wants, or inhance their esteem in the Vulgar Opinion, basely prostituted to every illiterate Spectator; whilst Truth, and a guilty Conscience, tels them nought is
their own but the Hyperbolicall Titles, which to discerning Eyes appear but the glorious out-sides to tainted Sepulchers, in which their detected Villany shall be Abominated by more knowing Posterity These cry down all things of this Nature, for Subjects of Inutility, not tending to the improvement of Science, which in the most genuine Construction of it, hath no Enemy from which her ruine is more for∣midable then from them. But for my more dangerous Sceptick, (who yet is so much like the Fole of an Ass, that he appears to the World with his Spleen in his Mouth) I mean, my pre∣tended zealous Censurer, from whom in mee, it were an over-weaning boldness to expect Civility; since (though not for the Nature, which he understands not, yet for the Name which he hath only heard of, he is so much an Enemy to the Muses; that should the Seraphick Strains of Majestick David, or the flaming Raptures of Ele∣giack Jeremiah, appear to the World in their pristine and unpolluted Purity; his
Ignorance would extend to so vast an Error, to censure them of Levity. But as no man will esteem the Sun less Glorious, for that the hated Owle avoids its sight; so I presume, none, except their own deluded Followers will betray so pal∣pable a dearth of Judgment, as to bear the less estecm to Majestick Poetry; for the il∣literate scandal of flattering Ignorance: Poe∣sie (if justly meriting to be invested in that glorious Title) being of so attractive a Beauty, that it doth rather like an Orphean Harmony, draw that Emblem of a Beast, the unpollisht Clown to a listning Civility, then like Circe's Inchantments, change the more happily Educated, to a swinish and sordid Lethargie. But her defence being a burthen which already stands firm on so many no∣ble Supporters, whose Monuments will re∣main, till Time it self shall be lost in Eter∣nity: I need not add my weak Endeavours to illustrate a Beauty, which the wiser world already admires; Now (though she want the Applause of some) Attribute it not to the defect, either of her Excellency, or their
Judgment; but to that various Dress of Humours, wherewith Nature hath Chec∣quer'd the Universe: Concluding with that Honour of ancient Thebes, . Pindarus in Olympiorum octavo. W. C.
PHARONNIDA. The first Book. CANTO THE FIRST. The ARGUMENT. I. From Seas wild fury, and the wilder rage Of faithless Turks, two noble strangers freed, Let Curtesie their gratefull Souls engage To such a Debt as doth obstruct their speed. II. Where they to fill those Sceans unactive rest, Would tedious make in fair description saw, How Spata's Prince for his Queens loss opprest, Found all those Ills cur'd in Pharonnida. THE Earth which lately lay like Nutures Tomb, Marbl'd in Frosts, had from her pregnant Womb Display'd the fragrant Spring, when courted by A calm fresh Morning, ere Heavens brightest Ey Adorn'd the East, a Spartan Lord, whom Fame, Taught from Desert, made glorious by the Name
Of Aminander, with a noble train, (Whose active Youth did sloath-like sin disdain) Attended, had worn out the Morning in Chase of a stately Stag, which having bin Forc'd from the Forests safe protection, to Discovering Plain, his clamourous Foes had drew Up to a steep Cliffs lofty top, where he As if grown proud, so sacrific'd to be To mans delight, 'mongst the pusuing cry, (Who make the Valleys eccho Victory) Sinks weeping, whilst exalted shouts did tell The distant Heads, their ancient Leader fell. The half-tir'd Hunters, their swift Game stopt here By death, like noble Conquerors appear, To give that Foe, which now resistless lies With their shrill Horns his Fun'rall Obsequies; Which whilst performing their diverted sight, Turns to behold a far more fatall fight: That since fam'd Gulf, where the brave Austrian made The Turkish Crescents an eternall shade, Beneath dishonour seeks, Lepanto lay So neer, that from their lofty station they A Ship upon whose Streamers there were fixt The Christian Badge saw in fierce Battell mixt, With a prevailing Turkish Squadron that With shouts assault, what now lay onely at That feeble Guard, which under the pretence Of injuring others, seeks its own defence. Clear was the day, and calm the Sea so long Till now the Turks, whose numbers grew too strong, For all that could no other help afford, But humane strength, within their view did board
The wretched Christians, to whose sufferings they Can lend no comfort, but what Pray'rs convey To helpfull Heaven, by whose attentive Ear, Both heard and pittyed, Mercy did appear In this swift change: A hollow Wind proclaims Approaching storms, the black Clouds burst in flames, Imprison'd Thunder roars, and in a shoure, Dark as the Night, dull sweaty Vapors poure Themselves on th' earth, t' enrich whom Nature vents Th' etherial Fabricks useless excrements; Whose flatuous pride, as if it did disdain Such base descents, rowling the liquid plain Into transparent Mountains, hurls them at The brow of Heaven, whose Lamps by Vapors that Their influence rais'd, are crampt, whilst the sick day Was languishing to such a Night as lay O're the first Matter, when Confusion dwelt In the vast Chaos, ere the rude Mass felt Heavens segregating breath; But long this fierce Conflict indures not, ere the Sun-beams pierce The scatterd Clouds, which whilst wild Winds pursue Through sullied Aire in reaking Vapors flew. In this Encounter of the storm before Its sable Vail let them discover more, Then contain'd horror, a loud dreadfull shriek, Piercing the thick Aire, at their Ears did seek For trembling entrance, being transported by Uncertain drifts, rent Sails and Tackling fly Amongst the towring Cliffs, a sure presage That adverse Winds did in that storm engage Some Vessell, which did from her Cordage part, With such sad pangs, as from the dying Heart
Convulsions tear the Fibers. But the day Recov'ring her lost Rain, made clearer way For a more sad discov'ry. They behold The brackish Main in funerall Pomp unfold The Trophies of her Cruelty: Her Brow Uncurl'd with Waves, was only spotted now With scatter'd Ruines, here engag'd within The ruffl'd Sails, some sad Souls that had been For life long strugling tir'd, at length are forc'd To sink and die; Yonder a Pair divorc'd From all the warm Society of flesh, With cold stiff Arms embrace their Fate; The fresh And tender Virgin in her Lovers sight, The Sea-Gods ravish, and th' Enthean light Of those bright Orbs, her Eyes, which could by nought But Seas be quencht, t' eternall darkness brought. Whilst pittying these, a suddain noise, whose strange Confusion did their Passions Object change, Assaults their wonder, which by this surprize Amaz'd, perswades them to inform their Eyes With its obscure Originall, when led By sounds that might in baser Souls have bred A swift aversion: clashing Weapons they Might soon behold upon the Sands, that lay Beneath the Rock, a Troop of desp'rate men, Unstartled with those dangers, which even then Their ruin'd Ship, and dropping Garments shewd Heaven freed them from, what Mercy had bestowd: Let their own anger loose, which flaming in A fatall Combate, had already bin In blood disfigur'd: But when now so near Them drawn, that every Object did appear
In true distinction, they with wonder rais'd To such a height, as Poets would have prais'd Their Heroes in, a noble Christian saw Whose Sword (as if by the eternall Law Of Providence, to punish Infidels, Directed) with each falling stroke expels A Turks black Soul; Yet Valor being opprest By multitudes, must have at length sought rest From Death, had not brave Ariamnes, by His Hunters followed, brought him Victory: Whilst the approaching danger did exclude Even hope, the last support of Fortitude. The desperate Turks that chose the Sea to be Their sad Redeemer of Captivity: Though from that fear they fled to death, had now Upon the Shoar left none, life could allow But motion to, though stopt by death such store, All the Escap'd appeard, but such as bore The fatall Story of destruction to Their distant Friends; when now a serious view By Ariamnes, and that noble Youth, Whose Actions (honourd as authentick truth) Made all admire him, of their pitty'd dead With sorrow took, one worthy Soul unfled From life they found, which by Argalia seen, With joy recalls those Spirits that had been In busie Action lost, but danger that Toward the Throne of life seem'd entring at Too many wounds, denies him to enlarge The Sheam of Love, as noble Vertues charge To him (her follower) Ariamnes by His goodness, and their sad necessity,
Prompted to pity, fearing slow delays As dangers fatall Harbinger, conveys The wounded strangers to the place, where he His Palace made the Throne of Charitie. 'Twas the short journey 'twixt the Day and Night, The calm fresh Evening, Times Hermaphrodite. The Sun on Lights dilated Wings being fled, To call the Western Villagers from Bed: Ere at his Castle they arrive, which stood Upon a Hill, whose Basis freng'd with wood, Shadowed the fragrant Meadows, thorough which A spatious River, striving to enrich The flow'ry Valleys, with what ever might At home be profit, or abroad delight, With parted streams that pleasant Islands made, Its gentle Current to the Sea conveyd. In the composure of this happy place Wherein he lived, as if fram'd to embrace So brave a Soul, as now did animate It with its presence, strength, and beauty sate Combin'd in one, 'twas not so vastly large, But fair convenience countervaild the charge Of Reparations, all that modest Art Affords to sor pleasures every part, More for its Ornament, but none were drest In Robes so rich, but what alone exprest Their Masters providence and care to be, A prop to falling Hospitality; For he not Comet-like did blaze out in This Country Sphear, what had extracted been From the Courts lazy Vapors, but had stood There like a Star of the first Magnitude,
With a fixt constancy so long, that now Grown old in Vertue he began to bow Beneath the weight of time, and since the calm Of Age had left him nothing to embalm His Name but Vertue, strives in that to be The glorious wonder of Posterity; Each of his Actions being so truly good, That like the Ground where hollowed Temples stood, Although by age the Ruines ruin'd seem, The people beare a reverent esteem Unto the place; so they preserve his Name, A yet unwasted Pyramid of Fame. Rich were his publick Vertues, but the price Of those was but the World to Paradice, Compar'd with that rare Harmony that dwells Within his Walls, each Servant there excells All but his Fellows in deset, each knew, First when, then how his Lords Commands to do; None more enjoyed, then was enough, none less, All did of plenty tast, none of excess; Riot was here a stranger, but far more Repining penury, ne're from that doore, The Poor-man went denied, nor did the rich Ere surfet there, 'twas the blest Medium, which, Extracted from all compound Vertues we Make, and then Christian Mediocrity, Within the compass of his spatious Hall, Stood no vain Pictures to obscure the Wall, Which usefull Armes adornd, and such as when His Prince requir'd assistance, his own men Valiant, and numerous, mannag'd to defend That righteous Cause, but never to attend
A popular Faction, whose corrupted Seed Hell did engender, and Ambition feed. His Judgment that like Lifes Attendant, Sence, To try each Objects various difference, Fit Mediums chose (which he made Vertue) here Beholding (though these wandring Stars appear Now in their greatest detriment) the Rays Of perfect worth, he to that Vertue payes Those Attributes of honour, which unto Their Births (though now in course disguise) was due: To Aphrons wounds successfull Art applies, Prevailing Med'cines, whilst Invention flies To the Aphelion of her Orb to seek Such modest Pleasures as might smooth the Cheek Of ruffl'd Passion, which being found are spent, To cure the sad Argalia's discontent: Which long being lost to all delight, at length Revives again his Friends recover'd strength. They having now no Remora to stay Them here but what their gratitude did pay To his desires, whose Courtesie had made Those bonds of Love, with as much zeal obey'd, As those which duty locks, preparing are To take their leave, even in whose civil War Whilst they contend with Courtesies, as sent To rescue when his Eloquence was spent. Brave Amminander, with such hast as shewed His speed to some supream Injunction owed Such diligence, a Messenger brings in A Packet, which that noble Lord had been Too frequently acquainted with to fear Th' unseen Contents which open'd did appear,
A Mandate from his royall Master to Attend him ere the next dayes Beauties grew Deform'd with Age, which honourd Message read To banish what Suspition might have bred In's doubtfull Friends, he the inclos'd contents, With cheerfull hast unto their view presents. Their fear thus cur'd by information, he That his appearance in the Court might be More glorious made by such Attendants to Incite in them a strong desire to view Those royall Pastimes, thus relates that story, Whose fatall truth transfer'd the Morea's glory So often thither. 'Twas my honourd friends My fate ('mongst some, that yet his Court attends) Then to be neer my Prince, when what now draws Him to these parts did prove at once the cause Of joy and grief. Not far from hence remov'd, The Vale of Ceres lies, where his belov'd Pharonnida remains, a Lady that, Nature ordaind for man to wonder at; She not being more the comfort of his age, Then glory of her Sex: but I engage My self to a more large discovery, which, Thus take in brief, When Youth did first enrich Beauty with manly strength, his happy Bed Was with her royall Mother blest, who fed A flame of Vertue in her Soul, that lent Light to a Beauty, which being excellent, In its own Sphear, by that reflection shon, So heavenly bright, Perfections height of noon Dwelt only there; Some years had circled in Times revolutions, since they first had been
Acquainted with those private pleasures that Attend a Nuptiall Bed, ere she did at Lucina's Temple offer, whose bar'd Gate, Once open flow, both their good Angels sate In councell for her safety, hopes of a Boy, To be Morea's Heir, fill high with joy The ravisht Parents, Subjects did no less, In the loud voice of Triumph theirs express. But when the active pleasures of their love Which fill'd her Womb, had taught the Babe to move Within the mory Mount, preceding pains, Tell the fair Queen, that the dissolving Chains. Nature incos'd it in, were grown so weak, That the imprison'd Infant soon would break Those slender Cuards, the gravest Ladies were Call'd to assist her, whose industrious care, Lend Nature all the helps of Art, but in Despair of safety send their Prayers to win Relief from Heaven, which swift Assistance lent, T' unload the Burthen, but those Cordials sent, By Harbengers, with whom the fair Queen fled, To deck the silent dwellings of the dead, And lodge in Sheets of Lead, o're which were cast A Coverlet of the Springs Infants past From life like her, even whilst Earths teeming Womb, Promist the World, and not a silent Tomb, That beauteous Issue; But those Nimphs which spun Her thread of life the slender twine begun, Too fine to last long, undenied by The pondrous burthen of Mortality; Beneath whose waight, she sinking now to death, Th' unhappy Babe was by the Mothers breath
No sooner welcom'd into life before She bids farewell, of Power to do no more, But whilst her Spirits with each word expires, Thus to her Lord express her last desires. Receive this Infant from thy dying Queen, Name her Pharonnida, at which word between His trembling Armes she sunk, and had even then Breath'd forth her Soul, if not recall'd agen, By their loud Mournings from the Icy sleep, Which like a chilling Frost did softly creep, Through the cold Channels of her blood to bar The springs of life, in which defensive War, The hasty Summons sent by death alow, Her giddy Eyes, whose heavy leads did bow Toward everlasting slumber, no more light, Then what affords a dim Imperfect sight; Such as the troubl'd Opticks being by, Dying Convulsions wrested, could let fly, Thorough their sullied Chrystals to behold, Her wofull Lord, whilst she did thus unfold Her dying thoughts; O hear, O hear (quoth she) I do, By all our mutuall Vows conjure thee to Let this sweet Babe, all thou hast left of me, Within thy Thoughts preserve my Memorie. And since (poor Infant) she must lose her Mother, To beg an entrance here, oh let no other Have more Command o're her then what may bear An equall poise with thy paternall Care. This, this is all that I shall leave behind, An earnest of our loves, here thou mayst find, Perhaps my Image to behold, whilst I Resolving into dust imbrac'd do lye,
By crawling Worms. Followers that Nature gave To attend Mortality, whilst the tainted Grave Is ripening us for Judgment: O my Lord, Death were the smile of Fate, would it afford Me time to see this Infants growth, but oh, I feel Lifes Cordage crackt, and hence must go From time and flesh, like a lost Feather fall From th' Wings of Vanity, forsaking all The various business of the World, to see What wondrous Change dwels in Eternitie. This sayd, she faintly bids farewell, then darts An eager look on all, but ere she parts, Even whilst the breath, with which in thin Aire slips Departing Spirits, on her then cold Lips In clammy Dews did hang, she of them takes Her last farewell, whilst her pure Soul forsakes Its brittle Cab'net, and those Orbs of light, That swam in death, sunk in eternall Night. Thus di'd the Queen, Pharonnida thus lost, Ere knew her Mother, when her Birth had cost, A price so great, that brought her Infancy In debt to Grief, untill maturity Ripen'd her Age to pay it, after long And vehement lamentation, such whose strong Assaults had almost shook his Soul into A flight from th' Earth, her Father doth renew His long lost Mirth, at the delight he took, In his Souls Darling; whose each cheerfull look, Crimson'd those Sables, which even whilst he wore A flood of Woes his head had silver'd o're: Had not this Comfort stopt them, which beguiles Sorrow of some few hours, those pretty smiles,
at drest her fair Cheeks like a gentle Thief, ealing his heart through all the Guards of Grief. But when that time's expunging hand had more Defac'd those sable Characters he wore Sorrows Livery o're his Soul, and she aving out-grown her tender Infancy, id now (her Thoughts compos'd of heavenly Seed) guide her life no other Guardian need, native Vertue, for her calm retreat, When burthend Corinth was with throngs repleat: chose this seat, whose venerable shade, Waving what blind Antiquity had made, or sacred held, is not so sleighted, bu Custome ancient, as our Law, hath shut ence (as the hatefull marks of servitude) ll that unbounded power did e're obtrude n suffering Subjects, which, this happy place its so serene a blessing to embrace, s is this Lady, whose illustrious Court, Though now augmented by the full resort, Of her great Fathers Train, doth still appear This happy Kingdomes brightest Hemisphear. A hundred noble Youths in Sparta bred, Of Valour high, as ere for Beauty bled, ll loyall Lovers, and that Love confin'd Within the Court are for her Guard assign'd. ut what (if oft in such an Orb of all That's great, or good, may low as Censure fall) he Court hath questioned, is the cause that mov'd The Prince to give a Party so belov'd nto his hands that leads them, being one Whose Birth excepted, that being neer a Throne,
Those Vertues wants on whose Foundation wise Considerate Princes let their Favours rise. Like the abortive Births of Vapors by Their Male Progenitors inforc'd to fly Above the Earth their proper Sphear, and there Lurk in imperfect Forms, his Breast doth bear Some Seeds of Goodness, which the Soil too hot, With rank Ambition, doth in ripening rot. Yet, though from those that praise humilitie, He merits not, a dreaded power which he Far more applauds, rais'd on the Wings of's own Experienc'd Valour, hath so long been known His Foes pale terrour, that 'tis fear'd he bends That Engine to the ruine of his friends, Whose equall Merits claim as much of Fame, As e're was due to proud Almanzors Name. Yet what may raise more strong desires to see, Her Court then Valors wisht societie, Is one unusuall Custome, which the love Of her kind Father hath so far above All past Examples rais'd, that for the time He here resides, no Cause, although a Crime, Which death attends, but is by her alone Both heard and judg'd, he seeming to unthrone His active power, whilst Justice doth invest His beauteous Daughter, which to the opprest, Whose hopes even shrunk into despair, hath in That harsh extream their safe Asilum bin: So that even those that fear'd the 'vent could now Mix their desires, the Custome would allow Her Reign a longer date. But that I may Illustrate this by a more full survay
Of her excelling Vertues, no pretence, Of harsh imployment shall command you hence, ll you have been Spectators of that Court, Whose Glories are too spatious for Report. The noble Youths beholding such a flame, Of Vertue shewn them through the Glass of Fame, First gaze with wonder on it, which ascends Into desire, a Rivolet which ends, Not till its swelling streams had drawn them through All weak excuses, and engag'd them to Attend on Ariamnes; when to show How much mans vain Intentions fall below Mysterious Fate, even in the height of all Their full Resolves, her Countermands thus call Back their Intentions, by a Summons that Th' uncertain World hath often trembled at. The late recoverd Aphron, whether by Too swift a Cure, Lifes springs being rais'd too high, lowd to a dangerous Plethora, or where Some Cause occult the Humours did prepare For that malignant Ill, did, whilst he lay In tedious expectation of the day, Shook with a shievering numness, first complain, Through all his Limbs of a diffusive pain: Which searching each to find the fittest part, For its Contagion, on the labouring heart Fixes at length, which being with grief opprest, By the extended Artries to the rest th' body sends its flames, the poysond blood Through every Vein streams in a burning flood. is Liver broyls, and his scortch'd stomach turns The Chile to Cinders; in each cold Cell burns
The humid Brains. A violent Earthquake shakes The crackling Nerves, Sleeps balmy Daw forsakes The shrivel'd Obticks; in which trembling fits, 'Mongst tortur'd Sences troubled Reason sits So long opprest with Passion, till at length, Her feeble Mansion, batter'd by the strength Of a Disease, she leaves to entertain The wild Chymera's of a sickly Brain. And, what must yet to's Friends Affliction add, More weights of grief, their courteous hast which had Stayed to the latest step of time, must now Comply with those Commanders, which could allow No more delays, and leave Argalia to Be the sole Mourner for his Friend, which drew As far as humane Art could guess so neer His end, that life did only now appear In thick, short sobs, those frequent summons that Souls oft forsake their ruin'd Mansions at. The end of the first Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The first Book. CANTO THE SECOND. The ARGUMENT. III. Whilst here Argalia in a calm Retreat, Allays the sorrow felt for's sickly Friend, Two blooming Virgins neer him take their Seat, Whose harmless Mirth soon finds a hapless end. IV. The fairest seiz'd on, and near ruin'd by Impeteou Lust, had not Andremon's speed Protected her, till from his fall drawn nigh The same sad Fate the brave Argalia freed. THat sad, slow hour, which Art even thought his last, With the sharp Feav'rs Paroxisme past Sick Aphron's Spirits to a cool reareat, Beneath a slumber (Lifes remotest seat)
Was gently stoln, which did so long endure, Till in that opiate quencht, the Callenture Decayed forsakes him, leaving nought behind, But such faint symptomes, as from ime might find An easie Cure, which though no perfect end Is lent to th' care of his indulgent Friend, Yet gives him so much liberty, that now Fear dares without his friendships breach allow Sometime to leave him slumbring, whist that he Contemplates Natures fresh variety. The full blown beauties of the Spring were not By Summer Sun-burnt yet, though Phoebus shot His Rays from Cancer, when prepard t' expand Imprisond thoughts, from Objects near at hand, To ey-shot Rovers, freed Argalia takes A Noon-tide walk, through a fair glade that makes Her aged Ornaments their stubborn head, Fold into verdant Curtains, which she spread In cooling shadows o're the bottoms, where A chrystal stream unfetterd by the care Of nicer Art, in her own Channel played, With the embracing Banks, untill betrayed, Into a neighbouring Lake, whose spatious Womb, Lookt at that distance like a chrystal Tomb; Fram'd to inter the Nayades. Not far From hence an Oak, whose limbs defensive War, 'Gainst all the Winds, a hundred Winters knew, Stoutly maintaind, on a smal rising grew, Under whose shadow whilst Argalia lies, This Object tempts his Soul into his Eyes. A pair of Virgins fairer then the Spring, Fresher then Dews, that ere the glad Birds sing.
The Mornings Carrols drop, with such a pace, As in each act shewd an unstudied grace, Crossing the Neighbouring Plain, were, now so near Argalia drew, that what did first appear But the neglected Object of his Ey, More strictly viewd, cals Fansie to comply, With so much love, that though no wilder fire Ere scortcht his breast, he here learnt to admire Loves first of symptomes. To a shady seat, Near that which he had made his cool retreat; Being come beneath a spreading Hawthorn they, Seating themselves, the sliding hours betray, From their short lives by such discourse as might Have made even time (if young) lament his flight. Retir'd Argalia, at the sight of these, Though no obsceaner vanity did please His Eyes, then Anch'rites are possest with, when Numbring their Beads, or from a sacred Pen Distilling Heavens blest Oracles, yet he Wondring to find such sweet Civility Mixt with that places rudeness, long beholds That lovely pair, whose every act unfolds Such linkt affections, as wise nature weaves In dearest Sisters, but their form bereaves That thought ere featherd with belief, although To admitation, beauty did bestow Her gifts on both, she had those darlings drest, In various colours, what could be exprest By Objects fair, as new created light, By Roseall mixtures, with immaculate white, By Eyes that emblemd Heavens pure Azure, in The youngest Nymph, Florenza, there was seen;
To which she adds Behaviour far more free, Although restraind to strictest modesty, Then the more sad Caina, who, if there Were different years in that else equal Paire, Something the Elder seemd, her beauty such, As Jove-lov'd Leda's was not prais'd so much, For Rose or Lillies residence, though they Did both dwel there, as to behold the day Lose its Antipathy to Night, such clear And conquering Beams so full of light t' appear Thorough her Eyes, shewd like a Diamond set, To mend its Lustre in a foil of Jet. Nor doth their dress of Nature differ more In colour, then the Habits which they wore; Though fashiond both alike, Floronza's green, As the fresh Spring when her first Buds are seen, To cloath the naked Boughs: Carinas white As Innocence, before she takes a flight, In thought from cold Virginity. Their Hair Wreath'd in contracting Curls, beneath a fair But often parting Vail, attempts to hide The naked Ivory of their Necks, that pride Of Beauties Frontispiece. On their heads sate Lovely, as if unto a Throne of State; From their first Earth advanc'd, two flowry Wreaths, From whose choice mixture in close Concord breaths The fragrant Odour of the Fields, plac'd by Them in such order, as Antiquity Mysterious held: Being sate, to pass away Th' unactive heat of the exalted day, They either tell old harmles Tales, or read Some story where forsaken Lovers plead
Unpittied Causes, then betwixt a smile And Tear bewail Passion should ere beguile Poor Reason so, at length, as if they meant To charm him who far from each ill intent So near them lay, melting the various throng Of their Discourse, into a well-tun'd Song; Whose swift division moulds the Aire into Such Notes, as did the Sphears first tunes out-do. Argalia in this Lab'rinth of delight, To Action lost, had drawn the vail of Night, In quiet slumbers, o're his heavy Eyes, Lockt in whose Armes, whilst he securely lyes Least the mistakes of vain Mortality, The brittle Glass of Earth should take to be Perfections lasting Addamant, this sad Chance did unravel all their mirth; There had Some of the Princes noblest Followers, in That Mornings nonage led by Pleasure been, Far from their Sphear, the Court, and now to shun Th' unhealthy Beams of the reflcted Sun, Whilst it its shortest shadows made, were to The cool protection of the Woods withdrew: In which retreat, as if conducted by Their evil Genius (all his Company An awfull distance keeping) none but proud Almanzor in those guilty Groves, which shrowd The hapless Virgins enters, who so near Him sitting, that, soon his informing Eare Thither directs his Eye, unto his view Ere scarce thought obvious swiftly they withdrew But with untimely hast, his Soul that nurst Continuall flames within it, at the first
Sight kindles them, ere he discovers more, Then difference in the Sex, such untried ore, Hot, heedless lust, when made by practice bold, Ith' flame of passion ventes on for Gold. But when drawn nearer to the place he saw Such beauties whose magnetick form might draw Souls steeld with Vertue, custome having made His impious Rhetorick ready to invade, He towards them hast, with such a pace as might Excuse their judgments, though, in open flight, They strove to shun him, but in vain, so near Them now he's drawn, that the effects of fear Obscuring reason, as if safety lay In seperation, each a several way From danger flies, but since both could not be, By that secure, whilst her blest stars do free The glad Carina, from his reach the other He swiftly seizes on; hot kisses smother Her out-cries in the Embrio, and to death Near crusht Virginity, ere from lost breath She could a stock of strength enough recover, To spend in prayers; the tempting of a Lover, Mixt with the force of an Adult'rer, did At once assail, and with joynd powers forbid All hopes of safety; onely, whilst dispair Lookt big in apprehension, whilst the Aire Breath'd nought but theatnings, promising him to pay For't in her answers, she doth lust betray Of some few minutes, which with all the power Of prayer she seeks to lengthen, sheds a shower Of tears, to quench those flames, but sooner might Hels sooty Lamp extinguisht be, the sight
Of such a fair, but pitiful aspect, When Lust assails, wants power to protect. By this hot parly, whilst she strove to shun His loathd embraces, the throngd Spirits run To fortifie her Heart, but vainly seek For entrance there, being back into her Cheek Sent in disdainful blushes; now she did Intreat Civility, then sharply chid His blushless impudence; but he whose skil In Rhetorick was pregnant to all ill, Though barren else, summons up all the choice Of Eloquence, that might produce a Voice To win fair Vertues Fortress, though her chast Soul armd against those battering Engines past That Conflict without danger, when inrag'd, By being denied, with passion that presag'd A dangerous Cons'quence, his fierce eyes sixt On hers, that melting with pale terror mixt Floods with their former flames, her souls sad doubt He thus resolves. Unworthy Whore, that out Of hate to Vertue dost deny me what Thou freely grantst to every rude Swain that But courts thee in a Dance. Think not these tears Shall make me wave a pleasure, that appears Worth the receiving. Can your sordid Earth Be honourd more then in the noble Birth Of such a Son as, wouldst thou yield to love, Might call thee Mother, and hereafter prove, The glory of your Family, from Jove, The noblest Mortals heretofore that strove To fetch their Pedigree, thought it no stain, So to be illegitimate, as vain
Is this in thee, there being as great an Ods 'Twixit you and u, as betwixt us and Gods? Trembling Florenza, on her bended knees Thus answers him; That dreadfull power that sees All our disvellop'd thoughts, my withess be You wrong my Innocence: I yet am free From every thought of Lust. I do confess Th' unfathomd distance 'twixt our Births, but less That will not make my sin, it may my shame The more, when my contaminated Name Shall in those ugly Characters be shown, To the Worlds publick view, that now is known By th' blush of honesty, whose stile, though pore, Exceeds the Titles of a glorious Whore; Attended whilst Youth doth unwitherd last, With envied greatness, but frail beauty past Into a swift decay, assaulted by Rotteness within, and black mouth'd Callumny, Without, cast off, blushing for guilt, the scorn Of all my Sex. My Mother would unborn Wish her degenerate Issue, my Father curse The hour he got me. As Infection worse Then mortall Plagues, each Virgin that hath nought To glory in, but what she with her brought Into the World, an unstaind Soul, would fly The Aire I breath; cast Whores being Company For none but Devils, when corrupted vice A Wilderness makes Beauties Paradice. To this much ill, dim eyed Mortality A prospect lends; but what, oh what should be When we must summ up all our time in one Eternall day, since to our thoughts unknown,
Is only feard. But if our hallowed Laws Are more then Fables, th' everlasting Cause 'Twill of our torment be. If all this breath Formd into Prayers, no entrance finds, my death Shall buy my Virgin-freedome, ere I will Consent to that, which being performd will kill My honour to preserve my life, and turn Th' unworthy beauty which now makes you burn In these unhallowed flames into a Cell, Which none but th' black Inhabitants of Hell Will ere possess. Those private thoughts which give If we continue verteous, whilst we live On Earth, our Souls commerce with Angels, shall Be turnd to Furies, if we yield to fall Beneath our Vices thus, O then take heed Do not defile a Temple, such a deed Will, when in labour with your latest breath, With horror Curtain the black Bed of death. Though Prayers in vain strove to divert that Crime, He prosecutes, yet to protract the time, She more had sayed, had not all Language been Lost in a storm of 's Lust, which raging in His fury gives a fresh assault unto Weak Innocence, for Mercy now to sue To hope seems vain, robustious strength did ba The use of Language, which defensive War Continuing till the breathless Maid was wrought Almost beneath resistance, just Heaven brought This unexpected Aide. A lovely Swain Whose large Possessions in the neighbouring Plain, Had stil'd him rich, that powerful, which t' improve, To that fair stock his vertue, added love,
Which to flattery, since it lost its eyes, The world but seldome sees without disguise. This sprightly Youth led by the parallels Of Birth, and Fortune, what ere else excels Those fading blessings, to Florenza in His Youths fresh April, had devoted been With so much zeal, that what that heedless age But dallied with, like Customes which engage Themselves to habits, ere its growth he knew, Love equal with his active manhood grew, Which noble Plant though in the torrid Zone Of her disdain, 't had nere distemper known, Yet oft those sad vicissitudes doth find, For which none truly lov'd, that nere had pin'd, Which pleasing passion, though his judgment knew How to divert, ere reason it out-grew, It often from important action brought Him to those shades, where Contemplation sought Calm sollitude, in whose soft raptures, Love Refining Fancy, lifts his thoughts above Those joyes, which when by trial brought to th' test, Proves thoughts bright Heaven, dul Erth when once pos∣sest Whilst seated here, his eyes did celebrate, (As to those shade,) Florenza oft had sate Beneath kind looks, to ravish that delight, The tir'd Caina in her breathless flight, Come neer the place, assaults his wonder in That dreadful sound, which tels him what had bin Her cause of fear, which doleful stories end, Arriv'd to th' danger of his dearest Friend, Leaves him no time for language, ere wingd by Anger, and Love, his hast strives to out-fly
His eager thoughts. Being now arriv'd so near Unto the place, that his informing Ear, Thither directs his steps, with such a hast, As nimble souls when they are first uncs'd, From bodies slie, he thither speeds, and now Being come, where he beheld with horror how His better Angel injur'd was, disputes Neither with fear nor policy (they'r Mutes When Angers thunder roars) but swiftly draws His Faulchion, and the justice of his Cause, Argues with eager stroaks, but spent in vain, 'Gainst that unequal strength, which did maintain The more unlawful, all his power could do, Is but to shew the effects of Love unto Her he ador'd, few stroaks being spent before His feeble Arme, of power to do no more, Faints with the loss o blood, and letting fall Th' ill-manag'd VVeapon, for his death doth call By the contempt of mercy, so to prove A Sacrifice, slain to Florenza's Love. The cursed steel by the robustious hand Of fierce Almanzor guided, now did stand Fixt in his breast, whilst with a purple flood, His life sois forth ith' Channel of his blood. This Remora remov'd, the impious deed No sooner was performd, but ere the speed Florenza made (though to her eager flight, Fear added wings) conveyd her from his sight: His rude hand on her seises. Now in vain She lavisht Prayers, the groans in which her slain Friend breaths his soul forth, with her shrieks did fill The ambient Aire, struck lately with the still
Voice of harmonious Musick; But the Eare Of penetrated Heaven not long could heare Prayers breath'd from so much innocence, yet send Them back deni'd, white Mercy did attend Her swift deliv'ry, when obstructing fear Through Reason let no Ray of hope appear▪ Startl'd Argalia, who was courted by Her pleasing Voices milder Harmony, Into restrictive slumbers, wakend at Their Alter'd Tone, hast to discover what Had causd that change, and soon the place attains. Where in th' exhausted treasuce of his Vains Andremon wallows, and Florenza lies, Bath'd in her tears, ready to sacrifice Her Life with her Virginity, which sight Provok't a hast, such as his presence might Protect the trembling Virgin, which perceiv'd, By curst Almanzor made to be bereav'd Oth' Spoils of such a wicked Victory, As Lust had then near conquerd, fiercely he Assails the noble stranger, who detesting, An Act so full of Villany, and resting On the firm justce of his Cause, had made His guiltless Sword as ready to invade, As was the others that had surfeited, In blood before. Here equal Valour bred In both a doubtfull hope, Almanzors Lust Had fierd his Courage, which Argalias just Attempts did strive to quench. The thirsty steel Had drunk some blood from both, ere Fortunes Wheel Turnd to the righteous Cause; that Vigor which Through rivolets of Veins spread the salt Itch
feaverish Lust before, was turnd into flame of anger  whilst his hands did do, What Rage doth dictate, Fury doth assist, With flaming Paroxismes, and each Nerve twist, Into a double strength: yet not that flood Which in this ebullition of his blood Did through the Channels boyl, till they run o're. With flaming spirits, could depress that store Of manly worth, which in Argalias breast Did with a quiet even Valor rest; Moving as in its naturall Orb, unstraind any violent motion, nor yet chaind By lazy damps of faint mistrust, but in Dangers extream, still confident to win A noble Victory, or ith' loss of breath, I his Fate frownd to find an honourd death. Fil'd with these brave Resolves, until the heat Of their warm Fury, had Alarmes beat. th' neighbouring fields they fought, which tumult by Such of Almanzors Followers, as were nigh The Grove repos'd, with an astonishment, That rouzd them heard, they hasten to prevent, The sad effects that might this Cause ensue. re more of danger then their fear they knew; Arriv'd even with that fatal Minute, he Who against Justice strove for Victory, With such faint stroaks, that their descent did give ought but assurance that his Foe must live, happy Conquerour, they usurp the power Heaven (revenge) and in a dreadfull shower danger with their Furies torrent strive, orewhelm the Victor; but the foremost drive
Their own destruction on, and fall beneath His conquering Sword, ere he takes time to breath Those spirits which, when neer with Action ti'd, Valor breahd fresh, fast as the spent expir'd. Here rash Araspes, and bold Leovine, Two, whose descent ith' nearst collateral Line, Unto Almanzors stood, beholding how His strength decyd, must unto Conquest bow, In spight of Valor, to revenge his fate, VVith so much hast attempt, as if too late Theyd come to rescue, and would now to shun Tis just reproof, by rashness strive to run To death before him, finding from that Sword Their Lifes discharge, which did to him afford Only those wounds, whose fears must live to be The badges of eternal Infamy. But here ore-whelmd by an nnequal strength, The noble Victor soon to th' utmost length, Had lifes smal thread extended, if not in The dawn of hope, some troops whose charge had bin, VVhilst th' active Gentry did attend the Court, To free the Country from the feard Resort Of wild Bandeets, these being directed by Such frighted Rurals, as imployment nigh The Grove had led, arriving at that time, VVhen his slain Foes made the mistaken Crime Appear Argalias, soon by power allay That fatal storm, which done, a full survay Of them that death freed from distress being took, Them through whose wounds life had not yet forsook, Her Throne they view, 'mongst whom through the disguise O's blood Almanzor, whose high power they prise
More then discover'd Innocence, being found, As Justice had by close decree been bound, T' espouse his quarrels, whilst his friends convay Him safely thence, those ponderous Crimes they lay Unto Agalias Charge, whose just defence, Pleads but in vain, for injur'd innocence. Now neer departing, whilst his helpfull friends, Bore off Almanzor, where he long attends The cure of's wounds, though they less torment bred, Then to behold how his lost honour bled; The sad Florenza comes to take her last Leave of her lost Andremon, ere she past That sad stage ore, to his cold clammy Lips Joyning her balmy Twins, she from them sips, So much of deaths oppressing Dews, that by That touch reviv'd his soul, though wing'd to flie Her ruin'd seat, takes time enough to breath These sad notes forth; farewell my Dear, beneath The ponderous burthen of mortality, My fainting spirits sink. Oh mayst thou be, Blest in a happier Love; all that I crave, Is that my now departing soul may have Thy Virgin prayers for her Companions through Those gloomy Vaults, which she must pass unto Eternall shades; had Fate assign'd my stay, Till we'd together gone, the horrid way Had then been made delightfull, but I must Depart without thee, and convert to dust, VVhilst thou art flesh and blood; I in a cold Dark Une must lie, whilst a warm Groom doth hold Thee in thy Nuptial bed, yet there I shall, If fled souls know what doth on earth befall,
Mourn for thy loss, and to eternity Wander alone; the various World shall be Refin'd in flames, time shall afford no place For Vanity, ere I again embrace Society with flesh, which ere that must Change to a thousand forms her varied dust. What we shall be, or whither we shall go, When gone from hence, wheth'r unto flames below, Or joyes above, or whether in death we may Know our departed friends, or tell which way They went before us, these, oh these are things That pauze our Divinity; Scepterd Kings, And Subjects die alike, nor can we tell, Which doth enjoy, or which in torments dwell. Oh sad, sad ignorance, Heaven guide me right, Or I shall wander in eternal Night; To whose dark shades my dim eyes sink apace: Farewel Florenza, when both time and place, My separated Soul hath left to be A stranger maskt in Immortality. Think on thy murtherd friend, we now must part Eternaly, the Cordage of my heart That last sigh broke, with that the breath that long Had hoverd in his Breast, flew with a strong Groan from that mortal Mansion, which beheld By such of's friends, whom Courtesie compel'd To that sad Charge, the bloodless body they With sad slow steps to's Fathers home convey. The end of the second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The first Book. CANTO THE THIRD. The ARGUMENT. V. The brave Argalia, who dsign'd to raise Through all approaching ills his weighty Fate, In smooth Compliance that harsh Guard obeys Who tow'rd his death did prosecute their hate: VI. To death, which here unluckily had staind, Maugre his friends, the ill directed Sword Of Justice, had not secret love obtaind More mercy then the strict Laws dare afford. LOw in a fruitful Pasture, where his Flocks Cloud with their breath those Plains, whose leavy lock▪ Could hardly shadow them, though Meadows need No shearing, where in untold Droves did feed
His bellowing Heards, of which enough did come, Each day to's Yoak to serve a Hecatombe; Lay old Andenons Country Farm, in which (Happy til now) being made by Fortune rich, And Goodness honest, from domestick strife, Stil calm and free, the upper Robes of Life; Til witherd he had worn, to ease whose sad And sullen Cares, less bounteous Nature had Lent him no numerous Issue, all he'd won By prayer confin'd unto this murtherd Son: The blasted Blossome of whose tender age, When blooming first, taught Hope how to presage Those future Vertues, which interpreted By Action had such fruitful Branches spread, That all indulgent Parents wisht to be Immortalizd in blest Posterity, Had seen in him, whose innocently good, Stil let his Heart by's Tongue be understood, In such a sacred Dialect, that all Which verg'd within deliberate thought did fall, Towards Heaven was grac'd, and in descent did prove To's Parents Duty, and to's Neighbours Love. This hopeful Youth, their Ages chief support, Whose absence though by's own desires made short; Their Love thought tedious, having now expir'd His usual hours, the aged Couple tir'd With expectation, to anticipate His slow appearance to their Mansions Gae; Where softly walk'd, where cooly shadowed by An Elm, which planted at his Birth did vie Age with his Lord, whilst their desires pursue Its first design, they with some pleasure view
Their busie Servants, whose industrious pain Sweats out Diseases in pursuit of gain. All which, although the chiefest pleasure that Their thoughts contain, whose best are busied at The Mart oth' World, such small diversion lent The aged pair, that his kind Mother spent, With a too long protracted hope had let Even that expire, had not his Father set Props to that weakness, and that mutuall fear, Which fil'd their breasts, let his sound Judgment clear By the proposing Accidents that might Untouchd detaine their Darling from their sight. But many Minutes had not left their seals, On the Records of Time, ere truth reveals Her horrid secrets. A confused noise First strikes their Ears, which suddenly destroys Its own imperfect Embrioes, to transfer Its Object to that nearer Messenger Oth' Soul, the Eyes whose beamy Scouts convey A trembling fear into their Souls, whilst they That bore their murtherd Son, arriv'd to tel Their doleful Mssage, which so fierce storm fel Not long in those remoter drops, before Sweld to a Deluge, the swift Torrent bore The bays of Reason down, and in one flood Drownd all their hopes, when purpl'd in his blood Yet pale with death, untimely Death, she saw Her hopeful Son, grief violates the Law Of slower Nature, and his Mothers tears In death congeals to Marble, her swoln fears, Grown for her Sex a burthen far too great Had only left death for her dark retreat.
Although from griefs so violent effects, Reason conjoynd with manly strength protects His wretched Father, at that stroke his Limbs Sack their unweildy Nerves, faint sorrow dims His Eyes more then his Age, his hands bereft His hoary head of all that time had left Unpluckt before, nor had th' expecting Grave, Gap'd longer for him, if they then had gave His passion freedome, his own guilty hand Had broke the Glass, and shook that little Sand That yet remaind, into thin Aire, that so Unclog'd with earth, his tortur'd Ghost might go Beyond that Ob of Attomes that attend Mortality, and at that Iournies end, Meet theirs soon, as swift Destiny inrouls Those new come Guests within the sphear of Souls. By these sad symptomes of infectious grief, Those best of friends that came for the relief Of sorrows Captives, being by that surprizd They hop'd to conquer, sadly sympathizd With him in wo, till th' epedemick Ill, Stifling each Voice, drest sorrow in a still And dismal silence, in which sad aspect, None needing Robes, or Cypress to detect A Funeral March, each dolefully attends To deaths dark Mansion, their lamented friends, Where having now the earthy Curtain drawn O're their cold Bed, till Doomsdaies fatal dawn, Rally their dust they, leave them, and retire To sorrow, which can ne're hope to expire In just revenge, since kept by fear in aw Where power offends, the poor scarce hope for Law,
By sad example to confirm this truth, From innocent and early hopes of youth; Led tow'rd destruction, let's return to see That noble stranger, whose captivity, Like an unlucky Accident depends On this sad subject. By the angry friends Of those accus'd, which in that fatal strife, To death resign'd the Charter of their life, He's brought unto the Princes Pallace, where That age, whose Customes knew not how to bear Such Sails, as these have fil'd with pride, was plac'd The seat of Justice, whose stern Sword defac'd Not pleasures smoothest Front, since now twas by Her fair hand guided, whose commanding eye, If armd with Anger, seemd more dreadful then The harshest Law ere made by wrathful men. Here strictly guarded, til th' important Crime Which urg'd her to anticipate the time, By Custome known, had cal'd her forth to that Unwilling Office: stil unstartled at The frowns of danger, did Argalia lie An injur'd Captive, til commanded by The stern Reformers of offended Law, He hasts to th' Bar, where come, though death nere saw A Brow more calm, or Breast more confident, To meet his Darts: yet since the innocent Are staind with guilt, when in contempt of Fate, They silent fal, he means to meet their hate, With all that each Beholder could expect, From dying Valor, when 't had to protect An envied stranger left no more defence, But what their hate obscures, his Innocence,
The clamorous friends of Aphron, backt by those Which knew his death the only mean to close Almanzors bleeding honour, to the fair And pitiful Pharonnida repair, With cries of Vengeanc, whose unwelcom sound She by her Fathers strickt command was bound To hear, since that those rivolets of Law, Which from the Sea of regal power did draw Their several streams, all flowd to her, and in That chrystal Fountain pure as they had bin From Heaven dispens'd, ere just Astrea fled The Earth remaind, yet such aversion bred In her soft soul, that to these Causes where The Law sought blood, slowly as those that bear The weight of Guilt, she came, whose dark Text she Stil Comments on with noble Charitie. High mounted on an Ebbon Throne, in which, Th' imbellisht Silver shewd so sadly rich, As if its varied form strove to delight Those solemn souls, which Deaths pale fear did fright; In Tyrian Purple clad, the Princess sate, Between two sterner Ministers of Fae, Impartial Judges, whose distinguisht tasks Their varied habits to the view unmasks, One, in whose looks, as pity strove to draw Compassion in the Tables of the Law, Some softness dwelt in a magestick Vest Of state-like red was cloathd, the other drest In dismall black, whose terrible Aspect, Declard his Office, serv'd but to detect Her slow consent, if when the first forsook The Cause, the Law so far as death did look.
Silence proclaimd, a harsh Command cals forth Th' undaunted Prisoner, whose excelling wroth, In this low ebb of Fortune did appear, Such as we fancy, Vertues that come near The excellence of Angels; fear had not Rifl'd one drop of blood, nor rage begot More colour in his Cheeks, his soul in state, Thron'd in the Medium, constant Vertue sate Not sleighting with the impious Atheists, that Loud storm of danger, but safe anchord at Religious hope, being firmly confident, Heaven would relieve, whom Earth knew innocent. All thus prepard, he hears his wrongfull Charge, (Envie disguizing injur'd Truth) at large, Before the people, in such Language read, As checkt their hopes, in whom his worth had bred Some seeds of pity, and to those whose hate Pursu'd him to this Precipice of Fate, (Dead Aphrons friends) such an advantage gave, That Providence appeard too weak to save, One so assaulted; yet, though now deprest, Even in opinion, which oft proves the best Support to those, whose publick Vertues we Adore, before their private guilt we see▪ His noble Soul stil wings it self above Passions dark Fogs, and like that prosperous Dove, The Worlds first Pilot, for discovery sent, When all the floods that bound the Firmament, Ore-whelmd the Earth, Conscience calm joys t' encrease, Returns fraight with the Olive Branch of Peace. Thus fortifi'd from all, that tyrant fear E'reawed the Guilty with, he doth appear,
The Courts just wonder in the brave defence Of what, though power, armd with the strong pretence Of right opposd, so prevalent had been, T' have cleard him, if, when neer triumphing in Victorious truth to cloud that glorious Sun, Some faithless Swains, by large Rewards being won To spot their souls, had not corrupted by His Foes been brought, falsly to justifie, Their Accusations, which beheld by him Whose knowledge now did hopes clear Opticks dim; He ceas'd to plead, justly despairing then, That Innocence 'mongst Mortals rested, when Banisht her owne Abode; so thinks it vain To let truths naked Armes strive to maintain The Field 'gainst his more powerful Foes; not all His Vertues now protect him, he must fall A guiltless Sacrifice, to expiate No other Crime, but their invenomd hate. An ominous silence, such as oft precedes The fatal sentence, whilst th' Accuser reades His Charge, possest the pitying Court, in which Preaging Calm, Pharonnida too rich In mercy (Heavens supream Prerogative) To stifle tears did with her passion strive So long, til what at first assaulted in Sorrows black Armor had so often bin For pity cherisht, that at length her eyes Found there those Spirits that did sympathize With those that warmd her blood, and unseen move That Engine of the World, mysterious Love, The way that Fate predestinated, when Twas first infus'd ith' Embrio, it being then
That which espousd the active forme unto Matter, and from that passive being drew, Divine Ideas, which subsisting in Harmonious Natures highest sphear, do win In the perfection of our Age, a more Expansive power, and Natures common store Stil to preserve, unites Affections by The mingled Attomes of the serious eye. Whilst Natures Priest, the cause of each effect, Miscal'd Disease indeavou to detect Its unacquainted operations in The beauteous Princess, whose free soul had bin Yet guarded in her Virgin Ice, and now A stranger is, to what she doth allow Such easie entrance, by those Rays that fall From eithers eyes, to make reciprocal Their yeilding passions, brave Argalia felt (Even in the grasp of death) his Functions melt To flames, which on his heart an on-set make, For sadness such as weaker Mortals take Eternal farewels in, yet in this high Tyde of his blood, in a soft calm to die; His yielding Spirits, now prepare to meet Death, cloathd in thoughts, white as his winding sheet. That fatal doom, which unto Heaven affords The sole Appeal, one of th' assisting Lords Had now pronouncd, whose horrid thunder could Not strike his Laureld Brow, that Voice which would Have putrified, a timerous Soul he hears With calm attention, no disorderd fears Ruffl'd his Fancy, nor domestick War Rag'd in his breast, his v'ry look so far
From vulgar passions, that, unless amazd At Beauties Majesty he sometimes gazd Wildly on that, as Emblems of more great Glories then earth afforded, from the seat Of resolution, his fixt soul had not Been stird to passion, which had now begot Wonder, not fear within him. No harsh frown Contracts his Brow, nor did his thoughts pull down One fainting spirit, wrapt in smootherd groans, To clog his heart. From her most eminent Thrones Of Sense, the Eyes, the lightning of his Soul Flew with such vigour, forth it did controul All weaker passions, and at once include, With Roman Valour, Christian Fortitude. Pharonnida, from whom the rigid Law Extorts his Fate, being now inforc'd to draw The longest Line she ere could hope to move Over his Face, that beauteous sphear of Love, Unto its great'st obliquity, she leaves Him in his winter solstice, and bereaves Loves Hemisphear of light, not hear, yet oft Retreating wisht those Stars Fare plac'd aloft In the first Magnitude of Honour might Prove retrograde, so their contracted light Might unto him part of their Influence In Life bestow, Passion would fain dispence So far with Reason, to recall again The sentence she had past, but hop'd in vain, Those false suggestions moves, his Jaylers are Th' undaunted Prisoner hurrying from the Bar; His fair Judge rising, the corrupted Court Upon removing, all the ruder sort
Of Hearers rushing out, when through the throng, Kind Ariamnes (being detaind so long By strict Imployment comes) at whose request, The Court their Seats resuming, he adrest Himself to th' Princess, in a Language that Whilst all Argalias Foes were storming at, Even on her Justice so prevails, that he Repriev'd, til all, hope could produce to free Her Loves new care might be examind by His active Friend, who now being seated nigh Pharonnide, whilst all attentive sate; The strangers story doth at large relate. Pleas'd at this full relation, nere as much As griev'd to see those Jewels plac'd in such A course cheap Mettal, which could never hold The least proportion with her regal Gold. Pharonnida had now remov'd, if not Thus once more stayed, the Rumor first bego; From this sad truth, had with the common hast, Of Ill arriv'd, where his Disease had plac'd Aphron, whose Ears assaulted now with words Of more infection then that Plague affords Room for the stonger Passion: though offended, To leave a hold it had, at first intended To keep til ruin'd, the imprisond blood, And spirits are unfetterd, by that flood To wash usurping grief from off that part Where most she reign'd, but they drawn near the heart, And finding Enemies too strong to be, Incounter'd mix in their society; Which thus supplyed with Auxiliaries in Contempt of weakness, when he long had been
Languishing underneath a tedious Load Of sickness, sends him from his safe Aboad; 'Mongst dangers which in deaths black shape attend His bold design, to seek his honourd Friend. Come on the spur of passion to the Court, A flux of Spirits from all parts resort, To prompt his anger, which abruptly broke Forth in this Language. Do not Sirs, provoke A forrein power thus far (I speak to you, That have condemnd this stranger) as to do An Act so opposite to all the Law, Of Nations, here within your Realm to draw Blood that's so neer allied unto the best Of an adjacent State. If this request Of mine, too full of insolence appear, We are Spirits nobly born, and near Enough to hav't, whatever Crime's the Cause Of this harsh sentence, tri'd by our own Laws. This bold Opposer of stern Justice, here Pausing to see what Clouds there did appear In that fair Heaven, whose influence only now Could light to's friends declining Stars allow, To free the troubl'd Court, which struggl'd i A strange Delemma had commanded bin, To a more large discovery, if not by His pitying Friend, discharg'd in a reply, Doubting how far inregular boldness had Provok'd just wrath, Argalia thus unclad Amezements dark disguise. To you that a This Court (with that kneels to Pharonnida) I now for Mercy flee, that scorn to run From my own doom, so I might have begun
The doubtful task alone, but here to leave My Friend from whom your Justice did receive This bold Afront in danger, is a Crime That not approaching death, which all my time Too little for repentance cals, can be A just excuse for, let me then set free His person with your doubts, and joynd to those What both their varied stories may compose. For what this noble Lord, whose goodness we, First found in needful hospitality, From him hath differd him, impute it not To eithers error, both Reports begot From such mistakes, as Nature made to be The careful Issues of Necessity; That fatal difference, whose Vestigia stood Where we Epiciae left fresh fil'd with blood; By league so lately with Calabria made, Being compos'd, that Fame did not invade Our Ears with the report, til we had been By a disguise secur'd, which shaded in Whilst fearing danger we nere thought to leave, Til safe at home; Thus what did first deceive Kind Aminander you have heard, and now Without the stein of boasting must allow Me leave to tel you, that we there have Friends, On whom the burthen of a State depends, When to the Court just wonder, thus far he, With such unshaken confidence as we Pray on th' expanded wings of Faith, displayed His Souls integrity, the Royal Maid, Whom a repented destiny had made His pitying Judge, endeavouring to evade
That dooms harsh rigour, grants him a reprieve, Till thrice the Sun returning to relieve Nights drooping Sentinels had circl'd in So many days, in which short time to win The fair advantage of discovering truth, Old Aminander, active as fresh Youth In all Attempts of Charity, to know, From what black Spring those troubled streams did flow: Hasts toward Andremons, whi'st Pharonnida Active as he, toward all, whence she might draw A consequence of hope, layes speedy hold On this design, Commission'd to unfold Their Masters Love toward her, there long had been Embassadours from the Epicote in Her Fathers Court, whose Message though it might Wear Loves pure Robes, yet in her Reasons light, Seems so much staind with pollicy, that all Those blessings which the wise foresaw to fall, As Influence from that Conjunction, she Opposes as her stars malignity. Proud of this new Command, with such a hast, As those that fear more slow delays may wast Their pretious time, th' Ambassadours attain The Princess Court, where come, though hope in vain, Only expect a speedy Audience, they That frustrated, are soon taught to betray More powerful passions; the first glance oth' eye They on the Prisoners cast, kind sympathy, Proclaim'd Love gave no leave for time to rust Their Memories, both the old Lords durst trust Eyes dim'd with tears, whilst their embraces give A sad assurance there did only live
Their last and best of Comforts, which beheld, By those from whom kind pity had expeld All thoughts of the vindictive Law, they strive By all the power of Rhetorick to drive Those sad storms over, which good Office done, They each inform the Prince, which was the Son Of Nature, which Adoption, withall tel how By their perswasions mov'd, they did allow Them time to travel, which Disasters had So long protracted, for some years with sad And doubtfull hopes, they had in vain expected Their wisht return, but that their stars directed Their course so ill, as now near home to be Ore-taken with so sad a destiny; Since such a sorrow could be cur'd by none, They sadly crave the time to mourn alone. The end of the third Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The first Book. CANTO THE FOURTH. The ARGUMENT. VII. At length the Vail from the deluded Law with active Care by Aminander took, The startl'd Court in their own error saw How lovely truth did in Argalia look. VIII. The story of our Youth discover'd, he His Merits yet in higher pitch to raise Morea's Prince doth from a danger free, Which unto death his noblest Lords betray. THat last sad Night, the rigid Law did give The late repriev'd Argalia leave to live; Was now wrapt in her own obscurity, toln from the Stage of Time, when light got free
From his Nocturnall Prison summons all Almanzors Friends, to see the long'd for fall Oth' envied stranger, whose last hour was now So neer arriv'd, faint hope could not allow So much of comfort to his powerfulst friend, As told her fears, she longer might suspend His fatall doom. Mournful Attendants on That serene Sufferer, all his friends are gon Unto the sable Scaffold that's ordain'd By the decree of Justice to be stain'd With guiltless blood, all sunk in grief, but she Whom by inevitable destiny, Doom'd him to death, most deep. Dul sorrow raigns In her triumphant, sad and alone remains She in a Room, whose Windows prospect led Her Eye to th' Scaffold, whither from the Bed Where sorrow first had cast her, she did oft Repair to see him, but her passions soft Temper soon melting into Tears, denies Her Soul a passage through o're-flowing Eyes. Often she would in vain expostulate With those (two subtile) Sophisters that Sate Cloath'd in the Robes of Fancy, but they still Oe-threw her weaker Arguments, and fill Her Breast with Love and Wonder, passion gave Such fierce Assaults, no Virgin Vow could save Her Hearts surrender, she must love, and loose In one sad hour, thus grief doth oft infuse Those bitter , where hidden poyson dwell, In the smooth pleasures of swee Oximel. Argalias friends that did this minute use, As if the last of mortal enterviews
Had now reverst their eyes, expecting nought But that stroaks fall, whole faall speed had brought Him to eternal rest; when by a loud And busie tumult, as if death grown proud Expected triumphs, to divert their sight, They from the Scaffolds lofty station might Within the reach of an exalted Voice, Behold a Troop, who as the Leaders choice Confin'd to staight necessity, had there Inrold all Commers, if of strength to bear Offensive Ames, did first appear to be Some tumult drest in the variety Of suddain rage, for here come headlong in A heard of Clowns, armd as they then had been From labour cal'd, near them (wel orderd rie) (As greatness strove no longer to divide Societies, (sme Youths, brave as they had Been in the spoils of conquerd Nations clad. This sudden Object, first obstructing all Their Courts proceedings, prompts their doubts to call Their absent Prince, who being too wise for fears Uncertain fixions, with such speed appears, As checks the tumult, when, to tel them who Had from their homes the frighted people drew, Ith' Van of a wel-orderd Troop rides forth Lov'd Aminander, whose unquestiond worth, That strong Attractive of the peoples love, Exspung'd suspition; whilst his Troops did move With a commanded slowness to inform, Th' expecting Prince, from whence this suddain storm Contracted Clouds, he to his view presents Andremons Friends, whose looks the sad contents
Of sorrow, with a silent Oratory, Begs pity; whilst, he thus relates their story. That we (great Prince) we, whom a loyal fear To strict obedience prompts, dare thus appear Before your sacred Person, were a sin Mercy would blush to own, had we not been Forc'd to offensive Armes, by such a Cause As tore the Scepter, regulated Laws, Forth of your royal hand, to vindicate This suffering stranger, whom a subtle hate, Not solemn Law, pursu'd. I here have brought Such Witnesses as have their knowledge bought, At the expence of all their joy, whom I Found so confin'd, as if their misery Were in their houses sepulcherd, a sad And general sorrow in one Dress had clad So many, that their only sight did prove Lost Vertue caus'd such universal love To free this noble Youth, whose Valour lent A late protection to this Innocent, But injur'd, Maid, they (unconstraind) had here Implor'd your Aide, had not too just a fear Caus'd from some Troops, raisd by a wrong'd pretence Of your Commands checkt their intelligence, With such illegal violence, that I Had shar'd their sufferings, if not rescu'd by These following Friends, whose rude Conjunction shews It was no studied plot did first compose So loose a body; but, least it appear In me like envy, should I strive to clear This doubtful story, here are those (with that) Cals forth Andremons Friends, instructed at
The dearest price, which by discovering truth, Will not alone rescue this noble Youth, From falling ruine; but least he retreat Into rebellion, force before this fear, A man whose power, the people thought had bin To punish Vice, not propagate a sin. Having thus far past toward discovery, here The grave Lord ceast, and that truth might appear, From its first fair Original, to her (Whose Vertue Heavens affected Messenger) Commands Attention, the more horrid part Of his relation leaves: And here vain Art Took on, and envy, to behold how far Thy strickt Rules (which our Youths Afflictions are) Nature transcends, in a Discourse which she, With all the Flowers of Virgin modesty, Not Weeds of Rhetorick strew'd; to hear her miss, Or put a blush for a Parenthesis, In the relating that uncivil strife, Which her sad Subject was, so near the life, Lims lovely Vertue, that that Copy whence, Ar took those Graces, she doth sice dispence To th' best of women, fair Pharonnida, Taght by that sympathy, which first did draw Those lovely Transcripts of her sel, although Varied as much as humble Flowers that grow, Dispiers'd in shady Desarts, are from thoe That nice Art in enameld Gardens shews, Yet like bright Planets, which communicate To Earth their Influence, from exalted state, She now descends, to cherish Vertue in Those lovely Nimphs, whose Beauties though they'd bin
Yet in the Country clouded from Report, Soon grow the praise, or envy of the Court. Imboldned by that gracious favour shewn To these fair Nymphs, to prosecute their own Most just Complaints, Andremons wretched friends, With prayers perceive that Mercy which descends O're all their sufferings, on th' expanded Wings Of noble pitty, whose fair hand first brings Argalia from the sable Scaffold, to Meet those Rewards to his high Merits due, Not only in what deaths dark progress staies, But Life's best joy, an universal praise Aquir'd from just desert: Next she applies Her self to those poor burthend Souls, whose Eyes Look (even on Comforts) through their tears, the dead Andremons Mourners, whose lst Joy though fled For ever from those wintring Regions, yet As much receiv'd as sorrow would permi, Souls so opprest, the splendid Court they leave, With thankful prayers; And now, cal'd to receive His sins reward Almanzor is, whose shame Its black Attendant, when by his haed Name He'd oft been summond, prompts him to deny That legal Call, which being an Act too high For a depending power to patroniz, To shun feard Justice publick doom, he flies His Princes Mandates, an affront that sent Him to's desert, perpetual banishment. This Comet lost in clouds of Infamy, The Court which had too long been burthend by His injur'd power, with praises entertain Impartial Justice, whilst to call again
Those pleasures which had in this interval Of Law been lost, the Prince convening all, That shar'd those sufferings, as the Center whence Joy spread it self, to th' Courts circumference, Crowns all their wishes, which by that bright Star In Honours Sphear, th' auspitious Princes are Exalted to their highest Orbs; her Love Unto Argalia, though it yet must move, As an unnoted Constellation, here Begins its Erae, which that might appear Without suspition, she disguises in The publick joy, which 'mongst those that had bin His serious Mourners to participate That kind Epicote, who first taught his Fate, The way to Glory comes, to whom he now Was on those Knees Merit had taught to bow, With as much humble reverence, as if all The Waights of Nature made those burthens fall A Sacrifice to Love, fixt to implore Its constant Progress, but he needs no more For confirmation, since his Friend could move But the like joy, where Nature taught to love. Passions encounter, which too high to last, Into a calm of thankful prayers being past The Prince from the Calabrian seeks to know By what collateral streams he came to owe Such love unto a stranger, one that stood Remov'd from him ith' Magnetisme of blood; Whom thus the Lord resolves, When blooming in The pride of Youth, whose varied Sceans did win Time on the Morning of my dayes, a while To tast the pleasures of a Summers Smile,
I left the Courts tumulteous noise, and spent Some happy time, blest with retir'd content, In the calm Country, where Arts curious hand, As Center to a spatious Round of Land, Had plac'd a Palace, in whose lovely Dress, The City might admire the Wilderness, Yet though that ill Civility was in Her marble Circle; Natures hand had bin As liberall to the neighbouring Fields, and dect Each rural Nimph as gaudy, til neglect, Or slovenly Necessity had drawn Her Canvass Furroughs o're their Vails of Lawn: Near this fair Seat, fring'd with an ancient Wood, A fertile Valley lay, where scatter'd stood Some homely Cottages, the happy Seats Of labouring Swains, whose careful Toil compleats Their wishes in obtaining so much Wealth, To conquer dire Necessiy; firm health, Calm thoughts, sound sleeps, unstarted innocence, Softn'd their Beds, and when rouz'd up from thence, Suppl'd their Limbs for Labour; amongst these, My lov'd Argalia, for till Fate shall please, His dim Stars to uncurtain, and salute His better Fortune, with each Attribute, Due to a nobler Birth, his Name must be Contracted unto that Stenography, Life's Sceans began, amongst his Fellows that There first drew breath, being true Heirs to what Whilst all his Stars were retrograde, and dim, Unlucky Fortune, but adopted him; Whilst there residing, I had oft beheld The active Boy, whose Childhoods Bud exceld
More ful blown Youths, gleaning the scatterd Loc Of new-shorn Fields, amongst the half-clad Flocks, Of their unripe, but healthful Issue, by Which Labour tir'd, sometimes I see them try The strength of their scarce twisted Limbs, and run A short breathd Course, whose swift contention done, And he (as in each other active port) With Vict'ry crownd, they make their next resort To th' Springs cheap Bounties; but, what did of all His first Attempts, did give the powerful call, Both to my Love and Wonder was, what chanc'd From one rare Act: the Morning had advanc'd Her tempting Beauties to assure success To these young Huntsmen, who with Labour less Made by the pleasure of their Journey had The Forest reacht, where with their Limbs unclad For the pursuit, they follow Beasts that might Abroad be recreation, and when Night Summond them home, the welcomest supply Both to their own, and Parents quality. An angry Boar, chaft with a Mornings chase, And now near spent, was come so neer the place, Where (though secur'd) on the stupendious height Of a vast Rock they stood, that now no flight Could promise safety, that wild rage which sent Him from the Dogs, his following Foes, is spnt In the pursuit of them, which (to my grief, Had sufferd ere we could have lent relief, Hd not Argalia, even when danger drew So near as death, turnd on the Beast, and threw His happy Javelin, whose wel guided aime, Although success it knew not how to claime,
From strength, yet is so much assisted by Fortune, that what before had scornd to dy, By all our power, when contending in Nice Art, the honour of that day to win To him alone, fals by that feeble stroke, From all his speed; which seen, he, to provoke His hastier death, seconds those wounds, which in Their safety are, by those with terrour seen, That had escapt the danger, and even by Us that pursu'd with such amaze, that I Who had before observ'd those Rays of worth, Obscur'd in clouds, here let my love break forth In useful Action, such, as from that low Condition brought him, where I might bestow On him what Art requir'd, to perfect that Rre piece of Nature, which we wonderd at, From those whom I ('mongst others) thought to be Such whose Affection, the proximity Of Nature claimd, with a regret that shewd, Their poverty unwillingly bestowd So lov'd a Jewel, had procur'd the Youth, His Foster Father, loath to wave a truth, That in the progress of his Fate might be Of high account, discovers unto me The worlds mistake concerning him, and thus Relate his story, He was brought to us, (Quoth the good man) some ten years since, by two VVho (could men be discoverd to the view Of knowledge by their Habits) seemd but such As Fortunes narrow hand had gave not much More then Necessiy requires to be, Injoyd of every man, whom Life makes free
Of Natures City; though their bounty shewed, To our him judgments, that they only owed Mischance for those course Habits, which disguiz'd, What once the World at higher rates had priz'd, Ith' worst extream of time, about the birth Oth' fluggish Morning, when the crusted earth Was tinsel'd o're with Frost, and each Sprig clad With Winters Wool, I whom cross Fortune had Destin'd to early Labours, being abroad, Met two benighted men, far from the Road, Wandring alone, no skilful Guide their way Directing in that Infancy of day; But the faint beams of glimmering Candles, that Shon from our lovely Cottage-Windows, at Which Marks they steerd their Course; one of them bore This Boy, an Infant then, which knew no more Then Natures untrod pathes. These having spi'd Me through the Mornings Mists, glad of a Guide, Though to a place, whose superficial view, Lent smal hopes of relief, went with me to Mine own poor home, where with such course cheap Fare, As must content us, that but eat to bear The burthens of a Life refresht, they take A short repose, then being to forsake Their new-found Hoast, desire with us to leave The Child, til time should some few daies bereave Of the Habiliments of Light. We stood Not long to parl, but willing to do good To strangers so distrest, were never by Our poverty once tempted to deny. My wife (being then a Nurse) upon her takes The pretty Charge, and with our own Son makes
Him Fellow-commoner at the ful Brest, And Partner of the Cradles quiet rest. Now to depart, one that did seem to have The nearst relation to the Infant, gave Him first this Jewel (at which word they shewed One which upon Argalia was bestowed By those that left him) then that we might be Not straightned by our former poverty; Leave us some Gold, by which we since have bin Enabl'd to maintain him, though not in That Equipage, which we presume unto His birth (although to us unknown) is due. This done, with Eyes that lost their light in Tears, They take their leaves, since when, those daies to years Are grown, in which we did again expect They should return; but whether be neglect Or else impossibility detain Tem from his sight, our care hath sought in vain. Having thus plainly heard as much as Fate Had yet of him discoverd, I, that late Desir'd him for his own, now for the sake Of's Friends (what ere they were) resolv'd to take Him from that barren rudeness, and transplant So choice a Slip, where he might know no want Of Education; with some labour, I Having obtaind him, til virility, Rendred him fit for nobler Action, stayed Him alwaies with me, when, my Love obayed His Reason, and, then in the quest of what Confin'd Domesticks do but stumble at Exotick knowledge, with this noble Youth, To whom his Love grew linckt, like spotless truth,
To perfect Vertue, sent him to pursue His wisht design, from whence this interview, First took its fatal Rise, and here the Lord That a more ful discov'ry might afford Them yet more wonder, shews the Jewel to Sparta's pleas'd Prince, at whoes most serious view, The skilfulst Lapidaries judging it, Both for its worth and beauty only fit To sparkle in the glorious Cabinet Of some great Queen, such value on it set, That all conclude the honour on' must be, Some falling Star ith' Night of Royaltie, From Honours sphear, the Glories of a Crown, To vaunt (the center of our Fears) dropt down. And now the Court, whose brightest splendor in These fatal Changes, long eclips'd had been, Resumes its luster, wich to elevate, With all the pleasures of a prosperous state, For that contracted span of time design'd, For th' Princes stay, Fancies are wrackt to find New forms of Mirth, such, whose Invention might Inform the Ear, whilst they the Eye delight. All which, whilst to the less concernd they lent A flux of joy, yet lost their first intent, To please the Princess, who from mirth did move Excentrical, since first iuflm'd with Love, Which did soon from Fancies Embrion grow, A large limbd Tyrant, when prepard to go, She sees Argalia, who engag'd t' attend Th' Embassadors, here soon had put an end To what, even from, those unto Love unkind, Must now force tears ere it a period find.
That time expir'd, ordaind to terminate Her Fathers stay, and so that splendid state, That yet adornd the Princess Court, to shew, How much he did for's Frontiers safety ow, Unto those moving Cittadels, a Fleet His Mandates cals each Squadron for to meet Within Lepanto, in whose harborous Lay, Those Ships that were ordaind for a Convay To the Calabrians Messengers, who now With all that Love, or Honour could allow To noble strangers, being attended by The brightest Glorys of two Courts, draw nigh A royal Fleet, whose glittering streamers lent Dul Waves the beauties of a Firmament: Amongst which numbers, one, too stately far For rough Encounters of defacing War, VVhose gilded Masts their crimson Sails had spread In silken Flakes, advanc'd her stately head, High as where Clouds condense, where a Light stands, Took for a Comet by far distant Lands, For Cabbins where th' imprisond Passenger VVants Aire to breath, she's stor'd with Rooms that were So fair without, and yet so large within, A Persian Sophy might have reveld in Their spatious bulks. To this Molarchus, he VVhom greatness joynd to known Ability, Had made Sicillia's Admiral, invights The Royal Train, where with what ere delights, (Although Invention all her stock had spent) Could be upon that liquid Element, Prepard their welcome, whilst at every Bowl A Health inters, the ful-mouthd Cannons trowl
A Peal of Thunder, which in white Waves drownd The softer Trumpets do their Dirges sound. Now in the ful Carier of Mirth, whilst all Their thoughts in Perpendiculars did fall From Honours Zenith; none incurvated With common Cares, Parents that might have bred A sly suspition, whilst neglective Mirth Keeps all within from their deep bed of Earth Molarchus hoist his Anchors, whilst that all The rest lay stil, expecting when his call Commands their Service, but when they beheld, His spread Sails with a nimble Gale were sweld: An opprest Slave, which lay at rest before, Was with stretcht Limbs tugging his Finny ore; Conceiving it but done, to shew the Prince That Gallies swiftness, let that thought convince Fears weak suggestions, and invited by Their tempting Mirth, stil safe at Anchor ly. But now, when they not only saw the Night Draw sadly on, but what did more afright Their loyal Souls, the distant Vessel by Doubling a Cape loft to the sharpest Ey, For hateful treason, taxing their mistake, With Anchors cut, and Sails spread wide they make The lasht Waves roar, whilst those inclos'd within The Gally, by her unkown speed had bin Far more deceived, being so far conveyed, Ere care arrives to tel them they'r betrayed Through Mirths neglective Guards, who now in hast With anger rais'd, in vain those flames did wast In wild Attempts, to force a passage to The open Decks, whither, before withdrew
Molarchus was, who now prepar'd to give That treason birth, whose hated Name must live In bloody Lines of Infamy, before They could expect it, opening wide the door That led them forth, the noble Captives fly To seek revenge, but being encounterd by An Armed Crew, so fierce a fight begin, That Nights black Mantle nere vvas lin'd vvithin, With ought more horrid; in which bloody Fray, The subtle Traytor valiant to betray, Though Abject else unnoted, seising on Th' unguarded Princess from their rage is gone, Through Nights black Mask, with that rich Prize into A Boat that plac'd, for that design was drew Near to the Gally, whose best Wealth being now Thus made their own, no more they study how To save the rest, all which for death design'd, The conquer'd Rebels soon their safety find, From other Boats, but first, that all but she, Oth' royal train secur'd by death might be, So large a Leak in the brave Vessel make, That thence her Womb soon too much waight did take For her vast bulk to weild, which sinking now, No safety to her royal Guests allow. The Ship thus lost, and now no Throne but Waves, Left the Sicilian Prince, just Heaven thus saves His sacred Person, amongst those that sought For timely safety, nimble strength had brought Argalia, and his following Friend so near, One of the Boats, in which (secur'd from fear) The Rebels saild, that now they both had took A Hold so sure, that though their Foes forsook
Their Oars to hinder't, spite of all their force, Argalia enters, which a sad divorce From Life, as he by strength attempts to rise, From falling wounds, unhappily denies The valiant Aphron, who by death betrayd From time, and strength, had now left none to ayd His Friend, but those attending Vertues, that Ne're more then now, for th' world to wonder at, Brave Trophies built; with such a suddain rage, As all his Foes did to defence engage, Those bolder Souls that durst resist, he had From their disorderd Robes of flesh unclad, VVhich horrid sight froc'd the more feareful to Such swift submission, that ere fear out-grew His hope, assisted by that strength which bought Their Lives reprieve, their Oars reverst had brought Him back to th' place, in which the guilty flood, VVas staind with fair Sicillias noblest blood. Assisted by those silver streams of Light, The ful fac'd Moon shot through the swarthy Night, On the smooth Sea, he first his course directs, Toward one, whose Robes studded with Jems, reflects Those feeble Rays, like new faln Stars, he there Finds Sparta's Prince, then sinking from the sphear Of mortall greatness in the boundless deep, To calm Lifes cares in an eternall sleep, From unexpected death, the Graves most grim And ghastly Tyrant, having rescued him With as much sped, as griefs distractions joynd To Nights confusion, could give leave to find More Friends before that all were swallowd by The Sea he hasts, when being by chance brought nigh
Dead Aphrons Father, to be Partner in Their carer, who as they only sav'd had bin To mourn the rest, he from the rude Sea saves Him, to be drownd in sorrows sable Waves. Now in the Quest of that deserving Lord, Whose goodness did to's Infancy afford, Lifes best of Comforts, Education, he To bawk that needless diligence might see, At one large draught the wide Waves swallow all, Who vainly did till that sad minute call To Heaven for help, which dismal sight beheld By those that sav'd by accident, expeld Their own just fears, for them to entertain, As just a grief, their needful time in vain They spend, no longer in their search, but though Unweildy grief, yet made their motion slow, Hast from that horrid place, where eache must leave Such valued friends; numbers that did receive Their blood descended to Nobility, From th' royal Spring, here the griev'd Prince might se Interd ith' Ocean the Epirote Lord, His late found Son, whom Love could scarce afford A minutes absence; nor's Argalia less Ingag'd to grief to leave, whom the distress Of's Youth reliev'd, but what from each of these Borrowed some streams of sorrow to apease, A grief which since so many Floods hath cost, The noble Aminander here was lost. Rowed with such speed, as their desire joynd to That fear which from the conquerd Rebels drew A swift obedience, being conducted by A friendly Light, their Boat is now drawn nigh
A rocky Island, in whose Harbour they Found where the Boat that had out-sayld them lay, Drawn neer the shoar, but all the Passengers Being gone, the sight of that alone confers No other comfort, then t' inform them that The ravisht Princess had been landed at That Port, which by their Saylers they are told Belongs unto a Castle, kept to hold That Island, though but one unnoted Town, To th' scarce known Laws of the Sicillian Crown. This heard by th' Prince, who formerly had known That Castles strength being vext (although his own) That now 'twas such, leaving the Vessel they Protected by Nights heaviest shades, convey Themselves into a neighbouring Cottage, where The Prince, who now externally did bear No forms of greatness, lest to his repose, Argalia whilst Nights shadows yet did close Discovering Eyes, hast back to th' Harbour, whence To give the royal Fleet Intelligence, Oth' Kings distress, he sends forth all but One, Whose stoutness had best made his Valour known, Of those which conquerd by his Sword, are now By bounty made too much his own, t' allow Even flight suspition room; This being done, That Valour though with Love 'twere wingd, might run On no rash Precipice, assisted by That skilful Sea-man, from some Ships that ly Neglected, 'cause by time decayed, he takes So much oth' Tackling, as of that he makes Ladders of length, sufficient to ascend The Castle Wals, which having to defend
Them nought but slave security, is done With so much ease, that what's so wel begun, They boldly second, and first entering in A Tower, which had by th' prudent Founder bin Built to command the Havens Mouth, which lay Too low for th' Castle, where when come, all they Found to resist, is one poor Centry bound, In sleep, which soon by death is made more sound. To lodge the Prince in that safe place, before His active valour yet attempted more: The Gates secur'd that led to th' Castle, he Protected by that Nights obscuritie, By a conceald smal Salliport is to Its strength soon brought; when now prepard to view More dreadful dangers, in such habit clad, As by the out-Guards easie Error had Soon as a Soldier gave him entrance, come To th' Hall he is, there being informd by some, Oth' drousie Guards, where his pretended speed Might find Molarchus, to perform a deed, That future Ages, if that Honours fire Lose not its light, shal worthily admire His Valours hast; within a room whose pride, Of Art (though great) was far more glorifi'd, By that bright Luster, the Spectators saw Through Sorrows Clouds in fair Pharonnida, He finds the impious Villain heightend in His late success, to such rude acts of sin, That servile baseness, the low distance whence He us'd to look, grew sawcy Impudence. Inflam'd Argalia, who at once beholds Objects to which the Sould inlarg'd, unfolds
Its passions in the various Characters Of Love and Anger, now no more defers The excution of his rage, but in So swift a death, as if his hand had been Guided by Lightning, to Molarchus sent His Lifes discharge, which with astonishment, Great, as if by their evil Angels, all Their sins had been displayed, did wildly fall Upon his Followers, whom ere hast could save, Or strength resist, Argalia's Sword had gave Such sudden deaths, that whilst Amazements reignd, Ere all he from the heedless tumult gaind, That glorious Prize, the royal Lady, who In all assaults of fears, not lost unto Her own clear Judgment, as a blessing sent From Heaven, whilst her base Foes Confusion lent That Action safety, follows that brave Friend, Whose Sword redeemd her, till her Journeys end Through threatning dangers, brought her to that place. Where with such passion, as kind Wives embrace Husbands returnd from bondage, she is by Her Father welcom'd into liberty. Thus rescu'd, whilst exalted tumours sweld To such Confusion, as from sense expeld Reasons safe Conduct, whilst each Soldier leaves His former Charge, fears pale disease receives This Paroxisme; the Fleet, which yet had in A doubtful Quest of their surpriz'd Prince bin Directed hither with the new-born day, Their streamers round the Cittadel display, Which seen by them, that being deluded by The dead Molarchus, to his treachery,
Had joynd their strength, guilt, the Original Of shame, did to defend the plat-form Call Their bold endeavour, but, when fidning it Too strongly man'd for undermineing wit, Or open strength to force, dispairing to Be long secure, prompted by fear they threw Themselves on Mercy, which calm Grace among Heavens other blessings, whilst it leads along, The Prince toward Victory made his Conquest seen, Such as came not to punish, but redeem. The end of the fourth Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The first Book. CANTO THE FIFTH. The ARGUMENT. IX. The gratefull Prince, to shew how much he lov'd This noble Youth, whoes Merits just reward, Too great for less Abilities had prov'd, Makes him Commander of his Daughters Guard. X. Where seated in the most benign Aspect, Kind Love could grant to fair Pharonnida, A sacred Vision doth her hopes detect, Whose waking joyes his absence doth withdraw. FReed from those dangers, which this bold attempt Made justly feard, whilst joy did yet exempt Those cares, which when by time concocted shall, His Kingdome to a general Mourning call,
Sparta's pleas'd Prince, with all the Attributes Ere Gratitude learnd from Desert, salutes That noble Youth, which even when hope was spent, Kind Heaven had made his safeties Instrument, By acts of such heroick Vertue, that Whilst all the less concernd are wondring at The grateful Prince, in all the noble waies Of honour lasting, as his life repaies, By whose example the fair Princess taught To shadow Love (her Souls most perfect draught) In friendships Vail, so free a welcome gave The worthy stranger, that al, prayer durst crave, Though sacrific'd in Zeals most perfect fire, Seemd now from Heaven dropt on his pleas'd desire. Some daies spent here, whilst Justice vainly sought, That Treasons root, whose base production brought, Unto an unexpected Period in Molarchus death with him had buried bin, To future knowledge, all confessions, though In torments they extracted were, bestow Upon their knowledge, being th' imperfect shade Of supposition, which too weak t' invade Even those, whose doubtful Loyalty lookt dim, The prudent Prince, burying mistrust with him, Leaving the Island, with's triumphant Fleet, On the Sicillian shoar, prepars to meet That Joy in triumph which a blessing brought, His loyal Subjects with their prayers had sought, To cure those hot distemperatures, which in His absence had the Courts Quotidian bin, The Princess guard (as being an honour due, To noble Valour) having left unto
That worthy stranger, whose victorious hand Declar'd a Soul created for command, The Prince departs from his loud Daughters Court, To joyful Corinth, where, though the resort Of such as by their service strove t' express, An uncorrupted Loyalty, made less, That Mourning, which the Kingdomes general Loss, Claim'd from all hearts, yet like a sable Cross, Which amongst Trophy's noble Conquerors bear, All did some signs oth' publick sorrrow wear. But leaving these to rectifie that State, This Feaver shook, return, to whom we late Left gently calm'd, that happy pair, which in Desire (the shady Porch of Love) begin That lasting progress, which ere ended shall, So oft their Fate to strong assistance call. Some Months in happy free delights, before Passion got strength enough to dictate more, Then Reason could, right fair they'd spent, in which Slumber of Fancy, popular Love grown rich, Soon becomes factious, and engages all The powers of Nature to procure the fall, Of the Souls lawful Soveraign; either in Each Action of the others did begin To place an Adoration, she doth see What ere he doth, as shining Majesty Beneath a Cloud, or Books, where Heaven transfers Their Oracles in unknown Characters. Like Gold yet unrefin'd, or th' Adamant, Wrapt up in earth, he only seemd to want Knowledge of Worth. Her Actions in his fight Appear like fires feign'd Element, with light,
But not destruction arm'd; like the fair Sun, When through a chrystal Aqueduct he'th run, His piercing Beams, until grown temperate by That cooling Medium, through humility, Shun her Majestick worth; in eithers Eyes, The other seemd to wear such a disguise As Poets cloathd their wandring Gods in, when In forms disguiz'd they here converst with men. But long this conflict of their Passions ere Resisted lasts not, when disdaind to bear Those leaden Fetters, the great Princess tries To quench that fire ith' Embrio, ere it rise To unresisted blazes, but in vain, What her tears smoother are by sighs again, Blown into flames, such as, since not to be By ought extinguisht, her sweet modesty Strives to conceal, nor did them more betray, Then by such Fugitives as stole away, Through her fair Eyes, those Salliports of Love From her besieged heart, now like to prove, Had not her Honour cal'd the Act unjust, So feeble to betray her Souls best trust, Her flames being not such, as each vulgar breast, Feels in the fires of Fancy, when opprest, With gloomy discontents, her bright stars sate Inthron'd so high, that like the Bays of Fate, It stopt the Current of the stream, and to The Sea of Honour, Loves fresh Rivers drew. Thus whilst the royal Eaglet doth ith' high Sublimer Region of bright Majesty, Upon Affections Wings, still hover, yet, Loath to descend, on th' humble earth doth sit,
Her worthy Lover, like that amorous Vine, When crawling o're the Weeds, it strives to twine Embraces with the Elm, he stands, whilst she Desires to bend, but like that love-sick Tree, By greatness is deni'd; he that nere knew, A swelling tumour of conceit, nor flew Upon the waxen Wings of vain Ambition, A thought above his own obscure Condition, Thinks that the Princess by her large respect, Conferd on him, but kindly doth reflect Her Fathers beams, and with a reverend zeal, Sees those descending Rays that did reveal Loves Embassies transported on the quick Wings of that heart-o're-coming Rhetorick, Instructing that the weakness of his Eye, Dazl'd with beams of shining Majesty, Might for too boldly gazing on a sight, So full of glory, be depriv'd of light, Stifling his Fancy, till it turnd the Aire, That fand his heart to flames, which pale dispaire, Chil'd into Ie soon; as he went about With them to breath a storm of passions out. But vain are all these fears, his Eagle sight, Is born to gaze upon no lesser Light, Then that from whence, all other beauties in The same sphear borrow theirs, he else had bin, Degenerate from that royal Airce, whence He first did spring, although he fell from thence Unfledg'd, the growing Pinnions of his Fame, Wanting the purple tincture of his Name, And Titles (both unknown) yet shall be fly, On his own Merits strength, a pitch as high
Though not so boldly claimd, and such as shall Inhance the blessing, when the dull mists fall From truths benighted Eyes, whispering in His Souls pleas'd Ear, her passion did begin, Whilst all the Constellations of her Fate, Fixt in the Zenith of bright honour sate, Whilst his (deprest by adverse Fortune) in Their Nader lay (even to his hopes) unseen. Whilst thus Enthean fire did lye conceald, With different Curtains, least by being reveald, Cross Fate, which could not quench it, should to death Scorch all their hopes, burnd in the angry breath Of her incensed Father, whilst the fair Pharonnida was striving to repair The wakeful ruines of the day, within Her Bed, whose Down of late by Love had been Converted into Thorns, she having payed The restless tribute of her sorrow, stayed To breath a while in broken slumbers, such As with short blasts cool feverish brains, but much More was in hers, a strong Prophetick dream, Divering by Enigmaes Natures stream, Long hovering through the Portals of her mind, On vain phantastick Wings, at length did find The glimerings of obstructed reason, by A brighter beam of pure divinity, Led into supernatural light, whose Rayes, As much transcended reasons, as the dayes Dull mortal fires, faith apprehends to be Beneath the glimerings of divinity. Her unimprisond Soul disrob'd of all Terrestial thoughts, like its Original,
In Heaven pure, and Immaculate, a fit Companion did for those bright Angels sit, Which the Gods made their Messengers to bear This sacred truth: seeming transported where, Fixt in the flaming Center of the world, The heart oth' Mycrocosme, 'bout which is hurld The spangl'd Curtains of the Sky, within Whose boundless Orbs, the circling Planets spin Those threads of time, upon whose strength rely The pondrous Burthens of mortality; An Adamantine World she sees, more pure, More glorious far then this, fram'd to endure The shock of Dooms-daies Darts, in which remains The better Angels of what earth contains, Plac'd there to govern all our Acts, and be A Medium 'twixt us and Eternity. Hence Nature from a Laberinth, half above, Half underneath, that sympathetick Love Which warms the World, to Generation sends, On unseen Atomes, each small star attends Here for his Message, which receiv'd is by Their influence to the Astral Faculty, That lurks on earth communicated; hence Informing Forma sends Intelligence, To the material principles of earth, Her upper Garments, Natures second birth. Upon each side of this large Frame, a Gate Of different use was plac'd, at one there sate A sprightly youth, whose Angels form delights, Eyes dim'd with age, whose blandishments invights Infants ith' Womb to court their wo, and be By his false shape tempted to misery.
Millions of thousands swarm about him, though Diseases do each minute strive to throw Them from his presence, since being tempted by His flattering form, all court it, though they ly On beds of thorns to look on't, saving some More wretched Male-contents, that hither come, With Souls so sullen, that whilst time invights Them to his Joys, they shun those smooth delights. This, the Worlds Favourite, had a younger Brother. Of different hue, each more unlike the other, Then opposite Aspects Antipathy Within their breasts, though they were forc'd to be Almost inseparable dwelt: this Fiend A passage guarded, which at th' other end Oth' spatious Structure stood, betwixt each Gate Was plac'd a Laberinth, in whose Angles sate The vanities of Life, attempting to Stay deaths pale Harbengers, but that black Cle, Times dusty Girdle, Fates Arithmetick, Griefs slow pac'd Snail, Joyes more then Eagle quick, That Chain whose Links compos'd of hours and daies, Thither at length spight of delay conveys The slow pac'd steps of time; there alwaies stood Near him one of the triple Sisterhood, Who with deformity in love, did send Him troops of Servants, hourly to attend Upon his harsh Commands, which he from all Society of flesh, without the Wall, Down a dark Hill conveyd, at whose foot stood An ugly Lke, black as that horrid flood, Gods made by men did feare, Myriads of Boats, On the dark surface of the water floats,
Containing Passengers, whose different hue, Tell them that from the Wals do trembling view Their course, that there's no age of man to be Exempted from that powerful tyrany. A Tyde which nere shall know reflux, beyond The baleful stream, unto a gloomy strond, Circl'd with black obscurity, conveys Each passenger, where their torn Chain of daies, Is in Eternity peckt up: between These different Gates, the Princess having seen Lifes various Sceans wrought to a method by Disposing Angels, on a Rock more high Then Natures common surface, she beholds The Mansion house of Fate, which thus unfolds Its sacred Mysteries, A trine within A quadrate plac'd, both those incompast in A perfect Circle was its form, but what Its matter was, for us to wonder at, Is undiscoverd left; a Tower there stands At every Angle, where times fatal hands Th' impartial Parae dwel, ith' first she sees Clothe, the kindest of the Destinies, From immaterial Essences to cull The seeds of life, and of them frame the Wooll, For Lachesi to spin, about her flie Myriades of Souls, that yet want flesh to lie Warmd with their Functions in, whose strength bestows That power by which man ripe for misery grows. Her next of Objects was that glorious Tower, Where that swift fingerd Nymph that spares no houre From mortals service, draws the various threds Of life in several lengths; to weary beds
Of age, extending some, whilst others in Their Infancy are broke, some blackt in sin, Others (the Favourites of Heaven) from whence Their Origen, candid with Innocence: Some purpl'd in afflictions, others dy'd In sanguine pleasures; some in glittering pride, Spun to adorn the Earth, whilst others wear Rags of Deformity; but knots of care No thread was wholly freed from. Next to this Fair glorious Tower was plac'd that black Abbyss Of dreadful Atropos, the bale ful seat Of death and horrour, in each room replear, With lazy damps, loud groans, and the sad sight Of pale, grim Ghosts, those Terrours of the Night: To this (the last stage) that the winding Clew Of life can lead mortality unto; Fear was the dreadful Porter, which let in All Guests sent thither by destructive sin. As its firm Basis, on all these depends A lofty Piramid, to which each sends Some Gift from Natures treasury to Fames Uncertain hand, the hollow room with Names, And empty sounds was only fil'd, of those, For whom the Destinies daind to compose Their fairest threads; as if but born to die, Here all Ephem'raes of report did flie, On feeble Wings, till being like to fall Some faintly stick upon the slimy Wall, Till the observant Antiquary rents, Them thence to live in paper Monuments, In whose Records they are preserv'd to be, The various censures of posterity.
Ith' upper Room, as Favourites to Fate, There only Poets (rich in Fancy) sate, In that beneath, Historians, whose Records, Do Theams unto those pregnant Wits afford; Yet both preparing everlasting Bayes, To crown their glorious dust, whose happy dayes Were here spent well; beneath these cover'd o're With dim oblivions shadows, Myriads more, Till Dooms-day shall the gaudy World undress, Lay huddl'd up in dark forgetfulness: All which (as Objects not of worth to cast A fixt Eye on) the Princess Genius past, In heedless hast, untill obstructed by Visions, that thus fixt her Souls wandring Ey. A Light as great, as if that Dooms-daies flame Were for a Lamp hung in the Court of Fame: Directs her, where on a bright Throne there sate Sicillia's better Genius: her proud state, (Courted by all Earths greatest Monarchs) by Three valiant Knights supported was, whose high Merits disdaining a Reward, less great, With equal hopes aim'd at the royal Seat, Which since all could not gain, betwixt her three Fair Daughters both her Crown and Dignity Is equally bestow'd, by giving one To each of them; when the divided Throne, Had on each Angle fixt a Diadem, Her Vision thus proceeds; the royal Stem, That bore her Fathers Crown, to view first brings Its golden Fruit, a glorious Race of Kings, Led by the Founder of their Fame, their Rear Brought by her Father up: next those that bear,
Epirus honourd Armes, the royal train Concluding in Zoranza: this linkt Chain Drawn to an end, the Princes that had swayed Argalia's Scepter, fill the Scean till stayed By the Epirots Sword, their conquerd Crown, From aged Gelons hoaty head dropt down, At fierce Zoranza's feet; this she beholds With admiration, whilst hid truth unfolds It self in plainer objects, the distrest Actolian Prince again appears, but drest In a poor Pilgrims Weed, in's hand he leads A lovely Boy, in whose sweet look she reads Soft pitties Lectures, but whilst gazing on This Act till lost in admiration, By sudden Fate he seemd transformd, to what She last beheld him, only offering at Loves Shrine his heart to her Idea; there Joy had bereav'd her slumbers, had not fear Clouded the glorious Dream, a dreadful mist, Black as the steams of Hell, seeming to twist Its ugly vapours, into shades more thick Then Night ingendring Damps, had with a quick But horrid darkness vail'd the Room, t' augment Whose terrour a Clouds sulphry bosome rent, With dreadful thunder-claps, darting a bright But fearful blaze through th' artificial Night, Lent her so much use of her Eyes to see Argalia groveling in his blood, which she Had scarce beheld, ere the malignant flame Vanisht again she shrieks, and on his Name Doth passionatly call, but here's no sound Startles her Ear, but hollow groans, which drownd
Her Soul in a cold sweat of fears, which ended, A second blaze lends her its light, attended With Objects, whose wild horrour did present Her Fathers Ghost then seeming to lament, Her injur'd Honour, in his Company, Thd slain Laconians Spirit, which let free From the dark Prison of the cold Grave, where In rusty Chains he lay, was come to bear Her to that sad Abode, but as she now Appeard to sink, a golden Cloud did bow From Heavens fair Arch, in which Argalia seemd, Clad in bright Armour fitting, who redeemd Her from approaching danger, which being done, The darkness vanisht, and a glorious Sun Of welcome Light displayd its beams, by which A Throne the first resembling, but more rich In its united Glory to the eye, Presents its luster, where in Majesty The Angels that attend their better Fate, Pac'd her, and brave Argalia, in which state The un-bard portals of her Soul, let fly The golden slumber, whose dear memory, Shall live within her noble thoughts, until Treading o're all obstructions, Fate fulfil These dark predictions, whose obscurity, Must often first her Souls afflictions be. When now the Mornings dews, that cool allay, Which cures the Feavers of th' intemperate day, Were rarifi'd to Aire, the Princess to Improve her joy in private thoughts, withdrew From burthensome society within A silent Groves cool shadows, what had been
Her Midnights joy to recollect, in which Delightful task, whilst Memory did enrich The robes of Fancy, to divert the stream Of thoughts, intentive only on her Dream. Argalia enters with a speed, that shewed He unto some supream Commander owed That diligence, but when arriv'd so near As to behold, stopt with a reverend fear, Least this intrusion on her Privacies, Might ruffle Passion, which now floating lies In a calm stream of thoughts, he staies, till she By her Commnds gave fresh activity To his desires, then with a lowly grace, Yet such, to which Prides haughty Sons gave place, For Native sweetness, he on's knee presents A Packet from her Father, whose Contents, If Love can groan beneath a greater Curse, Then Desperation, made her sufferings worse Then fear could represent them, 'twas exprest In Language that not wholly did request, Nor yet command consent; only declare, His royal Will, and the paternal Care He bore his Kingdomes safety, which could be By nought confirm'd, more then Afinity, With the Laconian Prince, whose big fame stood Exalted in a spatious Sea of blood, On Honours highest Pyramid; his hand Had made the triple headed spot of Land, One of her stately Promontories bow, Beneath his Sword, and with his Scepter now, He at the other reaches, which, if Love But gently smile on's new-born hopes, and prove
Propitious as the God of War, his Fate Cimbs equal with his wishes, but too late, That slow-pac'd Soldier bent his Forces to Storm that fair Virgin Cittadell, which knew Ere his pretences could a Parlee call, Beneath what force that royal Fort must fall. Inclos'd within this rough Lords Leters he Receiv'd his Picture, which inform'd her be Wanted dissimulation (that worst part O Courtship (o put Complements of Art On his Effigies; his stern Brow far more Glorying ith' Scars, then in the Crown he wore: His active Youth made him Retainer to The Court of Mars, something too long to sue For entrance into Love's, like Mornings clad In griesl'd Frosts, ere plump-cheek'd Autume had Shrn the Glebs golden Locks, some silver hairs Mixt with his black appeard; his Age dispairs Not of a hopeful Heir, nor could his Youth Promise much more, the venerable truth Of glorious Victories, that stuck his Name For Ornament ith' Frontispiece of Fame, Together with his Native greatness were, His Orators to plead for Love, but where Youth, Beauty, Valor, and a Soul as brave, Though not known great as his, before had gave Loves pleasing wounds; Fortunes neglected gain, In fresh assaults, but spends her strength in vain. With as much ease as Souls, when ripen'd by A wel-spent life, hast to eternity. She had sustaind this harsh encounter, though Backt with her Fathers threats, did it not shew
More dreadful yet, in a command which must Call her Argalia, from his glorious trust, Her Guardian to a separation in An Embassie to him, whose hopes had been Her new created fears, which sentence read By the wise Lady, though her passions bred A sudden tumult, yet her reason staies The Torrent, till Argalia who obaies The strictest limits of observance to Her he adornd, being reverently withdrew, Inlarg'd her sorrow in so loud a tone, That ere he's through the winding Laberynth gone, So far, but that he could distinctly hear Her sad Complaints, they thus assault his Ear: Unhappy Soul, born only to infuse Pearls of delight with Vinegar, and lose Content for Honour; it's a sin to be Born high, that robs me of my liberty: Or is't the curse of greatness to behold Vertue through such false Opticks as unfold No splendor less, from equal Orbs they shine? What Heaven made free, ambitious men confine, In regular degrees: poor Love must dwel Within no Climate, but what's parallel, Unto our honourd births; the envied Fare Of Princes oft these burthens find from state; When lowly Swains knowing no Parents voice, A Negative, make a free happy choice. And here she sigh'd, then with some drops ditild, From Loves most soveraign Elixar fil'd The chrystal Fountains of her eyes, which ere Dropt down, she thus recals again; but nere,
(Ne're my Argalia) shall these fears destroy My hopes of thee, Heaven let me but enjoy So much of all those blessings, which their Birth Can take from frail Mortality, and Earth, Contracting all her Curses cannot make A storm of danger loud enough to shake Me to a trembling Penitence, a Curse, To make the horrour of my sufferings worse, Sent in a Fathers Name, like Vangeance fell From angry Heaven, upon my head may dwell, In an eternal stain; my honourd Name With pale disgrace may languish, busie Fame My Reputation spot, Affection be Term'd uncommanded Lust, sharp poverty, That Weed which kils the gentle Flower of Love, As the result of all these Ills may prove My greatest misery, unless to find My self unpitied, yet not so unkind, Would I esteem this mercenary Band, As those far more malignant powers that stand Arm'd with diswasions to obstruct the way, Fancy directs, but let those Souls obay Their harsh Commands, that stand in fear to shead Repentant tears: I am resolv'd to tread These doubtful pathes, through all the shades of fear, That now benights them. Love, with pity hear Thy Suppliants Prayers, and when my clouded Eyes Shall cease to weep, in Smiles I'le sacrifice To thee such Offerings, that the utmost date Of deaths rough hands shall never violate. Whilst our fair Virgin-sufferer was in This Agony, Argalia that had been
Attentive, as an envied Tyrant to Suspected Counsels: from her Language drew So much, that that pure essence which informs His knowledge, shall in all the future storms Of Fate protect him, from a fear that did Far more then death afflict, whilst Love lay hid In Honours upper Region, now whilst she Calmly withdraws, to let her Comforts be Hopes of's return, his latest view forsook His Souls best comfort, who hath now betook Her self to private thoughts, where with what rest, Love can admit, I leave her, and him blest In a most prosperous Voyage, but happier far In being directed by so bright a Star. The end of the first Book.
PHARONNIDA. The second Book. CANTO THE FIRST. The ARGUMENT. I. Still wakefull guilt, Almanzors Rebel sin, Taking advantage of unguarded mirth, Which now without mistrust did revell in, The Princess Court gives thence new Treason birth. II. By treachery seiz'd, and through Nights shades conveyed She had for ever in this storm been lost, Had not its rage by such rude hands been stayed, That safety neer as much as danger cost. THese Hell-ingendred Embrioes, which had long Lay hid within Almanzors breast, grown strong; Now for delivery strives; Clandestine plots, Ripen'd with Age and Lust, dissolve the knots,
Wherein his fear had fetterd them, and fly Beyond the Circle of his Loyalty. Since his deserts made him a stranger to His Princess Court, he'd liv'd like those that do Fly that pursuing Vengeance, which attends A Rebels Acts, seen only to such Friends, Whose blemmisht Honour, suffering in his fall, Assist his rising, though they venter all By that unlawful Act, on pathes that may Precipitate to ruine; the dark way Had long been sought for, Consultations did Whisper Rebellion in soft Aires, forbid To live in louder Language, until like Inevitable thunder it could strike, As swift, as secret, and as sure as those, Heavens anger huls through all that durst oppose. In all the progress of that dark design, Whose unseen Engines strove to undermine That power (which since Heaven doth in Kings infuse) None but unhallowed Rebels durst abuse Time (Treasons secret Midwife) did produce No birth like this; such Friends as often use Had taught him their Souls Characters he makes Sharers of's guilt; but whilst he (troubl'd) takes A care to fit each smaller Wheel unto This fatal Engine, those black powers that do Assist such dark designs, a moving spirit, Supplies it with, although Almanzors merit Purchast few friends, yet had his tempting Gold Corrupted some, 'mongst which it surest hold Upon Amphibia took, a Lady who Before Florenza's sweeter vertues drew
Her Favour to a better Object, swayed, The Princess choice Affections she betrayed By glittering Charms, perswades her thoughts no deed For guilt is branded, whose attempts may feed Ambitions malice, and at one blow give Envie and Avarice a hope to live Pleas'd with their ruine, whose fair merits dwell High in those thoughts, from whence she justly fell. To rack revenge unto as large extent, As hate could wish, what Hell could nere invent, Without assistance of a female Wit, Mans first Betrayer, all that seemd but fit From Treasons close embrace to propagate Revenge she lights him, what (though close as Fate, When parling with the Destinies) is by Her Counsel acted, swift as stories fly From vulgar Tongues, her treachery makes known To the bold Rebbel, whose intentions grown Hence ripe for Action, when his secret guilt A strong retreat had for rebellion built, By laying the foundation on't, in those Whom since by want, or envy made the Foes To th' publick peace, are soon perswaded by Their Princess fall, to cure that malady. This plat-form layd, some whose wise valour he By practice knew, adornd with secresie, Amongst the number of his guilty friends, Selected in its first attempt, attends Treasons dark walks, which now more secret by Nights dismal shadows made, had brought them nigh The Princess Palace, through the Hemisphears Dark Curtain, now the big bulkt roof appears,
And dapl'd Windows shewd their severall light, Like rich Enamel in the Jet of Night; All rockt in sweet security they found, By Fate false smiles, triumphant mirth had crownd The glorious Train, whose height of joy could tast, No poyson of suspition, each embrac'd His free delights, yet feard, no Snake should lye Lurking within those Flowers: amidst which high Divine flames of enthean joy, to her That level'd had their way, a Messenger Makes known their neer approach, for which before She had prepar'd, and vaild the Pavement o're In thin, but candid Innocence; accurst By all that ere knew Vertue: oh, how durst Thy Envie turn these commick Sceans into So red a Tragedy as must ensue, Thy guilts Stenography, which thus writes Fate In Characters of blood: but now too late 'Tis to repent, when punishment wrought fair, Shews thy foul Crimes, thou only mayst despair. Leaving this Fiend to hatch her Vipers here, Lets breath awhile, although in full carier, Stay on the brow oth' precipice to view The Couts full joyes, which being arriv'd unto Their Zenith seemd to Fate-discerning Eyes, Like Garlands were before a Sacrifice, The Cornu Copiae from the Tables now, Remov'd by full fed Rurals, did allow Time for discourse, as much as modest mirth Durst stretch her wings; crownd Cups gave lusty birth To active sports. The hearts warm bounties flame From lofty Piles, and in their pride became
The luster of the Roof; to glorifie Which yet imperfect Festival, the eye That lent to this large body light divine, Pharonnida, at whose adored Shrine, These Sacrifices offerd were, appears Within the Hall, and with her presence clears Each supercillious brow, if hopes to see What's now enjoy'd, suffer'd such there to be. The Princess on her honourd Throne repos'd, A Fancy tempting, Musick first unclos'd The winding Portals of the Soul, which done, Four Swains, whose time directed knowledge won Attention with Credulity, by turn Sicillia's Annals sung, and from the Urn Of now almost forgotten truth did raise Their Fame (those branches of eternal Baies.) Which sober mirth, Preparatives unto More active sports continuing, whilst the new Modell of Treason was disguizing in A Mask ordaind to candie o're their sin, To gild those Pills of poyson with delight, And strew with Roses, deadly Aconite, Was now drawn neer an end, when from without A murmuring noise of several sounds about The Palace Gates was heard, which suddenly, Dissolving to an antick harmony, Proclaims their entrance, whose first solemn sight, In dreadful shapes mixt terrour with delight. In the black front of that slow March appears, A Train, whose difference both in Sex and years, Had spoke confusion, if agreement in Their Acclamation had no Prologue been.
A Dance where method in disorder lay, Where each seemd out, though all their rules obay, Was first in different measures trod, which done Twelve arm'd Viragoes, whose strange habit won More admiration then their beauty led, As many captive Satyrs, in the head Oth' Amazonian troop, a Matron by, To younger Nymphs supported, till come nigh Pharonnida's bright Throne, presents the rest Her Issue, who externally exprest, So many fair soul'd Vertues, born to be Protectors of their Mother Chastity, Who wants their help, although supported by Her weaker daughters Fear, and Modesty. Those obscean vices, whose rude hands betray Natures deformities forc'd to obay, Their brave opposing Vertues did appear Ith' captive Satyrs, who, being now brought near A dreadful Musick's heard without, whose sound Did gentler Aires in their first births confound; VVhich being a signall to that act of blood, That soon ensues, whilst all expecting stood, Some happier change, the false viragoes drew Their Swords, and with a speedy fury slew The struggling Knights, who thus disguiz'd had bin, VVith the more horrour to be murtherd in Their royal Mistress sight, whose shrieks did tell, VVhat trembling Guests within her breast did dwell. Sudden and cruel was the Act, yet stands Not Treason here, but whilst their purpl'd hands Yet wreakt in blood, their guilty Souls to stain, VVith blacket sins (her weak Defenders slain)
Rush toward the trembling Princess, who now lies Betrayed by the Souls Janitors, her Eyes To Passions insupportable, which grown A burthen to her Spirits, all were flown To th' Porch of death for rest: if Souls new fled From tainted bodies that have surfeited, On studied sins, could be discernd when they Unarmd with penitence, are hurld away, By long armd Fiends, less pale, less horrid would Their guilty looks appear, confusion could Not live in livelier emblem, each appears To flie the danger, but about him bears Its pale effects: so passengers forsake A sinking Ship, such strong Convulsions shake Surprized Forts, so Doomsdays Trumpet shall Startle the unprepared world, when all Her Attomes in their then worn Robes shall be Ravisht in flames to meet eternity. Th' unguarded Princess being by all forsook, But poor Florenza, both from thence are took, VVhilst neither in that horrid Agony, Beheld their danger, and transported by Almanzor to his Coach, which near attended, On his assur'd success, who now befriended VVith the protecting darkness hasts away, Swift as desire with the fair trembling prey. Those few opposing friends, whose will was more, Then power to relieve her, over bore By the victorious Rebbels, did in vain Attempt her rescue, which since fruitless, slain, Her Martyrs fall, leaving their lives to be, An evidence of dying Loyalty.
Success attends thus far, but Fortune now Left off to smile on Villany, her brow Contracted into frowns, she swiftly sent This Countermand, her Followers having spent Their own endeavours to no purpose raise, In hast the neighbourig Villages, nor staies The swift Alarm, till it had out-fled The speed Almanzor made; rouz'd from his Bed, And warm Embraces of his Wife, by those Which had out-run the danger of their Foes: The drousie Villager in trembling hast, Snatches such Armes as former fear had plac'd, Fit to defend, with which whilst Horpies call In tones more frantick then a bacchinal. They stumble to their Rendesvouz, which none But only by the louder cries had knowne. This giddy multitude, which no command Knew, but what rage did dictate, hovering stand, Like big swoln Clouds drove by a doubtful wind, Uncertain where to fall: one cries behind The greatest danger lies; some like his choice, And speedily retreat, untill a voice More powerful though from the like judgment sprung, Perswades them on again; some madly rung The jarring Bels, as far from harmony, As their Opinions: all which disagree About the place, whence the Alarum's come, One cries the Princess Court, untill struck dumb, By a more terrifying Fool that swears The next Port is surpriz'd, tow'rd which he stares, To see the Beacons blaze, but is from far, Deceiv'd by th' light of an scending star.
So many shapes bear their weak Fancies, that, All would do something, but there's none knows what. In this strange Medly of Confusion, they That could command, want such as would obey, To exercise their power; each thinks his own Opinion best, so must perform't alone: Or else remain, as hitherto they had, Busie in doing nothing: in which mad Fit of distracted fury, like to fight, For want of Foes amongst themselves, the Night (Grown grey with age) fore-shewd her death, when each Thinking that now he'd done enough to teach, An active Soldier vigilance in spending A Night abroad, which they will call defending Their Prince and Country from a danger, but What twas they know not, swearing't shall be put In the next Chronicle, they disunite, Their nere wel-joynted Forces, and a flight Rather then march, to th' several Hamlets take, From whence at first, being scarce half awake, Not so much cloathd, their heedless hast had sent Them, only noise and number to augment. One troop of this disbanded Company, Which, though but few, more then could wel agree To march together, by mistake being cast Into a narrow straight, met as they past The Coach that bore the Princess, being by those That stole her guarded, the mad Rowt t' oppose Their farther passage, not because they thought Them to be those their Ignorance had sought, In their late meeting, the Antipathy Twixt them and th' Gentry, is enough to be
That quarrels Parent, whose event shall make Their Prince and Country blest in their mistake. Startl'd from all his temperate joyes with this Unlookt for Remora ith' Road of bliss, Inrag'd Almanzor rows to ford the Flood Oth' present danger, or with his own blood, Augment the stream, with that he flies among, Those that are nearest of the numerous throng, Who, when they found what difference was between Their Clubs (blunt as their Valor) and the keen Edge of his Sword would have fell back, but are Forc'd on by those behind, who being far From danger, fear it not. Thus some are forc'd To fight, till their unwilling Souls divorc'd From their cold Lodgings made their peace; but here Whilst he a Conqu'ror reigns, ingenious fear, Taught them that dust no neerer come, to do Most mischief at a distance, climb'd unto The Rocks inequitable Clifts: from thence They shower down stones that equally dispense, Danger 'mongst Friends and Foes; had she not been Defended by her Coach, their Princess in This storm had perisht: or had fear of death Unfixt her thoughts, she'd spent that pretious breath, Now sacrificing in her prayers to be From their wild rage deliverd safe, but she (Opprest with Lethargies of sorrow) lends No eare to this rude fight, on which depends, So much of Fate, danger appears to ly, Not more in the disease, then remedy. Whilst the oppos'd Almanzor now had neer Hewd forth his way through all of them, appear
More company by their loud clamors drew, Unto their timely aide; now danger grew, Horrid and threatning, till the impeeous shower, Wetting the Wings of the fierce Rebels power; Clog all his hopes of flight, unless he leave, His trembling prey behind him; to bereave Him of his last of hopes, he sees his train Begin to drop▪ with those that yet remain He thinks it time, whilst undiscover'd, to Secure himself, which difficult to do; At length (though not unwounded) he alone Breaks through their Forces, blest in being unknown: Else had their batterd Weapons spar'd to shed The blood of others, and had surfeited On his, which adding knowledge to the fire Of Rage, they had most reason to desire. The unsuccesful Rebel thus secur'd, By speedy flight, his train not long endur'd The circling danger, which from each side sends, Symptomes so deadly, all their strength deends Not the rude torrent, nor their prayers could calm Their Foes stern rage; sweet Mercies healing Balm Is the extraction of brave Spirits, which (By innate valor rarified) enrich With that fair Jem, the triumphs of success, Whilst Cowards make the Victors glory less, Their highest flame of rage being but dull earth, Fir'd into tyranny, the spurious birth Of a precedent fear, whose baseness knows No calm, but what from others danger grows. And now the field, scourd by the beastly rage Oth' savage Clowns, had left no Foe t' engage
A Life, nor could their policy perswade Them to let one survive, till he had made The Plot discoverd, with rude hast they crush Their trembling Souls out, and all Weapons blush, In part of th' bod, so many bands had gave Them hurt less Wounds, that the expecting Grave, Needs only take their Bones, for madly they Had mic'd their flesh for th' Vultures easier prey. This Vict'ry gaind, they hast to th' Coach, and thence The unknown Princess take, no large expence Of prayers, pourd from Florenza's fears could be, So powerful to obtain Civility. She tels them who their rage prophanes, and by Their Princess Name conjures them, but the high Exalted out-cries drown her voice, till one, Who had the Rape of the sad Lady known, When first performd, did with a louder voice Proclaim her there, and having first made choice Of a more civil Companvt' oppose Th' uncivil Clowns, rescues her, and then shews, How neer their heedless rage had cast away The glorious Prize of that victorious day. From fainting slumbers raisd, the Princess now Secure in their discovery, taught them how To turn her Fury into Zeal, and show By serving her, the Allegiance that they ow Her royal Father. To the Palace come, Rewarding all, she there commands that some Stay for her Guard, but soon that Order grew A troublesome obedience, none would to His Cottage, whilst that any stayed within The Palace Gates, but long they had not been
Thus burthensomly diligent, ere on A new design, each struggles to be gone From's former Charge; a Messenger is sought, Who to the Court must post, but each one thought Himself of most ability, so all Or none must go, yet ere the difference fall Into a neer approaching quarrel, he Who rescu'd her, the Princess chose to be Her Messenger. Euriolus (for so The Youth was cald) disdaining to be slow, Where such Commands gave Wings, with speed unto The Court was come, but busie Fame out-flew His eager hast, and ere's Arrival spread Some scatterd fragments of the news, which bred Suspition of that doubt full truth, from whence His Message leads to doleful Confidence, The end of the first Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The second Book. CANTO THE SECOND. The ARGUMENT. III. Fre from suspition by a Cause that tells His injur'd Prince, Almanzors guilt exceed His great'st mistrust, from thence just anger swells, Till for that Feaver the whole Nation bleeds. IV. Armies united in a dreadfull hast, From distant places sad Spectators bring, To see by Fortune Justice so defac'd, The Subjects here pursue a Conquer'd King. MOrea's prudent Prince, whose scars had bin Before this Message, but like truths wrapt in Dark Oracles; now, with a sence inlarg'd, Beyond imperfect doubts, no longer charg'd
His Judgment with Dilemma's, but in all The hast indulgent Love, when by the call Of danger frighted, could procure, without Staying to let slow Counsel urge a doubt, Which might but seem a Remora unto His fixt desires, having together drew; His Guard was marching; when, in such a hast As breathless speed fore-shewd they had been chac'd By some approaching danger, such as were Too full of truth, and loyalty to bear, Rebellion longer, then their thoughts could be Eas'd of the burthen by discoverie: Arrive at th' Court with this sad news, that by Almanzor (who forgetting Loyalty) Had seiz'd Alcithiu's Castle, they were drove To fly their Country, since that there he strove To raise an Army, by whose strength he might, To the Swords power subject the Scepters right, By this sad news startl'd out of his late Fixt resolutions, the vext Prince whose Fate Had not through all the progress of his Reign, Darted so many Plagues to entertain Them now with strength unballast, cals in hast His late neglected Counsel, and embrac'd This sudden, but mature advice, that he Should with such Forces as could soonest be Prepar'd for service, having only seen Pharonnida, possess that streight between The Castle, and the Mountains, from whose rude Inhabitants, which Nature did include Within those Rocks, Rebellion soonest might Grow to a dangerous tumour, the dim light
Of scarce discerned Majesty, so far Being from them remov'd, that least a War, Inforc'd him to command their aide, they nere Heard of his Mandates, being more fit to bear The weight of Armour on their bodies, then Of Taxes on Estates, so smal that when With all the art of Industry improv'd, For want were kept, but not for ease belov'd. Through paths that no Vestigia shewed to these As being retaind, or lost with greatest ease; Since naturally unconstant, comes the King, Not much too late, Majestick Rayes did bring Props to their wavering Faith that yet remaind Unclad in lawless Armes, some being gaind Unto Almanzor, whose revolt had brought That freedome those, whose subtile plots long sought For Innovations, wisht; the sickly State In sad Eruptions, such as future Fate, From sacred truths, speaks deadly symptomes in Relaxes, all that order which had been Till now her Cement; the soft harmony Of peaceful Contracts, sadly silenc'd by That discord, in whose flames the Kingdome burnd, Had all their Measures into Marches turnd. Throughout his Dominions speedy Orders flow, For raising Troops; whilst with such hast, as new Shorn Meadows, when approaching stormes are nigh, Tir'd Labourers huddle up; both parties try To levy Armies. The sad Scholar throws His Books aside, and now in practice shews His studied Theoricks; the stiff Labourer leaves Ith' half-shorn fields the uncollected sheaves,
To female Taskers, and exchangd his hook Into a Sword; each busie Trade that took Pains in the nicer Ornaments of peace, Sit idle till Want forc't them to encrease The new raisd Troops; that Ornament oth' Hall, Old Armours, which had nothing but a Wall Of long time sav'd from the invading dust, From Cobwebs swept, though its Enamel rust Stick close, and on th' unpractic'd Soldier put, Forth of their breasts, nor fear, nor danger shut. Yet with an Army of this temper in Hast huddl'd up, the wandring Prince had been Inforc'd to fight, had not his just Cause brought Some loyal Gentry, such, whose Vertue sought Truth for reward, unto his side, with which He now advances more compleatly rich, In noble Valour, then's rebellious Foes, In numerous Troops; no Enemies oppose His speedy March, till being now come near Alcithius Fort, Almanzors timely fear, Hurries him thence; his better Fate depends On larger hopes; unto such constant friends, As equal guilt by sympathy secur'd, To him he leaves the Castle, and assur'd Them of relief, with what convenient speed, Those of his Faction (which did only need His presence to confirm rebellion by, An injur'd power) could draw their Armies nigh. As hence he marches, each succesful hour Augments his strength, till the unlawful power, Trebl'd his injur'd Princes; but as they Who carry guilt about them, do betray
Her by her Sister fear, so these whose Crimes Dtected, durst not, in more peaceful times, Look Justice in the face, and therefore now Stood vail'd in Armes against her, fearing how She might prevail 'gainst power, march not till A greater strength their empty bosomes fill With hope, a tumor which doth oft dilate The narrow Souls of Cowords, till their Fare Flatter them into ruine, then forsakes Them in an Earthquake, whose pale terror shakes Base Souls to flight, whilst noble valor dies, Adorn'd with Wounds, Fames bleeding Sacrifice. Almanzors doubtful Army, since that here The threatning storm at distance did appear, Lockt in a Calme, possest with confidence, Slowly their Squadrons move, but had from thence Not a daies journey marcht, before the sad News of Alcithiu's desperate danger had Pal'd o're their Camp, which whilst the Leaders strove To animte, Almanzor faster drove On those designs, which (prospering) might prevent It from surrender, but the time was spent Too far before. The Governor that kept It now, against his Prince too long had slept, In the preceding down of peace, to be Awakn'd into valour, only he Had seen't kept clean from Cobwebs, and perhaps The Guns shot off, when those loud thunder-claps Proclaim'd a storm of healths; yet till he saw The threatning danger circularly draw An armed Line about him, in as high A voice as valor, could a Foe defie,
He clothes his fears, which shook the false disguise Off with the first assault, and swiftly flies To's Princes mercy, whose pleas'd Soul he found Heighten'd, to have his first attempt thus crownd With Victory, which nere made his Army less, Nor steept in blood, though travaild to success. To this new Conquest, as a place whose strength, He best might trust, if to a tedious length, Or black Misfortune, the ensuing War, His Fate should spin, his choicest treasures are, Together with her, in whose safety he, Plac'd Life it self, brought for security. This done, that now no slow delaies might look Like feare, he with his loyal Army took The field, in which he'd scarce a Level chose, To rallie's Army, ere his numerous Foes, Appear on th' tops of the adjacent Hill, Like Clouds, which when presaging storms, do fill Dark Southern Regions: In a plain that lay So near, that both the Armies full survay, Might from the Clifts, on which Alcithius stands, Be safely viewd, were the rebellious bands Of 's Enemies descending, on each side Flank'd by a River which did yet divide Him from the Prince, who having time to choose What ground to fight on, did that blessing use To's best advantage, on a Bridge which by Boards closely linkt had forc'd an unity Betwixt the Banks, his Army past, he now Within a Plain, whose spatious bounds allow, Together with a large extention, all, An ancient Leader could convenient call.
Remov'd no tedious distance from his Rear Stood a smal Town, which, as the place took care How to advance so just an interest, might Be useful, when tir'd in the heat of fight, Strength lost in Wounds should force some thither by Wants which a Camp's unfurnisht to supply. More near his Front, betwixt him, and the Plain, Through which Almanzor led his spatious Train, On a smal Hill which gently rose, as though Its eminence, but only strove to shew The fragrant Vale, how much nice Art out-went Their beauties in her brows fair Ornament, A splendid Palace stood, which having been Built but for wanton peace to revel in, Was as unfit for the rough hand of War, As boisterous Armes for tender Virgins are. To this, since now of consequence unto The first Possessor had both Armies drew; Commanded parties, which ere Night shut in, Lights latest Rayes, did furiously begin The first hot Skirmish, which continuing till Dark shadows all the Hemisphear did fill, To such as Fear, or Novelty had sent, To th'Hils safe tops, such dreadful prospect lent, By the swift rising of those sudden fires, In whose short close, that fatal sound expires; Which tels each timerous Auditor its breath, To distant breasts, bears unexpected death: That whilst their eyes direct their thoughts unto Their danger, whom Reward or Honour drew To the Encounter, all the uncouth sight Affords, to horror turns that strange delight▪
These circling fires drawn neer their Center, in Such tumult, as Armies engag'd begin Deaths fatal task, a dreadful sound surpriz'd The distant Ear, danger, that lay disguiz'd In darkness yer, now, as if wak'nd by The Conquerors shouts, so general, and so high That it even drownd the clamourous Instruments Of fatal War, her Vale of sables rents, From round the Palace, by that horrid light, Which her own Turrets, through the steams of Night In dreadful blazes sent, discovering both The shadowed Armies, who like Mourners loth To draw too near their sorrows Center, while Their friends, consume, surround the blazing Pile, In such a sad and terrible aspect, That those engag'd in Action, could neglect Approaching danger, to behold how they Like Woods grown near the foot of Aetna lay, Whilst the proud Palace from her sinking Wals, In this sharp Feavers fiery Chrisis fals. But now the Nights, as wearied with a Rain, So ful of trouble, had resign'd again, The earths divided Empire, and the day Grown strong in light, both Armies did display To their full view, who to the Mountain, in Sad expectation of th' event, had been▪ Early Spectators cal'd; here, seated nigh Their female friends, old men exempted by Weakness from Wars to, rough encounters, shew Those Colours which, their active Youth did know Adorn the field, when those that now engage, Like tender Plants, kept for the future age,
In blooming Childhood were, 'mongst this they tell What Heroes in preceding Battels fel, Where Victory stoop to Valor, and where rent From brave desert by fatal Accident: Then ere their story can a period have, Shew Wounds they took, and tell of some they gave. This sad Praeludium, to an action far More dismal past, the unvaild Face of War Looks big with horror; now both Armies draw So neer, that their divided Brothers saw Each others guilt (that too too common sin Of civil War.) Rebellions Sons stood in Armes 'gainst their Fathers clad: friends that no cross Could dis-unite, here found the fatal loss Of Amity, and (as presaging blood) Ith' worst Aspect, sad opposition stood, One was their fashion, form, and discipline, Strict Heraulds in one Scutcheon did combine Th' Armes of both Armies, yet all this must be By Wars wild rage rob'd of its unity. Whilst like sad Saturn, ominous and slow, Each Army mov'd, some Youths set here to grow By forward Actions, stately Cedars, to Adorn Fames Court, like shooting Stars were flew, So bright, so glittering, from th' unweildy throng Of either Army, which being mixt among Each other, in a swift Numidian fight, Like Aires small Atomes, when discovering light Betraies their motion shews, some hours had past In this light Skirmish, till now near Wars last Sad Scean arriv'd, as the distrest heart cals, Before the body deaths pale Victim fals,
Those Spirits that dispers'd by action were Back to their Center, their Commanders care, Summons these in, that so united strength Might swiftly end, or else sustain the length Of that black storm, where yet that danger stood, Which must ere long fall in a shower of blood. A dismal silence, such as oft attends Those that surround the death-beds of their friends, In the departing minute, reigns throughout, Both Armies Troops, who gather'd now about Their several Standards, and distinguisht by Their several colours, such variety Presents the eye with, that whilst the sad thought Beholds them but as falling branches brought To the decay of time, their view did bring In all the pleasures of the checkquerd Spring. Like a large field, where being confin'd unto Their several squares, here blushing Roses grew, There purpl'd hiacinths, and neer to them, The yellow Cowslip bends its tender stem, To th' Mountains top, the Army marching low, Within the Vale, their several Squadrons shew. This silent time, which by command was set Asido to pay Confessions needful debt, To oft offended Heaven, whose aide though gave Ere askt, yet since our duty is to crave, Expects our prayers, the Armies from their still Devotion rais'd, declare what Spirits fill Their breast, by such an universal joy, As to get Young, and not the Old destroy, Each had by beauteous Paranymphs been led, Not to rough War, but a soft Nuptial Bed.
That fatal hour, by time, which though it last, Till fixt Stars have a perfect Circle past, We still think short, to Action brought, which now So near approacht, it could no more allow The Generals to consult, although there need, Nought to augment, when Valours flame doth feed, High on the hopes of Victory, the rage Of eager Armies, ere their Troops engage Their several Leaders, all that Art did use, By which loud Wars rough Rhetorick doth infuse Into those bodies, on whose strength consists Their safety, Souls whose brave Resolves might twist Them into Chains of Valour, which no force Then death less powerful, ever should divorce. The Prince, as more depending on the just Cause that had drawn his Sword, which to distrust, Looks like a Crime, soonest commits the day To Fates Arbitrement; no more delay Comforts the ainting Coward: a sad sound Of Cannon gave the Signal, and had drownd The murmuring Drum in silence, Earth did groan, In trembling Ecchoes, on her sanguine Trone High mounted Horrour sits, wild Rage doth fill Each breast with Fury, whose fierce flames distill, Life through th' Alimbecks of their Rins, that Cloud Of dust, which when they first did move, a shrowd Of darkness vaild them in, allayd with blood, Fell to the Earth, whose Clefts a crimson flood, Fil'd to the brim, and when it could contain No more, let forth those purple streams to stain The blushing fields, which being made slppery by Th' unnatural shower, there lets them sink and dy:
Whose empty veins rent in this fatal strife, Here dropt the treasure of exhausted Life. In sad exchange of wounds, whilst the last breath, Even flying forth to give another death; Supports the fainting Spirits, all were now Sadly imploy'd, arm'd danger could allow, In this loud storm of Action, none to stand Idle Spectators, but each busie hand Labours in deaths great work, his life to sell At rates so dear, that Foe by which he fell, To boast his gain survives not; but now in This mart of death, blind Fortune doth begin To shew her self Antagonist unto Less powerful Justice; In the common view Of reason, which by the external shape Of Actions only judges, no escape From their desert, Captivity, was left, The Rebels Armie, but th' unmanly theft Of secret flight, to some, protected by Their Fellows loss, when in a rage as high As if it had attempted to out-roar The Battels thunder, a rude Tempest bore From Southern Climates, on th' exalted wings Of new-rais'd winds, a change so fatal brings, To th' royal Army, that from Vict'ries near, Succesful pride, unto extreams which fear Did nere suggest, it brought them back to view Their glorious hopes thus sadly over-threw. A strong reserve, rais'd by his friends to be Almanzors rescue, if that Victorie, Seem'd to assist the juster part, was now Brought neer the River, which endeavouring how
To ford, they there unwillingly had been Detaind, till strength had prov'd but useless in The Princess Conquest, if the swelling flood, VVhose added streams (too strong to be withstood) Had not in that impeteous torrent tore That Bridge which past the royal Army o're; Whose severd Boats borne down the River, made So sad a change, that whilst their Foes invade, Their Rear on them, the late lamented loss, Forbid the others when dispers'd to cross Their Waves by dangers, which in each breast bred Terrors as great as those from whence they fled. The valiant Army, like Lifes Cittadel, The heart, when nought but poysonous Vapours swel Every adjacent part, long strugling in Deaths sharp Convulsions, out of hopes to win Ought there but what buyes the uncertain breath Of future Fame, at the high price of death; At length, not conquerd, but o're burthend by A flood of power, in Nights obscurity, When dreadful shadows had the field o're-spread, As Darkness were a Herse-cloath for the dead; That this daies losses might not grow too great For reparation, by a hard retreat, Attempt to save such of their strengths, as since Inforc'd to fly, might safely guard the Prince From dangers, which, could but his Foes have viewd, Their motions all had unto death purfu'd. In this distress, from that vast Sea of blood, The field where late his Army marshald stood, The wretched Prince retires, but with a train So smal they seemd, like those that did remain
After a Deluge, where the Rivers course, (Stopt with dead bodies) run with smallest force, He venters o're the flood, whose guilty Waves, Blushes in blood; some few whom Fortune saves T' attend on his, a like succesful by That bold adventure, whilst the Prince doth fly, To guard Alcithius, by his Mandates are, Since the disasters of this fatal War Forc'd him to seek for more assistance, sent To the Epicte, striving to prevent Those wild reports, that on the quick belief, Of female fear, might be impos'd by grief, He hasts to bear the sad Report to her, Whose sorrows lost to see the Messenger. The end of the second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The second Book. CANTO THE THIRD The ARGUMENT. V. Through the dark terrours of a dreadfull Night, The Prince to's Daughter comes with flying speed From dangers great, as those he fear'd in flight, Is by Argalia's forward Valour freed. VI. Who having with succesfull Fortune gave His Master freedome, their joyn'd strength pursue Their flying Foes unto an uncuth Cave, In whose vast Womb Fates dark decrees they view. THis last Retreat, which seemd but to defer Danger by being Honours Sepulcher, Attaind in hast, there calming all the strife Of various Passion, since her Fathers Life,
Payd all the tears she owd his losses, he His verteous Daughter found, prepar'd to be No sad addition to his sorrow by, The faults of female Imbecillity, Untimely tears; but with a confidence High as ere taught brave Valour to dispense With sad disasters, arm'd to entertain The worst of Ills, to ease the Wounded's pain, Or stop their blood, those hands which once she thought Should have to Victors Triumphs Garlands brought, Are now imployd, yet that her Acts may be The best examples to posterity; Her present ill, she with such strength withstood, Its power was lost in hopes of future good. Precipitated from a Throne to be Subjected by a Subjects tyranny: To want their pity, who of late did know No peace, but what his Influence did bestow, With sad presaging fears, to think his fair, His verteous Daughter, his rich Kingdomes Heir; Like to be ravisht from his bafl'd power, A Trophy to a rebel Conqueror, With such afflicting griefs as did exclude, The comforts of his passive Fortitude, Opprest the Prince, when now an Army led, By their pursuing Enemies ore-spread The circling fields, and brings their fear within The reach of th' Eye; heighten'd with hope to win That now by parl, which ere the sad success Of Battel made their conquer'd numbers less, He feard in fight; the confidently bold Almanzor in a Scrowl that did unfold
A Language, whose unreverend stile affords Far more of anger then his Soldiers Swords, Had ere stird fear within his Princes breast, His fixt Intentious thus in brief exprest; —Great Sir, NO airy tumour of untam'd desire, Nurst my Ambition, prompts me to aspire To any Action that may sore above My Birth or Loyalty, it was the love I bore your verteous Daughter, that first clad Me in defensive Armes, which never had Been else unsheathd, though't had been to defend Me from Injustice, should your Sword extend Its power to tyranny; but failing in That first attempt, ere streams of blood had bin Shed in addition to those drops, my hand Had broke my Sword as guilty, had this Land, To whom I owe, for the first Aire I breathd, Not washt the stain in tears, and since unsheathd It in the name of Justice; to their good, Which trembling on uncertain hopes hath stood, Whilst fearing forrein Governours, I have Added my love, and satisfaction crave For both, before a greater ill may fall, To make our sufferings Epidemical, By being slaves to some proud Tyrant, that, In politick Ambition reaches at A Kingdom by profest Affection, and, Marries your Daughter, to command your Land. This Scrowl, spotted with Impudence, receiv'd By the vext Prince, whom passion had bereav'd
Of politick Evasions, he returns A swift defiance, but his high rage burns Nought but his own scortcht breast, the fainting fire, Quencht by constraint, wants Fuel to blaze higher, Then flashy threatnings, which since prov'd a folly, Sink in the Ashes of Melancholy; For which his ablest Councel could prepare, No Cordial of advice, they rather share With him in sorrow, whose harsh burthen growes Not lighter by the company of those, That now lend hearts to bear it, only in This sullen Clouds obscurity, this sin Of their Nativity, the noble Soul, Of the undaunted Princess did controul, The harshest Lectures of her Stars, and sate, Unshaken in this Hyrocane of Fate; Calming her Fathers hot adversity With Dews of comfort, taught him how to be Prince of his Passions, a Command more great, Then his that trembles in a regal seat. The Enemy that vainly had till now, Toil'd forth their strength, no more endeavours how By force to conquer, some smal time they knew, Would with the bloodless Sword of Famine do, More then their Cannon could, the meager Fen Already grew tyrannical, his men, Like walking Ghosts, wait on their Prince and stand For shadows on their Plat-forms, not a hand, But was unnerv'd with want, yet whilst each part Languisht tow'rd death, each bosome held a heart, Which though most large, could never empty he, Being doubly fil'd with grife and loyalty:
Amongst both which, hope for a part puts in, As the Supporter, of what else had been A burthen insupportable, and spoke This pleasing Language, that the royal Oke Beneath whose Winter Fortune now they stood, Pining for want, the witherd under Wood, That all his miseries dropt on, yet they shall When ere his brighter Stars again do call His Fortune into light, be comforted By his kind shadow; which shall those that fled Him in this sad extream, then leave to be Scortcht in the Rays of angry Majesty. Reduc'd unto this pitied exigence, Yet by his honour, which could not dispense With ought that like suspition lookt, detaind, From what by parl might have their freedome gaind, The loyal Sufferers, to declare how far They fear declind, those mourning weeds of War, Whose fight a desperate valour doth betray, Black En signs on their guarded Wals display, When to augment their high resolves, with what Their valour was to pity so fned at, After, with all those course, though scarce Cates, they By sparing, first attempted to betray Time till relief with, they'd been fed till now There nought remaind, that longer could allow Life further hopes of sustenance, to do An Act so great, all Ages to ensue, Shall more admire then imitate; within The Hall, appears their Soveraign, leading in His hand the Princess, whose first view, though drest In Robes as sad as sorrow ere exprest,
Was but the Frontiers of their grief, to what When nearer seen, whilst sorrow silenc'd at So sad on Object, might for death be took, Made solemn grief, like grave Religion look. Whilst all thus in sad expectation stand, Of future Fate, disdaining to command, Those whom an equal sorrow seemd to make His fellow Sufferers, the sad Prince thus spake His fixt resolves, Brave Souls, whose loyal love, Opprest by my unhappy woes must prove Part of my grief, since by my wretched Fate, Forc'd with my own life to precipitate Yours into danger, from whose reach, since by No Crime, until the love of Loyalty Become a sin, you are cal'd guilty, yet Seek some evasion, 'tis not you that sit Upon the Throne he aimes at, nor doth here Arival in Pharonnida appear. No, 'tis our lives, our lives brave Subjects that His bold Ambition only reaches at, By this pretense, what to my Daughter, love To's Country's, pity cal'd, could he remove Those (now but smal Obstructions) soon would grow To's pride united, till it over flow, All limets of a Subjects duty, by Rebellious reach, usurped tyranny. Go then, and let not my unhappiness Afflict you more, ith' shadow of distress; Twil like warm comforts swel my Soul to know That to his Favour you for safety ow. Did not those sacred Canons that include, All vertue in a Christians Fortitude,
Obstruct our Passions progress, we, ere this, In death had made the haughty Rebel miss The glory of his Conquest, which since now Den'd, although unweildy age allow Not strength to sell my life at such a rate Honour aimes at, yet shall the slow debate, Even in my fall, let the World know I died, Scorning his pity, as they hate his pride. Here stopt the Prince, when, as if every breast, One universal sorrow had possest, Grief (grown into more noble passion) broke Th' attentive silence, and thus swiftly spoke Their resolution, On, on, and lead Us unto death, no Critick eye shall read Fear through the Opticks of our Souls, but give Command to act, here's not a heart durst live Without obedience; camforted with this Rich Cordial, from his sorrows dark Abyss Rais'd to resolves, whose greatness equal'd all His former Glory, by their fatal fall; To darken the ensuing day, the Prince Gives a Command to all his Train, that since Their own free Votes elected death, they now With Souls that no terrestial thought allow, A residence, 'gainst the next Morn prepare, That wisht for freedome, with himself to share. All sadly sate, expecting but that light, Whose near approach must to eternal Night, Their last Conductor be, a sudden, still, And doleful silence, such as oft doth fill The Room where sick men slumber, when their Friends Stand weeping by, to Contemplation bends
Their busie thoughts; within each troubl'd breast, Being to leave the Mansion she'd possest So long, yet with so short a warning, all Her Faculties the frighted Soul did call, Forth of the Bosome of those Causes, in Whose form they'd fetterd to their Crasis been, To joyn those powers (yet strong in living breath) For her assistance in the grasp of death. The whispering Trumpet having cal'd them by Such sharp Notes, as, when powerful Foes are nigh Retreating Parties use, all swiftly rise From bended Knees, and the last Sacrifice, They ere expect to pay to Heaven, untill Their Souls last gasp the vocal Orgains fill. Concluded was the last sad interview, The Prince was marcht, Pharonnida with-drew. And now, all from the open'd Ports were in A swift March sallying, had their speed not been Thus swiftlier stopt; those scatterd horse that fled The Battel to th' Epirotes Court had sped So well in their Embassage, that the Prince Whom the least negligence might now convince Of want of love, proud of so fair a chance; To shew's Affection, swiftly doth advance With a vast Army tow'rd them, but the fear, Prevailing danger, ere their strength come near, To their necessitated Friends, might force Them to unworthy Articles, some horse Selected are, whose swifter speed might, (by A desperate charge broke through their Foes) supply Their fainting friends; the much desir'd Command Of these few men, committed to the and
Of brave Argalia (nere more blest then now In serving the fair Princess) did allow His Sword so fair a field to write the story, Of Honour in, that his unblasted Glory, Beyod this day shall live, out-live the reach Of long-armd Envy, and those weake Souls teach, That fear the frowns of Fate, in spight of all, Heroick Vertue sits too high to fall. With the dayes close they take their March, and ere The silver Morning on her brow did bear The burnisht guilt oth' Suns warm Rayes, arrive In view oth' place; when Fortune, that did strive To crown their hopes, had wrapt the earth in thick And heavy mists; the sluggish Morning sick Of Midnight surfeis, from her dewy bed, Pale, and discolourd Rose. This Curtain spread, To vail their plot in, they assault their Foes, Which when surpriz'd could not themselves dispose, Fit for resistance, but whilst some did flie From the distracting danger, others die To their neglect a Sacrifice: the swift Alarm, like a rude winds circling drift, Hurries confusion through the field, and shook The trembling Soldier: some unclad forsook Their half-fir'd Cabbens; deaths large gripe did take Whole troops that Destiny ordaind to wake No more till Dooms-day, and in's march prevents Th' unition of unrallied Regiments. This frighted Language of Confusion heard, By those oth' Castle, which were now prepard, For their last desperate Sally, switly draws Them to assist their friends, and though the cause,
(Being yet unknown) was only thought to be Some private Jar grown to a Mutiny, Or else the noise the Enemy had made, When all their force was drawing to invade Them in their works, howe're, they stand not to Consult with reason, but as striving who Shall first encounter death, each severall hand Sought for his own from those that did withstand His rage-directed strength; their Cannon in A Funeral Peal went off, whose steam had been Their Covert to the Camp, where finding such A wild confusion, they assisted much The fortune of the day, which now was grown Indubitable, they might call their own A glorious Conquest, the thick sulphry cloud, Whose dismal shade did that destruction shroud, Rent with those thunder-claps, dissolv'd into A shower of blood, what she vouchsaft to do, Fortune lends light to shew them; having left Their Camp, whilst darkness did protect a Theft, That only stole dishonour, which they were Now in an open flight inforc'd to bear; They see Almanzors broken troops ore-spread The neighbouring fields: those clouds of men that fled, Being pursu'd by Companies so smal, That they appeard but like those drops that fall After a storm. Yet as the labouring Hart Long struggles for that life which doth depart From the less noble Members, to lend aid To her in deaths pale Conflict, having stayd Some of his best Commanders, hoping by Their valour to recal the rest, with high
Undaunted force, Almanzor doth oppose, His Enemies pursuit, till like t' inclose Him in, disdaining the reproachful end, He must expect, no longer stands t' attend The glimering light of hope: the field he leaves To conquering Argalia, but deceives Him of himself, the prize most sought for, which When lost beyond recovery, he grown rich In shining honour, that, like Sun-beams plac'd Within a field of gules, by being defac'd, Had beautifi'd his Armour; that dark mist, Which did at first such contradictions twist, That he both curst, and blest it, one cause did Aide his design, the other cause it hid His Heaven of Beauty, in their dewy Bed Had left the blushing Roses, and was fled Upon the Wings of th' wind. With wonder now Discoverd colours taught each party how, To know their Friends. The royal Standard in The Princes party had disvellopt been, By that fair signal to discover, who Was present there: but ere Argalia to That place arriv'd, Pharonnida, who had, Whilst desperation all her beauties clad In the pale Robes of fear, heard all the loud Shock of the Conflict, but until the Cloud Remov'd his fatal Curtain, never knew How near the hour of her delivery drew; That being dissolv'd, through those which grief had rais'd, In her fair Eyes, did see, and seeing praised Just Heaven which sent it; each of those that Fought for her she commends, but wonders at,
Although unknown, the lightning valour she Saw in Argalia, whilst with just rage he Unravels Natures workmanship, a rent Which were a sin, if not a punishment, And from the slender web of life did send Forth Rebels Souls, fast as each busie Fiend, That wait their fals transport them, fain she would, Ere known, conceit 'twere he, but how he should Come there, and so attended did exceed Imagination. Thus whilst her hopes feed On strange desires, being come near unto The Coach wherein she sate, prepard to do His Loves Oblations, he that Face disarms, Which when beheld, by those attractive charms, VVithin the center of her best desires, Contracted all her hopes, whose life expires, Soon as they'r crownd with wisht success; too great A distance parts them yet, she leaves her seat, And flies to his Imbraces, but conceald Her passion in his Merit, being reveald To him alone, whose better judgment knew, That in those Spirit-breathing beams that flw Through the fair Casements of her Eyes, did move The secret Language of an ardent love. This conflict of her passions, which had been Fought betwixt fear and hope, was setled in A silent joy, that from her noble breast Struggl'd for passage, whilst Argalia blest Above his hopes, in burning kisses seals His service on her Virgin hand, that steals From thence new flames into her heart, which ere Fed with desire, even whilst she did prepare,
To entertain those welcome Guests, appears The Prince, who now, thawd from the icy fears Of desperation, was come there to give Thanks to his unknown friends; but words did live Within a place too baren to bestow That fruitful zeal, whose plenty did or-flow His Eyes (those clouded Orators) which till Disburthend did capacious passion fill. This moist Gale o're, when now they had awhile Melted in joy, cloathing it with a smile; He thus unfolds his comfort. Blessed Fates You have out-try'd my charity, he hates All real Vertue, that confesses not My care of thee, was but an unknown spot To this large world of satisfaction; here Kind sorrow stopt his voice again, when fear Their Enemies might rally, and ith' bud Blast all their blooming joyes, even whilst the blood Wreak'd on his Sword, leaving their Eyes to pay Pursuing prayers, Argalia posts away, But finds his Foes disperst, excepting one Stout Regiment, whose desperation grown To valour, spight of all pursuers, made Good their retreat; till forc'd at length to shade Themselves from the pursuing danger, in A deep dark Cave, whose spatious Womb had been Their Receptacle, when unlawfull theft Was their profession. In this place they'd left Their dearest pledges, as most confident Those dark Meanders would their loss prevent. These stout Opposers being protected here, (Before Argalia brought his Army neer)
Had fortifi'd the narrow pass, and now Presume of safety, since none else knew how, Without their leave to enter; Hem'd about, With all the Castle Foot, his Horse sent out To clear the field, the careful General sees, Then every Quarter made secure, he frees His own from all suspected danger, while This busie Siege did better things beguile Of some few steps of time, the Prince arrives, To see the Leager, where each Captain strives With entrance to be honourd, but in vain, The subtile Engineer here racks his Brain: The Mountains yeild not to their Cannon shock, Nor mine could pierce the marble-breasted Rock. Thus whilst they lay despairing ere to force, A place so difficult, with some few Horse Only attended, the vext Prince surrounds The spaious Hill, whose uncouth sight confounds His ablest Guides; making a stand to view A Promontory, on whose brow there grew A Grove of stately Cedars, from a dark And hidden cleft, proud of so rich a Mark; Some Mus kets are discharg'd, which missing by A desperate Sallie's seconded, to fly The danger thorough such a dreadful way, As now they were to pass, was not to stay, But hasten ruine, though too weak, in fight More safety lay, then an unworthy flight. But Valour, like the royal Eagle, by A cloud of Crows ore-masterd, less to dy With honour, had no refuge left, and that Here each Plebeian gains; when frighted at
Th' unusual clamour, with such troops as were Most fit for speed, Argalia was come there; Arriv'd even with that minute which first saw His Prince a Captive; Now the Rebbels draw Back to their private Salliport, but are Too speedily pursu'd to enter far, Within their dark Meanders, ere ore-took, By their inraged Foes, who had forsook Their other stations, and to this alone, Drew all their Forces, entring the unknown And horrid Cave, whose troubled Womb till then, Nere such a Cholick felt: Argalia's men, (Following so brave a Leader) boldly tred Through the Rocks rugged Entrails; those that fled Though better skild in their obscure retreat, No safety find; the Caves remotest seat Was now the stage of death, together throng'd, After their Swords had Lifes last step prolong'd; There all the Villains in despair had di'd, Had not the fear their Prince in such a tyde Of blood might have been shipwrackt, whom to save, A gen'ral Pardon to the rest is gave. And now the dreadful Earthquake which had turnd The Rock to Aetna, could its top have burnd, With Subteranean fires, being ceas'd, the Prince Desirous by his knowledge to convince, Those word-deep wonders, which report had spread, Of that strange Cave, commands some to be led By an old Out-law, whose experience knew The uncouth Vaults remotest Corners, to Those seats of horrour, which performd, and word Returnd again, the danger did afford,
Subject for nobler Spirits; forthwith he (Attended by Argalia) goes to see What had afrighted them; the dreadfull way, Through which he past, being steep, and rugged lay, Between two black and troubled streams, that through The cleft Rock rowld with horrid noise, till to An ugly Lake, whose heavy streams did ly Unstird with aire they come, and there are by That black Asphaliis swallowd; a strang sound Of yelling Dragons, hissing Snakes confound Each trembling Auditor, till comforted By bold Argalia, ventring first to tread On stones, which did like ruin'd Arches ly Above the surface of the Lake, he's by Their aid brought to an ancient Tower, that stood Fixt in the center of the lazy flood; Its Basis founded on a Rock, whose brow With age disfigur'd into clefts, did now With loud and speedy ruine threaten to Crush all beneath it; round about it flew On sooty wings such ominous Birds as hate The cheerful day, Vipers, and Scorpions sate Circl'd in darkness, till the cold damp breath Of neer concreted Vapours, sing'd to death, By th' numerous light of Torches, which did shine Through the whole Mountains Convex, and refin Aire with restraint corrupted, forcing way, By conquering flames recals the banisht day. Come now to a black Tower, which seemd to be The Throne of some infernal Deity, That his extended Lawes reaches unto The brazen Gate, whose folded Leaves withdrew,
Assaul their eyes with such a flux of light, That as the dim Attendants of the Night, In bashful duty shun the Prince of Day, So their lost Tapors unto this give way; Whilst it with wonder, that belief out-grew, Transports their sights to the amazing view Of so much beauty, that the use of sense Was lost in mre then humane excellence. A glorious Room, so elegantly faire, In 't various structure, that the riotous Heir O h' eastrn Crescent that might choose to be The Theater of shining Majestie They now behold, yet then its mighty strength, Which had preserv'd such beauty from the length Of Ages ire Tallons, there appear More rare perfections, the large floor of clear Transparant Emraulds, lent a luster to The Oval Roof, whose scarce-seen ground was blew, Studded with sparkling Gems, whose brightness lent The beauties of the vaulted Firmament, To all beneath their beams; the figur'd wals, Imbost with rare and antick sculptry, cals For th' next observance, though the serious eye, The way to truth in secret mystery He e having lst, lets the dark Text alone, To view the beauties of a glorious Throne, Which plac'd within the splendid Room, did stand Beneath an Ivory Arch, o're which the hand Of Art, in golden Hierogliphicks, had The story of ensuing Fate unclad, But vainly, since the Art defective times, Strok nought but discords on those wel-tun'd Chimes.
Upon the Throne, in such a glorious state, As earths adored Favourites there sate, The Image of a Monarch, vested in The spoils of Natures Robes, whose price had been A Diadems redemption, his large size, Beyound this Pigmy Age, did equalize Th' admir'd proportion of those mighty men, Whose cast-up bones, grown modern wonders, when Found out, are carefully preserv'd to tell Posterity, how much these times are fell From Natures youthful strength, if be not worse, Our sins Stenography, the dwarffish Cuse Ordaind for large siz'd Luxury: before The Throne a Lamp, whose fragrant Oyles had more Perfum'd the Room, then all the bamy wealth Of rich Arabia, stood: Light, Life, and Health, Dwelt in its Odours, but what more contents, The pleas'd Spectators, that fai hand presents The rest to th' view: the Image to declare Of whom th' Effigies was, on's Front did bear A regal Crown, and in his hand sustaind, A threatning Scepter, but what more explain'd Antiquities mysterious dress was seen, In a smal Tablet, which, as if 't had been Worth more observance, then what Fate exprest In unknown Figures he did gently rest His left hand on, as if endeavouring by That Index to direct Posterity; How in their wonders Altitude to praise The deeper knowledge of those wiser dayes, By reading in such Characters as Time Learnd in her non-age (this) in antick Rhyme.
When striving to remove this Light, To Princes Leaves involv'd in Night; The time draws neer, that shall pull down My old Morea's triple Crown, Vniting on one royall Head, What to disjoyn such discord bred, But let the more remote ake heed, For there's a third ordaind to bleed; For when I'me read, not understood, Then shall Epiru's royall blood, By waies no Mortall yet must know, Within th' Artolian Channel flow. This strange Inscription read, not only by The Prince, but those whom wonder had drawn nigh The sacred Room, their Fancies civil War, Grows full of trouble, 'tis a Text so far Beyond a Comment, that their Judgments in Enigmaes maz'd, had long let motion been In Epeleptick wonder lost, untill (As that alone containd their dreaded ill) The greater part with joynd consents advise, To have the Lamp remov'd, since in it lies, (If those Lines prove prophetick) the linkt Fate Of all Ietian Princes, which debate, Being carried in th' Affirmative, the rest Drew back, whilst bold Argalia forward prest; But's thus soon stayd, the stone on which he stept, Next, was by Art so framd, that it had kept Conceal'd an Engines chifest Spring, which by The least waight toucht, in furious hast let fly
Unpractis'd wheels, and with such vigour strook, The Scepter on the long liv'd Lamp, it shook Its chrystal Wals to dust, not thunders strong Exagitations, when it roars among Heaps of congested Elements, a sound More dreadful makes, but what did most confound Weak trembling Souls, was the thick darkness that Succeeds the dying flame, which wondring at, Whilst all remain, Arts feeble aides supplie The Lamps lost Vertue, with new Lights, but by Cold Damps so darkned, that contracted Night Scornd their weak flames, shewing that hallowd light Containd more sacred Vertues; now as Fate, Had only to that hour prolong'd the date Of all within, a sudden change to dust, The mighty body turns, consuming rust, Had eat the brazen Imagry, and left No sign of what till then, safe from the theft Of time remaind, darkness had repossest The sullen Cave, to an eternal rest; In the rude Chaos of their ashes, all Arts lively Figures in an instant fall. Pleas'd with the sight of these strange Objects more, Then with Wars dangers he was vext before; The Prince with all his train of Conquerors now, Is gone to teach th' expecting Army how To share their wonder, but not far from thence, Removes before confirmd Intelligence, Acquaints him with th' Epirots March, who in Mis swift advance, so fortunate had been, That falling on such as the Mornings flight, Flatterd with hope, they there met endless Night;
At unawares; but of these added numbers, Was curst Almanzor none, yet Justice slumbers Ith' prosecution of his unripe Fate, Which must more horrid ins accumulate; Before cut off, his clamorous guilt must call For vengeance louder, and grow hectical With Custome, til the Tables of his shame, Into oblivion rot his loathed Name. The end of the third Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The second Book. CANTO THE FOURTH. The ARGUMENT. VII. From Wars wide breaches, whence his brave friends had With Victory brought him, th' old Prince arriv'd In safety, whilst fear punishes the bad Rewards that Vertue, which his Cause reviv'd. VIII. In which brave Act, Argalia's Merits met With a reward that even desert out-grew, Whilst him it the fair Princess Guardian set, The root on which Loves fruit to ripeness grew. THat too inferiour Branch, which strove to rise With the Basillick to Anastomize; Thus drain'd, the States Plethorick humours are Reduc'd to Harmony; that blazing Star,
Which had been lifted by rebellious breath, To's exaltation in the house of death; Now lay opprest, which Victory compleat, Leaving his Army, where before the seat Oh' Rebels was, his entertainment by, The welcome Harbenger of Victory, Before prepared, the pleas'd Epirote goes With an exalted joy to visit those, His goodness (whilst unknown) reliev'd, where he Such noble welcome finds, as not to be Imagin'd, but by grateful Souls that know The strength of Curtesie, when 'twould ore-flow Those Merits, which whilst Love incites to praise Our friends deserts, to Pyramids we raise, The narrow Confines of Alcithius Wall, Which kept them safe from dangers past, too smal Grows for that present triumph, that blot out All thoughts of grief, but what are spent about Thansgiving for delivery, which they do Perform in sports, whose choice delights might woo Cold Anchorites from their sullen Cels, the Earth, The Aire, the Sea, all in a plenteous birth, Exhausted their rich Treasuries to pay Tribute to their desires, which could time stay Her Chariot wheels from hurrying down the Hill Of feeble Nature, mans vain thoughts would fill With subaltern delights, most highly priz'd, Till the conclusion (death) hath annaliz'd The doubtful Text, with what lets Mortals know Their blooming joyes must drop to shades below. That great eclipse of Glories rayes, within Whose shades sad Corinth had benighted been:
Since like a widdowed Turth, first she sate A Mourner for her wandring Princes fate; Now like the dayes recoverd Rain breaks forth, In fuller Luster; all excelling worth That honour'd Vertue, or lov'd beauty plac'd Her Ornaments, with their appearance grac'd Those publick triumphs, she prepares to meet The Princes in, in every splendid street; The various pride of Persia strove t' out-vie Rich English Wool, dipt in the Tyrrian Dye: Each Shop shines bright, and every Merchant shews, How little to domestick toyl he ows, By the displaying beauteous Wardrobes, where The worlds each part may justly claim a share, Though what in all Arts stiff Contention lent Most luster was the Windows Ornament, Fair Constellations of bright Virgins, that Like ful-blown Flowers, first to be wonderd at, Display their beauties, but that past, with all Tempt some kind hand to pluck them ere they fall. Their entrance in this triumph made, whilst now Each busie Artist is endeavouring how To court their Fancies, times smal stock t'improve The grave Epirote, whose designs toward Love; Yet only by Ambition led, had made His first approach so seeming retrograde, By States nice Cautions; and what did presage More ill the inequality of age, That when Converse his Fancy Captive led, His largest hopes on the thin Diet fed Of a Paternal power, assisted by Whose useful aid, with all the industry
Of cager Love, he stil augments that fire, Which must consume, not satisfie desire. But as occasion warn'd him to prevent Unequal flames, he but few dayes had spent In Loves Polemmicks, ere unpractic'd Art, From this calm field, to wars more serious part Is sadly summond, those large Conquests he Had triumph'd in, whilst glorious Victory Waited on's Sword, too spatious to be kept Obedient whilst that glittering terrour slept, In an unactive peace, disclaiming all The harsh Injunctions of proud Victors, fall Off from's obedience, and to justifie Their bold revolt, to th' unsafe refuge flie, Of a defensive power, to crush whose pride With such a force, as an impeteous tyde Assaults the shoars defence, he's forc'd to take A march so sad as Souls, when they forsake The wel-known Mansions of their bodies, to Tread deaths uncertain paths, and there renew Acquaintance with Eternity, perplext To hear those new Combustions, but more vext With Loves proud flames burning, in which wee'l leave Him on his hasty Voyage, and receive A smile from the fair Princess fate, which till Enjoyment stifles strong desire, will fill The tragick Scean no more, but with as sad A progress to her hopes, as ever had Poor Virgin to the Throne of Love, will frame Those harsh Philacters, which in Cupids name, She must obey, unless she will dispense With sacred Vows, and Martyr Innocence.
These storms blown o're, and the Epirote gone, Her Father, that till now had waited on His Entertainment, with a serious eye, Looks o're his Kingdomes wounds, and doth supply Each part, which in this late unnatural War Was grown defective, unto some that are Not Lethargiz'd in Ill, he gently layes Refreshing Mercies, sometimes danger stayes From an approaching Gangren, by applying Corroding threats, but unto those that flying All remedies prescrib'd, had mortifi'd Their Loyalty, stern Justice soon apply'd The Sword of Amputation, which care past, As 'twas his greatest, so becomes his last. Pharonnida he places, where she might, At once enjoy both safety and delight. Her thoughts clear calm, too smooth for th' turbuler And busie City, wants that sweet content The private pleasures of the Country did Afford her Youth, but late attempts forbid All places far remote, which to supply, He unto one directs his choice, that by Its scituation did participate Of all those rural privacies, yet sate Cloathd in that flowry Mantle, in the view Oth' Castle Wals, which as plac'd neer it to Delight, not trouble, in ful bulk presents, Her publick Buildings various Ornaments. This beauteous Fabrick, where th' industrious hand Of Art had Natures Midwife prov'd, did stand Divided from the Continent, by th' wide Armes of a spaious stream, whose wanton pride,
In Cataracts from th' Mountains broke, as glad Of liberty to court the Valley, had Curld his proud Waves, and strecht them to inclose That type of Paradice, whose Crown-top rose From that clear Mirror, as the first light saw, Fair Eden' mids the Springs of Havilah; So fresh as if its verdant Garments had Been in the first Creations beauties clad Ere by mistaking of the fatal Tree, That blooming type of blest Eternity, Subjected was, by mans too easie Crime, Unto the sick Vicissitudes of time. Nor was she in domestick beauty, more Then Prospect rich, the wandring eye past o're A flowry Vale, smooth, as it had been spred By Nature, for the Rivers fragrant Bed. At th' opening of that lovely Angle met The Cities Pride, as costlier Art had set That Master-piece of Wit and Wealth, to shew Unpollisht Natures pleasures were below Her splendid beauties, and unfit to be Lookt on, less in the Springs variety: Though from the Palace where in prospect stood All that nice Art, or plainer Nature wood; If in Contention, shew to magnifie, Their power did stand, yet now appeard to vie Ehat Prospect, which the City lent, unless Diverted from that civil Wilderness: The pathless Woods, and ravenous Beasts within Whose bulk were but the Metaphors for sin; We turn to view the stately Hils, that fence The other side oth' happy Isle, from whence
All that delight or profit could invent For rural pleasures was for prospect sent. As Nature strove for something uncouth in So fair a dress, the struggling streams are seen, With a loud murmure rowling 'mongst the high And rugged clefts, one place presents the eye With barren rudeness, whilst a neighbouring field Sits cloathd in all the bounteous spring could yield, Here lovely Landskips, where thou mightst behold, When first the Infant Morning did unfold The Dayes bright Curtains, in a spatious Green, Which Natures curious Art had spread between Two bushy Thickets, that on either hand, Did like the Fringe of the fair Mantle stand, A timerous herd of grasing Deer, and by Them in a shady Grove, through which the eye Could hardly pierce, a wel-built Lodge, from whence The watchful Keepers careful diligence, Secures their private walks, from hence to look On a deep Valley, where a silver Brook, Doth in a soft and busie murmure slide Betwixt two Hils, whose shadows strove to hide The liquid wealth, they were made fruitful by, From ful discoveries of the distant eye. Here from fair Country Farmes that had been Built 'mongst those Woods, as places happy in Their privacy, the first salutes of light, Fair Country-Virgins meet, cleanly, and white, As were their milky loads; so free from pride, (Though truly fair) that justly they deride Courts nice Contentions, and by freedome prove More blest their Lives, more innocent their Loves.
Ealy as these appears within the field, The painful Husbandman, whose Labour steeld With fruitful hopes, in a deep study how T' improve the Earth, follows his slow-pac'd Plow. Neer unto these a Shepherd having took On a green Bank, plac'd neer a purling Brook, Protection from the Suns warm beams, within A cool fresh shade, truly contented in That Sollitude, is there endeavouring how On's wel-tun'd Pipe, to smooth the furrowd brow Of careful want, seeing not far from hence His flock (the Emblems of his Innocence) Where the more lofty Rock admits not these Domestick pleasures, Nature there did please Her self with wilder pastimes, on those Clifts Whose rugged eads the spatious Mountain lifts To an unfruitful height, amongst a wild Indomitable herd of Goats, the mild And fearful Cony, with her busie feet, Makes Warmth and Safety in one Angle mee. From this wild range, the eye contracted in The Islands narrow bounds would think't had been Ith' world before, but now were come to view An Angel-guarded Paradice till to A Pictures first rude Catagraph, the Art Of an ingenious Pensil doth impart Each Complement of skil, or as the Court To the rude Country, as each Princely sport That brisks the blood of Kings, to those which are The gross-Soul'd Peasants rude delight, so far These Objects differ, here wel-figur'd Nature Had put in form, and to a goodly staure;
On whose large bulk more lasting Arts were spent, Added the dress of choicest Ornament. The stately Mount, whose artificial Crown, The Palace was, to meet the Vale stole down On soft descents, by labour forc'd into A fliding Serpentine, whose winding Clew, An easie, but a slow descent did give Unto a purling stream, whose Spring did live, When from the Hils cool Womb broke forth, within A Grotto, whence before it did begin To take its weeping farewel, into all The various Forms restrictive Art could call, Her Elemental Instruments unto Obedience by it, Courts th' admiring view Of pleas'd Spectators, here exalted by Clear Aqueducts, in showers, it from those high Supporters fals, now turnd into a thin Vapour, in that Heavens painted Bow is seen; Now it supplies the place of Aire, and to A Quire of Birds gives breath, which all seemd flew From thence for fear, when the same Element With such a noise as Seas imprisond rent, Including Rocks do roar, which rude sound done; As noble Conqu'rors who the Battel won, From the loud thunders of impeteous War, To the calm fields of peaceful Mercies are By manly pity led, so Proeus like, Returnd from what did fear or wonder strike; The liquid Nymph resuming her own shape, Within a Marble square, a clear escape, Till from her winding stream the River takes Still fresh supplies, from that fair Fountain makes
Upon those Banks which guarded her descent, Both for her Odour, and her Ornament, Lillies, and fragrant Roses there were set; To heighten whose perfume, the Violet And maiden Primrose in their various dress, Steal through that Moss, whose humble lowliness, Preserve their beauties, whilst Aurora's rose And that ambitious Flower that will disclose The ful-blown beauties of her self to none, Until the Sun mounts his Meridian Throne: Like envied worth, together with the view Of the Beholders, being expos'd unto Each storms rough breath, in that Vicissitude, Finds that their pride their danger doth include, When scortcht with heat, or burhend with a shower, From blooming beauty sinks the fading Flower; Though here defended by a Grove that twin'd Imbraces, and with boughs combin'd, Protects the , which it ne're leaves, Till thence the Vale its flowry wealth receives. Plac'd as the nobler Faculty to this Of vegitation, like an Emphasis, Amongst the flowers of Rhetorick did stand The gorgeous Palace, where Arts curious hand Had to exceed example centerd in One exact Model, what had scatterd been: But as those Fragments which she now selects, The glory of all former Architects, Here did the beauties of those Temples shine, Which Ephesu, or sacred Pallastine, Once boasted in, the Persian might from this Take Paterns for his fam'd Perspolis:
This, which had that fair Carian Widow known, Mausolea's Tomb had ne're a Proverb grown, But been esteemd, after her cost, by her That did erect, a homely Sepulcher. Though to describe this Fabrick, be as far Above my Art, as imitations are Beneath its worth, yet if thy Fancies eye Would at its out-side glance, receive it by This cloudy Medium; on a stately square, Which powerful Art forc'd to a level, where The Mountain highest rose, compast about With a thick Grove, whose leavy Vail let out Its beauties so, 'tis at a distance seen, A silver Mount enameld o're with green; The shining Palace stood, whose outward form Though such, as if, built for perpetual storm▪ Yet in that strength appeard but arm'd to be, Beauties Protector, whose varietie Though all met in an Artful gracefulness, In every Square put on a several dress. The sides whose large Balcones conveyd the Ey To th' Filds wild Prospects, were supported by A thousand Pillars, where in mixture shone The Parian white and red Corinthian stone, Supporting Frames, where in the like Art stood Smooth Ivory mixt with India's swarthy wood: All which with Gold, and purer Azure brought From Persian Artists, in Mosaicks wrought: The curious Eye into Meanders led, Until dierted by a sight that bred More real wonder, the rich Front wherein By antick sculpture, all that ere had been
The various Acts of their preceding Kings, So figur'd was, no weighty Mettal brings, Ought to inhaunce its worth, Art did compose, Each Emblem of such various Gems, all chose Their several colours, under a Saphir Sky, Here cheerful Emeraulds, chast Smaragdi ly; A fresh green field, in which the armed Knights Were all clad in heart-cheering Chrisolites, With Rubies set, which to adorn them twist Embraces with the temperate Amethyst: For parts unarmd, here the fresh Onix stood, And Sardias stone appeard like new-drawn blood. The Proteus like Achates here was made, For Swords fair Hits, but for the glittering Blade, (Since all of rich and pretious Gems was thus) Compos'd, was shewn of flaming Piropus. And least ought here that's excellent should want, The Ladies Eyes were shining Adamant. These glorious Figures large, as if that in Each common Quar these glittering Jems had been By sweaty Labourers dig'd, united by Succesful Art unto the distant Ey; Their mixt beams with such splendid Luster sent, That Comets, with whose fall the Firmament, Seems all on fire, amazes not the sight, With such a full and sudden Flux of Light: As Lines extended from their Center, hence Unto the Islands clear circumference, Four flowry Glades, whose odoriferous dress, Tempted the weary to forgetfulness; Cutting the Mountain, into Quadrants led, Into the Valley, Pleasures humbler Bed;
Where come (if Natures stock can satisfie The Fancy at the Fountains of the Eye) 'Twas here performd in all that did include, What active mirth, or sacred sollitude, Could happy call, Groves never seen by th' Eye Oth' Universe, whose pleasing privacy, Was more retir'd from treacherous light then those, To hide from Heaven, Earths first Offender chose. When Contemplation the kind Mother to, All thoughts that ere in sacred rapture flew Toward Celestial Bowers, had here refin'd The yet imperfect Embrioes of the mind; To recreate contracted Spirits by, The Souls best Med'cine, fresh variety; An easie walk conducts them unto all That active Sports did ere convenient call. All which, like a fair Theater by th' Bank Oth' River verg'd, was guarded by a Rank Of ancient Elms, whose lofty Trunks embrac'd, By clasping Vines, with various colours grac'd Their spreding branches, whose proud brows being crownd With stately Walks, did from that ample round, The wel-pleas'd Eye to every place convay, That in the Islands humble level lay. To guard her Court, a hundred Gentlemen, Such as had glorifi'd their Valour, when Tryed in her Fathers Wars attended, which Commanded by Argalia, did enrich His Merit with such fair reward, that all His better Stars, should they a Synod call; Those fires conven'd nere with more glorious Light, Could cloath his hopes, his Fortunes dim-ey'd Night,
Inflam'd to Noon, and the fai Princess blest By the same power; for though his Fate invest His noble Soul within the obscure Mask Of an unknown descent, his Fame shall ask In time to come a Chronicle, and be The Glory of that royal Family, From whence he sprung: but ere he must attain The top of Fortunes Wheel, that Iron Chain, By whose linkt strength it turns, too oft will grate Him with most hot Afflictions, his wise Fate Digs deep with Miseries, before it layes The ground-fork of his Fame, which then shall raise On the firm Basis of Authentick story, To him eternal Pyramids of Glory. Thou that art skil'd in Loves Polemmicks here, Wish they may rest awhile, and though drawn neer A sadder Fate, if piy sayes to rath, 'Tis to let sorrow sad the Scean, wee'l bath Our Pen awhile in Nectar, though we then Steep it in Gall again; the Spring did, when The Princess first did with her presence grace This house of pleasure, with soft Armes embrace The Earth his lovely Mistress, clad in all The painted Robes, the Mornings Dew let fall Upon her Virgin Bosome; the soft breath Of Zephirus sung calm Anthems at the death Of Palsie-shaken Winter, whose large Grave The Earth, whilst they in fruitful tears did leave, Their pious grief turnd into smiles, they throw Over the Herse a Vail of Flowers, the low And pregnant Valleys sweld with fruit, whilst Heaven Smil'd on each blessing its faire hand had given.
Be-calmd on this paciffick Sea of pleasure, No boisterous Wave appearing, the rich treasure Of Love, being ballast with Content, did fear No threatning storm, so safe a Harbour neer, As th' Object whence it sprung: such royal sports As take their birth from the triumphant Courts Of happy Princes, did contract the day To pitied beauty, time steals away On downy feet, whose loss since it bereaves Them of no more then what new birth receives, From the next teeming day, by none is thought Worth the lamenting; sometimes rockt in the soft Armes of the calmest pleasures, they behold, A sprightly Comedy, the sins unfold Of more corrupted times, then in its high Cothurnal Sceans, a lofty Tragedy Erects their , and doth at once invite To variou Passions, Soow and Delight. Time (Motions aed ) includes Not more in all the , Then their oft changing When the Suns lofty pride The Earths imbroiderd Robes, And palsie hand did those fresh Up in her hoary Plush, each Seas Delights of 'ts own, such a beguil'd Its stock of hours unwasted on, in chast, Though private sports, here happy Lovers Fancie's fresh Youth, whose first attempts did pro Too innocent for th' Sophistry of Love;
There scornful beauty, or the envious eye Of jealous Rivals nere afflicts, all by An equal and a noble height so blest, Pride none had rais'd, nor poverty deprest. The end of the fourth Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The second Book. CANTO THE FIFTH. The ARGUMENT. IX. Whilst serene Joy sate smiling in her Court, As shadows to illustrate Vertue by Phantastick Love becomes the Princess sport, Whose harsher Dictates she ere long must try. X. For now Suspition (Vertues secret Foe) Fir'd with Argalia's just deserved Fame, Makes her great Father think each Minute slow, Till separation had allayd the Flame. LEst that her Court, which seems compos'd of all That's great, or good, th'ore-weaning world should ca Perfections height, a word which whilst on Earth, (Vain as delight) only from Name takes birth,
In this, the largest and most glorious sphear, Ere Greatness mov'd in, some few Stars appear, To Vertue retrograde, th' informing Spirit (Love) by whose motion, on the Pole of Merit, This bright Orb turnd, even 'mongst these Heroes finds A pair of Followers, whose imperfect minds Transgrest his Dictates, and though no offence So full of guilt, as foul Incontinence, Durst here approach, by waies less known unto What Love intends, those various Figures drew, Whose Aspects nere more neer Conjunction move, Then Eyes, the slight Astronomy of Love. That new Platonnick Malady, the way By which imperfect Eunuchs do betray Natures Diseases to contempt, whilst by Such slight repast, they strive to satisfie Loves full desires, which pines, or else must crave More then thin Souls in seperation have; Being lately by some sick Phantasticks brought, But neer the Court, within it long had sought For residence, till entertaind by two Whose meeting Souls no more distinction knew, Then Sex, a difference which whilst here it grows, Toward Heaven, it to Corporeal Organs ows. But since that these so uncouth Actors here, But as Intruders on the Scean appear, Ere in their story we ingulph too far, Let's first behold them in their Character: If ere thy sober Reason did submit, To suppling Mirth (that wanton Child of wit) Beholding A Fantastick, drest in all His vain delights, whats Annalogical
To our Acretius, then conceive thou'st seen, Though if compar'd, those short to him had been, As Transcripts are to Coppies; to compleat A Humorist here, Folly had close a seat, 'Mongst more then vulgar knowledge, and might pass The same account, an Academick Ass Makes of his Fathers four year Charge, when he Frights Villagers with shreds of Sophistry. 'Mongst forrein parts, of which like Coriate, Hee'd run through some, he had acquir'd to prate By priviledge, and as if every Nation Contributed, is in each several fashion; Which (like their Tongues) all so imperfect find, That both disguiz'd his body and his mind; Though self conceit (vain Youths fantastick Crime) Made him steal singly from the Front of time, Ith' Medium, which but seldome proves the seat, For Lust's wild-fire, or Zeals reflected heat, He amarous grows, and doubting to prevail, For all his Wings caught Pegasus by th' Tail; And being before with Cupidi Engines fit'd, From his Posteriors doubly was inspi'd. She that at first this sympathetick flame, Inspir'd him with the Court, knew by the Name Of Philanta, to whom all would impair Their skill, that gave that Epithet of fair Except Acretius, since her beauty fit For praises was, where parallel'd by wit. Yet, now, although times sad discovery tels Her Autumes furrows were no parallels, In Beauties sphear, those youthful forms being grown So obsolete, scarce the Vestigia's shown
A Native pride, and strange phantastick dress, More admiration then ere comeliness Could do, acquires: She formerly had been A great Admirer of Romances, in Whose Garb she now goes drest; a medly piece, Made up of India, Turkie, Persia, Greece, With other Nations, all enforc'd to be Compriz'd within five foots Stenography. Her Wit that had been critical, and rang'd 'Mongst Ladies more then th' Ushers legs, was chang'd, To gratifie, and every word she sayd, An Apothegme unto the Chamber-Maid, From whom her long experienc'd knowledge in Some of the female mysteries of sin, Had gain'd the applause of being skil'd in all That could prevent decaying Beauties fall. Acratius and she, being such a pair, As Nature, when tir'd with more serious care, For Recreation made, instructed by Their meeting Natures secret sympathy; Soon learn to love, but as if now too wise For Youths first dictates, Loves loose Rules comprize In such strick bounds, that each the Object saw Of their desires, like sacred things, some Law, Fear made obey'd, forbids the world to use, Least the Ador'd, enjoyment should abuse Into contempt, nor are their meetings in Those plainer pathes (which their nice Art cals sin) At all performd, that the dull road unto The Bridal Bed; this the fantastick Clew To a delight, which doth in Labyrinths sit, None ere beheld, while they preserv'd their wit.
Like wanton Jove committing secret Rapes On mortal Beauties, they transmute their shapes, At every inter-view, now in adress Resembling an Arcadian Shepherdess; She in the Woods encounters him, whilst he Arm'd like a furious Knight, resolv'd to be Her Ravisher approaches, but being by Her prayers charmd into pity, there doth ly, Fetterd in soft Embraces; now he must Turn Hermit, and be tempted unto Lust, By her a Lady errant; like distrest Lovers, whose hopes by rigid Friends opprest, Pines to despair, they now are wandring in Unhanted Groves, whose pensive shades had been, So oft their shady Vail, that every Tree, In wreaths where Love lay wrapt in mystery, Held their included Names, a subtile way, To the observant Courties to betray Their serious folly, which, from being their own Delight, was now the sport oth' Pages grown; The pleasant Off-springs of whose wanton wit, Disturbs their peace, that though secur'd they fit, In shady Desarts, with as much of fear, As wandring Ladies, when the Gyants neer, They'r still possest; less tertible were all The dreadful Objects Ammadis de Gaule, Or wittier Quixote, from their Enemies Ere met, then was the fear of a surprize, By those which did such strict observance take, They thus their folly the Courts laughter make. Neer to the Islands utmost Verge did lye Retir'd even from Heavens universal Eye,
A deep, dark Vale, whose Night-concealing shade, By a fresh Rivers silver stream was made So sweetly cool, it often did invice, Pharonnida to meet the smooth delight Of calm retirement there, where to impart With Natures Bounty all that liberal Art Though fit for so remote a pleasure, stood, A Grotto where, the Macrocosmes cold blood, Run more disperst in various Labyrinths then It circulates within the Veins of men. Hither th' inventive Lovers, who long sought Some way which Fancy nere her Followers taught, T' express their serious folly in, repair, Oft as the Sun made th' insalubrious Aire, Unfit for publick walks; to entertain Them here, with what exceeded all their vain Delights before, newly erected by Succesful Art, each various Deity, Old Fancy plac'd the Seas Commanders, here They with delight behold, but when drawn neer, They saw ith' midst oth' blew-ey'd Tritons plac'd Neptune and Thes Chariot, yet not grac'd With their unfinisht figures: this they took, For so much favour, as they had forsook Their Thrones to give them place, but what adds yet More to the future mirth, they swiftly fit Themselves with Habits, such as Art had drew Its Fancies in, both of their Robes being blew; Inchac'd with silver streams, their heads with fair Dishevel'd Perrywigs of Sea-green hair; Were both adornd, circling whose Crowns they wore, Wreathd Coronets of Flags, his right hand bore
A Golden Trident here (yet hardly red) As if new pluckt from the Seas froathy Bed, A branch of Corral: but whilst here they sit Proudly adornd, both void of Fear, as Wit; The Gates oth' Grotto, swiftly shutting in A Torrent, such as if they'd seated been At Niles loud Chataracts, by wayes before Unseen break forth, by which the Engine bore From its firm station, flotes aloft, and by A swift withdrawing of those Bayes, which rye Floods from commerce, is wafted forth into A spatious Pool, where the bold Artist drew Th' unfathom'd Seas Epitomy, within A circling Wall, but such as might have been A pattern to Romes big bulk'd pride, when they Shewd Seas loud Battels, for the Lands soft play. Our amorous Humorists, that must now appear, These narrow Seas Commanders, shook with fear, Sit trembling, whilst the shril-voic'd Tritons sound Their crooked Shels, whose watry Notes were drownd By th' lofty laughter of that Troop, they saw Their pleas'd Spectators; for Pharonnida, Being now with all her beauteous Train come to Behold this Pageant, taught them how to view A shame as dreadful as their fear, which yet Was full of horrour, for though safe they sit Ith' floating Chariot, yet the mounting Waves, So boisterous grew, that even great Neptune craves Himself relief, till fighted from all sense, By second dangers, from that Port from whence They sallied forth, two wel-rig'd Ships are now Seen under Sail, whose actions taught them how
Sea-fights are mannag'd, in a method that They being too neer engag'd to tremble at, By fears slow conduct, to confusion led, Fall from their Thrones, and through the Waves had fled From shame to death, had they not rescued been, By swift Relief, a Curtesie that in Its first approach, though welcom'd when they come To stand the shock oth' Courts loud mirth, as dumb, As were the Fishes, they so late forsook, Makes Mercy court them in a dreadful look. But leaving these to pay with future hate, Each Courtiers present mirth, a sadder fate Commands my Pen no longer to attend On smooth Delights, before it gives an end To that Ephemera of pleasure, which Whilst a free Conversation did enrich Their thoughts too fast did ripen in the breast Of both our royal Lovers, whose Fate rests Not longin downy slumbers, ere it starts In vain Phantasmaes, Hope her self departs In a distracted trembling, their bright sphear Of milder Stars, had now continued clear; So long, till what their smiling Influence drew, From the unthankful Earth, contracted to A vail of Clouds, whose coolness whilst some prais'd, Obscur'd those beams, by which they first were rais'd. Hels subtile Embrioes, the Ingratitudes Of curst Amphibia, whose disguise includes Mischiefs Epitome, had often strook In secret at their envied joyes, which took Nere its effects till now, so heavenly free The verteous Princess was, from what could be
Of him to vice, she knew not to mistrust It in another, but thinks all as just As her own even thoughts, wherefore without Oppressing of her Soul with the least doubt Rais'd from suspition, she dares let her see She lov'd Argalia, though it could not be, Yet counted more then what his Merits might Claim as Desert, but this smal beam of light. Through the Prospective of suspition, to Envies malignant Eye conveyd, to do An Act, informs the curst Amphibia, that Makes Love lament, for what she triumph'd at; Since Vertue (Heavens unspotted Character) On the belov'd Argalia did transfer Merits of too sublime a height to be Shadowed with vice, from that Flowers fragrancie She sucks her Venome, and from what had built His Glory, now intends to raise his Guilt; For hough the Prince no Engines need to move, His Passions Frame, but just Desert, his Love, Her close endeavours are to heighten't by Praises, that make Affection jealousie, Whose Venome, having once possest his Soul, It swiftly doth (like fatal Charmes) controul Reasons fair Dictates, and although no fear From such wel-order'd Actions could appear To strengthen it, Argalia's Merits caus'd Some sad and sullen doubts, such as when pauf'd Awhile upon, resolve their Cure must be Their Cause remov'd, though in that Action he From his Breasts royal Mansion, doth exclude The noblest Vertue, generous Gratitude.
My worthless Fortune with, will but prepare Our future happiness, the time we spare From feeding on Ambrosia, will encrease Our wealthy store, when the white Wings of peace Shall bear us back with Victory; there may Through the dark Chaeos of my Fate display Some beam of Honour, though compar'd with thine, (That Element of living flames) it shine Dim as the pale-fac'd Moon, when she lets fall Through a dark Grove her beams: thy Vertues shall Give an Alarum to my sluggish Soul, When ere it drops; thy Memory controul The weakness of my Passions: When we strive Ith' heat of glorious Battel, I'le revive My drooping Spirits, with that harmony Thy Name includes; thy Name, whose memory (Dear as those Reicks a protecting Saint Sends humble Vot'ries) mentions, will acquaint My thoughts with all that's good, then calm again, This Conflict of thy fears, I shall remain Safe in the Hail of Death, if guarded by Thy pious Prayers; Fates Messengers, that fly On wings invisible, will lose the way Aim'd at my breast, if thou vouchsafe to pray To Heaven for my protection.—But if we Nere meet again, yet—oh yet, let me be Sometimes with pity thought on, at which word, His ore-charg'd Eyes no longer could afford A Room to entertain their Tears; both wept, As if they strove to quench that fire which kept Light in the Lamps of Life, whose Fortunes are Ith' House of Death, whilst Mars the regal Star.
Some time in silent sorrow spent, at length The fair Pharonnida recovers strength, Though Sighs each Accent interrupted to Return this Answer, Wilt, oh wilt thou do Our infant Love such injury to leave It ere full grown: When shall my Soul receive A comfortable smile to cherish it, When thou art gone; they'r but dull Joyes that sit Enthron'd in fruitless wishes: yet I could Part with a less expence of sorrow, would Our rigid Fortune only be content With absence, but a greater punishment Conspires against us, danger must attend Each step thou treadst from hence, and shall I spend Those hours in mirth? each of whose minutes lay Wait for thy life; when Fame proclaims the day, Wherein your Battels joyn, how will my fear With doubtful Pulses beat, until I hear Whom Victory adorns? Or shall I rest Here without trembling, when lodg'd in thy breast, My heart's expos'd to every danger that Assails thy Valour, and is wounded at Each stroke that lites on thee, which absent, I Prompted by fear to Myriads multiply. —But these are Fancies Wildfies, we in vain Do spend unheard Orizons, and complain To unrelenting Rocks, this Night peect Scrol, This Bill of our Divorcement doth inrole Our Names in sable Characters, nought will Expunge till death obliterate our Ill. Oh do not (dear Commandress of my Heart) Argalia answers, let our moist eyes part
In such a Cloud as will for ever hide Hopes brightest Beams, those Deities that guide The secret motions of our Fate, will be More merciful, then to twist Destiny In such black Threads, should Death unravel all The feeble Cordage of our Lives, we shall Spight of that Prince of Terrours, in the high And glorious Palace of Eternity, Being met again, renew that Love, which we On Earth were forc'd, before Maturity Had ripen'd it to Leaves; ith' numerous throng Of long departed Souls, that stray among The Mirtles in Elizium, I will find Thy Virgin Ghost; and whilst the Rout inclin'd To sensual pleasures here, refining are, In purging Flames laugh at each envious Star, Whose Aspects, if ill cited at our Brith, With poysonous Influence blasts the Joyes of Earth. Oh wast not (cries the Princess) dear time in These shadows of Conceit, the Hours begin To be 'mongst those inserted, that have try'd The Actions of the World, which must divide Us from our Joy; the Sea through which we sail Works high with woe, nor can our prayers prevail To calm its angry Brow; the glorious Fraight Of my unwelcome Honours hangs a Waight Too ponderous on me for to steer the way, Thy humbler Fortunes do, else ere I'de stay To mourn without thee, I would rob my Eyes Of peaceful slumbers, and in course disguise, (Whilst Love my Sex's weakness did controul) Command my Body to attend my Soul:
My Soul, my dear, which hovering neer thee, not Midnight alarums, that appear begot By truth should startle; 'twixt the clamorous Camp, Lightned with Cannons, and the peaceful Lamps, That undisturb'd here wasts its Oile, I know No difference, but what doth from Passion flow: Whose close Assaults do more afflict us far, Then all the loud impetuous storms of War. We must, we must, replies Argalia, stand This Thunder bolt unmov'd, since his Command, Whose Will confirms our Law; happy had we Great Princess been, if in that low degree, From whence my Infancy was rais'd, I yet Had liv'd a toiling Rural, then when fit For Himens pleasures, uncontrol'd I'de took Some homely Village Girl, whose Friends could look After no Joynture, for to equallize Her Portion but my love; no jealous Eyes Had waited on our Meetings, we had made All our Addresses free; the friendly shade Cast from a spreading Oak, as soon as she Had milkt her Cows, had prov'd our Canopy, Where our unpollisht Courtship had a Love, As chast concluded, as from th' amorous Dove, Pearcht neer us we had learnt it; when arriv'd, Unto Loves Zenith, we had undepriv'd, By disagreeing Parents soon been led, To Church by th' sprucest Swains; our Marriage-bed, Though poor and thin, would have been neatly drest By rural Paranymphs, clad in the best Wool their own Flocks afforded; in a low And humble Shed, on which we did bestow
Nought but our labour to erect, we might Have spent our lustie youth with more delight Then glorious Courts are guilty of, And when Age had decayd our strength, grown up to men Beheld our large course issue. Our dayes ended Unto the Church been solemnly attended By those of our own Rak, and buried been Neer to the Font that we were Christned in. Whilst I in russet Weeds of poverty Had spun these course Threds, shining Majesty Would have exhausted all her stock to Frame, A match for thy Desert; some Prince whose Name The neighbouring Regions trembl'd at, from whom The generous Issue of thy fruitful Womb, Might have deriv'd a stock of Fame to build A future Greatness on, such as should yeild Subject of wonder to the World. About To interrupt him, ere he had drawn out This sad Theam she began to speak, but by Nigts swift approach was hinder'd; now drew nigh The time of his departure: whilst he bleeds, At thought oth' first, a second Smmons speecs His preparations to the City, where That big bulkt body, unto which his care Mst add a Soul, was now drawn up, and stayd, Only to have his wisht Commands obeyd. His powerful Passion, Loves strict Rules respecting, More then bright Honours Dictates, yet neglecting All summons stayed him, till he'd sacrific'd His Vows to her, whose every smile he priz'd, Above those trivial Glories; Ere from hence He dares depart, each with a new expence
Of Tears, payes interest to exacting Fate, For every Minute she had lent of late, Unto poor Love, whose stock since not his own Although no Spend-thrift is a Bankrupt grown. Look how a bright and glorious Morning, which The youthful Brow of April doth enrich, Smiles, till the rude Winds blow the troubl'd Clouds Into her Eyes, then in a black Vail shrouds Her self, and weeps for sorrow; so wept both Our royal Lovers, each would, and yet was loath To bid farwel, till stubborn time inforc'd Them to that Task; first his warm Lips divorc'd From the soft balmy touch of hers; next parts Their hands, those frequent witnesses oth' heart's Indissoluble Contracts: last, and worst, Their eyes,—their weeping eyes, (oh Fate accurst, That layes so hard a task upon my Pen, To write the parting of poor Lovers) when They had even lost their light in tears, were in That shade, that dismal shade, forc'd to begin The progress of their sorrow; he is gone, Sweet, sad Phoronnida left—left alone, To entertain grief in soft sighs, whilst he 'Mongst noise and tumult, oft finds time to be Alone with sorrow, though encompast by A numerous Army, whose brave Souls weld high, With hopes of Honour, least Fames Trump want breath, Hast to supply't by Victory, or death. But ere calmd thoughts to prosecute our story, Salute thy Ears with the deserved Glory Our marshal Lovers purchast here, I must Let my Pen rest awhile, and see the rust
Scour'd from my own Sword, for a fatal day Draws on those gloomy hours, whose short steps may In Britains blushing Chronicle write more Of sanguine Guilt,Newberies second Fight. then a whole Age before: To tell our too neglected Troops that we In a just Cause are slow, we ready see Our rallied Foes, nor wil't our sloathful Crime Expunge, to say, Guilt wakend them betime, From every Quarter, the affrighted Scout Brings swift Alarums in, hovering about The clouded tops of the adjacent Hils, Like ominous Vapours lye their Troops, noise fils Our yet unrallied Army, and we now Grown legible, in the contracted Brow, Discern whose heart looks pale with fear: If in This rising storm of blood, which doth begin To drop already, I'me not washt into The Grave, my next safe Quarter shall renew Acquaintance with Pharonnida, till then, I leave the Muses to converse with men. The end of the second Book.
PHARONNIDA. The third Book. A Tragi-comicall POEM. CANTO THE FIRST. The ARGUMENT. I. Beneath the powerfull Tyranny of Love, Whilst the fair Princess weeps out every Star, In Pleasures Sphear, those dark Clouds to remov, All royall Pass-times in it practic'd are. II. Amongst whose Tryumphs, that her Train might lend Her their Attendants in the shades of Grief; Passion brings some so neer a fatall end, That timely pity scarce affords relief. SOme Months now spent, since in the clouded Court Of sad Pharonnida, each Princely sport Was with Argalia's absence maskt within Sables of Discontent, Robes that had been
Of late her chiefest Dress; no cheerful smile Ere cleerd her brow, those walks which were ere while; The Schools where they disputed Love, were now Only made use of, when her grief sought how To hide its treacherous tear,; the unfil'd Bed Oth' Widow, whose conjugal joy is fled, Ith' hot and vigorous youth of Fancy, to Eternal absence, sooner may renew, (Though she for tears, repeated praises seeks) The blooming spring of Beauty on her Cheeks. When bright plum'd Day on the expanded wings Of Aire approaches, Lights fair Herald brings No overtures of peace to her; each prayer In pious zeal she makes, a pale despair In their Celestial Journey clogs; but long Her feeble Sex could not endure these strong Assaults of Passion, ere the red and white Vanquisht from Beauties Throne, had took their flight, And nought but melancholy palness lest T' attend the light of her dim eyes, bereft Of all their brightness; pining Agues in The earthquake of each Joynt, leaving within The Veins, more blood then dwelt in hers, which bea The hearts slow motions with a hectick heat. Long Passions Tyrant reigns not, ere this change Of Mirth and Beauty, letting sorrow range Beyond the circle of Discretion, in Her Father that suspition which had been Kindl'd before renewing, he removes His Court to hers, but the kind visit proves A Paroxisme unto that strong Disease, Which combates in her blood, no mirth could please
Her troubl'd Soul, since bar'd society, With all its better Angels, gone to be Attendant on Argalia; she beholds Those studied pleasures, which the Prince unfolds His love and greatness in, with no delight More smooth then that a sullen Anchorite, Which a harsh vow hath there enforc'd to dwell, Sees the cold wants of his unhaunted Cell. Amongst these sports, whose time betraying view Ravisht each pleas'd Spectator, the fair Clew, Contracts some sable knots, of which my Pen Is only one bound to unravel; when War had unclasp'd that dreadful Book of hers, Where honour'd Names in sanguine Characters, Brave valour had transcrib'd, fair vertue fixt Euriolus in Honours Orb, and mixt Him with the Courts bright Stars; but he who had Whilst unregarded poverty had clad His vertues in obscurity, learnt how To sail in Fortunes boisterous storms, is now By her false smiles be-calm'd and sunk, before Desert (bound thither) toucht Loves treacherous shore. Ith' playful freedome of their youth, when she Was only a fair Shepherdess, and he An humble Swain, he truly did adore The fair Florenza, but aspir'd no more, Since Poverty clog'd Loves ambitious wing, Then by his private Muse alone to sing Her praise with, such a flame of wit, that they Which have compar'd, say envied Laua may Look pae with spleen, to hear those Lies exprest, Though in her great Platonicks Raptures drest.
But now his Worth by Vertue rais'd, did dwel High as his Hopes, and that a Parallel To hers appearing, eithers Merits had A Climax to preferment, and thus clad Vertue in Honours Robes, which equal Fate, Gave his Affection Language to relate, What their Disparity kept dumb, nor did Those Motions find acceptance, such as hid Them for presumption, rather 'twas a Frost Of Virgin Ice, then fire of pride that crost His Masculine Desires, her Eyes unfold So much of Passion, as by them she told Who had most interest in her Heart, which she From all brave Rivals his resolves shall be. 'Mongst those, Mazara, one, whose noble blood Enrich'd the Gems of Vertue, though they stood In Honours Altitude, was chief, nor could A nobler Choice, were her Affections rul'd By Worth, commend her Judgment, his fresh youth Being Crownd with Vertues which might raise a truth, Above Hyperboles, his Nature mild, As was the Gaulless Dove, yet not the wild And furious Lion, when provok'd could have More daring Valour, an untimely Grave, Whilst it ith' Embrio was, to every Vice, But unto Vertue a fair Paradice; Whose weedless Banks no pining Winter knew, Till Death the Iufluence of warm Life withdrew. That sympathy of meeting Vertues, which Did both their Souls with equal worth enrich, 'Twixt him, and brave Euriolus had ty'd A League not to be broke, could Love divide
His Blessings amongst Friends; But that of all Our Passions brooks no Rival, fear may call, Friends to partake of Palsies, Anger strives To fire each neighbouring Bosome, Envie thrives By being transplanted; but a Lovers pure Flames, though converted to a Calenture, Unwillingly with the least flame will part, Although to thaw anothers frozen heart. Few 'mongst th' observant Wits oth' Court yet knew (Though it with twisted Eye-beams strengthend grew, At every interview, and often dropt Some Tears to water it) whose Love 'twas stopt, Mazara's Sute, Euriolus to her Whose melting pity only could confer A Cure, unlocks the Secrets, whilst the other More confident to win, nere strives to smoother A Passion so legitimate, but by All actual Complements, declares how high He priz'd her Vertues, but this Worthies Fate, Fixt him in Loves intemperate Zone, too late he pining Fruit was sown, the Spring so far Being spent, its dayes were grown Canicular; Schortching all hopes, but what made able were By fruitful Tears Loves April Showers, to bear Neglects untimely Frosts, which oft have lost In bloomy Springs, the unhappy Lovers cost. When this accomplisht Youth, whose Tongue and Pen With Negatives more firm and frequent, then Curst Usurers give impoverisht Clients, oft Had been repuls'd, truth for discovery brought This Accident, within the royal Court Of bright Pharonnida, a full Resort
Of valiant Knights were met, conven'd to try, Whose Valour Fortune meant to glorifie; Of which selected number there was one, Who though a stranger, Vertue soon made known To all, 'cause fear'd of most, his valour had, Before the first triumphant day unclad The silver-vested Hemisphear, been oft Cloathd in the Ornaments of Honour, brought On Fames fair wings from the opposing part Uncresting them to crown his high desert. But now, when this new Constellation neer Its Zenith drew, in Honours Hemisphear, Cald thither by deciding Lots, the brave Euriolus appears, whom Victory gave, In the first shock success, and plac'd his Name In the Meridian Altitude of Fame; Where, though the valiant stranger prove no Foe, So fortunately valiant do ore-throw the structure of his Fate, yet his close Stars Now sinks a Mine, to which those open Wars But easie dangers were; Mazara in His Crest a Scarff, that formerly had been Known for Florenza's, seeing jealous Love Converted into Rage, his Passions move Above the sphear of Reason, and what late Was but a gentle blaze, by alterd Fate, Fires to a Comet, whose malignant beams Foretold sad Ills, attending Loves extreams. Loth to betray his Passions in so great A breach of Friendship, to a close Retreat, Mazara summons forward Rage; yet in The strangers Name, whose Fortune might have been
The Parent of a private Qarrel, sends To call Euriolus, who now attends Nought but triumphant mirth, unguaded by Applauding Friends, in secret Fight to try, What power did him from threatning danger guard, When publick Fame was Victories Reward. This fatal Scroll receiv'd, by him that thought It real truth, since Passion might have sought In him the same delay, a swift consent Returns his Answer, but the Message went So far from its directed Road, that ere It reacht Mazara's, loose Neglect did bear It to Carina's Ear, a Lady that In silent tears her heart had offerd at His Vertues Shrine, yet with such secret zeal, Her Eyes forbid their Cupids to reveal, That Language of her heart, she knew that in Florenza's Sea of Merits, hers had been Shipwrackt and lost, yet with a Soul as far From envying her, as hating him, this War Of factious Passions she maintains, and since Reason now wanted Language to convince Those head-strong Rebels, she resolves to be Though ruin'd, ruld by their Democracy. The Information her officious Maide, Had from Mazara's careless Page betrayd; Assures Carina the preceding Night, Such Horse and Armour as the stranger Knight, Euriolus had conquer'd in, had been By his most cautious diligence within, A (not far distant Wood) in whose black shade He meant his Fury should his Foe invade:
Lodg'd by his Master, which discoverd truth, Frighting her tears from the swift chase of Youth, And Beauty into froward Age, to meet Sorrow in private shades, withdraws the sweet But sad Carina, who resolves to spend Her sighs unnoted by her dearest Friend. This in Florenza, who fore-saw that nought, But Passions more then common, could have wrought So swift a change, works high, who that she might Dis-plume these Ravens, ere the Babes of Light, Smile in their weeping Mothers Face, prepares To see Carina, who with wakeful cares, Her sad Companions by her friend surpriz'd, No longer in their Ebbon Vail disguiz'd Her thoughts pure candor; but with looks that did Seem to implore Assistance, whilst they chid Her own indulgent Nature, shews her how Preposterous Love made her to Passions bow, Whose fruit, since none of her first Planters came From forward man, could be but female shame. This (with its fatal Authour) known to free Her Friend from shame, her self from cruelty, Unto Mazara whose firm Love attends Her least Commands, incenst Florenza sends, Whose zeal transported Soul no sooner hears That welcome sound, but though presaging fears, Prompt him to stay, least haughty honour fall Ruin'd by Fame, be lets her Standards fall Before commanding Love, and goes to wait On's honourd Mistress; but this sly deceit Of hope, no Cordial proves, unto the sad Carina's grief, the long experience had
Of his Affection to Florenza tells Her doubtful Soul, those even Parallels Could not by all her Friends perswasions be Wrested into the least obliquity; Which sad mistrust did Love precipitate, On pathes whose danger frights protecting Fate. Assur'd the Combates hour drew on, and that Mazara's love-sick Soul was offering at Florenza's Shrine, and by that willing stay, Might be inforc'd some Minutes to delay The time, in which his readier Opposite, Expected him, she being resolv'd to write Affection in her blood, with Loves wild hast, Makes toward the Lists, there finds his Armour plac'd Within the dark shade of an ancient Wood, In whose black breast that place of horrour stood, Where they appoint to meet, like those of Fate, Obscure and dark by Beasts and Birds, that hate The Light alone frequented; but love had Dis-plum'd fears Haggars, being resolv'd she clad Beauties fair Pearl, where smooth delights did dwell, Ith' rough-cast Mould of that Ciclopian shell. But that no Armes, nor bounding Steeds affright, Where Loves fair hand hath Valours pasport wright, Here we should pause, and pity her that now Fancy beholds, whilst she is learning how, To manage stubborn steel, within her sleek And pollisht hand, through devious pathes to seek For doubtful dangers, such whose horrid shape, On mans best judgment, might commit a Rape. Her swift Conductor Love, ere this had brought Her to the place, where Passion had not sought
Long for the Object of her hate, ere she Her valiant Brother, that was come to be His Fames Protector sees, but so disguiz'd In's Armes, that both, with envy unadviz'd, By knowledge an unthought of guilt prepare, In blood to meet; their foaming Horses were Now freed from the commanding Rain, and in Their full Carier; but Love in vain to win The Field from Valour strives, her eager hast But argues such an envy as did wast It self in weak Attempts, which to the length Of power extended, fals beneath the strength Of her Victorious Foe, whose Fortune had In Robes of Joy, what he must weep for clad. Conquer'd Carina now dismounted lay, Struggling for life, whose Fortress to betray Toward Natures Tyrant Death, her blood transports False Spirits through their purple Salliports. Her Brother with an Anger that was grown Into disdain, his Fury should be shewn, On such resistless Subjects, ere he knows How much of grief his Soul to sorrow owes, For this unhappy Act, froms finisht course Was now returning, not by strength to force The harsh Commands of Tyrant Victors, but By calm advice, a bloodless end to put, To that ill-manag'd Quarrel: but before He there arrives, to make his sorrows more, When truth unvails their dark design, a Knight With hast as speedy as the secret flight O wrath, when wing'd from angry Heaven, he saw Bolted into the Lists, who soon did draw
Too neer in sober Language to dispute Their fatal Quarrel, both, with Rage grown mute Disdaining conference, found no place for words, Amidst the mortal Language of their Swords; Which, the first shock past o're, and Lances broke, In hast took place, and at each furious stroke, Unbay'd the Fountains of their blood, to stain With purple guilt the Flower-enamel'd Plain. Whilst each did thus with silent Rage imploy, An Art directed Fury to destroy The others strength, the bordering shadows weep, In trickling Dews, and with sad murmures keep Time with the hollow, and ill boding Note, Sent from a fatal Ravens stretcht-out Throat; Which from an old Oaks witherd top did sing A baleful Dirg; but these sad Omens bring No terror to their busie thoughts, which were Too much imployd in Action, to take care For any danger more remote, then what With the next stroke might fall; perceiving that Their Horses faint, they both dismount, and do On equal terms the Fight on foot renew, Till a Cessation from the want of breath, Not Valour was enorc'd: the Vail which death Contracted from those steams, his wreaking blood Breathd forth its Spirits in already stood, Over Mazara's Eyes, which clouded ses Not that approach of Night; his trembling Knees Sagger beneath their fainting Load, which in To th' Grave had dropt, had not their fury bin When its last heat was with Lifes flame neer spent From further Rage, restraind by accident.
Some of the lost Carina's frighted Friends, Fearing those Ills which desperate Love attends, Spending that Morning in the fruitless Quest, Of her had been, and now (their hopes distrest With vain inquiries) to communicate, Their Grief returning were, which secret Fate, To interpose, through dark Meanders brought, Neglect to find what care in vain had sought. Whilst yet no more then brave humanity, Prompts them to part a Quarrel that might be Defil'd with blood, which if not shead in Wars, With Murther stains, what it doth guild with Scars: They toward them hast, even in that critical And dangerous Minute, when Mazara's fall, With Vict'ries Laurels to adorn his Crest, His valiant Friend had rob'd of future rest, Had not this blest relief of Innocence, The one from death, the other from expence Of tears restraind, before Revenge had found So much of Guilt as might his Conscience wound. His high wrought Rage stopt by too many hands, To vent its heat, Euriolus now stands, Shook with the Feaver of his anger, till Those Friends which saw Mazara grown so ill With wounds, to gasp for breath, by giving way For aire, they to the Victors view betray His best of Friends, at which afflicting sight, Cursing the cause of that unhappy fight; His Sword as guilty thrown aside, he hasts To his Relief, in which kind act none wasts Their friendly help, Life, as but stoln from pain, Behind the Vail of death appears again
On Natures Frontiers, whose returning flame, Though scarce of strength to warm, lookt red with shame, When he so many wel-known Friends beheld, Sad Witnesses, how much his passion sweld Above the Banks, where Reason should have stayd, When to that meeting it his Friend betrayd. Their Vails of steel remov'd, each now beholds, What shame and wonder in firm Contracts folds. Amaz'd stands brave Euriolus to see, None but his Friend, his honourd Friend should be The Parent of that Quarel, shame confounds Mazara more, and from internal wounds (Though like the red Seas Springs his other bled) Perhaps less danger, but more torment bred. Both now by his unforc'd confession knew Whose equal'd honourd Beauty 'twas that drew Them to this fatal Combate, whose event Him neer the Grave on Loves vain Errant sent. Friendship renewd in strickt Embraces, they Are now arriv'd, where weak Carina lay, So faint with Loves Phlebotomy, that she, Maskt in forgetful slumbers could not see Approaching shame, which when discoverd sticks Lifes fair Carnations on her death-like Cheeks. Hasting to see, what over-forward Rage, That unknown strangers weakness did engage, In that unhappy Quarrel they beheld, At the first glance an Object that expeld, Into the shades of Sorrows Wilderness, All temperate thoughts, his Sisters sad distress Wrought by his Arme, whose strength betrayd her neer The Grave, did to Euriolus appear,
Dreadful, as if some treacherous friend had shown Those flames in which his scorcht Companions grone. Nor did Mazara, though but prompted by Pity (that tender Child of sympathy) With less relenting sorrow live to see, Loves bloody Trophies, though unknown to be By his victorious Beauty reard; to save From the cold grasp of an unimely Grave, So ripe a Virgin, whilst her Brother stands Unnerv'd with grief, amongst the helpful hands Of other Friends are his imployd, till by Their useful aide; fled Life returns to try, Once more the Actions of the world, before It shot the Gulf of Death; but on the shore Of active Nature, was no sooner set, But that (together with the Light) she met Her far more welcome Lover, whom whilst she Beholds with trembling, Heaven resolv'd to free A suffering Captive, turns his pity to So much of Passion, as ere long Love grew On the same Stem, whose Flowers to propagate; She in these words uncurtains mystick Fate. For bear your aide brave Sir, and let me dy, Ere live the Author of a Podigy, That future times shall curse: yet pardon me, Dear Brother, Heaven will nere impute to thee, The guilt of blood, twas my unhappy Love Which rais'd this Storm, which if my prayers may prove In death successful, let me crave of you, Dear Sir, to whom I long have born a true But indiscreet affection, that from hence For poor Carina's sake, for this expence
Of tears and blood, you would preserve those dear Respects of Friendship, that did once appear Confirmd betwixt you, and, although my Fate, Unto the worst of Ills precipitate My Fame and Life, oh let my name not be Offensive to your Ear, this, this for me, Is all you shall perform; which spoke, she'd let Her hovering Soul forth, to have paid the Debt Of Nature to the Grave, had not shee bin By some assisting Friends, whilst dropping in, Scayd at the last step, and brought back to meet The Bridal Pair, no single winding Sheet. This doubtful Combate ended, they are to The Court conveyd, where Fame upon this new Text Commenting, in various Characters Transcribes her sence; some this bold Act of hers Term un-becoming Passion, others brave Heroick love; but what most comfort gave, To cur'd Carina, was, that this lost blood, Had prov'd Loves Balm, and in a purple flood, Washt from her heart Grief's sable stains, for now Merit had taught her dear Mazara how, To prize her verteous Love, and for its sake Its Cabinet her hearts best Temple make. Thus Passions troubl'd Sea had settl'd in A smooth and gentle calm, had there not been Unhappily, to blast their sweet content, Not long before an Act for th' banishment, Of all such Courtiers made, as should withont A Licence from the Councel, fight about What ever private Quarrel, but not this Mazara, or his new choice frights; their bliss
Stood on more firm foundations then the Courts Uncertain Favours were, whose glorious sports Although he left, it was not to retire To sullen cares, what Honour could require, A state which cal'd him her unquestiond Lord, Without depending favours did afford. But whilst we leave this noble Lover by This Mandate freed, from what before did tye Unto a troublesome Attendance; we From brave Euriolus are forc'd to be With sorrow parted, since the generall love, His Vertue had obtaind, wants strength to move The ponderous doom; ere his impoverisht heart, Grown poor in streams, could from Lifes springs impart Warm blood enough for his pale Cheeks to drink A Health to Beauty, he's enforc'd to think Of that sad theam of parting, on whose sense, His griev'd Soul dictates sighs, yet could dispense Even with its harshest rigour, were there but Any acception in it, that might put Out parting with Florenza, that though he Were shrunk into his former poverty, (Calling the rugged frowns of Fate) would bear A Brow unclouded with Ambitions care. But he must go, not all the Rhetorick Of tempting Love could plead against the quick Approach of time, whose speedy motion now, Only some slippery Minutes did allow Their parting tears, in whose exalted flood, Had Reason not with future hopes withstood The rising stream, Loves Summer Fruits had been (Ore-whelmd with grief) for ever buried in
A delluge of Despair; but that, whilst she, With such sad looks, as wintring Scithians see The Sun hasts toward the Artick Pole, beholds His slow departure, glimmering hope unfolds Twylight, which now foretels their frozen fear, Day may return to Loves cold Hemisphear. The end of the first Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The third Book. CANTO THE SECOND. The ARGUMENT. III. The Princess by unluckie Accident, Having Loves secret Embassies betrayd, To her great Father, by that Action spent That stock of hope, which promis'd future Ayd. IV. His rage being to such rash extreams inflam'd, That he whose Mandates none durst disobey, As if his power were of such Acts asham'd, Shrinks from it self, and poorly doth betray. IF angry Aid, the Enemy to Love, Tels thy grave pride, thy Judgment is above, What with contempt (although it injure truth) Thy spleen miscals the vanity of youth.
If harsh imployment; gross society, That feast of Brutes, make thee an Enemy To love, the Souls Commercive Language, then Remove thy Eye, whilst my unenvied Pen, That long to Passion hath a Servant been Confines the fair Pharonnida's within, These paper limits; frozen still she lies Beneath opposing Passions, her bright Eyes; Those Stars whose best of influence scarce had power To thaw what grief congeald into a shower Of heart dis-burthening tears, their influence spend In sorrows polar Circles, and could lend No light to beauties World; ith' vigorous reign Of this pale Tyrant, whilst she did remain Unlighten'd with a beam of comfort, in A Bower being sate, that formerly had been Her seat, when she heard the unhappy news Of parting with Argalia; whilst she views She blames the guiltless shadows, who to ask Pardon in trembling murmures did unmask Their naked Limbs, and scatterd at her Feet The fragrant Vail, in's death-bed sate the sweet But pining Rose, each Grass its heavy head, Laden with tears did hang, whilst her Eyes shead A pattern to instruct them: hence, whilst she Looks thorough on a way conceiv'd to be The same her Lod marcht with his Army, when He left Girenza, with a hast more then A common Traveler, she sees one post Towards her Court, whose Visage had not lost Its room within her Memory, he's known Argalia's Page, and now each minute grown,
A burthen to her thoughts, that did deer A neerer interview, the Messenger Arrives, and to her eager view presents His Masters Letters, whose inclos'd Contents, Are now the Object, her expecting Soul Courts with desire, nor doth she long controle Their forward hast; A Diamond being by The Messenger returnd, whose worth might vie Price with an Indian Fleet, when it sails slow With's glittering burthen; though each word ore-flow With joy, whilst her inquisitive discourse, Was on this pleasing theam, time did enforce The Pages swift departure, who with all Affected Epithites, that Love can call To gild Invention when it would expresse, Things more sublime then mortal happinesse, Is gone to carry his expecting Lord, What pleasure could, when ratified afford. Whilst this sweet joy was only cloathd in fresh Blossomes of hope like Souls, ere mixt with flesh She only by desire subsisted, but Now to her Chamber come, and having shut The treacherous door, from the conjugal seal, The white Lipt paper freed, doth soon reveal Loves welcome Embassies; she reads, and by Each Line transported to an Extasie, In Fancies wild Meanders lost the way, She rashly enterd, faint desire would stay At every word in amorous sighs to breath A Love-sick groan, but she is yet beneath The Mount of joy, and must not rest untill Her swift-pac'd eye had climb the flowry Hill,
Which now past lightly o're, with an intent Of a review to its best Ornament, His Name, she comes, which whilst bathd in the Balm Of fragrant kisses, from joyes gentle calm She thus is startl'd, a redoubled groan, That sign of neighbouring sorrow, though unknown From whence affrights her Soul; but she too soon, Too sadly knows the Cause; the height of Noon, Rag'd in reflected heat, when walking in Those outer Rooms, her Father long had been In expectation of her sight; but not Finding her there, a golden slumber got The start of's Meditations, to comply VVith whose calm councel, he did softly ly Down on a stately Couch, whose glittering pride, A Curtain from the publick view did hide; VVhere having pluckt from off the wing of time, Some of her softest Down, the Dews that clime, In sleep to stop each Ventrickle, begin To steal a soft Retreat, hovering within His stretcht-out Limbs, sleeps vapours lye, his hands Rub from his Eyes those leaden boults that stand Over their heavy Leads, which scarce was done, VVhen first surpriz'd Pharonnida begun To read her Letter, and by that sad chance, Betray her Love; Passion strove to advance Her Father from his Lodging, when he first Heard the discovery, but though anger thirst For swift Revenge, yet policy perswades Him to hear further, ere his sight invades Her troop of Pleasures, whose thin Squadrons broke, By what sh'd heard, before she could revoke
Her vanquisht spirits, that were fled to seek Protection in her heart, robbing her Cheek Of all the blood to waft in; whilst she stands A burthen to her trembling Legs, her hands Wringing each others Ivory Joynts; her bright Eyes scattering their distracted beams, the flight Oth' Curtain from her Fathers angry touch, Discovers whence that groan which caus'd so much, Her wonder came; Grief, and amazement strives Awhile with Love, which soon victorious drives, Those pale Guests from her Cheeks, unto whose aide, Her noble heart (secure from being betrayd By its own strength) did send a quick supply Of its warm blood, her Conscience knows not why To fear, 'cause knows no guilt, nor could have been By Love so verteous, ere drawn neer a sin. But as the Evening blushes for the rude Winds oth' ensuing day, so fortitude, Upon the lovely Roses that did grow, Within her Face a deeper Dye bestow, Then fear could ere have done, and did presage Th' ensuing storms exagitated rage. Silent with Passion, which his Eyes inflam'd The Prince a while beholds her, ere he blam'd The frailty of Affection, but at length Through the thick throng of thoughts, armd with a strength Which crusht the soft smiles of paternal Love, He thus begins; And must, oh must that prove My greatest curse on which my hopes ordaind To raise my happiness? have I refraind The pleasures of a Nuptial Bed, to joy Alone in thee, not trembled to destroy
My Name, so that advancing thine I might Live to behold my Scepter take its flight, To a more spatious Empire, have I spent My youth, till grown in debt to Age she'th seen Diseases to arrest me, that impaire My strength and hopes ere to enjoy an Heir, Which might preserve my Name, that only now Must in our dusty Annals live, whilst thou Transfer'st the glory of our house, on one Which, had not I warmd into life, had gone A Wretch, forgotten of the World, to th' earth, From whence he sprung. But tear this monstrous birth Of Fancy from thy Soul, quick as thou'dst fly Descending wrath, if visible, or I Shall blast thee with my anger, till thy Name Rot in my Memory, not as the same, That once thou wert behold thee, but as some Dire Prodigy, which to foreshew should come All ills, which through the progress of my life Did chance, were sent; I lost a Queen, and Wife, Thy verteous Mother, who for her goodnesse might Have here supply'd, before she took her flight To Heaven, my better Angels place, have since Stood storms of strong Affliction, still a Prince Over my Passions until now; but this Hath prov'd me Coward: Oh thou dost amisse To grieve me thus fond Girl. With that he shook His reverend Head, beholds her with a look, Compos'd of Grief and Anger, which she sees, With melting sorrow, but resolv'd Love frees Her from more yeilding pity; to begin The Prologue to obedience, which within
Her breast still dwelt (though swayd by Love) she fals Prostrate at's feet, to his remembrance cals Her dying Mothers Will, by whose pale dust, She now conjures him not to be unjust Unto that promise, with which her pure Soul Fled satisfi'd from Earth as to controule Her freedome of Affection, rather she Desires her Interest in his Crown might be Deni'd her, then the choice of one to sway It in her right, she urges how it may Be by his Vertue far more glorifi'd, Whom she had chose, then if by Marriage ti'd To any neighbouring Prince, who only there Would rule by Proxi, whilst his greater care Secur'd his own Inheritance; she then Cals to remembrance wh reliv'd him, when Distest within Alcithiu's Walls, the Love His Subjects bore Argalia, which might prove Her choice their happiness, with all how great A likelyhood i was, but the retreat O Royalty, to a more safe disguise, Had shewd him to their States deluded Eyes, So mean a thing: Loves bundless Rhetorick, About to dictate moe, he with a quick And fuiou hast forsakes the Room, his Rage Thus boyling o're; And mst my wretched Age Be thus by thee tormented: but take heed Correct thy Passions, or their Cause must bleed, Until he quench the flame; at which harsh word He leaves the room, nor could her strength afford Her power to rise, which whilst she strives to do, Her Memory adding more Weights unto
The burthen of her thoughts, her oul opprest, Sinks in a pale Swoon, catching at te rest It mst not yet enjoy, swift help lends light, Though faint and glimering, to behold what Night Of grief ore-shadow'd her: You that have been Upon the Wrack of Passion, tortur'd in The Engines of forbidden Love, that have Shed fruitless ears, spent hopeless Sighs, to crave A rigid Parents fair Aspect, conceive What wild destruction seiz'd her; I must leave Her Passions Volume only to be read, Wihin the breasts of such whose hearts have bled, At the like dangerous wounds; whilst she sits here Amaz'd with grief, know that no smiles appear, To smooth her Fathers angry bow, yet to None he unfolds his thoughts, but bent to do What ere his Rage should dictate, to appease This high-wrought storm, which turnd into disease Each motion of the Brain, he only takes Scorn and Revenge, to whose ill counsel shakes The quet of the Soul, to be his Guides Through those Night-peect Walks, whose shadow The languisht beams of Love, awhile their strong Ingredients boyl in's blood, before they throng The scatterd thoughts into a quintessence Of poysonous Resolutions, first from thence There sprung this black Disaster to attend Argalia's Fortune, he doth forthwith send A secret Messenger to th' Warlike Prince Of Siracuse, to let him know that since He sent those Forces to assist him in His War, their General, that till late had bin
The darling of his Love, by Arguments Too strong was prov'd a Traytor, whose intents Aymd at his Crown and Life; to aggravate His spleen the more, he writes him word their Fate, On the same ominous Pinions flew, if that He prov'd succesful, having warmd him at This flame of Passion, he concludes with; (Sir) You guesse my meaning, I would have no stir, About dispatching of him, for he's grown Strong in affection, and may call his own The hearts of half my Kingdome; let this give Your Justice power; he's too much lov'd to live. The startl'd Siracusian having read These bloody Lines, which had not only bred A new, but nourisht growing envy in His mighty Soul, a stranger to all sin, So full of guilt, as to dissemble, till The new made Generals just deserts did fill Fames still augmented Volume, and was grown More legible, then what he cal'd his own. What in a rivall Prince had been a high And noble Emulation, kindled by A smaller Star blasts Vertue, he beholds His lightning Valour, which cach hour unfolds, Examples for Posterity, destroy What (though he trembl'd at) creates no joy Within his sullen Soul, a secret hate, By Envy fed, strives to unhinge his Fate, From off their lofty Pyramids, and throw What Merit rais'd, unto a place more low Then their first step to Glory, yet, whilst nought But Honour was engag'd, disdain nere sought
For life-excluding Corasives; but Love Bearing a part, two Suns might sooner move In the same sphear, then that hot Guest indure A rival Flame, Desert could not secure Worth thus besieg'd, yet this accurst intent, Dares not unvail it self, the Army sent, By him from fair Gerenza, ere the Sun Perform'd his Summers progress, had begun To Garrison their weary Fort within, Such Towns as their own Valour first did win, From the retir'd Aeolians, ere this task Was fully ended, curtaind in the Mask Of Merits lawfull claim reward there came A large Commission, which Zoranza's Name Had made authentick, that the Government Of Ardenna a Town, whose strength had spent The baffl'd Foe, whose Fields of blood should be Conferd on him, by the Vicinity Of th' place, freed from a tedious Journey, in The City he arrives, and what had bin Sent from his Prince, presents those Mandates that Informd the Governour, who frighted at The strange Commands, lets a pale guilt ore-take His swift Resolves, till glorious hopes did shake Those Mourning Robes of Conscience off, and in The purple Garments of a thiving sin, Shadows his trembling Soul, least she appear, Shook with a cold fit of religious fear. The discomposure of his look, which did Appear the birth of Discontent, forbid Suspition of a blacker sin; that night, As being the last of's charge, he did invite
Argalia to remain his Guest: the next Promising to  his, yet seeming vext, To leave the place, though only to conceal His dark dsign that did it self reveal To none but some selected Soldiers; by Whose help he meant to murther him. To vie I benefits with th' Dayes, Night had bestowd Refreshing slumbers upon all haowd It to the lst dayes Labour, when without Fear of appoaching danger, hem'd about With guards of honest Valour, all his Train Save such as meer necessity deain, Lodg'd in the City, fearless Argalia in T  lies, where having tempted bin By Midnight Revels, full crownd Cups, to be Betrayd from Reason to Ebriety: But nought prevaling, e at length is led, Like an in ended Sacrifice, to th' Bed, Ordaind to be his last, untill the Earth Within her Womb afford him one; the birth Oth' Morn grew neer her slow approach, ere all Ths Engines, by whose strength they meant his fall Could be prepar'd; the Governour that held The Helm of this black mischief, had expel'd The poysonous Guilt of staining his own Sword With blood, providing Villains that abhord No  Contagin, though Revenge did wait On every guilty stp: that Evenings Bait Their liqid Mirth had layd, although it took No use of Reason from his Soul, had shook Its labouring Faculies into a far More sudden slumber, which compos'd the War
Of wandring Fancy in a Harmony Of the Concordant Humours, untill by The sudden noise of those ordaind to be His Murtherers, he wakes; amaz'd to see His Chamber so possest, he catches hold On one of hem, but finds his strength controld, By the assistance of the ther, in The Embrio of this treachery, ere their sin Was past to execution, he conjutes Them to forbear so black a Deed, assures Them of Rewards, greater then hope could call A debt from him that basely sought his fal. But deadly silence had bar'd up the Gates Of every Voyce, those curst Assassinates Prepard for action were, but Heaven prevents That aged sin of murthering Innocents, With Miracles of Mercy. There was found Not long before an ancient Story crownd, With a Prophetick Honour, that containd This sacred truth; (When Ardenna is staind With Treachery in Fiendships Vail disguiz'd, Her sable Tower shall be by Foes surpiz'd.) This known, but misconceiv'd, to czen Fate, They did unwounded bear without the Gate; The now resistless Lion that did ly, Like that brave Prince oth' Forest, fetterd by A crew of trembling Hunters; to the brow Of an high Promontory, that did bow Its black Clifts o're the clamorous Waves, they had Conveyd the noble Youth; the place a sad And dismal horrour wore, the grim aspects Of louring Rocks, the grey-ey'd Sea reflects,
In ugly glaring beams, the Night-Raven beats His ufty Wings, and from their iquallid seats, The baleful Scriek-Owls fly to bear their parts, In the sad murmure of the Night; those hearts Custome had steeld with Crimes, perhaps had bin Here frighted to repentance, had not sin Assisted by the hands of Avarice, drawn The Bridge of Reason, and obscur'd the dawn Of Infant goodness, to redeem the time Astonishment had lost, towards their Crime They now themselves precipitate the hand, Ordaind to ruine that fair Structure, and Unravel his Lifes even thred, prepares To strike the fatal blow; but he that dares Obstruct commanded Villany forbid The further progress of their guilt, and chid That pale sin in rough Language of, a strange Confused sound, striking their Ears did change The ominous Dirges of the Night into A various noise of humane Voyces, who Durst in that secret place approach, 'twas now Too late to think on, the Rocks spatious brow, Was clouded ore with men, whose glittering Armes Threatend destruction, ere their swift alarms Could summon sleeps infeebled aid; whilst they Forsake their Prisoner, who becomes a Prey To the Invaders, seeking safety in Their flight, they fall before him, that had been Ordaind to speedier ruine, entring at The open Salliport, they give by that Rash Act directions to the Foe, that mixt Promiscuously with them, and now had fixt
Their Standards on the Gates. The Castle in Feaverish alarms sweating, did begin To case her fiery stomach, by the breath O'th full-mouth'd Cannon. Ministers of death In this hot labour busily distills Extracted spirits, noyse and tumult fills The frighted City, whose fir'd turrets lent A dismal light. But the Assaylants spent Their bloud in vain, the Souldiers that had been At the first trembling fit distracted in Confusions giddy maze, had rallied now Their scattered spirits, and were seeking how To purge dishonours stains in the bright fire Of rage contracted valour. To retire Unto their Ships in safety, now is all Th' Invaders hope for, but so many fall In that attempt, it leave no triumphs due To Fortunes temple. By this winding clew Of various fate, Argalia only findes That stroke of death deceived, no hand unbindes His corded arms, but that which meant to lay Bondage as hard, so corrasives doe stay A Gangrene fed by springs of poysonous blood, When reaching at the heart, as these withstood The catarracts of death. With tyrants more Indomitable, then the sea that bore Their black Fleet, leave our Hero to untie This knotty riddle of his fate, whilst by The ignis fatuus of a fancie led With slow pac'd feet, through other paths we tread. The tumults of the City silenc'd in A peacefull calme, what the effects had bin
Of those loud clamours, whilst all seek to know Argalia's losse makes giddy wonder grow Into suspition, that this Act might be Some stratagem oth' Guvernour, to free Himself from a Successor, but those fly Darts of mistrust were rendred hurtless by His Princes Mandates, whose invenom'd hate, That spurious birth had made legitmate. Yet swift Revenge affonis his Treason in Its full carier, his Master having bin By him informd of a surprizal, where All sounds but death affrighted, could not bear The burthen of his Fears, and yet not sink Deeper in sin, ere the poor wretch could think On ought but undeserv'd Rewards, he by A brace of Mutes being strangl'd, from the high But empty Cloudes of Expectation drops, To let the World know what vain shadow props Those blood-ercted Pyramids that stand On secret Muthers black and rotten Sand. When thus the Sacusian had secur'd His future Fame, Passion that still endur'd A strong distemperature, slept not untill The story of their crosse Design did fill Palermo's Princes Ear, Argalia's losse, Was now the Ball that babling Fame did tosse Thorough the Court, upon whose airy Wing, Reaching the Island, it too soon did bring The heavy Nws, disguiz'd in Robes more sad Then truth to her, whose stock of Vertues had Been venter'd on that Sea of Merit, in Such forms of Griefe, as Princes that have been
Hurld from the splendent Glories of a Throne, Into a Dungeon, her great Soul did grone Beneath the Weights of grief; the doleful Tale, Had thunder-strook all joy, her Spir's exhale Their vigour forth in sighs, and faintly let That gorious Fabrick unto which they'r set Supporters fail to th' Earth; yet sorrow stayes Not in this frigid Zone, rude gief betrays Her Passions to her Fathers jealous Ear Who fearing least Argalia's Stars might clear Their smoaky Orb, and once more take a flight From deaths cold house by a translated Lgt, To sparate from sorrow, and again, In Fortunes house Lord of th' Ascendant Raig He doubts that Islands safety, and from thence Removes her with what speedy diligence, Fear could provoke suspition to; her Train Shook with that suddain change, desire in vain The Islands pleasure, ere they know how much Their Fates must differ; as it oft in such Unlookt for changes happens, each man vents His own Opinion, some did discontents, Of the young Princess, others that the season Of th' year was cause; but though none know his reason, All must obey his Will. The pleasan Isle Whose Walks, fair Gardens, Prospcts did beguile Time of so many happy hours, must now A solitary Wildernesse, whose brow, Winer had bound in folds of Ice, be left To wail their absence, whilst each Tree bereft Of Leaves, did like to Virgin Mourners stand, Cloathd in white Vails of glittering Icelets, and
Shook with the breath of those sharp windes that brought The hoarie Fish. The pensive birds had sought Out Springs that were unbar'd with ice, and there Grew hoarse with cold. The crusted earth did wear A rugged armour. Every bank unclad With flowers, conceal'd the juicie roots that had Adorned their Summers dresse. The Meadowes green And fragrant Mantle, withering lay between The griz'ie mountains naked armes. All growes Into a swift decay, as if it owes That tribute unto her departure, by Whose presence 'twas adorned. Seated did lie Within the circuit of Ghirenza's wall, (Though stretch'd t' imbrace) a Castle which they call The Princes tower, a place whose strength had stood Unshook with danger, when that violent flood Of warre rag'd in the Land, hither were brought Such (if of Noble bloud) whose greatnesse sought From treacherous plots extension, yet although To those a prison, here he did bestow His best of treasure, briefly, it had been Unto the Spartan Kings a Magazeen Since first they rul'd that Kingdome, and when ere A war drew near them, their industrious care Made it their place of residence; the hill 'Twas built upon, with's rockie feet did fill A spatious Iftmos, at its depth a Lake Supply'd by'th neighbouring sea, let in to make The Fort the more impregnable, with slow But a deep current running, did bestow A dreadfull prospect on the bended brow O'th hill, which cover'd with no earth did bow
Its torn clifts o're the heavy stream. The way That led to it, was o're a bridge, which they That guard it did each night draw up, from whence A steep ascent, whose natural defence Assisted by all helps of art, had made The fatal place so dangerous to invade, Each step a death presented. Here when he Had plac'd his daughter, whose securitie Rocks, walls, nor rivers warranted, without A trusty guard of Souldiers, hem'd about The walls, lesse hard then they. Those Gentlemen That on her happier Court attended, when Argalia did command them, as too milde Were now discharg'd, their office on a wilde Band of those Mountain Souldiers, who had in His last great war most fam'd for valour bin, Being confer'd, and these lest they should be Forc'd by commands into civilitie, Bestow'd upon the fierce Brumorchus, one Whose knotty disposition nature spun With all her coursest threds, composing it For strength, not beauty, yet a Lodging fit For such a rough, unpolish'd guest as that Black soul, whose dictates it ought trembled at, In feaverish glooms, whose subterranean fire Inflamed that ill-formed Chaos with desire Its vigour to imploy in nought of kin To goodnesse, till 'twas better temper'd in The Princes Court, where though he could not cast His former rudenesse off, yet having past The filing of the Courtiers tongues, at length It thus far wrought him, he converts that strength
To's Princes service, which till then had lay In Passions Fetters, learning to obey, The gentle strokes of Government; though bred In salvage wildness, nurst with blood, and fed With hourly Rapine, since he had forsook, Those Desart haunts, a firm obedience took, Hold on's robustious Nature, not to be By that effeiminate wanton (flattery) Strok'd to an yeilding mildnesse, which being known, To the mistrustful Prince, whose Passions grown So far above the reach of Reason, that Her strength could not support them, bending at Their own unweildy temper, sunk ino Acts, that his milder thoughts wou'd blush to do; Makes him from all his noble Captains choose Forth this indomitable beast; to use, So harsh a Discipline unto the sole Heir to his Crown, a Lady that did rowl More Vertues on the Spindle of her Life, Then Fate dayes length of Thred, had rais'd a strife, So high in his vext ubjects blood, that all Murmure in secret, but there's none durst call His Princes Acts in question, to behold Her Prison through their tears, and then unfold Their Friends a Vail of sorrow, is the most Their Charity durst do: But that which crost Distrst Pharonnida above the grief Of her restraint, or ought but the belief Of her Argalia's death, is now to be Bar'd when she wants it, most society With sorrowful Florenza, whilst she stayd The Partner of her secrets, now betrayd
By false Amphibia to her Father, and Banisht the Court, retiring to withstand The storms of greatnesse, to her Fathers own Poor quiet home, which as if nere she'd known, The beauties of a Palace, did content Her eaven thoughts at leasure to lament, In pensive tears, her wretched Mistresse Fate, Whose joyes eclips'd, converts her Robes of State To mourning Sables; what delights the place, Was capable of having to deface The Characters of grief, her Father strives To make them hers, but no such choice Flower thrives In the cold Region of her Breast, she makes Her Prison such as theirs, whose guilt forsakes All hopes of Mercy; the slow footed day, Hardly from Night distnguisht, steals away Few beams from her tear-clouded Eyes, and those A melancholy Pensivenesse bestows, On saddest Objects▪ The ore-shadowed Room Wherein she sate, seemd but a large siz'd Tomb, Where Beauty buried lay, its furniture Of doleful black hung in it, to inure, Her Eyes to Objects like her Thoughts, in which Night dress of sorrow, till a Smile enrich Impoverisht Beauty, I must leave her to Her sighs (those sad Companions) and renew His fatal Story, for whose Love alone, She dares exchange the Glories of a Throne. The end of the second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The third Book. CANTO THE THIRD. The ARGUMENT. V. From Treachery, which, two Princes Annals staind The brave Argalia by protecting Fate, Deliverd, Land, or Rhodes fair Isle attaind, Being there elected Champion for their State. VI. In which design, although with Vict'ry blest, The common Fate him soon a Pris'ner makes To a proud Turk, beneath whose power distrest, His vertue profferd liberty forsakes. THrough the dark pathes of dusty Annals, we, Led by his Valours light, return to see, Argalia's story, who, hath since that Night, Wherein he took that strange distracted flight,
From treacherous Ardenna perform'd a course So full of threatning dangers, that the force Of his protecting Angel, trembled to Support his fate, which crackt the slnder clew Of destiny almost to death,; His stars Doubting their influence, when such horrid wars The Gods proclaym'd, withdrew their languish'd beams Beneath Heavens spangled arch. In pitchie streams The heavy clouds unlade their wombs, untill The angrie windes fearing the floud should fill The aire (their Region where they rul'd) did break Their Marbe Lodgings; Natures self grew weak With these distemperatures, and seem'd to draw Tow'rd dissolution, her neglected Law Each Element forgot, th' imprisond flame When the Clouds stock of moysture could not tame Its violence, in Sulphry flashes break Through th' glaring aire. The swolne clouds speak In the loud voice of thunder; the sea raves And foams with anger, hurls his troubled waves High as the Moons dull Orb, whose waning light Withdrew, to adde more terror to the night. When the black curtain of this storm, that took The use of Art away, had made them look For nought but swift destruction, being so vain For'th' Marriners to row, that the proud main Scornd to be lasht with Oars; to ease distresse The night forsook them, but a day no lesse Dreadfull succeeds it, by whose doubtfull light The wretched Captives soon discover night Near them a Turkish Navie; to whose aid The Renegaoes (having first displaid
Their silver Crescents) joyn; Nor did they meet That help untimely, a brave Rhodian Fleet Set forth from those (the Christian Bulwarks) to Obstruct the Turks Invasions, was in view. To meet the threatning danger, which 'twas then Too late to wave, that miracle of men The brave Argalia, chain'd unto an oar Is with a thousand noble Captives more Forc'd to assist damn'd infidels; and now The well-arm'd Fleets drew near, their swift keels plow The Oceans angry front. First they salute Each other with their Cannon, those grown mute Come to more desperate fight, unfriendly bands Unite their Vessels, the fierce Souldier stands Firm on his Hatches, whilst another bords His active enemies, whose Ship affords No room for such unwelcome guests, but sends Their scattered limbs into thin air; Each bends His strength to's Foes destruction; plunging in Which bloudy sweat, the Rhodians hopes had bin Lost with their Fleet, had not kinde Fortune smil'd Thus on their fear; whilest action had beguil'd Each soul of passive cares, Argalia sees A way t' unlock his rusty Chain, and frees Himself and fellowes from their bank, which done, Those that continued at their Oars, did run The Vessel from the rest, and ere unto Their sight betray'd, the trembling Pirates slew. Then closing with their unsuspitious Foes I'th vigour of the fight, they discompose Their well rang'd Fleet, and such confusion strook Into the van, to see their Rear thus shook
With an unlook'd for Hirrocan, that in A fearfull haste the numerous Turks begin To stretch their fins and flee, but a their speed Was spent in vain, Argalia's hand had freed So many Captives, that their Gallies must Unto the windes uncertain favour trust Or else becalm'd, but seebly crawl before Their eager foes, who both with Sail and Ore Chac'd them to ruine. Glorious Victory, Thus to the Christian party being by A stranger purchac'd, with such high applause As those that rescue a declining cause From the approach of ruine, welcom'd, he Is now receiv'd into th' societie Of the brave Christian order. But they not Long joy'd in victory, ere the Turk to blot The stayns of being conquer'd out had made A mighty Army ready to invade The valiant Rhodians, where Argalia shewes So brave a spirit, their whole Army owes His valour for example. The Turks had ought Made desperate onslaughts on the Isle, but brought Nought back but wounds and infamy, but now Wearyed with toyle, they are resolv'd to bow Their stbborn resolutions with the strength Of not to be resisted want, the length Oth' Chronca' disease extended had To some few moneths, since to oppresse the sad But constant Islanders, the Army lay Circling their Confines. Whilest this tedious stay From battail rusts the Soldiers valour in His tainted Cabben, there had often bin
With all variety of Fortune fought Brave single Combats, whose successe had brought Honours unwither'd Lawrels on the brow Of either party; but the ballance now Forc'd by the hand of a brave Turk, inclin'd Wholly to them, thrice had his valour shin'd In victories refulgent rayes; thrice heard The shouts of Conquest thrice on's Lance appear'd The heads of noble Rhodians, which had strook A general sorrow 'mongst the Knights, all look Who next the Lists should enter, each desires The task were his, but honour now requires A spirit more then vulgar, or she dies The next attempt, their valours sacrifice, To prop whose ruines, chosen by the free Consent of all Argalia comes to be Their happy champion. Truce proclaym'd untill The combat ends, th'expecting people fill The spatious battlements, the Turks forsake Their Tents, of whom the City Ladies ake A dreadfull view, till a more noble sight Diverts their looks, each part behold their Knight With various wishes, whilest in bloud and sweat They toyl for Victory, the Conflicts heat Rag'd in their veins, which honour more inflam'd Then burning Calentures could doe, both blam'd The feeble influence of their Stars that gave No speedier conquest, each neglects to save Himself, to seek advantage to offend His eager Foe. The dreadfull combats end Nought but their losse of bloud proclaims their spirits, In that Reflux of heat and life inherit
Valours unconqueer'd throne; but now so long The Turks proud Champion had indu'd the strong Assaults of the stout Christian, till his strength Cool'd on the ground with's bloud, he fell at length Beneath his conquering Sword. The barbarous crew O'th Villains that did at a distance view Their Champions fall, all bands of truce forgot, Running to succour him, begin a hot And desperate combate with those Knights that stand To aid Argalia, by whose conquering hand Whole squadrons of them fall, but here he spent▪ His mighty Spirit in vain, their Cannons rent His scattered Troops, who for protection flie To'th City Gates, but closely followed by Their Foes did there for sad oblations fall To dying liberty; their batter'd wall Groan'd with the wondrous weight of Lead, and in Its ruines hides her battlements, within The bloudy streets the Turkish Crescents are Displayd, whilst all the miseries of warre Rag'd in Their Pallaces. The common sort Of people make the barbarous Souldier sport. In dieing, whilst those that survive them crave Their fate in vain, here cruelty did save And mercy only kill, since death set free Those happier Souls from dire captivity. At length the unrestrained Souldier tires Although not satisfies his foul desires With Rapts and Murder, when amongst those pore Distressed Captives that from thence they bore, Argalia lies in Chains, ordain'd to die A sacrifice unto the cruelty
Of the fierce Bashaw, whose lovd favourite in The Combate late he slew, yet had not bin In that so much unhappy, had not he That honour'd then his Sword with victorie Half-brother to Janusa been, a bright But cruel Lady, whose refin'd delight Her slave (though husband) Ammurat durst not Ruffle with discontent; wherefore to cool that hot Contention of her bloud, which be oresaw That heavy news would from her anger draw To quench with the brave Christians death, he sent Him living to her, that her anger spent In flaming torments, might not settle in The dregs of discontent. Staying to win Some Rhodian Castles, all the Prisoners were Sent with a guard into Sardinia, there To meet their wretched thraldome, from the rest Argalia sever'd, soon hopes to be blest With speedy death, though waited on by all The hell-instructed torments that could fall Within inventions reach; But hee's not yet Arriv'd to's period, his unmovd stars sit Thus in their Orbs secured. It was the use O'th Turksh pride, which triumphs in th'abuse Of suffering Christians, once before they take The ornaments of nature off, to make Their prisoners publike to the view that all Might mock their miseries, this sight did call Janusa to her Palace window, where Whilst she beholds them, love resolv'd to bear Her ruine on her treacherous eye-beams, till Her heart infected grew, their Orbs did fill
(As the most pleasing object) with the sight Of him whose Sword opend a way for th' flight Of her lov'd Brothers soul; At the first view Passion had strook her dumb, but when it grew Into desire, she speedily did send To have his name, which known, hate did deend Her heart, besieg'd with love, she sighs, and strait Commands him to a dungeon, but loves bait Cannot be so cast up, though to deface His Image in her soule she strives: the place For's execution, she commands to be Gainst the next day prepared, but rest and she Grow enemies about it, if she steal A slumber from her thoughts, that doth reveal Her passions in a dream, sometimes she thought She saw her Brothers pale grim Ghost, that brought His grizlie wounds to shew her, smeerd in bloud Standing before her fight, and by that floud Those red streams wept imploring vengeance, then (Inraged) she cries, Oh let him die, but when Her sleep imprison'd fancie, wandring in The shades of darkned Reason, did begin To draw Argalia's image on her soul, Loves Soveraign power did suddenly controul The strength of those abortive Embrio's, sprung From smotherd anger. The glad birds had sung A Lullaby to night, the Lark was fled On drooping wings, up from his dewy bed To fan them in the Rising Sun-beams, ere Whose early raigne, Janusa that could bear No longer lockt within her breast so great An army of rebellious passion, beat
From Reasons conquerd Fortresse, did unfold Her thoughts to Manto, a stout Wench, whose bold Wit, joynd with zeal to serve her, had endeard Her to her best Affections; having cleard All doubts with hopeful promises her made, By whose close wildes this plot must be convayd, To secret action, of her councel makes Two Evnuch Panders, by whose help she takes Argalia from his Keepers charge, as to Suffer more torments then the rest should do, And lodg'd him in that Castle, to affright And soften his great Soul with fear, the light Which lent its beams unto the dismal place, In which he lay, without presents the face Of horrour smeard in blood, a Scaffold built, To he the Stage of Murther, blusht with guilt Of Christian blood, by several torments let From the imprisoning Veins; this Object set To startle his Resolves, if good, and make His future joyes more welcome, could not shake The Heaven-built Pillers of his Soul, that stood Steady, though in the slippery pathes of blood. The gloomy Night now sate enthron'd in dead And silent shadows, Midnight Curtains spread The Earth in black, for what the falling day, Had blusht in fire, whilst the brave Prisoner lay Circl'd in darknesse, yet in those shades spends The hours with Angels, whose assistance lends Strength to the wings of Faith, which mounted on The Rock of hope, was hovering to be gone Tow'rds her eternal Fountain, from whose source, Celestial Love enjoynd her lower course.
Whilst in this holy Extasie, his knees Descent, did mount his heart to him that sees His thoughts disvellop'd, whilst dull shades opprest The drousie Hemisphear, whilst all did rest, Save those whose actions blusht at day-light, or Such wretched Souls whose sullen cares abhor Truce, with efeshing slumbers, he beholds A glimering light, whose neer approach unfods The Leaves of darknesse; whilst his wonder gows Big with Amazement, the dim Tapour shews What hand conveyd it thither, he might see False Manto enterd, who prepard to be A Bawd unto her lustful Mistesse cane, Not with perswasive Rhetorick t' inflame A heart congeald with deaths approach, but thaw Him from the frozen Rocks of rigid Law, With brighter Constellations, that did move In sphears, where every Star was fir'd with love. The Siren yet to shew that she had left Some modesty unrifl'd by the theft, Of mercenary basenesse, sadly wept, Her Errands Prologue, but guilt was not kept Within the Curtain long, she only sate, A Mourner for the sicknesse of his Fate, Until esteemd for pitiful, and then Prescribs this Remedy, Most blest of men, Compose thy wonder, and let only joy Dwel in thy Soul, my coming's to destroy, Not nurse thy trembling Fears; be but so wise To follow thy swift Fate, and thou mayst rise Above the reach of danger, in thy Armes Circle that power, whose radient brightnesse charms
Fierce Ammurat's anger, when his Crescents shine In a full Ob of Forces, what was thine Ere made a Prisoner, though the doubtful state Of the best Christian Monarch, will abate Its splendor, when (that Daughter of the Night) Thy feeble Star shines in a Heaven of Light. If Life, or Liberty then bare a shape Worthy thy Courting, swear not to escape By the attempts of strength, and I will free The Iron bonds of thy Captivity. A solemn Oath by that great power he serv'd, Took and believ'd, his hopes no longer sterv'd, In expectation, from that swarthy seat Of sad Despair, his narrow Jayl repleat, With lazy Damps, she leads him to a Room, In whose Delights Joyes Summer seemd to bloom; There left him to the brisk Society Of costly Bathes, and corsick Wines, whose high And sprightly temper, from cool Sherbets found A calm ally: here his harsh thoughts unwound Themselves in pleasure, as not fearing Fate So much, but that he dares to recreate His Spirits (by unweildy Action tir'd) With all that Lust into no Crime had fir'd. By Mutes (those silent Ministers of sin) His sullied Garments were remov'd, and in Their place such various Habits layd, as pride Would cloath her Favourites with, she means to hide From those Deformities, which Accident On Natures Issue, striving to prevent Forms eaven progresse casts, when she would twine That active Male with matter feminine.
Unruffl'd here by the rash Wearer rests Fair Persian Mantles, rich Sclavonian Vests. The gawdy Thuscan, or transmuted shape Of the phantastick French, the British Ape, The grave and constant Spaniard, all might here Find Garments, such as Princes would appear, To grace their honourd Nuptials in, or tell Strangers how much their Treasure doth excell▪ Though on this swift variety of Fate, He looks with wonder, yet his brave Soul sate, Too safe within her guards of Reason, to Be shook with Passion; that there's some bing new And strange approaching, after such a storm This gentle Calm assures him, but the form Of pleasure softens not, that which the other, And worse extream, not with fears damps could smother. He flies not with the rugged Separatist, Pleasures smooth Walks, nor doth enjoying twist Those threds of Gold to Fetters, he dares tast All mirth, but what Religions stock would wast. His Limbs (from Wounds but late recoverd) now Refresht with liquid Odours did allow Their suppl'd Nerves no soter rest, but in Such Robes as wore their Ornament within, Vaild o're their beauty; Linnen smooth, and soft, As Phoenix Down, and whiter then what's brought From furthest China he puts on, and then What habit Custome made familiar, when Cloathd in his own, makes choyce of for to be Most hoourd of that rich variety. In an Italian Garb, o th' Dubblet clad, Manto, Lusts swift and wachfull Spy that had
With an efficious care attended on That motion, entring, hasts him to be gone, To 'rd more sublim'd delights, which though a just And holy doubt proclaim the road of Lust, Knowing his better Angel did attend Upon each step, he ventures to descend The dreadful Precipiece so far, untill The burnig Vale was seen, then mounts the Hill Of Heaven-bred Fortitude, from whence disdain, Floods of contempt on those dark fires did rain. is guilty Conduct now had brought him neer Ihonusa's Room, the glaring Lights appear, Through the Windows chrystal Wals, the strong Perfumes of balmy Incense mixt among The wandring Attomes of the Aire did fly, Sights nimble Scouts, yet wer: made captive by A slower sence, as if but to reveal What breathd within, those Fugitives did steal, Thorough their unseen Salliports, which now Were uselesse grown, the open doors allow, A free accesse into the Room, where come, Such reall Forms he saw, as would strike dumb Their Alcharons Tales of Paradice; the fair And sparkling Jems ith' gilded Roof impair Their Fapours fires, yet both themselves confesse, Weak to those flames Ihonusa's eyes possesse. With such a joy, as bodies that do long For Souls shall meet them in the Doomsdayes throng, She that rul'd Princes, though not Passions, sate Waiting her Lover, on a Throne whose state Epitomiz'd the Empires Wealth, her Robe With costly pride had rob'd the checquerd Globe,
Of its most fair and orient Jewels, to Inhance its value; captive Princes, who Had lost their Crowns, might here those Jems have seen, That did adorn them, yet she trusts not in These Auxiliary strengths, her confidence In her own Beauty rests, which no defence Of Chastity ere yet withstood, and now She scorns to fear it, when her power did bow Unto a Slave condemnd, that nere could look To see the sight, but whilst some torment took The use of Eyes away, whilst he draws neer, (By her command) no lesse it did appear, Her wonder to behold his dauntlesse Spirit, Then his, what Vertue to applaud as Merit. Plac'd in a Seat neer her bright Throne, to stir His settl'd thoughts, she thus begins; From her Your Sword hath so much injur'd, as to shed Blood so neer kin to mine, that it was fed By the same milky Fountains, and within One Womb warmd into life, is such a sin, I could not pardon, did not Love commit A Rape upon my Mercy, all the wit Of man in vain Inventions, had been lost, Ere thou redeemd, which now although it cost, The price of all my Honours, I will do, Be but so full of gratitude, as to Repay my care with love: Why dost thou thus St dumb to my discourse, it lies in us, To raise, or ruine thee, and make my way Thorough their bloods, that our Imbraces stay. This on the spur of Passion spoke, she strains His hand in hers, where feeling the big Veins,
Beat with intemperate heat, conceiving it The strokes of Lust, to aggravate the Fit, Into a Paroxisme of Guilt, she shews (More then with modesty) how much she ows To Ntures Treasare, for that ill spent stock Of Beauty she enjoyd, her Eyes unlock Two Cabinets of sparkling Diamonds, which The even foils of Ebbon brows enrich, With a more Orient brightness; on her Cheek, The Roses (conquering the pale Lilly) seek To counterfeit a Blush, but vanquisht shame Submits to Love, in whose insulting flame, The modest Virgin a sad Martyr dies, And at Fames wounds, bled Passions Sacrifice. Natures embost work, her soft swelling breasts (Those Bals of living Ivory) unprest, Even with the Weight of Tiffany displayes, Whitenesse that sham'd the Swans, the blood that strais In Azare Channels over them did shew By their sweld steams, how high the Tyde did flow, Wherein her Pssions saild; the milky way Loves fragrant Valley that betwixt them lay, Was moist with balmy Dew, extracted by The busie Spirits that did hovering fly Thorough her boyling blood, whose raging flame, Had scortcht to death the April Flowers of shame. To charm those sullen Spirits that within, The dark Cells of his Conscience might have bin, Yet by Religion hid, that Gift divine, The Souls Composure, Musick did refine, The lazy Aire, whose pollisht Harmony, Whist dancing in reboubled Ecchoes, by
A wanton Song was answerd, whose each part, Invites the Hearing to betray the Heart. Having with all these choice Flowers strewd the way That leads to Lust, to shun the slow delay Of his approach, her sickly Passions hast To die in action; Come (she cries) we wast The pretious Minutes, now thou knowst for what Thou'rt sent for hither, which if active at, Thou only liv'st in my esteem; and then (O Impudence, which from the worst of men Might force a Blush) she swiftly hasts to tread Within Lusts Tropicks, her polluted Bed. And here black sinner, thou, whose bloods disease, Of kin to Hels, wants numbers to appease Its flaming Callenture, blusht to behold A Virgin Vertue, spotless leaves unfold In youthful Volume, whilst thy ripe years spent, In lust, hath lost thy Ages Ornament. In this, as hot and fierce a Charge of Vice, As (since he lost the field in Paradice) Man ever felt; the brave Argalia sits, With Vertue coold in Passions feaverish Fits: Yet at Lifes Garrisons his Pulses beat, In hot Alarums, till to a soft Retreat Cal'd by that fair Commandresse spight of all Beauties prevailing Rhetorick, though he fall, Ruin'd beneath her anger, he by this Unwelcome Language, her expected bliss, Converts to rage; And must my freedome then At such a rare be purchast, rather when My life expires in Torments, let my Name Forgotten die, then live in black-mouth'd Fame;
A srvant to thy Lust, go tempt thy own Da'd Infidels to sin, that nere had known The way to Vertue, not this cobweb Vail Of beauty which thou wearst, but as a Jayl, To a Soul, pale with guilt, can cover o're Thy Minds deformities; a tainted Whore Conscience proclaim thee will, when thou shalt sit, Shook with this spotted Feavers trembling Fit. (Rent from these gilded Pleasures) send me to A Dungeon dark as Hell, where shadows do Reign in eternal silence; Let these rich And costly Robes (the gawdy Trappings) which Thou meanst to cloath my sin in, be exchang'd For sordid Rags; when thy fierce spleen hath rang'd Through all invented torments, hoose the worst To punish my denial, less accurst, I so shall perish, then if by consent I'de taught thy guilty thoughts how to augment Their sins in action, and by giving ease To thy bloods Feaver, took its loathd disease. To have the spring-tyde of her pleasures, sweld By Lusts salt waters, thus by force expeld Back to Confusions troubl'd Sea, had made Such troops of Passion ready to invade, An ill desended Conscience, that her look Like a cast Felons, out of hopes of th' book; Was sad with silent guilt; the Room she leaves To her Contemner, who not long receives The benefit of rest, she that had been The Prologue unto this obstructed sin, With six am'd Slaves was enterd, thence to force Him to his dismal Jayl, but the Divorce
Of life, from those which first approacht, joynd to The others flight had put her to renew That scatterd strength, had not that sacred tye (His solemn Oath) from Laurld Victory, Snatcht the fair wreath, and though brave Valour strives To reach at Freedome through a thousand Lives: At her Command more tamely made him yield, Then conquerd Virgins in the Bridal Field. CANTO THE FOURTH▪ The ARGUMENT. Anger (improv'd by Lusts enormous Flam) Fires vext Jhonusa, with such sadex reams Of Rage, that her swcet Sexes native shame, Is scortcht to death, in those prodigious beams. Which wilst they to her angry Lord betray, Her Honours loss, such tumulis in him breed, That both their deaths must serve for an allay, Whose sudden fall our Christian Champion freed. OUr noble Captive to fair Vertues Throne, In safety past, though through Lusts burning Zone Finds in his Dungeons lazy damps, a rest More sweet, though with the heavy waights opprest, Of Iron bondage, then if they had bin Loves amorou wreaths (Jonusa's Armes) within Whose Ivory Circles he had slept; but shee, (Her grief compos'd of all malignity) Lusts flames unquencht converts to, whilst they burn. Black thoughts within her breast, that beauteous Urn Of Lusts corruption: sometimes anger flies Above the sphar of Reason, and there dyes, With tears extinguisht; she breaths Curses in Her Souls pale Agony, such as had bin
More deadly then infectious damps if not Strangl'd ith' Embrio, dead before their hot Poyson could work upon her fancie more Then spleenfull thoughts which were recal'd before Ripen'd for execution. Now she steeps Her down in tears, a floud of sorrow weeps Of power (if penitent) to expiate Youths vigorous sins, but all her mourning sate Beneath a darker Vayle then that which shades Repentant grief, since sinne but wisht invades The soul with that which leads to horror, when Grief for sins past bring into light agen One through a sea of trouble leads the way To a safe Harbour, th'other casts away Poor ship-wrackt Mortals, when by deaths swift stroak Lifes feeble hold is from hopes anchor broke. So far the fair Jonusa in this sad Region of grief had gone, till sorrow had That Feaver turn'd, upon whose flaming wings At first lust only sate, to one which brings Deaths symptomes near her heart, which had so long Beneath the burthen groand, untill the strong Disease had wrought up all the blood within Her checks into consuming flames; the skin Had lost its soft repose of flesh, and lay On nought but bones, whose sharpnesse did betray Their macerated nerves; The Rose had lost His Ensigns in her cheeks, and though it cost Payns near to death, the Lillie had alone Set his pale Banners up, no brightnesse shone Within her eyes dim Orbs, whose fading light Being quench'd in death, had set in endlesse night Had not the wise endeavours of her Mayd (The carefull Manto) griefs pale Scouts betrayd
By slie deceipt. Knowing if she should want Health, untill cur'd by that exotick plant The Captives love, what lust at first did burn With inflammations might a Gangrene turn, Although she cures not, yet gives present ease By laying Opiates to the harsh disease. A Letter, which, did for uncivil blame His first denyal, in the strangers name Disguiz'd she gives her, which, with eyes that did O're-flow with joy, read ore, had soon forbid Griefs sullen progresse, whose next stage had been O're Lifes short road, the Grave, deaths quiet Inne From whose dark terror by this gleam of light Like trembling children by a Lamps weak light Freed from nights dreadfull shadowes, she'd imbrac'd Sleep (natures darknesse) had not joy defac'd Those sooty characters, and on the wings Of ayrie hope (that wanton bird which sing As soon as fledg'd) advanc'd her to survey The dawning beauties of a long'd for day. But ere this pyramid of pleasure to Its height arrives, with's presence to undoe The golden structure, dreadfull Ammurat From's floting mansion, safely landed at The Cities Pott, impatient Love had brought In an untimely visit, ere swift thought Fetterd with guilt, could from his eager eye By an excuse to sanctuary flie, He enters, and she faints, in which pale trance His pity findes her, but to no such chance Imputes the cause, rather conceives it joy Whose rushing torrent, made her heart imploy His nimble servants, all her Spirits, to Prevent a deluge, which might else undoe
Loves new made Common-wealth; But whilst his care Hastens to help, her fortune did declare Her sorrows dark enigma, from her bed The Letter drops, which when lifes Army fled Their frontier Garrisons neglected had Been left within't, this seen, declares a sad Truth to'th amazed Bassa, though 'twere mixt With subtill falshood, whilst he stands betwixt High rage, and grief distracted, doubtfull yet In what new dresse to wear revenge, the fit Forsakes Ihonusa, who not knowing, she Detected stood, of Lusts conspiracie Gainst honours Royal Charter, from a low Voyce strayns a welcome, which did seem to flow From fickle discontent, such as the weak Lungs breath the thoughts in whilst their fibers break. To counterfeited slumbers, leaving her, He's gone, with silent anger to confer And though rage lives in fire, the fury lies Unseen through the false opticks of his eyes; With such a farwell as kinde husbands leave Their pregnant Wives, preparing to receive A Mothers first of blessings he forsakes The room, and into strict iquiry takes The wretched Manto, who ere she could call Excuse to aid, surpriz'd, discovers all Her sins black art, from whose dark Theorems, he This method drawes, that night design'd to be Lightn'd with Lusts hot triumphs, he pretends Commanded absence, yet the false stroke bends But towards that guard, ere by a swift reverse Brought back, his souls slie Scouts had gain'd commerce With all those enemies to honour by Whose aid Ihonusa ruins chastity;
Plac'd by false Manto in a Closet, which, Silent, and sad, had only to inrich Its roof with light, some few neglected beams Sent from Ihonusa's room, which serve as streams To wat intelligence; Here he beheld Whilest she, who with his absence had expelld All thoughtfull cares was with her joy swell'd high As Captives are when cal'd to liberty, Her Linnen (like a Princely Brides that meets In the soft folds of her first nuptial shees Perfum'd and costly, her fair bed was more Adorn'd then Shrines, whose Saints rich Kings adore, Incense in smoaky curles, climbs to the fair Roof, whilst choice musick rarifies the aire, Each element in more perfection here Then in their first creation did appear Yet liv'd in harmony, the wing'd fire lent Perfumes to'th aire, that to moist Cordials pent In Christal Vials, strength, and those impart Their vigour to that ball of earth, the hart, The nice eye here epitomiz'd might see Rich Persia's wealth, and old Rome's luxury But now (like Natures new made Favorite Who untill all created for delight Was fram'd, did nere see Paradice) comes in Deceiv'd Argalia, thinking he had been Cald thither to behold a Penitent Arming for death, not heavens choice blessings spent On th' vanities of Life, but mirth soon gives That thought its mortal wound, and shewes she lives Beyond that dark sphear, where her joyes did move As if her eyes alone gave Lawes to Love, Where beauties Constellations all did shine As if no crosse aspect could ere untwine
Their claspt Conjunctions, which did seem to guide Old Natures steps, till from their Zeniths pride, By vertue (the Souls motion) which the World In order keeps, into coufusion hurld. For here gay vanity, though cloathd in all Her gawdy Pageants, lets her Trophies fall Before bright Vertues Throne, with such a high Heroick scorn, as aged Saints that die Heavens Favourites, leave the trivial world, he slights That gilded Pomp, no splendent beam invites, His serious eye, to meet their Objects in An amorous glance, reserv'd as he had been, Before his grave Confessor, he beholds Beauties bright Magick, whilst its Art unfolds Great Loves mysterious Riddles, and commands Captive Ihonusa to infringe the Bands Of Matrimonial modesty; when all Temptation falls, she leaves her Throne to fall, (The scorn of Greatnesse) at his Feet; but Prayer (Like flattery) expires in uselesse aire, Too weak to hatter that firm confidence, Their torments thunder could not shake: from hence Despair (Loves Tyrant) had enford her to More wild Atempts, had not her Ammurat, who Unseen, beheld all this, prevented by His sight, the death of bleeding modesty. Made swift with rage, the ruffl'd Curtain flies His angry touch, he enters, fixt his eyes, (From whence some drops of rage distil) on her Whose heart had lent her Face its Character, Whilst he stood red with flaming anger, she Looks pale with fear, Passions disparity In such extreams, as Natures Laws require, 'Twixt Earths cold Center, and th' aires circling fire,
Dwelt in their troubl'd breasts, his wild eyes stood Like Comets, when attracting storms of blood Shook with portentuous sadnesse, whilst hers sate Like the dull earth, when trembling at the Fate Of those ensuing ills, heavy and fixt Within their Orbs. Passions thus strangely mixt, No various Feaver ere created in, The phrenzi'd Brain, when sleeps sweet calm had bin From her soft Throne depos'd: this Lightning past, Thunder succeeds, as burning Mountains cast Out horrid noise, after their flame and smoak, So having paus'd, his dreadful Voyce thus broke The dismal silence; Thou prodigious Whore, The curse of my Nativity, that more Afflicts me, then eternal wrath can do Spirits condemnd, some Fiends instruct me to Heighten revenge to thy desert, but so I should do more then Mortals may, and throw Thy spotted Soul to flames, yet I will give Its passe-port hence, for think not to out-live This hour, this fatal hour, ordaind to see, More then an Age before of Tragedy; She that fell from a Firmament of pride To Fortunes lowest Region, and there di'd A sad example to ensuing times, That Honours Altitude supports not Crimes. When in their stretcht Extentions reaching to Justice, which can through reverst Opticks view Giants, though Pigmy sins do oft appear, Like the dim Moon, more great, because more neer, Sins, that till fear their guilt did aggravate, Wore Vertues Frontispiece, since now too late To hope for life, in their own monstrous form, Encounter Reasons Guards, till the big storm
Of various pssions all were settled in Dregs of despair, when earing tears should winne The victory of anger, Ammurat drawes His Simmeer, which had in blood writ Lawes For conquerd Provinces, and with a swift And cruel rage, ere penitence could lift Her burthen'd soul in a repentant thought Tow'rds heaven, sheathes the cold steel in her soft And snowy breast, with a loud goan she falls Upon the blouy floore, half breathlesse calls For his untimely pity, but perceving The fleeting spirits with her bloud were leaving Her heart unguarded, she imployes that breath Which yet remain'd, not to bewayle her death, But beg his life that caus'd it, on her knees Srugling to rise, but now calm'd Ammurat frees Her from dsturbing death, in's last great work, And thus declares some vertue in a Turk; I have brave Christian by perusing thee In this great act of honour, learnt to be Too late thy slow-pac'd follower, this ing (with that Gives him his Signet) shall when question'd at The Castle guards, thy safety be, and now I see her bloods low water doth allow Me only time to lanch my souls black Bark Into deaths rubick Sea, for to the dark And silent Region, though we here were by Passion divorc'd, Fortune shall not deny Our souls to sail together: From thy eyes Remove deaths load, and see what sacrifice My Love is offering, with that word a stroak Pierces his breast, whose speedy pains invoak Deaths Opiates to appease them, be sinks down By's dying Wife, who ere the cold floud drown
Life in the deluge of her wounds, once more Betrayes her eyes to'th light, and though they bore The weight of death upon their Leads, did keep Them so long open, till the icie sleep Began to seize on him, and then she cries Oh see just heaven, see, see my Ammurat dies To wander with me in the unknown shade Of Immortality, but I have made The wounds that murther'd both, his hand that gave Mine, did but gently let me bloud to save An everlasting Feaver. Pardon me My dear, my dying Lord, Eternity Shall see my soul washt white in tears, but Oh I now feel times dear want, they will not nowe Fast as my stream of bloud. Christian farewell, When ere thou do'st our tragick story tell, Do not extenuate my crimes, but let Them in their own black charactes be set Near Ammurats bright vertues, that read by Th' unpractic'd Lover, which posterity (Whilst wanton windes play with our dust) shall raise On beauties throne, the good may justice prayse By his example, and the bad by mine From Vices Throne be scar'd to Vertues Shrine. And here the speed deaths messengers did make To hurry forth their souls, did faintly shake Her words into imperfect accents, this She cries is our last enterview, a kisse Then joyns their bloudlesse Lips; Each close the eyes O'th other, whilst the parting spirit flies Mounted on both their breaths, the latest gasp They ere must draw. Whilst with stiffe arms they clasp Each others neck, Argalia through a cloud Of liquid sorrow did behold the proud
Triumphs of death in their untimely fate, He sees great Ammurat for a Robe of State, Groveling in blood, the fair Ihonusa lie, Purpl'd in death; like pollisht Ivory. Dipt in Vermillion; the bright Chrystals that Her Soul in conquering flames lookt thorough at. Both quencht and coold in death; but time did lend His tears scarce passage, till a drop could end Its Journey o're his Checks, before a Page Whose cruelty had far out-grown his Age; Enters in hast, and with an anger that (Though indiscreet) at wrongs seemd kindl'd at, In wounds, did on the Bassas body vent A spleen that deaths discharge could not content. This seen, Argalia (to whom all must be Offence that injures fair humanity) Stops the vain Torrent, and a neerer way, To just revenge directs the angry Boy, Who by unfolded truth, now lets him know, His Rage to that uncivil height did grow, Not from a childish spleen, but wrongs that he A Christian, sufferd in Captivity. Assur'd by this confession, that he might Be useful more, then in a secret flight, Argalia bids him, in his Bassas Name, A Mandate, write for some of worthiest Fame, 'Mongst all the Christian Citizens, and those To send the Guard for, ere the Morning rose, On the black ruines of the Night; this done, Before that time the Victory had won Of opportunity (their Warders slain) Each Christian Captive from his rusty Chain, His bold band frees, and by their happy aide, The Gates being first secur'd, with ease dismayd;
The drousie Garrison, from whom they found But weak resistance, some soft fleep had bound To Beds of ease, intemperate Riot kept Others more vainly waking; here one slept Between a Mistresse Armes, and there another (Stole to a private Cattamit) did smoother Delight in whispers, in which loose Garb found, Ere time rowls up what slow neglect unwound, Even in securities soft Lap surpriz'd, They met grim death in Pleasures hape disguiz'd, All now being slain but feeble Eunuchs, and Poor trembling Maids, the new, but valiant Band Of late freed Captives Crown the Wals, from whence They saw the Soldiers wicked dilligence, In finding those which the false Mandate had Design'd for Ruine general, as sad The Cities sorrows were, a desolate And silent horror, unregarded sate, Ith' empty streets, which action had not fil'd, Yet with employment; but when day did gild The Ebbony of Night, to hear the rude Murmure that did, from the mixt multitude, Open'd together with their Doors, assures Argalia, that their ear, which yet secures, That bandfull of insulting Tyrants, might (With anger being charg'd home) be put to flight, With a reserve of hope, whilst every breast Was sweld with stiffl'd Spirits, whilst opprest With silent grief, helplesse Spectators, they Saw those they once for Vertue did obey, (Their reverend Senaors, whose silver'd heads, Age now made fit for ease) forc'd from their Beds, By feaverish powers rude fits, whose hear, not all The Jewleps of their Tears, though some drops fall
From Beauties lovely blossoms, cools their Rge, Neglected Youth slights like unreverent Age. But when the conquering Captives, by the brave Argalia rescued, from the Castle gave Bright Vict'ries Signal, when they saw each Lance, The bleeding head of a grim Turk advance Anger (like unobstructed Love) breaks forth In flaming hast, yet here the Want of worth And Valour 'mongst the City heard, had drove Them all to deaths dark Fields, if whilst they strove With that stout band of Iannizaries, they Had not been by Argalia taught the way To Victory, who in a sally meets Retreating fear, when crecping from the streets, To th' vain protection of their doors, and now His conquering Sword having taught all to bow Beneath its burnisht splendor, since the high Applause oth' loudest acclamations fly Beneath his worth, a general Vote elects, Him for their Prince, but his brave Soul affects Not so sublime a burthen, knowing they Bred under a Democrisie, obey Contracted power, but harshly he returns All to their Senate, who of late like Urns Nought but the uselesse Ashes did contain, Of their own Laws, which were by Conquest slin. But his refusal, where accptance, not Envy could say, Ambition had begot, But new Plants Vertue; who from thence did take The deeper Root, and 'mongst the throng did make That choice so Epedemical, that he For Valour feard, lov'd for Humility; The peoples prayer (those humble shrubs) that ow For safety to pow's Cedars) joyn to grow,
hadowd beneath his Merit, and create Him Prince oth' Senate, who (their doubtful state Requiring strong Ailies) A Fleet prepard, To seek those Princes, who their danger shard; Which ready with a prosperous Gale of wind, He (though imployd by Honour) sails to find Out Loves rich Indiaes, and with's white winged Fleet, Hastens Palermos neerest Port to meet. CANTO THE FIFTH. The ARGUMENT. With prosperous Sails mov'd from Sardinia's Shore, Argalia safe doth now from danger set The Cyprian Prince, who though so large in score, With noble friendship soon repays the Debt. In Sparta's Court they'r now arriv'd, where he That Life he sav'd, venters to serve him in An Act so great, it sets the Princess free, Who for his sake had long a Prisoner bin. WHilst with bent Oars Argalia's Squadrons move, Like the light wings of (Times Physitian) Love, Who steerd his course, and now had safely drawn Him through th' Ionian Waves, when by the dawn Of a still Morning, whose pale sickly light (Yet bounded in the Ebbony of Night) Shewd like a dull Quicksilver foil spread o're The Worlds great Glasse, whose even Surface bore Within their view two Galleons, whom they saw (Like timerous Hares) base Hunters give no Law;
Chac'd by a nimble, numerous flee. Drawn near, Christians the chac'd, the Chacers Turks appear, Which like a shole of smaller Fishes made So bold by number, that they durst invade The big bulkt Whale, on every side assails The slow-pac'd fleet, who, since not strength prevayls Against such ods, their fiery spirits spent In thunder, which, had from their broad sides sent The last great groan, for powers decease, and they Not their Foes terror, but good fortune lay. Whilest crampt in this convulsion of their fear Which (honour gilding) made despair appear The childe of fortitude, they all prepare Bravey to die, Argalia's squadrons bare Up with the winde, and ere the Turks proud Fleet (Deceiv'd by their own Crescents) fear to meet A danger (like a Hirrocane) falls in Destruction which was suffer'd whilest unseen. So wealthy Merchants, whose returning cost A storm on the pacifick Sea hath lost, Fall from the arms of hope. Sudden, and swift As inundations, whose impetuous drift Swallows a sleeping City up, had they Lost the firm hold of Victory, and lay Sad Captives in their own lost Ship, for flight Saves few, where all in hopes of conquest fight Fair Vict'ry made more bright by accident (Even when despair hopes wasted stock had spent) Those that were rescu'd, from their soft prayers raise To pay heavens tribute in their louder prayse Which (oft neglected) debt discharg'd, they gave (Allay'd with thanks) to him, whose band did save A miracle in their delivery, all Dsev'd applause, that can when mounted, fall
Ith' Circle of Humanity; to kisse Those hands wich pluckt him from the black Abbysse Of Death, their brave Commander goes, where he, (Discoverd by Majestick curtesie; Such real forms of worth, that (he was grown Rich in esteem, before more fully known. But long Truth stands not vail'd in a disguize Of Ignorance, ere they are taught to prize His Friendship at a higher rate, by seeing Their active Valour had been blest in freeing The Cyprian Prince, for such he was, and then, Bound for Morea: this made publick, when Acquaintance had taught Love more boldnesse, he All that discretion would permit to be Lodg'd in the Closet of a friendly Breast, Tels to Argalia, who (though in his best Of hopes, a Rival knowing him, was in Love too secure to harbour envious sin. Their prosperous Fleet, ere times short steps had trod In hours, a full dayes Journey safely rod At Anchor in Ghirenza's Bay, from whence When known, their Cannons in a loud expence, Proclaim their welcome; the Acquaintance that The Cyprians Father, ere his youth stayd at Its Summer Solstice, with Cleander had, Revives ith' Suns embraces, which the glad Citie in th' triumphs ecchoes, ere 'twas known, That his Resolves were such, as Love was grown, The wishes of the peoples throng, who thought That that unpollisht Prince Zoranza brought Unequal strength of Merit, ere to win The Fort Pharonnida lodg'd Vertue in. When first they enterd the admiring Court, Fame (wise mens care, but the Fools busie sport)
Making the Ear the Eyes wise Harbinger, By Learning first their Vertues, did coafer More honour on their persons, they beheld Ith' Cyprian Prince heroick worth, yet sweld With no ambitious tumour, calm and free, As whoesome aire, when its Ubiquity Breaths healthful blasts, where his smooth thoughts to all Most sweetly affable, but few could call His Love familiar, his Youth had not Yet learnt rough War, although from Precept got Its useful Rudiments, and by Valour shews Future Command may pay what Action ows To speculation; by the Grave, sad man, Whose counsel could Conspiracies unspan, When ready to give fire, he is beheld, As one whose Vertues far his years exceld; And might, when at maturity afford Length to the Scepter, from's victorious Sword. From this young Prince (Heavens hopeful Blossom) they Pleal'd but not satisfi'd, their Souls convey On those wing'd Messengers, their Eyes unto Manly Argalia, finding there a new And various form of worth on's Brow did sit, Reserv'd discretion, reconcil'd to Wit. Serious and grave his carriage, yet a Face, Where Loves fair Shrine did Wisdoms Temple grace. His scars (those broad Seals) which protecting sate, His future safety sign'd in, on him sate Not to deform, but until Age remain Like Mids of Honour plac'd in Beauties Train. True worth dwelt in the other; but in this Brave Heroes breast had her Metropolis. The Cyprians safety, and Sardinia's brave Redemption were the past:-ports which Fame gave
Unto his travelling prayse, which fled in haste Through th' ears short stages, in each breast had plac't A Love of's worth, which wise men softly prayse Whilst the loud throng to acclamations raise. Not long these true-born Sons of honour in Palerino's Court remaine, ere what had been The cause which had the youthfull Cyprian drew Froms Fathers Court, white fame presents unto Busie Inquirers; Which design from all Those swift (but weak recruits) good wishes call Except from some it most concern'd, mongst which Cleander staggers unresolv'd, the rich And powerfull Kingdome, which affinity With Cyprus promis'd, was a prize to be Valued before Epirus wealth, who though Of late victorious, yet could never grow Up to that glorious height. This thought the most Of all the ere obstructed love, had crost Zoranza's hopes, had not his wishes been (Though covetoly vast) confin'd within The others merits, amongst which the chief Opposes first it self, and the relief Whispers in's soul, that had been thence brought by Him, when his state wept bloud for liberty. This in the Scale of Justice seem'd as large As Loves dimensions, till a second charge Of thoughts proclaim the Cyprians power to doe The same if in necessity sought to, Which blames becoming gratitude, as in Relation to servility, a sinne In the great souls of Princes, who can be If they remain in debt for curtesie But Captives in the throne, too oft the cause Why meritorious Subjects meet the Lawes
Harsh Rigour for Reward, when their Deserts Many and great, o're fill their Princes hearts. Before Cleanders Gravity had layd This empest of his Passions, Fame betrayd Their Cause to the Epicote Prince, who hears The Cyprians welcome, which his various fears But briefly comment on, before without More slow delays then what were spent about The swiftest preparations, he intends To visit fair Pharonnida, and ends His Journey, ere a thought unwing'd with Love, Could lead him forth of's Court, which hast did prove His Passions stronger then the strength of age Appeard to promise what it might presage, To see at once two royal strangers in Their glorious Court, which both imployd had bin About one amorous Errand, strangely did Affect the Citizens, whose fears forbid The publick Stage, in private whispers tels What danger lay betwixt those parallels. Yet in the opposition of those Scars, That shine in Passions sphear, Loves civil Wars Had no field Army, all his power did rest Within the private Garrisons oth' breast, Which though besieg'd, by sly suspition made No verball Sallies, but prepare t'invade Beauties bright Province; yet, each only had A single Visit given unto the sad Sweet Object of their hopes, and thence receiv'd A Welcome, such as neither had bereav'd The others hopes, both rather finding cause Of cold despair,; Cleander pleads the Laws Of Nature, and free choice, to wave his own Engagements to Zoranza, which had blown
Loves sickly flame with the tempestuous breath Of anger forth, had not those thoughts to death, Ith' Bud been doom'd: whilst thus his Passions slept In Loves soft Armes, the noble Cyprian kept A distance 'twixt his hopes and wishes by The stayd Epicots interest, both rely On their own Merits, and Loves doubtful sate, Makes subject to the Monarchy of Fate. But whilst this busie Combate of the heart On equal tearms it fought, time bent to part The royal Champions, through the obscure Ports Of dark disguize into Loves field resorts, A third brave Combatant, whose Merit had (Though not ith' Armour of great Titles clad) By parly wonne that Maiden Fort, which they Although they scal'd, on golden Mountains, lay Before in vain; Argalia though within Ghirenza's Court, had yet a stranger bin, More then in Fame and big Report, to her Whose best of thoughts wore his Souls Character; And yet (although a Virgins bashful grace Conceald her own, for to behold that Face So much in debt to th' peoples Prayses) to Her window oft the royal Maid had drew, Where whilst his eyes did wast their Beams in vain, To pierce those stubborn Walls that did contain Rich Loves unvalued-Treasure, she beholds His brave Deportment, which, since strange, unfolds New Volumes of unprinted joy, which she (Sorrow affording so much liberty) Oft with delight looks o're, beholding in't Argalia's Vertues in a different print. But his wise Fare, even when his prayer grew weak In Faith, did through hopes cold Antartick break,
In a long Summers day, his noble friend The Princely Cyprian did so largely spend His stck of elouence in's praise when he Last saw divine Pharonnida, that she Although from no remoter cause then springs From Vertues publike love, tells him he brings His next best welcome with his Friend, which proud To be observant in, when time allow'd A visit he performs. Now to the Court, Beauties dull Cloyster, which no throng'd resort Of Clients fill they'r come, the surly Guard Those wakefull Dragons, did without reward Let in that danger in disguise, which had Met death i'th entrance, if in that unclad. The way that clest the scowling Rock, being by A thousand steps ascended, they i'th high Clifts finde the Royal Eglet, trying that Bright eye of her fair soul, discretion at The fiery beams of anger, which were shot From her Majestick Father. Being got Once more to breath his Soul upon that hand Where Loves first Vows, seal'd with his Lips did stand (Knowledge inflaming passions Feaver) like Unpractic'd Saints, which miracles do strike Into a Reverend zeal, he trembling takes That holy Relique, which a cold fear shakes In that warm touch. Her eyes fair splendor shoe Like bright Stars, in heavens trepidation Shook with the general motion, though betwixt The Sphears of Love and Wonder they stood fixt In their own Orbs, and their united beams Center'd on him, yet (like dead friends which dreams Imperfectly present) his Lovely form, As Marriners, when Land is through a storm
With doubtfull joy desery'd, she sees, but yet Knowledge had met with no prospective fit To guide her through the dark disguize, unto The Rode of truth, his Valour was in new Habiliments of honour cloath'd, and scars Made her Love's heaven adornd with unknown Stars. But whilest her Recollecting spirits were All busied, his Idea to compare With what she a saw, sudden glance o'th eye Disvellopes truth, that Jewel which was by His first Protector left is seen, by which Hope (near impoverisht with despair) growes rich In Faith (heavens tenure). But the rushing tide O're-flowes so much, that Loves fresh Rivers glide Over weak natures banks, she faints, and in A silent joy (contracted what had bin By Love dilated) from which giddy trance To rescue her Argalia doth advance To charge those troops of passions, which o're her Had prov'd victrious, nor did sate deferre Their Conquest long ere she displayes again Beauties fair Banner in Loves Ivory plain. Th' imprison'd spirits freed, the bloud in haste, (Fearing her Love had Wisdoms throne defac'd To beauties Frontiers flies. So mornings weep And blush together when they over-sleep Themselves in nights black bed. Though fears dull charm Whilst in the circle of Argalia's arms Like Dreams fantastick Visions vanish. in Her waking joyes, yet knowing they had been Betray'd into a strangers view, they both Stood mute with passion, till the Cyprian, loth To adde more weights unto affliction, by Imping Loves wings with noble courtesie
Fans off the Southern clouds of fear, and thus Calms the loud storm; Doubt not because to us, (Fair Princess) Loves mysterious Riddles are By accident resolv'd, the factious war Shall be renewd, such base intelligence, Traytors and Spies give, when the dark offence, Starts at discovery; if my service may Be useful (Know) I sooner dare betray My sins to th' world, then your intentions to A smooth Seducer: This rare interview May be my wonder; but shall never prove My guilt, though all the stratagems of Love Lay open to my heart, which though unskild In his Polemmicks, yet with truth is fil'd. Since now too late to seek protection by A faint denial, the wisht privacy Their Room afforded, gives them leave to lead His apprehension, where conceit did read The story of Loves civil Wars, whose Rage Since treaty could not calm, makes him engage His stock of power in their defence, and end His Passions progresse to let Love attend On Friendships royal Train, what not the force Of Earths united Beauties could divorce; Nor Wealths, nor Honours strong Attractions draw To other Objects, by that holy Law Informd, as hateful Sacriledge doth fly, The bold intrusion on Loves Hierarchy. VVith joy assur'd of such a powerful Friend The hopeful Lovers sadder cares suspend, To lay the plat-form of their safety by A fair escape, but fear doth oft unty The golden webs of Fancy, when they come To name the means, Invention then struck dumb,
Startles into distraction; no smooth stroke Of soft palmd flattery could ere provoke Sleep in her watchful Dragons, nor no shower Of ponderous Gold pierce through her sable Tower. The harsh Commander of her surly Guard, VVakeful as foaming Cerberus, and hard As Parian Quars, a heart that could not melt In Loves Alimbeck, the Slave never felt His Darts, but when Lust gave the wound, and then (Seard with enjoying) the blood stops agen, And leaves behind the Feaver, which Disease Now in him rag'd, Amphibia that could please None but a sympathizing Nature, in His blood had both Disease and Med'cine bin VVith Lusts Inchantments, thick loose glances, first Breeding a Callenture, whose sickly thirst Consenting, sin allays again; but long This Monster thrives not in the dark, ere strong By custome grown, with Impudence he dares Affront unvaild Report, and boldly bears Himself above those head-strong Torrents, by VVhose streams harsh Censure grew to callumny, Vvhich carelesse pride did unobstruct the way, Through which to liberty Loves progresse lay. A short delay, which lets not Fancy rest In idle thought, their Actions did disgest Into a Method; the succeeding Night To that great day by whose triumphant light, Their Annuall Feasts her Birth did celebrate, The time design'd, which done, to stroke rough Fate Into a calm, Argalia first finds out Despis'd Florenza, then imployd about Course Huswifery in the dull Country, where Shee soon became a Partner of his care;
Prepares for safety with a diligence, Whose privacy payes lavish Times expence. Now from Nights swarthy Region rose that day, 'Gainst which Invention taught her Babes the way To level at delight, though she flew high As Monarchs breasts, Beauty and Valour vie Each other in a conquering Pride, within A spatious field, that ought before had bin The Theater of Martial sports, each Knight, VVhom the desire of honour did invite By her swift Herald, Fame, were met, and all VVhom the respects of either part did call To th' Epicotes, or young Cyprians part Repair unto their Tents, which rich in Art, Adornd both sides oth' stately Lists, and lent Their Beauties to be Prospects Ornament. Neer to the Scaffold every seat was fil'd, Vvith bright Court beauties, Ladies that did gild Youth (Natures Throne of pollisht Ivory) in Pride, there but greatness, though low Fortunes sin. Rang'd next to these the City Madams, that Came both to wonder, and be wonderd at, Fine (as on their first Lady-dayes) did sit Comparing Fashions, to commend their wit; Besides the Silk-worms spoyls (their husbands gain) Jewels they wore (like Eyes in Beauties Wane) Grown dim with Age, so dim, that they did look As if they'd been from plunderd Delphos took, Although that sprung from Faction, yet each Face, Was all set form, hardly affording place For a stoln smile, save when some ticklish Lord Strikes sail, which they could wish should come abroad, Below, neer to the over-heated throng Sweet Country beauties, such as nere did wrong
Nature with nicer Art were seated, where Though big, rude pride cast them in Honours Rear, Yet in Loves Province they appeard to have Command from their acknowledgd beauty gave, Humble their Looks, yet Vertue there kept state, And made even Envy wish to immitate Their Fashions, not phantastick, yet their dresse Made Gallantry in Love with comliness. Whilst here the learnd Astronomers of Love, Observ'd how Eyes (those wandring Stars) did move, And thence with heedful Art did calculate Approaching changes in that doubtful state; The Princesse (like the Planet of the day) Comes with a luster forth that did betray The others beams into contempt, and made The Morning Stars of meaner beauties fade, Sadly confessing by their Languisht light, They shone but when her absence made it Night: Stately her look, yet not too high to be Seen in the Valleys of Humility; Clear as Heavens Brow was hers, her smiles to all, Like the Suns comforts, Epidemical: Yet by the boldest Gazer, with no lesse Reverence ador'd, then Persians in distresse; Do that bright power, who though familiar by, An aiery Medium, still is thron'd on high. Least the ungovernd Multitude which raise Their eyes to her, should in their lavish praise, From zeal, to superstition grow, they'r now Drawn off, the enterd Combatants allow Their Eyes no further leisure, but beginning Their Martial sports, with various fate were winning Bright Vict'ries Laurels. But I here must let Honour in their own stories Live, the debt
I ow to promise, but extends unto The fortune of our royal Lovers, who (Though both concernd in this) have actions far More full of Fate approaching, that bright Star, Which gave Argalia Victory here, scarce shews Its spangl'd Records unto which he ows, Far more sublime protection, yet it lends Vigour to that bright Planet which attends His future fortune, and discovers all His Astracismes in rising Cosmicall; Followd with Acclamations, such as made The troops of envy tremble to invade His conquering Fame, he leaves the Field, and by Cleander with Rewards of Victory First honourd in the publick view, is brought From thence to meet delitious mirth in soft Retir'd Delights, which in a spatious flood, From Princes breasts to tenifie the blood Of the blunt Soldier hasts, whose dull souls sweld With aiery pleasures had from thought expeld All sullen Cares, and leveld paths, unto Designs which did to their neglect ensue. The black-browd Night to Court the drousie World, Had put her starry Mantle on, and hurld Into the Sea (their spatious breasted Mother) Her dark Attendants, silent sleep did smoother Exalted Clamours, and in private meets The busie Whisperer sporting 'twixt his sheets, Vaild in which shady calm, Argalia by The noble Cyprian only, in his high Attempt assisted, now prepares to free The great Preserver of his liberty. Come to the Bridge, that to secure the sleep Oth carelesse Guard, which slender watch did keep,
Finding it drawn, the depth, and ugly look Oth' heavy stream, had from the Cyprian took All hopes of passage, till that doubt did end In greater fear (the danger of his Friend) Who with a Courage high, as if in that He'd centerd all the world did tremble at, In his precedent Victories, had cast Himself to th' mercy of the stream, and past In safety o're, though Nets enough were spread On her dark Face to make his Deaths cold bed. Giving his Spirits leave to fortifie His heart with breath, he then ascends the high Opposing Clifts, which in an ugly pride, Threatend beneath her ruin'd Scales to hide That rising flame of honour; being come To th' other side a Centry, but struck dumb With sleeps prevailing Retorick he finds, Upon whose Keys he seizes, and then binds His sluggish Limbs ere full awake, convays Him to a place, whence no loud cry betrayes The sounds of danger to his Fellows, that Reveld in louder mirth, unstartl'd at The Rivers depth, the wondring Cyprian now Crost the united Bridge, and being taught how By immitation to slight danger, goes With his brave Friend toward their careless Foes. Not far they were advanc'd, before they hear Approaching steps, a Soldier was drawn neer, Which to relieve, the other came, but shar'd In his misfortune, ere he had prepard To make resistance, which attempt succeeds, So equal to their wishes, that there neds No more to strengthen Faith; by the command Oth' Wil best Leader (Reason) both did stand
A while to view their danger, through a way Narrow and dark their dreadful passage lay; The rugged Rock upon each side so steep, That should they've miss't, no trembling hold could keep Them from the grasp of death; to add to this, More forms of horrour from the dark Abysse, Which under-min'd the Rocks rough sides they hear, A hollow murmure; the black Towers appear, Flanckt with destruction, every part did hold Peculiar terrour, but the whole unfold, Through the black Glasse of Night, a Face like that, Which Chaos wore, ere time was wakend at The first great Fiat, or could ought appear, More dark and dreadful, know 'twas emblem'd here. Safe past through the first steps of danger, they Now to the main Guard come, whom they betray By a soft knock, of all conceived 't had bin The Voyce their Centry cal'd for entrance in, Their Errand undisputed, Postern Gates Are open thrown, at which the royal Mates Both rushing in, strangely amaze them, but Now being enterd, 'twas too late to shut The danger forth, nor could Confusion lend Their trembling Nerves a strength fit to defend By opposition, in base flight lay all Their hopes of life, which some attempting fall On the dark road of death, but few escape, To shew their fellows dangers dredful shape. Whilst here like powerful winds that dissipate Infectious damps in unobstructed state, Their valour Reign'd, to tell them that the way Which led unto the Princesse freedome lay, Yet through more slippery pathes of blood, with hast Wild as their Rage; Burmorch Brother's plac't,
That Guards Commanders enter, loose neglect, Which drew them thence, since cause of that effect, They now redeem with speed; Riot had not Un-nerv'd their Limbs, although their blood grew hot, With large intemperate Draughts, the Feaver yet Ith' Spirits only dwelt, till this rude fit On the stretcht heart layes hold in flames, which had Scortcht Valours Wings, if not in Judgment clad. Here (though their numbers equal were, yet in A larger Volume danger had not bin Often before presented to the view Of the brave Champions, as if she had drew With doubtful Art Lines in the Scheam of Fate, For them and their proud Foes, pale Vertue sate Trembling for fear her power should not defend Her Followers 'gainst that strength which did attend Those big-bon'd Villains strokes, beneath whose force The Cyprian Prince had felt a sad divorce Of Natures Wedlock, if when sinking in The Icy sleep, deaths wide Gorge had not been Stopt by a stroke from fierce Argalia sent, To aide him when in his defence he'd spent His stock of strength, freed by which happy blow, From Janus Guard, since now his Friend lay low▪ Neer Deaths dark Vally, he contracts his power, To quench the others Lamp of Life, a shower Of wounds lets fall on's Enemy, which now Clog'd his Souls upper Garments, and allow His Eyes dim Opticks, no more use of light, Then what directs him in a staggering flight. Yet in the darknesse of approaching death, In Mischiefs Sables, that small stock of breath That yet remains to Clothe, he suddenly Gives fire unto a Cannon that was by
Wise care ordaind to give intelligence, When big with danger, fear could not dispence With times delayes; the Princess that within Her Closet, had that fatal Evening bin Retir'd and sad, whilst strong wing'd prayer acquaints Her flaming zeal with Heavens whole Quite of Saints, Thus startl'd by the treacherous thunder all Hr yet unnumberd stock of Beads lets fall 'Mongst those that prayer had ranckt, and did implore In one great shrick deliverance, to her door Hasts to behold the danger of those Friends On whose success (Loves fortresse) hope depends. Where being come, her eyes first progresse met Her prayers Reward, even whilst his Sword was wet With blood (the balm of Victory) but long The Extasies of Fancy, though more strong Then sacred Raptures last not, all was now Too full of noise and tumult, to allow A Room for Passions flow, disputes within The Schools of Action, loud Alarums in The Castle, Court, and City rag'd, all were Huddl'd into confusion, some prepare To fly, what others with an Ignorance, As great (though bolder) to oppose advance. Here had our Heaven-protected Lovers lost, What such large summs of prayers and tears had cost, Had not the torrent of the peoples throng, When rushing towards the Castle, by a strong Voyce, danger, been diverted to prevent A hungry flame, which in the Cyprians Tent Began, had spread its aire-dilated wings Over the City, whose feard danger brings On them a worse distemperature, then all Their last Nights Surfets, whilst proud Turrets fall
In their own Ashes, the discordant Bells, Ordaind to call for aide, but ring their Knels, That in a drunken fury, half awake First their warm Beds, and then their Lives forsake, For to destruction here big pride had sweld, Had not Nights errors been by day expeld. With swift Cals frighted, but more terrifi'd At their sad Cause, Fear being his doubtful Guide; The stout Epicote to Cleanders Court, Repairs, and there amongst a thick resort Of Subjects, finds the Prince distracted by Those Epidemick Clamours that did fly From every part oth' City, to appease Whose fury whilst he goes, the sharp disease, In flames feeds on her ruin'd beauty, and Mounts on insulting wings, which to withstand, Th' amaz'd Inhabitants did stop its flight, With the whole weight of Rivers, till that light Which an Usurper on the sooty Throne Of darknesse sate, vanisht, or only shone From their dim Torches Rayes, the Prince thus stayd, In's hasty Journey, till the flames allayd, Lent safety to the City, by it gave The royal Fugitives the time to save Themselves by flight, from those ensuing ills, Whose clamorous Scouts (rude sounds) the stird aire fills. Descended to the Gardens Postern Gate, A place where silence yet unruffl'd sate. A Night obscure, and an unhaunted way, Conspiring their Pursuers to betray, To dark mistakes, with silent Joy which had All Fears pale symptomes in Loves purple clad; Close as that bold Attempter, whose brave theft Was sacred fire (the walks behind them left)
Argalia hasts unto the Castle Moat, With his rich prize, there a neglected Boat Half hid amongst the Willow Beds, finds ou, In which Pharonnida, that nought could doubt, Whilst her successful Lover steerd, past o're To meet the safety of a larger Shore. The end of the third Book.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO I. The Argument. I. Whilst noise and tumult fills the Court, the sad Orlinda to lament alone, retir'd, Finds the brave Captain in deaths symptoms clad, Whose perfect health her friendly care acquir'd. II. The Scouts with an unwelcom emptiness Of news return'd; the Princess secret flight Yet well succeeds, but now in sad distress Find a black morning to that dismal night. VVHen Fear, like an unskilful Pilot in A storm distracted, long in vain had been Plac'd at the helm of Action, whilst those rude Waves, rais'd by greater winds, the Multitude
Swell'd with uncertain councels, all met in A thick and dangerous confluence, those within The Castle by a hotter passion to A high wrought fury startled, did undo Those links of councel, which the other broke With corrosives of fear, by the rude stroke Of heedless Anger, whose uncivil strife Had robd Revenge of justice, and each life That here was in deaths inundation spilt, Shed but to aggrevate a private guilt; Had not the Prince, whose angers flame they fear'd More then grim death, t'appease the storm appear'd. Beat from the out-works of their hopes, all in A busie tumult are imploy'd within The Princess lodgings; but there only find Their knowledge by her secret flight strook blind, Stumbl'd on errors; No characters but what The wasteful hand of death had scatter'd at The Guard informs them; and even those seem left The weak opposers of successful theft, Dropt as their Foes victorious fate slue by, To shew his fortune, and their loyalty. Leaving which late warm tenements of breath, Without once throwing up that bed of death, Their grave-cloaths ore them, every active friend Hasts toward her search, whilst suffering females spend
The hours (grown slow since burden'd by their fears) In prayrs, whose doubts they numbred by their tears. But amongst all of those that sacrific'd Tears to her loss, sorrow had most disguis'd Lovely Orlinda, the fair sister to The vext Messenian, who with Love that grew From equal attributes of Honor, in The parallels of Beauty plac'd had been In this restraint of liberty so long Her pleas'd Companion, that her grief too strong For comfort grown, to mourn her absence she Forsaking all her friends societie, Whilst seeking of some shady grove is brought To one whose vail, black as her darkest thought, Appear'd so much a stranger to the light, That solitude did thither soon invite The pensive Lady, who, whilst entring, by A deep groans sound diverted, turns her eye Toward one, who near the utmost ebb of life Disguis'd in's blood, was with the latest strife Of death contending; at the dreadful view Of which sad object she retreating to Some of her maids, who fearing to intrude Whilst she appear'd intending solitude, A distance kept, made hold by number, now Return to see if life did yet allow
A room for help, or if his soul were fled, To let their care intomb the helpless dead. Arriv'd so near, that through the rubrick vail Of's blood they saw how life did yet prevail O'er deaths convulsions, they behold one lie, Whose wound's an object for their charity, Soon drew them nearer in such trembling haste, As if they fear'd those lavish springs would waste Lifes stock too fast; where come, with linen soft And white as were those hands that thither brought That blessing, having gently wip'd away His blood, his face discover'd did betray Him to their knowledge; for the Ciprian Prince All soon conclude him, whose desert e'er since That Court she knew, had to Orlinda prov'd A dear delight, yet she ne'er knew she lov'd, Till her soft pitty, and his sad distress Conspiring to betray that bashfulness Whose blushes scorch'd that tender plant, did now Even in their fortunes roughest storm allow It leave to grow, safe, since yet passing by No other name but noble charity. By all the nimblest stratagems which Art E'er learnt from nature, striving to impart The best of mortal blessings, health, unto Her Royal patient, prais'd Orlinda grew
So high in his deserv'd esteem, that though Posterity doth to his friendship ow For their most perfect copy, knowing she Too much ador'd Pharonnida to be Her base betrayer, when his healths advance Gave way for language, every circumstance Declares which was in that so fatal night, The sad preludiums to her secret flight; By which when she whose love (though full of fire) Yet lay rak'd up in a remote desire, Unstirr'd by hope, with joy had learn'd that he More then what friendship parroniz'd, was free From all affection to the Princess, in Her eyes, which until then had clouded bin. Love with as bright and pure a flame as ere, Did in the shades of modesty declare; Passion, breaks forth, which happy signs by him Whose heart, her eys, even whilst they shone most dim With mutual flames had fir'd, that loyal love Which fate in vain shall struggle to remove, Begins with flames as innocently bright As the first rayes of new created light. But stay rash Reader, think not they're led Through these smooth walks unto their nuptial bed; But now, behold, that their misfortune prove, Which thou hast wept for, if thou e'er didst love
A separation, the suspition that Sparta's vext King, when first distemper'd at His daughters loss, did of this stranger Prince Justly conceive, perswades him now that since Not found within the Cyprian Court, that he Who had been vainly sought abroad might be Yet lodg'd at home, which supposition bred So strict a search, that though the silent dead Not silenter then her Attendants were, Yet kind Orlinda whom a pious care Prompted to save what she did yet possess, Whilst seeking with a Lovers tenderness How to secure him, doth at length convay Her roving fancy to this hopeful way. Not long before, though now 'twere silenc'd in Domestick ills, Report had busied been In the relating of the sad distress Of a brave Lybian Prince, whom heaven to bless With an eternal Crown, in midst of all His Youths fresh glories, by a powerful call Summons to serve her, and that faith which he Had from the early dawn of infancie Suckt from the great Impostor of the East, Though now by time Opinions strength increast, Spight of a peoples prayers or fathers threats Wholly forsaking; which revolt begets
So much aversion, pitty could invent Nought easier then perpetual banishment To punish what their faith, mistaken in Its object, terms a black Apostates sin. Disguis'd in such a dress, as pitty might Expect t'encounter so distrest a Wight As was that wandring Prince, attended by No train but what becomes th'obscurity Of such a fortune, to the Spartan Court Amindor comes, where though the thick resort Of well known friends might justly make him fear Some treacherous eye; knowledge could ne'r appear Through that black vail his happy art had took To make him like a sun-burnt Lybian look. Yet what engag'd them more then safety in Prayers to heaven, his person had not bin Not long the wonder of the Court, before His fairer vertues which adorn'd him more Then th'other could disguise, did justly prove The happy object of the Princes love, Whose influence whilst it him to power did raise Taught by reflex the people how to praise That fair election, till the Pyramed Rais'd to his fame, had fixt its lofty head Above the clouds of fortune, yet not this Fates fairest smile, a Lovers best of bliss,
A free commerce, which unsuspected might, Though long and pleasant as the Summers light, Be ne'r disturb'd, with fair Orlinda gives Content such fulness, that although he lives To all unknown but her alone, in that Enjoy'd more then ambition e'er aim'd at. And now from all the fruitless diligence Of inquisitions, and the vain expence Of time, return'd were every troop that had Trew forlorn hopes been, Active in the sad Search of Pharonnida, which ending in A just despair, some that till then within The Castle walls had (though as vainly) sought, Their sorrow forth, before the griev'd Prince brought Brunorchus, whom they in a small lodge, where Secur'd by sollitude, the houshold care Of locks and bolts were vain unsought, they found In the soft bands of griefs, best opiate bound, Sleep, who though thron'd within her ebbon seat From lusts hor field appears, but his retreat When tir'd with action; for besides him they Where's poisons antidote, Amphibia lay Block'd up in's arms, beheld the air with all Their voices stroke at length, had rais'd a call That drown'd their sleeping thunder, from the bed Brunorchus starting struggles to have fled
The shamefull danger, whilst Amphibia creeps Beneath her sheets protection, but nought keeps Pursuing vengeance back, there took, and brought Before the Prince, who startl'd at the thought Of such a complicated crime, refers Their punishment to death 's dire Messengers. The yet succesfull Lovers long e'er this Safely arriv'd at their first stage of bliss, Florenza's low unenvied roof, did there Since speed was now the fairest childe of care, Stay only to exchange their horse, and take With her a guide whose practick skill could make Their untrod paths familiar, through a low Dark vail where shade-affecting weeds did grow Eternal strangers to the Sun, did lie The narrow path, frequented onely by The forest Tyrants when they bore their prey From open dangers of discovering day. Past through this desart valey, they were now Climing an easie hill, where every bough Maintain'd a feather'd chorister to sing Soft Pahegyricks, and the rude windes bring Into a murmuring slumber, whilst the calm Morn on each leaf did hang her liquid balm, With an intent before the next Suns birth To drop it in those wounds which the cleft earth
Receiv'd from's last days beams, the hills ascent Wound up by action, in a large extent Of leavie plains, shews them the canopie Beneath whose shadow their large way did lie: Which being lookt ore, whilst thankful praise did pay Their debts to heaven, they thence with a convay Of prayers (those swift ambassadors) did send A hopeful glance tow'rd their large journies end. These short surveys past, since the place assures A safe repose to cool the Calentures Of feverish action, down a way that led From Pleasures throne unto her fragrant bed A rank of Laurels, spreading to protect The flowry path, which not unprun'd neglect Robb'd of delight, they past, the slow descent Soon brings them where her richest ornament (Although with art unpleited) Nature in A lovely Landshape wore, that once had been Sacred to th'Islands fruitful Goddess; here Whilst they behold the infants of the year Ith' Springs unsullied livery clad, the fair And large-limb'd trees, preparing to repair Autums spent stock, from out an humble hill A tributary fountain did distill The earths cold blood, and murmuring convays It on a bed of peebles, till it pays
Her debts to th' neighboring river. Near to it Full Chorusses of feather'd Hero's sit Amidst their willow-mansions, to whose ease Their shrill notes call the sportive Driades. Whilst by the brightest glories of that age This Royal robe worne in a hermitage Is seen with such a silent sad delight As smooths the furrows of an Anchorite; Their solemn walk had brought them to a green Skirt of that mantle fairly spread between Two mossie rocks, that near the chrystal slood Appendixes to larger mountains stood: Near which they saw, with mournful majesty, A heap of solitary ruines lie Half-sepulchred in dust, the bankrupt heir To prodigal Antiquity, whose fair Composures did (beneath times pride sunk low) But dim vestigia's of their beauty shew. Yet that it might unreverend gazers tell It once was sacred Ceres image fell From a thrones splendor did neglected lie Sunk with her temple to deformitie, Dark, gloomy groves, which holy altars shade With solitude, such as religion made Full of an awful reverence, and drew The ravisht soul from the worlds wandring view,
Circled the sacred valley, into one Of which our Royal Lovers were alone Retir'd in private sollitude to pay Sleeps forfeitures, whilst the bright bloomy day Sweats the hidroptick earth, but joy denies That sullen ghest an entrance in their eies. Their eyes, which now like wandring Plannets met After a race of cross aspects, and set Within a firmament of beauty, thence On Loves cold Region dropt their influence; Warm'd by whose vigor, springs of pleasures had, Watring their cheeks, those fields in roses clad. Fear, that till now had made them languish in A dang'rous hectick, or at best had bin But cas'd with intervals, which did include Ambiguous hopes in times vicissitude, Ceas'd to usurp, yet (though the throne expell'd) A large command in Reasons Empire held Leading those parties which wise counsel sent Close ambuscado'd dangers to prevent; Nor could the conduct fail, assail'd by ought Within the circuit of extended thought. Deliberation (the souls wary Scout) Being still imploy'd to lead fresh parties out 'Gainst the known enemies of hope. But here Black Troops of danger, undiscern'd of fear,
Assaults unralli'd fortitude, whilst she Slept 'mongst the rose-beds of securitie. Exalted far above the gross mistakes Of vulgar love, cloth'd in such thoughts as shakes Ripe souls from out their husks of earth, to be Pick'd up by Angels, joys Stenographie In their embraces met; not with less strength Of love (though yet not to be wrought at length) Then that which meets in nuptial folds when they Reap Heavens first blessing, in their bloods allay Met their full seas of passion, yet both calm As vertues brow, their blood but warm'd like balm To pour in sorrows wounds, not boild into A scum of lust, The worlds first man did wo The blushing offpring of his side, the fist Unpractickt Virgin, with as great a thirst Of blood as theirs, when in the safe defence Of Paradice each act was innocence. Here whilst thir sweet imployment was discourse Taught in the School of Vertue, to divorce Those maiden brides, their twisted eye-beams, sleep Which flies the open gates of care, did creep In at their cristal windows to remove The lamp of joy, fill'd with the oil of love. The Princess spirits fled from the distress Of action into calm for getfulness
Having the Curtains drawn, Argalia's head Softly reposing on her lap (that bed) Of precious odors, there receives a while A rest, for sweetness such as Saints beguile Time in, in their still dormitories till Heavens summons shall their hopes on earth fulfill. Remov'd from them, feeding his horses in A well-fle'd meddow which that age had seen Till then ne'er loose its Sommer robe before, Russet with age, he put it off, and wore A glittering tissue furr'd with snow, did lie Their careful guide, secure, till frighted by A dreadful noise of horse, whose rushing wakes Him to behold; what seen with terror shakes Off sleeps declining weights, in such a strange Amaze as (forts surpris'd) the skar'd guards, change Their swords for Fetters, flying he looks back On the steel froned troop, till at his back Approaching danger gathering in a cloud Of death overwhelms him, frighting with its loud Exalted clamors from their then clos'd eyes, (Loves altars,) sleeps intended sacrifice. Shook from their slumber with the first salutes Of light to meet their ruin, thick recruits Of brave resolves into Argalia's brest, Had swiftly summon'd; but the Princess rest.
Exchang'd for wilde amazement, in which sad Restraint of spirits, life with beauty had Fled to the silent Region, if not by Her Royal friend supported, who the high Pitch of exalted anger, whilst he draws His sword to vindicate their righteous cause, Descends to comfort her, thinking those troops Her Fathers Messengers, his brave soul stoops Not to request a favor; but although Their multitude, in hopes account outgrow Life more then those diseases which attend On ages cold extream, he dares defend Love, though by vigor of supream commands Depriv'd of favor's mercinary Bands. Prompted by power that soveraign antidote 'Gainst Natures poyson, baseness and by roate) Not Arts fair Rules, taught Lessons of defence: These dregs of men, not having more pretence Then what from Riot was extorted, in Unwieldy throngs the conquest strive to win From single valor, not the powerfull pray'r Of her whose voice had purified the ayr To a seraphick excellence, the sweet, Heav'n lov'd Pharonnida could come to meet Pitty in this rude wilderness, her words Losing their form in the wild air affords
Their busie souls no heedfull leasure, but With wilder passions the soul's portals shut. That sober friend to happy sollitude, Silence, which long those blest shades did include, By rude noise banisht from her solemn Throne, Did in a deep and hollow eccho grone; Whilst the brave Champion, whose own worth did bring Assistance, yet had in a bloody ring Strew'd death's pale triumphs, and in safety stands The dangerous business of so many hands, All which had in the grave joyn'd palms, if by One stroke that index unto victory, His sword, had not with sudden breaking prov'd Traitor to th' strength by whose command it mov'd. Rob'd of this safe defence, Valors brave flame In vain is spent, that Piramis of fame Built by his hand o'er Loves fair temple, now Even in the view of 's Saint is forc't to bow Beneath an earthquake, his commanding soule In this sharp conflict, striving to controle Nature, (rebellious to her power) lets flye In vain the piercing lightning of the eye, Whose dark leads drooping in a death like close, Forbids high fury thundring on his soes. He falls, and from each purple salliport Of wounds, tir'd spirits, in a thick resort
Flie the approach; in which wild trance His eyes did their declining lights advance Above their gloom of darkness to convay The last faint beam of natures falling day To his distrest Pharonnida: but she In clouds of sorrow lost, was gone to be Close mourner for his rigid fare beneathe A pale sowns shady vale, and could not breathe One sigh to welcom those sick guests, nor lend A beam to light them to their journies end; Which being depriv'd of, in deaths dark disguise Forgetful shadows did obscure his eyes. Branded with an ignoble victory, His base oppressors, staying not to try Where fire remains in lifes dark lamp, forsake Their bleeding shame, and only with them take The trembling Ladies, whose amazement yet Griefs floodgates shuts in a distracting fit Of wilder passions, circled in which cloud She's hurried thence; and ere that damp aloud Light through her souls prospectives, had past ore Much of the Desart, and arriv'd before A barren Rocks proud front; which being too steep For the laborious traveller, a deep Dark vault did pierce, whose dismal black descent Safe passage to a distant valley lent.
With slow ill-boding steps, this horrid way Orecome, they meet the Beauties of the day Within the pregnant vale, a place that shewed Some art had prun'd what natures hand bestowed. No earth-encumbring weeds, but wholsom plants Such as relieve the winter of our wants, Were here in comely order plac'd, each tree Tir'd with his fruitful burden stoops to be Eas'd by the lowliest hand; for want of which Their feeble stems had dropt them to enrich Their pregnant mother; this civilitie Proclaiming more then art had meant to be The dress of desarts, did at first appear As if those useful blessings had for fear That wasteful man should ravish them to feed his luxury, fled thither; none that need Such thrifty joys in the circumference Oth' vally seeming to have residence. All whose exalted pride did terminate The levell'd eye, was a round hill that sate As center to the golden vale, come near To which, what did externally appear A rock in ivy drest, being enter'd shewed The beauties of a gorgeous palace, hewed Out of the living stone, whose vaulted brest Had by the union of each part exprest
The strength of Concord; The black Rock was all Tinsell'd with windows, over which did fall Thin Ivy-wreaths, like Cobweb-vails that shade The salliports of Beauty, only made To cool, not darken, and on those that sit VVithin bestow a shady benefit. They being drawn near, a sad old man that sate Unwilling Porter, from the spacious gate Withdrew the verdant curtain, she is now Enter'd the Castle, where could fear allow Her eyes that liberty she had survai'd, Buildings, whose strength with beauty join'd, betrai'd Times modern issues to contempt, and by A lasting glory prais'd antiquity. But Pleasure spreads her baits in vain, she sate Beneath the frozen Artick of her fate, Whilst he from whose aspect she only felt, Delightful heat, in's winter-solstice dwelt. More to depress her sinking spirits, she Too soon finds cause to think that gravitie She met ith' entrance, but the reverend shade Of injur'd worth, which accident had made Stoop to that bondage, vertue drooping in His furrowed cheeks, as if depos'd, she'd bin Thither confin'd within the walls, to let Imperious vice her painted banners set.
A troop of wild Bandits, vilains whose guilt Shun'd publick haunts, heavns privat blessings spilt There in luxurious riot, which grown bold By toleration, durst to th' light unfold Vices deformedst issues; nought by th' name Of sin being known, but sins betrayer, shame. In such a loose intemperance as raigns In conquer'd cities, when the soldiers pains With spoils of peace is paid, they liv'd: 'mongst these Some few unhappy women kept t'appease Lusts tumults, she beheld, whose looks betraid A sickly guilt, and made the Royal maid Amidst her griefs cold symptoms blush to see How pale they look'd with Lusts deformitie. Whilst these are view'd, with such a change as that Poor Village-drunkards are enforc'd to at An Officers approach, when the night grows Deep as their draughts, she sees them all compose Their late wild looks; nor was this dress of fear In vain put on, Almanzor did appear Dreaded Almanzor, who on them had built A power, which though by unsuccessful guilt Banisht to th' desart, forc'd their wants to be The helpless sufferers of his tyrannie. Past through the fear dispersed throng, he's to The Princess come, where startled at the view
Of Majesty, shrinks back, unsteady haste VVhich brought him there but to view Beauties plac'd VVithin the reach of 's lust, assaulted by Objects that both to love and loyalty Had prov'd him an apostate, to retreat Within a blush attempts; but that's too great A friend to bashful vertue in that face Whose heart deposes her, to sprinkle grace. Ruffled with this recoil of spirits, in Such troubled haste as Novices begin New conn'd orations, he himself applies To th' injur'd Lady, whose brave spirit flies Not what she fear'd, but with the brave defence Of scorn opposes blushless impudence, Crushing the embrio's of that language, in Whose guilty accents he attempts to win Opinions favor, and by that redeem VVhat former guilt had lost in her esteem. Contemn'd with such a look as Princes cast On over-bold usurpers, he is past The first encounter of her eye, and she Turn'd in disdain to shew her great soul free From low submission, by which fir'd into A sullen anger, he resolves to mew The Royal Eaglet, until freedom grow A favor whose fair streams might overflow
Those barren fields of indesert, in which His fortune pines, lest this fair prize inrich The cursed soil, and on its surface place The long abstracted beams of princely grace. She to the narrow confires of a room Restrain'd to let his rufl'd thoughts resume Their calm composure (counsels throne) he goes Aside, and on that doubtfull text bestows The clearest comment of his judgement, yet Falls short of truth, and must contented sit To know her there, though not the accident Which from her fathers glorious Court had sent Her so ill guarded; but referring that To times discovery, he transported at What was a truth confirm'd, within the wide Arms of his hope, grasps, what aspiring pride Or lusts loose Rhet'rick, when youths rigrous fire Beauty hath kindled, prompts him to desire. Yet by two sev'ral paths to tread that way His crime's dark roads, Lust and Ambition lay, The poor Florenza, that long since had been The trembling object of the baser sin, To make his slie access to either free From th' others thoughts, must from her Lady be In this dark storm remov'd, he fearing less That counsel aiding vertue in distress,
Though wanting strength the battel to maintain, Might countermine the engine of his brain. To this sad separation leaving them Whom innocence had licenc'd to condemn Fortunes harsh discipline, Almanzor goes Fates dark enigma's, by the help of those That took her to unvail, but 'twas a work Too full of subtil mysterie, a Turk Her brave Defender, by those garments which Rash fear had onely refled to enrich Nice inquisition seem'd, by which betray'd To dark mistakes, his policy obey'd Domestick counsels, and by subtil spies Whose ears were more officious then their eyes, Soon from the lovesick Ladies close complaints His wiser knowledge with their cause acquaints. The End of the First Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO II. The Argument. I. From all the hopes of Love and Libertie O'erwhelm'd in the vast Ocean of her grief, The wretched Princess is constrain'd to be A Prisoner to her youths first dreadfull thief. II. The curs'd Almanzor, in whose dismal Cell She comments on the various eats of grief In every form, till from the tip of Hell, When seeming darkest, just Heav'n sent relief. DIstracted in the agony of Love Pharonnida, whose sad complaints did prove Her sorrows true Interpreters, had made Argalia's name, wrapt up in sighs invade
The ears of an unseen Informer, whence Almanzor's thoughts, deliver'd from suspence, Shake off their doubtfull dress of fears, and teach Hypocrisie by paths untrod to reach The Apex of his hopes. What not the fear Of ills, whilst her own interest did appear The onely sharer, could perform, he now Presumes affection to her Friend would bow With low submission, if by that she might Aid his dim Stars with a reserve of light. With frequent visits, which on sins dark Text Wrought a fair gloss, Almanzor oft had vext The calmer passions of the Princess in To rufled anger; but when all could win No entrance on her favor, fury tries A harsher corrosive, stern power denies Her even of those poor narrow comforts which Her souls dark region, that was onely rich In sorrows sables, could possess. Withdrew Were all those slippery Parasites that knew To her no pity, but what did reflect The rayes o'th Tyrants favor, whose neglect Taught them the Lesson of disdain, whilst she Her practic'd soul trained in humility. Pensive as an unpractic'd Convert in A Bath of tears, she shadow'd lies within
The unfrequented room, a curtain bed Her close retreat, till Lights fair Angel fled The swarthy Region. But whilst here she lies Like a dark lanthorn that in black disguise Circles imprisoned Light — Grief from the sullen world conceal'd to turn The troubled stream, as if the silent urn Of some dead friend to private sorrow had Summon'd her thither, enter'd was a sad And sober Matron, in her hands she bore A light whose feeble rayes could scarce restore The sick successor of the day unto A cheerfull smile. Sad Pilgrims that renew Acquaintance with their better Angels by Harsh penitence, have of humility Less in their looks then she, her habit shew'd Like costly ruins that for fashion ow'd To elder pride, in whose reversion she Appear'd the noble choice of charitie. This shadow of religious vertue drawn Near her disordered bed, a sickly dawn Of light breaks through the Princess clouded eyes To meet the welcom object, the disguise Of sorrow, which at first appearance sate Fixt on her brow, a partner of her fate Making her seem; nor was the fancy crush'd I'th infancy of faith, fair truth first blush'd
For verbal crimes, near to the bed reposed Where the sad Lady lay, she thus disclosed Her cause of entrance. Cease (fair stranger) to Monopolize a sorrow which, not you Here share alone; pitty instructed by Experience in the rules of misery Hath brought me from complaining of my own To comfort thine; this Castle once hath known Me for its Mistriss, though it now behold Me (in the dress of poverty grown old) Despis'd and poor, the scorn of those that were Nurs'd into life by my indulgent care. This in her tears o'erflowing language spoke Perswades the pensive Princess to revoke Deprav'd opinions doom, confessing she Wedded not grief to singularitie. But comfort in the julip of her words Was scarce dissolv'd, e're a reply affords Conceiv'd requital, striving to prevent The (oft more forward) thanks. Rise to content, Fair soul, she cries, be but so wise to let Sick passion die with just neglect, I'll set Thy dropt Stars in their orbs again; I have (Forc'd by command) a late attendance gave Unto a wounded stranger that remains Within this Castle in the heavy chains
Of cruel bondage, from whose weight unless Your Love redeem him, dark forgetfulness Will draw the curtains of the grave about His dull mortality, and the sick doubt Of hope resolve in death, this evening I Ore heard his heavy doom, from which to fly He hath no refuge but your mercy, which Strip'd of light passion, must be cloth'd in rich But graver robes of reason, when it sits In counsel how to reconcile the fits Of feverish love, when being most propense To passions heat, a frost of abstinence Benums it to a Lethargy. In brief, 'Tis he whose prosperous tyranny the chief Command within this castle gave, that in His swift destruction doth attempt to win Free passage to enjoying you, then prove He friend to him that begs you to change love For now more usefull pity, and so save A life that must no longer live to crave, If now deny'd. This Ring (with that presents A jewel, that when loves first elements The harmony of faith united, she Gave to confirm her vows) he sends to be A note that he denies what e'er was made Authentick, when your mixt vows did invade
Unwilling Heaven, which in your sufferance shews We may intend, but wiser powers dispose. Pharonnida, whose fears confirm'd did need No more to wound a fancy that did bleed At all the springs of passion, being by The fatal Present taught whose liberty Her Loves exchange must purchase, with a sad Reverse o'th eye beholding it, unclad Her sorrow thus: And did, oh did this come By thy commands, Argalia! no, by some Unworthy hand thou'rt rob'd of it, I know Thou sooner wouldst be tempted to let go Reliques of thy protecting Saint: Oh, cease What e'er you are, to wrong him, the calm peace He wears t' encounter death in, cannot be Scatter'd by any storm of fear: would he That hath affronted death in every shape Of horror, tamely yield unto the rape Of 's Virgin honor, and not stand the shock Of a base Tyrants anger; but I mock My hopes with vain fantasms, 'tis the love He bears to me carries his fear above The orb of his own noble temper, to An unknown world of passions, in whose new Regions ambitious grown, it scorns to fall Back to its Center, Reason, whither all
The lines of action until now did bend From's souls circumference; yet know his end If doom'd unto this cursed place, shall tell The bloody Tyrant that my passing bell Tolls in his dying groans, and will e're long Ring out in death, if sorrow when grown strong As fate, can raise the strokes of grief above The strength of nature; which if not, yet love Will finde a passage where our souls shall rest In an eternal union, whilst opprest With horror he, by whose command he dies, Falls to th' infernal pow'rs a Sacrifice If that your pitty were no ficton, to Betray my feeble passions, and undo The knots of resolution, tell my Friend, I live but to die his, and will attend Him with my pray'rs (those verbal angels) till His soul's on th' wing, then follow him, and fill Those blanks our Fate left in the lines of life Up with eternal bliss, where no harsh strife Of a dissenting Parent shall destroy The blooming springs of our conjugal joy. Vext by this brave display of fortitude To sullen anger, with a haste more rude Then bold intrusions, lusts slie advocate, Forsakes her seat, and though affronts too late
Came to create a blush, yet passion had Her cheeks in red revenges livery clad; Her eyes like Saturn's in the house of death, Heavy with ills to come, her tainted breath Scatt'ring infectious murmurs, with a look Oblique and deadly, the curs'd Hag forsook That ebbon cabinet of grief, and hastes To tell Almanzor how his passion wastes More spirits in perswasions hectique, then If power had quench'd ambitions fever when 'Twas first inflam'd with hope, whose cordials prove Oft slow as opiates in the heat of love. This, with a heat that spoild digestion, by The angry Tyrant heard, rage did unty The curles of passion, whose soft trammels had Crisp'd smooth hypocrisie, from which unclad Disvellop'd nature shews her unfil'd dress Rough as an angry friend, by no distress Of beauty to be calm'd, since slie deceit Vertue had now unmask'd, no candid bait Conceals his thoughts, which soon in publick shews From what black Sea those mists of passion rose. Dayes sepulchre, the ebbon arched night Was rais'd above the battlements of light; The frenzy'd worlds allaying opiate, sleep, Oretaking action, did in silence steep
The various fruits of labor, and from thence Recovers what pays for her times expence. In which slow calm, whilst half the drowsie earth Lay in the shade of nature, to give birth Unto the burthen of sick fancy, fear, Groans, deep as deaths alarms, through her ear Fly toward the throne of Reason, to inform The pensive Princess, that the last great storm Of fate was now descending, beyond which Her eyes (orewhelm'd in sorrow) must inrich Their orbs with love no more; but in the dawn Of Life behold her Friends destruction drawn, Since threatn'd danger sad assurance gives In those deep groans he now but dying lives. More swiftly to destroy the falling leaves Of blasted hope, with horror she receives By a convey of wearied light, that stroke Through rusty grates, intelligence which shoke The strength of fortitude, there was a room Deep and obscure, where in a heavy gloom The unstirr'd air in such a darkness dwelt As mask'd Egyptians from Heavens vengeance felt, Till by the strugling rayes of a faint lamp Forc'd to retreat, and the quicksilver damp Shed on the sweaty walls, which hid within That glitt'ring vail, worn figures that had been
The hieroglyphick epitaphs of those Which charity did to the earth dispose In friendships last of Legacies, except What is to cure loose fames diseases kept. Here 'mongst the ruines of mortality, In blood difigur'd, she beholds one lie Who though disguis'd in death's approach, appears By's habit (that confirmer of her fears) Her gentle Love, alone, and helpless in The grasp of death, striving in vain to win The field from that grim Tyrant, who had now Embalm'd him in his blood, and did allow Him no more spirits, but what in that strife Serv'd to groan out the Epilogue of life And then depart natures cold stage, to be Suck'd up from time into eternitie. When thus the ever lasting silence had Lock'd up his voice, and death's rude hand unclad His hovering soul, whose elemental dress Is left to dust and dark forgetfulness When natures lamps being snuft to death, he lay A night-piec'd draught of once well-modell'd clay; With such a silent pace as witches use To tread ore graves when their black arts abuse Their cold inhabitants, his murtherers were Entred the vault, from the stain'd floor to bear The cold stiff coarse, which having softly laid In's doom-days bed, unto the royal Maid,
Whose beauty in this agony defac'd Griefs emblem sate, with eager speed they haste. Either a guilty shame, or fear to be Converted by her forms divinity, Made them chuse darkness for protection, in Whose hideous shade, she of her self unseen Is hurried thence unto that dreadfull place Where he intomb'd lay, whom she must imbrace In death's dark lodgings, and e'er life was fled Remain a sad Companion of the dead, Confining beauty in youth's glorious bloom To the black prison of a dismal tomb, Where fast inclos'd, Earth's fairest blossom must Unnaturally be planted in the dust, Where life's bright Star, Heav'ns glorious influence, Her soul in labor with the slow suspence Of lingring torments must expecting lie Till famine Natures ligatures untie. And can, oh, can we ever hope to save Her that's in life a Tenant to the Grave! Can ought redeem one that already lies Within the Bed of Death, whose hot lust fries In the enjoyment of all beauties that The aged World e'er had to wonder at; To feed whose riot, the well temper'd blood, That sanguine youth's smooth cheek, mixt with a flood Of harsh distemperatures, o'erflows and brings Some to their lodgings on the flaming wings
Of speedy feavers, whilst the others creep On slow consumptions, millions from the steep And dangerous precipice of war: Some in A stream of their own humors that have bin Swell'd to a dropsie, being even prest to death By their own weight, whilst others part with breath From bodies worn so thin, they seem'd to be Grown near the souls invisibilitie. But whither strayes our fancy? have we left The wofull Lady in a tomb bereft Of all society, and shall I let My wandring pen forsake her? such a debt Would banckrupt pity. Th' undistinguish'd day Whose new-born light did but e'en then display Its dewy wings, when first she was confin'd To the dark tomb, was now grown almost blind With age, when thus through fates black curtin broke Unlook'd for light, that darkness which did choake All passages by which the thin air held Commerce with neigboring rooms, being now ex∣pel'd By the dim tapers glimmering beams let fall Part of the rayes through an old ruin'd wall That fenc'd an ugly dungeon, where the night Dwelt safe as in the Center; by the fight Of which unlook'd for guest some prisoners who Had there been stay'd, even till despairing to Be ere releas'd, in eager fury tries To force their way, where their directing eyes
Led by the light should guide them, come at length, Where with times burden tir'd the buildings strength Losing its first firm union was divorc'd With gaping clefts, an easie strength inforc'd Those feeble guards; but come into the room Where ore the living Ladies sable tomb Hung the directing light, they there in vain For further passage seeking, were again To the black dungeon, horrors dismal seat, In sad despair making their slow retreat. Now neer departing, a deep dolefull groan Revers'd their eyes, amazement almost grown To stupefaction stays them, whilst they hear New sighs confirm their wonder, not their fear; Till thus Euriolus, whose bold look spoke The braver soul, the dismal silence broke. What ere thou art that hoverest here within This gloomy shadow, speak what wrong hath bin Thy troubl'd Ghost's tormenter, art thou fled From wo to stir the dust o'th' peacefull dead? Or com'st from sacred shadows to lament Some friends dead coarse, which this dark Tenement Hath lodg'd in dust. The trembling Lady hearing A humane voice again, and now not fearing Th' approaches of a greater danger, cries, What ere you are, fear moks your faith, here lies A wofull wretch intmb'd alive, that nere Must look on light again, my spirit were
Blest if resolv'd to air, but here it must A sad companion in the silent dust To Loath'd corruption be, until the pale Approaching Fiend, harsh famine, shall exhale In dews of blood the purple moisture, that Fed life's fresh springs; but now shall tremble at My dolefull story, 'tis enough that fate Hath for this tomb exchang'd a throne of state. To active pity stirr'd, the valiant friends Attempt her rescue, but their labor ends In fruitless toyles, the ponderous marble lies With too much weight to let the weak supplies Of humane strength remov't, which whilst they tride To weary sweats, kinde fortune lends this guide To their mask'd vertue; the informing ear Proclaims approaching steps, which usher'd fear Into Ismander's brest; but his brave friend (The bold Euriolus) resolv'd to end By death or victory their bondage, goes Near to the gate, where soon were entred those Which in Pharonnida's restraint had bin The active engines of that hateful sin, With them, that Hag whose curst invention had Revenge in such an uncouth dressing clad. Whilst her Ismander seis'd, and with a charm Of nimble strength commands the active arm Of fierce Euriolus, directed by Victorious valor purchac'd liberty
By strokes whose weight to dark destruction sunk His worthless foes, and sent their pale souls drunk With innocent blood stagg'ring from earth, to be Maskt in the desarts of eternitie. This being beheld by her whose hopes of life With them departed, she concludes the strife Of inquisition by directing to An engine which but toucht would soon undo That knot which puzzl'd all their strength, and give The captive Princess hopes again to live Within the reach of light, whose beams whilst she Unfolds her eyes (those dazl'd stars) to see, Dark misty wonder in a cloud orespread His faith that rais'd her from that gloomy bed: Amaz'd Euriolus, whose zeal-guided eyes Soon knows the Princess through griefs dark disguise, Could his inflam'd devotion into one Great blast of praises be made up, t'had gone Toward heavenly bowers on the expanded wings Of his exalted joy, nor are the springs Of life less rais'd with wonder in the brest Of's royal Mistress, whose free soul exprest As much of joy as in her clouded fate With reason at the helm of action sate. Here had they maskt in mutual wonder stay'd T'unriddle fate, had not wise Fear obey'd Reasons grave dictates, and with eager speed Urge their departure, for whose guide they need
No more but her directions, who then lay Taught by the fear of vengeance to obay Their just demands, by whom inform'd of all That might within the Castles circuit fall With weights of danger, and taught how to free Confin'd Florenza, to meet libertie, They march in triumph, leaving none to take Possession there, but her whose guilt would make The torment just, though there constrain'd to dwell Till death prepar'd her for a larger hell. Whilst sleeps guards doubled by intemprance raign'd Within the walls, with happy speed they gain'd The Castles utmost ward, and furnisht there With such choise horses as provided were For th'Outlaws next days scouts; A glad adieu Of their loath'd jail they take: Ismander knew Each obscure way that in their secret flight Might safety promise; so that sullen night Could not obstruct their passage, though through ways So full of dark meanders, not the days Light could assist a stranger, ere the dawn O'th' wakeful morn had spread her vails of lawn Ore the fair Virgins of the Spring, there past That silvan labyrinth, and with that had cast Their greatest terror off, and taught their eyes The welcom joys of liberty to prize. And now the spangled squadrons of the night Encountring beams had lost the field to light,
The morning proud in beauty grown, whilst they With chearful speed past on the levell'd way By solitude secure, of all unseen Save early Laborers that resided in Dispers'd poor cottages, by whom they'r view'd With humble reverence, such as did delude Sharp-ey'd suspition, they are now drawn near Ismanders palace, whose fair towers appear Above the groves, whose green enamel lent The neighboring hills their prospects ornament. A River whose unwearied bounty brings The hourly tribute of a thousand Springs From several fragrant vallies here, as grown So rich, she now strove to preserve her own Streams from the all-devouring Sea, did glide Betwixt two hills which nature did divide To entertain the smiling Nymph, till to An entrance where her silver-eye did view A wealthy vale she come, a vale in which All fruitful pleasures did content enrich; Where all so much deserv'd the name of best, Ech took a part seem'd to excell the rest. Rounded with spacious meads, here scatter'd stood Fair Country-farms, whose happy neighborhood, Though not so near as justling Palaces Which trouble Cities, yet had more to please By a community of goodness in That separation. Natures hand had been
To all too liberal, to let any want The treasures of a free inhabitant, Each in his own unrack'd inheritance Where born expir'd, not striving to advance Their levell'd fortunes to a loftier pitch Then what first stil'd them honest, after rich; Sober and sweet their lives, in all things blest Which harmless Nature living unopprest With surfeits did require: Their own Flocks bred Their homespun garments, and on that they fed Which from their Fields or Dairies plenteous store Had fresh supplies: what fortune lent them more Then an indifferent mean, was sent to be The harbingers of hospitalitie. Fair Virgins in their youths fresh April drest, Courted by amorous Swains, were unopprest By dark suspition, Ages sullen spies, Whose spleen would have the envious counted wise. Love was religious here, and for to aw Their wilder passions, conscience was their law. More to compleat this rural happiness, They were protected from the harsh distress Of long-wing'd power by the blest neighborhood Of brave Ismander, whose known greatness stood Not to eclipse their humble states, although It shadowed them when injur'd power did grow To persecution, by which means he prov'd Not fear'd for greatness, but for goodness lov'd.
Which gentle passion his unhappy loss Had sowr'd to grief, and made their joy their cross. But now their antidote approaches, he From heavy bondage is return'd to be Their joyful wonder, at his Palace gate Being now arriv'd, his Palace that of late With's absence dimm'd in her most beauteous age Stood more neglected then a Hermitage Or sacred buildings, when the sinful times To persecution aggravate their crimes. But being enter'd, sadder objects took Those outside wonders off, each servants look Spoke him a sullen mourner, grave and sad, Their sober carriage, in no liveries clad But doleful sable, all their acts like those Of weeping wives, when they to th' grave dispose Their youthful husbands; yet all these were but Imperfect shadows of a sorrow, put In distant landskip, when to trial brought Near his fair Ammida's, whose grief had sought As dark a region for her sad retreat As desperate grief ere made pale sorrows seat In sacred temples the neglected lamp So wastes its oil, when Heresies do cramp Religions beams, with such a heavy look Monarchs depos'd behold themselves forsook By those that flatter'd greatness, shut from all Those glorious objects of the world that call
Our souls in admiration forth, her time Being spent in grief, made life but Natures crime. The rough disguise of time assisted by The meager gripe of harsh captivity, Had now expung'd those characters by which Ismander once was known, and even the rich In love and duty rendred strangers to Their honor'd Master, from whose serious view Neglective grief withdraws them, so that he An unknown Pilgrim might have gone to be Theirs and his own afflictor, had that fear Not thus been cur'd▪ A Spaniel being of dear Esteem to Ammida, since the delight Of her Ismander once, come to the sight Of's first protector, stays not till a call Invites acquaintance, but preventing all The guides of reason by the sleights of sense, Fawning on's Master, checks th' intelligence Of's more forgetful followers, which being seen By an old servant, whose firm youth had been Spun out amongst that family, till by Grave age surpris'd, it led his sober eye To stricter observations, such as brought Him near to truth, and on contracted thought Rais'd a belief, which though it durst conclude Nought on the dark text; yet i'th' magnitude Of hope exalted by his joy he hastes To's mourning Mistress, tells her that she wastes
Each minute more she spends in grief, if he Dares trust his eyes t'inform his memorie. Contracted spirits starting from the heart Of doubtful Ammida, to every part Post through the troubl'd blood, a combat fought Betwixt pale fear and sanguine hope, had oft Won and lost battails in her cheeks, whilst she Leaving her sullen train, did haste to see Those new come guests: But the first enterview Unmasks Ismander, wing'd with love she flew To his imbraces; 'twas no faint disguise Of a course habit could betray those eyes Into mistakes, that for directors had Loves powerful optiques, Nuptial joys unclad In all their naked beauties, no delight So full of pleasure, the first active night Being but a busie and laborious dream Compar'd with this, this, that had swell'd the stream Of joy to fainting surfeits, whose hot strife Had overflow'd the crimson-sea of life, If not restrain'd by a desire to keep What each had lost in the eternal sleep. But now broke through the epileptique mist Of amorous rapture, rallied spirits twist Again their optique cordage, whose mixt beams Now separate, and on collateral streams Disperst expressions of affection bore To each congratulating friend that wore
Not out those favors with neglect, but by A speedy, though unpractick sympathie Met their full tide of bliss; glad fame which brings Truths messages upon her silver-wings, In private whisper hovers for a while Within the palace, every servants smile Invites a new spectator, who from thence (Proud to be author of intelligence So welcom) hastes till knowledge rang'd through all Diffusive joy made epidemical: For though that noble family alone Afforded pleasure a triumphant throne, Yet frolick mirth did find a residence In every neighbors bosom; they dispence With their allegiance to their labor, and Revel in lusty cups, the brown bowls stand With Amber-liquor fill'd, whose fruitful tears Dropt lov'd Ismander's health, till it appears In sanguine tincture on their cheeks: All now Had, if not calm'd their passions, smooth'd a brow To temporize with pleasure. The sad story Of his own fortune, and that Ages glory, Pharonnida, whilst each attentive dwells On expectation, brave Ismander tells. The End of the Second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO III. The Argument. I. From the sad consort of her silent grief The Princess doth with pleasing wonder hear Poor Vanlore's fate, and the unjust relief Which his unworthy Father freed from fear. II. Whose hell-deep plots the dregs of avarice Had so defil'd, that whilst he seeks for aid, His subtlety mask'd on the road of vice, By his presum'd Assistant is betraid. COmposing time did now begin to slack The rain of mirth; exalted Joy shrunk back From Pleasures summer-solstice, and gave way For more domestick passions to obay An Oeconomick government, which brought Loose fancy on the wings of serious thought
Back to her sober home, in that to find Those several burthens that were left behind In the carier of mirth, amongst which number Pharonnida that had let sorrow slumber In the high room of joy, awakes again That clamorous elf, which she must entertain At Beauties cost: Yet in this dark retreat From Pleasures throne to Sorrows dismal seat She finds a sweet Copanion, one that had By fatal love oppos'd, with loss unclad Delight of all his summer-robes, to dress Her trembling soul in sables of distress. The sad Silvandra (for surviving fame Hath on record so character'd her name) Being sister to return'd Ismander, in This flourish of triumphant joy had bin So much eclips'd with grief, that oft her tears Dim'd Beauties rays, whilst through them she appears A fit Companion for the Princess to Twist those discourses with, whose mourning clue Led through the labyrinth of their lives. They oft In shades as secret as their closest thought With pensive paces meeting, sit and tell Stories so sad, that nought could parallel But Love, and Loss, a theam they both had bin By rigid power made hapless Students in. One eye-bright morning tempting them to take The start of time, soon as the Lark did wake,
Summons them from the Palace to the side Of a small Wood, whose bushy crest the pride Of all the flowry plains, they chose to be 'Gainst the invading sun their canopie. Repos'd beneath a full-grown tree that spread His trembling arms to shade their fragrant bed, They now are sate, where for a while they view The distant vale, whilst contemplation grew Pregnant with wonder, whose next prosp'rous birth Had been delight, had they not sent their mirth In sad exchange, whilst tears did usher in Silvandra's fate, who, weeping, did begin With such a look as did command belief, The late-past story of a present grief. In yonder fields (with that directs her eye To a black Fen, whose heavy earth did lie Low in a dark and dirty vale) is plac'd Amarus Castle, which though now defac'd More by the owners covetous neglect Then times rough strokes, that strength which did protect Once its inhabitants, being now but made Use of when want doth with weak prayers invade The gates, being thought sufficient if they keep The poor at bay, or whilst his stiff hindes sleep Their laboring beasts secure. But I alas Blush to discover that this Miser was Father to my dead Vanlore, and to her Whose living vertues kind heaven did confer
As blessings on my brother; but the sun Ne'r saw two sweeter streams of vertue run From such a bitter fountain. This accurst And wretched man, so hated, that he durst Scarce look abroad, fearing oppression would Be paid with vengeance, if he ever should Fall into th' hand's of those whose faces he Grownd with extortion, till the injury Fear cloath'd like justice, ventring once to view A Mannor whose intemperate Lord out-grew In debts the compass of a Bond, besides His common guard of Clowns, fellows whose hides Serv'd for defensive armor, he commands His sons attendance, who since from his hands Rack'd Tenants hop'd for ease, he thought that they Would for that hope with reverent duty pay. But vain mistakes betray opinion to A fatal precipice, which they might view I'th objects of each glance; one side affords Large plains, whose flock's, the wealth of several lords By him contracted, but the spoils appears Of beggar'd Orphans, pickl'd in their tears; Farms for whose loss poor widows wept, and fields Which being confin'd to strict inclosure, yields To his cram'd chests the starving poor mans food, For private ends robbing their publick good, With guilt inclos'd those wayes which now ha brought Him by some cottages who honors bought
Poor livelihoods at a laborious rate From his rack'd lands, for which pursuing hate Now follows him in curses; for in that They yet take vengeance, till arriving at The thicker peopl'd Villages, where more bold By number made, the fire of hate takes hold On clamarous women, whose vext husbands thirst I'th' fever of revenge, to these when first They kindled had the flame, swiftly succeeds More active men, such, as resolv'd their deeds (Spight of restrictive law) should set them free From the oppressor of their liberty. His son (the noble Vanlore) to appease The dangerous fury of this rash disease, Spends all his stock of Rhetorick, but in Fruitless attempts. His rustick guard had bin At the first onset scatter'd, and were now Posting for fafety, whilst his son, taught how By frequent injuries to entertain Angers unusual guests, shews it in vain, Though brave attempts of valor, by whose high Unhappy flame, whilst circling foes did die Unworthy hecatombs for him, at length Engag'd him had beyond the power of strength, Though back'd by fortune to redeem; which when Beheld by those whose characters of men In rage was lost, they wildly persecute Revenge, till life, natures hurmonious fruit,
Was blasted to untimely death. And here Her fatal story in its full carier, The memory of him, who di'd to be The peoples curse, and crime of destinie Grief did obstruct, whilst liquid passion feeds Her chrystal springs, which stopt, she thus proceeds, His brave defender now retreating to The rode of death, whilst he did vainly sue For undeserv'd remorse, Amarus lies Their furies object, in whose wild disguise Whilst giddy clouds of dark amazement dwell, Ore his dim eyes th' exalted tumult fell In a black storm of danger, in whose shade They drag him thence, that fury being made Wise by delays, might study torments great As was their rage; but in their wild retreat They thus are stopt: A wandring Knight that near The place approach'd, directed by his ear How to inform his eye, arrives to see The wretched trophies of this victory, A dying son, whose latest beams of light Through deaths dim opticks bids the world good∣night, With looks that did so black a sorrow lim He frown'd on earth, though heaven did smile on him Hurri'd from thence by unrelenting hate, A living father of more wofull fate. Pity (that brave allay of manly heat) Perswades the noble stranger to intreat
A parle with rage, which being deny'd he then Attempts to force; and since their ablest men Were wounded in the former conflict, soon Successfull proves, like mists i'th pride of noon Being hudl'd into hurtless clouds they flye Before his fury, till from reach o'th eye Shrunk to the woods protection, where whilst each With such a fear as sanguine guilt did teach The worlds first murtherer, seeks for safety, he Retreating leaves the scatter'd herd to be Their own afflictors, and hastes thence to finde Him to whom fortune prov'd so strangely kinde In his approach, as by his sword to be When hope lost anchor, blest with liberty. Come to the place where old Amarus lay With fear so startl'd, that he durst betray Life through no motion, yet he's follow'd by That train of Cowards, which though they did fly The danger, when they saw their foes pursu'd On the reward, (the victory) intrude, Whose easie spoils (those invitations to A Cowards daring) such a distance drew Them from their homes, that they with labor were Recall'd from rifling enemies to beare Their feeble Masters off, Amarus living As weak with fear as Vanlore was with dying. Before the black obstructions of the night Did interpose, they were arriv'd i'th sight
O'th Castles ruin'd walls, a place whose hew, Uncouth and wild, banish'd delight into Uncomly profit, and at distance gives A sad assurance that its honor lives By men so hated, and by heaven unblest, As he enjoy'd not what he there possest. Come to the front o'th house, whose dirt sorbid A cleanly entrance, he sees pavements hid With heaps of rubbish, times slow hand let fall From the neglected ruines of the wall, Green Arbors, pleasant Groves, all which were now Swiftly dismantling to make way for th' plow; Onely his Barns, preservers of that store Detain'd with curses from the pining poore, Their upper garments of warm thatch did weare So thick to keep them dry, whilst thin and bare E'en his own lodging stood; the Hall first built To have that wealth, which he in sparing spilt, Spent there in hospitality, nere by More heat warm'd then a candle gave, did lie Moulded with lazy damps, the wall oregrown With moss and weeds, unhaunted, and alone The empty tables stood, for never Guess Come there, except thin Bankrupts whom distress Spurr'd on with sharp necessity to crave Forbearing moneths, which he, when brib'd forgave. Hence (by a rude domestick led) he goes To veiw the cellar, where like distant foes
Or buildings in a new Plantation stand The distant Barrels, yet from all command But his own keys exempted. To bestow A welcom on him, which he ne'r did shew To man before; led by a rusty slave, Whose iron limbs ratling in leather gave Alarums to the half-starv'd Rats; he here Is by Amarus visited, whose feare That place should too much suffer, soon from thence Sounds a retreat to supper, where th'expence Became a Usurers purse: yet what was by Sparing defective, neatness did supply: A vertue where repining penurie Prepares, unusual; but he soon did see Whence it proceeds, the sad sweet Ammida Whom shame and grief attempted to withdraw From publick view, was by her fathers call To crown that entertainment brought, whose all Was else so bad, it the first visit might Repented make, not to the next invite. Here, with afflicted patience, he had spent Some few, but tedious days, whose slow extent Behind his wishes flagg'd, ere he had seen Vanlore interr'd, whose obsequies had been In secret huddl'd up, but then prepares To take his leave, when adverse fate that shares Double with mans intentions, in the tart Of's full resolves opposing, claims her part
By harsh command, a dangerous Fever that Threatned destruction ere arriving at Its distant crisis, and on flaming wings Posts through the blood, whose mass infected brings Deaths banners near the Fort of life, which in Acute distempers it attempts to win From Natures guards, had not the hot assault By youth sustain'd made deaths black army halt Whilst marching to the grave, the swift disease Like a proud foe repulst, forc'd to give ease By slow retreats; yet of those cruel wars Left long remaining bloodless characters. But ere the weak Euriolus (for he This hapless stranger was) again could be By strength supported, base Amarus, who Could think no more then priceless thanks was due For all his dangerous pains, more beastly rude Then untam'd Indians, basely did exclude That noble guest; which being with sorrow seen By Ammida, whose prayers and tears had been His helpless advocates, she gives in charge To her Ismander, that till time enlarge Her then restrain'd desires, he entertain Her desolate and wandring friend: Nor vain Were these commands, his entertainment being Such as observant Love thought best agreeing To her desires. But here not long he stayed Ere Fortune, prompted by his wit, obeyed
That artfull Mistris, and reward obtains By fine imposture for firm vertues pains. The gout (that common curse of slothfull wealth) With frequent pain had long impair'd the health Of old Amarus, who, though else to all Griping as that, for ease was liberal. From practic'd physick, to the patients curse, Poor pratling women, or impostors worse Slie Mountebanks, whose empty impudence Do frequent murthers under healths pretence, He all had tried, yet found he must endure What though some eas'd, none perfectly could cure. Oft had his judgement, purse, and patience bin Abus'd by cheats, yet still defective in The choice of men: which error known unto My brother and Euriolus, they drew Their platform thus: Euriolus clad in An antick dress, which shew'd as he had bin Physitian to the great Mogol, first by Ismander prais'd at distance, doth apply Himself unto Amarus, where t'inhance The price of's art, he first applauds the chance That had from distant Regions thither brought Him to eclipse their glory, who had sought For't in his cure before, then seconds that With larger promises; which tickled at Amarus vies with his, threatning to break His iron chests, and make those idols speak
His gratitude, though lock'd with conscience they To his own clamorous wants had silent lay. Some common medicines, which the people prize 'Cause from their knowledg vail'd in slight disguise, Apply'd to's pain, and those assisted by Opinion, whose best antidotes supply The weak defects of art, he soon attains So much of health, that now his greatest pains Had been th' ingag'd reward, had he not bin By future hopes kept from ingratefull sin So far, that in performing action he Exceeds his passions prodigalitie, Large promises, with such performance, that Whilst his deluders smile, and wonder at, Thus speaks its dark orginal; To shew Euriolus how fortune did out-grow Desert in his estate, he was one day From th' Castle walls taking a pleas'd survay, Of spacious fields, whose soils made fertile by Luxurious art, in rich variety Still youthfull nature cloath'd, which whilst he views An old suspition thus his tongue renews. How blest, my worthy friend, how blest had I Been in my youths laborious industry T' have seen a son possest of this! but now A daughters match, a stranger must endow With what I've toil'd to get, and what is more My torment, one that being betroth'd before
My sons decease, wants an estate to make Her marriage blest; but knew I how to shake This Swagg'rer off, there lives not far from hence One that to match her to were worth th' expence Of my estate, his name is Dargonel, A wary Lad, who though his land do swell Each day with new additions, yet still lives Sparing and close, takes heed to whom he gives Or whom he lends, except on mortgage, by Whose strength it may securely multiply. This worthy Gentleman, with wise foresight Beholding what an object of delight Our link'd estates would be, hath since I lost My heir, been in's intention onely crost By this Ismander, whom, though I confess A braver man, yet since a fortune less, Ne'r must have my consent; onely since by Her contract I have lost the liberty Of second choice, unless I vainly draw My self in danger o'th ore-busie Law, I want some sound advice that might inform Me how to rid him, yet not stand a storm Broke from his rage, although my daughter love Him more then health, I shall command above Her feeble passions, if you dare impart So much of aid from your almighty art As to remove this remora; and here He stopp'd, yet lets a silent guilt appear
In looks that shew'd what else the theam affords He'd have conceiv'd, as being too foul for words. Which seen by him whose active wit grw strong In friendships cause, as loath to torture long His expectations, thus their stream he stayes With what at once both comforts and betrayes. Raise up your spirits, my blest Patron, to Sublime content, Heav'n sent me to renew Your souls harmonious peace; that dreadfull toy Of conscience wisely wav'd, you may enjoy Uninterrupted hopes: yet since we must Be still most wary where we're most unjust, Lets not be rash; swift things are oft unsure, Whilst moles through death's dark angles creep se∣cure. Then since it's full of danger to remove Betroth'd Ismander, whilst his publick love By your consent rais'd to assurance, may A granted interest claim; first let us stay His fury, and the peoples censures by A nuptial knot, whose links we will unty Ere the first night confirms the hallow'd band, By wayes so secret, that death's skilfull hand Shall work unknown to fate, and render you To the deluded worlds more publick view A real mourner, whilst your curtain'd thought Triumphs to be from strict engagements brought. Besides the vailing of our dark designe Like vertue thus, this plot will sink a Mine
Whose wealthy womb in ample jointure will Bring much of dead Ismanders state to fill The vast desire of wealth. This being done, I with prevailing philters will outrun Sorrows black Bark, which whilst it lies at drift, I'll so renew her mirth, no sigh shall lift Its heavy sails, which in a calm neglect Shall lie forgot; whilst what's not now respect To Dargonel, shall soon grow up to be Like Natures undiscovered sympathie, A love so swift, so secret, all shall pause At its effects, whilst they admire the cause. This by Amarus, with belief▪ which grew Into applause, heard ou, he doth renew With large additions what h'had promis'd in His first attempts: Then hasting to begin The tragick scene which must in triumph be Usher'd to light, his known deformitie Of wretched baseness for a while he lays Aside, and by a liberal mirth betrays Approaching joy, which since incited by His wishes, soon lifts Hymens torches high As their exalted hopes. The happy Pair Dear to indulgent heaven, with Omens fair As were their youthful Paranimphs, had bin I'th' hallowed Temple taught without a sin To taste the fruits of Paradice; and now The time when tedious custom did allow
A wisht retirement, come, preparing are To beautifie their beds, whence that bright star Whose evenings blush did please the gazers eyes, Eclips'd in sorrow is ordain'd to rise. But such whose superficial vail opprest Only her friends, whose knowledge were not blest With the design which to our proscript Lovers Euriolus with timely zeal discovers. The morning opens, and the wakened Bride By light and friends surpris'd, attempts to hide Her bashful beauty, till their hands withdrew The curtains, which betraid unto their view Ismander cold and stiff: which horrid sight Met where they look'd for objects of delight, At first a silent sad amazement spread Through all the room, till Fears pale army fled In sad assurance, Sorrows next hot charge Began in shrieks, whose terror did enlarge Infectious grief, till like an ugly cloud That cramps the beauties of the day, grown proud In her black empire, Hymens tapors she Changes to funeral brands, and from that tree That shadows graves, puls branches, which being wet In tears, are where Loves mirtles flourisht set. Their nuptial himns thus turn'd to dirges, all In sad exchange let cloudy sable fall Ore pleasures purple-robes, whilst from that bed Whence Love opprest, seem'd to their sorrow fled
To death for refuge, sadly they attend To th' last of homes, his tomb, their sleeping friend, Who there with all the hallowed rights that do Betray surviving friendship, left unto Darkness and dust, they thence with sober pace Return, whilst shrowded near that dismal place Euriolus conceals himself, that so When sleep, whose soft excess is natures fo, Hath spent her stupefactive opiates, he Might ready to his friends assistance be. And now that minute come, which to comply With Arts sure rules, gives Nature leave t'unty Sleeps powerful ligatures, his Pulses beat The Floods revelly, from whose dark retreat The spirits thronging in their active flight, His friend h'encounters with the early light; By whose assistance whilst the quiet earth Yet slept in nights black arms, before the birth O'th' morn, whose busie childhood might betray Their close design, Ismander takes his way Toward a distant friends, whose house he knew To be as secret as his love was true. There whilst conceal'd even from suspition, he In safety rests, Euriolus, to free Her fears fair Captive, Ammida, hastes back To old Amarus, who too rash to slack Sorrows black cordage by degrees that might Weaken mistrust, lets mirth taken open flight
Into suspected action, whilst he gives To Dargonel, who now his Darling lives, So free a welcom, that he in't might read If love could not for swift succession plead, Power should command; yet waves the exercise Of either, till his Empericks skill he tries: Who now return'd, ere Dargonel that lay Slow to attempt, since certain to betray, Had more then fac'd at distance, he pretends To close attempts of art, whose wisht for ends Ere their expecting faith had time to fear, In acts which rais'd their wonder did appear. Love, which by judgment rul'd, had made desert In her first choice the Climax to her heart, By which it slowly mov'd, now; as if swaid y heedless passion, seems to have betraid At one rash glance her heart, which now begins To break through Passions bashful cherubins, Spreading without a modest blush the light Of morning-beauty ore that hideous night Of all those dull deformities that dwell Like earths black damps ore cloudy Dargonel, Who being become an Antique in the Mask Of playful Love, grows proud, and scorns to ask Advice from sober thought, but lets conceit Perswade him how his worth had spread that bait Which slie Amarus who presum'd to know From whence that torrent of her Love did flow,
With a just doubt suspecting, strives to make His thoughts secure, ere Reason did oretake Passions inforc'd carier; Nor did his plot Want an indulgent hope, like dreams, forgot In the delights of day, his daughter shook Off Griefs black dress, and in a chearful look Promis'd approaching love, no more disguis'd Then serv'd to shew strict vertue how she pris'd Her only in applause, whose harmonie Still to preserve, she is resolv'd to be, If secret silence might with action dwell, Swift as his wish espous'd to Dargonel. More joy'd then fetter'd Captives in the year Of Jubile, Amarus did appear Proud with delight, in whose warm shine when's haste Had with officious diligence imbrac'd Euriolus, he waving all delays, To Dargonel the welcom news conveys; Who soon prepar'd for what so long had bin His hopes delight, to meet those joys within The sacred temple hastes: The place they chose For Hymen's Court, lest treacherous eyes disclose The Brides just blushes, was a Chappel where Devotion, when but a domestick care, Was by his houshold practis'd; for the time 'Twas ere the morn blusht to detect a crime. All thus prepar'd, the Priest conducting, they With sober pace, which gently might convey
Diseas'd Amarus in his chair, they to The Chappel haste, which now come near, as through Th' ancient room they pass, a sad deep groan Assaults their ears, which whilst with wonder grown Into disease they entertain, appears A sad confirmer of their doubtfull fears; Ismander whom but late before they had Follow'd to th' grave, his lively beauty clad I'th' upper garments of pale death: which sight The train avoiding by their speedy flight Except the willing Bride, behinde leave none But lame Amarus, who, his chair orethrown By his affrighted bearers, there must lie Expos'd to fear, which when attempts to flie, Through often strugling prov'd his labor vain, He groveling lies unseen to entertain. Thus far successfull blest Ismander thence Conveys his lovely Bride, whilst the expence Of time being all laid out on fear, by none He was observ'd; Amarus long alone Lying tormented with his passions, ere His frighted servants durst return to beare Their fainting Master of; but being at length, When greater numbers had confirm'd the strength Of fortitude, grown bold, entring again The room, which yet fear told them did retain The scent of brimstone, there they onely found Their trembling master, tumbling on the ground.
Horror, augmented by internal guilt Had in his conscience trepidations spilt: Both pray'rs and tears, which since heav'ns law they crost For humane passions in dispair were lost; Obscur'd in whose black mists, not daring to Unclose his eyes, fearing again the view Of that affrighting aparition, he Is hurried from that dreadfull place, to be Their mirth, whom he (for fiends mistaking) cries For mercy to, scarce trusting of his eyes, When they unfolded had, discover'd none But such whom long he'd for domesticks known. Yet to torment him more, before these fears Wholy forsake him, in his room appears Some officers, whose power made dreadfull by The dictates of supream authority As guilty of Ismander's death, arrest Him for his murtherer, by which change opprest More then before with fear, he, who now thought On nought but death, to a tribunal brought, Ere ask'd confesses that foul crime, for which He this just doom receives; since to inrich What had before wealths surfeit took, this sin Was chiefly acted, his estate, faln in To th' hands of justice, by the judge should be From hence dispos'd of, then from death to free His life, already forfeited, except Murther'd Ismander, whom he thought had slept
In's winding sheet, his hopeless Advocate Should there appear, in which unhappy state The wretch, now ready to depart, beholds This glorious change; Ismander first unfolds Himself, and her, who bound by natures laws, Implores his pardon ere they plead his cause, Which done, the Judge, that his lost wealth might be No cause of grief, unmasking, lets him see Euriolus, by whom, from th' worst of sin To liberal vertue he'd deluded bin. The End of the Third Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO IV. The Argument. I. Whilest we a while the pensive Lady eave Here a close Mourner for her rigid fate, Let's from the dark records of time receive The manner how Argalia wav'd the hate II. Of his malignant stars, which when they seem To threaten most, through that dark cloud did lead Him to a knowledge of such dear esteem, He his high birth did there distinctly read. FReed from the noise o'th' busie world, within A deep dark vale, whose silent shade had bin Religions vail, when blasted by the beams Of Persecution, far from the extreams Of solitude, or sweary labor, were Some few blest men whose choice made Heaven their care
Sequestred from the throngs of men to finde Those better joyes, calms of a peacefull minde. Yet though on this pacifick sea, their main Design was Heaven, that voyage did not restrain Knowledge of humane arts, which as they past They safely view'd, though there no anchor cast; Their better temper'd judgments counting that But hoodwink'd zeal, which blindly catches at The great Creators sacred will, without Knowing those works that will was spent about, Which being the climax to true judgement, we Behold stoop'd down to visibilitie In lowliest creatures, natures stock being nought But God in's image to our senses brought. In the fair evening of that fatal day, By whose meridian light Love did betray Ingag'd Argalia near to death, was one Of these (heav'ns happy Pensioners) alone Walking amongst the gloomy Groves to view What soveraign vertues there in secret grew Confin'd to humble plants; whose signatures Whilst by observing, he his art secures From vain experiments, Argalia's Page Crossing a neighboring path, did disingage His serious eye from natures busie task, To see the wandring Boy, who was to ask The way; for more his youths unprompted fear Expects not there, to the blest man drawn near.
But when, with such a weeping innocence As Saints confess those sins which the expence Of tears exacted, he had sadly told What harsh fate in restrictive wounds laid hold Of's worthy Master, pity prompted by Religious love, helps the poor Boy to dry His tears with hopes of comfort, whilst he goes To see what sad Catastrophe did close Those bloody scenes which the unequal fight Foretold, before fear prompted him to flight. No far they'd past ere they the place had found Where groveling in a stream of blood, the ground His purple-bed, the wearied Prince they see Strugling with death, from whose dark monarchie Pale troops assail his cheeks, whilst his dim eies Like a spent lamp which ere its weak flame dies, In giddy blazes glares, as if his soul Were at those casements flying out, did roll Swifter then thought their bloodshot orbs; his hands Did with deaths agues tremble; cold dew stands Upon his clammy lips; the springs of blood (Having breath'd forth the spirits) clotted stood On that majestick brow, whose dreadful frown Had to deaths scepter laid its terror down. The holy man upon the brink o'th' grave Finding such forms of worth, attempts to save His life from dropping in, by all his best Reserves of art, selecting from the rest
Of his choise store, an herb whose soveraign power No flux of blood, though falling in a shower Of death could force, which gently bruis'd, and to His wound apply'd, taught nature to renew Her late neglected functions, and through short Recruits of breath made able to support His blood-enfeebled body, till they reach The Monastry, where nobler art did teach Their simple medicines to submit to those Which skill from their mixt vertues did compose. Life (which the unexpected gift of fate Rather then art appear'd) in this debate Of death prevailing, in short time had gain'd So much of strength, that weakness now remain'd The only slothful Rmora that in His bed detain'd him; where being often seen By those whom art alike had qualifi'd For his relief, as one of them appli'd His morning-medicines to a spacious wound Fixt on his breast, he that rare jewel found Which in his undiscerning infancie There hung by's father, fortune had kept free From all her various accidents, to shew How much his birth did to her favor owe. Shook with such silent joy as he had been In calm devotion by an Angel seen, The good old man, his wonder rarifi'd Into amazement stands, he had descri'd,
What, if no force had robb'd him of it since 'Twas first bestow'd, none but his true born Prince Could wear, since art (wise Natures fruitful ape) Ne'r but in that had birth which bore that shape Assur'd by which with unstirr'd confidence He asks Argalia where he knew from whence When nature first did so much wealth impart To earth, that jewel took those forms of art: But being answer'd, that his infancie When first it was conferr'd on him, might be Th' excuse of's ignorance; that voice alone Confirms his aged friend, who having known As much of fortune as in fates dark shade His understanding legible had made From weak Argalia, to require him leads Knowledge where he his lifes first copy reads Drest in this language.— —'Twas, unhappy Prince! (For such this story must salute you, since Told to confirm't a truth) my destinie When youth and strength rendred me fit to be My dearest Countries servant, plac'd within Mantinea's glorious Court, where, having been Made capable by sacred Orders, I Attain'd the height of Priestly dignity, Being unto him whose awful power did sway That crown, in dear esteem; but Honors day Which gilded then the Courtly sphere, sunk down, I lost my Mitre in the fall o'th' Crown.
Sad is the doleful tale; yet since that in Its progress you may find where did begin Your lifes first stage, thus take it. When the Court Stifl'd with throngs of men, whose thick resort Plenty and peace call'd thither, being grown Sickly with ease, view'd as a thing unknown, Dangers stern brow, which even in smiling fates Proves a Quotidian unto wiser States; Whilst pride grew big, and envy bigger, we Sleeping i'th' bed of soft securitie, Were with alarums wakened; Faction had, To shew neglects deformities, unclad That gawdy monster, whose first dress had bin The night-peec'd works of their unriper sin, And those that in contracted fortunes dwelt, Calmly in favors shadow, having felt The glorious burthen of their honor grown Too large for all that fortune call'd their own, Like fishes which the lesser frie devour, Pride having join'd oppression to their power, Prey'd on the subject, till their load outgrew Their loyalty, and forc'd even those that knew Once only to obey, in sullen rage To mutter threats, whose horror did presage That blood must in domestick jars be spilt, To cure their envy, and the peoples guilt. These seeds of discord which began to rise To active growth, by th' honorable Spies
Of other Princes seen, had soon betraid Our States obscure disease, and call'd to aid Ambitious subjects, forein powers, whose strength, First but as physick us'd, was grown at length Our worst disease, which whilst we hop'd for cure, Turn'd our slow Hectique to a Calenture. A Syracusian army, that had bin Against our strength often victorious in A haughty Rebels quarrel, being by Success taught how to ravish victory Without his aid, which only useful prov'd When treason first for novelty was lov'd: Seising on all that in's pretended cause Had stoop'd to conquest, what th' infeebled laws In vain attempted, soon perform, and give The traitor death, from what made treason live. This done, whilst their victorious ensigns were Fann'd by fames breath, they their bold standards bear Near to our last of hopes, an army which Like oft try'd Oare, disasters made more rich In loyal valor then vast numbers, and By shaking fixt those roots on which did stand Their well-elected principles, which here (Opprest with number) only did appeare In bravely dying, when their righteous cause Condemn'd by fates inevitable laws, Let its religion, vertue, valor, all That heaven calls just, beneath rebellion fall.
Near to the end of this black day, when none Was left that durst protect his injur'd throne, VVhen loyal valor having lost the day Bleeding within the bed of honor lay: Thy wounded father, when his acts had shewn As high a spirit as did ever groan Beneath misfortune, is inforc'd to leave The fields wild fury, and some rest receive In faithful Enna, where his springs of blood VVere hardly stopt, before a harsher slood Assails his eyes: Thy royal mother, then More blooming then earths ful-blown beauties when VVarm'd in the Ides of May, her fruitful womb Pregnant with thee, to an untimely tomb, Her fainting spirits in that horrid fright Losing the paths of life, from time, from light, And grief steals down; yet ere she had discharg'd Her debts to death, protecting heaven enlarg'd Thy narrow lodging, and that life which she Lost in thy fatal birth, bestow'd on thee; On thee, in whom those joys thy father priz'd More then lov'd empire, are epitomiz'd. And now as if the arms of adverse fate Had all conspir'd our ills to aggravate Above the strength of patience, we are by Victorious foes, before our fear could flie To a remoter refuge, clos'd within Unhappy Enna, which before they win
(Though storm'd with fierce assaults) the restless sun His annual progress through-the heavens had run; But then, tir'd with disasters which attend A slow-pac'd siege, unable to defend Their numbers from resistless famine, they With an unwilling loyaltie obey The next harsh summons, and so prostrate lie To th' rage, or mercy of their enemie. But ere the Cities fortune was unto This last black stage arriv'd, safely withdrew To th' Castles strength thy father was, where he (Though far from safety) finds the time to be Inform'd by sober councel how to steer Through this black storm, love, loyalty, and fear Had often varied judgments, but at last Into this form their full resolves were cast. To cool hot action, and to bathe in rest More peaceful places, darkness dispossest The days soveraignity, to usher whom Into her sable throne, a clouds full womb Congeal'd by frigid air, as if that then The elements had warr'd as well as men, In a white vail came hovering down to hide The Coral pavements, but forbid by th' pride Oth' Conquerors triumphs, and expell'd from thence As that which too much emblem'd innocence, Since that the City no safe harbor yields, It takes its lodging in the neighboring fields,
Which mantled in those spotless robes invite The Prince through them to take his secret flight. In sad distress leaving his Nobles to Swallow such harsh conditions as the view Of danger candi'd ore, from treacherous eyes Obscur'd in a Plebeians poor disguise His glorious train shrunk to desertless I, The sad companion of his misery; He now departing, thee his infant son Heir to his crown and cares, ordain'd to run This dangerous hazard of thy life before Time taught thee how thy fortune to deplore. When ventring on this precipice of fate, We slowly sallied forth, 'twas cold and late, The drowsie guard asleep, the Centries hid Close in their huds did shivering stand, and chid The whistling winds with chatring teeth, when now A leave as solemn as haste would allow, Of all our friends, our mourning friends, being took, We like the earth vail'd all in white forsook Our salliport, whilst slowly marching ore The new faln snow, thee in his arms he bore. Whilst this imposture made the scar'd guards when They saw us move, then make a stand agen, Either to think that dallying winds had plaid With flakes of snow, or that their sight betraid Their fancy into errors, we were past The reach of danger, and in triumph cast
Off with our fears, what had us safety lent When strength refus'd to save the innocent. The eager lover hugs himself not in Such roseal beds of joy, when what hath bin His sickly wishes is possest, as we Through watchfull foes arriv'd to libertie Imbrace the welcom blessing; first we stear Our course tow'rds Siracuse, whose confines near The mountain stood, upon whose cloudy brow Poor Enna did beneath her ruins bow. The Stars cloath'd in the pride of light, had sent Their sharp beams from the spangled firmament, To silver ore the Earth, which being embost With hills, seem'd now enamel'd ore with frost, The keen winds whistle in the justling trees, And cloath'd their naked limbs in hoary frees. When having pac'd some miles of crusted earth, Whose labor warm'd our blood, before the birth O' th' sluggish morning from his bed had drawn The early Villager, the sober dawn Lending our eyes the slow salutes of light, We are encountred with the welcom sight Of some poor scatter'd Cottages that stood In the dark shadow of a spacious wood That fring'd an humble valley, toward those, Whilst the still morn knew nought to discompose Her sleepy infancy, we went, and now Being come so near we might discover how
The unstir'd smoke stream'd from the Cottage tops, A glim'ring light from a low window stops Our further course, we're come to a low shed, Whose happy honor (ne'r disquieted With those domestick troubles that attend On larger roofs) here in content did spend Fortunes scant gifts, at his unhaunted gate Hearing us knock, he stands not to debate With wealthy misers slow suspition, but Swift, as if 'twere a sin to keep it shut, Removes that slender Guard; but when he there Unusual Strangers saw, with such a care As onely spoke a conscious shame to be Surpris'd, whilst unprovided poverty Straitned desire, he starts, yet entertains Us so, that shew'd by an industrious pains He strove to welcom more. Here being by Their goodness, and our own necessity Tempted a while to rest, we safely lay Far from persuing ills, yet since the way To danger by suspition lies, we still, Fear being betray'd by those that meant no ill, Since oft their busie whispers, though they spring From love, and wonder, slow discoveries bring. Being now removing, since thy tender age Threatned to make the grave its second stage If thence conveigh'd by us whose fondest love Could to thy wants but fruitless pity prove
T' inlarge thy commons, though increase our fears To those indulgent rurals, who for tears Had springs of milk to feed thee, thou remain'st An infant tenant, for thy own name 'gainst What since thou hast bin known by, which when we Contracted had to the stenographie, Some gold, the last of all our wealth we leave To make their burthen light, which they receive With thankfull joy, amaz'd to see those bright Angels display their strange unwonted light In poverties cold region, where they had Been pin'd for want, if not by labor clad. When age should make thee capable to tell Thy wonder how thy infancy had fell From honors pyramids, a jewel which Did once the splendor of his Crown inrich About thy neck he hangs, then breathing on Thy tender lips a parting kiss, we're gone, Gone from our last delight to finde some place Dark as our clouded stars, there to embrace Unenvi'd poverty, in the cold bed Of sad despair, till on his reverend head, Once center to a crown, grief makes him weare A silver frost by frequent storms of care Forc'd on that royal mount, whose verdute fades Ere time, by youths antagonist invades. Not far, through dark and unknown paths we had Wander'd within those forrests, which unclad
By big windes of their summers beauteous dress Naked, and trembling stood, ere fair success Smiling upon our miseries did bring Us to a chrystal stream, from whose cold spring, With busie and laborious care, we saw A feeble Hermite stooping down to draw An earthen pot, whose empty wants supply'd With liquid treasure, soon had satisfy'd His thirsty hopes; who now returning by A narrow path, which did directing Ile Through th' unfrequented desart, with the haste Of doubtfull Travellers, in lands laid waste By conquering foes, we follow till drawn near To him whom innocence secur'd from fear, Disburth'ning of his staff, he sits to rest What was with age and labor both opprest. Our first salutes, when we for blessings had Exchang'd with him, being sat, we there unclad All our deform'd misfortunes, and unless A kingdoms loss disvellop'd our distress. Which heard with pity, that he safely might Be the directing Pharos by whose light We might be safely guided from the rocks Of the tempestuous world, his tongue unlocks A cabinet of holy counsel, which More then our vanish'd honor did enrich Our souls (for whose eternal good was meant This cordial) with the worlds best wealth, Content,
Content, which flies the busie throne, to dwell With hungry Hermites in the noiseless cell. More safe then age from the hot sins of youth, Peaceful as faith, free as untroubled truth, Being by him directed hither, we Long liv'd within this narrow Monast'rie, Whose orders being too strict for those that ne're Had lost delight ith' prosecuting care Of unsuccessful action, suited best With us, whose griefs compar'd taught the distrest To sleight their own, as guests that did intrude On reason, in the want of fortitude, That brave supporter, which such comfort brings, That none can know but persecuted Kings. The purple-robe, his births unquestion'd right, For the course habit of a Carmelite Being now exchang'd, and we retir'd from both Our fears and hopes, like private Lovers loth When solve from the observant Spy, to be Disturb'd by friends, for want, or greatness, free Secure and calm, we spent those happy days In nought ambitious, but of what might raise Our thoughts towards heav'n, with whom each hour acquaints In prayr more frequent then afflicted saints Our happy souls, which here so long had bin Refining, till that grand reward of sin, Death, did by age (his common harbinger) Proclaim's approach, and warn'd us to defer
For the earths trivial business) nought that might Concern eternity, lest life and light Forsaking our dark mansions leave us to Darkness and death, unfurnisht of a clew Which might conduct (when time shall cease to be) Through the meanders of eternitie. Thy pious father, ere the thefts of age Decaying strength, should his stiff limbs engage In an uneasie rest, to level all Accounts with heaven, doth to remembrance call A vow, which though in hot affliction made Whilst passions-short ephemera's did invade His troubled soul, doth now, when the disease Time had expung'd, from solitary ease Call him again to an unwilling view Oth' active world, in a long journey to Forlorn Enna, unto whose Temple he Had vow'd, if fortune lent him libertie, Till tir'd with the extreams of weary age, The cheap devotion of a pilgrimage. The End of the Fourth Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO V. The Argument. I. To the grave Author of this happy news The pleas'd Argalia with delight did hear, Till (whilst the fatal story he persues) He brings his great soul near the gates of fear, II. By letting him in full discovery know The dreadful danger that did then attend His royal Sire, who to his sword must ow For safety, ere his sad afflictions end. FOrsaking now our solitary friends, Whose prayrs upon each slow-pac'd step attends From danger by a dress so course exempt As wore religion to avoid contempt, Through toils of many a tedious day, at last We Enna reach, where when his vows had past
The danger of a forfeiture, and we (That debt discharg'd to heaven) had libertie To look abroad, with sorrow-laden eyes We view those ruines in whose ashes lies Sad objects of our former loss, not then Rak'd up so deep, but old observant men When youths were in procession led, could tell Where towrs once stood, and in what fights they fell; Which to confirm, some in an aged pride Shew wounds, which then though they did wisely hide As signatures of loyal valor, they Now unsuspected with delight display. Hence when commanded by the wane of light We sought protection from approaching night In an adjacent Monastry, where we (The wandring objects of their charitie) Although by all welcom'd with friendly zeal, Found only one whose outside did reveal So much of an internal worth that might To active talk our clouded souls invight From griefs obscure retreats; his grave aspect (Though reverend age dwelt with unprun'd neglect) Seem'd drest with such a sacred solitude, As ruin'd Temples in their dust include. My royal Master, as some power divine, Had by instinct taught great souls how to twine Though 'mongst the weeds of poverty, with this Blest man consorting, whilst their apt souls miss
In all their long discourse no tittle set For mans direction in heavens alphabet; Whilst controverted points, those rocks on which Weak faiths are shipwrackt, did jems inrich Their art-assisted zeal, a sudden noise Clamorous and loud, in the soft womb destroys That sacred infant; the concordant bells Proclaim a joy, which larger triumph tells To be of such a publick birth, that they (In quiet cells) for what they late did pray In tears (the souls oreflowing language) now (Being by examples common rule taught how They vary passions) and in manly praise Their silent prayers to Halleluiahs raise. By swift report inform'd that this days mirth From the proclaiming of their Prince took birth These private mourners for the publick faults Of busie nations, by the hot assaults Of triumph startled from their gravitie, Prepare for joy; all but grave Sophron, he Then with the pilgrim Prince, who both were sate Like sad Physitians when the doubtful state Oth' Patients theatens death, the serious eye Of Sophron as a threatning prodigie Viewing that flattering smile of fate, which they Of shallower souls prais'd as approaching day. When both (their souls from active words retir'd) A while had silent sate, the Prince desir'd
To know the cause why in that triumh he Of all that Covent found the time to be With thoughtful cares alone, whom Sophron gave This satisfaction: Worthy Sir, I have In the few hours of our acquaintance found In you such worth, 'twould question for unsound My judgment, if unwilling to impart A secret, though the darling of my heart. Know then, this hapless Province, which of late Faction hath harrast, a wise Prince whom fate Depriv'd us of, once rul'd; but so long since, That age hath learn'd from time how to convince The hot enormities of youth, since we With such a Ruler lost our libertie. For though at first, as he alone had bin Our evil Geni, whose abode brought in All those attendant plagues, our fortune seemed To calm her brow, and captive hope redeemed In the destruction of our foes, which by A hot infection were enforc'd to fly From conquest near obtain'd: yet we, to shew That only 'twas our vices did orethrow The merits of his weaker vertues, when Successful battails had reduc'd agen Our panting Land from all external ill, Domestick quarrels threatned then to kill What forein powers assail'd in vain, and made Danger surprise, which trembled to invade.
For many years tost by th'uncertain wind Of wild ambition, we had sail'd to find Out the Lucadian rocks of Peace; but in A vain pursuit; for we so long had bin A headless multitude, the factious Peers Oppressing th'injur'd Commons, till our fears Became our fate, few having so much left Unsequestred, as might incite to theft Even those whom want makes desperate, all being spent On those that turn to th worst of punishment What wore protections name, Vilains that we Inforc'd maintain'd to christen Tyrannie Ith' injur'd name of Justice, such as kept Litigious Councels, for whose Votes we wept, From punishment so long, till grown above The blinded peoples envy, or their love. But lately these prodigious fires that led Us through the night of Anarchy, being fled At the approach of one, who since hath stood Fixt like a Star of the first magnitude, Diffusive power, which then was only shewn In Factions dress, being now Rebellion grown, By the uniting of those attoms in One haughty Peer, ambitious Zarrobrin, Whose pride (that spur of valor) when 't had set Him in the front of Honers alphabet, The sole Commander of those forces whence Our peace distill'd, and in as large a sense
As Subjects durst (whilst loyal) hope to have, Adorn their tombs, the highest titles gave Of a depending honor, to repay Their easie faiths that levell'd had the way Unto his greatness, that Command he made The steps by which he strugl'd to invade A Throne, and in their heedless Votes include Unnoted figures of their servitude. When with attempts frequent as fruitless, I With others, whose firm love to loyaltie Time had not yet expung'd, had oft in vain Oppos'd our power, which found too weak to gain Our Countries freedom, we, as useless, did Retire to mourn for what the fates forbid To have redrest: since when, his pride being grown The peoples burthen whilst he urg'd his own Ambitious ends, he hath, to fix their love On principles whose structure should not move, Unless it their allegiance shook, brought forth Their Prince, whose fathers unforgotten worth Did soon command their full consent, and he For treason fear'd, made lov'd for loyaltie. But since that 'mongst observant judgments this So sudden change might stand in doubt to miss A fair construction, to confirm't he brings An old Confessor of their absent Kings, The reverend Halophantes, one whose youth Made humane arts submit to sacred truth
So much, that now arriv'd to graver age He (like authentick Authors) did engage The people easie faith into a glad Belief, that when his youths afflictions had Unthron'd their Prince, he in that fatal night, Wisely contracting his imagin'd flight (As rodes unto destruction) leaving all Frequented paths, did in nights silence call At's unfrequented Cell, where entertain'd With all the zeal that subjects which have gain'd From gracious Soveraigns, study to express A vertue in, which thrives by the distress Of an afflicted patron's, he betrayes Enquiring Scouts, till some expunging dayes Make them forsake their inquisition in Despair to finde: which vacancy did win Time to bestow his infant burthen where Some secret friends did with indulgent care Raise him from undiscerning childhood to Be such as now expos'd unto their view. Thy father, who with doubtful thoughts had heard This story, till confirm'd in what he fear'd, Starts into so much passion as betrayes Him through the thick mask of those tedious dayes. Time had in thirty annual journeys stept To Sophron, who, when he a while had wept, A short encomion to good fortune, in Such prostrate lowliness as seem'd for sin
To censure guiltless ignorance, he meets His Princes full discovery, whom he greets With all the zeal, such whose uncourtly arts Make tongues the true interpreters of hearts, Do those wise Princes whom they know to start At aguish flattery, as if indesert Usher'd it in:—Those that know how to rate Their worth, prize it by vertue, not by fate. With Arguments which to assist he made Reasons firm power, Passions light scours invade, He had so oft th' unwilling Prince assail'd, That importunity at length prevail'd On his resolves, from peacefull povertie His ages refuge hurrying him to be Once more an Agent unto fortune in Uncertain toils, whose trouble to begin, Leaving his Prince to so much rest as those Whose serious souls are busied to compose Unravell'd thoughts into a method; now Sophron forsakes him to discover how His fellow Peers of that lost party stand Dispos'd for action, if a Kings command Should give it life; all which h findes to be So full of yet untainted loyaltie, That in a swift convention they prepare By joyning judgements to divide their care. From distant places, with such secret haste, As did declare a flaming zeal, though plac'd
In cautions shadow, owe considerate Peers, Such whose light youth th' experienc'd weight of yeers Had long since ballast with discretion, met To see their Prince, and to discharge the debt Of full obedience, each had with him brought His states surviving hope, snatch'd from the soft Hands of lamenting mothers, that to those, If fit for arms, they safely might dispose The excution of those Councils which Their sober age with judgement did inrich. In Sophron's Palace, which being far remov'd From the streets talking throngs, was most aprov'd For needfull privacy; these loyal Lords Whose faithfull hearts th' infallible records The heedless vulgar (whose neglective sin Had lost the copies of allegiance in This inter regnum) trust to, being met To shun delayes, (mans late repented debt) The Prince with speed appears, whom no disguise Of youths betrayer, Time, could from their eyes Long undiscover'd keep, through the rough vail Of Age, or what more powerfull did prevail On Beauties ruines, they did soon descry The unquench'd embers of a Majesty Too bright for time to hide, with curtains less Dark then that mansion of forgetfulness, The Grave, which mans first folly taught to be The obscure passage to eternitie.
That their example might be precept to Unknowing youth, with all the reverence due To awefull Princes on their thrones, the old Experienc'd Courtiers kneel; by which grown bold In their belief, those of unriper age Upon their judgements did their faith engage So far, that they in solemn vows unite Their yet concordant thoughts, which ere the flight Of time should leave the day behind, desire To live in action: But this rising fire Of loyal rage, which in their breasts did burn, The thankfull Prince thus gently strives to turn Into a milder passion, such as might Not scorch with anger, but with judgement light. How much is't both my wonder and my joy, That we whom treason studied to destroy, With near as much of miracle, as in The last of dayes, lost bodies that have bin Scatter'd amongst the elements, shall be Conven'd i'th' Court of immortality. Depress'd with fortune and disguis'd with age, (Sad arguments, brave subjects, to engage Your loyal valor) I had gone from all My mortal hopes, had not this secret call Of heaven, which doth with unknown method curb Our wilde intention, brought me to disturb Your peacefull age, whose abler youth had in Defending me expos'd to ruine bin.
I had no more my conscience (now at rest) With Widows curses, Orphans tears opprest; No more in fighting fields, those busie marts, Where honor doth for fame with death change harts, Beheld the sad success of Battails, where Proud victors make youths conquest ages care, But hid from all, a crowns false glories, spent Like beauteous flowers, which vainly waste the scent Of odors in unhanted desarts, all My time conceal'd till wither'd age should fall From that short stem of nature, life, to be Lost in the dust of deaths obscuritie. When in the pride of youth my stars withdrew Their influence first, I then had stood with you Those thunderbolts of fate, and bravely died, Contemning fortune, had that feverish pride Of valor not been quench'd in hope to save My infant son from an untimely grave. But he, when from domestick ills convey'd In safety, being by treacherous fate betray'd Either by death, or ignorance, from what His stars, when kindl'd first, where pointed at, Either lives not, or else conceal'd within Some course disguise, whose poverty hath been So long his dull companion, till he's grown Not less to us, then to himself unknown. All this being weigh'd in reasons scale, is there Ought in't can tempt decrepid age to bear
Such glorious burthens, which if fortunate In the obtaining of, in natures date Can have no long account, ere I again What I had got with danger, kept with pain, Summon'd by death the graves black monarch, must With sorrow lose: yet since that heaven so just, And you so loyal I have found, that it Might argue fear, if I unmov'd should sit At all your just desires, I here i'th' sight Of heaven declare, together with my right, To prosecute your Liberties as far As Justice dares to patronize a war. This with a magnanimity that shew'd His youths brave spirits were not all bestow'd On the accounts of age, had to so high A pitch of zeal inflam'd their loyalty, That in contempt of slow-pack'd counsels they Did like rash youth, whose wit wants times allay, Haste to unripe engagements, such as ound The issue weak, whose parents are unsound. All to those towns where neighborhood had made Them lov'd for vertue, or for power obey'd; Whilst each with his peculiar guar attends His honor'd Prince, imploy their active friends, Who having with collecting trumpets made Important errands ready to Invade The peoples censure, for a theme to fame Their long lost Princes safe returu proclaim;
Which, though at first, a subject it appear'd Onely for faith, when circumstance had clear'd Th' eye of Reason, from each nobler minde Th' embraces of a welcom truth did finde. In publick throngs, whilst every forward friend Spoke his resolves, his sullen foes did spend Their doubts in private whispers, by exchange Of which they found hate had no farther range Then close intelligence, whose utmost bounds Ere they obtain, the usefull trumpet sounds No distant summons, but close marches to His loyal friends, whom now their foes might view In troops, which if fate favor their intents, Ere long must swell to big-bulk'd Regiments: Through Country towns, and Cities prouder streets The murmuring drum in busie marches meets Such forward valor, husbandmen did fear The earth would languish the succeeding years For want of Laborers; nor could business stop The streightned Prentice, who, the slighted shop Left to his angry Master, who must be Forc'd to abridge his seven years tyranny, Changes the baser utensils of trade For burnisht arms, and by example made More valiant, scorns those shadows which they fear'd More then rough war, whilst 'mongst the cities herd. To Regiments, from scattering bands being grown, From that to Armys, whose big looks made known
Those bold designs, which Justice fear'd to own, Though hers, till plac'd in Powers imperial throne, They now toward action haste; which to begin, Whilst Castles are secur'd, and Towns girt in With armed lines, whose Pallizado's had Whole Forrests of their whispering Oaks unclad. The Prince, his mercy willing to prevent Approaching danger, by a Herald sent To Zarrobin, commands him to lay down His arms, and as he owed unto his Crown A Subjects due allegiance, to appear Before a moneth was added to that year, Within his Court, which now, since action gave Life to that body whose firm strength did save His life (by treason levell'd at) was in His moving Camp. But this too weak to win The doubtful Rebel, since his lawful right Swords must dispute, the Prince prepares to fight. Proud Zarrobrin, who had by late success Taught Siracuse how to avoid distress By seeking peace, like a black storm that flies On Southern winds, which in a tumult rise From neighboring seas, was on his march: But come Sonear the Prince, that now he had by some Of's spreading Scouts made full discovery where His Army lay; whose scarce discovered Rear Such distance from their well-arm'd Van appear'd, That such whose judgments were with numbers feard
Making no further inquisition, fled By swift report their pale disease to spread. Disturbing clouds which rather seem'd to rise From guilt then fear spread darkness ore the eyes O'th' Rebels, who, although by custom made To death familiar, wish their killing trade In peace concluded, and with murmures nigh Grown to the boldness of a mutinie, Question their own frail judgments, which so oft Had life expos'd to dangers, that had brought No more reward then what preserv'd them still The slaves unto a proud Commanders will. To stop this swift infection, which begun In lowly huts, to lofty tents had run, Slie Zarobrin, who to preserve th' esteem Of honor, lest lib'rality might seem The child of fear, with secret speed prevents What he appears to slight, their discontents. As if attending, though attended by Their young Mock-Prince, whose landskip royaltie Shew'd only fair, when view'd at distance, he Passing with slow observant pace to see Each squadrons order, he confirms their love With donatives, such as were far above Their hopes if Victors; then, to shew that in That pride of bounty h'had not strove to win Assistance by unworthy bribes, he leads Them far from danger, since his judgment reads
In long experience, that authentick story, Whose lines hath taught the nearest way to glory; That soft delays, like treacherous streams, which by Submitting lets the rash intruder try Their dangerous depth, to an unwilling stay His fierce persuers would ere long betray; Whose force since of th'untutor'd multitude By want made desperate, and by custom rude Would soon waste their unweildy strength, whilst they Whom discipline had taught how to obey, By pay made nimble, and by order sure, Would wars delays with easier wants endure. This sound advice meeting with sad success From the persuing Army, whose distress From tedious marches being too clamorous grown For's friends estates to quiet, soon was shewn In actions such, which though necessitie Inforc'd on vertue, made their presence be To th' inconsiderate vulgar, whose loose glance For vertue take vice gloss'd with circumstance, Such an oppression, that comparing those Which fled with mildness, they behold as foes; Only their ruder followers, whom they curse, Not that their cause, but company was worse. When thus their wans had brought disorder in, And that neglect whose looser garb had bin At first so shie, that what was hardly known From business then, was now to custom grown.
This large limb'd body, since united by No cement but the love to loyalty Loses those baser parts, such as to please Unworthy ends turn'd duty to disease, Retaining onely those whose valor sought No more reward then what with blood they bought. But here, to shew that slumbring justice may Opprest with power, faint in the busie day Of doubtfull battel; when their valor had So many souls from robes of fresh unclad Of his brave friends, that the forsaken Prince Whose sad success taught knowledge to convince The Arguments of hope; unguarded left Unto persuing foes was soon bereft Of all that in this cloud of fortune might By opposition or unworthy flight, But promise fafety, and when death denide Him her last dark retreat to raise the pride Of an insulting foe, is forc'd to see The scorn of greatness in captivity. Yet with more terror to limb sorrow in His mighty soul, such friends as had not bin By death discharg'd in fatal battel, now Suffer'd so much as made even fear alow Her palest sons, to seek in future wars Brave victory got, by ages honor, scars, Or braver death, that antidote of shame, Whose stage none pass upon the rode of Fame,
Those that far'd best being murther'd, others sent With life to more afflicting banishment. When thus by him whose sacred order made The truth authentick, from his fortunes shade Argalia was redeem'd, the Prelate to Confirm his story, from his bosom drew The jewel, which having by wayes unknown To him that wore it open'd, there was shewn By wit contracted into art, as rare As his that durst make silver sphears compare With heavens light motion, an Effigies which His royal Sire, whilst beauty did enrich His youth, appear'd in such epitomy, As spacious fields are represented by Rare opticks on opposing walls, where sight Is conzen'd with imperfect forms of light. When with such joy as Scythians that grow proud Of day, behold light gild an eastern cloud, Argalia long had view'd that picture in Whose face he saw forms that said his had been Drawn by that pattern, with such thanks, as best The silent eloquence of looks exprest, The night grown ancient, ere their stories end, With solemn joy, leaves his informing friend. The End of the Fourth Book.
PHARONNIDA. The Fift Book. CANTO I. The Argument. I. Tier'd with afflictions in a safe retreat From th' active world, Pharonnida is now Making a sacred monastry her seat, Where near approaching the confirming vow, II. A rude assault, makes her a Prisoner to Almanzors power, to expiate whose sin The subtil Traytor swiftly leads her to The Court, where she had long a stranger bin. HEre harsh imployments, the unsavory weeds Of barren wants had over-run the seeds Of fancy with domestick cares, and in Those winter storms shipwrack'd what ere had bin My youths imperfect off-spring, had not I For love of this neglected poverty,
That meager fiend whose rustic tallons stick Contempt on all that are inforc'd to seek Like me, a poor subsistance 'mongst the low Shrubs of imployment, whilst blest wits that grow Good fortunes favorits, like proud Ceders stand Scorning the stroke of every feeble hand, Whose vain attempts, though they should martyr sense, Would be repulst with big-bulk'd confidence: Yet blush not gentle Muse, thou oft hast had Followers, by fortunes hand as meanly clad, And such as when time had worn envy forth Succeeding ages honor'd for their worth. Then though not by these rare examples fier'd To vain presumption, with a soul untir'd As his, whose fancies short Ephemeraes know No life, but what doth from his liquor flow, Whose wit grown wanton with canaries wealth Makes the chast Muse a pandress to a health, Our royal Lovers story I'll pursue Through times dark paths, which now have led me to Behold Argaia, by assisting art Advanc'd to health, preparing to depart From his obscure abode, to prosecute Designs, which when, success strikes terror mute With pleasing joy, shall him the mirror prove Of forward valor, glost with filial love. But let us here with prosperous blessings leave A while the noble Hero, and receive
From times accounts the often varying story Of her whose love conducted him to glory, Distrest Pharonnida, whose sufferings grown Too great for all that vertue ere had known From humane precepts, flies for refuge to Heavens narrowest paths, where the directing clew Of Law, to which the Earth for order owes, Lost in zeals light, a useless trouble growes. Return'd were all the messengers, which she Had at the first salutes of Libertie To seek Argalia sent: But since none brought Her passions ease, sick hope no longer sought Those flattering Emp'ricks; but at Loves bright fires Kindling her zeal, with sober pace retires From all expected honors, to bestow What time her youth did yet to nature ow, A solemn Recluse, by a sacred vow Lockt up from action, whilst she practis'd how By speculation safely to attain What busier Mortals doubtfully do gain. Within the compass of the valley, where Ismanders palace stood, the pious care Of elder times had plac'd, a Monastrie, Whose fair possessors from life's tumults free, In a calm voyage towards heaven (their home) there spent The quiet hours, so sweetly innocent, As if that place, that happy place, had bin Of all the earth alone exempt from sin;
Some sacred power ordaining (when 'twas given) It for the next preparing school to heaven; From whence those Vestals should, when life expires, Be for supplies advanc'd to heavenly quires. Lost to the world in sorrows lab'rinths, here Pharonnida, now out of hope to cleer This tempest of her fate, resolves to cast Her faiths firm anchor: But before she past The dangerous straits of a restrictive vow, She to such friends as judgment taught her how To prize, imparts it; 'mongst which few, the fair Silvandra, whom lost love had taught despair, With sad Florenza, both resolve to take The same strict habit, and with her forsake The treacherous world. But to disturb this clear Stream of devotion, soon there did appear Disswading friends, Ismander loth to lose So lov'd a guest, whilst she's of power to choose, Together with the vertuous Amida, Spend their most powerful arguments to draw Her from those cold thoughts, that her vertue might Whilst unconceal'd, lend weaker mortals light. Long had this friendly conflict lasted, ere Her conquer'd friends, whom a religious care Frighted from robbing heaven of Saints, withdrew To mourn her loss; yet ere they left her to Her cloyster'd Cell, Ismander, to comply With aged custom, calls such friends whom nigh
Abode had made familiar, to attend His Royal guest; some hasty days they spend In solemn feasting, where each friend although Cloath'd as when they at triumphs met, did shew A silent sadness, such as wretched Brides, When the neglected nuptial robe but hides The cares of an obstructed love, before Harsh parents wear. The mirthless feast past ore, The noble Virgins in procession by The mourning train, unto the Monast'ry Slowly conducted are, each led by two Full-breasted Maids, whom Hymen to renew The worlds decaying stock, his joys to prove By contracts summon'd to conjugal love. These as they past, like Paranymphs which led Young Beauties to espouse a Maidenhead With harmony, whose eachconcording part Tickl'd the ear, whilst it did strike the heart With mournful numbers, rifling every brest Of their deep thoughts, thus the sad sense exprest. I. To secret walks, to silent shades, To places where no voice invades The air, but what's created by Their own retir'd society, Slowly these blooming Nymphs we bring To wither out their fragrant spring,
For whose sweet odors Lovers pine, Where beauty doth but vainly shine: Cho. Where Natures wealth, and Arts assisting cost Both in the beams of distant hope are lost. 2. To Cloysters where cold damps destroy The busie thoughts of Bridal joy; To Vows whose harsh events must be Vncoupl'd cold Virginitie; To pensive prayers, where heaven appears Through the pale cloud of private tears, These captive Virgins we must leave, Till freedom they from death receive: Only in this remote conclusion blest, Cho. This vale of tears leads to eternal rest. 3. Then since that such a choice as theirs, Which stiles them the undoubted heirs To heaven, 'twere sinful to repent: Here may they live till beauty spent In a religious life, prepare Them with their fellow-Saints to share Celestial joys, for whose desire They freely from the world retire: Cho. Go then, and rest in blessed peace, whilst we Deplore the loss of such societie.
Through all the slow delays of Love arriv'd To the unguarded gate, friendship that thriv'd Not in Perswasions rhetorick, withdraws Her forces to assist that juster cause, Prayers for their future good; with which whilst they Are taking leave, th'unfolded gates give way For the blest Votries entrance, whom to meet, A hundred pair of Maids, more chastely sweet Then slowers which grow untoucht in desarts, were Led by their Abbess; to whose pious care These being join'd, with such a sad reverse Of eyes oreflowing, as the sable herse Close mourners leave, when they must see no more Their coffin'd dead, their friends are from the dore With eager looks, woes last since now denied A further view, departs unsatisfied. This last of duties which the dearest friend Ought to perform, brought to successful end; For here no custom with a dowries price At entrance paid, nurst slothful avarice: They're softly led through a fair garden, where Each walk was by the founders pious care, For various fancies, wanton imagrie, To catch the heart, and not to court the eye, Adorn'd with sacred histories. From hence To th' center of this fair circumference The fabrick come, the roving eye confin'd Within the buildings, to enlarge the mind
In contemplation, saw where happy Art Had on the figur'd walls the second part Of Sacred story, drawn in lines that had The worlds Redeemer from his first being clad In robes of flesh, presented to the view Through all his passion, till it brought him to The Cross, that highest seal of love, where he A sinless offering died, from sin to free The captiv'd world, which knew no other price But that to pay the debts of Paradice. Past through this place, where bleeding passion strove Their melting pity to refine to love, They're now the Temple enter'd, where to skreen Their thoughts yet nearer heaven, whom they had seen Ith' entrance scourg'd, contemn'd & crucifide, They there beheld, though veils of glory hide Some part of the amazing Majestie In his Ascension, as when rais'd to be For them that hear his death freed from the hate Of angry heaven, the powerful Advocate. Besides these bold attempts of Art that stood To fright the wicked, or to prompt the good; Something more great, more sacred, then could by Art be exprest, without the help oth' eye Reacht at the center of the soul, from whence To heaven, our rais'd desires circumference, Striking the lines of Contemplation, she Wrapt from the earth, is in an extasie
Holy, and high, through faith's clear optick shown Those joys which to departed saints are known. Before those pray'rs which zeal had tedious made With their last troops did conquer'd heav'n invade; The day was on the glitt'ring wings of light, Fled to the western world, and swarthy night In her black Empire thron'd; from silver shrines The kindl'd lamps through all the temple shines With dapl'd rayes, that did to th' eye present The beauties of the larger firmament. In which still calm, when all their rites were now So near perform'd, that the confirming vow Alone remain'd, a sudden noise of rude And clamorous sound, did through the ear intrude On their affrighted fancies, in so high A voice, that all their sacred harmony In this confusion lost, appear'd so small, As if that whisper'd which was made to call. Although the awfull majesty that here Religion held, the weak effects of fear With faith expel'd, yet when that nearer to Their slender gates the murmuring tumult drew; The Abbess sends not to secure, but see Who durst attempt what heaven from all kept free By strictest law, save those unhallow'd hands That follow curses whilst they flie commands, But they being entred ere the timerous Scout Could notice give, fear, which first sprung from doubt
Being into wilde confusion grown, from all Set forms affrights them, whilst at once they call For heavens protecting mercy, to behold That place where peacefull Saints us'd to unfold Heavens Oracles, possest with villains that Did ne'r know ought but want to tremble at, Which look'd like those that with proud Angels fell, And to storm heaven were sent in arms from hell, Converts that Scean where nothing did appear But calm devotion, to distracting fear; Amaz'd with horror, each sad votress stands Whilst sacred relicks drop from trembling hands; Here one whose heart with fears convulsions faint, Flies to the shrine of her protecting saint; By her another stands, whose spirits spent In Passion, looks pale as her monument: One shrieks, another prayes, a third had crost Her self so much, ill Angels might have lost The way to hurt her, if not taught to do'r, Cause she to th' sign too much did attribute. The royal Stranger by her fear persu'd To th' altar fled, had with mixt passion view'd This dreadfull troop, whilst from the temple gate They past the seat where trembling virgins sate Free from uncivil wrongs, as if that they That entred had been men prepar'd to pray, Not come to ravish, from which sight her fear Picks flowers of hope, but such, as they drawn near
From fancies soft lap, in a Hirocane Of passion drop'd her pray'rs and tears in vaine As words in winds, or showers in Seas, when they Prepare for ruin the obstructed way To pitty, which her stock of pray'rs had cost, In the dark shade of sudden horror lost. Seis'd on by two o' th' sacrilegious train Whose black disguise had made the eye in vain Seek to inform the soul, she and the poor Florenza, whilst their helpless friends deplore With silent tears so sad a loss, are drew From the clasp'd Altar in th' offended view Of their protecting saints, from whose shrines in A dismal omen dropt what ere had bin With hopes of merit plac'd. Black sulphry damps With swift convulsions quench'd the sacred lamps, The fabrick shakes, and as if griev'd they stood To circle guilt, the walls sweat tears of blood. Shrieks, such as if those fainted souls that there Trod heaven's strait paths, in their just quarrel were Rose from their silent dormitories to Deter their foes, through all the temple flew. But here in vain destroying angels shook The sword of vengeance, whilst his bold crimes struck 'Gainst heaven in high contempt; with impious haste, Snatch'd from the altar, whilst their friends did waste Unheard Orizons for their safety, they Unto the Fabrick's utmost gate convey
Their beauteous prizes, where with silence stood Their dreadful guard, which like a neighb'ring wood When vapors tip the naked boughs in light, With unsheath'd swords through the black mists of night A sparkling terror strook, with such a speed As scarce gave time to fear what would succeed. To such preceding vilanies, within Her Coach imprison'd, the sad Princess, in A march for swiftness such as busie war Hastes to meet death in, but for silence far More still then funerals, is by that black troop With such exchange as falling stars do stoop To nights black region, from the Monastrie Hurri'd in haste, by whom, or whither, she Yet knows no more then souls departing, when Or where, to meet in robes of flesh agen. The day salutes her, and uncurtain'd light Welcoms her through the confines of the night▪ But lends no comfort, every object that It shewed her, being such, as if frighted at The Prince of day, griev'd h'ad no longer slept, To shun, shrunk back beneath a cloud, and wept. When the unfolded curtains gave her eyes Leave to look forth, a troop, whose close disguise Were stubborn arms, she only saw, and they So silent, nought but motion did betray The faculties of life, by whom being led In such a sad march as their honor'd dead
Close mourners follow, she some flow-pac'd days 'Mongst strangers passing through stranger ways, (At both amaz'd) at length, unfathom'd by Her deepest thought within the reach oth' eye Her known Ghirenza views; but with a look From whence cold passion all the blood had took, And in her face (that frozen sea of fear) Left nought but storms of wonder to appear. Conven'd within the spacious Judgment-hall Of Reason, she, ere this had summon'd all Her weaker passions to th' impartial Bar Of Moral Vertue, where they sentenc'd are Only to an untroubled silence; in Which serious act whilst she had busied bin, She is, unnoted, ere the fall of day Brought by her convoy to a Lodge that lay Off from the rode, a place, when seen, she knew Ere his rebellion, had belong'd unto Her worst of foes, Almanzor, which begins At first a doubt, whose growing force soon wins The field of faith, and tells her timorous thought Her fathers troops would ne'r have thither brought Her, if design'd to suffer, since that he Knew those more fit for close captivitie. But long her reason lies not fetter'd in These cross Dilemma's; the slow night had been With tedious hours past ore, whilst she by none But Mutes, no less unheard, then their unknown
Is only waited on, by whom, when day To action call'd (she veil'd) is led the way To the attending Convoy, who had now Varied the Scene, Almanzor studying how To court compassion in his Prince, dares not At the first view, ere merit had begot A calm remission of rebellious sin, Affront an anger which had justice bin In his confusion; his arms he now behind, As that which might too soon have call'd to mind His former crimes, he leaves, and for them took To gain the aspect of a pitying look, A Hermites homely weed, his willing train By that fair gloss their liberties to gain, Rode arm'd; but so, what for offence they bore, Was in submission to lay down before The throne of injur'd power, to cure whose fear Their armed heads on halter'd necks appear Near to the rear of these, the Princess in A mourning Litter, close as she had bin In a night-march unto her tomb, is through The Cities wandring tumults led unto The royal palace, at whose gates all stay Save bold Almanzor, whom the Guards obey For his appearing sanctity so much, That he unquestion'd enters, and thought such As his grave habit promis'd, soon obtain'd The Princes sight, where with a gesture fain'd
To all the shapes of true devotion, he By a successfull fiction comes to be Esteem'd the true converter of those wilde Bandits, which being by their own crimes exil'd In spight of law had liv'd to punish those Which did the rules of punishment compose. These being pardon'd, as he'd took from thence Encouragement, veil'd under the pretence Of a religious pity, he begins In language, whose emolient smoothness wins An easie conquest on belief, to frame A sad Petition, which although in name It had disguis'd Pharonnida, did finde So much of pity as the Prince inclin'd To lend his aid for the relief of her Whose vertue found so fair a character In his description, it might make unblest That power which left so much of worth distrest. Though too much tir'd with private cares to shew In publick throngs how much his love did owe To suffering vertue, yet since told that she Was too much mask'd in clouds of grief to be The object of the censuring Court, he to The Litter goes, whose sable veil withdrew With wonder, that did scarce belief admit Shadow'd in grief, he sees his daughter sit, His long lost daughter, whom unsought, to be Thus strangely found, to such an extasie
Of joy exalts him, that his spirits by Those swift pulsations had been all let fly With thanks towards heav'n, had not the royal Maid With showers of penitential tears allaid Those hotter passions, and revok'd him to Support her griefs, whose burthen had out-grew The powers of life, but that there did appear Kinde natures love, to cure weak natures fear. In this encounter of their passions, both With sorrow silent stood, words being loath T' intrude upon their busie thoughts, till they In moist compassion melted had away His angers fever, and her frozen ears In Natures balm, soft loves extracted tears: Like a sad Patient whose forgotten strength Decay'd by cronick ills, hath made the length Of life his burthen, when near death, meets there Unhop'd for health; so from continual care, The souls slow hectick, elevated by This cordial joy, the slothfull Lethargy Of age, or sorrow findes an easier cure Then the unsafe extream, a Calenture. Nor are these comforts long constrain'd to rest Within the confines of his own swell'd brest, Ere its dismantl'd rayes did in a flight Swift as the motions of unbodied light Disperse its Epidemick vertues through The joyfull Court, which now arriv'd unto
Its former splendor, heavens expected praise Doth on the wings of candid mercy raise: Which spreading in a joyful Jubile To all offenders, tells Almanzor he Might safely now unmask; which done, ere yet Discover'd, at the well-pleas'd Princess feet Humbl'd with guilt he kneels; who at the sight As much amaz'd as so sublime a flight Of joy admitted, stands attentive to What did in these submissive words ensue. Behold, great Sir, (for now I dare be seen) An object for your mercy that had been Too dreadful for discovery, had not this Preceding joy told me, no Crime could miss The rode of mercy, though like mine, a sin The suffering Nation is invellop'd in. Sunk in the ocean of my guilt, I h'd gone A desperate Rebel, waited on by none But Outlaws to a grave obscure, had not Relenting heaven thus taught me how to blot Out some of sins black characters, ere I Beheld the beams of injur'd Majestie. This in his passions relaxation spoke, Perswades the Princes justice to revoke Its former rigor. By the helpful hand Of mercy rais'd, Almanzor soon did stand Not only pardon'd, but secur'd by all His former honors from a future fall,
Making that fortune which did now appear Their pities object, through the glass of fear With envy look'd on, but in vain, he stood Confirm'd in Loves Meridian altitude The length of life from Honors western shade, Except in new Rebellion retrograde: Which plotting leave him, till the winding clew Of fancy shall conduct your knowledge to Those uncouth vaults; and mounting the next story, See Vertue climbing to the throne of glory. The End of the First Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO II. The Argument. I. Leaving Pharonnida to entertain The varieus passions of her Father, we Must now return to see Argalia gain That power by which he sets his Father free II. From the command of haughty Rebels, who By justice sent to a deserved death, Argalia takes the Crown, his merits due, And the old Prince in peace resigns his breath. REturn'd to see what all the dark records Of the old Spartan History affords Ith' progress of Argalia's fate, I found The chain'd Historian here so strictly bound To follow truth, although at dangers cost, No silent night, nor scky battail lost
The doubtfull rode, which often did appear Through floods of faction fill'd with storms of fear Obscure and dark, to the belief of that Less guilty age; though then to tremble at Romes bold ambition, and those prodigies Of earth, their Tyrants, to inform their eies, Left mourning monuments of ill, but none Like what they now attempt, a sin unknown To old Aspirers, which should have been sent Some Ages forward for a president To these, with whom compar'd, their crimes had bin, Though past to act, but weak essayes of sin. With such a speed as the supplies of air Fearing a vacuum, hasten to repair The ruptures of the earth, at our last view We left reviv'd Argalia posting to Aetolia's distant confines, where arriv'd, He found their Army, whose atempts had thriv'd Since he Epirus had forsook, so far Advanc'd, that now the varied scene of war Transferr'd to faithless Ardena, was there Fixt in a siege, whose slow approaches were The doubts of both; the city pines for fear Remote supplies might fail, which drawn so near The circling Army knows, that either they Must flie from conquest near obtain'd, or stay To meet a danger, which by judgement scan'd, Their strength appears unable to withstand.
Whilst thus their pensive leaders busied are In cross dilemma's, as by publick war He meant to meet revenge in private, to Their camp Argalia comes, a camp which knew Him by the fair-wrought characters of fame So well, that now he needs no more then name Himself to merit welcom, all mistrust Being clear'd by them which left as too unjust To be obey'd, the false Epirots ide, When by his loss made subject to the pride Of stranger Chiefs; these for their vertue prais'd For number fear'd, to such a height had rais'd Applauding truths of him, that Zarrobrin Conjoyn'd to one he trembl'd at, whilst seen In opposition, slights what did of late Appear a dreadfull precipice of fate. Lest poor imployments might make favor shew Like faint mistrust, he doth at first bestow On the brave stranger the supream command Of some choise horse, selected to withstand The fierce Epirot's march, whose Army ere The slow Aetolians could their strength prepare Fit to resist, if not by him withstood, With case had gain'd a dangerous neighborhood▪ But he, whose angers thunderbolts could stay Though hurl'd from clouds of rage, if the allay Of judgement interpos'd, here finding nought More safe then haste, ere his secure foes thought
Of opposition, strongly had possest A strait in which small troops had oft distrest Large bodied Armies, until brought so low, Those they contemn'd did liberty bestow. Whilst stop'd by this unlook'd for remora The baffl'd Army oft had strove to draw Argalia from his safe retreats, but found His art of more advantage then his ground; In the dead Age of unsuccesful night A forward party which had learn'd to fight. From honors dictates, not commands, being by Youths hasty guide, rash valor, brought so night, Argalia's troops, that in a storm which cost Some lives, they many noble Captives lost: Amongst which number, as if thither sent By such a fate as shew'd Heavens close intent Pointed at good, Eriolus appears First a sad captive; but those common fears Soon, whilst in conflict with his passions, rest On the wish'd object of his long inquest Admir'd Argalia, to whose joy he brings As much of honor, as elected Kings Meet in those votes, which so auspicious prove, They light to honor with the rayes of love. Having from him in full relation heard Pharonnida yet liv'd, whom long he fear'd Beyond redemption lost, they thence proceed To councels, whose mature results might breed
Their heedles foes confusion, which since they That now were captives, bore the greatest sway In the opposing Army proves a task So free from danger, death did scarce unmask The face of horror in a charge, before Argalia's name eccho'd in praises ore The rallied troops, summons from thence so large A party, that the valor of a charge In those that stood were madness, which to shun, Base Cowards taught brave Fighters how to run. This easie conquest gain'd; ere Zarrobrin Was with his slower Army drawn within The noise o' th' battel, to such vast extent Of fame, high vertues spreading ornament, Had rais'd Argalia's merits, that the pride Of his Commander wisely laid aside For such advantage, to let honor stand On her own basis, the supream command Of all the strangers in his Camp to him He freely gives, a power which soon would dim His, if ere by some harsh distemper plac'd In opposition; but his thoughts imbrac'd In all suspitions darkest cells, no fiend So pale as fear, fixt on the sudden end Of high designs, he looks on this success As the strait rode to future happiness With such a speed as prosperous victors go To see, and conquer, when the vanquish'd foe
Retreats from honor, the Aetolian had Follow'd success, till that fair hand unclad The sunk Epirot of his strength, and now Secur'd from forrein ills was studying how To cure domestick dangers; which since he The weak foundation of his Tyrannie Had fixt in sand but onely cemented With loyal blood, such just contempt had bred I' th' Ages deep discerning judgements, that Th' unsettl'd herd, ere scarcely lightned at Those sober flames, like ill mixt vapors break In blustring murmurs forth, which though too weak To force his fortune on the rocks of hate, With terror shook the structure of his fate. Like wise Physitians, which when call'd to cure Infectious ills, with Antidotes make sure Themselves from danger; since hypocrisie Could steal no entrance to affection, he Leads part of's Army for his guard, that they Where mines did fail, by storm might force a way. But since he doubts constrain'd domesticks, though Abroad obedient, might, when come to know From burthen'd friends their cause of grief, forsake Unjust commands, his wiser care did take Argalia and his stranger troops, as those (Which unconcern'd) he freely might dispose To winde up all the engines of his brain, So guilt were gilded with the hopes of gain.
By hasty marches being arriv'd with these Within Aetolia, where his frowns appease Those bubbles, that (their Neptune absent) would Have swell'd to waves, ere his hot spirits cool'd Were with relaxing rest, he visits him The weak reflex of whose light crown looks dim To th' burnish'd splendor of his blade that set Him onely there to be the cabinet Of that usurped diadem, which he Whose subtile arts in clouded brows could see The hearts intended storms, beheld without His unstrain'd reach, until the peoples doubt, Which yet liv'd in the dawn of hope, he saw Oreshadow'd with the forms of injur'd Law. Though time (that fatal enemy to truth) Had not alone rob'd the fresh thoughts of youth O' th' knowledge of their long lost Prince, but been Even unto those that had ador'd him in His throne, oblivions handmaid, yet lest by Some power occult that in captivity Forsakes not injur'd Monarchs, there remain'd In most some passions, which first entertain'd At pities cost, at length by reason try'd Grew so much lov'd, that onely power deny'd Them to support his sinking cause, which seen By Zorabrin, whose tyranny had been At first their fear, and now their hate, he brings His Army, an Elixar, which to Kings
Transforms Plebeians, by the strength of that To binde those hands, that else had strugl'd at Their heads offence, which wanting power to cure, They now with griefs convulsions must endure. A Court conven'd of such whose killing trade The rigid Law so flexible had made, That their keen Votes had forc'd the bloodiest field To the deep tincture of the Scaffold yeild; Forth of his uncouth prison summon'd by The rude commands of wrong'd Authority, An object which succeeding Ages when But spoke of weep, because they blush'd not then, The Prince appears a guarded captive in That City where his morning Star had bin Beheld in honors Zenith; slowly by Inferior slaves, which nere on Majesty Whilst uneclips'd durst look, being led to prove Who blush'd with anger, or look'd pale with love. By these being to a mock-tribunal brought, Where damn'd rebellion for disguise had sought The veil of justice, but so thinly spread, Each stroke their envy levell'd at his head Betray'd black treasons hand, couch'd in that Vote Which struck with Law to cut Religions throte. From a poor Pleader, whose cheap conscience had Been sold for bribes, long ere the purple clad So base a thing, their calm-soul'd Soveraign hears Death's fatal doom, which when pronounc'd, appears
His candor, and their guilt, the one exprest By a reception, which declar'd his brest Unstir'd with passion; th' other strugling in Their troubled looks, which shew'd this monstrous sin That this damn'd plot did to rebellion bear, Even frighted those that treasons midwives were. Hence (all their black designs encourag'd by The levell'd paths of prosperous vilany) High mounted mischief, stretch'd upon the wing Of powerfull ill, persues the helpless King To the last stage of life, a scaffold, whence With tears (cheap off-springs to his innocence) Such of his pitying friends as durst disclose Their passions, view him, whilst insulting foes (Exalted on the pyramids of pride) By long-wing'd power, with base contempt deride Their sorrow, and his sufferings whom their hate Had followed near the period of his fate; Which being now so near arriv'd, that all With various passion did expect the fall Of the last fatal stroke, kinde heaven to save A life so near the confines of the grave, Transcends dull hope by so sublime a flight, That dazl'd faith, (amaz'd with too much light; Whilst extasies of wonder did destroy Unripe belief) near lost the rode of joy. Even with the juncture of that minute when The ax was falling, from those throngs of men
Sway'd by's command, Argalia with a speed That startl'd action, mounts the stage, and freed The trembling Prince from deaths pale fear; which do ne To shew on what just grounds he had begun So brave, so bold an action, he seises all That knowledge or suspition dares to call The Tyrants friends, the guilty Tyrant, who Whilst he doth from his distant palace view This dreadful change, with a disdain as high As are his crimes, being apprehended by Argalia's nimble guards, is forc'd to be Their sad Conductor to a destinie So full of horror, that it hardly lies In's foes to save him for a sacrifice From their wild rage who know no justice but What doth, by death, a stop to fury put. From noisless pray'rs and bloodless looks, being by The bold Attempters of his liberty Rais'd to behold his rescue; heedless fear Hatcht by mistake, from those that border'd near Had with such swiftness its infection spread, That the more distant knowing not what bred The busie tumult, in so wild a haste As vanquish'd troops which at the heels are chac'd Flie the persuing sword, they madly run To meet those dangers which they strove to shun▪ In which confusion none o'th' throng had bin Left to behold how justice triumph'd in
Revenges throne, had not a swift command By power enabl'd, hasten'd to withstand That troubl'd torrent which the truth ourgrew Until their fears original they knew. The onset past, Argalia, having first Secur'd the Tyrant, for whose blood the thirst Of the vext people rag'd, he mounted on That scaffold whence his father should have gone A royal martyr to the grave, did there By a commanded silence first prepare The clamorous throng to hear the hidden cause Which made him slight their new-created laws. Then, in that mart of satisfaction which With knowledge doth the doubtful herd enrich, The publick view, he freely shews how far Through ortunes desarts the auspicious star Of heavens unfathom'd providence had led Him from the axe to save that sacred head, Whose reverend snow his full discovery had In the first dress of youthful vigor clad, Could constant nature sympathize with that Reviving joy his spirits panted at. His sons relation, seconded by all That suffering sharer in his pitied fall, Mantinea's Bishop, knew, join'd to the sight Of that known jewel, whose unwasted light Had serv'd alone to guide them, satisfies The inquisition even of critick eyes
With such a fulness of content, that they (Each from his Prince being lighten'd with a ray Of sprightly mirth) endeavour'd to destroy Their former grief in hope of future joy: Which to attain to, those whose counsels had The land in blood, and them in mourning clad, Call'd forth by order to confession, there Are scarce given time the foulness to declare Of their past crimes, before the peoples hate (That headstrong monster) strove t' anticipate The sword of vengeance, and in wild rage save The labor of an ignominious grave To every parcel of those rent limbs, that When but beheld, they lately trembl'd at: "Such being the fate of falling Tyrants, when "Conquering, the fear, conquer'd, the scorn of men But here lest inconsiderate rage should send Their souls to darkness, ere confession end Their tragick story, hated Zarrobrin With that unhappy boy whose Crown had been Worne but to make him capable to die A sacrifice to injur'd libertie, Rescued by order from the rout, is to A publick trial brought, where in the view Of all the injur'd multitude, the old Audacious traitor did to th' light unfold His acts of darkness, which discover'd him They gaz'd on, whilst unquestion'd power did dim
Discerning wits but a dull Meteor, one By hot ambition mounted to a throne, By an attractive policy, which when Its influence fail'd, back to that lazy Fen, His fortunes Center, hurling him again, The onely Star in Honor's Orb would raign. This slie Imposture seconded by that Rebellious guilt his actions offer'd at In all its bold attempts, had kindl'd in The late supporters of unprosperous sin So high a rage, that in wild fury they Their anger wanting what it should obey, A sober judgement, stands not to dispute With the slow Law, but with their strength confute All tending to delay; like torrents broke Through the imprisoning banks, to get one stroke At heads so hated all rush in, untill Their sever'd limbs want quantity to fill A room i' th' eyes receiving beams; this done, With blood and anger warm'd, they wildly run To search out such whom consanguinitie Had rendred so unhappy, as to be Allied to them, all which with rage that stil'd Beasts mercifull, and angry soldiers mild, They to destruction chase, whilst guiltless walls In which they dwelt in funeral blazes falls, Where burns inviting treasure, as they saw In the golds splendor an Anathema
So full of horror, as it seem'd to be A plague beyond unpitied Povertie. Impetuous Rage, like whirle windes unoppos'd Hush'd to a calm, as hate had but unclos'd The anger-blinded eyes of Love, the bold Flame like a fire, forc'd from repulsive cold, Breaks through the harsh extream of hate, to shew How much their loyal duty did out-grow Those fruits of forc'd obedience, which before They slowly to intruding Tyrants bore; In which procession of their joy, that he Might meet their hopes with a solemnitie Large as their love, or his delight; the Prince Taught by informing age how to convince Ambitions hasty Arguments, calls forth His long lost son, whose late discover'd worth Was grown the Ages wonder, to support The ponderous Crown, whilst he did tread the short And sickly step of age, untroubl'd by The burthen of afflicting Majesty. His Coronation past in such a tide Of full content, as to be glorifide, Blest souls in the worlds conflagration shall From tombs their reunited bodies call, The feeble Prince leaving the joyful throng Of his applauding Subjects, seeks among Religious shades (those cool retreats) to finde That best composer of a stormy minde,
A still devotion, on whose downy bed Not long he'ad lay before that entrance led Him to the Court of heaven, though through the gate Of welcom death, a cross, which though from fate, Not accident, he being instructed by Age, and Religion, to prepare to di On Natures summons, yet so deep a strain Spreads ore those robes that joy had dy'd in grain, That his heroick son to meet alone So fierce a soe, leaving the widow'd throne Retreats to silent tears, whose plenteous spring By the example of their mourning King, From those small clouds there first beheld to rise, Beges a storm in every Subjects eies. Betraying time, the worlds unquestion'd thief. Intending ore obliterated grief Some new transcription, to perform it brings A ravish'd quill from Loves expanded wings, Presenting to Argalia's willing view What ere blinde chance roll'd on the various clew Of his fair Mistris, Fate, unfolded by Euriolus, who was when victory First gave him freedom, by Argalia sent With speed that might anticipate intent, The unconfin'd Pharonnida to free From her religious strict captivitie. But being arriv'd where contrary to all His thoughts, he heard how first she came to fall
Into Almanzors hand, by whom convey'd Thence to her Fathers Court, his judgement stay'd Not to consult with slow advice, but hastes On the persuit of her; whom found, he wastes Few dayes before fair opportunitie Was so auspicious to his prayers, that he Not onely proves a happy Messenger Where first imploy'd, but in exchange for her Returns the story of what had been done Since first this tempest of their fate begun. How she forsook the Monastry, and in What agonies of passion thence had bin Forc'd to her fathers Court, where all her fears Dissolve in pity, he related hears With calm attention; but when come to that, Whose first conceptions he had trembl'd at, The Siracusians fresh assaults unto That Virgin-fort, whose strength although he knew Too great for storm, yet since assisted by Her Fathers power, the wraths of victory Rent by command from his deserts might crown Anothers brows, to pull those Laurels down Ere rais'd in triumph, he prepares to move By royal steps unto the throne of love. The End of the Second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO III. The Argument. I. From the Aetolians lte victorious King Ambassadors in Sparta's Court arrive; Where slighted, back they this sad Message bring That force must onely make his just claim thrive. II. Which to confirm, th' Epirots power invades His Land, in hopes for full reward to have Pharonnida; but close Almanzor shades His glorious hopes in an untimely grave. AN unripe rumor, such as Causes near Declining catch at, when betraying fear Plunges at hope, had through Ghirenza spread The story of Argalia's fate, but shed From such loose clouds of scatter'd fame, as by Observant wits were onely thought to fly
I' th' airy region of report, where they Are forc'd each winde of fancy to obey. Whose various blasts, when brought unto the test Of judgment, rather the desires exprest, Then knowledge of its Authors: here 'mongst those Of various censure, slie Almanzor chose To be of the believing part, since that Might soonest crush all hopes that levell'd at Affection to Pharonnida, whom he Strove to preserve in calm neutralitie. But here he fails to countermine his plot, This seeming fable soon appears begot By solid truth, a truth which scorns to lie Begging at th' gates of probabilitie; Which to avoid, she from Argalia brings Ambassadors (those mouths of absent Kings) To plead her right, at whose unlook'd for view Almanzor, whose falacious schemes were drew Onely for false Phaenomena's, is now Forc'd to erect new figures, and allow Each star his influence; but declar'd in vain, Since Pride did lord of the Ascendant reign; Pride, which conjoyn'd to policy had made All other motions seem but retrograde. His black Arts thus deceiv'd, since nought could make The dull Spectators ignorance mistake This constellation for a Comet, he Attempts with fear of its malignitie
To fright each busie gazer, and since all The circles of opinion were to fall Like spacious Azminths in that Zenith, to Sttle the Prince, through whom the people view All great conjunctions, where the different signe Should force those aspects, which might 'mongst that trine Of love else hold a concord, to dispence On him its most destructive influence. The Court being thus prepar'd, he boldly now Dares the delay'd Ambassadors allow A long expected audience, which in brief Makes known their masters fate in the relief Of's injur'd father, thence proceeds to shew How much of praise his thankfull friends did owe To heaven for's own restor'd estate, which he Desires to joyn in calm confederacie With them, his honor'd neighbors; hence they past To what concern'd Pharonnida, their last And most important Message: which when heard In such a Language as the Rivals fear'd, A Language, which, to prove his interest In her unquestion'd, come but to request The freedom of a fathers grant, a high But stifled rage began to mutiny In all their breasts, such, as if not with-held By th' Law of Nations, had her father swell'd To ope acts of violence; which seen By some o' th' Lords, they calm his passion in
A cool retreat, such as might seem to be, Though harsh contempt, wrapt in civilitie. Fir'd with disdain, th' Ambassadors in such A speed which shew'd affronts that did but touch Their Masters honor wounded theirs, forsook Ghirenza, whilst Euriolus betook Himself to some more safe disguise that might Protect him, till the subject of delight, The course his royal master meant to stear In gaining her, his Story makes appear Unto distrest Pharonnida, who in That confidence secure, as she had been From all succeeding ills protected by A guard of Angels, in a harmony Of peacefull thoughts, such as in dangers keep Safe innocence, rocks all her cares asleep. But here she rests not long before the fall Of second storms proves this short interval But lightning, which in tempests shews unto Shores, which the shipwrack'd must no more then view: Anger, ambition, hate, and jealous fear Had all conspir'd Loves ruine, which drew near From hasty counsels rash results, which in His passions sorm had by her Father bin Like rocks, which wretched Mariners mistake For Harbors, fled to, when he did forsake That safer channel of advice that might From free conventions, like the welcom light
Of Pharos guided his designs, till they At Anchor in the rode of Honor lay. As if his fears by nothing could have bin Secur'd, but what prov'd him ungratefull in Argalia's ruine, all discourses are Distastefull grown, but what to sudden war Incites his rage: which humor, though it needs No greater fire then what his envy feeds, Besides those Court-Tarantula's whose breath Stings easie Princes, till they dance to death At the delightfull sound of flattery, there Were deeper wits, such whom a subtile care, Not servile fear taught how to aggravate His angers flame, till their own eager hate Though burning with a mortal fury, might Pass unobserv'd, since near a greater light. Amongst those few whose love did not depend So much on fortune, but the name of friend Was still preserv'd, the faithfull Cyprian Prince Durst onely strive by reason to convince Their wilder passions; but each Argument With which affection strugl'd to prevent A swift destruction, onely seem'd to prove His friendship more effectual then his love. From which mistake, such as did strive to please The angry Princes passionate disease With what might seed the sickly humors, draw A consequence that proves Pharonnida
A blessing which was to his merits due Who most oppos'd the bold aspirer to That throne of Beauty, which before possest, Whole Armies must dispute their interest. The slighted Cyprian, since their fear could trust None but confederates, from their Councils thrust Those swift conclusions, which before to stay Their violence, had Reason's cool allay Hurry'd to action, strict commands are sent From fierce Zoranza through each Regiment, Which stoop'd their Ensignes to his power, that by Such marches as they'd follow victory, They reach Aetolia ere its new-crown'd King Warn'd by report, had liberty to bring Opposing strengths, (a task too hard to be Perform'd with ease in powers minoritie.) Nor fails this Council; for their Army draws No sooner near, but such as in the cause Of unsuccessful Rebels late had been Expos'd to danger, seek for refuge in A fresh revolt; and since their ulcerous guilt Was so malignant, that even mercy spilt Its balm in vain, their injur'd Prince forsake, To strengthen his proud Enemies, who make Those Poisons up in Cordials, and compound Them with their Army, which being thus grown sound Whereas it lately fainted, durst provoke Unto the trial of another stroke
His late victorious forces; which, though yet Faint with the blood lost in the last great fit Of Honors fever, when the Crisis prov'd The cures prognostick, had with ease remov'd The proud invaders, had Morea bin As heretofore a hurtful Neuter in That war; which now, since double strengths oppose Brave fortitude, like base oppression shews. So long both parties with varietie Of fortune fought, that fearing whose might be The sad success, that old Cleander, in Such speed as if his Crown engag'd had bin, Raises an Army, whose command, since he Base flattery takes for brave fidelitie, Waving those Peers to whose known faith he owes The most of trust, in hoodwink'd hope, bestowes On false Almanzor, who by power advanc'd Near to those hopes at which Ambition glanc'd But like weak eyes upon the dazeling sun, From that last atal sage his plots begun Mischiefs dark course, which ere concluded shall Crush the Epirot in Morea's fall. In this the hot distemper of their state, Aind, whom the Destinies of late To double-die his Honors purple-thred, Robb'd of a father, most disquieted Their secret councels, since they knew the love He bore Argalia, propt with power, might prove
A sad obstruction to their plots, if he Urg'd by distastes, shook their confederacie Off to assist his friend; which to oppose, With slattery fleeting as the gourd that rose But to discover his just wrath that made The plant to cover, when it could not shade, They all attempt, though he engage not in Their party, yet his easie youth to win By honors moths, by times betrayers, soft And smooth delights, those serpents, which too oft Strangle Herculean vertues: But they here In Ages April find a wit appear Of such full growth, that by his judgment they Are undermin'd, who studied to betray. Being thus secur'd from forein fears, they now Imploy that rage, whose speed could scarce allow Advice from Councel, to extirpate those New planted Laurels vict'rie did compose To crown Argalia. But before they go To ravish Conquest from so cheap a Foe Whose valor by orewhelming power was barr'd From lying safe at a defensive guard, Till old Cleander, that their league might be Assur'd by bonds whose firm stabilitie Death only could divorce, intends, though she, With such aversion as their destinie Wretches condemn'd would shun, attempt to fly The storm of fate; yet countmanded by
His power, the fair Pharonnida, although He not to love, but duty seem'd to owe For such a blessing, should Zoranza's be Confirm'd by Hymen's high solemnitie. This resolution, whose self-ends must blame Her fathers love, once registred by fame, Submits to censure; whilst Pharennida Laments her fate, some prompted by the law Of love and nature are to entertain So much of freedom, as they prove in vain Her advocates: Others, whose cautious fear Dares only pity, in that dress appear Silent and sad; only Almanzor in This State-distemper, by that subtile sin Dissimulation, so disguises all His black intentions, that whilst truth did call Him Treasons agent, its reflected light, Appearance, spoke him Vertues proselyte; So much a Convert, as if all those hot Crimes of his youth ambition had begot, Discreeter age had either cool'd, or by Repentance chang'd to zeal and loyalty. Whilst thus i'th' Court the most judicious eyes Deluded were by factions false disguise, By rumors heavy as the damps of death When they flie laden with the dying breath Of new-departed souls, this fatal news Assaults the Princess, which whilst reason views
With sad resentments, to support her in This storm of fate, Amindor, who had bin In all her griefs her best adviser, now Enters to tell her fainting sorrows how They'd yet a refuge left, from whom she might Reap hopes of safety: The first welcom sight Of such a friend, whose former actions had nhanc'd his worth, encountring with her sad And serious thoughts, so rarifies that cloud Of grief, that ere dissolving tears allow'd A vocal utterance, as intended words Something contain'd too doleful for records: Both sigh'd, both wept; at length the Princess broke Silence, and thus lier dismal passions spoke. Dare you, my Lord, approach so near unto A factious grief, in this black storm to view Distrest Pharonnida? have either I Or my Argalia's slighted memorie Yet in Morea a remaining friend, Whose vertue dares by its own strength contend Against this torrent of Court-factions? Now, Now, Royal Sir, that doom which will allow My soul no more refreshing slumbers, by My father's past, my father (Sir) whom I Must disobey with all the curses due To black rebellion, or else prove untrue Those vows, those oft repeated vows, which in Our Loves full growth hath to Argalia bin
Seal'd in the sight of heaven. About to speak Her passions fuller, sorrow here did break The sad theme off, and to proclaim her fears, (Except th'oreflowing language of her tears) No Herald left. In which sad silent fit The valiant Cyprian, who at first did sit His passions prisoner, from that bondage free, To her disease prescribes this remedie. —Cease Madam— Cease to eclipse illustrious beauty by Untimely tears; your griefs deformity Frights not Amindor from his friendship, when I first beheld that Miracle of men Ador'd Argalia, pluck from victorie His Naval laurels, Honor told me I Was then so much his Vertues captive, that Not all the dangers mortals tremble at Can make me shun assisting of him in Retaining you, though my attempts have bin Imploy'd in vain, in publick councel, to Procure your peace, there's something left to do By which our private plots may undermine Their publike power, and unperceiv'd decline That danger which, without this secret friend, It lies not in our fortune to defend. From griefs cold swoon to living comforts by This cordial rais'd, Pharonnida's reply Owns this pathetick language: If there be In all the dark paths of my destinie
Yet left a rode to safety, name it, Sir, What I'll atempt, no danger shall deter, So brave Amindor be my conduct through The dismal rode; but my wild hopes outgrow What ere my reason dictates. No, my Lord, Flie that sad fate whose progress can afford Nought but disasters, and live happy in Orlinda's love; should I attempt to win You from so fair a vertue, 'twere a wrong Too full of guilt to let me live among The number of your friends, 'mongst whom let m In all your future thoughts remember'd be As the most wretched to whom rigid fate All hopes weak cordials hath appli'd too late. Here ceas'd the sorrowing Lady, to suspend Whose following tears, her charitable friend Prescribes this comfort: Though my zeal hath bin, When serving you, so unsuccessful in My first attempts, it gives just cause to doubt My future actions; yet to lead you out Of this dark labyrinth where your sorrow stands Maskt with amazements, not the countermands Of my affection to Orlinda, though Confirm'd by vows, shall stop; let grief bestow But so much time (unclouded by your fear) To look Hopes volumes ore, there will appear Some lines of comfort yet, which that we may Not in a heedless horror cast away,
Prepare for speedy action, to prevent Ensuing ills no time is left unspent But only this approaching night, by which To slie from danger you must stoop t'enrich A course disguise, whose humble shadow may Enquiring eyes to dark mistakes betray. Our first retreat, which is design'd to be No further then the neighboring Monastrie Where I of late did lie conceal'd, I have Thus made secure: There stands an antient cave, Close hid in unfrequented shadows, near Your gardens postern gate; which when the fear Of bordering foes deni'd a free access To the old Abby, they from the distress Of threatning Scouts were safe deliver'd by A vault that through it leads; which though so nigh Unto the city, careless time, since not Forc'd to frequent, hath wholly left forgot By busie mortals. In this silent Cell Where nought but Lights eternal strangers dwell In the Meridian depth of night, whilst all Are rob'd in rest, you none encounter shall (Except my self) but him, who may with us This secret share, esteem'd Euriolus; With whom, and your indear'd Florenza, we Within the unsuspected Monastrie Protected by some secret friends may stay Till fruitless searches waste their hopes away,
Whose watchful spleen by care conducted might Stop our intentions of a further flight. Rais'd from the cold bed of despair, from this Mature advice to hopes of future bliss, The heavenly fair Pharonnida had now Withdrawn the vail of grief, and could allow Some smiles to wait upon those thanks which she Return'd her friend; who, that no time might be Lost by neglect from needful action, in A calm of comforts, such as had not bin Her late associates, leaves the Princess to Persue those plots, which fortune bent t'undo, Whilst hope on expectations wings did hover, Did thus by fatal accident discover. That knot in her fair thread of destiny, That lurking snake, the Purgatory by Which heaven refin'd her, curst Amphibia, had, Whilst mutual language all their thoughts unclad, Close as an unsuspected plague that in Darkness assaults, an unknown sharer bin Of this important issue; which with hate Her genius met, soon strives to propagate A brood of Fiends: Almanzor, whose dark plots Like images of damn'd Magicians rots Themselves to ruine others, like in this Last act of ill by too much haste to miss The rode that led through slipp'ry paths of sin, From prides stupendious precipice falls in
A gulf of horror, in whose dismal shade A private room his dark retreat is made. Here whilst his heart is boil'd in gall, his brain Orewhelm'd in clouds, whose darkness entertain No beam of reason, whilst ambition mixt Examples of the bloodiest murthers fixt Upon the brazen front of time, all which Lends no unfathom'd policie t'enrich His near impoverish'd brain, he hears one knock, Whose sudden noise soon scattering all the flock Of busie thoughts, him in a hasty rage Hurries to th' dore, where come, his eyes engage His tongue to welcom one whose curst advice His tortur'd thoughts turn'd to a Paradice Of pleasing hopes, on whose foundation he Prepares to build a future Monarchie. A slow-consuming grief, whose Chronick stealth Had slily robb'd Palermo's Prince of health, In spight of all the guards of Art had long Worn out his strength, and now had grown too strong For age to bear, each baffl'd Artist in A sad despair forsaking what had bin Try'd but t'upbraid their ignorance, except An aged Frier whose judgment long had slept From watchful practice. but i'th' Court of Arts Been so imploy'd, that the mysterious parts Of clouded Theoricks, which he courted by High contemplation, to his minds clear eye
Lay all undrest of that disguise which in Mans fall t'afflict posterity, they'd been By angry heaven wrapt in; so that he knew What astral vertues Vegetables drew From a celestial influence, and by what Absconded magick Nature fitted that To working humors, which they either move By 'xpulsive hate, or by attractive love. This Arts true master, when his hope was grown Faint with delays, to the sick Prince made known, A swift command calls from his still repose The reverend Sire, who come, doth soon disclose That long conceal'd malignity which had The feeble Prince in sickly paleness clad: Nor stays his Art at weak prognosticks, but Proceeds to practice whatsoere may put His Prince in ease, Cordials abstracted by A then near undiscover'd chymistry, Such as in single drops did all comprise Nature ere taught Art to epitomise; Such, as if arm'd with a Promethean fire, Might force a bloodless carkass to respire; Such as curb'd fate, and in their hot assault Whilst storming life, made deaths pale army halt. This rare Elixar by the Prince had bin, With such success as those that languish in Consuming ills, could wish themselves, so long Us'd, that those fits which else had grown too strong
For nature to contend withall, were now Grown more remiss; when Fate, that can allow No lasting comforts, to declare her power Ore Art it self, arrests that Conqueror Of others ills, with a disease that led Him a close prisoner to an uncouth bed; Which like to prove natures slow chariot to Th'expecting grave, loth to the publike view To prostitute a secret, yet bound by The obligation of his loyalty T'assist his Prince, he to Pharonnida That soveraign secret, which could only awe Her fathers threatning pain, declares, which she Hath since compos'd; when ere's extremitie Suffer'd those pains, whose progress to prevent, Sh'ad by Amphibia now the Cordial sent; The slie Amphibia, who did soon obay What lent her hate a freedom to betray. His first salutes being past, with such a speed As did declare the guilt of such a deed, Might doubt discovery, she unfolds that strange Amazing truth, which from the giddy range Of wild invention soon contracts each thought Into resolves, such as no object sought But the destruction of what ere might stop Ambitions progress; toward the slippery top Of which now climbing on Conceits stretcht wing, He silent stands, whilst teeming fancy brings
That Monster forth, for whose conception he Long since deflour'd his virgin-loyaltie. Few minutes, by that auxiliary aid Which her discovery lent, his thoughts convaid Through all the rodes of doubt: which safely past, Strictly imbracing her who in this last And greatest act of vilany must have A farther share, he thus begins: Oh save, Save, thou that art my better genius now, What thou alone hast rais'd; my hopes must bow Beneath impossibilities, if not By thee assisted; Fortune hath begot The means already; let this Cordial be With poison mixt, Fate knows no enemie Dares grapple with me; Do not start, there's here No room for danger, if we banish feare. His thoughts thus far discover'd, finding in Her various looks, that apprehended sin, The souls Mercurial pill, did penetrate Her callous conscience, in whose cell this sate With knawing horror; whilst all other lives Whom her fraud spilt, prov'd hurtless corrosives, From the cold ague of repentance, he Thus rouses her: Can my Amphibia be By fear (that fatal remora to all That's great, or good) thus startl'd? is the fall Of an old Tyrant grown a subject for This soft remorse? let thy brave soul abhor
Such sickly passions, when our fortune stands Fixt on their ruine, the unwilling hands Of those that now withstand our glorious flight Will help inthrone us, whilst unquestion'd right, (Which is for power the worlds mistaken word) Is made our own by th' Legislative sword. Rais'd from her fears cold trepidations by These hot ingredients, in an extasie Of flatuous hopes, she casts herself into This gulf of sin; and being prepar'd to do An act, which not the present times could see With sense enough, whilst in th'extremitie Of wonder lost, through all his guards strict care Death to the unsuspecting Prince doth beare. Freed from this doubt, Almanzor to avoid That storm of rage, which when their Prince destroid The Courtshould know, might rise from fear, pretends Haste to the Army; but being gone, suspends That speedy voyage, and being attended by A wretch whose guilt assur'd his privacy, Through paths untrod hastes to the Cave wherein Those habits which had by Amindor bin (Whilst he his beauteous charge did thence convay) Prepar'd to cloud illustrious beauty, lay: Of which, in such whose size did shew they were For th' largest sex, they both being clad, with care Secret as swift, haste to augment the flood Of swelling sins with yet more royal blood.
Th' Epirots constant Prince, by custom had Made known a walk; which when the day unclad Of glittering tissue, in her evenings lawn Sate coolly drest, to court the sober dawn, He often us'd, near this Almanzor (by Hell made successful in his vilany) Arriv'd some minutes ere the other, lies Conceal'd, till darkness, and a close disguise, (Those safe protectors) from his unseen seat Call him to action, where, with thoughts repleat With too much joy t'admit suspition, he Finds the Messenian, whom no fear to be Assaulted there had arm'd, his spacious train Shrunk into one that serv'd to entertain Time with discourse: Upon which heedless paire The arm'd Almanzor rushing unaware, Ere strength had time their valor to obay In storms of wounds their senses lose the way T'external objects; in which giddy trance The other Lord, whose spirits readvance To life, they fear not, lies secure, whilst by Redoubl'd wounds his Princes spirits fly From the most strong retreats of life, which now Batter'd by death, no safety could allow. Revenges thirst being in this royal flood Quench'd for a while, that from the guiltless blood His Honor might not yet a stain receive First hasting to the cave, he there doth leave
Those injur'd habits, which by him were meant For the betrayers of the innocent. This done, that he even from suspition might Secure his guilt, before the wasted night Looks pale at the approach of day, he flies To th' distant Army, there securely lies, Till all those black productions of his brain Now ripening to perfection should attain Maturity, and in the Court appear In their most horrid dress, knowing the fear Of the distracted City soon would call Him, and his Army, to prevet the fall Of such distracting dangers as might be Attendants on th'eclipse of Majestie. The End of the Third Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO IV. The Argument. I. Now, as if that great Engineer of ill, Accurst Almanzor, had accomplisht all Those black designs, which are ordaia'd to fill The Spartan Annals, by his Princes fall: II. With secret spight, yet such as seem'd to be From an advis'd Protector of the State, Pharonnida's ill fate assisting, he Toward her destruction prosecutes his hate. THat dismal Night which in the dark records Of story, yet so much of fate affords In the Morean Annals, had to Day Resign'd its reign, whose Eastern beams display Their morning-beauties, by whose welcom light The early Courtier, tir'd with tedious night,
Rises to meet expected triumphs, in Their Princes nuptials, which so long had bin The joyful business of their thoughts, that now Sallying to action, they're instructed how To court observance from the studied pain Of best inventions, by attractive gain Join'd to the itch of ostentative art, Were thither drawn from each adjacent part. In this swell'd torrent of expected mirth Which all conclude must make this morning birth To future Ages celebrated by An annual triumph, the disparity Of passion (sorrow) first breaks forth among The slain Epirot's followers, who so long Had mist their master, that they now begin To doubt his safety, every place had bin By strict enquiry search'd, to which they knew Either affection or imployment drew His frequent visits; but with an effect So vain, their care serv'd only to detect Their love, not him its object, who might have Lain till corruption sought it self a grave, Had not an early Forrester, so near The place approach'd, that maugre all that fear Alleag'd to stop a full discovery, he Beheld so much as taught him how to free His friends from further fruitless searches, in Discovering what beneath their fears had bin.
In sorrow, such as left no power to vent Its symptoms, but a deep astonishment Th'amaz'd Messenians, whom a sad belief Depriv'd of hope, did entertain their grief, Whose swift infection to communicate Their murther'd Prince, as if pale death kept state Clad in the crimson robes of blood, is to The City brought, where whilst the publick view In busie murmurs spread her sable wings, Pale terror to the Court, griefs center, brings The dreadful truth, which some officious Lord Whom favor did the priviledge afford Of easie entrance, through the guards of fear, In haste conveys t'assault the Princes ear. With such a silence as did seem to shew Unwelcom news is in its entrance slow, Enter'd the room, he's with soft pace unto The bed approach'd, whose curtains when withdrew Discover'd horror in the dismal dress Of death appears; freed from the slow distress Of Age (that coward tyrant) which ne'r shews His strength till man wants vigor to oppose Through deaths dark gates fled to the gloomy shade, Whose fear, or hope, not knowledge doth invade Our fancies yet, he mans material part There only sees; which form, whose heavenly art Tunes motion into'th faculties of life, Had now forsook the elemental strife
Which had so long at concord aim'd, was now Silenc'd in death, on his majestick brow No awefull frown did sit, the bloods retreat From life and action left his cheeks the seat Of deaths cold guest, which summon'd by his fate There in a pale and ghastly horror sate. Whilst the astonish'd Courtier did behold This with such trembling, as when graves unfold, Their Doom-dayes curtains, sinfull bodies shall Rise from their urns, eternally to fall; His stay, caus'd from restrictive fear, had drew In more Spectators, to whose wandring view This ghastly object when oppos'd had strook So swift a tertor, that their fears forsook The safe retreats of Reason, seeing life Had now concluded all the busie strife Of natures conflicts by delivering those Time-shaken Forts unto more powerfull foes, Outcries in vain attempts for pitty to Scale heaven, whose ear, when from their prayers withdrew The Court (now of her royal head bereft) In a still calm of hopeless sorrow left. Infectious grief, disdaining now to be Confin'd within the brief Stenographie Of first Discoverers, spreads it self among The City herd, whose rude unsteddy throng Rais'd grief (which in the mourning Court did dwell In such a silence as an Anch'rites Cell
Ne'r knew a heavier solitude) into Exalted outcries whose loud call had drew From their neglected arts so many, that What first was choler, now being kindl'd at Their rage, like humors grown adust had bin The open breach to let rebellion in; Had not the wiser Nobles, which did know That vulgar passions will to tumult grow When back'd with power, by a new modell'd form Of counsel soon allay'd this rising storm. Their tears (those fruitless sacrifices to Unactive grief, wip'd off whilst they did view The States distemp'red body, to supply The wants of that departed Majesty, Which when their Prince from Lifes horizon fell Fled from their view, before report should tell This fatal story to the Princess, they A Councel call, by whose advice she may Whilst floating in this Sea of sorrow be Sav'd from those unseen rocks, where treacherie Rebellions subtile Engineer might sit To wrack the weakness of a female wit; Which, though in her such that it might have bin The whole worlds Pilate, could, since clouded in Such a tempestuous Sea of passions, see No Star that might her safe director be. A Messenger whose sad observant wit By age allay'd seem'd a conveyer fit
For such important business, with the news Hasts towards the Princess, whom whilst fear persues On wings of pity, being arriv'd within The Palace, he, as that alone had bin The onely feat where rigid sorrow took Her fixt abode, beholds each servants look Obscur'd with grief, through whos dark-shades whilst he Searches the cause, the strange variety Explains it self, as families that have Led their protecting Ruler to the grave, whose loss they in a heedless sorrow mourn So long, till care doth to distraction turn: Her servants sate each wildly looking on The other, till even sense it self was gone In mourning wonder, whose wilde flight to stay Its cause, they to the pitying Lord display In such a tone, as whilst it did detect The Princess absence, shew'd their own neglect. When this he'ad heard, with such a sympathie Of sorrow as erected grief to be The mourning Monarch of his thoughts, to those Return'd that sent him, he that transcript shews Of this obscure original, the flight O' th' absent Princess, whilst the veil of night Obscur'd her passage, tells: but question'd how, With whom, or whether knowledge did allow No satisfaction, all inquiry gain'd From her amaz'd attendants but explain'd
Their grief, whose troubled rivolet flow'd in To that vast Ocean where before they'd bin By sorrow shipwrack'd in the general flood Mixt, wants a language to be understood In a peculiar character, and so Conjoyn'd makes up one universal wo. Onely, as if love knew alone the art That taught his followers how to mourn apart, Sad, sweet Orlinda, whose calm innocence Had fostred passion at her healths expence, Whilst wet with grief's oreflowing springs, she to Her brothers ghost did pay soft natures due In sorrow of such sad complection, that Others might lose their own to wonder at; Yet when (as in the margint plac'd) she hears Amindor lost, with new supplies of tears Grief sallying forth, as if to be betray'd Love now did fear, he draws the bashfull Maid From those that did the mourning consort keep Where she unseen for loves decease doth weep, Frail womans faith, and mans neglect doth blame, And softly then sighs out Amindors name; Her lost Amindor, whose suppos'd disdain Destroy'd those spirits grief could ne'r have slain. And now before that powers decay ingage To many hands in a vindictive rage The wise supporters of the State to stay Increasing factions (which can ne'r obey
Lest fear commands) unto Almanzor send A mandate which injoyns him to attend Their Councels in this interregnum, till Their joynt consent had found out one to fill The empty throne: which summons prompted by A care which they interpret loyalty, Though truely call'd ambition, he obey'd With such a speed as Love would fly to aid A ravish'd Lady, having to impede His march no more then what his care could lead Even with a singes speed, yet that a strength Enough to make his will confine the length Of their desires, who soon in Council sit But to bewail th' abortion of their wit. The frighted City having entred in A mourning march, as if his thoughts had bin A stranger to the sad events of this So dismal night, he by relation is Inform'd of each particular, which he Seeming to hear in griefs extremity, From silent sorrow which appear'd to wait On still attention, his prepar'd deceit Disguis'd in rage appears, a rage which in Its active flight to finde what hearts had bin Defil'd with thoughts of such foul crimes, did seem So full of zeal, its actions did redeem The lost report of loyalty in those His former crimes made his most constant foes.
By guarded gates, and watchfull parties that Surround the walls, till th' people frighted at Their fury, shrink from publick throngs, they now Assur'd of safety, whilst enquiring how Hell hatch'd these monsters, whose original Whilst searching, they by the consent of all His best Physitians, whose experienc'd skill From outward signs, knew what internal ill Death struck the Prince, inform'd the cause could be From nought but such a subtil enemy As poyson, which when every accident They had examin'd, all conclude was sent Mixt with that cordial whose conceal'd receit Unknown to art, their envy term'd the bait To tempt the easie Princes faith into That net which death allur'd by treason, drew. With power from this imbrac'd suspition sprung Almanzor, who not envies spotted tongue Durst call prophane, though rudely forcing those Weak gates, which need no greater strength t'oppose Unclean intruders, then the reverence they, Inforc'd by zeal, did with Religion pay Unto that places sanctity, which he Contemning, ere the wrong'd societie Expecting such injurious visits, in Rude fury entring, those whose power had bin Imploy'd by noble pity to attend The suffring Princess, in such haste did send
Them to her close and dark abodes, that now Their doubts confirm'st, they're only studying how To shun that danger which informing fear Falsly perswades, towards them alone drew near. Which dark suspition, ere unclouded, by Seising on him whose innocence durst fly To no retreat, the Royal fugitives Back to the vault where first they enter'd, drives. Now at the great'st antipathie to Day The silent earth opprest with Midnight lay Vested in clouds, black as they had been sent To be the whole worlds mourning monument; When through the Caves damp womb, conducted by A doubtful light that scarce inform'd the eye To find out those unhaunted paths, they in A faint assurance, with soft pace begin To sally forth, where unsuspected, they Are seis'd by guards that in close ambush lay: Which ere amazement could give action leave To seek for safety, did their hopes deceive By close restraint, aw'd by whose power, they're to Almanzor brought, who from that object drew Such joy as fills usurpers when they see Wrong'd Princes strugling with captivitie. From hence in such disdainful silence led As taught their fear, from just suspition bred, To tremble at some unknown ill, about That sober time when Lights small lamps go out
At the approach of Days bright glories, brought Back to the Court, they there not long had sought Their sorrows sad original, before A Court conven'd of such whose power had bore Whilst (Gods own choice) a Monastry, had lent Their dictates law, the weight of government, They hither call'd by summons that did sound Like bold rebellion, in sad omen found More then they fear'd; A mourning train of Lords Plac'd round a black tribunal, that affords To the spectators penetrated eye A dismal horror cloath'd in majestie. Like hierogliphicks pointing to that fate Which must ensue, all yet in silence sate A dreadful silence, such as unto weak Beholders seem'd to threaten when they speak, Death and destruction dictates, when they saw Their Princess enter'd, as if rigid Law To loyal duty let the scepter fall In an obedient reverence rais'd, they all Lowly salute her, but that complement To bribe their pity, fear in vain had spent; When all resuming now their seats, command The Royal captives, whose just cause did stand On no defence but unknown truth to be Summon'd to th' bar, where that they first might see What rigor on the royal blood was shewn, From no unjust conspiracie had grown,
A sable curtain from their herses drawn Betrays her eyes then in the sickly dawn Of grief grown dim, unto that horrid place Where they met death drawn in her fathers face, By whom now turn'd into well-model'd clay, Fitted for's tomb the slain Epirot lay. At this, as if some over-venturous look For temperate rays, destructive fire had took In at her souls receiving portals, all Lifes functions ceas'd, sorrow at once lets fall The burthen of so many griefs, which in A death-like slumber had forgotten bin Till humane thoughts obliterated by The wish conversions of eternity Opprest no more, had not inurious haste Before this conflict could those spirits waste Which had, to shun passions external strife, Fled to the primum mobile of life, Recall'd with them her sorrows to attend Their nimblest motions, which too fast did spend Her strength, to suffer weakness to obay The Courts intentions of a longer stay. From ruffl'd passions which her soul opprest, By the soft hand of recollecting rest Strok'd to a calm, which setl'd reason in Her troubled throne; by those that first had bin Her guards, the Princess (that fair pattern, whence Men drew the height of humane excellence)
Is now return'd, to let her proud foes see That the bright rays of magnanimitie Though envy like th'ungrateful moon do strive To hide that sun, except what's relative Ne'r knows eclipse, the darkness taking birth From what's below, whilst that remov'd from earth, Her clear unclouded conscience ever stays Amongst bright vertues universal rays. The mourning Court (those ministers of fate) In expectation of their prisoners sate, They now appear in those disguises which They first were took, being habits, though not rich Enough to gild their rare perfections, yet Such as did seem by sorrow made to fit Their present sufferings; both the men cloth'd in Monastick robes, black as their threds had bin Spun from Peruvian wooll; the women clad Like mournful Votaries, shew'd so sweetly sad, As if their vertues which injurious fate Did yet conceal, striving t' anticipate The flights of time, had to th' external sence Shew'd these as emblems of their innocence. But love, nor pity, though they both did here Within their Judges sternest looks appeare, Durst plead for favor; their indictments read So guilty sound, that those whose hearts even bled, Disdain'd their eyes should weep, since justice did In such foul crimes mercy as sin forbid.
Yet more to clear what circumstance had made Level with reason, from th' approaching shade Of death redeem'd, that Lord whose wounds had bin But slumbers to recover safety in When the Messenian murdred was, did now Declare as far as reason could allow The eyes to judge, those habits which they then Did wear the same wch cloath'd the murth'rers when His Prince was slain; which open proof appears So full of guilt it stops her friends kinde fears Ere rais'd to hope, and in appearance shews A guilt, which all but pitty overgrows. The vext Epirots who for comfort saw Revenge appearing in the form of Law Retir'd, to feed their spleen with hope until Th' extent of Justice should their vengeance fill; When now by accusations that denide Access to pity, for a Paracide The Princess question'd, whose too-weak defence Being but the unseen guards of innocence, Submits to censure; yet to shew that all Those scatter'd pearls, which from her eyes did fall Dropt not t' attempt their charity, but shew That no injurious storm could overslow Her world of Reason, which exalted stood Above the surface of the spacious stood, Her tears for grief, not guilt, being shed, whilst in The robes of magnaminity, not sin
Grown impudent, her brave resolv'd soul sate Unshaken in this Hyrocane of sate. To meet her calm (which like religion drest Doth all become, but female vertues best) The rough Amindor, whose discolour'd face Anger did more then native beauty grace, Since justly rais'd, disdaining thus to be By a Plebian base captivity Forc'd to submit his innocence unto Their doubtfull test, had from his anger drew A ruine swifter then their hate intends, Had not his rage, whilst it toward danger bends, Been taught by her example to exclude Vain passions with a Princely fortitude, Whose usefull aid (like those good works which we For comforts call in deaths necessity) Brought all their better Angels to defend Them from those terrors which did death attend. In busie whispers, which discover'd by Their doubtfull looks the thoughts variety, Long in sad silence sate the Court, until Those noiseless streams of fancy which did fill Each several brest united by consent Want onely now a tongue so impudent As durst condemn their Soveraign, which being in Theumantius found, a Lord whose youth had been By favor nurs'd, till power's wild beast grown rude Repays his Fost'rer with ingratitude.
This bold, bad man, Loves most unhappy choice, From flatteries Treble now exalts his voice Without the mean of an excuse, into The Laws loud Base; and what those fear'd to doe That had been favour'd less, that black decee Pronounc'd, which discords all the harmonie Of subject fear, and soveraign love, by what Succeeding ages justly trembl'd at Whilst innocent, but have of late been grown So bad to shew such monsters of their own. This sentence past, which knew no more allay Of mercy, then what lets their judgments stay From following life to deaths obscure retreat, Till twenty nights had made their days compleat, The Court breaks up; yet ere from publick vew To close restraint the Royal captives drew, Grant them this favor from their rigid laws, That if there durst, to vindicate their cause, In that contracted span of time appear Any whose forward valor durst indear The peoples love and prayers, so much to be Their Champion, that his victory should free Them from that dooms strict rigor; to oppose Which brave Attempter, they Almanzor chose (Since high command that honor did afford To him alone) to weild the answering sword. Now near departing, whilst the Cyprian in A brave disdain, which for submissive sin
Looks on an answer, as his haste would show An anger that did scorn to stoop so low To strike with threats, stands silent, whilst that she Whose temper heaven had made too calm to be By rage transported, with a soul unmov'd By stormy passions, thus their sin reprov'd. Should I (my Lords) here with a female haste Discharge my passions, 'twere (perhaps) to waste My prayers, or threats, whilst one you would not fear, Nor th'other pity: But when heaven shall clear This curtain'd truth, wrapt in whose cloudy night, Unjustly you, from my unquestion'd right By birth, obedience, into faction stray, Then (though too late) untimely sorrow may Strive by repentance to expunge these stains Cast on your honor. These exhausted vains, Fixt eyes, pale cheeks, deaths dismal trophies, in This royal face I now could not have seen With a less sorrow then had serv'd to call Me to attend him, had not the rude fall Of your unjustice, like those dangerous cures Perform'd by tutning into Calentures Dull Lethargies, upon my heart laid hold In such a flame of passion, as the cold Approach of death wants power to quench until You add that crime to this preceding ill. Yet (though no fear can prompt my scorn to crave A subjects mercy for my self) to save
This Noble Stranger, whose just acts being crost By misconstruction, have their titles lost, I shall become your suppliant, lest there be A sin contracted by his serving me; And onely in such noble wayes as might Unveil themselves to th' suns Meridian light; Sure he unjustly suffers, which may cause You want more swords to vindicate your Laws Then his you late elected to make good Your votes, ere scarce cleans'd of that loyal blood He in rebellion shed; but I am now Too near my fatal period to allow Disturbing passion any place within My peacefull soul: what ere his crimes have been In publick war, or private treason, may Kinde Heaven, when with th' injustice of this day Those shall be strictly question'd, to prevent Their doom, conceal them in the large extent Of mercies wings, which there may prove so kinde To you, though here I can no justice finde. This spoken in a garb that did detect A sorrow which was ripened to neglect, She silent stands, whilst through the thick resort Of throng'd Spectators, toward the rising Court Orlinda comes, with such a haste as shew'd That service she by Love's allegiance ow'd; Love, which had sorrows sable wings out-fled To mourn the living, not lament the dead;
Come where her fears (now near lost) object she Within the shadow of the Grave might see By sentence shut, neglecting death that lay In ambush there her reason to betray To hate, when by the false informing Law, Her Friend she as her brother's murtherer saw In actions such as Scythian Tyrants feel Some softness from, she that ne'r us'd to kneel Too ought but heaven, a lowly suppliant falls Before the Court, from whose stern brests she calls So much of sorrow as perhaps had strook Them all with horror, if a sudden look Obliquely on her murther'd brother cast, Had not ere Love assaulted with her last And powerfull'st pray'rs, whilst hot with action in A cool retreat of spirits, silenc'd bin. She fainting faln, as an addition to Their former grief, is from the throng withdrew Into the free untainted air, where by Assisting Friends which gently did apply Their needfull aid, heat, which was then grown slack In Natures work, antipathy calls back To beauties frontiers, where like bashfull light It in a blush meets the Spectators sight But such a one, as ere full blown is by Her Friends disasters forc'd again to fly Beneath those clouds of grief, whose swelling pride Spread by report, did now not onely hide
The Court or City, but to bear a part Of that sad load, summons each Subjects heart. Whilst now the Prisoners, ere the peoples love To anger turn, the active Guards remove To still the clamorous multitude, who sway'd By various passions, did whilst each obey'd Opinions dictates, but in darkness rove At shadow'd truth, whence now they boldly strove To pluck the vail from Declarations that Contain'd those falshoods, which whilst wondring at They wept to force upon their faith, are sent Through th' Lands each Town, & Armies Regiment; By which Almanzor, who attempted in This plot to joyn security with sin, Doubting if ere this story reach his ear, Argalia might their combatant appear, Besides those stains which common fame did take For sins just debts, sliely attempts to shake The heaven-erected fabrick of his love By closer engines, such as seem'd to move On noble pity, which with grief ingrost That faith which envy in disdain had lost. Black rumor, on the wings of rais'd report Flying in haste, had soon attain'd the Court Of the amaz'd Aetolian Prince, who hears The dreadfull story with such doubtfull fears As shook his noble soul, but not into An easie faith, each circumstance was true,
He knew Almanzor's vilany to be Of that extent so foul a progenie, As all those horrid murthers might from thence Take easie birth: but when the innocence Of's vertuous Princess, and his honor'd Friend The noble Cyprian Prince, come to contend With oft confirm'd report, that strikes a deep And solemn grief, yet such as must not keep A firm possession in his soul, until A further inquisition either kill His yet unfainting hopes, or raise them to Joy by confirming those reports untrue. The End of the Fourth Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO V. The Argument. I. Through royal blood to level that dark way Which Rebels pass unto the injur'd throne, Pharonnida is now condemn'd to pay A debt for crimes that none durst call her own. II. When near the last step, brave Argalia, who In close disguise truths secrets had betraid, When most did doubt 'twas now too late to sue To heaven for pity, brings a timely aid. IF on those vanisht Heroes that are fled Through the unknown dark Chasma's of the dead, To rest in regions so remote from hence Twixt them and life there's no intelligence, When ere thou look'st through times dim optiques, then Brave emulation of those braver men,
Rouses (that ray of heav'n) thy soul to be A sharer in their fames eternity; Thou'st then a genius fit to entertain A Muses flight, which may be rais'd again To sing thy actions, when there's left no more Of thee, but what by life, whilst passing ore Natures short stage, had either scatter'd bin By careless youth, or firmly planted in Maturer age, whose wasted talent spent, (Those were his Friends, this is his monument) Is all, except some Muse thy life records, That to thy worth, th' unthankful world affords. But if thy uninspired soul do beare A lower sail, which flagging with the care Of humid pleasures, ne'r is swell'd into Sublimer thoughts, then such as onely view Earth for its object, which ne'r yet did lend Her favorites more then what they here do spend T' improve her barren wants, may none rehearse Thy name (beneath the dignity of verse) But trivial flatterers, such as strive to gain Thy favor from Ephemera's of the brain Unsalted jests, pleas'd at whose painted fire I leave fond thee in vapor to expire, Whilst from thy living shadow I return To crown the dust in brave Argalia's urn. From common fame (that wild impostor) he Had often heard what Love deny'd should be
For truth admitted, his Pharonnida Accus'd for sins which envy strove to draw Objects for heavens severest wrath, and now Ere his considerate judgment would allow Report for real, secret Messengers To Corinth sends, who ill inform'd, transfers His further trouble, in confirming what Whilst others wept for, he transported at So sad a change in her whose vertue had Inflam'd his thoughts, by passion near unclad His soul of all his robes of lesh, which now So loosely hung, as if she practic'd how To strip her self, should unexpected death To heavens hard course, call forth the nimble breath. Could earth here conquer, or had it within The power of whatsoever is mortal bin T' have wrought disorders of amazement where The noble soul such true consent did beare With the harmonious Angels, he in all His acts like them appears, or (ere his fall) Perhaps like man, that he could onely be Distinguish'd from some hollow'd hierarchie, By being cloath'd in the specifick vail Of flesh and blood, this grief might then prevail Over his perfect temper; but he bears These weights, as if unfelt, on his soul wears The sable robes of sorrow, whilst his cheek Is drest in scarle smiles; no frown his sleek
And eaven front contract, like to a slow And quiet stream his obscur'd thoughts did flow With greater depths then could be fathom'd by The beamy lines of a judicious eye. Whilst those good Angels which fond men call wit, Reform'd by age, did all in Council sit, To steer those thoughts by which he did attend Pharonnida's escape, they to this end At length reduc'd his Councils, that he must To succor her leave groveling in the dust His Kingdom, which being by domestick strife Late wounded, was but newly rubb'd to life: Yet since that there to her redemption lay In all the progress of his thoughts no way Less full of danger, such of's Lords as he Honor'd for age, and prais'd for loyalty, Call'd to a secret Council, he discovers His fixt resolves, which they, though now no Lovers, With such consenting souls did hear, that though They knew his danger might ev'n fear outgrow, They to oppose that scourge of cowards brings His vows, his sacred vows, those scepter'd Kings Which justly rule the conscience, that aw'd by Usurping fear submits to Tyranny. Their first proposals, whence their judgment sought To hide his absence, to conclusion brought, They thence proceed to level him a way Through that thick swarm of Enemies that lay
Circling the walls, where reason stayes a while In various censure, ere 't could reconcile Their diff'ring judgments, but at length in this (As that which in this dangers dark abiss Seems to lend fear most of the helpfull light Of hope) concludes, that when succeeding night With strength of age was grown so gravely staid, That dark designs fear'd not to be betraid By th' wanton twilight, he in close disguise, Whilst some of's troops diverted by surprise His watchful foes, might pass their guards, which don, Their care might be, with's surther march begun. In dismal darkness, that black throne of fear, Nights silent Empress, aw'd the Hemisphear; When now Argalia's ready troops, with slow And noiseless marches issued through their low Close Salliports, are swiftly rallied by Such as had long taught valor how to dy For honors rescue; Captains that had bin From youth's first bud, till age was reverenc'd in Her honor'd scars, such strict disciples to Wars hardest precepts, that their fame out-grew Their power, which that had so authentick made Where fear was scorn'd, they were for love obay'd▪ By these brave Hero's, which had often led Armies to sleep in honors purple bed, The Prince assisted, was with secret haste, By wayes where fear no Centinel had plac'd,
Drawn near the Leagure, which th' alarum took From a storm'd Fort, had with such speed forsook Their huts, that haste which was intended to Preserve, being now to wild confusion grew, Helps to destroy: In undistinguish'd sounds, Which not inform, but frighted sense confounds With wild amazement, the unnoted words Even of command are lost; no ear affords Room for advice, nor the most serious eye A place for order; Ensignes vainly flye Since unperceiv'd through the dark air, which in A storm ne'r knew more tumult then had bin Since first their fear on this alarum fled From Reason, through the troubled Leaguer spread. In this loud horror, whilst they need no lamp To guide them more then their own flaming Camp, His frighted foes (fled from their quarter) lend The Prince some hope this sudden charge might end Their slow-pac'd siege; yet since approaching day Perswading haste, denies his longer stay, The power to those Commanders left, which he For valor knew might force from victory Unwilling laurels, though their judgment such, Those hallowed wreaths they ne'r durst rashly touch' He leaves (when first his sword, which none did spare Within its reach, had of his being there Left bloody marks) the conquer'd foes, to finde Out sterner foes in his afflicted minde,
Which since usurping doubt with peaceful love For empire strove, taught passion how to move In spheres so differing from his reasons right Ascension, that his cares protracted night From this oblique position caus'd, had made His sorrow tedious, as those nights which shade Cold Artick regions, when the absent sun Doth underneath th'Antartick tropick run. This passage forc'd through his obstructive foes, That now the treacherous day might not disclose Him whilst unguarded, to their view that might In larger troops persue a baser flight Through deep dark paths, which ne'r to th'sun had shown Their uncouth shades, being to all unknown Save neighb'ring rurals, he conducted by A faithful guide, directs his liberty Towards stately Corinth, near whose confines ere Six morning dews had cool'd the hemisphere, Arriv'd in safety, that kind heaven might bless His future actions with desir'd success To seek to them, he first sought those, that in The wane of's blood had lifes supporters bin, Those holy Hermites to whose art he ow'd For life, next heaven which first that gift bestow'd. Come to their quiet Cell, where all receive Him with a wonder that did hardly leave A room for welcom, till their fear had in A full relation of his fortune bin
Chang'd for as much of sanguine mirth as they Could know, that had Religions cool allay To check delight, he being retir'd with him Whose first discoveries in his fortunes dim Imperfect light directed him to know His royal off-spring, lets his language flow With so much freedom as discovers what, Whilst he by active war was aiming at His Kingdoms safety, call'd him thence to save Sweet vertue from an ignominious grave. The fatal story heard by him, whose love Fixt by religion, passion could not move, Although he pitied all th'afflicted, to More softness then what had its off-spring drew From heav'ns strict precepts which are then mispent When easie man mistakes the innocent: Since what permits hypocrisie to win Remorse, by mercy doth but cherish sin. Which to avoid, ere his consent approve Of the design, neglecting all which Love Prompted by pity could alleage to draw Him to the combat, though he in it saw Nought to defend but innocence, since in That shape deluded, charity hath bin Too oft deceiv'd, that his victorious sword Might not but where fair justice could afford Vict'rie be drawn, he, like a Pharos plac'd 'Mongst rocks of doubt, thus rectifies his haste.
Take heed, brave Prince, that in this doubtful way 'Twixt love and honor thy bright vertues stray Not from Religions latitude, into More dangerous stations, Reasons slender clew Is here too short to guide thee, and may in Its conduct but obliquely lead to sin. Be cautious then, and rashly venture not On unknown depths, where valor seems begot By vain presumption: Mortal beauty, that Imperfect type of heaven, though wonder'd at, Yet may not be so much ador'd to make Our passions heavens directing road mistake. Though thy affections were legitimate As mans first choice, since in that happy state Of innocence frail woman then found out A way to fall, still let thy reason doubt The same deceit, since that affected she Which thou ador'st, yet wears mortalitie; A garment which since ma first wore, hath bin But once cast off without some spots of sin. Yet know, my councel strives not to prevent Thy swords assisting of the innocent; As much of mercy on neglect being spilt, As there's got vengeance from presumptuous guilt Only before thy valor dares to tread This rubick path, whose slipp'ry steps have led So oft to ruine, let Religion be Thy prompter unto so much policie,
As may secure thy conscience; which to do, Claim my assistance as thy vertues due. The grateful Prince with lowly looks had paid His thankful offerings, when, that promis'd aid Might not fall short of expectation, he Whose words (like vows that hold affinitie With heav'n) breath'd nought but constant truth, did thus Proceed towards action; whilst (lov'd Prince) with us Of this poor Covent, you, by wounds restrain'd From action liv'd, you know that what's contain'd In our calm doctrine, gives us leave to be So intimate with each societie, No secret, though maskt in the clouds of sin, Flies those discoveries which informs us in Their last confessions; by which means you may Know whether justice calls your sword to pay These bloody offerings as a victim to Th'appeasing of an inward vertue due. By this advice instructed to convince What love suggests, the apprehensive Prince, Since this includes nothing but what's too just To disobey, although he all mistrust Of her like sin avoids, consents to be Rul'd by his Council, whose assistance he So oft successful found; which, that delay (That slow-pac'd sin) might not obstruct the way With times too oft neglected loss, he now So fast toward action hastes, they could allow
The night scarce time to steal a dark retreat, Ere having left that melancholy seat, Devotions dark retiring place, he goes To see how much her frowns did discompose That Cities dress, of whom he'd ne'r a sight Before, but when 'twas polish'd with delight. His Arms (bright Honors burnisht robes) into Such weeds as shew'd him to the publick view A course Monastick, chang'd, attended by His aged friend, soon as the mornings eye Adorn'd the East, the prosp'rous Prince begun His pious journey, which, before the sun Blusht in the West, found a successful end In clouded Corinth, where arriv'd, they spend The hours of the succeeding night to find How, in that factious troubl'd sea, inclin'd The City stood, whose shallow sons dare vent By nothing but their tongues, that discontent Their hands might cure, were not those useful parts Restrain'd from action by unmanly hearts, Which being at once with grief and fear opprest, Durst do no more but pity the distrest; Which gentle passion, since so general, lends Some light of hope to her enquiring friends. To usher in that dismal day, whose light Design'd to lead into eternal night As much of beauty as did ere give place To death, the morning shews her gloomy face
Wrapt up in clouds, whose heavy vapors had Hung heaven in black, when, to perform the sad And serious office of onfessors to Those royal sufferers, whom harsh fates persue To deaths dark confines, through their guard of foes Argalia and his grave assistant goes; Where he whose love to neither did surmount His zeal, to take the Cyprians last account Himself addrest, whilst his kind passions lead Argalia from Pharonnida, to read Her lifes last story, made authentick by The near approach of her eternity. Enter'd the room, which to his startl'd ight Appear'd like sorrow sepulcher'd in night, So dismal sad, so silent, that the cold Retreat of death, the grave, did ne'r unfold A heavier object, by a sickly light Which was even then to th' artificial night That fill'd the room resigning'ts reign, he saw Griefs fairest draught, divine Pharonnida, Amidst her tears, faln like a full-blown flower, Whose polisht leaves oreburthen'd with a shower, Drops from their beauties in the pride of day' To deck the earth, so sadly pining lay The pensive Princess, whom an extasie O passion led to practise how to die In such abstracted contemplations, that Angels forsook their thrones to wonder at.
Wet with those tears, in whose Elixar she Was bathing of the Lilies nurserie, Her bloodless cheeks; her trembling hand sustan'd A book, which what heavens mercy hath ordain'd For a support to humane frailty in Storms of affliction, lay; which, as she'd bin Now so well in repentant lectures read, That faith was on the wings of knowledge fled To meditation, her unactive grief Lets softly fall, whilst Time, wise natures thief, That all might look like sorrows swarthy night, Is stealing forth of the neglected Light; Whose sullen flame, as it would sympathize With those quencht beams that once adorn'd her eys After a feeble blaze that spoke its strife But vain, in silence weeps away its life. Come to behold this beauteous monument Of mourning passion, his great spirits spent On love and wonder, the astonish'd Prince Here silent stands, valor could not convince His wild amazement: To behold her lie By rigid laws restrain'd from libertie, To whom his soul was captive, troubles all His reasons guards: But when, how she must fall From beauteous youth, and vertuous life, to be One of the graves obscure societie, Must fall no Martyr, whose lamented death Grows pities object, but depart with breath
'Mongst ignominious clouds of guilt, that must Stick an eternal odium on her dust; That thought transports him from his temper to Passions, in which he had forgot to do His Priestly office, and, in rage as high As ever yet inflam'd humanitie, Sent him to actions, whose attempt had bin The rode his valor must have perish'd in, Had not her sorrows agony forsook The Princess, by whose first unsteady look He, being as far as his disguise gave leave, Discover'd, is invited to receive Those last confessions, in whose freedom she Seeks by absolving comforts how to free Her soul of all which a religious fear Like spots on her white conscience made appear. Having from her unburthen'd soul learnt how To ease his own, the Priestly Prince had now As far as bold humanitie durst dive Into remission, heavens prerogative, Pronounc'd that pardon for whose seal there stood The sin-polluted worlds redeeming blood: By which blest voice rais'd from what did appear Like sorrow, till her faith had banish'd fear, The Princess in such gentle calms of joy As souls that wear their bodies but to cloy Celestial lights can feel, to entertain Her fatal doom with a resolv'd disdain
Of death prepares, whilst he whom heaven to her Had made their mercies happy Messenger, Forsaking her, repairs to him that had With the same hand the Cyprians thoughts unclad: By whom inform'd, how that in their defence His sword protected nought but innocence, Arm'd with those blessings which so just a cause Proclaim'd his due, he secretly withdraws To change those emblems of Religious peace, Monastick robes, for such as might increase Their joy and wonder, whose contracted fear Despair'd to see a Combatant appear, Although they knew his sword defended then The best of causes 'gainst the worst of men. Whilst he prepares with near as much of speed As incorporeal substances that need But will for motion, to defend her in Th' assaults of death, that hour which long had bin The dreadfull expectation of those friends That pitied her, arriv'd, in sorrow ends Fears cold disease; those Ministers of fate, The props to all that's illegitimate, The Army, to suppress the weak essayes Of love or pity, guarded had the wayes By which illegal power conducted her From that dark room, griefs curtain'd Theater, To be beheld upon the publick stage, The glory, yet the scandal of the age▪
Which two extreams met on the scaffold in A Princess suffering, and a peoples sin: Which now, join'd to the dreadful pomp that cals His Subjects to attend the funerals Of her lov'd father, whose lifes vertues won Tears for his death, thus solemnly begun. Remov'd no further from the City then An hours short walk, though undertaken when Sol rag'd in Cancer might with ease convay Scorcht travellers, a dismal temple lay In a dark vally, where more antient times Had perpetrated those religious crimes Of humane offerings to those Idols that Their hands made, for their hearts to tremble at, Yet this, since now made venerable by Those reverend reliques of antiquity, The Spartan Princes monuments, by those Of later times, though alter'd faith, is chose For their retreat, when lifes extinguisht glory Sought rest beneath a silent dormitory. Nor stood this fabrick all alone; long since A Palace by some melancholy Prince Which hated light, or lov'd the darkness, built To please his humor, or conceal his guilt, So near it stood, to distant eyes which sent Thither their beams, it seem'd one monument, Whose sable roof 'mongst Cypress shadows fills The deep dark basis of those barren hills
With such a mournfull Majesty as strook A terror into each beholders look, Awfull as if some Diety had made That gloomy vale to be the sacred shade Where he chose in enigma's to relate The dark decrees of mans uncertain fate. Betwixt this temple and the City stood In squadrons thick as shews an ancient wood To distant sight, the Army, plac'd to be In this sad march their guilts securitie Whose glittering swords shon, as if drawn to light Dayes beauties to the palace of the night; Toward which, the prisoners, yet detain'd within The City, in this dreadfull pomp begin Their mournful march, led by that doleful call By which loud war proclaims a funeral: Those that had been the common guards unto The murther'd Princes, to the peoples view Are first presented, on an ebon spear Each bore a scuchion, where there did appear The arms which once adorn'd those Princes shields Sadly display'd within their sable fields. Next these, some troops whose prosperous valor in Their Courts had steps unto preferment bin, Come slowly on, but slowlier follow'd are By elder Captains, such whom busie war Whose victories had their youth in honor di'd, As useless-now for Council laid aside:
I' th' rear of these the Officers of State, Grave as they'd been of Council unto Fate, I' th' purple robes of royal Mourners clad, With heavy pace conducted in a sad And dismal object, two black Chariots drawn Like hideous night when it assaults the dawn In dreadfull shadows, where to fright the day With sadder objects, on black herses lay Th' Effigies of the murther'd Princes, in Whose form those spots of treason that had bin Fates Agents, to unravel Natures law, In bloody marks the mourning people saw, At which sad fight from silent sorrow they Advanc'd had let external grief betray Their love, and loss, if not diverted by Succeeding objects, which assault the eye With what, though living, yet more terror bred. Then what they found for the lamented dead, In such a garb as sorrow strives to hide The hot efluviums of a sullen pride, Almanzor next, with slow portentous pace Follows the herses, his discover'd face So subtilly di'd in sorrow as it had Strove to out-mourn the sable arms which clad His falser breast, whose studi'd treason knew No such disguise, as first to meet the view O' th' censuring people in a dress that shews Him by their States maturer Council chose
'Gainst who'ere durst maintain the pris'ners cause By's valor for to vindicate their laws. But now, to lose these rivolets of tears In the vast Ocean of their grief, appears Their last, and most lamented object in The royal Captives, whose sad fate had bin Not so disguis'd in attributes of guilt, But that the love their former vertue built In every breast, broke through their fear to show How much their duty did to sorrow ow. In that black train they had beheld before, Though full of sadness, wearied life past ore The stage of nature, is their darkest text To comment on, which since good men perplext With life's cares are, finds less regre then now To living sufferers justly they allow: Friends though less near (since death is but that rest They vainly seek that are in life distrest) Being pitied more then those whose worst of Fate We have beheld destruction terminate. That nought might in this scene of sorrow be Wanting to perfect griefs solemnitie The Kingdoms Marshal, who supported in His hand a sword, which glitring through a thin Wreath'd Cipers, through the sad Spectators eye Strook such a terror as if shadow'd by Death's sooty vail; conducting after goes Th' undaunted Cyprian, with a look that showes
A soul whose valor was of power to light Such high resolves as by their splendor might Make death look lovely; on his upper hand Her sexes glory, she whose vertues scann'd Her actions by heavens strictest rules, the swee Pharonnida, unmov'd prepares to meet The ministers of death, her train being by Florenza, who must in that Tragedy Act her last part, sustain'd. The garment which The beauteous Princess did that day inrich Was black, but cut on white, ore which the fair Neglected treasure of her flowing hair Hung loosely down; upon her head she wore A wreath of Lillies, almost shadow'd ore With purple Hyacinths, on which the stains Of murther yet in bloody marks remains; Over all this a melancholy cloud Of thick curl'd Cipers from the head did shroud Her to the feet, through which those spots of white Appear'd like stars, those comforts of the night, When stole through scattred clouds; in her right hand She held a watch whose next stage should have spand The minutes of her life; her left did hold A branch of mirtle, which as grown too old To live, began to wither, for defence O' th' falling leaves, as death and innocence Had both conspir'd to save 't; the bow was round In mistick wreaths of black and silver wound.
Near to the royal Prisoners, many Peers Of either Kingdom, men of th' gravest years And loyal'st hearts, did with a dolefull pace Bring up the rear, each melancholy place Through which they past, being with those pensive flowers That wait on funerals strew'd. The lofty towers Of checquer'd marble had their stately brows In sables bound, their pinacles with boughs Of dismal Yew adorn'd, as if their knell Should next be rung, a solemn passing bell In every Church was toull'd, whose dolefull sound Mixt with the drum & trumpets dead march, dround The peoples cries, whose grief can ne'r be shown In 'ts native dress, till loud and clamorous grown. In this black pomp the mourning train had left The sable City, which being now bereft Of all her sad and solemn guests, did bear The emblem of an empty sepulchre, So full of silence, all her throng being gone With heavy pace to be attendants on Those funeral rights, which ere perform'd must have More vertue for attendants to the grave Then ere they could again expect to see, Whose hopes of life lay in minoritie. Come to the desert vale, which yet had kept A solitary loveliness that slept There in untroubl'd rest, a levell'd green Chose for the Lists, which nature lodg'd between
Two barren hills, upon whose bare front grew (Though thinly scatter'd) here a balefull Yew, And there a dismal Cypress, plac'd as they Had onely chose that station to display The peoples passions, who with eyes fixt in Full orbs of tears, ere this had sorrowing seen The pitied prisoners, to those Scaffolds brought Where those lamented lives whose treason sought To ruine must be sacrific'd to please, Ambitious man, not angry heaven appease, This curles their bloods, which soon inflam'd had grown Had not the varied scene of sorrow shown The murther'd Princes, who product, as they Had been reserv'd as opiats to allay Their angers flame, are both expos'd unto The satisfaction of the publick view, Mounted on herses, which on either side O' th' Temple gate with deaths most dismal pride On ebon pillars stood, as rais'd to show What justce did to their destruction ow. Plac'd near to these, their sorrows sad Records, Almanzors tent, to shew that it affords For red revenge a close reception, stood Like a black rock from whence in clouds of blood The sanguine streamers through the thickned sky Did waving with unconstant motion fly, In view of which, though at the other end If any durst appear that could defend
Their cause, whom heaven alone knew innocent, There to receive him stood an empty Tent, Whose outside, as if fanci'd to deter His entrance, there appear'd a Sepulcher Over whose gate her false Accusers had Transcrib'd those crimes which so unustly clad In purples sins those spotless ouls; which seen In their bright vertues candid robes had been The hated wonders of those foes, whose ends Now finde success i' th' pity of their friends. Near this black tent, on mourning scaffolds, where Death did t' encounter innocence prepare His heaviest darts, such as were headed by That more then mortal plague, foul infamy, The prisoners mounted; at the other gate Almanzor, like the messenger of Fate Fraught with revenge appears, his dreadfull form More full of terror then a midnight storm To straitned Fleets, appearing to the view O' th' multitude, who whilst their prayers persue The prisoners safety on the flagging wings Of sickly hope, his sure destruction brings, Since from their knowledge more remote to cure, Unto their hates impatient calenture. Thrice had the trumpet sadly sounded bin And thrice a Herald's voice had summon'd in Some bold defendant; but both yet so vain, As if just Heaven neglected to maintain
That righteous cause, which sadly seen of all, The sorrowfull, but helpless people fall Since hopes of life was shrunk into despair, To be assistant by their private prayer At deaths distracting conflict; in a brief Effectual speech, which answer'd to the chief Heads of's indictment, in those powerfull words Conceiv'd his last, the Cyprian Prince affords Their sorrow yet a larger Theam; which done, Being first to die, having with prayer begun That doubfull road, he now a short leave takes Of all his mourning Friends, then calmly shakes Off each terrestial thought, and heightned by The speculations of eternity, Above those damps which natures hand did weave Of humane fear, submitting to receive The fatal stroke, that Center to a crown, But orb of wit, his sacred head layes down. Fled to the dark cell of their utmost fears With eyes whose lids were cemented in tears, Each still Spectators thoughts did now repair To the last refuge of a silent prayer: In which close parl, from that deep Lethargy They are to joy and wonder waken'd by A trumpets voice, which from the other gate Sounds a defiance; 'twas not yet so late In hopes dim twilight, but they once more may In expectation of a glorious day
Dare look abroad: which done, unto their view A Cyprian Herald being design'd unto That office, they leading a stranger Knight Into the Lists behold, whose welcom sight Was entertain'd with acclamations, that Rais'd thunder for his foes to tremble at. This valiant Hero, whose brave gesture gave Life to that hope which told them heaven would save Such suffering vertue, now drawn near unto The tent, is taking a disdainful view Of that accurst inscription, whilst all eyes Center'd on him, see through his steel-disguise A goodlier shape, though not so vastly great As that curst lump nature had made the seat Of's enemies black soul: The armor which He wore, they knew not whether for more rich, Or rare to prize; the ground of it, as he For those had mourn'd, which now from infamie His sword sought to redeem, was black, but all Enamell'd ore with silver-hearts, let fall From flaming clouds, which hovering above Them, look'd like incense fir'd by heavenly love. 'Mongst these in every vacant place was found A deaths-head scatter'd, some of which were crown'd With laurel, others on their bare fronts wore A regal diadem; in's shield he bore In a Field argent on the dexter side A new-made Grave, to which a Lamb deni'd
Succor on earth, to shun the swift persuit Of a fierce wolf, was fled; but ere one foot Was enter'd there, from a red cloud that charg'd The field in chief, a thunderbolt inlarg'd By heav'ns just wrath, from's sulphrie seat was sent So swiftly, that what sav'd the innocent, The guilty slew, which now in's blood doth lie A President for powerful tyrannie. Those short surveys o' th' people hardly took, Ere having now th'unuseful tent forsook, The brave Defendant with a loud salute Had past the scaffold in the bold persuit Of glorious vict'rie, whom his angry foe Whose valors flame ne'r an allay did know So cold as fear, in that wild flame which rage Oppos'd had kindl'd, hastens to engage Him with so high a storm of fury, that Each falling stroke, others did tremble at What they sustain'd. Strength, valor, judgment, all Which ere made Conquerors stand, or conquer'd fall, Here seem'd to meet: As it t'outrun desire, Each nimble stroke quick as ethereal fire, When wing'd by motion fell, yet with a heft So full of danger, most behind them left Their bloody marks, which in this fatal strife Seem'd like the open'd salliports of life. Sadly expecting whom by fate would be This day chose favorite unto destinie,
The people in such silent extasies, As if their souls only inform'd their eyes, Sate to behold the combat; when to give Their faith assurance justice yet did live Unchain'd by faction, from a fatal blow Strook near his heart, Almanzor faln so low From hopes of vict'rie they beheld, that in His ruine, what before their fear had bin Grew now their comfort, when that speedy death Might not transport his soul ere his last breath Confest his guilt; the noble Champion stays His just rais'd rage, whilst his own tongue displays His thoughts black curtains, by discovering all Those crimes beneath whose burthen he did fall, Heavy as curses which from heaven are sent For th' peoples plague, or Princes punishment: In which short close of life, to ease the grief Of late repentance, that successful Thief Whose happiest hour his latest prov'd, being took For president, he in a calm forsock That world, which, whilst his plots did strive to build Ambition high, he had with tempests fill'd. The multitude, whose universal voice Had taught even such, though distant, to rejoice, As age or sickness had detain'd within The City-walls, forc'd those that yet had bin Her foes (converted by the general votes For joy) to change their envies ill set notes
To calm compliance, in whose concord they With as much speed as duty did convey Her best of subjects, to congratulate Her freedom hastes, who in this smile of fate, ilst all her friends strove to forget those fears Whose form they lately trembl'd at, appears Shadow'd in grief, on whose joy could reflect No beam of comfort, the suppos'd neglect Of her Argalia, whose victorious sword Did in her fears extremity afford Some hopes of comfort, which t'opinion lost More sorrow then th'assaults of death had cost; Had not, whilst she did in dark passion stray, His full discovery glorifi'd the day. Amidst the peoples acclamations, she Though from a scaffold now convey'd to be Rais'd to a Crown, all that vain pomp beholds With eyes orecast in grief, till he unfolds Her further comfort, by discovering what Whilst each spectator was admiring at, Becomes to her so much of joy, that in This calm, that courage which before had bin Unshook in tempests now begins to move, And what scorn'd hate, submits to powerful Love; From whose fixt centre, with as swift a flight And kind a welcom, as the nimble light Salutes the morning, pleasure now imparts Her powerful beams, until those neighboring hearts
That liv'd by hopes thin diet, drew from hence Substantial lines to joys circumference. Her innocence unvail'd by his success, And both by that black foil of wickedness, Almanzor's guilt, more glorious made, is now The only volume wonder could allow Those that before her worst of foes had bin, Sadly to read repentant lectures in: Which seen by her observant Peers, that all Succeeding discords in that Tyrants fall Might find a tomb, him, being their Princess choice, The Spartan Armies universal voice Salute their Chief, which President affords A pattern to the wise Epirot Lords, Who had a law age made authentick, which Prohibited their diadem t'enrich A female brow, on him, whose title stood Nearest of all collateral streams of blood; They wisely fix a choice, which proves to be Their glory, and their States securitie. And now rais'd from that lowly posture in Which fear had left them, the vast rout begin Their motion toward fair Ghieranza, where The varied scene did such proportion bear With joy's exalted harmonie, which in Their rescu'd Princess dwelt, all that had bin Their sorrows dismal characters they now Obliterate, and her late clouded brow
Crown with delights. The solemn bells whose sad Toll, when they left your mourning City, had Frighted the trembling hearer, now are all Rung out for joy, as if so loud a call Only becom'd a love which could not be Exprest until the full solemnitie Of their approaching nuptials did unite Their hearts or crowns, not with more full delight Then what did near as great a blessing prove (Discording subjects) in your bonds of love. Thus after all the wild varietie Through Fates dark labyrinths, now arriv'd to be Crown'd with as much content as ere was known By any that death did enforce to own The frailties of mortality, we leave Our celebrated Lovers to receive Those blessings which heaven on such Kings showers down, Whose vertues add a lustre to the Crown. FINIS.
