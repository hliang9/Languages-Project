VOX STELLARUM: OR, THE Voyce of the STARS; Being a brief and easie INTRODUCTION, TO THE Knowledge of the Number, Names and Characters of the Planets and Signs, Aspects and Anticions: the Division of Heaven, and how to erect a Figure thereof, either by a Table of Houses or by Tables of Right and Oblique Ascentions: an exact and true De∣scription of the Planets and Signs, with the Countries, Cities or Towns under them. LIKEWISE, How to judge of the Affairs of the World, by Revolutions, Eclipses, great Con∣junctions and Blazing-Stars. ALSO, Something touching the Popish Plot, and other Remarkable Affairs of the Year, 1678. By William Knight, Student in Astrology and Physick. Si Deus nobiscum quis contra nos? London, Printed by E. T. and R. H. for Thomas Passinger at the Three Bibles on London-Bridge, 1681.
TO THE READER. Courteous Reader, THe divine and laudable Science of Astrology, is a Learning that teaches by the Natures, Motions, Configurations, Significations, and Influences of the Heavens and Stars therein, how to judge of future Contin∣gencies, or predict natural Events: the word Astrology, is derived from Astra and Logos, which is as much as to say the Speech, reasoning or language of the Stars; and to this we find the Psalmist consent, when he sings, the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament shew∣eth his handy works: day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth know∣ledge: there is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard: their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the World: in them hath he set a Taber∣nacle
for the Sun, which is a Bridegroom com∣ing out of his Chamber, and rejoyceth as a strong man to run a race: his going forth is from the ends of the Heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof, Psalm the 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Thus being led by the signification of the word, or appellation of this Noble Art, unto those places of Scripture first; I shall now look back to the beginning of the Holy Writ, and so take along in order several portions thereof, that farther prove the Stars to have influence on all sub-lunary things, whether Animal, Vege∣table, or Mineral; to begin then, observe, And God said, let there be Lights in the Fir∣mament of the Heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for Signs and for Seasons, and for days and years: And let them be for lights in the Firmament of the Heaven, to give light upon the Earth; and it was so: And God made two great Lights; the greater Light to rule the day, and the lesser Light to rule the Night; he made the Stars also: And God set them in the Firmament of the Heaven, to give light upon the earth; and to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good, Genesis the 1.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. And for the precious Fruits
brought forth by the Sun, and for the precious things put forth by the Moon, Deuteronomy the 33.14. Again, they sought from Hea∣ven, the Stars in their Courses fought against Sisera, Judges the 5.20. Canst thou bind the sweet Influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion, Job the 38.31. So like∣wise, saith the Lord, I will hear the Heavens, and they shall hear the Earth; and the Earth shall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and they shall hear Jezreel, Hosea the 2.21, 22. Many more places might be produced, but these are sufficient to convince any sober Person, that those glorious Bodies, were not by their Maker placed in the Heavens only for ignorant people to gaze at; but to shew forth his Almighty Power, in their subordinate Rule and Government: And now seeing this their Lordships is not ma∣naged by sensible and palpable acts and agi∣tation, it must needs follow, that they have a secret and hidden way of Rule, whereby they operate imperceptibly in all their agitations of their Dominion: the Sun and Moon indeed have their palpable effects, for the Sun is the Fountain of heat, and that heat is the Nurse of Life; also his presence and absence causeth day and night: likewise his nearness to, and remoteness from our Zenith, together with the nature
of the Parts of Heaven he passeth through, causeth Summer and Winter, heat and cold, alteration of days and nights: now the Moon seems to be as much the Foun∣tain of moisture, as the Sun is of heat, as is apparent by the Tydes, which constantly attend her motion; and by all sorts of Shell-Fish, and the eyes of Cats, which are all fuller and bigger at the Full-Moon, then they are at the Change or New-Moon: A∣gain, it is very observable, that if a man chance to fall asleep, abroad in the Fields in a Moon-light night, how she besots him, and fills him with dulness and drowsi∣ness: but besides those palpable acts of the Sun and Moon, they have their secret and imperceptible influence, as the other Planets and Stars; for though heat is the Nurse of Life, and moisture an hand-maid to it, yet it is not the mere heat which giveth life, nor the mere moisture that helpeth to live; for if so, then might man make living Creatures artificially, but this we see is past his skill to do; the heat may hatch the eggs, but all the art of man cannot make an egg that can be hatched: No, for there is a secret act of Sun and Moon, besides the mere putting to of heat and moisture, which produceth life both in sensitive and vegetive Animals. And in
these secret and insensible operations or in∣fluences, of the Sun, Moon, and Stars; be∣sides the light which they give, consists that rule, which they do exercise over all the Sons of day and night: so that man if he lives upon the earth, must come under the touch thereof, so well as Brutes and Vegetives. And this Power, man being unable to avoid; but must in a great mea∣sure, submit thereunto, the Stars therefore are said to give Laws unto him, and to the whole Body of Mortallity, so long as the World endureth: So then, Astra regunt homines, sed regit Astra Deus, the Stars rule men, but God rules the Stars. Ay, but hark ye, (say some) what do you tell us of the heat and moisture of the Sun and Moon, and their secret influences in pro∣ducing and upholding life; it is God that giveth life to all Creatures, and maintains the same in them, and he it is, that ruleth all persons and things on earth: So say we too, this we know and believe, only the question is, how he does them? whether with means or without? if without means, then every Child that is born, every living creature that is brought forth, and every Seed and Herb that grows out of the Ground, comes to pass by a new creation, as well as by generation, for to bring
things to pass without means, is all one as to produce them without matter, it being no more but to say, let there be men, let there be all other living creatures, and let there be Herbs, Seeds and Flowers; and, as the word says, they come to pass: but we know there was never above one Crea∣tion, for the Scripture tells us, that on the se∣venth day God ended his Work, which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work, which he had made, Gen. 2.2. And ever since that, all things have come to pass by nature, and therefore must there be some kind of natural means for the pro∣duction thereof: and now if with means these things come to pass, it is either by earthly means alone, or by the help of some Super-Terrestrial Powers also aiding and assisting, that they come to pass: but by earthly means alone it is plain they cannot come to pass, for it is not either Fire, Air, Earth, or Water, or all together, that can of themselves produce or maintain life to any creature, or bestow that goodly sweet savour unto the Rose: there must therefore be for certain some other Superiour Power aiding and assisting, and this powerful ver∣tue, the Scripture, reason, and experience tells us, is lodged in the Heavens and Stars; as communicated unto them, by the Al∣mighty
Creator. 'Tis true indeed, that God is as well able to govern and maintain all things without means, as he was at first to constitute and create the frame of na∣ture, but such is his pleasure, that he does work by means; and not immediately in all things: & therefore though it be the hand of God that doth all these things, yet is not that hand of God put to by any new contri∣ved act, but follows on course in the motion of nature, even as from the beginning it was contrived from all Eternity: for the works of God are known unto him, from the beginning unto the end of the World; which knowledge of God, before the Crea∣tion was no where written, but in his own Eternal Mind; but after, it was printed in a certain Book, called Nature, wherein, all the works of God, that were to come to pass in time, were expresly written down, as they were to follow in order, this Book of Nature, was a certain frame or model of the World, wherein, what by Creation, and generation, all persons, things, and actions, were to take their several courses and turns, so as to come to pass in time, from the beginning unto the ending of the World. And so infinitely and wonderful∣ly well, was this model of the World con∣trived; that though the rise and fall of
Persons, Towns, and Countreys, do depend upon the Virtues & Vices of the men there inhabiting; and those Virtues and Vices, do depend upon the free agency of those mens wills: yet such was the contrivance, that neither the fall of the first man, and the corruption, and the crush which the world endureth thereupon; nor the infi∣nite sins of after mankind, and the deso∣lations that do continually follow there∣upon, did necessarily require, any correcti∣on or amendment, of that first frame: but such was the infinitely to be admired and never enough to be adored forecast and providence of God; that at one view, appearhing unto him, all the several turnings and windings of all mens Wills, and the total sum and upshot of all Virtue and Vice; he did at once, so contrive, that all fates of prosperity and adversity, of re∣ward and punishment, should so fall out and come to pass, as to answer the Virtues and Prayers of the Righteous, and the Vi∣ces and Villanies of the wicked, each ac∣cording to their works, in due and fit suiting times: this Field is so large, that if I should walk much further therein, I should too much exceed the bounds of an Epistle, to so small a Treatise: I would therefore wish all young Students, and true
lovers of Art, to furnish themselves with that witty, learned, and sober defence of Astrology, written by that worthy Divine, Mr. John Butler: and now it follows that I might give you a description of the en∣suing Discourse, but it being so largely described in the Title Page, and the Book of a little Volumn, it will be altogether needless; only observe thus much in brief, Astrology, besides an Introduction, or knowledge of its Rudiments, consists of four distinct Parts, viz. Horary-Questions, Elections, Nativities, and Mundane Over∣tures; all which I give my Vote for, though some have magnified one or other of them, and run down the rest, without any strenuous reason for so doing, except ignorance; but the last is the subject of our following Tract, wherein you have in brief, the Precepts of the most approved and authentick Authors, as to the Sub∣stance of the matter: though in words and some circumstances, a little different. I could have been much more large in eve∣ry particular, but I well hope, to see the whole Doctrine hereof, performed by a more able Pen and Brain, for the benefit of all those ingenious lovers of Art, that no∣thing understand the Latin Tongue: be∣sides, what I have done, there is no que∣stion,
but will be sufficiently hist and pisht at, by such as can esteem of nothing, but what was hammered on their own Anvil: for we may observe many of them taking great pains, to level the reputations of some one or other that went before them, to make way for the displaying of their sup∣posed Trophies: Thus friendly Reader, I take my leave of thee, and shall remain thy well wisher.

THE INTRODUCTION. CHAP. I. Of the Number, Names and Cha∣racters of the Planets. AMongst all those glittering Lamps that the Almighty God hath pla∣ced in the Heavens, there be seven wandring Stars, called Planets, viz. ♄ Saturn, ♃ Jupiter, ♂ Mars, ☉ Sol, ♀ Venus, ☿ Mercury, and ☽ Luna; there is also the ☊ Dragon's head, ☊ Dragon's tail, and ♁ Part of Fortune.
CHAP. II. Of the Number, Names, Characters, and manifold Divisions of the Signs of the Zodiack. KNow then that the Heavens are divi∣ded into 12 equal Parts, called Signs: viz. ♈ Aries, ♉ Taurus, ♊ Gemini, ♋ Can∣cer, ♌ Leo, ♍ Virgo, ♎ Libra, ♏ Scorpio, ♐ Sagittary, ♑ Capricorn, ♒ Aquarius, ♓ Pisces. Every one of these Signs are divided into 30 equal Parts, or Degrees; every Degree into 60 Minutes, and every Minute into 60 Seconds, &c. ♈ ♌ ♐ are fiery Signs, ♉ ♍ ♑ earth∣y, ♊ ♎ ♒ airy, ♋ ♏ ♓ watery. Fiery Signs are hot and dry, and so make up the fiery triplicity; earthy, cold and dry, and make the earthy triplicity; aiery, hot and moist, and so compose the aiery, triplicity; watery, cold and moist, and these constitute the watery triplicity. ♈ ♊ ♌ ♎ ♐ ♒ are Masculine and Diurnal Signs, ♉ ♋ ♍ ♏ ♑ ♓ are Fe∣minine and Nocturnal. ♈ ♉ ♊ ♋ ♌ ♍ are Northern Signs,
because they decline from the Equinoctial Line toward the North Pole: ♎ ♏ ♐ ♑ ♒ ♓ are Southern Signs, because they decline from the Equinoctial toward the South Pole. ♈ ♉ ♊ ♋ ♌ ♍ are Signs command∣ing, ♎ ♏ ♐ ♑ ♒ ♓ obeying. ♋ ♌ ♍ ♎ ♏ ♐ are Signs of right or long Ascentions, ♑ ♒ ♓ ♈ ♉ ♊ are Signs of oblique or short Ascentions. ♈ ♋ ♎ ♑ are moveable Signs. ♉ ♌ ♏ ♒ are fixed Signs. ♊ ♍ ♐ ♓ are common Signs. ♈ ♎ are Equinoctial Signs. ♋ ♑ are tropicks, or tropical Signs. ♈ ♋ ♎ ♑ are cardinal Signs. ♊ ♍ ♎ ♒ are humane Signs, ♈ ♉ ♌ ♐ ♑ bestial. ♋ ♏ ♓ are fruitful Signs, ♊ ♌ ♍ barren. ♊ ♓ are double bodied Signs. ♋ ♏ ♓ are mute Signs, or slow of voice. ♊ ♍ ♎ ♒ are whole Signs, ♌ ♓ broken. ♈ ♊ ♌ ♎ ♐ ♒ are fortunate Signs, ♉ ♋ ♍ ♏ ♑ ♓ unfortunate. ♊ ♎ ♒ are sweet Signs, ♈ ♌ ♐ bitter. ♈ ♐ ♑ are weak Signs, ♌ ♏ ♒ strong.
Signs opposite to each other in the Hea∣vens, are ♈ to ♎, ♉ to ♏, ♊ to ♐, ♋ to ♑, ♌ to ♒, ♍ to ♓. Through these 12 Signs the Planets take their progress, and are always to be found in one part or other of the same. In the very next place I shall present you with a Table of the Essential Dignities of the Planets (which by some perhaps may be thought immethodical) yet I know no reason why they should think so, however we will insert it in a Chapter by it self.

The use of the foregoing Table is thus under∣stood. In the first Column you have the Twelve Signs, beginning at ♈, then ♉, ♊, ♋, &c. down to ♓. In the next Column to Signs, is written Houses of the Planets, under it ♂. d. ♀. n. &c. over against ♂ to the left hand is ♈, again ♀ ♉; which tells you that ♈ is the day house of ♂, and ♉ the night house of ♂, understand the like of all the rest, and then you will see and know that every Planet (except ☉ and ☽) have two of those Signs for their Houses: as ♄, ♑ and ♒; ♃, ♐ and ♓; ♂, ♈ and ♏; ☉, ♌; ♀, ♉ and ♎; ☿, ♊ and ♍; ☽, ♋. In the third Column you have the Ex∣altations of the Planets, in it and over a∣gainst ♈, is ☉ 19. under him, over against ♉, you may see ☽ 3. So the 19 Degree of ♈ is the very Point of the ☉ s Exaltati∣on, the 3 Degree of ♉ is the ☽ s. &c. yet you must understand that the Exalta∣tion of a Planet reaches the whole Sign. In the fourth Column is Triplicities written over head, under which against ♈ ♌ ♐, is ☉ ♃; ☉ under d. and ♃ un∣der
n. which shews that they rule the fiery Triplicity, the ☉ by day, and ♃ by night: So against ♉ ♍ ♑, you find ♀ ☽; a∣gainst ♊, ♎ ♒, ♄ ☿; and over right ♋ ♏ ♓, ♂ ♂; which signifies that ♂ rules the watery Triplicity both day and night. In the next five Columns is contained the terms of the Planets, the first 6 De∣grees of ♈ is the terms of ♃, from 6 to 14 the terms of ♀, from 14 to 21 the terms of ☿, from 21 to 26 the terms of ♂, and from 26 to 30 are the terms of ♄. So of the rest in order. Every Sign is again divided into three equal Parts, called Faces or Decanates, so the first 10 Degrees of ♈ is the face of ♂, from 10 to 20 the face of ☉, and from 20 to 30 the face of ♀: observe the same in the rest. Next is the Detriments, as you will find ♀ in ♈ is in her Detriment, ♂ in ♉ in his Detriment, &c. The last Column tells you the falls of the Planets, so ♄ in ♈ is in his fall, ♂ in ♋ in his fall, &c. Thus much for the description of the Table, I will now shew you the signification of a Planet in any of his or her Essential Dignities, that I may make good the
word use, to the full: Observe then, that A Planet in his own house direct, signi∣fies a Person of a strong and healthful con∣stitution, he is one that will be known in his Family, and rule over them with good Judgment; likewise he lives in a very plentiful way, or at least in a thriving condition. A Planet in his Exaltation, denotes a Person of a high majestical carriage, a proud lofty disposition, high minded; assuming more than his due, scorns to oop or buckle to any: in matters of war, a Planet in his Exaltation is stronger than one in his own house. A Planet in his Triplicity, sheweth a Person at the present time to be in a pret∣ty good condition, and modestly well in∣dued with the Goods and Fortunes of this World; not meanly nor very well des∣cended, yet his present state is commenda∣ble. A Planet in his term, declares one rather participating of the temper and shape of the said Planet, than of the Wealth, Pow∣er or Dignity by him denoted. A Planet in his face, and no otherwise dignified, the Person by him denoted is as it were at the last shift, or as some say at the last gasp, not knowing what to do, or
how to bestow himself: You may judge likewise the deplorable condition of things, as well as what we have said of a Person. The signification of a Planet in his Essential Debilities. A Planet in his Detriment, signifies one cast out of all good Enjoyments, and that without hope of recovery: a Person that is his own Enemy, and lives in a dejected condition. A Planet Peregrine, signifies a Person to be a Stranger, or Sojourner in the place where he is. A Planet in his fall, denotes a Person averse to honour, I believe it is because he hath lost it: for I have more than once experienced, that when a Planet was so posited, the Person by him signified made Ship-wrack of his credit; but it prenotes only a present subjection to a misfortune, which in a little time may be vanquished: In matters of War, a Planet in his fall is weaker than one in his detriment. A Planet is in his detriment when he is in a Sign opposite to his own House, in his fall when he is in the opposite Sign to his exaltation; and Peregrine when he is void
of all Essential Dignities, viz. neither in his house, exaltation, triplicity, term, nor face. A Table of Fortitudes and Debilities of the Planets. Essential Dignities. Essential Debilities.

By this Table you may perceive the first five Degrees of ♉ are Feminine, from 5 to 11 Masculine; from 11 to 17 Femi∣nine, from 17 to 21 Masculine; from 21 to 24 Feminine, and from 24 to 30 Mascu∣line. In the next Column to the right hand you will find the first 3 Degrees of ♉ is dark, noted by the letted d. from 3 to 7 are light; from 7 to 12 void, from 12 to 15 light, from 15 to 20 void, from 20 to 28 light, and from 28 to 30 dark. Now you must observe another method in the other 3 Columns, as thus; the 5th, 12th, 24th, and 25th Degrees of ♉ are deep or pitted Degrees, so likewise the 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 Degrees, are azemin, lame or deficient; and the 3, 15, and 27 are Degrees increasing Fortune. Understand the same throughout the Table. CHAP. IV. Of the Aspect of the Planets. OF these I shall take notice only of the most forceable, which are in number five, viz. the ☌ Conjunction, ✶ Sextile, □ Quartile, △ Trine, Opposition ☍.
A ☌ is when two Planets are in one and the same Degree and Minute of a Sign, this is the most powerful of all the Aspects, and is good or bad according to the nature of the Planets conjoyned. A ✶ is when two Planets are distant one from each other the sixth part of the Heavens, which is two Signs, or 60 De∣grees, and is an Aspect of imperfect friend∣ship. A □ is when two Planets are distant from each other the fourth part of the Zo∣diack, which is three Signs or 90 Degrees, and this Aspect is of imperfect Enmity. A △ is when two Planets are the third part of the Heavens asunder, which is four Signs or 120 Degrees, and this Aspect is of perfect love and friendship. And ☍ is when two Planets are diame∣trically opposite to each other, viz. six Signs or 180 Degrees, this divideth the Heavens into two equal parts, and is an Aspect of perfect evil; for being both in a direct line, and this distance asunder they openly oppose each other. The Aspects go under two Denomina∣tions, viz. partil and platick. A partil Aspect is when two Planets be exactly so many Degrees and Minutes from one ano∣ther as make a perfect Aspect. A platick
admits of the moity of each Planets Orbs. The Orbs of the Planets are thus under∣stood, viz. ♄ 9 Degrees, ♃ 9 Degrees, ♂ 8 Degrees, ☉ 17 Degrees, ♀ 7 De∣grees, ☿ 7 Degrees, ☽ 12 Degrees. Thus you see the Orbs of ♄ is 9 De∣grees, the half of which is 4 degr. 30 min. the Orbs of ☉ is 17 Degrees, the half thereof is 8 Degrees 30 Minutes, this being added together makes 13 Degrees, which tells you that when ♄ and ☉ are within 13 Degrees of a ☌; ✶, □, △, or ☍ to each other, they are said to be in a platick Aspect: now if they are apply∣ing to the Aspect, the good or evil there∣by signified is not yet come to a perfect birth; but if they be seperating then it is over, I mean the heat thereof; but it will be visable although in a declining con∣dition, till they are 13 Degrees separated, and then it will wholly disappear; you must likewise know, that Aspects are dex∣ter and sinister: therefore view the fol∣owing Table.

CHAP. V. Of the Antiscions, &c. Cont. Ant. Signs Antiscion   Cont. Ant. Signs Antiscion ♓ ♈ ♍ ♍ ♎ ♓ ♒ ♉ ♌ ♌ ♏ ♒ ♑ ♊ ♋ ♋ ♐ ♑ ♐ ♋ ♊ ♊ ♑ ♐ ♏ ♌ ♉ ♉ ♒ ♏ ♎ ♍ ♈ ♈ ♓ ♎ This Table is easie to understand, for in these three left hand Columns you may find that a Planet in ♈ casteth his antiscion to ♍, and contrantiscion to ♓: So like∣wise by the three right hand Columns, a Planet in ♎ casts his antiscion to ♓ and contrantiscion to ♍, &c. to know the degr. and min. of a Planets Antiscion, you must substract the degr. and min. he is in from 30 degr. and the remainder is the degr, and min. of his antiscion, and the same degr, and min. of the opposite Sign to his antiscion is his contrantiscion.
Example. Suppose ♄ in 10 degr. 37 min. of ♈, his antiscion by those precepts will be found in 19 degr. 23 min. of ♍, and his contrantiscion in 10 degr. 23 min. of ♓. An antiscion is in vertue equal to a △ if the Planet be strong, and equal to a ✶ if he be weak; the counter-antiscion is e∣quivalent to an ☍ if the Planet be strong, but like unto a □ if he be weak. CHAP. VI. Of the Division of the Heavens into 12 Equal Parts. THe whole Globe is first and prin∣cipally divided into four equal parts by two great Circles, the Meridian and Horizon; the Horizon divideth the Heavens into two Hemispheres, the North and South, called the upper and lower He∣misphere. The Meridian cutteth the Heavens into two equal parts also, viz. East and West; called the oriental and occidental parts thereof.
Every one of these are again divided into three equal parts more, by Circles of Position, which intersect the Equator, and do likewise meet in the Points of Section of the grand Meridian with the Hori∣zon. Thus are the Heavens equally divided into 12 Parts, which the Learned have called Mansions or Houses. Oriental Houses are the 3, 2, 1, 12, 11, and 10. Occidental Houses are the 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4. The 1st, 10th, 7th and 4th Houses are Angles. The 11th, 5th, 8th and 2d are succe∣dent Houses. The 12th, 9th, 6th and 3d are cadent Houses. Houses opposite to each other are the 1 and 7, 2 and 8, 3 and 9, 4 and 10, 5 and 11, 6 and 12. The upper Hemisphere containeth the 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 and 7th Houses. The lower Hemisphere have the 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1st Houses.
diagram of sky A Scheme, or Figure of the Heavens. The Lines that the Figures stand by shew the entring or Cusp of each House. The 1st, 12th and 11th Houses signifies Child-hood. The 10th, 9th and 8th youth, or young people. Th 7th, 6th and 5th man-hood. The 4th, 3d and 2d old age.
The use that may be made hereof is this, if in a Figure of a Revolution of any year of the World, Eclipse, great Conjun∣ction, &c. You find the Lord of the As∣cendant in the 11th afflicted by the Lord of the 8th: You may judge there will be a great Death or Mortallity among Child∣ren, or such as are under 15 years of Age; but you must also have respect to the Pla∣net, for ♄ signifies old people; ♃, ♂, and ☉ such as are in the prime of their Age, ♀ and ☿ Youth, ♄ in her first quar∣ter Children, in the second Youth, in the third Man-hood, and in her last quarter those that are well in years. CHAP. VII. To erect a Figure of the Heavens, for any hour of the day or night, by a Table of Houses. IN erecting a Figure, you must be ad∣vised in these things. First, be sure you are furnished with a Table of Houses fitted for the Latitude of the place you intend to erect your Fi∣gure in.
Secondly, Consider the Year, Month, day of the month, day of the Week, the hour and minute of the day. Thirdly, You must have by you in a rea∣diness an Ephemeris, or Almanack, that have the true places of the Planets. Fourthly, In your Ephemeris for that year, and in the Month, against the day, find the place of the Sun, in Signs, Degrees, and Minutes, at Noon. Fifthly, Have recourse to your Table of Houses, and seek the Sun's place, under the 10th House; then take the hour, mi∣nute, and second that stands right against it, under the title time from noon, and add it to the hour and minute of the day or night you erect your Figure for; with which Sum enter the Table of Houses a∣gain, (if it exceed not 24 hours, but if it do deduct 24 hours from it) and with the remainder enter the Table, under time from noon; against it, in a right Line, you will have the Cusp of the 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, and 3 Houses; and then upon their op∣posite Houses place the opposite Signs, De∣grees and Minutes. This being done, find by the Ephemeris the places of all the Planets at the day pro∣posed, and set each one of them in his pro∣per place in the Figure. Where note, if
the degr. and min. of the Planets place be more than the Cusp of the House posses∣sed by the Sign he is in, you must set him over the Cusp in the House; but if his degr. and min. be less than the Cusp of the House, then place him before the Cusp thereof in the other House. You must likewise find the ♁ and set it in the Figure. It is sound thus, substract the Sign, degr. and min. of the ☉ s place in your Figure, from the Sign, degr, and min. of the ☽ s place, to the remainer add the Sign, degr. and min. of the Ascendent, the Sun is the true place of ♁, which you must reckon from ♈. Example. In 1677, March 9th, at 9 hours, 27 mi∣nutes Post-Meridian or Afternoon; the Sun made his ingress into the first scruple of ♈, according to the Rudolphine Ta∣bles; for which time we will set a Scheme by a Table of Houses for the Latitude o London, viz. 51°, 32′. Now I enter the Table of Houses i that Page where it is written Sol in Aries or ☉ in ♈; with the Sun's place 0 De¦grees, under Dom. X. or 10th House, & righ
against it, to the left hand I find 0 hour, 0 minute, 0 second, under time from noon: which tells me I have nothing of time, to add to the time of the Revolution; I therefore move along under time from noon, till I come to 9 hours, 27 minutes, which I cannot find, but I can have 9 hours, 25 minutes, 44 seconds, this wants but a little more than a minute thereof, which is near enough. And so in a strait Line from these Numbers, I have the Cusps of the six Oriental Houses; the nearest whole Degrees we shall accept in our Figure and neglect the minutes.

your Figure for, and by the last of the two foregoing Tables turn that time into degrees and minutes of the Aequator, the which being added to the right Ascention of the Sun, the Sum will be the right As∣cention of the 10th house; wherewith enter the Table of right Ascentions again, and the Sign and nearest Degree that an∣swer thereto place on the Cusp of the 10th house: Now if you make your address to the first of the two aforesaid Tables with the Latitude of the place you are in, or erect the Figure for; there you will find the Circle of Position of the 11th and 3d, 12th and 2d houses, agreeing to the Lati∣tude thereof; which is to be understood, that by Tables of oblique Ascentions, for those Latitudes you must obtain the Cusps of them 4 houses. Then to go on with your Work add 30 degrees to the right Ascention of the 10th house, and so you have the oblique Ascention of the 11th house, which being sought in its proper Table you will find the Sign and Degree on the Cusp thereof: Thus by a continual addition of 30 De∣grees you may obtain the Cusps of the six oriental houses, under their several Poles; and for the six occidental houses them fill up with opposite Signs and De∣grees.
Note, that for the Ascendent you must use a Table of oblique Ascenti∣ons for the Latitude of the Place you are in or erect the Figure for. CHAP. IX.

The afore-going Descriptions of the Planets must be understood as they are by themselves, for if they be in any Configu∣ration with another Planet, then they par∣ticipate of the Description, Nature and Disposition thereof, either good or evil, according to the strength or weakness of that Planet, and his good or ill Aspect; by the true Observation hereof, I have for some late years, so exactly described the quesited Person in the Resolution of Ho∣ary Questions, that many of my Clients
have stood amazed to hear me: and in this I never fail, if my Figure be truly ra∣dical, and I true to those Rules.

The mean motions of the Planets. ♄ 2 minutes, ♃ 5 minutes, ♂ 31 mi∣nutes, ☉ 59 minutes, ♀ 59 minutes, ☿ 59 minutes, ☽ 13 degrees.

The Magnitudes of the Planets, according to that Learned Astronomer Tycho Brahe. ♄ is bigger than the Earth 22 times. ♃ is bigger than the Earth 14 times. ♂ is less than the Earth 13 times. ☉ is bigger than the Earth 140 times. ♀ is less than the Earth 6 times. ☿ is less than the Earth 19 times. ☽ is less than the Earth 42 times. The bigness or compass of the Globe or Ball of the Earth is 21600 English miles, from hence you may find how many miles each Planet is about; as for Example, the Moon which you see is the very least of all the Planets, will be found by this Rule near 500 miles round every way, which tells you the Heavens must be of a large Volumn, therefore considering this, toge∣ther with their Influences, with the Pro∣phetical King, you may say when we con∣sider the Heavens, ☉ ☽ and Stars, which God hath made, What is man that he is so mindful of him, &c.

In the first Column to the left hand you have the days of the week, and the night following each day: In the other 12 Co∣lumns is contained the 12 hours of the day or night, and the Planet ruling each hour, observing that the Planet which go∣verns
the day, ever rules the first hour thereof, beginning at Sun-rising; then successively the next in order, as you will find by the Table. You must know these Planetary hours are greater or lesser, according to the mo∣tion of the Sun, always dividing the day and night each into 12 equal Parts; al∣lowing the time from Sun-rising to Sun-setting to be divided into 12 equal Parts for the day, and from Sun-setting to Sun-rising for the night: So that those Plane∣tary hours are never of equal length with a common hour which is 60 minutes, un∣less it be when the Sun is in the Equinocti∣al, which is about the tenth of March, and the thirteenth of September every year: By this Rule we shall find, that from the tenth of March to the thirteenth of September; a Planetary hour is longer by day than a common hour, and so much shorter than a common hour by night: but from the thirteenth of September to the tenth of March, a Planetary hour is short∣er than a common hour by day, and so much longer than a common hour by night.

VOX STELLARUM: OR, THE Voyce of the STARS; Being a brief and easie INTRODUCTION To the Judgment of Annual REVOLUTIONS OF THE VVORLD, Eclipses of the Luminaries, great Conjunctions, Comets, or Blazing Stars, &c. By William Knight, Student in Astrology and Physick. Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas. LONDON, Printed by E. T. and R. H. for Thomas Passinger at the Three Bibles on London. Bridge, 1681.
OF REVOLUTIONS. CHAP. I. SECTION I. Teaching how many Schemes ought to be erected for this purpose, and for what time they are to be set. I Shall not dispute the various Opinions of Authors about this business, but wholly adhere to the Judgment and Pre∣cepts of Ptolomy, who was Princeps Astro∣ogoum; which is that we should erect Schemes for the punctual times that the Sun enters the four Cardinal Signs, viz. ♈, ♋, ♎, and ♑; and from thence deduce a judgment of that years affairs, that is thus from the Position of Heaven at his ingress into ♈, we are to judge of the Accidents of the Spring Quarter, which is from the 10th of March until the 11th of June, at
which time he enters ♋; from whence judgment must be drawn of the Summer Quarter, or until he enters ♎; which is about the 13th of September, from the Fi∣gure whereof we are to judge the events of Autumn, or the Harvest Quarter: and lastly, by the Position of Heaven at his ingress into ♑, we may know the state of the Winter Quarter, that is, from the 11th of December until he enters ♈ again. However, you ought in a general way, to prefer and esteem the Scheme of his in∣gress into ♈ above all the rest: For the Ancients have affirmed that the Sun was placed in this very Sign, and in the first punctum thereof at the Creation; where he began his unwearied course, in the Me∣ridian of Mesopotamia. Therefore must the Position of Heaven at the time of his return thereunto every year, be the Principal Piller on which we are to build our Astrological Judgment of Mundane Affairs: and this we need not cavil at, if we do but consider that he is sons vitae, the Fountain of Life; fons lucis, the Fountain of Light, or anima mundi, the Soul of the World, by which all things, as well Vegetatives as Sensitives have their subsistence and vivifying nourishment. Again, experience crams us with belief
that this affirmation of the Ancients is an undeniable truth. First, we see that when the Sun  this Equinoctial Sign the Earth and  grow green, and rctifie by degrees after∣wards, the birds warble forth their sweet and melodious Tunes, and all Creatures re∣joyce. Secondly, we find the Actions and Af∣fairs of the World correspond with the Face of Heaven at this time. SECTION II. Of the Lord of the Year. The Lord of the Year is that Planet who is almuten of the Ascendent, at the Sun's ingress into ♈.
CHAP. II. Of the significations of the Planets when they are Rulers of the Year. SECTION I. Of ♄, when strong, THe People will that year, build New Houses, and alter and repair their Old, they will be fortunate in all their worldly Employments, and be in good esteem among their Neighbours, the Earth shall be fruitful, so that the Farmers or Countrey-men will increase in Substance, and the poor Day-labourer have little cause to complain. But if he be weak, Then instead of building and repair∣ing their Houses, they may be forced to sell or morgage them: There will be much cold weather, People shall be sorrowful, crossed and vexed in their undertakings, grievous infirmities will be spread abroad, dammage by Storms and Tempests, Hurri∣canes, Earth-quakes, Ancient People will
die, and the Winter pinching cold. SECTION II. Of ♃, when strong, Noblemen, Judges, Councellors, and all such Persons signified by him shall be suc∣cesful, and they will do justice too, which as a good thing, besides they shall be live∣ly, contented, honoured and esteemed by the People. Sure they cannot chuse but be contented then: a peaceable, fruitful and pleasant year may now be expected, all kind of weather in its due season, and the commonallity in a thriving condition. But if weak, Then judge clean contrary, Jovialists will be prodigal and domineering, windy and moist weather will come oftner than welcome, &c. SECTION III. Of ♂, when strong, People shall be fortunate, bold and active, they will overcome their Enemies,
and trample on all their devices, the Wea∣ther warm and seasonable. But if weak, Then men will be quarrelsome, given to War, Duels and the like; yet the Fo∣menters of such, subject to come off with small credit or honour, the Weather will be untemperate, hot, bloomy, thunder, lightning, unseasonable Rain, a sickly Sum∣mer. SECTION IV. Of ☉, when strong, Kings, Princes, and all Noble-men shall increase in Honour and Renown; the Com∣mon People will be of high and elevated spirits, the Weather warm and reviving, Corn, Beasts and Birds plentiful. If weak, People will be subject to palpitations of the Heart, Sore-eyes, and other Ma∣lignant Distempers, many great and ho∣nourable Persons suffer some degradation, the Weather very unseasonable.
SECTION V. Of ♀, when strong, A successful and advantageous year to Women and Maids, they will be general∣ly free from infirmities, and other mishaps, married Women shall love and delight themselves in the company and society of their Husbands, be fruitful, easily conceive, and be delivered with much facility; the People or Commonallity will thrive, and be prosperous, delight in all modest re∣creations, feastings, and the like, to go spruce and fine in Apparel, many happy Marriages will be contracted, and a jocund year it will be to most Persons; the Air will be healthful, pleasant showers falling in season. But if weak, Then People will be given to lewd plea∣sures, and bring to themselves much evil thereby: you may judge quite contrary to what was said before: viz. Sickly, Scarci∣ty, unwholesome Dews, Mists, &c. many Miscarriages, Abortive Births, &c.
SECTION VI. Of ☿, when strong, Merchants, and all Learned Men will have a successful time, Shop-keepers, and Trades-men little cause to complain, for ☿ is the natural signification of Trade, Traffick and Merchandizing; therefore when he is Lord of the year and strong, there shall be a brisk imploy among most Professions, Arts and Sciences will be ad∣vanced, and each Student strive to excel therein. But if weak, Trading will be at a low ebb, Shop-Keepers, Trades-men, and Merchants break; high Winds shall often annoy Ships at Sea, and do much harm by Land also; many Ship-wracks, and some suffer by contrary winds. SECTION VII. Of ☽, when strong, People shall be healthy, fortunate, just,
honest and punctual in all their dealings, a very calm and tranquil time, a year hedged round with peace and plenty, wholesome Weather, no want of Rain in its due Season. But if weak, The Commonallity will be subject to many cold and dull Diseases, have little success in their Vocations, deceitful and false in their Dealings, an unwholesome, destructive season, the Weather raw and cold, with great scarcity of Rain when the Earth requires it, and Floods of water when there is no need of any. SECTION VIII. If the Lord or Ruler of the year be strong and afflicted, or weak and assisted, then we must judge a medium between both of what is before declared. So likewise, we must observe the Sign he is in, whether it be Masculine or Femi∣nine, humane or bestial, fiery, earthy, airy or watery; East, West, North, South, &c. and accordingly order our Judgment.
CHAP. III. Shewing how to give Judgment on the 12 Celestial Houses in any Revolu∣tion of the years of the World. First House. THis House signifies the Lives, state and condition of the Common Peo∣ple, therefore if you find it free from the presence or evil Aspect of an infortune, and the Lord thereof, and the ☽ free from affliction, they will be in a happy and prosperous state, no ways molested or grieved: if ♃, ♀ or ☊ be in the first, or in ☌, ✶, or △ to the Lord thereof or ☽, they shall be brisk, healthy, and enjoy much felicity during that Revolution; but if ♄ ♂ or ☋ be in the first, or in ☌ □ or ☍ to the Lord thereof or ☽, they denote trouble, vexations, infirmities, dangers and crosses to the People. Note, I do not mean Dragon's Head or Tail in any Aspect but Conjunction.
Second House. If you find no evil Planet in this House, nor in ☌ □ or ☍ to the Lord thereof or ♁; then judge it will be a succesful and advantageous year to the Commonali∣ty, more especially if either of those signi∣ficators are befriended with the presence or laudable Aspect of a Fortune: but if ♄ or ♂ be in the second ill dignified, or in ☌ □ or ☍ with the Lord thereof or ♁, they signifie poverty, losses, little tra∣ding, and much couzening and cheating in the World; if ☋ be in the second, or in ☌ with the ♁ the same. Third House, If ♃ ♀ ☊ or ♁ be found in this house well dignified, or the Lord of the third in friendly configuration with the Lord of the Horoscope or ☽, or if they be in reception; Neighbours and Relati∣ons will live in Love and Unity, short Journeys shall be safe, and removals very advantageous: If ♄ ♂ or ☋ be in the third, or the Lord of the third in □ or ☍ to the Lord of the Ascendent or ☽, then Relations will jar, Neighbours clash,
envy, hate and disturb one another, they shall be full of feuds, perfidiousness and heart-burnings, &c. Fourth House. Hence we judge of the fertility or ste∣rility of the ground, if ♃ ♀ ☊ or any other Planet be in the fourth house well dignified, the earth will be fruitful and bring forth good increase, the Countrey∣man shall have very hopeful crops of Corn, and most Fruits plentiful; but if ♄ ♂ or ☋ be in this house unfortunate, then the earth shall be barren, or not bring forth its due increase, Fruits scarce, and much of the Husbandman's time spent in vain, houses come to ruine and little profit redound to the owners. Fifth House. If you find this house free from the pre∣sence or evil Aspect of an infortune, or ♃ ♀ or ☊ therein you may judge teem∣ing-women will have good success in child-bearing that year, and People enjoy much felicity in their Feasting and Pastime, if ♄ ♂ or ☋ are herein they signifie many miscarriages, abortive births and hard la∣bours:
so likewise many will be addicted to lewd courses, and small good come of company-keeping, but rather strife, quar∣rels and duels issue from thence; if ☉ ☿ or ☽ be in the fifth, judge according un∣to their strength or weakness. Sixth House. If the Lord of the Horoscope or Luna be in the sixth, and the Lord of the sixth in the Horoscope, it will be a sickly season; if the Lord of the sixth or any Planet therein be in ☌ □ or ☍ with the Lord of the Horoscope or ☽, you may verily pronounce or conclude a sickly time; if the Lord of the sixth be in the eighth, in evil Aspect to the Lord of the first or ☽, those Diseases that are likely to be ram∣pant that Revolution, will prove the sharp Knife of Atropos to many; or if he be in the fourth it is not a half penny diffe∣rence, for they will then drill People as fast into their Graves: but if the Lord of the Ascendant and Luna be in their es∣sential Dignities, and free from affliction, then there is no fear of sickness in that Revolution.

If the Lord of the Ascendent or ☽ be in □ with the Lord of the seventh, there will be much suspicion or fear of a War that year, and many Clandestine Actions on foot tending thereto: but if either the Lord of the Horoscope or ☽ are in ☍ to the Lord of the seventh, Open Wars is then very likely to be that Revolution: ♄ or ♂ in the seventh, in ☌ □ or ☍ with the Lord of the Horoscope or ☽ signifie much blood-shed by Wars, Duels, &c. also many tedious Law-Suits: ♂ in any Angle excites or stirs up mens minds to War: any of the Superior Planets, viz. ♄ ♃ ♂ or ☉ in ☌ □ or ☍ to each other in the Scheme of a Revolution, prompts the Grandees of Nations to E∣minent Debates or Differences; and from thence come Wars and effusion of blood: but if none of those Positions or Confi∣gurations be found in the Figure, and ♃ or ♀ angular, or the Lord of the seventh in ✶ or △ to the Lord of the Ascendent
or Luna, then you may conclude it will be a Year of Peace and Tranquillity. Eighth House. The Lord of the eighth in the sixth, and in ☌ □ or ☍ with the Lord of the Ho∣roscope or ☽, denotes a great Mortality, or Death of People by some poysonous or malignant Distemper, the Lord of the Ascendent or ☽ in the eighth, or the Lord of the eighth in the Ascendent in evil Aspect to each other the same: but if you find the Lord of the first or ☽ free from the Body or ill Rayes of the Lord of the eighth, or any Planet therein, then judge the contrary. Ninth House. ♄ ♂ or ☋ in this house, declares much danger, losses and trouble in Sea-voyages, there will be unusual Ship-wracks, and o∣ther mischiefs to Merchants in their Ad∣ventures; ♄ signifies loss of Ships by leak∣age, foundring, bilging, or sinking in the Sea, he likewise gives danger of being taken by the Turks; ♂ denotes Pyrates, blowing up, or burning; ☋ signifies rob∣bing, cheating, &c. ☿ in the ninth in □
or ☍ to the Lord of the first or ☽, de∣clares many Ships to suffer by suddain gusts of wind, or running on Quick-sands; but if you find the ninth house free from the presence of an infortune, or ♃ or ♀ there∣in, then there shall be great profit, safety and delight in Sea-voyages, or long Jour∣neys by Land: you must in all these Judg∣ments, mind the nature of the Sign each Planet is in. Tenth House. If ♃ ♀ or ☊ be herein, or the Lord of the tenth strong and no ways afflicted, then will the condition of Kings, Princes and the like, be firm and secure from all mischief; but if ♄ ♂ or ☋ be in this house, or the Lord thereof weak and o∣therwise afflicted, then they shall be in jeo∣pardy according to the nature of the Pla∣net afflicting, the house he is Lord of and posited in: we ought also to consider the ☉ who is the natural significator of such Persons. Eleventh House. This house takes notice of the Armies, Exchequers and Assistance of Princes;
therefore if ♃ ♀ or ☊ be placed herein, or the Lord thereof well dignified and in ☌ ✶ or △ with the Lord of the tenth, there will be no want of courage, fulness and freeness of those: if you find an in∣fortune in the eleventh, or the Lord thereof weak, or in □ or ☍ to the Lord of the tenth judge the contrary. Twelfth House. The Lord of the twelfth well dignified, or a fortune in ☌ ✶ or △ with him, or posited in the twelfth in good Aspect to the Lord of the Ascendent or ☽, signi∣fies that great Cattle will thrive and be very successful to their Owners: if an in∣fortune be in this house, or the Lord thereof in evil Aspect to the Lord of the second, it denotes loss and dammage to many by keeping and dealing in such kind of Goods. Thus, by these brief Precepts the young and engenious Student may learn how to judge of any thing necessary to be known, from each House of Heaven in the Scheme of an Annual Revolution: and as for them that are better learned, or think themselves so to be, than my self, let
them not be offended, for it is not such I undertake to teach; and further we let the Student know, that he ought both in his Judgment on this House of great Cat∣tle, or on the sixth house of small, to con∣sider those Signs that are termed Bestial, and observe what Beasts are under each of them: as under the rule of ♈ are Sheep: ♉ Bulls, Oxen, Cows: ♌ Lions, Deer: ♐ Horses: ♑ Goats, Hoggs, Hares. CHAP. IV. Teaching how for to judge of the price of any Commodity in each Year. HEre you are to observe what Planets in the Scheme of an Ingress are strong and free from affliction, and which of them be weak and afflicted: then judge the Things, Goods or Commodities un∣der those Planets that are strong, will be dear or of a high price; and such things as be under the Planet or Planets that are weak, shall be cheap or of low esteem; likewise observe what Planets are Orien∣tal, for the things under them will be
dear; and the Commodities under those that are Occidental shall be cheap: Now if you find any Planet strong and occiden∣tal, or weak and oriental, then judge a medium between both. CHAP. V. Of the alteration of the Ayr, or change of Weather. SECTION I. VVE must first know the general or simple signification of each Pla∣net in this matter, before we come to treat of their particular or compound de∣notations: observe then that ♄ is the Author of cold and dryness, and signifies cold, dark, obscure Ayr; thick, black and condense Clouds: ♃ is the Author of heat and moisture, he denotes warm and gentle winds mixt with rain: ♂ is very hot and dry, and signifies bloomy hot weather, thunder and lightning: ☉ is Author of glorious warm and dry Ayr: ♀ is cold and moyst, she gives us
gentle Showers and wholesom Dews: ☿ is cold and dry, he is the Author of winds: ☽ is very cold and moist, but varies much the Ayr according to the Sign she is in, and the Planet in Configuration with her. SECTION II. Now then of compound significations. ♄ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ♃ denotes cold Rain, Hail, Inundations, or Overflowings of Water; windy or tempestuous Wea∣ther, Earth-quakes, and sometimes a great Drought. ♄ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ♂ high Winds, Rain, Hail, Thunder, Lightning, some∣times Frost and Snow. ♄ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☉, Thunder-Showers, cold Rain, Hail, stormy Wea∣ther, Snow or slabby Sleet, dark Clouds and Foggs. ♄ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ♀ cold Rain, Snow, hoary Frost or Mists. ♄ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☿ cold sharp Winds, dark Clouds, Frost and Snow, tempestuous Weather. ♄ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☽, Rain, Snow, Wind, dark Clouds or Frost. ♃ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ♂, Windy,
Thunder and Lightning, Rain and Storms, Frost or Snow. ♃ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☉, thunder Showers, high Wind, Lightning, frosty Weather. ♃ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ♀, misling Showers, gentle Winds. ♃ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☿, vehement Winds, Rain or Hail, Snow, Thunder and Lightning. ♃ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☽ moist Ayr, sweet dripling Showers, or pleasant Dews. ♂ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☉, Heat, Thun∣der and Lightning-showers, Frost, Hail or Rain, sometimes a very dry Ayr. ♂ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ♀, Tempests, suddain violent Rains, Thunder and Light∣ning, Snow or Sleet. ♂ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☿, dry Wind, Hail, cold Frost, Thunder and Lightning-showers. ♂ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☽, Wind, Thunder, Rain, Hail, sometimes tempe∣stuous. ☉ in ☌ with ♀, Wind, Rain, Thun∣der-Showers, much wet Weather some∣times. ☉ in ☌ with ☿, Wind, serene Ayr, Frost, sometimes Rain or Hail. ☉ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☽ Wind and Rain.
♀ in ☌ with ☿, suddain Storms, Hail, Rain or Snow. ♀ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☽, wet Weather, Dews or Mists. ☿ in ☌ □ or ☍ with ☽, Wind and Rain, or Hail-storms. Here you must always remember to ob∣serve which Planet is strongest, the Signs they are in, and the season or time of the Year, for so we are to order our Judg∣ment. The opening of the Flood-gates of Heaven, called in Latin, Apertio portarum, is a sure Sign of cold and terrible Rains, and that is when two Planets, whose Hou∣ses, be opposite, are in ☌ ✶ □ △ or ☍ to each other: these be ♄ and ☉, ♄ and ☽, ♃ and ☿, ♂ and ♀: where note, if it be a ☌ □ or ☍ the Weather by them signified will be violent, if a ✶ or △ mo∣drate: when they are in fixed Signs, it will continue long: in moveable, but a short time: when in common Signs, judge a medium between both; it is also an apertio portarum, when that any Planet separates from another by Body or Aspect, and next applies to the Planet whose House or Houses, is opposite to that from whom he seperated.
Of Winds appropriated to the seven Planets. First, according to Authors, ♄ (say they) stirs up the East-wind: ♃, the North: ♂, the West: ☉ and ☽, the East and West-winds: ♀, the South: ☿ according to the Planet he is in confi∣guration with. Secondly, according to reason and experience in our dayes. ♄ rouseth up the North, and North-East-winds: ♃ the South, and South-West: ♂ and ☉ the East, and South-East: ♀ and ☽ the West, and North-West Winds: ☿ as he is the general Significator of Winds, so he stirreth up all sorts, according to his configuration, as before noted.
CHAP. VI. Of the general and constant Qualities of the four Quarters of the Year. SECTION I. Of the Spring. THe most glorious and delightful Sea∣son of the whole Year, is the Spring, which takes its beginning when the Sun enters ♈, then making the Days and Nights equal all over the World, except under the Poles; and he then leaving the Inhabitants of the Southern Hemisphere, doth begin to refresh and revive with his glorious and cherishing influence all those that inhabit the Northern Hemisphere: this Quarter is generally hot and moist, signifying Child-hood; it continues all the time that the Sun is passing thorough ♈, ♉, ♊, And the Rulers hereof are ♂, ♀, ☿, and they Physically denote vigour, de∣light, and mutability. So accordingly while the Sun is in ♈, all Vegetables put forth their Leaves and Blossoms, and Na∣ture is indued with a Spring-like force: while the Sun is in ♉, the Leaves and
Flowers of the Fields expand themselves after a delightful manner; and Dame Ve∣sta opens her Paradice of Pleasures to all her Children: while the Sun is in ♊, Na∣ture's Limners are at work, and out of the force of ♂, and the delights and plea∣sances of ♀, paint to the World a million of pleasant Varieties. SECTION II. Of Summer. The next glorious Season begins where the Spring ends, at which time the Sun en∣ters ♋, and he being then mounted his Apogaeon, is removed to his greatest di∣stance from the Earth, and being in his greatest Declination North-ward, maketh longest Days and shortest Nights to all we that inhabit the North side of the Aequa∣tor, this Quarter is generally hot and dry, signifying Youth; it continueth all the time the Sun is perambulating the Signs ♋, ♌, ♍; and the Rulers hereof are ☽, ☉, ☿; the ☽ here precedes the ☉ in Government, and all the Births of the fore-going Spring are now swel'd to a pleasing Dropsie, and so they remain du∣ring the Sun's continuance in ♋; and then
so soon as he enters ♌, he assumes a parti∣cular (so well as a general) power of go∣verning; and by his great heat reduces all Vegetables from their Anasarchal swel∣ling, to a positive hectick Fever: thereby ripening Seeds, Flowers, Fruits, &c. which he fails not to put forwards while he con∣tinues in this his Royal Palace. Lastly, ☿ brings up the rear of this Season, and while the ☉ is in ♍ it being an earthly Sign, he herein reduceth all things from their hectical condition, into a direct Ma∣rasmus: and now all things are ripe for the Sycle, and the honest Countrey-man goes whisling with his Cart loaden to the Barn. SECTION III. Of Autumn. This Season begins when the Sun enters ♎, at which time he once more maketh the Days and Nights equal, it is by Na∣ture cold and dry, signifying Manhood, and continueth all the time that the Sun is running through the Signs ♎, ♏, ♐; and the Rulers hereof are ♀, ♂, ♃; first ♀ bestows her tears upon the Hearse of the deceased Summer, and hereby generates a
Phaenix out of the old ones Ashes: and so while the Sun continues in ♎, we are made happy with a second Spring; but of no long continuance: next comes ♂ and he while the Sun is in ♏, endeavours to add heat to the moisture Venus lent, the better to cherish the later Summer: but that too is soon returned by reason of the absence of the Sun, the Fountain of all heat and grand Principle of Generation. Lastly, ♃ by his Balsamick Beams, while the Sun is in ♐, endeavours to perfect what the other two could not alone; and so conserves the mummial virtue of all Plants, Herbs, Fruits, &c. for the good of humane kind, and for the preservation of the Species of all things; to the end of this Quarter, which is as far as his Go∣vernment extends. SECTION IV. Of the Brumal, or Winter Quarter. This Season commenceth at the Sun's entrance into ♑, and he being in his Peri∣gaeon or nearest to the Earth, also in his greatest South-Declination; maketh short∣est Days and longest Nights to us that in∣habit the North-side of the Aequator:
this Quarter is by Nature cold and moist, signifying old age, it continues all the time that the ☉ is transiting the Signs ♑, ♒, ♓; and the Rulers hereof are ♄ and ♃, but ♄ hath a double power to that of ♃; and hence it is, that all things, (this Quar∣ter) more especially while the Sun passeth through ♑ and ♒; look with a sad and lowring face, and are seen to wear the Image of Death and Destruction: now Frosts, Snows, Hail, black Clouds, Rain, Isicles, Barrenness, extremity of cold, and all things that are negative to delight and pleasure, have their Regency: but ♃ by his gentler moisture, while the Sun is in ♓, puts us in hopes of an approaching Spring. And thus by this orderly govern∣ment of the Planets through the several Seasons of the Year, are we put in mind of the passage of the several parts of our life, hereunto agreeable; viz. how we pass the Spring of our Infancy and Ado∣lescency; the Summer of our Youth, and strength; the Autumn of our Manhood, and declining years: And lastly, the Winter of our Old-age; where ♄ stands ready with his Sythe to cut us down: And how by passing this vale of misery, this na∣tural death, we go onward to the govern∣ment of ♃ to immortallity, and a blessed
life, where we shall behold God Almighty in glory. Of Eclipses. CHAP. I. What an Eclipse is, the cause thereof, what time a Figure should be erected for judging the effect of it? what things or places it concerns either good or evil, the time when its effects shall begin? how long continue? Of all these in order we shall treat. IN omni revolutione Annorum Mundi, E∣clipsin Solis & Lunae non postpones, In e∣very Revolution of the World, we must be sure to remember the Eclipses of the Luminaries. SECTION I. An Eclipse of either of the Luminaries, is only a privation or obscurity of their light for a season.
SECTION II. That of the Sun is occasioned at the ☌ or Change of the Moon, by the interposi∣tion of the Moon between the Body of the Sun and the Earth, averting or turning his Beams from us, whereby he becomes dark∣ned for that time. That of the Moon is by the Diametri∣cal Interposition of the Earth betwixt the Sun and the Moon, so depriving her of the light that she receiveth from the Sun, and this is always at the ☍ or Full-Moon: the Sun ever moveth in the Ecliptick-Line, and therefore were it not so that the Moon at her Conjunction and Opposition with him, had Latitude, whereby she deviates from the Ecliptick, sometimes North-ward, and at other times South-ward, that she cannot exactly meet with him there, this defect would be every Change and Full. SECTION III. The time for which we should erect a Figure concerning this business Guido Bo∣natus that Learned Italian Astrologer tells us in these Words, Si autem in anno fuerit Eclipsis, vide in quo signo sit adventa, &
aequabis tunc Planetas & Domos ad horam me∣diae Eclipsis: if in any year there be an E∣clipse, see in what Sign it is and reduce the Planets and Houses to the Time of the middle of the Eclipse. SECTION IV. The Places concerned in the effects of an Eclipse, Ptolomy informs us, Muxime e∣venient in ea quae eidem Signo Eclipsis assimi∣latur, & in qua super terram videtur Eclipsis: the effects will chiefly happen to those Parts subject to the Sign wherein the E∣clipse is, and in those Places where the Eclipse is visible: Now on what the effects will be manifested, Ptolomy also tells us, ex Qualitatibus & Figuris, quae proprie sunt Signorum, in quibus est Eclipsis locus indica∣tur, & Signorum etiam, in quibus erraticae & non erraticae consistent Stellae, quae Signo Eclip∣sis, & Signo Anguli praecedentis Eclipsi donan∣do disponunt: the meaning of these words run to this purpose, That we may know from the Qualities and Forms of those Signs wherein the Light is Eclipsed, and from those Places in which the Planets or other Stars having chief dominion in the place of the Eclipse, and the Angle prece∣ding the Eclipse shall be located: the Angle
preceding is the Ascendent if the Eclipse be in the Forenoon, but if it be Afternoon then 'tis the Mid-heaven or tenth house: from hence we learn that if an Eclipse be in humane Signs it will manifest its effects on men, if in a Bestial Sign on Cattle, in the Ascendent on the Common People, in the second on their Substance, &c. if it be on the ninth house on Church-men, in the tenth on Kings, Princes, &c. an Eclipse on the fiery Triplicity, denotes the moti∣on of Armies, Wars, effusion of Blood, de∣triment to Kings, Princes, or Noble-men, Murthers, Thefts, Robbers on the high∣ways, Depopulations, Abortions to Wo∣men with Child, malignant Fevers, destru∣ction to Sheep, Coneys and Horses: strange Apparitions in the Ayr: in the earthy Triplicity, scarcity of Corn, and other Fruits, death of Bulls, Oxen, Cows, Goats and Hogs, Earth-quakes, &c. in the airy Triplicity, Hurricanes, stormy Winds, pestilential Diseases, a scarcity of Food, death of Birds or the Fowls of the Ayr: in the watery Triplicity, Wars, rumors of Wars, eruptions or over-flowing of the Sea-banks, Floods of water, death of Vul∣gar People, damage to Fish, &c.
SECTION V. The effects of an Eclipse doth without doubt begin to operate from the first ap∣pearance thereof though not much to be descerned, and when the ☉ or ♂ cuts or oppose the place thereof they rouse it up to action, but Authors teach us other Les∣sons, which I shall not trouble my self with here, nor shall I say any thing against it. SECTION VI. For to know how long the effects of an Eclipse will continue let enquiry be made of Ptolomy, whom you shall hear speak thus, sciemus quod futura Solaris Eclipsis tot annis durabit, quot ejus horae aequales fue∣rint; Lunaris vero totidem mensibus: the sence of these words is, we must know that in an Eclipse of the Sun the effects shall continue so many years as he is eclip∣sed equal hours, and of the Moon so ma∣ny months.
CHAP. II. Shewing the signification of each of the five Planets, when they are Lord of an Eclipse, here you must know the ☉ and ☽ are excluded. IN the fourth Section of the last Chapter aforegoing you may perceive or under∣stand, that the Lord of the Eclipse is that Planet which hath the most essential Digni∣ties in the Sign of the Eclipse and Angle preceding. SECTION I. ♄. When this Planet is Ruler of an Eclipse, he causeth Want, Tribulation, Sadness, Fears, obnoxious Diseases and Death a∣mong the People; destruction to Cattle, mischief to Birds, cold pinching weather, Frost and Snows; in Summer pestiferous unwholesome Ayr: Tempests, Ship∣wracks, scarcity of Fish, eruptions of the Sea banks, over-flowing of Rivers, Inun∣dations, Floods of Rain, Worms and Ca∣terpillars
abound, destroying the Fruits.

Third Face of ♓, Signifies Seditions, cruel and inhumane Actions of Souldiers, Sea fights, and death of Fish. Observe according to Cardan Aphor. 45. Seg. 5. tells us, Eclipses Luminarium super Cvitates, Provincias & Regna, magis quam super privatae conditionis homines, aut etiam super Reges; respiciunt enim multitudinem: The Eclipses of the Sun and Moon pour down their Influences upon Cities, King∣doms and Provinces, more notable and re∣markable, than upon men of mean condi∣tion, or yet upon Kings themselves; for they principally respect the Multitude. Here I shall conclude this Subject with the 53 Aphorism of Hermes Centiloquim, fiunt in mundo multa incommoda, quando erit in uno mense utrinsque Luminaris Eclipsis, & praecipue in his locis quibus est significatio eo∣rum specialis: Much Troubles shall be in the World, when both the Luminaries shall be eclipsed in one Month, and chief∣ly in those places in which their effects shall be manifested. Here followeth a brief Account of the admirable and strange mutations which happen in this Elementary World, upon
the meeting of either two of the three Superiour Planets, in any of the four Tri∣plicities. Note their Oppositions pro∣duce near the same Accidents as do their Conjunctions: You are likewise to take notice that either the Conjunction or Op∣position of Saturn and Jupiter is the most powerful, yet none to be praised. Of great Conjunctions. We intend only the ☌ of ♄ ♃ and ♂ with each other. Now when as either of these are conjoyned in the fiery Triplicity, they denote high difference between Christi∣an Kings and Princes, their Kingdoms and Monarchies much afflicted, Com∣motions, Wars, Seditions, Treasons, alteration of Laws and Customs, strange Apparitions, prodigious Meteors, Plagues, Scarcity and Desolation, the death of Great men, &c. In the earthy Triplicity, barrenness of the Ground, scarcity of the Fruits thereof, mortality of four-footed Beasts, Earth∣quakes, eruptions of Banks. In the aiery Triplicity, pernicious and pestilent Diseases among men, corrupted Ayr, uncouth Sights therein, tempestuous
Storms, destruction to those delightful aiery Inhabitants the Birds, Murders, Treasons and unruly Actions, &c. Lastly, when in the watery Triplicity, they are the fore runners of Wars, terri∣ble Slaughters, Depopulations, Fire and Sword, Famine and Pestilence; over-swellings of the Sea and Rivers, floods of Rain, and cruelty used by the Turks or Mahometans against Christians. Of Comets or Blazing-Stars, their natural pretences. I shall not here represent unto you the various causes, or at least the various opi∣nions of Philosophers and Naturalists, con∣cerning the causes of those amazing Prodi∣gies, nor yet take notice of their several Appellations, but only observe three things, which is the principal matter of the whole Subject, viz. first, their appro∣priations to the seven Planets; Secondly, their significations from thence deduced; Thirdly and lastly, what they signifie by their appearance in any of the 12 Signs of the Zodiack: the two first I shall joyn in one Chapter.
CHAP. I. A Comet of a pale, leaden, ashy, or dull wan colour belongs to ♄, it de∣notes terrible frights or fears, among the People, exile or banishment to many, Fa∣mine, Pestilence, lingring Diseases, out∣ragious Storms and Tempests, Ship-wracks, Inundations, scarcity of Fish, plenty of lit∣tle else but Worms or Caterpillers. Such as are of a bright and clear colour relate to ♃; they signifie a fertile and plentiful year, wholsome gales of wind, seasonable Showers, alterations and change of Laws, perhaps for the better if Jupiter be then strong, otherwise much detriment to those Kingdoms and Places under him. Those that are red or fiery, be Comets of ♂, they denote Wars, Quarrels, Duels, Blood-shed, Tumults, Seditions, Massacres, Sea-fights, Thundering and Lightning in the Ayr, and in mens minds too: nothing delights them now but the clattering of Arms and russing of Armies; Thieves and Robbers abound, scorching hot wea∣ther, drying up Rivers, Wells and Foun∣tains, intollerable Diseases, Mars will be rampant in earnest. The Comets of the Nature of ☉, are
of a yellow or gold colour, splendid and glorious to behold: They signifie the death of Kings, Princes or Rulers, altera∣tions of Government, War, Drought, Up∣roars, many and dangerous Infirmities. Such as be of a glittering, illustrious white colour belong to ♀; those denote much evil to Women, great mutations in the World, alterations of Laws, Customs and Priviledges; dammage to the Fruits of the Earth, and also to fresh-water Fish. When any Comet appears of an azure, sky or rain bow colour, ☿ claims it; these are the fore runners of strange Cata∣strophes, Wars, Plague and Famine: Trou∣ble, Sorrow, Tribulation and Mourning, wise and learned men degraded and lord∣ed over by Clowns, Learning it self turn∣ed out for a wrangler. Lastly, Those that appear of a pale white, or somewhat spotted therein, are Comets of the ☽: they denote much mis∣chief to Women and Vulgar People, alte∣ration of Laws, Customs and Rites, Scarcity, Wars, Troubles, Sickness, Floods of Wa∣ter, Ship wrack, and misery to Sea-men, dammage unto Fish of the Sea.
CHAP. II. ♈. A Comet or Blazing-star appearing in this Sign, is the prodromus of Wars, clashing of Armies, Blood-shed, e∣vil to Grandees, death of some mighty Prince, Drought, cruel Diseases among men, rot or murrain amongst small Cattle. ♉. Here it signifies pernicious Diseases, long lingring Infirmities, Captivities, Po∣verty, death of some great Lady, evil to the greater sort of Cattle, paucity of Fruit and Corn, Earth-quakes, violent cold Winter. ♊. When in this Sign men lay aside goodness, it denotes War, Quarrels, Sick∣ness, death of Young men and Children, Abortions, lofty Winds blowing down Trees and Houses, Thunder and Light∣ning, Famine and dammage to Birds of the Ayr. ♋. Here it denotes Wars, Duels, Rob∣beries, Pestilence and Famine, abundance of Locusts or Caterpillars, paucity of Fruit and plenty of Worms or other Ver∣mine, many men drowned, Ships over∣whelm'd in the Sea. ♌. In this Sign a Comet doth signifie Wars, effusion of Blood, detriment to
Kings, Princes, Nobles and Gentry; Worms and other Vermine destroy the Corn in the Fields, Lyons, Wolves and mad Dogs rage, People molested with do∣lorous griefs in their Eyes, Thunder and Lightning in the Ayr, drought or scarcity of Water. ♍. Here it prenotes much mischief un∣to many that are placed in the Courts or Houses of Princes, loss of Offices without hope of regaining, some suffer Exile or Banishment, dammage to Merchants, ma∣ny Insolencies, Rebellions, Animosities and Tribulations, Sorrow among People, Abortions to Women, &c. ♎. In this Sign it imports plenty of Thieves, Robbers, or Padders on the High-ways, poverty and want, the death of some great Person, Slaughters, Plots or occult Conspiracies, high Winds, Earth∣quakes, a drying up of Rivers and Foun∣tains, scarcity of the Fruits of the Earth. ♏. Here a Comet doth signifie Wars, Quarrels, Rebellions, Perils and Dangers surround the People, scarcity of Corn and Fruits, little water, and that is corrupted or unwholesome, causing Sickness to those that use it, Teeming-women are very sen∣sible of many Troubles. ♐. When a Blazing-Star appears in
this Sign, Wise and Noble-men are depres∣sed or detrimented in Person or Estate, if not both, likewise Wars and much Mis∣chief to most People. ♑. Here it denotes Wars, Quarrels, Calamities, poysoning of Princes, cutting by the High-ways, contempt of Religion, Persecution to many Professors thereof, pestilent Diseases, sharp Frosts and cold Weather, great Snows, Famine or scarci∣ty of Provisions, much Mischief on foot among People: ♒. In this Sign it menaces terrible and durable Wars, a sweeping Pestilence, dark obscure Ayr, high Winds, Thunder and Lightning, some great Prince or Lady yields to the Grave. ♓. Lastly, a Comet or Blazing-Star in this Sign presages Wars, Slaughters, high Differences among Relations and Friends, Contentions about Religion, prodigious Apparitions, tumultuous Bickerings, over-swelling of Rivers, dammage to Fish. Thus have you a brief and true account of the natural significations of those Bea∣cons, which by the will of the Almighty are hanged over peoples heads, to allarum them against approaching evils. Note, that the Effects of these new Stars are chiefly manifested in those Kingdoms,
Countries or Places subject to the Sign in which they appear, and to those Places where they are seen, likewise we must ob∣serve which way they emit their Rays or Tayl, and to what Planet they point. Some say that their Effects will be chief∣ly apparent, when the Sun cuts the place of the Heavens in which they were seen, or when he comes to the Planet whose na∣ture the Comet is of: this seems to me ve∣ry probable, and will be performed in much less than 100 years. —Comets or Blazing-Stars Threaten the World with Famine, Plague and Wars: To Princes, Death: to Kingdoms many Crosses: To all Estates, inevitable Losses: To Heards-men, rot: to Plow-men, hapless Seasons: To Saylors, Storms: to Cities, civil Treasons. Some necessary Rules to be well observed in Predictions relating to the Subject of this Book, or indeed to any part of Astrology. First, know that generally, ♄ and ♂ are evil Planets, or Infortunes: ♃ and ♀ are good Planets, or Fortunes: ☿ and ☽ indifferent: the ☉ is Rex Planetarum vel Stellarum, the King or Prince of Planets or Stars: ♌ is his Mansion House, ♈ his
Throne wherein he is exalted: or as Mr. Gadbury terms it, his Seat in Parliament: hence it will result, that he rules the Heart, and hath also much to do with the Brain of Kingdoms and Nations, so well as Persons: Therefore I say, his ☌ □ or ☍ is the very worst of all Afflictions, especi∣ally in matter of Life or Honour: and his ✶ or △ in such respects more to be priz∣ed than the same Rays or ☌ of either ♃ or ♀. Humane Signs, signifie men: bestial Signs, Beasts: aiery Signs, Birds of the Ayr: watery Signs, water-Fowl and Fish: earthy Signs, the Fruits of the Earth: the fiery Triplicity rule over the East part of the World, the aiery West, the watery North, and the earthy South. Remember the particular Beasts under the five bestial Signs, as under the rule of ♈ are Sheep, Coneys, or Rabbets: ♉ Bulls, Oxen, Cows: ♌ Deer, Lyons and other furious Beasts: ♐ Horses, Mules: ♑ Goats, Hogs, Hares. ♄ ♃ ♂ ☉ ☿ are masculine Planets, ♀ ☽ Feminine. ♄ ♃ ☉ are Diurnal Planets, ♂ ♀ ☽ Nocturnal: ☿ Convertable: ☊ is Mascu∣line, ☋ Feminine. ♂ signifies bold audacious Pyrates at
Sea, or Robbers at Land, such as fear no∣thing, or are of good force. ☿ small slie pilfering Pickaroons, or Privateers at Sea, and close ambush Rob∣bers at Land. This is meant when either of those two Planets be Lord of an Eclipse, Ruler of a Comet, or posited in the ninth or third House of a Revolution, and chiefly if then in evil Aspect to the Lord of the Horo∣scope or ☽. Some Aphorisms of Hermes, pertinent to the Subject of this Book. 1. An Artist cannot make a commixtion of the significations of the Stars, before he know their Friendships and Enmities, which is threefold: First, according to their Nature; Secondly, according to their Houses; And Thirdly, according to their Aspects. 2. ♀ is opposite to ☿, he embraceth Languages and Discipline, she, Delights and Pleasures; ♃ the like to ♂, he loves Mercy and Justice, the other Impiety and Cruelty. 3. Make the ☉ or one of the Superi∣ours to signifie Princes and Great men, Scribes and Rusticks the inferiour Planets, and chiefly the ☽.
4. The signification of a ☌ is not lesse∣ned by an Aspect, but an Aspect is by a ☌; as having lesser force. 5. Make ♄ and ☉ Significators of Kings and Princes, with the Planet or Planets in the tenth; but their helpers take from the eleventh, and the Assisters of the Vulgar People from the second House. ♃ dissolves the malice of ♄, and ♀ dis∣solves the malice of ♂. 7. The ☽ increasing in Light and Moti∣on, and in ☌ with ♄ and ♃, is generally good in all things; but if she be diminish∣ing in light, 'tis ill; understand the con∣trary wholly when she is in ☌ with ♂ and ♀. 8. ♄ passing out of one Sign into ano∣ther, causeth strange Apparitions in the Heavens. 9. In Summer, when the ☉ enters the terms of ♂, heat is caused or increased; in Winter Drought, and scarcity of Rain and Waters. 10. When Significators of either good or evil shall be Stationary and Angular, it shall be the more durable; but if cadent or retrograde, more mutable. 11. Planets under the Sun-beams, or within 12 Degrees thereof, are unfortu∣nate, unless in the same degree with him;
but when they are passed 13 degrees from him, they are fortunate. 12. All Rebellions breaking out at the beginning of the year, are not easily sup∣pressed. 13. Oriental Planets signifying good or evil, perform their work speedily: Occi∣dental, more slowly. 14. There will happen great Wars, and many difficulties, when in a Revoluti∣on of the World, ♄ and ♃ shall be in their Exaltations. 15. Planets in fixed Signs shew the mat∣ter durable, in common Signs doubtful, in moveable Signs convertible to good or evil. ♄ performs evil slowly, ♂ swiftly; therefore ♂ is reputed to hurt more than ♄. Some Aphorisms of Ptolomy. 1. Ate & à Scientia, from thy self and Science; for it is impossible that the Ar∣tist should foresee the particular Idea of things; neither can sence receive a parti∣cular, but a general notion of the sensible matter; wherefore he ought in these things to use conjecture, for none but such Persons as are inspired from above can predict particulars.
2. That Person who is naturally pro∣pended or inclined to any Science, shall verily attain to greater perfection therein, than one that by hard pains and learning shall strive to attain it. 3. A wise man doth co-operate with the celestial operations, and doth assist na∣ture, as the Husbandman in the ploughing and preparing his Ground. 4. When the Significator of a King∣dom shall be directed to the Anaretical Points, the King, or some great Prince in that Kingdom shall die. 5. When ♄ and ♃ are in ☌, see which of them is most elevated, and judge ac∣cording to his nature; do the like in the ☌ of other Planets. 6. The ☉ is the Fountain of the Vital Vigor, the ☽ of the natural: this I judge in Kingdoms or Nations so well as parti∣cular Persons. 7. The significations of an Eclipse, shall be most visible, when the Eclipse is near an Angle; consider also the Stars in Aspect one with another, and not the Pla∣nets only, but the fixed Stars also, the con∣stellations arising together with the Signs, and from thence frame your Judgment. 8. Shooting Stars, and other such like Apparitions, shew great Scissity in the Ayr,
and if they be produced from one part only, it shews there shall be great Winds produced from that Quarter also; but if they are driven into several Parts, it shews scarcity of Waters, a troubled Ayr, and incursions of Souldiers. 9. Comets whose distance from the Sun is eleven Signs, if they appear in an Angle, the King or a Great man in some Kingdom shall die; but if they appear in a succe∣dent House, the Princes Attendants shall do well, yet shall some Kingdom change their Governour; but if they appear in a cadent House, Diseases and suddain Deaths ensue; if they move from the West to the East, a Forreign Enemy shall invade several Kingdoms; but if the Comet move not, the Enemies shall be of the same Countrey, born and bred. Here followeth six remarkable Aphorisms more, to make up the Game. 1. The five grand Afflictions or Unfor∣tunacies of the Planets are these, viz. when they are Combust, Retrograde, Peregrine, in their detriment or fall. 2. When two Planets are in ☌ or in a∣ny other Aspect to each other, if they be in reception, it increaseth the goodness of
a good Aspect, and abateth the malice of an evil Aspect. 3. Observe still the Antiscions and Conter-Antiscions of the Planets, for they have their effect so well as the Aspects. 4. The vertue of a Planet is in that House, whose beginning or Cusp he pre∣cedes by no greater space than five de∣grees. 5. If ♃ or ♀ be Significators of any good and strong, then it shall take place to the full. 6. When ♄ or ♂ are Significators of any evil and strong, they will bring it on with a vengeance. Those that would be furnished with va∣riety of Aphorisms, I recommend them to that ingenious little Treatise, entituled, Vade Mecum, written by Mr. John Patridge.

VOX STELLARUM: OR, THE Voyce of the STARS; Being some brief OBSERVATIONS ON THE INGRESSES OF THE SUN, Into the Four Cardinal Signs, 1680. SHEWING How plainly the Stars did point at that never to be forgot∣ten Popish Plot, and other Re∣markable Affairs of that Year. By William Knight, Student in Astrology and Physick. London, Printed by E. T. and R. H. for Thomas Passinger at the Three Bibles on London Bridge, 1681.
diagram of sky Ptolomy saith, Ex Solis existentia in Ariete Vernalem qualitatem cognoscemus; by the Sun's entring into Aries, we are to judge and know the event, and suc∣cess of the accidents of the Spring. Gui∣do Bonatus, Post quam certificatus fueris ad unguem de tempore introitus Solis in A ietem, vide quis ex Planetis sit Dominus anni; when we have exactly calculated and found out the true time of the Sun his entrance into Aries, then we are to see what
Planet is Lord of the year: in this Figure of Heaven, ♄ is Almuten of the Horo∣scope, and therefore is Lord of the year: yet we may allow ♂ Co-partner with him in regard he is exalted in the Sign Ascending; two prime Guids, there was no doubt of this years being well govern∣ed; all the Planets under the Earth, and four of them in □ to ♄ who is posited in ♊ a humane Sign, in ☌ with Aldebaran a violent fixed Star of the nature of ♂, signified occult Conspiracies, wicked Plots and Devices, Treacheries and violent Acti∣ons among men; but as ☿ Lord of the eighth is in ☌ with ♂ Lord of the tenth, and both of evil Aspect to ♄, so would Justice with Death, repay some of those desperate Agents: ♄ signifies Monks, Jesuits, Fryers, &c. and he being in □ to ♂ Lord of the tenth so well as to the ☽ in the Ascendent; argued their hellish de∣sign was at Prince and People, to abandon or destroy the established Government, and to erect their own detestable Princi∣ples; and this they might think them∣selves sure of, by reason ♄ disposes of the ☽, and is in ✶ to the ☉, but he is peregrine and confronted by no less than four Pla∣nets, as before noted, and ♂ who is Lord of the tenth and exalted in the Ascendent,
is in his Triplicity and in perfect ✶ with potent ♀, ergo, he stands firm, and ♄ must go to wrack, maugre all his malicious con∣trivances: we read in the fifth Chapter of Judges and rhe twentieth Verse, that the Stars in their courses fought against Sisera, and truly here we may see that the Stars in their courses fought against the Papists; for which let all true hearted English Pro∣testants give due praise and glory to God Almighty, who commissioned them so to do, and in this the Anti-Astrologer, would be much the better employed, than in bu∣sying his Brain, Tongue, or Pen in so am∣ply displaying in Billingsgate Rhetorick, his Ignorant malice against a worthy and harmless Science. Albumazer a Learned Arabian Astrologer saith, Mars cùm fuerit in revolutione anni in quarto Aspectu Saturni excitat bellum: Mars when in the revolu∣tion of any year, is in Quartile of Saturn he causeth Wars: but he being seperated one degree from the perfect Aspect, and ♀ in exact ✶ with ♂, as also the Applica∣tion of ☉ to the ✶ of ♄, argued that not∣withstanding the preparation, noise or po∣pular clamour that might be of Wars, it would determine in Peace; and this Judg∣ment I delivered to some Friends who re∣quested the same of me, long before there
was any publick suspicion of Wars: but when there was so great preparation thereunto, and Souldiers sent beyond Sea, the certainty of War was affirmed, Astro∣logy degraded, and I laughed at by my Friends: nevertheless I told them still that they laughed before they won, or was like to win, as indeed it proved, to the great honour of Art: ♄ being the Lord of the year and afflicted as afore observed, signi∣fied a sickly Season and a long and cold Winter, which was so apparently true, that I think none can deny it: there are many excellent things to be extracted from the aforegoing Scheme of this years Af∣fairs, which I shall omit, and proceed to the consideration of the Coeli Position at the Sun's Entrance into the Tropick of Cancer, intending to see, if God permit, what may be observed from thence con∣cerning the Popish Plot. Sol enters Cancer, June the Eleventh, 1678, at five hours, fifty minutes ante meridiem, at which time the Face of Hea∣ven is as in the following Figure.
diagram of sky Ptolomy, Ex Solis existentia in Cancro, qua∣litas aestivalis deprehenditur: by the Sun his entrance into Cancer, the quality and nature of the Summer Quarter is known: ♄ is in this Figure nearly in perfect □ to the place of ♃ in the Vernal Ingress, he is Ruler of the seventh, and eighth Houses, and ♃ Lord of the ninth, so that you see one of them is both naturally and acciden∣tally the Significator of England's mortal Enemies; and the other the natural and
accidental Significator of the Reverend Clergy, or the true Protestant Religion: this signified the Popish Agents were and would be very eager to put forward their hellish Intentions this Quarter, but all the Planets being above the Earth, and ♄ in no Aspect with any, might well signifie that either for want of assistance, or fear of be∣ing discovered, by reason of the many eyes now abroad, they could not accomplish it: however if we consider the ☌ ♄ ♂ in 22 degrees of ♊, the 31 of July, we have great reason in Art to believe that they then took incouragement, laid close to their consultations, with much confidence of success: but the Almighty disposed it other ways, we hope for his glory, and England's future happiness: in the Figure ☉ and ♃ are in □ to each other, yet with mutual reception, which portended nota∣ble disputes about religious and Law pri∣viledges, though of no long continuance, nor to any great purpose or effect, because they are in moveable Signs, and neither of them essentially dignified: the ☉ and ☽ are Rulers of this Quarter, and in re∣gard they were both free from any ill rayes of an infortune, there could be no consi∣derable mischief or dammage to the Peo∣ple during the time thereof, according to
secondary causes: for Bonatus saith, Si for∣tunae aspexerint Ascendens & Dominum anni significant bonum esse corporum populorum in revolutione ista: if the Fortunes behold the Ascendant and Lord of the year, they signifie good to the People under that re∣volution: here ♃ is in △ to the Ascendant and in mutual reception with the ☉ who is chief Ruler of the ingress. Sol entered Libra, September the twelfth, at nine hours, fifty one minutes post meri∣diem, 1678, die ♃, hora ♂. diagram of sky
Ex Solis existentia in ♎ qualitas Au∣tumnalis cognoscitur, saith Ptolomy; the quality of the Autumnal Quarter is known by the Sun his ingress into ♎: Haly saith, quando Dominus Ascendentis & Luna fuerint in revolutione Infortunati significant malum: when the Lord of the Ascendant, and the Moon be in a revolution infortunate, it signifies much mischief and evil: that judicious man hit the nail plum on the head when he writ those words, for here was mischief intended to come with a vengeance, had not the Designs of the Pa∣pists been frustrated by a fortunate rup∣ture: ♄ their only Patron, is Lord of the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth Houses, posited in the twelfth in □ to ♃, and in ☍ to the ☽ Lady of the Horo∣scope in the sixth: they concluded with∣out doubt all was their own now, or would be shortly; for you may see ♄ was as big with the Plot as he could tumble, just ready to spawn: Authors tell us, that an in fortune in the twelfth signifies malicious private Enemies, but say they, if that Planet be Lord of the seventh, then those Enemies will make themselves publick: ♀ and ☿ are seperating from their friendly Aspects with ♄, policy and success leaves him in the mire, and he just∣ly
falls into the same trap, that he had so unjustly laid for others: Guido Bonatus saith, Si impedierint mali Dominum anni Ju∣dicabis impedimentum secundum substantiam mali impedientis, Saturnus enim significat im∣pedimentum ex doloribus longinquis & morte: if the infortunes afflict or impedite the Lord of the year (or quarter I suppose he means) you shall judge the quality thereof from the nature of the malevo∣lent Afflictor, who if it be Saturn, it signi∣fieth mischief through long sicknesses and griefs, as also death: the ☽ is Lady of the Quarter, and she posited in the sixth in ☍ to ♄, as before noted, now who is it that will say this was no troublesome nor sickly time, surely none that are well in their wits, can offer so to do: and seeing the Planets or Stars of Heaven did not whisper nor gibber in Pedlar's French, but speak with a loud Voice, and in plain Language: Let those Demi-Champions who have toyled themselves in erecting their Clubs against Astrology, forbear for the future, such fruitless Attempts, and try their manhood at other Exercises more pertinent to their Callings. Sol in Capricorn, December the eleventh, at nine hours, twenty nine minutes mane, die ☿, hora ☽, 1778.
diagram of sky Ex Solis existentia in ♑ qualitas Bru∣malis cognoscitur, saith Ptolomy; the quali∣ty of the Winter Quarter is known by the Sun's entrance into Capricorn. I shall for∣bear to explain the meaning of this Fi∣gure, presuming that I have done more al∣ready than I shall have thanks for my pains, though I had no other design in so doing than to advance the worth of Art, and the young Students Knowledge there∣in: Astrology if truly understood is of
great Worth and Excellency, yet are there many of its Mountain Professors no better friend unto it, than your Hypocrites are to Religion, who would fain have a name and no love to it, or at least a slight opini∣on thereof: the Nativity of the Popish Plot is very completely handled by that Ingeni∣ous Artist, Mr. John Patridge; therefore let not any Lover of Art think that my intent was to mend what he hath done, in so largely treating thereon: no, my De∣sign was only to show how lively the Solar Ingresses, did point at the Actions of that years Affairs; which probably have not so much been taken notice of by other Students: besides it cannot be unwelcome to any modest Tyro, in regard it not only illustrates the foregoing Precepts, but also proves the truth of this Doctrine to ad∣miration: so that here we may clearly see the Wisdom of the Almighty is great, and greatly to be praysed; he is the God of Order, and hath made all things so to be and continue, he maketh the Heavens re∣volve and move, hath ordered the several courses of the Planets, calleth all the Stars by their names, and has made them to dif∣fer from each other in glory; let the ig∣norant see and believe these his wonder∣ful Works, and be astonished thereat, and
amazed at their own former ignorance, in so rashly condemning what they under∣stood not; let them now consider that God did not set those glorious Bodies in the Firmament only for People to gaze at, but for Signs, and for Seasons, and to rule over the Day and over the Night, Genesis the First. FINIS.
