THE CARNIVAL. ACTUS I. SCENA I. Enter Ferdinando, Beatrice, at a low Window. Ferd. PEdro, stay you there: And whistle if any chance to pass this way: Let me not be surpriz'd I charge you. Hem! Beatrice! my Life! Hem! Bea. Hem! softly: I come. Opens the door: Enters. Fer. Now all the blessings of Auspicious Heaven Fall on so beauteous and so kind a Mistress! Bea. I now must owne this as my duty, Sir; And yet I will confess, That Love does prompt me to it with a joy As great as yours. Fer. Still kinder! and I most happy! Bea. But you did promise me, the other night, You would prefix a time wherein my Brother Should be acquainted with all what has past; It were not kind to doubt his Love, And keep him (in it) longer ignorant. Fer. My fairest Beatrice, I'le tell you why I hitherto have kept it from him: That you and I are now made sure
I still shall thank your mercy for that goodness; But he's unsatisfied in his affections, Sad with despairing Love is froward grown, Brooks no discourse but what tends to his Cure. If I can serve him in his business ought I then make sure of him too; And I would fain remove all possibilities Of Letts to my most wish'd Adventure here. Bea. And has he, Sir, implor'd your help? Fer. 'A has, to wait upon him as a friend, And to secure his walks by night. She is the Sister to a man of Quality, Though he be absent now, imploy'd about Some business in his Charge of Barcelona: Her kindred being of the greatest Rank May boggle at the least of Gallantry To this young Lady without his admittance. Bea. You have not yet seen her? Fer. No; but this time of Carnival Allows more freedom then all the year besides: And in a Masque we are resolv'd to see The Saint your Brother prays to. Bea. But my Fernando tell me when—— Pedro within. Pheu! Pheu! Fer. Be gone, be gone my Soul, Exit Beatrice. Here comes Company. Who are they, Pedro? Enter Pedro. Pedro. Don Alvaredo, with your Brother, Sir. Fer. O! walk as if you came from his house. Enter Alvaredo, Felices. Welcome, dear friend, I had sent my Man To see if you were at home. Alva. 'Twas thither I was going; I just now sent my Servant To desire you would come to me. Fer. I'm glad my Fates have brought me to your wishes. O Brother! 'tis a wonder to meet you:
How do you imploy your time? Ha? merry still! what device now on foot? Feli. Any to be doing, Except making Love at Churches; For there a man is bound at least To a serious look, (and that I hate) Turning up the whites of your Eyes Look more precise then a Dutch Puritan, Or play tricks with your fingers To tell the hour of visitation: When the poor vulgar think You thereby count your Ave-Maries, Having forgotten your Rosario. Out on't! what a damn'd Device To cloath Dame Venus in sackcloth! Alva. Well, Gallant, would I had thy mirth, And thou my Love. Feli. So would I, if she be handsome. Alva. Nay, I mean the Passion I have for her, Not her Person, Sir. Feli. O bezo les Manos Signior; I thank you for nothing: But marry, prithee marry; And to please you I will be in love with your wife, Or any mans wife in Christendom that desires it: And then we'l see what will come on't. Ferd. Why what will come on't think'st thou? Feli. Children, brave lusty Children, if she be but kind as she should be. Alva. Away Madcap; come let's in, Friend, I must now implore Your help and counsel. Exeunt. Enter Quintagona and Miranda. Quin. Come, come, I must not have you so inquisitive. Mir. Well, if I do not serve ye both a trick— What, do ye think because I'm young I cannot keep counsel? Quin. What counsel? what counsel? I'de have you to know I'm no Counsel-keeper.
Mir. Nay, on my Conscience, I do believe thee, Nurse. Quin. You do so; well, well, God send all Proverbs prove not true. Mir. Prithee what Proverbs, Nurse? Quin. E'en one I have often heard. Mir. Come out with't, out with't, good Nurse. Quin. Marry I have heard them say, Soon Ripe soon Rotten: God bless thee, and send thee grace. Mir. And thee wit. Enter Felices. Feli. O have I caught ye? Mir. A Rape! Nurse, a Rape! Run for the Alquazil, He's a grave man, and will do women justice. Feli. I, run, Nurse, run, Your young Mistress may be undone; Is this your diligence? Quin. Well Gallants, well, Thus must I be abus'd and jeer'd: I wonder what the Devil was in my Masters mind To give you leave to use his Sister so; He thinks she's young, but if he knew her As well as I, he would trust her no farther then He could throw a Milstone. Fel. Do you remember, Nurse, When you took away my young Mistress from me, And were, forsooth, so scrupulous. Quin. I, I, but she is grown half an inch since. Feli. How good Nurse! how dost thou mean? Quin. Away you wag, I mean no harm. Feli. Nor I truly, Nurse; But remember still as I told you. Quin. What should I remember? Feli. Why, how you were call'd: I'le but repeat his words.
Quin. Nay, nay, good Sir, let it alone; I'm sure my heart has been ready to break ever since. Mir. Alas poor heart! Pray Signior Felices rub not old sores; She'll fall into a fit of the Mother. Feli. A fit of the Grandmother you mean, ha, ha, ha. Mir. Ha, ha, ha, ha! O Donna Quintagona! Feli. O Donna Quintagona! Mir. Feli. Cheri chink, cheri chink, cheri chink, tery chink chink. Quin. I'le not stay to be abus'd thus. Exit running. Exeunt laughing and singing, Miranda, Felices. Enter Sancho. San. Vizards I have got, and all the tricks and devices Necessary for our Gambals; troth I have A great mind to practise here a little Upon these City Gallants; fools I'm sure they Are as well as we, only drest better, and Keep their gravity more; for the first learned Counsel a Mother gives the Don her child, Though but of two years old, is, Guarda la Gravidad. Hi, hi, hi, hi! Here's your fools face, puts on a vizard. And here's your Don's: looks fantastically, blowing up his cheeks. Pray which is better, to play the fool well, Or to dissemble the wise man, And be an errant Cockscomb here? Shews his head. Why I have seen the Lord of our Village, When he has been ask'd what a Clock 'tis, Look on the Meddal of his Rosario, (as if That could direct him;) and durst not (as We do) look in the Sun; for that dazling Of him makes him grin, and then, Boutoua Crispo, a looses his Gravity. Enter Ossorio running. Osso. Why Pedro! Pedro! come away Man! San. I do, d'ye hear? pox, how a stays!
Osso. Why, what are you, friend? San. One of Gods making, and his own undoing. Osso. Prithee about thy business. Sancho. So I am. Oh! in good time. Enter Pedro. Pedro. Bezo los Manos. San. Hi, hi, hi, hi! Pedro. Ossorio, what a Devil ails this fellow? Ossor. He's mad I think; what Trade art of? San. A Giber, sweet Gentlemen. Ossor. Why then about thy business, I say again; For we are not for thy Turn. San. The properest men in Sevil. Osso. Nay, that we are not neither; My Friend Pedro is not tall by any means. San. O Signior, I meant it not in that sence. Pedro. How then? San. Pray, Gentlemen, what's likest a Horse and Is no Horse? Pedro. Oh I can answer that, I read it in a Book T'other day; 'tis a Mare, friend. Sancho. Troth and that's true; but I thought Ye would have answered, an Ass. Osso. Well, come, suppose I answer so. San. Why then, Gentlemen, you come much Nearer my Conceit; For you two are as like one another As one Ass can be to t'other. Hi, hi, hi! Osso. You Rogue, if I light on you— Exit. Pedro. What a Rascall's this! But come, Our Master stays for us. Exeunt. Enter Alvaredo, Ferdinando, Felices. Alva. I have her leave this night; And yet I fear this favour may all turn To my undoing. Ferdi. She cannot have so much of Marble 'Bout her heart;
Or indeed, why should she grant you this, Without she meant it kind? Alva. She bad me bring a friend with me, And he should judge between us of our Case; Nay she will freely there confess (she says) That her denial does not spring from hate; For she has so much Justness in her Nature, To see that all the Actions of my Life Are bent to court the honour of her Love: And yet I fear shee'l never understand An Argument so much to my advantage As may confute her of her too much Coldness. Feli. This needs must be your fault: Talk of a womans Coldness! Why who should warm the poor Wretches But we? we who are the sprightly active Animals, And they the phlegmatick passive, Sweet or not sweet, Leering or lowring visible Creatures. Fer. Peace, prithee, Brother, peace: For shame shew not your mirth When your poor friend lays open thus his wounds. Alva. Nay, let him talk; I could wish that I could talk so too: It moveth not my Anger but my Envy, To see him in so much a better state. Stay here, we're near the house. Come friend, now thou shalt see if I have Cause to mourn, That can behold the Joys of Heaven Wrapt in Hells chiefest Torment, black Despair. Fer. I hope your Love, like Children in the dark, Fancies the Bugbear you shall never see. Brother, pray stay, and see that none come up this Street till we are entred; I'le call upon you here. Feli. Well, Gallants, remember ye owe me a watching. Pedro! Ossorio! are not you two stout enough To keep this Streets end? I'le go but hard by,
And be back again before they come forth. Osso. O Lord! Sir, your Brother will take it unkindly. Pedro. Indeed, Sir, my Master will wonder if he hears on't. Feli. And I should wonder if he did not hear on't, As long as such a Tadpole, Rascally, Gurmudgeonly Whelp as thou know'st it: Sirrah do you remember The fright you put me and my poor Whore in At your Masters house, you Rogue? I got the Whole truth out of him; and I yet owe thee A beating for't, and now I have nothing Else to do I will pay my debts. Pedro. Hold, Sir, for Heavens sake hold: Here come Company. Enter Sancho. San. Oh cry you mercy, Sir! I find you were busie: pray, Sir, Let not my presence put any constraint Upon your humour; but kick him again Soundly; and that Fellow too, if your Worship Pleases: you have my leave freely. Feli. Your leave, Rascal! San. Yes my leave, Sir: Why, I can give any body leave to kick me If I please. Feli. I am one of those never ask it, kicks him. Especially of such sawcy Companions. San. Oh, your humble servant, Sir: Pray no farther; 'tis too much honour I assure you, Sir. Osso. This is the Rogue that jeer'd us to day. Pedro. I, I▪ peace, peace, man: The young Signior's blown; How a pants! Feli. This is the pleasantest Rogue that e're I Met with— Sancho within. Help! help! murther! murther! Feli. Ha, what's that? let's go see. San. No help? good people help, help. Feli. Come fellows, this way the Cry is. Exeunt all drawn.
Enter Sancho. This way Gentlemen I'm. Exit. Enter Feli. &c. Where art thou? sure 'tis some Ghost. Peeps in Sancho. Hi, hi, hi, hi! Pedro. 'Tis that Rogue jeers us. Feli. If I can but catch you— Exeunt all running. The Scene changes to a Parlour. Enter Alvaredo, Ferdinando, Elvira. Alva. But, Madam, must I never hope for more then this? Elvi. Pray ask this Gentleman If I ha'nt dealt most like a friend, That's plainly, with you, Sir: The Laws of Gratitude make me deny To tye a woman to you, when her heart Is so averse to what you now desire. Alva. Strange Paradoxes these, that out of Love You will deny me what I most esteem! Well, Madam, I will leave you, Never to see the world again: I'le be your Beadsman, since I am deny'd To be your Lover. Fer. Stay Friend. Madam, can any thing so fair Have so much Cruelty! Look with the Eyes of Justice on his Merits, You'l find so rich a Jewel worth your Care. Elvi. As which, good Sir? Fer. As yonder Gentleman you so afflict: And let me freely tell you, Madam, 'Tis peevishness, Which is as far from Virtue—— Elvi. As you from Charity, To chide me for a fault That you your self are cause of. Alva. Come friend, there is no remedy. Fer. Stay, I will have two words more.
Elvi. No, go with him; But if you will return alone, I'le tell you freely what you long to know. Exit. Fer. Ha, I understand you— Come, dearest Friend, remember 'tis a woman, Not worth the trouble of a gallant man; Think on their follies and their weakness, The scarcity of good ones in the Sex; The danger you had run in the great plenty Of evil, cunning, self-will'd, hair-brain'd women: And all these put together, Thus I would part with Love, puffs. And tread the Earth in liberty again. Alva. And thus would I advise a Friend to do: But did you know the Passion I had for her, How vain you would esteem all such advice! And guess the world should reel beyond its Orbe, And mix in great Confusion with some Star, Ere I should leave to love the fair Elvira, Mistress of all my Love and all my Hopes. Fer. Nay, rather term her, Sir, Mistress of all the Cruelty and Scorn A wilful woman ever yet did owne. Why should man lose his Birthright, and proclaim Himself a servant to a peevish Sex, That from the first was meant a slave To all his will and pleasures? Alva. Peace, Heretick! it were a sin to hear thee. 'Twas force that first made Laws to be obey'd; And that's the only priviledge that we Can claim above those beauteous Creatures. Was the poor Lamb created for the use Of wrongful, theevish, and of Ravenous Wolves? Or was the Constant Turtle only fram'd To be the Quarry of a Tyrant Hawk? These have our Plea, and had they industry Would frame as Rigid Laws as we; For all were not so strong.
Ferd. And it were justice they should be obey'd. Alva. How much of baseness then must all we owne, That stoop and bow in such humility, And treasonably court them from their strength, Which being Masters of, we then proclaim And use our usurp'd priviledge? Fer. Heyda, a womans Orator! Pray heaven your Fee Answers your Eloquence. Alva. I care not, the fault shall all be hers: But come, dear Friend, I swear I am not well. Fer. Here I did leave my Brother. Ha! Brother! Pheu! Alva. No matter, come. Exeunt. Enter Felices, leading in Sancho by the hair; Ossorio, Pedro. Feli. Oh Rogue! have I caught you? San. No. Feli. Sure I have. San. Why did ye ask the question then? Feli. A Wit too! San. The people of our Village think me one. [Pheu within.] Pedro. Yonder's my Master. Feli. Go, get ye both gone, I'le follow straight. Ex. Osso. Ped. Sirrah, what bundle of Trumpery Have you got here? San. Why, I hope you will not rob me. Feli. Rob thee, hang thee, what is't? San. Why, Sir, I was employ'd Deputy from Our Village for Vizards and fools Bawbles: You know to morrow is our Carnival. Feli. A pleasant Rogue this: Sirrah, wilt thou serve Me, I'le pay thee well; and I'le go down With more Company to thy Village? San. Yes; I think we shall be well met: Like master like man. Feli. Come then, follow me. Exeunt.
Enter Ferdinando, Pedro. Fer. If ever thou beest ask'd which way I went, Say home, directly home. Ped. I shall, Sir. Fer. And thither go you now, But if my Brother should come home before me, As he do's seldom use, Say you have mist me, know not where I am. Ped. I shall not fail in ought. Exit Pedro. Fer. What should this woman mean, She said I was the cause of his repulse; Nay, she did urge that he should bring me thither, I've seen her often at the Church with him, And she is fair, most Excellently fair; But all the while that he discours'd with her, My thought the moving Language of her Eyes Did seem to tell me, had I been the man That did implore her mercy, she had then Not been so cruel. — Here is the house I hope she doth Expect me, Knocks softly at the Window. Within, Who's there, Fer. 'Tis I, I parted just now hence. Enter Elvira. Elv. You'r wellcome, Sir, Yet did I not expect you would return so soon. Fer. 'Twere disobedience, did I but prolong The least of your Commands, and that's a Crime I never would forgive my self. Elv. And I can hardly be induc'd To grant a pardon to my foolish self That now commit a fault 'Gainst Womens Honour, and faire Modesty. Fer. 'Twere so; did you permit this favour to a man, That brought not all the reverence, and respect, So fair a presence merits, But you are safe from scandal, Relying on the strength of my discretion,
Farewell, all honesty I am o'recome, Aside And am to weak to struggle 'gainst such Charms. Elv. I hope your fair construction will admit No thoughts are tending to my prejudice, You seem'd to think I was unreasonable In the denying Alvaredo's Love, He is a Gentleman I much Esteem, But when he talks of Love, I lose all that, And almost grow to hate what I esteem'd. Fer. Madam, 'tis true, Love is a thing that cannot be constrain'd, And if a heart not yieldeth of it's self, All force and stratagems are vain. Elv. You speak most learnedly of a subject I thought you had been ignorant in. Fer. As well you may deem him a cold That's in a Calenture, Or him that faints and melts away Under the Torrid Zone; Those beauteous eyes can thaw a heart, And make an Anchorite knowing in this Art. Elv. Yet would he want this Eloquence Without some practice, I doubt I am not, Sir, the first That you have strove to flatter from themselves. Fer. But when that doubt shall be remov'd. Elv. I can but thank yee for your complement. Fer· Why will ye term it so? Here shall I swear. Kneels. Elv. Hold, Sir, you go too far, A Gallant yet did never want an Oath For the undoing of a harmless Maid; But grant I knew 'twere true, What could you then Expect in Recompence. Fer. Nothing; for 'tis your due, And what you e're shall grant of Love I will call Charity; meer mercy to your Creature; Nor will I trouble yee with tedious talk
How much I love and honour your fair beauty, Since where the truth is cleer, And in your power by any strict Command To put me to the test, All circumstance is Needless; For, Madam, as I cannot live without yee So I dare die, to shew how much I lov'd yee, Elv. That were a testimony I'le never claime, No live, and live to let me see your Love, That is the first command I'le lay upon you. Fer. Proceed, dear Madam. Takes her in his Arms; she puts him away. Elv. The next, and chiefly wherein I conjure ye By all the vertue, faith, and honour in yee, You ne're misconster this my easiness, Nor ever use a priviledge, or make an offer To what may cause a blush. Were the whole world our witness, In recompence I'll promise to be kind, And what my honour will permit, I'll grant. Fer. And by that tie I'll claim it; Can ye vouchsafe a promise to be mine? Your Brothers absence, and this fittest time Do's prompt us not to slip it. Elv. I dare believe yee, Sir. Find you the means, And I'll not foolishly pretend to know Nothing of what I've given you cause to hope. Fer. To morrow then I'll see you, And bring a man shall so unite us, Never to be parted: The Streets are full of Gambols and of Tricks, We shall not be observ'd. Elv. Farewell, Sir, 'tis late, And let my love preserve the title ever, That you to night have given it in your heart. Fer. Let all the blessings Heaven has yet in store Fall on my fair and kind Elvira's head.
ACTUS II. SCENA I. Enter Antonio, with a Guittar playing; to him Felices, Sancho. Fel. WHither away, dear friend; not know me? Ant. Felices, wellcome, wellcome, faith, so early up! 'tis Scarce day, being up at play all night I was going to Julianas lodging. Fel. What, to play the Fidler under a whores Window! Ant. Away fool, 'tis the onely ornament of a melancholly Lover, one that doats infinitely on all Women, And cares not a rush for any one in particular: A whore! why, hadst thou ever a Mistris thou didst Not wish to be so? then I have this Advantage, mine's made one to my hand. Prythee what fellow's that? Fel. Oh, an excellent Rogue I have pick'd up. San. Yes, Sir, one that was made so to his hand. Fel. Come, come, prythee, let me go with thee, Her maid will serve my turn, or any thing That's Woman, I onely love the conversation of The Sex, no harm in me. San. Yes, Signior, you may trust my master, And for my self, I can do yee prime service, And sleep (if occasion serve) upon the stairs Like a Statue half erected, or one whose props Are warp'd, and so inclineth to the Centre backwards: Ther's a Term you understand not. Ant. Away ye Rogue; Come here's the house, lets in. Fel. No, wee'll give the Donazellas A Serenade first: Sirrah, have ye no Castinets?
San. Yes Sir, here; pray give leave to keep time too With this Instrument. Ant. What, a Grid-iron? San. I'll warrant you, shall be as good Musick. As any in Sevil. Antonio Sings, they Play the Chorus still altogether. LOok out, for shame look out, And put your Lover out of Doubt, That thinks the Sun has lost his light, And that you run his Course to night. Chorus Play'd. Look out, for shame look out, And put your Lover out of doubt, That else may think he has lost his way, When not enlightned by your day. San. Heer's stuff; Nay, play on, play on, Sir, I can sing More to this Tune. Sancho Sings. Look out, for shame look out, And put your Lover out of doubt, Who's heart susteins a cruel load, Because he thinks your gon abroad. Look out, for shame look out, And put your lovers out of doubt, Who else would leave to Bawle and sing, But that they think you are within.
Fel. Look out, for shame look out, And show to us thy dainty Snout, Rather then wander in the Street, Bursts open the door with his foot and Enters. Thus Doors we open with our feet. San. That was not so Amorous now; A noise of Wo∣men within. Ant. Nay, nay, let's go in playing. Enter. Fel. Fly, fly, the Enemy, the Enemy. Draws. Ant. What's the matter, man? San. Sir, I'll run for help; But if I come again. Exit Sancho. Fel. Oh, Signior, six tall Whores able to Devour A Regiment, O my Kidneys melt to think on't! Why, I had rather fight with twelve the best Men in Sevil, O Diabolo, Rampant, rampant. Ant. Why, dost think Women can hurt us? Fel. I, I, much more then men; Why, they all leap'd about me like Fairies, And smothered me with kisses; Besides, I spy'd one I have promis'd a new Gown too This half year. Ant. Prythee, come in, Felices. Fel. Not I, one at once, were she the Devil, I durst Meet with; what charge a file of Whores! Ant. Come, I'll not leave thee. Exeunt. Enter Signior Lorenzo, and Bartolo. Lor. What hour of the morning thinks thou 'tis? Bar. 'Tis very early, Sir. Lor. And hast thou been abroad? Bar. I have, Sir. Ler. Return'd so soon? You have exprest much Care; But have you well perus'd the Markets, Bartolo, And tane a special note of what was good?
Bar. I have, Sir. Lor. Truly, I hope thou hast; for I have ever found thee Virtuously inclin'd: I have some Company must Sup with me, friends, Bartolo, my worthy friends, And I would not have them think me or Thee so ignorant, but that we can chuse The best of every thing. Bar. I hope so, Sir, else I had ill imploy'd my time. Lor. But to the point, good Bartolo, What didst thou see, prithee, let me hear thee? A stool there, boy; these Rogues Eat, and Eat, And never mind their waiting; some water For my hands there; troth, Bartolo, I have had An ill night on't, thou put'st too much Garlick in Thy sawces: Belches And yet I think 'tis good Against the wind. Bar. I can assure ye, Signior, I have lick'd my fingers in your Lordships dish this thirty years, Yet can I boldly say, I never was blest with a juster Hand, then last night, in all the seasonings. Lor. Nay, nay, I do not blame thee much, May be it do's proceed from Melancholly: There was a damn'd Colonel supp'd last night with me, Cut up some six Pyes he never tasted of, And fill'd the Wine himself, disliking what was fill'd him, And out of what Bottle think'st thou man? Bar. Not out of that mark'd with L. Lor. Yes, the same, the very same, good Bartolo. Bar. O Monstrous, I never heard of such an insolence! Lor. But I have thought of a safer means, hereafter I'll have thee wait at the Table, and my Wine Kept, so as no body but may search the Bottles at the Cup-board, yet never finde The change was put upon them: The rarest conveyance, Bartolo, I learn'd it of a wise Venetian, in my travels of Italy. Bar. And truly, my Lord, that is a subtle Nation. Lor. It is so, for I have studied much their way and manners.
Bar. But pray, my Lord, how is this Wine to be convey'd? Lor. I will prepare thee for it against night; This Water is not from the fountain, Sirra, Brings in Water. But from the River, I suspect. Page. Indeed, my Lord, it comes from both. Lor. Nay, then 'tis well, a little of all do's well, ha, Bartolo. Bar. It do's so, my Lord. Lor. What a Clock is it now; say you? Bar. The Sun's an hour high. Lor. S'death, and thou hast not told me yet What's in the Market, Bartolo. Bar. Please you, my Lord, to take your Pen in hand. Lor. Begin, I have written in Primis. Bar. For Butchers meat, the time of the year Will easily let your Lordship guess what it is. Lor. True, Bartolo, proceed to Fowl, and some Fish. Bar. Shall I begin with Fish, or Fowl? Lor. With Fish, good Bartolo, with Fish. Bar. Why, then my Lord I must assure you, I never saw The Market better fill'd; for there was of the choicest Store, but dear, extreamly dear. Lor. That's wonderful, For store (they say) is no sore; But dearness is a sore, nay, a great one, Bartolo, It pales the appetite. Bar. It do's so, my Lord. Lor. But to the particulars, good Bartolo. Bar. A brave Cods head. Lor. A Cods head, man? Bar. Yes, my Lord, a Cods head. Lor. Prythee let me hear that again good Bartolo. Bar. Why, a brave Cods head. Lor. So soon! why, by my account it should not be These five days yet in season; But prythee on, where is this Cods head? Bar. In the Governours Kitchin by this time. Lor. Yee Rogue, yee lie; In the Governours Kitchin? They know not how to
Dress it; the Heavens would never bless them with the Luck of such a Rarity; a Cods head now! So soon! it cannot be! Bar. 'Tis true, my Lord. Lor. Slave, 'twas then thy fault: This comes on thy drowzy hoggish nature; You cannot rise, you, nor look unto your Business, Sirrah; I'le have you ty'd to closer duty, Dog, And you shall turn the wheel below With your own beastly weight. Was ever man so curst as I! Such Servants! oh such Servants! I shall be starved, or else be fed With stinking Mackarel. O the brave politick Italians, That early rise to buy their meat themselves! Bar. Truly, my Lord, it is not altogether my fault. Lor. How, how can that be, let's hear? Nay, I am reasonable. Bar. Truly, I offered two Ryals. Lor. Well, and would not that do? Would not that fetch it? Bar. May be with entreaties I might have prevail'd, And promises of further custom; But in came that villainous Caterer, and out-bid Me six Maravedies. Lor. What Tyranny is this, Snatch the morsel from my mouth! The King his Master were he such a Tyrant Would finde no Subjects to owne him for their Prince. Enter a servant. Serv. My Lord, here is a young Gentleman would Speak with your Lordship. Lor. Who is it? Serv. 'Tis young Signior Felices. Lor. Oh tell him 'tis my writing day: You know he is invited here to supper; Tell him I should be glad to see him then. Come Bartolo, I'le write the rest within,
And give thee all directions for this night. Exeunt. Enter Felices, Sancho. Feli. Not speak with me? San. He sent you word you were invited to Supper; And then (as I have learnt) Is his time of speaking. Fel. But I would fain have known what Company. San. Oh his Nieces, I'le warrant you, Sir, And all his acquaintance: To night's a night of mirth. Feli. Sirrah, be sure you make us some; It was the only virtue I took you for. San. Sir, and I chose you for the same reason. Feli. How's that, you Rogue? San. Nay, Sir, this is the way home. Feli. Well, Sir. Exeunt. Enter Ferdinando. Fer. Thou Arbitrator of all humane Fate, That giv'st such fair Idaeas to the mind! Thou Passions Ruler, even that of Hate; Nay, Master of each one to which th'art joyn'd! Thou whom the wisest do Misguider call, The Tyrant of our Reason, and our Will Dost make predominant, to Act in all Without distinguishing of Good or Ill! Thou that such Flames canst kindle in one hour, Nay, thou that canst those violent Flames destroy, Shewing a Master-Beauty, one whose Power Is fram'd of all that's Love and all that's Joy! Yet thou against thy self hast now rebell'd, And brought new force where thou a Conquerour wast; And thy own Subject by bright Armes expell'd, Whom as thy Viceroy in my heart th' hadst plac't: Shall I obey thee now? speak, shall I love?
Remember what thou counseld'st me before: But who will judge but that I still shall rove, If thus I break what I so oft have swore? I, but Elvira's fair: I, too too fair, That such polluted Sacrifice as I Should dare unto her Deity appear, Scorched before by Beatrices Eye. Enter Alvaredo. Ha, her Brother! Love hide thy self, since now so guilty grown. Alva. What, melancholy, friend? Fer. I hope you are not so; And know by this time 'tis a foolish sin To pine and languish for a womans Love. Alv. No matter what I think; I'le live as merrily as thee, Or any man in Sevil; Hang looking pale, or hanging of the head: Come let's be merry, very merry; Where shall we dance to night? Or shall we go to this peevish woman's, That she may see how easily I bear her scorn? Come, wee'l go in Masquerade; Her frowns can neither make my Vizard blush With grief nor shame. Fer. This mirth is forc'd, come, I know 'tis; Do not go see the Cause again; There may be danger in't. Alv. And that's the reason I will go: She then shall see I dare her shot; Nay, would she now be kind, I would not love again. Fer. Are you sure of that? Alv. I think I should not. Fer. What, and sigh? nay, nay, believe you that will. Alv. Prithee don't think of her. Fer. Your Counsel comes too late. aside. Alv. What say'st thou, friend? Fer. I wish you did not, Sir; Nor do not think of going thither.
Alva. Nay, that I am resolv'd of; All things are ready for the Masque; Your Brother goes, and a friend or two more. Fer. Come, Sir, I'le wait on you in any thing. Alva. How ill on outward shews we place belief! My mirth is but my overflow of grief. Exeunt. Enter Quintagona, Beatrice. Quin. Come, come, Charge, I must not have You melancholy; why, d'ye know where We are going? why look up, I say, Charge, thou shalt see him: You know, I know your mind. Bea. Dear Nurse, you know I've trusted you with all The treasure of my heart. Quin. Well, well, and have I ever wrong'd your trust? Bea. I do not say thou hast, good Nurse. Qui. Why then be merry; be merry, or I'le be Out of humour, and then who shall dance the Pavan With Ossorio? Sings, Si chirés que lo ramo. Enter Miranda running. Mir. Sister, Sister, Sister! prithee come away, my Brother Is almost ready. Bea. Prithee, dear Sister, take you good notice which is Fernando; you may go any where, and see how That he does disguise: I would not be mistaken In the men. Mir. So they be not mistaken in us, no matter. Bea. They cannot: me they'l know from thee By my height. Mir. And cannot you know Ferdinando by your heart? You love? Pish, if I were in Love I could follow My Lover by instinct, (as a Dog does his Master By the scent) at two Leagues distance. Bea. Fye, Miranda, how thou talkest! Mir. Fye, Sister, how you are moapt!
If thou art ordain'd to love, love as I live, merrily. Bea. I in love? away fool, I'le turn Nun sooner. Mir. Do, good Sister, do, it is a pretty melancholy vocation That I am infinitely taken with: Here's Quintagona shall be a Lady Abbess. Quin. Why, you young Tit, I could discharge the office, For all your grinning. Mir. Why, who says the contrary, good Nurse? Quin. You are always fleering; But I shall fit you one day. Mir. With whom, good Nurse? now I thank you. Quin. I won't go now, that I won't. Bea. Nay, prithee Nurse. Why, Sister, Why dost thou vex her so? Mir. I? nay, dear Nurse, no dudgeon; You know I meant no harm. Quin. Go, go, I'de trust a Monkey in a Glass-shop sooner. Come, Charge, let's make our selves ready. Bea. Prithee, Miranda, minde what I told thee. Ex. Bea. Qui. Mir. I'le warrant you; yes buz quite contrary, I'le assure you, sweet Sister. Felices, Signior Felices! Felices with his head to the door. Feli. Here, little Mistress, what's the Matter? Mir. Can you make Love finely? Feli. Why d'ye ask? may be I can; who's to try? I hope, since she's too young her self, she set One to pimp for me. aside. Mir. Your name is Fernando to night; Be sure you lead my Sister. Adieu. Exit. Fel. What do's the urchin mean? I'll try, And do as she bids me. Exit. Enter Elvira and Bianca. Elv. Prithee Bianca, peace, thou know'st not half my mind. Bian. I'm sorry, Madam, I've bore my self so ill As not to deserve your trust now.
Elv. Indeed, wench, I durst tell thee any thing; But where thou canst not serve me, The knowledge would avail thee nothing. Bian. But still it troubles me to see you pensive, It may be sorrow, and then I would be glad to share your griefs; If it be business you do meditate, Too heads do's better far then one, At least in all I would express my duty. Elv. I thank thy love and care, And will e're long acquaint thee with my thoughts: But Prythee now go touch thy Lute; For Musick is best Physick for a mind So out of Tune as mine. Bian. Madam, I will obey in All; What will you please to hear? Exit Bianca. Elv. That which thou sang'st me yesterday. The Song. Enter Servant. Here are some Masquers without, Madam, Who desire admittance; People of quality they Seem to be. Elv. Admit them: who can they be! If it be Alvaredo he brings my Dear Fernando With him; 'tis he, I know him Enter Alvaredo, Ferdinando, Felices, Beatrice, Miranda, Quintagona & Sancho: Ser∣vants with Torches. By his Port. You're wellcome Ladies; Gallants, so are you: I know you not, but this is kindly done, And I must own the Obligation ever: You see I take a liberty though in the absence of My Brother. They Bow, Point to their own Musick for to play; Alva∣redo takes Elvira by the hand, and whispers her.
Elv. You see, Sir, I am civil, If you hint not the old improper business, Love. Alv. Oh, Madam, that is quite forgot: Speaks from his Vizard. You see I'me merry now. Why should we pine and grieve For what we cannot help? Elv. 'Tis true; and I am glad to finde you in that humor. Beckens Fernando. Enter Lorenzo, with Antonio. Lor. This is Excellent, most Excellent! Ah, gallants, when I was a young man I lov'd this Dearly; Oh, the brave Donzellas I have seen and lov'd In my travels at Venice; there who but I! My Gondalo follow'd by the best Musick, stored with The finest women; my table spread with the best Of all things; and my Bottle fill'd with best verdu Monte fiaskou vin Greco, Valga me Dios, it makes Me mad to think on't. Prithee Signior Antonio, get Your Sister, the fair Elvira, to accompany these Gallants to my house to night; I know them all, They are kindred: there is no scandal To an old mans house, a friend and servant to the Count her Brother; her father was my worthy Friend, but those days are past. Ant. I'll do my best, my Lord. Come, pray, Madam, let me intreat you thither; The time allows much liberty; Come, you must Not deny the Count Lorenzo, 'twill break His heart. Elv. 'Twill be scandalous I fear, Brother. Ant. No, no, pish, scandalous; 'tis people of meaner Quality ought to fear scandal; we are above Those things. Exeunt omnes, the Mu∣sick playing before, Except Beatrice and Felices. Elv. Will you take the blame upon you? Ant. Yes, Madam. Elv. Lead on then, my Lord.
Beat. Oh, my dear Fernando, how I long To speak with you alone! Fel. Follow me, I'll lead you to a private place, And there — Offers to hug her. Beat. What mean you, Sir? Fel. Nay, what mean you, why so coy? Come, come, I do not love it. Beat. Sure, I'me mistaken, or the man is chang'd? Fel. Nay, nay, dear mistress, ne're hang back, Come, kiss me. Beat. Ha, sure 'tis not his voice: Pull of your Vizard, Sir, and then I will. Fel. Look ye; now pull of your's, or else you break your Word. Beat. So I must; for I should burst with laughing else: Ha, ha, ha, ha, was this your trim device? Fel. What device, I had none? Beat. My sister told me you would take Fernando's name upon you, and would utter Such monstrous secrets. Fel. Of whom? of what? Beat. Why, 'tis a by-name 'twixt you and Quintagona; They say you make love to her, ha, ha, ha. Fel. Oh, this Chit! Enter Miranda. Mir. Why, sister, sister, ha, ha, ha. Beat. Oh, you're a fine Gentle-woman! Mir. Why, what's the matter? Fel. Madam, I believe this was your own design, Though you would put it on my pretty Mistress; I have seen you twitter at me before now, But I understand a Jest. Beat. A Jest, from who d'ye mean? Fel. From you, Madam; I were ill bred else. Mir. Yes, indeed, sister, 'twere pity of his life else. Beat. So, so, this is fine! Enter Quintagona. Fel. Why, look Madam, here's one Can end the doubt; Come hither Duck, Did ever I make love to yee?
Quin. Make Love to me! hang thee. Feli. Pa, Nurse, pa, bug words! Mir. Nay, fie, Nurse, t'use a Civil Gentleman so! Quin. Hang him, I say again, and you too. Mir. What, both on's, Nurse? Points to her Sister. Quin. Yes, him and you: Come, Charge, What do you do amongst them? I won't still be us'd so by a Grashopper And a Weather-Cock: why should you be jeering me Still? I bred you: weeps. Besides, God made me as well as you. Mir. Nay, nor half so well neither; I think I may speak that without vanity. Feli. Indeed, Nurse, that was over-weening: As handsom as your young Mistress! Quin. Well, well, come Charge: Nay, you're e'en fit for one another. Ex. Qui. Bea. Mir. Ha, ha, ha! Feli. I wish we were, Nurse. Ex Feli. Mir. ACTUS III. SCENA I. Enter Lorenzo leading Elvira; Alvaredo, Antonio, Ferdinando, Beatrice, Miranda, Quintagona; Servant and Attendants. Lorenzo. YOu're welcome, Gallants, infinitely Welcome: there is no pleasure Like to this, Meet our Friends, and eat Together! well fare England say I; for I have been inform'd by credible Merchants, That there they often meet together, eat Together, and drink together. Come, Come, take your Seats. Madam, what Think you of an Ayre, as they are serving
In? nay, it shall be one of my own Composing; For, some years past, when I was not so Much taken up with business, I did employ My time in Poesie. Elv. What you please, my Lord. Lor. Bartolo, bid them sing the Song was Sung when I acted the Sea-god with the Cornucopia. Ah, Bartolo, those were merry Days! thou didst Act Tantalus, I remember: troth It was a very dainty Masque; for all The Company were kept in suspence till the last, and Did never comprehend what we meant. Fer. That could not chuse but be rare. Lor. Why, I have writ Verses That the best Wit in Sevil will never be able to Understand. Anto. Very likely, my Lord: But I hope these we are to hear They serve whilst this is singing. Are not of that strain. Lor. That you shall be Judge of. The SONG. THose that do talk of Sysiphus stone, Which makes him continually rolling to sweat; And call that a Hell, when in faith it is none; For no Torment is like to the wanting of meat. Then alack poor Tantalus, Tantalus cryes, I only can feed by the sight of my Eyes! The Vulture that feeds on Prometheus heart, Oh how happy does him poor Tantalus think! For when he has quite consumed that part The Curse of the Wretch affords new meat and drink. Then alack poor Tantalus, Tantalus cryes, I only can feed by the sight of my Eyes!
When first against heaven the Giants did rebell, It was not Ambition that made them such Hectors; But hearing of dainty Ambrosia tell, They had a mind to taste of it, and tipple the Nectar. Then, &c. Anto. Most excellent, faith! But pray what Feet do you allow Your Verses, my Lord? Lor. Feet, ha, ha, ha! Pox of Feet; let them regard them That live by them. Mir. Pray, my Lord, who are they? Lor. Why, Dancing-Masters, Foot-men, And Treaders of Mortar. Mir. Nay, my Lord, I can name you Another sort of men that live by their feet: What think you of Cowards that run away To save their lives? yet more Miraculous, I have seen a man take breath By his feet. Lor. May be, young Lady, you have heard so; For I think I know the world as well as you; And yet I do not remember the knowledge Of any such matter. Oh stay, may be it is The little begging Boys that stand on their heads In Normandy, as I have read. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, ha! Mir. No, no, my Lord, it is the man That teaches the Teresian Nuns to play on The Organs; for he blows the Bellows with his Own natural feet. Lor. By my faith, that is true; 'Twas well thought on I confess. But come, Gallants, take your Seats; Me thinks here is some body wanting: Signior Ferdinando, where is your Brother?
Fer. I know not, my Lord; But he will not fail to be here I know. Lor. Fail! no marry I hope so, H'll not serve his old friend so. Come, Signior, I begin a Health. Who waits there! Come, every man his glass: Bartolo, see mine fill'd high. They give every one a Glass: the Page fills his Lords from behind Bartolo. Signiors, a Health to all these Ladies; send them rich, proper, And able men to their husbands. Enter Felices. Fel. S'death, Sancho, didst thou see that conveyance. They all drink. San. See it, yes, and do admire at it: Pray, Sir, appear not yet, I'll make your Excuse, And take upon me to wait. Felices stands undiscovered. Lor. Who are you, friend? Then Enter Sancho. San. A servant to Signior Felices, Who begs your Lordships pardon for his stay, And desires you will proceed in your mirth, He hopes to wait on you before the end on't: Lor. He shall be wellcome, friend. Mir. My Lord, these Ladies will take it ill if you make No distinction, they will think the time long If they stay till I deserve a husband. Lor. I humbly crave their pardons, Ladies, I thought no harm. Elv. Fie, my Lord, you must not seriously consider What is spoke in mirth. Beat. I find, my Lord, you are not acquainted with The mad humour of my young sister, she says Any thing to any body. Lor. Say ye so, faith, young Lady, and I'll drink Your health in particular for that too. Nay, all these Ladies; Some wine to all there (Bartolo, I say; Boy be careful:) And yours, pretty Cousin, thus I begin. Whil'st they are all filling the second time, Sancho steals a
Tankard, and when the Page has done behind, Bartolo, Emptyes the rest in, and conveys it to the Cup-board. Ant. Mine's off, my Lord. Lor. I thank yee, Sir, Signior Alvaredo, Signior Fernando, Come lets be merry, Nay, wee'll have a Masque anon; shall we not, Faith wee'll all be very merry. Alv. As you please, my Lord. What shall the subject be, my Lord. Lor. How Vulcan and Venus were Catcht in a Net together by the cunning of that Cuckoldly Rogue Mars. Mir. We had better have a devout story, How Jonas swallowed the Whale, and spew'd him up Upon the Coast of Gibraltar. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha. Lor. Truly, young Cousin, 'twas the Whale swallowed Jonas, As I it take; I'm sure my book is false printed else. Mir. Well, well, that's all one, it was one of them: Lor. That I confess; Come, gallants, now to the fair Elvira, in particular, Boy, some wine; wine there to those Gentlemen. Boy. Pish, Bartolo, the Devil, here's none in; Bar. Away, ye fumbling Rogue. Lor. Why, Sirrah, where's this wine. Boy. My Lord, the Cock is stop'd. Fer. Come, my Lord, your glass, your glass. Lor. Ye Rogue, ye Dog, to the Cupboard. San. Ha, ha, ha, Enter, Sir, Enter, now is your Cue. Enter, Fel. Ha, ha, ha, ha; ha, ha, ha. Comes in, stumbles upon the screen, through which Lorenza's head falls, they all rise. Lor. Boutua, Crispo, help me,
Here, my head is in the stocks. Sancho goes to help him, and cuts off half his Beard, San. So, my Lord, so. Have I not trim'd him well? to Felices. Fel. Away, Rogue, be not seen. How is it, my Lord? I crave your pardon. Lor. Why, very well, very well, no harm, Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Lor. You'r very merry, Gallants, troth I'm glad to see you so, Come, wee'll in, and see the masque, this screen has discompos'd Our table, Bartolo, Cover again within. Bar. Gesous. Lor. What ails the fellow: Bar. Ails me, quoth'u? Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Lor. Pray walk in, Gallants, pray walk in; I'm glad to see you thus merry, Come, I'll lead the way. Exit Lorenzo. Alv. Antonio, how the Devil came his Beard off? Ant. Ha, ha, ha, I know not, I, Fel. Nay, 'tis but half his Beard, Come Ladies, let's in, I hope he wont perceive It all this night. Mir. This is your doings, I'll lay my life, But I swear 'twas quick, none could perceive how. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Ferdinando. Fer. A man so much unfit to mix with mirth Converts to poison what is others joy; I have done wrong to my fair Beatrice, Nor will her Brother, though he be my friend, Forget an injury of such a Nature, Should she disclose it to him: As sure she must. Elvira too; his Mistriss; O my fate! Nay, rather, O my falshood! Why, didst thou swerve to my undoing so!
They both are fair. Nor was it that I thought Elvira fairer then the other was, But mans inconstant nature still must crave, A Beauty that hee's not acquainted with, Why should it, though? Oh, Ask the god of love, and surely he Will say, that ranging proves his Deity. Pedro, Come hither, Enter Pedro. Here take this note, and leave it in my Brothers Chamber, I am resolv'd to leave the Town to night, Make my things ready, you must follow me. Ped. I'll do all your Commands With the most expedition I can, Pray, master, let me wait upon you, Whither is't you go? Fer. To Salamanca; some troubles I expect, And will not wait their sad arrival. Ped. What, here, Sir? Fer. I, here, what's that to thee? I will away to night. Ped. Where shall I meet you, Sir, Fer. I'll. ——— Ped. I shall not fail, Sir, What shall I tell your other servants? Fer. Bid them look well unto my house, And there expect my farther Orders, Let them pay my Brother The same respect they would do me, Make haste, for I'll expect you where I said. Ped. Ha, what whim is this? Presto, be gone, and none knows why; His Brother knows not on't neither, There's something more then yet I understand; Oh, now I suspect shrewdly. Enter Beatrice. Beat. Pedro, where is thy Master? Ped. Madam? Beat. Where is your Master, friend? Ped. Why, Madam, I suppose you know.
Beat. Prithee, tell him I must needs speak with him, And have taken this opportunity to slip out. Ped. Madam, hee's already on his journey; Beat. Journey, what journey? O my I'll boding mind. Aside. Ped. Nay, Madam, you may trust me, I am to follow him presently. Beat. Trust thee; I that I will with any thing, Come, I'll go with thee, But think'st thou hee's already out of Town? Ped. I, I, Madam, he wait's our coming at. — Beat. Disloyal man, but yet I'll be Aside. Reveng'd or die in's sight, — Canst thou not help me to disguise my self, One of thy Masters sutes will serve. Ped. Yes, Madam, I'm going home, A sute of his will be too big, borrow you another, There's none can see you Enter, I have the key of the back gate, And there — Beat. I understand you, friend; some lead the way, Exit Ped. 'Tis anger now, not love shall be my guide Since he is false; Anger I'll be thy bride. Exit Beat. Enter Miranda, Quintagona. Miran. I know? how should I know where she is? You are her Counseller, can't you tell? Quin. Come, Come, leave your flirts and your tricks, And do not fright me so; I'm sure the care I have still had of you Do's not deserve this usage. Crys. Mira. Away, away, do's your Reverend wit Think to put a trick upon me? Quin. I, I, Why, when did I play tricks, Troth either tell me quickly, or I'll acquaint
Your Brother with your dealings, I play tricks? Mir. I, do, do Nurse, hee'l thank ye for the care You take of us; Quin. O Heavens, I shall be Murthered? Crys and kneels. If ever you'll have mercy on my rage, Deliver me now from my Apprehensions. Mir. What apprehensions, Nurse, prithee speak, Art thou serious; Quin. I, I, too too serious; Why I saw Don Fernando steal away; And presently after followed your sister; I thought it was but to talk a word In private; but now alack aday, where are they! O Foolish creature! could she not tell me her mind, I would have contriv'd all better, Now if my Master should miss her, Oh, here he is! what shall we say? Enter Alvaredo, Felices. Alv. What made him go away so suddenly, I saw him drest in deepest Melancholly, From the first moment that he entred here. Fel. Faith, Sir, I know not; 'Tis a disease you never saw me troubled with. Alv. Quintagona, where is my sister? Quin. Oh, Sir! she has been very ill, and has Tane Don Elvira's Coachhome. Alv. Why did you let her go alone? Go, follow, ye old fool. Quin. I shall, Sir. Come, young Mistriss. Exit Quint. Miranda going out. Mir. Don Felices, pray follow immediately to our house, I must needs speak with you. Fel. What, more devices? Mir. No, I am serious. Fel. Well, I'll be with you strait. Alv. Come, let's go see if that he be gone home, Fel. Content I'll wait upon you, Sir. Exeunt.
The Scene changes to the Country. Enter Ferdinando fighting with 3 or 4 Rogues. Fer. Nay, stay Villains, run from one man! Enter 2 more, and sieze him behind. 1. Are you so stout, Sir? Come, we can tame yee. Fer. Unhand me, Rogues; Is it my Purse ye want? take it, And be gone. 2 Rogue. We thank yee for nothing; You give us what yee cannot keep. Fer. What then? is it my Life? Who set ye on to do this mischief? 3 Rogue. No, that wee'l spare, if you'l be quiet: Come, bind him, Fellows. Fer. I must submit to what I cannot help. they bind him. 2 Rogue. To tell you true, we're men condemn'd Unto the Gallies, Sir; But lately we have slipt our Chain, And are in danger of the Hermandad, Whose Officers are all in quest of us: Having not wherewithal to carry us any whither, We have pitch'd upon this Course Till we can better provide for our safeties. 3 Rogue. Come, Sir, you must with us to our private Retreat; and if Fortune favour us, we hope This night to bring yee Company. 1 Rogue. Yes truly, Signior; for we are resolv'd To stop all Comers and Goers till morning. Fer. You'l use me civilly, I hope; It shall be worth ye more Then what you otherways can get: And if in the morning you will let me go, I'le pay a better Ransome then what I bear About me. 2 Rogue. Yes, who shall be so bold to fetch it?
Fer. Why, you or any man; I will engage my Honour for your safety. 1 Rogue. Come, Sir, wee'l talk of that within. Fer. This I deserve for my disloyalty: There's none of these yet half so bad as I. Exeunt. Enter Quintagona, Miranda. Quin. What say you now, Lady? Ah, wo is me, I am undone, undone for ever! weeps. Mir. So have I seen Rain trickle through an old Crackt ceiling; Alas, poor Nurse! Quin. I, I, is this all your Care for your Sister? Mir. Why, I warrant you she's in a better place, And better Company. Quin. Marry, God forbid; what, dead! Mir. No, no, I mean in a place and company Of her own chusing. Quin. Ay me, here's my Master! Bell rings. Mir. See, Nurse, see, I'le not stay the first Brunt. Quin. No, no, stay, Madam, it is Qui. peeps through the door. Signior Felices. Enter Felices. Mir. Oh you are welcome, Sir; We're all undone here, my Sister's lost. Feli. Lost! how so? you jest sure. Quin. Nay, nay, 'tis too true; I'le be hang'd if some Fellow has not A finger in the Pye. Feli. What Pye? what finger, goody Quintelin? Quin. Why, your sweet Brother: S'flesh, a look'd like an honest man. Feli. Why, do you know him to be otherwise, Old mouldy-Chops. Quin. What if I do, or do not, I may say My pleasure, I hope, for all you? Nay, faith, I dare swear you stand much Upon your honest reputation too. Mir. Nay, fye, Nurse, fye, is this the way
To oblige a Gentleman in your business? Quin. My business! I'de rather Never have my business done whil'st I breathe Then be beholding to such spindle-shanks. Fel. Ha, ha, ha. Quin. I, I, you had need laugh, But I hope my Master will not be fob'd so. Fel. Your Master? Pray, young Mistriss, what do's this woman mean? Mir. Why truly, Sir, my sister is gone, And (she suspects) with your Brother. Fel. My Brother! Ha; Why should they do that by stealth Which I know your Brother would not Have disallowed of; for none can doubt The brightness of her honour, nor (I hope) His honesty. Mir. Nay, truly, Sir, I know nothing. Fel. I have something in my head — As soon as I hear any thing, I'le come and bring you tidings. Mir. You oblige me, Sir, extreamly. Fel. Mistriss, I kiss your hands, Adieu Lots wife — I like not this. Exit. Mir. Come, stop the source of those most Orient Pearls. Quin. Well, well, you shall see when your Brother comes home, What Orient words hee'll give us all. Exeunt. ACTUS IV. SCENA I. Enter Alvaredo. Alv. IT cannot be: He cannot be so much unjust; I was his friend. Had he but spoke, he might have had My full consent; to steal my sister from me;
It is not well; nor will I suffer it. Rings the Bell. A Servant, To the Door. Tell your Master I must needs Speak with him. Serv. Sir, Hee's not at home. Alv. Is Signior Felices within? Serv. Yes, Sir. Alv. Call him. Serv. I shall, Sir. Alv. If I do finde he was consenting to it I'le first begin with him. Enter Felices. You'r wellcome, Sir, Cannot you guess the reason; Why I visit you thus early? Fel. No, truly, Sir, But I was coming to your house, That I might farther understand a thing I do not comprehend as yet. Alv. What was it, pray you? Fel. My Brother's gone, And none as yet knows whither, If he has trusted you with his intentions, Pray ease me of a care I'me burthened with. Alv. 'Twas much about such business That I came hither to learn the truth of you. Fel. Concerning what, pray, Sir? Alv. Know you any thing of my sister? Fel. Not I, upon my Honour. Alv. It may be so: For though I am a Spaniard, yet I would not Place the fault of one ill man Upon the whole family. Fel. I hope you do not mean my brother, I must not hear you give him such a title. Alv. If I do find he has done done me wrong, You, and all the world shall hear much more: Nay, in his blood I'le sign my deep revenge. Fel. Were you not friends? Alv. 'Tis that which makes his fault the greater.
Fel. If he has sin'd against the Sacred Rule Of honourable friendship, I'm his Enemy; But if an Equal difference hath hapned, I am his Brother, and dare own his cause. Alv. To shew you I'll be just, Even to that Sacred Rule you lately mention'd, I will not tax him, till I find all certain; Do you but joyn with me to find the truth, Which if it do confirm my just suspitions, And you continue in your late professions, My anger then will look upon your blood To be the same as his; Though there it shall not Rest; But — Fel. Pray, Sir, let's understand one another, You seem to have a cause of just resentment, But why, as hitherto I'm ignorant of. Alv. Sir, I am wrong'd in the Honour of our House, My sister's gone, lost, convey'd away. Fel. By my Brother, Sir? Alv. I have reason to think so, Is he not wanting at the same time? Fel. That is no Argument; for I believe You would not have deny'd them your Consent, Their qualities are equal, and their fortunes Hold no great disproportion. Alv. That makes me know, if he be gone with her, He means no fair play to her Honour. Fel. Judge not so ill before you know all truths, Whence went she? Alv. From the Count Lorenzo's In Donna Elvira's Coach. Fel. Know of the Coach-man where he set her down. Alv. You Counsel well, come wee'll about it strait. Exeunt.
Enter Pedro. Ped. 'Twas well I could escape; For I can do my Master service here, Besides, it was not base to run away, When like a Ram I can return with Greater force; Rogues I shall have ye In a Pound by and by; I remember Your lurking hole, for they brought In Prisoners so fast they quite forgot me to binde, And in the dark I slip'd away; But she is Fast, and I perceiv'd my Poor Master bound To his good-behaviour; I will not Acquaint the Justice, that may displease him, If she be taken with him; I'll first to his Brother, whom I hope I may trust; and according To his orders — I long to be at these Rogues again.

What business can he have, With this my Servant? Fel. Madam, I am, but dare not tell the secret, Without his leave. Elv. Where is your Brother, Sir? How chance he is not with him? I thought they were inseparable. Fel. This business do's concern my Brother. Elv. Your Brother? how pray, Sir? Fel. Nay, I am in the dark my self. Elv. May I not know the business? Fel. Any thing that concern'd my self You might Command; but this — Alv. I am fool'd, O that old Hag. Fel. Have ye learn'd any thing? Alv. No, nothing, pray, Sir, come with me, Madam, I kiss your hands. Elv. Sir, Sir, Pray let me speak with you? Alv. Your pardon, Madam, for some moments, I'll wait on you again.

We cannot; nor would I, if I could, have ye Punish'd, since ye but took to furnish your Necessities. 1 Thief. True, Sir; for we are young men, Not condemn'd Slaves, as we first told yee; Something we wanted to make us merry, And having that, farewel. Fer. Nay, one word, Gentlemen; unbind us first, And on our Honours wee'l not stir till you Be out of sight. 2 Thief. Come, Sirs, wee'l trust ye. unbinds them. Fer. Would yee but leave our Swords 'Twere noble in you; for I would not Willingly go back to Sevil. 1 Thief. That you may say ye met with Gentlemen,
Wee'l get on Horse-back, and e're we're out Of sight wee'l drop them; there you may Take them up at leasure. Fer. I thank ye, Gentlemen. 2 Thief.

Come then, I'le wait upon you. Exeunt. Enter Felices, Alvaredo. Feli. What do you mean to do? Pray, Sir, content your self: I yet dare swear my Brother is not guilty of this Thing; in fine, I am resolv'd to find all out, And then deal like a Gentleman with you. Alv. I thank you, Sir: My old Hag told me she was gone home In Donna Elvira's Coach; The Fellow swears he never saw her, Nor any other woman but his own Lady. Feli. I cannot answer any thing to that.

No, I dare answer, Sir, for her: But pray stay you at home; I'le be with you again suddenly, And, upon my Honour, learn what truth I can:
Will this satisfie you? Alv. It must, for ought I see. The Curse of this Disgrace, and this my state, Is, not to know where I should place my hate. Come Gentlewoman. Exeunt Alv. Mir. Enter Pedro. Ped. Sir, Sir, hist, come from that door. Feli. Oh Pedro, where is my Brother? Ped. In Hucksters hands: Pray, Sir, take what Servants with you you can; I'le lead you where you shall find him. Feli.

Why didst thou not bring him with thee, Diego? Coa. He promis'd to be here as soon as I. Elv. Go wait his coming at the Gate. Exit Diego. How cruel are the Extasies of Love! With what uneasie Passions do they charm! For womens Souls they to Convulsions move, And for one good they cause a thousand harms: For those that truly love have cruel Fears, Black Doubts, and heart-afflicting Jealousies. Men falshood only have; we only tears; Their Perjury claims Tribute from our Eyes. Why should it though? Then tears ye come too late; For never could ye falshood yet reclaim; Revenge more proper is to argue hate; Revenge more fit for him that is to blame: For he had all my Love and all my Wealth;
A Virgins Love her chiefest Jewel is: Why should he then absent himself by stealth? Why should I mourn for what he did amiss? But I will seal my Love in fitter place, Where more desert does move to my relief; But first he must revenge my sad disgrace, And punish him that's Authour of my grief. Oh, here he is! Enter Alvaredo. Sir, you are welcome: I hope you will excuse the liberty I take Of sending for you. Alv. Madam, you know your Power over me; You may command all here. Elvi. Pray, Sir, then tell me, What Lady was that you examin'd my Servant about? Alv. I only ask'd if he had carried home Any other besides your self last night. Elvi. But who, pray who wast? Alv. No body, Madam, That can possibly concern your knowledge. Elvi. You know not, Sir, what interest I claim in your affairs. Alv. I hope, Madam, though you cannot love me, My troubles are not matter of mirth to you; I never did deserve that from you. Elvi. I never had so base a thought. Alv. Why, 'twas my Sister, Madam. Elvi. Who, Donna Beatrice! what of her? Alv. She's gone, and none knows whither. Elvi. Nor with whom? who do you suspect? Alv. A man that was my friend: I dare not name him; I would not willingly mistake. Elvi. Who can that be? Not that same Gentleman was here with you? Alv. The same; I cannot think on't with patience. Elvi. It were too great a trial of your temper But to perswade you to it:
Such injuries ought not to be forgiven. Alv. Nor shall they, whilest I breathe. Elv. Now I must tell you, You were much to blame to be repulst at one Denial, Sir: May be I may be brought to love. Alv. Ha! nay then farewell all grief, I ne're can feel one having such a joy. Elv. But Sir, though I have ever thought Your honour fair, Let not this extasie blinde you so far To make you lose your yet fair reputation: A man with such a stain Deserves no Ladies love. Alv. Nor will I beg it till I be as white As your fair virgin thoughts. Elv. I now do claim so much an interest That I would help you in your just revenge. Alv. Heavens! how I glorie in your blessings now. Madam, though on my knees I thank you; None but my self is wrong'd, None but my self shall right those ill-plac'd wrongs: And since my Mistris preaches honour to me, I'll give him what he not deserves, A fair and honourable trial How ill such injuries can be maintain'd. Elv. This nobleness makes me enamour'd of your virtues, Sir. It's true, he not deserves it; But such a cause is odds enough against him. Alv. Madam, I am unfit as yet To stay with you, and such a stain about me, Farewell, my fair, and noble Mistris. Exit. Elv. What have I done! O! I have been too violent: Ha! no: he that would break my heart Deserves my utmost crueltie. Thou canst not Love, with anger hold debate: For thou art madness once being turn'd to hate. Exit.
Enter Beatrice having snatch'd up both the Swords, Ferdinando going back before her. Bea. Thou art a Villain and a Slave, I know: Thou hast committed murther on my Brother, Why shouldst thou steal away by night, And he not with thee? Didst thou not say thy name was Ferdinando? He lov'd thee much, And would not leave his friend in a Distress. Fer. What means the Youth? he's mad: Your Brother! why, I know not who you mean. Bea. No, have you not seen some Features like to these? I am Alonzo, Brother to Alvaredo, A Student late at Salamanca; And I will have account before you go What is become of him. Fer. How strong is Nature, when by hidden means It works revenge for unknown injuries! aside. Bea. What answer can you make to this? Fer. Nothing: I do deserve to dye, Though your Brother's well, for ought I know. Those Eyes have murthered me already. aside. Oh my Beatrice, I do deserve this punishment! And from a Brother, a Brother too so like thee, I would not grieve to take it —— But why should he constrain me to a suffering I of my self am willing to undergo? He must not, shall not. Bea. Thou hast so much of guilt in thy false looks, That I must sure do well in punishing. Ferd. closes with her with his hat, and disarms her. Fer. Look you, Sir, now you are at my mercy. Bea. Which I defie; here, Villain, do thy worst. Fer. Hadst thou another face I would have kill'd thee For that word:
Here take your sword, young man, And tempt not one given over to despair. Beat. Not tempt thee? yes, I will with all the terms That can provoke a courage in a Coward. Fer. Prithee be gone, I will not fight with thee. offers to go out. Beat. Stay, perjur'd man; See what thou hast done: She offers to kill her self; he strikes away her sword. A woman that did love thee, will die for thee. Fer. Heaven's, what do I hear! Fall, fall, some mountain on this head, To cover it from shame. Beat. Thou art more cruel in preventing this, Then all thy other perjuries; What did thy poor Beatrice ever do, To deserve this usage from thee? Some cruel Tygre, or a Panther bred thee, Thou never wast nurs'd up with womens milk, But suck'st the Air of falshood for thy nourishment. Ha, weep'st thou? O those dissembling tears, They're able once again to Cozen me. Fer. No, Madam, stop your heart against all mercy, I do confess they not deserve your pity, But do not hate my memory, I am willing to expiate my crime, Forgive, fair Beatrice, thy dying Martyr. Offers to kill himself. Beat. Hold, Sir, for the same moment you shall hurt She draws a Dagger. That breast, I'll open mine, and overtake Ye once more in your flight: I'll do it.— Fer. Why, would ye have me live? And so unfit to bear the name of man. Beat. Those that had so much Love can never be Without a mercy to forgive all faults. Fer. Oh, my fair Beatrice, kneels. Did you but know How hard my honesty has been Attach't, You would some reason have to pity,
If not quite forgive my youthful fault; For when I found that I had err'd, I knew my self unfit for you, And was resolv'd Never to do another Right. Beat. You could not, Sir, whil'st that you did me wrong: But let this be your penance, tell me true, It was not then aversion made you leave me, But that your love had been divided. Fer. It had so for a moment, But if this heart do ever more rebel, Let heaven afflict it with it's greatest curse. Beat. Rise, Sir, I will once more believe. Enter Felices Ser∣vants Running. Fel. Ha, Swords drawn! my brother On his knees! Hold Villain, hold. Fer. Ha, brother, hold, for heavens sake, hold, Send away your Servant's, I have a story for Your Ear in private: be gone fellow's. Exeunt Serv. Fel. Oh, I understand ye, Come, I'll conduct ye both unto the Town; But, Madam, I'll not part ye, when you're down. Exeunt. ACTUS V. SCENA I. Enter Lorenzo, Bartolo. Bart. PRay, my Lord, do not go abroad. I dare not tell him, hee'll be out on's wits. aside. Lor. Why not? why not, good Bartolo? It is a day of mirth, I love to see them merry: I was a merry man when I was young, And lov'd these brave Devices; Once on this time of Carnival I rid, And with a Line and Hook I firk'd the peoples hats off, 'Tis true some unruly fellow's grew angry, and I was beaten,
But all the Ladies said I fish'd for hearts, They were so taken with my Garb. Bar. Very likely, my Lord, But why will you go now? you are not of an age To Masquerade it through the streets. Lor. What then, ye fool? Think'st I have I cannot see others? ha? Bar. Yes, my Lord; But here every body will see you. Lor. Why, what then? I have committed no treason. I dare be seen; the fellow's drunk. Bar. Nay, my Lord, what you please, Would I durst tell ye though. aside. Lor. Here wee'll stand; here we can see all; Hark, I here some coming this way. Enter Sancho with Quintagona, Rabble. San. Oh, yonder's Game for me; I have been game for others all this while. Lor. A pleasant couple; Look, Bartolo, is not this very Pleasant? Bar. Oh, Yes, my Lord, very pleasant. Aside You little think that you are the pleasanter sight of the two. San. Most renowned, most worthy, and most munificent Lord. Lor. I thank thee, friend; But prythee keep on thy way: Do not address thy self in particular to me. San. To you, my Lord? Why, to whom is respect, and address more proper? By this my beard, (which I think is a fair one.) Lor. Prythee keep it so still with thy Bygotero's, And about thy business. San. Why, I am so, my Lord; But, as I said before, there is none in Sevil. Lor. That will be sooner, or more angry with you, If you depart not presently.
Dost thou see how the Rabble gather? San. What care I, or what need your Lordship care for the Rabble? By this Beard I swear again, And that's no small Oath for a man of my profession. Lor. Why, what profession art thou of? San. A Barber, my Lord. Lor. A good trade; Nay, prithee away now. San. Heaven forbid I should displease your Lordship, By this Beard I would not do it for the Indies. Lor. Now a plague on thy Beard, and a Pox on thee; Nay, such a Pox as may plague thy Beard too; Here's ado with it. Bartolo? prythee thrust him away. Bar. Away, friend, be gone, This Rogue has found him out. aside. San. Why, friend, the street is as free for me as you, By my Beard, thy Beard, and thy Lords Beard, I do infinitely Honour, Worship and admire. Lor. Ye Rogue, swear by my Beard? Why, I can do that my self; and will: For if you be not presently gone, I'll have ye cudgell'd, By these Honourable Mustachio's I will; Ha; why, Bartolo; what's this? Misses his Beard. San. Ha, ha, ha, come, duck, I will not stay to offend your Lordship. Exit San. Quin. Lor. Ten thousand Devils, and their Dams, My Beard? Hieco de Puta, my Beard. Bar. Is quite gone on the one side, my Lord. Lor. Why? thou Dog, thou Mungril, Wouldst thou let me come abroad, And not tell me on't? I have been sport for all comers and goers. Bar. Why, my Lord, you mist it not when you Came abroad; this fellow has bewitch'd you. Lor. Have mercy on me, Heaven! A witch, a witch, Run Bartolo for an Officer, I'll have him in the Inquisition; a witch.
Bar. My Lord, he's gone; Or by this time has transform'd himself Into some other shape: Oh, he's a cunning Rogue. Lor. 'Tis too true; But I, poor miserable I, What respect shall people pay me now? No Beard no Brain they'l cry; A Boy, a meer Tom-boy I shall appear: My Servants too will make me still their mirth, Who have been still their Terror. Bar. My Lord, I know a remedy for all. Lor. What is't, good Bartolo? oh, some comfort, prithee. Bar. Why, my Lord, this time of Carnival It may pass for a youthful frollick, And after Ash-wednesday, You may say it was a Penance enjoyn'd you By your Ghostly Father: But for Decorum you must cut off The other side; thus it is very ridiculous. Lor. Thou counsell'st well; I would not have my Servants see me so for a thousand Pistols: Hast thou no scissers, good Bartolo? Bar. No, my Lord, but I have a knife. Lor. Come then, cut it off presently. Bartolo cuts, and Lor. makes faces. Oh, oh, oh! Bar. So, my Lord, 'tis done. Lor. Come, Bartolo, I have seen enough for this day: A Plague of all Witches! a beard-witch! O Diavolo! Exeunt. ACTUS V. SCENA II. Enter Felices, Alvaredo. Fel. YOu may believe me, Sir, He was as ignorant as you about her flight. Alv. But still he us'd her ill;
And I should bear her injuries as hard As I should bear my own. Fel. Pardon me, Sir, it was no injury, It was unkind, I must confess. Alv. Then I understand not well. Fel. Why, Sir, he does owne he did make Love to her, And that, as far as Modesty could grant, He had no reason but to think She did love him; But finding that his Youth and Love Had brought him farther then he ought to have gone Without acquainting you, He was resolv'd to slip away About some feign'd business for a time; And then, with your fair liking, He would begin his Suit afresh: But she, ignorant of his Design, And learning from his man that he was fled, Thought it a falshood unto her, And so resolves for S. Teresa's Monastery. But he being found, (Happily stopt last night by Thieves) I hope to see her of another Order. Alv. I do believe you, Sir, as you're a Gentleman; And since your Brother is resolv'd To do her Reputation right, I cannot erre, I think. Fel. Not possibly, Sir. Alv. To shew you, Sir, A perfect reconciliation to your Family, I chuse you for my friend, And now will tell you all my secrets. This business (I know not how) Has brought me to a fair understanding With my fair and dear Elvira; And since my Honour now is cleer, I'le to her strait; And you shall be a witness to me in't.
Fel Why, Sir, had she enjoyn'd The cleering of your Honour? Oh, I understand yee. I have a message to her. aside. Alv. Not enjoyn'd me; But, as one interessed in me, Did counsel no neglect of what was fit. Fel. Well, Sir, since you have honoured me With the fair title of your Friend, Let me advise you; I'le to her strait; It will appear much better, For several reasons: Here is the house, Pray go you home, I'le wait upon you there, And I doubt not but with such happy News, As the first Enterview you have Shall bring a Period to your wishes. The cleering of this business Will appear better from him or me. Alv. Well, Sir, I will be rul'd; For though you are wild I have ever found you A gallant and an honest man. Adieu. Fel. I never, Sir, will give you cause to think the contrary; If I do, tell my young Mistress, Whom really I do love. Alv. Nay, I'le be your Spokesman there. Exit Alv. Felices rings. Enter Servant. Fel. Pray tell your Lady I needs must speak with her. Serv. I shall, Sir. Exit Servant. Alv. Now if I can but quite unhinge her love, And fix it on Alvaredo, All goes well—— Enter Elvira. Fel. Madam, I'm come to wait upon you, But with the Dread That men approach offended Deities. Elv. How can that be?
You never did me wrong. Fel. It is a crime to be a kin to him That ever could offend you, Though by ignorance. Elv. Those that are wise Pardon the Crimes of folly and mischance; But I find my self griev'd by neither of these two. Fel. Do but consider your own Beauty, Madam, The certain tyes it hath upon Affection, The ever yet unconquered god of Love, That dips his scorching Arrows in your eyes, And hardens so their Points, No Armour, though of strictest honesty, Is proof against their force: All these are Arguments to move your mercy To the forgiveness of a Crime I now am come to beg a Pardon for. Elv. Pray Sir, (without the Ornaments you now do use, In rallying of a Lady never wrong'd you) Tell me your Business; for as yet I know not what you aim at. Fel. Nor is it fit I should express my self in plainer terms: But tell me; If you had bargain'd for, nay, had bought a thing before me, Would you not take it ill I should out-bid you in your price, And by my Liberality corrupt the Merchant? Elv. Yes, I should, Sir; neither were it just or honourable. Fel. This is my Brothers Case, Who dares not live, Nor think himself worthy the name of Man Till you have pardon'd. Remember, Madam, as I told you, How much your Beauty can out-bid All other Women. Elv. Oh, I understand you, And thank you, Sir, that you have spar'd my blushes:
But tell me, Sir, is not the Lady's name Beatrice, That lay's her claim to your brother? Fel. Madam, it is; And this Fernando bad me tell ye more, He can requite your pardon with a Jewel Of fairest and of Richest price, Her brother. —— Elvr Oh, Sir, I thank him, My better reason has instructed me, (I'll make an End't that which you were saying) Her brother is a man, too good, of too much honor, Nay, too much love to be refused by me. Fel. And you too much of goodness and of merit Not to be honour'd as a Saint, By all that know you, and do hear you speak, I'll be gone, I shall talk my self in time. aside. Elv. Well, Sir, I can bear your Rallery. Fel. I'm serious, Why, Madam? Elv. Nay, Sir, if you are so, Pray bring Signior Alvaredo hither, Your brother too may come, and his fair Lady. Fel. Yes, Madam, I shall. Elv. Your servant, Sir, I shall expect your Promise. Exit Elv. Fel. It's we'll your gone, I had spoyl'd all else; my Pate Was hammering devices for my own advantage, Carnival do ye call it, I could Masquerade it bravely with her. Exit. Enter Quintagona, and Sancho.

Pity on me? thou Rascal, Thou Son of many Fathers I'll, have thee to know (But that I took thee for a pleasant And an honest dealing fellow) I should scorn thee; S'fish in my old Mistriss time I might had a Knight of Calatrava, Nay, within this twenty years, as much has been offered me Twice; two brave Knights, Pity on me; foh, Garlick —— San.
