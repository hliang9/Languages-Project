THE Conuerted Mans new Birth: Describing the di∣rect way to goe to HEAVEN. CHAP. I. This first Chapter entreateth of the principall Care, Zeale, and vehement desire, which euery one ought to take in the see∣king their saluation. THere is nothing in the World that we ought so to affect and desire, as to seeke to haue our soules saued in the Kingdome of Heauen: And if there bee any thing in the Booke of GOD, from the Alpha of Genesis, vnto the Omega of the Reuelation, that is able to draw a sinner vnto Repentance, sure it is the re∣membrance
of his Saluation; And as the Lord of Hosts hath drawne his sword by forraigne Nations, shewing the miseries that are like to ensue vppon vs by reason of our sinne, and se∣curity: Let vs now therefore, with all expedition, bestow our short and troublesome time in seeking our saluation, and with all Humility returne vnto the Lord by speedy Repentance, for if we loose the life of our bodies, by defending the Gospell, in see∣king our saluation, wee may find it againe; but if we loose our soules for want thereof, it will be irreuokeable, and neuer re∣called againe: Oh too too many now a dayes in this declyning age, seeme to bee carelesse of their saluation. And although England neuer liued so long in peace and securi∣ty, nor the Gospell neuer so generally Preached amongst vs, yet I feare, neuer did men make so ill vse of so good a blessing;
miranda miserecordia, Gods mer∣cy is to be wondred at, that he hath spared vs so long; it is his mercy, and nothing but his mercy, that wee are not consu∣med; our sinnes is, In ulti∣mo gradu, in the highest de∣gree that may bee, so that Lae∣tantur cum malefecerint, they re∣ioyce and take pleasure, when they haue done euill; wherefore I doubt not, but the iniquity of the whole World is come to maturity, which causeth our sinnes to crye louder then the sinnes of Sodome;Ezekel 16. 49. 50. and ascend higher then the sinnes of Ni∣niuch.Ionas 1. 2. Wherefore, if all our Nauie were ready, all our Ports for∣tified; all our Coasts guarded; all our men strongly armed, and our Land inuironed with a wall of Brasse; yet it is to be feared, that wee haue a Traytor within vs, euen our long continued and vnrepented sinnes, that will draw Gods vengeance vp∣pon
vs, and cause him to whet his sword, and vtterly confound vs, Except wee repent. God would haue spared Sodome, i there had beene but twenty, nay but ten Righteous therein: So no doubt, it is for some good peoples sake, that holds vp their hands like Moses, and grieue for the sinnes of our time, like Lot, that God hath spared vs so long. Agayne, Gods sword was once drawne agaynst Niniueh, agaynst whom a fearefull doome was pronounced; Yet forty daies and Niniueh shall bee destroyed. The King and the Nobility,Ionas 3. 4. with all his Subiects, present∣ly fell to Repentance: they fa∣sted; they prayed; and incessant∣ly with all humility humbled themselues in Sacke-cloath and Ashes, their sinnes cryed for vengeance; but their Repen∣tance for mercy, their sinnes ascend vp to Heauen,Ionas 1. 2. and cla∣mours loud in the eares of Gods
iustice for vengeance, venge∣ance, O reuenge with venge∣ance. Their Repentance ascends higher, and cryes louder into the eares of Gods mercy: Good Lord haue mercy, spare vs, O spare vs we beseech thee; where∣by we may see that God regards not the clamour of sinne, so much as hee doth the crye of a true repentant sinner. But England, O sinnefull England, there was neuer any Nation in the World, that hath such store of Heauenly Manna, as his Word, his Will, his Truth, his Gospell, which wee haue receiued, Iugentia be∣neficia, infinite benefits, much knowledge of the Truth, so much Preaching of the Word, and so much glorious light of the Gospell: And yet Mirandum est degeneres nos, it is wonder, and a great wonder, that such a degenerate generation as this, such a corrupt and sinnefull Na∣tion
as wee, should so liue in such a blessed and illuminated a time. But our sinnes, our sinnes, our vnrepented sinnes, are more then can bee numbred by any Arithmetition, and greater then can be measured by a Geo∣metrition: As ourIeremiah 5. 7. Eccles. 23. 9. swearing and forswearing; ourIerem. 17. 21. prophatning the Lords Sabaoth; ourIere. 6. 14. Ieremiah 5. 3. con∣tempt of Gods Word; ourIeremiah 6. 13 co∣uetousnesse; ourAmos 6. 6. drunkennes; ourEsay 3. 10, 11, 12. Ieremiah 9. 5. deceite; ourEzechiel 6. 9. whoredome, our pride, our vnthankfulnes, and our waxing worse & worse, with many moe, which crye to Heauen for Gods vengeance a∣gainst vs. Oh therefore let vs with all expedition seeke for our saluation by speedy repentance: Let vs not onely wéepe, but powre foorth our teares for our sins likeEsay 5. Esay 29. 20. Hab. 2. 5. Da∣uid:h Psal. 6. 6. Wrestle with GOD like Gene. 32. 24. Iacob: Crye likeEsay. 58. 1. Esay: That our heads may be full of water, and our eyes a Fountayne of

For there is no∣thing more needefull, then the saluation of our soules. The vehement desire of their saluation, caused the Patriarks, Prophets, and the Saints of the old World, to long for, and desire that eternall, sweete, and most ioyful inheritance, Regnum Dei, the Kingdome of God; It caused Abraham to forsake hisGene. 12. 4. Heb. 11. 8. owne naturall Countrey; and his Fathers House, and t go he knew not whither: It caused Moses to forsakeExod 2. 11. Heb. 11. 24. Aegypt, and refused to be called the Son

When Iohn the Baptist first Preached, Primitiua quidem Ecclesia, The Primitiue Church did most clearely shine, in so much thatMat. 11. 12. the Kingdome of Heauen suffered violence; That is, there was such forwardnesse and zeale, in those that heard him Preach, to procure their saluation, in the Kingdome of Heauen, that they stroue most earnestly to goe in; and this af∣fection
our Sauiour requireth, when he sayth, Striue to enter in at the straight Gate; For Domi∣nus vobiscum dum vos cum Do∣mino: The Lord is with you,Luke. 13. 24. while yée heare his voyce.2 Chro. 15. 2. The Prophet Dauid lamen∣ted that hée was so long kept from the ioyes of his Saluati∣on: Woe is me (sayth hee) that I am constrained to dwell with Mosech, and to haue my habita∣tion among the Tents of Keder. And agayne, Like as the Hart desireth the water brooke; so lon∣geth my soule after thee O God: And agayne, hée sayth, That hee should vtterly haue fainted, but that hee did rest in hope of a better Kingdome; and beleeued verily in short time, to see the ioyes of his Saluation, in the land of the liuing. And many others counted their Country but a cursed vale of misery; their worldly glory but vanity; their dwellings but a Prison; their pleasure but sor∣row,
mourning and teares; and all their doings were to this end that they might ioy in their saluation in the kingdome of Heauen. CHAP. II. The second Chapter entreateth of the shortnesse, and vncertainty of mans life, and how it may be a motiue to induce vs to re∣turne vnto the Lord by repen∣tance, because no man knowes the time thereof, nor when God will call him. ALl Creatures waxe olde with this aged World; although Methusela liued 969.Gen. 5. 27. yeares; yet in our age if we reach to 80. itPsal 89. 46. is with sorrow and labour; mans dayes are but aPsal. 39. 5, 6. span, saith Dauid, and all flesh is grasse, sayth the Pro∣phet Esay 40. 6.

Let the memory of death bee euer the looking-glasse of our life, and seeing the young must depart from the World as well as the old: Let vs imagine that the Spring of our dayes are past, our Summer is spent, and that wee are arriued at the Autumne, or fall of the leafe;Psalme 89. 46 So that in euery mo∣ment wee are in the waning; The date of our poore Pilgri∣mage
almost expired, and the Lamp of our liues lyeth twinck∣ling vppon the snuffe; our forces enféebled, our sences impayred, and on euery side, our tottering and ruinous cottage of our faint flesh, ready to fall. It were now high time, there∣fore, to leaue our owne wayes, andPsalme 77. 6. with all expedition looke towards our Caelestiall home; lest wée bée like those which are tos∣sed with many sturdy stormes, and cannot ariue at their desired Port; ride little way, but are much turmoyled.

The fourth Chapter entreateth of the Spirituall battle, in which no doubt, euery Regenerate man oftentimes fighteth against Sathan, before hee attaine eter∣nall life. SAthan is euer quiet with the sinner, before hee fea∣reth he shall loose him, but then hée séeketh by all meanes that possibly hée can, to attempt, peruert, and vtterly ouerthrow1 Peter 5. 8 him. Moses was quiet, vntill hée beganne to deliuer the Children of Israel; but then orah could say,Number 16. 3▪ Yee take too much vppon
you: King Dauid was quiet when he kept his Fathers1 Sam. 16. 11. sheep; but after he fought for the Church of God: Then Saul1 Sam. 17. 50. 1 Sam. 18. 11. 29 could rise against him: Saint Paul was quiet, so long as hee was with the ScribesActs 9. 1, 2. Acts 22. . 34. and Pharisees, but af∣terwards hee had enemies e∣nough: Sathan tempted, and o∣uercame the perfectest, asGenesis 3. 6. A∣dam; the strongest asIudges 16. 1 sampson; and the wisest as2 Reg 11 Salomon: Hee therefore that1 Cor. 10. 12. standeth, let him take heed lest he fall, Christ was no sooner Baptized, and had fa∣sted Mathew. 4. 1▪ Luke 4. 1. Marke. 1. 12. forty dayes, but Sathan could tempt him. And so it is with euery Re∣generate man, euen when hee is most weakest, then the Di∣uell is strongest,1 Peter 5. . and busiest a∣gaynst him; Who daily laboureth to delude him with all manner of inticements: First, To delight in sinne: Secondly, To consent: Thirdly, To custome, and from custome to hardness of heart from hardnesse of heart, to boasting,
from boasting, vnto desperation, and from desperation to damnati∣on; and thus by degrees, if sinne be not resisted, the Diuell will la∣bour to bring the sinner vnto de∣struction. Wherefore wee must daily labour to preuent them by Diuine meditations; diuert them by feruent prayers, and correct them by sighes, and speedy Re∣pentance: For I holde those intisements, and vanishing thoughts, which many times passe through a Regenerate man without approbation, not with∣out suppression, to be properly Nec mors nec morbus animae, sed deformitas, Neyther the death, nor disease of the soule, but the deformity thereof, they are Te∣la immisa, Sathans darts, shot at vs, In corde, non excorde, in the heart, not of the heart: which the godly seeke, but giue no consent vnto, they are our crosses, but not our sinnes, they are but Morbus mentis, The di∣sease of the minde.
Those motions St. Paul con∣fesseth, the Children of God, are neuer free from them: It is obserued in Hierom, which hee bewrayes in many places of his workes, That his whole life, was in continuall war-faire with his lusts: It caused St. Paul to crye out, to bee deliuered from the pricke of the flesh; But the Lord answered him, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in thy weaknesse. I hold these & such like temp∣tations, to bee the battle which euery Regenerate man fighteth agaynst Sathan. For, where wereTimothy 2. 9. grace, if there wereIames 1. 14. no temptation? where were mortifi∣cation, if no lusts toRomans 8 13. mortifie? And where wereColosians 3. 5 Iob 2. 10. patience, if there were noPsalme 19. 71 affliction? if there were no motion to sinne, where were the battle, the victory, and the Crowne wee shall obtaine, if wee haue no Aduersary to striue withall?
The Diuell, as hee is the Prince of this World, So still he seeketh whom he may deuoure;1 Peter 5. . he himselfe is chiefe generall, and is alwayes the sore-man in the battle; his Lieutenants are flesh∣ly lusts, which are in open war agaynst Chastity: the Serge∣ants of his Band, are the cursed Children of dacknesse, which are in continuall strife, agaynst the Children of light: His common Souldiers are the effects of the flesh, to fight agaynst the fruits of the Spirit. And their armour is the brest plate of iniury, the girdle of falshood, the shoes of discord, the shield of infidelity, the helmet of mistrust, with the piercing darts of cruelty, the Cannon shot of spitefull Re∣proaches, the arrowes of fly∣ing slanders, and the frailty of the flesh, to peruert and vtterly confound vs, except wee pre∣uent them by Prayer and Repen∣tance. Therefore, the Children of
God ought to put on Gods Ar∣mour, and manfully fight against the deuices of sinne,Ephesians 6. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Sathan, and all his detestable crue, before they can obtayne their spirituall inheri∣tance in the Kingdome of Hea∣uen: Which weapons are able to ouercome the Diuell, and all the lewd lusts of the world; yea, and all the whole host of vices therein. Our Captaine and chiefe Ge∣nerall, in all our conflict, Is the mighty. 5. 5. Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah, the Prince of Peace, the Conquerour of Death, Heil, and Sinne: Yea, theGes  great Iudge of the World, and 2. 2. Bishop of our Soules, Christ IesusMathew 1. 21 our Sa∣uiour. And to resist the Tyranny of the Diuell,1 Timothy 4  Acts 5. 31. it standeth vs in hand, to be also well and strong∣ly armed, with the brest-plate of equity, the Shield of vndoubted faith in Christ, the Helmet of as∣sured hope, the Shoes of know∣ledge and peace in the holy Ghost,
the girdle of truth, well buckled with patience, and constancy, the Cannon shot of deepe sighes, pro∣ceeding from a true penitent heart, the Arrowes of bitter teares, brought forth by remorse of con∣science, and the two edged Sword of the eternall word of GOD; For, it standeth vs vppon, to keepe our continuall battle, ready and orderly; To sight valiantly, hope assuredly, endure constantly, to march on charitably and cheerefully: To watch and stand fast in our fight, for the quarrell is GODS, and the Victory ours, euen the very saluation of our owne soules. If wée resist the Diuell in the power of Iesus Christ, He will flye from vs: So often as wee resist him, so often we ouercome, it will make the Angels glad, and glorifie GOD, which ex∣horts vs to fight, and helpes vs in our extreamity, and time of néede; GOD beholds our stri∣uing,
and helpes vs vp, that we should not faint; and will crowne vs with glory, and ho∣nour when we ouercome; there∣fore, the greater our Temptati∣ons are, the more noble must bee our Resistance; and the more godly our liues and conuersati∣ons are, the greater shalbee our Crowne and Glory, in the king∣dome of Heauen.

and his owne eternall well∣faire. Seeing then A faithfull wit∣nesse will not lye;Prouerbs 14. 7. and the Spi∣rit of the Penitent, testifie the Truth of his Repentance; why may not he then, be as firmely perswaded of the certainty of his saluation: as his heart wit∣nesseth the sincerity of his con∣uersion: Yes surely,2 Cor. 13. 5. St. Paul proues it, Know yee not your owne selues, how Iesus Christ is in you, except yee be Reprobates: Wee may surely know, that if wee haue truely repented, and are heartily sorry for our sinnes, with a full and determinate pur∣pose to continue in newnesse of life,Romans 81. That Christ is in vs,Iohn 5. 24. if Christ be in vs, then wee are in Christ; if wee bee in Christ, wee cannot be condemned: For there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus. For, sinne legally considered is mortall, ButEsay 59. 2. Luke 13. 3. Nahu. 2. 25. Euangelically, is veniall, except the sinne against
the Holy Ghost, mortall, by his owne merrit, butEsay 1. 18. Iohn 5. 8. veniall by Chirst his mercy: Mortall to the naturall vnregenerated man; For heeIohn 3. 18. that beleeueth not, is condemned already; but veniall to the Regenerate though still sinne: By the couenant of grace, it dissolueth not the loue and league betweene God and man, and so is veniall, in all other sinne is mortall by his owne na∣ture. Agayne,Rom. 7. 5. 6. by nature man and his flesh are all one, but by grace they are seperated: By nature when the flesh doth sinne, the man also sinneth, because hee is in subiection vnto it: but in the estate of grace, although the flesh be in him, (and doe sinne,) yet he sinneth not, because they are diorsed a sunder; For man assoone as hee is in the estate of grace, is newly married vnto Christ: In this case, although the flesh beget sin, yet the regene∣rate man shall not be condemned.

Therefore, Vnum necessarium, This one thing is necessary, what∣soeuer wee leaue vnknowne, let vs labour to know this, That wee areGala. 4. 9. 2 Timothy 2. 19 Romans 11. 2. Colo. 1. 10. Hosea. 6. 6. the Lords. Qui Chri∣stum discit, satis est si caetera nescit,
He may without danger be igno∣rant of those things, that truely knoweth Iesus Christ. The best haue desired to make their Saluation sure; as I the vnworthiest of all other, do day∣ly labour to doe the same: Dauid which knew yt God loued him, entreateth to know it more, I know thou fauourest me;Psalme 35. 3. yet hee cryed, Dic animamcae, Say vn∣to my soule. I am thy Saluation. The Scripture hath many proofes of theIohn. 19. 5 26. 27. Rom. 8. 9. 15. 16. Psalme 31. 1. Iob 13. 25. 26. Gala 4. 5. 6. 7. Iohn 4. 15. 16. 17 1 Iohn 2. 28. Psalme 35 9. 2 Peter 1. 10. certainty of our saluation; and Dauid would ne∣uer pray for that which could not be: neyther would St. Peter charge vs with a duty which could not possibly be performed: Make your election sure; which must bee done, by the true and proper worke ofHeb. 11. 1. 5. 6 Mat. 9. 29. Dan. 3. 17. Acts 15. 9. 1 Peter 1. 9. Faith, that giueth the true beleeuer a stedfast, and vnmooueable assurance of the loue of God, that hee may fully enioy the comfort of his Salua∣tion. And whereas St. Paul sayth,
Know yee not how Iesus Christ is in you,2 Cor. 13. 5. except yee be reprobates? Here the Apostle giueth vs to vnderstand, that all which be∣leeue, haue the spirit of discer∣ning, to know certainely that they doe beleeue. And sheweth that, to prooue a mans selfe whether he be in the faith, which is to prooue whether Christ bee in him, because the Faith of which he speaketh, is that liuely saith, whereby Christ dwelleth in our hearts. Hee therefore that knoweth himselfe to bée in the true Faith, knoweth Christ to bee in him∣selfe: As St. Paul sayth, I know whom I haue beleeued. And a∣gayne, by this wee know,2 Timo. 1. 12. hee dwelleth in vs, euen by the spi∣rit which he hath giuen vs:1 Iohn 3. 24: It is manifest yt the property of true faith, guides the assurance of our saluation, and the greater our faith is,1 Peter 1. 7. 8 9 the greater is our assurance. And consequently the true be∣léeuer knoweth, and is assured of
his election and saluation, for Faith is the Faith of Gods elect:Acts 13. 48. So many beleeued as were orday∣ned vnto saluation:om. 8. 38. 39. And I am per∣swaded that neyther death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principali∣ties, nor powers, nor things pre∣sent, nor things to come, shall bee able to seperate mee, from the loue of God. Therefore the A∣postle was fully perswaded of his saluation:2 Timoth. 4.  And agayne, Hence∣forth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse: So the Virgin Mary called Christ her Sauiour;Luke 1. 47. and the Théefe upon the Crosse,Luke 23. 43. sayd, Lord remember me; The like sayd St. Paul,Gala. 2. 20. That Christ gaue himselfe for me.Phil. 1. 2. 3. If you bee demanded how long you may be assured of your saluation; you may answer, so long as you haue truely repented, and continue in newnesse of life, your sure trust & confidence is, yt God will neuer forsake them that put their trust in him: for Euery one that belee∣ueth in him,Rom. 9. 33. shall not be ashamed.
And this promise God hath made to all that beleeue in him: I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shal not depart from me:Iere. 32. 40. And agayne, There is no con∣demnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, because (sayth the Apostle) they walke not after the flesh,Rom. 8. 1. but after the Spirit. Lastly, the most excellent Faith, sheweth not it selfe most glorious, when wee haue most sence or feeling; but rather when we feele, or discerne the contra∣ry. Iob,Iob 13. 15. when he apprehended nothing but Gods wrath and displeasure, euen then he shew∣ed a most victorious Faith, Loe, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: The like of Iacob, in his tedious conflict,Gene. 32. 24. where hee sayd, I will not let thee goe, ex∣cept thou blesse mee:Hosea 12. 4. And the woman of Canaan, who al∣though shee receiued diuers re∣pulses, and earnest deniall, yet continued her suite,Mat. 15. 28. and is com∣mended▪ for her Faith,Heb. 12. 2. by the
Author and finisher of our Faith. To conclude, wee are not to build the assurance of our salua∣tion, vppon our owne sence or feeling; but vppon Gods vn∣changeable and gracious promi∣ses made vnto vs, in Christ Iesus. CHAP. VI. The sixt Chapter, sheweth an ex∣cellent marke to know the child of God, which hath truely re∣pented. HE that hath earnestly Repented, and is true∣ly conuerted from his sinnes, hath this special marke in him:Mat. 13. 14. Hee is none of those fruitlesseMat 13. 19. 29 hearers, barren beleeuers, vnregenerate know∣ers, or verball Professors; but he is the faithfull doer of the will and word of God. Whosoeuer1 Iohn 3. 5 keepeth Gods word, in him verily is the loue of
God perfected: Hereby know we that we are in him, hee that abi∣deth in God, ought also to walke euen as he hath walked: That is as St. Iohn sheweth vs, Euery man that1 Iohn 3. 2. hath this hope in him, purifieth himselfe, euen as hee is pure: And seekethPsalme 95. 8. the present time to returne vnto the Lord; because hee hath a bleeding and a tenderPsalme 51. 17 heart; it tremblethPsalme 51. 4. at the Word: It is prickedActs 2. 37. when it is rebuked; and inflamed with bur∣ning Psalme 69. 5. Iohn 2. 17 psal 119. 139. Titus 2. 14. zeale, when it is instructed. The Regenerate man desireth nothing so much, As hee 55. 6. 26. desi∣reth God; Therefore, he maketh himselfe1 Iohn 3. 3. fit for him,Rom 4 7. 8 Blessed; theEsay 41. 8.

All those bee tearmes of loue, and that from Christ himselfe, to requite the Regenerate man, that returneth vnto him by vn∣feigned Repentance.
