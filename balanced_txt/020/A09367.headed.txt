Here begynneth A shorte monycyon, or counsayle of the cure & gouernaunce of a housholde / accordynge vnto policy: taken out of a pystle of a great lerned man, cal¦led Bernarde syluestre. modified printer's device of Robert Wyer, with his name,the eagle, and part of the foreground cut away (McKerrow 67β)
HEre good & deuoute Chrystyans / fyrste ta¦ke most hede / and gy¦ue most dylygence to ordre your selfe / and all youres, vnto oure lorde accordynge vnto the poore les∣son that comes after: and than se wel vnto the substaunce and gydynge of youre house / and goodes. Se fyrste that peace be in the house / and that you agre all togyther, for els al your goodes wyll soone goo to noughte. Than (after ye cōmune prouerbe) cut your thonges: after or accordyng vn¦to your ledder. Spende accordynge vnto your gaynes: gettynges or ren∣tes / and not aboue. It is also good polycye: to haue one yeres rent / or an yeres gaynes in store for chaunces / whiche is not contrarye vnto christy anyte: where extreme or verey streyte nede: is not perceyued in the neygh∣boure. A neglygent or retcheles per∣sone
may soone set on fyne, & destroy great substaunce. Haue therfore a good iye / and garde vnto the dylygē¦ce of your seruaūtes, for vnder them your goodes may soone mynysshe & be wasted before you knowe / beware or haue knowleg therof. yf your goo¦des begynne to waste: better is / and lesse rebuke for you to absteyne / and withdrawe your charges: than to fal in to nedynes / or daunger. An olde prouerbe. Qui plus expendit {quam} rerū copia tendit. Non admiretur si pau∣pertate grauetur. That is. who so done spende beyonde theyr faculte. No meruayle though with nede they greued be. ¶It is therfore a great prouydence and good foresyght often to counte / and compare your goodes / and your gaynes with your expēses. Often to ouerse your good: shall be necessary. For your beestes may take hurte for
defaute of fode (all thoughe they no∣thynge axe) ne complayne. The slepe of ye housbande: maketh a fatte dong hylle. And the iye of ye mayster, a fast hors. That is to meane that the pre∣sence of the mayster: in euery corner: is moche profytable. Sumptuous & costlye weddynges, or brydales, ben damage / without honoure. Expēces done vpon warre / ben more honou∣rable / than profytable. Better is to suffre some wronge, and to bye peace than to make warre / or to kepe war. Coste made vpon {pro}dygal persones / is clerely lost. Cost made vpō kyn or frēdes / is resonable. Fede your hous¦holde seruaūtes with honest cōmune fare / without delycates. For the ser∣uaunt that is made a gloton shall ne¦uer after mende his maners. Gloto∣ny is vyle fylthy / & stynkynge & wyll make the neglygent and careles per¦son soone roten and short lyfe. Mea∣ne fedynge with scarcyte: is vnto the
dilygent person pleasaūt and profy∣table. Vpon the holy dayes & hyghe festes: gyue your housholde plentye of mete: but selden & fewe delycates. For the vse of delycate fode / wyll so∣ne marre a good seruaunt. Let gloto¦nye and thy purse stryue / and go to lawe togyther / and beware thou wel whiche parte thou takest / but for the moste parte alway hold with the pur¦se. For glotonous men of lawe & the witnessers: done speke of all affecciō. but the purs bryngeth in playne euy¦dence and profe / the empty barne & the empty bag. But yf very nygardy shut vp thy purse / than art not thou an euē iudge. For nygardy is a folys¦she & nedeles fere / & euer lyuynge in pouerte / and hurdeth & muckerythe vp: he can not tell for whom. yf thou haue plenty of corne: desyre no derth For those persones that of couetous mynde done procure or desyre derthe done procure and desyre the dethe of
the pore / and shall be accused: as ho¦micides and mansleers / sell thy cor∣ne better chepe vnto thy neyghboure (al though he were thy enemy) than vnto straungers, For an enemy is sō¦tyme soner vaynquysshed and ouer∣comen by a kynde dede / than by the swerde. Be neuer at debate with thy neyghboure / but rather studye and laboure to be at one. For thou canste haue none so sure a castell / or garde of thy lyfe / as is loue and frendshyp of thy neyghboure / yf thou suspecte the women of thy house: let other per¦sones rather shewe yt / than thou shul¦de be ouer busy to try out the mater. For though it were of thy owne wyf, or the wyfe of thy husbande: it were better vnknowen. For ones knowen it is neuer cured / the wounde is with out remedy. yf any remedy be / it shal be whan lyke chaūce is herd of other persones. The leste & moste easy way therin is to dissimule ye mater though
it were pryuely knowen / & pretende yngnoraunce without any quarel or countenaūce / but rather by a dyscre∣te ghostly father let the partyes be re¦fourmed that synne be not cōtynued A noble herte / and hygh gentyl myn¦de / wyll neuer serche of womens ma∣ters. Ashrewe wyll soner be correctid by smylynge or laughyng / than by a staffe / or strokes. The best way to ke¦pe a woman good / is gentyll intrety and neuer to let her know that she is suspecte / and euer to be counceyled & informed with louyng maner. an old woman vnclene of lyuynge (yf the lawe wolde suffre) shulde be buryed quycke. Let your clothynge or araye be in amene / nother vyle ne precious but alway fayre and honest / & of sad & not of wanton fasshyon. A costelye garment beyonde: or aboue the state and degre of the person / is a sygne & token of lytell wytte. For a woman yt hath suffycyent aray / to desyre newe
and chaunge / is a sygne of lytell sad¦nes. Trust hym rather for thy frende that sōwhat dothe for the / than hym that dothe offre hym selfe / saynge. I am yours in all I can and may. For in wordes is great plente of frendes a true frende loueth at all tymes and neuer fayleth at nede. There is no cō¦paryson of ryches / vnto a faythefull frende. Neuer repute ne thynke hym thy frende / that dothe prayse / or bost the vnto thy face / or in thy presence. whan you gyue coūseyle vnto a fren¦de / say this semeth best vnto me / not thus you muste nedely doo. For you may soner gette rebuke or blame for your counceyle yf it pryue not / than thanke, for youre goode counceyle: though it spede well / yf mynstrelles / iogulers / or iesters come to thy how∣se / say thou haste no lodgynge for su¦che iesters / you kepe nether ynne nor alestake. For yf you take pleasure in theyr pastymes you ben full lyke to
haue another wyfe shortly after who¦se name is called pouerte / or beggry. yf you fortune to come where they ben / and begyn somwhat to delecte in theyr maters: I aduyse you dyssi∣mule & take vpon you that you herd theym not / ne set any thynge therby. For yf they perceyue and se you but laugh: they wyll take that for an er∣nest to crye largesse & to haue reward And so importune wyll they be / and so shamfully craue: that you shall be yrke and wery of them / and perauen¦ture they wyll fall to rebukyng / brau¦lyng / and scoldynge / so that you shal be fayne / and glade: to gyue sōwhat for fere vnto those galowe clapers / worthy in dede to be hanged vp. For I tell you / god is not pleased with yt occupacyon / excepte it be (as scant to¦lerable or alowable) among prynces lordes / and hygh estates. Nowe for your seruauntes / yf you haue a ser∣uaunt of hygh proude mynde & stub∣burne
stomacke put hym away leste after he do you harme / & soo do hym that alwaye dothe prayse youre ma∣ners in all thynges. For a flaterer is worse than an enemy / your enemye cānot lyghtly deceyue you, but your seruaūtes or your neyghboures that done prayse you: ben surely about to deceyue you. Yf you haue a bashful & dredfull seruaūt, & fynde hym fayth∣ful, thā loue hym & cherysshe hym as your own natural child. Make your byldynges rather for nede, than for pleasur. For the appetyte of byldyng for pleasur shall neuer haue ende / tyl pouerte teche wyt some what to late. Be lothe to sell your herytage, and if you must nede / sell. Sell not to grea¦te persones / but rather for lesse vnto the lower persones. Better is to sell than to borow by vsery. For vsery is lyke a thefe yt wold warne you before what harme he wolde do vnto you / Yf you bye or bargayne / be not botye
felowe wt great {per}sones. And though he be vnder you / yet stryue not with hym leste he put his parte vnto your better / or mayster. In all thynges ke¦pe truely and faythfully your bonde and promyse / accordynge vnto your couenaunte. Due temporaunce is a thyng of great honestye in a houshol¦de / let therfor your drynke wyne / ale or bere be temporate. Stronge dryn¦ke is more pleasaunt / than holsome. The wyseman sayth / that sobre dryn¦ke is the helth bothe of soule & bodye And the wyse & lerned persone, wyll be ryght well cōtent with lytell dryn¦ke / and that shall not trouble the sto¦macke, but rather cause swete & hol∣some slepe / and of the contrary done come many incommodytes as there dothe folow. who so euer amōge ma∣ny and dyuers strōge drynkes / with aboundaunce therof, is sobre may be called an erthly god / or a god vpon erth / wrastle not therwith yf you doo
my counsell. And yf by chaunce you be in company / and begyn to fele the drynke worke / aryse & departe / a sle∣pe is more meite for you, than any cō¦pany. who so by wordes wold excuse dronkēnes: dothe openly declare his owne dysease. The knowlege & iuge¦mēt of wynes: doth nothyng become a yonge {per}sone. Yf a physycyon or sur¦gyon vse to be dronke / lette hym not haue ye cure of your dysease / ne let no ne of them take experyence / and ler∣ne in you: howe to cure / or hele ano∣ther. For though they be well lerned and haue not experyēce / it is no wys∣dome to let them proue theyr cōnyng vpon you. Great gay horse / & lytel prety dogges: leue you vnto lordes & ladyes. A bygge labourynge hors / and a mastyfe / or a curre dogge: ben good to kepe your house. As for hau¦kes / houndes / and huntyng dogges do spende more thā they do get, they ben mete & accordynge for states: to
set ydle seruaūtes on werke but ferre vnaccordynge ben they: for busban∣des and ware housholders. It is no wysdom to make your owne chylder stewardes or rulers of your houshol¦de or goodes. Foles and neglygente or careles persones: haue many mys∣fortunes. For that is theyr cōmune excuse whan any thynge is wronge, they say than / that chaūce or mysfor∣tune was cause therof. I say not nay but that chaunce or mysfortune may fall. But who so doth folowe wysdō lernynge / & dyscrecyon, shall seldom accuse mysfortune. For delygēce / wa¦renes / and good hede, done seldome company with mysfortune. But yet more seldom shall you se mysfortune and slouthe or neglygence, departyd in sondre, for they done cōmunely cō¦pany to gyther. The sluggard sayth god wyll helpe hym / and so longe he trusteth ther vnto, tyll he be brought vnto beggery. For god by ye wyse mā
doth sende the sluggarde (for exāple) vnto the ant or pismere, to lerne to la¦bour. For man sayth Iob is borne to laboure / as a byrde to flye. Kepe you therfore but few ydle persōs or men. And watche you and take good hede vnto euery persone of youre house / & euer ponder / wey / and consydre your exspences / with your gaynes / or get∣tynges. Fyrst get and brynge in / and than spende. For it is no good hus∣bandry to borowe. And when ye wex aged / trust rather vnto god / than vn¦to your chylder / or frendes / that you sende before you / you shall be sure to fynde. No cofre / chyst / ne tower may be more sure to kepe treasure than is heuen. Let not therfore ye poore passe you. what you gyue to them, you gy∣ue vnto Cryste. And of that you leue behynde you, appoynt it vnto euery persone his part. For better were for you nothynge to leue / than that stry∣fe and debate shulde be made / conscy¦ence
blemysshed / and god offendyd / for your goodes. Trust them beste to do for your soule / not that done loue or say they done loue your soule / but that you done perceyue and coniectu¦re, done loue theyr owne soule. Ma∣ke your testament euery yere newe / & surely sealyd by wytnes. Lay it whe∣re (whan nede is) it maye be founde / no man is sure how to ende his lyfe. The moste sure waye, to dye well / is well to lyue / whiche he graunte vs yt bought vs our lord god & most swe∣te sauyoure Ihesu chryste. Amen. ¶Here endeth the boke Intytuled the gournaunce of housholde. Imprynted by me Robert wy∣er, dwellyng at the sygne of seynt Iohn̄ Euangelyst / in seynt Martyns pa∣rysshe in the bysshop of Norwytche ren¦tes, besyde Cha∣rynge crosse.
