The Sheeps Skin pull'd off from the Wolfs back: OR The Uncasing of the KNIGHT. BEING A SATYRICAL COPY of VERSES ON The abominable and treasonable Practices of a Pagan Knight with a Christian Name, now in the TOWER. OF all the Plots we ever yet have read, That Jesuites hatch'd, or Hell it self has bred, No one like this did ever yet appear, Tho this, of Plots, has been a fruitful year. The Pagan Knight, with Presbyterian Face, Shall 'mongst the Chief of Plotters have the place; And in Hells deep Consults, there's none shall dare, If he be by, to step into the Chair. The King of Spain, and his proud vaunting Elves, Plotted our Ruine, but 'twas like themselves; They came with Arms, with Halters, and with Knives, To kill the Men; with Lust, t' abuse their Wives. The Pope, good man, plotted with bloudy Knife, To take Elizabeth's Renowned Life; With Curses, Dagger, Pistol, Poyson too, He honestly did his Designes pursue. The Jesuits, of Hells Privy-Council sworn, And all the bald-pate Priests that e'er were shorn, Plotted at once to blow into the Air The King, his Issue, Commons, every Peer; And (like the Tyrant, who but wish'd it) so To cut a Kingdoms Head off at one Blow. Those Holy Fathers, with their Secretary, Who with their Plots, at Tyburn did miscarry, Plotted to take our Soveraigns sacred Life By Pistol, or by Poyson, Sword, or Knife; Then to enslave the free Necks of a Nation, And to bring in a Popish Reformation:
Yet these come short of what this Knight would do, Who did more devilish Plots than these pursue; For all their Plots this Knight had made his own, And them upon the Protestants had thrown. Thus, like a Wolf cloath'd in a white Sheeps Case, The Knight appears with Presbyterian Face; With them he clubs, and hears them preach and pray, The better onely that he might betray: For every night the Knight is brought to bed, Of all the Treacherous Issue of his head, By Mother Midnight, who the impious Brood Did into nursing Jesuits hands intrude. Hell such a pile of Villany ne'er rear'd, And such a Plot as this was never heard, To clear the Guilty (which the Devil ne'er meant) And to accuse and damn the Innocent; To hang up Dugdale, Bedloe, Smith, and Oates, And to make Protestants cut Protestants Throats; To swear good Patriots honest Lives away, A List of which hidden in Meal-tub lay: To bring Fire, Sword, War, Dread, and Devastation, And to defile, with innocent bloud, a Nation; And then to set up th' Image of the Beast, To which all men must bow, or b'hang'd at least. But now the Wolf has lost his outward Case, And he appears with his own wolfish Face; His Popish Claws and bloudy Fangs are shown, The counterfeit Sheep for a meer Wolf is known; And in the Tower secur'd; he now between The Lions, Monsters, and worse Beasts is seen. Tho with a learn'd Astrologer, the Fate Of Kings and Kingdoms he did oft debate; And tho the Stars had others Fates made known, He never in those Books could read his own. But sometimes Poets, who are Vates too, Can tell as much as Gadbury can do; And they declare, the wolfish Knight will be, With several other Traytors, such as he, Who for such Practices in Holds are pent, Like wicked Vermine hang'd, next Parliament.
FINIS.
